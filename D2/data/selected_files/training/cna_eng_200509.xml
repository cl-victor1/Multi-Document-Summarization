Manila Bulletin: Justice

yesterday said they had gathered 73 votes and needed
only six more signatures to move the impeachment
complaint against President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo to
immediate trial in the Senate.

CPC WON'T HIKE GAS PRICES THURSDAY: ECONOMICS MINISTER
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Sept. 1 (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Economic Affairs Minister Ho Mei-yueh said
the state-run Chinese Petroleum Corp. (CPC) will not raise gasoline
prices Thursday because of Typhoon Talim, which has been ravaging
Taiwan since Wednesday evening.
</P>
<P>
Ho made the comments at the Central Disaster Prevention and
Relief Center when reporters asked her whether the CPC will follow
privately run Formosa Petroleum Corp. which announced a gas price
hike of almost 10 percent Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
She said the CPC lost more than NT$3 billion (US$91.6 million) in
August, adding: "However, in consideration of the fact that the
people are being hit by a typhoon, we will not allow an upward
adjustment of gasoline prices today."
</P>
<P>
The CPC incurred heavy losses in August because world crude oil
prices soared 60 percent, she said.
</P>
<P>
According to the Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and
Statistics (DGBAS) , the impact of rising oil prices on economic
growth is not as great as during the second oil crisis of the 1970s
as the ratio of crude oil consumption to gross domestic product (GDP)
has dropped by 25.3 percent since that time.
</P>
<P>
In the United States and Japan, the ratio has dropped by a even
larger margin -- 36.5 percent and 37.2 percent, respectively,
according to the DGBAS.
</P>
<P>
The DGBAS attributed this drop to technological progress, growth
in productivity, and the promotion of energy conservation, as well as
the development of the service industry, the Internet and the
integrated circuit.
</P>
<P>
Liang Chi-yuan, a research fellow with Academia Sinica, Taiwan's
top research body, estimated that a 10-percent hike in oil prices
will cause a dent of 0.27 percent in Taiwan's GDP growth.

AMTRAK APOLOGIZES FOR LISTING TAIWAN AS PROVINCE OF CHINA
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Washington,  Aug.  31 (CNA)
(By J.L. Chi and P.C.Tang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The U.S. National Railroad Passenger
Corporation, Amtrak, has made a correction and an apology for its
error of listing Taiwan as a province of China in its online billing
address form, the Formosan Association for Public Affairs (FAPA) said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
As Amtrak had not responded to a protest lodged by a group of
Tawianese expatriates in the United States after discovering the
error in May of this year, the pro-Taiwan organization in the United
States said that it's president, Wu Ming-chi, decided to send a
letter to David L. Gunn, president and chief executive officer of
Amtrak, in July, requesting that the corporation correct the "grave
error" by revising its country listing. He requested that Taiwan be
listed simply as "Taiwan," with any reference to China being dropped.
</P>
<P>
Claiming that Amtrak, as a federal-funded corporation, should
adhere to U.S. State Department guidelines, Wu said in the letter
that in 1996, the U.S. State department released an unclassified
memorandum providing guidelines on U.S. relations with Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
"The memorandum states that, since the United States has no
diplomatic relations with the ROC, U.S. officials need to refer to
Taiwan simply as "Taiwan, " he also said, adding that therefore,
Amtrak, a corporation created by Congress that relies on federal aid
to survive, should correct its terminology in reference to Taiwan as
well.
</P>
<P>
According to the FAPA, the corporation made an apology Aug. 16
for the error and said that it has corrected the error as requested
by the organization.

THAI OFFICIAL, BROKERAGE  FIRMS SAID TO HAVE RECEIVED KICKBACKS
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Bangkok,  Sept.  1 (CNA)

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Three Thai manpower brokerage firms and
several former Thai labor officials collected kickbacks in sending
Thai laborers to Taiwan, an adviser to the Thai parliament's
committee on labor said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Ikaporn Rakkhwamsuk said they will be the target of a next round
of investigations.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that initial investigations have shown that a Thai
official and several former labor officials collaborated with Taiwan
politicians and brokerage firms to exploit 1,700 Thai laborers
working for the Kaohsiung Rapid Transit Corp. (KRTC) in southern
Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
The matter only came to light after the Aug. 21 riot by Thai
laborers in protest against poor treatment and poor living
conditions.
</P>
<P>
Ikaporn said that Thai officials involved in the matter have
close exchanges with Taiwan and its brokerage firms and that they
collected 80,000-130,000 Thai baht (about US$2,000-4,250) for each
Thai laborer they sent to Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
He also said that the Thai manpower brokerage firms sent Thai
laborers to the KRTC via a Taiwan brokerage firm, which is also
considered to have connections with some government officials.
</P>
<P>
The Thai parliament's committee on labor has already put Thai
laborers on the agenda, and it is set to discuss possible directions
to take in the matter.

<TEXT>
<P>
The second session of the sixth Legislative
Yuan is due to open Sept. 13, and whether the long-stalled arms
procurement package and confirmation of the Control Yuan members will
be put on the legislative agenda is still a focus of media attention.
</P>
<P>
An arms procurement bill and its budget to buy eight
diesel-electric submarines, six Patriot PAC III anti-missile
batteries and a squadron of 12 P-3C anti-submarine aircraft from the
United States as well as the confirmation of the Control Yuan members
nominated by President Chen Shui-bian have been stalled for two
consecutive sessions due to opposition from the "pan-blue alliance"
of the Kuomintang and the People First Party which holds a slim
majority in the 225-seat legislature. 
</P>
<P>
With the year-end elections for city and county chiefs, city and
county councilors, and village and township heads quickly
approaching, the ruling and the opposition parties are also expected
to unveil a series of bills related to the general public to solicit
public support and enhance their chances of winning the elections.
</P>
<P>
Legislators originally planned to report for the new session
Sept. 1-2, but due to Typhoon Talim, which made landfall in eastern
Taiwan Thursday morning, this has been postponed to Sept. 2-5.
</P>
<P>
After the new session kicks off Sept. 13, the legislators will
have a general interpellation and review the budget of the central
government. During the interpellation period, the legislators will
also review livelihood-related bills one day every two weeks.

CHINA AGAINST TAIWAN'S INCLUSION IN ANY NATION'S MISSILE DEFENSE
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Beijing, Sept. 1 (CNA)
(By T.L. Tseng and P.C.Tang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Beijing opposes the inclusion of Taiwan in
any nation's missile defense system and does not support those
countries that want to supply such systems to the island, a ranking
Chinese official for arms control affairs said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Yan, director-general of the arms control department of the
Ministry of Foreign Affairs, made the remarks while implicitly
criticizing the United States' development of a missile defense
system at a press conference held by the information office under the
State Council.
</P>
<P>
Developing such missile defense systems might have an impact on
international stability and relations among nations as well as
regional security and the proliferation of missile technology, the
official said, expressing the hope that "the countries concerned"
will have "a careful attitude" in this respect.
</P>
<P>
Without giving a direct response to a question raised regarding
whether China will threaten Taiwan with its nuclear weapons, Zheng
said that China has promised not to use nuclear weapons to attack
other countries ever since it first successfully tested an atomic
bomb in 1964.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, he said that Beijing has also promised not to use
nuclear weapons against those countries and regions that do not
possess such weapons.
</P>
<P>
"These promises remain unchanged and will never change in the
future as they are an important policy and stance of China on the
nuclear issue," he said.

ROC, DPRK AT APEC SUMMIT WOULD BE 'HISTORIC MOMENT': PRESIDENT CHEN
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei, Sept. 1 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President Chen Shui-bian said Thursday that
if both he and North Korean leader Kim Jong Il could attend this
year's informal leadership meeting of the Asia-Pacific Economic
Cooperation (APEC) forum in South Korea, it would be an "historic
moment."
</P>
<P>
The president made the remarks when he received a South Korean
delegation at the Presidential Office to attend the 30th Taiwan-South
Korean economic conference.
</P>
<P>
Chen thanked South Korean President Roh Moo Hyun for sending an
envoy to Taiwan in late July to extend an invitation to him to attend
the 2005 APEC summit, which will be held in South Korea's
second-largest city, Busan, in November.
</P>
<P>
Although the chance of participating in the summit is slim in
view of past practices, the president reaffirmed that he is very
willing to attend the meeting as it is the right of the leaders of
member states, and Taiwan should not be the only exception.
</P>
<P>
Due to Beijing's obstruction, the Republic of China's head of
state was unable to attend previous APEC annual informal leadership
meetings and instead had to name a proxy to attend on his behalf.
</P>
<P>
The president said that Taiwan, Hong Kong and China became APEC
members in 1991 at the same time due to the assistance of South
Korea. He said he hopes that South Korea will exercise the same
"political wisdom" to help him attend the APEC summit this year.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that if he and Kim Jong Il could attend the APEC
summit, it would be an historic moment, and Roh Moo Hyun will leave a
legacy of helping create the breakthrough.
</P>
<P>
The president noted that bilateral trade between Taiwan and South
Korea has grown in recent years at a pace of 30 percent annually,
reaching US$16.9 billion in 2004, with South Korea enjoying a trade
surplus of US$6.3 billion, becoming the second-largest country with
which Taiwan has a trade deficit. South Korea is the fifth-largest
trading partner of Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
The president noted that Taiwan-South Korea relations have been
improving over the years, citing as examples the close and friendly
relations, the mutual waiving of visas, the resumption of air links
and the establishment of a Taiwan representative office in Busan.
</P>
<P>
On civilian exchanges, people from both countries made a total of
450,000 visits in 2004, two-thirds of which were Taiwanese visiting
South Korea, while the remaining third were South Koreans visiting
Taiwan, up 60 percent from the previous year.
</P>
<P>
In view of the close trade exchanges, Chen expressed the hope
that the long-disrupted economic ministerial-level consultations
between the two countries can be resumed and that a free trade
agreement between the two countries can be signed.

<P>
Commenting on the report, a Presidential Office spokesman said
the itinerary of President Chen's upcoming visit to Central America
will be announced after the date for his meeting with the top leaders
of the Republic of China's diplomatic allies in the region is
scheduled.
</P>
<P>
Chen Wen-tsung, director of the Public Affairs Department of the

PRESIDENT CHEN LAUDS 'SELF-CONFIDENT' 'TAIKE'
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei, Sept. 1 (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President Chen Shui-bian waded into the war
of words about the meaning of the popular term "taike" again
Thursday, saying the word has two meanings, one derogatory and the
other showing Taiwanese self-confidence.
</P>
<P>
Literally meaning "guest of or visitor to Taiwan, " "taike" has
become the focus of heated debate.
</P>
<P>
On Aug. 25, while meeting a group of overseas Taiwanese
businessmen, Chen made his first public comment about the term
"taike, " claiming the 23 million Taiwan people are not "guests of
Taiwan" but are "masters of the country."
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, Chen said some people think it an insult if they are
called "taike" while others are proud of the word. The different
interpretations show that Taiwan is becoming a healthy, diversified
and multicultural society.
</P>
<P>
Personally, said the president in his "Mood Notes" that appeared
on his electronic newspaper, he agrees with those who define "taike"
as a new generation of Taiwanese that dare to overthrow old
traditions with vibrant vitality by purging the term of all of its
negative connotations of the past.
</P>
<P>
"Taike" has acquired a derogatory and insulting meaning when
Taiwan's own culture was persecuted and discriminated against by an
"alien regime," Chen wrote in "Mood Notes."
</P>
<P>
He was referring to the Kuomintang (KMT) regime that moved to
Taiwan from China in 1949, starting a long period of dictatorial rule
as it insisted on its political legitimacy by, in the words of the
president, "promoting Chinese cultural chauvinism."
</P>
<P>
Chen said that over the past 400 years, Taiwan had been colonized
by the Dutch, Spanish, Manchurians, Japanese and the KMT regimes. If
every new group of rulers could only impose its own ideology on the
people of Taiwan in disregard of their indigenous culture, he said he
fears that ethnic divisions in Taiwan will worsen.
</P>
<P>
Fortunately, he said, with Taiwan's political democratization,
its people have rediscovered their rights to be their own masters and
they can define their own arts and cultural creations, allowing the
term "taike" to take on a new meaning.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, said the president, he would like to give credit to
those who have dared to bring a new meaning to "taike" with courage
and creativity. He called this "the first step toward making Taiwan a
healthy and multicultural society."

FORMER ROC PRESIDENT TO VISIT U.S. IN EARLY OCTOBER

<TEXT>
<P>
Former Republic of China President Lee
Teng-hui is scheduled to visit Washington, D.C. on Oct. 6, a senior 
researcher from the Heritage Foundation disclosed Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Harvey J. Feldman, said that Lee will deliver a speech at the
Washington, D.C.-based National Press Club during his upcoming visit
and that the club's John Zenger Room has been reserved for the event.
</P>
<P>
Feldman, who served as director of the Office of Republic of
China Affairs in the State Department when Washington shifted its
diplomatic recognition from Taipei to Beijing, said that China is
expected to lodge a protest against Lee's upcoming visit to the
United States.
</P>
<P>
However, Feldman claimed that the State Department sees no reason
to deter Lee from traveling to the United States as Lee is now a
civilian.
</P>
<P>
A State Department official declined to confirm Lee's planned
visit, saying that any visits by Lee would be private in nature as he
is now a regular citizen.
</P>
<P>
Lee's October trip will also take him to Los Angeles and New
York, according to Lee's close aides who are currently in the United
States to flesh out details of his itinerary.
</P>
<P>
They said that a pro-Taiwan U.S. state governor, who forged a
cordial friendship with Lee during Lee's 12-year presidency, is
assisting in arranging Lee's planned U.S. visit, adding that Lee most
looks forward to making his mark by visiting the U.S. capital.
</P>
<P>
If the travel plan is realized, it will be Lee's first trip to
the United States since his retirement in May 2000. Lee, an outspoken
critic of China's threat to Taiwan and an ardent advocate of Taiwan's
separate identity from that of China, has had difficulties visiting
countries that do not maintain diplomatic ties with Taiwan even after
his retirement.
</P>
<P>
In addition to meeting with Taiwan expatriates, Lee is scheduled
to meet with U.S. politicians, including congressional leaders, the
sources said, adding that Lee may also visit his alma mater, Cornell
University, during his planned U.S. visit which may last for two
weeks.
</P>
<P>
Lee made a rare visit to Cornell University in 1995 which drew a
strong backlash from China as Beijing leaders regarded the trip as
a move to promote formal Taiwan independence.

AVERAGE NET ASSETS PER FAMILY IN TAIWAN INCREASED IN 2003
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Sept.  1 (CNA)
(By Luis Huang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Thanks to hikes in share prices on the
Taiwan Stock Exchange, the average net worth of household assets in
Taiwan stood at NT$7.98 million (US$243,664.6) in 2003, an increase
of NT$690,000 from the 2002 level, according to a report released
Thursday by the Cabinet-level Directorate General of Budget,
Accounting and Statistics (DGBAS).
</P>
<P>
Of the amount, the assets of securities increased to NT$1.6
million, up NT$420,000 from the previous year's level, the
DGBAS-issued "2003 National Wealth Report" indicates.
</P>
<P>
A DGBAS official attributed the increase in the average net
assets mainly to hikes in share prices in 2003, which posted growth
of more than 30 percent.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, average deposits and life
insurance/retirement pension reserves increased by NT$140,000 and
NT$100,000, respectively, while real estate decreased NT$80,000 due
to drop in the publicly announced land value.
</P>
<P>
The report also shows that the net worth of government's assets
reached NT$23.8 trillion in 2003, up NT$843 billion or 3.7 percent
from the previous year's level, with land taking the lion's share of
NT$18.7 trillion.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, public debts amounted to NT$5.2 trillion, representing
an increase of NT$254.7 billion in comparison with the 2002 level.
</P>
<P>
The report also points out that Taiwan's gross national wealth
amounted to NT$114 trillion in 2003 and that after deducting
depreciation of assets, the net national wealth reached NT$92.8
trillion.

TAOYUAN TO BEGIN WATER RATIONING AFTER TYPHOON
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei, Sept. 1 (CNA)

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taoyuan County, and Linko in Taipei county
in northern Taiwan will begin water rationing early Friday in the
wake of Typhoon Talim, Taiwan Water Corp. officials said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
As expected, the water company said, the heavy rain brought by
the typhoon has increased the turbidity of the water in the Shihmen
reservoir, which supplies water to Taoyuan and Linko to the extent
that the water purification plants cannot handle it.
</P>
<P>
Water supplies to households in these two places will be cut to
every other day until the sediment and silt in the water settle, the
officials said.
</P>
<P>
The problem has plagued these areas since last year and the head
of the water company resigned at that time to take political
responsibility. However, Taoyuan was subjected to water rationing
again after Typhoon Matsa swept the island Aug. 5, and this time the
water company's president as well as a vice economic minister,
stepped down.
</P>
<P>
Water officials blame the excessive development of the
reservoir's catchment zone and the silting up of the reservoir as the
root causes that will take years to rectify.

MOFA STRIVING TO RESCUE 3 HIJACKED TAIWAN FISHING BOATS IN SOMALIA
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Sept. 1 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) is
striving to rescue three Taiwan fishing vessels that have been held
by Somalian rebels since mid-August for a ransom of US$1.5 million, a
senior official said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
According to MOFA spokesman Michel Lu, the three fishing boats --
the Kaohsiung-based Chungyi No. 218 and the Hsiaoliuchiu-based
Hsinlienfa No. 36 and Chengchingfeng -- have not been in contact
since they entered a Somalian fishing port Aug. 16 for refueling and
maintenance.
</P>
<P>
The shipowners later came to learn that the three ships had been
hijacked by Somalian insurgents and appealed to the MOFA Aug. 24 for
assistance, Lu said.
</P>
<P>
"The MOFA has since been trying every possible means to rescue
the three boats and their crews. We have invited officials from the
Mainland Affairs Council, the Fisheries Administration and other
relevant agencies for brainstorming sessions, " Lu said, adding that
the MOFA is also seeking assistance from international organizations.
</P>
<P>
The three hijacked boats have 13 Chinese crewmen, 14 Indonesians,
12 Filipinos and four Vietnamese. Lu said the MOFA has informed the
representative offices in Taipei of all crewmens' home countries of
the incident.
</P>
<P>
The three ships entered the Somalian port through the arrangement
of their Malaysian shipping agent, Lu said, adding that the
shipowners are still struggling to raise funds for the ransom.

<P>
President Chen Shui-bian has expressed his
sincere condolences and sympathy to U.S. President George W. Bush for
the devastation caused by Hurricane Katrina, the Ministry of Foreign
Affairs (MOFA) said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Premier Frank Hsieh and Minister of Foreign Affairs Tan Sun Chen
have also offered their heartfelt sympathies and concerns to the
governors of the four devastated states -- Louisiana, Mississippi,
Alabama and Florida, MOFA spokesman Michel Lu said.
</P>
<P>
"The messages have been conveyed to the White House and the Gulf
Coast state governments through our representative office in
Washington, D.C.," Lu said.
</P>
<P>
He said the government will come up with an aid list after the
ROC representative office in the United States makes an overall
review of the Katrina devastation.
</P>
<P>
According to Lu, no casualties involving Taiwan expatriates have
so far been reported, although some Taiwan expatriates' homes have
been destroyed. Lu said the MOFA has mobilized Taiwanese associations
and non-government charities such as the Buddhist Compassionate
Relief Tzu Chi Foundation's U.S. branches, to offer emergency aid to
affected Taiwanese expatriates.
</P>
<P>
Lu said the government will decide on concrete relief programs
after the ROC representative offices in Washington and Houston
finalize overall assessments.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. government has launched the most massive relief effort
in history to help people devastated by Hurricane Katrina. President
Bush said earlier in the day that while thousands more victims still

MOEA SEEKING TO WOO MORE BUSINESSMEN TO INVEST IN TAIWAN: OFFICIAL
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Sept. 1 (CNA)
(By Luis Huang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the face of a decline in investment by
overseas Chinese and foreigners in Taiwan during the January-July
period, the Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) is seeking to attract
more Taiwanese businessmen operating in foreign countries to invest
here, a government official said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics released by the MOEA's Investment
Commission, overseas Chinese and foreign entrepreneurs invested a
total of US$1.72 billion in Taiwan during the first seven months of
this year, down 17.37 percent compared with the year-earlier level.
</P>
<P>
Ou Chia-jui, director-general of the MOEA's Industrial
Development and Investment Center (IDIC) , attributed the decrease
mainly to a more conservative attitude adopted by foreign investors
because of the global economic stagnation.
</P>
<P>
However, Ou said that a large number of China-based Taiwanese
businessmen began to consider seeking other destinations for their
investments after Beijing implemented a policy aimed at cooling down
its overheated economy.
</P>
<P>
To inspire Taiwanese manufacturers operating in China to relocate
their production facilities back to Taiwan, Ou pointed out that
Minister of Economic Affairs Ho Mei-yueh and Vice Minister of
Economic Affairs Shih Yen-hsiang will attend the 11th annual meeting
of the World Taiwanese Chambers of Commerce slated for Sept. 20-22 in
Taipei to brief the meeting participants on various incentives for
domestic and foreign investors.
</P>
<P>
According to Ou, the IDIC has analyzed various industries
suitable for investment by Taiwanese manufacturers operating in
Europe, the United States and Asia and has passed on these investment
opportunities to overseas Taiwanese manufacturers associations for
reference.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the IDIC has also compiled new investment reference
manuals for returning Taiwanese businessmen, Ou said. He added that
the manuals contain investment information on such things as
incentives, as well land and labor supplies.
</P>
<P>
Ou further said that the MOEA has formed a task force in charge
of wooing foreign investors and that members of the task force will
regularly meet with other government agencies and foreign investors
to help them solve their investment problems.

BUSH URGED TO REITERATE SUPPORT FOR TAIWAN AT MEETING WITH HU
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Washington,  Sept.  1  (CNA)
(By C.L. Chi, Oliver Lin and P.C.Tang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A member of the U.S. House of
Representatives on Wednesday called for President George W. Bush to
reiterate during his upcoming meeting with Chinese President Hu
Jintao Washington's firm stance in support of democratic Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Rep. Thomas G. Tancredo (R-Colo.) made the appeal in a letter
sent to the president ahead of the scheduled meeting between Bush and
Hu in Washington, D.C. Sept. 7.
</P>
<P>
As Beijing has unilaterally escalated tensions in the Taiwan
Strait by threatening for no reason to use force against Taiwan and
even the United States, Tancredo also urged the president in the
letter to clearly express U.S. concerns about China's conduct during
his meeting with Hu.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, Tancredo also suggested that Bush remind the Chinese
president that the decision by the United States to establish
diplomatic relations with China in 1979 was based on a commitment by
Beijing to resolve the Taiwan issue peacefully, adding that the
passage of an anti-session law by the Chinese National People's
Congress in March this year goes against this commitment.
</P>
<P>
According to the representative, the Chinese government has a
responsibility to engage in dialogue with the duly-elected government
in Taiwan and should resolve cross-strait differences peacefully and
without any preconditions.
</P>
<P>
It is important for the United States to maintain friendly
relations with China, he continued, stressing, however, that
Washington should also tell Beijing bluntly that such relations
cannot be maintained at the cost of Taiwan's democracy.
</P>
<P>
The congressman had raised a motion in February of this year and
June of last year in the House to request that the U.S. government
resume diplomatic relations with Taiwan.

CHINESE OFFICIAL DIES IN HOT SPRING BATH ON YANGMINGSHAN

(By Deborah Kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A mainland Chinese official died of heart
failure during a hot spring bath on Yangmingshan in suburban Taipei
Thursday, the Shihlin District Prosecutors' Office confirmed Friday.
</P>
<P>
The body of Zhu Xiangdong, a deputy director of Beijing's
National Bureau of Statistics, who was visiting Taiwan on an academic
exchange program at the invitation of the Central Weather Bureau, was
found Thursday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Although the autopsy has not been completed, Prosecutor Wang
Jen-kuei said Zhu's death looks to be an accident as there are no
signs of foul play.
</P>
<P>
Zhu, visiting Taiwan in his capacity as an adviser to the
National Statistical Society of China, went to visit with four other
colleagues a meteorological station run by the Central Weather Bureau
in Zhuzihu, Yangmingshan in Taipei City's northern suburb Thursday.
</P>
<P>
After visiting the center, Zhu and his group visited
Yangmingshan's famous hot spring, checking into separate hot spring
baths at the center's guest house Thursday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
According to Zhu's companions, they entered his bath after an
hour and found him passed out in the hot spring tub. All the windows
were closed, which is against the safety regulations, according to
prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
Authorities from Taipei City Hospital, Yangming Branch said
Friday that Zhu showed no signs of life when he was rushed to the
hospital around 4:30 p.m. Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Officials from the intermediary Straits Exchange Foundation said
they have already notified Zhu's family in Beijing and have contacted
the Mainland Affairs Council and the Bureau of Immigration for
assistance to facilitate the family members' visit to Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Zhu, 50, is the highest-ranking mainland Chinese official to pass
away in Taiwan since the two rival sides began private exchanges more
than a decade ago.

CHINA PREPARING FOR NUCLEAR WAR WITH U.S. OVER TAIWAN: DISSIDENT
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Washington,  Sept.  1 (CNA)
(By Oliver Lin and P.C. Tang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Chinese dissident has warned that
China is preparing for nuclear war with the United States over Taiwan
and that a split in the Beijing leadership might lead to a conflict
in the near future, according to a report carried by the Washington
Times Thursday.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the newspaper, Wei Jinsheng, a longstanding
advocate of political reform in China, who now lives in the United
States, also said that President George W. Bush and other U.S.
leaders "do not fully understand the chance of a conflict breaking
out," urging that they "must do more to avert it. "
</P>
<P>
He also told the newspaper that he has heard from Chinese
officials, including those in the military, that they are concerned
about the growing possibility of a nuclear war.
</P>
<P>
"Recent Chinese militry exercises and a Chinese general's threat
to use missiles against U.S. cities are two signs of the danger," the
dissident further said,
</P>
<P>
Pointing out that China may have considered in the past that it
was not time for them to confront the United States, Wei said that
the Chinese now feel that they need to use these kinds of nuclear
threats. "China is very serious about that. The nuclear threat from
China is a substantial threat, not theoretical," he added.
</P>
<P>
Wei also said that the leadership in Beijing has divided into two
factions headed separately by incumbent Chinese President Hu Jintao
and former President Jiang Zemin, adding that there are elements
within the military who think that a war to retake Taiwan should
begin as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
"Politically, differences between Hu and Vice President Zeng
Qinghong, who in the past was a Jiang loyalist, appear to have been
resolve temporarily, " Wei said, adding that "the accommodation
appears related to a decision to use force in the future against
Taiwan. "
</P>
<P>
"Hu favors a conflict as a way to consolidate power over the
military. Growing nationalist sentiment in China also has led to
public calls for war over Taiwan, " he also told the newspaper,
warning that "many wars in the past have started from such
conditions."
</P>
<P>
Wei told the newspaper that in order to avert war, the Bush
administration should put more pressure on Beijing in the area of
human rights and trade as well as try to influence the Chinese
military by finding and supporting anti-war military leaders and
drive a wedge between China and the communist government in North
Korea.
</P>
<P>
"The goal should be to reduce the voice of the people who want to
go to war," the paper quoted Wei as saying.

INGRATIATING CULTURE 'NON-EXISTENT' IN ROC ARMY: PRESIDENT
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Sept.  2 (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President Chen Shui-bian claimed to the
public Friday that there is no "individual heroism" or "ingratiating
culture" in the armed forces of the Republic of China.
</P>
<P>
All members of the armed forces share the conviction of loyalty
to the country and the people, Chen said while addressing a ceremony
in which outstanding soldiers were cited on the eve of Armed Forces
Day.
</P>
<P>
The statement was an indirect response to media criticism about
the so-called "sycophant soldiers" at an air force base who
reportedly canceled leave to practice songs and dances to welcome the
president to their base. Chen later canceled a scheduled visit to the
base.
</P>
<P>
Media discussion about military culture in recent days has
"deviated from the proper understanding of the sacred mission of the
armed forces," Chen said.
</P>
<P>
In a prepared speech to be broadcast this evening, Chen reminded
the public that they should treasure what they have, which he said
has been made possible partly by the armed forces, who have dedicated
their time and energy to protecting the land.
</P>
<P>
He mentioned the importance of upgrading the nation's defensive
weapons and the importance of unity in the armed forces and the
civilian population. If the nation's military technology cannot be
upgraded and if soldiers and civilians cannot unite together, no one
can avoid the impact of a possible invasion by the Communist Chinese,
he said.
</P>
<P>
He said he was proud that the military has been successfully
"nationalized." But he urged the armed forces not to feel complacent
about their achievements. Instead, they should never stop their
efforts to seek a "quality" edge over the enemy, he said.

PRESIDENT URGES LAWMAKERS TO REVIEW ARMS PROCUREMENT BILL
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Sept. 2 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President Chen Shui-bian urged legislators
across the party spectrum Friday to review the long-stalled arms
procurement bill to demonstrate to the world Taiwan's resolve to
defend itself.
</P>
<P>
Chen made the remarks when he spoke at an Armed Forces Day
award presentation ceremony in Taipei.
</P>
<P>
In a goodwill gesture to the opposition parties, the president
also said that the government has made pragmatic adjustments to the
outlay of three items of the arms procurement package, referring to
the listing of one of them in the regular budget instead of the
originally proposed special budget.
</P>
<P>
The arms procurement bill and its budget to buy eight
diesel-electric submarines, six Patriot PAC III anti-missile
batteries and a squadron of 12 P-3C anti-submarine aircraft from the
United States have been blocked for two consecutive legislative
sessions due to opposition from the "pan-blue alliance" of the
Kuomintang and the People First Party, which holds a slim majority in
the 225-seat legislature.
</P>
<P>
The president stressed that faced with 700 missiles aimed by
China at Taiwan, the crisis of the military imbalance in the Taiwan
Strait, which has tipped toward China, should not be ignored, nor
should hopes for goodwill from the enemy or outside assistance be
entertained.
</P>
<P>
He said that fate of the nation lies in itself and that the
nation has to build up a credible defense capability to deter and
avoid war.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the United States, Japan and the other Asia-Pacific
nations have recently expressed concern about China's military
expansion, adding that several advanced weapon systems were used in a
recent joint China-Russia military exercise that had Taiwan as its
target and was also aimed at flexing its military strength to the
United States and Japan.
</P>
<P>
Chen said the military exercise validated misgivings harbored by
the international community on China's military expansion, increased
missile deployment and a strengthened missile projectile capability.
It also added variables on the developments in the Taiwan Strait
situation.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President Chen Shui-bian sent his
congratulations Friday to Yang En-dian, a physically challenged
artist who paints with her mouth and feet, over the recent birth of
her baby girl.
</P>
<P>
Chen was represented by Cho Chun-ying, a deputy director-general
of the Presidential Office's Department of Public Affairs, who
visited Yang at Mingsheng General Hospital in the southern port city
of Kaohsiung. Cho presented Yang with a specially designed baby
carrier and a "red envelope" containing money as a gift from the
president.
</P>
<P>
The baby carrier is designed so that Yang can bottle-feed her
baby with her feet.
</P>
<P>
Yang, 31, who was born without arms and was abandoned by her
parents, gave birth to a healthy baby girl Monday. Yang and her
husband, who is not physically challenged, named the infant "Chenteh"
(Joan of Arc, the Saint) , hoping that the child will grow up to
become a brave woman like the French heroine.
</P>
<P>
In March 1974, Yang was deserted outside a marketplace in
Kangshan, Kaohsiung County. The infant was brought to the Liukuei
Christian Orphanage located in the mountains of Kaohsiung County,
where under the intensive care of orphanage founder Father Yang and
his wife, the infant survived.
</P>
<P>
Believing that the baby was "sent by the Lord, " Yang named the
baby Yang En-dian, meaning "grace and benevolence from God." Little
did he know that the baby would grow up to develop a friendship with
then-President Chiang Ching-kuo that turned into another legend.
</P>
<P>
Chiang developed a special attachment to the child and arranged
for her to receive surgery in Taipei to help straighten her spine and
allow her to stand unaided. He even arranged for her to learn Chinese
brush painting and calligraphy.
</P>
<P>
The child became a celebrity after a picture of her and President
Chiang was made into a postage stamp.
</P>
<P>
Yang did not let the president down and grew up to earn her own
living by selling her works.

CHINA TRYING TO FORCE TAIWAN TO GIVE UP SOVEREIGNTY: PRESIDENT
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Sept. 2 (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
China's so-called "united front" strategy,
with which China has been threatening Taiwan militarily while trying
to divide Taiwan society, is aimed at forcing Taiwan to give up its
sovereignty, President Chen Shui-bian claimed Friday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a ceremony in which outstanding soldiers were cited,
the president urged the men and women in uniform, as well as the
general public, to beware of military and psychological threats from
across the Taiwan Strait.
</P>
<P>
He said China's enactment of its anti-secession law in March,
which expressly calls for "non-peaceful means" to solve cross-strait
disputes should Taiwan move toward independence, and a Chinese
general's threat to use nuclear arms, are clear indications of
China's attempts to use force to achieve its ultimate goal of
unifying Taiwan and China.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, the president pointed out that in order to
give an impression internationally that it is a peace-loving country,
China has spared no efforts to lure Taiwan's opposition politicians
and civic groups.
</P>
<P>
For example, China has allowed duty-free imports of Taiwan fruit
and offered a pair of pandas as gifts to the people of Taiwan. "These
are aimed at misleading the world and demoralizing Taiwan, " he
claimed.
</P>
<P>
In the face of China's maneuvering, the president called on the
military and the public to realize China's militaristic nature, which
aims to force Taiwan to abandon its sovereignty and dignity.
</P>
<P>
He said the government will counter China's strategy by
vigorously maintaining the nation's liberal democracy as well as its
sovereignty and dignity.
</P>
<P>
The government will work hard to ensure the maximum long-term
interest of the people under a framework of peace, democracy and
equality, he said.

country should "give it a few more days" to observe the situation
before implementing a price rise.
</P>
<P>
Hsieh said that any gasoline price adjustments should take all
factors into consideration, including current oil stocks, the overall
domestic economic situation, the market mechanism and the interests
of the underprivileged.
</P>
<P>
The premier made the remarks in reply to questions from reporters
about whether the state-run Chinese Petroleum Corp. (CPC) will
increase gasoline prices in the face of a recent spike in
international crude oil prices that topped US$70 a barrel a couple of
days ago and after CPC's only rival -- Formosa Petroleum -- announced
a hike of NT$2.4 per liter two days ago, although that 10-percent
hike was withdrawn several hours later.
</P>
<P>
Hsieh added that as free market forces largely determine prices,
the most the government can do is to monitor the situation closely.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Economic Affairs Minister Ho Mei-yueh said Friday that
although world crude oil prices have been volatile and the U.S.
government's offering of loaning some of its strategic stockpiled
crude is not seen to address an immediate shortage of gasoline in the
wake of Hurricane Katrina's rampage in oil-producing southern U.S.
states, whether the domestic fuel prices should be raised is an issue
to be decided by experts.
</P>
<P>
Ho would not speculate as to when or how domestic oil prices
should be hiked, saying only that "at least the CPC is not hiking the
gasoline prices today."
</P>
<P>
CPC incurred heavy losses in August when world crude oil prices
soared by 60 percent, she said.
</P>
<P>
According to the Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and
Statistics (DGBAS) , the impact of rising oil prices on economic
growth is not as great as during the second oil crisis of the 1970s,
as the ratio of crude oil consumption to gross domestic product (GDP)
has dropped by 25.3 percent since that time.
</P>
<P>
In the United States and Japan, the ratio has dropped by an even
larger margin -- 36.5 percent and 37.2 percent, respectively,
according to the DGBAS.
</P>
<P>
Liang Chi-yuan, a research fellow with Academia Sinica, Taiwan's
top research body, estimated that a 10-percent hike in oil prices
will cause a dent of 0.27 percent in Taiwan's GDP growth.

<TEXT>
<P>
The international Rotary Youth Leadership
Awards (RYLA) in Taiwan will kick off Saturday, with 250 youngsters
from more than 20 countries participating in the seven-day camp.
</P>
<P>
Brain Lai, adviser to the International RYLA in Taiwan, which was
sponsored by Rotary International District (RID) 3520, said the
primary goal of sponsoring the event is "Taiwan walks out and the
world flies in, " hoping that the youth from around the world will
learn more about Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
They will also discover the beauty of Taiwan from the
perspectives of art, culture, technology and diplomacy, while the
domestic participants can immerse themselves in the international
environment, enhance global understanding and broaden their
horizons.
</P>
<P>
The RYLA originated in Australia in 1959. It is a training
program for youths aged 20-30 aimed at emphasizing leadership,
citizenship and personal growth.
</P>
<P>
The participants have come from the United States, Canada,
Germany, Sweden, Poland, Estonia, New Zealand, Japan, South Korea,
the Philippines, Malaysia, India, Singapore, Thailand, Indonesia,
Mongolia, Hong Kong, Bolivia, Nigeria, South Africa and Taiwan.

-- the Taipei experience." Mark Daniel Maloney, trustee of the Rotary
Foundation, will also deliver a speech and Michel Lu,
director-general of the Department of Information and Cultural
Affairs of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, will share his experience
in diplomatic work.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, 2004 Sweden Daily Hero Award winner Maria Thornberg
will share her experience in social service with the participants.
Thornberg gave up a well-paid job in her early 20s to devote herself
to taking care of homeless people, drug addicts and AIDS victims.
</P>
<P>
Steven Hu, a 20-year-old man suffering from cerebral palsy who
will enter the Department of Social Work at National Taiwan
University this year, will present a speech on behalf of all
participants at the opening ceremony.

TAIWAN DONATES US$2 MILLION TO U.S. FOR HURRICANE RELIEF

<P>
Foreign Minister Tan Sun Chen donated US$2
million on behalf of the government to the United States Friday for
the relief of victims of Hurricane Katrina in the southern U.S.
states.
</P>
<P>
The minister also expressed the government's sympathies to
families of those who were killed in the hurricane.
</P>
<P>
Chen said the states of Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama and
Florida -- all devastated by Katrina -- are closely associated with
Taiwan. The state congresses of Louisiana and Mississippi have
resolved to support Taiwan's bids to join the United Nations and the
World Health Organization.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan's Formosa Plastics Group has petrochemical and plastics
factories in Louisiana, which further show the country's close ties

<P>
The minister said his office had kept a close eye on the movement
of Katrina ever since a warning was issued against it, and had helped
Taiwan expatriates in the four states to evacuate to safety.
</P>

Chen said President Chen Shui-bian has conveyed his condolences

TARIFFS ON IMPORTED VEGETABLES CUT TO RESTRAIN RISING PRICES
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei, Sept. 2 (CNA)
(By Elizabeth Hsu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ten kinds of imported vegetables were given
a 50 percent-tariff cut Friday in an effort to restrain skyrocketing
vegetable prices after Typhoon Talim rampaged through Taiwan
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The imports include scallions, cabbages, broccoli, cauliflowers,
lettuce, other leafy green vegetables, cucumbers, tomatoes, sweet
peppers and sweetcorn, officials of the Council of Agriculture (COA)
said, adding that the tariff cut will remain in place until Sept. 22.
</P>
<P>
The vegetable shipment to the Taipei wholesale market dropped to
503 tons Friday, a new post-typhoon low. Consequently, the wholesale
prices of vegetables surged to a historic high of NT$43.2 (US$1.3)
per kilogram, according to statistics from the Taipei Agricultural
Products Marketing Co.
</P>
<P>
By cutting the tariff on the imported vegetables from 20 percent
to 10 percent, the COA hopes there will be enough imports to allow
reasonable prices to be maintained, the officials said.

TAIWAN'S GROPER FARMERS SAY FISH ARE SAFE AFTER HK SUSPENDS SALES
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Kaohsiung, Sept. 2 (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Fish farmers who raise gropers in Yungan
town in Kaohsiung County said Friday that health officials regularly
monitor their fish and claimed that their gropers are safe, in spite
of Hong Kong officials having found a carcinogen in a sample exported
from Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
The farmers, who raise 8,000 tons of the fish each year in 350
hectares of ponds, made the claim after hearing that Hong Kong had
found malachite green, a carcinogen, in a sample from a spotted black
groper imported from Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong's fishery businesses have suspended the sale of this
kind of fish. However, a Taiwan official based in Hong Kong has
questioned the method used by Hong Kong authorities to come to level
such a "serious accusation."
</P>
<P>
The official demanded that Hong Kong's health authorities offer
more details about the report, which was widely carried by the media
and could cause much damage not only to Taiwan's fish farmers but
also to Taiwan's international image.
</P>
<P>
A Hong Kong official in charge of food safety said he has asked
Taiwan authorities to provide data concerning Taiwan's fish exports
to Hong Kong and if necessary, he will send experts to Taiwan to see
how Taiwan farmers raise their fish.
</P>
<P>
Malachite green is a triphenylmethane basic dye that is also used
in medicine as an antiseptic. Su You-chia, a Yungan fish farmer, said
six or seven years ago some local farmers did use malachite to keep
their fish from contracting "white spot disease."
</P>
<P>
Because malachite is a potent compound, it was banned by the
county government, Su said. He added that officials inspect local
fish farms every Monday, Wednesday and Friday.
</P>
<P>
The officials did not just try to prevent fish farmers from using
malachite, but also helped them use a legal compound called copper
acetate to replace malachite. Residue of copper acetate remains in
the fish for only three days.
</P>
<P>
Su's statements were confirmed by health official Ko Shang-yu,
who said Taiwan's fish exporters learned a lesson last year when some
of their products were returned after European Union officials found
residue of antibiotics in fish from Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Ko said Taiwan exporters have since asked professionals to check
their fish exports before shipping them abroad.
</P>
<P>
Su urged the government to help find out which farm in Taiwan has
exported the alleged unsafe gropers to Hong Kong and publish all
information in this regard so that the interests of other fish
farmers will not be affected.
</P>
<P>
In Taipei, the Council of Agriculture said it has requested Hong
Kong to provide data to facilitate investigation by Taiwan officials.
</P>
<P>
Hsieh Wen-ta, the director of the Fisheries Administration of the
agriculture council, urged Taiwan fish farmers not to break the law
as the government has long banned the use of malachite.
</P>
<P>
The agriculture council is calling a meeting of fish farmers in
Pingtung, near Kaohsiung, Saturday to discuss the issue. If anyone is
found to have used the banned drug, that person will be charged,
Hsieh said.

DEFENSE MINISTRY DENIES FRIGATE LOST TOUCH WITH CHEN ON TUNGSHA VISIT
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Sept.  2 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Ministry of National Defense brushed
aside media reports Friday that suggested that a frigate in charge of
escorting President Chen Shui-bian when he visited the Tungsha
(Pratas) Islands in late July had lost contact with the president's
minders for three minutes.
</P>
<P>
Real Admiral Fan Pao-hu made the remarks in response to media
reports that when President Chen flew to Tungsha to declare
sovereignty over the islands, a satellite communication system on
an ROC Navy "Kangting" (Lafayette-class) frigate that was on an
escort mission went down, leaving the president unsupervised for
three minutes.
</P>
<P>
Fan said that the ROC Navy has various communication channels and
even though one channel did go down, there was no "losing touch" with
the president.
</P>
<P>
He said that weather and other special factors can sometimes
affect communications, but that the frigate was always in contact
with the president's minders throughout his trip.
</P>
<P>
Defense ministry officials said that the problem could have been
triggered by the frigate changing position at high speed and that no
human negligence was involved. For this reason, the defense ministry
is not considering any disciplinary action.
</P>
<P>
The Pratas Islands comprise Tungsha Island and two coral reefs,
North Vereker Bank and South Vereker Bank. The archipelago is located
in a strategically important position along the major sea route
connecting the Pacific and Indian oceans.
</P>
<P>
The group is 140 nautical miles south of Swatow in Guangdong
province, 400 nautical miles northwest of Manila, 170 miles southeast
of Hong Kong, and 240 nautical miles southwest of Kaohsiung.
</P>
<P>
Tungsha Island is a coral atoll with a land area of 2.4 sq. km.
Shaped like a horseshoe, it extends 0.9 km from east to west, and 2.7
km from north to south. On June 30, 1989, the Republic of China
government set up a national monument on Tungsha Island to assert its
sovereignty over the archipelago.
</P>
<P>
The areas around Tungsha provide excellent fishing grounds, and
ROC fishermen visit the region during March and April. In addition to
being a source of salt, fish, and minerals, the islands are an
outpost for the ROC Navy in the South China Sea. A hospital, power
station, satellite tracking station, and runway have been built
there.

The Cabinet-level Mainland Affairs Council

four Taiwan carriers to fly over its airspace.
</P>
<P>
MAC Vice Chairman You Ying-lung made the remarks after the Civil

PUT ASIDE POLITICAL DIFFERENCES TO PROTECT TAIWAN: PRESIDENT CHEN
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President Chen Shui-bian called on the
nation's ruling and opposition parties Friday to face the reality of
the growing military imbalance across the Taiwan Strait, reminding
them that "time is not on the side of Taiwan."
</P>
<P>
On the eve of Armed Forces Day, Chen appealed to the political
parties to "rationally and pragmatically" deal with a government
request to pass a special budget bill for buying key weapons to boost
the nation's defense capabilities.
</P>
<P>
"While our efforts to defend ourselves are impeded by domestic
politics, China is continuing to modernize its armed forces," he said
in a TV speech, referring to ruling-opposition fighting on almost
every front that has kept the budget bill to buy three military items
from being put on the legislative agenda.
</P>
<P>
Now that the government has shown its utmost flexibility to move
the budget for buying Patriot III anti-missile batteries to the
regular budget, and the main opposition Kuomintang has sworn in a new
chairman, Chen said it is time for all opponents to give up their
selfish political calculations and work together to usher in a new
era of Taiwan politics.
</P>
<P>
If a conflict erupts in the Taiwan Strait, not only must Taiwan
worry about a growing military imbalance with China, it must also
worry about the possibility of international intervention coming too
late, the president said.
</P>
<P>
Some analysts have pointed out that the U.S. is eager to help
Taiwan acquire anti-missile and anti-submarine weapons and submarines
so that the island will be able to resist China's first strike long
enough for the U.S. and its allies to rush to Taiwan's rescue.
</P>
<P>
Chen said, as Taiwan's top leader, he cannot think about Taiwan's
overall security from his personal or partisan perspective, so how to
cope with China's military threat is an issue that should not be
"over- politicized."
</P>
<P>
The president also talked about the need to implement an
"all-citizens defense program" to counter China's "asymmetrical
warfare" strategy. The national defense program will integrate Taiwan
into a global defense system, he said.

<P>
An official of the Mainland Affairs Council
(MAC) confirmed a newspaper report Friday that the Ministry of
Education has refused to accredit an elementary school in Shanghai
for children of Taiwanese working there.
</P>
<P>
MAC spokesman You Ying-lung said the Shanghai Taiwanese
Compatriots School failed to meet the education ministry's
requirements for accreditation -- the principal was too old at 65,
its founder applied for accreditation with outdated documents, it
failed to present a detailed description of its teaching programs,
and it didn't hire enough Taiwanese teachers.
</P>
<P>
Using the term "Taiwanese compatriots" also falls outside the
government's regulations.
</P>
<P>
The China Times newspaper said "Taiwanese compatriots" was coined
by China and is considered derogatory by Taiwan authorities, who
prefer the term "Taiwan businessmen."
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted Liu Liao-ping, the assistant principal of the
school, as saying in Shanghai the previous day that the school's
founder was trying to convince Taiwan authorities that its name
carries no political overtones and he is also asking for Chinese
permission to replace the word "compatriots" with "businessmen."
</P>
<P>
The school, which opened Thursday, has already attracted 120
pupils from Taiwanese families in Shanghai, according to the China
Times.

CREWMEN ABOARD THREE HIJACKED TAIWAN FISHING BOATS ARE SAFE

<TEXT>
<P>
All crew members aboard the three Taiwan
fishing vessels that are being held by a Somalian rebel militia for a
ransom of US$1.5 million are safe as of Friday, a senior Ministry of
Foreign Affairs (MOFA) official said.
</P>
<P>
MOFA spokesman Michel Lu said the government has given top
priority to rescuing the crewmen that include three Taiwanese
skippers as well as sailors and fishery workers from China, Vietnam,
Indonesia and the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
According to Lu, the nation's diplomatic staff stationed in
Africa are trying to make contact with Somalian rebel militia leaders
by seeking the assistance of major international organizations.
</P>
<P>
Lu said officials from MOFA, the Mainland Affairs Council and the
Fisheries Administration are working together to find out more about
the situation and flesh out a rescue plan.
</P>
<P>
The shipowners are also struggling to raise the ransom, Lu said.
</P>
<P>
The three fishing boats -- the Kaohsiung-based "Chungyi No. 218"
and the Hsiaoliuchiu-based "Hsinlienfa No. 36" and the
"Chengchingfeng" -- have not been in contact since they entered a
Somalian fishing port Aug. 16 for refueling and maintenance.
</P>

The shipowners later came to learn that the three ships had been
hijacked by Somalian insurgents and appealed to MOFA Aug. 24 for
assistance, Lu said, adding that the three ships entered the Somalian
port through the arrangement of their Malaysian shipping agent.
</P>
<P>
There are about 20 crewmen aboard each of the 95-ton ships, Lu
said, adding that altogether, there are 13 Chinese crewmen, 14
Indonesians, 12 Filipinos and four Vietnamese. The only Taiwanese are
skippers and several senior officers.

<P>
Somalia was plunged into anarchy after strongman Mohamed Siad
Barre was ousted in 1991 and the East African country has
disintegrated into a patchwork of fiefdoms run by unruly warlords and
clan militia chiefs.
</P>
<P>
Officials from the Fisheries Administration said the agency has
posted warnings for fishing regions that are similar to the travel
advisories issued by MOFA, advising fishermen where it is dangerous
to fish. Somalia, which borders the Indian Ocean, has long been
listed as a dangerous fishing area, the officials said.

BEIJING CONDEMNED FOR REFUSING TO HOST GROUP OF ASIAN CITIES MEETING
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Tokyo, Sept. 2 (CNA)
(By Mike Chang and Maubo Chang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Beijing reneged Friday on its designation to
host the upcoming meeting of an organization of Asian capital cites,
and the group's founder is upset with the break in international
protocol.
</P>
<P>
Tokyo Governor Shintaro Ishihara, who is the founder of the Asian
Network of Major Cities 21 (ANMC), told a news conference that
Beijing's decision flies in the face of all international rules, and
he will consult other ANMC members, including Taipei, about which
cities should replace Beijing to host to this year's autumn meeting.
</P>
<P>
The disputes stems from an ANMC decision in its 2004 meeting in
Jakarta which gave hosting the 2005 meeting to Beijing and Taipei the
hosting for the 2006 meeting after both of them contended for the
chance to host the 2005 meeting but neither could get the support of
two-thirds of the member cities as required by the group's charter.
</P>
<P>
The Beijing delegation, which won seven votes against four for
Taipei, disagreed with the compromise and refused to sign a comunique
to that effect at the time.
</P>
<P>
Beijing caught the ANMC off guard by declaring its withdrawal in
an Aug. 30 note and left the organization in chaos about which city
should host this year's meeting.
</P>
<P>
The ANMC has 12 members: Beijing, Tokyo, Taipei, Seoul, Manila,
Bangkok, Hanoi, Yangon, Singapore, Kuala Lumpur, Jakarta and Delhi.

Manila Bulletin: GMA appeals to both allies
and foes for national unity

President Arroyo yesterday appealed to the nation
to end destructive political warfare and, for national
unity, to save the Philippines from a potential
"economic dislocation" after world oil prices soared
to their highest level in history.

The Philippine Daily Inquirer: 3 bishops got up to P4M from
Pagcor

THE PRICKLY issue of gambling money and the Church

prominent bishops are receiving "donations" ranging
from P500,000 to P4 million from the Philippine

The Supreme Court refused yesterday to grant a

The Manila Times: 15 more impeach backers withdraw

FIFTEEN administration congressmen who have signed

TIMBETABLE SHOULDN'T BE SET ON CROSS-STRAIT AFFAIRS: DPP
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Sept.  3 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taiwan should not set a timetable on
cross-strait affairs lest the island lose bargaining chips in its
dealings with China, a spokesman of the ruling Democratic Progressive
Party (DPP) said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Cheng Wen-tsang, director of the DPP's Department of Culture and
Information, made the remarks after Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Ma
Ying-jeou said in a television interview a day earlier that he will
push for the implementation of direct cross-strait trade and
transportation links within two years if his party wins the 2008
presidential election.
</P>
<P>
Cheng criticized the remarks as demonstrating Ma's "lack of
thorough consideration, " which the DPP spokesman said demonstrates
that Ma is "incapable of handling cross-strait issues."
</P>
<P>
Cheng noted that the KMT tried in the past to add a clause for
accelerating the implementation of direct cross-strait transportation
to the revised Statute Governing the Relations Between the People of
the Taiwan Area and the Mainland Area but that the party eventually
gave up because of the people's opposition.
</P>
<P>
The DPP spokesman said that setting a timetable for issues
involving cross-strait exchanges would be a "self-confining approach"
that would undermine Taiwan's bargaining position in negotiations
with China.
</P>
<P>
He added that not setting a timetable will give Taiwan maximum
flexibility and maneuvering room.
</P>
<P>
Cheng also pointed out that the levels of freedom of speech,
religion and assembly in China are still lagging far behind those of
many other countries.
</P>
<P>
He said Ma's affirmation that China is moving in the direction of
freedom and democracy is "overly optimistic, " suggesting that Ma
stress Taiwan's democratic values and work with other countries in
the world to prod China to move toward democracy.

<P>
The governor of the Abruzzo Province in Italy
expressed Friday his wish to further strengthen relations between
Abruzzo and Taiwan in a wide range of fields, including trade,
economy and culture, and to boost mutual understanding and friendship
between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
Octtaviano del Turco made the remarks while meeting with visiting
Republic of China Representative to Italy Lin Ki-tseng at his office.
</P>
<P>
Lin invited del Turco to visit Taiwan after the governor revealed
that he has very much been interested in visiting Taiwan since his
sister told him about her good impressions of Taiwan and the island's
development after returning from her trip there in 1991.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, del Turco proposed visiting exchanges between
Abruzzese and Taiwanese industrial and commercial groups to boost
mutual understanding and cooperation. He described Abruzzo, located
in central Italy, as a region with abundant natural resources and
many international high-tech operations, including those set up by
South Korea-based Samsung Electronics.
</P>
<P>
Del Turco also expressed his welcome for the ROC's liaison office
in Italy to hold a photograph exhibition featuring Taiwan's landscape
in L'Aquila, the capital city of the province, Sept. 22-Oct. 31.
</P>
<P>
A total of 65 photos featuring natural and urban landscapes,
tourist spots, cultural and folk festivals, as well as art activities
in Taiwan will be on display in the exhibition to be held at the
national Abruzzo Museum. Del Turco has promised to attend the opening
of the show slated for Sept. 22.

Del Turco had served as a senator for two terms before being

U.S., JAPAN SHOULD JOINTLY ENSURE SECURITY IN TAIWAN STRAIT: PREMIER
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Premier Frank Hsieh said in an interview
with a major Japanese daily that he is concerned about China's
military buildup and that it is necessary for the United States and
Japan to jointly ensure security in the Taiwan Strait.
</P>
<P>
The Asahi Shimbun on Saturday ran the interview which was
conducted in Taipei the previous day.
</P>
<P>
The premier said that he welcomes U.S. and Japanese officials
listing the peaceful resolution of the Taiwan issue as a common
strategic objective in a Security Consultative Committee meeting in
Washington D.C. in late February this year.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait not
only relates to the two countries, but is also linked closely to
peace and stability in the Asia-Pacific region, adding that it is
only natural that the two countries are concerned about the stability
in the Taiwan Strait.
</P>
<P>
The premier said he is deeply concerned about China's recent
military buildup, pointing out that the buildup has exceeded what is
warranted to deter Taiwan from moving toward independence. China is a
country moving toward hegemony, he added.
</P>
<P>
On the cross-strait military balance, Hsieh said that Taiwan
currently enjoys an edge. But he added that if the arms procurement
package to buy crucial weapons from the Untied States doesn't clear
the Legislative Yuan, then the military balance will tip in China's
favor by 2012.
</P>
<P>
The premier also said that Taiwan will further promote direct
cross-strait chartered flights, implemented for this past Chinese New
Year holiday, and engage in consultations on chartered cross-strait
cargo and passenger flights.
</P>
<P>
After reaching agreement with China on the chartered flights,
Taiwan will open to Chinese tourists and will exchange views with
China on cooperation in cracking down on cross-strait crime, Hsieh
said.
</P>
<P>
He also said that to maintain peace and the status quo in the
Taiwan Strait, Taiwan will adopt a flexible attitude, adding however
that until China becomes a democratic and pluralistic country, he
does not trust China's "peaceful rise."

THAILAND TO SEND 2 LAWYERS TO ASSIST LABORERS INVOLVED IN RIOT

<P>
Thailand has decided to send two
senior lawyers to Taiwan to help Thai laborers who could face
prosecution for their roles in a recent riot in Kaohsiung, southern
Taiwan, the Thai government announced Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Lawyers Uthai Artiwet and Sasin Sukjaras, both of whom work for
an international human rights protection organization, as well as
Nualpan Mahakun, executive director of the Thailand Trade and
Economic Office in Taipei, will head to Kaohsiung to help Thai
laborers during Taiwan authorities' investigations into the riot. The
two experienced lawyers will offer free legal counsel and defend in
court any of the laborers who are formally charged.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan law enforcement authorities have focused on 16 Thai
laborers involved in the riot, stressing that if they come forward,
they will be given lenient treatment, and that if they wait until
they are summoned, they will be dealt with according to normal
procedures. So far, none of the Thai laborers have come forward.
</P>
<P>
Thai laborers working for the Kaohsiung Rapid Transit Corp.
(KRTC) rioted Aug. 21 to vent their anger about unreasonable
management and poor living conditions, hurling rocks at police as
well as damaging dormitories and burning vehicles.
</P>
<P>
The riot brought to light the poor conditions under which the
Thai laborers work, and both countries have started a probe into the
matter.

HUMAN RIGHTS TASK FORCE FOR FOREIGN LABORERS FORMED: VICE PRESIDENT
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Sept.  3  (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Vice President Annette Lu announced
Saturday the inauguration of a task force to look into the human
rights situation of foreign laborers in Taiwan and a legal team to
provide free legal assistance to any laborers charged for their
involvement in the Aug. 21 riot at a Kaohsiung MRT construction
site.
</P>
<P>
The vice president, who concurrently serves as the chairwoman of
a human rights advisory commission under the Presidential Office,
made the announcement in a press conference held at the Presidential
Office.
</P>
<P>
Lu noted that the recent riot by Thai laborers working for
Kaohsiung Rapid Transit Corp. to protest against what they perceived
as harsh treatment form the management and poor living conditions "is
a crisis that has turned into an opportunity to redress the 
the matter properly."
</P>
<P>
The government does not condone poor treatment of foreign
laborers and will carry out an overall review to demonstrate that
Taiwan is a model human rights-based country, she further said.
</P>
<P>
Lu said that the legal team will help Thai laborers who face
prosecution, providing them with human rights protection and legal
counsel. On the choice of translators for the legal team, Lu said the
views of the Thailand Trade and Economic Office in Taipei will be
respected by the government.
</P>
<P>
She said that the task force and the legal team have taken into
consideration the notions that "human rights are borderless" and that
"sovereignty will be upheld through rule of law."
</P>
<P>
The task force and legal team will help underscore that Taiwan is
a country based on human rights and that it respects international
conventions on labor, although foreign as well as Taiwanese nationals
will have to abide by Taiwan law while here, Lu said.
</P>
<P>
On the 10-member task force formed by Thailand to look into the

PANEL CONCLUDES MAKESHIFT BRIDGE NOT BUILT TO 'TOADY' TO PRESIDENT
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Sept.  3 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A panel of experts commissioned by the
Executive Yuan to probe allegations that a makeshift bridge leading
to a Hsueshang Tunnel construction site was built simply to "toady"
to President Chen Shui-bian has concluded that the allegations were
false.
</P>
<P>
Yang Yung-pin, a professor of civil engineer at National Taiwan
University and chairman of the eight-member panel, said the
investigation revealed that the iron bridge, built at a cost of
NT$1.5 million (US$46,175), is a necessary part of the ongoing tunnel
construction project.
</P>
<P>
He added that the makeshift bridge's completion on the eve of the
president's scheduled inspection tour of the construction site Aug.
27 was simply a coincidence.
</P>
<P>
Tsai Jong-geng, president of the Taiwan Society of Professional
Structure Engineer and a member of the panel, said that
it is possible that construction workers completed the bridge a few
days early in order to accommodate the president's visit, but he
stressed that the bridge was not built simply for the purpose of
pleasing the president and that it is a vital part of the ongoing
construction project.
</P>
<P>
The panel said they gave the makeshift bridge a rating of 0.7 on
a scale of 0 to 1 in terms of necessity, with 0 representing
"completely unnecessary" and 1 representing "absolutely necessary."

GOV'T PUSHING TO SET UP HIGH-LEVEL DIALOGUE MECHANISM WITH U.S., JAPAN
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,   Sept.  3  (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The government is pushing for the
establishment of a regular high-level communication and dialogue
mechanism with the United States and Japan, President Chen
Shui-bian's chief of staff revealed Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Yu Shyi-kun, secretary-general to the Presidential Office, who
made the remarks in an exclusive interview with CNA, added that the
establishment of this mechanism "has not yet ripened."
</P>
<P>
In the interview, Yu also touched on the government's promotion
of second-phase constitutional reforms, as well as the positive
development of Taiwan-U.S. relations.
</P>
<P>
Yu pointed out that China's rise and military expansion in recent
years, as well as its enactment of an Anti-Secession Law targeting
Taiwan on March 14 and its recent joint military exercise with Russia
have raised concerns among countries around the world. These
developments have not only affected U.S. global strategic deployment,
they have also impacted the interests of the United States and Japan
in the Asia-Pacific region, he said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that U.S. and Japanese officials listed the peaceful
resolution of the Taiwan issue as a common strategic objective in a
Security Consultative Committee meeting in Washington, D.C. in late
February this year.
</P>
<P>
He said that a new international situation and China's military
threat have helped deepen Taiwan-Japan and Taiwan-U.S. relations and
move them toward positive development.
</P>
<P>
The government is promoting a regular high-level communication
mechanism with the United States and Japan, Yu said, adding that
there is a regular security consultative committee meeting between
Washington and Tokyo which serves as a communication platform, and
that the United States is bound by the Taiwan Relations Act to
provide Taiwan with sufficient weapons to defend itself.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan and Japan have had close exchanges, but a common
communication platform is lacking between Taiwan, the United States
and Japan, he continued.
</P>
<P>
Yu is scheduled to travel to Japan Monday to attend the
Taiwan-Japan Forum set for Sept. 6-7. Although it is an unofficial
dialogue mechanism between the two countries, it will help boost
bilateral relations to a "para-alliance level" in the sense of the
two countries' common values of democracy, freedom and peace, and is
therefore significant in this regard, he said.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In order to drive home to people the
necessity of President Chen Shui-bian's second phase constitutional
reform, the government will stage at least 10,000 seminars around the
island to spread the president's idea, Yu Shyi-kun, secretary-general
of the Presidential Office said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the CNA, Yu said President Chen himself
would preside over some of the seminars to be staged from September
at each of the country's 8,000-odds villages and boroughs.
</P>
<P>
The seminars will consist of speeches, debates and
opinion-exchanges with the purpose of building public consensus on
issues of national concerns.
</P>
<P>
During the reform, Yu said, the opinion of the grassroots, rather
than the leaders, will be respected, the Constitution will be
thorough revamped and all unrealistic provisions in it will be picked
out and reviewed.
</P>
<P>
The reform will also bring the country's Constitution in line
with that of the advanced countries in terms of the protection of
human rights, liberty and others.
</P>
<P>
The revised constitution will be put to a referendum in
conjunction with either the 2007 lawmaker elections or the 2008
presidential election, Yu said.

NEGOTIATIONS WITH SOMALI REBELS MAKING PROGRESS: MOFA
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Sept. 4 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) is
making every possible effort to rescue the crew of three Taiwan tuna
boats that were seized by Somali rebels in August, MOFA spokesman
Michel Lu said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
According to the latest information obtained by the Foreign
Ministry, Lu said, negotiations with the Somalian rebels -- who have
demanded US$500,000 for the release of each ship and its crew -- have
made some progress over the last two days and the ministry will heed
all possible variables and respond to them quickly.
</P>
<P>
Maintaining the safety of the 48 crewmen is the top priority
of the rescue efforts, Lu said.

</P>
<P>
He noted that Taiwan has asked for international assistance in
contacting the Somalian gunmen and began talking to them Friday.
</P>
<P>
The MOFA has made emergency contact with the Kuala Lumpur-based
Piracy Reporting Center under the International Maritime Bureau for
help in rescuing the crews. The ships had three Taiwanese captains
and 45 international crew members, including 14 Indonesians, 13
Chinese, 12 Filipinos and six Vietnamese.
</P>
<P>
The Foreign Ministry has also contacted other international human
rights organizations and the governments of the United States,
Britain, various European countries, Saudi Arabia and South Africa to
ask for help, Lu added.
</P>
<P>
He said the ministry hopes the rebels, who seized the trawlers at
the port of Kismayo Aug. 16, will release the boats and their crews
unconditionally. But if the pirates continue to demand US$500,000 for
the release of each ship and its crew as news reports have said, the
MOFA hopes the rebels will be asked through international mediation
bodies to lower the ransoms, Lu added.
</P>
<P>
The Somalian gunmen had threatened to start killing one hostage a
day if the ransom was not paid within 48 hours, but so far, the crew
members have not been badly harmed, according to Lu.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Lu and Lee Chen-hsiung, director-general of the MOFA
Department of African Affairs, traveled to Tungkang, Pingtung and
Hsiaoliuchiu in southern Taiwan, to meet the families of the three
captains Sunday to convey the concern expressed by President Chen
Shui-bian, Premier Frank Hsieh and Foreign Affairs Minister Tan Sun
Chen over the incident.
</P>
<P>
Chen directed a day earlier that relevant government agencies
should try their utmost to facilitate the rescue of the boats and
their crews after meeting with Chuang Chi-yi, owner of Chungyi No.

PREMIER BACKPEDALS ON CHALLENGE TO OPPOSITION TO TOPPLE CABINET
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei, Sept. 4 (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Premier Frank Hsieh said Sunday he had been
"a bit emotional" when he challenged the opposition parties to topple
his Cabinet Saturday because the legislature would not meet to
discuss his proposal to use NT$80 billion over the next eight years
to fight floods.
</P>
<P>
Hsieh said some officials told him they do not know what to do
with a "domineering" Legislative Yuan whose president has a different
view from the chairman of the largest opposition party, the
Kuomintang (KMT).
</P>
<P>
Legislative Yuan President Wang Jin-pyng, a KMT member,
criticized the government for trying to buy votes with the special
anti-flood budget, while KMT Chairman Ma ying-jeou claimed the budget
had not been well planned. "These are two contradictory views, "
according to Hsieh.
</P>
<P>
Hsieh said he would accept a decision by the legislature with
regard to the flood-control budget, just as he accepted a cut in the
premier's special spending allowance to NT$240,000 per month, less
than the NT$340,000 for the mayors of Taipei and Kaoshiung.
</P>
<P>
He said the legislature can cast a no-confidence vote on him on
the grounds that his special budget request is not good for the
country, the result of which he will accept.
</P>
<P>
Given that the total budget has not been increased despite an
increase in the defense budget, Hsieh said it is reasonable for his
Cabinet to propose a NT$10-billion-per-year budget for flood control
projects.
</P>
<P>
In the past, flood control projects have failed because they were
not financed by special budgets, he said, claiming that the Keelung
River flood control project was successful precisely because it was
funded by a special budget.

An official of the Taiwan Economic

students studying at universities in the Hurricane Katrina-affected
area have still not made contact with their families.
</P>
<P>
The official said the office has written to the governor's office
of the state of Louisiana, which is in charge of matters related to
the relief of victims of the disaster, to request help in the search
for the two students.
</P>
<P>
He also called for other Taiwanese students in the
hurricane-affected area to make contact with their families as soon
as possible, adding that students who have been unable to make
international calls to their families in Taiwan can contact him
through his mobile phone: 713-504-6060 or his office: 713-871-0851.
</P>

TZU CHI LAUNCHES RELIEF EFFORT FOR HURRICANE-AFFECTED VICTIMS
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Los  Angeles,  Sept.  3 (CNA)
(By Chu Lu-sheng and Deborah Kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The U.S. operations of Taiwan's
largest private charity organization, the Buddhist Compassionate
Relief Tzu Chi Foundation, launched an America-wide aid campaign
Saturday aimed at speeding physical and psychological help to the
victims of Hurricane Katrina in three southern U.S.
states.
</P>
<P>
From Saturday, Tzu Chi volunteers from across America began to
solicit donations on the streets to help with the relief for victims
in the states of Louisiana, Mississippi and Alabama, where Hurricane
Katrina wreaked havoc on cities, particularly New Orleans, with
strong winds and flooding that have left at least 1,000 people dead
and incalculable damage.
</P>
<P>
According to Ke Cho-yan, a Los Angeles Tzu Chi representative,
the foundation has activated a US$4 million emergency aid fund to
finance the establishment of makeshift medical service stations in
the three affected states. The fund is also being used to finance the
distribution of US$100 token coupons with which the recipients can
buy daily necessities.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Tzu Chi Texas operation has established a relief
center, dispatching volunteers to Houston and Dallas to provide free
medical treatment or psychological counseling to thousands of flood
victims who were bussed from New Orleans to the Texan cities for
temporary settlement.
</P>
<P>
Tzu Chi officials also welcome people from around the world to
mail donations, via personal checks, to the Tzu Chi L.A. operation to
beef up the Katrina relief effort. The operation's address is:
1100, S. Valley Center Ave, San Dimas, CA 91773.

FIRST LONDON "TAIWAN FESTIVAL" TO BE HELD
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
London,  Sept. 3 (CNA)
(By Jennifer Huang and P.C. Tang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taiwan's top envoy in London said Saturday
that his office will hold a two-day "Taiwan festival" Sept. 10-11 at
Brent Cross, the biggest shopping mall in the north of London, to
introduce the country's art and culture.
</P>
<P>
Edgar Lin, Taiwan's representative to the United Kingdom, said in
an interview with the Central News Agency that the festival, which he
believes is the first to be held in London, is aimed at showing the
differences between Taiwan and China in the fields of art and
cultural performance, as well as clarifying the concept of "China is
China, Taiwan is Taiwan."
</P>
<P>
Pointing out that in the past, Taiwan's art and cultural
performances have always been given in London as part of the
activities in the "Chinese festival" organized by the Chinese Embassy
and the municipality of London, Lin said the arrangements, which
"treat the island as part of China," goes against the truth.
</P>
<P>
He further said the arrangements have also failed to help Taiwan
introduce the unique features of its culture to the people of London.
</P>
<P>
According to the Taiwan Representative Office in London,
performances including puppet shows, paper-cutting and calligraphy
demonstrations will be given during the festival by a puppet group
headed by Chen Hsi-huang, son of renowned Taiwanese puppet master Lee
Tian-lu, and local Taiwan expatriates.

PFP TO REJECT PRESIDENT'S 2ND PHASE OF CONSTITUTIONAL REFORMS
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Sept.  4  (CNA)
(By Han Nai-kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The People First Party (PFP) , the
second-largest opposition party in the legislature, indicated Sunday
that it will not be party to the second phase of President Chen
Shui-bian's constitutional reforms, but will concentrate on issues
affecting the people's livelihoods after the new legislative session
opens Sept. 13.
</P>
<P>
Reacting to news reports that Chen plans to hold 10,000
discussion sessions across Taiwan from mid-September to elicit
grassroots support for his constitutional reform plan, Huang
Yi-chiao, the PFP legislative caucus convener, alleged that the
ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) is "indifferent to the
people's suffering" and knows only the gimmicks of manipulating the
constitutional reform topics.
</P>
<P>
Huang said the PFP will not be party to what he described as
Chen's "game," but will concentrate on helping the people resolve the
problems that most affect their livelihoods.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that Taiwan is experiencing an economic slowdown,
which makes the living conditions harsher for the people. In
addition, he claimed, there are burning issues like deteriorating
social order, corruption of government officials and increasing
transfers of benefits due to collusion between business and the
government.
</P>
<P>
"Can't President Chen see all these problems? " Huang asked,
adding that he is surprised that Chen is constantly mindful of the
second phase of constitutional reforms before those more serious
problems are resolved.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the CNA Saturday, Yu Shyi-kun, chief of
general staff to the president, said the DPP will push the
second-phase constitutional reforms from mid-September by holding a
total of 10,000 discussion sessions around the nation.
</P>
<P>
In June, the president declared that he will form a
constitutional reform committee and allow the public to be fully
engaged in the constitutional reform discussion.
</P>
<P>
The second phase of constitutional reforms, according to Chen's
plan, will involve such issues as whether the nation should have a
three-branch or five-branch separation of power; whether to adopt a
presidential or parliamentary system of government; reform of the
legislature; whether to suspend or abolish the provincial government;
lowering of the minimum voting age; modification of compulsory
military service requirements; human rights and labor rights
protection; and the inclusion of a special chapter on the well-being
of aboriginal citizens in the Constitution.

PFP CHIEF TO RETURN TO TAIWAN MONDAY

<DATELINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Opposition People First Party (PFP)
Chairman James Soong, who left Taiwan before the Kuomintang (KMT)
chairman election on July 16, will return to Taiwan Monday, PFP
spokesman Huang Yi-chiao said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Upon Soong's return the media will be watching how he will
interact with the KMT's new chairman, Ma Ying-jeou, and how he will
handle his party's co-sponsorship with the Communist Party of China
of a so-called "elite forum" in mid-September in Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
Another topic that the media will be paying attention to is how
Soong will tackle his party's nominations for the year-end city and
county elections, as well as PFP-KMT coordination in this regard.
</P>
<P>
Huang said he does not see any urgency for Soong to meet with Ma,
as inter-party coordination has been going on in his absence.
</P>
<P>
He denied as a groundless rumor that "an all-out war between the
PFP and the KMT will erupt" after Soong comes back to Taiwan, noting
that the two parties have been working together well to "guard the
interests of the people" at the Legislative Yuan.
</P>
<P>
Chang Shien-yao, director of the PFP Policy Research Center, said
Soong will call on former KMT Chairman Lien Chan, discuss with Ma the
year-end elections and the government's special budget proposal for
arms purchases, and exchange views with Legislative Yuan President
Wang Jin-pyng on the arms purchase.
</P>
<P>
Other sources said Soong's priority will be stumping for PFP
candidates in the city and county elections.
</P>
<P>
Soong was re-elected as PFP leader uncontested while he was
abroad, which some observers claimed was an indication he was not
keen on being elected for another term, particularly after a number
of PFP lawmakers had questioned his policy directions.

Taiwan's small- and medium-sized
enterprises that suffered losses from Typhoon Talim may speed up
their recovery by applying for low-interest loans from a development
fund, a spokesman for the Small and Medium Enterprise Administration
under the Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said those companies that suffered damage from
Typhoon Talim last week are qualified to apply for loans at a
favorable interest rate of 3.345 percent, provided they can produce
documents from local government authorities certifying their losses.
</P>
<P>
If a company cannot put up sufficient guarantees for a loan, its
application may be referred to another fund that provides credit
guarantees for such enterprises, he said.

INTERMENT OF LATE PRESIDENTS WILL TAKE PLACE AS SCHEDULED
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Sept.  4 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The interment of the embalmed bodies of
the late President Chiang Kai-shek and his son and successor Chiang
Ching-kuo is expected to take place in March or April next year as
scheduled, even though construction of their burial plots has lagged
due to bad weather, a Ministry of National Defense (MND) official
said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Although construction of the Chiangs' tombs, located at the
Wutzushan military cemetery in Hsichih, Taipei County, has been
interrupted by torrential rain and thick fog, the project will be
completed in accordance with the terms of the contract, said Gen. Tai
Po-te, commander of the MND Allied Logistics Command.
</P>
<P>
Tai confirmed a statement from the MND Bureau of Armaments and
Acquisition -- the builder of the tombs -- that construction began in
early March this year and will be ready as scheduled without any
shortcuts in quality and design.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, according to Tai, the affairs regarding the relocation
of the two Chiangs -- who have been embalmed in interim mausoleums in
Taoyuan, northern Taiwan -- to the Wutzushan military cemetery for
permanent interment will be in the charge of the Ministry of the
Interior in line with the State Funeral Law.
</P>
<P>
As to the management of the tombs, Tai said, this will be
transferred from the MND to the Vocational Assistance Commission for
Retired Servicemen under the Executive Yuan.
</P>
<P>
Chiang Kai-shek fled to Taiwan in 1949 after losing China to the
Mao Zedong-led communist party in a bloody civil war. He died in 1975
and his remains were embalmed in a temporary mausoleum at Tzuhu in
Taoyuan, awaiting proper burial in China.
</P>
<P>
Chiang Ching-kuo, who was respected for ending martial law in
Taiwan shortly before his death, died in 1988 and his remains also
lie embalmed in an interim mausoleum at Touliao in Taoyuan.

DPP TO PUSH FOR PRIORITY BILLS DURING NEW LEGISLATIVE SESSION
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Sept.  4 (CNA)
(By Luis Huang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The ruling Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) will use the year-end "three-in-one" local elections to push
for a package of priority draft bills during the new legislative
session that will start in mid-September, a whip of the DPP
legislative caucus said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
William C.T. Lai said that in the run-up to the elections for
city mayors/county magistrates, city/county councilors, and
township/village chiefs, the DPP will try to expound on the contents
of various key draft bills, the government's stance and the disputed
points between the ruling and opposition parties, to solicit public
support.
</P>
<P>
Lai said the move will not only boost the possibility of priority
draft bills clearing the legislature but will also enhance the DPP's
chances of winning the elections, which will be a litmus test for the
political climate in the lead-up to the 2008 presidential election.
</P>
<P>
The second session of the sixth Legislative Yuan is due to
formally open Sept. 13, and with fewer than 100 days remaining until
the Dec. 3 elections, the ruling and the opposition parties are
expected to unveil a series of bills related to the general public to
solicit voter support for their candidates.
</P>
<P>
The Executive Yuan has come up with a total of 18 prioritized
draft bills for the legislature to screen during its new session,
including a draft statute governing an arms procurement package, an
eight-year, NT$80 billion flood-control budget plan, a proposal on
confirmation of the Control Yuan members, a draft revision to the
Organic Law of the Executive Yuan and a draft amendment to the
National Health Insurance Law, according to Lai.
</P>
<P>
Based upon a consensus reached between the DPP legislative caucus
and the Executive Yuan, the number of priority bills has been
reduced, Lai said. He called on the opposition-controlled legislature
to support all the draft bills, which he said are of great importance
and urgency.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Legislator Chen Ching-chun, who also serves as
secretary-general of the DPP legislative caucus, voiced the hope that
opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Ma Ying-jeou will lead his party
with new vision into cooperating with the ruling party to push for
the early passage of various key draft bills during the new
legislative session.
</P>
<P>
The arms procurement bill and its budget to buy eight
diesel-electric submarines, six Patriot PAC III anti-missile
batteries and a squadron of 12 P-3C anti-submarine aircraft from the
United States as well as the confirmation of the Control Yuan members
nominated by President Chen Shui-bian have been stalled for two
consecutive sessions due to opposition from the "pan-blue alliance"
of the KMT and the People First Party (PFP) . Whether the two
long-stalled draft bills will be put on the legislative agenda is
still a focus of media attention.
</P>
<P>
Over the past five years, the KMT and the PFP have used their
slim majority in the legislature to boycott various policy
initiatives launched by the government.

CABINET URGES LEGISLATURE TO PASS FLOOD-CONTROL BILL BY OCTOBER
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Sept. 4 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Cabinet spokesman Cho Jung-tai said Sunday
he is hopeful that the opposition-controlled Legislative Yuan will
pass an eight-year NT$80 billion (US$2.54 billion) flood-control bill
before the end of October to allow for an early start of various
flood prevention programs around the country.
</P>
<P>
Cho said the government originally expected the legislature to
hold an extraordinary session during its summer recess, but the
legislature refused.
</P>
<P>
According to the legislature's work schedule, the first two
months of the new legislative session will be devoted to general
interpellations after lawmakers begin to meet in mid-September. In
that case, the legislature will not begin to screen the
flood-fighting bill until December.
</P>
<P>
In view of the repeated flood-triggered devastation in recent
months, Cho said it is hoped that the opposition-controlled
legislature can put the nation's well-being above partisan strife and
pass the flood-control bill as early as possible.
</P>
<P>
"I'm hopeful that the legislature can devote at least one day per
week to screening major bills once its new session kicks off later
this month. Hopefully, the flood-control bill can clear the
legislative floor before the end of October. Should that be the case,
the government will have two months to prepare and ensure that
various flood-fighting projects can get underway in January 2006, "
Cho said.
</P>
<P>
As to Premier Frank Hsieh's challenge to the opposition to topple
the Cabinet if it wants to continue to stonewall the flood-control
bill, Cho said Hsieh's remarks were mainly aimed at highlighting the
legislature's absurdity.
</P>
<P>
Tired by the opposition's foot-dragging on the flood-controlled
bill, Hsieh said Saturday that the opposition should pass a
no-confidence vote against his administration if they really believe
the bill is inappropriate. Should the legislature passes the
no-confidence vote, Hsieh said, he would ask the president -- in line
with constitutional provisions -- to dissolve the legislature and
pave the way for a new legislative election to let the public to
decide whether the legislature is qualified to reject the
flood-control bill.
</P>
<P>
Cho said Hsieh's remarks mainly reflected his admiration for what
he claimed is the U.S. Congress' "high efficiency" in response to the
devastation caused by Hurricane Katrina. The U.S. Congress advanced
its opening day of the new session to pass a US$10.5 billion budget
for emergency flood relief programs in the wake of the disaster.

Taiwan's top labor affairs official is
determined to quit her job after tendering her resignation last week
to take responsibility for the Aug. 21 riot by Thai laborers working
on the Kaohsiung rapid transit railway project, aides at the Council
of Labor Affairs (CLA) said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The aides said that Chen Chu was furious about rumors suggesting
that her resignation was in preparation for her planned candidacy for
Kaohsiung mayor in the year-end elections.
</P>
<P>
Premier Frank Hsieh disclosed last Saturday that he had not
decided whether to accept Chen's resignation and that the question
would depend on the results of a probe into the Kaohsiung County
riot.
</P>
<P>
Hsieh has instructed Minister-without-Portfolio Hsu Chih-hsiung
to carry out an investigation into the riot, which arose because of
the Thai workers' protest against inhumane treatment and has severely
damaged Taiwan's international image.
</P>
<P>
Chen's aides also denied speculation that she submitted her
resignation because she was unhappy that after receiving her
investigation report on the riot, the premier wanted another Cabinet
minister to probe the causes of the riot.
</P>
<P>
The aides said that Chen's report mentions a few points of
suspicion for prosecutors to clarify and that she is willing to
cooperate with them in their investigation of the case.

COOPERATION WITH PFP IN LEGISLATURE IS KMT PRIORITY
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Sept. 4 (CNA)

<TEXT>
<P>
The main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) will
make it a priority to cooperate with its "pan-blue alliance" ally the
People First Party (PFP) in passing or blocking a government law bill
in the next Legislative Yuan session that opens Sept. 13, KMT
officials said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
They said KMT Chairman Ma Ying-jeou and his aides have been
watching Legislative Yuan President Wang Jin-pyng's statements on
such issues as weapons procurement, flood control and nomination of
Control Yuan members.
</P>
<P>
Tseng Yung-chuan, director of the KMT Policy Committee, said
depending on party-to-party talks with the PFP, the KMT might not
necessarily support the Cabinet's arms purchase budget bill but might
agree to a special budget proposal for using NT$80 billion over the
next eight years to fight floods.
</P>
<P>
However, KMT think tanks recommend that the flood-control budget
be proposed in accordance with the law governing government debt,
which stipulates that the share of special budgets must not exceed 15
percent of the total budget.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, Tseng said, the government should break the NT$80
billion total into eight annual budgets of NT$10 billion so that the
proposal will accord with the spirit of annual budgets.
</P>
<P>
In regard to the special budget for purchasing three major
weapons, Ma has asked the party caucus to consider the issue from the
standpoints of stabilizing cross-Taiwan Strait relations and building
a mechanism to promote mutual trust.
</P>
<P>
Tseng said this kind of logic might make it unnecessary to buy
any major weapons. Still, this is not yet final, as a KMT ad hoc
committee is still evaluating the views of all parties concerned, he
added.
</P>
<P>
He added that even though the government has moved the special
budget for buying Patriot III anti-missile batteries to the annual
budget, the KMT might not support the remaining portion of the
special budget for buying submarines and anti-submarine aircraft.
</P>
<P>
Wang has indicated that the arms purchase bill should at least be
discussed at the Legislative Yuan's Procedure Committee. With the
KMT's strong intervention, the bill might not pass the Procedure
Committee if the PFP acts in concert, Tseng added.
</P>
<P>
On the controversy about President Chen Shui-bian's nominations
of the Control Yuan members, Tseng said the KMT expects the president
to renominate the members and change some members in the review
committee, including Nita Ing, chairwoman of the Taiwan High Speed
Rail Corp. (THSR).
</P>
<P>
Tseng said that only when Chen presents a new list of Control
Yuan nominees will the KMT and PFP consider deliberating the list.
</P>
<P>
Legislator Lai Shyh-bao, also a KMT Central Standing Committee
member, agreed that Chen should renominate the Control Yuan members
and that the flood control budget should be put on the regular budget
instead of a special budget.
</P>
<P>
Lai noted that the KMT has not finalized its position on the arms
purchase issue.
</P>
<P>
The party will adopt a strategy of "close monitoring but no
filibustering" during the new legislative session, mainly in
cooperation with the PFP, to maintain the "pan-blue alliance"
majority in the legislature, party officials said.

PRESIDENT VOWS NO RECOGNITION OF CHINA'S ACADEMIC ACCREDITATION
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Sept. 4 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President Chen Shui-bian said Sunday that
Taiwan will not recognize China's academic accreditation during his
tenure.
</P>
<P>
"So long as I remains in office, Taiwan is unlikely to recognize
China's academic accreditation. This is not for my sake, but rather
for the sake of Taiwan, for Taiwan's schools and young people," Chen
said while attending a closing session of the three-day National
Youth Conference.
</P>
<P>
If the government recognizes China's academic accreditation, Chen
said he is afraid that local youths would travel to China in throngs
for education.
</P>
<P>
"Then, our schools would have a hard time recruiting enough
students. In that case, Taiwan's educational system would be gravely
affected," he added.
</P>
<P>
Touching on the proposal that the two sides of the Taiwan Strait
forge direct transport links, Chen said the issue should be addressed
from the perspectives of national security and Taiwan's maximum
interests.
</P>
<P>
"Some people have been pressuring the government to open direct
cross-strait air and shipping services. This is a solemn issue that
we cannot afford to make any misjudgment, " Chen said. Even though
direct cross-strait transport links may bring economic benefits, Chen
said the government should make an overall review of such links'
impact on Taiwan's national security and maximum interests.
</P>
<P>
"We should consider whether the arrangements would denigrate our
national status or undermine Taiwan's separate national identity," he
added.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the two sides of the Taiwan Strait lack mutual
understanding, Chen said Taiwan should encourage research on China
and the Communist Party of China. By the same token, he said, China
should also try to understand Taiwan and encourage "Taiwan study."
</P>
<P>
"When we come to better understand each other, we would be less
likely to indulge in wishful thinking," Chen said.

PFP WON'T LET ARMS BILL PASS LEGISLATURE'S PROCEDURE COMMITTEE
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Sept. 4 (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With a new session of the Legislative Yuan
approaching, the nation's second largest opposition People First
Party (PFP) said Sunday it is still opposed to putting the
government's arms purchase budget bill on the legislative agenda.
</P>
<P>
Wang Jin-pyng, president of the legislature, has said that the
bill should at least be discussed at the committee level, but PFP
spokesman Huang Yi-chiao said the opposition parties should use all
opportunities, including the Procedure Committee, to "thoroughly
guard" national interest.
</P>
<P>
Huang's remarks dimmed the prospect of the government bill
passing through the legislative floor to purchase Patriot PAC III
anti-missile batteries, submarines and anti-submarine aircraft as the
largest opposition Kuomintang (KMT) has vowed to make it a priority
to cooperate with its "pan-blue alliance" ally PFP in the new session
starting Sept. 13.
</P>
<P>
Huang said the reason for PFP taking such a tough stand is that
the nation's opposition forces are suffering from an "asymmetrical"
disadvantage in the face of the ruling camp's huge political
resources. He said the move is aimed at nipping in the bud any ruling
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) attempts to divide the opposition.
</P>
<P>
Huang said the DPP has used various special budgets, starting
with the so-called "defensive referendum" in late 2003, to stage
rallies and spread rumors trying to coerce the opposition parties to
let the government have it ways, and yet little progress has been
made in administrative efficiency.
</P>
<P>
He said the PFP will stand firm on its position to monitor the
government, and it will ask its KMT ally not to loosen up.
</P>
<P>
Chang Shien-yao, director of PFP Policy Center, said his party
has never opposed buying weapons or fighting floods. But because of
the nation's financial difficulties, PFP has demanded that the
government put forward a list of priorities for the nation's overall
interests.
</P>
<P>
For instance, Chang said, flood control should precede arms
purchase because the latter concerns cross-Taiwan Strait relations --
if there is peace across the strait, then weapons procurement would
not be so urgent.
</P>
<P>
That's why PFP has since August been saying that flood-control
bills should be a priority for the legislature, not the special
budget bill for buying weaponry, he added.
</P>
<P>
Liu Wen-hsiung, a PFP lawmaker, cited the hurricane disaster in
New Orleans, southern U.S., as an example of a domestic issue taking
precedence over the war issue.

PRESIDENT CHEN'S CHIEF OF STAFF TO VISIT JAPAN
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Sept. 4 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President Chen Shui-bian's chief of staff
will leave for Tokyo Monday to attend a forum on Taiwan-Japan
relations scheduled for Sept 6-7, political sources said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Yu Shyi-kun, secretary-general to the president, will be the
highest-ranking Republic of China official ever to attend a public
event in Japan since Tokyo switched diplomatic recognition to Beijing
from Taipei in 1972, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
Most of the Taiwan-Japan forum activities are closed-door
meeting, with the exception of a seminar scheduled for Sept.7
afternoon on the new Asian situation and feasible response strategies
which will open for media coverage, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
Both Yu, a former ROC premier, and Yasuhiro Nakasone, who served
as Japanese prime minister from 1982 through 1987, will attend the
Sept. 7 seminar to exchange views on relevant topics.
</P>
<P>
On behalf of their respective countries, the sources said, Yu and
Nakasone will speak at a cocktail reception marking the end of the
forum on Sept. 7 evening.
</P>
<P>
In his speech, Yu will accentuate the need for Taiwan and Japan
to forge "Track II" dialogue channels and strengthen their
cooperation in promoting freedom, democracy, human rights and peace
in the face of the new Asian situation. Yu will also take the
opportunity to express Taiwan's gratitude for Japan's granting of
90-day visa-free treatment for prospective Taiwan visitors, the
inclusion of Taiwan into the list of strategic goals of the
Japan-U.S. defense treaty, and its support for Taiwan's bid to become
a World Health Assembly observer.
</P>
<P>
Other members of the Taiwan delegation will include Vice Economic
Affairs Minister Chen Ruey-lung; Lo Fu-chuan, president of the
Association of East Asian Relations; Tseng Yung-hsien, vice chairman
of the Foundation on International and Cross-Strait Studies; and Tung
Li-wen, director of the China Affairs Department of the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP).
</P>
<P>
Since the DPP took power in 2000, the Presidential Office has set
up a special panel to boost exchanges and cooperation with Japan. The
Taiwan-Japan forum is the panel's achievement in forging a dialogue
mechanism in the absence of official ties.
</P>
<P>
Yu is scheduled to wrap up his Japan visit and return to Taipei
Sept. 9.

<TEXT>
<P>
President Chen Shui-bian's planned transit
stop in the United States will not be affected by the postponement of
Chinese President Hu Jintao's U.S. visit, a Presidential Office
spokesman said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
James Huang, deputy secretary-general of the Presidential Office,
was responding to media reports that Hu has postponed his official
visit to the United States next week due to Hurricane Katrina, but he
and President George W. Bush have agreed to meet on the sidelines of
a U.N. assembly in New York later this month.
</P>
<P>
Hu was originally scheduled to arrive in Seattle Monday to start
his first official visit to the United States since he assumed office
in 2003. According to foreign wire service reports, Hu talked with
Bush by phone Saturday and the two leaders agreed to postpone a
meeting planned for Wednesday "due to the special condition faced
with the U.S. government in handling with the serious disaster caused
by Hurricane Katrina."
</P>
<P>
The White House also said Saturday that Bush had to cancel his
meeting with Hu because of the hurricane's aftermath but the two
leaders agreed to meet in New York on the sidelines of a U.N. meeting
in mid-September to mark the world body's 60th founding anniversary.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the reports, Huang said President Chen's planned
layover in the United States later this month on his way to Central
America will not and should not be affected by the postponement of
Hu's U.S. visit.
</P>
<P>
"President Chen will just make a transit stop in the United
States en route to Central America for a diplomatic tour, " Huang
said.
</P>
<P>
As to the postponement of Hu's U.S. travel plan, Huang said the
Presidential Office doesn't have any opinion and cannot make any
comment.
</P>
<P>
Huang further said the itinerary of President Chen's Central
America visit will be announced in mid-September. Chen will travel to
Nicaragua later this month to attend a summit meeting with the
nation's Central American diplomatic allies and visit several other
countries in Central America and the Caribbean.

CHEN REAFFIRMS COMMITMENT TO 2ND-PHASE CONSTITUTIONAL REFORM
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Sept.  4 (CNA)
(BY Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President Chen Shui-bian said Sunday he
will do his utmost in the next two year to hasten the birth of a new
constitution that fits Taiwan's political reality.
</P>
<P>
Chen made the remarks while attending a session of the three-day
National Youth Conference that began Friday.
</P>
<P>
Claiming that the existing ROC Constitution has become obsolete
and unfit to Taiwan's political and social situation, Chen said he
will push for second-phase constitutional reform in the coming two
years to consolidate Taiwan's young democracy.
</P>
<P>
After listening to a report on democratic development and
relations across the Taiwan Strait, Chen said Taiwan's sovereignty
issue is not just strengthening localization but should also upgrade
its national identity.
</P>
<P>
"We should drive home to the international community that Taiwan
is not part of China. Taiwan is the Republic of China. It is by no
means part of the People's Republic of China," Chen stressed.
</P>
<P>
Touching on the second-phase constitutional reform, Chen said the
reform will bring the country's Constitution in line with that of the
advanced countries in terms of the protection of human rights,
liberty and others.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Chen said the second-phase reform will focus on
restructure the government system and adjust election schedules as
part of the efforts to improve government efficiency.
</P>
<P>
"At present, we have too many elections. We conduct elections
almost every year. We have paid a great deal of social costs for all
those elections. This trend should be stopped," he added.

he will soon call on new Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Ma Ying-jeou and
exchange views with him on important issues related to Taiwan's
interests and the people's well-being.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at Chiang Kai-shek International Airport, Soong, who
left for the United States before the Aug. 16 KMT chairmanship
election for a vacation, also said that the opposition parties must
do whatever they can to oversee the ruling government's conduct.
</P>
<P>
The PFP head was greeted at the airport by Ma and high-ranking
PFP officials. It was Ma's first meeting in person with Soong since
he was elected as KMT chairman last month.
</P>
<P>
Besides extending his congratulations on Ma's victory in the
chairmanship election, Soong also expressed the hope that the two
parties will continue to work together at the Legislative Yuan.
</P>
<P>
"Only through better cooperation between the two parties can the
strength of the 'pan-blue alliance' be consolidated," he said, adding
that "this will also meet with the public's expectations."
</P>
<P>
Pointing out that issues regarding bills which have long been
stalled in the legislature, the crisis of marginalization in the
international economic system that Taiwan faces, cross-Taiwan Strait
stability, the nation's status and the oppositions' stance on how to
oversee the government's operations are the focal points of the
public's concerns, Soong said that he will thoroughly discuss these
issues with the KMT's new leader.
</P>
<P>
Soong further said that while he was in the United States, he
really worried a lot about the current situation in Taiwan, adding
that continuing to waste time in dealing with the issue of the
nation's development will absolutely have an impact on the
competitiveness of the island.
</P>
<P>
"Therefore, the opposition parties must be united and better
oversee the work of the government in order to prevent Taiwan from
drowning and perishing," Soong stressed.
</P>
<P>
Noting that if Taiwan doesn't work hard and push forward, it will
gradually be forgotten by the international community, the PFP head
also urged the ruling Democratic Progressive Party to deal
practically with cross-strait relations. "Otherwise, the island will
continue to regress in the future, " he added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Ma said that his presence at the airport was not only
aimed at welcoming Soong's return to Taiwan, but also for the purpose
of arranging for an official Soong-Ma meeting as soon as possible, as
such a meeting "will effectively bridge the gap between the two
parties."
</P>
<P>
KMT spokeswoman Cheng Li-wen also said that Ma wanted to show his
goodwill by heading to the airport to welcome Soong back, adding that
Ma appreciates the quick response of the PFP chairman who promised to
pay a courtesy call to the KMT headquarters soon.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, staff members of the PFP also said the same day that
the PFP and the KMT have maintained a very solid cooperation
relationship, including close cooperation in the legislature.
</P>
<P>
As Soong had frankly voiced his support for Wang Jing-pyng,
speaker of the Legislative Yuan, in the KMT chairmanship race, the
interactions between Ma and Soong as well as their views about the
future cooperation between the two parties in the year-end county
magistrates elections have been a focus of the public's attention.

U.N. URGED TO PLAY ACTIVE ROLE IN MAINTAINING CROSS-STRAIT PEACE
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Paris,  Sept. 4 (CNA)
(By Y.S. Lo and P.C. Tang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
About 40 Taiwanese students and expatriates
in France launched a campaign Monday at the Taiwan Representative
Office in Paris to urge members of local Taiwanese communities to
jointly sign a statement requesting that the United Nations play an
active role in maintaining peace in the Taiwan Strait.
</P>
<P>
The statement said that Taiwan has no intention of challenging
the rights of any U.N. members by pushing its bid to join the world
body, adding that Beijing's continuous obstruction in dealing with
Taiwan's efforts to join the international community can only
irritate the 23 million people of Taiwan and Taiwanese living abroad.
</P>
<P>
"This obstruction will not help improve relations between the two
sides of the Taiwan Strait. On the contrary, it will be harmful to
peace in the strait," it further said.
</P>
<P>
The statement also called for U.N. members to look without bias
at Taiwan's legitimate right to participate in the United Nations and
urged them to support the Taiwan people's right to representation in
the organization.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, the statement also urged China, in accordance with
the U.N. Charter, to give up its threats of military force and to
engage in peaceful dialogue and exchanges with the island.

TOKYO GOVERNOR TO VISIT TAIPEI TO DISCUSS BEIJING'S BEHAVIOR
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Tokyo,   Sept.  5  (CNA)
(By Mike Chang and Deborah Kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Tokyo Governor Shintaro Ishihara is
scheduled to visit Taiwan Sept. 6-9, mainly to discuss the
repercussions of Beijing's abrupt withdrawal from the Asian Network
of Major Cities 21 (ANMC) and its annual meetings.
</P>
<P>
Officials from the Tokyo Governor's Office confirmed Monday that
during his four-day stay in Taiwan, Ishihara will meet with President
Chen Shui-bian and Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou to exchange views on the
changing situation after Beijing announced Aug. 30 that it had
decided to drop out of the ANMC group.
</P>
<P>
Founded in 2001 by Ishihara, the ANMC is meant to be a forum of
mayors of major Asian cities. It groups Bangkok, Beijing, New Delhi,
Hanoi, Jakarta, Kuala Lumpur, Manila, Seoul, Singapore, Taipei, Tokyo
and Yangon. The 12 cities have since taken turns hosting the ANMC
annual meetings.
</P>
<P>
Taipei began to bid to host the 2005 ANMC meeting in July 2004,
but Beijing entered the race against Taipei for the hosting right
only a few days before the Nov. 22-23, 2004 Jakarta meeting, simply
because it did not want to see Taipei play any significant role in
the meeting.
</P>
<P>
In a vote to choose between Taipei and Beijing, Beijing beat
Taipei by winning seven out of 12 votes, but was one vote shy of the
two-thirds needed to win the hosting right.
</P>
<P>
In the ensuing negotiations, all of the meeting-attendants except
Beijing Deputy Mayor Zhang Mao, the Beijing representative, agreed
that Beijing should host the 2005 meeting, with Taipei getting the
priority right to host the 2006 meeting.
</P>
<P>
When the chairman of the meeting announced the results of the
negotiations, Beijing's representative walked out in protest.
</P>
<P>
Beijing has since refused to endorse a joint statement issued by
the 2004 ANMC meeting regarding the 2005 and 2006 sponsorships.
</P>
<P>
Ishihara himself has also asked Beijing to sign the joint
statement over the past 10 months. Nevertheless, Beijing informed
Tokyo abruptly Aug. 30 that it was withdrawing from the ANMC
grouping, apparently in a gesture of opposition against Taipei's
hosting the ANMC meeting in 2006.
</P>
<P>
In a news conference held in Tokyo last Friday, Ishihara
condemned Beijing's rudeness and unreasonableness by dropping out of
the grouping, saying that refusing to endorse the ANMC joint
statement runs counter to international rules and norms. "China is a
country that does not play by the rules," Ishihara said.
</P>
<P>
Because of Beijing's abrupt withdrawal, the holding of the 2005
ANMC annual meeting is now facing various uncertainties, including
whether the 2005 ANMC meeting will be held or not, prompting Ishihara
to go to Taipei to meet President Chen and Taipei Mayor Ma, who
attended the 2004 meeting in Jakarta.
</P>
<P>
During the 2004 ANMC meeting, Ma expressed regret that Beijing's
representative did his best to scuttle Taipei's chance to play a role
on the international stage.
</P>
<P>
However, Ma did not rule out the possibility of attending the
2005 meeting in Beijing in spite of his unhappy encounter with the
Beijing representative in Jakarta.
</P>
<P>
Ishihara's forthcoming visit to Taiwan will be his fifth since
assuming the Tokyo governorship in April 1999. He was in Taipei in
May 2004 to attend President Chen's inauguration for a second
four-year term and he was again in Taipei in October the same year at
the invitation of the Taiwan Railway Administration.
</P>
<P>
He visited central Taiwan shortly after the island was struck by
a deadly earthquake on Sept. 21, 1999.
</P>
<P>
Ishihara, formerly Japan's minister of transport and a talented
writer who received the prestigious Akutagawa Prize for one of his
books, has been the most prominent Japanese political figure to visit
Taiwan since Japan severed formal diplomatic relations with the
Republic of China in 1972.

PRESIDENT'S CHIEF OF STAFF LEAVES FOR TOKYO TO ATTEND FORUM
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Sept. 5 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President Chen Shui-bian's chief of staff
left for Tokyo Monday to attend a forum on Taiwan-Japan relations
scheduled for Sept 6-7.
</P>
<P>
Yu Shyi-kun, secretary-general to the president, is the
highest-ranking Republic of China official ever to attend a public
event in Japan since Tokyo switched diplomatic recognition to Beijing
from Taipei in 1972.
</P>
<P>
Yu said prior to his departure that the theme of this year's
Taiwan-Japan forum will focus on new situations in Asia and possible
responsible strategies to address changes.
</P>
<P>
During his first tenure as the Presidential Office
secretary-general, Yu concurrently headed a Presidential Office
special panel in charge of promoting exchanges and cooperation with
Japan. He later served as premier and returned to serve as Chen's
chief of staff again after ending his premiership earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
"The Taiwan-Japan forum can serve as a 'track-two' unofficial
dialogue channel, which can contribute to the two countries' policy
formulation," Yu said.
</P>
<P>
In his view, Yu said, substantive Taiwan-Japan relations have
made significant progress in recent years. The upcoming Taiwan-Japan
forum will discuss what the two countries can do to cope with the
emerging new situations in Asia, he added.
</P>
<P>
Yu will also meet with Japanese politicians, including former
Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone and Tokyo Governor Shintaro
Ishihara.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to Ishihara's promotion on Taiwan's behalf, Yu said the
number of Japanese tourists to Taiwan has increased substantially in
recent months.
</P>
<P>
"I'll take the opportunity to thank Ishihara for his assistance
in attracting Japanese citizens to make sightseeing trips to Taiwan,"
Yu said.
</P>
<P>
Most of the Taiwan-Japan forum activities are closed-door
meetings, with the exception of a seminar scheduled for Sept. 7
afternoon which will be open for media coverage. Both Yu and
Nakasone, who served as Japanese prime minister from 1982 through
1987, will attend the Sept. 7 seminar.
</P>
<P>
On behalf of their respective countries, Yu and Nakasone will
also speak at a cocktail reception marking the end of the forum on
the evening of the same day.
</P>
<P>
In his speech, Yu will accentuate the need for Taiwan and Japan
to forge "track-two" dialogue channels and strengthen their
cooperation in promoting their common values of freedom, democracy,
human rights and peace in the face of new Asian situations.
</P>
<P>
Yu will also take the opportunity to express Taiwan's gratitude
for Japan's granting of 90-day visa-free treatment for prospective
Taiwan visitors, the inclusion of Taiwan Strait peace into the list
of strategic goals of the Japan-U.S. defense cooperation, and its
support for Taiwan's bid to become a World Health Assembly observer.
</P>
<P>
Other members of the Taiwan delegation include Vice Minister of
Economic Affairs Chen Ruey-lung; Lo Fu-chuan, president of
the Association of East Asian Relations; Tseng Yung-hsien, vice
chairman of the Foundation on International and Cross-Strait Studies;
and Tung Li-wen, director of the China Affairs Department of the
ruling Democratic Progressive Party.
</P>
<P>
Yu is scheduled to wrap up his Japan visit and return to Taipei
Sept. 9.

TAIWAN THE MOST VULNERABLE DEMOCRACY TO 'ASYMMETRICAL THREATS': CHEN
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Sept. 5 (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Terrorists have been waging "asymmetrical
war" against some Western democracies, and although Taiwan is not a
target of international terrorism, it is most vulnerable among all
democracies to "asymmetrical threats, " said President Chen Shui-bian
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Chen made his remarks while addressing Taiwan's rapid strike
police force that had just concluded a training program. He called on
the crack force to constantly upgrade their combat skills as
criminals are also upgrading their tools and techniques.
</P>
<P>
The Sept. 11 terrorist attacks and the recent bombings of
London's public transit system indicate that the line between social
order and national security has blurred, Chen said.
</P>
<P>
"With a sophisticated plan, a few people can cause great
casualties to a certain group of the public and paralyze the
operation of a city without any prior warning," he said.
</P>
<P>
These kinds of asymmetrical attacks and threats pose the gravest
challenge to social and national security agencies around the world,
Chen added.
</P>
<P>
He said Taiwan is the most vulnerable among all democracies in
the face of these asymmetrical threats. To put it simply, he noted,
Taiwan is a country that is under constant threat of war and yet does
not have a wartime regime.
</P>
<P>
The president pointed to China as the source of that constant
threat on Taiwan as Beijing's Anti-Secession Law authorizes the
People's Liberation Army to use "non-peaceful" means to settle
disputes with Taiwan, and China's military has been carefully
studying "asymmetrical war tactics."
</P>
<P>
Chen said judging from the various signs, "We cannot exclude the
possibility that China has already infiltrated Taiwan through legal
and illegal channels, and is ready to sabotage and launch attacks
against us."
</P>
<P>
He stressed that maintaining good social order is the
government's top priority as it is also the No. 1 concern of the
people, and that's why he had announced that improved social order,
tax reform and the overhaul of the health care system are the major
issues that the government must tackle in response to public wishes
when he formed his new Cabinet on Feb. 1 this year.

PREMIER WILL HELP WITH MRT CORRUPTION PROBE IF NECESSARY
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei, Sept. 5 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Prosecutors are investigating if government
officials and businesses have colluded in the construction of the
mass rapid transit (MRT) system for Kaohsiung and Premier Frank Hsieh
is willing to work with prosecutors in the probe if necessary, a
spokesman of the Executive Yuan said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Cho Jung-tai was responding to requests by opposition legislators
that Premier Hsieh recuse himself from the investigations into the
contract- awarding and the construction of the MRT system because
these took place while Hsieh was still Kaohsiung mayor.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that when the MRT system was approved for
NT$195.2 billion (US$6 billion) on Oct. 2, 1998, it was decided that
a "build, operate and transfer, " or "BOT" method would be used,
meaning that the private sector would be responsible for building and
operating the facilities for a certain period of time before
transferring the management to the government.
</P>
<P>
At that time, Vincent Siew was premier, Lin Feng-cheng was the
Minister of Transportation and Communications, and Wu Den-yih was
Kaohsiung mayor, Cho said.
</P>
<P>
The contract to build the MRT system was formally signed Jan. 2,
2001, and Chang Chun-hsiung was premier then, Yeh Chu-lan was the
Minister of Transportation and Communications and Frank Hsieh was
Kaohsiung mayor. The amount approved was NT$181.3 billion. 

</P>
<P>
On questions about why the government adopted a BOT model to
build the MRT system and allow a minor investor -- Chairman Chen
Min-hsien of the small entity, the Southeast Cement Corp. -- to
control the use of the huge construction fund when the government was
shouldering the lion's share of the investment in the project, Cho
said that BOT was approved in the previous Kuomintang administration
and that only then-mayor Wu was unable to push for it.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Kaohsiung City Government attaches importance to
the progress and quality of the construction work, and that the
private sector in the project was to be in charge of subcontractors
and finding foreign laborers.
</P>
<P>
On Premier Hsieh's appointment of Minister-without-Portfolio Hsu
Chih-hsiung to investigate the Council of Labor Affairs (CLA), Cho
said that Hsu's investigation will focus on the division of duties
between the central and local governments as well as the supervisory
operations of the CLA.
</P>
<P>
Reports have surfaced of possible collusion between government
officials and businesses who reaped huge profits from brokering
foreign laborers into the MRT construction for the southern Taiwan
city. The matter only came to light after a recent riot by Thai
laborers working for the Kaohsiung Rapid Transit Corp. (KRTC) to vent
their anger about harsh management and poor living conditions.
</P>
<P>
Both Taiwan and Thailand have started investigations into
irregularities in the wake of the Aug. 21 riot.

LABOR AFFAIRS MINISTER DETERMINED TO QUIT
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Sept.  5  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taiwan's top labor affairs official
reiterated her determination Monday to step down from her post as
minister of the Council of Labor Affairs to take responsibility for
the Aug. 21 riot by Thai laborers working on an MRT development
project in the southern port city of Kaohsiung.
</P>
<P>
Chen Chu, who tendered her resignation to Premier Frank Hsieh
last week, again announced her determination to quit Monday, saying
to the public that as a minister, she should not only be
self-critical, but should also accept the political responsibility
after such a terrible thing like the Aug. 21 riot occurred.
</P>
<P>
Chen, who was unable to speak several times because of sobs, said
that she could not sleep whenever she thought of how the Thai
laborers were hurt and exploited in Taiwan -- an incident that
seriously jeopardized human rights.
</P>
<P>
Chen said she joined Taiwan's democratization movement at the age
of 19 and has lived through may tribulations over the past 30 years,
including political oppression, court trials and doing time
in dark jail cells, but she has never failed in her resolve to
uphold human rights.
</P>
<P>
Being a "daughter of Taiwan, " Chen said she defends the nation's
reputation in the international community in the same way she
protects her parents' image. She said she owes the country,
particularly the working class, an apology after the riot, which she
said has damaged Taiwan's international image.
</P>
<P>
She once again refuted rumors suggesting that her resignation was
in preparation for her planned run for Kaohsiung mayor in the
year-end elections, saying that the goal of her resignation is to
recover the people's confidence in the administration.
</P>
<P>
"My resignation is also a simple reflection of democratic
politics, where responsibility is the core value as well a starting
point," Chen added.
</P>
<P>
Premier Hsieh said Saturday that the question of whether or not
he accepts Chu's resignation will depend on the results of a probe
into the Aug. 21 riot that resulted from Thai laborers' anger over
poor treatment by management and shabby living conditions.
</P>
<P>
Hsieh said that with the council, the Kaohsiung City Government,
and Thai employment brokers all involved in the case, it is presently
difficult to determine who the culprit is, adding that a
determination must await the completion of the investigations.

26 member states of the Paris-based International Energy Agency
agreed last Friday to release some of their strategic petroleum
reserves to combat shortages.
</P>
<P>
However, their effect on world oil prices still remains to be
seen, Lin said.
</P>
<P>
The CPC has not received any instruction from the Cabinet or the
Ministry of Economic Affairs on whether or when to increase domestic
oil prices, but as a state-owned enterprise, CPC has a duty to comply
with government policy and try not to cause big fluctuations of
commodity prices, he added.
</P>
<P>
Although Formosa Petrochemical Corp. (FPC) raised its wholesale 
prices for gasoline and diesel fuel by NT$2.4 and NT$2 per liter,
respectively, on Aug. 31, the CPC has not followed suit.
</P>
<P>
CPC's last price hike was made on Aug. 2 when it followed the
move of the FPC to increase prices of gasoline and diesel fuel by
NT$1.5 per liter, representing a 7.6 percent increase, the highest in
the past decade.

KRTC VICE CHAIRMAN DENIES WRONGDOING IN RIOT OVER LABOR CONDITIONS
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Kaohsiung,  Sept.  5 (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Kaohisung Rapid Transit Corp. (KRTC)
Vice Chairman Chen Min-hsien on Monday categorically denied any
wrongdoing in introducing Thai workers whose recent riot in protest
against maltreatment by Huapan Administration Consultant Co. Ltd. has
created a political storm in Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Chen made the denial both at a news conference and while being
questioned by Kaohisung district prosecutors, who released him after
two hours but restricted him from going abroad so he will be present
when required. Chen voluntarily reported to the prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
At the news conference held at the KRTC, an angry Chen denied
that the KRTC has taken any commission for bringing in the Thai
workers and that some "powerful people" have been involved in alleged
profiteering from importing and managing Thai workers.
</P>
<P>
Chen said he is very upset by the media, whose high profile
coverage has implicated him. He said he will quit his vice
chairmanship and presidential advisor job, as he called on the public
not to link the riot to politics.
</P>
<P>
He said he is just a small player who cannot possibly control the
NT$104.7 billion engineering project of the rapid transit system and
whose duty is nothing but mediating and helping resolve difficulties.
</P>
<P>
"Otherwise, what are the other members of the board doing? Are
they just eating shit?" Chen said.
</P>
<P>
He emphasized that former presidential deputy secretary-general
Chen Che-nan had not been involved in bringing in and managing Thai
workers.
</P>
<P>
Thai workers had been brought in directly, so that no mediation
was needed, and naturally there was no room for so-called
"intervening" by the powers that be, Chen Min-hsien said.
</P>
<P>
As to his own role, he said he has never been a controversial
figure, nor is he a man of questionable character, and he has worked
as the KRTC's vice chairman without pay just to see that the
operations of the BOT project go smoothly.
</P>
<P>
Chen said more than 200 Thai human resource companies were vying
to get the job of sending workers to Kaohisung, and the KRTC decided
to cooperate with three of them because they were recommended by the
Thai labor minister.
</P>
<P>
And now the Thai minister is denying all this, "I don't know what
to say," Chen said.
</P>
<P>
As to why Huapan was selected to manage Thai workers' daily life
in Kaohisung, Chen said he had no idea. He said he only knows that
the three Thai companies had the right to choose whoever they liked
to be their partners in Taiwan.

VICE PRESIDENT SUGGESTS WAYS TO FOIL CHINA'S LIES ABOUT TAIWAN
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Sept. 5 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Vice President Annette Lu suggested Monday
that the government widely publish a U.N. resolution to foil lies by
China about Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Lu made the remarks after addressing the opening of an Overseas
Chinese Affairs Commission meeting and then took questions from its
members for a wide range of issues, including the launching of the
Democratic Pacific Union, which was a brainchild of the vice
president as well as on how to promote Taiwan's U.N. bid.
</P>
<P>
Since 1993, Taiwan has every year asked the U.N. Steering
Committee, through its diplomatic allies, to place Taiwan's U.N. bid
on the General Assembly agenda. Taiwan has been unsuccessful every
time because of China's obstruction.
</P>
<P>
Lu said that before assuming the vice presidency, she spent a lot
of time promoting the U.N. bid, but she "lamented" that the Ministry
of Foreign Affairs has never asked about her opinions on the bid
since she became vice president in May 2000.
</P>
<P>
On how to effectively promote Taiwan's bid to join the U.N., Lu
suggested that Taiwan educate the world, especially reminding U.N.
members that they have been fooled by China on U.N. Resolution No.
2758 in 1971 which gave the "China" seat to the People's Republic of
China at the ROC's expense.
</P>
<P>
She said that Beijing authorities said to the world that the
resolution has ascertained that "Taiwan is part of China, " and that
the "People's Republic of China can represent Taiwan, " which she
believes are "outright lies."
</P>
<P>
The resolution states in fact that the People's Republic of China
is the only legitimate government of China, Lu said, adding that it
has not touched on the relation between Taiwan and China, and has not
ascertained that the People's Republic of China represents Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Lu said that Beijing has fooled the world for many years, adding
that the previous administration and the current one still have
"blind spots" in their international publicity campaigns.
</P>
<P>
Lu also said that recently another report also showed how
unscrupulous China is. She said that the Republic of China is a
founding member of the United Nations, and was the first one to sign
its charter when the world body was founded on Oct. 24, 1945. Reports
have said that Beijing has added "People's Republic of" in front of
the "China," although it was not even born at the time.
</P>
<P>
She lamented that the U.N. would condone tampering with
history.

LIEN CHAN AND  JAMES SOONG ON THE POLITICAL WAY OUT: VICE PRESIDENT

(By Maubo Chang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Lien Chan, the former chairman of the
Kuomintang, and James Soong, the chairman of the People First Party,
will soon become "has-beens, " despite the media hype they caused by
their trips to China, President Annette Lu said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the opening of a meeting of the commissioners of the
Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission, Lu said the two opposition
leaders' China trips "sent out ripples" which seemed to be
significant at the time, but history has proved "the two old men are
fading from Taiwan's politics."
</P>
<P>
"Taiwan is Taiwan, China is China, and all those fed on Taiwan's
rice will love Taiwan rather China, and Lien and Soong were trying in
vain to create an enthusiasm for China in Taiwan," Lu said.
</P>
<P>
Some people consider China as a friendly state or even their
homeland, and pledge their friendship to Beijing after being greeted
in Beijing with a red carpet welcome, but those people found their
glory has dissipated like smoke and there is no longer any role for
them in Taiwan politics, Lu said.
</P>
<P>
She was referring to Lien's trip to China from April 26 to May 3,
and Soong's trip to China from May 5 to May 13.

<P>
After two years of strenuous efforts, Taiwan
has obtained the right to host the 2005 Asian Solid-State Circuits
Conference (ASSCC) in early November, announced TCL Group CEO Hu
Cheng-ta Monday.
</P>
<P>
Hu, who will chair the ASSCC, said that the annual conference

PFP, KMT MIGHT INITIATE PARLIAMENTARY INQUIRY INTO KRTC LABOR RIOT
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The opposition "pan-blue alliance" might
form a parliamentary committee to conduct its own investigation into
the Thai workers' riot in Kaohsiung late last month, an incident that
has created a political storm and has led to the resignation of
Council of Labor Affairs Chairwoman Chen Chu, opposition People First
Party (PFP) sources said Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Legislative Yuan inquiry committee is likely to be discussed
when PFP Chairman James Soong meets with his Kuomintang (KMT)
counterpart Ma Ying-jeou Wednesday, according to the sources.
</P>
<P>
The sources said Soong paid a lot of attention to the incident
while he was abroad and that he told PFP lawmakers to gather as much
information as possible on the riot that has further tarnished
Taiwan's human rights image internationally.
</P>
<P>
Thai workers hired to build Kaohsiung's rapid transit system
rioted Aug. 21 in protest against maltreatment by their management
firm, Huapan Administration Consultant Co. Ltd.
</P>
<P>
Soong returned to Taipei early Monday to be greeted by Ma at the
airport. The two are expected to meet Wednesday to discuss
cooperation in fielding candidates for the year-end city and county
elections and in the legislature.
</P>
<P>
The KMT, PFP and the New Party form the "pan-blue alliance, "
which enjoys a majority in the legislature over the "pan-green camp"
of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party and the pro-independence
Taiwan Solidarity Union.

TSU NOMINATES CANDIDATE FOR CHIAYI MAYORSHIP
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Sept. 5 (CNA)
(By Luis Huang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Central Executive Committee (CEC) of
the opposition Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU) nominated TSU Deputy
Secretary-General Liu Yi-teh Monday to run for the mayorship of
Chiayi City in southern Taiwan in year-end elections for local
government heads.
</P>
<P>
Following CEC approval of the nomination at a meeting held in the
northern city of Keelung, TSU Secretary-General Cheng Cheng-lung said
party officials and legislators will do their utmost to drum up voter
support for Liu.
</P>
<P>
Cheng claimed that as the ruling Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) and the main opposition Kuomintang are facing "problems of
internal integration" in Chiayi City, the TSU stands a fair chance of
winning the mayoral election.
</P>
<P>
The holding of the CEC meeting in Keelung City and fielding Liu
to vie for the Chiayi mayorship was aimed at exerting dual pressure
on the DPP in the hope that the ruling party will make concessions to
TSU candidates in some constituencies in the Dec. 3 "three-in-one"
elections for city mayors/county magistrates, city/county councilors,
and township/village chiefs.
</P>
<P>
Cheng said that during the meeting, the CEC members also
discussed the election situation in Keelung City. The TSU has
nominated former Legislator Chen Chien-ming to run for the Keelung
mayorship.
</P>
<P>
According to the results of a recent survey, Chen's support rate
rose from the initial 5 percent to 12 percent, which Cheng claimed
shows that Keelung citizens have high expectations toward the TSU
candidate.
</P>
<P>
Describing Chen as a young candidate with no political burden,
Cheng said he is confident that the TSU candidate will gradually take
the lead over the DPP candidate, Legislator Wang Tuoh.
</P>
<P>
However, he added that if the "pan-green camp" of the DPP and the
TSU fail to integrate its forces, the "pan-greens" will lose the
Keelung mayoral election.

Taiwan's foreign exchange reserves hit a

to statistics released Monday by the Central Bank of China.
</P>
<P>
The amount represented an increase of US$524 million over the

investments and the appreciation of the Euro against the U.S dollar,
the statistics show.

The figure made Taiwan the third-largest holder of foreign

Tokyo,  Sept.  5 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The 2005 Taiwan-Japan Forum will open in
Tokyo Tuesday, with the participation of government officials, think
tank scholars and business executives from the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Among the participants will be ROC President Chen Shui-bian's
chief of staff, Yu Shyi-kun, who arrived in Taipei Monday along with
20-plus other members of the Taiwan delegation to the annual
conference.
</P>
<P>
Yu, secretary-general to the president, is the highest-ranking
Republic of China official ever to attend a public event in Japan
since Tokyo switched diplomatic recognition to Beijing from Taipei in
1972.
</P>
<P>
Other members of the Taiwan delegation include Vice Minister of
Economic Affairs Chen Ruey-lung; Lo Fu-chuan, president of the
Association of East Asian Relations; Lin Song-huann, director of the
East Asian and Pacific Affairs Department under the Ministry of
Foreign Affairs; Tseng Yung-hsien, vice chairman of the Foundation on
International and Cross-Strait Studies; and Tung Li-wen, director of
the China Affairs Department of the ruling Democratic Progressive
Party.
</P>
<P>
The 2005 Taiwan-Japan Forum is being co-sponsored by the
Taipei-based Foundation on International and Cross-Strait Studies and
the World Peace Research Institute of Japan.
</P>
<P>
The theme of this year's forum will focus on new situations in
Asia and possible responsible strategies to address changes. Topics
will include regional security, economic integration and cooperation,
as well as prospects for Taiwan-Japan relations.
</P>
<P>
Yu said upon his arrival in Tokyo that the Taiwan-Japan forum can
serve as a "track-two" unofficial dialogue channel, which can
contribute to the two countries' policy formulation.
</P>
<P>
He was greeted by Koh Se-kai, the ROC representative to Japan,
and senior executives of the World Peace Research Institute at the
airport.
</P>
<P>
In his view, Yu said, substantive Taiwan-Japan relations have
made significant progress in recent years. The upcoming Taiwan-Japan
forum will discuss what the two countries can do to cope with the
emerging new situations in Asia.
</P>
<P>
Yu will also meet with Japanese politicians, including former
Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone and Tokyo Governor Shintaro
Ishihara.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to Ishihara's promotion on Taiwan's behalf, Yu said the
number of Japanese tourists to Taiwan has increased substantially in
recent months.
</P>
<P>
"I'll take the opportunity to thank Ishihara for his assistance
in attracting Japanese citizens to make sightseeing trips to Taiwan,"
Yu said.
</P>
<P>
Most of the Taiwan-Japan forum activities are closed-door
meetings, with the exception of a seminar scheduled for Sept. 7
afternoon which will be open for media coverage. Both Yu and
Nakasone, who served as Japanese prime minister from 1982 through
1987, will attend the Sept. 7 seminar.
</P>
<P>
On behalf of their respective countries, Yu and Nakasone will
also speak at a cocktail reception marking the end of the forum on
the evening of the same day.
</P>
<P>
In his speech, Yu will accentuate the need for Taiwan and Japan
to forge "track-two" dialogue channels and strengthen their
cooperation in promoting their common values of freedom, democracy,
human rights and peace in the face of new Asian situations.
</P>
<P>
Yu will also take the opportunity to express Taiwan's gratitude
for Japan's granting of 90-day visa-free treatment for prospective
Taiwan visitors, the inclusion of Taiwan Strait peace into the list
of strategic goals of the Japan-U.S. defense cooperation, and its
support for Taiwan's bid to become a World Health Assembly observer.
</P>
<P>
Yu is scheduled to wrap up his Japan visit and return to Taipei
Sept. 9.

LABOR GROUPS PROTEST AGAINST FILIPINO LABORERS' TREATMENT
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei, Sept. 5 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Several labor groups went to the Council of
Labor Affairs (CLA) Monday to protest on behalf of laborers from the
Philippines working for the Formosa Plastics Group's (FPG's) sixth
naphtha cracker plant who they alleged had been beaten and improperly
treated.

</P>
<P>
The FPG later called a press conference to explain the situation
and express its appreciation for the contribution by foreign
laborers.
</P>
<P>
The labor groups, including the Hong Kong-based Asia Pacific
Mission for Migrants, said Filipino laborers at the naphtha
cracker plant in the Mailiao Industrial Zone in Yunlin, southern
Taiwan have their wages deducted illegally, live in squalor and eat
by the side of a ditch because of a lack of proper dining areas. As a
result, they have staged strikes, for which they have been severely
mistreated.
</P>
<P>
On Aug. 2, four Filipino laborers were beaten by security guards,
fired without proper reason and deported by the management along with
12 other foreign laborers.
</P>
<P>
The matter only came to light after flight attendants discovered
the mens' injures. The CLA promised to investigate.
</P>
<P>
Wu Hsin-tze, an FPG manager at the group's sixth naphtha cracker
denied that the laborers were beaten at the plant site.
</P>
<P>
Wu claimed that during the repatriation process, the Filipino
laborers had attempted to escape and security men "might have engaged
in a scuffle with them," resulting in their injuries.
</P>
<P>
FPG officials noted that it has been 10 years since the plant was
built and that more than 40,000 foreign laborers have been employed
there, working in harsh and very windy conditions. He admitted that
the construction could not have been completed on schedule without
their assistance.
</P>
<P>
The officials said that the FPG is carrying out a fourth-stage
expansion of the naphtha cracker and that there are currently 3,197
Thai laborers and 1,802 Filipino laborers in the Mailiao Industrial
zone.
</P>
<P>
The expansion work is being undertaken by local contractor CTCI
Corp. The FPG only introduces foreign laborers in name, but in fact
it is the CTCI that is in charge of the hiring, use and management of
the foreign laborers, while FPG only exercises "rigorous
supervision," they said.
</P>
<P>
On the wage deduction, they said this was "mainly done" by a
manpower brokerage firm commissioned by CTCI Corp., which deducted
the wages without explaining the matter, resulting in
"misunderstanding."
</P>
<P>
On July 14, 156 Filipino laborers assembled in their dormitories,
saying that their wages in the first month were deducted by 40
percent (equivalent to between NT$6,400 and NT$8,400), the officials
said.
</P>
<P>
On learning about their discontent, the company immediately
called a meeting with the CTCI Corp, Samsung Engineering Co. Ltd
(SECL) -- another contractor -- as well as the foreign laborers.
The Philippine office in Taichung also sent officials to the
meeting.
</P>
<P>
In an attempt to mollify the workers, the FPG asked the CTCI to
provide wage receipts in Chinese and English, and said the wages will
go directly into the accounts of the laborers and not via the
brokerage firm. The brokerage fee should be negotiated between the
foreign laborers and the brokerage firm and paid in the Philippines.
The money taken was returned July 19.
</P>
<P>
However, 16 of the laborers refused to work July 15 and deterred
others from working. The FPG therefore dismissed and deported them.
</P>
<P>
The FPG said that if the foreign laborers can produce evidence to
show that they were beaten, the FPG will blame the contractor.
</P>
<P>
Yunlin Magistrate Lee Chin-yung recently visited the Mailiao
Industrial Zone to learn about the working conditions of foreign
laborers after the Aug. 21 riot by Thai laborers working for
Kaohsiung Rapid Transit Corp. (KRTC) in protest against harsh
management and poor living conditions.
</P>
<P>
Lee was said to be satisfied after the FPG officials briefed him
on the humane management and the establishment of smooth communication
channels.

CONSUMER PRICE INDEX ROSE TO RECORD HIGH IN AUGUST: DGBAS
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Sept. 5 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The consumer price index (CPI) rose 3.56
percent in August year-on-year, is a record high since December 1998,
according to statistics released Monday by the Director General of
Budget, Accounting and Statistics (DGBAS) under the Executive Yuan.
</P>
<P>
DGBAS official Wu Chao-ming blamed the sharp rise in food prices
in the wake of typhoons Haitang and Matsa for the
higher-than-expected rise in the index.
</P>
<P>
Wu said the two typhoons took a heavy toll on agriculture, with
Haitang causing damage of NT$3.6 billion (US$111 million) , which is
more than the NT$3.1 billion damage suffered by agriculture in the
whole of 2004.
</P>
<P>
As if that weren't enough, Wu said Matsa ravaged the island hot
on the heels of Haitang before farmers could clear their land of
crops destroyed by Haitang.
</P>
<P>
As a result, Wu said, vegetable prices are on average 49.61
percent higher than that of the previous August and hit a new record,
while fruit prices are 28.07 percent higher.
</P>
<P>
The vegetable and fruit accounted for 3.01 percent out of the
3.56 percent rise in CPI, Wu went on.
</P>
<P>
The much-hyped rise in the price of international crude oil drove
up the domestic petroleum price by 11.71 percent in August and
accounted for a 0.3 percent rise in CPI, Wu said.
</P>
<P>
Consumers will feel the pain of the hike in oil prices more
sharply if the 10 percent hike is maintained for more than one year,
the official said.
</P>
<P>
In that case, he estimated, the CPI will be pushed up by another
0.39 percent to more than 2 percent for the whole year.
</P>
<P>
Citing statistics compiled by the DGBAS, Wu said the CPI stood at
105.31 in August, which represents a growth of 0.76 percent over the
previous month.
</P>
<P>
The rise brings the average CPI rise in the first eight months of
this year to 2.13 percent. However, the core prices, which do not
take into account the prices of fresh vegetables, fish and energy,
rose only a moderate 0.69 percent in the same period.

ACTING KAOHSIUNG MAYOR TENDERS RESIGNATION OVER RIOT BY THAIS: AIDE
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Kaohsiung,  Sept. 5 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Acting Kaohsiung Mayor Chen Chi-mai has
tendered his resignation to Premier Frank Hsieh over a recent riot by
Thai laborers working for the southern port city's mass rapid transit
(MRT) system, his aides said Monday.
</P>
<P>
The acting mayor's aides made the remarks after Chen Chu,
chairwoman of the Cabinet-level Council of Labor Affairs (CLA), said
at a news conference earlier in the day that she rejected a plea from
Hsieh to stay on the job because she felt responsibility for the Aug.
21 riot.
</P>
<P>
Responding to press inquiries as to whether Chen Chi-mai will
follow the lead of the CLA head and resign over the incident, his
aides said the mayor has on many occasions reaffirmed his commitment
to accepting any responsibility that he should assume.
</P>
<P>
According to his aides, Chen Chi-mai first offered to resign
verbally to the premier Aug. 27 and then tendered his written
resignation Aug. 29. The legislator-turned-acting mayor is scheduled
to issue a formal statement on his stance Tuesday, his aides said.
</P>
<P>
Cabinet spokesman Cho Jung-tai confirmed in the evening that
Premier Hsieh has received Chen Chi-mai's resignation letter.
</P>
<P>
Cho said the Cabinet will handle the top labor administrator's
and the acting Kaohsiung mayor's resignation offers on the same
standards.
</P>
<P>
The Aug. 21 riot began when several Thai workers returned to
their dormitory after a day off and were barred from bringing in
alcohol and cigarettes. The workers burned cars and battled police
with stones and slingshots. The laborers, who are building
Kaohsiung's MRT system, complained about rigorous management rules
and poor living conditions.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Chen Chu took political responsibility for the
situation.
</P>
<P>
"The fact that the foreign workers were deprived and were being
hurt dealt a severe blow to my human rights values, and it gave me
pain and unease, " she said. "I don't just blame myself but want to
take responsibility for it."
</P>
<P>
Thais make up the largest group of foreign workers in Taiwan.
There are about 94,000 on the island, employed mostly in the
construction industry.

TSU ACCUSES KRTC VICE CHAIRMAN OF LYING
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Sept.  5 (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The legislative caucus of the opposition
Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU) claimed Monday that Kaohsiung Rapid
Transit Corp. (KRTC) Vice Chairman Chen Min-hsien was lying when he
publicly denied knowing Yaoming Enterprise Co. and Huapan
Administration Consultant Co., the companies that acted for KRTC in
hiring the Thai laborers that rioted late last month.
</P>
<P>
TSU Legislator Lo Chih-ming (Kaohsiung City) said the name of
Yaoming Enterprise was on the witness column of the contract signed
by KRTC and the Thai authorities, which means Chen was lying
publicly, Lo said.
</P>
<P>
In addition, he continued, in an application form, employer KRTC
delegated the hiring job to Yaoming Enterprise Co., whose chief
executive officer is Wang Neng-hui, whose father, Wang Yao-li, is the
CEO of Huapan Administration Consultant Co., which has been accused
by Thai workers of exploiting them.
</P>
<P>
TSU Legislator Tseng Tsahn-deng (Kaohsiung City) said the riot
has hurt Taiwan's international reputation and yet Chen has not made
any apology.
</P>
<P>
Tseng said the prosecution should investigate who is at fault and
that the Kaohsiung city government should take over the
build-operate-transfer (BOT) project instead of continuing to
authorize the scandal-ridden consultant companies to manage the labor
force.
</P>
<P>
TSU legislative caucus convener Ho Min-hsien praised Council of
Labor Affairs Chairwoman Chen Chu for resigning to take political
responsibility but expressed hoped that she will show her courage and
disclose who are the "powerful people" behind the saga.
</P>
<P>
Kaohsiung County's Labor Affairs Bureau has finished its probe
and decided to punish Yaoming Enterprise Co. for violating the
employment and service law.
</P>
<P>
Bureau official Chen Mei-hsi said because Yaoming was not
operating at the place of its registration, it will also be fined
between NT$300,000 and NT$1.5 million.

PFP HEAD: 2ND-PHASE CONSTITUTIONAL REFORM WILL BE DISASTROUS
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Sept.  5 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President Chen Shui-bian's much-hyped
second phase of constitutional reforms will lead the country to
disaster, opposition People First Party (PFP) Chairman James Soong
claimed Monday.
</P>
<P>
Soong, who has just returned from a vacation in the United States
that day, said the president has reneged on an agreement with him in
a February meeting by pressing for the reforms.
</P>
<P>
The PFP chief did not elaborate, but during that February
meeting, the president basically reiterated promises he made in his
2000 inaugural address that he will not push for Taiwan independence
during his term.
</P>
<P>
Soong also quoted what he termed U.S. sources as telling him that
there is no chance whatsoever in the next two years for any
improvement in government ties between Taiwan and China, thereby
giving the PFP a good chance to play an active role in promoting
friendly exchanges between Taiwan and China.
</P>
<P>
Citing the president's announcement the previous day that he will
not give accreditation to Chinese schools during his term, Soong said
this exposes the president's lack of confidence in himself and will
not help Taiwan's competitiveness at all.
</P>
<P>
"Taiwan's competitiveness will not be boosted by putting China in
a bad light, and the president's decision, based as it is on
political considerations, is unacceptable," Soong said.
</P>
<P>
He also reconfirmed his party's opposition to the government's
request for NT$80 billion for flood-control programs and NT$340
billion for arms purchases, claiming that the budgets are "too
sketchy" to be examined, while the administration's "poor job
performance" casts doubt on its ability to use the budget properly.
</P>
<P>
He promised to strengthen opinion exchanges within the heavily
fractured PFP, but added that different opinions among members are
common for any democratic party.

MOFA UNVEILS LIST OF LOCAL CASUALTIES IN AUSTRALIA BUS CRASH

<TEXT>
<P>
Two Taiwanese tourists -- a man and a woman
-- were killed in a bus crash in Australia Monday, the Ministry of
Foreign Affairs (MOFA) said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Five other people in the tour group organized by Taipei's Cola
Tours were critically injured, MOFA officials said, adding that the
remaining 15 group members also sustained minor injuries in the
accident.
</P>
<P>
The deceased were identified as Ko Poh-wei and Liu Hsiu-lan.
One of the five critically injured was a man identified as Ko
Pei-wen. The injured are receiving treatment in five
Australian hospitals.
</P>
<P>
MOFA spokesman Michel Lu said Taiwan's representative office in
Sydney has been in contact with Australian police and hospitals and
added that the office will offer all necessary assistance to the
victims.
</P>
<P>
According to foreign wire service reports, two people were killed
and 22 injured in Australia Monday when a bus full of Taiwanese
tourists on their way to visit a temple ran off a road and rolled 10
meters down an embankment.
</P>
<P>
The 24-seat bus was taking the group to the Nan Tien Temple near
the coastal city of Wollongong south of Sydney when the accident
happened, the reports said.

TAIWAN  KEEPS PUSHING FOR PRESIDENT'S ATTENDANCE AT APEC SUMMIT
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Sept. 5 (CNA)
(By Luis Huang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The government is still doing its best to
get permission for President Chen Shui-bian to attend the 2005
informal leadership meeting of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation
(APEC) forum to be held in mid-November in South Korea, a
presidential aide said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Huang Chih-fang, deputy secretary-general of the Presidential
Office, made the remark in response to media reports that a cartoon
figure of Chen was replaced by that of Academia Sinica President Lee
Yuan-tseh at an exhibition of cartoon figures for leaders who will
attend the upcoming APEC summit. The exhibition started Monday in
Busan City, the venue of this year's annual event.
</P>
<P>
The move does not represent the official stance of the host
country because any APEC resolution must be adopted based upon a
consensus reached among all member states, Huang explained, adding
that whether Chen will be able to attend the informal APEC leadership
meeting cannot be judged only from a cartoon exhibition.
</P>
<P>
Huang stressed that all relevant government agencies will
continue efforts to push for Chen to attend the annual APEC summit
in person.
</P>
<P>
Lee, a co-winner of the 1986 Nobel Prize in chemistry, has
represented Chen at the annual APEC leadership meeting over the past
three years.
</P>
<P>
APEC is one of the few international organizations to admit both
Taipei and Beijing. Because of Beijing's opposition, the Republic of
China's head of state has never been allowed to attend previous APEC
annual informal leadership meetings and has instead had to name a
proxy to attend on his behalf.
</P>
<P>
APEC, which is dedicated to promoting the free flow of
information, trade and investment, groups 21 economies, including
Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, China, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Japan,
South Korea, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea, Peru,
Philippines, Russia, Singapore, Taiwan, Thailand, the United States
and Vietnam.

LEGISLATURE CONTINUES TO REJECT ARMS PROCUREMENT BILL
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Sept. 6 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The opposition-controlled Legislative Yuan
continued to stonewall a long-stalled arms procurement package
Tuesday, with the legislative procedure committee refusing to put it
on the legislative agenda.
</P>
<P>
The legislative caucus of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) said it is regrettable that the opposition pan-blue
alliance-controlled procedure committee still blocked the bill even
after the Cabinet had made a goodwill response to some opposition
lawmakers' suggestion that part of the procurement package be
financed by the regular defense budget to allow for closer
legislative scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
The package comprises three big-ticket weaponry items -- eight
diesel-electric submarines, a squadron of 12 P-3C anti-submarine
aircraft and six Patriot PAC III anti-missile batteries. For more
than a year, the opposition "pan-blue alliance" of the Kuomintang
(KMT) and the People First Party (PFP) has declined to screen the
package for various reasons.
</P>
<P>
Legislative Yuan President Wang Jin-pyng, a KMT heavyweight, said
recently he thinks that the legislature should begin to deal with the
arms procurement bill when the new legislative session formally opens
Sept. 13. However, most KMT and PFP lawmakers seemed not to see eye
to eye with Wang on the issue.

RECOGNIZING CHINESE DEGREES 'DIFFICULT' PRIOR TO ASSESSMENT: MAC HEAD
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Sept.  6 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) Chairman
Joseph Wu said Tuesday that it will be difficult for the government
to recognize academic degrees issued by China's colleges and
universities before an assessment is carried out and complimentary
measures are formulated.
</P>
<P>
The head of the nation's top China policy planner made the
remarks before attending an annual meeting of the Overseas Chinese
Affairs Commission.
</P>
<P>
His remarks came in the wake of President Chen Shui-bian's
statement Sunday that the government will not recognize mainland
Chinese college and university academic degrees during his remaining
term in office.
</P>
<P>
Wu said the government has to take current realities into
consideration when formulating its policy, noting that more than 160
colleges and universities in Taiwan already face serious problems in
recruiting enough students.
</P>
<P>
A rash decision to recognize mainland Chinese academic
accreditation would make the situation even more difficult for
Taiwan's colleges and universities, he said.
</P>
<P>
In addition, he pointed out, there exists the rampant problem of
fake academic degrees in China, adding that "it will be difficult for
a further opening" prior to educational authorities discussing
seriously procedures concerning accreditation.
</P>
<P>
On suggestions that Taiwan colleges and universities open their
doors to Chinese students, Wu said that several Taiwan colleges have
already accepted Chinese students under exchange programs and that
related government agencies are discussing how to establish a
mechanism on cross-strait recognition of academic credits.
</P>
<P>
Regarding the EMBA programs set up in China by several Taiwan
colleges, Wu said that progress has been good, noting that the
schools can now recruit students other than Taiwan businesspeople
operating in China and the Taiwan executives working for them.

OVER 3,000 EXPECTED TO ATTEND 'TAIWAN REPUBLIC' FLAG-RAISING CEREMONY
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Sept. 6 (CNA)
(By Elizabeth Hsu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Over 3,000 pro-independence activists are
expected to attend the "Taiwan Republic national flag-raising"
ceremony slated for Thursday in front of the Presidential Office, the
convener of the 908 Taiwan Republic Movement said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Wang Hsien-chi made the prediction at a news conference for the
upcoming activity, which will be held to mark what he called "Taiwan
Independence Day, " which falls on Sept. 8 -- the date that Japan
gave up its territorial claims to Taiwan after signing a peace treaty
with the Allied nations in San Francisco in 1951.
</P>
<P>
Wang said that his group hopes that a new "Taiwan Republic"
constitution can be promulgated and that the movement to rectify the
name of Taiwan can achieve its goal by 2008.
</P>
<P>
He urged those who support the campaign to join the Sept. 8
flag-raising ceremony, which he described as "the first of its kind
in 400 years."
</P>
<P>
Wang also mentioned that five young people will read a statement
of the Taiwan Republic Movement in five different languages,
including Mandarin, Taiwanese, Hakka, English and one of the
languages of Taiwan's aboriginal tribes, at the flag-raising event to
mark the official beginning of the independence movement.
</P>
<P>
Wang said he hopes the next president of Taiwan will announce the
promulgation of the new "Taiwan Constitution" at the time when he or
she officially assumes office in 2008, and that by that time, Taiwan
can submit an application for a seat in the United Nations under the
name of "Taiwan," he said.
</P>
<P>
The opposition Taiwan Solitary Union and the Taiwan Association
of University Professors have said they will send representatives to
take part in the flag-raising ceremony, according to Wang.

SUBMARINE SUCCESSFULLY TORPEDOES TARGET FRIGATE IN ANNUAL DRILL
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Sept. 6 (CNA)
(BY S.C. Chang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As an ROC submarine successfully torpedoed
a target vessel in the sea southwest of Taiwan Tuesday, ROC Navy
Commander-in-Chief Chen Pang-chih stood up and applauded the roughly
800 officers and sailors participating in this year's "Whale Hunting
Torpedo Firing Exercise."
</P>
<P>
Chen said that owing to quite a number of variables at the scene,
it was not easy to hit the target from a submarine as even
sophisticated weapons are difficult to maneuver.
</P>
<P>
The fifth "Whale Hunting" torpedo ever fired by the ROC Navy hit
the central part of the target ship, which was not carrying any fuel
or explosives, rupturing the hull and sinking it.
</P>
<P>
The whole process was broadcast live by the Chungshan Institute
of Science and Technology, a research body run by the Ministry of
National Defense.
</P>
<P>
The ROC Navy Fleet Headquarters said the exercise was aimed at
testing the submariners' abilities, the commanders' tactical skills
with torpedoes and the efficacy of the weapons.
</P>
<P>
Two submarines took part in the demonstration, but only one of
them fired at the target ship.
</P>
<P>
During a recent joint air force and navy nighttime exercise,
dubbed "Han Kuang No. 21, " submarines also succeeded in firing
torpedoes that passed a fleet of ships before hitting their targets
5,000 meters away.
</P>
<P>
Chen said Tuesday's exercise was not a military public relations
activity to convince lawmakers of the importance of buying more
submarines for the country. A special budget bill for a major arms
purchase from the United States is still languishing in the
legislature.
</P>
<P>
However, Chen used the opportunity to stress that submarines are
a very effective deterrent, adding that Taiwan also needs
anti-submarine aircraft to ensure the safety of its shipping routes
as the enemy has improved silent running technology on its
submarines.
</P>
<P>
Naval headquarters said China's submarines far outnumber those of
Taiwan, posing a threat to sea traffic around the island. If the navy
can acquire eight more submarines, as proposed by the government in
its U.S. procurement package, the navy will be able to increase the
risks and uncertainty for the Chinese navy.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, when the ROC Navy is capable of deterring China's naval
actions, the business sector will be reassured of the country's
investment environment, the navy added.

PREMIER HSIEH STILL PONDERING RESIGNATIONS OF TWO OFFICIALS
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Sept.  6 (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Premier Frank Hsieh said Tuesday that he
will wait until all the facts are in regarding a recent riot by Thai
laborers before he decides what to do with the resignations tendered
by two top officials who are trying to shoulder responsibility for
the incident.
</P>
<P>
The resignations of Council of Labor Affairs Chairwoman Chen Chu
and acting Kaohsiung Mayor Chen Chi-mai have put the premier in a
cleft stick as he wants to properly assign political responsibility,
but doesn't want to dismiss important officials whose direct
connection with the riot is questionable.
</P>
<P>
Thais working on the Kaohsiung mass rapid transit system rioted
Aug. 21 over poor housing and living conditions and a failure to give
them their human rights.
</P>
<P>
During a visit to the Hsinchu Science-based Industrial Park,
Hsieh called on the public not to encourage a culture of "the more
you do, the more mistakes you make" that will scare away competent
and responsible people from serving in government.
</P>
<P>
He also asked the people not to demand somebody's head
immediately after a scandal erupts, a move that he said will blur the
focus of the issue.
</P>
<P>
Hsieh praised Chen Chu for being a "brave and responsible"
Cabinet member who has made a great contribution to the government.
If such a good minister leaves the government because of unreasonable
pressure, it will be "a loss for society," he added.
</P>
<P>
He said that he had told both Chens to calm down since
speculation on the incident has caused people to lose sight of the
critical points at issue.
</P>
<P>
For example, he said the media is demanding to know how the
decision was made to build the Kaohsiung MRT as a BOT (build, operate
and transfer) project? Moreover, why has the government invested
NT$150 billion, only to hand over the project to the private sector
without ever thinking of controlling the process by itself?
</P>
<P>
He said the central issues here are: who made that critical
decision and when? "These critical issues have not been discussed, "
he claimed, noting that all the answers actually can be found in
official documents.
</P>
<P>
As to the political responsibility for the fiasco, he said both
Chens have some "responsibility of supervision, " but to what extent
should they be held accountable has yet to be determined. He said he
will wait for the report that will determine the administrative
responsibility of all officials related to the incident before
deciding whether to accept their requests to quit.

ACTING KAOHSIUNG MAYOR APOLOGIZES OVER THAI LABORER RIOT
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Sept.  6 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Acting Kaohsiung Mayor Chen Chi-mai on
Tuesday apologized to the public over the controversy triggered by a
recent riot by Thai laborers working for the southern port city's
mass rapid transit (MRT) system.
</P>
<P>
Chen was several times choked with emotion when he read a
statement at a news conference held at the city government, stressing
that the ordeal he had been through since the Aug. 21 riot was
greater than he had originally expected. He left after reading the
statement without responding to any questions.
</P>
<P>
Chen said that after the riot, he had offered to resign verbally
to Premier Frank Hsieh Aug. 28 and tendered his resignation to the
Executive Yuan Aug. 30 to shoulder his political responsibility as
city head.
</P>
<P>
In order not to affect the progress of the construction work, the
city government asked the Kaohsiung Rapid Transit Corp. (KRTC) -- the
employers of the Thai laborers -- to improve the living conditions,
end its contract with Huapan Co., -- the company in charge of the
management of the Thai laborers, reshuffle the KRTC, resettle the
Thai laborers, and form a task force to investigate the incident.
</P>
<P>
The city government tried to solve the problem without dancing to
the tune of wild speculation, Chen said.
</P>
<P>
On some reports alleging that his father, Chen Che-nan, a former
Presidential Office deputy secretary-general, was involved in the
lucrative introduction of Thai laborers for the KRTC, this was
hurtful and unbearable, he said.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that his integrity can be examined over the past
decade in politics, and that he and his family would not profit from
their duties.
</P>
<P>
He also said that he was "disheartened" to read reports that a
battle line between the two Chens -- meaning himself and Chen Chu,
the chairwoman of the Council of Labor Affairs -- had been drawn to
jockey for position to run as the party's candidate in the 2006
Kaohsiung mayor election, saying that he only had his mind on city
administration at work, and not on the election.
</P>
<P>
Both Chens have offered to resign over the riot in which Thai
laborers vented their anger against what they perceived as harsh
management and poor living conditions.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the legislative caucus of the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party said that both Chens are outstanding members of the
party, and that the Executive Yuan is expected to handle their
resignation offers properly.
</P>
<P>
William Lai, a DPP caucus whip in the legislature, also expressed
the hope that reports will not relate their resignation to factional
fighting within the DPP or the mayoral election.

THAI WORKERS IN TAIWAN WIRE US$400 MILLION BACK HOME IN 2004
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Bangkok,  Sept. 6 (CNA)
(By Wu Hsie-chang &amp; Elizabeth Hsu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Thais working in Taiwan wired around 16.2
billion baht (US$400 million) back to their country in 2004,
according to statistics released Tuesday by the Thai Farmer Research
Center.
</P>
<P>
The tallies show the number of Thais applying for work in Taiwan
decreased over the past few years. In 2000, there were over 100,000
Thais working in Taiwan; the amount dropped to 94,000 in 2001, 79,000
in 2002, 75,000 in 2003, and further to 69,000 last year. The amount
of money the Thais wired home also fell from 25 billion baht in 2000.
Despite that, Taiwan was still the largest market for Thai labor
exports.
</P>
<P>
The center also estimated that from January to July, the number
of Thais working on the island stood at 28,000. The laborers remitted
near five billion baht to Thailand during that period, it said,
noting that over 100,000 households are dependant on the money for
survival.
</P>
<P>
Regarding a recent call by Thai Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra
for the Thai laborers to return home after the riot by Thai laborers
working for the Kaohsiung rapid transit line projects Aug. 21 in
protest against poor living condition, center researchers warned that
if all the laborers in Taiwan return home and stayed, their need to
find work would be a big burden for Thailand. Thailand's unemployment
would worsen, while over 1,000 employment brokerage companies would
also be affected, they added.

PRESIDENT CHEN HAS NO JAPAN LAYOVER PLAN: TOP AIDE

<TEXT>
<P>
ROC President Chen Shui-bian has no plan to
make a transit stop in Japan during his upcoming Central America
diplomatic tour, his chief of staff said Tuesday in Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
Yu Shyi-kun, secretary-general to the president, made the remarks
at a news conference held after his meeting with Tokyo Governor
Shintaro Ishihara.
</P>
<P>
Fielding questions from Japanese reporters on whether he would
take advantage of his current trip to arrange for President Chen to
make a layover in Japan on his way to Central America later this
month, Yu said, the speculation is groundless.
</P>
<P>
"Chen would probably make a transit stop in the United States en
route to Central America and he has no Japan layover plans," Yu said.
</P>
<P>
Yu arrived in Tokyo Monday to attend a Taiwan-Japan forum on
relations between the two countries as well as Asia-Pacific regional
security and economic integration. Yu is the highest-ranking Taiwan
official ever to attend a public event in Japan since Tokyo switched
diplomatic recognition from Taipei to Beijing in 1972.
</P>
<P>
President Chen is scheduled to travel to Nicaragua later this
month to attend a summit meeting with the top leaders of Taiwan's
allies in Central America and visit several Caribbean countries.

PRESIDENT COMMENTS ON OPPOSITION BLOCKING ARMS PROCUREMENT BILL
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Sept.  6 (CNA)
(By Luis Huang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President Chen Shui-bian expressed deep
regret Tuesday over continued efforts by opposition parties to block
an arms procurement draft bill, saying that opposition legislators
have boycotted the bill more than 26 times.
</P>
<P>
Chen made the remarks while meeting with American Heritage
Foundation Chairman Edwin Jr. Feulner at the Presidential Office.
</P>
<P>
The president told his guest that he has publicly spoken for the
proposed arms procurement more than 80 times since he was sworn
in for his second four-year term on May 20, 2004.
</P>
<P>
It is regrettable that the opposition "pan-blue alliance" of the
Kuomintang (KMT) and the People First Party (PFP) have continually
filibustered the draft statute governing an arms procurement package
submitted by the Executive Yuan last year to the legislature for
deliberation, Chen said.
</P>
<P>
In a goodwill gesture to opposition parties, Chen pointed out
that the government has made pragmatic adjustments to the required
outlay for several items in the package by listing Patriot
anti-missile batteries in the regular budget instead of the
originally proposed special budget.
</P>
<P>
Referring to recent remarks by Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang
Jin-pyng, a KMT heavyweight, that the legislature should begin to
deal with the arms procurement bill when the new legislative session
formally opens Sept. 13, Chen said he would be happy to see such a
positive development of the issue.
</P>
<P>
In the face of China's rise, especially its military expansion,
Taiwan must beef up its self-defense capabilities, Chen stressed. He
also thanked U.S. President George W. Bush for having approved
the sale of a package of advanced weaponry to Taiwan to help upgrade
the island's defense capabilities.
</P>
<P>
The arms procurement package includes eight diesel-electric
submarines, six Patriot PAC III anti-missile batteries and a squadron
of 12 P-3C anti-submarine aircraft. The budget plan for the
procurement has been blocked for two consecutive legislative sessions
due to opposition from the opposition "pan-blue alliance, " which
holds a slim majority in the 225-seat legislature.
</P>
<P>
Over the past five years, the KMT and the PFP have used their
slim majority in the legislature to boycott various policy
initiatives launched by the government.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Chen also expressed again his sympathies to
families of those who were killed by Hurricane Katrina in the
southern U.S. states, saying that he immediately extended his concern
to Mississippi State Governor Haley Barbour after he learned about
the devastating natural disaster.
</P>
<P>
On behalf of the Taiwan people, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs
donated US$2 million to the United States last Friday for the relief
of victims of the hurricane.

FOREIGN OFFICIALS IN KENYA TO NEGOTIATE RELEASE OF TAIWNESE SHIPS
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Sept.  6 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Minister of Foreign Affairs Tan Sun Chen
said Tuesday that officials sent by his ministry have traveled to
Kenya to communicate with Somalian rebels who have held three Taiwan
fishing vessels since mid-August for a ransom of US$1.5 million.
</P>
<P>
"It is hoped that after two or three days, we'll have news that
the public will like to hear," Chen said.
</P>
<P>
The three fishing boats -- the Kaohsiung-based "Chungyi No. 218,"
the Hsiaoliuchiu-based "Hsinlienfa No. 36" and the "Chengchingfeng"
-- have not been in contact since they entered a Somalian fishing
port Aug. 16 for refueling and maintenance.
</P>
<P>
The three hijacked boats have 13 Chinese crewmen, 14 Indonesians,
12 Filipinos and four Vietnamese.
</P>
<P>
The shipowners later came to learn that the three ships had been
hijacked by Somalian insurgents and appealed to the foreign ministry
Aug. 24 for assistance.
</P>
<P>
Chen said that the government is very concerned about the safety
of the three ships and its crew members, adding that President Chen
Shui-bian had inquired about the situation several times, and that
the ministry also sent officials to Kenya. The ministry also
contacted the families of the crew members to keep them abreast of
the rescue operation.
</P>
<P>
He said that as the matter involves personal safety, the ministry
cannot reveal how it is negotiating with the insurgents, adding that
the ministry understands the emotional response of the families of
the crew being held hostage.
</P>
<P>
The ministry is exhausting every channel in its attempt to rescue
the sailors, and is soliciting assistance from relevant governments,
international organizations and the nation's missions to Europe and
Africa, as well as sending officials to Kenya for better
communications.
</P>
<P>
So far, the ministry has learned that "the ship and the personnel
are safe," he added.
</P>
<P>
Foreign affairs ministry spokesman Michel Lu said that rebels
from one of the five warlords of Somalia took the Taiwanese ships.
Four ships have been taken by Somalian rebels so far, showing that
the rebels are not only targeting Taiwan ships.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the central government, five warlords and Muslim
elders are the major forces in Somalia, he said that negotiations
are very complicated and require great patience.
</P>
<P>
He said the aim of negotiations is to ensure the personnel safety
and their release without having to pay ransom, and even if ransom
is paid, it should be kept to a minimum as long as the hostages are
safe and sound.

PRESIDENT CALLS FOR POLITICAL  LEADERS MEETING
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Sept.  6 (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President Chen Shui-bian called on the
nation's political leaders Tuesday to sit down as soon as possible
and talk about major issues facing the country.
</P>
<P>
Meeting commissioners of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission
(OCAC) at the Presidential Office, Chen said uniting Taiwan and
normalizing cross-Taiwan Strait relations are two major issues that
call for an early solution.
</P>
<P>
He admitted that it's getting more and more difficult to promote
cross-strait policy, noting that the crux of the problem is not
China's pressure, but Taiwan's own disunity.
</P>
<P>
"If there is only one voice in Taiwan, the other side [China]
will have to deal with the government; if our voices are discordant
-- if there are only politicians vying to concede to the other side
because of election calculations or personal agendas, allowing China
to drive a wedge in Taiwan society by striking at the government and
weakening Taiwan -- this absolutely will not serve the interests of
the 23 million people in Taiwan," Chen said.
</P>
<P>
He said cross-strait exchanges are not a zero-sum game or an all-
or-nothing choice. "We must not restrain ourselves by supposing that
China does not exist, such that we need not have anything to do with
it," he said.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, he continued, "We cannot harbor any illusions
about China, thinking that by bowing low we will win some favor from
it. Nor can we echo China's tunes, forcing the government to make one
concession after another to it."
</P>
<P>
Chen criticized "a certain party's chairman" for promising to
realize the goal of "opening up three links with China" if and when
his party wins back power in 2008.
</P>
<P>
Shifting the whole responsibility to not opening up the three
links with China on the government, trying to make this an election
issue, is a "severe distortion of the facts" and "an act of placing
partisan interests above national interests, " Chen accused, adding
that this is a "very dangerous" move.
</P>
<P>
The president claimed that the biggest stumbling block to the
three links between Taiwan and China is not Taiwan, but China,
because China insists that Taiwan accept its "one China" principle
before any talks can be held.
</P>
<P>
He claimed that if Taiwan accepts China's "one China" principle
or "one country, two systems" formula in order to negotiate terms of
opening up the three links, Taiwan would be losing ground and
totally surrendering to China, and downgrading itself to the level of
a regional government of China.
</P>
<P>
He said he believes that such harsh conditions for opening up the
three links with China will not be accepted by whichever political

In order to forge a consensus on and avoid over-politicizing
cross-strait policy issues, he said in his inaugural speech last
year that he had called for a political party leaders meeting to form
a "Cross-strait Peace and Development Commission" and to draft
"Guidelines for Cross-strait Peace and Development."

He said more than a year has elapsed since that time, and now he
would like to urge party leaders again to sit down and discuss a way

OFFICIAL DEFENDS REJECTION OF ACCREDITATION OF CHINSE SCHOOLS
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Sept.  6 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An education official defended President
Chen Shui-bian's rejection of accreditation to Chinese schools
Tuesday, saying it meets the expectation of most local universities.
</P>
<P>
Vice Education Minister Fan Sun-lu said most of Taiwan's
universities and colleges didn't want her ministry to give
accreditation to Chinese schools out of concerns it would make it
even harder to find enough students.
</P>
<P>
She also dismissed as a "political gambit" China's move this year
to reduce tuition and fees imposed on Taiwan students to the same
level as that for Chinese students.
</P>
<P>
Fan cast doubts on China's measures, saying they are designed to
attract Taiwan students, but probably will not be enforced honestly
and Taiwan students might not be treated the same as their Chinese
counterparts in terms of studying. 
</P>
<P>
She said Taiwan's high education is excellent and recognized
around the world and her ministry has urged local universities to
cooperate with foreign schools to broaden students' horizons through
education, adding that local students should be confident in the
quality of local education.
</P>
<P>
She made the comments after President Chen said on Sunday that he
will not give accreditation to Chinese schools as long as he is in
office to ensure local universities can get enough students.
</P>
<P>
Chen's announcement prompted criticism to the effect that the
president should withdraw accreditation to foreign universities by
the same token although that would only spoil local universities and
downgrade their teaching levels.

PRESIDENT'S CHIEF OF STAFF VISITS TOKYO GOVERNOR
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Tokyo,  Sept.  6 (CNA)
(By Mike Chang &amp; Elizabeth Hsu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The chief of staff to President Chen
Shui-bian paid a courtesy visit to Tokyo Governor Shintaro Ishihara
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Expressing his joy at visiting an old friend, Yu Shyi-kun
extended his gratitude to Ishihara for promoting tourism to Taiwan.
Thanks to Ishihara recommendation, Yu said, the number of Japanese
people who traveled to Taiwan for sightseeing from January to August
grew nearly 40 percent over the level of the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
During the 40-minute meeting, they exchanged opinions on a
wide range of issues, including Taiwan's constitutional reform and
national security. Yu made the visit in the company of national
policy adviser to the president Yeh Kuo-hsing, ROC Representative to
Japan Koh Se-kai and several officials of the representative office.
</P>
<P>
At a news conference after the meeting, Yu said he told Ishihara
he feels regret over Beijing's decision to withdraw from the "Asian
Network of Major Cities 21 (ANMA) " -- an organization set up under
the initiation of the Tokyo metropolitan governor in 2001 -- in
protest against Taipei's participation.
</P>
<P>
Both Taiwan and Japan are willing to contribute to regional peace
and stability, Yu said, noting that Taiwan would like to be more
involved in international activities.
</P>
<P>
Yu arrived in Japan Monday for the 2005 Taiwan-Japan Forum that
opened in Tokyo Tuesday. As secretary-general to the president, Yu is
the highest-ranking ROC official ever to attend a public event in
Japan since Tokyo switched diplomatic recognition to Beijing from
Taipei in 1972.
</P>
<P>
The Taiwan-Japan Forum is being co-sponsored by the Taipei-based
Foundation on International and Cross-Strait Studies and the World
Peace Research Institute of Japan.
</P>
<P>
The theme of this year's forum will focus on new situations in
Asia and possible responsible strategies to address changes. Topics
will include regional security, economic integration and cooperation,
as well as prospects for Taiwan-Japan relations.
</P>
<P>
Most of the forum activities are closed-door meetings, with the
exception of a seminar scheduled for Sept. 7 that will be open to the
media. Yu and former Japanese Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone will
attend the seminar.
</P>
<P>
Yu is scheduled to return to Taipei Sept. 9.

`NO LEGITIMACY' TO SHUT TAIWAN OUT OF WHO: FOREIGN MINISTRY
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei, Sept. 6 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There is no legitimacy for the World Health
Organization (WHO) to shut Taiwan out of the world health body, a
spokesman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Michel Lu, director-general of MOFA's Department of Culture and
Information, made the remarks when he addressed 250 people from more
than 20 countries participating in the international Rotary Youth
Leadership Awards (RYLA) on the fourth day of a seven-day camp.
</P>
<P>
The RYLA originated in Australia in 1959. It is a training
program for youths aged 20-30 aimed at emphasizing leadership,
citizenship and personal growth.
</P>
<P>
In a speech titled "The Republic of China (Taiwan) : A Story of
Success, " Lu touched on the issues of the globalization of Taiwan,
international participation, international competition and Taiwan's
non-governmental organizations.
</P>
<P>
For the sake of the health of the 23 million people of Taiwan,
and out of a desire to contribute on health issues, Taiwan has been
trying to join the WHO, Lu said, adding that the charter of the WHO
states that it wants all people to receive the highest possible level
of health.
</P>
<P>
Lu said that the right to health is a basic human right and
Taiwan wants to become an observer of the WHO so as to contribute to
world health cooperation. It is dangerous to exclude Taiwan from a
global outbreak alert and response network (GOARN) under the WHO, he
added.
</P>
<P>
He said China has opposed Taiwan's participation in the WHO due
to political confrontation and the WHO has agreed to shut Taiwan out
of the organization, which he claimed is not true to the law,
unprofessional and lacks moral legitimacy.

KMT LEADER UNFAMILIAR WITH CHINESE AFFAIRS: MAC CHIEF
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei, Sept. 6 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Opposition Kuomintang Chairman Ma
Ying-jeou, who has served a two-year stint as vice minister of the
Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) from 1991 to 1993, is "probably
unfamiliar" with Chinese affairs, MAC
Minister Joseph Wu alleged Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Citing Ma's statement made Sept. 3 that direct transport links
with China can be launched within two years if the KMT is elected to
power in the 2008 presidential election, Wu said Ma "obviously" does
not understand that China is quite rigid in terms of the conditions
it imposes for such links.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan's efforts to build up trust with China by pushing for
bilateral negotiations on opening passenger charter flights and cargo
charter flights across the Taiwan Strait is more pragmatic, Wu
claimed.
</P>
<P>
According to Wu, his department has worked out a comprehensive
plan for the negotiations and is pushing for it step by step.
</P>
<P>
However, he admitted that passenger charter flights for the
forthcoming Mid-autumn Festival, which falls on Sept. 19, might not
be possible because of China's lukewarm response to Taiwan's request
for negotiations.
</P>
<P>
He denied that a group of private tourism operators who headed
for Xiamen Tuesday for a tourism exhibition will talk with the
Chinese authorities about China's decision to allow more Chinese
people to visit Taiwan, saying such talks need government
authorization.
</P>
<P>
The MAC chief, who made the comments at a seminar about exchanges
among Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macao, ended his statement with a warning
that Taiwan people are increasingly feeling China's hostility toward
them.
</P>
<P>
This trend remains intact despite the trips to China made by the
leaders of opposition Kuomintang and People First Party in April and
May, respectively, because the Chinese pressure on the country is so
persistent, Wu said.

KMT CAUCUS TO SUE GOVERNMENT AGENCIES FOR NEGLIGENCE
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Kaohsiung,  Sept. 6 (CNA)
(By Han Nai-kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The caucus of the opposition Kuomintang
(KMT) at the Kaohsiung city council claimed Tuesday that it is in
possession of evidence about a scandal that prompted the Aug. 21 riot
by Thai laborers working on greater Kaohsiung's rapid transit system
and will sue the relevant government agencies for negligence.
</P>
<P>
Chuang Chi-wang, convener of the KMT caucus, said the caucus will
file a lawsuit with the District Attorney's Office against the
Council of Labor Affairs and the Labor Bureau of the Kaohsiung city
government for "serious negligence of duty."
</P>
<P>
He added that another suit will be filed against the Kaohsiung
Rapid Transit Corp. (KTRC) for falsifying documents and illegal
transfer of benefits.
</P>
<P>
Chuang claimed that the lawsuits are not politically motivated
but are intended to safeguard the interests of all the residents of
Kaohsiung.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Wu Yi-cheng, a Kaohsiung city councilor of the
opposition People First Party, introduced a motion calling on the
speaker of the City Council to convene a special session Sept. 12 to
discuss the scandal and the political storm faced by the KTRC and
relevant government agencies. By late Tuesday, more than 20 city
councilors had endorsed the motion.
</P>
<P>
According to the city council's rules, a motion requesting a
special session must be submitted at least 10 days before the target
date of the meeting, except for important issues that need urgent
attention.
</P>
<P>
Wu said the riot by Thai workers is an important issue because it
has caused serious damage to Taiwan's global image. In addition, he
said, it is necessary for the city council to establish the cause of
the riot and find out who are responsible for the inhumane treatment
of the Thai laborers, so that similar incidents will not happen
again.
</P>
<P>
The riot occurred at the living quarters of some 1,700 Thai
workers in Kaohsiung County when about 100 of them set fire to a
dormitory building and a management office in protest of their poor
living conditions and harsh restrictions placed on them. The fire
caused NT$10 million-worth of property damage.

AVERAGE HOUSEHOLD SAVINGS DROP TO NEW LOW: DGBAS
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Sept. 6 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taiwan's average household savings dropped
to a new low of NT$198,600 (US$6,304.76) in 2004, according to the
results of a survey released by the Cabinet-level Directorate General
of Budget, Accounting and Statistics (DGBAS) Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
It was the lowest figure since 1993, when the average household
savings recorded in a similar survey stood at NT$223,752.
</P>
<P>
DGBAS officials attributed the decrease mainly to an increase in
household consumption.
</P>
<P>
According to the DGBAS report on domestic annual household income
and consumption over the past decade, the average household income
amounted to NT$1.12 million last year, up 1 percent from the 2003
level.
</P>
<P>
Over the past decade, the report said, the annual growth rate of
the domestic household income averaged 1.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
The household income and expenditure survey collects detailed
information about the expenditure, income and household
characteristics of a sample of households around the country.
</P>
<P>
The general goals for conducting the survey are to identify the
net levels and patterns of expenditure of local private households on
a comprehensive range of goods and services purchased for private
use, and to determine how these levels and patterns vary according to
income levels and other characteristics of households, such as size
and composition, location and principal sources of cash income.
</P>
<P>
Of the 2004 average household income, salary accounted for the
lion's share of 55.3 percent, down 3 percentage points from the 1994
ratio.
</P>
<P>
According to the DGBAS survey, the average disposable household
income was about NT$891,000 up 1.1 percent from the 2003 level, and
the growth rate for the past decade averaged 1.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
The DGBAS report further said the average household expenditure
amounted to NT$693,000 in 2004, up 3.9 percent from the year-earlier
level. The annual growth rate averaged 2.4 percent for the past
decade.
</P>
<P>
Of the household expenditure, dwelling-related spending,
including rent, utilities, furniture and household management,
accounted for 26.8 percent, while spending on food and non-alcoholic
beverages made up 23.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
With household consumption rising, the average household savings
have declined steadily over the past decade. Nevertheless, the figure
remained positive, indicating that local households have continued to
accumulate wealth during the period.
</P>
<P>
The survey also found that the composition of local households
has changed, with young members moving out to form nuclear families.
As a result, the number of local households increased from 5.57
million in 1994 to 7.08 million in 2004, while the average number of
members of each household dropped from 4.02 to 3.5. Against this
backdrop, per capita savings still registered a marginal 0.2 percent
increase over the past decade.

TOKYO GOVERNOR ARRIVES IN TAIPEI TO DISCUSS ANMC 21
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei, Sept. 6 (CNA)
(By Luis Huang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Tokyo Governor Shintaro Ishihara arrived in
Taiwan Tuesday for a four-day visit to discuss the repercussions of
Beijing's abrupt withdrawal from the Asian Network of Major Cities 21
(ANMC 21) and its annual meetings.
</P>
<P>
During his stay in Taiwan, Ishihara will meet with President Chen
Shui-bian and Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou to exchange views on
Beijing's withdrawal from the ANMC 21, a forum for the mayors of
major Asian cities that hope to "take the lead in the 21st Century."
</P>
<P>
Founded in Tokyo in October 2001 by Ishihara, the ANMC 21 now has
12 member cities -- Bangkok, Beijing, New Delhi, Hanoi, Jakarta,
Kuala Lumpur, Manila, Seoul, Singapore, Taipei, Tokyo and Yangon,
with the aim of boosting prosperity and development of Asia in the
21st century. The 12 cities have since taken turns hosting the ANMC
21 annual meetings.
</P>
<P>
Taipei began to bid to host the 2005 ANMC 21 meeting in July
2004, but Beijing entered the race against Taipei for the hosting
right only a few days before the Nov. 22-23, 2004 Jakarta meeting,
simply because the Beijing authorities did not want to see Taipei
play any significant role in the forum.
</P>
<P>
In a vote to choose between Taipei and Beijing, Beijing beat
Taipei 7-4, but was one vote shy of the two-thirds needed to win the
right to host the annual meeting.
</P>
<P>
In the ensuing negotiations, all of the meeting attendees except
Beijing's representative agreed that the 2005 meeting would be hosted
by Beijing, with Taipei getting the priority right to host the 2006
meeting.
</P>
<P>
When the chairman of the meeting announced the results of the
negotiations, Beijing's representative walked out in protest. Beijing
has since refused to endorse the "Jakarta Declaration" issued by the
2004 ANMC 21 meeting regarding the sponsorship for the 2005 and 2006
meetings.
</P>
<P>
Ishihara himself has also asked Beijing to sign the joint
statement over the past 10 months. Nevertheless, Beijing informed
Tokyo Aug. 30 that it decided to withdraw from the ANMC 21. Because
of Beijing's withdrawal, the holding of the 2005 ANMC 21 annual
meeting is now facing various uncertainties, including whether the
2005 ANMC meeting will be held or not.
</P>
<P>
Ishihara's current visit to Taiwan is his fifth since assuming
the Tokyo governorship in April 1999. He was in Taipei in May 2004 to
attend President Chen's inauguration for a second four-year term and
he was again in Taipei in October the same year at the invitation of
the Taiwan Railway Administration. He visited central Taiwan shortly 
after the island was struck by a deadly earthquake on Sept. 21, 1999.

MANUFACTURERS ENCOURAGED TO INCREASE INVESTMENT IN CENTRAL AMERICA
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Sept.  6 (CNA)
(By Luis Huang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Cabinet-level Council for Economic
Planning and Development (CEPD) urged Taiwanese businessmen Tuesday
to invest in Central America, saying that the region is expected to
offer plenty of trade opportunities after the formation of a planned
Free Trade Area of the Americas (FTAA).
</P>
<P>
Following the adoption of a U.S.-Central America Free Trade
Agreement by the U.S. Congress in July 2004, the United States has
been working on integrating the economies of the Americas into a
single free trade area, according to a report on the American
economic and trade integration issued by the CEPD's Overall Planning
Department.
</P>
<P>
As the 34 American countries, including the United States and
Canada, will be integrated into the world's largest economic and
trade community in the near future, Taiwanese manufacturers should
take advantage of every opportunity to make inroads into the unique
market, a CEPD official said.
</P>
<P>
After the establishment of the FTAA, its gross domestic product
(GDP) will reach US$14.8 trillion, accounting for 40 percent of the
global total GDP, while its foreign trade volume will hit US$3.9
trillion, making up 21.4 percent of the total volume of global trade,
and its population will be 880 million, or 13.8 percent of the global
total population, the official noted.
</P>
<P>
The official said that thanks to the global economic recovery,
Central American and Caribbean economies are growing steadily, adding
that based upon a research report released by the International
Monetary Fund, Central American nations' GDP will increase at least
1.5 percent after the formation of the FTAA.
</P>
<P>
Central American and Caribbean economic growth rates for 2005 are
forecast to reach 3.3 percent and 4.2 percent, respectively, the
official pointed out, adding that their annual average growth rates
for the next 10 years are estimated at 3.2 percent and 3.8 percent,
respectively, higher than the United States' 3 percent and the
European Union's 2 percent.
</P>
<P>
The government has been working on forging free trade agreements
(FTAs) with Central American countries in an effort to boost
bilateral economic and trade relations, the official pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Bilateral talks for signing a Taiwan-Guatemala FTA were completed
in late August and the two nations are expected to ink a formal FTA
in the near future, while Taiwan-Nicaragua FTA negotiations will also
be completed soon. In addition, Honduras and El Salvador have
expressed the intention to sign FTAs with Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Panama was the first country to ink an FTA with Taiwan to boost
bilateral trade exchanges. Since the agreement came into force in
Janaury 2004, two-way trade has posted a phenomenal growth of 111.8
percent.

<P>
The Council of Labor Affairs (CLA) under
the Cabinet pledged Tuesday that it will propose an amendment of the
Employment Services Act within two months to improve the treatment of
foreign laborers in Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Senior CLA officials made the promise during a meeting with
representatives from labor movements and human rights groups who
expressed concern about the poor treatment of foreign workers exposed
by the Aug. 21 riot of Thai laborers working on Kaohsiung's rapid
transit railway system.
</P>
<P>
The officials said that the planned amendment would permit the
government to hire foreign laborers without using brokers, allow
foreign workers to switch to a different employer from the one they
apply to work for when they enter Taiwan, and remove the limitation
on the number of years a foreign laborer is allowed to stay in
Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Currently foreign laborers are allowed to work in Taiwan for a
maximum of six years.

PREMIER TO DEFEND HANDLING OF THAI RIOT ON TV
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Sept. 6 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Premier Frank Hsieh will defend on TV his
administration's handling of the riot of Thai workers in Kaohsiung
after two members of his Cabinet tendered their resignations to take
responsibility for the incident.
</P>
<P>
The premier told journalists after emerging from a meeting of the
Central Standing Committee of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party
in Hsinchu City that he will air the administration's side of the
story in an interview with TVBS Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Hsieh said the offers of resignation by Mainland Affairs Council
Minister Chen Chu and the acting Kaohsiung Mayor Chen Chih-mai should
be seen in a favorable light, but unfortunately the opposition has
presented them in a bad light, turning what was supposed to
demonstrate a Cabinet member's integrity into inter-party strife.
</P>
<P>
The premier had said the previous day that he will hold off a
decision on the resignations until the responsibility for the riot
has been ascertained by an investigation.
</P>
<P>
The Thai workers introduced to work on the construction of the
Kaohsiung Rapid Transit System rioted Aug. 21 to protest
ill-treatment by their management company and bad living conditions.
</P>
<P>
Hsieh's administration came under fire for the riot, which the
opposition said is only the tip of the iceberg betraying a major
labor scandal involving political heavyweights.
</P>
<P>
Hsieh told journalists after the DPP meeting that the rapid
transit system construction plan was laid down under the previous
Kuomintang government and that his administration was only executing
it. If there were any irregularities involved in the plan, the KMT
policy makers at the time should be called to account for them.
</P>
<P>
Mentioning the name of former KMT Kaohsiung mayor Wu Deng-yi, who
criticized the project on a TV show recently, Hsieh said Wu should
shoulder the lion's share of the responsibility for irregularities,
if any, involved in the plan.
</P>
<P>
He criticized the KMT for trying to divert public attention from
the workers' riot to the transit system program, as if they are
innocent, in defiance of the fact that the program was set up by the
party itself.
</P>
<P>
The premier said he was sure the public will "see through these
groundless allegations" once they have "learned the truth" from his
TV interview.

occurred on this date in the past:



1533: Elizabeth I, Queen of England and Ireland who succeeded the

Her reign was marked by the execution of Mary Queen of Scots in 1587,
the defeat of the Spanish Armada in 1588, and domestic prosperity and
literary achievement.

GOV'T TO DEAL PRUDENTLY WITH ISSUE OF OIL, ELECTRICITY PRICE HIKES
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei, Sept. 7 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Premier Frank Hsieh said Wednesday that the
government will deal with the issue of oil and electricity price
hikes prudently and avoid sharp increases.
</P>
<P>
The premier made the remarks in an Executive Yuan floor meeting
in which the situation of soaring international oil prices and rising
domestic consumer prices was reviewed.
</P>
<P>
The consumer price index (CPI) rose 3.56 percent in August on a
year-to-year basis, which is a record high since December 1998,
according to statistics released by the Directorate General of
Budget, Accounting and Statistics (DGBAS) under the Executive Yuan.
</P>
<P>
Typhoon Haitang in mid-July and Matsa in early August took a
heavy toll on agriculture, with Haitang alone causing damage
totalling NT$3.6 billion (US$111 million), which is more than the
NT$3.1 billion in damage suffered by the agricultural sector for the
whole of 2004.
</P>
<P>
The premier said the higher-than-expected rise in the consumer
price index was due mainly to the soaring price of fruits and
vegetables in the wake of the two typhoons.
</P>
<P>
Generally speaking, if the CPI increase falls within three
percent, it is considered a modest increase and is tolerable, the
premier said, adding that if it continues to fall or remains
stagnant, it means that the economy is listless.
</P>
<P>
He said that the soaring vegetable and fruit prices triggered by
the typhoons accounts for 0.71 percentage points of the increase in
the consumer price index.
</P>
<P>
The government has adopted necessary measures to stabilize
consumer prices, the premier said.

<P>
The Republic of China's top official in
Brussels said Tuesday that Taiwan must make Europe realize that
developments in the Taiwan Strait situation are not just a regional
issue, but also an issue that could have an impact on the whole
world.
</P>
<P>
Chen Chien-jen, Taiwan's representative to the European Union and
Belgium, made the remarks in the wake of an annual E.U.-China summit,
which was held in Beijing Monday.
</P>
<P>
As several countries in the Asia-Pacific region, including
Australia, Japan, New Zealand and the United States, have expressed
their opposition to the E.U.'s idea of lifting its arms sales ban on
China put in place in 1989, the envoy said that such opposition has
also made the E.U. understand that the ban does not only concern
human rights and bilateral relations between China and the E.U., but
also concerns more and more countries that have viewed a lifting of
the ban as an issue that is related to their own interests.
</P>
<P>
He further said that the enactment of an anti-secession law by
Beijing in March of this year has grabbed more attention from the
E.U. to the cross-strait situation, adding that the E.U. has also
been forced to begin cautiously dealing with matters relating to the
rise of China.
</P>
<P>
"Taiwan must make the E.U. realize that the future developments
in the cross-strait situation will not only affect China and the West
Pacific region, but will also have an impact on Europe, " he said,
adding: "This is a regional issue and also a world issue. "
</P>
<P>
In a joint statement released after the conclusion of Monday's
summit, the E.U. reiterated that the Taiwan issue should be resolved
peacefully through constructive dialogue between the two sides of the
strait.

REPORT ABOUT THAI APPEAL TO U.N. OVER RIOT NOT FACTUAL: MOFA

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A media report saying that Thailand will
appeal to the United Nations over a riot by Thai laborers working for
a mass rapid transit (MRT) system in the southern Taiwan port city of
Kaohsiung is not factual, Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA)
spokesman Michel Lu said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted unidentified Kaohsiung prosecution sources as
saying that the Thai government's plan to file a petition with the
United Nations against Taiwan over the alleged maltreatment of Thai
laborers might impair Taiwan's international image.
</P>
<P>
Lu said the ministry has directed the nation's representative
office in Bangkok to verify the media report.
</P>
<P>
"According to information offered by our representative office,
the report was not erroneous, " Lu said, adding that the MOFA will
keep Thai authorities informed of the latest probes into the Aug. 21
incident through proper channels.
</P>
<P>
The Aug. 21 riot began when several Thai workers returned to
their dormitory after a day off and were barred from bringing in
alcohol and cigarettes. The workers burned cars and battled police
with stones and slingshots. The laborers, who are building
Kaohsiung's MRT system, complained about rigorous management rules
and poor living conditions.

Both Council of Labor Affairs Minister Chen Chu and acting
Kaohsiung Mayor Chen Chi-mai have tendered resignations to assume

ARMS DEAL PROBLEM SHOULD FIRST BE SETTLED BY CABINET: KMT CHAIRMAN
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei, Sept. 7 (CNA)
(By P.C.Tang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Opposition Kuomintang Chairman Ma Ying-jeou
said Wednesday that the Cabinet should first settle the problems
posed in the aftermath of the 2004 referendum if it wants to push for
the passage of a long-stalled arms procurement bill in the
Legislative Yuan.
</P>
<P>
Ma made the remarks while addressing a regular KMT Central
Committee meeting on matters regarding the bill put forward by the
Executive Yuan for legislative approval, according to the party's
spokeswoman Cheng Li-wen.
</P>
<P>
Pointing out that one of the most important items that the
Cabinet wants to buy from the United States is anti-missile
equipment, the KMT head said that in the referendum held in 2004 on
whether the country should strengthen its anti-missile defense
capability, only 45.17 percent of eligible voters cast their ballots,
making the referendum invalid.
</P>
<P>
Ma also said that President Chen Shui-bian had even stressed at
the time that the referendum was more important than the presidential
election, adding that in the wake of the issue relating to the
procurement of anti-missile equipment being vetoed by the people, the
administrative branch must come up with a solution to the problem
posed by the referendum result. "Otherwise, the Legislative Yuan will
be unable to examine the bill without breaking the law," Ma claimed.
</P>
<P>
The arms procurement bill has long been stalled in the
legislature due to opposition from lawmakers of the "pan-blue
alliance" of the Kuomintang and the People First Party.
</P>
<P>
According to the Ministry of National Defense, the items on the
procurement list include eight diesel-powered submarines, six Patriot
PAC III anti-missile batteries and 12 P-3C anti-submarine aircraft.

PRESIDENT ADVOCATES PHASING OUT DEATH PENALTY
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei, Sept. 7 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President Chen Shui-bian expressed the hope
Wednesday that capital punishment will be phased out in Taiwan once
and for all.
</P>
<P>
Chen said that since 2000, when he vowed upon his presidential
inauguration to make Taiwan a "nation of human rights," the country's
criminal code has been revised to change the "sole death punishment"
to "relative death punishment" to allow more room for debate and
consideration before a death sentence is actually handed down in a
case.
</P>
<P>
During an audience at the Presidential Office with visiting
Siobhan Ni Chulachain, vice chairwoman of the International League
for Human Rights, and her delegation, Chen said he hopes that
Taiwan's criminal code will be revised further so that the death
penalty for certain crimes is replaced with life imprisonment to pave
the way for the eventual complete abolishment of capital punishment
in Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Chen reiterated the hope that the death penalty will be used as
sparingly as possible ahead of the complete abolishment of capital
punishment in Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
The president expressed his admiration for the International
League for Human Rights, saying that because of the league's efforts,
at least one country a year has repealed the death penalty in recent
years.
</P>
<P>
Chen recalled that he began to push for the abolishment of
capital punishment when he was an aide to his wife, Wu Shu-jen, when
she was a legislator. However, Taiwan society in general was not
supportive of the abolishment of the death penalty, he said, noting
that up to 80 percent of respondents in a public opinion poll at that
time said they were against it.
</P>
<P>
In the same poll, Chen added, opposition dropped to 40 percent
when respondents were asked what they felt about the death penalty
being abolished if it were accompanied by tougher conditions for
prisoner release.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Chen told his guests that before he became president,
32 people were executed in Taiwan in 1998 and 24 were executed in
1999. The figure dropped to 17 in 2000, the first year of his
presidency, falling further to 10 in 2001, three in 2004, and only
one so far this year, he pointed out.

Government incentives have successfully
helped attract Taiwan businessmen operating in China, known locally

Hsieh claimed Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Citing a series of government incentives, including the "006688
land lease preferential treatment in industrial zones, " Hsieh said,
that these privilege programs have attracted 46 "Taishang" to return
to Taiwan in recent months with their capital, totaling NT$24.1
billion (US$753 million), for various investment projects.
</P>
<P>
These investment projects are poised to create a total of 4,912
jobs, generating production worth some NT$29.5 billion initially,
Hsieh continued.

Hsieh's remarks, made at a regular Executive Yuan meeting, were a

Shui-bian, who said the day before during an audience at the

Chinese Affairs Commission that "Taishang" have nowadays begun to
return home with their funds like "salmon returning to their stream

LEGISLATIVE RIGHT TO APPROVE PREMIER SHOULD BE REINSTATED

<P>
Legislative Yuan President Wang Jin-pyng
said Wednesday that the legislature should be given the power to
exercise the "right of consent" on the president's nomination of the
premier, a power that was taken away when the Constitution was
amended during former President Lee Teng-hui's tenure.
</P>
<P>
In an exclusive interview with CNA, Wang claimed he was making
the call because "many people expect it" and claimed that only when
the legislature is given such power can it effectively check and
balance the Executive Yuan.
</P>
<P>
His remarks were prompted by Premier Frank Hsieh challenging the
opposition parties, which refused to pass his NT$80 billion special
budget bill for flood control, to topple his Cabinet with a motion of
no-confidence.
</P>
<P>
Wang said some conditions have to be met and procedures followed
to topple the Cabinet.
</P>
<P>
He explained that the Constitution stipulates that the premier is
appointed by the president and that when the appointment has been
made, the Constitution does not have clear provisions regarding when
to replace or dismiss a premier.
</P>
<P>
Under the current Constitution, the president can do nothing if
he wants to fire his premier but the premier refuses to step down,
Wang said.
</P>
<P>
Because this is a complex issue, he claimed, "many people" expect
something to be done to restore the Legislative Yuan's power to
approve or reject the president's appointment of the premier, so that
the legislature can better check and balance the Cabinet, which is
led by the premier.

The Department of Health (DOH) is preparing

GOVERNMENT OWES EXPLANATION FOR PURCHASE OF ANTI-MISSILE SYSTEM
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Sept.  7 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The government should deal with a failed
proposal in the country's first nationwide referendum before
discussing the budget for the procurement of Patriot PAC-III
anti-missile batteries, Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with CNA, Wang said this was the consensus he
reached with opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Ma Ying-jeou in a
meeting the previous day.
</P>
<P>
Wang, a former KMT vice chairman, was referring to one of the two
questions asked in the country's first nationwide referendum March
20, 2004 in tandem with the presidential election -- whether the
nation should strength its anti-missile capability.
</P>
<P>
A total of 45.17 percent of more than 16 million eligible voters
cast their ballots in the referendum. Just over 91 percent of those
who participated answered "yes" to the question, but the referendum
was considered invalid because less than half of the eligible voters
participated in the referendum.
</P>
<P>
Wang said the Executive Yuan pulled out all stops to promote the
referendum on anti-missile system, but it was rejected by the public
and the government owes the public an explanation on why a failed
proposal was resubmitted to the legislature.
</P>
<P>
He failed to point out that the opposition "pan-blue alliance" of
the KMT and the People First Party (PFP) also pulled out all the
stops to urge the public not to vote in the referendum.
</P>
<P>
The anti-missile system was included in the Executive Yuan's
proposal to buy three big-ticket weaponry items -- eight
diesel-electric submarines, a squadron of 12 P-3C anti-submarine
aircraft and six Patriot PAC III anti-missile batteries -- from the
United States.
</P>
<P>
The Cabinet made a goodwill response to some opposition
lawmakers' suggestion that part of the procurement package be
financed by the regular defense budget to allow for closer
legislative scrutiny, but the opposition-controlled Legislative Yuan
continued to stonewall the long-stalled arms procurement package
Tuesday, with the legislative procedure committee refusing to put it
on the legislative agenda.
</P>
<P>
Wang said the redrafted arms procurement will "eventually be put
to review " in a consensus with Ma, although the matter will still
respect the views of PFP Chairman James Soong and the legislative
caucuses of the KMT and the PFP.

COLLECTED KITCHEN SCRAPS WILL NOT BE FED TO PIGS FROM JAN. 1: EPA
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei, Sept. 7 (CNA)
(By Han Nai-kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Environmental Protection Administration
(EPA) will phase out the practice of its sanitation teams collecting
kitchen refuse as feed for hog farms beginning Jan. 1 next year, EPA
head Chang Kuo-lung said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Chang said the decision was made at the request of the Council of
Agriculture as a measure to prevent possible swine diseases from
spreading.
</P>
<P>
Statistics compiled by the EPA show that Taiwan's 25 counties and
cities generate about 45,000 metric tons of kitchen refuse, of which
70 percent is fed to pigs and the remaining 30 percent becomes
compost to be used as fertilizer.
</P>
<P>
The EPA head said that although currently the kitchen refuse is
pasteurized with high temperatures before being fed to pigs, there is
no guarantee that the method can prevent all hog-related diseases. He
added that Taiwan's NT$40 billion hog-raising industry cannot afford
the outbreak of a swine plague.
</P>
<P>
Chang acknowledged that the 21 compost processing plants in
Taiwan, with a combined handling capacity of 450 metric tons a day,
cannot cope with the 1, 400 tons of kitchen refuse collected each
day. It is, therefore, unlikely that the EPA will impose a total ban
on swill feeding.
</P>
<P>
He assured that the practice of swill feeding will be phased out
eventually, with all the kitchen refuse collected to be recycled as
compost. This, however, does not affect contracted collection by
private sanitation companies, he added.
</P>
<P>
Swill feeding of swine is popular in many countries as a way to
lower production costs, but the practice is known to be a risk that
can cause a disease outbreak with a major economic impact, such as
foot and mouth disease. Other risks associated with swill feeding
include African swine fever, classical swine fever and swine
vesicular disease.

PFP CHIEF AGAINST BUDGETS FOR ARMS PURCHASE, FLOOD-PREVENTION PROGRAM
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Sept.  7 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
People First Party Chairman (PFP) James
Soong said Wednesday his party opposes acting on the government's
bill to purchase arms from the United States, citing a 2004
referendum that failed because not enough voters turned out to cast
ballots.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to journalists before his meeting with Kuomintang (KMT)
Chairman Ma Ying-jeou, Soong said the proposed arms deal would fleece
the people because of what he called its unreasonably high price.
"No country in the world would waste taxpayers' money in this way, "
he said.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the KMT intends to refer the bill to the defense
committee for review, Soong said: "We have to make it clear that we
don't agree with this move."
</P>
<P>
The PFP chief said the results of the 2004 referendum should be
respected and the legislature is not in a position to overrule the
people's decision.
</P>
<P>
In last year's referendum, the voters were asked whether the
government should acquire more advanced anti-missile weapons and
whether the government should engage in negotiations with mainland
China on the establishment of a peace and stability framework for
cross-strait interactions to build consensus and for the welfare of
the peoples of both sides."
</P>
<P>
Only 45.16 percent of voters cast their ballots on the first
question, rendering the referendum invalid, as 50 percent had been
previously determined as the threshold for the vote to be valid,
although over 90 percent of those who did vote answered "yes" to both
questions.
</P>
<P>
Quoted unnamed U.S. sources as having told him that the "NT$600
billion" price tag for the arms purchase was "not fixed by us [the
Americans], " Soong said the price demanded by the Democratic
Progressive Party administration is inflated and would not bear
public scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
The price of the purchase was initially set at NT$610.8 billion
(US$18.23 billion) in 2004 when the bill was first submitted to the
legislature but has since been cut to NT$480 billion and then NT$340
billion after the defense ministry put some of the purchase items
into its regular budget.
</P>
<P>
Claiming that his party succeeded in killing the bill in the last
legislative session, Soong said his party, which controls 34 seats in
the 225-member legislature, will stick to its stance in this session.
</P>
<P>
Soong also reiterated his party's opposition to the bill for a
NT$80 billion budget for a flood-control program, saying that it's
sketchy and does not have any concrete programs. He said that he
couldn't see how these projects could solve the flooding problems
that routinely occur whenever the island is hit by a typhoon.
</P>
<P>
In a response to President Chen Shui-bian's criticism that the
opposition's stonewalling of the flood-control program would hinder
the government's efforts to redress the water shortage problem in
Taoyuan, Soong said the president is trying to shift the blame for
this problem onto the opposition.
</P>
<P>
Soong said he would like to have a public debate with the
president over the cause of that problem, which is believed to be the
silting up of the Shihmen Reservoir that supplies drinking water to
Taoyuan County, and who should bear responsibility for the continuing
situation.

Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng said
Wednesday that the legislature should begin to deliberate an
eight-year, NT$80 billion flood control budget plan as soon as
posible during the session scheduled to open Sept. 13.
</P>
<P>
At an exclusive interview with the Central News Agency, Wang, a
heavyweight of the main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) , said that the
legislative caucuses of the opposition "pan-blue alliance" of the KMT
and the People First Party (PFP) will come up with a joint version of
a draft flood control statute and form a task force to help
opposition legislators screen the budget plan submitted by the
Executive Yuan.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the flood control issue is of great importance and
urgency, Wang said the draft statute governing flood control and its
relevant budget should be reviewed as soon as possible. 
</P>
<P>
The Executive Yuan "should be in charge" of working out a
concrete, flood control project under the principle of regional
balance in order to effectively resolve the country's longstanding
flooding problems, Wang said.

NO KMT-PFP AGREEMENT ON ARMS PURCHASE BILL IN LEGISLATURE
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Sept.  7 (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The chairmen of the nation's two largest
opposition parties failed to adopt a joint legislative strategy on
how to handle the government's special budget bill for buying
advanced weapons from the United States Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Ma Ying-jeou and People First Party
(PFP) Chairman James Soong did not reach a consensus on whether to
put the bill on the legislative agenda, saying their legislative
causes will keep on discussing a joint strategy.
</P>
<P>
PFP Secretary-General Chin Chin-sheng said the bill should not be
put through the legislature's Procedure Committee because the
government's referendum on arms purchases failed, and "people's
direct opinion should not be vetoed by their indirect opinion [as
expressed in the legislature]."
</P>
<P>
The KMT and PFP agreed that the country must maintain its defence
capability, "but the government cannot veto the referendum results
with mere slogans," Chin said.
</P>
<P>
His KMT counterpart, Chan Chun-po, said the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) should actively seek to resolve the issue of
tying the arms purchase referendum to the presidential election of
2004.
</P>
<P>
Wang Jin-pyng, president of the Legislative Yuan, has suggested
that the arms procurement bill be put on the legislative agenda so
lawmakers can debate all aspects of the issue.
</P>
<P>
Ma and Soong also failed to hammer out a joint strategy on the
government's request for a NT$80 billion special budget for flood
control, agreeing that their legislative caucuses will jointly draft
a detailed flood-fighting plan to replace the government's "sloppy"
proposal.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders briefly touched on coordinating efforts to win
more city and county magistrate seats in the year-end elections,
agreeing on such principles as respecting the majority view and
keeping good faith toward each other.
</P>
<P>
How to cooperate in this regard will be discussed by the two
parties' legislative caucuses, Chan said. The two parties realize
that unity will benefit both parties whereas disunity will harm them,
Chin said.
</P>
<P>
Emerging from his meeting with Ma, Soong said both of them hope
to form a "strong monitoring team" in the legislature to keep the
government from falling further apart, as they realize that if the
opposition parties cannot check and balance the government, they will
have difficulty facing the public.

NEW '319 TRUTH COMMISSION' SHOULD BE SET UP: LEGISLATIVE SPEAKER
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei, Sept. 7 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng said
Wednesday that a new "319 truth commission" to look into the shooting
of President Chen Shui-bian and Vice President Annette Lu on the eve
of 2004 presidential election should set up during the current
legislative session.
</P>
<P>
Wang, a former vice chairman of the opposition Kuomintang (KMT),
made the remarks in an interview with the Central News Agency in
which he said the idea was the consensus reached between him and KMT
Chairman Ma Ying-jeou the previous day.
</P>
<P>
Wang noted that President Chen has said publicly that he is not
opposed to the formation a "319 truth commission, " and that the
opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) legislative caucus also
said in the previous legislative session that it is not against the
idea.
</P>
<P>
The issue of the formation of a "319 truth commission" is bound
to be broached by lawmakers across the party spectrum, Wang said,
adding that it will be difficult for the DPP to obstruct or block it.
</P>
<P>
He also said that a revision of the previous "319 truth
commission" statute is necessary, although the revision will be a
very technical issue, and the revision and the formation of a new
commission can be conducted simultaneously.
</P>
<P>
The new truth commission will exercise its authority under the
revised statute, Wang said, adding that it will not supersede the
interpretation of the Council of Grand Justices.
</P>
<P>
The "pan-blue alliance" of the KMT and the People First Party
authored the original "319 truth commission" statute which was
railroaded through the legislature to create an all-powerful special
commission to investigate an assassination attempt against President
Chen and Vice President Lu on the eve of the bitterly contested March
20 presidential election last year.
</P>
<P>
The statute was promulgated only after the "pan-blue
alliance"-dominated Legislative Yuan overrode the Cabinet's veto in a
showdown.
</P>
<P>
The DPP legislative caucus then asked the Council of Grand
Justices to impose a temporary injunction on the statute until the
council decided whether the statute was constitutional. The council
later ruled that some articles of the statute were unconstitutional,
which rendered the commission formed under the statute toothless. The
commission later disbanded.
</P>
<P>
Chen narrowly won re-election a day after the March 19 shooting
on the campaign trail. He was only lightly injured. His challenger,
KMT Chairman Lien Chan, has insinuated that Chen staged the shooting
to win sympathy votes. Although Lien has offered no evidence to
support his allegations, he filed two lawsuits to challenge Chen's
re-election victory and even the validity of the entire election.
Both were thrown out of court.

LEGISLATIVE CROSS-STRAIT TASK FORCE SHOULD BE CREATED: WANG
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Legislative Yuan speaker Wang Jin-pyng said
Wednesday that a planned legislative task force on cross-Taiwan
Strait affairs should be set up during the current legislative
session.
</P>
<P>
Following the formation of the special task force, the
legislature will energize bilateral relations between Taiwan and
China, Wang said during an exclusive interview with the Central News
Agency.
</P>
<P>
The legislature adopted a set of rules governing the formation
and operation of a legislative task force on cross-strait affairs in
2000, under which the ad hoc group was to be formed by 21
legislators, with the legislative speaker and deputy speaker serving
as convener and deputy convener, Wang noted.
</P>
<P>
During the first session of the sixth Legislative Yuan, Wang
proposed that the planned task force be set up as soon as possible to
help promote cross-strait exchanges, but the legislative caucus of
the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) was against the
proposal on the grounds that the task force would impinge on the
president's power.
</P>
<P>
Wang also said that he is willing to visit China in his capacity
as chief of the highest representative body of the people under the
principle of parity if his visit meets the nation's requirements and
is approved by the Taiwan people and the legislature.
</P>
<P>
Asked when would be opportune for him to visit China, Wang said
that it would depend on the government's future cross-strait policy.
He added that President Chen Shui-bian also hopes to meet with
leaders from domestic political parties to reach a concerted stance
on the cross-strait issue and to jointly deal with cross-strait
affairs.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Chen Ching-chun, secretary-general of the DPP
legislative caucus, reiterated that the DPP caucus will continue to
oppose Wang's proposal to set up a legislative task force on
cross-strait affairs, saying that dealing with cross-strait affairs
falls under the auspice of the president's power.

CHINA SHOULD HAVE PROVIDED TAIWANESE FINANCING 'LONG AGO'
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei, Sept. 7 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
China should have provided loans to
Taiwan businessmen operating in the mainland long ago in light of the
large number of investments of Taiwan businessmen there, an official
of the Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The official made the remarks after China decided to provide 30
billion yuan (US$3.71 billion) initially over a five-year period for
development loans for Taiwan businessmen.
</P>
<P>
The official, who did not wish to be identified, noted that
Taiwan's investment in China has become significant, and China should
have thought about the financing problem long ago.
</P>
<P>
But he said that since China will only provide the 30 billion
yuan over five years, it will only benefit a few Taiwanese
businessmen. If China is concerned about the interests of a vast
majority of Taiwanese businessmen, it is better to have governments
on both sides of the Taiwan Strait negotiate an investment protection
agreement.
</P>
<P>
He cited unofficial statistics to show that Taiwan businessmen's
investments in China have exceeded US$100 billion with an investment
of this scale China should have provided them with financing long
ago, which he said is also necessary for China to enter into a free
economic system.

TSU URGES PRESIDENT TO TALK WITH OPPOSITION OVER ARMS BILL

<TEXT>
<P>
As the ruling-opposition deadlock over a
government proposal to buy key weaponry from the United States looks
likely to linger on after a meeting of the leaders of the nation's
two largest opposition parties, a minor party called on President
Chen Shui-bian Wednesday to personally talk with them in a bid to
resolve the impasse.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU) Secretary-General Cheng Chen-lung
said the Kuomintang (KMT) and People First Party (PFP) should not
stop the government from acquiring needed weapons simply because the
government's 2004 referendum on arms purchases failed to meet its
threshold for "validity."
</P>
<P>
"Taiwan is facing a serious problem of a rapidly worsening
military imbalance [with China]," Cheng said, adding that the KMT and
the PFP must be reasonable when it comes to national security, as
they themselves have a chance to become ruling parties and face the
same problem in the future.

<P>
He suggested that President Chen meet with KMT Chairman Ma
Ying-jeou, PFP Chairman James Soong, Legislative Yuan President Wang
Jin-pyng and other key figures. He urged both sides to compromise and
pass the arms purchase bill quickly.
</P>
<P>
The meeting could also deal with the president's nomination of
Control Yuan members as well as the Cabinet's NT$80 billion special
budget request for flood control, two other urgent matters that are
stranded in the legislature because of the "pan-blue alliance"
opposition, Cheng said.
</P>
<P>
The "pan-blue alliance" of the KMT, the PFP and the New Party
forms a majority in the legislature over the "pan-green" camp of the
DPP and TSU.
</P>
<P>
The PFP is adamant about keeping the arms bill from ever being
put on the legislative agenda on the grounds that people's direct
opinion, as expressed in the referendum, cannot be vetoed by their
indirect opinion expressed through the legislature.
</P>
<P>
The KMT suggested that President Chen actively seek to resolve
the issue of "tying the arms purchases referendum to the presidential
election of 2004."

COA PLANS TO NET IN POULTRY, HOG FARMS TO PREVENT AVIAN FLU
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Sept.  7 (CNA)
(By Han Nai-kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Council of Agriculture (COA) is
planning to help poultry and hog raisers in Taiwan build bird nets
around their farms to prevent a possible outbreak of avian influenza
brought in by migratory birds.
</P>
<P>
Sung Hua-tsung, director of the COA's bureau of animal and plant
health inspection and quarantine, told the media Wednesday that the
plan would require NT$1 billion.
</P>
<P>
The nets would prevent wild and migratory birds from eating the
feed for chickens, ducks, geese and pigs in the farms and spreading
the avian flu virus. Those farms close to wetlands will be given
first priority in setting up the nets, Sung said.
</P>
<P>
The COA will also enlist the help of bird-watching societies to
monitor migratory birds. Their members will be asked to notify
authorities in charge of animal disease prevention whenever they spot
a dead migratory bird, he added.
</P>
<P>
Migratory birds, which used to be welcome in Taiwan, have become
a source of fear. Studies show that they may not get sick from the
virus, but can transmit the disease to chicken farms.

PRO-TAIWAN GROUPS TO MARCH  TO BOOST SUPPORT FOR ARMS PURCHASE

Taipei, Sept. 7 (CNA)

<TEXT>
<P>
A pro-independence group, League of Hand in
Hand to Protect Taiwan, said it will stage a march in conjunction
with the World Federation of Taiwanese Associations in Taipei on
Sept. 25 to boost public support for the government's arms purchase
from the United States.
</P>
<P>
Accompanied by former President Lee Teng-hui, Examination Yuan
President Yao Chia-wen, the league's executive director Wu Shu-min
told a news conference that the demonstrators will gather at 2 p.m.
at the Chiang Kai-shek Memorial Hall that day and march through the
city's streets beginning at 3 p.m., and will end up at Ketagalan
Boulevard in front of the Presidential Office.
</P>
<P>
Wu said the march will also muster support from the league for
creating a new constitution and re-designating the country's official
name as "Taiwan," and not the Republic of China.
</P>
<P>
Yao Chia-wen said at the news conference that more than 100
members of the World Federation of Taiwanese Associations who will
gather in Taipei for an annual meeting on Sept. 24 are expected to
join the Sept. 25 march to arose public interest in national
security, and inspire them to support the government's arms
acquirement program.
</P>
<P>
The parade is expected to turn on the heat on the opposition of
the Kuomintang and the People First Party, which have repeatedly
stonewalled the budget plan for the arms purchase in the Legislative
Yuan.
</P>
<P>
Disagreeing with the government's plan to finance the purchase
with a special budget, the two opposition parties have insisted on
having the funds for the purchase included in the government's
regular budget.
</P>
<P>
The government has left no stone unturned in its efforts to have
the budget clear the legislature, not only because of China's
increasing military threat, but also because of the impatience of the
U.S with Taiwan's foot-dragging on the deal.

ARMS PROCUREMENT HAD BEEN DECIDED BEFORE REFERENDUM: SPOKESMAN
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Sept.  7 (CNA)
(By Luis Huang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The procurement plan for three items of
advanced arms, which is pending approval by the Legislative Yuan, had
been decided before the first nationwide referendum held alongside
the March 20, 2004 presidential election, Executive Yuan spokesman
Cho Jung-tai said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Cho made the remarks after main opposition Kuomintang (KMT)
Chairman Ma Ying-jeou and Legislative speaker Wang Jin-pyng said the
government should deal with a failed proposal in the country's first
referendum before discussing the budget for the procurement of eight
diesel-electric submarines, six Patriot PAC III anti-missile
batteries and a squadron of 12 P-3C anti-submarine aircraft.
</P>
<P>
The purchase of the eight diesel-electric submarines was decided
in 1994, while the procurement of a squadron of 12 P-3C
anti-submarine aircraft and the six Patriot PAC III anti-missile
batteries was determined in 1997 and 1998, respectively, Cho
explained, adding that the U.S. government approved the sale of
Patriot PAC III anti-missile batteries in 1999, and submarines and
anti-submarine aircraft in 2001.
</P>
<P>
Cho said that one of the two questions asked in the referendum
was -- "The people of Taiwan insist that the Taiwan Strait issue be
resolved through peaceful means. Should China refuse to withdraw the
missiles it has targeted at Taiwan and openly renounce the use of
force against us, would you agree that the government should acquire
more anti-missile weapons to strengthen Taiwan's self-defense
capabilities?"
</P>
<P>
According to Cho, what the referendum wanted to emphasize in the
question was the government should "acquire more anti-missile
weapons." But the arms procurement package had been decided before
the referendum and none of the three items were "additionally"
increased, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
As for the question whether there is still room for the
government to adjust downward the budget required for the arms
procurement package, Cho said that the legislature has the right to
slash the budget while deliberating the procurement plan.
</P>
<P>
The budget plan for the procurement has been blocked for two
consecutive legislative sessions due to opposition from the
opposition "pan-blue alliance" of the KMT and the People First Party,
which holds a slim majority in the 225-seat legislature.

YU SHYI-KUN ASKS JAPAN TO UPDATE ENGAGEMENT MECHANISM WITH TAIWAN
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Tokyo,  Sept.  7 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROC President Chen Shui-bian's chief of
staff urged Japan Wednesday to update its engagement mechanism with
Taiwan forged in 1972 after it switched diplomatic recognition from
Taipei to Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Yu Shyi-kun, secretary-general to the president, made the appeal
at a cocktail reception marking the end of the 2005 Taiwan-Japan
Forum.
</P>
<P>
Yu said the 1972 mechanism, under which the two countries have to
deal with each other through quasi-official intermediary bodies, has
become obsolete and cannot meet the needs of the current
international situation.
</P>
<P>
"The current mechanism poses difficulties to bilateral relations.
It is our hope that Japan can consider the issue in a pragmatic and
forward-looking manner," Yu said.
</P>
<P>
The cocktail reception was hosted by former Japanese Prime
Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone in his capacity as head of the World Peace
Research Institute of Japan which co-sponsored the Taiwan-Japan Forum
with the Taipei-based Foundation on International and Cross-Strait
Studies.
</P>
<P>
Yu invited Nakasone to visit Taiwan. Nakasone said he would
consider the invitation.
</P>
<P>
Over the past year, Yu said, Taiwan-Japan relations have seen
many breakthroughs, including Japan offering 90-day, visa-free
treatment for Taiwan visitors.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the Asia-Pacific situation faces three variables that
could challenge security in the region and democratic values, Yu said
they are China's non-peaceful rise, North Korea's nuclear weapons
development project and the development prospects of Asia's emerging
democracies amid China's continued military build-up and its
increasingly extreme nationalism.
</P>
<P>
While Taiwan is striving to forge a new balance of power
mechanism to buttress its young democracy and peace across the Taiwan
Strait, Yu said it hoped that Japan can strengthen strategic
cooperation with Taiwan to safeguard peace and stability in East
Asia.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Yu said the conditions for Taiwan and Japan to sign
a free trade agreement has ripened. "We hope Japan can pragmatically
consider this issue to further boost bilateral economic cooperation,"
he added.
</P>
<P>
Yu arrived in Tokyo Monday to attend the Taiwan-Japan forum,
making him the highest-ranking ROC official to attend a public event
in Japan since the two countries severed diplomatic ties in 1972. Yu
will wrap up his Japan visit and return to Taipei Sept. 9.

AIT LEADERSHIP HAS SOME SHORTCOMINGS: OIG REPORT
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Washington,  Sept.  7 (CNA)
(By Oliver Lin and P.C.Tang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A report released by the Office of
Inspector General (OIG) of the U.S. State Department has said that
Douglas Paal, director of the Taipei Office of the American Institute
in Taiwan (AIT), has used his expertise to advance U.S. interests, 
adding, however, that his leadership had some shortcomings.
</P>
<P>
The report, which was released by the OIG July 20, is aimed at
providing systematic and independent evaluations of the AIT
operations.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, an OIG inspection of the AIT found that
the institute has effectively apprised Washington of key developments
in Taiwan and has conveyed American positions to local authorities.
</P>
<P>
"The AIT's director has used his considerable expertise to
advance U.S. interests and ensure Washington is fully aware of the
nuances in the positions of the new Taiwanese government, " the
report also said.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, the OTG also determined in the report that the AIT
director's leadership had some shortcomings and that the AIT's
facilities are substandard, prompting operational concerns.
</P>
<P>
"The AIT leadership has worked hard to improve operations by
promoting legislation to permit the assignment of active-duty Foreign
Service and military personnel to Taiwan and by establishing an
eligible family member program, " according to the OTG report.
</P>
<P>
"Consular operations are exceptional and provide quick, efficient
service. Administrative services are good, particularly financial
management, although there are shortcomings in the human resources
office," the report further said.
</P>
<P>
The OTG also said it considers the AIT's headquarters in
Washington, D.C. to be "well-run and efficient, " stressing, however,
that the institute's biggest need is "for more guidance on how to
interpret U.S. policy toward Taiwan."
</P>
<P>
"Guidance is often too reactive to an individual case, resulting
in hasty precedents, " the office further said in the report, adding
that "the State Department could assist the AIT and other agencies by
updating and reissuing to all relevant agencies a helpful guide to
U.S. policy that was last issued in 2002."

Last week, 547 new dengue cases were reported, and hospitals are

Every day, some 80 patients are coming down with dengue and of

Manila Bulletin: Palace
appeals for respite

Malacanang yesterday appealed to the opposition to

demonstrations after Congress finally dismissed the
three impeachment complaints against President Arroyo.

an option for Arroyo'

PRESIDENT Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo may have

Philippines (CBCP) yesterday indicated that her
governance would be far from smooth.

The Philippine Star: Cha-cha next on House agenda

The next priority of the House of Representatives,
now that it has killed the impeachment effort against
President Arroyo, is the Cha-cha (Charter change)
initiative.

BUILDING KAOHSIUNG MRT UNDER BOT MODEL WAS KMT DECISION: HSIEH
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Sept.  8 (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Premier Frank Hsieh said Wednesday night
that the decision to build Kaohisung's mass rapid transit system
under the BOT (build-operate-transfer) model was made when the
Kuomintang (KMT) was in power both in the city and in the central
government.
</P>
<P>
During an exclusive interview with TVBS, the premier showed
several copies of official documents which clearly recorded the
decision-making process leading up to the decision to transfer the
city government's responsibility for building the MRT system to
private contractors, a decision that eventually led to the recent
riot by Thai workers brought in to build the system.
</P>
<P>
The decision to transfer the right to build the orange line to
private investors was made on the eve of the 1998 mayoral election in
an apparent attempt to prevent the incumbent KMT mayor's challenger
-- Hsieh himself -- who ended up winning the election, from enjoying
the right to assign construction contracts, Hsieh said.
</P>
<P>
In response to a question about why he did not try to change the
decision after he became Kaohsiung mayor, Hsieh said that he did not
see the official documents until it was time to negotiate the terms
of the BOT contract, adding that as the KMT was still in power in the
central government, it was nearly impossible to change the KMT
policy.
</P>
<P>
Regarding the appointments of the Kaohsiung Mass Transit Corp.
(KRTC) board members, Hsieh said that when China Steel Corp. was
awarded the building contract, its chairman, Wang Chung-yu, was
appointed to act as KRTC chairman and Chen Min-hsien was appointed as
vice chairman. He noted that Chen, whose role became controversial
after Thai workers rioted Aug. 21, was already the vice chairman
before the Democratic Progressive Party came to power.
</P>
<P>
Hsieh claimed he never intervened in the personnel arrangements
of the KRTC after becoming Kaohsiung mayor. It was the board's
decision to name Chen Min-hsien as vice chairman even though Chen had
invested only NT$700 million in the NT$150 billion project, he added.
</P>
<P>
Hsieh also tried to clear suspicions that former Presidential
Deputy Secretary-General Chen Che-nan might have been involved in the
KRTC scandal. Noting that as Chen had competed against him for the
DPP candidacy to run for mayor, Hsieh asked: "How could he (Chen)
have tried to come to me to ask for some favor?"

HSIEH TRYING TO DIVERT ATTENTION BY BLAMING FORMER MAYOR WU: KMT

<TEXT>
<P>
Premier Frank Hsieh was trying to "shift
responsibility and divert people's attention" by saying that his
predecessor in Kaohsiung City, former mayor Wu Den-yih, made the
decision to build the city's mass rapid transit system under the BOT
model, Kuomintang (KMT) spokeswoman Cheng Li-wen said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Cheng claimed that all contracts for the construction project
were awarded and executed during Hsieh's time in office in Kaohsiung,
and it is Hsieh who must explain matters to the people regarding the
current controversies surrounding the MRT's construction.
</P>
<P>
She said that Wu had only decided on the "direction" of building
the MRT system under the "build, operate and transfer" formula -- a
decision which she said the Cabinet at the time did not agree on.
</P>
<P>
If Hsieh was also against the BOT project, he could have changed
it, instead of carrying through with it, the KMT spokesman claimed.
</P>
<P>
Cheng also questioned why the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)
government insisted on removing China Steel Corp. Chairman Wang
Chung-yu soon after the party came to power in 2000 and then hurried
to award all the construction contracts for the project. She added
that there should be a complete investigation into the awarding of
the contracts.
</P>
<P>
She also demanded that the premier give straight answers to all
the questions surrounding the matter.

TWO KAOHSIUNG CITY DIRECTORS RESIGN OVER MRT WORKER RIOT
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Kaohsiung,   Sept.  7  (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The directors of Kaohsiung City
Government's Bureau of Labor Affairs and Department of Mass Rapid
System have resigned to take responsibility for "failure to
supervise" a private company's management of Thai workers who rioted
Aug. 21 in protest against poor treatment.
</P>
<P>
Fang Lai-chin and Lee Cheng-pin followed Acting Mayor Chen
Chi-mai, who had earlier tendered his resignation to Premier Frank
Hsieh. Council of Labor Affairs Chairwoman Chen Chu has also quit
over the incident that has created a political storm in Taiwan and
reverberated to Thailand.
</P>
<P>
Fang and Lee decided to quit in spite of a city government
investigative report that determined that neither of their
departments was at fault. They said they hope their resignations will
calm things down so that the MRT project can move forward.
</P>
<P>
Since Aug. 21, Thai workers hired to build the Kaohsiung MRT have
moved to better dormitories that are not as crowded; Huapan
Administration Consultant Co., which the workers have accused of
violating their human rights, has lost its contract with the
Kaohsiung Rapid Transit Corp. (KRTC) ; and the KRTC has taken various
steps to make improvements regarding all the alleged violations of
rules against the workers.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, prosecutors have launched investigations into alleged
criminal acts against Thai workers or regarding the operations of the
KRTC. Still, the worker protest has led to a political storm that has
triggered heated debate and virulent accusations from all sides.
</P>
<P>
Fang and Lee said they hope their resignations will speed up the
construction of the MRT, whose completion they said will benefit the
citizens of Kaoshiung.

PRESIDENT WARNS MEDIA OF CONSEQUENCES OF ABUSING FREEDOM OF SPEECH
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei, Sept. 7 (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President Chen Shui-bian accused some media
Thursday of helping spread "a culture of smearing" by basing their
reports on anonymous letters, warning that abusing freedom of speech
endangers democracy.
</P>
<P>
Airing his views on his online newspaper regarding the media's
recent reports that said the president was being fawned on by
subordinates, Chen said a key difference between an advanced
democracy and a backward one lies in the abuse or respect of freedom
of expression.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that in an advanced democracy that enjoys 100 percent
freedom of the press, those making public statements or contributing
to news reports must also shoulder 100 percent of the responsibility
for their statements or reports.
</P>
<P>
He suspected that recent reports about "the bridge of sycophants"
and "sycophant troops" are examples of abusing freedom of the press
because both, he said, were based on anonymous letters.
</P>
<P>
One such letter, which triggered a whirlwind of reports and
commentaries about a make-shift bridge that he used to inspect the
Hsuehshan Tunnel on the Taipei-Ilan Expressway, has cast aspersions
on the contributions made by thousands of engineers and workers, Chen
said.
</P>
<P>
Another anonymous accusation has also hurt the feelings of
hundreds of men and women in uniform who worked hard in preparation
for a presidential visit for an Armed Forces Day function, he added.
</P>
<P>
He said all members of society should reflect on the
appropriateness of the media using unsigned letters to exaggerate
so-called " news events."
</P>
<P>
The president said all citizens of the country can write or call
any government agency to express their opinions about government
services, but one critical condition for government agencies to
respond to the letters or calls is to first determine the source.
</P>
<P>
The government will not respond to any accusation or criticism
coming from an unidentified source; officials can even go ahead and
toss away the correspondence in order to stop the spread of "the ill
wind of rumors," the president said.
</P>
<P>
He quoted an ancient Chinese saying -- "Water holds and water
topples" -- to warn that once abused, freedom could turn from "the
best value" of democracy into its "worst enemy."
</P>
<P>
As Buddhists say, a change of mind could land you in heaven or
hurl you to hell. "Are we marching toward a civilized society or a
barbarian one? This, too, depends on a single change of mind, " he
said.

KMT LEGISLATIVE CAUCUS OPPOSES REVIEWING ARMS  BILL
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Sept. 8 (CNA)
(By P.C. Tang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The opposition Kuomintang (KMT) caucus in
the Legislative Yuan refused Thursday to review the arms procurement
bill put forward by the Cabinet, saying that they will not exclude
the possibility of requesting that the executive branch present a new
budget plan to the legislature.
</P>
<P>
As the referendum held in 2004 on whether the country should
strengthen its anti-missile defense capability failed to obtain the
need participation from voters to be considered valid, the caucus
said that an inclusion of the procurement of six Patriot PAC III
anti-missile batteries in the Executive Yuan's annual budget is
certainly against the law and that reviewing it would be unlawful.
</P>
<P>
They also said that their opposition to the examination of the
arms procurement bill remains unchanged, although KMT Chairman Ma
Ying-jeou and Wang Jing-pyng, speaker of the Legislative Yuan, have
reached a consensus on the legislature's examination of the
procurement of eight diesel-powered submarines and 12 P-3
anti-submarine aircraft.
</P>
<P>
The caucus's stance on the arms deal was clearly reflected by KMT
legislators Tseng Yung-chuan, Su Chi, Ting Shou Chung and Pan
Wei-kang at a news conference they jointly held earlier in the day.
</P>
<P>
Questioning the Executive Yuan's legitimacy of including the
purchase of the Patriot PAC III anti-missile batteries in its annual
budget, Tseng said that as the issue was rejected by the people in
the 2004 referendum, the Cabinet cannot again present the same budget
plan for the procurement of the missiles within three years. "How can
the Legislative Yuan go against the law to examine the bill, which
was presented by the executive branch illegally and against the will
of the public," he added.
</P>
<P>
Ting, also a member of the KMT's arms procurement group, said
that the government " is obviously turning a blind eye to the law" in
terms of presenting its annual budget for the purchase of the Patriot
anti-missile batteries, adding that without taking issues related to
cross-strait relations, national defence, public opinion and
political situations into consideration, the procurement of arms from
the United States is "useless" and "self-consolation."
</P>
<P>
Pointing out that neither the executive nor the legislative branch
can take the law into their own hands, Su, also a member of the
group, said he firmly insists that the Patriot anti-missiles cannot
be included in the Cabinet's annual budget since " the government has
no right to do this."
</P>
<P>
KMT Chairman Ma also said Wednesday while addressing the party's
regular Central Committee meeting that the Cabinet should first
settle the problems posed in the aftermath of the 2004 referendum if
it wants to push for the passage of the long-stalled arms procurement
bill in the legislature.
</P>
<P>
In the referendum, only 45.17 percent of eligible voters cast
their ballots, making the referendum invalid. However, of those who
did vote, over 90 percent supported buying more defensive weapons.

TAIWAN PROTESTS AS SYRIA FAILS TO ISSUE VISAS FOR ROC OFFICIAL GROUP

<P>
The government has protested against Syria
for its attempt to exclude the Republic of China on Taiwan from
taking part in the 2005 annual meeting of the Afro-Asian Rural
Development Organization (AARDO) to be held later this year, a
Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) official said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Council of Agriculture (COA) filed a complaint with the AARDO
secretary-general's office recently to protest against Syria's
decision not to issue visas to the Taiwan delegation to the AARDO
annual meeting scheduled to be held in Damascus Nov. 13, said Liao
Tung-chou, a deputy director-general of the MOFA's department of
international organizations.

The decision, made for fear of riling Beijing, has infringed on

Taiwan joined the AARDO as a full member in 1968. AARDO, formed

DOH REJECTS WOMAN'S REQUEST TO GET SPERM FROM DEAD HUSBAND'S BODY

<TEXT>
<P>
The Department of Health has refused to
make an exception to the law and give special permission to a woman
who begged to be allowed to harvest sperm from her husband who died
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
ROC Army Captain Sun Chi-hsiang died in hospital after being
injured when the armored vehicle he was driving suddenly accelerated
by itself and crashed. Being an only son and a newlywed, his parents
and wife urged doctors to take his sperm so that his wife can have a
baby through in vitro fertilization.
</P>
<P>
The doctors told her that according to the law governing
artificial insemination, a man's sperm must be destroyed after his
death. Unless a special permit is issued, they can do nothing to help
her.
</P>
<P>
The health department said that making an exception in this case
would set a precedent, which it is not willing to do.
</P>
<P>
Su Shu-chen, a eugenics official at the health department, said
at the request of the Sun family, doctors did ask for special
permission, but the spirit of the law is to help infertile couples.
</P>
<P>
"Since Sun Chi-hsiang has died, there are no provisions in the
law that allow us to grant such a request," she added.
</P>
<P>
Besides, Su pointed out, even if doctors could get around the law
and legally retrieve sperm for Ms. Sun, the next step, in vitro
fertilization, would be illegal.
</P>
<P>
Gynecologist Lee Sheng-mao said there is a 50 percent to 60
percent chance of success with the procedure if the sperm is taken
within 24 hours after a man dies.
</P>
<P>
After 24 hours, the success rate will drop by 10 percent. After
48 hours, as the sperm dies gradually, it is no longer practical to
try to make a baby, Lee said.

TAIPEI AGREES TO HOST ANMC MEETING AFTER BEIJING'S WITHDRAWAL
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Sept.  8 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taipei has agreed to host the next Asian
Network of Major Cities 21 (ANMC) meeting in early 2006 after China
abruptly withdrew from the regional city organization, Taipei Mayor
Ma Ying-jeou said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Ma said that he "gladly accepted" the offer to host the meeting
Thursday during a meeting with Tokyo Governor Shintaro Ishihara, who
came to Taiwan Tuesday for a four-day visit.
</P>
<P>
The 2005 ANMC meeting, originally set to be convened in Beijing
this winter, was thrown into disarray after China announced Aug. 30
that it had decided to drop out of the organization altogether.
</P>
<P>
Ma said that Ishihara has asked Taipei, which was awarded the
right to host the ANMC meeting for 2006 between October and November,
to move ahead its schedule so that the next meeting will not be too
far apart from the previous meeting.
</P>
<P>
Ishihara also agreed that the ANMC Secretariat will call a
provisional meeting in Tokyo to confirm this, according to Ma.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Foreign Affairs Tan Sun Chen said Thursday that the
convening of the ANMC meeting will help promote diplomatic work. In
view of the close relations between Taiwan and Japan, the government
will assist Taipei in hosting the event, whether in its funding or
preparations.
</P>
<P>
The ANMC was founded in 2001 by Ishihara, and is meant to be a
forum of mayors of major Asian cities. It groups Bangkok, New Delhi,
Hanoi, Jakarta, Kuala Lumpur, Manila, Seoul, Singapore, Taipei, Tokyo
and Yangon, with the twelfth city having been Beijing. The ANMC
annual meeting is to be hosted by each city in rotation.
</P>
<P>
Taipei began to bid to host the 2005 ANMC meeting in July 2004,
but Beijing entered the race against Taipei for that right only a few
days before the Nov. 22-23, 2004 Jakarta meeting simply because it
did not want to see Taipei play any significant role in the meeting.
</P>
<P>
In a vote to choose between Taipei and Beijing, Beijing beat
Taipei by winning seven out of 12 votes, but was one vote shy of the
two-thirds needed to win the hosting right.
</P>
<P>
In the ensuing negotiations, all of the meeting attendants except
the Beijing representative agreed that Beijing should host the 2005
meeting, with Taipei hosting the 2006 meeting.
</P>
<P>
On a side note, Ishihara visited the Taipei Artist Village
Wednesday, and Ma asked him Thursday to send artists to Taiwan to
be artists-in-residence and exchange their wisdom with local artists.

FOREIGN MINISTER SIGNS ANTI-LANDMINE STATEMENT TO UPHOLD HUMAN RIGHTS
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei, Sept. 8 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Minister of Foreign Affairs Tan Sun Chen on
Thursday signed an anti-landmine statement to show the government is
opposed to the use of landmines and is determined to uphold human
rights.
</P>
<P>
Chen signed the statement after meeting with Kristen Connors,
Miss Wheelchair America, and Taiwan's first "Miss Wheelchair" Chen
Mei-yu.
</P>
<P>
Recalling that he had seen those injured by landmines on the
outlying island of Kinmen, Chen said that the global anti-landmine
campaign aims to rid the planet of mines, which destroy life and
cripple many each year.
</P>
<P>
As Taiwan has always advocated resolving problems through
peaceful means, it will definitely support the clearing of landmines
so that innocent people will not be victimized, Chen said.
</P>
<P>
Eden Social Welfare Foundation is sponsoring the event and the
foundation's vice executive director, Lin Chin-chuan, also said that
confined by the fact that Taiwan is not a member of the United
Nations, it cannot sign the 1997 Mine Ban Treaty, which bans the use,
production, transfer and stockpiling of antipersonnel landmines.
</P>
<P>
So that Taiwan can participate in the spirit of the treaty, the
foundation has become a representative of Taiwan in the International
Campaign to Ban Landmines (ICBL) , a network of more than 1,200
non-governmental organizations in 60 countries, Lin added.
</P>
<P>

TAIWAN PRODUCTS FREQUENT WINNERS OF MAJOR WORLD DESIGN AWARDS
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Sept.  8 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taiwan's locally designed and developed
innovative products have been frequent winners at major world design
competitions, officials from the Council for Economic Planning and
Development (CEPD) said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Since the establishment of the Taiwan Design Center -- a
non-profit governmental organization -- in 2003, the center has
helped Taiwan innovative products and their designers enter major
design competitions and more than 100 products have taken prestigious
awards over the past two years, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan products garnered 33 German International Forum Design
(iF) awards this year, more than double last year's 14, while 20
Taiwan products won the Reddot Award (Design Zentrum-Germany) this
year, compared to only two last year, the officials quoted the Taiwan
Design Center tallies as indicating.
</P>
<P>
A total of 2,322 products from 31 countries entered the iF
competition this year, in which Taiwan won more than South Korea for
the first time. Among the participating Taiwan companies, ASUS
Computer garnered a Gold iF Award, the first of its kind ever won by
a Taiwan company.
</P>
<P>
Five Taiwan products won the Industrial Design Excellence Award
(IDEA) from the United States this year, outperforming South Korea's
four and on a par with that of Japan.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Taiwan products also won scores of G-Marks (Good
Design Awards) from Japan this year, increasing the number of major
world design awards that Taiwan companies have won this year to 100,
the officials said.

SIX-MONTH SHORTAGE PREDICTED FOR BANANAS
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Nantou County, Central  Taiwan, Sept.  8 (CNA)
(By Han Nai-kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taiwan is expected
to face a shortage of bananas for the next six months after two
typhoons caused serious damage to the banana crop in the past two
months, market experts predicted Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The fruit and vegetables cooperative in Nantou County, a major
source of Taiwan's bananas, estimated that it will take at least six
months for Taiwan's banana growers to recover from the devastation
wrought by Typhoon Haitang and Typhoon Talim, which stuck Taiwan July
18 and Aug. 31, respectively.
</P>
<P>
Statistics compiled by the Council of Agriculture show that
Typhoon Haitang caused losses worth NT$1.5 billion to Taiwan's
agricultural sector, while damage from Typhoon Talim totaled NT$4.2
billion. Bananas were one of the fruit items that suffered the
greatest damage.
</P>
<P>
In Nantou County, where the marketplaces for the banana trade are
usually teeming with wholesale buyers, supplies have dropped by 60
percent, and less than 20 percent of the stock qualify for "Grade A"
labels, the experts said.
</P>
<P>
Although the price once surged to the record NT$5,000 per 100 kg
for Class A bananas shortly after the typhoons and has dropped to
NT$4,100 at present, farmers do not have enough bananas to meet
demand.
</P>
<P>
Some of the banana supplies did not even reach the marketplace
because they were grabbed by buyers who would offer a better than
normal price. With the price on the domestic market remaining so
high, executives of Nantou County's fruit and vegetables cooperative
said they believe there will be very few bananas left for the export
market this year.

NO NEED TO AMEND THE CONSTITUTION AGAIN: KMT CHAIRMAN
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Sept.  9 (CNA)
(By Han Nai-kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The chairman of the main opposition
Kuomintang (KMT) claimed Thursday that there is no need to amend the
Republic of China Constitution again.
</P>
<P>
Asked by the press about his opinion on the second phase of
President Chen Shui-bian's constitutional reform plan, Ma Ying-jeou,
who is also mayor of the capital city of Taipei, said that if the
Constitution is going to be amended again, the first thing to be done
should be reinstating the legislature's power to approve the
president's nomination of the premier -- a constitutional right that
was taken away when the Constitution was amended during former
President Lee Teng-hui's tenure.
</P>
<P>
Ma pointed out that during the past 15 years, the Constitution
has been amended seven times.
</P>
<P>
There is no other nation in the world that has amended its
constitution as frequently as the ROC, he said, adding that the
government actually only needs to do a good job carrying out what is
in the Constitution.
</P>
<P>
The president declared in June that he will form a constitutional
reform committee and allow the public to be fully engaged in the
constitutional reform discussion.
</P>
<P>
He declared that the second phase of his constitutional reforms
will involve such issues as whether the nation should have a
three-branch or five-branch separation of power, whether to adopt a
presidential or parliamentary system of government, whether to reform
the legislature, whether to suspend or abolish the provincial
government, whether to lower the minimum voting age, whether to
modify compulsory military service requirements, protection of human
rights and labor rights, and the inclusion of a special chapter on
the well-being of aboriginal citizens in the Constitution.

CHINESE ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS NABBED ON YUNLIN COAST
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Yunlin,  Sept.  8 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A total of 13 Chinese men were caught at
the estuary of the Choshui creek in the south-central county of
Yunlin in the small hours of Thursday as they were trying to sneak
into Taiwan, the Coast Guard Administration (CGA) reported later that
day.
</P>
<P>
The illegal immigrants were apprehended after they came ashore
from a fishing boat and tried to run into woods on the southern bank
of the estuary, authorities from the CGA's Fifth Patrol Operation
said.
</P>
<P>
The coast guard set up roadblocks on roads leading to the
estuary, believing that an unknown number of other Chinese stowaways
escaped and made their way to Yunlin during the round-up in the dark.
</P>
<P>
According to the coast guard officers, a suspicious fishing boat
was spotted by radar at around 2 a.m. Thursday and "knowing
instinctively" that Chinese were attempting to enter the country
illegally, the CGA Fifth Patrol Operation mobilized some 250 men,
including local police, to hunt for them.
</P>
<P>
The apprehended men were believed to have paid
NT$20,000-NT$25,000 (US$625-US$781) each for the trip aboard an
unidentified fishing boat to Taiwan from Pingtan, in China's Fujian
Province, the officers said.

TAIWAN MAKES ANOTHER BREAKTHROUGH IN ANIMAL CLONING
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Tainan, Taiwan, Sept. 8 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Premier Frank Hsieh presided over a
christening ceremony Thursday for a goat born to Taiwan's first
transgenic cloned goat that carries a foreign gene -- human blood
Factor 8 -- in its genome.
</P>
<P>
The kid, which Hsieh christened Paopei, carries the same
foreign gene deliberately inserted into the mother goat, named
Paoyu.
</P>
<P>
"Both Paoyu and Paopei are our pride and joy. They mark new
milestones in our animal cloning history and I have named the baby
goat Paopei in hopes of his longevity and fertility, " Hsieh said at
the christening ceremony held at the Taiwan Livestock Research
Institute (TLRI) under the Council of Agriculture (COA) in the
southern county of Tainan.
</P>
<P>
Factor 8 is a protein that circulates in the blood, stabilized by
another protein. Factor 8 can be used to treat A-type hemophilia
patients.
</P>
<P>
COA Chairman Lee Chin-lung said one gram of Factor 8 can fetch up
to US$2.9 million in the world market. The annual world demand is
about 300 grams, which is worth US$800 million to US$900 million.
</P>
<P>
"These figures indicate the value of the foreign gene carried in
Paoyu and Paopei," Lee said.
</P>
<P>
According to Lee, the TLRI cooperated with National Taiwan
University, National Chung Hsing University and National Pingtung
University of Science and Technology in cloning Paoyu, using both
transgenic and somatic cell cloning technologies.
</P>
<P>
Paoyu was cloned in March 2004, making her Taiwan's first
transgenic cloned goat. She has since grown into a healthy dairy
goat. She was impregnated through natural methods last November and
gave birth in late April. The kid Paopei has now grown to 23.5 kg.
</P>
<P>
"We are jubilant at the birth of Paopei because it proves that a
transgenic cloned goat can reproduce naturally, " said Chen Li-jen, a
TLRI biological research division chief.
</P>
<P>
Premier Hsieh praised the research team for their team spirit and
hard work.
</P>
<P>
"The cloning of Paoyu and the birth of Paopei indicate that
Taiwan is second to none in the field of animal cloning, " Hsieh
added.
</P>
<P>
COA Chairman Lee said the Taiwan researchers have done all the
research themselves, but some of the team members traveled to Britain
for training.
</P>
<P>
"It took seven to eight years to come to this point at a cost of
less than NT$100 million. Thanks to the correctness of our research
direction, we have made tremendous headway," Lee said proudly.
</P>
<P>
"Paoyu" is a sister of "Paochi" and "Paohsiang" -- Taiwan's first
cloned goats created in July 2002. They were all cloned from
ear-derived somatic cells of an adult alpine goat. But only Paoyu was
inserted a foreign gene -- Factor 8.
</P>
<P>
"Paochi" and "Paohsiang" are a pair of twins cloned from somatic
cells of an adult female alpine goat. They are the world's first
dairy goats cloned from ear-derived somatic cells of an adult alpine
goat. The twins have grown well and given birth to many kids
naturally.

INAUGURATION OF TAIWAN HIGH-SPEED RAIL TO BE POSTPONED FOR ONE YEAR
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,   Sept.  8  (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The inauguration of Taiwan's first
high-speed railway will be postponed for one year until Oct. 31,
2006, Taiwan High-Speed Rail Corp. (THSRC) Chairwoman Nita Ing
announced Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Ing apologized to investors and the public over the decision, but
claimed she is confident of achieving the new goal of launching the
high-speed railway by October next year.
</P>
<P>
She said that in view of an overall consideration of the progress
of the construction, system tests and operation preparations, the
board of directors was forced to postpone the launch by one year.
</P>
<P>
Ing was unwilling to identify where the faults lie but said that
the Japanese Shinkansen system is "more complex" than expected.
</P>
<P>
However, THSRC officials said construction of core mechanical and
electrical systems have lagged behind schedule by more than 30
percent, affecting system tests and operation preparations.
</P>
<P>
The head of Japan-based Taiwan Shinkansen Consortium (TSC), which
is providing train carriages and is the main contractor of the
mechanical and electrical system, said that both parties have their
own "interpretations" of the reasons for the delay upon which he
refused to elaborate "out of respect" for the contract, although he
admitted that the two sides had "found it hard to reach consensus."
</P>
<P>
Ing said that THSRC's attitude toward TSC with regard to
the contract has been to see it as a cooperation partner and help it
solve problems, although it will not deviate from the contract,
undermine the interests of the THSRC or the overall goal of the
government in promoting the high-speed rail system.
</P>
<P>
Ing did not say whether the THSRC will ask TSC for compensation,
noting that the main task now is to complete the project.
</P>
<P>
She said that according to the contract and related regulations,
the THSRC can "reasonably adjust" the launch date without breaching
the contract.
</P>
<P>
She also said the THSRC has sent its rescheduled plan to the
Ministry of Transportation and Communications, as well as the banking
consortium in charge of the finances for the project, and will also
offer an explanation to shareholders.
</P>
<P>
TSC officials said that the THSRC had not asked for compensation,
but said both sides need to confirm the costs of "quite a number of
items."
</P>
<P>
THSRC President George Liu said that because of the postponement,
the total cost of the project will be increased from NT$460.7 billion
(US$) to NT$480 billion.
</P>
<P>
Interest and other finances will account for around NT$13.8
billion of the increase, while business operations will account for
NT$5.5 billion, Liu said.

</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a spokesman for the Executive Yuan said the THSRC
has reported to Premier Frank Hsieh about the postponement and
that the premier has asked that the company calculate the schedule
accurately and reasonably.
</P>
<P>
"Hopefully, we won't have to go so far as to resort to buying
back the railway," Cho Jung-tai said.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Transportation and Communications Lin Ling-san said
the guiding principle will be safety and that the ministry will
supervise this aspect rigorously.
</P>
<P>
He denied reports that Chunghwa Telecom will invest in the THSRC.
On whether the government will increase investment in the project,
Lin said that the THSRC has not made such a request and that the
matter will also have to respect the decision by the Legislative
Yuan. If the legislature approves, it will be a good thing to the
THSRC, he added.
</P>
<P>
The 345-km high-speed railway linking Taipei in the north and
Kaohsiung in the south will form the backbone of western Taiwan's
mass rapid transportation network and it is claimed will reduce
travel time between Taipei and Kaohsiung to 90 minutes. The system
will connect eight metropolitan areas between Taiwan's two largest
cities and will be able to transport at least 300,000 passengers
daily when it becomes fully operational.
</P>
<P>
The multimillion-dollar railway system is Taiwan's first
infrastructure project being built under the build-operate-transfer
(BOT) model.

<P>
The American Institute in Taiwan (AIT), the
de facto American embassy in Taiwan in the absence of diplomatic
ties, expressed its appreciation Thursday to Taiwan's donation of
US$2 million and medical supplies for relief for the victims of
Hurricane Katrina.
</P>
<P>
In a press release, acting AIT Director David J. Keegan expressed
heartfelt appreciation to the Taiwan government and people for their
generous offer of assistance after Hurricane Katrina battered the
southern United States.

</P>
<P>
"Your offer of US$2 million and medical supplies has been
identified as fulfilling a critical need, " Keegan said, expressing
appreciation for this show of solidarity with the United States.
</P>
<P>
"The fact that the people of Taiwan have responded so quickly and
so thoroughly reaffirms the enduring friendship between our two
peoples," he said.
</P>
<P>
"I have been told that many private citizens have expressed a
desire to donate personal funds to help Americans. The U.S.
Department of State encourages citizens to donate Katrina relief
through the Red Cross," he continued. 
</P>
<P>
As U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice has said, the U.S.
has seen its people respond generously to help others around the
globe during their times of distress, and now, Americans are seeing a
similar urgent, warm and compassionate reaction from the
international community in response to the devastation, he said.

DOH SETS UP OFFICE TO COORDINATE PREVENTION OF NEW FLU STRAINS

<TEXT>
<P>
The Department of Health (DOH) set up an
office Thursday to coordinate efforts between government agencies in
the prevention and control of new flu strains amid heightened global
awareness of the potential threat of avian flu to humans.
</P>
<P>
DOH Minister Ho Sheng-mao warned that avian flu is likely to hit
Taiwan between January and March next year and that based on the
lessons Taiwan learned when it was hit by severe acute respiratory
syndrome (SARS) in 2003, there is a need for a special office to
coordinate the nation's efforts in the prevention of a possible avian
flu pandemic.
</P>
<P>
The DOH's Center for Disease Control predicted that if an
outbreak of human avian flu occurs, an estimated 5.3 million people
in Taiwan will be affected by the virus, causing 64,000 people to be
hospitalized, with an additional 3 million requiring treatment at
clinics and hospitals.
</P>
<P>
The death toll could rise to 13,000 people, according to the
center.
</P>
<P>
The duties of the new office will include stepping up publicity
to educate the public about the threat of avian flu. Whenever an
individual shows any flu symptoms, he or she should refrain from
going to public places. In addition, people should develop the habit
of wearing a face mask, an official at the new office said.

ACTIVISTS RAISE FLAG TO MARK 'INDEPENDENCE DAY'
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  Sept. 8 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
More than 1,000 pro-independence activists
gathered at the plaza in front of the Presidential Office Thursday to
raise a flag to mark what they called the country's "day of
independence" from Japan and China.
</P>
<P>
The activists chose Sept. 8 because it is the anniversary of the
signing of the 1951 San Francisco Peace Treaty, in which Japan gave
up its territorial claim over Taiwan. Japan ruled the island from
1895 to 1945. The Kuomintang, or the Chinese Nationalist Party, that
was founded in China, then took over Taiwan when it retreated from
China to Taiwan in 1949 after losing a bloody civil war with the
Chinese communists.
</P>
<P>
The Beijing government still claims sovereignty over Taiwan.
Earlier this year, China passed a so-called anti-secession law
codifying the use of force against Taiwan if it moved toward formal
independence.
</P>
<P>
The pro-independence supporters, mobilized by a private
association promoting the establishment of a Taiwan republic, sang
songs and prayed as their blue, white and green flag slowly rose
above a stage erected on the Ketagalan Boulevard leading to the
Presidential Office building.
</P>
<P>
The flag has a red sun in the middle with the Chinese characters
for "Taiwan Nation."
</P>
<P>
Wang Hsieh-chi, a convener of the association, said the group
will unveil the "national flag and anthem" of the "Taiwan Nation" in
2007 in the hopes of raising the flag inside the Presidential Office
on Sept. 8, 2008.

<P>
Typhoon Khanun has increased in strength
over the past few hours to become a "medium" typhoon, posing an
increasing threat to Taiwan as it continues to move toward the
island, the Central Weather Bureau (CWB) reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The typhoon, with a radius of 200 kilometers, was centered 1,060
kilometers away from Taiwan's southernmost tip of Oluanpi at 11 a.m.
Friday, moving in a northwest direction toward Taiwan at a speed of
21 kph, CWB meteorologists said.
</P>
<P>
The weather bureau is expected to issue a sea warning for Khanun,
the 15th typhoon reported in the Pacific this year, later in the day.
</P>
<P>
The eye of typhoon is forecast to be located about 690 kilometers
east of Oluanpi by 2 a.m. Saturday, the meteorologists forecast,
warning ships operating in waters north and east of the Philippines
to be on alert against rough seas.
</P>
<P>
The weather bureau also discouraged the Taiwan public from
vacationing by the sea over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
The eastern, northern and central parts of Taiwan are expected to
start experiencing heavy rain by Saturday when these areas come under

TWO SOLDIERS KILLED IN EXPLOSION AT WEAPONRY FACTORY IN KAOHSIUNG

<TEXT>
<P>
Two soldiers were killed in an explosion at
a weaponry factory in the southern Taiwan county of Kaohsiung Friday
morning, the Ministry of National Defense (MND) said.
</P>
<P>
Initial investigations revealed that a machine used in the
production of ammunition blew up at the military-run factory in
Kaohsiung County's Tashu township, killing two soldiers and injuring
one other, an MND spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The deceased were identified as Chiu Kuo-chen, a sergeant first
class, and Hsu Ming-cheng, a staff sergeant. The injured soldier,
identified as Su Ching-kuo, also a staff sergeant, was rushed to a
nearby hospital for emergency treatment, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
"We feel deep regret over the accident, " the spokesman said,
adding that the ministry will assist the families of the deceased
soldiers in handling the aftermath and spare no efforts in treating
the injured.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the spokesman said, the MND has formed a special task
force to investigate the cause of the fatal accident.
</P>
<P>
The blast came just two days after a string of explosions rocked
an ammunition depot on the Taiwan-held frontline island of Matsu,
which lies closer to China's Fujian Province than to Taiwan. No one
was injured, and the military is still investigating the explosions.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, Army Capt. Sun Chi-hsiang was killed when an
armored vehicle suddenly accelerated during an operation at a
military base in central Taiwan. Investigators are still probing the
case.

The Republic of China's envoy in Brussels

leadership of the Taipei Office of the American Institute in Taiwan
(AIT).
</P>
<P>
The report, which was released July 20 by the Office of Inspector

Taipei Office Director Douglas Paal has used his considerable

In response to a question raised by the Central News Agency

the United States.

Noting that he was already acquainted with Paal when he became

PFP TO SPONSOR CROSS-STRAIT ECONOMICS FORUM IN SHANGHAI
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Sept.  9 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taiwan's opposition People First Party
(PFP) is scheduled to host a cross-strait economics forum in Shanghai
in mid-September to help facilitate business and trade exchanges
between Taiwan and China, a PFP spokesman said Friday.
</P>
<P>
PFP Chairman James Soong will lead a delegation from the
opposition party to Shanghai for the forum, which will include four
major topics: namely Taiwan's economically strategic development and
Taiwan businesspeople's roles in China; direct cross-strait air
links; agricultural exchanges; and the normalization of cross-strait
business and trade relations, said Chang Hsien-yao, director of the
PFP's Policy Research Center.
</P>
<P>
It has been decided that PFP Secretary-General Chin Chin-sheng
and Chen Yunlin, director of the Taiwan Affairs Office of Beijing's
State Council, will jointly preside over the opening as well as the
closing of the forum.
</P>
<P>
PFP Vice Chairman Chang Chao-hsiung, a
cardiologist-turned-politician, will deliver a keynote speech at the
closing ceremony, while noted scholars from across the Taiwan Strait,
including Yeh Wan-an, Hu Angang and Li Yining, will also deliver
their research reports during the forum.
</P>
<P>
This will be the first high-ranking PFP delegation to visit China
since Soong's "bridge-building" journey to Beijing in May this year
during which he met with Hu Jintao, general secretary of the
Communist Party of China and president of China.
</P>
<P>
Soong has attached great expectations to the forthcoming forum,
considering it a concrete step in realizing the sixth point of the
Hu-Soong consensus reached during their historic meeting May 12 that
a "dialogue platform" of a private nature should be formed to help
accelerate exchanges across the Taiwan Strait, according to Chang.
</P>
<P>
Chang said that the PFP may arrange for Soong and the party
delegation to return to Taiwan after the forum via the "mini three
links" route, which would entail first flying from Shanghai to the
southern Chinese port city of Xiamen, then taking a ferry from there
to Taiwan's outlying island of Kinmen before boarding a plane back to
Taiwan proper.
</P>
<P>
The PFP will consult with Joseph Wu, chairman of the
Cabinet-level Mainland Affairs Council, early next week about matters
regarding the forthcoming forum, Chang added.

HUMAN RIGHTS ISSUE TO CAST SHADOW OVER E.U.-CHINA RELATIONS: ENVOY

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taiwan's top official in Brussels speculated
Thursday that slow progress made by China on its human rights
performance will cast a shadow over European Union-China relations.
</P>
<P>
Chen Chien-jen, the island's representative to the E.U. in
Belgium, made the remarks following the European Parliament's passage
that same day of a joint resolution urging Beijing to cease its
persecution of Christians.
</P>
<P>
According to Chen, freedom of religion is part of the human
rights and was one of the topics discussed by the E.U. and China
during their summit meeting held in Beijing earlier this week.
</P>
<P>
Noting that members of the European Parliament are concerned
about the human rights situation in China, the representative said
that the E.U. has refused to lift its arms sales ban on China out of
consideration of the current human rights situation.
</P>
<P>
Chen also said the improvement of China's human rights situation
will have a positive impact on the Chinese people and the development
of the world.
</P>
<P>
In the resolution, the European Parliament calls on the Chinese
government to put an end to religious repression and to ensure that
it respects international standards of human rights as well as
religious rights, democracy, freedom of expression, freedom of
association, freedom of the media, and political freedom.
</P>
<P>
It also urges the E.U. Commission and the Council of Ministers to
make clear to Beijing that a genuine partnership can only develop
when shared values are fully respected and put into practice.
</P>
<P>
Expressing disappointment at the lack of substantial results from
human rights dialogues between the E.U. and China, the resolution
also invites the commission and council to voice their concerns about
the issues during their forthcoming session.

KMT LAWMAKER URGES GOVERNMENT TO BUY OUT HIGH SPEED RAILWAY
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei, Sept. 9 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Legislator Chou
Hsi-wei suggested Friday that the administration buy out the
high-speed rail project and its builder before the entire project
goes down the drain.
</P>
<P>
Chou claimed that Taiwan High-Speed Rail Corp. (THSRC) and the
high-speed rail project that it has been building over the past five
years may go bankrupt as a result of a snowballing deficit assessed
to top NT$1 trillion (US$31.25 billion) , consequently leaving
Taiwan's first high-speed railway in jeopardy.
</P>
<P>
He suggested that the administration, which will foot the bills
for 87 percent of the costs of the entire project according to
agreements, gain complete control of the multimillion-dollar rail
system that is Taiwan's first infrastructure project being built
under the build-operate-transfer (BOT) model.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Chou, who has announced his bid to run for the
magistrate seat in Taiwan's largest county of Taipei, also suggested
that the Legislative Yuan set up a high-speed rail ad hoc group to
look into any irregularities in THSRC operations and its financing.
</P>
<P>
Chou said that the Legislative Yuan ad hoc group should be
established as soon as possible to find out whether there has been
interest-peddling and collusion, whether the Japan-based Taiwan
Shinkansen Consortium (TSC) has sustained any influence or pressure
from former President Lee Teng-hui or President Chen Shui-bian, and
whether professional judgment and decisions have been compromised
because of politics.
</P>
<P>
THSRC Chairwoman Nita Ing announced Thursday that the launch of
the railway will be postponed for one year until Oct. 31, 2006,
citing various reasons, including an overall consideration of the
progress of the construction, system tests and operation
preparations. Ing was unwilling to identify where the faults lie but
said that the Japanese Shinkansen system is "more complex" than
expected.
</P>
<P>
Ing apologized to investors and the public over the decision, but
claimed she is confident of achieving the new goal of launching the
high-speed railway by October next year.
</P>
<P>
However, THSRC officials said construction of core mechanical and
electrical systems have lagged behind schedule by more than 30
percent, affecting system tests and operation preparations, while the
the head of TSC, which is providing train carriages and is the main
contractor of the mechanical and electrical system, admitted that the
two sides had "found it hard to reach consensus."
</P>
<P>
Chou lashed out at THSRC for "abusing" the spirit of a BOT
project, questioning what kind of BOT the high-speed rail is as the
government is paying more than NT$400 billion while the private
investors are footing only NT$19.2 billion. In addition, he said, the
government will have to pay an extra NT$50 billion because of the
one-year postponement, which will increase the total cost of the
railway to NT$480 billion.

</P>
<P>
The 345-km high-speed railway linking Taipei in the north and
Kaohsiung in the south will form the backbone of western Taiwan's
mass rapid transportation network that it is claimed will reduce
travel time between Taipei and Kaohsiung to 90 minutes. The system
will connect eight metropolitan areas between Taiwan's two largest
cities and will be able to transport at least 300,000 passengers
daily when it becomes fully operational.

FAMILY OF DEAD ARMY CAPTAIN MAY SEEK STATE COMPENSATION
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Sept. 9 (CNA)
(By Han Nai-kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The family of an army captain killed in an
accident Wednesday is entitled to seek state compensation after
Department of Health (DOH) officials squandered his fiancee's
opportunity to harvest his sperm, leaving her unable to have his
offspring, a lawmaker said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Wu Fu-quei of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party told a
press conference at the Legislative Yuan that the 1994 Assisted
Reproductive Technology Control Measures cited by DOH officials to
dissuade the fiancee from making use of the in vitro fertilization
method has not been passed by the legislature.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the legislative process of the Artificial
Reproduction Bill is still incomplete, Wu said.
</P>
<P>
He criticized the DOH officials as being "cruel" and "negligent,"
and vowed to help the woman to seek state compensation.
</P>
<P>
Capt. Sun Chi-hsiang, a 29-year-old company leader, was killed
while guiding a tank onto a truck. The vehicle accelerated suddenly
and lost control, crushing him to death. His 26-year-old fiancee, Li
Hsin-yu, begged the Minister of National Defense and other
authorities to have his sperm preserved in the hope that she could
bear his child through artificial insemination.
</P>
<P>
Also speaking at the press conference, attorney Huang Kun-chian
pointed out that there is no law in Taiwan that forbids the
harvesting of sperm after death and he claimed that the DOH officials
who relied on executive orders to dissuade Li from her planned move
violated the spirit of the Constitution through obstruction of her
freedom.
</P>
<P>
Su Shu-cheng, head of the Bureau of Health Promotion under the
DOH, defended the DOH, saying that DOH officials did not cite any
relevant law but only used what she described as "moral persuasion."
</P>
<P>
She claimed that although there is no law banning the harvesting
of sperm, a medical practitioner involved in this behavior could
still be penalized for violating professional ethics under the
Doctor's Law.
</P>
<P>
Her claims, however, were contradicted by Maj. Gen. Liu
Chih-chien, a spokesman for the Ministry of National Defense, who
said the ministry had asked the DOH's Bureau of Health Promotion to
clarify the situation and was told that according to the current
"Assisted Reproductive Technology Control Measures, " the plan to
obtain the dead captain's sperm should not be allowed to proceed.
</P>
<P>
A statement issued by legislators on behalf of Li deplored that
the only hope of prolonging the Sun family lineage was shattered and
it called on the nation to pay more attention to the issue so that
other families in similar situations will not have to suffer similar
heartache.

PRESIDENTIAL OFFICE MUM ON SOUTH KOREAN APEC AMBASSADOR'S COMMENTS
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Sept.  9 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Presidential Office declined to make
any comments Friday on a foreign wire service report that South Korea
has rejected a request from Taiwan's president to be allowed to take
part in the 2005 informal leadership meeting of the Asia-Pacific
Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum in November.
</P>
<P>
"We cannot comment since we were not aware of the report, "
Presidential Office Deputy Secretary-General James Huang said.
</P>
<P>
President Chen Shui-bian has on many occasions expressed his
strong desire to attend the upcoming APEC summit meeting in person,
saying it would be an historic moment if both he and North Korean
leader Kim Jong-il could attend the 2005 APEC summit in South Korea's
second-largest city of Busan Nov. 18-19.
</P>
<P>
A foreign wire service report quoted South Korea's APEC
Ambassador Kim Jong-hoon as saying Friday that he fully understands
President Chen's stance, but he added that since 1993, a Taiwanese
presidential envoy has been taking part in APEC summits to represent
the island.
</P>
<P>
"It's difficult for him to take part [in the forum] unless an
agreement between all APEC member states is forthcoming, " Kim was
quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Because of Beijing's obstruction, the Republic of China's head of
state was unable to attend previous APEC annual informal leadership
meetings and instead had to name a proxy to attend on his behalf.
</P>
<P>
Asked who will be Chen's representative if he is still barred
from attending this year's APEC summit, Huang said the government
must name a high-ranking official to attend to show Taiwan's respect
for the APEC summit.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a Presidential Office official, who spoke on condition
of anonymity, said President Chen would not lose any opportunity to
upgrade Taiwan's international profile and expand its diplomatic
frontiers.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to his unflagging efforts, the official said, Chen managed
to attend the late Pope John Paul II's funeral in the Vatican earlier
this year. "In the same spirit, he is seeking another opportunity to
enhance Taiwan's international presence," the official added.

NEW ANTI-SMOKING ALLIANCE WANTS CIGARETTE PRICES DOUBLED
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  Sept. 9 (CNA)
(By Han Nai-kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taiwan's medical groups formed an alliance
against smoking Friday and is asking the government to double the
price of a pack of cigarettes.
</P>
<P>
The alliance's founding members include the Taiwan Medical
Association, the Formosan Medical Association, the Taiwan Association
of Family Medicine, the Taiwan Society for Adolescent Medicine and
Health, the Taiwan Family Medicine Education Research Institute and
the Taiwan Pediatric Association.
</P>
<P>
Lee Meng-chin, president of the Taiwan Pediatric Association,
told the media that according to calculations in a study by the World
Health Organization, for every NT$10 added to the price of a pack of
cigarettes, the number of smokers could drop 5 percent.
</P>
<P>
He said the alliance wants the legislature to pass a law allowing
the price of cigarettes to be doubled.
</P>
<P>
Currently a Taiwan-produced brand costs about NT$40 a pack, while
an imported foreign brand costs NT$50 to NT$70 a pack.
</P>
<P>
Lee cited statistics from health authorities as showing that of
the NT$370 billion expenditure on health care in Taiwan each year,
about NT$20 billion is spent on treating smoking-related diseases.
</P>
<P>
He said there is no doubt that cigarette smoking has become a
major killer of Taiwan's people, and that the government should pass
a law to impose a total ban on smoking in public places, schools and
working environments.

President Chen Shui-bian made a half-day
inspection tour of the Taiwan-held frontline island of Matsu Friday
to boost morale of troops garrisoned there ahead of this year's
Mid-Autumn Festival, which on Sept. 18.
</P>
<P>
Chen arrived at Matsu's Nankan Airport at 8 a.m. He then traveled
to Matsu's outlying islets -- Tungyin, Liangtao, Kaoteng, Tunglu and
Hsilu -- via a military helicopter to greet all military personnel
and thank them for their devoted service to the country.

Chen returned to Nankan around noon. He lunched with staff
members of the Matsu Defense Command and representatives of various
military units stationed in Matsu, which lies closer to China's
southeastern province of Fujian than to Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the lunch meeting, Chen expressed his admiration for
the high morale shown by all troops posted on the frontline island
and their contributions to national defense.
</P>
<P>
Before returning to Taiwan in the afternoon, Chen also inspected
the Chengkung ammunition depot where a string of explosions took

was briefed on the situation, the cause of the blast and the

PRESIDENT'S CHIEF OF STAFF RETURNS TO TAIWAN FROM JAPAN
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Sept. 9 (CNA)
(By Elizabeth Hsu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Yu Shyi-kun, chief of staff of President
Chen Shui-bian, returned home Friday from Tokyo where he had been
taking part in the 2005 Taiwan-Japan Forum Sept. 6-7.
</P>
<P>
At a news conference at the Chiang Kai-shek Airport, Yu described
himself as a key window for private and official dialogues between
Taiwan and Japan. During his five-day stay in Japan, he met with
several old friends including former Japanese Prime Minister Yasuhiro
Nakasone and Tokyo Governor Shintaro Ishihara, Yu said.
</P>
<P>
He said topics of discussion at the forum were mostly centered on
what measures Taiwan and Japan have to take in the face of China's
rise.
</P>
<P>
Yu stated that he proposed that Taiwan and Japan update the
so-called "1972 mechanism, " which was established after Japan
switched diplomatic recognition from Taipei to Beijing. Under the
mechanism, the two countries have to deal with each other through
quasi-official intermediary bodies.
</P>
<P>
The reason Japan and the United States have listed peace in the
Taiwan Strait as one of their strategic goals in defense cooperation,
Yu said, is because they worry about China's non-peaceful rise.
Beijing's enactment of its Anti-Secession Law in April has obviously
impacted the desire for peace in the Strait, he added.
</P>
<P>
Given all this, Taiwan and Japan should review their relationship
under the "1972 mechanism, " Yu said, adding that he believes Japan
should also be prepared to deal with an "irrational anti-Japanese
trend" that is expanding in China.
</P>
<P>
Besides that, Yu said he hoped that the two countries could sign
a free trade agreement. He explained that a Taiwan-Japan FTA would
not only serve as an affirmation to Taiwan's economic strength, but
also encourage more countries to sign similar agreements with Taiwan,
a situation that would help regional peace and the implementation of
the Japan-U.S. security pact.
</P>
<P>
Yu was the highest-ranking Republic of China official to attend a
public event in Japan since the two countries severed diplomatic ties
in 1972.

FISHERMEN WILL FACE THE MUSIC FOR SAILING DIRECTLY TO CHINA: MAC
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Sept. 9 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A flotilla of Taiwan fishermen who sailed
directly to China Friday on a pilgrimage to honor Matsu, the goddess
of fisherman, will have to face the consequences of its unauthorized
action, an official of the Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) said
Friday.
</P>
<P>
MAC spokesman You Ying-lung said 21 fishing boats and 129
fishermen sailed to Meizhou, Fujian in southern China from their home
port in Ilan Wednesday night and arrived Friday.
</P>
<P>
You said his office has cautioned the fishermen before that
sailing directly to China is not allowed unless the voyage is
approved by the government in advance.
</P>
<P>
However, the leader of the flotilla, the abbot of a temple called
Nantiengung in Ilan, said they didn't intend to sail to China but
might take refuge there from Typhoon Khanum, which is expected to
start affecting Taiwan Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Each boat in the flotilla carried a statuette of Matsu, and
Meizhou is believed to be her home.
</P>
<P>
MAC official Yang Chia-chun said the Coast Guard Administration's
patrol boats followed the flotilla but returned after losing sight of
the boats when they left Taiwan's territorial waters and mingled with
a number of Chinese fishing boats.
</P>
<P>
Information from China confirmed that the flotilla arrived in
Meizhou Friday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Noting that another group of Matsu's followers, also from Ilan,
flew to Meizhou via the frontline island of Matsu the same day with
the MAC' s permission, Yang said he didn't understand why the
fishermen didn't bother to apply for permission for their pilgrimage,
which has been approved in previous years, and why they should risk
their lives by starting the voyage under the threat of a typhoon.
</P>
<P>
The MAC official said when his office contacted the flotilla
this morning, they gave the MAC their location as being somewhere in
Japanese territorial waters when they were actually asking the
Chinese for permission to enter their waters.
</P>
<P>
Calling the move an open challenge to the authorities, the MAC
official said the fishermen will be investigated for breaking the law
after they return.

The Central Weather Bureau issued a sea
warning for Typhoon Khanun Friday evening.
</P>
<P>
Bureau meteorologists warned ships sailing or operating in waters
north, northeast and southeast of Taiwan to be on alert against rough
seas, suggesting that no activities should take place on the beaches
along the coasts of the eastern part of Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
It is expected that a land warning will be issued at between 5:00

DOH REVERSES DECISION, WILL ALLOW SPERM HARVEST FROM DECEASED MAN
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei, Sept.  9 (CNA)
(By Han Nai-kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Department of Health reversed its
position Friday evening and agreed to a woman's plea to harvest sperm
from her dead fiance so that she could use in vitro fertilization in
an attempt to get pregnant.
</P>
<P>
The health department made the decision following an emergency
meeting between its officials and experts on legal and medical
affairs. The meeting reached the conclusion that since the
legislative process of the Artificial Reproduction Bill is still
incomplete, the sperm harvesting would not break any law.
</P>
<P>
However, the Bureau of Health Promotion under the health
department indicated that another meeting with experts will take
place next week to discuss whether to allow the artificial
insemination.
</P>
<P>
Shortly after the health department gave the green light, an ROC
Army doctor successfully obtained the sperm from the deceased man --
Capt. Sun Chi-hsiang, 29, who was killed Wednesday when the armored
vehicle he was trying to guide onto a truck accelerated suddenly and
crushed him.
Sun's 26-year-old fiancee, Li Hsin-yu, who begged authorities to
have his sperm preserved Thursday but to no avail, was elated after
learning that she now has a chance to bear his child.
</P>
<P>
However, it is uncertain whether the plan could succeed because
experts say the window of opportunity -- the first 48 hours after the
man's death -- to harvest the sperm has closed.
</P>
<P>
The chance of success would now depend on the vitality of the
sperm, according to experts.

58.5% WANT GOVERNMENT TO HAVE LEAD ROLE IN CROSS-STRAIT TALKS: POLL
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Sept.  9 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Just over 58 percent of respondents to a
recent opinion poll said they agree to the view that government's
leadership is needed in talks with China to better protect national
interests, the Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) said Friday.
</P>
<P>
MAC Vice Chairman You Ying-lung told a news conference that the
Cabinet-level council commissioned National Chengchi University's
election research center to conduct a telephone poll from Aug. 26-28
to explore local adult residents' views on relations across the
Taiwan Strait. A total of 1,096 valid samples were collected, with a
margin of error of 2.96 percent.
</P>
<P>
More than 60 percent of those surveyed said they think that
China's military expansion has threatened the national security of
Taiwan and other neighboring countries, You said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, 63.6 percent said they support President Chen
Shui-bian's proposal that top leaders of major domestic political
parties hold a summit meeting to forge a consensus on the development
of cross-strait relations.
</P>
<P>
According to the survey results, 81.4 percent said they feel that
domestic political parties should abide by the law and government
regulations in their engagements with China and should put national
interests above everything else.
</P>
<P>
The poll also found that 56.3 percent of the respondents support
more stringent management of cross-strait social exchanges.
</P>
<P>
About 76 percent were against China's practice of pressuring
Taiwan to accept individuals or groups designated by it as Taiwan's
representatives in cross-strait talks, and 51.5 percent said they
don't think that China has sincerity in starting negotiations with
Taiwan.

said they were proud of Siew, who served as Taiwan's premier from
1997 to 2000, because he held the position equal to that of current
Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao.
</P>
<P>
In the temple, Siew led his wife and daughter to kneel in front
of the spiritual tablet of the Siew clan's ancestors, kowtowed three
times and gave offerings before unveiling the tablet he donated to
the temple.
</P>
<P>
He said it has been a lifelong desire to greet his ancient
ancestors at the family temple in Xiamen, and now his dream has come
true and he felt that his ancestors in Taiwan would feel comfortable
because he finally made the trip.
</P>
<P>
The temple, founded in 1515 and rebuilt in 1998, is the clan
temple of most Siew families in southern China, Taiwan and overseas.
Xiamen authorities designed it as a cultural heritage in August
because it houses the spiritual tablet of the ancestors to many Siew
families in Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Siew, who was born in Chiayi in 1939, has been a promoter of the
establishment of a common market between Taiwan and China since after
he left the premiership.
</P>
<P>
He came to Xiamen early this week to attend an economic forum and
will now tour central China.

<TEXT>
<P>
The death toll from an explosion at a
weaponry factory in Kaohsiung County Friday morning rose to three,
the Ministry of National Defense said.
</P>
<P>
Two soldiers -- Chiu Kuo-chen, a sergeant first class, and Hsu
Ming-cheng, a staff sergeant -- were killed immediately after a
machine used in the production of ammunition blew up at the
military-run factory in Kaohsiung County's Tashu township.
</P>
<P>
A third soldier, identified as Su Ching-kuo, also a staff
sergeant, sustained critical injuries in the blast. Even though a
medical team performed difficult surgery in efforts to save his life,
Su died in the afternoon, a military spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Minister of National Defense Lee Jye traveled to Kaohsiung in the
evening to visit the families of the three deceased soldiers. Lee
promised to offer the best possible pecuniary aid to the soldiers'
bereaved families and assist them in handling the aftermath.
</P>
<P>
Lee said the defense ministry has formed a special task force to
investigate the cause of the fatal accident.
</P>
<P>
The blast came just two days after a string of explosions rocked
an ammunition depot on the Taiwan-held frontline island of Matsu,
which lies closer to China's Fujian province than to Taiwan. No one
was injured, and the military is still investigating the explosions.
</P>
<P>
Also on Wednesday, Army Capt. Sun Chi-hsiang was killed when an
armored vehicle suddenly accelerated during an operation at a
military base in central Taiwan. Investigators are still probing the
case.
</P>
<P>
MND spokesman Rear Adm. Liu Chih-chien said Lee has ordered a
thorough review of military operations and sorted out all the causes
of those accidents in order to draft improvement measures.
</P>
<P>
Before the causes are determined, Liu said, relevant operations
will be suspended for safety concerns.

</P>
<P>
The signing was completed at the fourth Taiwan-Vietnam trade and

Under the trade accord, Taiwan exports to Vietnam will be
entitled to tariffs at a preferential rate, representing a 50

Vietnam will offer Taiwan the most privileged treatment in trade
even before it becomes a formal WTO member. Taiwan will in return
provide the country the same trade treatment as other WTO state
members enjoy.
</P>

In total, Vietnam has promised a significant tariff reduction to
over 200 items of Taiwan's agricultural and non-agricultural
products, while answering Taiwan's demand for the opening of
computer, banking, marketing, telecommunication, insurance and
transportation markets, the officials said.

the chamber killing the impeachment process, moving to
its second option of initiating a "shame campaign"

In a seemingly surprise, last-minute move,
President Macapagal-Arroyo designated Armed Forces
Deputy Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Edilberto Adan,
replacing the retiring Lt. Gen. Alberto Braganza.
Adan's assumption of the command yesterday promptly
stirred a new controversy in the military as the Board
of Generals (BOG) had earlier recommended Maj. Gen.
Samuel Bagasin to the post.

Typhoon Khanun has drifted north of its
earlier projected path and will likely skirt the northern tip of the
island, having less of an impact that anticipated, according to the

<P>
As Typhoon Khanun approaches Taiwan, the
average price of vegetables skyrocketed to a record high of NT$47.3
(US$1.45) per kilogram on the wholesale market in Taipei Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Statistics from the Taipei Agricultural Products Marketing Co.
showed that the price surged NT$5.34 over the level of Friday, and
broke the historical record of NT$43.2 per kilogram, seen right after
Typhoon Talim rampaged through Taiwan Sept. 1.
</P>
<P>
The market received a total of 1,005 tons of vegetables Saturday,
up 168 tons over the previous day. Despite the increasing supply,
prices of most kinds of vegetables still went up, with that of
scallion from Ilan, northern Taiwan posing a significant growth to
NT$420 per kilogram.
</P>
<P>
Officials of the Cabinet-level Council of Agriculture blamed the
hike on the public's anticipation of typhoon devastation. To meet the
demand, the council has been working to release frozen stocks, while
offering half-price tariffs to imported supplies.
</P>
<P>
Several hundreds tons of imported vegetables are expected to flow
into the market by Monday, the officials said.

President Chen Shui-bian praised the
quality of pomelos grown in Matou township of Tainan in southern
Taiwan Saturday during a visit to his hometown, saying that he
intends to present the seasonal fruit to foreign diplomatic missions
stationed in Taiwan as a gift in celebration of the Chinese
traditional Mid-Autumn Festival, which will fall on Sept. 18 this
year.
</P>
<P>
Chen made the announcement after growers complained that the
president cared less about the sales of fruits grown in his hometown
than those from other places, referring to pomelos from Touliou in
Yulin County, central Taiwan, which Chen recently commended. The
president was born in Tainan. 
</P>
<P>
On his visit to Tainan, Chen met with local residents after
visiting a temple, where he paid his respects after winning the
presidential election in 2000. He then turned to Shanhua township for
a beer festival.
</P>
<P>
At the event, Chen sampled Taiwan beef and beer, praising the two
locally produced items, saying that they go with each other
perfectly.
</P>
<P>
Encouraging the traditional manufacturing industry on the island
to try to transform itself into a modern leisure-oriented industry,
Chen suggested that local manufacturers try to dedicate themselves to
the development of goods with added value, and try out new ideas.

Taking Taiwan beer as an example, he said local beer will sell

The World Forum for Democratization in
Asia (WFDA) would be a useful tool for the United Nations and would
provide valuable counseling, an official said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Michael Ying-mao Kau, executive director of the Taiwan Foundation
for Democracy (TFD) and vice foreign affairs minister, made the
announcement during a Central News Agency interview Saturday. The TFD
was founded in June 2003 with support from the Ministry of Foreign
Affairs and the Legislative Yuan.
</P>
<P>
The inaugural WFDA meeting is set for Sept. 15-17 at the Taipei
International Convention Center.
</P>
<P>
Kau noted that in addition to inviting former President Lee
Teng-hui and four former national leaders from countries that have no
diplomatic relations with the Republic of China to attend the
inaugural meeting of the WFDA next week to share their experience in
promoting democracy, experts and democracy activists from Europe,
America and Africa will also attend the biennial meeting. 

</P>
<P>
Initiated by the TFD, Kau said several leading democratic
institutes in Asia forged a consensus to promote the WFDA.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the organizational team was inaugurated in October
2004, and its members included the TFD, the Alliance for Reform and
Democracy in Asia, the Alternative Asean Network on Burma, Forum Asia
Democracy, and Initiatives for International Dialogue. The chairmen
of the non-governmental organizations will come to Taipei to attend
the meeting, he said.
</P>
<P>
Kau said that the inaugural meeting will discuss and adopt
guidelines to promote the solidarity of Asian democracies, support
democracy activists who are opposed to authoritarian regimes, and
solicit support from the international community on democratization
in Asia.
</P>
<P>
The plan is to submit the guidelines to the United Nations'
Secretariat and member states for reference, and obtain the status of
providing counselling to the U.N. so that the views of the WFDA can
be passed to related meetings in the U.N. and Asia's democratic voice
can be strengthened in the United Nations, he said.
</P>
<P>
Another focus of the meeting will be to discuss the formation of
an index on which to gauge the quality of democratic countries in
Asia.

PFP TO PRESENT BILL GOVERNING BUILD-OPERATE-TRANSFER PROGRAMS
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei, Sept. 10 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The opposition People First Party (PFP) is
working on a bill to provide the government with the legal framework
to monitor the build-operate-transfer programs in the country, a PFP
lawmaker said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Hwang Yih-jiau, the convener of the PFP legislative caucus,
said the bill, drafted by experts and scholars under commission of
the party, will also give the Legislative Yuan a role in supervising
these programs, including the Kaohsiung Mass Rapid Transit System and
the Taiwan high-speed rail, although construction on the two projects
is already underway by the Kaohsiung Rapid Transit Corporation (KRTC)
and the Taiwan High Speed Rail Corp. (THSRC), respectively.
</P>
<P>
The bill is almost finished except for a few parts which still
have to be fleshed out and has received a positive response from the
party's political ally in the legislature, the Kuomintang, Hwang went
on.
</P>
<P>
Hwang said the PFP bill will oblige owners of private companies
that win the right to build public BOT projects to follow the law
regarding procedures, and give regular reports to the legislature.
</P>
<P>
According to the bill, Hwang said, major public BOT projects
should be examined by foreign experts before the government accepts
them.
</P>
<P>
Citing the Kaohsiung Mass Rapid Transit System and Taiwan
high-speed rail as examples, Hwang claimed that currently the
government has no way of controlling the private companies authorized
to build these projects, although the government has provided the
largest share of funds for their construction.
</P>
<P>
In order to bring these two projects under the control of the
government and legislature, Hwang said the bill, if enacted, should
be applied retroactively.
</P>
<P>
Both the KRTC and the THSRC have been embroiled in controversies
recently after Thai workers at the KRTC rioted to protest bad
treatment from the management, and the THSRC admitting that it could
not meet the government's deadline to open the rail line in October
of this year.

GETTING THE RIGHT CARICATURE NO LAUGHING MATTER AT APEC EXHIBITION
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Sept.  10 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It's only natural for South Korea to
display a caricature of President Chen Shui-bian alongside his
counterparts from 20 other member states in the Asia-Pacific Economic
Cooperation (APEC) forum who will attend the 2005 informal leadership
meeting in Busan later this year, according to the Ministry of
Foreign Affairs.
</P>
<P>
Ministry spokesman Michel Lu made the remarks Saturday after the
Busan City Government changed the caricature of the ROC's leader from
Lee Yuan-tseh, the president of Academia Sinica, Taiwan's highest
research institute, to that of President Chen, at an exhibition
thanks to the tenacious efforts of Taipei's representative office in
South Korea.
</P>
<P>
Taipei's mission in South Korea said after the change that the
caricature of Chen will help the South Korean public learn more about
who the leader of the ROC really is.
</P>
<P>
The mission noted that in an APEC summit caricature exhibition
that opened Sept. 5, the caricature of the ROC leader was shown as
Lee.
</P>
<P>
The mission then negotiated with South Korean Ministry of
Foreign Affairs and Trade and it in turn notified the Busan City
Government and the Busan Cartoon Club, the sponsors of the
exhibition, to replace the caricature to one of President Chen
Friday.
</P>
<P>
The mission gave three reasons to convince South Korea to make
the change: the exhibition is a cultural event and is not related to
any political activity; the exhibition shows the caricatures of the
21 APEC members' heads of state and Chen is the president of the
Republic of China on Taiwan; and as President Chen has yet to make a
decision on whether to attend the meeting, it should respect the
member economy of "Chinese Taipei."
</P>
<P>
Moreover, it is only natural to display the caricature of
President Chen to avoid confusion. Chen is depicted in the caricature
as in high spirits and all smiles.
</P>
<P>
The Busan Cartoon Club revealed that before the exhibition, the
foreign affairs authorities has told them that the exhibition should
show those who will attend the 2005 APEC summit in South Korea's
second-largest city of Busan Nov. 18-19. For this reason, if the
picture shown is someone who isn't going to come, then it would be
inappropriate. Therefore, the club was forced to replace the original
caricature of President Chen to that of Lee.
</P>
<P>
The show is expected to close Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
Because of Beijing's objections, the Republic of China's head of
state has been unable to attend previous APEC annual informal
leadership meetings and has instead had to name a proxy to attend on
his behalf.

PREMIER GIVES PRIORITY TO FLOOD-CONTROL BILL
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>

(By Maubo Chang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The bill for a comprehensive national
flood-control program should be the top priority for the next
legislative session that opens Sept. 13, Premier Frank Hsieh said
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Emerging from a conference with his Cabinet in Kaohsiung, the
premier said he is amenable to debating the bill with the opposition
who has threatened to kill the legislation on the grounds that it's
nothing but pork barrel politics.
</P>
<P>
Other bills high on the premier's priority list include draft
statutes to introduce a minimum tax system, to modify the debt-laden
national insurance program, to reorganize the Executive Yuan and to
impose income tax on military personnel and teachers.
</P>
<P>
He denied that he had given up his efforts to reconcile with the
opposition-controlled legislature when he challenged the opposition
Sept. 3 to oust his Cabinet with a non-confidence vote if they turned
down his administration's request for a budget for the eight-year,
NT$80 billion flood-control program, arguing that it was simply a way
to break the political impasse between the executive and legislative
branches.
</P>
<P>
The premier said, a non-confidence vote, which would lead
eventually to asnap general election, is a mechanism provided for in
the Constitution to settle disputes between the executive and
legislative branches by the voters.

DOH HEAD URGES RATIONAL DISCUSSION ON ARTIFICIAL REPRODUCTION
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei, Sept. 10 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Department of Health Minister Ho Sheng-mao
said Saturday that the public should rationally discuss whether to
ease the current restrictions on artificial reproduction.
</P>
<P>
Ho made the remarks during a seminar on the performance of
Premier Frank Hsieh's Cabinet in Kaohsiung, southern Taiwan, amid
public concern about an accidental death of an army captain and his
fiancee's request that his sperm be preserved in the hope that she
could bear his child through artificial insemination.
</P>
<P>
Premier Hsieh cited the example of preserving evidence before any
litigation process to say that the sperm should be preserved first
before discussing its use within legal boundaries.
</P>
<P>
Otherwise, the precious timing may be lost forever, he said,
adding that members of his Cabinet should take the initiative in
solving problems.
</P>
<P>
Ho also said that he is glad to learn that the sperm is being
preserved, and now is the time for everyone to discuss the matter
rationally.
</P>
<P>
The incident could be considered from several points of view, Ho
pointed out, including if the current conditions for artificial
reproduction -- which targets barren and living husbands and wives --
can be eased, whether it can be set as a common practice for
harvesting sperm after death, and whether ethics and folk customs can
accept the practice, as well as taking stock of similar examples from
other countries.
</P>
<P>
Capt. Sun Chi-hsiang, a 29-year-old company leader, was killed
while guiding a tank onto a truck. The vehicle accelerated suddenly
and lost control, crushing him to death. His 26-year-old fiancee, Lee
Hsin-yu, begged the Minister of National Defense and other
authorities to have his sperm preserved.
</P>
<P>
Lee came to an obs-gyn clinic in Taichung, central Taiwan, where
Sun's sperm is being kept.
</P>
<P>
Lee, who came for a checkup, listened to the advice of a doctor
who reminded her that the success rate for reproduction using
a dead man's sperm for artificial insemination is lower and the risks
for abortion or deformity are high.
</P>
<P>
Lee, who earlier was relieved after learning that her request to
harvest the sperm was approved, was determined despite the reminder,
saying that she has to try to give Sun a baby.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Taiwanese Society for Reproductive Medicine on
Saturday urged thorough consideration to protect the reproduction
rights of single women.
</P>
<P>
Liu Chih-hung, president of the society, said that in
developed countries, the reproduction right of single women is
protected and considered a basic human right. But in Taiwan, the
public has never given this much thought.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out the first article of a draft Artificial
Reproduction Bill stipulates that it will only protect the
reproduction right of infertile couples, which he said narrowly
defines and neglects the reproduction rights of single women, and is
not in tune with the social situation, citing the examples of Nita
Ing, chairwoman of Taiwan High-Speed Rail Corp., and actress Jodie
Foster, saying that society does not discriminated against them
because they are single and have children.

NEW HEADS FOR LABOR AFFAIRS AND KAOHSIUNG CITY MAY NAMED SOON
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  Sept.  10 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Premier Frank Hsieh suggested Saturday
that he might have to name new chiefs for the Council of Labor
Affairs (CLA) and the Kaohsiung city before Sept. 13 when the
Legislative Yuan begins its new session.
</P>
<P>
Hsieh told journalists after a meeting with his Cabinet members
in Kaohsiung that he talked with Chen Chih-mai 
the acting mayor of the Kaohsiung city
who offered to quit over a riot staged by Thai workers in Kaohsiung,
but couldn't persuade Chen to change his mind.
</P>
<P>
The premier said he may also have to name a new head for the CLA
after its minister Chen Chu resigned to take responsibility for the
same riot of Thai workers.
</P>
<P>
Hsieh said both Chens were cleared of any responsibility for the
incident according to an investigation conducted by his
administration, but none of them would withdraw their resignations,
Hsieh said, adding he would take a decision on their resignations
before the Legislative Yuan gather for the next session.
</P>
<P>
Chen Chu and Chen Chih-mai didn't showup for Saturday's
Cabinet meeting.
</P>
<P>
The riot which triggered their resignation took place on Aug. 21
when a group of Thai workers employed to build the Kaohsiung Mass
Rapid Transit systems smashed and set fire to their dormitory to vent
their anger with the inhuman treatment from the management.
</P>
<P>
The riot tarnished the image of the country although no
casualties were reported.

ANG LEE'S LATEST WINS GOLDEN LION AT VENICE FILM FESTIVAL

<TEXT>
<P>
Renowned Taiwan-born director Ang Lee has
done it again, with his latest work -- "Brokeback Mountain" --
winning the Golden Lion for best movie at the Venice Film Festival
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"Brokeback Mountain, " a Canadian-produced film starring Heath
Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal as two gay cowboys in the conservative
American West of the 1960s, bested 19 other films to win the top
award at the 62nd Venice Film Festival.
</P>
<P>
Receiving the award from Japanese animation film director Hayao
Miyazaki, who won this year's Golden Lion Lifetime Achievement Award,
Lee said: "I want to thank Annie Proulx for writing this moving great
American love story that brought all of us together to make this
movie."
</P>
<P>
"Thank you all for your support," he added in Chinese.
</P>
<P>
Lee, whose other masterpieces include "Sense and Sensibility"
(1995) and "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon" (2000) , described
"Brokeback Mountain" as a "unique and universal" story. "I'm so glad
it's prevailed here and was received so warmly here."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, another Taiwan director, Lin Chien-ping, took the
Leone Citroen Award for best short film, for his "Xiaozhan" (Small
Station).
</P>
<P>
The 30-minute short film tells the story of a mother who takes
her alienated and autistic adult son on a trip to a small town simply
to watch trains at a railway station. The story, set in modern day
Taiwan, tells how people who were labeled as "abnormal" by society
struggled with despair and discrimination.
</P>
<P>
Lin's short film beat out nearly 800 other short films that
entered in this year's Venice Film Festival, which witnessed the
participation of a total of 1,907 films of various kinds.
</P>
<P>
The 62nd Venice Film Festival was described as being "very
Asian," with its opening film being "Seven Swords," a feature by Hong
Kong director Tsui Hark, and its closing film being "Perhaps Love" by
Hong Kong director Peter Chan.

TAIWAN FESTIVAL CHARMS BRITISH AUDIENCE

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A two-day "Taiwan Festival" program kicked
off at Brent Cross Shopping Center in northern London Saturday,
attracting large numbers of British shoppers to participate.
</P>
<P>
The festival has been organized by the Taipei Representative
Office in the United Kingdom, which represents Taiwan's interests in
Britain in the absence of diplomatic ties, as part of its efforts to
promote bilateral cultural and civilian exchanges.
</P>
<P>
"The program is aimed at highlighting the differences between
Taiwanese and Chinese performing arts and cultures, as well as
helping British citizens understand that 'China is China, Taiwan is
Taiwan,'" said Edgar Lin, the Republic of China's de facto ambassador
to the U.K.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the opening ceremony, Lin said British citizens are
welcome to take part in all the activities presented in the festival.
He also took the opportunity to introduce the beauty of Taiwan's arts
and culture.
</P>
<P>
Lin also introduced to the British audience Taiwan's master
puppeteer Chen Hsi-huang, who has traveled to London to introduce
Taiwan's unique style of puppetry.
</P>
<P>
Chen led his Tataocheng Puppet Troupe in putting on three
dazzling puppet shows at Brent Cross Shopping Center Saturday,
winning loud applause from the British audience. At the end of each
show, Chen also demonstrated to some of the children in the audience
how to manipulate the unique Taiwan puppets.
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, the Taipei Representative Office also arranged for
Taiwan expatriates in Britain to present paper-cutting and
calligraphic arts as part of the festival activities.
</P>
<P>
Special Taiwanese delicacies, including pineapple tarts, as well
as handicrafts were handed out to shoppers. Two Taiwan carriers --
China Airlines and EVA Airways -- and BenQ computer company offered
plane tickets and digital cameras as gifts for winners of a
Taiwan-focused quiz show.
</P>
<P>
In the past, Lin said, Taiwanese culture and performing arts were
usually presented in London as part of the activities in the "Chinese
festival" organized by the Chinese Embassy and the municipality of
London.
</P>
<P>
Lin said such arrangements apparently treated Taiwan as part of
China and didn't really allow Taiwan to introduce the unique features
of its culture to Londoners.

TWO PROPOSALS ON TAIWAN'S U.N. BID TO BE SCREENED BY GENERAL COMMITTEE

Two proposals submitted by Republic of
China allies supporting Taiwan's bid to join the United Nations have
been listed to be screened by the U.N. General Committee to decide
whether or not they will be put on the U.N. General Assembly's
agenda.
</P>
<P>
Unlike previous years, Taiwan's diplomatic allies have presented
two proposals to the U.N. Secretariat this year -- "the U.N. play an
active role in ensuring peace in the Taiwan Strait" and that "the
U.N. recognize the Taiwan people's right to representation" -- in the
hope that both proposals will be put on the U.N. agenda.
</P>
<P>
It is expected that the "peace" proposal, submitted by 15 ROC
allies, will be screened and voted on during the morning of Sept. 13,
when the 2005 U.N. General Assembly kicks off, while the
"representation" proposal, submitted by 12 ROC allies, will be
screened and voted on during the afternoon of the same day.
</P>
<P>
As more than 100 proposals are scheduled to be screened, the ROC
allies have suggested that the U.N. General Committee allow two
representatives who support the proposals regarding Taiwan and two
who are opposed to the proposals to debate the proposals in order to
accelerate the screening process. As of press time, it was uncertain
whether the General Committee would accept the suggestion.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Andrew Hsia, director of the Taipei Economic and
Cultural Office in New York, stressed Saturday that one of the goals
of Taiwan's "strenuous bid to enter the U.N. is to let the world
understand the pressing issue of the Taiwan Strait crisis."
</P>
<P>
Hsia said that the founding of the United Nations in 1945 was a
commitment to peace after years of war, referring to World War II,
adding that today's U.N. has a responsibility to work to prevent the
outbreak of military conflict in every region around the world.
</P>
<P>
He added that with China's passage in March of an anti-secession
law which sets the conditions for the use of force against Taiwan,
there is even more reason for Taiwan to draw the U.N.'s attention to
the heightening threats to peace and security in the Taiwan Strait.
</P>
<P>
"Only the U.N. can act as a forum for maintaining security and
peace," Hsia stressed.
</P>
<P>
Since 1993, Taiwan has tried every year through its diplomatic
allies to have its U.N. membership bid placed on the General
Assembly's agenda. However, it has been unsuccessful due to Beijing's
obstruction.
</P>
<P>
Last year, 21 of Taiwan's diplomatic allies voiced their support
for the island's U.N. bid at a General Committee meeting, although
the committee eventually decided not to put their proposal on the
U.N. General Assembly's agenda.
</P>
<P>
According to Hsia, Beijing mobilized 94 countries to voice
opposition to Taiwan's bid, dragging out the screening and voting
process and eventually defeating the proposal.
</P>
<P>
When the United Nations was founded in 1945, the Republic of
China was one of its founding members. However, the ROC has been shut
out of the body since 1971 when U.N. Resolution No. 2758 gave the
"China" seat to the People's Republic of China at the ROC's expense.

Taipei,  Sept.  11 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
New Vice Economic Affairs Minister Hou
Ho-hsiung will formally take up his duties Monday, government sources
said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Hou, 61, will fill the post left vacant by the transfer of Yiin
Chii-ming to serve as an Executive Yuan adviser over water supply
problems in the northern county of Taoyuan in the wake of Typhoon
Matsa in August.
</P>
<P>
In the past, the Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) assigned two
of its vice ministers to, respectively, oversee its two water
resources-related units -- the Water Resources Agency (WRA) and
Taiwan Water Corp. (TWC).
</P>
<P>
This arrangement will be changed after Hou assumes his post, MOEA
sources said. Hou will be charged with overseeing both WRA and TWC
operations with a view to speeding up inter-department coordination
and upgrading operational efficiency, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
Hou, a former deputy mayor of the southern port city of Kaohsiung
who has a doctoral degree in civil engineering and coastal
engineering from the University of Florida, will also oversee
operations of the MOEA's Bureau of Mines, Energy Commission and
Commission of National Corporations.
</P>
<P>
According to the MOEA sources, Hou will have to deal with a

WILL NEW LEGISLATIVE SESSION BE SAME OLD STORY?By S.C. ChangCNA Staff Reporter
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Sept.  11  (CNA)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With the new session of the sixth
Legislative Yuan set to open Tuesday, attention has focused on
whether lawmakers will repeat their "politics over policy" fighting
of the previous session and thereby increase the public's sense of
frustration as a host of important bills are awaiting deliberation.
</P>
<P>
For now, the ruling camp, which does not enjoy a majority in the
legislature, does not seem optimistic that a "new phase" of Taiwan
politics characterized by rational debate and professional law making
will emerge. The ruling party caucus leaders, however, are
acknowledging the need for communication and compromise with the
opposition Kuomintang (KMT) and People First Party (PFP) in order to
make some breakthroughs in the legislative agenda.
</P>
<P>
Only 46 bills were passed during the last legislative session, a
record low since the fourth Legislative Yuan, leaving unresolved such
critical bills as the special budgets for an arms procurement package
and flood control, the establishment of the National Communications
Commission (NCC) , direct transportation links across the Taiwan
Strait, and the restructuring of the Executive Yuan -- the
administrative branch of the government.
</P>
<P>
The political battle between the "pan-blue alliance" of the KMT,
FPF and New Party and the "pan-green camp" of the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) and Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU) has also
stalled screening of President Chen Shui-bian's Control Yuan member
nominations list, leaving the Control Yuan without members since
February this year.
</P>
<P>
Analysts say one of the main reasons for the legislature's
refusal even to screen the nominees' qualifications is PFP Chairman
James Soong's demand that President Chen apologize for alleging that
Soong had met with China's Taiwan Affairs Office Director Chen
Yun-lin in the United States early this year.
</P>
<P>
Many analysts have said that it is the Soong party's "scorched
earth" strategy -- of refusing even to put the key arms purchase bill
through the legislature's Procedure Committee -- that is straining
the nerves of the ruling and opposition lawmakers and testing their
ability to carry out their constitutional duties for the electorate.
</P>
<P>
Some analysts have predicted that Soong's party will not only
block major government bills from being put on the legislative
agenda, but will also make use of the two BOT scandals involving
Kaohisung Rapid Transit Corp. (KRTC) and Taiwan High Speed Rail Corp.
(THSRC) to launch a new offensive against the government.
</P>
<P>
A Cabinet member and Kaohsiung's acting mayor have resigned to
take responsibility for the KRTC incident triggered by a recent riot
by Thai workers in protest of maltreatment; and the THSRC's
announcement of postponing by a whole year the date of inaugurating
high-speed rail service has prompted cries demanding that someone
take responsibility for an estimated NT$66.7 billion loss incurred
from the delay.
</P>
<P>
DPP legislative caucus convener Chao Yung-ching accused Soong of
adopting an hard-line strategy to "hijack" both KMT Chairman Ma
Ying-jeou and national security. However, Soong's argument -- the
Chen Shui-bian government's referendum on arms purchases was defeated
last year, and the people's "direct opinion" on this issue cannot be
vetoed by the legislature's "indirect opinion" -- has put the DPP in
a straight jacket.
</P>
<P>
The KMT must cooperate with the PFP for another reason, according
to PFP legislative caucus deputy convener Sun Ta-chien: If the KMT
agrees to put the arms purchase bill through the Procedure Committee,
the PFP will counter with a move that will be fatal to the KMT. Sun
was referring to a DPP-proposed bill on political parties'
"ill-gotten" assets, which has also been blocked from appearing on
the legislative agenda because of KMT-PFP cooperation.
</P>
<P>
DPP Legislator Lee Wen-chung, a convener of the legislature's
National Defense Committee, said his party agrees that the arms bill
must be carefully examined and that all unnecessary spending must be
"taken out" to save money for taxpayers. However, he complained that
even though all the committee members have agreed in private to "work
together" to examine the arms bill item by item, this agreement
"disappears when the members face the media's cameras because of
partisan positions."
</P>
<P>
The legislature's handling of the arms bill is a key indicator of
the nation's determination to upgrade its defense capabilities in the
face of China's "non-peaceful" rise. The United States is watching
closely, and all the lawmakers are aware of this.
</P>
<P>
The KMT is also aware of this, but it is inclined to let the
legislature debate the bill. At the same time, it is now handicapped
by its consideration of the year-end city and county elections in
which the "pan-blue alliance" must work together, not to mention the
PFP's threat to work with the DPP on the party assets bill.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, inside the "pan-blue alliance, " the interactions
between Ma and Soong, and between Ma and Wang Jin-pyng, president of
the Legislative Yuan who was roundly defeated in the race for KMT
leadership, will be closely watched as these interactions are a good
indicator of how closely knit the alliance will remain.
</P>
<P>
For example, some in the DPP are depending on a possible
difference between Wang and Ma on whether to put the arms bill on the
legislative agenda for an "opportunity" to force the KMT into
agreeing to do so. Wang has openly advocated that the bill should be
deliberated on the legislative floor.
</P>
<P>
However, William C.T. Lai, secretary-general of the DPP
legislative caucus, has said he does not think it is practical for
the DPP to "try to drive a wedge" between Ma and Wang or between Ma
and Soong. Ko Chien-ming, executive director of the DPP Policy
Committee who has rich experience in dealing with the "pan-blue
alliance, " said it would be more feasible for the DPP to urge Wang
to act as the speaker of the nation's legislature, rather than as a
KMT or "pan-blue" member.
</P>
<P>
Ko said there seems no better alternatives for the DPP than
seeking to communicate and compromise with the "pan-blue alliance."
However, the compromise should not go as far as to "share power" with
the opposition, according to Lee Wen-chung, who envisions an
opposition demanding to form a "coalition government" with the DPP if
some Cabinet posts are ceded to the KMT or PFP. In such a scenario,
there would be infinite troubles, he added.
</P>
<P>
Still, given the nation's economic challenges and diplomatic
isolation, if Premier Frank Hsieh's "reconciliation and symbiosis"
slogan is to remain more than mere empty words, and if the DPP wants
to break through the legislative impasse and push through the major
bills in order to achieve its policy goals, there appears no better
strategy for the ruling camp to follow than to listen to its Policy
Committee head's advice for frank communication with the opposition.

TAIWAN WINS INTERNATIONAL SCHOOLS CYBERFAIR FOR 3RD STRAIGHT YEAR
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Sept. 11 (CNA)

<TEXT>
<P>
Taiwan won the 2005 International Schools
Cyberfair championship by garnering a total of nine platinum, 13
gold, 15 silver and 24 special awards, a Ministry of Education
official said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
It marked the third year in a row that Taiwan has won the event,
said Liu Chin-ho, a deputy director of the education ministry's
Computer Center.
</P>
<P>
The International Schools Cyberfair engages students in powerful
educational story-telling activities, which benefit students and
their communities.
</P>
<P>
According to Liu, the winners of Taiwan's 61 awards come from
schools in every region of the country, reflecting that the
government's efforts to reduce the so-called digital divide have
borne fruit and that the development of information technology
education in the country has been regionally balanced.
</P>
<P>
Among the award winners was the outlying island of Kinmen's Cho
Huan Elementary School with a student population of only 160. Despite
the school's distance from "big cities, " the students and teachers
won a gold for Taiwan with their Web site design featuring Kinmen's
forest industry dubbed "The Green Miracle."

PRESIDENT PITCHES FOR INTRAPARTY UNITY TO WIN YEAR-END ELECTIONS
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Chiayi, Taiwan, Sept. 11 (CNA)
(BY Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President Chen Shui-bian urged his
ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) Sunday to consolidate
intraparty unity and integration to ensure a victory in the year-end
"three-in-one" elections.
</P>
<P>
Chen made the appeal during a meeting with DPP politicians and
grassroots civic representatives in the southern city of Chiayi on a
range of issues, including the Dec. 3 elections for
mayors/magistrates, city/county councilors and township chiefs, as
well as the ongoing financial reforms.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the Taiwan Solidarity Union's (TSU's) decision to
nominate its own candidate to run for the Chiayi mayorship, Chen said
the DPP need not care too much about the TSU move and should instead
step up integration of various intraparty forces to ensure
re-election of incumbent Chiayi Mayor Chen Li-chen, a DPP
standard-bearer.
</P>
<P>
The TSU, which controls 12 seats in the Legislative Yuan, has
traditionally been a DPP ally as both parties advocate Taiwan's
separate identity. But relations between the two parties have soured
recently over the "three-in-one" elections issues. the TSU has
insisted on fielding its own candidates in several constituencies,
including Keelung and Chiayi.
</P>
<P>
Chen said he is convinced that the DPP would be able to retain
its control of Chiayi City so long as it can consolidate its ranks.
</P>
<P>
Touching on the ongoing second phase of financial reform, Chen
said the ultimate goal of the sweeping reform is to streamline local
financial institutions and enhance their operational efficiency and
global competitiveness.
</P>
<P>
According to the government's financial reform plan, the number
of the state-owned banks must be halved from 12 to six by the end of
this year and the number of financial holding companies must be
halved from the current 14 to seven by the end of next year.
Hopefully, Chen said, the merger and restructuring of local financial
institutions will achieve economies of scale and enhance their
competitive edges.
</P>
<P>
Through all these reforms, Chen said he is convinced that it will
become easier for local banks to compete in the global financial
service markets.

OFFICIAL WORRIED FEWER TAIWAN STUDENTS STUDYING ABROAD
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Sept.  11 (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The number of Taiwan students seeking
advanced studies abroad has been decreasing over the past 10 years,
according to the Ministry of Education, whose official fears that if
the trend continues, Taiwan will run short of manpower for
international competition.
</P>
<P>
Data provided by the Institute for International Education of the
United States show that during the 2001-2002 academic year, 28,930
Taiwan students were studying in the U.S., ranked fifth among all
foreign students. China ranked the second, with 63,211, next only to
India's 66,836.
</P>
<P>
India continued to top the rankings with more than 79,000
students in the U.S. in 2003-2004, followed by China with 61,000,
while Taiwan's ranking slipped to sixth, with 26,178, a decrease of
seven percent from the previous academic year.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Education said the U.S., United Kingdom, Canada,
Australia and Japan are the top five foreign countries accepting
Taiwan students, whose number has been declining in tandem with the
decrease in the U.S.
</P>
<P>
Professor Michael Porter of Harvard University has warned that if
China's training of advanced manpower approaches or even surpasses
that of Taiwan, which has been relying on its quality human resources
to maintain its competitive edge, then Taiwan will have a big trouble
for further development.
</P>
<P>
Chang Chin-sheng, director of the ministry's Bureau of
International Cultural and Educational Relations, said the quality of
foreign-trained professionals had contributed a great deal to
Taiwan's economic development. Taiwan's high-tech industry has
developed well because many U.S.-trained Taiwan students have
returned home to lay a solid foundation by devoting their expertise
in research and production, he said.
</P>
<P>
For the time being, Chang added, Taiwan still enjoys a
competitive edge over China in high-tech manpower and investment
environment, but for how long? "It will depend on our long-range
manpower training program," he said.
</P>
<P>
Several reasons explain why there have been fewer Taiwan students
seeking advanced studies overseas, Chang said, including Taiwan
universities setting up their own graduate schools, Taiwan's poor
economic performance over the past few years, higher tuition charged
by U.S. universities, and growing difficulties for foreign students
to get U.S. visas.
</P>
<P>
What worried Chang most was what he calls "the declining
enthusiasm of Taiwan's young people to seek new knowledge in advanced
countries, " a phenomenon that he claims will blunt Taiwan's
international competitiveness, leading to Taiwan's marginalization
even without China's boycott in all sectors of economy and different
spheres of life.
</P>
<P>
He said if the trend continues, fewer and fewer faculty members
in Taiwan's higher education institutes will have foreign degrees. He
called on the people to look squarely into the future and encourage
youngsters to further studies abroad so that Taiwan will be able to
compete internationally in the age of globalization.

<P>
Are young people confronted with
prevailing poverty? Academics and young employees said Sunday this is
quite true, and the government needs to do something to stop 20- and
30-somethings from being exploited in the job market.
</P>
<P>
At a seminar co-sponsored by the Alliance of Fairness and
Justice, Lin Chia-ho, executive director of Taiwan Labor and Social
Policy Research Society, said "flexible working conditions" and
unstable job market have caused stress for young employees.
</P>
<P>
Lin said some studies have shown that by 2050, the world will
become a 20-80 society in which only 20 percent of the population
will be able to boost productivity, and young people will account for
these 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
A woman delegate working in the advertisement industry said she
has to work more than 10 hours a day for a monthly pay of NT$23,000
to NT$25,000. Supposedly she can take some days off, but dares not
for fear of losing her job, and long-time stress has created some
health troubles for her.
</P>
<P>
Example like that prompted Lin to suggest that if the job market
trend cannot be changed, government leaders must design some
mechanism for young workers to survive, such as the social safety net
of some advanced countries where people enjoy a better quality of
life in spite of the same unstable job market.
</P>
<P>
He also called on the government to take care of the middle- and

MAC MUM ON SOONG'S PLAN TO TRAVEL VIA 'MINI 3 LINKS' ROUTE
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Sept. 11 (CNA)
(BY Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) would
not comment on opposition People First Party (PFP) Chairman James
Soong's plan to travel via the "mini three links" route across the
Taiwan Strait until after Soong unveils details of his plan, an
official said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
MAC Vice Chairman You Ying-lung made the remarks after PFP
Legislator Chang Hsieh-yao said earlier in the day that Soong would
not break any existing law or regulations if he returns to Taiwan via
the "mini three links" route after attending a cross-strait elite
forum in Shanghai in mid-September.
</P>
<P>
The "mini three links" route refers to direct shipping services
between the two Taiwan-held frontline islands of Kinmen/Matsu and two
port cities of Xiamen and Mawei in China's Fujian province. Direct
cross-strait air and shipping links have been suspended for decades,
but since January 2001, Taiwan has allowed direct trade, postal and
shipping links between Kinmen/Matsu and Xiamen/ Mawei, commonly known
as the "mini three links."
</P>
<P>
While the government still imposes certain conditions for those
who want to travel via the "mini three links" route, You said, the
government is willing to deal with certain applications on a
case-by-case basis under certain circumstances.
</P>
<P>
"The MAC will decide how to respond to Soong's plan after the PFP
unveils details of Soong's itinerary and travel purposes," You said.

TAIWAN LOOKS FORWARD TO BETTER TIES WITH JAPAN: MOFA
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Sept.  11 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Republic of China looks forward to
increasingly reinforced ties with Japan after Japanese Prime Minister
Junichiro Koizumi won a mandate to push ahead with his reform program
in Sunday's lower house elections, an official said.
</P>
<P>
Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesman Michel Lu made the remarks
after Koizumi said late Sunday night that it appeared his Liberal
Democratic Party (LDP) had won a lower house majority. The leader of
the main opposition Democratic Party conceded defeat later.
</P>
<P>
Lu said Japan is one of Taiwan's most important trade partners
and democratic allies.
</P>
<P>
"We are concerned about the results of the Japanese parliamentary
elections. For Taiwan, it is hoped that the Koizumi government will
continue working for peace and stability in the West Pacific region,
particularly further boosting friendly ties with Taiwan on the
current basis, " Lu said.
</P>
<P>
Public broadcaster NHK and several commercial networks said exit
polls indicated the Liberal Democrats stood to win as many as 309 of
the powerful lower house's 480 seats, 60 more than it held before
Koizumi dissolved it. TBS, another network, said the LDP would win
307 seats.
</P>
<P>
The main opposition party, the Democrats, was expected to win 104
seats, a devastating plunge from its previous standing of 175 seats,
NHK said.
</P>
<P>
An official vote count won't be released until Monday morning.
</P>
<P>
Lu said the foreign ministry will ask the ROC's representative
office in Tokyo to convey felicitations from President Chen
Shui-bian, Premier Frank Hsieh and Minister of Foreign Affairs Tan
Sun Chen to Japanese authorities after the final electoral outcome is
announced.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Koh Se-kai, the ROC representative to Japan, said he
believes that Taiwan-Japan relations will continue to grow steadily
after the LDP won a landslide victory in the lower house election
Sunday. The victory has granted Koizumi overwhelming public approval
for his plan to privatize Japan's postal service.

INTER-PARTY WRANGLING UNDERMINING NATIONAL DEFENSE DEVELOPMENT: CHEN
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Sept. 12 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President Chen Shui-bian said Monday that
irrational inter-party wrangling poses the greatest challenge to the
development of the nation's defenses, referring mainly to the
long-stalled arms procurement bill in the legislature.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a joint ceremony held at National Defense University
to mark the beginning of the new academic year for several military
institutes, Chen blamed the opposition parties for their irrational
boycott of and procrastination in endorsing plans aimed at upgrading
and modernizing the military's capabilities.
</P>
<P>
The opposition's obstruction has seriously undermined the
upgrading of the armed forces' combat preparedness and Taiwan's
deterrence and defense strategies, Chen claimed.
</P>
<P>
Chen stressed that the procurement of the three weaponry items
that the United States has offered to sell to Taiwan -- namely eight
diesel-electric submarines, six Patriot PAC III anti-missile
batteries and a squadron of 12 P-3C anti-submarine aircraft -- was
decided upon prior to his being elected president in 2000.
</P>
<P>
The president asked: "How can Taiwan require its allies come to
its rescue in a crisis when the country itself remains reluctant to
make efforts to beef up its own defensive capabilities?"
</P>
<P>
Chen urged the legislature to act with a sense of responsibility
and review and pass the arms procurement bill as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
He said that if the opposition parties harbor different opinions
about the costs or the items of the procurement plan, these
differences can be tackled through debate in the Legislative Yuan,
adding that the administration will also actively seek, via
negotiations, to increase the annual budget for military spending on
a yearly basis and gradually return the annual national defense
budget to a level equivalent to 3 percent of the country's gross
national product (GNP).

NUMBER OF SOUTHEAST ASIAN PROSTITUTES IN TAIWAN ON THE RISE: NPA
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Sept. 12 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The number of prostitutes from Southeast
Asian countries is on the rise in Taiwan, while the number from China
is on the decline as a result of the government's tighter controls,
National Police Administration (NPA) officials reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
NPA officials quoted tallies compiled by the top police office as
indicating that 140 foreign nationals were apprehended in the first
six months of this year for engaging in the illegal sex trade in
Taiwan, up 83 from the year earlier level. Of the 140 foreigners
nabbed, Vietnamese, Cambodians and Indonesians topped the list, with
their numbers totaling 56, 25 and 24, respectively.
</P>
<P>
According to NPA statistics, 41 foreign women were arrested for
prostitution in Taiwan in 2002, and 45 were nabbed in 2003. The
figure shot up to 152 in 2004.
</P>
<P>
Between Jan. 1, 2002 and June 30, 2005, 156 Vietnamese women were
arrested for prostitution in Taiwan, while 81 Thai women, 51
Indonesian women and 41 women from Cambodia were nabbed during the
same period, according to the NPA tallies.
</P>
<P>
By comparison, NPA officials said, the number of women from
mainland China, Hong Kong or Macau arrested in Taiwan for
prostitution in the first six months of this year totaled 667,
representing a decline of 500, or 43 percent, from last year's figure
for the same period.
</P>
<P>
NPA officials attributed the significant decline mainly to a
series of "deterrent" measures taken by the government, including
compulsory interviews upon arrival at Taiwan airports for this group
of mainland citizens.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, only 36 mainland Chinese women who sneaked into Taiwan
with the help of "snakehead" human trafficking rings were nabbed in
the first six months of this year, down 206, or 85 percent, from the
level for the same period a year earlier, the officials said.

HOMECOMING PASSENGERS WARNED AGAINST BRINGING IN FRUIT, MEAT
</HEADLINE>

(By Deborah Kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Council of Agriculture (COA) Monday
warned overseas Taiwan citizens returning home for the upcoming
Mid-Autumn Festival holiday against attempting to bring in food and
fruit products from abroad, to help keep epidemic diseases at bay.
</P>
<P>
Officials from the COA Bureau of Animal and Plant Inspection and
Quarantine (BAPIQ) instructed homecoming passengers not to bring with
them products such as moon cakes containing meat or fresh fruit
originating from China or Southeast Asian countries where foot and
mouth disease, avian flu, rabies and swine streptococcus are declared
epidemic diseases.
</P>
<P>
Allowing imports of unsafe food and fruit products from these
areas unchecked could leave Taiwan's agricultural and livestock
industries compromised and people's health impaired, BAPIQ officials
stressed.
</P>
<P>
The officials noted that the COA has arranged for sniffer dogs to
be on duty at airports and seaports to beef up searches of inbound
passengers and their luggage. The dogs are capable of sniffing out
dozens of goods, including mangoes, apples, pears, oranges, garlic,
beef, pork, duck and chicken.
</P>
<P>
Any food and fruit products discovered will be destroyed or
ordered to be shipped back to point of origin, the officials added.

DPP FACTION WANTS PRESIDENT TO DISSOLVE LEGISLATURE
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Sept.  12 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Legislators of the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) urged main opposition Kuomintang (KMT)
Chairman Ma Ying-jeou Monday to support constitutional amendments so
that the president can dissolve the Legislative Yuan.
</P>
<P>
The lawmakers of the Justice Alliance, a major DPP faction, was
responding to recent remarks by Ma in which he said that if the
government is serious about pushing for a second phase of
constitutional reforms, it should return the legislature's power to
exercise the "right of consent" on the president's nomination of the
premier, a power that was taken away when the Constitution was
amended during former President Lee Teng-hui's tenure.
</P>
<P>
Gao Jyh-peng, secretary-general of the Justice Alliance, called a
press conference Monday to say that if the legislature's right of
consent on the premier is reinstated, the legislature will be
all-powerful and turn the nation's government into a parliamentary
system rather than the existing system that tilts more
toward presidential one.
</P>
<P>
He noted that both President Chen Shui-bian and Premier Frank
hsieh want to dissolve the legislature, hoping to learn from the
example of Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi, who dissolved
the Japanese parliament and called a new election to seek a new
mandate for reforms.

</P>
<P>
Hsieh recently challenged the opposition parties, which enjoy a
slim majority in the 225-seat legislature and have refused to pass an
NT$80 billion special budget bill for flood control, to topple his
Cabinet with a motion of no-confidence. Such a legislative move would
then allow President Chen to dissolve the opposition-controlled
legislature and pave the way for new legislative elections.
</P>
<P>
Legislator Chuang Suo-hang said Ma should support the second
phase of reforms so as to resolve the current stalemated legislature,
referring to several major bills that are bogged down due to the
continued boycotting of the opposition parties.
</P>
<P>
Legislator Huang Wei-cher said the opposition's refusal to
confirm the Control Yuan members nominated by President Chen has
resulted in a constitutional crisis and that if the legislative right
to consent of the premier is reinstated, then the nation could come
to a complete stop.
</P>
<P>
Legislator Jao Yung-ching said a constitutional amendment to
allow the president to take the initiative to dissolve the
legislature will help solve the political stalemate and stop the
legislature from abusing its power.
</P>
<P>
Under the existing Constitution, after the Legislative Yuan
initiates a no-confidence motion to topple the Executive Yuan, the 
premier must resign within 10 days or ask the president to dissolve
the legislature.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, a KMT caucus whip in the legislature said
Taiwan has neither a presidential system nor a parliamentary one and
that it is meaningless to talk about toppling the Cabinet.
</P>
<P>
KMT Legislator Cho Po-yuan claimed that under the current
governing system, the president has "rights but no
responsibilities" while the premier has "no power and only 
responsibilities" and that the premier is only the "executive
director" of the president's policy.
</P>
<P>
If the ruling party wants a new mandate from the public by
electing a new legislature, Cho said President Chen himself should
resign along with his entire Cabinet to pave the way for simultaneous
elections of the president and the legislature.

<TEXT>
<P>
The Ministry of Education (MOE) has been
working with the National Youth Commission (NYC) to carry out a
"hand-in-hand" project to help both college/university students in
financial straits and remote middle schools with fewer educational
resources than their urban counterparts.
</P>
<P>
The plan is scheduled to be put into practice on a trial basis
from Sept. 19-Dec. 31. Through the NYC's Web site for students
looking for part-time work, the MOE plans to recruit 500 college or
university students from low-income families to give tutorial lessons
in middle schools around the island. Low income is defined as income
lower than NT$1.14 million (US$34,900) per year, MOE officials said
Monday.
</P>
<P>
For the time being, over 1,100 college students have applied for
the job, while more than 198 middle schools have submitted demands
for after-school tutors to help students with weak academic
performance.
</P>
<P>
Each tutor will be paid NT$300 an hour by the MOE, with an
additional travel subsidy of between NT$1,000 to NT$3,000, according
to ministry officials.
</P>
<P>
With the tutorial project, the MOE hopes that it can not only
help underprivileged students out of financial straits but also help
reduce the wide margin between urban and rural middle school students
in the academic performance, the officials said.

'PAN BLUE' MEMBERS ADVOCATE GLOBAL CHINESE UNION
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Washington, Sept. 11 (CNA)
(By Wennie Chi &amp; Deborah Kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two key members of Taiwan's opposition
"pan blue alliance" are in Washington to promote a Global Union of
Chinese Commonwealth (GUCC), an idea that seeks consolidation of all
Chinese people around the world and makes peace across the Taiwan
Strait its top guiding principle.
</P>
<P>
Yok Mu-ming, chairman of the tiny New Party -- the smallest of
the three political parties that make up the opposition "pan blue
alliance" -- and Joanna Lei, a New Party consultant and a legislator
of the Kuomintang -- the largest party in the alliance -- arrived in
Washington Sunday to tout the GUCC concept in th U.S.
capital.
</P>
<P>
Yok noted that he mentioned the GUCC idea during a meeting with
Chinese President Hu Jintao when he visited Beijing in July and said
he will raise the topic during a discussion with scholars from the
Brookings Institution Monday. He did not elaborate on how or even
whether Hu responded to his GUCC advocacy.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Lei, who also hosts a television talk show focusing on
major political and economic issues in Taiwan, said that seeking
cross-strait peace is the top guiding principle of the GUCC and that
unification is only one of the options.
</P>
<P>
On the question of whether the GUCC might appear naive or
unrealistic at a time when China still refuses to renounce the use of
force against Taiwan should the nation edge toward formal
independence, particularly after Beijing passed its Anti-Secession
Law in March targeting Taiwan, Lei said that pursuing cross-strait
peace is the common wish of all Taiwan people and that the New
Party-initiated GUCC is an idea with peace and reconciliation as its
prerequisite.
</P>
<P>
Under this concept, Lei said, the New Party expects Beijing to
show sincere goodwill toward Taiwan to help expedite the arrival of
peace across the Taiwan Strait.

CABINET PROBE INTO RIOT BY THAI LABORERS TO BE FINALIZED
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei, Sept. 12 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Minister-without-Portfolio Hsu Chih-hsiung
will present the results of an investigation into a recent riot by
Thai laborers to Premier Frank Hsieh Tuesday, Cabinet sources said
Monday.
</P>
<P>
As the Legislative Yuan will open a new session Tuesday,
political observers originally predicted that the Cabinet would
unveil its report Monday on the Aug. 21 riot by Thai laborers working
for a mass rapid transit system in the southern port city of
Kaohsiung.
</P>
<P>
But Hsu's office said the report would not be referred to Hsieh
Monday because of some procedural issues.
</P>
<P>
Investigations by Hsu's team show that the riot was mainly
related to labor management flaws involving Kaohsiung Rapid Transit
Co. (KRTC) and Huapan Administrative Consultant Co., the Cabinet
sources said.
</P>
<P>
As to the political responsibility for the fiasco, the sources
said both central and local governments have some "responsibility of
supervision."
</P>
<P>
According to the report, the sources said, the existing foreign
laborer management system and supervisory operations require a
comprehensive review and improvements.
</P>
<P>
Both Council of Labor Affairs Chairwoman Chen Chu and acting
Kaohsiung Mayor Chen Chi-mai have tendered their resignations to
shoulder political responsibility for the riot.
</P>
<P>
Hsieh has said on many occasions that even though both officials
have some "accountability of supervision, " the extent of their
responsibilities do not merit their resignations.

The Aug. 21 riot began when several Thai workers returned to
their dormitory after a day off and were barred from bringing in
alcohol and cigarettes, a move that was the final straw in a long
list of grievances. The workers burned cars and battled police with
stones and slingshots. The laborers, who are building Kaohsiung's MRT
system, complained about rigorous management rules and poor living
conditions.

PREMIER WANTS SIMULTANEOUS REVIEW OF NCC BILL, CABINET ORGANIC LAW
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
(By Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Taipei, Sept. 12 (The) Premier Frank Hsieh expressed hopes Monday
that the Legislative Yuan will review simultaneously a proposed
amendment to the Executive Yuan Organic Law and a proposed National
Communications Commission (NCC) Organic Law.
</P>
<P>
In a meeting with Legislative Speaker Wang Jin-pyng in which Wang
expressed reservations about linking the two bills, Hsieh noted that
if the NCC Organic Law is passed but the proposed amendment to the
Executive Yuan Organic Law is not, then there will be a "conflict of
legal basis" because the amendment package is a prerequisite for the
creation of an NCC.
</P>
<P>
But Wang claimed that the proposed NCC Organic Law can be passed
first and that it will be "no problem" to review quickly the proposed
amendment to the Executive Yuan Organic Law.
</P>
<P>
The opposition "pan-blue alliance" of the Kuomintang and the
People First Party has listed the proposed NCC organic law as
priority bills in the new legislative session, saying that it will
vote on the issue Sept. 25 after a four-month waiting period for
inter-party consultation expires without consensus having been
reached.
</P>
<P>
At issue is the opposition's stance that the members of the NCC
should be named in proportion to the ratio of legislative seats held
by each political party, an idea to which Hsieh is opposed. The
"pan-blue alliance" controls a thin majority in the 225-seat
legislature.
</P>
<P>
The premier also expressed hope that Wang will coordinate on such
priority bills on an arms procurement package and a flood-control
project, as well as the confirmation of Control Yuan members
nominated by President Chen Shui-bian.
</P>
<P>
Wang said that he will "do what he can" concerning the arms
procurement package, adding that although the Executive Yuan has
shown goodwill in listing one of the three big-ticket items in the
package -- six Patriot PAC III anti-missile batteries -- on the
regular annual budget, the two other items -- eight
diesel-electric anti-missile submarines and a squadron of 12 P-3C
anti-submarine aircraft -- listed under "special budget" will need
"further coordination."
</P>
<P>
The opposition parties will also take national defense, finance
and cross-strait relations into their overall considerations, Wang
said.
</P>
<P>
On the stalled confirmation of Control Yuan members nominated by
Chen, Wang expressed the hope that the president will respect the
legislature's wish to name a new list and communicate with the
lawmakers on the issue.
</P>
<P>
On the flood-control project, Wang conveyed the "pan-blue
alliance" stance that it will rigorously screen the project so as to
use the taxpayers' money wisely.
</P>
<P>
The premier also asked the Legislative Yuan to review the budget
of the central government quickly so as not to affect economic
development and delay a calculation of the nation's economic growth
rate.

DOH TO SET MIDWIFERY GUIDELINES FOR WATER-BIRTHS FOLLOWING DEATH
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Sept.  12 (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Department of Health said Monday it
will set guidelines for midwives helping women give birth in water.
</P>
<P>
The DOH made the decision in the wake of a reported death of a
baby after its mother tried to give birth in water at a midwife
clinic in Hsinchuang, Taipei County.
</P>
<P>
The clinic's owner, Tsai Sha-ning, denied the report.
</P>
<P>
In 1999, Tsai assisted a Miss Lai, who had lived in France, in
giving birth to a child in water, an alternative method of childbirth
in the developed world. Ever since, Tsai has helped nearly 100 women
to do so, five of whose babies have died in the process.
</P>
<P>
Hsu Chen-chieh, president of the Taiwan Society of Perinatology,
said infant mortality is about 0.2 percent in normal childbirth and
that the 5 percent rate for water-born infants apparently is too
high.
</P>
<P>
He said it is not the procedure that is to blame, but rather the
clinic's ability to handle such incidents as contamination, lack of
oxygen and suffocation.
</P>
<P>
Wang Chung-lang, a gynecologist-turned-DOH official, said that
throughout Taiwan, there are only 25 registered midwife clinics that
help a little over 500 childbirths, mostly in remote areas.
</P>
<P>
Wang said the number of water births in Taiwan is too small to
determine the mortality. However, to avoid medical disputes, the DOH
will adopt three principles: To regularly check the qualifications of
midwives and update their knowledge and skills; to ensure that
pregnant women are informed of the risks involved in giving birth in
water in Taiwan; and to set up guidelines on the standard operating
procedure that can be used as evidence to determine if a midwife is
professionally responsible for any mishap.
</P>
<P>
Hsu said in some countries where midwifery is common, clinics are
integrated into the national health care system in such a way that
whenever an emergency occurs, patients can be referred to a hospital
immediately.
</P>
<P>
He noted that with the hospital as a back up, infant mortality
can be greatly reduced in water-births.

EXPECT DPP MUD-SLINGING IN YEAR-END ELECTIONS: KMT OFFICIAL
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Sept. 12 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Expect the ruling Democratic Progressive
Party (DPP) to come out slinging mud during campaigning for the
year-end local elections, Chan Chun-poh, secretary-general of the
opposition Kuomintang (KMT) said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Chan told party lawmakers in a meeting that the DPP is expected
to go all out to win the elections for county and city chiefs, county
and city councilors, and township chiefs, and is almost certain to
try to tarnish the opposition's image by presenting their performance
in the Legislative Yuan in the worst light possible.
</P>
<P>
The opposition KMT and People First Party, which control a slim
majority between them in the legislature, often reject the DPP
administration's bills, to the frustration of the ruling party.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, Chan said, among the KMT candidates for county and
city chiefs, six are legislators and six are ex-lawmakers. Their DPP
rivals are sure to make their voting records in the Legislative Yuan
issues in the campaign.
</P>
<P>
Legislative Yuan President Wang Jin-pyng, a member of the KMT,
also cautioned party lawmakers to think carefully about how to react
to the government's various key bills in the forthcoming session.
These include flood-control, arms purchase, a national communications
committee bill, the revision of the Organic Law for the Executive
Yuan, and the president's nominees to fill the paralyzed Control
Yuan.
</P>
<P>
Wang said one misstep with these bills could provide the DPP
ammunition against the KMT in the year-end elections and compromise
the party's chance for victory.

TAIWAN-JAPAN RELATIONS EXPECTED TO GROW AFTER KOIZUMI'S LANDSLIDE WIN
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Sept. 12 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Minister of Foreign Affairs Tan Sun Chen
said Monday that the Japanese administration of Junichiro Koizumi is
friendly to Taiwan and bilateral relations are expected to grow
steadily, after the prime minister won an overwhelming victory in
Sunday's lower house elections.
</P>
<P>
Koizumi's Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) won an absolute majority
of 296 seats in the lower house for the first time in 15 years. The
LDP has ruled Japan for most of the past 50 years.
</P>
<P>
Chen said, "Koizumi has personal charisma, and he is brave enough
to say what he wants to say. It is obvious that Japanese voters like
this kind of leader. "
</P>
<P>
The ministry feels that Koizumi's administration will continue
good relations with Taiwan, even though some of the Dietmen who were
part of a parliamentary group who have long supported Taiwan were
defeated because of their opposition to postal reform, Koizumi's key
reform plan.
</P>
<P>
Chen cited as an example of Japan's intent its inclusion of the
peaceful resolution of the Taiwan issue as a common strategic
objective with the United States for the first time in the security
consultative committee meeting in late February.
</P>
<P>
Japan also supports Taiwan's bid to become an observer in the
World Health Organization and has waived visa requirements for Taiwan
tourists, indicating that Taiwan-Japan relations are growing
steadily, Chen added.

Independent Legislator Li Ao is scheduled
to leave for Beijing Sept. 19 for a 12-day "cultural journey."
</P>
<P>
Li is expected to speak at three noted universities -- Peking
University, Tsinghua University and Fudan University and attend
seminars.
</P>
<P>
Li, also a prolific writer, attended a teleconference between
Taipei, Beijing and Hong Kong Monday. He was accompanied by Liu
Changle, chairman and CEO of Phoenix TV, who has helped arrange Li's
trip to China.
</P>
<P>
Li, 70, said that he has lived in Taiwan for 56 consecutive years
without ever making an overseas trip. Although he is going to visit
China, it is not an "overseas visit, " because "the mainland is part
of China, and Taiwan is also part of China."
</P>
<P>
Li, who is from Jilin province in northeastern China, said
"Taiwan is also my hometown, " and it is not a homecoming or a
revisitation, and he feels no homesickness.
</P>
<P>
Noting that Peking University rolled out the red carpet for
former U.S. President Bill Clinton and former opposition Kuomintang
Chairman Lien Chan when they visited the university, Li said the
school "can spare the trouble" this time, because he is not going in
his capacity as a guest, vowing, however, to give a more brilliant
speech than the other two.

According to an earlier report, the itinerary of Li's visit to

LEGISLATURE'S OK OF PREMIER WOULD NECESSITATE POWER BALANCE: CHEN

<TEXT>
<P>
President Chen Shui-bian said Monday if
the legislature were to be given back its right of consent on the
premier's appointment, the president would also have to be given the
right to dissolve the legislature.
</P>
<P>
Chen made his comments while meeting a group of French members of
the National Assembly at the Presidential Office.
</P>
<P>
The comment was a response to Kuomintang Chairman Ma Ying-jeou's
suggestion that the Legislative Yuan's power to veto the presidential
appointment of the premier should be reinstated if a new round of
constitutional amendments is to be pursued.
</P>
<P>
Ma reportedly made his remarks when meeting with Legislative Yuan
President Wang Jin-pyng. However, Ma also said there is absolutely no
need at present to push for revising the nation's basic law.
</P>
<P>
Chen said under the ROC Constitution, the president does not have
the automatic right to disband the legislature; nor does the
legislature have the right to veto the president's appointment of the
premier.
</P>
<P>
Ma's proposal is aimed at making the president appoint someone
who would be supported by the majority in the legislature, according
to the president.
</P>
<P>
Ma and many like him haven't thought through how the French style
of "dual heads of government " might be applied to Taiwan, but were
that to come to pass, the president should have the power to dissolve
the legislature when he sees fit, Chen said.
</P>
<P>
If the Constitution is to be amended for the legislature to enjoy
the power to veto a presidential appointment, it should be done in a
comprehensive and well-rounded package, not just for the interest of
a certain party, Chen said.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan has tried to frame France's "dual heads of government"
system into Taiwan's Constitution, Chen said, but the attempt was not
successful, and there have been constitutional problems.

PRESIDENT URGES FRANCE TO SUPPORT TAIWAN'S U.N. BID
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Sept.  12 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President Chen Shui-bian said Monday he
earnestly hopes that France can help with Taiwan's bid to join the
United Nations or at least refrain from publicly opposing it.
</P>
<P>
Chen made the appeal while meeting with a delegation from the
French National Assembly, which is currently on a visit in Taipei.
His call came on the eve of the opening of the annual U.N. General
Assembly plenary session in New York.
</P>
<P>
Of the 190-plus countries in today's world, Taiwan is the only
one with no representation in the U.N. This unfair situation dates
back to 1971 when the U.N. Resolution No. 2758 gave the "China" seat
to the People's Republic of China (PRC) at Taiwan's expense.
</P>
<P>
Hopefully, Chen said, France can pay attention to and show
concern for the 23 million Taiwan people's lack of representation in
the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
"We look forward to your country's assistance to our U.N. bid, "
Chen told his guests. If France cannot extend a helping hand in this
regard, Chen said, it should at least refrain from explicitly
speaking against Taiwan's cause.
</P>
<P>
France maintains formal diplomatic ties with China and voiced
opposition to Taiwan's U.N. bid during previous U.N. General
Committee debates.
</P>
<P>
Chen recalled that the political ideals of freedom and
equality as advocated in the French Revolution have had a far-reaching
impact on many countries around the world, including Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Noting that China's Anti-Secession Law codifies the use of
non-peaceful means to resolve its disputes with Taiwan, Chen said
such a move is in stark violation of the spirit of the French
Revolution.
</P>
<P>
Against this backdrop, Chen said he wonders why French President
Jacques Chirac pushed the European Union to lift its ban on arms
sales to China.
</P>
<P>
The E.U. imposed the arms ban after the 1989 Tiananmen Massacre
in which Chinese troops brutally crushed pro-democracy demonstrators.
Over the past 16 years, Chen said, China has not made any progress in
human rights protection.
</P>
<P>
"The reasons for the E.U. arms ban have not disappeared. If the
E.U. were to lift the ban lightly, it seems to me that the E.U. would
be encouraging an undemocratic and belligerent China to use
E.U.-provided weapons to attack democratic and peace-loving Taiwan, "
Chen said.
</P>
<P>
Over the past decade, Chen said Taiwan-French trade, cultural and
technological exchanges have become ever closer. Two-way trade
reached 3.9 billion euros last year. Chen said he hopes bilateral
trade and cooperation in various fields can continue to grow in the
years ahead.

TAIWAN WANTS TO TEST WHO FOR IHR APPLICABILITY

<TEXT>
<P>
Minister of Foreign Affairs Tan Sun Chen
asked Taiwan's allies Monday to "test" if the World Health
Organization's International Health Regulations (IHR) are applicable
to Taiwan when it comes to joint efforts in fighting avian flu.
</P>
<P>
Chen said the bird flu crisis provides the world community a good
opportunity to "test" if China will accept the IHR, which was
adopted by the WHO in May so that all countries, regions and
organizations can work together for the improvement of health
conditions for all mankind.
</P>
<P>
The flu's H5N1 virus has hit such Asian countries as Vietnam,
Thailand, Kampuchea and Indonesia, causing a 70 percent death rate
among those infected.
</P>
<P>
Chen was joined by Department of Health (DOH) and Council of
Agriculture (COA) officials in a briefing of foreign envoys on
Taiwan's preparation for a possible avian flu outbreak.
</P>
<P>
Chen said that in a report to Pacific Economic Cooperation
Council (PECC) , WHO's West Pacific Office has stated that
international cooperation would be "the most critical factor" in
every step of pushing a contingency plan against an avian flu
epidemic.
</P>
<P>
Yet this office has rejected Taiwan's requests for other
countries' contingency plans, the minister accused, expressing regret
and disgruntlement over the WHO office claiming that it could not
have any contact with Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
He asked foreign officials based in Taiwan to urge their home
governments to help Taiwan participate in the global mechanism of
preventing avian flu epidemics and enter into cooperation with
the WHO.
</P>
<P>
DOH Minister Hou Sheng-mao said Taiwan has adopted a three-point
strategy and a four-line defense, and has been staging exercises
accordingly, in preparation for a possible attack of avian flu.
</P>
<P>
The three-point strategy involves measures to stop infections,
stockpiling anti-flu medicines, and developing and producing new
vaccines.
</P>
<P>
The four-line defense includes stopping the epidemic offshore,
quarantine at the borders, preventive measures in communities, and
strengthening the health care system, according to Hou.

FM ADMITS HITCH IN TALKS FOR RELEASE OF TAIWAN FISHERMEN IN SOMALIA
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  Sept. 12 (CNA)

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Foreign Minister Tan Sun Chen said Monday
his ministry is doing its utmost to free three Taiwan fishing boats
and their crew hijacked in Somalia, but he has no idea how long it
will take.
</P>
<P>
The 48 crew of the three boats, held by Somalian pirates in the
southern Somalian port of Kismayo since Aug. 16, are safe for now,
but the talks on their release have been more complicated than
expected, the minister said.
</P>
<P>
"We hope they will be released soon, but it seems the whole thing
is not so simple; the situation in Somalia is quite complicated. We
would advise local fishermen to steer clear of that country because
even a United Nations' vessel could be hijacked there," Chen said.
</P>
<P>
Although only the skippers of the three boats are Taiwanese, the
others crew are fishery workers from Vietnam, the Philippines, and
Indonesia, but the minister said his ministry is no less aggressive
in its efforts to win their release.
</P>
<P>
The pirates originally demanded a ransom of US$500,000 for each
of the vessels and their crew, but slashed it to US$50,000 in
government-brokered negotiations Sept. 6.
</P>
<P>
Because of the chaos in Somalia, the Taiwan families of the
skippers are not certain how and to whom should the ransom be paid
and whether the crew will be released then.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan fishermen began catching fish in waters near Kismayo in
1988 after entering into an agreement with the Somalia warlord who
then controlled Kismayo. This is the first time Taiwan vessels have
been hijacked by pirates who are rife along the Somalian
coastline.

PREMIER APPROVES RESIGNATIONS OF CLA CHIEF, ACTING KAOHSIUNG MAYOR
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,   Sept.  12  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Premier Frank Hsieh approved the
resignations of two senior officials Monday over the Aug. 21 riot by
Thai laborers working for a mass rapid transit (MRT) system in the
southern port city of Kaohsiung.
</P>
<P>
Cabinet spokesman Cho Jung-tai said Hsieh had tried hard but
failed to persuade the two officials -- Council of Labor Affairs
(CLA) Chairwoman Chen Chu and acting Kaohsiung Mayor Chen Chi-mai --
to remain in the administrative team.
</P>
<P>
"The premier made last-ditch efforts to persuade both Chens to
remain in their posts or at least to transfer to serve at other
government positions. However, both insisted on stepping down to
shoulder the responsibility for the incident," Cho said.
</P>
<P>
As both Chens will leave Hsieh's administrative team, Cho said,
the premier will recruit suitable replacements as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
To ensure smooth Cabinet operations, Cho said, no other personnel
reshuffle will be made for the time being. Cho's remarks were seen
as a denial of media speculation that Interior Minister Su Jia-chyuan
may succeed Chen Chi-mai as acting Kaohsiung mayor.
</P>
<P>
Quoting a yet-to-be-released investigative report by
Minister-without-Portfolio Hsu Chih-hsiung, Cho said even though both
the CLA and the Kaohsiung City Government should shoulder some
"accountability of supervision" regarding the Aug. 21 riot, the
extent of their responsibilities do not merit the resignations of
their top officials.
</P>
<P>
However, Chen Chu, a human rights activist who was jailed for
many years during Taiwan's martial-law era for her pro-democracy
stance, said the riot has tarnished her personal image and that she
would leave politics for a certain period of time for reflection.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Chen Chi-mai said the incident and ensuing speculation
about his father's role in Thai laborers employment have disheartened
him.
</P>
<P>
The Aug. 21 riot began when several Thai workers returned to
their dormitory after a day off and were barred from bringing in
alcohol and cigarettes, a move that was the final straw in a long
list of grievances. The workers burned cars and battled police with
stones and slingshots. The laborers, who are building Kaohsiung's MRT
system, complained about rigorous management rules and poor living
conditions.

ROC TO ADOPT 'PARALLEL RELATIONSHIP POLICY' IN RELATIONS WITH FRANCE
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Paris, Sept. 12 (CNA)
(By Y.S. Lo and P.C. Tang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Republic of China's top envoy in France
said Monday that Taiwan will follow a "policy of parallel
relationship" in developing its relations with France.
</P>
<P>
Yang Tzu-pao, who assumed his new post as Taiwan's representative
to France on Sept. 5, made the remarks in an interview with the
Central News Agency.
</P>
<P>
Claiming that Taiwan welcomes France to promote its relations
with China, the envoy said that the French government should also
know that developing its relations with Taiwan will not be harmful to
its relations with China.
</P>
<P>
"We do not oppose France developing various relations with China.
Basically, we welcome France to help China to become a responsible
power in the world, " he said.
</P>
<P>
The envoy also said that Taiwan-France relations should not only
be based on national interests but should also include moral
considerations.
</P>
<P>
"We would like to make publicly known that we will adopt a
'policy of parallel relationship.' We also hope that France will
understand that the development of its relationship with Taiwan will
not affect the progress of its relations with China," Yang said.
</P>
<P>
Pointing out that Beijing may refuse to accept the concept of
"parallel relationship" and may continue to try to obstruct Taiwan's
attempts to develop its relations with France, Yang urged the French
authorities to deal with any "childish requests" by Beijing regarding
Taiwan with a "mature attitude."
</P>
<P>
The representative further said that his main task now is to
upgrade Taiwan's image in France, stressing that he will work to help
the French people obtain a better understanding of Taiwan's current
situation as well as its cultural, economic and technological
achievements.
</P>
<P>
Pointing out that substantive relations between Taiwan and France
have developed well, the envoy noted that visits by Taiwan and French
officials to each other's countries have been more frequent than
between Taiwan officials and officals from any other country in
Europe.
</P>
<P>
He also noted that Taiwan-France relations have entered a
delicate stage as the "China fever" in France has subsided and Paris
is currently reviewing how to balance its interactions with China,
adding that under these circumstances, there is definitely room for
Taiwan to develop its relations with France.

APPOINTMENT UNRELATED TO 2006 ELECTION: NEW ACTING KAOHSIUNG MAYOR
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei, Sept. 13 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Yeh Chu-lan, a senior advisor to President
Chen Shui-bian, said Tuesday that it is her responsibility to take up
the post of acting Kaohsiung mayor and that her appointment has
nothing to do with considerations about the 2006 mayoral election in
the southern port city.
</P>
<P>
Yeh made the remarks after she was named by the Executive Yuan to
the position following the resignation of Chen Chi-mai, who stepped
down to take responsibility for the Aug. 21 riot by Thai laborers
working on the construction of the mass rapid transit system in
Kaohsiung.
</P>
<P>
Yeh vowed to continue the construction project as planned so that
residents will be even prouder of their city, saying that the MRT
system must be completed as soon as possible and that preparations
for the 2009 World Games in the port city will be carried out
relentlessly.
</P>
<P>
Yeh, 56, is a legislator-turned-politician who has served in
the posts of transportation and communications minister, Council for
Hakka Affairs chairman, and vice premier.
</P>
<P>
Saying that she is no stranger to major urban construction
projects, Yeh vowed to work with the Kaohsiung city administrative
team to serve the people. The team will not undergo any major
personnel changes out of considerations of stability, she added.
</P>
<P>
Construction should not stop for even a single day, and reforms
must not stall because of personnel changes, Yeh quoted Premier Frank
Hsieh as saying to her Monday night.
</P>
<P>
Yeh said that her appointment has nothing to do with the 2006
mayoral election. Her comments were in response to media speculation
that she was chosen for the position because she is highly respected
in the ruling Democratic Progressive Party and that her appointment
could somehow silence the many aspirants within the party who have
been coveting the post.
</P>
<P>
She also claimed that the election is not on her mind, saying
that the decision on who will be the DPP candidate will be based on
the prospective candidates' credentials, abilities as well as
suitability in leading the city forward to become a great city.
</P>
<P>
Noting that there is a democratic system within the DPP in
choosing the party's candidate for the Kaohsiung mayoral election,
Yeh said that any aspirants will have to win the candidacy through
the mechanism.
</P>
<P>
She also said that she has communicated with Kaohsiung City
Council Speaker Tsai Chien-hsin and will call on the city council
Wednesday.

<P>
A Taiwanese trade delegation made up
of representatives of agricultural businesses called on U.S. Senate
Finance Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley at his office Monday.
</P>
<P>
The delegation, headed by Chen Hsi-huang, chairman of the Taiwan
Grains and Seeds Development Foundation, comprises representatives of
the Taiwan Feed Industry Association, the Taiwan Vegetable Oil
Manufacturers Association, the Taiwan Flour Mills Industry
Association and the Taiwan Regional Association of Tanneries.
</P>
<P>
Grassley expressed his thanks to Taiwan for its generous purchase
of American agricultural products and its sparing no efforts to push
for trade exchanges with his country. At the same time, the senator
asked when Taiwan will reopen its market to U.S. beef and beef
products.
</P>
<P>
The Taiwan group is scheduled to sign a letter of intent on
agricultural procurement for 2006 and 2007 Wednesday on Capitol Hill.
According to the pact, Taiwan will buy 14.5 million tons of soybeans,
corn and wheat, as well as more than 5 million pieces of rawhides in
the United States in both 2006 and 2007. The total value of the
product is estimated at around US$3.1 billion.
</P>
<P>
According to Taiwan's Representative Office in the United States,
Taiwan is currently the seventh largest market for U.S. agricultural
exports. In the 2004-2005 agricultural procurement agreement, Taiwan
promised to purchase from U.S. traders 15.1 million tons of soybeans,
corn and wheat, as well as 4 million pieces of rawhides. To date,
Taiwan has imported 10.5 million tons of grains and beans under the
agreement.
</P>

The agricultural delegation is scheduled to visit U.S. Secretary
of Agriculture Mike Johanns Tuesday. On Friday, members of the group
will be divided into three teams for separate visits to U.S. states
that produce soybeans, maize, wheat and rawhides.

FORMER KAOSHIUNG MAYOR BLAMES PREMIER FOR KRTC FIASCO
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Sept. 13 (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Former Kaohsiung Mayor Wu Den-yih blamed
his successor Frank Hsieh, who is now premier, Tuesday for failing to
supervise the construction of Kaohsiung's rapid transit system,
claiming that Hsieh should take full responsibility for the project.
</P>
<P>
During a TV interview Sept. 7, Hsieh showed official documents
indicating that the decision to use the "build, operate and transfer"
(BOT) model to build the system was made while Wu was mayor.
</P>
<P>
The BOT project was at the center of a controversy after Thai
workers brought into the country to build the system rioted Aug. 21
in protest over maltreatment by private contractors.
</P>
<P>
Wu, now an opposition Kuomintang (KMT) legislator, rebutted
Hsieh's accusation that the decision to transfer the right to build
the orange line to private investors was made on the eve of the 1998
mayoral election in an apparent attempt to prevent the incumbent KMT
mayor's challenger -- Hsieh himself -- who ended up winning the
election, from enjoying the right to assign construction contracts.
</P>
<P>
During the interview, Hsieh claimed that after he became mayor,
he did not see the official documents until it was time to negotiate
the terms of the BOT contract, and that as the KMT was still in power
in the central government, it was nearly impossible to change the KMT
policy.
</P>
<P>
Wu said while he was on the election campaign, his deputy, Huang
Chun-ying, sent the city's decision on the MRT to the Executive Yuan,
which did not agree with the city government's proposal to build the
system under the BOT model.
</P>
<P>
But when Hsieh took over as mayor, he went ahead and implemented
the BOT project, Wu pointed out, adding that it should be Hsieh, not
himself, who should take the blame.
</P>
<P>
Wu said if he were responsible, he would have long been thrown
behind bars.
</P>
<P>
He noted that acting mayor Chen Chi-mai, who was in that position
for only six months, has resigned over the KRTC scandal, whereas
Hsieh, who has been mayor for over six years and has seen so many
problems with the project, has not even made a single apology.

TAIWAN QUESTIONS CHINA'S RESTRICTIONS ON FOREIGN BANKS
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Geneva,   Sept.  12  (CNA)
(By C.H. Lu and P.C. Tang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taiwan has questioned whether the
restrictions imposed by China on foreign banks violate its accession
commitment to the World Trade Organization (WTO) and has demanded an
explanation from Beijing for the restrictions, a source close to the
Taiwan Permanent Mission to the WTO said Monday.
</P>
<P>
The WTO is set to begin this month its fourth transitional review
over China's trade policy since the nation became a member of the
world trade body in 2002.
</P>
<P>
The source said that although Taiwan has not yet authorized its
banks to set up branches in China, the questions it has raised under
the WTO's Transitional Review Mechanism are aimed at examining
whether China has honored its accession agreement and are not related
to Taiwan's current policy toward China.
</P>
<P>
Several Taiwan banks have set up offices rather than branches in
China, according to the source.
</P>
<P>
The mission said that China promised when it became a WTO member
that its licence-approval procedure would not become market-access
restrictions, adding that it also recognizes China's efforts to
improve its business environment as well as to honor its accession
commitment to the WTO.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, the mission does not agree with Beijing's
requirement that a foreign bank branch must start with a minimum
capital of 100 million renminbi to 500 million renminbi and that a
foreign bank that wants to set up a branch in China must have assets
of at least US$20 billion.
</P>
<P>
Demanding that China explain whether its restrictions are in line
with the rules of the General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS)
and its accession commitments to the WTO, the mission also questioned
whether China has a plan to reduce the minimum capital request.
</P>
<P>
It also demanded that Beijing explain its rules relating to the
US$20 billion minimum assets requirement.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan also questioned China's rules that demand that foreign
insurance companies who want to open branches in China must first set
up offices in China for at least two years, claiming that as
experience has shown that it only takes a few months for a foreign
insurance company to complete its procedure for obtaining a licence
from the Chinese authorities, Beijing should shorten the time of
licence-approval to less than one year.

ARMS PROCUREMENT PROJECT STONEWALLED FOR 28TH TIME
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei, Sept. 13 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The opposition-controlled Legislative Yuan
blocked a long-stalled arms procurement package for the 28th time
Tuesday, refusing to allow it to be put on the legislative agenda.
</P>
<P>
The package comprises three big-ticket weaponry items -- eight
diesel-electric submarines, a squadron of 12 P-3C anti-submarine
aircraft and six Patriot PAC III anti-missile batteries. For more
than a year, the opposition "pan-blue alliance" of the Kuomintang
(KMT) and the People First Party (PFP) has refused to screen the
package because it claims the price is too high and that it should be
listed under the regular budget rather than a special budget.
</P>
<P>
The package was rejected the second time in the newly opened
session of the legislature after the Ministry of National Defense put
one item in the package -- the anti-missile batteries -- under the
regular budget in response to a suggestion by some opposition
legislators and remarks by Legislative Speaker Wang Jin-pyng that the
arms procurement package should move into the review process.
</P>
<P>
William C.T. Lai, a caucus whip of the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party, condemned the opposition parties for "maliciously
blocking" the package yet again.
</P>
<P>
The package concerns national security, and the opposition
parties have no reason to oppose it, Lai claimed, adding that the
public should turn away from the opposition parties for putting
national security in jeopardy.
</P>
<P>
KMT Legislator Tseng Yung-chuan claimed, however, that caution is
needed in regard to arms procurement, adding that there is "no rush"
to review the package as public consensus has yet to be forged.
</P>
<P>
The KMT caucus will hold a meeting Thursday to listen to the
views of the party's legislators, he said.
</P>
<P>
Not only the arms procurement package, but other proposals such
as the confirmation of the Control Yuan members nominated by
President Chen Shui-bian, the establishment of a bill governing the
establishment of a supervisory committee for the labor pension fund,
amendments to the Referendum Law, the handling of ill-gotten assets
by civic groups, and the amendment to the National Property Law were
also blocked.
</P>
<P>
But the proposals for the central government budget for next
year, a special budget to expand public construction, as well as
legislation relating to Chinese people coming to Taiwan as tourists
were put on the agenda.
</P>
<P>
A draft bill concerning artificial insemination was also put on
the agenda in the wake of a controversy over the fiancee of an army
captain who requested to harvest his sperm after he was killed in an
accident.

PREMIER REJECTS REPORTS ON ACTING KAOHSIUNG MAYOR APPOINTMENT
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Sept.  13 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Premier Frank Hsieh rejected Tuesday
reports about having a political axe to grind in his appointment of
the new acting Kaohsiung mayor.
</P>
<P>
Hsieh, a possible contender for the presidential election in
2008, was responding to reports about an opposition legislator who
questioned if Hsieh's appointment of Yeh Chu-lan, a senior advisor to
President Chen Shui-bian, to the post of acting Kaohsiung mayor, had
anything to do with putting her in a more high-profile position to
pave the way for putting her on the next presidential election
ticket.
</P>
<P>
Hsieh denied the legislator's allegation, saying that "the public
will know that it is not going to happen with the passing of the
time," while Yeh said the possibility of a Hsieh-Yeh ticket would be
"nil."
</P>
<P>
"Those who made the speculation obviously don't know much about
the ruling Democratic Progressive Party," Yeh claimed.
</P>
<P>
Yeh said that as a member of the administrative team, it is her
duty to accept the appointment.
</P>
<P>
Yeh said she hopes to continue what she described as Hsieh's
"good performance" as Kaohsiung mayor before he assumed the
premiership, as well as that of former acting Kaohsiung Mayor Chen
Chi-mai, who stepped down to take responsibility for the Aug. 21 riot
by Thai laborers working for the rapid transit system in Kaohsiung.

TSU CHALLENGES `PAN-BLUE ALLIANCE' TO RE-ELECT LEGISLATURE
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Sept.  13 (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The opposition Taiwan Solidarity Union
(TSU) challenged Tuesday the opposition "pan-blue alliance" of the
Kuomintang (KMT), People First Party (PFP) and New Party, which forms
a majority in the Legislative Yuan, to topple Premier Frank Hsieh's
Cabinet so the president can dissolve the legislature.
</P>
<P>
TSU Chairman Su Chin-chiang asked them to look at Japanese Prime
Minister Junichiro Koizumi's example and initiate "a bold project" to
dissolve the legislature and give the people a chance to re-elect it.
</P>
<P>
Su made the proposal in response to the "pan-blue alliance's"
boycott of such major bills as the long-stalled arms procurement bill
and legislation over an NT$80 billion flood control project.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the Legislative Yuan, TSU caucus convener Ho Min-hao
blamed the "pan-blue alliance" for causing political chaos in Taiwan
and challenged it to propose a no-confidence vote against the
premier.
</P>
<P>
Hsieh himself has also challenged the major opposition parties to
topple his Cabinet so President Chen Shui-bian can disband the
legislature and call an election.
</P>
<P>
Ho's caucus had planned to initiate a no-confidence motion, but
called off the action because not all 12 members of the caucus
supported it. The TSU and the ruling Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP), which form the "pan-green camp, " failed to win a majority of
the 225 seats during the last legislative election in late 2004.
</P>
<P>
The Constitution stipulates that a motion of no-confidence on the
premier can be initiated if signed by more than one-third of the
legislators. The premier should resign if more than half of the
lawmakers vote for the motion, and request that the president
dissolve the legislature.
</P>
<P>
"Pan-blue" lawmakers said they would not "fall into the
`pan-green' trap" since executive power would still be in the
president's hands even after a legislative shake-up.
</P>
<P>
If Taiwan wants to learn from Japan, the people should also have
a chance to re-elect the president when they vote for a new
legislature, they claimed.

with the Order of Brilliant Star with Grand Cordon Tuesday in
recognition of their contributions to Taiwan's athletic development.
</P>
<P>
Yang, better known as the "Iron Man of Asia, " burst onto the
international sports scene at the 1954 Asian Games, winning the gold
for Taiwan in the decathlon, while Chi competed at three Olympics for
Taiwan in 1960, 1964 and 1968, and won a bronze medal in the 80-meter

Taitung County, also won a silver medal in the decathlon of the 1960

Tseng, considered a "national treasure" of baseball, served as
coach of different-level national baseball teams that took part in
various world baseball tournaments.

<P>
Speaking at an award ceremony at the Presidential Office, Yang
voiced the hope that the government will attach greater importance to
sports development.
</P>

Chi promised to continue to help step up Taiwan's athletic
development by sticking to what Chen called the spirit of the "Taiwan
son." During a meeting with a group of all Olympic medal winners at
the Presidential Office May 3, 2001, Chen said that the perseverance
shown by athletes exemplified the spirit of the "Taiwan son, "
according to Chi.

U.S. SUGGESTS TAIWAN RAISE DEFENSE BUDGET TO 3.5% OF GDP: PAPER
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Tokyo, Sept. 13 (CNA)
(By Mike Chang and Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The United States has suggested that Taiwan
raise its defense budget to 3.5 percent of its gross domestic product
(GDP) to prevent the cross-Taiwan Strait military balance from
tilting further in favor of China, a Japanese economic daily reported
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Nihon Keizai Shimbun quoted unidentified sources familiar
with Taiwan-U.S. military exchanges as saying that U.S. Defense
Secretary Donald Rumsfeld had conveyed the message to senior Taiwan
military officers during a meeting in the United States earlier this
summer.
</P>
<P>
Quoting data collected by the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency,
the newspaper said in a Washington-datelined dispatch that Taiwan's
2004 military spending accounted for about 2.6 percent of its GDP,
far lower than China's ratio of 4.3 percent. The U.S. defense
spending ratio is about 3.5 percent of its GDP.
</P>
<P>
The report said the United States has on many occasions pushed
Taiwan to accelerate its military modernization, but added that it is
unusual for the United States to suggest a concrete figure by which
it thinks Taiwan should increase its defense spending. This, the
paper claimed, mainly reflects rising U.S. concern about the growing
imbalance in military strength on the two sides of the Taiwan Strait.
</P>
<P>
To meet Taiwan's defense needs, the United States agreed in 2001
to sell a robust package of weapons to Taiwan, including eight
diesel-electric submarines, six Patriot PAC III anti-missile
batteries and a squadron of 12 P-3C anti-submarine aircraft. The
deal, however, has so far not been struck because of a boycott by
Taiwan's opposition "pan-blue alliance" that holds a slim majority in
the legislature.
</P>
<P>
In July, the United States unveiled an annual report on China's
military power that expressed apprehension about the rapid increase
in the number of ballistic missiles deployed by China against Taiwan.
The number of Chinese missiles targeting at Taiwan has been increased
at a rate of about 100 annually in recent years. American military
experts said that if Taiwan fails to beef up its defense
capabilities, the cross-strait military imbalance will widen
substantially.

NEW CLA HEAD VOWS TO UPHOLD LABORERS' RIGHTS
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei, Sept. 13 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The newly appointed chairman of the Council
of Labor Affairs (CLA) vowed Tuesday to protect and uphold the rights
of laborers.
</P>
<P>
Lee Ying-yuan, secretary-general of the Executive Yuan, made the
remarks after he was appointed by Premier Frank Hsieh to head the
nation's top labor administrative agency following the resignation of
Chen Chu. 
</P>
<P>
Lee, 52, a medical professor-turned-politician, has previously
served as a legislator and as vice representative to the United
States, as well as vice secretary-general of the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP).
</P>
<P>
Lee said that taking over the post from Chen Chu, a heavyweight
within the DPP, gave him a feeling of great responsibility after
taking over the baton from Chen.
</P>
<P>
He also claimed that the DPP, moving from an opposition force to
a major social movement force to its present ruling stance, "has
always sided with the laborers" and that "laborers have been the
blessing of Taiwan and myself."
</P>
<P>
Lee said he "will not let the DPP or the laborers down, " adding
that he has long "mingled with laborers and social movement
activists" and that he will continue to work toward upholding the
"dignity, rights, working conditions and retirement system" of
laborers.
</P>
<P>
Executive Yuan spokesman Cho Jung-tai made an announcement
earlier in the day that the premier believes Lee to be dynamic and
with rich experience in coordinating among government agencies, which
makes him very qualified to fill the post vacated by Chen Chu, who
resigned over the Aug. 21 riot by Thai laborers working for Kaohsiung
Rapid Transit Corp. in the southern Taiwan port city.
</P>
<P>
Reports also said that the premier was impressed by Lee's
performance in communication and coordination over the recent strikes
by the workers' unions of the state-controlled Chunghwa Telecom and
Taiwan Business Bank.

filibustering is allowed in the parliaments of democratic countries
for an opposition party to get concessions from the ruling party.
</P>
<P>
Filibuster is a term for any attempt to block or delay
legislative action through debate at length, or by offering numerous
procedural motions or any other delaying or obstructive actions.
</P>
<P>
Asked by reporters about doubts from the public that the
opposition parties have not done an adequate job in overseeing the
performance of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party, Ma said he
has asked the KMT legislative caucus to become more sensitive to
public opinion and to react more quickly to issues that are of great
concern to the public.
</P>
<P>
The legislature spent its first day in chaos, as opposition party
caucus members from both the KMT and the People First Party (PFP)
took over the rostrum to voice their demands that Premier Frank Hsieh
should not be allowed to present his report on the work of his
Cabinet but should be granted leave while waiting for an
investigation on a series of alleged scandals involving either him or
members of his Cabinet.
</P>
<P>
The KMT and PFP caucuses want to set up a commission to
investigate suspected corruption in the construction projects of the
Kaohsiung rapid transit system and Taiwan's high-speed railway, the
second phase of the government's financial reform plan, an insider
trading scandal involving a top official charged with the duty of
preventing insider trading in the stock market, and the privatization
of state-run Chunghwa Telecom that deliberately violated a resolution
passed by the previous legislature calling on the government to halt
the move.
</P>
<P>
There was a sea of placards with slogans held by members of
different party caucuses in the meeting hall.
</P>
<P>
Some KMT legislators unfurled white banners carrying such slogans
as "Find those who sucked the blood of Thai laborers working on the
Kaohsiung rapid transit railway, " and "Corrupt Premier Hsieh should
be on leave and waiting for investigation."
</P>
<P>
The opposition legislators claimed they wanted to use the strong
protest actions to show the severity of the series of alleged
corruption cases that surfaced while the legislature was in recess.
</P>
<P>
Amid the chaos, the caucus of the opposition Taiwan Solidarity
Union tried to get support for a proposal to topple the Cabinet, so
that President Chen Shui-bian can disband the legislature in an
attempt to break the current deadlock and pave the way for the
election of a new Legislative Yuan.

MORE TAIWAN HIGH-SPEED RAILWAY CARRIAGES ARRIVE FROM JAPAN
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Kaohsiung,  Sept.  13 (CNA)
(By Luis Huang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The 23rd set of locomotives and
carriages for Taiwan's high-speed railway arrived from Japan Tuesday
at Kaohsiung Harbor in southern Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
The carriages will be transported to an assembly plant of the
Taiwan High Speed Rail Corp. (THSRC) Wednesday in Kaohsiung County, a
THSRC spokesman said, adding that a series of test runs for the new
carriages will be conducted on a test track after assembly is
completed.
</P>
<P>
The arrival of the carriages appeared to quash a rumor that the
Japanese supplier will suspend its delivery of the carriages because
of the THSRC's financial problems, according to the spokesman. THSRC
has ordered a total of 30 sets of carriages from Japan.
</P>
<P>
THSRC Chairwoman Nita Ing announced last Wednesday that the
inauguration of Taiwan's first high-speed railway will be postponed
for one year until Oct. 31, 2006. The 345-km railway linking Taipei
in northern Taiwan and Kaohsiung in the south was originally
scheduled to be inaugurated next month.
</P>
<P>
Ing apologized to investors and the public over the decision, but
claimed she is confident of achieving the new goal of launching the
high-speed railway by October next year.
</P>
<P>
She said that in view of an overall consideration of the progress
of the construction, system tests and operation preparations, the
board of directors was forced to postpone the launch by one year.
</P>
<P>
Ing was unwilling to identify where the faults lie but said that
the Japanese Shinkansen system is "more complex" than expected.
</P>
<P>
However, THSRC officials said construction of core mechanical and
electrical systems have lagged behind schedule by more than 30
percent, affecting system tests and operation preparations.
</P>
<P>
The trip between Taiwan's biggest and second-biggest cities will
supposedly take about 90 minutes. The multibillion-dollar railway
system is also Taiwan's first infrastructure project being built
under the build-operate-transfer (BOT) model.

Q2 HOUSING PRICES CONFIDENCE LEVEL AT TWO-YEAR LOW: CEPD
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Sept.  13 (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The composite confidence in Taiwan's
housing prices dropped to 100.53 points in the second quarter of this
year, the lowest since the third quarter of 2003, when SARS (severe
acute respiratory syndrome) was ravaging the country, according to a
Council for Economic Planning and Development (CEPD) report released
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, house mortgages as a share of family income
has risen for the seventh quarter in a row, an indication that
housing prices may be approaching a peak, said the report.
</P>
<P>
The report noted that nationally in the second quarter, house
buyers were paying 629 percent of their annual income to buy a house,
and mortgage payments accounted for 29 percent of their monthly
income, an increase of 2.9 percent over the same period of last year
and the seventh consecutive quarterly increase.
</P>
<P>
The "Report on the Changes in Taiwan's Housing Demands" pointed
out that the average space for negotiating the price of a house
during the second quarter of 2005 has gone up to 10.5 percent, up 0.8
percent from the previous quarter and a two-year high.
</P>
<P>
Another indicator that a buyer's market exists is that the
average time used to look for a residence has lengthened to 4.7
months, as buyers have turned more hesitant.
</P>
<P>
On their views of housing prices in the coming year, 30.4 percent
of surveyed house buyers said it will rise, while 29.7 percent said
it will fall, still another indication that house buyers are becoming
more reserved about the housing market, said the report.
</P>
<P>
But for the near future, 32.1 percent of those who have bought a
house said housing prices will go up, with only 14.7 percent saying
that they will go down.
</P>
<P>
Professor Chang Chin-er of National Chengchi University said the
message should catch the attention of sellers.
</P>
<P>
The report surveyed house buyers, real estate agents and banks
across the country from July 1 to July 15, receiving 2,964 valid
responses. The margin of error was around 3 percent.

LEGISLATURE OPENS IN CHAOS, KMT STOPS PREMIER FROM GIVING BRIEFING
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Sept. 13 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taiwan's legislature opened the first day
of the new session Tuesday with chaotic shouting and shoving as
opposition Kuomintang (KMT) lawmakers prevented Premier Frank Hsieh
from taking the podium to give his report on the administration's
agenda.
</P>
<P>
The floor of the legislature was filled with lawmakers from
various parties holding placards -- from the opposition camp:
"Anti-corruption, save Taiwan"; from ruling party supporters:
"Dissolve the legislature, hold a new election."
</P>
<P>
KMT lawmakers said that the premier should not be allowed to
continue at his post until investigations have been completed into a
riot on Aug. 21 by Thai laborers in Kaohsiung over poor working
conditions.
</P>
<P>
As Hsieh was mayor of the city from 1998 to 2005, the legislators
said that he could be involved in the import of the Thai workers and
might have been involved in alleged kickbacks surrounding the mass
rapid transit system that the workers are constructing.
</P>
<P>
The KMT lawmakers claimed that it was Hsieh who decided to bring
in the Thai workers, and that he should subject himself to a judicial
investigation.
</P>
<P>
Since it became clear that the premier was not going to be able
to give his report on schedule, Legislative Yuan President Wang
Jin-pyng, a KMT member, called for a break and urged the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) to negotiate with the KMT to find
a way to end their protest.
</P>
<P>
Premier Hsieh, meanwhile, sat out the storm absorbed in a book.
</P>
<P>
Negotiations went nowhere as the DPP would not agree to the KMT's
call for the establishment of an ad hoc group under the Legislative
Yuan to look into the riot as well as several other hi-profile
incidents, including the postponement of the opening of the nation's
first high-speed rail line and the sale of government stakes in
Chunghwa Telecom.
</P>
<P>
Taking the bull by the horns, the DPP not only turned down the
KMT's idea, they dared the opposition to try to oust the premier's
Cabinet by calling for a non-confidence vote, which would mean that
if successful, the president could dissolve the legislature and call
for a snap election.
</P>
<P>
Getting no satisfaction from the ruling party, KMT lawmakers
again occupied the podium and quarrelled with their DPP counterparts.
Wang was forced to announce another break until 3:15 p.m.
</P>
<P>
After the break, Wang invited the premier to give his report. But
KMT lawmaker Huang Chao-hsun refused to let the premier go to the
podium, which forced a third break which last until 6: 05 p.m. when
the speaker called an end to the day's fiasco.
</P>
<P>
Later in the day, the premier said he was frustrated with the
opposition's behavior and blamed KMT lawmakers for disappointing
their constituents by hindering the legislative process when
taxpayers across the nation are hard at work.
</P>
<P>
Lawmakers of the Taiwan Solidarity Union, a political ally of the
DPP, also blamed the KMT, saying that they had wasted an entire day
of the legislature, which had cost taxpayers millions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
However, Wang said that Tuesday's protest was "mild" in
comparison with the DPP's actions during the time when the KMT was in
power.
</P>
<P>
He said the premier had a chance to give his report in the
afternoon, but it was wasted because of an eleventh-hour hitch in
negotiations between the DPP and the KMT.
</P>
<P>
Calling partisan bickering a natural part of democracy, Wang
urged the public to be patient, adding that he was sure that the
political parties will sort out their differences eventually.

TAIWAN BUSINESS BANK EMPLOYEES END FOUR-DAY STRIKE AGAINST MERGER
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Sept. 13 (CNA)
(By Han Nai-kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Thousands of employees of the state-owned
Taiwan Business Bank agreed to return to work from Wednesday, ending
their four-day strike against a merger plan after opposition
legislators promised to intervene on their behalf and include the
issue on the agenda of the legislature.
</P>
<P>
Lin Wan-fu, chairman of the Taiwan Business Industrial Union, who
led the strike, said the battlefield has now shifted to the
Legislative Yuan, and that union members will not resume their strike
unless the government continues the auction process to select a
satisfactory top bidder.
</P>
<P>
Some 3,000 of the banks's 5,000 staff began a strike last
Thursday to protest the planned merger which they fear would cause
many of them to lose their jobs. They staged sit-ins outside the
bank's main office buildings in Taipei, Taichung and Kaohsiung.
</P>
<P>
The government is trying to privatize the bank -- the 10th
largest in Taiwan -- as part of its plan to reduce the number of
state-owned banks in Taiwan to six by the end of the year through
mergers.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Finance was expected to announce a winning bidder
last Friday, but the auction turned out to be a failure because the
bids it received were unsatisfactory. The best offer reportedly came
from E. Sun Financial Holding Co., which took over the state-run
Kaohsiung Business Bank last year.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan's commercial newspapers have quoted Minister of Finance
Lin Chuan as saying that the merger plan will continue and that the
top bidder has been asked to make a higher offer within three to five
days.
</P>
<P>
Although some 90 opposition legislators had sponsored a motion by
late Tuesday calling on the Ministry of Finance to halt the auction,
finance officials indicated that the merger plan is unlikely to be
stopped at this stage.
</P>
<P>
They said that if the plan is to be scrapped, it will be due to
failure to secure a satisfactory bid in the second round of the
auction, rather than influence from the legislature.

TSU CALLS FOR PUBLIC TO DENOUNCE LEGISLATIVE CHAOS
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,   Sept.   13  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The legislative caucus of the
pro-independence opposition Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU) called for
the public to speak out against Tuesday's opening legislative session
as a waste of taxpayers' money, as nothing was achieved because of
opposition protests.
</P>
<P>
TSU legislative whip Ho Ming-hao made the appeal after the
pro-unification opposition "pan-blue alliance" occupied the podium at
the legislature for the entire session to prevent Premier Frank Hsieh
from delivering an administrative report.
</P>
<P>
Hsieh was originally scheduled to address the Legislative Yuan's
opening session in the morning and then field questions from
lawmakers of all political stripes. Due to a boycott by lawmakers
from the two "pan-blue alliance" parties -- the Kuomintang (KMT) and
the People First Party (PFP) , Hsieh and his entire Cabinet ended up
sitting all day in the legislature watching the "circus."
</P>
<P>
"Pan-blue alliance" legislators demanded that Hsieh take a leave
of absence as they claimed Hsieh was responsible for the Kaohsiung
mass rapid transit system construction scandal. Hsieh was Kaohsiung
mayor for six years until February, when he became premier.
</P>
<P>
Ho said the "pan-blue alliance" lawmakers were protesting at
taxpayers' expense. According to him, the national coffers must pay
NT$1.35 million in legislators' attendance fees per day when the
Legislative Yuan is in session.
</P>
<P>
"If the salaries of all Cabinet members and their aides as well
as legislature's administrative staff were taken into account, the
national coffers lost an estimated NT$10 million today, " Ho
lamented.
</P>
<P>
Ho said he worries that the "pan-blue alliance" will continue to
boycott the ruling Democratic Progressive Party's (DPP's) initiatives
at every turn for the rest of the legislature's term.
</P>
<P>
"I deplore the 'pan-blue alliance's' irrational move. The
alliance has used its majority in the legislature to stonewall a
number of critical bills, including the arms procurement package, the
eight-year, NT$80 billion flood-control project and the nomination of
the Control Yuan members for more than a year while daring not to
topple the Cabinet," Ho said.
</P>
<P>
Claiming that this situation should be changed, Ho urged ordinary
citizens to voice their discontent over the legislative inaction and
chaos.
</P>
<P>
Ho also called on the public to take to the streets Sept. 25 to
take part in a rally to be organized by the
Hand-in-Hand-to-Protect-Taiwan Alliance to call for the early passage
of the long-stalled arms procurement package to beef up Taiwan's
defense capabilities in the face of China's mounting threat.

Over 1,000 staff from the Asahi Breweries

<P>
Asahi employees will fly to Hualien in eight chartered China

PREMIER HSIEH URGES PUBLIC TO TRUST JUDICIAL PROBE OF KAOHSIUNG MRT
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Sept. 13 (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Premier Frank Hsieh said Tuesday that the
judiciary is investigating the Kaohsiung rapid transit project as
well as the Thai workers' riot, and people should trust the nation's
judicial system.
</P>
<P>
A frustrated Hsieh, who was blocked by the opposition from making
a report to the legislature on the opening day of its new session,
said he urges the people to think hard on the problems facing the
nation.
</P>
<P>
The biggest problem, in the premier's view, is the opposition's
lack of trust in the nation's judiciary.
</P>
<P>
Hsieh was kept from stepping onto the podium by Kuomintang (KMT)
and People First Party (PFP) legislators who demanded that he ask for
leave and wait for investigators' results in their questioning
regarding the Kaohsiung Rapid Transit Corp. scandal.
</P>
<P>
Hsieh said that throughout the day, he was "absorbed in
self-reflection" but he still wondered if the opposition's demand --
that he ask for a leave of absence and wait for the results of an
investigation -- would help resolve the problem.
</P>
<P>
He said even if investigative results were published, the
opposition would still accuse the government of political
interference, as they had done with regard to the judicial probe and
court ruling on the March 19, 2004 shooting of President Chen
Shui-bian and Vice President Annette Lu.
</P>
<P>
Before Kaohsiung's acting mayor, Chen Chi-mai, and Council of
Labor Affairs Chairwoman Chen Chu tendered their resignations over
the incident, many were demanding their heads, Hsieh said.
</P>
<P>
"Now they have resigned, but they are being called scapegoats or
being accused of evading, " the premier said.
</P>
<P>
In the "pan-blue alliance's" eyes, only an investigation by the
Legislative Yuan is valid, he said, referring to the KMT, PFP and New
Party alliance.
</P>
<P>
As a matter of fact, Hsieh continued, the Legislative Yuan is an
arena of political wrestling that will not resolve the real problem.
</P>
<P>
He said he would call on the people, not the opposition parties,
to look squarely into how to end the legislative impasse.

MOFA TASK FORCE TO MONITOR UPCOMING BUSH-HU MEETING: OFFICIAL
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei, Sept. 13 (CNA)
(By Luis Huang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has set up
a task force to keep an eye on the upcoming meeting between U.S.
President George W. Bush and Chinese President Hu Jintao on the
sidelines of this year's U.N. General Assembly, a government official
disclosed Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Victor J. Chin, director-general of the foreign ministry's
Department of North American Affairs, told a news conference that Hu
put off his trip to the United States until mid-September after
Hurricane Katrina battered three southern U.S. states in late August.
</P>
<P>
Hu is scheduled to meet Bush on the sidelines of the 60th U.N.
General Assembly, Chin said, adding that the two leaders are expected
to touch on the Taiwan issue during their meeting.
</P>
<P>
According to Chin, the foreign ministry task force will carefully
monitor the Bush-Hu meeting and evaluate whether Taiwan's national
interests have been affected.
</P>
<P>
Based on a previous U.S. briefing to Taiwan, the U.S. side will
persist in its consistent policy toward the two sides of the Taiwan
Strait, Chin said. He added that U.S. officials are expected to
deliver a briefing on the Bush-Hu meeting to the ROC government after
the event.
</P>
<P>
Touching on Taiwan's efforts to obtain a seat in the United
Nations, Chin said that the U.S. government is expected to maintain
its attitude towards the island's U.N. entry bid this year -- keeping
"goodwill silence."
</P>
<P>
Taiwan has adopted a new strategy to promote its bid to join the
U.N. by presenting two proposals through its diplomatic allies. One
urges the U.N. General Assembly to ascertain the U.N. representation
of the 23 million people of Taiwan, while the other asks the U.N. to
play an active role in safeguarding peace in the Taiwan Strait.
</P>
<P>
Chin said that the U.S. government has gained a better
understanding of Taiwan's stance of presenting the peace maintenance
proposal to the United Nations following intensive communications
between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
The ROC, a U.N. founding member, lost the "China" U.N. seat to
Beijing's communist government in 1971, and since 1993 has launched
annual bids to get back into the organization. The past 12 bids were
quashed by China and the prospects for this year's campaign remain
"unclear."
</P>
<P>
China's former Kuomintang (KMT) government lost a civil war to
the communists in 1949 and fled to Taiwan, where it claimed to be the
legitimate Chinese government. But it disavowed the claim in 1991 and
Taiwan's leaders have drifted toward a separate Taiwanese identity.

OFFICIAL CALLS FOR NORMALIZATION OF FINANCIAL TIES WITH CHINA
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Sept. 13 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A spokesman for the Financial Supervisory
Commission urged China Tuesday to conclude an accord with Taiwan on
the supervision and management of financial institutions as a step
toward the normalization of bilateral financial ties.
</P>
<P>
Lin Chung-cheng made the statement after Beijing decided last
week to provide 30 billion renminbi in credit to Taiwan-funded
companies in China.
</P>
<P>
Lin said his commission has worked out a draft bill governing the
establishment of representative offices in Taiwan by Chinese banks,
pending the Executive Yuan's approval.
</P>
<P>
Under this bill, Lin said, Chinese banks will be treated in the
same way as foreign banks, except for special cases.
</P>
<P>
The establishment of a representative office is the first step
for foreign banks to set up branch offices and do business in Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
However, Lin said the draft bill is negotiable, meaning that if
China would like to talk with Taiwan on this issue, this can be
arranged. For example, the requirement for a bank's minimum
investment provided for in the draft bill may be adjusted downward in
light of the fact that Taiwan's banks are usually of small size in
comparison with their Western counterparts.
</P>
<P>
As to the combined credit offered by local banks' overseas
banking units (OBU's) to overseas Taiwan businessmen, Lin said his
commission has no intention of raising the current ceiling of 30
percent of the OBU's net assets, and any suggestion that the ceiling
should be raised would need the approval of the Mainland Affairs
Council and the Central Bank of China.
</P>
<P>
Although no Chinese bank has ever expressed interesting in
operating in Taiwan thus far, Lin said his commission keeps an open
mind toward China, and is more than willing to talk with them on an
agreement of financial supervision and management which is the
necessary step toward the normalization of bilateral financial
relations.
</P>
<P>
The absence of such an agreement is part of the reason that no
banks on either side of the Taiwan Strait operate on the other side
in spite of the fact that trade between the two sides tops billions
of dollars every year.

KMT, PFP HEADS WILL NOT JOIN PRESIDENT'S  DIPLOMATIC TOUR
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Sept. 13 (CNA)
(By sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The heads of the two opposition "pan-blue
alliance" parties -- the Kuomintang (KMT) and the People First Party
(PFP) -- will not join President Chen Shui-bian on his upcoming
Central America diplomatic tour.
</P>
<P>
Presidential Office Secretary-General Yu Shyi-kun paid a visit to
PFP headquarters Tuesday to forward Chen's invitation to PFP Chairman
James Soong.
</P>
<P>
Yu said the president decided to invite opposition leaders to
join him on his diplomatic tour mainly because he wants to pool
wisdom and resources to expand the nation's diplomatic frontiers and
cement ties with the nation's allies in the face of China's
relentless diplomatic suppression against Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
As to whether Soong would accept the invitation, Yu said, Chen
would respect Soong's decision.
</P>
<P>
PFP Deputy Secretary-General Liao Tsang-sung received the
invitation and promised to relay it to Soong. PFP spokesman Hsieh
Kung-ping said later that as an opposition party, the PFP's main role
is to oversee the government's operations.
</P>
<P>
"Because of his busy schedule, Soong will not travel with Chen,"
Hsieh said, adding that the PFP wishes Chen a smooth Central America
journey.
</P>
<P>
Yu will also send a similar invitation to KMT Chairman Ma
Ying-jeou later this week.
</P>
<P>
Ma, who concurrently serves as Taipei mayor, said Tuesday he has
to turn down the president's invitation because he must field
questions at the Taipei City Council during that period.
</P>
<P>
Chen is scheduled to leave Taipei Sept. 20 for an 11-day
diplomatic tour that will take him to six Taiwan allies in Central
America and the Caribbean -- Nicaragua, Guatemala, the Dominican
Republic, Nicaragua, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, and Saint
Kitts and Nevis.
</P>
<P>
During his stay in Nicaragua, Chen will attend the fifth
Taiwan-Central American leadership meeting scheduled for Sept. 23. He
will make a transit stop in Miami on his way to Central America and
another in San Francisco on his way home.
</P>
<P>
While in Miami, Chen is expected meet with Florida Governor Jeb
Bush, a younger brother of President George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
A CNA report from Washington, D.C. quoted Richard Bush, a former
head of the American Institute in Taiwan, as saying that transit
visits to the United States are useful opportunities to bring
Taiwan's leaders up to date on developments of U.S.-PRC relations. If
there were particular observations or comments that Taiwan's leaders
made during the transits, they would certainly be conveyed back to
Washington, he added.

President Chen Shui-bian has sent a
congratulatory message to renowned Taiwan-born director Ang Lee for
winning the Golden Lion award for best movie at the 62nd Venice Film
Festival Sept. 10, Government Information Office (GIO) sources in New
York said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Lee grabbed the top honor at the prestigious film festival with
his latest work -- "Brokeback Mountain" -- a Canadian-produced film
starring Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal which tells the story of a
gay cowboy couple in the conservative American West of the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
"Brokeback Mountain" bested 19 other feature films to win the top
award at the film festival.
</P>
<P>
In his congratulatory message, President Chen praised Lee for
being "a source of pride" for all the people of Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Lee gained fame with the Taiwan-produced feature film "The
Wedding" (1993) -- a lighthearted and moving human-interest story. He
became internationally renowned after directing the Academy
Award-winning "Sense and Sensibility" (1995) and his later hit
"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon" (2000).

PFP HEAD KEEN TO STABILIZE CROSS-STRAIT RELATIONS
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taoyuan,  Sept.  14 (CNA)
(By P.C. Tang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Opposition People First Party (PFP)
Chairman James Soong promised Wednesday to do whatever he can to
stabilize cross-Taiwan Strait relations, saying that only a stable
relationship between Taiwan and China can help the island's economic
development.
</P>
<P>
The PFP head made the promise at Chiang Kai-shek Airport prior to
his departure for Shanghai where he will attend a forum jointly
organized by his PFP and the Communist Party of China (CPC) to
discuss trade, economic and "three links" issues.
</P>
<P>
According to Soong, the holding of the forum is aimed at
stabilizing relations between the two sides of the strait and helping
the Taiwan people enjoy a safer and more prosperous environment.
</P>
<P>
"Everybody knows that without a stable cross-strait relationship,
Taiwan's economic situation will not be able to improve, " he said,
adding that "if the political parties cannot work on stabilizing
Taipei-Beijing relations, the island's economy will not have a bright
future, and the Taiwan people will be the main victims."
</P>
<P>
Pointing out that Beijing stated in May of this year that it will
not use force against Taiwan if the island does not move towards
independence and that the Legislative Yuan has not yet resolved the
problems related to the arms procurement bill, the PFP chairman said
that its better for the political parties to help the people make a
good living than to agree to pay a large sum of money to purchase
arms from foreign countries.
</P>
<P>
"Why don't we work together to stabilize cross-strait relations
and improve the island's economy as these are the public's main
expectations," he added.
</P>
<P>
He also promised that he will thoroughly exchange views during
his visit to Shanghai with high-ranking Chinese officials on issues
regarding the establishment of mutual trust and direct charter flight
services and sea links between the two sides of the strait.
</P>
<P>
Soong also criticized the ruling Democratic Progressive Party's
"mini three-links" policy, saying that the policy is already "lame."
</P>
<P>
"If ships coming from Hong Kong and Macau to Taiwan do not pose
any security problems to the island, why would ships sailing from
Xiamen and Foujou to Taiwan be harmful to the island's security, " he
asked.
</P>
<P>
Talking about the invitations extended by President Chen
Shui-bian to opposition leaders to join him on his upcoming visits to
Taiwan's diplomatic allies in Central America, Soong took U.S.
President George W. Bush's recent decision to cut short meetings with
foreign heads of state and make dealing with the natural disaster
along the U.S. Gulf Coast a top priority, saying that the leader of a
country should first deal with issues that the people are most
concerned with.

PREMIER URGES CABINET MEMBERS TO USE FILIBUSTER TIME PRODUCTIVELY

<TEXT>
<P>
Premier Frank Hsieh on Wednesday told
members of his Cabinet to prepare for the possibility that the
opposition parties' filibustering tactics in the Legislative Yuan
could become a "normal state of affairs" and to make good use of the
delays by doing something useful.
</P>
<P>
The premier, who was blocked from delivering his administrative
report when opposition legislators took turns occupying the podium
during the entire first day of the new legislative session Tuesday,
made the remarks during an Executive Yuan floor meeting.
</P>
<P>
Hsieh and his entire Cabinet ended up sitting all day in the
legislature watching the "circus" Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The premier noted that chaos is a phenomenon seen in the early
stages of a democracy, adding that the administration must continue
doing its work and not idle away the time unproductively.
</P>
<P>
He urged his Cabinet members to use the extra time to do useful
things such as looking over reports, holding small coordination
meetings and handling petitions by legislators, pointing to himself
as an example by saying that he got a lot of work done during the
previous day's filibuster and even read half a book.

TAIWAN CANNOT OPERATE NORMALLY WITHOUT U.N. MEMBERSHIP: ENVOY
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
New York,  Sept.  13 (CNA)
(By Lillian Lin and P.C. Tang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taiwan's top envoy in New York City
stated in a radio interview Tuesday the difficulties that the nation
has experienced in its bid to join the United Nations, saying that
the government cannot operate normally without membership of
international organizations.
</P>
<P>
The interview with Andrew Hsia, director of the Taipei Economic
and Cultural Office in New York, was conducted on the eve of the
opening of the 60th U.N. General Assembly with the aim of discussing
issues related to Taiwan's U.N. bid and the situation in the Taiwan
Strait.
</P>
<P>
Hsia said that for many countries, obtaining
U.N. membership seems to be a natural thing, but pointed out that
Taiwan has encountered many difficulties in its bid to join the
organization.
</P>
<P>
"The Taiwan government and its people will be unable to operate
normally nor to make more contributions to the international
community if they cannot join international organizations, " he said,
claiming that although Taiwan has tried to give assistance to the
victims of various disasters, the donations have been refused by
international organizations.
</P>
<P>
As China's military buildup over the past few years has created
an imbalance of military power between the two sides of the Taiwan
Strait, Hsia said this is why Taiwan's allies hope the United Nations
can play an active role in maintaining peace in the strait.
</P>
<P>
"This is also why they have jointly raised a motion in support of
Taiwan's U.N. bid and have expressed the hope that the U.N. Standing
Committee will place the motion on the agenda of this year's U.N.
General Assembly," he said.
</P>
<P>
Asked whether Taiwan worries that closer economic and trade
relations between China and the United States will lead Washington to
give less support to the country, Hsia said that Taiwan-U.S.
relations have a solid historical background and are based on the
common values of freedom and democracy with a legal basis supplied by
the Taiwan Relations Act, but he added that Taiwan expects more
support from the United States.
</P>
<P>
He also said that many factors will affect the development of
cross-strait relations.

President Bush yesterday said he takes personal responsibility
for the federal government's stumbling response to Hurricane Katrina,
as his White House worked on several fronts to move beyond the
improvisation of the first days of the crisis and set a long-term
course on a problem that aides now believe will shadow the balance of
Bush's second term.

FORMER KAOHSIUNG MAYOR: PREMIER SHOULD STEP DOWN
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Sept.  14 (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Former Kaohsiung Mayor Wu Den-yih said
Wednesday that Premier Frank Hsieh should step down, claiming that he
lied during a Sept. 7 TV interview about who decided to build
Kaohsiung's mass rapid transit system under the
build-operate-transfer (BOT) model.
</P>
<P>
Wu, now an opposition Kuomintang (KMT) legislator, claimed that
it was Hsieh who decided to adopt the BOT model for Kaohsiung's mass
rapid transit system but then said the decision was Wu's. Former
China Steel Corp. Chairman Wang Chung-yu was also named by Hsieh.
</P>
<P>
Wu showed a copy of an official document, which he said was
provided by an anonymous sneak because his own request for data from
the Ministry of Transport and Communications (MOTC) was denied, to
support his claim.
</P>
<P>
According to the document, dated March 12, 1999, then-Mayor Hsieh
-- who defeated Wu in a 1998 mayoral election -- officially informed
the Executive Yuan that he had decided to build the city's mass rapid
transit routes under the BOT model.
</P>
<P>
Wu said he asked for leave Dec. 4 to run for re-election and his
deputy, Huang Chun-ying, sent a letter to the MOTC asking it to
approve the city's suggestion to adopt the BOT model. Huang sent the
letter in response to an Executive Yuan instruction, which later said
it did not agree with the city government on the issue.
</P>
<P>
Hsieh then announced in 1999 that the city's MRT will be built
under the BOT model put forward by Wu.
</P>
<P>
Wu claimed that it is "utterly evident" that during his six years
as Kaohsiung mayor, Hsieh himself made the final decision on the BOT
model but tried to shift responsibility to his predecessor by "lying"
to society.
</P>
<P>
Wu demanded to face Hsieh in an open debate and a
cross-examination session. Either he himself or Hsieh must quit
politics to take responsibility for the Kaohsiung MRT fiasco in order
to set a good example for Taiwan's politics, he added.
</P>
<P>
"This is not the time to talk about judicial procedures. Let's
talk about political responsibility first, " Wu challenged.
</P>
<P>
The choice of the BOT model for Kaohsiung MRT came under fire
after Thai workers brought in to build the project rioted Aug. 21 in
protest over maltreatment by the Huapan Administration Consultant Co.
Ltd., which managed the workers.
</P>
<P>
Kaohsiung Mass Rapid Transit Corp. Vice Chairman Chen Min-hsien,
who has been blamed for the fiasco, has resigned, as have Council of
Labor Affairs Chairwoman Chen Chu and Hsieh's successor, acting Mayor
Chen Chi-mai.

TAIWAN ABORIGINAL GROUP TO PROTEST AGAINST JAPAN AT U.N.
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Sept. 14 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Independent Legislator Kao Chin Su-mei is
scheduled to lead an aboriginal group to the United States Thursday
to lodge a protest at the United Nations against Japanese atrocities
against Taiwan's aboriginal people before and during War World II.
</P>
<P>
Kao Chin, an aborigine and a member of the Non-Partisan
Solidarity Union, is scheduled to lead the 60-member aboriginal group
to U.N. headquarters in New York Sept. 23 to tell the world how the
Japanese Imperial Army committed inhumane brutalities on Taiwan's
indigenous people during its colonial rule of the country.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference held at the Legislative Yuan on the group's
trip, she showed two copies of Japanese books, published in 1913 and
1914, respectively, which record how Japanese soldiers took
aboriginal villages militarily with reports written and photos taken
by members who were among the invading troops.
</P>
<P>
These books are solid evidence of the Japanese atrocities, Kao
Chin added.
</P>
<P>
Kao Chin led an aboriginal group to Japan in June to demand an
apology and compensation from the Japanese government for the
Taiwanese aborigines who were killed during World War II in combat as
drafted Japanese Imperial Army soldiers.
</P>
<P>
Kao Chin and the protesters had planned to demonstrate outside
the Yasukuni Shrine in Tokyo, where their ancestors who fought for
the Japanese are honored among some 2.5 million soldiers who died
fighting for Japan, including more than 28,000 from Taiwan and 1,068
convicted war criminals.
</P>
<P>
They demanded the removal of the aboriginal soldiers' memorial
tablets from the shrine "so that their spirits can be escorted back
to Taiwan." Kao Chin said it was absurd that the aboriginal soldiers,
whom she described as victims of Japanese persecution, are honored
together with their persecutors at the Yasukuni Shrine.
</P>
<P>
Her group of protesters, however, were stopped about 200 meters
from the shrine and prohibited from getting off their buses by
Japanese police for fear that they might clash with a group of
Japanese right-wingers who had gathered at the scene ahead of their
arrival.
</P>
<P>
Describing their treatment by the Japanese police as "brutal, "
Kao Chin said it demonstrated once again that the Japanese government
has an absurd lack of remorse for what Japan did during World War II,
prompting her to decide to lead the same Taiwan group to the United
Nations to put their protest on the world stage.
</P>
<P>
"Where there is no Japan of remorse, there will be no Japan of
peace-seeking," Kao Chin said.

PREMIER DEPLORES LACK OF TRUST IN TAIWAN POLITICS
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Sept. 14 (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Premier Frank Hsieh deplored the lack of
trust in Taiwan's political circles Wednesday, in particular the
opposition's demand that he be investigated for his role in the
Kaohsiung mass rapid transit controversy.
</P>
<P>
"Investigated by whom? By the judicial institutions? It is the
opposition who has claimed the judiciary is dead, " Hsieh said at a
Cabinet meeting.
</P>
<P>
He criticized the opposition parties for "adding to problems
instead of solving them" by demanding judicial inquiries as they see
fit and if the investigation results are not to their satisfaction,
they just claim that the judicial system is dead.
</P>
<P>
Judging from a few previous examples, such as the court ruling on
the March 19, 2004 shooting of the president and vice president,
which was not to their liking, they responded by claiming the ruling
was the product of political interference, said the premier.
</P>
<P>
"If a judicial investigation were to find me innocent, they would
make the same claim, a response that will not help solve the problem
but will simply destroy the credibility of our judicial system, "
Hsieh said.
</P>
<P>
He suggested that everyone "return to the institutions" and, if
court rulings are defective, make criticisms from the perspective of
evidence or theory, because these are "civilized" standards based on
which the institutions can operate and win the trust of the people.
</P>
<P>
He said some observers are worried that the opposition's
filibuster of the premier's report to the legislature Tuesday might
have scuttled his "rapprochement and symbiosis" philosophy, but added
that it will take time for his philosophy to take root. However, he
claimed that he is still "fully confident" of Taiwan's path toward
rapprochement and symbiosis.

FORMER MONGOLIAN PRIME MINISTER TO ATTEND FORUM IN TAIPEI

<TEXT>
<P>
Former Mongolian Prime Minister
Rinchinnyamiin Amarjargal will attend the inaugural meeting of the
World Forum for Democratization in Asia (WFDA) in Taipei that is
scheduled to open Thursday, Vice Foreign Affairs Minister Michael
Ying-mao Kau said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Kau, who is also the executive director of the Taiwan Foundation
for Democracy (TFD), which is sponsoring the forum, said the former
Mongolian leader, together with former Dominican Republic President
Hipolito Mejia, former El Salvador President Francisco Guillermo
Flores and former Republic of China President Lee Teng-hui will have
a discussion that it is hoped will help raise the international
profile of Asian democracy.
</P>
<P>
In addition, more than 100 government and civic group leaders
from more than 20 countries, as well as regional organization
leaders, Asian democracy activists and parliamentarians will also
take part in the Sept. 15-17 forum at the Taipei International
Convention Center, he said.
</P>
<P>
Among them are Singapore Democratic Party Secretary-General Chee
Soon Juan and Chinese pro-democracy activist Xiao Qiang.
</P>
<P>
Kau said the inaugural meeting will discuss and adopt guidelines
to promote the solidarity of Asian democracies, support democracy
activists who are opposed to authoritarian regimes, and solicit
support from the international community on democratization in Asia.
</P>
<P>
The plan is to submit the guidelines to the United Nations'
Secretariat and member states for reference, and obtain the status of
providing counselling to the U.N. so that the views of the WFDA can
be passed to related meetings in the U.N. and Asia's democratic voice
can be strengthened in the United Nations, he said.
</P>
<P>
The three-day meeting will feature a number of speakers,
including Canadian parliamentarian David Kilgour, who will speak on
human rights in Asia; Michael H.H. Hsiao, national policy advisor to
President Chen Shui-bian, who will address the topic of Taiwan's
democratization; and Professor Arthur Waldron of the University of
Pennsylvania, who will give his outlook on democratic development in
Asia.
</P>
<P>
The meeting will also invite Chen, Legislative Yuan President
Wang Jin-pyng and Minister of Foreign Affairs Tan Sun Chen to speak,
Kau said.
</P>
<P>
Vice President Annette Lu and Premier Frank Hsieh will host
dinners in honor of the participants.
</P>
<P>
The sponsor originally wanted to invite former Japanese prime
ministers Yasuhiro Nakasone and Yashiro Mori to attend the forum to
explore the prospects and strategies of Asian democracy, but because
of their ages and personal itineraries, as well as fear of pressure
from China, they declined to make the trip.

U.N. COMMITMENT TO PEACE, SECURITY QUESTIONABLE: MOFA HEAD
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei, Sept. 14 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Minister of Foreign Affairs Tan Sun Chen
expressed regret Wednesday at Taiwan's 13th consecutive failure in
its bid to enter the United Nations and questioned the U.N.'s
commitment to world peace and security.
</P>
<P>
Two proposals submitted by Republic of China allies supporting
Taiwan's U.N. seat bid failed to be listed for screening by the U.N.
General Committee to decide whether or not they will be put on the
U.N. General Assembly's agenda.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. General Committee rejected the two proposals that the
question of U.N. membership for Taiwan and that peace in the Taiwan
Strait be put on the agenda for the assembly's 60th session, which
opens on Wednesday, after debates between representatives from Gambia
and China and between Chad and Pakistan were conducted.
</P>
<P>
Unlike previous years, Taiwan's diplomatic allies presented two
proposals to the U.N. Secretariat this year -- "that the U.N. play an
active role in ensuring peace in the Taiwan Strait" and that "the
U.N. recognize the Taiwan people's right to representation" -- in the
hope that both proposals would be put on the U.N. agenda.
</P>
<P>
Chen offered his gratitude toward the ROC allies for their
support for Taiwan. The "peace" proposal was submitted by 15 ROC
allies, while the "representation" proposal was submitted by 12.
</P>
<P>
He expressed regret over Taiwan's new setback, pointing out that
the founding of the United Nations in 1945 was a commitment to peace
after years of war, but adding that today's U.N.
has a responsibility to work to prevent the outbreak of military
conflict in every region around the world.
</P>
<P>
Despite the setback, Chen said Taiwan will not be defeated
spiritually and should stick firmly to international mainstream
values and stand on the right side of history.
So long as the people of Taiwan remain resolved in achieving their
goal, they will make it one day, he said, adding that "nothing is
impossible in politics."
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister also pointed out that the Taiwan opposition
leaders' visits to Beijing has been used and quoted by China as
reference in open debates on Taiwan's U.N. bid. This should prompt
the Taiwan public to conduct soul-searching about the entire
situation, he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Vice Foreign Minister Michael Ying-mao Kau lashed out
at the United Nations for its failure to demonstrate international
justice and righteousness.
</P>
<P>
Kau said that as a citizen of Taiwan, he will lodge protests in
the sternest terms against the U.N. for reneging on its founding
spirit of safeguarding world peace and security.
</P>
<P>
Since 1993, Taiwan has tried every year through its diplomatic
allies to have its U.N. membership bid placed on the General
Assembly's agenda. However, it has been unsuccessful due to Beijing's
obstruction.
</P>
<P>
When the United Nations was founded in 1945, the Republic of
China was one of its founding members. However, it has been shut out
of the body since 1971 when U.N. Resolution No. 2758 gave the "China"
seat to the People's Republic of China at the ROC's expense.

<P>
The United States welcomes a visit by
former Republic of China President Lee Teng-hui but has concerns
about the timing of his trip, Vice Foreign Affairs Minister Michael
Ying-mao Kau said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Kau made the remarks in the wake of reports that the United
States has asked Lee to postpone his trip, originally planned for
between late September and early October.
</P>
<P>
Lee is scheduled to visit Los Angeles and to then proceed to
Washington, D.C. and New York. In addition to meeting with Taiwan
expatriates, he is also expected to meet with U.S. political figures,
according to the reports.
</P>
<P>
Kau said that U.S. concerns over Lee's timing because it might
coincide with transit stops by President Chen Shui-bian in the United
States during his upcoming 12-day visit to Central America and the
Caribbean, as well as the United Nations National Assembly meeting
being held in New York.
</P>
<P>
Kau said that although Lee's trip was arranged by Lee's office
and a U.S. governor friendly to Taiwan, according to reports, the
Ministry of Foreign Affairs will provide every necessary assistance
for the former president.
</P>
<P>
He said that Lee's trip is still under discussion with the U.S.
</P>
<P>
Ministry officials said earlier that Lee's travel plans might be
postponed because of the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina.

HSIEH CUT PROPORTION OF GOV'T INVESTMENT IN KAOHSIUNG MRT: SPOKESMAN
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei, Sept. 14 (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Premier Frank Hsieh reduced the proportion
of government investment in the Kaohsiung mass rapid transit
construction project to 83 percent of the total from 89 percent when
he was Kaohsiung mayor, his spokesman said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Cho Jung-tai was responding to former Kaohsiung mayor Wu
Den-yih's accusation that Hsieh, not Wu, decided to construct the MRT
under the "build, operate and transfer" (BOT) model, a decision that
may have contributed to the Aug. 21 riot by Thai construction
workers, which triggered a political storm in Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Wu said Hsieh insisted on using the BOT model to build the city's
MRT system in spite of the Executive Yuan's concern over the
appropriateness of using such a method.
</P>
<P>
Cho said that according to official records, the Executive Yuan
was merely questioning the suitability of the city government's
initial proposal to shoulder 89 percent of the entire project, with
the private sector sharing 11 percent.
</P>
<P>
Hsieh lowered the government's share of the investment to about
83 percent while the private sector's share was raised to a little
over 16 percent, a decision that won Executive Yuan approval on June
4, 1999, Cho pointed out.
</P>
<P>
As to whether Hsieh had favored any private contractors, Cho
claimed that the awarding of contracts was jointly done by the
Kaohsiung City Government and China Steel Corp., whose chairman, Wang
Chung-yu, was also chairman of the Kaohsiung Rapid Transit Corp.
(KRTC), a corporation formed to build and run the MRT.
</P>
<P>
Given this, people should ask Wang if the city government favored
any individual contractors during the bidding process, Cho said.
</P>
<P>
As to why Hsieh hurried to initiate the bidding process just 38
days after he replaced Wu as mayor, Cho said Hsieh was facing time
constraints to make good on his campaign promise that construction of
the MRT would start within two years of his election.
</P>
<P>
In response to opposition parties' claim that the city government
dominated the process of choosing KRTC's key board members, Cho said
the city government had only one seat on the board, which was filled
by a representative of Kaohsiung City Bank, whereas the central
government had two seats, both of which were filled by
representatives from state-run China Steel.
</P>
<P>
"So how could anyone say that the city government had any
decisive power to choose board members?" Cho asked.

Taiwan's state-owned Chinese Petroleum
Corp. (CPC) signed a 25-year contract with Qatar Tuesday to buy
liquefied natural gas (LNG), CPC sources said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
CPC Chairman Kuo Chin-tsai, who is currently visiting the Middle
East, and Yusif Husayn al-Kamal, Qatar minister of finance and
chairman of Ras Laffan Liquefied Natural Gas Company II (RasGas-II) ,
signed the contract in Doha, Qatar. Republic of China representative
to Saudi Arabia Yang Sheng-tsung and ranking officials of RasGas II
were on hand to witness the signing.
</P>
<P>
According to the contract, the CPC will purchase three million
tons of LNG per year starting from 2008 to provide the natural gas to
Tatan Power Plant of the state-owned Taiwan Power Co. and for growing
domestic needs.
</P>
<P>

supply of LNG. The long-term contract with Qatar will help with
"source diversification" and secure a more steady supply of LNG as

NO QUID PRO QUO FOR PREMIER'S RIGHT TO REPORT TO LEGISLATURE: DPP
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Sept. 14 (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The premier has a constitutional right to
deliver an administrative report to the legislature, and the
opposition Kuomintang (KMT) cannot use it as a quid pro quo for
forming five commissions for investigating various incidents of
alleged government misconduct, the Democratic Progressive Party's
(DPP) legislative caucus said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Caucus Secretary-General William C.T. Lai said his caucus will
not oppose the formation of five commissions to investigate the
suspected corruption in the construction projects of Kaohsiung City's
rapid transit system and Taiwan's high-speed railway, the second
phase of the government's financial reform plan, an insider trading
scandal involving a top official charged with preventing insider
trading in the stock market, and the privatization of state-run
Chunghwa Telecom that deliberately violated a resolution passed by
the previous legislature calling on the government to halt the move.
</P>
<P>
Lai said his caucus may go even further to propose forming more
commissions to probe all sorts of corruption scandals over the past
years, government construction projects that ended up lying idle, and
land pollution.
</P>
<P>
Still, he said, it is the premier's constitutional duty to make
his administrative report to the Legislative Yuan. If the KMT keeps
on its "unreasonable" filibuster, it will be shunned by the people, he
warned.
</P>
<P>
Premier Frank Hsieh failed to make his report at the legislature
on the opening day of the new legislative session Tuesday as
lawmakers from the opposition KMT and its "pan-blue alliance" ally,
the People First Party (PFP) , took over the podium, keeping Hsieh
away.
</P>
<P>
KMT Chairman Ma Ying-jeou said this could have been avoided if
the DPP had honored an agreement between the two parties signed by
DPP Policy Committee Executive Director Ko Chien-ming.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, Hsieh was to deliver his report at 3:00 p.m.
Tuesday, but DPP caucus convener Chao Yung-ching insisted that without
his signature, the agreement was invalid. The two-party pact broke
down as a result, according to Ma.
</P>
<P>
He called on the DPP to recall what it had done while it was an
opposition party, and "place itself in the KMT's shoes" while trying
to blame the largest opposition party for causing the legislature to
waste a whole day.
</P>
<P>
The KMT caucus threatened to repeat the "scorched earth" tactics
on Friday and deny Premier Hsieh another chance to make his report if
he does not apologize for the Kaohsiung MRT scandal.
</P>
<P>
Chao said since the investigation of the Kaohsiung MRT incident
was still underway, and who should be responsible has yet to be
determined, how could the KMT demand that Hsieh apologize now?
</P>
<P>
At the legislature, Speaker Wang Jin-pyng will call a
"negotiation session" Thursday in which party caucuses will try to
reach a deal on the five investigative commissions. If all things go
well, Hsieh will be able to step onto the legislative podium and
deliver his report Friday.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, as the Kaohsiung MRT controversy has turned into a
"personal duel" between the two former mayors -- KMT Legislator Wu
Den-yih and Premier Frank Hsieh, the KMT may adopt a two-pronged
strategy of filibustering the legislature and street demonstrations.

<TEXT>
<P>
Naturalization tests for foreigners will
start next year and the test questions and their answers will be
published in late October at the earliest, according to a draft
proposal passed in a meeting of the Ministry of the Interior
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The ministry said that in tune with the revised Nationality Law,
ministry officials passed the draft proposal, ensuring that aliens
applying for naturalization will possess a basic language ability and
a grasp of the rights and obligations of ROC nationals.
</P>
<P>
For this purpose, starting in 2006, aliens can provide
certificates showing that they have taken related courses or that
they have taken part in oral or written tests -- to be held four
times a year.
</P>
<P>
Vice Interior Minister Lin Chung-sheng said that foreigners can
provide certificates showing that they have studied in public or
private schools for more than one year, or have taken part in
government-sponsored or commissioned courses. For most applicants,
they must attend 200 hours of classes; for special applicants
(spouses or step-children) , or those over 65, only 100 hours is
needed.
</P>
<P>
For those who don't want to go to classes, they can take part in
the naturalization tests. The applicants must pay NT$500 (US$22.22)
administrative fees, and can either take written tests or oral tests,
choosing either Mandarin, Hakka, Taiwanese or aboriginal languages
for the tests.
</P>
<P>
Whether oral or written, the 20 questions will be taken from a
200 question bank, ministry officials said, adding that the 200
questions and their answers will be published in late October or
early November. For the average applicant, 70 points will be
considered a passing score, with 60 points for special applicants and
50 points for those over 65.

FM THANKS ALLIES FOR SUPPORTING TAIWAN IN INTER-PARLIAMENTARY UNION
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Sept. 14 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Minister of Foreign Affairs Tan Sun Chen
thanked six ROC allies Wednesday for their support for Taiwan's bid
to enter the Inter-Parliamentary Union (IPU).
</P>
<P>
The minister said speakers from El Salvador, Guatemala, Nauru,
the Marshall Islands, Tuvalu and Saint Christopher and Nevis spoke
out for Taiwan during the Summit of Speakers of Parliament organized
by the IPU in New York Sept. 7-9.
</P>
<P>
The minister quoted Ciro Cruz Zepeda, speaker of El Salvador
parliament, as saying in the summit that the El Salvador parliament
supports any UN efforts to better human rights protection and to
ensure peace around the world, including the peace across the Taiwan
Strait.
</P>
<P>
Jorge Mendez, the speaker of the Guatemala parliament, was
reported as telling the summit that his country has sympathy for the
23 million Taiwan people who are shut out of most international
organizations, not least the United Nations, despite the equality of
man enshrined in the UN charter.
</P>
<P>
Valdon Dowiyogo, speaker of the Nauru parliament, was quoted as
saying at the same occasion that his country believes the world is
dodging its international responsibility by refusing to address
Taiwan people's plight caused by their country's exclusion from most
international organizations.
</P>
<P>
Litokwa Tomeing, speaker of the Marshall Islands, said during the
summit that the IPU should consider Taiwan's application, because
that country's 23 million people's voices should be heard in all
international organizations.
</P>
<P>
Otinielu Tutelemalae Tausi, speaker of the Tuvaru parliament, said
at the summit that Taiwan's remarkable democratic achievements and
its contribution to international development make it a pivotal
partner in the world in wiping out poverty, adding, "We strongly
support the idea of discussing its representation in the United
Nations and the Inter-parliamentary Union."
</P>
<P>
Marcella Liburd, speaker of the parliament of Saint
Christopher and Nevis, said during the summit: "We prodded the
United Nations to take action to ensure the peace across the Taiwan
Strait and to accept Taiwan, the democracy, and its 23 million people
as a member state."
</P>
<P>
Founded in 1889, the IPU is the international organization of
parliaments of sovereign states. Its 2005 Summit of Speakers of
Parliament has brought together 150 speakers of parliaments from
countries around the world.

TAIWAN BIDS TO HOST INTERNATIONAL OLYMPIC COMMITTEE SESSION IN 2009

<TEXT>
<P>
Taipei and the Chinese Taipei Olympic
Committee will bid on behalf of Taiwan to host the 121st
International Olympic Committee (IOC) Session and the 13th Olympic
Congress in 2009, a sport official said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Chu Shou-chien, vice minister of the national council on physical
fitness and sports, said his council is seeking the support of other
countries, including China.
</P>
<P>
Noting that his council as well as the Chinese Taipei Olympic
Committee have good contacts with Chinese sport officials, and have
worked together with them for many sport exchanges, Chu said it is
possible for Taiwan to win Chinese endorsement although only the
support of a majority of IOC members can ensure Taiwan's success.
</P>
<P>
Chu said, however, the support from the United States, Japan and
European states are more important than from China.
</P>
<P>
As the country's supreme sports policymaker, Chu said, his
council is not in a position to bid to host these events, which has
to be done by the Chinese Taipei Olympic Committee.
</P>
<P>
The IOC session is the most important sport gathering in the
world. Would-be host cities have to tender their bids three years in
advance. The 2009 IOC session will choose the host city for the 2016
summer Olympics.

BUSH AGAIN URGES HU TO ENGAGE IN DIALOGUE WITH TAIWAN
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Washington,  Sept.  14  (CNA)
(By Oliver Lin and P.C. Tang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A senior U.S. national security
official said Tuesday that President George W. Bush has again urged
Chinese President Hu Jintao to engage in more dialogue with Taiwan,
including dialogue with the island's duly-elected government.
</P>
<P>
Mike Green, special assistant to the U.S. president for national
security affairs and senior director for Asian affairs, made the
remarks while briefing reporters on the meeting between the two heads
of state held earlier in the day in New York City.
</P>
<P>
This is the second time that the White House has publicly
expressed President Bush's call for dialogue between the Chinese
president and the Taiwan government. Bush made a similar appeal
during a phone conversation with his Chinese counterpart a few months
ago.
</P>
<P>
According to Green, during the meeting in New York, Hu raised
Beijing's concerns about cross-strait issues and Taiwan, while
President Bush, for his part, reiterated the U.S. stance, including
its one China policy, the three communiques, the Taiwan Relations
Act, opposition to unilateral moves by either side to try to change
the status quo, and non-support for Taiwan independence.
</P>
<P>
Hu also explained some of China's moves to reduce tensions in the
Taiwan Strait, while Bush expressed the hope that dialogue between
Taiwan and Beijing could expand to include the government of Taiwan,
Green said.
</P>
<P>
Claiming that he himself does not think anything new regarding
the Taiwan issue came out of the meeting, Green, however, added that:
"This is an important issue for China, it is an important issue for
us, and in almost every bilateral summit between the American and
Chinese leaders, in one way or another, publicly and/or privately,
both sides have to reaffirm where they are."

ROC PRESIDENT CALLS FOR WORLD DEMOCRATIC COMMUNITY
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Sept 15 (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Republic of China President Chen Shui-bian
called on Asia's democracies to join other democratic countries and
form a "world democratic community" that will help open up closed
societies and democratize non-democratic regimes.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the first World Forum for Democratization in Asia
(WFDA) , the president pointed to North Korea, Myanmar and the
People's Republic of China as the "non-democratic regimes" that are
causing "grave hidden concerns" about regional stability.
</P>
<P>
North Korea's nuclear program is threatening Northeast Asian
countries; Myanmar's military junta is causing controversy and
trouble within ASEAN and beyond; and the "clouds of war" created by
China in the Taiwan Strait are not only threatening the democracy
treasured by Taiwan's 23 million people, but also seriously
challenging regional security and order, Chen said.
</P>
<P>
In order to maintain peace and prosperity in Asia, efforts must
be made to promote democratization in all Asian countries and
establish a pan-Asian civil society, he said.
</P>
<P>
Asian democracies should also work with other democracies in
forming a "world democratic community" that will help non-democratic
regimes transform into democracies while consolidating the democratic
institutions of those countries that have achieved democratization,
the president added.
</P>
<P>
He welcomed foreign participants to the forum, saying the fact
that so many foreign friends are willing to share views on the
prospects of democracy in Asia is proof that democracy is a universal
value that goes beyond national boundaries.
</P>
<P>
The gathering shows that democratization is important to peace
and prosperity in Asia; it also indicates that Taiwan's free society
is charming and attractive, the president said.
</P>
<P>
He said Taiwan is the first country in Asia that has set up a
national foundation -- the Taiwan Foundation for Democracy -- because
Taiwan has a special sense of responsibility for and commitment to
Asia's democratization.
</P>
<P>
Chen said that since the end of World War II, many Asian
countries have worked hard to develop their economies over the past
60 years, many of which, including Taiwan, have also established
democracy and the rule of law.
</P>
<P>
If history serves as a guide for the future, Chen said, whether
the Asian economy will continue to develop and whether stability in
this part of the world can be maintained depends on creating a
"democratic Asia."
</P>
<P>
The forum is being sponsored by the Taiwan Foundation for
Democracy, with participants coming from the Alliance for Reform and
Democracy (ARDA), Alternative Asean Network on Burma (ALTSEAN), Forum
Asia Democracy (FAD) , and Initiatives for International Dialogue
(IID).

PRESIDENT NOT SURPRISED BY FILIBUSTER IN LEGISLATURE ON OPENING DAY
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei, Sept. 15 (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President Chen Shui-bian thought there was
"nothing surprising" about the new session of the legislature opening
with opposition lawmakers filibustering, Legislative Yuan speaker
Wang Jin-pyng said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
According to Wang, the president said he was not surprised as he
had seen many similar scenes when his Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) was the opposition.
</P>
<P>
"This is not happening only today, " Wang quoted Chen as saying
in reference to Tuesday's scene in the legislature when opposition
Kuomintang and People First Party lawmakers occupied the podium to
block Premier Frank Hsieh from making his administrative report.
</P>
<P>
Chen told Wang that in a democracy, opposition parties
filibustering in the legislature is something that can happen when a
new session opens, adding that it had happened many times when the
DPP was not in power.
</P>
<P>
Chen and Wang spoke Thursday while attending the World Forum for
Democratization in Asia (WFDA), where Chen delivered a speech calling
on Asia's democratic countries to join hands with other democracies
to form a "world democratic community" to help open up closed
societies and democratize such undemocratic regimes as North Korea,
Myanmar and the People's Republic of China.
</P>
<P>
Wang, who is also chairman of the Taiwan Foundation for Democracy
that sponsored of the WFDA meeting, said he hopes that such meetings
will continue "until the torch of democracy and human rights lights
up all corners of Asia."
</P>
<P>
Wang also said that Taiwan's democratic experience is a useful
reference for other Asian countries as it shows that democratic
values can be applied to all Asian societies that are pursuing rapid
economic growth.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan should share its democratic experience because democratic
institutions serve as a solid foundation for regional peace and
economic prosperity, he said, noting that democratization is closely
linked to peace and security for Asian people.

LAWMAKER TO PROTEST JAPANESE ATROCITIES AGAINST ABORIGINALS AT U.N.
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Sept.  15 (CNA)

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Independent Legislator Kao Chin Su-mei
departed for the United States Thursday at the head of a 60-member
aboriginal group to lodge a protest at the United Nations
headquarters in New York over Japanese atrocities against Taiwan's
aboriginal people during its colonial rule of Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Among the people who saw Kao Chin off at Chiang Kai-shek
International Airport was opposition Kuomintang Chairman and Taipei
Mayor Ma Ying-jeou.
</P>
<P>
Kao Chin said that the Japanese government, instead of showing
remorse for its crimes committed in the past, has tried to destroy
the evidence of its cruelty by altering history textbooks. She added
that she intends to expose the atrocities committed against Taiwan's
aboriginal people at the U.N. headquarters so that all peace- and
human rights-loving people will join in their condemnation of Japan's
actions.
</P>
<P>
Kao Chin, an aboriginal lawmaker and a member of the Non-Partisan
Solidarity Union (NPSU) , is scheduled to appear at the U.N.
headquarters Sept. 23 to highlight Japan's atrocities committed
against Taiwan's indigenous people during its colonial rule of the
island between 1895-1945.
</P>
<P>
She criticized the ruling Democratic Progressive Party for not
forcefully bringing forward the issue of Japan's past atrocities,
saying that she believes that most of the Taiwan people will support
her cause.
</P>
<P>
Influential political figures have begun to show support for her
campaign, Kao Chin pointed out, citing the examples of KMT Chairman
Ma, NPSU Chairman Chang Po-ya, and Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang
Jin-pyng, which she said is a good start.
</P>
<P>
Ma noted that Kao Chin's campaign aims at "returning the identity
and dignity to the aboriginal people, " and that it also makes one
reflect on the social status of the aboriginal people in Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Knowing that the delegation is cash-strapped, Ma presented a red
envelope containing US$3,000 in cash to Kao Chin in the hopes that it
will induce others to make contributions.
</P>
<P>
Independent lawmaker and writer Li Ao has already donated NT$1
million (US$30,760) to the cause.
</P>
<P>
Kao's delegation is scheduled to return to Taiwan Sept. 27.

CLINIC CLOSED FOR 6 MONTHS AFTER WATER-BORN BABY DIES
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  Sept.  15  (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Health authorities in Taipei County
ordered a midwifery clinic in Hsinchuang City Thursday to suspend
operations for six months for improper care of a water-born baby
leading to its death.
</P>
<P>
The owner of Yung Hsin Midwifery Clinic, Tsai Sha-ning, will be
charged with "professional negligence leading to death, " officials
of the county's Bureau of Health said.
</P>
<P>
Official investigations found that the health condition of the
baby boy, born at 4: 45 a.m. on Sept. 8, was initially normal, but
that the baby began to turn pale 15 minutes after birth.
</P>
<P>
Clinic staff continued "monitoring" the baby until 6: 50 a.m., by
which time the baby's skin had turned cold and secretions were
flowing from its nose and mouth. The clinic staff then began first
aid treatment before sending the baby to Taipei Hospital in
Hsinchuang at 7:16 a.m. According to the hospital's records, the baby
was dead on arrival.
</P>
<P>
Officials said that in the two hours of "monitoring" the baby,
clinic staff did not contact a doctor or properly record the baby's
vital signs, even after abnormal signs became apparent.
</P>
<P>
The clinic will be closed from Sept. 19, 2005 to March 18, 2006
for failing to inform medical authorities of the new-born baby's
condition in a timely manner.

TAIWAN WILL JOIN U.N. WHEN TIME IS RIPE: ROC ENVOY TO U.S.
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Washington, Sept. 14 (CNA)
(By J.L.Chi and P.C.Tang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taiwan's top envoy in Washington said 
Wednesday that although the island has again failed in its bid to
become a member of the United Nations, the efforts have grabbed the
attention of the whole world, adding that "time will finally be on
our side."
</P>
<P>
David Lee, Taiwan's representative to the United States, made the
comments after the U.N. General Committee decided in a meeting held
earlier in the day not to put the island's U.N. seat bid on this
year's U.N. General Assembly agenda.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, two proposals presented by Taiwan's
diplomatic allies to the U.N. Secretary calling for the U.N. " to play
an active role in ensuring peace in the Taiwan Strait" and "to
recognize the Taiwan people's right to representation" were rejected
for further discussions at the 60th U.N. General Assembly, which
opens the same day, as the committee members did not reach a
consensus on the matter.
</P>
<P>
This marked Taiwan's 13 consecutive failure since 1993 in its bid
to enter the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Lee said he is still confident that Taiwan will join
the world organization one day, adding that "a long effort and wait
are needed for Taiwan to become a U.N. member. I believe that we will
join the U.N. when time is ripe."

PREMIER WILL EXPLAIN KAOHSIUNG MRT IF ALLOWED TO AT LEGISLATURE
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Sept. 15 (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If the opposition wants to hear the full
story about the government's involvement in the Kaohisung mass rapid
transit system, Premier Frank Hsieh will reveal all at the
legislature -- as long as the opposition does not filibuster,
Executive Yuan spokesman Cho Jung-tai said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Cho made the offer as the Legislative Yuan was scheduled to hold
a plenary meeting Friday, when the premier is supposed to deliver his
administrative report to the floor.
</P>
<P>
But the "pan-blue alliance" of the Kuomintang, the People First
Party and the New Party is still demanding that Hsieh apologize first
and that five commissions be formed to investigate alleged government
corruption before Hsieh gives his report.
</P>
<P>
Hsieh was blocked from approaching the podium Tuesday on the
opening day of the new session as slogan-shouting opposition
lawmakers surrounded it while waving placards and banners, with the
day ending in a political show of farce.
</P>
<P>
Cho said if the same thing happens again Friday, the premier will
use his time at the legislature to execute his official duties as
usual, or read a book.
</P>
<P>
Cho touched on media and public criticism of a "wasted day at the
legislature, " noting that besides the costs to the government,
society's loss of confidence in the future of the country is a cost
even harder to estimate.
</P>
<P>
If opposition lawmakers want to know the whole story about the
Kaohsiung MRT project, let Premier Hsieh make his administrative
report and then ask him questions in the ensuing interpellation
sessions, and he will give open and comprehensive answers, Cho added.
</P>
<P>
If the opposition just demands a "formal apology," what they will
get is nothing but a "forced apology at the behest of exploitation by
the majority," Cho said.
</P>
<P>
He said any questions or suspicions about the Kaohisung MRT
project can be cleared up through debate at the legislature, a task
that the premier sincerely hopes the Legislative Yuan will undertake.

DOONG'S CROSS-STRAIT COMMENTS NOTHING NEW: MAC CHAIRMAN

<TEXT>
<P>
People First Party (PFP) Chairman James
Soong's pronouncement on cross-strait affairs - parroting the format
used by President Chen Shui-bian in his 2000 inaugural address - is
old wine in a new bottle, Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) Chairman
Joseph Wu said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The nation's top China policy planner was referring to Soong's
new "four noes plus one" pronouncement in Shanghai where he is
attending a forum jointly organized by the PFP and the Communist
Party of China (CPC) to discuss trade, economic and "three links"
issues.
</P>
<P>
Soong's new "four noes plus one" refers to no cessation of
"bridge-building" activities between the two sides of the Taiwan
Strait, no loss of focus in promoting a "renaissance of the Chinese
people, " no closing of the door of cross-strait reconciliation, no
wavering on the determination to ensure cross-strait peace, and given
these, there will be "no hesitation and retreat."
</P>
<P>
Asked to comment, Wu said this is a familiar refrain from the
pro-unificationist Soong and he wouldn't say if the statement would
make any difference in the current development of cross-strait
relations.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a forum in Shanghai on Thursday, Soong again promoted
direct cross-strait transportation, saying that it could start with
Taipei and Shanghai on a trial basis.
</P>
<P>
In this way, Shanghai, Taipei and Hong Kong could form a new
"golden economic triangle," and that it will later expand to Shenzhen
and other cities in the mainland.
</P>
<P>
Soong said that cross-strait economic exchanges are important,
and no one can afford to ignore direct cross-strait links, noting
that one of the conclusions he reached with CPC General Secretary Hu
Jintao during their meeting in Beijing in early May was to promote
these links.
</P>
<P>
He said that Shanghai and Taipei are geographically close, and
they also have dense populations and close exchanges. There are more
than 500,000 Taiwanese businessmen in the greater Shanghai area and
they long for the opening of direct transportation as soon as
possible, he said.

CROSS-STRAIT RELIGIOUS EXCHANGES NOT ABOVE THE LAW: MAC
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Sept.  15  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Those from Taiwan wishing to make
religious pilgrimages to China must be aware of the regulations
governing cross-strait exchanges and realize that they are not
exempt, Taiwan's top mainland China policy planner said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Mainland Affairs Council Chairman Joseph Wu said that religious
followers should apply for approval from the government prior to
leaving for China via the "mini three links" route for religious
activities since currently, ordinary people from Taiwan are not
allowed to sail directly across the Strait to the mainland for any
purpose.
</P>
<P>
Wu made the remarks in the eastern city of Ilan, where he was
visiting a detention center exclusively for illegal immigrants from
China.
</P>
<P>
Twenty-one Ilan-based fishing boats, each escorting an icon of
Matsu -- the Chinese goddess of the sea -- departed from Ilan for the
Taiwan-held outlying island of Matsu Sept. 7 for a worshipers'
procession on the sea. The boats instead sailed directly to Meizhou
Island of China's Fujian province on the excuse that a typhoon was
approaching and to repair "mechanical failures" of their boats.
</P>
<P>
The fact of the matter was that these fishing boats had planned
all along to sail directly to Meizhou and were taking the Matsu icons
on a "homecoming" visit, according to Wu. Meizhou is the legendary
home of Matsu -- a young girl who sacrificed herself to save the
lives of her father and older brothers, who were fishermen, and was
later deified -- and thus has been a mecca for Matsu followers for
nearly 1,000 years.
</P>
<P>
The fishing boats are scheduled to return to Ilan on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
According to Wu, agencies have been collecting evidence regarding
the fishing boats and their trip across the Taiwan Strait. It will be
decided later whether the fishermen and boat owners will be
penalized.
</P>
<P>
At present, only residents on Taiwan-held frontline islands of
Kinmen and Matsu or businesspeople with interests in China can use
the direct shipping service between Kinmen/Matsu and China's
Xiamen/Mawei, commonly known as the "mini three links."

SOONG CANNOT USE 'MINI THREE LINKS' TO RETURN TO TAIWAN: REVIEW PANEL
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei, Sept. 15 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A request by opposition People First Party
(PFP) Chairman James Soong and his delegation to return to Taiwan
proper from China via an outlying island has been denied, a review
panel said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The review team, comprised of officials from the Mainland Affairs
Council (MAC). the Ministry of the Interior, and the National Police
Administration, as well as national security officers, turned down in
a meeting Thursday the request of Soong and his delegation to return
to Taiwan proper via the "mini three links" channel, meaning through
the outlying islands of Kinmen or Matsu.
</P>
<P>
Yang Jia-jun, director of the MAC's department of legal affairs,
said that Soong's request does not conform to the existing
regulations regarding travel from China via the "mini three link"
channel.
</P>
<P>
According to information supplied by Soong and his delegation,
none of the members are residents of Kinmen and Matsu, and none of
them have special needs, Yang said, adding that the team therefore
rejected the request.
</P>
<P>
MAC Chairman Joseph Wu earlier explained that current regulations
stipulate that only those who have domiciles registered in Kinmen or
Matsu can shuttle between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait via the
"mini three links."
</P>
<P>
Only in extraordinary circumstances can any others use the links,
such as those with a serious illness or accident victims, during
natural disasters or other emergencies or other major accidents, Wu
said.
</P>
<P>
Wu made the remarks while visiting a detention center Thursday for
illegal mainland Chinese immigrants in Ilan, northern Taiwan, to
learn about their situation.
</P>
<P>
Soong is currently in Shanghai attending a forum jointly
organized by the PFP and the Communist Party of China (CPC) to
discuss trade, economic and "three links" issues. He and his
delegation are scheduled to return to Taiwan Sunday.

ATAYAL PEOPLE TOP ALL ABORIGINAL CIVIL SERVANTS IN NUMBER
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Sept. 15 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Of the roughly 360,000 civil servants in
Taiwan, 6,778 are aborigines, with Atayals topping the list of all
aborigines serving in public offices, the Ministry of Civil Service
reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
A total of 1,877 Atayals, originating from the Central Mountain
Range -- the geological backbone of Taiwan -- have served as civil
servants as of the end of June this year, making them the largest
aboriginal group of government employees (excluding teachers and
cleaners).
</P>
<P>
Atayals were followed by the Paiwan people, originating from
mountains in southern Taiwan, with 1,535 serving as civil servants,
and the Amis, originating from the eastern coastal area of Hualien,
with 1,400, officials from the Ministry of Civil Service said.
</P>
<P>
The 6,778 aboriginal civil servants constituted a mere 1.48
percent of the entire population of Taiwan's indigenous people,
numbering roughly 460,000, the officials quoted their latest
statistics as indicating.
</P>
<P>

OPPOSITION LEADERS OWE NATION AN APOLOGY: DPP
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Sept.  15 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The legislative caucus of the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) urged two opposition heavyweights
Thursday to apologize to the public because their China trips earlier
this year have been used by Beijing as an excuse to block the United
Nations from addressing Taiwan's U.N. bid.
</P>
<P>
"Former Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Lien Chan and People First
Party (PFP) Chairman James Soong owe the public an apology because
Beijing officials have used their China trips as justification to
dissuade the U.N. General Committee from putting Taiwan's U.N. bid on
this year's General Assembly agenda, " said William Lai, a DPP
legislative whip.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. General Committee debated Tuesday whether to include two
proposals presented by Taiwan's diplomatic allies regarding Taiwan's
representation in the United Nations and U.N. attention to the Taiwan
Strait tension. In the debate, China's representative cited Lien's
and Soong's separate visits to China between late April and early
May to claim that the cross-strait situation is not strained and that
the U.N. need not address the two proposals at its ongoing General
Assembly plenary session.
</P>
<P>
Lai said the visits have confused the world about the real
cross-strait situation, particularly China's mounting military threat
to Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Far from helping boost cross-strait peace, Lai claimed that
Lien's and Soong's China trips have become a new excuse for China to
obstruct Taiwan's U.N. bid.
</P>
<P>
"They should make a public apology for such a regrettable
development," Lai said.
</P>
<P>
Since 1993, Taiwan has tried every year through its diplomatic
allies to have its U.N. membership bid placed on the General
Assembly's agenda. However, it has been unsuccessful due to Beijing's
obstruction.
</P>
<P>
When the United Nations was founded in 1945, the Republic of
China was one of its founding members. However, it has been shut out
of the body since 1971 when U.N. Resolution No. 2758 gave the "China"
seat to the People's Republic of China at the ROC's expense.

TAIWAN WELCOMES INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY TO DISCUSS TAIWAN ISSUE
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Sept.  15 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The government would welcome the Taiwan
issue to be put on the international stage for discussion because it
is a question that deserves attention, a spokesman of the Executive
Yuan said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Cho Jung-tai made the remarks after a meeting between Chinese
President Hu Jintao and U.S. President George W. Bush on the
sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly in New York Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
On Hu's expressed hope during the meeting that the U.S. will join
China in safeguarding peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait,
Cho said that Hu's remarks indicate that he is thinking of his own
interests, but Taiwan hopes that the U.S. will stand on the side of
"justice, peace, democracy and freedom."
</P>
<P>
Cho also noted that Bush again urged Hu to engage in dialogue
with President Chen Shui-bian. Only through dialogue with the duly
elected president of Taiwan can regional peace and stability be
helped, Cho added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, an official of the opposition Kuomintang deplored
that Taiwan has been further marginalized by the meeting between Hu
and Bush.
</P>
<P>
Chang Jung-kung, vice executive director of the KMT's Policy
Committee and director of the party's Department of Chinese Affairs,
claimed that the government is incapable and has no intention of
breaking the cross-strait stalemate, and that Taiwan's situation will
become more deplorable in view of the political transaction between
China and the U.S., since the two powers share many interests.
</P>
<P>
Chang also claimed that Beijing has recently developed a
mechanism with the U.S. to prevent Taiwan from moving toward
independence and triggering a cross-strait crisis, citing as examples
U.S. President George W. Bush's use of an unusually stern warning to
Taiwan regarding its referendum plan during talks with Chinese
Premier Wen Jiabao at the White House in December 2003, as well as
China's enactment of its Anti-Session Law early this year.
</P>
<P>
Chang said that although Bush was "unprepared" and did not answer
specifically in response to Hu's hope that the U.S. will join China
in safeguarding peace in the Taiwan Strait, the U.S. "could not
possibly" turn down a request from China to discuss the Taiwan issue.

NEW TAIWAN U.N. BID STRATEGY DRAWS INTERNATIONAL ATTENTION: PRESIDENT
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Sept.  15 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President Chen Shui-bian said Thursday
that Taiwan's new strategy adopted in this year's bid to enter the
United Nations has drawn more international attention and discussions
than before.
</P>
<P>
Although Taiwan failed for the 13th straight year in its bid to
have its U.N. membership discussed as a result of Beijing's
obstruction, this year's new approach of presenting two proposals at
the U.N. General Committee during an agenda screening process proved
to be a more stimulating strategy in calling for world attention to
Taiwan's resolve to pursue peace and to security concerns in the
Taiwan Strait, he claimed.
</P>
<P>
It was the first time since 1993 that Taiwan had brought a second
proposal to the U.N. -- calling for the U.N. to play a pro-active role
in maintaining peace across the Taiwan Strait.
</P>
<P>
The first proposal was very similar to those put forward in the
past -- urging the U.N. General Assembly to ensure the representation
of the 23 million people of Taiwan in the world body.
</P>
<P>
Chen made the remarks during a cocktail party held in Taipei to
mark the 184th anniversary of Central American Independence.
</P>
<P>
The president offered his sincerest gratitude to the Republic of
China's diplomatic allies in Central America for their long-term
support for Taiwan and he also called for all the allies in that part
of the world to continue supporting Taiwan in a common ideal of a
"world democratic community."
</P>
<P>
Chen also told those at the party that he will attend in person
the fifth leadership summit of Taiwan, Central American countries and
the Dominican Republic scheduled to be held in Nicaragua Sept. 25.
</P>
<P>
Chen said that during that 12-day trip, his fifth to Central
America, he will also visit four other allies -- Guatemala, the
Dominican Republic, Saint Christopher and Nevis, and Saint Vincent
and the Grenadines.

PRESIDENT: FINANCIAL REFORMS WILL CONTINUE
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Sept.  15 (CNA)
(By Han Nai-kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President Chen Shui-bian said Thursday
that the second phase of the government's financial reform plan will
continue, despite temporary setbacks.
</P>
<P>
He said the government will not flinch in its efforts to halve
the number of state-owned banks to six through mergers by the end of
this year, although he admitted that the state-run Taiwan Business
Bank has experienced some difficulties in finding a bidder.
</P>
<P>
The president was referring to the failure of the Ministry of
Finance to select a satisfactory top bidder for Taiwan Business Bank
in an auction process set for the weekend.
</P>
<P>
The bank is the fourth state-owned bank on the list to be
auctioned off. Three others have been merged with private banks in an
attempt to raise their competitiveness. A four-day strike by
thousands of bank employees against the merger is believed to be the
main factor behind the failure.
</P>
<P>
Chen said the government's experience in the first phase of the
reform plan -- liberalization of the financial market -- is proof
that financial reform is the correct path for Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
He added that the sooner the goal is achieved, the smaller the
price the country will have to pay.
</P>
<P>
Noting that even China is reforming its state-run banks, Chen
said Taiwan should waste no time in carrying out the second phase of
financial reforms.
</P>
<P>
More than 90 opposition legislators have sponsored a motion
calling on the Ministry of Finance to halt the auction, but ministry
officials have indicated that the plan is unlikely to be stopped at
this stage.

OVERSEAS TRAVEL BUDGET APPROPRIATED IN LINE WITH LAW: CABINET
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Sept.  15 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Budgets for all government officials'
overseas trips have been planned in exact accordance with the
regulations, including transport and daily living expenses, Cabinet
spokesman Cho Jung-tai said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Cho was responding to a claim by opposition lawmakers that
government agencies have set aside too much money in the 2006 budget
plan to finance what they described as officials' "lavish overseas
trips."
</P>
<P>
"The accusation is unfair and incorrect. All the appropriations
for overseas visits by public functionaries for official purposes
have been budgeted strictly in accordance with relevant regulations,"
Cho said.
</P>
<P>
According to Cho, the regulations set clear provisions regarding
government employees' overseas travel expenses.
</P>
<P>
"We have unified payment standards regarding transport,
accommodation and living expenses," Cho added.
</P>
<P>
On the opposition allegation that the Ministry of Finance is most
extravagant in overseas travel spending, Cho said the planned trips
by Finance Ministry officials to the United States and Europe next
year as listed in the government's 2006 budget bill are aimed at
attracting foreign financial institutions to invest in Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
"The budget listed in the bill includes money needed for renting
large conference rooms and equipment for presentations, as well as
transport and living costs," Cho explained.
</P>
<P>
As to the Government Information Office's travel budget, Cho said
the appropriations will finance official visits to France and Italy
to attend the world famous Cannes and Venice film festivals.
</P>
<P>
Cho also explained why the Ministry of Justice has not stated the
destination where local prosecutors will visit next year to take part
in an international prosecutors conference. The annual meeting is
held in a different country each year and the destination for the
2006 meeting has yet to be announced, he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Touching on a Ministry of Economic Affairs plan to send officials
to visit China next year to look into its intellectual property
rights (IPR) protection system, Cho said four ministry officials are
scheduled to travel to China in two groups to attend IPR seminars to
be co-organized by Taiwan and Chinese industrial associations.
</P>
<P>
"Given the ever-closing trade and economic exchanges across the
Taiwan Strait, it is necessary for the Economics Ministry to gain a
better understanding of China's IPR protection system and its
administrative measures in the event of IPR infringements or
commercial piracy," Cho added.

CHINA INVITING U.S. TO SAFEGUARD STABILITY `RIDICULOUSLY FUNNY': DPP
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Sept.  15 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It is "ridiculously funny" that Chinese
President Hu Jintao asked the United States to join China in
safeguarding peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait, ruling
Democratic Progressive (DPP) Party Secretary-General Lee Yi-yang said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Hu was quoted as having said to U.S. President George W. Bush
during ameeting in New York Tuesday that "proper handling" of the
issue of Taiwan is crucial to the future of Sino-U.S. relations,
adding that "I hope that the United States will join the Chinese side
in safeguarding peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait and
opposing so-called Taiwan independence."
</P>
<P>
Hu's invitation to Bush to jointly safeguard cross-strait peace
and stability is tantamount to a bandit inviting a police officer to
jointly maintain public order, Lee ridiculed.
</P>
<P>
Calling China a "predator" rather than a "victim, " Lee pointed
out that China is the major threat to peace and stability, not only
across the Taiwan Strait, but also in East Asia.
</P>
<P>
Hu's remarks to Bush were meant to make China seem like a
"victim" -- an attempt aimed at misleading international opinion and
making Taiwan a culprit responsible for cross-strait uncertainties,
Lee added.
</P>
<P>
He quoted U.S. Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld as having said
recently that although no countries in the world pose any threat to
China, the country has constantly bolstered its military build-up.
Thus, Lee said, the source of threats to the security of the
Asian-Pacific region is China and its intention of building itself
into a new military hegemony in the region.
</P>
<P>
Lee said it is an easy task for both sides to defuse the
cross-strait tension so long as China dismantles its 700-strong
missiles targeting Taiwan, stops military expansion that is
threatening neighboring countries, and reduces its annual defense
budget, which he said is the largest of its kind anywhere in the
world.
</P>
<P>
He called for China to resume dialogue with Taiwan and sign a
peace accord under an international framework of reconciliation. If
were to happen, he added, it would be unnecessary for Hu to invite
the U.S. to jointly safeguard cross-strait peace and stability.

<P>
Premier Frank Hsieh and senior economics
and finance officials will join representatives of Taiwan's small-
and medium-sized businesses for regular meetings from Sept. 19,
National Association of Small- and Medium-Sized Enterprises Chairman
Day Sheng-tong said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Day, who is also an adviser to President Chen Shui-bian, said the
meetings "over afternoon tea" with the premier once every three
months will provide an opportunity for business and industry leaders
to let government officials understand their needs through
face-to-face discussion.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that Taiwan has 1.17 million small- and
medium-sized enterprises, accounting for 98 percent of Taiwan's
businesses. Together they provide 7.5 million jobs.
</P>
<P>
The meetings will be sponsored jointly by the National
Association of Small- and Medium-Sized Enterprises and the Taiwan
Federation of Industry (TFI) in an attempt to set up a mechanism for
communication with the government and create a favorable environment
for the development of such businesses, according to a spokesman for
the TFI.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the premier, government officials expected to
attend the meetings will include Economics Minister Ho Mei-yueh,
Finance Minister Lin Chuan, Council of Labor Affairs head Lee
Ying-yuan and Central Bank of China Governor Perng Fai-nan.

CENTRAL BANK RAISES KEY RATES TO FEND OFF INFLATION
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei, Sept 15 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taiwan's Central Bank of China (CBC) raised
its key interest rates by 0.125 percentage points Thursday with a
view to fending off inflation.
</P>
<P>
From Friday, the discount rate will be raised to 2.125 percent
from the current 2 percent, CBC Governor Perng Fai-nan announced
after a bank board meeting.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the accommodations with collateral rate will
rise to 2.50 percent from 2.375 percent, while the accommodations
without collateral rate will rise to 4.375 percent from 4.25 percent.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the central bank's main mission is to maintain
stability in consumer prices and to drive the economy towards growth,
Perng said the CBC must adjust its key lending rates in a gradual
manner.
</P>
<P>
It will be the third CBC key rates hike so far this year and the
fifth round of hikes since September 2004, bringing the cumulative
increase in CBC key lending rates since September 2004 to 0.75
percentage points.
</P>
<P>
The mild increase in interest rates this time is expected to lead
to only limited rises in corporate funding costs, Perng said.
</P>
<P>
"These rate hikes should not affect domestic economic growth as
there are sufficient bank funds to meet demand from enterprises, " he
said.
</P>
<P>
Hu Sheng-cheng, chairman of the Council for Economic Planning and
Development, echoed Perng's view, saying that the moderate hikes
can help minimize the impact on the domestic economic growth.
</P>
<P>
According to Hu, the domestic inflation rate is not very serious.
The consumer price index, the key gauge of inflation, registered an
annual growth rate of 3.56 percent in August, Hu said, adding that
this mainly resulted from rises in vegetable and fruit prices due to
typhoon damage.
</P>
<P>
Stressing that the average increase in prices of core commodities
was only about 0.7 percent, Hu said inflationary pressure has been
kept at bay.

<P>
Premier Frank Hsieh said Thursday it is
"irrational" for opposition lawmakers to ask him to apologize for
alleged Kaohsiung mass rapid transit (MRT) system construction
scandals as a condition for him to deliver an administrative report.
</P>
<P>
Hsieh made the remarks while attending an evening party in the
central county of Taichung to celebrate the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party's upcoming founding anniversary.
</P>
<P>
"Addressing the legislature on the government's policy goals and
work plans is the premier's official duty and his obligation to the
public set forth in the Constitution. This sacred mission cannot be
traded off and no political strings should be attached to it, " Hsieh
said.
</P>
<P>
Hsieh was originally scheduled to address the Legislative Yuan's
opening session Tuesday and then field questions from lawmakers of
all political stripes. However, lawmakers from the main opposition
Kuomintang occupied the podium at the legislature for the entire
session to prevent Premier Frank Hsieh from delivering an
administrative report. They demanded that Hsieh take a leave of
absence as they claimed Hsieh was responsible for the Kaohsiung MRT
construction scandals. Hsieh was Kaohsiung mayor for six years until
February, when he became premier.
</P>
<P>
Because of KMT lawmakers' boycott, Hsieh and his entire Cabinet
ended up sitting all day in the legislature watching the "circus."
</P>
<P>
It remains unclear whether the KMT lawmakers will continue to
block Hsieh from delivering his administrative report during the
legislative plenary session Friday.

U.S. HOUSE PASSES RESOLUTION WELCOMING PRESIDENT CHEN'S STOPOVER
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Washington, D.C. Sept. 15 (CNA)
(By Oliver Lin and P.C.Tang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The U.S. House of Representatives
passed a resolution Thursday welcoming President Chen Shui-bian of
Taiwan to the United States for a transit stop ahead of his visit to
the island's diplomatic allies in Central America.
</P>
<P>
The resolution, which was jointly introduced Sept. 8 by four
co-chairmen of the Taiwan Caucus in the House of Representatives,
including Reps. Steve Chabot, Sherrod Brown, Dana Rohrabacher and
Robert Wexler, was first adopted by the House's Committee on
International Relations earlier in the day.
</P>
<P>
Besides offering its "warmest welcome" to President Chen
Shui-bian upon his visit to the United States, the House of
Representatives also recognizes in the resolution that the
president's upcoming visit is "a significant stop toward broadening
and deepening the friendship and cooperation between the United
States and Taiwan."
</P>
<P>
The House also recognizes in the resolution the president's
commitment and efforts to maintain peace and stability in the Taiwan
Strait as well as thanks the Taiwan government and its people for
their contribution to relief efforts in the devastated areas stricken
by Hurricane Katrina.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, it also asks President Chen to convey the U.S.
Congress and the American people's support to the people of Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
The House also congratulates the president on receiving the Human
Rights Award from the Congressional Human Rights Caucus.
</P>
<P>
It is expected that Chen will receive the award during his
transit stop in Miami next week.
</P>
<P>
According to Taiwan's Representative Office in the United States,
the passage of the resolution not only reiterates the U.S. Congress'
support and friendship for Taiwan, it also demonstrates its respect
for President Chen Shui-bian.
</P>
<P>
Chen is scheduled to make a transit stop in Miami en route to
Central America next week and a stopover in San Francisco on his way
back to Taiwan. The main purpose of the president's upcoming trip is
to attend the fifth ROC-Central American Summit slated to be held in
Nicaragua at the end of this month.

STALLED ARMS BILL A MATTER OF CONCERN TO U.S.: STATE DEP'T ADVISER
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Washington,  D.C.  Sept.  16 (CNA)
(By Oliver Lin and P.C.Tang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A senior adviser to the U.S.
State Department's Bureau of East Asian and Pacific Affairs recently
reiterated Washington's serious concern over the long-stalled arms
procurement bill in Taiwan's Legislative Yuan and the minimal
increase in the island's defense budget over the past few years.
</P>
<P>
James Keyth made the reiteration after attending a hearing held
by the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission under the
U.S. Congress Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Talking about issues related to Taiwan's arms procurement bill,
the adviser said that the island should take actions to deal with the
bill as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
Keyth noted that the United States is growing increasingly
concerned about Taiwan's insufficient investment in the purchase of
advanced military equipment, including weapons and
command-and-monitoring systems, which he said will affect the
island's defensive and deterrence capabilities.
</P>
<P>
According to Keyth, Taiwan's spending on national defense has
only increased slightly over the past few years, while spending on
the economy and social welfare has registered double-digit growth
during the same period.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, on former President Lee Teng-hui's reported upcoming
visit to the United States, Keyth defined it as a private visit,
pointing out that anything Lee might say while in the United States
will represent his own opinion and not the policy of the government
of Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Asked whether U.S. lawmakers can present the Congressional Human
Rights Award to President Chen Shui-bian in a public ceremony during
his scheduled upcoming transit stop in Miami, Keyth said that there
are norms and rules to regulate Taiwan leader's transit stops in the
United States and that these rules remain unchanged.
</P>
<P>
Chen is set to make a stopover in Miami next week ahead of his
visit to Taiwan's diplomatic allies in Central America. While in the
city, Chen will receive the human rights award from the U.S.
Congressional Human Rights Caucus.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the lack of dialogue between the governments of the
two sides of the Taiwan Strait, Keyth said that U.S. President George
W. Bush had expressed the hope during his recent meeting with Chinese
President Hu Jintao in New York that Beijing would engage in dialogue
with the Taiwan government.

2005 TAIWAN-JAPAN SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY FORUM OPENS IN TAIPEI
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Sept. 16 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Despite the absence of formal diplomastic
relations, Japan and Taiwan have maintained ever-increasing political
and economic ties through close science and technology exchanges,
Japan's top liaison officer in Taiwan said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Tadashi Ikeda, representative of the Interchange Association
Taipei Office, said that it is important for the two countries to
reinforce each other with knowledge to boost their creativity and
international competitiveness.
</P>
<P>
Ikeda borrowed the 3R (reduce, reuse, recycle) concept that Japan
advocated during the G8 Summit in Scotland in July in addressing the
opening of the 2005 Taiwan-Japan Science and Technology Forum, whose
theme is environmental protection technology and green products. The
opening was held at the Grand Hyatt in Taipei.
</P>
<P>
Ikeda expressed the hope that the 3R concept will be discussed at
the forum and consequently help boost exchanges between Japan and
Taiwan in both the science and technology and business sectors.
</P>
<P>
He said that Taiwan and Japan share many similarities, including
that both lack natural resources and both are prominent economic
powers as a result of their high-caliber workforces, excellent
economic planning and government support, and the research and hard
work of their academic institutions and official agencies.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan, in particular, is indispensable for Japan in terms of
strengthening bilateral exchanges because of its strong and immense
technological prowess and market demand, Ikeda added.
</P>
<P>
Vincent Siew, former Republic of China premier and current
chairman of the Taiwan-Japan Science and Technology Interchange
Committee, which is sponsoring the forum, said that the gathering
will contribute to a further understanding of related policies and
strategies.
</P>
<P>
Siew said he hopes that through such science and technology
forums, waste resulting from duplicate research will be reduced, and
the two countries will sharpen their international competitiveness
and achieve high economic growth rates, producing a "win win" result.
</P>
<P>
The 2005 Taiwan-Japan Science and Technology Forum, the third of
its kind since 2003, has brought together some 400 leaders from the
research, corporate and public-policy fields from the two countries
to exchange views on environmental protection efforts and related
policies and products.
</P>
<P>
Prominent figures scheduled to make keynote speeches at the forum
include Kenichi Mizuno, a veteran Liberal Democratic Party legislator
recently re-elected for a fourth straight term, who will speak on
Japan's environmental protection policies; and Akio Morishima,
chairman of the Institute for Global Environmental Strategies in
Japan, who will speak on how to build up the environmental protection
industry and businesses.

CHINA'S RISE HAS NEGATIVE IMPACT ON ASIAN DEMOCRATIZATION: KAU
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei, Sept. 16 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The rise of China as a big power has been
more negative than positive in terms of its impact on the
democratization of Asia, Vice Foreign Affairs Minister Michael
Ying-mao Kau said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Kau was addressing the topic of the impact of a rising China on
democratization in Asia in a meeting of the World Forum for
Democratization in Asia (WFDA) on the second day of the three-day
forum at the Taipei International Convention Center. The forum is
being sponsored by the Taiwan Foundation for Democracy (TFD).
</P>
<P>
Kau noted that the international community has centered its
attention on the economic expansion and military modernization of
China, but it has ignored the impact of a rising China on such
universal values as democracy and human rights.
</P>
<P>
It is hoped that the forum will provide a more balanced
discussion and examination of the topic, Kau said.
</P>
<P>
Parris Chang, vice secretary-general of the National Security
Council, noted that China began to move toward economic opening in
the 1980s but that it has maintained a tight control politically,
which he said is "not correct and deplorable."
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that a rising China will have a negative impact on
the democratization of Asia as its political and economic strength
will affect neighboring countries.
</P>
<P>
In addition, China has supported many undemocratic regimes such
as Myammar and Cambodia, Chang said, adding that the international
community should not only look at China's economic and military
strength, but should also think seriously about a strategy to promote
democratization in those non-democratic countries.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on the same occasion, David S. Hong, president of the
Taiwan Institute of Economic Research, said that although China has
achieved stunning economic growth, it has many hidden problems,
adding that "a short-term brilliant performance will not solve
long-term problems, " including a widening gap between rich and poor
and between urban and rural communities, as well as a worsening
environment.
</P>
<P>
Even if social and political structures are undergoing changes,
they have not helped expedite democratic progress, Hong said.
</P>
<P>
Herman Kraft, a researcher at the Institute of Strategic and
Development Studies of the Philippines, said that Taiwan will bear
the brunt of a rising China and that the island should realize that
disputes between the two sides of the Taiwan Strati could spill over
to other countries in East Asia.
</P>
<P>
Kraft noted that many newly democratic countries in Asia have a
fragile democratic basis and that the military buildup between the
two sides of the Taiwan Strait could easily affect the democratic
progress of these countries.
</P>
<P>
Srikanth Kondapalli, a research fellow at the Institute for
Defence Studies &amp; Analyses in India, said that rapid economic growth
in China has produced a powerful magnetic effect in the region.
</P>
<P>
China's military modernization also threatens Japan and Taiwan,
and it has indirectly impacted the regional balance of power and
multilateral foreign policy, leading the countries in the region to
rely too heavily on China and to have their democratic development
influenced by China.

PUBLIC PLAY LEADING ROLE IN TAIWAN: PRESIDENT
</HEADLINE>

Taipei, Sept. 16 (CNA)

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President Chen Shui-bian claimed Friday
that "the people of Taiwan, rather than the president" play the
leading role in a new book published by the Presidential Office that
recounts major domestic and diplomatic events over the past two
years.
</P>
<P>
The book, titled "Maritime, Progressing Taiwan" is the second
book with photos and caption literature recording Chen's work
published in the last two years. The first was published in August
2003.
</P>
<P>
According to Chen in a ceremony held at his office to mark the
launch of the book, the people recorded in the book are "ordinary"
people. They are, however, representative of Taiwan, a country of
hard-working people with strong, die-hard vitality.
</P>
<P>
Chen said that he has traveled to 319 cities and rural townships
around the country over the past five years, including remote areas
such as the Tungsha (Pratas) islands, the island of Pengchiayu and
the frontline island of Matsu, to listen to the voices from the
grassroots.
</P>
<P>
Currently, Chen said, his greatest wish in similar efforts is to
visit Taiping island, the largest coral reef in the Nansha (Spratly)
island archipelago in the South China Sea, located about 1,600 km
from Taiwan and the southernmost tip of Republic of China territory.
</P>
<P>
Prominent photos contained in the book feature: Chen attending
Pope John Paul II's memorial service in the Vatican; Chen playing
soccer in the Republic of China diplomatic ally of Belize; Chen
visiting the Tungsha islands to inspect a coral conservation effort;
Chen collecting empty bottles and cans as an environmental protection
volunteer; and members of the first family taking part in the March
26, 2005 rally opposing Beijing's passage of its Anti-Secession Law
codifying China's longstanding threat to attack Taiwan if it thinks
Taiwan is seeking formal independence.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Presidential Office also launched Friday another
book recounting Chen's overseas trips, the sixth of its kind
published since 2000.

TAIWAN-U.S. TIES IN GOOD SHAPE: VICE MINISTER

<TEXT>
<P>
Relations between Taiwan and the United
States are in good shape because the two countries share strategic
interests, Vice Foreign Affairs Minister Michael Ying-mao Kau said
Friday.
</P>
<P>
Kau was responding to a press inquiry about his view on Chinese
President Hu Jintao's latest proposal that the United States join
China in safeguarding peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait.
Hu came up with the proposal during a meeting with U.S. President
George W. Bush on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly in New
York Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"Hu's proposal was obviously an international 'united front'
trick, " Kau said, adding that he does not think the United States
will be duped into cooperating with China at Taiwan's expense.
</P>
<P>
In his view, Kau said, China came up with the proposal partly
because the United States and Japan for the first time publicly
announced in February that "maintaining peace and stability in the
Taiwan Strait" is one of their common strategic objectives.
</P>
<P>
"As a big power, China is certainly a target that the United
States would woo to be a cooperative partner. Nevertheless, I don't
think that the United States would likely sacrifice Taiwan's
interests simply to cooperate with China," Kau said.
</P>
<P>
He acknowledged that Taiwan and the United States have had rifts
at times, but once the controversies were over, their common
strategic interests remained consistent. At the moment, Kau said,
Taiwan-U.S. relations are steady and smooth.

Taipei, Sept. 16 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Cabinet-level Mainland Affairs Council
(MAC) denied Friday reports that negotiations on charter cargo and
passenger flights between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait have
come to fruition.
</P>
<P>
The reports are untrue, the MAC said in a press release.
</P>
<P>
According to the reports, Michael Lo, former head of the Taipei
Airline Association (TAA) , traveled to Hong Kong several times to
negotiate with Chinese representatives on the charter cargo and
passenger flights, and that the government will soon announce their
launch.
</P>
<P>
Cross-strait charter cargo flights will be launched first and
three months later, the charter passenger flights will start, the
reports claimed.
</P>
<P>
The MAC reaffirmed that it has commissioned the TAA to help the
communications between the two sides on the matter and has taken into
consideration China's stance, as well as the positive exchanges
between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
Since the announcement by Premier Frank Hsieh Aug. 3 that
discussions on both charter cargo and passenger flights can be
conducted simultaneously, Taiwan has been communicating with China,
the press release said.
</P>
<P>
The MAC stressed that if there are any substantive results from
bilateral talks, it will inform the public immediately and it urged
the media not to print mere speculation as real news.

SUPREME COURT REJECTS KMT-PFP APPEAL TO NULLIFY 2004 ELECTION
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Sept.  16 (CNA)

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Supreme Court of Taiwan rejected
Friday an appeal by the two main opposition parties -- the Kuomintang
(KMT) and the People First Party (PFP) -- seeking to have the 2004
presidential election declared null and void on the grounds of
suspected fraud and deceit.
</P>
<P>
President Chen Shui-bian and Vice President Annette Lu of the
ruling Democratic Progressive Party won the election March 20 last
year by a slight margin.
</P>
<P>
The KMT and the PFP, known as the "pan-blue alliance," claimed
that the election was affected by many dubious factors, including
unclear motives behind the shooting that wounded Chen and Lu on the
eve of the election and possible interference by a referendum held
alongside the election.
</P>
<P>
The case was one of two lawsuits filed by former KMT Chairman
Lien Chan and PFP Chairman James Soong in an attempt to reverse the
election results. The other suit seeking a court ruling to declare
Chen's election invalid was rejected by the Supreme Court June 17.
Both cases are now closed, as the rulings are final.
</P>
<P>

MPA APPRECIATES TAIWAN'S HELP IN ROOTING OUT PIRACY
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Sept.  16 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Los Angeles-based Motion Picture
Association (MPA) offered its appreciation Friday to the Taiwan
authorities for their help in cracking down on movie piracy in
Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference held jointly with Taiwan's private
Foundation for the Protection of Film and Video Works (FVWP) in
Taipei, Frank Rittman, vice president of the MPA Asia-Pacific
operations based in Singapore, said the MPA appreciates Taiwan's
assistance and support for anti-piracy enforcement initiatives aimed
at reducing movie piracy in Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
However, he pointed out that it is worthy of close attention that
an increasing number of people and companies in Taiwan have burned
pirated movies onto optical discs with CD-R or DVD-R burners.
</P>
<P>
Burner labs can contain dozens of burners capable of producing
millions of pirated CD-Rs or DVD-Rs per year, Rittman said, adding
that in 2004, 1,755 optical disc burners were seized in FVWP/MPA
operations in Taiwan, representing 56 percent of total MPA seizures
in the Asia-Pacific region.
</P>
<P>
Rittman did not elaborate on development of FVWP/MPA operations
in China, considered a haven for piracy of all intellectual property
goods.
</P>
<P>
At the press conference, FVWP and MPA officials released updated
results of anti-piracy enforcement operations coordinated with the
Intellectual Property Office under the Ministry of Economic Affairs
targeting video rental shops in Taiwan that illegally manufacture and
rent pirated movies.
</P>
<P>
The operations, which began Jan. 4, comprised 818 shop
inspections and 34 raids and have netted seizures of 243,475 pirated
CD-Rs and DVD-Rs, 127 optical disc burners and have resulted in the
arrest of 48 people, according to MPA officials.
</P>
<P>
The program builds upon recent undertakings by Taiwan's
Government Information Office and the Intellectual Property Office to
ensure that shops in Taiwan are not engaged in piracy.
</P>
<P>
Since last December, the Intellectual Property Office has urged
rental shop owners to respect copyrights and refrain from selling or
renting pirated copies, said Hank Kuo, executive director of the
FVWP.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated that anti-piracy operations will go on
relentlessly.

VICE INTERIOR MINISTER VISITS VOCATIONAL TRAINING CENTER IN L.A.

<P>
Republic of China Vice Interior
Minister Chang Wen-ying visited the Lincoln Training Center in Los
Angeles for the mentally and physically challenged Thursday in an
effort to learn from the facility about ways to equip disabled people
with vocational skills.
</P>
<P>
Chang was on a transit stop on her way home after concluding a
visit to Panama Sept. 9-13 where she attended a Latin American
conference on human rights for the mentally and physically challenged
on behalf of first lady Wu Shu-jen.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan has spared no efforts to take care of the mentally and
physically challenged in recent years, she said. There is an official
fund in Taiwan used to finance vocational training for such people,
and that the funds mainly come from local government agencies or
private companies which fail to hire so many mentally and physically
challenged people as the law demands, Chang indicated.
</P>
<P>
The non-profit Lincoln Training Center, located in El Monte City
in suburban Los Angeles, was founded by a group of family members of
challenged people some 10 years ago. Thanks to efficient management,
it trained over 400 mentally and physically challenged people each
year.
</P>
<P>
Chang is scheduled to return to Taipei Sept. 17.

DPP, KMT BLAME EACH OTHER FOR KAOHSIUNG MRT SCANDAL
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Sept.  16 (CNA)
(By Han Nai-kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The ruling Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) and the opposition Kuomintang (KMT) continued to trade
accusations Friday over the scandal involving the Kaohsiung rapid
transit railway construction project exposed by the Aug. 21 riot by
Thai laborers.
</P>
<P>
The Legislative Yuan spent another unproductive day, with its
scheduled proceedings blocked as members of the legislative caucuses
of both parties took turn at the rostrum to blame each other for the
scandal, which has dented Taiwan's global image as a democracy that
respects human rights.
</P>
<P>
KMT legislators demanded an apology from Premier Frank Hsieh for
allegedly lying when he produced a document during a call-in TV
program and claimed that it was former Kaohsiung Mayor Wu Den-yih --
now a KMT legislator -- who decided to adopt the
build-operate-transfer (BOT) model for the Kaohsiung rapid transit
system project. The claim was later rebutted by Wu, who produced a
document of his own that was purported to show that it was Hsieh
himself who recommended that government investment be handled by the
private sector. Hsieh was Wu's successor as Kaohsiung mayor before he
assumed the post of premier.
</P>
<P>
The KMT legislators also said they wanted to set up five
commissions with authorized access to all documents related to the
construction projects of both the Kaohsiung rapid transit system and
Taiwan's high-speed railway, the second phase of the government's
financial reform plan, an insider trading scandal involving a top
official charged with preventing insider trading in the stock market,
and the privatization of state-run Chunghwa Telecom that deliberately
violated a resolution passed by the previous legislature calling on
the government to halt the move.
</P>
<P>
Lai Ching-te, a whip of the DPP's legislative caucus, insisted at
a news conference that it was Wu who set the tone in a document one
day before the mayoral election allowing government investment to be
utilized by the private sector, and that as Kaohsiung mayor, Hsieh
was merely carrying out the plan under a KMT-controlled Cabinet.
</P>
<P>
On a separate occasion, Wu claimed that the BOT model for the
Kaohsiung rapid transit system was "merely a general direction" set
by the government at the time, but was carried out during Hsieh's
term as Kaohsiung mayor.
</P>
<P>
Wu further claimed that it would be "slander" to say that he was
the decision maker for the BOT project.

PREMIER TO BRIEF 'TAISHANG' ON CHINA POLICY UPDATES: SEF

<TEXT>
<P>
Premier Frank Hsieh will brief Taiwan
businessmen operating in China, known locally as taishang, on
progress in the government's China policy initiatives during a
Mid-Autumn Festival gathering, an official said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Hsieh may also announce new mainland policy initiatives on the
occasion, You Ying-lung, secretary-general of the quasi-official
Strait Exchange Foundation (SEF) , said. According to You, the SEF
will join forces with the Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) , the
Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA), the National Council on Physical
Fitness and Sports and the National Federation of Industries in
organizing a package of activities Sept. 20-21 for taishang who have
returned to Taiwan for the festival.
</P>
<P>
Mid-Autumn Festival, one of the principal holidays of the lunar
year, falls on Sept. 18 this year.
</P>
<P>
Among the activities will be a dinner to be organized by the SEF
Sept. 21, You said, adding that Hsieh and MAC Chairman Joseph Wu will
attend to brief the taishang on the latest progress in the three
major China policy initiatives announced by Hsieh during a similar
gathering earlier this year in celebration of Dragon Boat Festival.
</P>
<P>
The three policy initiatives referred to the opening of direct
charter cargo and passenger flights across the Taiwan Strait, the
opening of Taiwan to Chinese tourists, and Taiwan's farm produce
exports to China, You said.
</P>
<P>
As to whether the premier is likely to take the opportunity to
announce any new China policy initiatives, You said he would not rule
out that possibility.
</P>
<P>
The SEF is a quasi-official intermediary body authorized to
handle cross-strait exchanges in the absence of official ties. It is
under the MAC's supervision.

PINGTUNG AQUACULTURAL OPERATORS TO FOLLOW STRICT TEST PROCEDURE
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Pingtung County,  southern Taiwan,  Sept.  16 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Pingtung
county government has told aquaculturists raising groupers to follow
the same strict test procedures for exports when selling them locally
after groupers raised in several ponds were found to contain what
might be a carcinogen.
</P>
<P>
Huang Cheng-lung, head of the bureau of agriculture, made the
announcement after the Council of Agriculture (COA) announced the
previous day the results of tests on locally produced groupers. Out
of 36 samples collected from 13 aquaculture ponds in the counties of
Tainan and Pingtung, 14 were found to contain malachite green, a
synthetic dye used to color silk, wool and leather. It is also an
effective medication for the control of various external parasites of
freshwater and marine fish. In animal tests, it has been shown to be
harmful to the liver.
</P>
<P>
Although it has not been confirmed as carcinogenic, the United
States, the European Union, Canada, Japan, Hong Kong and Taiwan have
banned its use either in raising or in the delivery process.
</P>
<P>
The COA suspended sales of groupers from the aquaculturists who
failed the tests and imposed fines of between NT$6,000 (US$185) and
NT$30,000.
</P>
<P>
Groupers in nine aquaculture ponds in Pingtung contained
malachite green, although one of the operators denied using it.
</P>
<P>
Huang said that operators found to have used the chemical will be
stopped from selling them and be put on a tracking system until they
can improve and pass the test.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong first blew the whistle when it reported that it had
found a carcinogen in a sample exported from Taiwan in late August,
but the Taiwan authorities denied at the time that there was a
problem.

OPPOSITION AGAIN TURNS LEGISLATURE INTO FARCE
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Sept.  16 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Premier Frank Hsieh was again kept from
delivering his administrative report at the Legislative Yuan Friday
because of obstruction by opposition lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
The legislative caucus of the Kuomintang (KMT) , the largest
opposition party, said it would allow the premier to make his report
only if two conditions were met.
</P>
<P>
The first was that the premier must first apologize for the
controversial mass rapid transit (MRT) system in Kaohsiung,
construction on which was launched when he was still the mayor of
the southern port city. The issue of the Kaohsiung MRT system was
thrust into the spotlight after the Aug. 21 riot by Thai laborers
working on the construction of the system.
</P>
<P>
The second was for the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)
to consent to the formation of five committees to look into five
controversial issues: the one-year delay in the opening of the
high-speed rail, allegations of corruption in the Kaohsiung MRT
construction project, allegations of insider trading on the Taiwan
Stock Exchange, the second phase of the government's financial reform
plan, and the privatization of state-run Chunghwa Telecom.
</P>
<P>
The DPP responded by saying that there would be no horse trading
and emphasized that the premier must be allowed to speak first and
discussions on forming committees could come later. Whether the
premier will apologize for anything would be another matter, the DPP
caucus said.
</P>
<P>
Opposition lawmakers unfurled banners in front of the speaker's
podium after the session reopened in the afternoon Friday demanding
that the premier apologize for the Kaohsiung MRT controversy.
Legislative Yuan President Wang Jin-pyng pleaded with the legislators
in vain to return to their seats to prepare for the convening of the
session. Wang had to call for a recess.
</P>
<P>
Opposition lawmakers from the KMT and its ally, the People First
Party (PFP), continued to occupy the podium and hoisted placards,
blocking the proceedings.
</P>
<P>
DPP legislators remained in their seats, holding placards that
read: "convene, " and banged on their desks demanding that proceeding
begin. Lawmakers from the Taiwan Solidarity Union held posters
proclaiming: "real boycott and fake investigation" and wandered
around the hall, as the legislature took on the air of a misbehaved
group of kindergartners.
</P>
<P>
Speaker Wang had to announce that the legislative session would
resume next Tuesday, adding that he will try to mediate among
political parties next Monday to get the legislature moving.
</P>
<P>
Some opposition lawmakers were apparently ready to forgo having
the premier apologize, to which the DPP said, in a tit for tat move,
that the premier should be allowed to speak and then the ruling party
would form three committees to look into past corruption cases -
presumably by the KMT - involving polluting the nation and misused
land. The idea was rejected by the opposition.
</P>
<P>
The scene was similar to Tuesday's opening day of the new session
where the only thing accomplished was yelling, grandstanding and
legislators throwing things at each other. The premier was also
blocked from speaking that day.
</P>
<P>
The premier urged Cabinet members to use the time that the
opposition is obstructing the legislature productively, such as
reading official documents or holding small coordination meetings.
Premier Hsieh said that the day "was not too bad" for him.
</P>
<P>
Hsieh said that he used the time to meet with 16 Cabinet members
and decided on a number of things. He also said that these sorts of
antics could drag on and that he'd just have to get used to it.
</P>
<P>
However, the premier had earlier said sternly that the KMT and
the PFP, which hold a slim majority in the legislature, shouldn't
stop legislative proceedings, saying that doing so will paralyze the
administration and is against the principles of democracy.

TAIWANESE-CANADIANS TO PROTEST CHINESE LEADER'S VISIT TO VANCOUVER
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Vancouver,  Canada,  Sept. 15 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Overseas Taiwanese community
leaders in Vancouver said Thursday they will protest against China
during Chinese President Hu Jintao's forthcoming visit to the city
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The leaders from 24 Taiwanese groups in Vancouver said at a news
conference that the theme of their protest will be "Anti-aggression,
anti-nuclear, anti-hegemony, and the protection of Taiwan."
</P>
<P>
Hu is expected to arrived in Vancouver on Friday, and will attend
a state banquet given in his honor by Canadian Prime Minister Paul
Martin at the Westin Bayshore Hotel.
</P>
<P>
The leaders said they will mobilize hundreds of their members to
protest outside the venue of the state banquet, which will cap the
state visit by Hu.
</P>
<P>
They also urged Canada not to be silent on China's poor human
rights and democracy records simply because of Canada's attempts to
tap the Chinese market.
</P>
<P>
Tsai Fei-chu, the chairwoman of the Taiwanese Associations in
Vancouver, said at the news conference that China, instead of using
its growing national strength to improve its people's living
standard, has actively sought the annexation of Taiwan and thereby
poses a threat to world peace and security.
</P>
<P>
Tsai claimed an independent Taiwan would prod China to move on
the path towards democracy rather than pose a threat to China.
</P>
<P>
Hsu Chian-li, chairman of the Taiwanese-Canadian Cultural
Society, said at the news conference that they organized the protest
not only because of their love for Taiwan but also for the benefit of
Canada, adding that Canada's interests could hardly remain intact if
China attacked Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Hsu said China has taken pains to prevent Taiwan from joining the
World Health Organization (WHO), and has blocked other countries from
extending assistance to Taiwan when severe acute respiratory syndrome
(SARS) erupted in Taiwan in 2003.
</P>
<P>
As a result, Hsu claimed, Taiwan became a loophole in the WHO's
fight against epidemics. This could compromise Canada's efforts to
ward off epidemics in light of the heavy air traffic between Canada
and Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Trade with China hasn't brought any benefit to Canada thus far,
Hsu claimed, citing statistics showing that China had a trade surplus
of 17.5 billion Canada dollars (US$14.78 billion) with Canada in
2004, which is more than 10 times that of a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
"Canada's strength will be sapped if the trend continues, " Hsu
warned.
</P>
<P>
Yang Cheng-chao, head of the Friends of Taiwan group, raised
questions about China's potential market saying that the country is
dogged by uneven distribution of wealth, ethnic restlessness,
pollution, and human rights infringements.
</P>
<P>
"Canada should not pursue China's market at the expense of its
core values," Yang said.

PRESIDENTIAL OFFICE ASKS PUBLIC TO RESPECT RULING ON 2004 ELECTION
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Sept. 16 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Presidential Office asked Friday that
the public respect the Supreme Court ruling on the legality of the
disputed 2004 presidential election.
</P>
<P>
"Hopefully all social quarters can respect the Supreme Court
ruling against an appeal by the opposition 'pan-blue alliance' about
the legality of the 2004 presidential election, " said Chen
Wen-chung, director of the Presidential Office's Public Affairs
Department.
</P>
<P>
Chen made the remarks after the Supreme Court announced earlier
in the day that a panel of judges had overruled the opposition
"pan-blue alliance" appeal to declare the March 20, 2004 election
null and void because of alleged irregularities in the voting
procedures.
</P>
<P>
Friday's ruling closed all lawsuits resulting from the 2004
presidential election. In the election, President Chen Shui-bian
defeated his opponent, former Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Lien Chan, by
arazor-thin margin.
</P>
<P>
On the eve of the election, Chen Shui-bian was shot and lightly
wounded by an unknown assailant while campaigning in the southern
city of Tainan. The opposition claimed the shooting was staged, a
theory an official investigation has rejected.
</P>
<P>
The opposition's original petition accused the Central Election
Commission of ballot tampering and other irregularities, and demanded
the election be held again.
</P>
<P>
The opposition "pan-blue alliance" of the KMT and the People
First Party also claimed that a referendum held on the same day as
the presidential election had unfairly influenced the outcome of the
vote. But there was no connection between the referendum and the
outcome of the presidential election, the Supreme Court ruled Friday.
</P>
<P>
On June 17, the Supreme Court also ruled against another
opposition appeal, which had contested President Chen's re-election
on the basis of the election-eve shooting.

Progressive Party (DPP) candidates for president and vice president
at the time -- were injured in a shooting on March 19 last year on
the eve of the election.
</P>
<P>
The two opposition parties, known as the "pan-blue alliance,"
also claimed that a referendum held along with the election violated
the Referendum Law and affected the results of the election,
resulting in Chen and Lu wining by a small margin.
</P>
<P>
The case was one of two lawsuits filed by former KMT Chairman
Lien Chan and PFP Chairman James Soong in an attempt to reverse the
election results. The other suit seeking a court ruling to declare
Chen's election invalid was rejected by the Supreme Court June 17.
</P>
<P>
In its ruling Friday, the Supreme Court said the Central Election
Commission did not violate any law in deciding that the election
should proceed as scheduled despite the March 19 shooting because the
law provides that the commission can cancel a presidential election
by public announcement only in the event of the death of a
presidential candidate before the vote.
</P>
<P>
The court also explained that a presidential election cannot be
rescheduled unless it is made impossible by a natural disaster or an
"irresistible force."
</P>
<P>
The court also ruled that it was difficult to affirm that there
was a connection between the election and the referendum, or that the
referendum had affected the election results. Therefore, whether the
Referendum Law was violated or not, the referendum could not be used
as a reason to claim that the election was invalid.
</P>
<P>
The referendum asked voters' opinion on two questions about
China's missile deployment opposite Taiwan and measures to manage
relations with Beijing. Because voter participation failed to reach
the 50 percent required by law, the referendum was declared null and
void.
</P>
<P>
At a news conference Friday night, KMT spokeswoman Cheng Li-wen
said the Supreme Court ruling will not be the final judgment, because
the final judgment will be by the people, and history and justice
will eventually prevail in Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
She said the people of Taiwan are not surprised at the ruling,
and "that makes the whole thing particularly sad."
</P>
<P>
The spokeswoman added that the people waited a whole year only to
find out that Taiwan's judiciary system could not play a supervisory
role and provide the checks and balance necessary for a democratic
society.
</P>
<P>
Sun Ta-chien, deputy convener of the PFP legislative caucus,
deplored the court ruling, saying also that he was "not surprised at
all."
</P>
<P>
He pledged that the PFP caucus at the legislature will push for
the establishment of a new commission to unearth the truth behind the
March 19 shooting.
</P>
<P>
Also commenting on the court ruling, Lai Ching-te, a whip of the
DPP legislative caucus, urged the KMT and the PFP to respect the
decision and work for a reconciliation between the ruling and the
opposition parties.

PRESIDENT CHEN REAFFIRMS COMMITMENT TO REFORM AT DPP BIRTHDAY EVENT
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taichung,  Taiwan,  Sept. 16 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President Chen Shui-bian said
Friday the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) must never waver
on its pledge to reform to retain its grip on power and not let down
the public.
</P>
<P>
Chen made the remarks while attending an evening party in the
central city of Taichung to mark the DPP's 19th founding anniversary.
</P>
<P>
"Reform is the road we must take. We must insist on continued
reform of our political, economic and social systems to keep our
vitality and competitiveness. Otherwise, we'll be ousted from
office," Chen told DPP members and supporters.
</P>
<P>
While cutting a birthday cake, Chen also made three wishes --
that Taiwan becomes a "normal, complete, progressive, beautiful and
great country"; that the DPP wins control of more than half of the 21
mayoral and magistrate posts up for grabs in the year-end elections;
and that the DPP remains in power after the 2008 presidential
election.
</P>
<P>
The DPP's founding anniversary falls on Sept. 28. As President
Chen will be on a Central America diplomatic tour from Sept. 20 to
Oct. 1, the DPP advanced its celebrations to Friday. DPP Chairman Su
Tseng-chang will accompany Chen on the journey that will include
transit stops in two U.S. cities and official visits to five of the
ROC's allies in Central America and the Caribbean.

ELECTION COMMISSION PLEASED THAT COURT EXONERATED ITS ACTIONS
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  Sept.  16 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Central Election Commission said
Friday that it was pleased that the Supreme Court has cleared it of
any wrongdoing in conducting the 2004 presidential election.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued after the Supreme Court threw out an appeal
by defeated presidential candidate Lien Chan and his running mate,
James Soong, against a Taiwan High Court decision to dismiss their
request to invalidate the 2004 presidential election, the commission
said the ruling vindicates the commission's declaration that the
country's 180,000-odd election workers had honestly carried out their
jobs and followed the law.
</P>
<P>
The court ruled that Lien and Soong, who lost to President Chen
Shui-bian by a margin of 0.228 percent of the votes, and had claimed
that there were thousands of invalid ballots included in the final
tally and numerous ballots cast by nonexistent voters, had make
groundless claims.
</P>
<P>
Of course, the commission said, the election was not perfect, and
some election workers had unwittingly made mistakes, and the
commission has already taken action to address these problems.
However, none of these mistakes affected the outcome of the
presidential election, the commission added.
</P>
<P>
The commission said it is pleased that presidential election was
able to bear the court's scrutiny, and hopes the controversies
surrounding the election will be put to rest forever with the Supreme
Court's decision.

JAPAN FORMALLY INFORMS TAIWAN OF PERMANENT VISA WAIVER
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Tokyo,  Sept.  16 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Japan formally informed the Republic of
China's representative office in Tokyo Friday of its decision to drop
visa requirements for Taiwan tourists from Sept. 26.
</P>
<P>
Masaji Takahashi, president of the Japanese Interchange
Association (JIA), conveyed the message to Koh Se-kai, the ROC
representative to Japan. The JIA is a quasi-official institution
authorized to handle exchanges with Taiwan in the absence of formal
diplomatic ties.
</P>
<P>
Koh said the Japanese decision is a belated reciprocal measure.
Taiwan has long offered visa-free treatment for Japanese tourists.
"The mutual exemption of visa requirements symbolizes close
substantive ties between Taiwan and Japan," Koh said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, the Japanese Diet passed a special bill to
grant 90-day, visa-free entry to Taiwan visitors from March 25
through Sept. 25 in connection with the Aichi Expo. With the
temporary visa waiver period soon to expire, Japanese
parliamentarians decided to pass a new bill Aug. 5 to allow for
permanent visa-free status for Taiwan passport holders from Sept. 26.
</P>
<P>
In the future, Koh said the ROC representative office will focus
on lobbying Japan to improve the bilateral engagement mechanism.
Stressing that the mechanism -- formulated in 1972 following Japan's
switch of diplomatic recognition from Taipei to Beijing -- has
become obsolete, Koh said Japan should make an overall review and
forge a more effective mechanism to facilitate bilateral exchanges.
</P>
<P>
Under the 1972 mechanism, both Taipei and Tokyo set up
intermediary bodies -- the Taipei-based Association of East Asian
Relations and the Tokyo-based Interchange Association -- to handle
bilateral exchanges in the absence of direct official contacts.
</P>
<P>
Now that Japan has explicitly singled out Taiwan Strait peace as
a common strategic objective in the U.S.-Japan defense cooperation
treaty, Koh said Japan should not continue resisting improvements to
communication channels with Taiwan simply for fear of offending
China.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Koh said he will also strive to lobby Japan to sign a
free trade agreement with Taiwan. "It won't be an easy task, but
anyway, we'll make every possible effort to create a favorable
environment to that end," he added.

CHINA'S HELP TO TAIWAN BUSINESSMEN NOT AN OPENING FOR PROPAGANDA: MAC
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Sept.  16 (CNA)
(By Elizabeth Hsu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
China should not interpret its helping
safeguard Taiwanese investments in China as an opening to engage in
political propaganda, the Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) said in a
statement Friday.
</P>
<P>
The council released the statement after the first cross-strait
civilian forum co-hosted by the opposition People First Party and the
Communist Party of China ended in Shanghai with proposals aimed at
safeguarding the rights and interests of Taiwanese investors on the
mainland.
</P>
<P>
The rights and interests of Taiwanese investments in China, as
well as problems of cross-strait commercial arbitration and
intellectual property rights protection were to be further discussed
by both sides before talks were suspended in 1995, the statement
said.
</P>
<P>
No progress has been made on this front as Beijing does not want
to talk with officials of the ROC government on Taiwan, and the MAC
is asking that China be practical and work together with Taiwan to
protect Taiwanese business interests and rights, especially the
safety of Taiwanese working in China.
</P>
<P>
The MAC also hopes cross-strait negotiations will resume as soon
as possible to build a protection mechanism for Taiwan interests in
China.

CHEN HAS NEVER ASKED SOONG TO CONVEY MESSAGE TO HU: SPOKESMAN

<TEXT>
<P>
President Chen Shui-bian has never asked
opposition People First Party Chairman James Soong to pass any
messages to Chinese President Hu Jintao, a Presidential Office
spokesman said Friday.
</P>
<P>
James Huang, a Presidential Office deputy secretary-general, made
the remarks after James R. Keith, a U.S. State Department senior
adviser, said that Soong met P.R.C. President Hu Jintao and other
P.R.C. leaders in Beijing on May 12 and passed the message that Chen
Shui-bian was willing to engage in dialogue with Beijing using a
flexible formulation about what constitutes "one China."
</P>
<P>
Huang said he didn't know where the U.S. State Department got its
information and that the State Department has not contacted the Presi
ential Office regarding the matter.
</P>
<P>
One thing is certain, however, and that is that Chen has never
asked Soong to pass any messages to the Chinese leadership, Huang
said.

U.S. CONGRESSMEN TO VISIT OVER ARMS PROCUREMENT PACKAGE
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Washington,  Sept.  16  (CNA)
(By Wennie Chi and Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A group of U.S. congressmen has
tentatively decided to visit Taiwan next month to exchange views with
government officials and legislators on the country's long-stalled
arms procurement package from the United States.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Congressman Rob Simmons (R.- Conn.) is arranging
the delegation, which will mainly comprise members of
the Committee on Armed Forces of the U.S. House of Representatives.
</P>
<P>
The delegation will come for Double Ten National Day celebration
activities on Oct. 10 and will meet with legislators to discuss
national security.
</P>
<P>
The congressman originally hoped that Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman
Ma Ying-jeou would help solve differences within the opposition
"pan-blue alliance" of the KMT and its ally, the People First Party,
and work toward early passage of the arms procurement package.
</P>
<P>
Ma recently turned down an invitation from the Taiwan Caucus -- a
pro-Taiwan group in the U.S. House of Representatives -- to visit
Washington, D.C. in September to explain the opposition camp's
opposition.
</P>
<P>
However, Ma said that he and the KMT caucus will ensure that
Taiwan's defensive capability is strengthened and that relations
between the U.S. and Taiwan are further cemented.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan's opposition-controlled Legislative Yuan blocked the
package for the 28th time earlier this week, refusing to allow it to
be put on the legislative agenda.
</P>
<P>
The package comprises three big-ticket weaponry items -- eight
diesel-electric submarines, a squadron of 12 P-3C anti-submarine
aircraft and six Patriot PAC III anti-missile batteries. For more
than a year, the "pan-blue alliance" has refused to screen the
package because it claims the price is too high and that it should be
listed under the regular budget rather than a special budget.

HUMAN RIGHTS AWARD MARKS INTERNATIONAL AFFIRMATION TO ROC: OFFICIAL

(By Elizabeth Hsu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A plan of the U.S. Congressional Human
Rights Caucus to confer on President Chen Shui-bian a human rights
award is an affirmation to the Taiwan people's efforts to seek human
rights, democracy and freedom, the Presidential Office said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The award represents not only an affirmation of Chen's
contribution, but also of the Taiwan people's sacrifice and struggle
in a decades-long fight for human rights and democracy, according to
Chen Wen-chung, head of the office's department of public affairs.
</P>
<P>
Chen made the statement after the opposition Kuomintang (KMT)
voiced a protest over the event, pointing out that it would be ironic
to issue a human rights award to a country recently shocked by
revelations of gross human rights abuse of its foreign workers.
</P>
<P>
Besides the Presidential Office, the legislative caucus of the
ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) also issued a statement
praising the award as an reaffirmation of Taiwan's efforts in the
promotion of human rights.
</P>
<P>
DPP caucus whip Chen Jin-jun said the DPP regrets the KMT's
criticism, while staying silent over China's abysmal human rights
record.
</P>
<P>
Pan Wei-kang, a KMT legislative caucus whip, hosted a news
conference at the Legislative Yuan Saturday to accuse the government
of harming human rights because it failed to properly address the
scandal involving the Kaohsiung rapid transit railway construction
project exposed by an Aug. 21 riot by maltreated Thai laborers. She
noted that the scandal has blemished Taiwan's global image as a
democracy that respect human rights, and pointed out that the Thai
government has filed an accusation against Taiwan at the United
Nations.
</P>
<P>
Pan said the president should clean up the mess after Premier
Frank Hsieh, who served as Kaohsiung mayor for six years before
taking the helm of the Cabinet in February, refused to apologize for
the scandal, while the government has been reluctant to release the
results of an investigation into the scandal involving corruption
among government officials.
</P>
<P>
KMT Legislator Su Chi said the KMT caucus plans to write to the
U.S. Congress to provide details about the riot and about opposition
claims that the government has suppressed the freedom of the press.
</P>
<P>
It is expected that President Chen will receive the Human Rights
Award during his transit stop in Miami en route to Central America
next week.

WORLD SHOULD TAKE HEED OF TAIWAN BEING UNFAIRLY CONTAINED: FM
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Sept. 17 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Minister of Foreign Affairs Tan Sun Chen
expressed hope Saturday that the international community will take
heed of Taiwan being unfairly contained by China.
</P>
<P>
Chen made the remarks at the inaugural World Forum for
Democratization in Asia, which entered its third and last day at the
Taipei International Convention Center.
</P>
<P>
Describing Taiwan's democratic experience as a success story
worthy of reference for other countries, he lamented that Taiwan is a
democracy shut out of the international community.
</P>
<P>
During the Cold War, he claimed, democratic countries "contained
communist countries, " but now it is totalitarian China that tries to
contain Taiwan, Chen said, adding that the international community
should not turn a blind eye to the situation.
</P>
<P>
He also said that democratization in Japan, Taiwan, Thailand and
Mongolia have made great strides and that these democratic countries
should build a democratic front and integrate the region to create a
pan-Asia organization that shares the common values of democracy and
can become a force of powerful influence.
</P>
<P>
He cited as an example the fact that Myanmar, because of its
human rights record, is often criticized by the international
community and was forced to abandon the rotating chairmanship in the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations.
</P>
<P>
The authoritarian regime in China has become a hurdle to regional
integration and is a threat to neighboring countries, he said. It is
also a major force in supporting other non-democratic countries such
as North Korea, Myanmar and Uzbekistan, he said.
</P>
<P>
Democratic countries in Asia must unite to prod China to move
toward democratization or the future of democracy in Asia
will face daunting challenges, he went on.
</P>
<P>
Chen also said that since the international community thinks the
Taiwan Strait is a possible flashpoint, it should play a role of
coordinator between the two sides of the strait so that the two
governments on either side can sort out their differences.

KMT HEAD WILLING TO MEET WITH U.S. CONGRESSMEN OVER ARMS PURCHASE
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,   Sept.  17  (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Opposition Kuomintang Chairman Ma
Ying-jeou is willing to communicate with U.S. congressmen on the
country's long-stalled arms procurement package from the United
States, a KMT spokeswoman said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Cheng Li-wen made the remarks amid reports that U.S. Congressman
Rob Simmons (R.- Conn.) is arranging for a visit to Taiwan by
delegation mainly comprising members of the Committee on Armed Forces
of the U.S. House of Representatives.
</P>
<P>
The delegation will come for the Oct. 10 Double Ten National Day
celebration and will meet with government officials and legislators
to exchange views on the arms package, according to the reports.
</P>
<P>
Cheng said that Ma is very willing to communicate with them if a
meeting can be arranged.
</P>
<P>
She made the claim that "most of the U.S. congressmen" have their
information supplied by the ruling Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) , which she said might have given them false information. She
cited especially the Formosan Association for Public Affairs (FAPA) ,
a U.S.-based pro-Taiwan independence organization, which she claimed
often "twists the truth and supplies incorrect information, " leading
the U.S. congressmen to form misunderstanding of the KMT.
</P>
<P>
If chance arises, she went on, the KMT is very willing to put its
side of the story -- that the KMT believes the problem lies with the
DPP and not the KMT.
</P>
<P>
Ma recently noted that the arms procurement package was approved
by the Cabinet in 1998, when Lien Chan, former KMT chairman, was
premier, and that the U.S. did not approve the arms procurement
package until 2001, by which time the DPP's Chen Shui-bian was
president.
</P>
<P>
But the DPP waited until 2004 to submit a special budget for the
three big-ticket weaponry items -- eight diesel-electric submarines,
a squadron of 12 P-3C anti-submarine aircraft and six Patriot PAC III
anti-missile batteries -- triggering questions as to why the tag
price ballooned at one point from the original amount of between
NT$200 billion (US$6.15 billion) and NT$300 billion to NT$610.8
billion.
</P>
<P>
Ma said the arms procurement package involves price and
cross-strait relations issues, and that the government should think
seriously about how to avoid plunging the two sides of the Taiwan
Strait into an arms race.
</P>
<P>
For more than a year, the opposition "pan-blue alliance" of the 
Kuomintang (KMT) and the People First Party (PFP) has refused to
screen the package because it claims the price is too high and that
it should be listed under the regular budget rather than a special
budget. The opposition-controlled Legislative Yuan blocked the
package for the 28th time earlier this week, refusing to allow it to
be put on the legislative agenda.

TEN FOREIGN LEADERS SPEAKS FOR TAIWAN IN U.N.

Leaders from 10 countries spoke out for
Taiwan in the United Nations Summit of World Leaders that ended in
New York Friday, according to Taiwan officials posted here.
</P>
<P>
Officials from the Taiwan representative office in New York said
that of the 10, nine are from Taiwan's allies and the other comes
from Fiji, which does not have diplomatic ties with Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
The three-day summit brought together the leaders of 170 states,
each of whom was given only five minutes to speak, making the
pro-Taiwan words all the more valuable, said the officials.
</P>
<P>
The leaders of the nine allies who spoke out for Taiwan were
Kiribati President Anote Tong, Tuvalu Prime Minister Maatia Toafa,
Honduras Foreign Minister Mario Fortin, Palau, Sao Tome and Principe
President Fradique de Menenes, Saint Christopher and Nevis Prime
Minister Denzil Douglas, Nauru President Ludwig Scotty, Marshall
Islands President Kessai Note and Solomon Islands Prime Minister Sir
Allan Kemakeza.
</P>
<P>
They either admired Taiwan's economic development and democracy,
or urged the U.N. to fulfill its goal of universal representation by
admitting Taiwan as a member.
</P>
<P>
The officials said Taiwan appreciates that the leaders spoke in
favor of Taiwan, even though it would not help the country's bid to
enter the U.N. this year as it had already been quashed after the
U.N. General Committee decided Tuesday against putting it on the
agenda.

<P>
Foreign Minister Tan Sun Chen thanked the
leaders of nine allies and Fiji Saturday for speaking out for Taiwan
at the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
The leaders of the nine allies either praised Taiwan's economic
achievements and democracy or prodded the U.N. to admit Taiwan as a
member at the United Nations Summit of World Leaders that concluded
in New York Friday.
</P>
<P>
Although their speech did not help Taiwan's bid to enter the U.N.
this year, which had already been quashed after the U.N. General
Committee decided Sept. 13 not to put it on the agenda of the U.N.,
they have helped voice Taiwan's desire to reach out to the
international community, Chen said.
</P>
<P>
The Minister said he especially took heart at the speech of Fiji
President Josefa Iloila, who said the world should develop ties with
China and Taiwan in parallel. Iloila's remarks bode well for ties
between the two countries, although there are no diplomatic ties
between Taiwan and Fiji, Chen said.
</P>
<P>
The leaders of the nine allies who spoke out for Taiwan were
Kiribati President Anote Tong, Tuvalu Prime Minister Maatia Toafa,
Honduras Foreign Minister Mario Fortin, Palau President Tommy
Remengesau, Sao Tome and Principe President Fradique de Menenes,
Saint Christopher and Nevis Prime Minister Denzil Douglas, Nauru
President Ludwig Scotty, Marshall Islands President Kessai Note and

PREMIER REFUSES TO ACCEPT CONDITIONS FOR GIVING REPORT
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Sept. 17 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Premier Frank Hsieh said Saturday that an
opposition lawmakers' demand that he apologize before they will allow
him to deliver his administrative report to the legislature is like
forcing someone to write a remorse note before a conviction is made.
</P>
<P>
The premier, who was again kept from giving a report due to the
obstruction of the opposition legislators the previous day, was
referring to one of the conditions set by the legislators for him to
give the report -- that he must first apologize for the controversial
mass rapid transit system in Kaohsiung, construction on which was
launched when he was still the mayor of the southern port city.
</P>
<P>
The issue of the Kaohsiung MRT system was thrust into the
spotlight after the Aug. 21 riot by Thai laborers working on the
system.
</P>
<P>
The premier, while on a stumping trip for Lin Chia-lung, the
ruling Democratic Progressive Party candidate for Taichung City in
the year-end elections, also said that he would not apologize under
pressure, adding that an apology should come from within.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the DPP legislative caucus reaffirmed that there will
be no horse trading on the premier's report.
</P>
<P>
William C.T. Lai, caucus whip in the legislature, said the
premier's duty to report is stipulated in the Constitution and it
will oppose the request by the opposition Kuomintang (KMT) caucus
that the DPP should first consent to the formation of committees to
look into five controversial issues: the one-year delay in the
opening of the high-speed railway; allegations of corruption in the
Kaohsiung MRT construction project; allegations of insider trading on
the Taiwan Stock Exchange; the second phase of the government's
financial reform plan; and the privatization of state-run Chunghwa
Telecom.
</P>
<P>
As Legislative Yuan President Wang Jin-pyng will convene a
meeting between the KMT and the DPP legislative caucuses next Monday
for coordination over the stalemate, Lai said that the DPP's stance
will be that the premier should first give the report before it will
agree to the formation of the five committees and that the KMT should
also agree to the DPP's demand for three committees to investigate
the former ruling party's past corruption, environmental pollution,
and idle public facilities.
</P>
<P>
The People First Party (PFP), an ally of the KMT, backed its
demands of an apology and formation of committees.
</P>
<P>
But as it is the KMT who initiated the obstruction of the
legislative proceeding, the PFP will respect the KMT's decision on
what to allow the premier to report upon, Sun Ta-chien, PFP caucus
whip in the legislature said.
</P>
<P>
The Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU) said the legislative committees
have no substantial function, will not help in finding out the truth
and will merely be a tool for grandstanding.
</P>
<P>
For this reason, Ho Min-hao, TSU caucus whip in the legislature,
said the party will oppose the formation of a committee for any single
event.

EXECUTIVE YUAN CRITICIZES KUOMINTANG FOR SHAMING COUNTRY
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  Sept.  17 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The opposition Kuomintang (KMT) has no
concerns about the country's image when it threatened to stop US
congressmen giving a humman right award to President Chen Shui-bian,
Cho jung-tai, a spokesman for the Executive Yuan, said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Cho said the award to the president is a honor to be shared by
the whole nation, the KMT is subordinating the national interest to
its partisan interest by threatening to dissuade the US Congress from
giving the president the honor.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the KMT lawmakers have criticized the president
because of the Thai workers in Kaohsiung has resorted to riot to
protest their inhuman treatment in Taiwan, the spokesman said the
riot is an isolate incident which should not be used as a reason to
completely deny the president's efforts to improve human rights.
</P>
<P>
In its attempt to throw a spanner in the works, the spokesman
said, the KMT has exposed its narrow-mindedness and its reluctance to
see the president who ended the KMT's five-decade rule being honored
in anyway.
</P>
<P>
Cho said some of the president's critics at home are political
biased, they would stop at nothing to debase their country but turn a
blind eye to China's attempts to isolate the country.
</P>
<P>
He called on the opposition to give precedence to the national
interest rather then their party's interest.
</P>
<P>
Cho made the remarks after several KMT lawmakers criticizing the
US Congressional Human Rights Caucus's decision to give President
Chen Shui-bian a human rights award earlier Saturday, saying they
will persuade the caucus to drop its plan.

TAIWAN HOSTING SEMINAR TO ENHANCE NATION'S FLOWER EXPORTS
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Sept. 18 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The quasi-official Taiwan External Trade
Development Council (TAITRA) will sponsor a seminar on Asian
horticultural trade opportunities Monday as part of its efforts to
boost the nation's flower exports, a TAITRA official said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The Netherlands Trade and Investment Office (NTIO) , which
represents Dutch interests in Taipei in the absence of formal
diplomatic ties, has assisted in organizing the seminar, the official
said.
</P>
<P>
According to TAITRA tallies, Taiwan exported US$14.88 million
worth of flowers in 2004 while imports reaching US$57.95 million. The
gap indicated that there is still ample room for local florists to
promote their overseas sales, the official said.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the Netherlands has been one of the world's major
flower exporters, the official said TAITRA has invited major Dutch
horticultural companies and agricultural officials to attend the
seminar to offer counseling.
</P>
<P>
Topics to be addressed will include the opportunity for Taiwan to
become an Asia-Pacific floral trade center, the current state and
future prospects for Taiwan's orchid exports and the feasibility of
Taiwan using the Netherlands as a springboard to enter the European
horticultural market, the official said.
</P>
<P>
Dutch horticultural companies sending representatives to the
seminar will include Anthura B.V., Bunnik Plants and Geest
Orchideeen. Several officials from the Dutch Ministry of Agriculture
will also travel to Taiwan to attend the meeting.
</P>
<P>
In addition to attending the conference, the Dutch visitors will
visit major Taiwan horticultural centers to explore possible trade or
joint-venture deals.
</P>
<P>
According to official tallies, Taiwan has 12,579 hectares of
flower-growing areas, with an annual production of US$380 million.
Orchids alone account for about US$73.94 million. Major flower farms
are concentrated in Changhua, Nantou and Chiayi counties.

EXPATS SUPPORT ROC LAWMAKER'S PROTESTS AGAINST JAPANESE WAR CRIMES
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
San Francisco, Sept. 17 (CNA)
(By C. Chiang and P.C. Tang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Republic of China lawmaker who is
currently in San Francisco to launch a campaign in protest against
Japanese atrocities against Taiwan's aborigines during its occupation
of the island said Saturday that she has received a lot of support
and generous donations from local Taiwan expatriates.
</P>
<P>
According to Legislator Kao Kin Su-mei, at the head of a
60-member aboriginal group, she and the group will lodge a series of
protests against Japanese war crimes at Japan's consulates in San
Francisco, Philadelphia and Houston and at the United Nations'
headquarters in New York City Sept. 23.
</P>
<P>
Besides expressing her gratitude for the support given by
overseas Taiwanese living in the city, the legislator said that the
history of World War II only recalls the past sadness of the people
in those countries and areas that were under colonial rule of Japan
during the war, including China, Taiwan, South Korea, the
Philippines, Indonesia and Okinawa.
</P>
<P>
"I will continue to lodge protests against Japan's criminal
conduct during World War II if the nation refuses to make a thorough
self-examination and an apology for what it did to the people of
these countries, " Kao Chin said, adding: "I think Japan is not
qualified to be a member of the United Nations Security Council as
long as it refuses to apologize for the war it provoked in the
Pacific region."
</P>
<P>
The legislator has visited Japan seven times during the past
three years to demand that the Japanese authorities remove the
memorial tablets of the aboriginal soldiers who fought for Japan from
the Yasukuni Shrine in Tokyo, where they are honored among those
Japanese soldiers who died for the country, but the request was
ignored.

TAIWAN A STRONG SUPPORTER OF INTERNATIONAL VOLUNTEERISM: IAVE
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Ottawa,   Sept.   17  (CNA)
(By S.K. Wu and P.C. Tang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Board of Directors of the
International Association for Volunteer Effort (IAVE) has affirmed
the contributions made by Taiwan to the organization and praised the
island as a strong supporter of the association, a local IAVE
representative in Taiwan said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Tim Wu, national representative of the IAVE in Taiwan and an
international member of the IAVE's board of directors, made the
remarks while attending a conference currently being held in Ottawa.
</P>
<P>
Wu, who also president and executive director of IAVE-Taiwan,
said that during the meeting the members of the board recognized the
significant role played by the island in an "IAVE.org project, "
which offers an exchange platform for volunteers worldwide, and in
the establishment of an IAVE Resource Center in Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
IAVE, which has individual and organizational members in some 80
countries around the world, is an international non-governmental
organization that promotes and strengthens volunteerism worldwide.
</P>
<P>
Pointing out that President Chen Shui-bian has attached great
importance to volunteerism in Taiwan since he took office in 2000, Wu,
who founded IAVE-Taiwan in 2002, said that a group of people on the
island have since worked on the possible association of international
non-governmental organizations with Taiwan's dynamic civilian
society.
</P>
<P>
"The outcome of such efforts was the signing of a cooperation
agreement among the IAVE, IAVE-Taiwan and the National Youth
Commission under the Executive Yuan in April of this year on the
setting up of an IAVE international resource center. Taiwan also
agreed in 2003 to help the organization build an Internet Web site
network, " he further said.
</P>
<P>
The IAVE board of directors also briefed Robert Leigh, a senior
U.N. official responsible for volunteerism affairs, who also attended
the meeting, on the close relationship between the IAVE and Taiwan.
"This tells us that although Taiwan is not a U.N. member, its active
participation in international activities can make the U.N.
understand the contributions that the island has made to the world, "
Wu said.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Wu warned that Taiwan should realize that
participating in international affairs means discussing world and
regional issues as well as issues related to common values of
democracy, freedom and civil society, rather than talking always
about the island's own matters.
</P>
<P>
During the gathering, Wu suggested that the IAVE set up a global
education center in the southern port city of Kaohsiung in Taiwan.

VOLUNTEER RANGERS CONVERGE IN HSITOU TO PROMOTE ECO-FRIENDLY TOURS

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
More than 1,000 volunteer rangers
converged in the Hsitou Forest Recreation Area in the central Taiwan
county of Nantou Sunday to promote eco-friendly tours.
</P>
<P>
The event was organized by National Taiwan University (NTU) ,
which manages the 2,799.3-hectare Hsitou Forest Recreation Area, one
of Taiwan's most popular mountain retreats for people to beat the
summer heat.
</P>
<P>
NTU President Lee Su-chen said the Hsitou forest park was
battered by three devastating mudslides caused by Typhoon Herb in
1996, the magnitude 7.6-earthquake on Sept. 21, 1999 and Typhoon
Toraji in 2001.
</P>
<P>
After more than six years of rehabilitation with eco-friendly
technologies, Lee said, the Hsitou recreation area has emerged as a
model region equipped with a superior mudslide prevention system.
</P>
<P>
"I'm hopeful that today's event can inspire more local people to
volunteer their services to help protect our forests and natural
environment," Lee said.
</P>
<P>
The event included an ecology-centered quiz show, a concert and
guided hiking along six major courses in the forest park. In support
of the event, some British and U.S. tobacco companies donated 20,000
seedlings for forestation in the park.

LOCAL ELECTION RESULTS COULD BE LITMUS TEST FOR 2008 PRESIDENTIAL RACEBy Han Nai-kuoCNA Staff Reporter
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei, Sept.  18  (CNA)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taiwan's major political parties are
preparing for heated campaigning for the elections of mayors and
county magistrates in December, as their leaders believe the results
will set the stage for the all-important 2008 presidential election.
</P>
<P>
One of the three wishes President Chen Shui-bian made in a speech
last week was that the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) take
more than half of Taiwan's 21 cities and countries being contested in
the Dec. 3 elections; another wish being that the DPP continue to be
the ruling party after the 2008 presidential election.
</P>
<P>
The DPP has fielded a candidate in every city and county, except
in Taitung County. It has given up in the outlying islands of Kinmen
and Matsu, where the DPP has never won an election. The party is
focusing its efforts on winning in cities and counties currently not
under DPP control, especially Taichung City and Taichung County.
</P>
<P>
Opinion polls show that DPP candidates are ahead of their
opponents from other parties in Tainan City and the counties of
Taipei, Kaohsiung, Chiayi, Yunlin, Pingtung, Nantou and Changhua.
However, in northern and central Taiwan, the DPP is facing a hard
battle, especially in Keelung City, Taoyuan County, Hsinchu City,
Hsinchu County, Taichung City and Taichung County.
</P>
<P>
Although the DPP has designated Lin Chia-lung, former head of the
Government Information Office, and former legislator Chiu Tai-san --
both of whom are noted national figures -- to run in Taichung City
and Taichung County, respectively, they still have a long way to go
in their attempt to unseat incumbent Taichung Mayor Jason Hu and
Taichung County Magistrate Huang Jhong-sheng, both of the opposition
Kuomintang (KMT).
</P>
<P>
The DPP is using its advantage as the ruling party to back its
candidates in the campaigning. For example, Premier Frank Hsieh has
endorsed a plan to construct a rapid transit network for Taichung
City which was pledged by the DPP candidate.
</P>
<P>
DPP party officials told the media they have developed a strategy
to weaken support for the KMT in those cities and counties that have
long remained under KMT control. These officials said the DPP will
resort to a "secret weapon" at the latter stage of the campaigning.
</P>
<P>
For the KMT, the main battlefields are in the counties of
Changhua, Nantou and Yunlin. If the party can win in Chiayi City,
where the KMT has been out of power for 26 years, or in the counties
of Ilan and Taipei, where the KMT has been the underdog for 16 years,
party officials would see the KMT victory in the elections as sealed.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, good coordination between the KMT and the
People First Party (PFP) , known as the "pan-blue alliance, " is
necessary for the two parties to avoid their candidates competing
with each other. Such cooperation, however, is still not assured, as
indicated by the rivalry between Liu Wen-hsiung, the PFP's candidate
for Keelung mayor, and the KMT's man, incumbent Keelung Mayor Hsu
Tsai-li.
</P>
<P>
In addition to Keelung City, The PFP has vowed to name its own
candidates in seven other cities and counties: the cities of Taichung
and Chiayi and the counties of Hualien, Changhua, Lienchiang (Matsu),
Ilan and Hsinchu. It remains to be seen how the KMT will collaborate
with the PFP.
</P>
<P>
Taipei County, with a population of 3.5 million, will no doubt be
the most hotly contested area in the elections. At present, the KMT
candidate, Legislator Chou Hsi-wei, and his DPP opponent Legislator
Lo Wen-chia are running neck and neck, according to the latest
opinion polls. Both parties have acknowledged that they cannot afford
to lose in Taipei County, as the election result is crucial to their
chance of winning in the 2008 presidential election.
</P>
<P>
KMT party officials are confident that with the battle fought
between the DPP and the "pan-blue alliance, " the KMT candidate will
have a considerable advantage, as indicated by the 2004 presidential
election when the pan-blue ticket of Lien Chan and James Soong
exceeded the DPP ticket of Chen Shui-bian and Annette Lu by 130,000
votes in Taipei County.
</P>
<P>
Another major advantage for the KMT is the whirlwind created by
Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou because of his recent election to the post
of party chairman. His personal charisma and the hope he has kindled
in the minds of people yearning for national political reform will
probably be the biggest asset in the KMT's bid to regain power.

PREMIER SUGGESTS LEGISLATURE VOTE ON WHETHER TO ACCEPT HIS REPORT
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Sept. 18 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Premier Frank Hsieh suggested Sunday that
the opposition-controlled Legislative Yuan decide whether to allow
him to deliver an administrative report at its plenary session by a
vote.
</P>
<P>
Hsieh made the suggestion after lawmakers from the opposition
"pan-blue alliance" of the Kuomintang (KMT) and the People First
Party (PFP) twice blocked him from addressing the legislature on his
Cabinet's work agenda and its 2006 budget plan last week by occupying
the podium of the legislative chamber.
</P>
<P>
"As the 'pan-blue alliance' controls a slim majority in the
legislature, it can do whatever it wants. But I don't think that all
opposition lawmakers would like to see the unproductive legislative
session continue. Probably, the legislature can hold a vote to
resolve this deadlock," Hsieh said.
</P>
<P>
Touching on President Chen Shui-bian's remarks a day earlier that
the legislative caucus of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) should not come up with a non-confidence vote against the
Cabinet as a countermeasure to the "pan-blue alliance's" boycott on
Hsieh's administrative report, Hsieh said he fully agrees with Chen's
view.
</P>
<P>
"The DPP legislative caucus indeed should support the
government's policy and has no legitimate reason to take a
no-confidence vote," Hsieh said.
</P>
<P>
Under current constitutional provisions, the premier can ask the
president to dissolve the legislature only when the legislature
passes a no-confidence vote against the Cabinet -- a move that
hinders any easy solution to gridlock between the government's
executive and legislative branches.
</P>
<P>
KMT legislative whip Tseng Yung-chuan dismissed Hsieh's
suggestion as "nonsense, " claiming that the KMT's boycott was only a
temporary measure to press for a government response to a spate of
recent controversial cases.
</P>
<P>
Noting that Constitution requires the premier to deliver an
administrative report at the beginning of a new legislative session,
Tseng said it's Hsieh's official duty and cannot be a topic to be
subject to a legislative vote.
</P>
<P>
The "pan-blue alliance" originally proposed two prerequisites for
Hsieh to deliver the administrative report -- an apology from Hsieh
for alleged Kaohsiung mass rapid transit ( MRT) system construction
scandals and the DPP legislative caucus' consent to the establishment
of five legislative committees to look into five alleged corruption
cases.
</P>
<P>
Tseng said Sunday the KMT caucus would no longer demand Hsieh's
apology as a condition. "We would stop boycotting Hsieh's report so
long as the DPP agrees to the formation of the five committees to
obtain access to official files regarding the five controversial
cases," Tseng said.
</P>
<P>
However, the DPP caucus insisted that addressing the legislature
on the government's policy goals and work plans is the premier's
official duty set forth in the Constitution.
</P>
<P>
"This sacred mission cannot be traded off and no political
strings should be attached to it, " DPP legislative whip Chen
Ching-chun said, adding that the DPP caucus would not oppose the
formation of the five KMT-proposed committees if Premier Hsieh is
allowed to deliver an administrative report at Tuesday's plenary
session.
</P>
<P>
The five KMT-proposed committees are supposed to look into
suspected corruption in the construction projects of the Kaohsiung
rapid transit system and Taiwan's first high-speed railway, the
second phase of the government's financial reform plan, an insider
trading scandal involving a senior official charged with the duty of
preventing insider trading in the stock market, and the privatization
of state-run Chunghwa Telecom.

JAPAN URGED TO SPEAK FOR TAIWAN'S PLEA AT ONGOING U.N. SESSION
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Tokyo, Sept. 18 (CNA)
(By Amy Huang and Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Japan should voice its support for Taiwan's
plea for an active U.N. role in maintaining peace across the Taiwan
Strait, a Taiwan official stationed in Tokyo said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Chu Wen-ching, the information division chief at Taiwan's
representative office in Japan, made the call in a letter to the
editors of the Japan Times that was carried in the English-language
daily's Sunday issue.
</P>
<P>
In the letter, Chu said 13 of Taiwan's diplomatic allies sent a
letter to U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan Aug. 11 demanding that
the United Nations pay more heed and play an active role in ensuring
cross-strait peace.
</P>
<P>
Because of China's opposition, the proposal was not included in
the agenda of the ongoing plenary session of the U.N. General
Assembly that opened Sept. 13.
</P>
<P>
Since Japan has voiced support for Taiwan in many fields,
including Taiwan's bid to join the World Health Assembly -- the World
Health Organization's governing body -- as an observer and listing
the Taiwan Strait peace as one of the strategic objectives of the
U.S.-Japanese defense cooperation, Chu said he is hopeful that Japan
can uphold this consistent stance and speak out for Taiwan's cause at
the current U.N. General Assembly general debate session.
</P>
<P>
Chu said Japan's explicit support is important for Taiwan and for
regional peace and stability because China has stepped up its
military threat against Taiwan. The number of missiles deployed by
China against Taiwan has been increasing rapidly and China already
passed an anti-secession law that codifies the use of force against
Taiwan if it thinks Taiwan is moving toward formal independence, Chu
added.

PFP HEAD CALLS FOR DIRECT CROSS-STRAIT TRANSPORT LINKS

<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Sept.  18 (CNA)

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Opposition People First Party (PFP)
Chairman James Soong urged the government Sunday to forge direct
transport links across the Taiwan Strait as early as possible to
maintain Taiwan's global competitiveness.
</P>
<P>
Soong made the remarks upon his return from a trip to Shanghai to
attend a cross-strait economic forum, co-organized by the PFP and the
Communist Party of China.
</P>
<P>
Soong said he was originally scheduled to return to Taiwan via
the direct "mini three links" route, namely the direct shipping
services between Taiwan-held Kinmen/Matsu and China's Xiamen/Mawei in
Fujian province.
</P>
<P>
Due to a government ban, Soong said he dropped his original plan
and instead returned to Taiwan via Macau. Under current regulations,
only Taiwan businesspeople operating in China, known locally as
"taishang, " and residents in Kinmen and Matsu can use the direct
Kinmen-Xiamen and Matsu-Mawei shipping services.
</P>
<P>
Soong said the government should ease restrictions on the "mini
three links" and more importantly, forge full-fledged direct
cross-strait shipping and air links as early as possible.
</P>
<P>
Claiming that the decades-long indirect cross-strait travel
requirement has enhanced taishang's operational costs and undermined
Taiwan's global competitiveness, Soong said the Democratic
Progressive Party administration should not continue dragging its
foot on this critical issue.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, PFP Legislators Chang Hsien-yao and Huang Yi-chiao,
who accompanied Soong on his China visit, said they will push for a
law revision to allow for more people to travel via the "mini three
links" route and push for the opening of full-fledged direct
cross-strait transport links by the end of 2006.

MOFA DENIES REPORT ABOUT STATUS CHANGE OF NEW AIT BUILDING
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Sept.  18 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA)
debunked a media report Sunday that the ministry has changed the
status of a new building to be built by the American Institute in
Taiwan (AIT) so that the building will be exempted from Taiwan
regulations.
</P>
<P>
"The report is not true, " MOFA spokesman Michel Lu said, adding
that the MOFA is not authorized to administer construction affairs or
classify a building's status.
</P>
<P>
Lu said the AIT, which represents U.S. interests in Taiwan in the
absence of formal diplomatic ties, has not yet come up with any
blueprint for its planned building nor has it presented an
application for the construction project.
</P>
<P>
Since the plot of land to accommodate the new AIT building
belongs to Taiwan, Lu said, the construction project definitely
should follow Taiwan's regulations, including environmental
protection and public safety requirements.
</P>
<P>
According to Lu, the AIT construction project will not get under
way until after the U.S. Congress appropriates funds in 2007.
</P>
<P>
AIT, which was founded under the terms of the Taiwan Relations
Act -- the U.S. law governing relations with Taiwan in the absence of

RESPECT FOR TAIWAN'S SOVEREIGNTY BASIS FOR CROSS-STRAIT TALKS: ENVOY

<TEXT>
<P>
Peace talks across the Taiwan Strait
should be based on respect for Taiwan's sovereign status, the
Republic of China's representative to Germany said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Shieh Jhy-wey made the remarks in a seminar with German scholars
broadcast on Radio Berlin-Brandenburg's Inforadio.
</P>
<P>
Shieh, who obtained a PhD in German literature at the Ruhr
University in Bochum in Germany in 1987, told his audience that all
Taiwan people, regardless of their political stripes or preferences
and ethnic origins, treasure their hard-won democratic system and
lifestyle.
</P>
<P>
Noting that Taiwan opposes China's despotic political system,
Shieh said Taiwan would be willing to sit down to talk with China
whenever China forsakes its military threat and respects Taiwan's
sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
With Taiwan's successful democratization, Shieh said the people
of Taiwan yearn to be treated fairly and equally in the international
community.
</P>
<P>
Because of China's suppression, Shieh said Taiwan faces
diplomatic isolation. As Germany does not recognize Taiwan, Shieh
said he has had to make strenuous efforts to overcome many
difficulties forging contacts with German officials and
parliamentarians since assuming his current post in May.
</P>
<P>
During those engagements, Shieh said he found that more efforts
must be made to let Germans understand Taiwan's stance.

New Executive Yuan Secretary-General Cho
Jung-tai said Monday that he hopes Premier Frank Hsieh can deliver

Tuesday.

NEW CLA HEAD VOWS TO THOROUGHLY REVIEW FOREIGN LABORERS POLICY
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Sept. 19 (CNA)
(By P.C.Tang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The new chairman of the Council of Labor
Affairs promised Monday that he will do his utmost to protect both
foreign and local laborers' rights and interests.
</P>
<P>
Lee Ying-yuan, former secretary-general of the Executive Yuan,
made the promise in an interview with the Central News Agency after
taking up his new post earlier in the day.
</P>
<P>
According to Lee, the top priorities of his new job are carrying
out a thorough review of Taiwan's foreign laborers policy and pushing
the Legislative Yuan to pass a bill to set up an organization aimed
at monitoring and dealing with a fund for retired workers as these
matters are related to the rights and interests of more than one
million laborers on the island.
</P>
<P>
Lee, who has also served as a legislator, secretary-general of
the ruling Democratic Progressive Party and ROC vice representative
to the United States, takes over for former CLA Chairwoman Chen Chu
who stepped down over the Aug. 21 riot by Thai laborers working for
Kaohsiung Rapid Transit System (KRTS).
</P>
<P>
Talking about the riot story, the new CLA head also promised that
he will visit those Thai laborers now working for the KRTS as soon as
possible as "one should stand up from the place where one falls
down," he added.
</P>
<P>
"The riot is an individual case and a case related to human
rights as well," Lee further said, stressing that he and his council
will conduct a thorough review of the island's foreign laborers
policy, including the quality, quantity and brokerage system
concerning the hiring of foreign workers.
</P>
<P>
Promising that he will try to amend the nation's employment and
service law to improve employers' treatment of foreign workers, Lee
said that if an employer does not properly manage and take care of
his or her labor force's living arrangements and conditions, he or
she will face criminal prosecution.
</P>
<P>
Lee also said that he will adjust part of the council's agencies'
work in order to improve the management and inspection of the council
over the employment process and living conditions of foreign
laborers.
</P>
<P>
Claiming that one of his top priorities is to protect local
workers' interests and rights, Lee said that the retired workers fund
will soon amount to NT$10 billion and that he will discuss the issue
with the opposition political parties in a bid to push for the
legislature to pass the bill relating to the establishment of an
organization overseeing the operation of the pension fund.

MOFA SIGNS COOPERATIVE PACT WITH MERCY CORPS ON AID TO IRAQ
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>

(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA)
signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) with the Mercy Corps
Monday on the second phase of an information technology aid program
in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Yang Maysing, director of MOFA's Research and Planning Board,
signed the agreement with Xu Dan, Mercy Corps' Asia-Pacific chief
executive officer, on behalf of the two sides.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Foreign Affairs Tan Sun Chen said Taiwan wants to
show the world through this program its determination to give back
what it has received from the international community in the course
of its development.
</P>
<P>
"The aid program is also aimed at conveying our sincere
friendship to the Iraqi people," Chen said.
</P>
<P>
During a recent United Nations summit meeting, Chen said, many
world leaders called for aid to these people based on
humanitarianism. Even though Taiwan has been barring from the United
Nations for more than three decades, Chen said, Taiwan has never
hesitated to offer humanitarian aid to needy countries.
</P>
<P>
In cooperation with Mercy Corps, Taiwan has assisted in setting
up computer classrooms in Khanaqin, which lies northeast of Baghdad.
and building a public Internet networking service center in the
region as the first phase of the aid program.
</P>
<P>
MOFA officials said that in the second phase, Taiwan will assist
in completing computer networking services at 14 junior and senior
high schools in Khanaqin and its education ministry where
Taiwan-financed computer classrooms have been established.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the officials said, Taiwan will help with a manpower
training program for teachers and students at the Taiwan-financed
public Internet networking service center so that they can run the
center on their own in the future.
</P>
<P>
Two Iraqi youths traveled to Taipei last December to attend a
presentation on Taiwan's aid program and post-war relief work in
Iraq. They also conveyed Khanaqin citizens' gratitude for Taiwan's
assistance.
</P>
<P>
Since the public networking center was completed in January this
year, the officials said, Iraqi students have regularly exchanged
e-mails with their Taiwan counterparts at 10 junior and senior high
schools recommended by the Ministry of Education.
</P>
<P>
Mercy Corps is a noted U.S.-based non-governmental and
not-for-profit organization dedicated to humanitarian aid and
development activities. Taiwan has been cooperating with it in
carrying out post-war aid programs in Iraq since 2003.

INDEPENDENT LAWMAKER LI AO DEPARTS FOR CHINA VISIT
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Sept. 19 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Independent Legislator Li Ao departed for
China via Hong Kong for a 12-day visit Monday.
</P>
<P>
Li, also a prolific writer, historian and TV commentator, is
being accompanied by his 12-year-old son as well as 300 books on his
first return to Beijing since leaving the city 57 years ago at the
age of 13.
</P>
<P>
He said the trip will mainly be to speak at three noted
universities -- Peking University, Tsinghua University and Fudan
University -- and attend seminars.
</P>
<P>
He wouldn't divulge the contents of his speeches, saying only
that if he revealed them, Beijing authorities wouldn't let him speak.
</P>
<P>
"I love Taiwan and will definitely speak for the island," Li Ao
said.
</P>
<P>
Peking University will be the highlight of Li's trip, and as his
father Li Ting-yi is a graduate of the prestigious university, the
school has decided to roll out the red carpet for the "outstanding
son" of its distinguished alumnus.
</P>
<P>
Li is also expected to visit his daughter, born out of wedlock,
in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Asked to comment on cross-strait relations in an interview with a
local newspaper, Li said that he would advise Beijing that "the issue
will require time, rather than the saber-rattling of deploying
missiles against Taiwan."
</P>
<P>
"After all, Taiwan has been separated from the mainland for 110
years since it was seceded to Japan in 1895," he added.
</P>
<P>
On why he has not thought about revisiting the mainland for more
than half a century, Li said that at first, it was the Kuomintang
which wouldn't allow him to go, and then it was the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party, and then it "became a habit of not returning."
</P>
<P>
Recently, he said, it has been his health that has prevented him
from making the visit, noting that his right leg hasn't felt right
and that he has brought a walking stick, given to him by former
lawmaker Sisy Chen, along for the trip.
</P>
<P>
Lee said that he had originally planned to return to Beijing
after the age of 80, but Liu Changle, chairman and CEO of Phoenix TV,
who has helped arrange the trip to China, persuaded him to make an
earlier visit lest he become too fragile by the age of 80.
</P>
<P>
Reports have said that Li, who is often called "master" because
of his extensive knowledge gained from reading and who has gained
notoriety for litigation and his biting criticism of political
figures, has polarized his prospective audiences on the mainland.
His fans in China have begun to whip up "Li fever" through heated
discussion about him on Web sites even before his arrival.

CROP PRODUCTION PROFILE KEY TO UPGRADING AGRICULTURE: PRESIDENT
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Sept.  19 (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President Chen Shui-bian pointed out
Monday that keeping a good crop production profile is critical for
upgrading Taiwan's agriculture, a step that will help differentiate
Taiwan's farm products from those of China and Southeast Asian
countries.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a training program for executives of farmers' and
fishermen's associations, the president urged crop and fish farmers
to help the government implement the crop production profile system
as quality and safety are increasingly replacing price as key
requirements on the market.
</P>
<P>
Chen said Japan and the European Union have already been
implementing the crop production profile system, with Japan planning
to ban the import of all farm products starting in 2010 whose
production processes are not properly profiled.
</P>
<P>
As Japan is the largest export market for Taiwan's farm products,
the president said Taiwan must prepare well to meet that requirement.
</P>
<P>
The Council of Agriculture (COA) initiated a sample program in
2004 to list 74 agricultural products in the crop production profile
system to ensure farm-to-table safety.
</P>
<P>
Chen said building a system is often an arduous and difficult
process, but this is a path that Taiwan must walk as the system has a
great bearing on Taiwan's agricultural future.
</P>
<P>
He called on the government, producers' associations and farmers
to work together in implementing the crop production profile system
as a critical step to boost the nation's agricultural
competitiveness.
</P>
<P>
He said he is confident, like this year's "champion rice" grower
Lin Lung-hsing, in the future development of Taiwan's agriculture.
</P>
<P>
Lin is an aboriginal rice farmer in Chihshang town, Taitung
County, what Chen calls "a minority among the minorities." But Chen
said Lin worked very hard and ingeniously to improve his crop,
eventually winning this year's championship, enabling him to get
NT$11,000 ( US$332) per kilogram. Regular rice goes for about NT$30
per kilo.
</P>
<P>
But on the downside, the president called on farmers not to
repeat what a minority of fish farmers have been suspected of doing
-- using banned chemicals to raise gropers -- that could damage a
whole industry.
</P>
<P>
He asked the COA to get to the bottom of the reported violations
and ferret out the suspects so they will not damage the reputation of
Taiwan's fish farming industry.
</P>
<P>
"We can never allow a few people's illegal acts to cause major
damage to the law-abiding majority," he stressed.

MILITARY MAINTENANCE BUDGET REDUCTION A CONCERN: PFP LAWMAKER
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Sept. 19 (CNA)
(By P.C. Tang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An opposition People First Party lawmaker
on Monday questioned the government's policy of spending less money
on the maintenance of military equipment as "this policy will place
military personnel in an unsafe environment."
</P>
<P>
According to Lin Yu-fang, although President Chen Shui-bian has
promised publicly that the government will increase the nation's
defense budget, the fact is that the government has gradually reduced
military spending since the Democratic Progressive Party became
the ruling party in 2000.
</P>
<P>
The legislator said at a press conference held earlier in the day
that Chen promised to increase the national defense budget to 3
percent of the gross domestic product (GDP) within the coming three
years; however, the budget introduced by the government for fiscal
2005 only reaches 2.42 percent of GDP, or a record low for defense
spending ever introduced by the Cabinet.
</P>
<P>
Saying that the current national defense budget pays more heed to
the purchase of sophisticated arms rather than the maintenance of old
weapons and equipment, Lin said that this exposes the Ministry of
National Defense's shortcomings of "attaching great importance to
arms procurement and neglecting logistic services in the rear."
</P>
<P>
He further said that the spending on the purchase of spare parts
of military equipment has sharply been cut due to the proposed
purchase of Patriot III anti-missile batteries which has been
included in the annual budget plan of the ministry.
</P>
<P>
Spending on spare parts in 2006 will be reduced by nearly NT$1.3
billion, or a decrease of 12 percent from the level of the previous
year, the legislator said, adding that the budget introduced by the
ministry for the procurement of various armed vehicles and spare
parts of 18 kinds of military equipment in 2006 will also be cut
NT$360 million, or a decrease of 20 percent from the level of 2005,
which will certainly deteriorate the maintenance capability of the
military.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, as the ministry has decided to spend less in
resolving the problems related to the storage of ammunition and the
handling of useless ammunition, who dares to store ammunition in
depots? Lin asked.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the government has repeatedly accused the "pan-blue
alliance" of neglecting the nation's security, the legislator,
however, said that actually, it is the government itself who turns a
blind eye to the maintenance of military equipment and cuts gradually
the budget for national defense.
</P>
<P>
The lawmaker also condemned the government for forcing
military personnel into an unsafe situation and requested Lee Jye,
minister of national defense, clearly explain why his ministry cannot
get a sufficient budget from the government for spending on the
purchase of arms and on the maintenance of old equipment.

MOE ENCOURAGES STUDENTS TO CONDUCT OVERSEAS FIELD TRIPS
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Sept. 19 (CNA)
(By Elizabeth Hsu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Ministry of Education (MOE) has been
encouraging local high school students to embark on overseas field
trips in recent years with a view to enriching their knowledge and
fostering global perspectives.
</P>
<P>
As part of the drive, the ministry organized a delegation of high
school principals, teachers and administrators to conduct a
fact-finding visit to Japan earlier this month to gain a better
understanding of the possibility of having high school field trips in
the country.
</P>
<P>
Japan, with its preservation of traditional culture, is regarded
as one of the best places for high school trips, besides South Korea,
Saudi Arabia and Germany, according to members of the delegation that
visited Japan Sept. 10-15.
</P>
<P>
The 75-member team was headed by Liu Yung-shun, chairman of the
Taiwan International Association for Education Tours and the
principal of Tamshui Vocational High School. The delegation was made
up of principals, teachers and executive officials of around 70 high
schools and vocational high schools around Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
The group, divided into five teams, made separate visits to
Hokkaido, Fukushima, Chiba, Yamanash, and Shinshu prefectures. Liu
said Monday that they were warmly greeted wherever they went.
</P>
<P>
Japan's long-term effort to preserve the ancient culture adopted
by their ancestors is a good thing for Taiwanese students to learn,
Liu said, noting that in the long run, more will be done to encourage
youths to go on study tours to Japan.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, some members said their schools have long forged
sisterhood relationships with high schools in many other countries,
including South Korea, Germany and Saudi Arabia. Exchanges of visits
by students and teachers with those schools have been on the rise in
the past few years, they added.

ROC VICE DEFENSE MINISTER TO ATTEND CONFERENCE IN U.S.
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Los Angeles,  Sept.  18 (CNA)
(By Chu Lu-sheng and Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Republic of China Vice Minister of
National Defense Huo Shou-yeh said Sunday in Los Angeles that he will
communicate with U.S. officials on contentious parts of Taiwan's arms
procurement package when he attends the fourth U.S.-Taiwan national
defense industry conference that will open in San Diego, California
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Huo was referring to the long-stalled package comprising three
big-ticket weaponry items -- eight diesel-electric submarines, a
squadron of 12 P-3C anti-submarine aircraft and six Patriot PAC III
anti-missile batteries.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan's opposition-controlled Legislative Yuan has blocked the
passage of the package for over a year because opposition lawmakers
say the price is too high and that it should be listed under the
regular budget rather than a special one.
</P>
<P>
Huo, at the head of a delegation attending the conference, said
that as the U. S.-Taiwan Business Council, sponsor of the meeting, is 
a non-governmental organization, the disscussions will also be 
non-official.
</P>
<P>
The two-day meeting will focus on the study of the current
situation of U.S.-Taiwan military cooperation and the outlook of
Taiwan's future defense needs, Rupert Hammond-Chambers, president of
the U.S.-Taiwan Business Council, said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
More than 100 people are expected to take part in the conference,
including scholars and academics from think tanks of the United
States and Taiwan, military specialists in charge of military
cooperation as well as weapons researchers and military officials.
</P>
<P>
But Hammond-Chambers revealed that Richard Lawless, US Deputy
Undersecretary of Defense, will not be able to attend the conference
because he was preoccupied with the six-party talks on North Korea.
</P>
<P>
When Lawless spoke in the previous conference in Phoenix,
Arizona, in 2004, he urged Taiwan's legislators across the party
spectrum to support the arms procurement to show the country's 
determination to defend itself.
</P>
<P>
Edward Ross, a director of the Defense Security Cooperation
Agency under the Department of Defense, will attend on his behalf.
Ross will also read a speech prepared by Lawless.
</P>
<P>
Hammond-Chambers explained that he also invited Ho Szu-yin,
director of overseas department of the opposition Kuomintang, to the
conference to learn about the party's national security policy.
</P>
<P>
He also pointed out that the conference has in fact no direct
relations with Taiwan's arms procurement package.
</P>
<P>
The issues to be discussed in the conference will be to explore
the national defense needs of Taiwan through the perspective of
professionals, adding that selling or supplying sophisticated weapons
is only an option by U.S. industry, and Taiwan will have the final
say.
</P>
<P>
Though Hammond-Chambers will visit Taiwan in mid-October, he said
that his purpose will be different from a group of U.S. congressmen.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Congressman Rob Simmons (R.-Conn.) is arranging the delegation,
which will mainly be comprised of members of the Committee on
Armed Forces of the U.S. House of Representatives.
</P>
<P>
The delegation will come for Double Ten National Day celebration
activities on Oct. 10 and will meet with legislators to discuss the
long-stalled arms procurement.

NEW CLA CHIEF PROMISES CHANGES IN FOREIGN LABOR POLICY
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Sept.  19 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The new head of the Council of Labor
Affairs (CLA) vowed Monday to review the government's foreign labor
policy and asserted that a recent Thai workers' riot will not hinder
relations between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Lee Ying-yuan, the new CLA chairman who took over the post from
his predecessor, Chen Chu, earlier the same day after he stepped down
as secretary-general of the Executive Yuan, made the remarks during
an exclusive interview with the Central News Agency following the
changeover ceremony.
</P>
<P>
Stressing that bilateral ties will not be impacted by the protest
staged Aug. 21 by Thai laborers working on the construction of the
Kaohsiung mass rapid train system in southern Taiwan, Lee pledged to
make adequate foreign labor policy adjustments to deal with possible
consequences of the incident -- the first of its kind in Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
A policy overhaul will be the top priority on the CLA agenda
under his leadership, Lee said, adding that the council will invite
scholars, labor groups and government officials to debate possible
changes next month at the earliest.
</P>
<P>
In terms of foreign labor management, the CLA will revise the
Employment Service Act to include foreign workers in its scope and a
draft plan will be put forward in two weeks, he said.
</P>
<P>
Turning to the question of whether foreign laborers should enjoy
the minimum wage protection as Taiwan workers do -- NT$15,840
(US$480) per month since 1997, he called it a controversial issue
that must be comprehensively discussed by all parties concerned.
</P>
<P>
According to Lee, the Thai government fully understands that
Taiwan is the top choice of many Thai laborers willing to work
overseas and that the Thai worker riot over poor living and working
conditions was only an isolated case which was the result of poor
management.
</P>
<P>
To help other countries better realize that Taiwan is a country
where rights and interests of migrant workers are duly protected, Lee
said that the CLA in the future will invite foreign diplomats or
labor affairs officials stationed in Taiwan to visit their countrymen
working here.
</P>
<P>
Lee also said that he will consider visiting some countries that
have allowed their laborers to work in Taiwan to boost mutual
communications and exchanges, citing his rich experience in foreign
affairs.
</P>
<P>
Currently, there are more than 278,000 migrant workers in Taiwan,
with some 94,000, or 34 percent of the total, coming from Thailand.
Taiwan is the world's largest importer of Thai workers.

<P>
Premier Frank Hsieh met Monday with the
heads of the financial and economic ministries along with about 40
representatives of the National Association of Small and Medium
Enterprises and the Taiwan Federation of Industry to develop better
communication channels.
</P>
<P>
The afternoon tea event, to be held every three months, was
formed based on the model of breakfast meetings between the National
Association of Industry and Commerce and Cabinet officials.
</P>
<P>
Besides Hsieh, the officials joining the tea meeting included
Vice Premier Wu Rong-i, secretary-general to the premier Cho
Jung-tai, Deputy Central Bank of China Governor Hsu Yi-hsiung,
Minister of Economic Affairs Ho Mei-yueh, Minister of the Council for
Economic Planning and Development (CEPD) Hu Sheng-cheng, Vice
Minister of the CEPD Thomas Yeh, Vice Minister of the Council of
Labor Affairs Lai Chi-lin and Deputy Director-General of the Finance
Supervisory Commission Lu Tung-min.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the meeting, the premier joked that the number of
officials in charge of financial and economic affairs attending the
event was larger than that for legislative meetings. He thanked them
for the opportunity to be able to "reach the podium without having
first to build five commissions, " referring to the opposition
Kuomintang's boycott of his administrative report to the legislature
last week.
</P>
<P>
Hsieh stated that he respects the work done by small- and
medium-sized enterprises and the contributions they have made to
Taiwan's economic development. Since taking the helm of the Cabinet
Feb. 1, he has never stopped thinking of ways to support and
encourage the development of these businesses.
</P>
<P>
"Only those who are in the business know where the problems are,
"he said, noting that the government is very willing to hear from the
enterprises themselves about what challenges they are facing.

Taichung Mayor Jason Hu received
preliminary approval of the Ministry of the Interior to attend the
2005 Asia Pacific Cities Summit in Chungqing, western China, in
October, but the final decision will be made at an inter-ministerial
meeting called by the ministry at the end of this month, Taichung City
officials said Monday.
</P>
<P>
There are 122 cities outside China that have expressed interest
in taking part in the summit scheduled for Oct. 11-15, and 75 cities
have confirmed that they will send representatives, including six
from Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan, according to the summit's Chinese
organizers.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Taichung City Council resolved Monday that Hu
should get its approval before departing for the summit although he
is under no legal obligation to do so.
</P>
<P>
Hu, who served as the country's foreign minister between 1977 and
1999, said he has not decided to attend the summit, although his aide
is applying for the MOI's permission.
</P>
<P>
Hu who is seeking re-election in the December election, said as a
candidate, he prefers to stay in Taichung to manage his campaign
rather than visit China, but as head of the city, he should help
enhance the city's profile on the international stage by attending
the summit in Chungqing.

Although he didn't say explicitly whether he would go to
Chungqing for the summit, he said he would give the city's interests

KMT ACCUSES PRESIDENT OF BRIBERY IN MIAOLI ELECTION CAMPAIGN
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Sept.  19 (CNA)
(By Han Nai-kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Monday
accused President Chen Shui-bian of using bribery in an attempt to
help the candidate of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)
running for the post of Miaoli county magistrate in the Dec. 3
election.
</P>
<P>
Chen visited Miaoli County Sunday and met with County Magistrate
Fu Hsueh-peng. News reports quoted a DPP legislator present at the
meeting as saying that Chen promised to offer Fu an important
position in the central government at the end of his second term as
Miaoli magistrate if he is willing to help Miaoli Mayor Chiu
Ping-kun win the year-end election to become his successor.
</P>
<P>
Fu, who was kicked out of the KMT prior the 1997 election,
defeated the KMT's incumbent county magistrate in that election as an
independent. He was re-elected in 2001. According to law, he can
serve a maximum of two terms.
</P>
<P>
Reacting to the news reports, the KMT caucus in the legislature
described the president's quid pro quo for Fu's cooperation in the
election as "real proof of bribery" and urged the State Public
Prosecutor-General's Office to take action.
</P>
<P>
The KMT caucus pointed out that Article 17 of the "Examples of
Bribery in Elections" published by the Prosecutor-General's Office
Aug. 11 describes one of the bribery acts as "offering or finding
someone a job opportunity or better position" in an attempt to affect
the election results.
</P>
<P>
KMT spokeswoman Cheng Li-wen said it would be unfair for the
president to use national resources as a tool or reward to help
candidates of his own party get elected.
</P>
<P>
However, the DPP legislative caucus attempted to defend Chen,
claiming that he was acknowledging Fu's good performance as Miaoli
county magistrate and offered to place him in an appropriate post
should an opportunity present itself. According to the DPP caucus,
this should not be "confused" with election bribery.
</P>
<P>
The Presidential Office public relations department later issued
a statement saying that the president was hoping to put talent to
good use in the government and that his offer had "nothing to do with
bribery."

OUTLYING ISLANDS IDEAL FOR CROSS-STRAIT FREE TRADE ZONE: PFP
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei, Sept. 19 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The establishment of a cross-Taiwan Strait
free trade zone is a complex issue, but the government can take the
initiative by using Taiwan's outlying islands to set the stage,
according to a key official of the opposition People First Party
(PFP).
</P>
<P>
Chang Hsien-yao, director of the PFP's policy center, made the
remark Sunday during a stopover at Xiamen airport on his return to
Taiwan after having taken part in a cross-strait economic forum
co-sponsored by the PFP and the Communist Party of China (CPC) in
Shanghai -- the first of its kind between a Taiwan political party
and the CPC. PFP Chairman James Soong also participated.
</P>
<P>
Citing a conclusion reached during the forum, Chang said that the
two parties share a common aspiration that a cross-strait "golden
triangle" -- a free trade zone linking Taipei, Shanghai and Hong Kong
-- should be set up for the benefit of all.
</P>
<P>
According to Chang, it would be easier to crystallize the
cross-strait free trade zone idea by starting with the islands of
Kinmen, Matsu and Penghu, in part due to the complexity of the matter
and in part to help boost economic development in those areas.
</P>
<P>
At present, there are no direct airlinks between Taipei and
Shanghai and the PFP is trying hard to help promote direct
point-to-point flights in the initial stage with the aim of pushing
cross-strait direct three links legislation through the Legislative
Yuan by the end of 2006, Chang said.
</P>
<P>
Present-day economic relations across the strait are so close
that they go "far beyond the imagination" of the people in Taiwan, he
claimed, urging the government to place more emphasis on economics
than politics. It also was the major reason behind the PFP's decision
to hold the Shanghai forum with the Chinese, despite the
long-standing political gridlock between Taiwan and China, he said.
</P>
<P>
The PFP is Taiwan's third-largest political party, and Soong paid
what he described as a "bridge-making" trip to China in early May in
the hope of helping bring Taiwan and China closer -- rivals since
1949 when the island split from China following a civil war.

<TEXT>
<P>
Senior Presidential Advisor Ye Chu-lan,
who is scheduled to become acting mayor of Kaohsiung City next week,
assured the International World Games Association (IWGA) Monday that
the city will make the 2009 World Games a big success.
</P>
<P>
She told Peter Orzo, deputy executive director of the
coordination group between the IWGA and the host city, that hosting
the 2009 Games is a key administrative goal of the city government,
that she is determined to see the games take place and that she
will do her part well.
</P>
<P>
Orzo, deputy executive director of the Organizing Committee of
the World Games 2005 in Duisburg, Germany, was visiting Kaohsiung at
the invitation of Chen Yi-heng, executive director of the Kaohsiung
Games Organizing Committee.
</P>
<P>
Orzo suggested that Yeh herself take over Chen's job when she
becomes acting mayor next Monday, since in that position she will be
more able to manage all aspects of the 2009 Games.
</P>
<P>
He also reminded her of the summer heat that could hit the city
when the 2009 Games are held from July 16-26. Two other problems that
she might have to consider are traffic in the city and training
volunteers for the games.
</P>
<P>
Yeh accepted all his suggestions and promised that she will see
to it that construction of all related facilities are completed on
schedule and that the questions of traffic and volunteers are solved
so that the games will be successful.

PRESIDENT ASKED PFP CHAIRMAN TO RELAY MESSAGE TO CHINESE PRESIDENT
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Sept.  19 (CNA)
(By Han Nai-kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President Chen Shui-bian asked James
Soong, chairman of the opposition People First Party (PFP) to relay a
message to Chinese President Hu Jintao in May, but the message was
not about trying to resume the dialogue between Taiwan and China
through a "flexible" explanation of what constitutes "one China," the
Presidential Office said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Chen Wen-tsung, director of the Presidential Office public
relations department, made the statement to discount a previous claim
announced Sept. 16 by James Huang, a Presidential Office deputy
secretary-general, that the president had not asked Soong to pass any
message to Hu.
</P>
<P>
The PR director would not disclose what was in the message,
saying only that it was not, as U.S. State Department senior adviser
James R. Keith said in a testimony at a congressional hearing, that
Chen was willing to engage in dialogue with Beijing using a flexible
formulation about what constitutes "one China."
</P>
<P>
"The Presidential Office never mentioned to the U.S. side about
the president asking Soong to pass a message to China," he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, PFP Legislator Chang Hsien-yao, speaking on behalf of
Soong, said the U.S. State Department official told the truth but
that the picture he presented was "not clear enough."
</P>
<P>
Chang explained that Soong agreed to meet with the president in
February because the latter did try to modify his definition of "one
China." Furthermore, he added, their conclusion at the meeting
affirmed that the conduct of cross-Taiwan Strait relations should be
based on the Constitution of the Republic of China, which provides
that there is only one China.

MAC PUBLISHES PAMPHLET IN SIMPLIFIED CHINESE CHARACTERS
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  Sept.  19  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Mainland Affairs Council (MAC)
released Monday an illustrated pamphlet in simplified Chinese
characters detailing the olive branches Taiwan has offered to China.
</P>
<P>
It marked the first time the government has ever issued a
publication in simplified characters, which are officially used in
China.
</P>
<P>
MAC Chairman Joseph Wu said during an informal meeting with local
journalists that the simplified characters version will be
distributed to Chinese visitors to Taiwan as well as to Taiwan's
representative offices in Hong Kong and Macau and local organizations
with close exchanges with China, such as the quasi-official Straits
Exchange Foundation.
</P>
<P>
The illustrated brochure recounts the 30 olive branches that
President Chen Shui-bian has extended to China since he assumed
office in May 2000, including his now famous "five noes" basic stance
on relations across the Taiwan Strait, Wu said.
</P>
<P>
Noting that goodwill, cooperation and permanent peace constitute
the gist of the government's cross-strait policy, Wu said it is hoped
that the new publication can help people in China to better
understand Taiwan's basic position.
</P>
<P>
Wu said the publication also has an English edition, titled
"Taipei's Olive Branches, " which will be provided to foreign
visitors to Taiwan as well as to Taiwan's overseas offices.

PRESIDENT HAILS CANADIAN PM'S REMARKS AGAINST USE OF FORCE
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Sept. 19 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President Chen Shui-bian said Monday that
the Republic of China government and people are grateful for Canadian
Prime Minister Paul Martin's recent remarks that Canada is staunchly
opposed to China's threats to use force against Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
"We admire Martin's concern and support for Taiwan when he told
Chinese President Hu Jintao during Hu's recent visit to Canada that
despite its 'one China' policy, Canada firmly opposes China using
force against Taiwan, " Chen said while meeting with a Canadian
parliamentary delegation.
</P>
<P>
Chen also hailed a proposed Taiwan Affairs Act being screened in
the Canadian parliament. The bill, initiated by Jim Abbot, a member
of parliament of the opposition Conservative Party, passed its first
reading in April.
</P>
<P>
The proposed bill aims to "provide for an improved framework for
economic, trade, cultural and other initiatives between the people of
Canada and the people of Taiwan."
</P>
<P>
"We welcome any legislation that would contribute to the
expansion of substantive Taiwan-Canadian relations, " Chen said,
adding that he would be very happy and grateful if the bill finally
clears the Canadian parliamentary floor.
</P>
<P>
Chen also took the occasion to express his gratitude for the
Canadian parliament's passage of resolutions in 2003 and 2005
supporting Taiwan's bid to join the World Health Assembly -- the
World Health Organization's decision-making body -- as an observer.
Because of Beijing's opposition, Taiwan has so far been barred from
the world health regulatory body.
</P>
<P>
Stressing that disease knows no borders, Chen said Taiwan should
not be excluded from the global epidemic-fighting network.
</P>
<P>
Over the past two years, Chen noted, about 20 of Taiwan's central
government department heads and Cabinet members have visited Canada,
indicating that high-level exchanges between the two countries are
cordial.
</P>
<P>
Chen further pointed out that a Canadian court verdict once ruled
that Taiwan is an independent sovereign state and immune to foreign
criminal charges.
</P>
<P>
He also cited a number of official figures to prove close
Taiwan-Canada ties -- Taiwan is Canada's seventh-largest source of
tourists, with some 150,000 Taiwan people visiting Canada annually.
Taiwan is Canada's 11th largest-trading partner and its
fourth-largest in Asia, while 15,000 Taiwan students are now pursuing
academic degrees in Canada.
</P>
<P>
Chen said he hopes bilateral commercial exchanges and cooperation
in various fields can continue to grow.

KMT TO STOP OBSTRUCTION OF PREMIER'S REPORT IN LEGISLATURE
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Sept. 19 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The legislative caucus of the opposition
Kuomintang (KMT) said late Monday that they will end their attempts
to stop Premier Frank Hsieh giving his administrative report in the
Legislative Yuan Tuesday, and seek a condemnation of the premier by
the Rules Committee of the premier.
</P>
<P>
After fruitless negotiations earlier that day with their
counterparts from the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) on a
compromise to stop their obstruction tactics at the legislature,
Tseng Yung-chuan, the director of the KMT's Central Policy
Coordination Committee, claimed that the party's demands to set up
five committees at the Legislative Yuan to probe five "scandals"
involving the administration have already won the support "of the
whole people."
</P>
<P>
Instead of continuing their obstruction of the premier's report,
Tseng said his caucus will motion to condemn the premier at the Rules
Committee Tuesday, and will grill the premier during the question
time after his report about his responsibility for the irregularities
arising from the construction of Kaohsiung Mass Rapid Transit System.
</P>
<P>
He also took the chance to dig at his DPP counterparts in the
legislature, saying that they asked for a meeting with the KMT caucus
to work out a compromise to end the KMT's obstruction, but failed to
show up, "bearing out the fact that they had no intention of ending
the impasse at all."
</P>
<P>
Lawmaker Sun Ta-chien, the deputy whip of the opposition People
First Party caucus at the legislature, said his caucus supports the
KMT's decision, as the KMT has already made a point of stressing the
premier's role in the Kaohsiung scandal.
</P>
<P>
The KMT's decision came after KMT Chairman Ma Ying-jeou said
earlier that day that the party caucus should "stop its obstruction
tactics after achieving its goal."
</P>
<P>
The KMT caucus has succeeded in preventing the premier from
delivering his report ever since the legislature began its session
Sept. 13, demanding that the premier first apologize for his
"groundless accusation" of the KMT concerning the Kaohsiung Mass
Rapid Transit System and demanding the formation of investigation
committees to look into five "scandals" involving the premier's
administration.
</P>
<P>
The premier refused to bow to their pressure, claiming that it is
his constitutional and non-negotiable right to present an oral report
to the legislature.
</P>
<P>
Owing to the political impasse, the legislature ground to a halt,
causing a public outcry, but nether the opposition nor the premier
would budge until the KMT's about-face.
</P>
<P>
The premier said after the KMT's announcement that he would like
to field the opposition's questions about the Kaohsiung Mass Rapid
Transit System, as it will be a good chance to set the facts
straight.
</P>
<P>
The premier, who served as the mayor of Kaohsiung City from 1998
to 2005, claimed that many criticisms of the system stemmed from
misunderstandings and baseless allegations, adding he is sure his
answers will help the public understand the truth.

<P>
A Taiwan Trade Center, to be
founded by the Taipei-based Taiwan External Trade Development Council
(TAITRA) , will be inaugurated in Bangkok Oct. 3, a Taiwan economic
official posted here said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Kao Li-ming, the chief economic official at the Taiwan
representative office in Bangkok, said the inauguration would be the
culmination of a year of efforts by TAITRA, which has been exploring
the possibility of opening a trade office in Bangkok since last year.
</P>
<P>
Kao said the trade center has got the greenlight from the Thai
Foreign Ministry and Trade Ministry and will help Taiwan businessmen
to break into the Thailand market.
</P>
<P>
He predicted that bilateral trade between Taiwan and Thailand,
which stood at US$11 billion last year, will increase significantly
with the opening of the trade center in Bangkok.
</P>
<P>
TAITRA is spearheading Taiwan's efforts to tap the markets of
Association of Southeast Asia Nations (ASEAN) after ASEAN announced a
program to phase out tariffs among its members and establish a free
trade zone along with China, Japan and South Korea, Kao went on.
</P>
<P>
In light of the fact that ASEAN boasts a quarter of the world's
population, Kao said TAITRA is working to open trade centers in
Indonesia and Malaysia, two other ASEAN states.

AIT HONORARY CHAIR TO GREET ROC PRESIDENT DURING STOPOVER: STATE DEPT.
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Washington,  Sept. 19 (CNA)
(By Oliver Lin and P.C.Tang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The U.S. State Department on Monday
clearly defined President Chen Shui-bian's upcoming transit stop in
the United States as a "private and unofficial" matter and said that
the honorary chairman of the American Institute in Taiwan (AIT) will
welcome Taiwan's head of state upon his arrival.
</P>
<P>
The president is scheduled to arrive in Miami Sept. 20 for a
two-day stopover on his way to Central America. He is also scheduled
to make a short transit stop in San Francisco Sept. 29 en route back
to Taipei.
</P>
<P>
"I would note that President Chen's activities while he is in the
United States will be private and unofficial, consistent with the
purposes of the transit, " State Department deputy spokesman Adam
Ereli said at a press briefing.
</P>
<P>
Pointing out that when Washington receives requests for transit
stopovers, it evaluates the requests on the basis of certain
criteria, including safety, comfort and convenience of the traveler
and respecting the traveler's dignity, Ereli said that "on that
basis, we approved this request for transit."
</P>
<P>
He also said that Chen will be greeted upon arrival in the United
States by the honorary chairman of the AIT, which is the private
organization that carries out U.S. unofficial relations with Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Although Ereli did not mention the name of the honorary AIT
chairman, a State Department official said later that William Brown,
who had served as the acting chairman of the institute after former
AIT head Therese Shaheen left the post last year, will greet the
president in his capacity as incumbent honorary AIT chairman.
</P>
<P>
In response to questions regarding the U.S. State Department's
current estimation on Taiwan's human rights since it expressed
concern about the island's media censorship in its 2004 Human Rights
Report, the deputy spokesman said: "I think our views on that issue
are a matter of public record and I'd refer you to the Human Rights
Report."
</P>
<P>
The president is expected to receive a human rights award from
the U.S. Congressional Human Rights Caucus during his stay in Miami.
</P>
<P>
The main purposes of the president's trip to Central America are
to attend the fifth Taiwan-Central America Summit slated to be held
in Nicaragua Sept. 25 and to sign a free trade agreement with his
Guatemalan counterpart Sept. 22.

NO PLAN TO ASK CHUNGHWA TELECOM TO INVEST IN HIGH SPEED RAIL: PREMIER
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Sept.  20 (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The government is not asking Chunghwa
Telecom to invest in Taiwan High Speed Rail for the time being, and
what the telecom company does in the future, as it has been
privatized, will be decided by its own board, Premier Frank Hsieh
said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Hsieh made the remarks in reply to a question posed by People
First Party (PFP) Legislators Wu Ching-chih and Chen Chao-jung during
an interpellation session at the Legislative Yuan.
</P>
<P>
The premier said the government supports the construction of the
Taiwan high speed railway but does not have a policy of asking
Chunghwa Telecom to invest in the project. Inauguration of high speed
railway service was recently postponed by a year until next October.
</P>
<P>
As Chunghwa is now a private company in which the government is
but a shareholder, the question of whether it will invest in the high
speed rail will have to decided by its board of directors and
supervisors, Hsieh noted.
</P>
<P>
The premier was finally able to deliver his administrative report
Tuesday morning after days of filibustering by opposition lawmakers
of the "pan-blue alliance" of the Kuomintang and PFP. The
interpellation session followed the report.

KMT TO FIGHT 'BATTLE OF GLORY' IN YEAR-END ELECTIONS
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Sept.  20 (CNA)
(By P.C. Tang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Kuomintang is set to use "battle of
glory" as its rallying cry for the campaign for the year-end
magistrate and mayoral elections, and the goal of the battle is "to
win Taiwan's glory back," KMT spokeswoman Cheng Li-wen said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The spokeswoman said that the KMT Cultural and Communications
Committee has decided the party's campaign theme for the year-end
elections and submitted it to the Central Standing Committee for
endorsement.
</P>
<P>
Claiming that currently everything in Taiwan is going bad, from
poor economic performance and a chaotic political situation to loss
of social order and uncertainty about the future, Cheng said that
losing confidence in Taiwan is the "saddest feeling at the bottom of
the people's hearts."
</P>
<P>
Under the Kuomintang's rule, the people felt that their future
could be filled with glory, she noted, adding that the Democratic
Progressive Party "only emphasizes dignity, " which she said is
widely seen as a kind of "sadness."
</P>
<P>
The spokeswoman also said the performance of the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party has been rather disappointing and well
below the expectations of the people since it became the ruling party
in 2000, adding that "these expectations have become illusions."
</P>
<P>
Fighting a "battle of glory" is for the purpose of winning back
"the glory of Taiwan" as "this is a concrete and practical way of
doing things, " she continued, adding that the KMT's goal is not to
just gain more political power or to win posts for its candidates,
but instead to ensure the future prosperity and confidence of the
Taiwan people.
</P>
<P>
She also said that the KMT has promised to push for a clean and
high-quality campaign in the year-end elections.

GOV'T TO OBSERVE OIL PRICES FOR 3 MONTHS BEFORE DECIDING ON HIKE
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Sept. 20 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Premier Frank Hsieh said Tuesday that the
government has set a three-month period to observe crude oil prices
and that it will only consider adjusting the price upward if the
price remains high after that period.
</P>
<P>
The premier made the remarks while giving an administrative
report at the Legislative Yuan. He was obstructed from giving the
report twice last week but was able to take the podium after
agreement was reached with opposition Kuomintang and People First
Party legislators.
</P>
<P>
The premier noted that with the surging oil price, the privately
run Formosa Petroleum Corp. announced a gas price hike of NT$2.4, or
almost 10 percent, on Aug. 31. Normally, the state-run Chinese
Petroleum Corp. (CPC) would follow suit, but it didn't this time,
mainly because of concerns about placing a heavier burden on the
people.
</P>
<P>
He said that although the price of oil has now dropped to around
US$65 per barrel, analysts have divergent views on the oil price
trend, and this is why the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of
Economic Affairs and the Council for Economic Planning and
Development have decided to observe the situation for three months
before determining how to act.
</P>
<P>
The premier said that during the three-month period, the
government is considering adjusting downward the commodity tax for
some petroleum products so as to reduce the pressure on the CPC.
</P>
<P>
He reaffirmed that not hiking gasoline prices and electricity
fees will be given priority consideration and that there will be
other complementary measures.
</P>
<P>
He also said that the consumer price index last month was higher
largely because of the effect of rising agricultural produce prices.

MOST GAS STATIONS NOT ADEQUATELY INFORMING CUSTOMERS OF PRICE HIKES
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Sept.  20 (CNA)
(By Elizabeth Hsu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Most drivers don't hear about gas price
hikes until they arrive at gas stations to refuel, and a majority of
them aren't clearly informed of the hikes when they arrive there,
Consumers Foundation Chairman Lee Feng-hsiang said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The foundation held a news conference in Taipei to publicize the
results of its survey of 98 gas stations in Taipei City, Taipei
County, Taichung City, Taichung County, Kaohsiung City and Kaohsiung
County Sept. 15-19.
</P>
<P>
The survey found that 54 percent of the gas stations did not
erect public notices of fuel price increases. Of the 46 percent that
did, 80 percent displayed the notices in difficult to see spots, Lee
said, noting that a similar survey in the United States found that
almost all gas stations there have huge signs informing customers of
price hikes.
</P>
<P>
"It's all about the right of consumers to know," Lee said, adding
that "in Taiwan, the consumers always seem to be the last ones to
know."

LAWMAKERS URGE GOVERNMENT TO EASE QUAKE VICTIMS' LOAN INTEREST BURDEN
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Kuomintang (KMT) Legislator Lin Min-tsang
and several of his colleagues urged the government Tuesday to help
ease the loan interest burden of victims of the massive earthquake
that struck central Taiwan Sept. 21, 1999.
</P>
<P>
Lin was joined by KMT Legislators Yang Chiung-ying and Lai
Shyh-bao as well as several of the earthquake victims from a Taichung
community in a press conference at the Legislative Yuan.
</P>
<P>
According to Yeh Hsiu-chi, one of the victims in the 800-family
community, more than 500 families in the community whose houses were
damaged in the earthquake have been carrying interest burdens ranging
from NT$300,000 to NT$1 million over the past six years, burdens that
have caused depression for many of them.
</P>
<P>
"Is it because no one in our community died (in the quake) that
we have not been able to see the 'eyes of care' from the government?"
Yeh asked.
</P>
<P>
Lin pointed out that NT$180 billion of the government's NT$210
billion "921 Earthquake Relief Fund" was donated by the public.
</P>
<P>
Lai said the KMT caucus in the legislature will ask the ad hoc
commission for rebuilding quake-hit areas to make a report to the
legislature.
</P>
<P>
The KMT lawmakers called on the government not to raise interest
rates for loans used specifically for rebuilding houses damaged in
the quake, and to put off the deadline for paying back the loans when
need be.

POPULAR KUNG FU NOVELIST JIN YONG IN TAIPEI FOR SHORT VISIT
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Sept. 20 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Popular kung fu novelist Jin Yong, whose
knight-errant novels have been devoured by Chinese people across the
world, is in Taipei to attend a party marking the 30th anniversary of
the Yuan-Liou Publishing Co., which publishes most of the Hong
Kong-based novelist's works in Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
The Shanghai-born Jin Yong -- Hong Kong's most eminent man of
letters whose real name is Dr. Louis Cha -- is visiting Taipei at the
invitation of Yuan-Liou's founder, Wang Jung-wen, for a series of
celebratory activities, including the establishment of a Yuan-Liou
Reading Studio in Taipei and the launch of "Jin Yong credit cards."
</P>
<P>
Jin, who has written 15 best-selling martial arts novels, met
with a group of writers from Shanghai, including renowned novelist
Wang Anyi, Tuesday morning.
</P>
<P>
He is scheduled to meet with his Taiwan readers over a dinner
party Tuesday evening.
</P>
<P>
Most of Jin's martial arts novels have been adapted for films and
televised drama series in the Chinese-speaking world. He is scheduled
to preside over a ceremony Wednesday marking the launch of the
"Yuan-Liou Jin Yong credit cards" designed to promote reading in
Taiwan. The credit cards will be issued jointly by Yuan-Liou and the
Taipei-based International Commercial Bank of China.
</P>
<P>
Jin arrived in Taipei Monday for a whirlwind visit. He met with
Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou and Academia Sinica Vice President Ovid
Tzeng the first day of his arrival.
</P>
<P>
The soft-spoken, quintessentially Chinese man, now nearly 80
years old, is renowned not only as the author of the 15 kung fu
novels but as a veteran reporter, publisher and political
commentator. He was the founder of the Ming Pao newspaper and its
sister publications.
</P>
<P>
Jin is considered one of the best and most prolific Chinese
novelists of the modern era. But his 15 novels, written between 1955
and 1972, are more than just kung fu stories. Their pages burst with
fantastic knight-errant tales of heroic swordsmen and beautiful
heroines, intermingling romance, tragedy and comedy with Chinese and 
religious values.
</P>
<P>
Universities around the Chinese-speaking world have formed Jin
Yong fan clubs, sponsored seminars or opened classes on Jin's classic
novels, in which, Chinese readers can immerse themselves in their
cultural heritage from the language, calligraphy, art, music,
traditional costumes, cuisine and martial arts that they find in the
novels. Traditional Chinese culture, fantasy and history form the
colorful backdrops for his works.

NO EVIDENCE OF GOVERNMENT-BUSINESS COLLUSION IN MRT PROJECT: PREMIER
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei, Sept. 20 (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Premier Frank Hsieh apologized Tuesday for
government negligence in supervising the construction of Kaohisung's
mass rapid transit system but he claimed that no evidence shows there
has been any suspicion of collusion between the government and the
private contractors in the MRT project.
</P>
<P>
Hsieh made the remarks at the Legislative Yuan in reply to
opposition lawmakers' questions concerning the Kaohsiung MRT scandal
which has led to Council for Labor Affairs (CLA) Chairwoman Chen Chu
and acting Kaohsiung mayor Chen Chi-mai stepping down. An
investigation by judicial authorities is underway of Kaohisung Rapid
Transit Corp. (KRTC) Vice Chairman Chen Min-hsien.
</P>
<P>
The scandal erupted Aug. 21 when Thai workers brought in the
country to build the MRT system rioted in protest of poor living
conditions and maltreatment by Huapan Administration Consultant Co.
Ltd. that had been charged with managing them.
</P>
<P>
Hsieh said the riot was caused by "the businesses infringing on
the rights of workers, " not by "the state infringing on foreign
workers or the government authority infringing on the human rights
[of foreign workers]."
</P>
<P>
Therefore, he added, the government has been investigating the
incident and demanding responsibility according to law, but there has
not been any evidence of the government trying to cover things up or
colluding with the private sector.
</P>
<P>
He said Huapan's management problem is an isolated case, but he
was Kaohsiung's mayor, and is now the premier, and so he cannot dodge
his responsibility for failing to supervise Kaohsiung's labor and
mass transit bureaus as well as the Cabinet's CLA, and "for that, I
would like to apologize."
</P>
<P>
As to whether there has been any involvement by "the powers that
be" or any breach of trust on the part of the government, he claimed
that these questions are being investigated by responsible government
authorities.
</P>
<P>
On the appropriateness of building the MRT system under the
"build, operate and transfer" (BOT) model, Hsieh said adopting the
BOT model has long been a government policy because the government
budget is restrained as the economy is not doing well, and the
government tries to give the private sector major projects to boost
the economy.
</P>
<P>
Over the past 60 years, ever since the Kuomintang moved to Taiwan
to become its ruling party until 2000, there have been many, many
corruption cases, none of which involved a BOT project, Hsieh said,
urging the people not to besmirch Kaohsiung MRT's BOT project simply
because of the riot by Thai workers.
</P>
<P>
In fact, he boasted that by adopting the BOT model for
Kaohsiung's MRT system, the government has saved more than NT$40
billion. And since the BOT project has been carried out,
responsibilities would be confused if the government had to award
building contracts and assign a vice chairman to the KRTC board.
</P>
<P>
In reply to KMT lawmaker Wu Ching-chih's demand to know whether
KRTC has been "in collusion with" Hwang Chang General Contractor Co.
Ltd., that won numerous government projects all around Taiwan, Hsieh
said this is a typical example of "Tseng Sen kills a man," an ancient
Chinese story of "many rumors make a truth."
</P>
<P>
Wu said KRTC Vice Chairman Chen Min-hsien, now under judicial
probe, flew to Japan soon after the Thai workers protested -- "Was he
trying to shirk responsibility by going overseas to make arrangements
for future testimony?"
</P>
<P>
Hsieh said he does not know the details of Wu's story, and if
Chen was ganging up with somebody to make a false confession at home,
it would not be difficult to find out.
</P>
<P>
Wu claimed that no one would believe there has not been any
government cover-up or government-business collusion in the scandal.
</P>
<P>
To this accusation, Hsieh said, "This is what is terrible about
our society: We're saying Tseng Sen has killed a man, and then say it
again and again. Even Mao Zedong boasted that telling a lie a hundred
times will make it a fact."
</P>
<P>
"I cannot go against my conscience and say that something wrong
is right and that something right is wrong," he asserted.
</P>
<P>
He emphasized that the decision to adopt the BOT model for
Kaohsiung's MRT had been made before he took over the job from his
predecessor, Wu Den-yih, and he was responsible for executing the BOT
project and awarding the contracts, a process participated in by
China Steel Corp. (CSC).
</P>
<P>
"Was CSC profiting [from the contract awarding process]? Was
there any problem with CSC?" Hsieh asked.
</P>
<P>
Justice Minister Shih Mao-lin said he will ask "integrity"
officials to gain an understanding of the contract-awarding process
but will not go into any individual case with regard to the KRTC
controversy.

TAIWAN SOLICITS JAPANESE HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS FOR EDUCATION TOURS
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei, Sept. 20 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taiwan is encouraging high school students
to visit Japan for education tours, and is promoting reciprocal trips
to Taiwan by Japanese high school students, Vice Minister of
Education Fan Sun-lu said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
A group of Japanese high school principals are scheduled to visit
Taiwan before the end of this year to sample the courses that may be
open to Japanese high school students when they visit Taiwan for
education tours in the future, Fan said.
</P>
<P>
According to Fan, the Ministry of Education began to promote
international education tours in 2000 after it founded the Taiwan
International Association for Education Tours, targeting students of
high schools and high-school-level vocational schools for exchanges.
</P>
<P>
The program was suspended in 2003 after an outbreak of severe
acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in Taiwan, Fan said, adding that
high school students from Taiwan and Japan have traveled to each
other's country back and forth since the program was resumed last
year.
</P>
<P>
Fan said that in addition to Japanese students, high school
students from Germany, Saudi Arabia and other European and Western
Asian countries have also made education tours of Taiwan over the
past several years. A Russian group from a high school in Moscow is
expected to arrive in Taiwan in November this year, she added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, according to Kuo Chiu-yi, 2,657 students from 113 high
schools from around the world made education tours to Taiwan last
year. Of the total, 1,609 students were from 49 high schools in
Japan.
</P>
<P>
A total of 1,300 Taiwan high school students visited Japan on
education tour programs last year, Kuo said, adding that this figure
is expected to be increased three fold this year.
</P>
<P>
The most prevalent motto in Japanese schools -- Greeting people
by saying hello, valuing and respecting people-to-people relations
and observing the law -- is perhaps the most valuable lesson that
Taiwan students learned during their education tours in Japan, Kuo
noted.

NO MORE IMPORTS OF THAI WORKERS FOR KAOHSIUNG MRT PROJECTS: OFFICIALS
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Kaohsiung, Taiwan, Sept. 20 (CNA)
(By Elizabeth Hsu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The heads of the Kaohsiung City
department of Rapid Transit System (DRTS) and the city's Bureau of
Labor Affairs (BLA) agreed Tuesday that no more Thai laborers will be
imported for construction projects of the city's mass rapid transit
(MRT) system after their employment contracts expire.
</P>
<P>
DRTS Director Lee Cheng-pin and BLA Director Fang made the
promise in an interpellation session of the City Council after six
councilors out of the 44-seat body asked that overseas workers on the
Kaohsiung MRT system be replaced by local laborers.
</P>
<P>
The six councilors from the ruling Democratic Progressive Party
made the appeal after the outbreak of a riot by Thai workers Aug. 21
on the MRT projects to protest against maltreatment by their
managers. Subsequent allegations have been made of corruption by
local officials.
</P>
<P>
Councilor Huang Shu-mai indicated that since the beginning of the
rapid transit line construction in 2001, the unemployment rate in
Kaohsiung has never shown a noticeable drop. She claimed this is
because native workers are not hired in significant numbers on
construction projects.
</P>
<P>
Her colleague, Eteng Yinai, an aboriginal Taiwanese, said that he
knows many aboriginal people who are willing to work for similar
wages paid overseas workers.
</P>
<P>
Hiring aboriginal people around the island to help build public
transportation systems would also help the nations unemployment,
Yinai suggested.

An official with the EPA's Recycling Fund Management Board said
Tuesday that the EPA is prepared to spend NT$11 million to renovate
1,600 unwanted computers that have 586mhz chips or better and will
install new software in the old units, and then give them to
low-income people living in remote areas, including aborigines and
schoolchildren.
</P>
<P>
He said that an unwanted old computer may be seen by some people
as a piece of junk that just takes up space, but to a schoolchild of
a poor family, it may mean a dream fulfilled.
</P>
<P>
The official said the EPA is still about 5,000 computers short of
its target after its current campaign began early this year.
</P>
<P>
The campaign will end Oct. 31, and those who want to support the
plan may find a collection point nearest them by checking the online
information at: http: //www.istec.iii.org.tw/. They may also call
toll-free at 0800-000-156.
</P>
<P>
Figures released by the EPA show that since 2000, the EPA has
given away 2,700 computers to low-income people in 170 remote areas
through its PC rebirth program.

TAIWAN POPULATION AGING FAST: CEPD
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Sept.  20 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taiwan is estimated to become an "aged
society" by 2018, as its population is aging at a rate more than
double the pace in developed countries, a government official said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Kao Hsien-kuei, vice director of the Performance Evaluation and
Overall Planning Department under the Cabinet-level Council for
Economic Planning and Development (CEPD) , said that Taiwan will
develop from an "aging society" to an "aged society" by that time
when the ratio of its people aged 65 years or above surpasses 14
percent.
</P>
<P>
It will take another 13 years for Taiwan to become an "aged
society, " double the pace of aging in Western and industrialized
countries, Kao said, noting that Taiwan became an "aging society" in
1993, when the portion of its population aged over 65 years reached 7
percent.
</P>
<P>
It took France 115 years to go through the transition, while the
United States took 72 year and Britain 47 years in the transitional
period, Kao reported.
</P>
<P>
Citing CEPD estimates, Kao said that Taiwan will be an "elderly
society" in 2026, when its elderly will make up 20 percent of its
total population, according to the definition set by the United
Nations.
</P>
<P>
Although an aging population will unavoidably deal a blow to a
country's economy, Kao said that it also provides orientation for
businesses to focus on insurance and financial services and health
care products for elderly people.
</P>
<P>
An upcoming vice ministerial meeting of the Asia-Pacific Economic
Cooperation forum slated for September will also discuss challenges
facing an aging society for the first time, she said.

NEW TAIWAN DOLLAR UNDER STRONG DEPRECIATION PRESSURE
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Sept.  20 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The new Taiwan dollar has come under
strong depreciation pressure due to Taiwan's weak economic
performance and anticipated U.S. interest rate hikes, banking sources
said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Judging from Taiwan's economic fundamentals, there is no room for
the local currency to pick up in value, in particular at a time when
the U.S. Federal Reserve is preparing to hike interest rates in the
days ahead, sources said, pointing out that the new Taiwan dollar is
more likely to depreciate gradually.
</P>
<P>
Although the new Taiwan dollar has depreciated less compared to
other currencies, such as the South Korean won, it has widely been
speculated in the domestic foreign currency exchanges that the local
unit will further dip to 33.2 against the U.S. dollar in the near
term following continued falls in recent days.
</P>
<P>
The new Taiwan dollar ended at a nearly 10-month low of 33.096
Monday in the Taipei Foreign Exchange against the greenback, losing
ground by NT$0.165 from last Friday's finish.
</P>
<P>
Thomas M. F. Yeh, vice chairman of the Cabinet-level Council for
Economic Planning and Development (CEPD), said that the depreciation
of the local currency should help boost Taiwan's exports in the
fourth quarter -- traditionally a peak season for export businesses.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan registered a combined trade surplus of US$1.17 billion for
the first eight months of this year, an astounding plunge of 79.1
percent from the year-earlier level -- another major driving force
that Yeh said has sent the new Taiwan dollar plummeting. In
comparison, South Korea posted a trade deficit of US$15.98 billion
for the same eight-month period.
</P>
<P>
It was reported in a CEPD meeting Monday that the South Korean
government has set a goal of achieving an average per-capita income
of US$20,000 for its nationals in 2008, causing widespread concern
that Taiwan has been outpaced by South Korea.
</P>
<P>
Hung Jue-pin, head of the CEPD's Economic Research Department,
said that in the meeting that in contrast to the general assumption,
Taiwan actually performs better than South Korea.
</P>
<P>
Citing data provided by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and the
economic forecasting agency Global Insight, Hung said that Taiwan
posted smaller reductions in export growth than South Korea in the
first and second quarters amid a dwindling global economy since the
beginning of this year.
</P>
<P>
The ADB also forecast that Taiwan's economy will expand by 3.7
percent for 2005, ahead of South Korea's 3.6 percent.

TWO FORMER KAOHSIUNG MAYORS TRADE BARBS OVER CITY'S MRT PROJECT
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Sept.  20 (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two former mayors of Kaohsiung traded
barbs at the Legislative Yuan Tuesday over their roles in deciding to
adopt the "build, operate and transfer" (BOT) model for the city's
mass rapid transit system.
</P>
<P>
Both Wu Den-yih, now a Kuomintang legislator, and Premier Frank
Hsieh showed official documents to support their arguments, with Wu
accusing Hsieh of lying and Hsieh firing back by claiming Wu does not
know how to read documents.
</P>
<P>
Wu, holding an official letter dated March 12, 1999, pointed out
that in the letter to the Ministry of Transportation and
Communications, Hsieh said that after careful evaluations, the city
government would suggest that the BOT model be adopted to build
Kaohsiung's MRT system.
</P>
<P>
According to Wu, the document clearly shows that it was Hsieh who
decided to build the MRT under the BOT model, and yet Hsieh told the
media that he -- Wu -- made that decision, which was a lie.
</P>
<P>
Wu demanded that Hsieh step down as premier for "ill-intended
shifting of responsibility and besmirching" his name. Wu added that
if it were him that had lied, he would quit politics immediately.
</P>
<P>
For his part, Hsieh displayed an official document, dated Nov.
11, 1998, when Wu was mayor, sent by the Kaohsiung City Government to
the Executive Yuan in which the city government proposed that the red
line be built by the city government and the orange line be built by
the private sector.
</P>
<P>
But on the eve of the election for mayor, on Dec. 4, 1998, the
city government reversed the proposal by suggesting that both the red
and orange lines be built by private contractors, Hsieh said.
</P>
<P>
So it is clear that the decision to adopt he BOT model for
building the system was made during Wu's term of office, while he
himself was merely "executing" the BOT project, said Hsieh.
</P>
<P>
In reply to Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) Legislator William
C.T. Lai's question, Hsieh said in addition to the Dec. 4, 1998
letter from the Kaohsiung City Government to the Executive Yuan which
suggested private-sector participation in building the MRT, Wu has
said that decision was made on Nov. 11, 1998. "This further confirms
that the decision was made while Wu was mayor," Hsieh said.
</P>
<P>
Hsieh suspected that Wu "did not understand many things" or, if
he did, he was just trying to humiliate him by asking him tough
questions at the legislature, rather than to explore the facts.
</P>
<P>
Hsieh said that the issue here was about "truth, " and about
"right and wrong, " and the truth here was that he had saved
taxpayers a huge sum of money and yet has been smeared and falsely
accused. Regarding this controversy, he said he feels comfortable
with his conscience and he has no problem facing the public.

'PAN GREEN CAMP" TO RALLY FOR MILITARY PROCUREMENT
</HEADLINE>

(By Flor Wang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The "pan green camp" of the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) and its ally, the Taiwan
Solidarity Union, is slated to hold a large parade Sunday in Taipei
to solicit public support for the government's military procurement
plan.
</P>
<P>
Yu Shyi-kun, secretary-general of the Presidential Office and
acting chairman of the DPP's Central Standing Committee, said that
several heavyweight committee members will take part in the march,
which is being organized by the Hand-in-Hand Taiwan Alliance.
</P>
<P>
Yu, however, said that he has no idea of whether government
officials such as Premier Frank Hsieh will attend.
</P>
<P>
According to DPP officials, the party is planning to mobilize
more than 10,000 supporters from across Taiwan for the parade,
designed to invite greater public backing for a major military
procurement bill that failed again to clear the legislative floor
earlier the same day.
</P>
<P>
The major military purchase bill, now valued at NT$340 billion
after the Ministry of National Defense slashed its original spending
by half, will allow the government to buy diesel-electric submarines,
anti-submarine planes and anti-missile equipment from the United
States in the face of the increasing military threat from China.

U.S.-TAIWAN NATIONAL DEFENSE INDUSTRY CONFERENCE OPENS
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Los  Angeles,  Sept.  19 (CNA)
(By L.S. Chu and Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The fourth U.S.-Taiwan national
defense industry conference opened in San Diego Monday, with more
than 100 representatives from the United States and Taiwan attending.
</P>
<P>
Rupert Hammond-Chambers, president of the U.S.-Taiwan Business
Council, which sponsored the meeting, said that the two-day meeting
is not directly related to Taiwan's arms procurement package from the
United States.
</P>
<P>
He was referring to the long-stalled package comprising three
big-ticket weaponry items -- eight diesel-electric submarines, a
squadron of 12 P-3C anti-submarine aircraft and six Patriot PAC III
anti-missile batteries.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan's opposition-controlled Legislative Yuan has blocked the
passage of the package for over a year because opposition lawmakers
say the price is too high and that it should be listed under the
regular budget rather than a special one.
</P>
<P>
Hammond-Chambers said the annual meeting gathers think tank
scholars, weapons researchers and specialists in military cooperation
from the U.S. and Taiwan, as well as manufacturers from the U.S.
defense industry, to allow them to understand each other's supply and
demand.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the U.S.-Taiwan Business Council is a
non-government economic organization that will only play a
liaison role based on the needs of the two countries, without
interfering.
</P>
<P>
Hammond-Chambers and Vans D. Coffman, vice president of the
council, called on Huo Shou-yeh, Republic of China vice minister of
national defense and head of the Taiwan delegation, right after the
opening of the meeting to exchange views on issues involving defense
procurement.
</P>
<P>
Hammond-Chambers said that his duty was to convey to Huo the
intentions of the U.S. defense industry soliciting business
opportunities in the hope that the U.S. and Taiwan can maintain good
supply and demand relations.
</P>
<P>
Coffman said that although he concurrently serves as chairman of
Lockheed Martin Co., he conveyed the hope of the U.S.
defense industry for increased business opportunities to Huo in his
capacity as vice president of the council.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Edward Ross, principal director of the Security
Cooperation Operations under the Defense Security Cooperation Agency,
criticised the progress of Taiwan's national defense budget.
</P>
<P>
Ross took part in the meeting on behalf of Richard Lawless, U.S.
Deputy Undersecretary of Defense, who was unable to attend the
conference because he was preoccupied with the six-party talks on
North Korea.
</P>
<P>
Ross lauded Minister of National Defense Lee Jye and his staff
for meeting with legislators and communicating with them more than
170 times to attempt to facilitate the passage of a special budget to
buy the arms.
</P>
<P>
He claimed that since U.S. President George W. Bush approved the
sale of the arms to Taiwan in April 2001, "nothing" has happened in
nearly five years.
</P>
<P>
The wrangling between the ruling and opposition parties has put
the issue out of focus, he said, adding that it seems that political
figures in Taiwan are enjoying the inter-party bickering and ignoring
the real needs of Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the Taiwan government's investment in national
defense is not as much as in other items, pointing out that
expenditure in economic and social welfare items are in double-digit
growth while the increase for national defense is limited.
</P>
<P>
He said that if possible, he will appeal to the Taiwan people
directly, because the matter involves the future wealth and security
of the people. He added that he wants them to know that national
security should involve political responsibility and that the Taiwan
people should demand that the officials they elect take
responsibility.
</P>
<P>
He said that over the past year or two, he and Lawless have been
confronted by U.S. congressmen, officials and entrepreneurs with the
same question of why the U.S. should supply Taiwan with its defense
needs if Taiwan has no intention of investing in its national
defense.
</P>
<P>
He said the gross domestic product (GDP) of Singapore is US$120
billion, and its national defense budget accounts for 5 percent of
its GDP. In contrast, Taiwan's GDP is US$578 billion, but its defense
budget only accounts for 2.4 percent of its GDP.
</P>
<P>
He lauded President Chen Shui-bian's recent request that the
defense ratio be raised to 3 percent of the GDP, although he
predicted that this will not be accomplished by Chen alone.
</P>
<P>
Ross said he is not advocating a cross-strait arms race, but
reminded Taiwan that it should increase investment in its national
defense so that it will be able to avoid the cross-strait status quo
being changed.

BENQ HEAD: KEEP GROUP GROWING BY TAKING OVER OTHER FIRMS
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei, Sept. 20 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In order to keep growing, the Taiwan-based
BenQ Corporation will not rule out the possibility of taking over
other well-known brands in the world, the chairman of the computer
giant said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
With 10 days to go before his group will formally take over the
mobile phone division of the Munich-based Siemens, K.Y. Lee said the
deal, concluded in June, will inflate BenQ's cell phone business
three-fold and will make it the world's forth-largest handset maker.
</P>
<P>
Lee said the Siemens mobile phone division has more than 100
outlets around the world and thousands of skilled technicians,
quality controllers, and well-developed partnerships with component
suppliers, providing BenQ with a valuable chance to move onto the
world stage and cooperate with well-known companies around the world.
</P>
<P>
The takeover of Siemens' handset division will beef up BenQ's
ability to come up with new products and will provide it with an
efficient economic scale, Lee said.
</P>
<P>
Encouraged by the success in acquiring the Siemens' cell phone
division, Lee said his group will keep looking for chances to acquire
other brand-name products to enlarge the group's presence around the
world.
</P>
<P>
He also predicted that the peak season for thin film transistor
liquid cristal display panels (TFT-LCD) will arrive in the fourth
quarter for the Christmas rush, despite rising oil prices.
</P>
<P>
Lee said the impact of surging international oil price on
industries varies with different lines. For example, the world's auto
manufacturers might feel the pinch sharply, but the electronic
industry is not expected to be affected seriously, particularly not
the manufacturers of computers and cellphones, which are the main
products of BenQ.
</P>
<P>
However, Lee said, profits from these product are marginal
because of a fierce price war prompted by a global glut of computers
and mobile phones.
</P>
<P>
He said AU Optronics, a BenQ subsidiary that manufactures large
TFT-LCDs began earning profits in the second quarter of this year and
that the upward trend continues in the 3rd quarter.

PREMIER: OPPOSITION STAGING 'CULTURAL REVOLUTION-STYLE TRIAL'
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,   Sept.  20  (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Premier Frank Hsieh denounced the
opposition Kuomintang (KMT) caucus in the legislature Tuesday for
putting a motion of condemning him on the legislative agenda,
claiming that the KMT caucus is staging a "Taiwan version of the
Chinese Cultural Revolution."
</P>
<P>
The KMT and its pan-blue ally, the People First Party (PFP) ,
demanded that he apologize for allegedly lying about the Kaohsiung
mass rapid transit (MRT) project scandal and stopped him twice from
delivering an administrative report at the legislature on Sept. 13
and on Sept. 16.
</P>
<P>
As Hsieh walked onto the legislative floor Tuesday, he was asked
to comment on the KMT caucus proposal to pass a legislative
resolution condemning him for not apologizing for his role in the MRT
saga.
</P>
<P>
He said he would admit to any mistake he might have made but that
he could not apologize under pressure from a pan-blue majority vote.
</P>
<P>
He claimed that the pan-blue alliance was promoting "the culture
of forcing people to write repentant letters" -- a tactic used by the
Red Guard during the Chinese Cultural Revolution of 1966-76.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan should not learn this from China, as the Cultural
Revolution caused a 30-year social and economic retrogression, he
added.
</P>
<P>
He claimed that the MRT controversy is a matter of "truth" and a
matter of "right and wrong" that cannot be voted on but rather should
be made clear with solid evidence.
</P>
<P>
When he finally made his administrative report and took questions
from opposition legislators concerning the Kaohsiung MRT project, he
did apologize for government negligence in supervising the
construction of the project.

KMT DISPUTES HUMAN RIGHTS AWARD FOR PRESIDENT FROM U.S. CONGRESS
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Sept. 20 (CNA)

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The legislative caucus of the opposition
Kuomintang (KMT) will send an open letter to the U.S. Congress to
protest the presentation of a human rights award to President Chen
Shui-bian by the congressional human rights caucus during his transit
in the United States on his way to Central America for a state visit.
</P>
<P>
Former Mainland Affairs Council Chairman Su Chi, who initiated
the letter, told the media Tuesday that some 30 KMT legislators have
signed it.
</P>
<P>
He said the president does not deserve to receive the human
rights award on behalf of the Taiwan people because the government
under his leadership has been involved in a series of scandals and
disputes, including the Aug. 21 riot by Thai laborers working on the
Kaohsiung mass rapid transit railway project to protest their
inhumane treatment.
</P>
<P>
The riot has dented Taiwan's image as a democracy that respects
human rights and resulted in the resignations of Council of Labor
Affairs Chairman Chen Chu and acting Kaohsiung Mayor Chen Chi-mai.
</P>
<P>
Pan Wei-gang, a whip of the KMT legislative caucus, said the
caucus will send another open letter to the U.S. government,
accompanied with a record of what it described as "Chen's human
rights violations."
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the KMT move, Chao Yung-ching, convener of the
legislative caucus of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) ,
said that an award for the president from the U.S. congressional
human rights caucus should be an honor shared by all the people of
Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
He said it is "very strange" that the KMT's legislative caucus
wants to send a letter of protest to the U.S. Congress.
</P>
<P>
Chen, accompanied by an entourage, is in transit in the United
States on a 12-day state visit to attend a summit in Nicaragua. He is
expected to receive the human rights award from the U.S.
congressional human rights caucus in Miami Wednesday.

announced Tuesday that fares on domestic flight routes will be hiked
by an average of 3.2 percent from Oct. 19.
</P>
<P>
Prices on western Taiwan flight routes will be raised by 3.3
percent, while those for the eastern and outlying island routes will
be increased by an average 2.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
In terms of individual flight routes, the Taipei-Taitung route
price will be increased by 5.3 percent, or a rise of NT$104, while
the Taipei-Kinmen price increase will be between NT$72 and NT$94, and
the Taipei-Kaohsiung route will be upped between NT$74 and NT$90.

TAIWAN MEDICAL TEAM IN MALAWI GETS FINANCIAL SHOT IN ARM
</HEADLINE>

Pingtung  County,  southern  Taiwan,  Sept.  20 (CNA)

<P>
A Taiwanese
medical assistance team working in Malawi received a financial shot
in the arm Tuesday when two non-government organizations donated
funds to support two of its projects -- treating AIDS patients and
training midwives.
</P>
<P>
The Rotary Club of Pingtung donated NT$400,000 (US$12,000) ,
designated for the training of midwives, while the Taiwan Urbani
Foundation bought a batch of AIDs test kits at a cost of US$13,755 --
enough for HIV tests for 1,920 people.
</P>
<P>
The medical team, managed by the Pingtung Christian Hospital, has
been in Malawi for three years training midwives for Malawi, as the
African nation has only two obstetricians. The shortage of midwives
has resulted in a mortality rate of 113 deaths per 1,000 infants,
ranking 17th-highest in the world.
</P>
<P>
The team is also running a "rainbow clinic" specifically to treat
AIDS patients. Malawi is one the nations hardest-hit by AIDS.
</P>
<P>
Other assistance programs being carried out by the team include
building a blood bank, providing mobile medical services and training
health workers.

ENVIRONMENTAL CHIEF SLAMMED BY PREDECESSOR FOR 'NOT DOING HIS DUTY'
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Sept. 20 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The chief of the Environmental Protection
Administration (EPA) , Chang Kuo-lung, was slammed by one of his
predecessors Tuesday for giving a greenlight to the opening of an
interchange linking the village of Pinglin in Taipei County with the
Peiyi Freeway.
</P>
<P>
Hau Lung-bin, who served as EPA chief between 2001 and 2004, said
Chang had failed to do his duty by not stopping the Ministry of
Transportation and Communications (MOTC) from opening the interchange,
which is set to bring more tourists to Pinglin, a quiet village at
the center of the catchment area of the Feitsui reservoir. Tourists
will promote the commercial development of Pinglin, leading to the
pollution of the reservoir, which provides water to metropolitan
Taipei, Hau claimed.
</P>
<P>
As a result, Hau warned, the reservoir will be silted up by
persistent mudslides in a few years and its water will be polluted
and no longer suitable for drinking.
</P>
<P>
Noting that at least seven EPA chiefs before Chang had resisted
politicians' pressure to open the Pinglin interchange, Hau said their
efforts were undone by Chang when he opened the interchange to the
public.
</P>
<P>
The Peiyi Freeway has not yet been completed, but a section
linking Taipei and a place near Pinglin has already been finished and
opened.
</P>
<P>
Because of its location in a catchment area, Pinglin's commercial
development is virtually prohibited -- to the great displeasure of
its residents, who hope the interchange linking the village and the
Peiyi Freeway will bring in tourists.
</P>
<P>
Their desire won the sympathy of Chen Din-nan, a former justice
minister who quit his post earlier this year to run in the year-end
election for the magistrateship of Yilan County which is where the
Peiyi Freeway ends.
</P>
<P>
In order to win votes in Yilan County, Chen wrote to Minister of
Transportation and Communications Lin Ling-san and EPA chief Chang
Kuo-lung, asking them to open the interchange to facilitate the
development of Yilan and Pinglin.
</P>
<P>
The MOTC decided Sept. 16 to allow a maximum of 4,000 vehicles to
use the interchange through Pinglin per day, but the move only
prompted traffic jams because too many vehicles wanted to use the
interchange.
</P>
<P>
Hau criticized the decision as a politically motivated move aimed
at helping Chen to win the election regardless of its impact on the
environment.

airport for a transit stopover en route to Central America for an
official tour.
</P>

hours because of the closure of Miami's international airport due to
Hurricane Rita. Chen is scheduled to make a one-day transit stop in
Miami Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Alaska Governor Frank Murkowski, a long-term, staunch supporter
of Taiwan, hosted a luncheon in honor of Chen and his entourage.

CWB ISSUES SEA WARNING FOR TYPHOON DAMREY
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Sept. 21 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Central Weather Bureau (CWB) issued a
sea warning for typhoon Damrey Wednesday, anticipating rough seas in
the Bashih Channel and torrential rain for southern and southeastern
Taiwan for the next several days.
</P>
<P>
The tropical storm, with a radius of 200 kilometers, was centered
410 kilometers south-southeast of Taiwan's southernmost tip of
Oluanpi at 11 a.m. Wednesday, moving in a west-northwest direction
toward Taiwan at a speed of 12 kph, CWB meteorologists reported.
</P>
<P>
Damrey, the 18th typhoon reported in the Pacific this year, is
forecast to continue moving toward the South China Sea over the
following two days and to directly affect the Bashih Channel area,
the meteorologists warned, adding that ships operating in the
channel, the southern part of the Taiwan Strait, and in waters north
of the Philippines should be on guard against rough seas.
</P>
<P>
The eastern part of Taiwan as well as the Hengchun Peninsula at
the southernmost tip of Taiwan are expected to begin experiencing
heavy rain by nightfall Wednesday when these areas come under the
influence of the typhoon, while the northern and northeastern parts
of the island are forecast to see rain starting Thursday.
</P>

Meanwhile, Saola, the 17th typhoon reported in the Pacific,
formed earlier Wednesday near Guam, the weather bureau said, adding

MND: TAIWAN TO SEEK RECIPROCITY IN ARMS DEALS WITH U.S.
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Los Angeles,  Sept.  20 (CNA)
(By Chu Lu-sheng and Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Ministry of National Defense
(MND) has asked the United States to make reciprocal technology
transfers or purchases in its arms dealings with Taiwan, a visiting
Republic of China official said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Vice Minister of National Defense Hou Shou-yeh said he has taken
advantage of the just-concluded Taiwan-U.S. defense industry
conference in San Diego to convey to the U.S. authorities Taiwan's
desire for reciprocity in its arms deals with the United States.
</P>
<P>
Noting that other government departments have consistently asked
foreign suppliers to make reciprocal purchases of Taiwan products or
technology transfers whenever they sign major procurement contracts,
Hou said the MND will follow this practice in its future arms
dealings with the United States to upgrade Taiwan's defense
technology and production capacity.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Hou said he had smooth communications with U.S.
defense officials during the two-day Taiwan-U.S. defense industry
meeting.
</P>
<P>
"I didn't feel any pressure from the U.S. side," Hou said, adding
that in additional to face-to-face talks during the meeting, MND
officials maintained smooth regular contacts with U.S. defense
authorities.
</P>
<P>
Following the defense industry conference, Hou was scheduled to
travel to a U.S. military base Wednesday to get first-hand
information about Taiwan military officers receiving training there.
</P>
<P>
Hou and other MND staff members attending the conference are
scheduled to wrap up their trip Thursday.
</P>
<P>
More than 100 people took part in the conference, including
Taiwan and U.S. think tank scholars and military specialists, as well
as weapons researchers and military officials. The two-day meeting
was sponsored by the U. S.-Taiwan Business Council, a
non-governmental organization that groups U.S. companies with
interests in Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
The two-day meeting focused on the study of the current situation
of U.S.-Taiwan military cooperation and the outlook for Taiwan's
future defense needs.

'TAISHANG' ARCHITECTS OF TAIWAN'S GLOBALIZATION: VP
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Sept. 21 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A new world trade map has been shaped and
Taiwan is not lagging behind in integrating itself into this map,
Vice President Annette Lu said Wednesday, adding that Taiwan
businessmen operating overseas -- known locally as "taishang" -- will
undoubtedly play a role in facilitating Taiwan's globalization.
</P>
<P>
Lu made the remarks while greeting representatives of taishang at
a meeting in Taipei Wednesday. She was speaking on behalf of
President Chen Shui-bian, who left Taiwan a day earlier on a 12-day
official trip to Central America and the Caribbean.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the opening of the 11th annual meeting of the World
Taiwanese Chamber of Commerce, Lu offered thanks and admiration to
those taishang -- who traveled from every corner of the globe to
Taipei for the meeting -- for their hard work overseas.
</P>
<P>
Globalization has increasingly impacted Taiwan and this impact
has in turn become a challenge to the administration, Lu said, adding
that Chen is expected to announce a "prospering allies" project
during his trip overseas, aimed at accelerating Taiwan's
globalization.
</P>
<P>
The "prospering allies" project is aimed at boosting Taiwan's
exchanges and cooperation with diplomatic allies in Central America
and the Caribbean in particular, Lu noted.
</P>
<P>
As the U.S. Congress has passed a Central American Free Trade
Agreement, paving the way for the formation of an immense American
free trade zone, the American continent is expected to become the
largest trade bloc in the world, where business opportunities will be
unlimited, according to Lu.
</P>
<P>
Noting that Central America and the Caribbean -- the most
steadfast area in terms of Taiwan's diplomatic engagement -- with a
population of 890 million -- is poised to become part of the world's
largest free trade bloc, Lu said the Taiwan government has mapped out
plans to offer its development experiences in the agriculture,
fishery and high-technology fields to allies in the region and will
soon put those plans into practice.
</P>
<P>
Lu said that El Salvador will be the first country to see these
plans carried out, followed by Guatemala and Panama.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the vice president said that it has been six years
since Taiwan was struck by the devastating earthquake of Sept. 21,
1999. Despite the devastation, Taiwan, a small island country,
managed to "pull together and stand tall" in a very short period
of time even in the face of China's persistent threats. This
reflects the so-called "Taiwan miracle," she added.

FOREIGN MINISTRY DENIES 'BUYING' HUMAN RIGHTS AWARD FOR PRESIDENT
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Sept.  21 (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs denied
that the government had "bought" a human rights award for President
Chen Shui-bian, who was due to receive it during a transit stop in
Miami Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Ministry spokesman Michel Lu was responding to an allegation by
opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Legislator Su Chi, who claimed that the
government paid U.S. public relations firm BGR (Barbour Griffith &amp;
Rogers) US$1.5 million a year or more in order for Chen to be awarded
by the Congressional human rights caucus.
</P>
<P>
Two other PR companies hired by the government to promote Chen's
image in the U.S., according to Su, are Cassidy &amp; Associates, which
was paid US$540,000 in April, and Laster Wolff, where the son-in-law
of U.S. Congressman Tom Lantos works.
</P>
<P>
Su claimed that the government was "paying handsomely to buy a
foreign citation" for the president.
</P>
<P>
However, Lu said the president was awarded on behalf of Taiwan's
23 million people because the U.S. recognizes their efforts in
improving human rights and entrenching democracy, a move that has
nothing to do with the PR firms who are hired to lobby for Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the PR firms are part of the communications
channels between Taiwan and the U.S. whose major tasks include
smoothing the communications between Taiwan and the U.S. Congress and
government, and enabling the U.S. to better understand Taiwan's
interest in promoting democracy, human rights and peace at home and
internationally.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Ministry officials said the ministry did indeed sign a
three-year contract with BGR in March, under which the ministry will
pay US$4.5 million to the company from 2005 to 2008. The ministry
also signed a contract with Laster Wolff.
</P>
<P>
The officials said the ministry has yet to assess the
effectiveness of hiring PR companies to lobby for the country.
</P>
<P>
The KMT legislative caucus demanded that the ministry publish not
just its "buy America" projects, but all other projects in Central
America and the Caribbean, where Taiwan's diplomatic allies are
concentrated but where scandals have erupted involving Taiwanese
government donations.
</P>
<P>
KMT Caucus Deputy Secretary-General Pan Wei-kang claimed that
Chen's visits to these countries have turned into "bribery scandals"
rather than expanding Taiwan's international space.
</P>
<P>
KMT Legislator Kuo Su-chun said that during the past five years,
Chen has spent more than US$500 million during his nine visits to
foreign allies in food aid, cash donations and funds for building
museums.
</P>
<P>
"Why doesn't he think of our own compatriots who are suffering
from various natural disasters, particularly those poor children who
cannot afford tuition and or even school lunches?" she asked.
</P>
<P>
Su Chi quoted Foreign Ministry documents as saying Chen has hired
at least 12 PR firms in the U.S., much more than Lee Teng-hui, who
was president from 1988 to 2000, and yet Taiwan's relations with the
U.S. are not in good shape, its bid to join the United Nations is
going nowhere, and worse, its donations to Central American countries
have turned into one political scandal after another, proving that
the government's diplomatic record is "worse than poor."
</P>
<P>
The DPP legislative caucus accused the KMT caucus of
"humiliating, besmirching and striking at the president" who has been
working hard to expand Taiwan's foreign relations.
</P>
<P>
DPP Caucus Secretary-General William C.T. Lai charged that the
KMT lawmakers are acting like "Taiwan's Quisling, " trying to invite
China to hit Taiwan, actions that show "it does not deserve to be
Taiwan's opposition party."

MAYOR ACCEPTS RESIGNATION OF TAIPEI'S TOP CIVIL AFFAIRS OFFICIAL
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Sept.  21 (CNA)
(By Han Nai-kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou accepted the
resignation of city government Civil Affairs Department chief Ho
Hung-jung Wednesday, saying that he respects Ho's decision, even
though Ho violated no city government regulations.
</P>
<P>
Ho, 39, who joined the city government last August, tendered his
resignation after the media gave wide publicity to an accusation by
Wang Shih-chien, a city councilor of the Democratic Progressive
Party, that Ho neglected his duty early this month when Typhoon
Khanun hit Taiwan because he was vacationing with his secretary in
Bali.
</P>
<P>
Ma pointed out that Ho asked for leave before he went abroad
Sept. 7, and that the Central Weather Bureau's typhoon warning was
not issued until 5 p.m. Sept. 9. Therefore, he said, Ho did not
violate any city government regulations.
</P>
<P>
The Taipei mayor, who is also chairman of Taiwan's main
opposition party, the Kuomintang (KMT), added that he understood that
Ho resigned because he wanted to be free from any burden when he
takes legal action against Wang for allegedly spreading a rumor that
he was having an affair with his secretary and claiming that they
checked into the same hotel room.
</P>
<P>
Later Wednesday, Ho, accompanied by his wife, Lin Wen-shu, filed
a complaint at the District Public Prosecutor's Office of Taipei
against Wang, seeking damages for "malicious defamation" of his
reputation.
</P>
<P>
However, Wang also went to the Prosecutor's Office and countered
with a lawsuit, claiming that Ho made a "false accusation." He
claimed that he did not make any personal attacks against Ho, but
only questioned whether it was justified for Ho to spend a vacation
with his secretary during a typhoon when he should have been at a
disaster prevention and relief center.
</P>
<P>
Wang added that he never mentioned the name of Ho's secretary,
and that Ho's private life and morals are none of his concern.
</P>
<P>
Ho's wife defended her husband, saying that she trusted him 100
percent. She explained that she had planned to go with her husband on
the trip but did not make it because, as an employee of the Taiwan
Business Bank, she had to support her colleagues in a series of
sit-ins.
</P>
<P>
She explained that Ho and his secretary checked into the same
villa, not the same room.

OVER 30,000 TAIWAN STUDENTS WENT ABROAD IN 2004
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Sept.  21 (CNA)

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
More than 30,000 Taiwan students went
abroad to study in 2004, nearly 80 percent of whom opted to go to
English-speaking countries, according to tallies made public
Wednesday by the government.
</P>
<P>
A total of 32,525 Taiwan students applied for visas for academic
purposes with foreign representative offices in Taiwan last year, up
by 23.6 percent over the 2003 figure but down by 3.7 percent from the
peak number posted in 2002, statistics compiled by the Cabinet-level
Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics (DGBAS)
show.
</P>
<P>
The United States attracted the largest number of students --
14,054 -- while Britain and Australia came second and third, luring
9,207 and 2,246 students from Taiwan, respectively. The three
countries wooed some 78 percent of Taiwan's overall students that
went abroad last year.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, a total of 9,616 foreign students came to
Taiwan to study in 2004, an increase of 23 percent over the
year-earlier level, the same tallies show. A vast majority of 7,647
of them chose to learn Chinese at language centers, while the
remaining 1,969 studied business management, social sciences,
economics and engineering at universities.
</P>
<P>
DGBAS officials said it is worth noting that 181 foreign students
specialized in engineering, double the 2003 level.

CPC POSTED LOSS FOR AUGUST: MOEA

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Troubled by high crude oil prices in the
world market, Chinese Petroleum Corp. (CPC) posted a loss of NT$2.512
billion (US$76 million) in August, becoming the only one of the seven
state-run companies to operate in the red for that month, according
to a Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) report.
</P>
<P>
However, the CPC still managed pre-tax earnings of NT$13.685
billion for the first eight months of this year, accounting for 91.5
percent of the full-year profit target required by the government,
according to officials of the MOEA's Commission of National
Corporations.
</P>
<P>
The seven state-run units -- the CPC, Taiwan Power Company,
Taiwan Sugar Company, Taiwan Provincial Water Company, China
Shipbuilding Corp., Aerospace Industrial Development Corp. and Tang
Eng Iron Works Corp., Ltd. -- posted combined pre-tax earnings of
NT$550 million for August and earned an aggregate profit of NT$15.774
billion for the January-August period, more than double the target
set by the government for the whole of the year, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
MOEA officials predicted that the CPC oil procurement cost will
hit US$59 per barrel for September if global oil prices remain at
their present high levels.
</P>
<P>
Premier Frank Hsieh said that the government will allow a
three-month observation period before deciding whether to permit the
CPC to further hike oil prices in the home market.

FALUN GONG PRACTITIONERS PRESENT PROTEST LETTER TO H.K. GOVERNMENT
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Hong Kong,  Sept. 21 (CNA)
(By Lu Chien-hui and Luis Huang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Nearly 30 Falun Gong practitioners from
Taiwan and Hong Kong asked Hong Kong Chief Executive Donald Tsang
Wednesday to deliver an open protest letter to Chinese President Hu
Jintao on their behalf.
</P>
<P>
They marched from the Hong Kong High Court to the headquarters of
the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region to present the letter
after a court tried a case concerning the forceful deportation of 80
Taiwanese Falun Gong followers by the Hong Kong authorities in late
February 2003.
</P>
<P>
According to a spokesman for the Hong Kong Association of Falun
Dafa, the letter asked the Hong Kong court to persist in judicial
independence and to urge the Beijing authorities to respect the
"universal values" of freedom and human rights.
</P>
<P>
The Taiwanese Falun Gong practitioners separately visited Hong
Kong Feb. 20 and Feb. 21, 2003 to attend a Falun Gong exchange
conference but were denied entry at the airport and forcibly turned
away by Hong Kong police even though they had valid Hong Kong visas.
</P>
<P>
A number of female practitioners were injured due to forcible
deportation by the Hong Kong police and filed a lawsuit to the Hong
Kong court against the violation of their human rights.
</P>
<P>
They also accused the Hong Kong government of using violent means
during the deportation process and demanded punitive compensation.
</P>
<P>
Originating in mainland China, Falun Gong now has millions of
adherents around the world. Beijing branded the group as a cult
organization and banned it in 1999.

PREMIER CALLS FOR `RESURRECTION OF WARMTH, TRUST'
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Sept.  21 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Premier Frank Hsieh said Wednesday he
looks forward to a "resurrection of love and trust" that prevailed in
Taiwan in the wake of the 921 earthquake six years ago.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a Cabinet weekly meeting, Hsieh noted that Wednesday
marked the sixth anniversary of the devastating 921 earthquake that
rattled Taiwan in 1999.
</P>
<P>
"Its aftermath was truly a painful period for us. Nevertheless,
it was also a moment when the people of Taiwan were most affectionate
and unified. Many volunteers dedicated themselves to post-disaster
relief and reconstruction work out of humanitarian concerns. There
were a lot of heart-warming stories during that period, " Hsieh
recalled.
</P>
<P>
At that time, Hsieh was mayor of the southern port city of
Kaohsiung, whose residents alone donated between NT$500 million and
NT$600 million to help earthquake victims and the Kaohsiung city
government built temporary shelters for surviving victims in Tungship
and Chushan townships in central Taiwan, which took the brunt of the
devastation, Hsieh said, adding that many southern Taiwan artists and
writers also traveled regularly to many of the hardest-hit regions to
offer counseling services or stage cultural activities to help
surviving victims heal their psychological wounds.
</P>
<P>
Lamenting that Taiwan society has become far more polarized
following the 2000 and 2004 presidential elections, Hsieh said he
earnestly hopes that the warmth, love and trust seen in the post-921
earthquake period can be resurrected in local society.
</P>
<P>
"I yearn to see love, compassion, benevolence and trust prevail
in our society without the need of a disaster," Hsieh said.

LI AO ASKS CHINESE COMMUNISTS TO LIGHTEN UP
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Beijing,  Sept. 21 (CNA)
(By Chou Hui-ying and S.C. Chang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taiwan writer and independent legislator
Li Ao used his first speech in China Wednesday to advise the 69
million members of the Communist Party of China (CPC) to relax and
stop "wearing a poker-face."
</P>
<P>
Li also said that he hoped that the CPC will live to see its
1,000th anniversary, and told an audience of about 500 people at
Peking University that all Chinese can "be carried on the back of the
party, which will allow it to serve us -- what's wrong with that?"
</P>
<P>
Liberalism has been restricted in China not because Mao Zedong
and Zhou Enlai wanted this, but because "part of the Communist Party
restricted the fundamental liberal spirit of their chairman and prime
minister," he said.
</P>
<P>
He quoted a passage from Mao's "Little Red Book" to prove that
Mao himself advocated the spirit of liberal debate: "Let the people
speak up. If they have good arguments, we listen to them; if they
don't, we refute them."
</P>
<P>
But he advised the faculty and students, whom he praised as "the
creme de la creme of Chinese society, " not to play the revolution
game with the CPC because unarmed civilians will never win over tanks
and guns.
</P>
<P>
"The trick in winning freedom of speech is to speak in such a way
that the other person listens to you; that is, express yourself in a
sober, rational and jovial manner," Li said, adding, "never bang the
table or throw chairs."
</P>
<P>
He said he knew many people were waiting to see whether he --
being often characterized as mischievous and having a no-holds-barred
style -- would dare criticize the CPC on its home turf. Li said that
for now, he would only like to praise the early Republican-era
warlords whom the CPC and the Nationalist Party (Kuomintang -- KMT)
had overthrown.
</P>
<P>
Li said the warlords had been broad-minded enough to make KMT
member Tsai Yuan-pei president of Peking University, and allowed him
to preach liberalism and the values of the universal spirit there,
"So how are we qualified to criticize the warlords?"
</P>
<P>
Another liberal-minded scholar, Hu Shih, once said in Beijing,
"If you fight for your individual freedom, you are fighting for your
country's freedom, " a sentence that former U.S. President Bill
Clinton also quoted while in Beijing, said Li, whose father is a
Peking University alumnus.
</P>
<P>
Li continued to quote Hu Shih: "A group of slaves will never make
a liberal and progressive country; such a country can be made up only
of independent-minded and free-thinking people."
</P>
<P>
He said liberalism is made up of two things: self-reflection by
individuals, and resorting to the constitution by the government.
Thus, only highly cultured people can be called liberals and their
society a liberal one, he said.
</P>
<P>
The key to liberalism is an open mind, without which no one can
be called a liberal, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
To show his gratitude to Hu Shih, who he said had given him
NT$1,000 when he was down and out, Li Ao said he has donated 350,000
yuan (NT$1.43 million) to have a bronze statute of Hu cast for
display in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
A student who has seen Li's TV programs said Li showed his usual
sharpness but still gave the impression that he was "a bit reserved"
about criticizing China's ruling party.
</P>
<P>
Some Chinese journalists covering the event said Li spoke on so
many things that they did not know how to write a story on the
speech, and that they would ask their bosses before writing their
reports.
</P>
<P>
As to party and government officials listening to Li's advice to
smile and relax, they simply remained poker-faced.

Taiwan business people working overseas
should return home "like salmon" and take advantage of the free trade
zones the government has set up in Kaohsiung and Taichung, Premier
Frank Hsieh said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Hsieh was attending a Mid-autumn Moon Festival gathering of
Taiwan business people working in China, an annual event sponsored by
the Straits Exchange Foundation.
</P>
<P>
He said the government was continuing to work on its policies of
direct charter cargo flights across the Taiwan Strait, fruit exports
to China and opening up Taiwan's tourism market to Chinese visitors.
</P>
<P>
As for the much-hoped-for direct "three links" between Taiwan and
China -- direct air, shipping and communications -- he said formal
discussions between the two governments must be held before direct
exchanges across the Strait can take place.
</P>
<P>
He blamed China for introducing its Anti-Secession Law that he
said had disrupted the government's schedule of opening the "three
links" and other exchanges with China.
</P>
<P>
Hsieh said the government is building more free trade ports that
offer tax privileges and boost export competitiveness to attract
Taiwan's business people back to their home country.

TWO INDEPENDENCE FACTIONS DISAGREE OVER TAIWAN SOVEREIGNTY

<TEXT>
<P>
The leader of World United Formosans for
Independence (WUFI) said Wednesday that he disagrees with the view
expressed by the Taiwan Defence Alliance (TDA) in an advertisement in
the Washington Post that Taiwan, like Puerto Rico and Guam, is an
autonomous territory of the United States.
</P>
<P>
Asked to comment on the advertisement placed in the American
daily Tuesday, WUFI Chairman Huang Chao-tang, who is also a
presidential adviser, stressed that Taiwan belongs to the 23 million
people who live on the island.
</P>
<P>
The TDA's advertisement said the United States should not mislead
the world with the "one China" policy as in the 1972 Shanghai
Communique, but should base its policy on the San Francisco Peace
Treaty signed on Sept. 8, 1951 between Japan and 48 of the 51
countries represented. Japan declared in the treaty it would give up
its sovereignty over Taiwan, Penghu and all its other offshore
islands.
</P>
<P>
However, the TDA maintained that Taiwan is not part of China, and
that the status of Taiwan is still undecided, as the Republic of
China on Taiwan and the People's Republic of China on the mainland
were not invited to the San Francisco Peace Conference, and neither
were parties to the San Francisco Treaty.
</P>
<P>
Huang said that even if Taiwan's status is still undecided,
eventually Taiwan's sovereignty must go to its people.

MARCH PLANNED FOR SUNDAY TO PROMOTE GOV'T WEAPONS PROCUREMENT PLAN
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Sept. 21 (CNA)

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A pro-ruling party group is organizing a
march on Sept. 25 in Taipei for the people to come out in support of
the government's proposal to buy a package of weaponry from the
United States.
</P>
<P>
The military procurement bill again failed to pass the
legislative Rules Committee Tuesday -- the 29th time the opposition
has killed the legislation from moving forward since the Ministry of
National Defense put forth the bill to the Legislative Yuan more than
a year ago.
</P>
<P>
Ng Chiau-tong, executive director of the Hand-in-Hand To Protect
Taiwan Alliance, which is organizing the "925 march, " said that the
event is designed to awaken the public consciousness and back the
government's military procurement plan at a time when Taiwan's
national security has come under increased military threats from
China.
</P>
<P>
Ng also voiced his suspicion that the opposition "pan-blue
alliance" of the Kuomintang (KMT) and its ally, the People First
Party (PFP), lack the determination to defend Taiwan and are part of
an orchestrated plot with the Chinese Communists because of their
repeated boycott of the military procurement bill.
</P>
<P>
Lee Yi-yang, secretary-general of the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) , said that the KMT and the PFP are plotting
to ruin Taiwan by preventing the bill from passing the legislative
floor.
</P>
<P>
Various DPP heavyweight lawmakers, including William C. T. Lai,
Trong Chai, and Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU) lawmaker Ho Ming-hao,
appealed to their supporters across Taiwan to display the people's

CHEN ARRIVES IN MIAMI FOR TRANSIT STOP EN ROUTE TO GUATEMALA
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Miami,  Florida,  Sept. 21 (CNA)
(By S. J. Tsai and Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President Chen Shui-bian arrived
in Miami Wednesday for a one-day layover en route to Central America
and the Caribbean for an official visit.
</P>
<P>
Chen, heading a group of high-ranking officials and business
leaders, flew to Miami after a 12-hour stopover in Anchorage, Alaska,
which was originally supposed to last two hours but was extended
because of the closure of Miami International Airport due to
Hurricane Rita.
</P>
<P>
Chen was greeted by David Lee, the ROC representative to the
United States, and William Brown, who, as acting chairman of the
American Institute in Taiwan (AIT) , is the top U.S. liaison officer
with Taiwan in the absence of formal diplomatic ties, upon his
arrival at Miami airport at 6: 20 a.m.
</P>
<P>
Chen reiterated his resolve to keep a low profile during his
current U.S. layover, saying he doesn't want to cause any trouble for
U.S. authorities while they are busy preventing hurricane damage.
</P>
<P>
During his stay, Chen will attend a luncheon to be given in his
honor by congressional members from southern Florida constituencies.
In the afternoon, he will meet with former Deputy Secretary of State
Richard Armitage and former Deputy Assistant Secretary of State
Randall Schriver at his hotel.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Chen will hold an hour-long teleconference with 10-plus
U.S. Congressional Taiwan Caucus members. The Taiwan Caucus is a
pro-Taiwan group in the U.S. Congress.
</P>
<P>
In the evening, Chen will have dinner with Taiwan expatriates
residing in Florida.
</P>
<P>
The dinner was originally scheduled for Tuesday when Rep. Tom
Lantos (D-CA) , co-chairman of the U.S. Congressional Human Rights
Caucus, was to have presented a human rights award to Chen in
recognition of his long-term efforts to boost human rights, democracy
and freedom in Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
After the dinner was rescheduled for Wednesday, it remains
uncertain whether the award presentation will take place as
scheduled.
</P>
<P>
Lantos once said in private that if the presentation is not held
Wednesday, he doesn't rule out the possibility of him traveling to
Taiwan later to present the award to Chen in person.
</P>
<P>
Chen, accompanied by his entourage, is scheduled to leave Miami
to start his Central America and Caribbean diplomatic tour that will
take him to Guatemala, the Dominican Republic, Nicaragua, St. Vincent
and the Grenadines, as well as St. Kitts and Nevis.
</P>
<P>
During his 12-hour transit stop in Anchorage, Alaska, Gov. Frank
Murkowski hosted a luncheon in honor of Chen and his entourage. Chen
later toured the Portage glacier region in Alaska.

individual French scholars or research bodies were awarded. In the
future, outstanding European researchers and institutes will also be
qualified to compete for the award.
</P>

TAIWAN INCOME GAP AT FOUR-YEAR LOW: CEPD
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Sept.  21 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The income gap between the richest and
poorest families in Taiwan has remained stable this year at a
four-year low thanks to the government's social welfare programs, the
Cabinet-level Council for Economic Planning and Development (CEPD)
reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Incomes of the country's richest families average 6.03 times that
of the poorest families last year and the lowest, the lowest rate
since 2001, CEPD officials said, noting that the gap widened to a
peak of 6.39 fold in 2001.
</P>
<P>
From the 1960s to the 1980s, Taiwan's income gap stood between
four times and five times, with the levels increasingly growing to
5.18 times in the 1990s and to 5.55 times in 2000 before surging to
6.39 times in 2001, the officials elaborated. The gap began to drop
over the past three years, with it falling to 6.03 times in 2004.
</P>
<P>
The officials hailed the falls over the past three years as
concrete evidence of the government's efforts to promote social
welfare programs that have benefited many low-income families, such
as low-interest loans for buying houses and various types of
government subsidies for the underprivileged and jobless workers.
</P>
<P>
Gauged by the Gini index, Taiwan scored 0.338 in the degree of
inequality in the distribution of family income, slightly poorer
compared to the 0.308 average of the member states of the
Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development but better than
South Korea's 0.35, Singapore's 0.48 and Hong Kong's 0.53, according
to a CEPD report.
</P>
<P>
The Gini index is one of the most used indicators of social and
economic conditions for measuring inequality in the distribution of
family income in a country. A 0.4 rating is the warning threshold.

ALLIES SPEAK FOR TAIWAN AT U.N. GENERAL ASSEMBLY
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Sept. 21 (CNA)
(By Luis Huang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two of the Republic of China's diplomatic
allies protested Wednesday against the U.N. General Committee
inadequately handling discussions of two proposals concerning the
ROC's bid to join the United Nations, according to officials from the
Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
</P>
<P>
During a general debate session of the 60th U.N. General
Assembly, representatives from the Solomon Islands and Gambia lodged
their protests accusing the General Committee chairman of limiting
the time and number of representatives who were allowed to voice
their views when the committee proceeded to discuss whether the two
proposals would be included in the agenda earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Foreign Affairs Tan Sun Chen thanked representatives
from the two diplomatic allies, saying if the U.N. cannot allow its
member states to sufficiently express their views, U.N. efforts to
promote its democratic concept will be in vain.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the minister also expressed gratitude to Nicaraguan
Foreign Affairs Minister Norman Caldera, Kiribati President Anote
Tong, and Guatemala Foreign Affairs Minister Jorge Brize for their
support for Taiwan's bid to gain a seat in the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
Since 1993, Taiwan has tried every year through its diplomatic
allies to have its U.N. membership bid placed on the General
Assembly's agenda. However, it has been unsuccessful due to Beijing's
obstruction.
</P>
<P>
When the United Nations was founded in 1945, the Republic of
China was one of its founding members. However, it has been shut out
of the body since 1971 when U.N. Resolution No. 2758 gave the "China"
seat to the People's Republic of China at the ROC's expense.

COURT DEBATE BEGINS ON PRESIDENT'S CIVIL SUIT AGAINST TALK SHOW HOST
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Sept. 21 (CNA)
(By Han Nai-kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Taipei District Court began debating
Wednesday on the civil suit filed by President Chen Shui-bian against
a talk show host on the grounds that he made an unfounded allegation
that Chen presented a US$1 million check to former Panamanian
President Mireya Moscoso.
</P>
<P>
The president, who is on a state visit to Central American
countries, filed the lawsuit on Oct. 20 last year. A week later, Jaw
Shaw-kong, chairman of UFO Radio, filed a countersuit seeking to
restore his reputation while claiming that he obtained the
information from a Web site.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to new media Wednesday, Jaw said that if the president
is willing to withdraw the case, he would also be willing to retract
his suit.
</P>
<P>
Jaw insisted that it was a fact that the government of Taiwan had
given money to Panama, and that using taxpayers' money to conduct
diplomacy is an issue that should be subject to public scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
He said it could be the Ministry of Foreign Affairs or another
government agency that delivered the check, and that the president
needed not put himself under the public spotlight by filing the
lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
Jaw added that both sides would waste a lot of time on the suit
and the countersuit.
</P>
<P>
The Presidential Office's deputy public relations director said
Jaw will have to wait until the president returns from his overseas
trip for a response.
</P>
<P>
The court will hear the case again on Nov. 16.

TAIWAN ASKED TO INVEST MORE IN NATIONAL DEFENSE
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Miami,  Sept. 21 (CNA)
(By S.J. Tsai and P.C.Tang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two former ranking U.S. State Department
officials on Wednesday said that they hope that Taiwan can do more in
its national defense investment and that its legislature can pass the
arms procurement bill as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
Richard Armitage, former deputy secretary of state, and Randall
Schriver, former deputy assistant secretary of state, made the
remarks ahead of paying a courtesy call to President Chen Shui-bian,
who is currently in Miami for a one-day transit stopover en route to
Central America.
</P>
<P>
President Chen, at the head of a group of high-ranking officials
and business leaders, arrived in the city earlier in the day from
Anchorage, Alaska where he had made a 12-hour stopover.
</P>
<P>
In response to media questions regarding what issues he will
discuss with Chen during the meeting, Armitage said that he hopes to
have a better understanding of the president's current thoughts on
cross-Taiwan Strait issues.
</P>
<P>
Touching on how to resolve the problems related to the
long-stalled arms procurement bill in Taiwan's Legislative Yuan, the
former deputy secretary of state said that he will first discuss the
matter with Taiwan's head of state. "I hope they will pass (the
bill)," he added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Schriver also told the reporters that the United
States safeguards the security in the Taiwan Strait in accordance
with the Taiwan Relations Act. If Taiwan prefers not to invest a
little bit more in its national defense, "it will become harder for
us," he said.
</P>
<P>
Besides the two former officials, Terresa Shaheen, former
chairwoman of the American Institute in Taiwan (AIT) , a
quasi-official organization in charge of U.S. relations with Taiwan
in the absence of diplomatic relations between the two nations, also
met with the president.
</P>
<P>
The two former officials also joined AIT Honorary Chairman
William Brown to participate in a luncheon hosted in the president's
honor by congressional members from southern Florida constituencies.

PRESIDENT CHEN WILLING TO HOLD 'RATIONAL DIALOGUE' WITH PRC PRESIDENT
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Miami,  Sept. 21 (CNA)
(By S. J. Tsai and S.C. Chang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Republic of China President Chen Shui-bian
said Wednesday in Miami that he is willing to hold "rational
dialogue" with his People's Republic of China counterpart Hu Jintao
without any preconditions.
</P>
<P>
Such dialogue, which could be held any time and anywhere, would
be aimed at creating a "window of opportunity" for "democratic Taiwan
and democratic China to co-exist," the president said.
</P>
<P>
He made the offer during a banquet given by Taiwanese expatriates
in the southern Florida city in honor of him as he received a human
rights award from the human rights caucus of the U.S. Congress via
teleconference. The president and his entourage were on a one-day
transit stopover en route to Central America for an official visit.
</P>
<P>
Chen pointed out that "democratic Taiwan" and "human rights
Taiwan" have been realized despite the climate of Chinese military
intimidation, diplomatic suppression and the threats of China's
united front tactics.
</P>
<P>
Countries around the world can be divided into two groups today,
he said: one is a "community of democracies" that embraces freedom
and progress and pursues peace, stability and prosperity; and the
other is one of "anti-democracies" that deprive the people of their
rights to freedom and democracy while threatening regional and global
security and order with militarism and terrorism.
</P>
<P>
He said he fully understands the world community is expecting
Taiwan and China to reopen dialogue in order to maintain peace in the
Taiwan Strait.
</P>
<P>
"But I have to seriously remind the world community that the
problem between Taiwan and China is by no means a problem of A
working with B to jointly manage or maintain peace in the Taiwan
Strait," he said.
</P>
<P>
The crux of the issue is that China is avoiding dialogue with
Taiwan's popularly elected government and, worse, is targeting
missiles at Taiwan and using its so-called "Anti-Secession Law" in an
attempt to tackle the issue through non-peaceful means, Chen
stressed.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated his thanks to the Bush government for repeatedly
urging Beijing to talk with Taiwan's popularly elected government and
president, a message that he claimed shows the United States' respect
of "democratic Taiwan" and "human rights Taiwan."
</P>
<P>
The U.S. position also shows that cross-strait relations must be
handled under the principle of respecting the 23 million people in
Taiwan and gaining their consent, Chen added.
</P>
<P>
"In my mind, I have a beautiful vision about cross-strait
relations, " he told the banquet participants, that is, a "democratic
Taiwan" and "human rights Taiwan" will live in peace with a
"democratic China" and "human rights China" and the two will work
together for their mutual benefit and joint prosperity.
</P>
<P>
Based on that vision and on his analysis of the world situation,
Chen said he would like to show his sincerity and good will again to
"the leader across the strait" and invite him to shake hands and hold
rational dialogue so that they together can open up a "window of
opportunity for cross-strait peace and democracy."
</P>
<P>
Whether that window will ever be opened depends on people on both
sides of the strait demonstrating their creativity and patience, and
on the international community continuing to show its support and
concern, the president said.
</P>
<P>
In this regard, he said the congressional human rights caucus
could play a pivotal role in linking "democratic Taiwan" with
"democratic China" and linking "human rights Taiwan" with "human
rights China."
</P>
<P>
On behalf of the U.S. congressional caucus, David Ta-wei Lee,
Taiwan's top envoy to the United States, presented the human rights
award to the president.

TAIWAN PROPOSES 'ZERO-TARIFF' ON SPORT GOODS, BICYCLE IMPORTS
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Geneva,  Sept. 21 (CNA)
(By C.H. Lu and P.C.Tang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taiwan raised a proposal Wednesday under
the framework of the World Trade Organization (WTO) suggesting that
members of the organization agree to cancel customs tariffs on
imports of sports goods as well as bicycles and spare parts,
according to a source close to the island's permanent mission to the
WTO.
</P>
<P>
The source said that harmonizing or cancelling customs tariffs in
a sector-by-sector approach is one of the important steps in the
Non-Agricultural Market Access (NAMA) talks of the Doha New Round of
Trade Negotiations, adding that in order to achieve the goal of
further liberalizing world trade and benefiting Taiwan's exports, the
island has decided to push for "zero-tariff" for sports goods and
bicycle products.
</P>
<P>
During a NAMA meeting held the same day, Lin Yi-fu, Taiwan's
permanent representative to the world trade body, clearly explained
why Taiwan has raised the proposal, saying that the "Doha
Declaration" notes that the WTO members should cut or cancel customs
tariffs for those export products that are beneficial to developing
countries as they share 72 percent and 87 percent of the world's
export markets for sports goods and bicycle products, respectively.
</P>
<P>
Pointing out that trade liberalization in sports goods and
bicycles will fulfill various useful functions to help benefit both
developing countries and developed countries, the representative also
said that bicycles are beneficial to the natural environment and that
sports goods have social and cultural value.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that exports of bicycles and spare parts amounted
to US$4.154 billion globally in 2003, and Taiwan ranked second in
this category for the year, with exports of such products totalling
US$970 million.
</P>
<P>
However, several of the world's major markets continue to have
tariffs of as high as 40 percent on such products, which causes huge
losses for exporters of these products.
</P>
<P>
The statistics also show that exports of sports goods amounted to
US$11.743 billion globally during the same period, with Taiwan
exports of such products totalling US$1.36 billion, ranking the
island third in the world in this category. However, some countries
continue to impose tariffs of up to 35 percent on such products.
</P>
<P>
In the proposal, Taiwan also said that a cancellation of import
customs tariffs and an intensive strengthening of market access
liberalization will certainly promote and expand trade in developing
countries and developed countries.
</P>
<P>
Lin also said that Taiwan welcomes other WTO members to give an
active and positive response to the proposal in order to achieve the
goal of further liberalizing world trade.
</P>
<P>
According to the Taiwan mission, Japan and Singapore have voiced
their support for the proposal, while Thailand has expressed support
for the part of the proposal concerning the cancellation of import
customs tariffs on bicycles and spare parts.

CONGRESSMEN WELCOME ROC PRESIDENT MAKING TRANSIT IN U.S.
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Washington,  Sept 21 (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Fifteen members of the United States
Congress' Taiwan Caucus warmly welcomed ROC President Chen Shui-bian
who was making a transit stop in Miami en route to Central America
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Through a teleconference, the congressmen and women congratulated
Chen for winning the Congress' human rights caucus' award, and some
of them suggested that the U.S. government change its policy and
welcome Chen to Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
Under a long-standing policy, leading officials of the ROC that
symbolize Taiwan's sovereignty, such as the president, vice
president, premier and foreign affairs minister, cannot visit the
U.S. capital.
</P>
<P>
Scott Garrett, who invited Chen to visit his New Jersey
constituency, said probably the political climate will change in the
near future so that President Chen will be able to visit D.C. If that
happens, it will be a major move forward, he added.
</P>
<P>
Ileana Ros-Lehtinen said that during the teleconference, she told
Chen that he has many supporters in the U.S. Congress. David Wu said
he also hopes to greet Chen in the capital city.
</P>
<P>
In response to some Taiwan legislators' opposition to giving the
human rights award to Chen, Congressman Steve Chabot, one of the
caucus' four co-chairpersons, said just like the U.S., Taiwan is a
democracy where people can express their views.
</P>
<P>
In the U.S., he noted, some people criticize President George W.
Bush whereas others praise him, adding it's a pity that in the
People's Republic of China, people do not enjoy freedom of
expression.
</P>
<P>
Chabot said he was delighted to see President Chen win the human
rights award because the president has been fighting not just for
Taiwan's human rights, but also for those in other parts of the
world.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the award should be presented in Washington, and
it's quite unfortunate that cannot happen. He said he believes the
U.S. policy of banning senior ROC officials from visiting D.C. will
change sooner or later.
</P>
<P>
Those present at the teleconference quoted Chen as expressing
Taiwan's concerns about the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina in New
Orleans and the Gulf Coast.
</P>
<P>
Chen was also quoted as telling the caucus members that Taiwan's
democratic development is irreversible while Taiwan's from the ground
up development of democracy can serve as a model for China if it
wants to develop democracy.
</P>
<P>
Dana Rohrabacher, another co-chairman of the caucus, said the
U.S. is adopting a "cowardly" foreign policy by fearing to offend
Chinese dictators and not daring to show greater concern for those
who are morally superior to these dictators, such as President Chen
of the ROC.
</P>
<P>
Rohrabacher recommended that Chen, as a leader of a great
democracy and a model for Asian countries, do more to assist the
democratic development of Myanmar by supporting its people in their
fight against the country's dictatorial regime that is supported by
Beijing.
</P>
<P>
He welcomed Chen to visit his home in California, where he said
he will organize a big welcome party in honor of Chen and people
won't have to talk to the guest of honor via teleconference.
</P>
<P>
Sherrod Brown, also a caucus co-chairman, said it is absurd that
Chen cannot visit Washington as a leader of a democracy given that he
was allowed to before he became president. Brown had met Chen in his
congressional office before he won the historic election in 2000.
</P>
<P>
Also greeting Chen at the teleconference were Robert Wexler, a
caucus co-chairman, and Madeleine Bordallo, Mario Diaz-Balart, Phil
Gingrey, Joe Wilson, Darrel Issa, Charles Rangle, Debbie
Wasserman-Schultz and Roscoe Bartlett.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the Taiwan caucus members, quite a number of
heavyweight congressmen and women and senators called the president
at his Miami hotel to extend their greetings and best wishes,
including Senate Majority Leader Bill First and House Majority Leader
Tom Delay and Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi.
</P>
<P>
Tim Johnson and George Allen, co-chairmen of the Senate's Taiwan
Caucus; Senator Diane Feinstein; Roy Blunt, Senate Majority Whip; and
Henry Hyde, chairman of the House Foreign Relations Committee, also
made calls to the president.
</P>
<P>
Since its formation in 1983, 210 congressmen and women have
joined the Congress human rights caucus whose purpose is to monitor
human rights violations across the world and to encourage improvement
of human rights conditions in all countries.
</P>
<P>
The House of Representatives passed Joint Resolution No. 237
Sept. 15 welcoming President Chen to transit in the U.S., and
congratulating him for winning the human rights award and praising
his efforts and determination to maintain peace and stability across
the Taiwan Strait.

JAPAN'S VISA WAIVER TO TAIWAN TOURISTS SIGNIFICANT: FOREIGN MINISTRY
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Sept.  22 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs said
Thursday that it is historically significant for Japan to drop its
visa requirement for Taiwan tourists.
</P>
<P>
Japan has agreed to offer permanent visa-free privileges to
travelers from Taiwan starting Sept. 26.
</P>
<P>
Gary Lin, director-general of ministry's department of East Asia
and Pacific affairs, noted that Taiwan and Japan have no diplomatic
relations, but the Japanese Diet passed a new bill Aug. 5 to allow
for permanent, visa-free status for Taiwan passport holders. In
contrast, although China has diplomatic relations with Japan, Chinese
still are not afforded the same preferential treatment.
</P>
<P>
Lin said that only Republic of China nationals who have
registered their domiciles in Taiwan can enjoy the visa-free
treatment.
</P>
<P>
He also said that Taiwanese tourists can only stay in Japan for
90 days at a time, and should not overstay. The visa-free treatment
will be restricted to tourists, and they cannot work, or perform or
engage in money-earning activities. The new regulation will also not
be applicable to those wishing to study in Japan.
</P>
<P>
He urged the public to abide by Japanese law while touring in the
country, saying that people must not betray the trust offered them.

KAOHSIUNG CITY COUNCIL INVITES TWO FORMER MAYORS TO REPORT ON MRT
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Kaohsiung,  Sept.  22 (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Kaohsiung City Council decided
Thursday to invite Wu Den-yih and Frank Hsieh, two former mayors, to
make detailed reports on how the decision was reached to adopt the
"build, operate and transfer" (BOT) model to build the city's mass
rapid transit (MRT) system.
</P>
<P>
Wu, who lost his re-election bid in late 1998, is now a
Kuomintang (KMT) legislator and Hsieh, who succeeded Wu as mayor, has
since moved to Taipei to be premier in the Chen Shui-bian government.
</P>
<P>
Since the Kaohsiung MRT scandal erupted in August, both men have
been alleging that the other should be held accountable for making
the decision to build the system under the BOT model.
</P>
<P>
At a special meeting Thursday, council members Lin Shou-shan,
Wang Ling-chiao and others recommended that the council invite the
two former mayors to submit written reports on how each of them was
involved in the decision-making process.
</P>
<P>
Lin stressed that if they accept the invitations, the council
should respect their rights and refrain from asking questions either
orally or in writing.
</P>
<P>
Only when council members act carefully with regard to the two
mayors' reports and refrain from launching personal attacks on the
two guests of honor will city residents be able to see the truth
about the BOT decision-making process, Lin added.
</P>
<P>
After hearing opinions from other members, council speaker Tsai
Chien-hsing agreed that he will send official invitations to Wu and
Hsieh.
</P>
<P>
The MRT scandal erupted after Thai laborers working on the
project rioted in protest of their poor living conditions and
unreasonable treatment by Huapan Administration Consultant Co., which
was charged with bringing them into the country and managing them.
</P>
<P>
Kaohsiung Rapid Transit Corp. (KRTC) , which was formed to build
and run the system, has canceled its contract with Huapan and KRTC
Vice Chairman Chen Min-hsien, a minority shareholder in the NT$180
billion project, is now under judicial investigation on suspicion of
corruption.
</P>
<P>
Kaohsiung's acting Mayor Chen Chi-mai, who replaced Hsieh after
he became premier, and Council for Labor Affairs Chairwoman Chen Chu
have since resigned to take their share of political responsibility
for the riot. Premier Hsieh has also apologized for the government's
failure to supervise the construction of the system and the
management of the workers.

MOFA DENIES MAKING PROMISE TO BUILD AIRPORT FOR GUATEMALA

<TEXT>
<P>
Taiwan has no plans and has not made any
promise to help Guatemala build a new international airport or set up
an international aviation company, Ministry of Foreign Affairs
spokesman Michel Lu said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Lu blasted such groundless claims and denied any plan or pledge
in this regard by Taiwan toward the Central American diplomatic ally
despite the fact that President Chen Shui-bian will sign a free trade
agreement and an air-sea transport accord with Guatemalan President
Oscar Berger when he arrives in the country later the same day for an
official visit from a stopover in Miami.
</P>
<P>
Lu's remarks came after opposition People First Party (PFP)
Legislator Sun Ta-chien claimed that Guatemala has asked Taiwan to
construct an international airport and open an airline company for it
in exchange for its continued diplomatic recognition of Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Urging the government not to further engage in "dollar diplomacy"
for the sake of the national interests and the younger generations in
Taiwan, Sun said that since Chen came to power five years ago,
several scandals concerning such diplomacy, totalling at least US$5
billion, with the country's diplomatic allies in Central and South
America have surfaced.
</P>
<P>
The government must stop using such means to try to appease those
countries that are seeking to gain monetary benefits by taking
advantage of the long-standing political gridlock between the two
sides of the Taiwan Strait, he said.
</P>
<P>
The PFP lawmaker, however, refused to identify the sources who
provided him with the information, saying only that the information
comes from reliable high ranking officials in the Guatemalan
government.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, President Chen is slated to arrive in the Nicaraguan
capital of Managua Sept. 25, where he will take part in a regional
summit the next day with the heads of state of several Republic of
China diplomatic allies.
</P>
<P>
Chen will also visit the Dominican Republic, St. Vincent and the
Grenadines, and St. Kitts and Neis during his current 12-day tour in
Latin America, where many of the ROC's 26 diplomatic allies are

<P>
Diplomatic ties between Taiwan and Panama
remain solid and stable, and Panama has repeatedly assured Taiwan
that its development of ties with China is only limited to economic
exchanges, Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) spokesman Michel Lu
said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Lu made the remarks in response to a media report that Panamanian
President Martin Espino Torrijos will not attend a regional summit
between the ROC and various of its diplomatic allies in Central
America slated for Sept. 26 in Managua, Nicaragua, citing reported
possible changes to diplomatic relations between the two countries as
the reason.
</P>
<P>
Lu said that the report was incorrect and that after having
contacted the Republic of China Embassy in Panama City, he was told
that Torrijos will take part in the summit meeting as scheduled, and
that the Panamanian president will hold bilateral talks with
President Chen Shui-bian on the sidelines of the summit.
</P>
<P>
Ranking Panamanian government officials, including the president,
the vice president and the foreign minister, have also repeatedly
given their assurances that Taiwan-Panama diplomatic links will
remain unchanged and that Panama-China ties are confined to trade and
commercial activities, Lu stressed.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Chen is slated to arrive in Managua from Guatemala
Sept. 25. Chen will arrive in Guatemala later Thursday after a
stopover in Miami -- the first leg of a 12-day Centra American and
Caribbean tour where he will sign a free trade agreement and an
air-sea transport pact. He also will visit the Dominican Republic,
St. Vincent and the Grenadines, and St. Kitts and Nevis.

Typhoon Damrey will not make landfall on
Taiwan, but people living in northeastern, eastern and southeastern
parts of the island should guard against torrential rain, the Central
Weather Bureau (CWB) said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The CWB issued a sea warning Wednesday as the typhoon entered the
Bashi Channel.

Taiwan's southernmost tip of Oluanpi. It was moving west at 10 kph
toward the waters around Pratas Island, according to the CWB's
forecast.
</P>
<P>
CWB meteorologists said that torrential rain is likely to
continue until late Friday. They warned people living in mountainous
areas of northern, central and southern Taiwan to guard against
landslides, falling rocks and mudflows, and that those living in
low-lying areas should watch for flooding.

2005 TAIWAN BUSINESS ALLIANCE FORUM HELD IN TAIPEI
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Sept. 22 (CNA)
(By Luis Huang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The 2005 Taiwan Business Alliance Forum,
organized by the Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) to attract
foreign investors, took place Thursday in the Taipei International
Conference Center with representatives from more than 400 domestic
and foreign businesses participating.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Kazunobu Tanaka of Japan, the founding chairman of the Asia
Nanotech Forum, gave the keynote speech on global trends and business
opportunities for nanotechnology at the one-day forum, while Matthew
Nordan of the United States, vice president of Lux Research, Inc.,
spoke on the role of venture capital in nanotechnology funding and
investment strategies.
</P>
<P>
Since the United States launched its National Nanotechnology
Initiative in 2000, almost every country in the world has attached
great importance to nanotechnology development and applications, with
a variety of national R&amp;D programs on nanoscience and nanotechnology
having been organized over the past several years, Tanaka said.
</P>
<P>
Global funding to various nanotechnology research and development
programs has been constantly increasing, with the total investment in
this area reaching US$9.5 billion in 2004, Tanaka said. He added that
the proportions of Taiwan's and South Korea's total investment as a
ratio to the gross domestic product (GDP) are even higher than those
of the European Union and the United States.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan is planning to invest US$630 million in nanotechnology
infrastructure and education, as well as relevant research and
development programs during the coming six years, while South Korea
will invest US$1.3 billion by 2010, Tanaka pointed out.
</P>
<P>
According to Tanaka, Taiwan has devoted itself to eco-friendly
nanotechnology research and development, thus becoming a pioneer in
the field.
</P>
<P>
There are around 1,200 nanotechnology companies in the world, and
half of them are in the United States, Tanaka said. Although only a
few of them are operating at a profit, the nanotechnology industry
still has a rosy future and is expected to become a mainstream
industry in the next 10 years, with potential business opportunities
reaching hundreds of billions by 2010.
</P>
<P>
Under Taiwan's National Science and Technology Program for
Nanoscience and Nanotechnology, the production value of the island's
nanotechnology-related industries is expected to exceed NT$300
billion (US$9.07 billion) by 2008.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Su Tsung-tsan, director of the Nanotechnology Research
Center under the Industrial Technology Research Institute, said that
Taiwan has successfully built its own nanotechnology brand and now
has over 250 companies engaging in nanotechnology-related businesses.
</P>
<P>
With the government's full support and Taiwan's excellent
geographic position, the island's nanotechnology industry has a great
potential for development, Su said, adding that foreign manufacturers
are welcome to carry out investment projects in cooperation with
their Taiwanese counterparts.

FIVE CHARITY GROUPS TO EXTEND HUMANITARIAN RELIEF TO CAMBODIA
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Sept. 22 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Five Taiwan charitable organizations are
jointly organizing a humanitarian relief delegation that will travel
to Cambodia to help people, particularly children, in a particularly
poverty-stricken area of the country.
</P>
<P>
The "Love of Taiwan" group, comprised of members of the Taiwan
Roots Medical Peace Corps (TRMPC) , the Field Relief Agency (FRA) ,
Compassion International, the Eden Social Welfare Foundation and
the Noordhoff Craniofacial Foundation, is scheduled to visit
Cambodia's northwest border town of Poipet Sept. 25-30, where it will
offer free medical services to the people there, many of whom are
victims of years of bloodshed, said TRMPC President Liu Chi-chun.
</P>
<P>
The delegation will include 16 medical professionals, all TRMPC
volunteers, who will take with them 600 kg of medication and medical
aid materials, as well as crutches, walking aids, white sticks for
the blind and 60 wheelchairs, Liu said.
</P>
<P>
Also going the Cambodia with the group will be 18 standard
blackboards, donated by the Taiwan International Lions Club 300-A2,
to be installed in 18 classrooms in a new middle school that the FRA
has helped build in Poipet, said FRA Secretary-General Yang Wei-ling.
</P>
<P>
Yang, a flight attendant-turned-philanthropist who founded the
FRA seven years ago and has traveled to Cambodia at least twice each
year for humanitarian relief work, described Poipet as a "war-torn,
poverty-stricken town on the border with Thailand, " where many
children are homeless orphans without schooling and many adults are
victims of the millions of landmines scattered throughout the area
during civil wars over the past several decades.
</P>
<P>
Believing that education is the best way to help people surmount
poverty, Yang has continued to build schools in Cambodia.
</P>
<P>
Besides schools, Yang has also established a library of Chinese
books, all of which have been transported from Taiwan. She has also
founded an orphanage and a vocational training center.
</P>
<P>
Yang offered her gratitude to the Taiwan International Lions Club
300-A2 for its donation of US$80,000 to fund the new Poipet school
and added that when the school opens Sept. 25, it will be capable of
allowing more than 1,000 poor children to attend school free of
charge.
</P>
<P>
"Education changes a child's fate, " is her belief and will be a
motto of the school, Yang noted.

CHINA MUST PUT ASIDE PREREQUISITE FOR  CROSS-STRAIT TALKS: MAC
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Sept. 22 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mainland Affairs Council Chairman Joseph
Wu urged China Thursday to put aside its "one China" prerequisite so
that both sides of the Taiwan Strait can resume talks as soon as
possible.
</P>
<P>
The nation's top China policy planner's words came in the wake of
President Chen Shui-bian's remarks earlier that he is willing to meet
with his Chinese counterpart, Hu Jintao, without preconditions and at
any time and venue.
</P>
<P>
Chen said over a banquet in Miami Wednesday en route to Central
America for an official visit that he is willing to meet Hu for
rational dialogue, hoping to open a window of opportunity for the
co-existence of a democratic Taiwan that respects human rights and of
a democratic China that also respects human rights.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the CNA, Wu said Chen's remarks reflect the
long-standing policy of the government.
</P>
<P>
He lamented that China has often made the "one China" a
prerequisite for resumed cross-strait talks, which has hindered
dialogue. If it continues, political disputes may never be settled,
he added.
</P>
<P>
In addition to political and leader dialogues, the government is
also hoping that both sides can engage in consultations on pragmatic
issues of mutual concern, he went on.
</P>
<P>
In view of the fact that the international community might not
understand Taiwan's stance on cross-strait dialogue, President Chen
has used different international occasions to display Taiwan's
willingness to talk with Beijing and its determination to pursue
cross-strait peace and stability, Wu said.
</P>
<P>
Wu also said that as a member of the Asia Pacific Economic
Cooperation (APEC) forum, Taiwan's leader should have the same right
to take part in its informal leadership meetings as other leaders.
</P>
<P>
Chen has continued to express his willingness to take part in
this year's APEC summit meeting Nov. 18-19 in Busan, South Korea,
hoping that China will not try to obstruct as it has in the past and
that the leaders across the Taiwan Strait can meet in a natural
atmosphere and seek reconciliation, Wu added.

RULING PARTY ECHOES PRESIDENT'S CALL FOR CHINA TALKS
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Sept.  22 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The ruling Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) echoed Thursday a call issued earlier that day by President
Chen Shui-bian for unconditional talks with China in the hope of
building peace in the Taiwan Strait.
</P>
<P>
Cheng Wen-tsang, head of the DPP's public relations department,
said that Beijing's reluctance to deal with the DPP and the nation's
duly elected president, and its unwillingness to recognize the
Republic of China's national status, has stalled positive
developments in cross-strait relations.
</P>
<P>
Should China continue avoiding talking with Taiwan and its
president, there is no way to build mutual trust and confidence,
Cheng said, adding that Chen's offer to talk with China, regardless
of venue, timing and without any prerequisites is rational and will
also meet the international community's high expectations for better
cross-strait ties.
</P>
<P>
When China also upholds democracy, peace and human rights as its
core and principal values, it will "naturally drop its military
intimidation of Taiwan," he predicted.
</P>
<P>
Chen made his latest peace overture to China at a banquet with
Taiwan immigrants in Florida en route to Guatemala -- the first leg
of a 12-day Central America and Caribbean tour that will also take
him to Nicaragua, the Dominican Republic, St. Vincent and the
Grenadines, and St. Kitts and Nevis.
</P>
<P>
Chen urged Beijing to join forces with Taiwan to create a window
of opportunity based on democracy and human rights that could help
both sides co-exist peacefully and prosperously.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Chang Jong-kong, director of the main opposition
Kuomintang's (KMT) mainland affairs department, described Chen's call
for peace talks with Chinese President Hu Jintao as empty talk if he
is not prepared to forswear Taiwan's "one country on each side of the
strait" insistence.
</P>
<P>
The pro-independence Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU) , the DPP's
ally, criticized Chen's unconditional peace offer to China as a
"self-depreciating" move.
</P>
<P>
China should also display a certain degree of goodwill to Taiwan
if the two sides are to open dialogue that must be held in a third
country and be of a "country-to-country" nature, a TSU spokesman
said, suggesting that the best venue would be Washington and that
they should be modeled on the recently concluded six-party North
Korea talks, as proposed by former President Lee Teng-hui -- now the
spiritual leader of the TSU.
</P>
<P>
The DPP and the TSU form the "pan green camp" against the
pro-unification "pan blue alliance" of the KMT and the People First
Party.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan and China have been rivals since 1949, when Taiwan split
from China following a civil war and bilateral relations have further
worsened since Chen first came to power in 2000.

CERTIFICATION TO BE EXPANDED FOR LOCAL AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTS: PREMIER
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Sept. 22 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Premier Frank Hsieh said Thursday that a
resume system, or "ID" for agricultural products will be expanded in
an effort to allay public health fears.
</P>
<P>
Hsieh made the remarks on the sidelines of the closing ceremony
of a training camp for senior executives of the country's
farmers' and fishermen's associations.
</P>
<P>
The premier claimed that a recent scare about carcinogens found
in several samples of locally produced groupers were "only isolated
cases" and said that certificated fish returned to markets that day
after sales were suspended for a few days.
</P>
<P>
Faced with steep competition in agricultural products from China
and the rest of the world, it is necessary to distinguish Taiwan's
products from foreign products, Hsieh said, adding that this is why
the certification system needs to be expanded.
</P>
<P>
He said the quality of Taiwan's agricultural products has to be
upgraded so as to survive against the competition, adding that
Taiwan's farmers "need not fear" displaying the origin of their
produce.
</P>
<P>
The certification system of agricultural products means that
written records are provided of production, processing and marketing.
</P>
<P>
The COA started to promote the system last year, and chose
organic rice and certain root and stem vegetables for the system on a
trial basis. The system will be expanded to other agricultural
products in the future.

DPP LEGISLATIVE CAUCUS VOWS TO BLOCK PASSAGE OF NCC BILL
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Sept.  22 (CNA)
(By Han Nai-kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The legislative caucus of the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) will issue an order Sept. 27 to
remind all DPP legislators to be prepared for "class A mobilization"
to block the passage of the National Communications Commission (NCC)
bill in the legislature, a DPP caucus whip said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Chen Chin-jun told reporters that the highest degree of
mobilization within the DPP caucus will be necessary because the
opposition "pan-blue alliance" of the Kuomintang (KMT) and the People
First Party (PFP) might put the NCC bill to a vote any time as the
four-month negotiation between the DPP and the opposition is coming
to an end.
</P>
<P>
The NCC bill has been one of the major contentions in the
legislature between the DPP and the opposition, which holds a slight
legislative majority.
</P>
<P>
When the previous legislature was closing its final session in
late January, the DPP legislative caucus managed to block the passage
of the bill through various obstructive methods, including
filibustering and barring KMT and PFP legislators from using the
rostrum.
</P>
<P>
While both the DPP and the opposition agree that it is necessary
to set up an institution like the NCC, they disagree on the make-up
of the body.
</P>
<P>
The pan blue alliance has proposed that the NCC should consist of
members in proportion to the number of seats each party holds in the
legislature, but the DPP insists that political parties should keep
their hands off and let experts and scholars serve on the commission,
so that press freedom will not be affected.
</P>
<P>
The pan blue alliance has noted there are precedents in other
democracies to appoint NCC members in proportion to the parliamentary
strength of the political parties. For example, the Federal
Communications Commission of the United States is normally staffed
according to the proportional representation principle.

<P>
Premier Frank Hsieh said Thursday that
public administrative agencies and preschool education institutions
should fulfill their duties of ensuring safe conditions for young
children.
</P>
<P>
Hsieh issued the directive after a 3-year-old boy in central
Taiwan suffocated Tuesday after allegedly being left unattended in a
kindergarten mini-bus for seven hours.
</P>
<P>
Noting that he sympathized with the boy's parents, Hsieh said
city and county governments should strengthen the supervision of
preschool education institutions to protect young children's safety.
</P>
<P>
The kindergarten in Taichung County's Chingshui township that the
boy attended had been operating without a license and had been fined
twice before for the same offense.
</P>
<P>
Hsieh said local governments should not extend the grace period
for unlicensed preschool education institutions to improve their
facilities and management to meet the requirements for accreditation.
</P>
<P>
The premier also directed the Children's Bureau under the
Ministry of the Interior to step up a crackdown on unlicensed daycare
centers and kindergartens around the country and to require local
governments to tighten oversight of operations and staff training of
preschool education institutions.

U.S. OFFICIAL: IMPORTANT FOR CHINA TO RESOLVE DIFFERENCES PEACEFULLY
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
New York, Sept. 22 (CNA)
(By Lillian Lin)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Robert B.
Zoellick emphasized Wednesday the importance for China to resolve its
differences with Taiwan peacefully.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a dinner sponsored by the National Committee on
U.S.-China Relations, Zoellick noted that China is playing an
ever-larger role in Asia.
</P>
<P>
"The U.S. respects China's interests in the region, and
recognizes the useful role of multilateral diplomacy in China.
But concerns will grow if China seeks to maneuver toward a
predominance of power," he said.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the differences between China and Taiwan, Zoellick
pointed out that the U.S. has made it clear that its "one China"
policy remains based on the "three communiques" and the Taiwan
Relations Act.
</P>
<P>
Zoellick said the U.S. seeks constructive relations with all
countries that do not threaten peace and security.
</P>
<P>
"Many countries hope China will pursue a peaceful rise, but none
will bet their future on it, " he said, adding that "China's rapid
military modernization and increase in capabilities raise questions
about the purposes of this buildup and China's lack of transparency."
</P>
<P>
Urging China to become a "responsible stakeholder in the
international system, " Zoellick said that with the huge trade
imbalance between China and the United States, "China cannot take its
access to the U.S. market for granted. Protectionist pressures are
growing." He also mentioned that China's recent policy adjustments of
foreign exchange rates are "an initial step" and much more remains to
be done.
</P>
<P>
Referring to China's thirst for energy, Zoellick criticized China
for applying "mercantilist strategy leads to partnerships with
regimes that hurt China's reputation and lead others to question its
intentions." Citing the relations between China and Sudan, Zoellick
said China should take more than oil from Sudan -- it should take
some responsibility for resolving Sudan's human crisis.
</P>
<P>
Stressing that "freedom lies at the heart at what America is, "
Zoellick said that "we do not urge the cause of freedom to weaken
China. Being born ethnically Chinese does not predispose people
against democracy -- just look at Taiwan's vibrant politics.
Japan and South Korea have successfully blended a Confucian
heritage with modern democratic principles," he added.

CHINA PULLING WOOL OVER TAIWAN PUBLIC'S EYES: MND
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Sept. 22 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
China has been pulling the wool over the
eyes of the Taiwan public, deceiving them into believing that it has
turned soft toward Taiwan, a Ministry of National Defense (MND)
official claimed Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Hu Chen-pu, chief of the MND's Bureau of General Political
Warfare, said the Beijing leadership has been playing a
"double-handed" scheme to fool the people of Taiwan by inviting
opposition leaders from Taiwan for prominent visits to China and
allowing freer trade policy with Taiwan in a bid to lessen Taiwan's
vigilance against China and reduce its people's sense of crisis.
</P>
<P>
Hu said that although the Chinese military has recently moved its
three-services combative landing exercises from the East China Sea
to the inland areas of Zhejiang and Guangdong provinces, the number
and scale of the war game drills have not decreased and the number of
people taking part in the drills has actually increased.
</P>
<P>
China's "double-handed" strategy has increasingly made the people
of Taiwan forget China's ever-expanding military build-up and the
fact that Beijing has never renounced the use of force against Taiwan
to solve cross-strait differences, according to Hu.
</P>
<P>
Hu claimed that the scheme has led some politicians in Taiwan to
believe that Taiwan's procurement of three major weaponry systems
from the United States is unnecessary, a situation about which the
MND is extremely worried, he added.
</P>
<P>
Hu said that since 1989, China, with its free-wheeling economy,
has continued to expand and modernize its military build-up, posing
an increasing threat to Taiwan's national security and stability in
the Taiwan Strait.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese military's establishment of a combat simulation base
near Hainan is "solid evidence" that it is aggressively making
preparations for taking Taiwan militarily, according to Hu.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese military established a simulated Taiwan military air
base on Dahuo island to the northeast of Hainan, where the Chinese
air force conducts drills against what they described as "camouflaged
F-16 jetfighters." About eight kilometers away, on Hailin island,
army and marine forces conduct landing and combat maneuvers from
across a narrow channel to Dahuo island -- drills that are imperative
and crucial for China to invade Taiwan militarily, he said.
</P>
<P>
Hu argued that if China wants to express goodwill toward Taiwan,
it should renounce the use of force against Taiwan, instead of
conducting military exercises ceaselessly.

LEGISLATURE URGED TO DELIBERATE ARMS PACKAGE S00N
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Sept. 21 (CNA)
(By Luis Huang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An official from the Ministry of National
Defense (MND) called on the opposition-controlled Legislative Yuan
Thursday to put an arms procurement draft bill on the legislative
agenda for deliberation as soon as possible, saying that the ministry
will accept the screening result.
</P>
<P>
Hu Chen-pu, director of the MND's Bureau of General Political
Warfare, told a news conference that the draft statute governing an
arms procurement package has been rejected by the Rules Committee 29
times since it was submitted to the legislature for deliberation in
June last year.
</P>
<P>
The MND has briefed legislators from the ruling and opposition
parties on the arms procurement package more than 170 times since
then, and has listed the financing for Patriot anti-missile batteries
in the regular budget as demanded by lawmakers instead of the
originally proposed special budget, with the total outlay required
for the package lowered from NT$610.8 billion to NT$340 billion, Hu
said.
</P>
<P>
In spite of such pragmatic adjustments, Hu pointed out, the
opposition "pan-blue alliance" of the Kuomintang and the People First
Party, which holds a slim majority in the 225-seat legislature, still
filibustered the budget plan, making it impossible for the arms
procurement package to enter the review process during the newly
opened legislative session.
</P>
<P>
The package comprises three big-ticket weaponry items -- eight
diesel-electric submarines, a squadron of 12 P-3C anti-submarine
aircraft and six Patriot PAC III anti-missile batteries. For more
than a year, the "pan-blue alliance" has refused to screen the
package because it claims the price is too high and that it should be
listed under the regular budget rather than a special budget.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the military has conducted a series of careful
evaluations on a procurement plan for the three items based upon the
nation's defense needs, Hu said the MND began to push for the
procurement as early as seven years ago in compliance with the
military buildup procedures.
</P>
<P>
It is regrettable that the opposition-controlled legislature has
refused to conduct rational, professional and objective discussions
of the package, which concerns national security, Hu said.
</P>
<P>
The armed forces belong to the Republic of China and all of its
people, and do not belong to any political party or individual, Hu
noted. "In the face of the growing military threaten from China, we
cannot afford any internal attrition," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Claiming that no political party should put its own interests
before national security, Hu voiced the hope that all lawmakers will
understand that the arms are vital to upgrading Taiwan's defense
capabilities and agree to put the package on the legislative agenda
as soon as possible.

NEW BOOK RELEASED ON INVESTMENT PITFALLS IN CHINA
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei, Sept. 22 (CNA)
(By Han Nai-kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A new book was released in Taipei Thursday
to warn Taiwanese businessmen of the hazards they might face if they
decide to invest in China.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference held at the Taipei NGO Assembly Hall, Kao
Wei-pang, author of the book and director of the Association of
Victimized Taiwanese Investors in China, said his book, titled
"Investment in China: The pitfalls You Must Know, " includes a
description of his own experience and what he described as true
stories told by other Taiwanese investors in China.
</P>
<P>
Kao said that since the association was founded two years ago,
there have been more than 100 cases in which Taiwanese investors have
been victims. However, he claimed, none of them have received
justice.
</P>
<P>
The 349-page book listed 12 pitfalls, including Chinese business
partners not honoring their commitments and not abiding by the law,
stealing the assets of Taiwanese businessmen, and false joint
ventures with the aim of committing fraud.
</P>
<P>
Kao said that if the government in Taipei cannot provide
protection to Taiwanese businessmen in China, it should at least tell
them the truth about the investment environment in China.
</P>
<P>
He also claimed that his association is a non-political
organization, although he admitted that most of its members are
supporters of the "pan-blue alliance" of the opposition Kuomintang
and the People First Party.
</P>
<P>
However, he went on, the authorities in China treat association
members as advocates of Taiwan independence.

8.2% KIDS BORN TO S.E. ASIAN MOTHERS SLOW IN LANGUAGE LEARNING: MOE
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Sept.  22  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An average of 8.2 percent of local
elementary schoolchildren born to Southeast Asian mothers are slow in
speech and language development, according to the results of a
Ministry of Education (MOE) survey released Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The MOE report said sluggish language development among
schoolchildren born to Southeast Asian mothers may be related to
their mothers' linguistic barriers.
</P>
<P>
According to the survey, 10.1 percent of first and second graders
with Southeast Asian mothers are slow in language development, but
the ratio drops to 6.7 percent among third and fourth graders and
further slides to 5.5 percent among fifth and sixth graders.
</P>
<P>
The figures indicate that education can help mixed-race children
in language learning and development, the MOE report said.
</P>
<P>
The survey also found that 24.13 percent of mixed-race
schoolchildren whose mothers can hardly speak Mandarin Chinese or
Taiwanese dialect are slow language learners, while only 4.8 percent
of mixed-race children with mothers able to speak fluent local
language have difficulties in language development.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the report said, 54 percent of mixed-race children
perform well in language and literary study, while the ratio of
mixed-race children who perform well in mathematics, social studies,
nature and technological studies are relatively low.
</P>
<P>
More than 60 percent of mixed-race children have adapted well to
campus life and group activities and have smooth communications with
teachers and classmates, the report said.

CHEN HOPES TAIWAN, GUATEMALA CAN JOINTLY OPEN UP MARKETS IN N. AMERICA
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Guatemala,  Sept.  22  (CNA)
(By S.J. Tsai and P.c.tang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Republic of China President Chen
Shui-bian said Thursday that he hopes Taiwan and Guatemala can
jointly open up markets for their products in North America in the
future.
</P>
<P>
The president expressed the hope after he signed with Guatemalan
President Oscar Jose-Rafael Berger a free trade agreement (FTA)
between the two countries the same day.
</P>
<P>
This is the second FTA that Taiwan has signed with one of its
diplomatic allies in Central America. The first was with Panama
in 2003.
</P>
<P>
As Taiwanese business people, who have long engaged in commercial
activities in the Asia-Pacific markets, have extensive knowledge
about running businesses in the region, Chen said that the FTA will
certainly help Guatemala to promote its business in the region.
</P>
<P>
He also said the U.S.-Guatemala FTA, which will enter into force
next January, will help Taiwanese businesses to sell their products
in markets in Latin America.
</P>
<P>
"The governments and private enterprises of the two countries
will also be able to jointly open up their markets in North America
through joint ventures and pooling of their capital, " he further
said, adding: "This represents that the friendship and constructive
partnership of the two countries will move forward toward a new era."
</P>
<P>
Besides the FTA, the two presidents also signed a volunteer
cooperation agreement and an aviation and maritime navigation
agreement between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Chen, at the head of a group of high-ranking officials and
business leaders, is currently in the Central American country for an
official visit.
</P>
<P>
He and his entourage received a warm welcome by members of the
Guatemalan Cabinet and a grand military salute ceremony held at the
national cultural palace after they arrived in the country earlier in
the day.
</P>
<P>
Presenting a white "peace rose" to a bronze statue in the palace,
which symbolizes the peace between the Guatemalan government and
rebels after they signed a "durable peace agreement" in 1996, Chen
said that he hopes that Taipei can sign a peace agreement with
Beijing one day.
</P>
<P>
"But China's missiles targeting Taiwan must first be replaced by
'peace roses,'" he added.

KMT HEAD WELCOMES PRESIDENT CHEN'S OFFER OF DIALOGUE WITH BEIJING
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,   Sept.  23  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Opposition Kuomintang Chairman Ma
Ying-jeou expressed welcome Friday to President Chen Shui-bian's
offer to engage in dialogue with the Chinese leadership without any
preconditions but pointed out that the key to reconciliation may lie
in how Chen positions cross-strait relations.
</P>
<P>
"Chen's attitude toward how cross-strait relations should be
positioned may be a 'precondition' to be tackled before Taiwan can
engage in any kind of negotiations with China," Ma said.
</P>
<P>
He added that the persistent lack of trust between the
leaderships across the strait is also a thorny issue in the
development of cross-strait relations.
</P>
<P>
Ma made the comments in response to President Chen's remarks in
Miami a day earlier that he is willing to hold "rational dialogue"
with his People's Republic of China counterpart Hu Jintao without any
preconditions.
</P>
<P>
Such dialogue, which could be held any time and anywhere, would
be aimed at creating a "window of opportunity" for "democratic Taiwan
and democratic China to co-exist," the president said.
</P>
<P>
Chen and his entourage were on a one-day transit stopover in
Miami en route to Central America and the Caribbean for an official
visit.
</P>
<P>
Chen said he fully understands the world community is expecting
Taiwan and China to reopen dialogue in order to maintain peace in the
Taiwan Strait. "But I have to seriously remind the world that the
crux of the issue is that China has been avoiding dialogue with
Taiwan's popularly elected government and, worse, is targeting
missiles at Taiwan and using its so-called 'Anti-Secession Law' in an
attempt to tackle the issue through non-peaceful means, " Chen
stressed.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated his thanks to the Bush government for repeatedly
urging Beijing to talk with Taiwan's popularly elected government and
president.

LEGISLATIVE SPEAKER TO CONVENE MEETING ON NCC, BUDGET BILLS
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Sept.  23 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng
will convene an inter-party coordination meeting Monday to discuss
the budget proposal for the government for the next fiscal year as
well as the National Communications Commission (NCC) draft bill.
</P>
<P>
Legislator Jao Yung-ching, a caucus whip of the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), made the remarks after the DPP
legislative caucus called on Wang Friday to ask him to convene the
consultation meeting.
</P>
<P>
Jao said the opposition Kuomintang (KMT) legislative caucus is
tilting toward lumping the government budget proposal together with
the NCC bill, adding that the KMT will see if the NCC bill can be
passed before they decide on the budget proposal.
</P>
<P>
While both the DPP and the opposition agree that it is necessary
to set up an institution like the NCC, they disagree on the make-up
of the body.
</P>
<P>
The "pan-blue alliance" of the KMT and the People First Party,
which holds a slim majority in the 225-seat legislature, has proposed
that the NCC be comprised of members in proportion to the number of
seats each party holds in the legislature, while the DPP insists that
political parties should keep their hands off and let experts and
scholars serve on the commission, so that press freedom will not be
affected.
</P>
<P>
Although the DPP claims that such a proportional system is
unprecedented, the "pan-blue alliance" has pointed out that there are
precedents in other democracies to appoint NCC members in proportion
to the parliamentary strength of the political parties. For example,
the Federal Communications Commission of the United States is
normally staffed according to the proportional representation
principle.
</P>
<P>
As the opposition "pan-blue alliance" might put the NCC bill to a
vote as the four-month consultation period between the DPP and the
opposition is coming to an end Sunday, the DPP has mobilized to try
to block passage of the NCC bill in the legislature.

TAIWAN MUST HEED U.S. PENTAGON OFFICIAL'S WARNING: DEFENSE MINISTER
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Sept. 23 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Minister of National Defense Lee Jye said
Friday that Taiwan should take heed of a U.S. Pentagon official's
stern criticism of the limited growth in the island's national
defense budget.
</P>
<P>
Lee was referring to remarks made by Edward Ross, principal
director of the Security Cooperation Operations under the Defense
Security Cooperation Agency of the U.S. Department of Defense, at the
U.S.-Taiwan Defense Industry Conference 2005 held in San Diego,
California Sept. 19-20.
</P>
<P>
Ross also said that if Taiwan is not willing to defend itself,
the United States cannot assist in defending Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Noting that Taiwan should pay attention to such a stern warning,
Lee said that "if friends point out our faults, we must engage in
self-reflection, and if they are wrong, then we'll react, " adding
that the United States has always been forthcoming.
</P>
<P>
On whether he will express Taiwan's views to the United States,
Lee said the Ministry of National Defense is preparing for a
response.

</P>
<P>
Ross took part in the meeting on behalf of Richard Lawless,
U.S. Deputy Undersecretary of Defense, who was unable to attend the
conference because he was preoccupied with the six-party talks on
North Korea.
</P>
<P>
Ross lauded Lee and his staff for meeting with legislators and
communicating with them more than 170 times to attempt to facilitate
passage of the long-stalled arms procurement bill. The procurement
package includes three big-ticket items -- eight diesel-electric
submarines, a squadron of 12 P-3C anti-submarine aircraft and six
Patriot PAC III anti-missile batteries.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng said Friday
that he will not speculate on when the arms procurement package will
be put on the legislative agenda for review.
</P>
<P>
The opposition lawmakers, who have a slight majority in the
Legislative Yuan, have blocked the bill's passage for over a year
because they say that the price is too high and that the procurement
should be funded through the regular defense budget rather than a
special budget.
</P>
<P>
Wang said he believes that every party will take into
consideration the nation's overall security as well as the
cross-strait military balance in dealing with the
procurement issue.

CHEN UNVEILS NEW PROJECT FOR CO-PROSPERITY WITH ALLIES

<TEXT>
<P>
Visiting Republic of China
President Chen Shui-bian said in Guatemala Thursday that Taiwan will
come up with a new investment project for co-prosperity with its
diplomatic allies in Central America.
</P>
<P>
Chen, who arrived in Guatemala City earlier in the day from
Miami, Florida for a state visit, revealed the plan in an interview
with the Guatemalan newspaper "Diario Siglo 21."
</P>
<P>
The new project, which will call for an outlay of US$250 million
per year, will be formally announced when a summit meeting between
Chen and his counterparts from the ROC's allies in Central America
and the Caribbean opens in Nicaragua Sept. 26, Chen said.
</P>
<P>
According to Economic Affairs Minister Ho Mei-yueh, who is
accompanying Chen on his current 12-day diplomatic tour, the new
project will mark a shift in Taiwan's diplomatic strategy from
financial aid and technological assistance to economic and trade
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Ho said the money needed for the new cooperative project will
come from three government-run funds, including the International
Cooperation and Development Fund and the Executive Yuan Development
Fund.
</P>
<P>
Under the "co-prosperity" project, Ho said, the ROC government
will take the initiative to invest in niche industries in various
Central American countries in addition to encouraging private Taiwan
corporations to make similar investments in the region for exports to
North America. The niche industries in Central America include
foodstuffs and textiles.
</P>
<P>
The "co-prosperity" project will pool resources and manpower of
various government departments, including the Ministry of Economic
Affairs, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Council for Economic
Planning and Development, the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission and
the National Security Council, Ho said, adding that Vice Premier Wu
Rong-i will serve as convener of the project.
</P>
<P>
Wu, who is also a member of Chen's entourage, said the
"co-prosperity" project is expected to create a "win-win" scenario
for Taiwan and its Central American allies.
</P>
<P>
"The project will help Taiwan companies establish footholds in
Central America to serve as a springboard for tapping into the vast
North American market while assisting our Central American allies in
developing their economies and creating jobs," Wu explained.
</P>
<P>
Wu said the government will offer many incentives, including
financial subsidies and loans, to encourage Taiwan enterprises to
invest in niche industries in Central American countries.
</P>
<P>
During his interview with the Guatemalan paper, President Chen
also said Taiwan will assist Guatemala in expanding its CA-9 highway,
with Taiwan offering a loan of US$17 million to finance the expansion
of one-third of the 33-km highway from two lanes to four lanes.
</P>
<P>
Guatemala is the first leg of Chen's ongoing diplomatic tour that
will also take him to the Dominican Republic, Nicaragua, St. Vincent
and the Grenadines, and the Federation of St. Kitts and Nevis.

TAIWAN TRADE SURPLUS DECLINES
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Sept. 23 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taiwan posted a trade surplus of US$1.17
billion in the first eight months of this year, marking a noticeable
year-on-year decline of 79 percent, Ministry of Economic Affairs
(MOEA) officials said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan's two-way trade hit US$240.73 billion in the Jan.-Aug.
period, with exports and imports totaling US$120.95 billion and
US$119.78 billion, respectively, marking a year-on-year expansion of
6.7 percent and 11.2 percent, respectively, the MOEA officials said.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the country registered a trade surplus of US$1.17
billion, which was NT$4.45 billion less than the year-earlier level,
the officials noted.
</P>
<P>
They attributed the sharp decline in Taiwan's trade surplus
mainly to less vibrant global economic growth, the appreciation of
Taiwan's currency and spiralling international oil prices.
</P>
<P>
China (including Hong Kong) and the United States remained
Taiwan's largest sources of trade surplus in the Jan.-Aug. period,
with the surplus figures totaling US$30.92 billion and US$4.24
billion, respectively.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Japan and South Korea were the largest sources of
Taiwan's imports, with the country suffering a trade deficit of
US$21.65 billion with Japan and a deficit of US$4.88 billion with
South Korea in the first eight months.
</P>
<P>
By area, Taiwan's exports to the six members of the Association
of South East Asian Nations grew noticeably, at 12.5 percent
year-on-year, while demand from mainland China and Hong Kong also
remained strong, with exports increasing a whopping 20.4 percent,
according to the officials.
</P>
<P>
By product, Taiwan's imports of crude oil in the same period
skyrocketed 48.2 percent in terms of price, followed by imports of
machinery, which grew by 16.2 percent. Electronics products topped
the Jan.-Aug. import list in terms of quantity, at 17.2 percent of
the total, followed by machinery products at 10.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
Iron, steel and related products topped the Jan.-Aug. export
list, posting a year-on-year growth of 20.4 percent, followed by
electronics goods, up 7 percent, while exports of optoelectronic
instruments and telecommunications and information technology
products declined by 2.4 percent and 20.9 percent, respectively,
mainly as a result of Taiwan exporters moving their manufacturing and
export operations overseas, the officials said.

TAIWAN URGED TO HAVE MORE CONTACT WITH U.S. OFFICIALS
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Guatemala,  Sept. 22 (CNA)
(By S.J. Tsai and P.C.Tang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A former senior U.S. State Department
official has suggested that high-ranking officials of the Taiwan
government reinforce their communication and coordination with
members of the new U.S. governmental team in charge of cross-Taiwan
Strait affairs.
</P>
<P>
Richard Armitage, former U.S. deputy secretary of state, made the
suggestion while meeting with President Chen Shui-bian during the
Taiwan head of state's transit stop in Miami Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The president, heading a ROC delegation made up of high-ranking
officials and business leaders, is currently in Guatemala for an
official visit.
</P>
<P>
A staff member of the president revealed Thursday that during the
meeting, the U.S. official admitted that relations between Taipei and
Washington were not very smooth for a certain period of time in the
past, saying, however, that "this problem was not purely caused by
Taiwan."
</P>
<P>
"The United States should also shoulder some of the
responsibility as it had only dealt with matters with the Kuomintang
before and was not aware of the Democratic Progressive Party's style
and way of doing things," he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the U.S. government did not distinguish the
differences between the DPP government officials and the former KMT
government officials at the very beginning of Chen's presidency,
Armitage said to Chen that the relationship between the two countries
went through a short spell of adapting to each other's way of doing
things.
</P>
<P>
As there are now new officials in the Bush administration charged
with the task of handling cross-strait affairs, Armitage suggested
that high-ranking ROC officials, including national security staff
members, establish frequent communications and a coordination
mechanism with their U.S. counterparts, rather than relying only on
the American Institute in Taiwan, a quasi-official organization in
charge of U.S. relations with Taiwan, as the only channel to pass on
messages between the two governments.
</P>
<P>
He further said that at his strong suggestion, the Bush
administration agreed in 2001 to sell a package of arms to Taiwan,
adding that "this is because the U.S. government worried that a new
ruling DPP government might affect cross-strait stability at that
time."
</P>
<P>
"Approving the arms sales was also done in the hopes of
maintaining a stable and peaceful cross-strait relationship, " he
continued.
</P>
<P>
On the long-stalled arms procurement bill in Taiwan's Legislative
Yuan, Armitage said that listing funding for the arms procurement
items in the regular military budget instead of a special budget is
"a good way of handling matters."
</P>
<P>
At the same time, he suggested that high-ranking ROC officials
help Washington better understand the efforts that the DPP government
has made in dealing with the bill.
</P>
<P>
In response, the president told Armitage that he himself has
called for the opposition parties at least a hundred times to support
passage of the long-stalled bill in the legislature, according to the
president's staff member.

TODAY'S CHINA EXPERIENCING HALCYON DAYS: TAIWAN WRITER
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Beijing,  Sept. 23 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taiwan writer, TV commentator, political
gadfly and independent Legislator Li Ao claimed Friday that today's
China is in its halcyon days that have not been seen since the Han
(206 B.C.-A.D. 220) and Tang dynasties (A.D. 618-907).
</P>
<P>
Li, in his second speech in China to Tsinghua University faculty
and students, lauded the Communist Party of China (CPC) several
times, saying that while China was bullied by Western powers in its
modern history, "no-one dares to bully China any more" and "only one
party could have achieved that, which is the CPC."
</P>
<P>
He also claimed that after the Kuomintang fled to Taiwan after
being defeated by the CPC in 1949, it took "all the money" to Taiwan
and left 3 million "bad elements" behind.
</P>
<P>
He said that after 1949, China was stripped and in poverty, and
yet it has managed to stand up for itself.
</P>
<P>
He referred to the Constitution of the People's Republic of China
during his speech, claiming that it lists all kinds of freedom to
which the people are entitled. "If we are serious about them, then
the stipulations in the Constitution are bona fide, " he said without
elaborating.
</P>
<P>
Li's first speech at Peking University, in which he advised the
CPC to relax restrictions as he glorified freedom of speech, won
enthusiastic response from the students but caused embarrassment to
some school faculty and party officials.

</P>
<P>
Reports said that the Beijing authorities were concerned about
his speech and wanted to block it. The reports were unsubstantiated,
but official Web sites such as Xinhua and other major media did not
print the parts of Li's speeches that were deemed sensitive Friday.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong-based Phoenix TV, which arranged for Li's 12-day visit
to China, aired Li's speech live Tuesday, but taped the second one
for later airing.
</P>
<P>
Li will make a third and last speech at Fudan University in
Shanghai before returning to Taiwan at the end of this month.

INDEPENDENCE ACTIVISTS WANT SAN FRANCISCO TREATY WRITTEN IN TEXTBOOKS

<TEXT>
<P>
Members of the pro-independence 908 Taiwan
Nation Movement claimed Friday that the San Francisco Peace Treaty
(SFPT) is technically a "birth certificate" for Taiwan that its
contents should be written into textbook for Taiwan students.
</P>
<P>
Japan signed the treaty with 48 United Nations member countries
represented in a meeting in San Francisco Sept. 8, 1951. In the
treaty, Japan declared that it would give up its sovereignty claims
over Taiwan, Penghu and all its other offshore islands.
</P>
<P>
Wang Hsien-chi, a convener of the 908 Taiwan Nation Movement
group, and other group members visited the Ministry of Education
Friday, where they met with Vice Education Minister Chou Tsan-teh.
</P>
<P>
Wang said during the visit that the notion of Taiwan's
sovereignty has never had anything to do with China or the People's
Republic of China.
</P>
<P>
He blamed the opposition Kuomintang for promoting a "great China
myth" in Taiwan's education domain when the party was in power over
the last several decades until 2000.
</P>
<P>
This "great China myth" education has misled the people of Taiwan
regarding Taiwan's sovereignty and its people's national identity,
Wang claimed, adding that even today, Taiwan elementary school
students have workbooks carrying the motto "Being a dignified and
imposing Chinese" on the back cover.
</P>
<P>
Wang argued that it is now the responsibility of the Education
Ministry to "return or resurface the truth of history."
</P>
<P>
It is hoped that the SFPT and related history be carried in
textbooks for junior high, senior high and vocational schools in
Taiwan, Wang added.
</P>
<P>
For his part, Chou said that he will relay Wang and his group's
opinion to Education Minister Tu Cheng-sheng and relevant departments
of the Education Ministry, and said that the matter will be carried
in textbooks after historians have researched the issue and find it
in accordance with historical truth and data.

TAIWAN HOPES TO ENHANCE EXCHANGES WITH JAPAN: MOFA
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Tokyo,  Sept.  23 (CNA)
(By Mike Chang and Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taiwan hopes to enhance exchanges with
Japan and increase cooperation between Taiwan, Japan and the United
States, a Republic of China Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA)
official said Friday.
</P>
<P>
MOFA spokesman Michel Lu made the remarks in an interview
published Friday in the Japanese daily Sankei Shimbun.
</P>
<P>
Lu expressed appreciation for the Japanese government's support
of Taiwan's bid to join the World Health Organization as an observer
and its issuance of visas to former President Lee Teng-hui for
private visits.
</P>
<P>
He also thanked Japan for listing the peaceful resolution of the
Taiwan Strait issue as a joint strategic objective in its security
consultation meeting with the United States in February this year,
its opposition to China's March 14 enactment of the Anti-Secession
Law targeting Taiwan, as well as its recent announcement of a
permanent waiving of visa requirements for Taiwan tourists visiting
Japan.
</P>
<P>
Lu said that the listing of the common strategic objective was
significant for two reasons: The Bush and Koizumi administrations
attach great importance to the security and safety in the Taiwan
Strait; and faced with more than 700 missiles aimed by China at
Taiwan, Taiwan needs to consider enhancing cooperation with the
U.S. and Japan.
</P>
<P>
Noting that Japanese Prime Minister Junichi Koizumi won
overwhelmingly in recent lower house elections, Lu said this shows
that Japanese voters are optimistic about Koizumi's advocacy of
reform and his performance, and that Koizumi is expected to solidify
his support base.
</P>
<P>
Lu said that although Taiwan and Japan have no diplomatic
relations, private exchanges are close, and he expressed the hope
that through the exchanges between non-governmental organizations,
bilateral substantive relations will be improved.

TAIWAN WORKER SALARIES DOWN IN REAL TERMS: DGBAS
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Feb.  23 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)

<TEXT>
<P>
Taiwan workers' salaries posted negative
growth of 0.9 percent in real terms for the first seven months of
this year, the largest decline of its kind in the country's history,
according to government statistics.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan employees' monthly salaries averaged NT$35,517 (US$1,077)
during the January-July period, for a year-on-year increase of 0.96
percent, but the consumer price index rose by 1.92 percent during the
same period, resulting in negative growth of 0.9 percent in worker
salaries in real terms -- the second such decline on record, tallies
compiled by the Cabinet-level Directorate General of Budget,
Accounting and Statistics (DGBAS) show.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan workers in the industrial and service sectors worked an
average of 181.7 hours in July, down by 5.6 hours from June and down
by 8.4 hours from the year-earlier level.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, survey results made public the same day by the Taiwan
Institute of Economic Research show that nearly 58 percent of Taiwan
companies said they think the domestic business climate will remain
"business as usual" in the months ahead, up from 34.5 percent
registered in a similar poll a month earlier.
</P>
<P>
In the same survey, 31 percent of companies said that they think
business conditions will improve, down from 46 percent in the

conditions will get worse, down from 19 percent in the month-earlier

TAIWAN STOCK EXCHANGE LACKLUSTER AMID WEAK CONFIDENCE
</HEADLINE>

Taipei, Feb. 23 (CNA)

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Weak investment confidence took its toll on
the Taiwan Stock Exchange, which failed to recover the 6,000-point
mark Friday after a plunge of 95 points at the end of the previous
trading day.
</P>
<P>
Although the U.S. stock indexes stabilized Thursday, the weighted
index, the key barometer of the Taiwan Stock Exchange, still fell by
46.54 points to close at 5,925.54 Friday, mainly affected by large
selling by foreign institutional investors and the depreciation of
the new Taiwan dollar, as well as concern over oil prices. The index
at one point fell below the 5,900-point level during the day's
trading.
</P>
<P>
The weighted index dipped by 95.28 points to end at 5972.06
points Thursday, indicating shaking confidence in the domestic
bourse. Foreign investors oversold NT$12.42 billion (US$376 million)
worth of Taiwan shares that day -- the eighth single-day high on
record.
</P>
<P>
Thomas M.F. Yeh, vice chairman of the Cabinet-level Council for
Economic Planning and Development (CEPD), argued that the confidence
crisis will be just a short-term phenomenon as a result of
skyrocketing oil prices and the widening gap in interest rates
between Taiwan and the United States.
</P>
<P>
Claiming that a country's economic performance is always the
prime reason luring foreign capital to flow in rather than other
factors such as interest rate gap, Yeh said that Taiwan's economy is
expected to expand by 3.65 percent this year and by at least 4
percent next year. The domestic economy increased by 5.7 percent last
year.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, market analysts urged investors to be cautious as
bearish sentiment seems to continue to prevail in the domestic bourse
in the weeks to come until the middle of the next month, the
beginning of the traditional peak fourth quarter for both hi-tech and
traditional business shares.

MOFA ELABORATES ON PRESIDENT'S INVESTMENT PROJECT IN CENTRAL AMERICA
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei, Sept. 23 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President Chen Shui-bian's revelation of a
new project for co-prosperity with Taiwan's diplomatic allies in
Central America is aimed at assisting Taiwan businessmen to invest in
the region and cementing diplomatic relations, a Ministry of Foreign
Affairs (MOFA) official said Friday.
</P>
<P>
MOFA spokesman Michel Lu made the remarks after the president
announced the project Thursday in Guatemala on the first leg of a
12-day, five-nation diplomatic tour of Central America and
the Caribbean.
</P>
<P>
The project, which will call for an outlay of US$250 million per
year to help the infrastructure of the diplomatic allies, will be
formally announced when a summit meeting between the president and
his counterparts from the Republic of China's allies in Central
America and the Caribbean opens in Nicaragua Sept. 26.
</P>
<P>
Lu said the project was hammered out among government agencies,
including the Ministry of Economic Affairs, the Ministry of Foreign
Affairs, the Council for Economic Planning and Development, the
Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission and the National Security Council
and that Vice Premier Wu Rong-i will serve as convener of the
project.
</P>
<P>
Lu said the money will come from the International Cooperation
and Development Fund under the MOFA (more than NT$5 billion) and the
Executive Yuan Development Fund (around NT$2.5 billion).
</P>
<P>
Lu said that the new project will be different from the past
practice of sending technical missions or subsidizing private
manufacturers investing in the region.
</P>
<P>
The government has adopted the different approach mainly because
it wants to seize the opportunity of the great business opportunities
presented with the passage of the Central American Free Trade
Agreement by the U.S. Congress and the expected formation of the Free
Trade Area of the Americas (FTAA), he said.
</P>
<P>
This is why the government wants to join hands with the private
sector to increase investment in Central America, which will not only

<P>
The Cabinet-level Mongolian and Tibetan
Affairs Commission (MTAC) has decided to host Sept. 24-25 its 2005
Conference on Geopolitical Relations between Contemporary Mongolia
and Neighboring Asian Countries, dubbed simply "Mongolia and Russia."
</P>
<P>
A total of 17 domestic and foreign scholars and experts have been
invited to attend the two-day conference to discuss interaction and
exchanges between Mongolia and three Mongolia-descended republics of
the Russian Federation, including the Republic of Tuva, from the
perspectives of politics, economics, regional security and culture,
according to a MATC news release.
</P>
<P>
The participants will include Alexander Brokert, chairman of the
Tuva-Mongolia friendship association; Zhelezniakov Aleksander, head
of the Far East and Central East Center of the Russian Academy of
Sciences; and Adiya Tuvshintugs, vice president of Mongolia's
Institute of Strategic Studies, while Chang Chun-hsiung, chairman of
the Taiwan-Russia Association, will address the opening.
</P>
<P>
It will be the first meeting to gather academic personnel from
the two countries in Taiwan to talk about their nations. The

Export orders received by Taiwan
manufacturers reached US$22.15 billion in August, the highest
single-month figure in history, the Ministry of Economics Affairs
reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The figure represented an annual growth of 22.6 percent and was
due to the increasing demand in Asian markets for information and
electronics products, according to the report.

OVER-RELIANCE ON FOREIGN TRADE NOT GOOD: ECONOMIST
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Feb.  23 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taiwan must not overly depend on foreign
trade as a means of expanding its economy and the government should
galvanize local demand to that end, an economist urged Friday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a news conference to announce the publication of a
monthly investigation of business conditions at home, Taiwan
Institute of Economic Research (TIER) President Hung Teh-sheng said
that now is the right time for the government to gauge how to boost
local demand to help the domestic economy at a time when Taiwan's
foreign trade surplus has been contracting for some time.
</P>
<P>
It is not healthy for the Taiwan economy to rely excessively on
exports to sustain expansion as it has over the past decades, Hung
said, adding that the government needs to encourage greater
investment and consumption in the domestic market by the private
sector to help minimize the impact of slowing foreign trade.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan recorded a combined trade surplus of US$1.17 billion for
the first eight months of this year, down by 79 percent from the
previous year's level. According to Hung, this was due to lagging
outbound shipments and rising prices of imported products.
</P>
<P>
The TIER president attributed the domestic export sector's
lackluster performance to relentless relocations overseas by
information industry companies and to a side effect of decreasing
Taiwan investment in China that has led to less demand for Taiwan
exports.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, 31 percent of Taiwan companies
questioned said that they think business conditions at home will
improve in the months ahead, down from 46 percent in the previous
month's survey, while 11 percent said that they think the business
climate will get worse, down from 19 percent from a month ago,
according to the same investigation.

TAIWAN, GUATEMALA SIGN FREE TRADE AGREEMENT
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Guatemala  City,  Sept.  22  (CNA)
(By S.J. Tsai and Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Visiting Republic of China
President Chen Shui-bian signed a free trade agreement with his
Guatemala counterpart Oscar Berger Perdomo Thursday to boost
bilateral trade and economic cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was sealed shortly after Chen arrived in Guatemala
City from Miami, Florida on the first leg of his current five-nation
diplomatic tour of Central America and the Caribbean.
</P>
<P>
Chen was accorded a red-carpet welcome complete with full
military honors upon his arrival in Guatemala for a state visit.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the Guatemalan newspaper Diario Siglo 21
later in the day, Chen said he is hopeful that the Taiwan-Guatemala
free trade agreement can take effect Jan. 1, 2006.
</P>
<P>
Chen said the free trade pact will help narrow the trade
imbalance between Taiwan and Guatemala, which is now in Taiwan's
favor. Moreover, Guatemala can use Taiwan as a gateway to explore the
Asian market while Taiwan can expand its North American market by
using Guatemala as a springboard.
</P>
<P>
In 2004, Chen said, Taiwan exported US$110 million in goods to
Guatemala while importing US$4.1 million Guatemalan products. In the
first seven months of this year, Taiwan exports to Guatemala dropped
40 percent from the year-earlier level, while Guatemalan exports to
Taiwan more than tripled during the same period. Chen said the trade
imbalance will further narrow after the implementation of the free
trade pact.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Chen said Taiwan will assist Guatemala in expanding
its CA-9 highway which links Guatemala City to El Rancho on the
Atlantic coast. Taiwan will assist in expanding one-third of the
33-km highway from two to four lanes, which will call for an outlay
of US$17 million. 
</P>
<P>
Chen Cheng-chung, secretary-general of the International
Cooperation and Development Fund who is accompanying President Chen
on his current diplomatic tour, said the ROC will offer a loan for
the project. Noting that Guatemala has a good credit rating, Chen
Cheng-chung said the Guatemalan government will repay the loan in
line with a schedule to be set in a contract to be signed later.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, President Chen also signed an aviation and maritime
transport service agreement and a volunteer exchange accord with
Berger.
</P>
<P>
Guatemala is the first leg of Chen's ongoing 12-day diplomatic
tour that will also take him to the Dominican Republic, Nicaragua,
St. Vincent and the Grenadines, and the Federation of St. Kitts and
Nevis.
</P>
<P>
During his stay in Nicaragua, Chen will attend a summit meeting
with his counterparts from five of Taiwan's diplomatic allies in
Central America, namely Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras, Nicaragua
and Costa Rica, in addition to the top leaders from Belize, Panama
and the Dominican Republic, as well as the secretary-general of the
System of Central American Integration.

WORK IS MOSTLY A CHORE FOR NEW EMPLOYEES IN TAIWAN: POLL
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Sept.  23 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Most new employees feel uneasy in the
workplace in Taiwan, and a majority of them hope to retire early at
age 50, according to the results of an opinion poll published Friday.
</P>
<P>
About 28 percent of new employees polled said that they feel
uneasy because of poor relations with their bosses, while 21 percent
said that they are worried about being laid off and 19 percent
pointed to heavy work pressure, according to the survey carried out
by the headhunting human resources Web site -- www.1111.com.tw.
</P>
<P>
Some 38 percent said they were anxious over what they see as an
uncertain future, ahead of 17 percent who hope to start their own
business and around 16 percent who admitted to feeling reluctant to
go to the office every day.
</P>
<P>
Sixty-four percent of junior office workers view their current
occupation as just a way to make a living, while 16 percent said that
working is the leading source of their vigor and more than 14 percent
said that they force themselves to work to earn a living.
</P>
<P>
Some 33 percent of Taiwan's new office workers hope to be able to
retire at the age of 50, ahead of 24 percent who hope to do so by the
age of 35, and 21 percent who said 40.
</P>
<P>
The domestic Web site carried out the poll from Sept. 7 to Sept.
21, collecting 1,257 valid samples.
</P>
<P>
According to an investigation by a South Korean university, South
Korean workers and employees are also under constant unease at their
workplaces, with women, in particular those aged between 20 and 29
that have worked at least five years, suffering the most, an
executive with the local Web site said.
</P>
<P>
Many office workers in both Taiwan and South Korea have "Monday
blues, " with their work frequently being interrupted by fatigue,
lack of concentration and anxiety.
</P>
<P>
According to a South Korean newspaper report, more and more
office workers are willing to retire at a younger age now, normally
at 40-something. Over 75 percent of the 3.23 million volunteer
retirees in South Korea quit their jobs to run their own business,
get married and raise children, the report said.

<TEXT>
<P>
The Council of Agriculture will hold an
exercise in mid-October in the central County of Changhua against a
possible outbreak of avian flu, with the participation of three other
government agencies.
</P>
<P>
A council spokesman said Friday that the exercise involving the
Coast Guard Administration, the Ministry of National Defense and the
Environmental Protection Administration is intended to get all
related government agencies familiarized with the measures designed
to prevent the avian flu virus from spreading in Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
The council's strategy against avian flu includes such measures
as stopping the disease at Taiwan's borders, strengthening
quarantines, taking precautionary steps in Taiwan's communities and
heightening the preparedness of all hospitals.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman also said that the council will seek the help of
Taiwan's bird-watching societies to monitor the activities of
migratory birds from Siberia. These birds may carry the avian flu
virus, although they themselves may not be ill. The bird-watchers
will be asked to notify authorities in charge of animal disease
prevention whenever they spot a dead migratory bird.
</P>
<P>
In addition, he added, the council will help poultry and hog
raisers in Taiwan set up bird nets around their farms to prevent
migratory birds from coming into contact with chickens, ducks, geese
and pigs in the farms.

Taiwan was ranked first in Asia, and fifth

PRESIDENT TO EXPLAIN MESSAGE HE ASKED SOONG TO RELAY TO HU
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Guatemala City, Sept. 22 (CNA)
(By S. J. Tsai and Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President Chen Shui-bian will soon
explain the details of the message that he asked opposition People
First Party Chairman James Soong to convey to Chinese President Hu
Jintao earlier this year, one of his aides said in Guatemala
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Chen, who is currently on a state visit in Guatemala, is
scheduled to hold an informal meeting with a group of Taiwan
reporters covering his ongoing five-nation diplomatic tour after he
arrives in the Dominican Republic Sept. 24 on the second leg of his
12-day shuttle diplomacy, his aide said.
</P>
<P>
The president will then explain in detail what message he had
asked Soong to relay to Hu during Soong's high-profile visit to China
in May this year.
</P>
<P>
Soong met with Hu, who concurrently serves as general secretary
of the Communist Party of China, in Beijing May 12. A senior U.S.
State Department adviser, James R. Keith, claimed last week that
Soong passed the message to Hu during their meeting that Chen was
willing to engage in dialogue with Beijing using a flexible
formulation about what constitutes "one China."
</P>
<P>
Beijing has long demanded that the ROC government on Taiwan
embrace its cherished "one China" principle as a precondition for
resuming dialogue across the Taiwan Strait.
</P>
<P>
Chen's aide said the president has never wavered on his stance
toward China, nor did he ask Soong to offer some kind of trade-off on
opening dialogue by accepting a flexible interpretation of the "one
China" principle.
</P>
<P>
As to what exactly Chen did ask Soong to pass on to Hu, his aide
said, the president will brief Taiwan reporters on the content in
person Saturday.
</P>
<P>
During a transit stop in Miami, Florida, Wednesday, Chen said
during a dinner with Taiwan expatriates there that he is willing to
hold "rational dialogue" with his People's Republic of China
counterpart without any preconditions. Such dialogue, which could be
held any time and any place, would be aimed at creating a "window of
opportunity" for "democratic Taiwan and democratic China to
co-exist," he added.
</P>
<P>
Chen's aide said the president's call is a response to U.S.
President George W. Bush's repeated appeal for Hu to hold a dialogue
with Taiwan's popularly elected president and government.
</P>
<P>
"It is China that has attached the rigorous 'one China' principle
as a precondition for resumption of cross-strait dialogue, " the aide
said, adding that President Chen's stance has consistently been that
cross-strait dialogue should follow the principles of "peace, parity
and dignity."

The U.S. government supports Republic

dialogue with China without preconditions, a senior Department of

In an interview with the Central News Agency, the official, who

As to the strong words made recently by Edward Ross, a principal

results here, that it's the responsibility for both the ruling party
and opposition parties, not one or the other," he said.
</P>
<P>
As to whether the appearance of increased restrictions on
President Chen's U. S. transit this time was any indication of a
change of US-Taiwan relations, the officials said that overall
bilateral relations should not be judged on the basis of any one
event.
</P>
<P>
Actually, he said, communication is quite good both in Washington
and in Taipei: "We have very open channels, as possibly can be, very
candid."
</P>
<P>
Following is the full text of the interview:
</P>
<P>
Q: On Mr. Keith's public statement to the U.S.-China Economic and
Security Review Commission, he mentioned that People First Party
(PFP) Chairman James Soong passed to PRC President Hu Jintao the
message that President Chen Shui-bian was willing to engage in
dialogue with Beijing using a flexible formulation about what
constituted "one China." The PFP, after initial denial, is now saying
that you are stating the fact but not clear enough. The Presidential
Office said Chen did asked Soong to pass a message, but not the one
you mentioned. Could you give us some information on where Mr.
Keith's information came from?
A: The administration has nothing to add to the testimony that was
</P>
<P>
made. I think the Taiwan government will speak for itself for
</P>
<P>
this issue. What's more important is what President Chen has said
</P>
<P>
publicly about the desirability of cross-strait dialogue without
</P>
<P>
pre- conditions, which is something that the U.S. government,
</P>
<P>
this administration, supports.
Q: To follow up on that, yesterday in Miami, President Chen said he
</P>
<P>
was willing to talk to Chinese President Hu Jintao anytime,
</P>
<P>
anywhere without pre-conditions. Could you talk a little more on
</P>
<P>
the U.S. position on this?
A: The administration's position is completely consistent with the
very long-standing policy. The American government position on
cross-strait dialogue would like to see the Chinese people on both
sides of the Taiwan Strait resolve these issues and resolve them
peacefully. We talk to the Chinese people on both side of the
Strait to do this in order to make that happen. Of course that
needs dialogue. There has been ways that the two sides have worked
out the modality of dialogue in the past. You go back to the
1990's. Clearly, there was such a dialogue going on. We'd very
much like to see that happen again. As has been stated in every
one of our senior meetings that involved any sort of discussion on
Taiwan issues with the mainland, with the PRC, our position is
always that the mainland ought to engage in dialogue with the
elected representatives of the Taiwan people, regardless of which
party is in power, regardless of the specific modalities that the
Chinese people on both sides have to work out. Our view is, in
order for these issues to be resolved peacefully, the binding
concerns that we have is that there has to be dialogue. We
certainly support President Chen's call for dialogue. It's clear
that the mainland side would also like to be seen as promoting
dialogue without pre-conditions. Both sides take the view that
there are no conditions attached to their proposal for dialogue.
When two sides get down to actually talking about it, one side or
the other is able to identify what it perceives as pre-conditions
on the other side. Our view is there are not to be any obstacles
to the two sides sitting down and talking about the fundamental
issues that are at issue in cross-strait relations.
Q. So you do support dialogue without pre-conditions?
A: We very much support the idea that the two sides are to sit down
and have talks. There ought not to be any obstacles to the two
sides sitting down and having talks. It's up to the Chinese on
both sides of the Strait to work out precisely what that means as
an operational term. In any given year you can identify different
kinds of obstacles in the dialogue that might occur. Our hope is
that on both sides there will be a meeting of the minds that such
dialogue could take place.
Q. You mentioned China wants to be seen as not attaching any
conditions to dialogue?
</P>
<P>
A: This is often the case. This is telling in the press. If you
read newspapers and follow the television reports on each side's
position, often you'll see that the mainland and Taipei both want
dialogue, and they don't intend that there be pre-conditions. And
they have many different ways of describing their positions as if
they have no pre-conditions. But the Taiwan side sees certain
pre-conditions related, for example, most recently related to the
so-called consensus of 1992. Similarly, there have been times in the
past when the Taiwan side has proposed talks on various elements of
cross-strait dialogue, but that they happen in certain ways in the
Macau model or using some other model, and the mainland side has
suggested that these are pre-conditions for talks. So all I'm saying
is that it is up to the two sides to determine what that phrase
means-"without pre- conditions." It 's not up to the Americans to lay
that out. It's simply our position that, it's a very logical
exposition of our position: number one, we believe that the set of
issues embedded in the cross-strait [situation] ought to be resolved,
we believe those issues ought to be resolved peacefully. Therefore,
it follows, like day follows night, that there ought to be dialogue.
Q. It seems that there are more restrictions on President Chen's
transiting the U.S. this time. Is that any indication of
U.S.-Taiwan relations?
A: Well, as a general point, I'd encourage you not to judge the
overall relations on the basis of any one event or a set of
exchanges of ideas, whether it be the meetings that happened in
San Diego earlier this week, or the presence or absence of
transits through the United States. None of these are a litmus
test for the entire relationship. So, what I'm trying to do is
simply to steer you away from that way of looking at the
relationship. All that said, this transit was conducted in Miami.
It's a fact that it was completely consistent with the guidelines
that we've set out for every one of these transits, which involves
convenience, comfort and dignity for the individual traveling. So,
I would not read too much into any one transit whether it was in
2003 or 2005.
Q: How do you take this opportunity to convey your messages to
President Chen?
A: As you know, we have regular dialogue through our unofficial
representatives via the American Institute in Taiwan's (AIT)
Washington office as well as the AIT office in Taipei. Those are
our mechanisms for conveying information back and forth about a
whole range of issues, political, cultural, economic, scientific,
that are important to us in relationship between American people
and Taiwan people. Apart from that, I would leave it to the
delegation to describe any communications. That's up to them to
describe whether they want to or not. I'm not presuming their
ability or options to do so.
Q. Recently President Hu Jintao called on the United States to "join
the Chinese side" in safeguarding peace and stability across the
Taiwan Strait, and opposing so-called Taiwan independence. Does
the U.S. accept this view?
A: As in any scenario with the issue, and I know you've studied the
issue very carefully...No, in our exchanges with the PRC on this
issue, we have a very careful and deliberate presentation that we
make on a regular basis whenever we are asked by the mainland side
about this. They need to have their own formulations. They put it
into their own words. Neither side seeks to go out and correct
every word, every comma in the other side's formulation. Something
in illustration of a larger context of the issue, if you go back
to 1972, 1979, clearly, the two sides, the United States and the
People's Republic of China, had agree to disagree, essentially,
through the communiques about this issue. In our presentations,
while there may, and often are, differences in the ways that words
are put together. I think it's safe to say that we understand each
other very well. Our positions are very clear to each other. And
even though we don't have to correct every element of the Chinese
presentation, and similarly, they seek not to pick at our
presentation. Of course, it's very clear we'll include the Taiwan
Relations Act. It's an important part of our conception of the
Taiwan issue in our relationship both with Taiwan and the PRC.
Obviously, there is no reference to the Taiwan Relations Act in
any of their presentations. They certainly do refer to the Three
Communiques on the mainland side. So, there are differences in our
presentations. But I think that simply reflects different emphases
that each side would put on or include in descriptions of our
policies derived from our own national interests. I wouldn't read
too much into the fact either that the Chinese use this particular
formulation in this case, or that we didn't respond to it
publicly. Our position is our position. It has been there for a
long time and it won't be changing. I think the Chinese side
understands it very well.
Q: Edward Ross, a director in the Pentagon's Defense Security
Cooperation Agency, recently had some strong words towards Taiwan
on a defense purchase budget. If in the end Taiwan fails to pass
the arms purchase budget, how would the United States react?
A: I think rather than deal with any one of the many potential
outcomes that may be out there, I'd simply make the point that the
administration is looking for results, and not so much for further
understanding of the complexity of domestic political situations
in Taiwan. I think we have a good feel for that, and we
understand, these are at times complicated issues that are
involved in other parts of the budget and other parts of domestic
political context. But we really believe that time has come for
getting genuine results here, that it's the responsibility for
both the ruling party and opposition parties, not one or the
other.
Q. What's your impression on the [Nationalist Party - Kuomintang]
KMT's new chairman, Ma Ying-jeou? Considering the blue camp
accepts the "one China" policy, if the blue camp wins the
presidency in 2008, how do you think that would impact
cross-strait relations?
A: In my sense, the current situation in the Taiwan Strait is
conducive to not only dialogue between the mainland and elected
representatives of the Taiwan people, but also with progress in
some other areas that have been talked about under the Macau
model. It seems to me this is a good time for progress to be made
in cross-strait, whether by the current ruling party or after the
election in the future by the other side. I think what the most
important this is to look after the interests of the 23 million
Taiwan people. Their interests ought to be paramount regardless of
the personality or party that's in charge. Certainly, from an
outsider point of view, pursuing dialogue and a peaceful
resolution of fundamental issues and progress toward increasing
confidence on both sides in a dialogue that could lead to
stability would be in the best interests for Chinese people on
both sides of the Strait. I do believe that leadership is needed
in this area, because of course there are many controversies
associated with each and every one of the specific proposals for
advancing cross-strait relations. Looking at the trends of two
economies integrating, that is Taiwan and the mainland, which is
part of the global trend, of course. The American economy is
integrating with Asian economies and others around the world. This
globalization is a trend that of course, Taiwan is not going to
escape, or shouldn't escape. It should seize this opportunity,
should take advantage of it from a market perspective, and
certainly from the perspective of American businessmen who want to
be involved in Taiwan and want to be involved with Taiwan in the
mainland. There are great opportunities here. I'd hope that
regardless of the personality in power, the party in power, that
there will be a willingness to maximize the efforts to take this
opportunity.
Q: According to the Washington Times, the State Department's
Inspector General's Office's inspection report said that AIT
Taipei Director Douglas Paal "falsely reported on Taiwanese issues
to senior State Department officials, " and "refused to allow
dissenting views and was guilty of suppressing reports from U.S.
officials who disagreed with his pro-China views." What do you
think about this?
</P>
<P>
A: I find it despicable that anyone would leak this sort of
information. I think what is there available publicly could give you
a good picture of our operation in AIT, which is staffed by terrific
people. And we have the greatest confidence from the leadership on
down in that operation. Beyond that I'm not going to comment. I'm not
going to give any credence to these charges that were put out by
people who obviously had ulterior motives.
Q. What is your assessment on current U.S.-Taiwan relations. I would
imagined that normally there are goods parts, and also some
difficult parts. What are those? And how are communications going
between the two sides?
</P>
<P>
A: I'll take the last point first. I think the communication is
quite good both in Washington and in Taipei. We have very open
channels, as can possibly be, very candid. We talk about, as you
suggest, the whole range of the relationship, including that there
might be some differences. It's not only government to government
dialogue, of course. There is a great deal of back and forth, not
only within the administration, within the government side of the
dialogue, but also with our colleagues in the legislative branch and
from the legislature in Taiwan. I think there is a very rich and full
set of communication on the government side. On our side, of course
that is done through the American Institute in Taiwan. And also in
the private sector, we have tremendous interest in sustaining the
relationship that we have. I think my greatest frustration is that we
haven't been able to get traction on these key issues which would
help us in advancing the relationship in keeping with the advances
that one sees in Taiwan's presence in the mainland. So, looking to
the future, what I'd like to see is a development of rich and
productive exchanges across the board with the private sector and
their Taiwan counterpart that could lead to reconfiguration of
economic exchanges and trade between us, and investment that is
possible not just in our U.S. relationship with Taiwan, but also
looking to other opportunities in the region.
Q: Are you referring to the "three links"?
A: I think it begins with the "three links," but it's very difficult
</P>
<P>
for the government to identify precisely those steps. If you look
</P>
<P>
at the "three links, " I gather, looking from outside as an
</P>
<P>
analyst, the "three links" are precisely those kind of things
</P>
<P>
that are necessary for the governments on the both sides of the
</P>
<P>
Strait to work on, in order to open the doors so that the private
</P>
<P>
sector can do more. Really it's governments' job to set up those
</P>
<P>
kinds of communications links necessary so that individuals can
</P>
<P>
start making the kinds of connections that would be very
</P>
<P>
productive for both sides, and for Taiwan not only to advance its
</P>
<P>
own economic interest but also present an opportunity for
</P>
<P>
enhancing the stability, prosperity, and the predictability of
</P>
<P>
the relationship across the Strait. These ties increase over time
</P>
<P>
through these channels that ought to be open.
</P>
<P>
Q: Again, there is a pre-condition problem for the "three links."
A: All I can say to that is, Chinese from both sides of the Strait
</P>
<P>
found a way around that problem in the past. That means that it
</P>
<P>
can be done.
Q: President Chen has aimed to pass constitutional amendments by the
</P>
<P>
end of 2007. He has pledged to focus on good governance and avoid
</P>
<P>
issues such as sovereignty, name and territory. Does the United
</P>
<P>
States still have concerns over Taiwan's constitutional
</P>
<P>
amendment?
A: I think it is something we have to look at when we have something
</P>
<P>
concrete before us. That's the reason why we want to hear the
</P>
<P>
Taiwan side, what their intent is, what their prospects are, that
</P>
<P>
sort of thing. It's very hard to talk about it in the abstract.
</P>
<P>
Clearly, it's an issue that the Taiwan people have to decide for
</P>
<P>
themselves. But just as clearly, we do have an interest in the
</P>
<P>
overall situation. You know what our obligations are in the
</P>
<P>
Taiwan Relations Act. So we are more than just an interested
</P>
<P>
observer. As a result of that, we hope for very good
</P>
<P>
communications to help us understand what the issues are and once
</P>
<P>
we have a better understanding of a specific case, then we can
</P>
<P>
have an American position about it in terms of what the American
</P>
<P>
overall interest is in cross-strait dialogue and in the region.
</P>
<P>
Clearly these are issues that Taiwan people have to think about,
</P>
<P>
digest and formulate before the United States can have a response
</P>
<P>
to them.
Q. Taiwan has accused China of trying to exploit its economic
leverage over Taiwan politics, such as exempting tariffs for
Taiwan fruit to hurt the [Democratic Progressive Party] DPP's
political base. Taiwan calls such measures "united front tactics."
What do you think about this?
A: In any specific case, the Taiwan side will have to come up with
</P>
<P>
its own analysis and its own policy recommendations. Taking a
</P>
<P>
step back from that specific case and just making a general
</P>
<P>
comment, I think it's difficult to have this both ways. If the
</P>
<P>
Taiwan side wants the mainland to genuinely formulate policy to
</P>
<P>
address the needs and aspirations of the Taiwan people, which we
</P>
<P>
believe it should, then it has to accept that as the mainland
</P>
<P>
addresses some of these issues, they'll touch upon specific
</P>
<P>
interests groups or have an effect in the domestic polity in
</P>
<P>
Taiwan. It's unavoidable. So, while in any one case, one could
</P>
<P>
posit that the mainland is less interested in substance and more
</P>
<P>
interested in the process that it looks like than actually
</P>
<P>
proposing something serious rather than proposing it. I think if
</P>
<P>
we are going to continue to encourage the mainland to address the
</P>
<P>
needs of the Taiwan people, we have to assume that some of those
</P>
<P>
proposals are going to affect some groups more than others, or be
</P>
<P>
more beneficial from one perspective than another. There has to
</P>
<P>
be willingness to deal with that kind of effect as part of any
</P>
<P>
serious proposal for dialogue across the Strait. In other words,
</P>
<P>
it's a mistake to dismiss any proposal simply because it has a
</P>
<P>
domestic political effect in Taiwan. If so, you'll have to
</P>
<P>
dismiss everything because all will be tied up with very
</P>
<P>
difficult domestic politics on both sides. So while I could
</P>
<P>
understand the suspicion and concern that the mainland may be
</P>
<P>
seeking not so much to make progress but just to manipulate, this
</P>
<P>
is exactly the fundamental point that it's up to the Chinese on
</P>
<P>
both sides to find their way back to the situation in which
</P>
<P>
genuine dialogue can happen to address real proposals on both
</P>
<P>
sides to serve the interests of both populations. I think it's
</P>
<P>
undeniable that in a general context, agricultural trade is a
</P>
<P>
good thing across the Strait. Whether this particular proposal
</P>
<P>
fits into the template that you describe or could become or be
</P>
<P>
made to be more serious, is up to the Chinese on both sides of
</P>
<P>
the Strait to determine. But certainly you don't want to rule out
</P>
<P>
agricultural trade completely, because that wouldn't be
</P>
<P>
reasonable. There has to be a way to find a productive ground in
</P>
<P>
between these two extremes, that is, pure propaganda on the one
</P>
<P>
end and complete unwillingness to engage on the other. Somewhere
</P>
<P>
in the middle.
Q. Former President Lee Teng-hui plans to visit the United States,
including Washington, D.C. Would the U.S. agree to let him visit,
considering that he has reportedly declared that he would like to
say what the Taiwan government dared not say.
</P>
<P>
A: Certainly his visit here would not be a concern. The
administration has very clearly indicated on the record that the
former president is a private citizen and more than welcome to visit
the United States. It's incumbent for the former president to
consider the effect of his public rhetoric while he is in the United
States. If, as having been suggested by some comments in the press in
Taiwan, there were deliberately provocative statements that were at
odds with Taiwan government's policy and the American government's
policy, the United States government would have to clarify its own
policy, rather than have it be unclear whether there was a change in
American policy, or whether there is some lack of clarity about
American policy based on the statement that the former president
might make in the United States. The United States welcomes all kinds
of views, including those views that don't accord with current U.S.
policy. It's up to the former president to make up his own mind about
the effect of his comments, and whether they would be at bearing with
long standing policy both of Taiwan and the United States, which
would require some clarification. The political effect of that
clarification between what the former president might say in the
United States and what our policy is, how our policy would be
reiterated, because our policy isn't changing. It's an issue that the
former president ought to think about. I'm not going to presume to
know what the former president has in mind to say in the United
States. I can only make clear that the administration's policy toward
Taiwan is absolutely crystal clear. The president [Bush] has spoken
to this very clearly. There is no change coming in U.S. policy either
on the eve of, during or after a visit by the former president.

TAIWAN, DOMINICAN REPUBLIC SIGN JOINT COMMUNIQUE
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic, Sept. 23 (CNA)
(By S.J. Tsai and Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Visiting
Republic of China President Chen Shu-bian signed a joint communique
with his Dominican Republic counterpart Leonel Fernandez Reyna Friday
to reaffirm bilateral friendship and solidarity between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
President Chen and his entourage arrived in the capital of the
Dominican Republic from Guatemala Friday afternoon and were accorded
a red carpet welcome complete with 21-gun salute and full military
honors.
</P>
<P>
After the signing of the joint communique, the two heads of state
noted that they were happy to see the two countries sign a letter of
intent in February on the signing of a Taiwan-Dominican Republic free
trade agreement (FTA) and that they agreed that the two countries
should begin consultations on the matter immediately so as to
strengthen bilateral economic and trade relations.
</P>
<P>
Fernandez invited Taiwan's public and private enterprises to
invest in his country, vowing that his government will provide
incentives and all necessary assistance.
</P>
<P>
President Chen promised to help promote more investment in the
Dominican Republic, adding that Taiwan will also help the Caribbean
country improve the lives of its garlic growers and urban economy and
set up a burn treatment center for children.
</P>
<P>
For his part, Fernandez expressed his support for Taiwan and his
opposition to the use of force in solving cross-strait disputes. He
also reaffirmed his support for the Republic of China's bid to join
the United Nations, the World Health Organization and other major
international organizations.
</P>
<P>
At a dinner banquet, Fernandez reaffirmed his longstanding
support for the deepening of democracy in Taiwan and his stance of
settling cross-strait disputes by peaceful means.
</P>
<P>
Noting that Taiwan's economic miracle is the model of Asian and
Pacific countries, Fernandez expressed the hope that more Taiwan
entrepreneurs will invest in his country and that the two countries
can sign the FTA soon.
</P>
<P>
President Chen said the signing of the FTA will lure more Taiwan
businesspeople to invest in the Dominican Republic and promote
exchanges between Taiwan and the Caribbean and North America. Taiwan
can also serve as a springboard for businesses in the Caribbean to
make inroads into the Asian market, he noted, adding that the FTA
will create a win-win situation.
</P>
<P>
Chen also said that a softball team comprised of officials and
journalists from Taiwan will have a friendly match with a team
comprised of Dominican Republic officials Saturday morning to help
close the gap between the peoples of the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Chen's ongoing 12-day diplomatic tour will also take him to
Nicaragua, St. Vincent and the Grenadines, and the Federation of St.
Kitts and Nevis.
</P>
<P>
During his stay in Nicaragua, Chen will attend a summit meeting
with his counterparts from five of Taiwan's diplomatic allies in
Central America, namely Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras, Nicaragua
and Costa Rica, in addition to top leaders from Belize, Panama and
the Dominican Republic, as well as the secretary-general of the
System of Central American Integration.

EFFORTS NEEDED TO EXPAND TAIWAN-RUSSIAN RELATIONS: MTAC MINISTER
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Sept. 24 (CNA)
(By Elizabeth Hsu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taiwan needs to expand its exchanges and
upgrade the level of mutual cooperation with Russia under the concept
of regional security, Taiwan's Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs
Commission (MTAC) minister said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Hsu Chih-hsiung made the remarks at the opening of the
MTAC-sponsored 2005 Conference on Geopolitical Relations between
Contemporary Mongolia and Neighboring Asian Countries: Mongolia and
Russia, held at the Civil Service Development Center in Taipei.
</P>
<P>
Seventeen domestic and foreign scholars and experts are attending
the two-day conference to discuss interactions and exchanges between
Mongolia and three Mongolia-descended republics of the Russian
Federation -- Tuva, Buryatia and Kalmyk -- from the perspectives of
politics, economics, regional security and culture.
</P>
<P>
Noting that Russia under President Vladimir Putin has made
efforts to adjust its international political and economic strategies
to adopt to the global trends in the 21st century, Hsu suggested that
Taiwan "walk out of the shadow of China" to try to develop
multilateral interactions with countries in the Asian region.
</P>
<P>
The minister expressed the hope that the Taiwan-Russia friendship
will take root and deepen further and that mutually beneficial
exchanges between the two countries will be established.
</P>
<P>
Hsu also spoke about his several visits to Russia in recent
months, during which he had intensive interactions with high-ranking
officials of the three Russian republics.
</P>
<P>
The participants in the conference include Alexander Brokert,
chairman of the Tuva-Mongolia friendship association; Zhelezniakov
Aleksander, head of the Far East and Central East Center of the
Russian Academy of Sciences; Adiya Tuvshintugs, vice president of
Mongolia's Institute of Strategic Studies; and Chang Chun-hsiung,
chairman of the Taiwan-Russia Association.
</P>
<P>
Chang said that despite the fact that there is a large geographic
distance between the Russian Federation and Taiwan, the latter still
needs to concern itself with Central Asian peace and prosperity and
to try to boost its relations with Russia in a good way.
</P>
<P>
Chang, former ROC premier, is set to depart for Russia at the
head of a trade and economic delegation Sept. 26 for a visit aimed at
enhancing relations between the two countries. Taiwan set up a
representative office in Moscow in 1993 in the absence of formal
diplomatic ties between the two countries, with Russia following suit
three years later by opening a liaison office in Taipei.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan and Mongolia exchanged representative offices in 2002. The
two countries do not maintain formal diplomatic relations.
</P>
<P>
Saturday's conference is the third of its kind since 2003. Topics
discussed at the first two gatherings centered on "Mongolia and
Central Asia" and "Mongolia and Northeast Asia," respectively.

INDONESIAN NAVAL SHIPS RESCUES TAIWANESE FISHING BOAT: MOFA
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Sept. 24 (CNA)
(By Elizabeth Hsu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Pingtung-registered Taiwanese fishing
boat "Chin Chi Wan" which has been hijacked by its Indonesian crew
since Sept. 8 was rescued by two Indonesian naval vessels Saturday in
Indonesian waters, Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) spokesman
Michel Lu said.
</P>
<P>
The boat was allegedly hijacked by three Indonesian fishery
workers aboard after setting off from the coast of Mauritius Aug. 26
for fishing operations in nearby waters. Also on board were a
Taiwanese skipper, identified as Lin Chung-uo, and eight Philippine
crew members.
</P>
<P>
Lu indicated that thanks to the vessel's global positioning
system equipment, the government was able to continue monitoring its
whereabouts. No sooner was the "Chin Chi Wan" discovered sailing
towards Indonesia than the MOFA issued a call for the Indonesian
government's assistance to intercept the boat, he said.
</P>
<P>
No injuries or damage was reported in the rescue operation, and
the Taiwanese skipper called members of his family in Taiwan after
the incident to report that he was in good health, the MOFA official
said.
</P>
<P>
He also noted that the vessel is expected to arrive Monday in the
Indonesian capital of Jakarta where an investigation into the
incident will be launched.

CEC TO PROMULGATE REDISTRICTING PLAN BY NOV. 2006
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei, Sept. 24 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Central Election Commission (CEC) will
promulgate the newly redistricted constituencies for the next
legislative election by the end of November 2006, according to a
written report by CEC Chairman Chang Cheng-hsiung released Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Chang will be invited to give a report to the Home and Nations
Committee at the Legislative Yuan on related operations concerning
the redrawing of the constituencies, as well as anti-graft measures
in the year-end elections and electoral system reforms.
</P>
<P>
Chang noted that according to the constitutional amendment passed
this June, the electoral system for legislators will be changed from
the current multiple seats per constituency to a "single seat, two
votes" format.
</P>
<P>
In line with the constitutional amendment, the CEC, which has
been commissioned with the task of redistricting the constituencies,
will carry out the task in a "fair, objective and impartial" manner,
Chang said, knowing that the issue has been controversial in the
experience of many other countries.
</P>
<P>
Chang said that related operations have included the formation of
a team in July 2005 to work out the redistricting principles, which
are to be sent to municipal, city and county election commissions.
</P>
<P>
The commissions will work out their draft redistricting plans and
hold public hearings by the end of next March and send the results to
the CEC the following month for reference.
</P>
<P>
The CEC team will hold public hearings by the end of next August
and complete a draft redistricting plan by the end of September and
then promulgate it by the end of November.
</P>
<P>
Starting from the seventh legislature to be elected in 2007, the
legislative electoral system will be changed, and the Legislative
Yuan will have only 113 seats and be elected every four years. While
73 seats will be elected from regional districts, there will be six
seats for aboriginal representatives and 34 seats for at-large and
overseas expatriate representatives.
</P>
<P>
CEC officials have said that the redrawing of the constituencies
should be promulgated one year before the term of the incumbent
legislators expires, which means it should be announced by Jan. 31,
2007 at the latest.

CEPD AIMING TO CUT JOBLESS RATE TO 4 PERCENT FOR 2005
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Sept.  24 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Council for Economic Planning and
Development (CEPD) will coordinate related government agencies to
help boost employment and cut the average jobless rate to 4
percent for 2005.
</P>
<P>
CEPD officials said the average unemployment rate for the first
eight months was 4.19 percent, and they want government agencies to
promote various measures, such as training programs and low-interest
loans for youths wanting to start their own businesses, to reach the
4-percent goal for this year.
</P>
<P>
The officials made the remarks as the latest figures released by
the Directorate General of the Budget, Accounting and Statistics
showed that the jobless rate in August was 4.36 percent, up 0.04
percentage points over the previous month's figure due mainly to new
college and university graduates entering the job market.
</P>
<P>
However, the figure represented a 0.31 percentage point drop from
the same month last year, or the lowest for the month in the last
five years, showing that the government's efforts to boost employment
have borne fruit, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
Analysis of the August figures shows that job dissatisfaction
topped the list in terms of newly unemployed workers, with some 6,000
people quitting their jobs during the month for this reason, while
some 2,000 others lost their jobs due to business closures or scaling
down.

TAIWAN'S TRADE FACILITATION MECHANISM PROPOSAL GREETED WARMLY IN WTO
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Sept.  24 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taiwan's proposal to set up a regular
trade facilitation mechanism under the World Trade Organization (WTO)
has been warmly greeted by developing countries in the WTO, a trade
official said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Huang Chih-peng, director general of the Bureau of Foreign Trade
under the Ministry of Economic Affairs, said the proposal is aimed at
encouraging developing and less-developed countries to take part in
the talks on trade facilitation which is one of the main issues in
the Doha Round talks sponsored by the WTO.
</P>
<P>
After the persistent efforts by the General Agreement on Tariffs
and Trade -- the forerunner of the WTO -- and the WTO, the tariffs of
various countries have been slashed significantly, and tariffs are no
longer as much of a barrier to international trade as the large
amounts of red tape that exist in moving goods across borders, Huang
explained.
</P>
<P>
Documentation requirements often lack transparency and are
duplicated in many places, a problem often compounded by a lack of
cooperation between traders and official agencies, and add an extra
cost of 5 percent to 15 percent to the price of the goods, Huang
continued.
</P>
<P>
He said Taiwan presented the written proposal at the eighth
conference of the WTO Trade Facilitation Committee calling for the
establishment of a regular trade facilitation mechanism. He didn't
say where or when this conference was held.
</P>
<P>
With the establishment of such a mechanism, Huang said,
negotiations on and cooperation in wiping out red tape in
international trade can keep going on after the conference of the
committee. By regular mechanism, Huang said, this could mean a
commission, working group, task force or annual meeting.

TAIWAN LAWMAKER PROTESTS AGAINST JAPAN AT U.N.
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
New York,  Sept. 23 (CNA)
(By Eric Tseng and Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Independent Legislator Kao Chin Su-mei
led a group of aboriginal people to lodge a protest Friday at the
United Nations headquarters in New York over Japanese atrocities
against Taiwan's aboriginal people during its colonial rule of Taiwan
between 1895-1945.
</P>
<P>
Kao and nearly 30 representatives from six of Taiwan's indigenous
tribes -- the Bunun, Paiwan, Taroko, Kavalan, Puyuma and Atayal --
gathered at the Dag Hammarskjold Plaza opposite the U.N.
headquarters.
</P>
<P>
They displayed banners and shouted slogans to highlight their
cause, saying that Japan has not taken responsibility for its past
mistakes, and using their songs and dances to tell the Japanese
government that it is time to reflect, apologize and make
compensation for their atrocities.
</P>
<P>
Though their numbers are not many, Kao Chin said, they are
confident that through their determination, they will force change
and gain the support of "all peace-loving and human rights-respecting
people."
</P>
<P>
Kao Chin and her group earlier rallied in front of the Japanese
general consulate to try to present a protest letter, but no one was
there to receive the letter.
</P>
<P>
Kao Chin's group held a press conference in New York, took part
in two charity parties given by Taiwan expatriates, as well as had
exchanges with the aboriginal peoples of the United States during
their stay in the city. They will leave for Philadelphia Monday.
</P>
<P>
Over the past three years, Kao Chin has traveled to Japan seven
times, and her latest trip was in June this year, during which she
demanded an apology and compensation from the Japanese government for
the Taiwanese aborigines who were killed during World War II in
combat as drafted Japanese Imperial Army soldiers.
</P>
<P>
Kao Chin wanted the spiritual tablets of their ancestors, who
fought for the Japanese, removed from the Yasukuni Shrine in Tokyo.
They were placed in the temple along with 2.5 million soldiers who
died fighting for Japan, including more than 28,000 from Taiwan and
1,068 convicted war criminals.
</P>
<P>
Kao Chin had said that it was absurd that the aboriginal
soldiers, whom she described as victims of Japanese persecution, are
honored together with their persecutors at the Yasukuni Shrine.
</P>
<P>
Kao Chin's demand was obstructed each time and she finally filed
suits against the Japanese government.
</P>
<P>
After her trip in the United States, Kao Chin will travel
directly to Osaka to hear the court verdict Sept. 30.

Taiwan tourists topped the list in terms of
number of foreign visitors to Expo Aichi 2005, an official of the

</P>
<P>
Expo Association Secretary-General Toshio Nakamura said that
Taiwan tourists accounted for 18.8 percent of all foreign visitors.
The expo will draw to an end Sunday.

They were followed by South Korean visitors at 15.7 percent,
American visitors at 13 percent, Chinese visitors at 11 percent, and
Australian visitors at 4.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
Nakamura said that the goal of 15 million visitors to the

<P>
Foreign visitors accounted for 5 percent of all visitors to the

The Japanese parliament passed a special bill granting 90-day,
visa-free entry to Taiwan visitors from March 25 through Sept. 25 in

TAIWAN TO ACCOMMODATE CHINESE DEMOCRACY ACTIVISTS IN 3RD COUNTRY
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,   Sept.  24  (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taiwan authorities are trying to
accommodate two Chinese democracy activists in another country and
are offering vocational training to prepare them for living abroad, a
Chinese affairs official said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Yang Chia-chun, director of the Legal Affairs Department under
the Mainland Affairs Council, said the government is doing its best
to offer Yan Peng and Chen Rongli the convenience of living in Taiwan
for the time being, and is exploring through diplomatic channels the
possibility of transferring them to another country.
</P>
<P>
Yang made the remarks after a group of Chinese political
dissidents in China and overseas appealed earlier in the day to
Taiwan to grant asylum to the two.
</P>
<P>
Yan, who escaped from the mainland to Kinmen, a Taiwan-controlled
island off the coast of Fujian, southern China, in June, 2004, had
first been detained in a camp in Ilan as an illegal Chinese immigrant
before being removed to an unspecified place.
</P>
<P>
Calling himself a political dissident, Yan asked for political
asylum in Taiwan. He said he had been jailed by Chinese authorities
in 2002 for 18 months for organizing a rally in Qingdao, Shandong
Province in northern China in 1989 in solidarity with the Tiananmen
democracy campaign in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Yang said his office is trying to verify Yan's claims and his
identification and help him to move to another country as he wishes,
adding that this will take both time and patience.
</P>
<P>
Before he settles in another country, Yang said, the Taiwan
government will provide him with confortable accommodation and
allowance.
</P>
<P>
The government is treating in the same way another
self-proclaimed Chinse dissident, Chen Rongli, who fled to Taiwan in
January, 2004, and sought political asylum.
</P>
<P>
Yang said the government is keeping a low profile in its handling
of the two's asylum bids out of concerns that other countries might
deny them entrance should China protest against it.

TAIWAN MUST MEET CHALLENGES BROUGHT BY CHINA'S ECONOMIC RISE: OFFICIAL
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,   Sept.  24  (CNA)
(By Elizabeth Hsu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taiwan must adjust its industrial
structure, encourage and boost technological research, and develop
brand-name products as the island faces a series of major challenges
stemming from China's economic rise, Vice Minister of Economic
Affairs Chen Ruey-long said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Chen made the remarks at a seminar held at the Dr. Sun
Yat-sen Memorial Hall in Taipei. The challenges facing Taiwan in the
fields of trade and economy include increasing manufacturing costs,
slim profit margins in the high-tech industry, China's rise, the
prevalence of regional economic integration, and strict restrictions
in the Kyoto Protocol on greenhouse gas emissions, he said.
</P>
<P>
Pointing to the worldwide impact of China's economic rise, Chen
said the "over-heated" economic activities in China have attracted a
tremendous amount of "blind" foreign investment inflows. He noted
that foreign direct investment (FDI) in China expanded from US$40.7
billion in 2000 to US$60 billion in 2004, with the latter figure
representing 50 percent of all FDI in Asia and 10 percent of the
global total.
</P>
<P>
This, coupled with China's great demand for raw materials and
energy has resulted in an imbalance in supply and demand. Taking
crude oil as an example, he said the daily consumption of crude oil
in China is expected to increase to 6.89 million barrels this year
from the level of 6.43 million barrels in 2004.
</P>
<P>
In terms of raw steal, China's annual consumption is expected to
rise from 299 million tons in 2004 to 331 million tons for this year,
or 25 percent of the global total.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, products made in China are flooding into markets
around the world. Citing U.S. statistics, Chen said that 13 percent
of imports into the United States in 2004 came from China, up from
only 9 percent in 1999. During the same period, Taiwan's share of US
market slipped from 3.2 percent to 2.5 percent, while Japan's and
South Korea's also slipped.
</P>
<P>
Faced with these trends, Taiwan must increase its competitiveness
by upgrading the conventional industry, encouraging companies to
set up research and development centers, and increasing the add-value
of products.

BUILD UP DEFENSES TO COUNTER CHINA'S RISE: DEFENSE OFFICIAL
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei, Sept. 24 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Facing China's agressive military buildup,
Taiwan's should strengthen its defenses to counter China's aggressive
military buildup, Vice Minister of National Defense Michael M. Tsai
said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
In a seminar organized by the World Taiwanese Congress, 
the vice defense minister said China budgets US$30 billion for
miltiary buildup every year, in addition to secret military spending
of US$60 billion.
</P>
<P>
In light of the fact that China is under no military threat, its
aggressive miltary buildup has belied its claims of peaceful
emergence, Tsai said. 
</P>
<P>
In order to counter China's threat, Taiwan has to strengthen its
defenses by acquiring the package of arms offered to sell by the U.
S., Tsai went on.
</P>
<P>
His opinion was shared by Kurt Campell, senior vice president of
the Washington-based think tank, the Center for Strategic and
International Studies.
</P>
<P>
Campell said at the same seminar that the U.S.,
preoccupied with the crisis in Iraq, has not paid enough attention to
the military threat posed by China in Asia and Taiwan should raise
the US general public's awareness of this.

PRESIDENT ASKED PFP CHIEF TO FORWARD MESSAGE TO CHINESE PRESIDENT
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Santa  Domingo,  Sept.  24 (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President Chen Shui-bian said
Saturday that before opposition People First Party Chairman James
Soong departed for a visit to China in May, he asked him to forward a
message to Chinese President Hu Jintao, but added that he is not sure
whether Soong did so.
</P>
<P>
The message, according to the president, can be summed up in
eight Chinese characters that can roughly be translated as
"sovereignty, democracy, peace and equality."
</P>
<P>
Chen said that by sovereignty, he meant that the fact that the
Republic of China exists must be accepted; by democracy, he meant the
free will of the 23 million people in Taiwan must be respected; by
peace, he meant that any differences between the two sides of the
Taiwan Strait must not be solved with the use of arms or non-peaceful
means; and by equality, he meant any cross-Taiwan Strait negotiations
must be conducted on a government-to-government basis.
</P>
<P>
These four principles, Chen noted, are contained in his 10-point
consensus with Soong that was reached in February. He said he
believes they will be accepted by an absolute majority of people in
Taiwan, as they are also the government's basic position with regard
to China.
</P>
<P>
Chen made the remarks in reply to a media question in a meeting
with the Taiwan press during a visit to the Dominican Republic.
</P>
<P>
A U.S. State Department official recently testified to Congress
that Chen had asked Soong to carry a message to Hu, who received
Soong and Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Lien Chan earlier this year in
Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Chen said he had also authorized Soong to repeat to Hu the
10-point consensus between them.
</P>
<P>
The president said he has never changed his position with regard
to the "one China" issue, a position well documented in newspapers
and government records, and that he stands by it.
</P>
<P>
He noted that he did not feel comfortable disclosing the contents
without Soong's consent and that he was doing it simply in order not
to cause any misunderstanding or distortion of the facts.

PRESIDENT DENIES DOLLAR-DIPLOMACY INITIATIVE
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Santo Domingo,  Sept.  24 (CNA)
(By Tsai Su-jung and Deborah Kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President Chen Shui-bian denied
categorically Saturday allegations that his new initiative to seek
co-prosperity with Taiwan's diplomatic allies in Central America,
dubbed the "Jung Pang Project," is an example of dollar diplomacy.
</P>
<P>
Chen stressed that the project is a new strategy aimed at
assisting Taiwan businesses to invest in Central America and the
Caribbean and cementing diplomatic relations around the region.
</P>
<P>
He denied reports that under the project, US$250 million will be
spent per year, saying that the project will call for an outlay of
US$250 million in total, paid out in stages rather than as a lump
sum.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the new project will be different from the past
practice of subsidizing or simply "giving money" as conducted by the
former Kuomintang government, Chen said the new initiative will
be aimed at helping the diplomatic allies in the region bolster
investment and upgrade industrial structure.
</P>
<P>
The government has adopted the different approach mainly because
it wants to seize the opportunity of the great business opportunities
presented with the passage of the Central American Free Trade
Agreement by the U.S. Congress and the expected formation of the Free
Trade Area of the Americas (FTAA), he said.
</P>
<P>
This is why the government wants to join hands with the private
sector to increase investment in Central America and the Caribbean --
a "win win" program that will not only help Taiwan businesses reach
out to the world, expedite their transformation and diversify the
risks of their investment overseas, but will also help cement
relations with the country's allies, he added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he stressed the imperative of his conducting "head of
state diplomacy, " referring to his effort not long ago to thwart
Beijing's attempt to steal Guatemalan diplomatic recognition from
Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Chen claimed that China has sought to further squeeze out
Taiwan's international space by luring away all of its diplomatic
allies and that under this scheme, Beijing nearly persuaded Guatemala
to sever diplomatic ties with Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Fortunately, he said, he called Guatemalan President Oscar Berger
Perdomo in June, thus solving a diplomatic crisis.
</P>
<P>
Chen said he called Berger in June after learning that the
Guatemalan government was pondering swapping representative offices
with China. In their hotline conversation, Chen recalled, he asked
Berger two questions in his capacity as a good friend to Guatemala:
Whether the office-swapping will indeed benefit Guatemala? And is
Beijing sincere in helping the Guatemalan people out of pure
goodwill?
</P>
<P>
"Guatemalan Foreign Minister Jorge Briz told me during my visit
to Guatemala City a day earlier that "what happened after June proved
that you were right," Chen said.
</P>
<P>
Guatemala was the first leg of Chen's 12-day, five-nation
diplomatic tour of Central America and the Caribbean, which has
already taken him to the Dominican Republic in the Caribbean. The
tour will also take him to Nicaragua, St. Vincent and the Grenadines,
and the Federation of St. Kitts and Nevis.
</P>
<P>
During his stay in Nicaragua, Chen will attend a summit meeting
slated for September 26 with his counterparts from five of Taiwan's
diplomatic allies in Central America -- Guatemala, El Salvador,
Honduras, Nicaragua and Costa Rica -- in addition to the top leaders
from Belize, Panama and the Dominican Republic, as well as the
secretary-general of the System of Central American Integration.

PRESIDENT CALLS FOR SETUP OF CROSS-STRAIT PERMANENT PEACE MECHANISM
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Santo Domingo,  Sept.  24 (CNA)
(By S.J. Tsai and Luis Huang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Republic of China President Chen
Shui-bian called on both sides of the Taiwan Strait Saturday to
jointly seek an interaction mechanism aimed at stepping up
cross-strait permanent peace.
</P>
<P>
Chen made the appeal while speaking at a dinner hosted by the
Taiwanese expatriate community in the Dominican Republic after his
arrival in the Caribbean state for a three-day state visit.
</P>
<P>
Stressing that Taiwan is part of the world but not part of the
People's Republic of China, Chen said that as a democratically
elected president, he will to his utmost to safeguard national
sovereignty, security and dignity while seeking the nation's
sustainable development and cross-strait peace.
</P>
<P>
To achieve the goal, Chen said he has been seeking a mechanism
aimed at boosting cross-strait co-existence, co-prosperity and
permanent peace based upon the principles of equality and
reciprocity.
</P>
<P>
He voiced the hope that the leaderships on the two sides of the
Taiwan Strait will join hands to promote the early establishment of
such a mechanism through goodwill, reconciliation and cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Chen also urged ruling and opposition party leaders to
meet with him as soon possible to exchange views on how to step up
Taiwan's stability and progress.
</P>
<P>
"I hope that the ruling and opposition parties will follow the
example of Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi in putting
public welfare before individual or party interests," Chen said.
</P>
<P>
The coalition government led by Koizumi, chairman of the Liberal
Democratic Party, won overwhelmingly in recent elections of the House
of Representatives, Chen noted. As the House of Councillors vetoed a
major postal reform project put forward by his Cabinet, Koizumi
dissolved the lower house, risking his own political life, Chen went
on.
</P>
<P>
The Dominican Republic is the second leg of Chen's Central
American and Caribbean diplomatic tour, which will also take him to
Nicaragua, St. Vincent and the Grenadines, and the Federation of St.
Kitts and Nevis. Prior to his arrival in Santo Domingo, Chen visited
Guatemala, where he signed a free trade agreement with his Guatemala
counterpart Oscar Berger Perdomo to boost bilateral trade and
economic cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Chen is scheduled to arrive in the Nicaraguan capital of Managua
Monday to attend a summit meeting with his counterparts from five of
Taiwan's diplomatic allies in Central America -- Guatemala, El
Salvador, Honduras, Nicaragua and Costa Rica -- in addition to top
leaders from Belize, Panama and the Dominican Republic, as well as
the secretary-general of the System of Central American Integration.
</P>
<P>
During the summit meeting, which is held alternately in Taiwan
and Central America every two years, Chen and his Latin American
counterparts will discuss various multilateral cooperation projects
and exchange views on the current international situation.

<P>
The chairman of the ruling
Democratic Progress Party (DPP) urged his Kuomintang counterpart
Saturday to jointly work on promoting Taiwan's diplomatic relations
with other countries.
</P>
<P>
Su Tseng-chang, who is accompanying President Chen Shui-bian on a
visit to Taiwan's diplomatic allies in Central America and the
Caribbean, made the appeal while attending a meeting between the
president and reporters in the Dominican Republic.
</P>
<P>
Pointing out the president's efforts to reinforce Taiwan's
diplomatic relations with its allies, Su said he hopes KMT Chairman
Ma Ying-jeou will join hands with him to improve the country's
relations with other countries.
</P>
<P>
Chen had invited opposition leaders to join his state visit, but
the invitation was ignored by both Ma and James Soong, chairman of
the People First Party.
</P>
<P>
In response to the opposition parties' questions raised regarding
the government's aid to its Central American allies and the arms
procurement bill that has long been stalled in the Legislative Yuan,
the DPP head also called for the opposition leaders to work together
in the fields of improving national defense and promoting diplomatic
relations.
</P>
<P>
"Even if the ruling and opposition parties hold different
opinions on various issues, they should deal with diplomatic and
national defense matters with one voice," he said.
</P>
<P>
Shu Chin-chiang, chairman of the Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU) ,
who is also accompanying Chen on his visit to Central America, also
voiced his concern about the long-stalled arms procurement bill in
the legislature. 
</P>
<P>
"Internal affairs can be discussed, while national defense and
diplomacy should be handled with one voice, " he said, adding that
Taiwan can stand up to China only if it can maintain its sovereignty
as well as safeguard its national defense and develop its democracy.

Opposition Kuomintang Chairman
Ma Ying-jeou said Sunday that the KMT's Central Standing Committee
(CSC) will continue to hold "moving meetings" in rural areas in order
to find out about grassroots opinions.
</P>
<P>
Ma made the remarks while heading his deputies Wu Poh-hsiung and
John Kuan, KMT Secretary-General Chan Chuen-po, and CSC members Hung
Hsiu-chu and Lien Sheng-wen at a CSC meeting in Kangshan, Kaohsiung
County.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, the first of its kind, was aimed at showing that the
party is paying attention to rural areas in central and southern
Taiwan, as well as shortening the distance between Taipei and the
countryside, according to the chairman.
</P>
<P>
Ma said the meetings will help committee members better
understand grassroots problems and expectations in the southern part
of the island.
</P>
<P>
He also said that pushing CSC members to go to rural areas is one
of his political views expressed during his KMT chairmanship election
campaign, and he promised that the CSC members will continue to
regularly hold their meetings in central and southern areas rather
than holding such meetings only during election campaigns.
</P>
<P>
Kaohsiung County Council Speaker Hsu Fu-sen and Lin Yi-shih, a
KMT legislator and KMT candidate in the Kaohsiung county magistrate
elections, also attended the meeting.

<TEXT>
<P>
Opposition People First Party (PFP)
spokesman Hsieh Kung-ping said Sunday that PFP Chairman James Soong
did not forward a message from President Chen Shui-bian to Chinese
President Hu Jintao when they met in Beijing in May.
</P>
<P>
Before Soong departed for China, Hsieh said he repeatedly made it
clear that the party does not represent the government and that Soong
himself would not act as a messenger or "secret envoy."
</P>
<P>
The president, who was visiting the Dominican Republic, told the
Taiwan press that he asked Soong to forward an "eight-character"
message to Hu that can be translated as "sovereignty, democracy,
peace, equality." Chen added that he was not sure whether Soong had
passed on the message.
</P>
<P>
Hsieh said two key principles in a 10-point consensus reached
between Chen and Soong, which Chen said he also authorized Soong to
pass on to Hu, concerned returning to the Republic of China
Constitution and peaceful development of cross-Taiwan Strait
relations based on the "constitutional one-China" principle.
</P>
<P>
Hsieh said he did not know what the president was actually aiming
at by disclosing that he had asked Soong to forward the message to
Hu.
</P>
<P>
Chang Hsien-yao, executive director of the PFP's Policy Research
Center, said the U.S. Statement Department recently said that Soong
had carried Chen's message to Hu, but added that the message
definitely was not Chen's "eight-character" message.
</P>
<P>
Soong himself was not available to comment.

good time watching an exhibition featuring himself and his physics
research.
</P>
<P>
Ting, 68, who won the Nobel Prize in physics in 1976, visited the
exhibition titled: "Explore the 90% Unknown -- Samuel C.C. Ting and
the Particle" at the museum, aimed at introducing the world of
physics to the Taiwan public.
</P>
<P>
Ting was fascinated by the exhibition, taking pictures and
examining the displays.
</P>
<P>
He showed particular interest in the play-with-physics section,
where complicated physics issues are explained in simple or funny
ways. On display included an upside down clown, an oil drip
experiment and a bronze accelerator that he donated to the museum
four years ago. He used the accelerator with other big-name
physicists at the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN)
during his years as a young physicist.
</P>
<P>
In another section, Ting noticed that a research paper by his
wife, physicist Susan Marks, was also on display.

KMT: PRESIDENT'S US$250 MILLION FUND EVADES LEGISLATIVE MONITOR
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Kaohsiung, Sept. 25 (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Opposition Kuomintang (KMT) spokeswoman
Chen Li-wen accused President Chen Shui-bian Sunday of evading
legislative monitoring by using taxpayers' money to set up a special
fund in the "co-prosperity" project that he announced in Guatemala
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The US$250 million project, with money coming from the Ministry
of Foreign Affairs' (MOFA) International Cooperation and Development
Fund and the Executive Yuan's Development Fund, is aimed at assisting
Taiwan businessmen to invest in Central America and the Caribbean and
cementing Taiwan's diplomatic ties with countries in the region,
according to the MOFA.
</P>
<P>
In response to media criticism, the president, who was visiting
the Dominican Republic, pointed out that the previous KMT government
spent "astronomical" amounts of money in its efforts to develop
foreign ties before being voted out in 2000.
</P>
<P>
However, Cheng said the president was merely trying to confound
the public about the real focus of the issue, which, according to the
KMT, is that he has violated the law by setting up the special fund
without going through the budget screening procedure at the
Legislative Yuan.
</P>
<P>
The people realize that it is extremely difficult for Taiwan's
diplomats to expand the country's foreign relations and that money
must be spent to achieve that purpose, but procedure must be
followed, she said.

ARMS PACKAGE MERITS FREE, RATIONAL DEBATE IN LEGISLATURE: SPEAKER
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Sept.  25 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng
said Sunday that the long-stalled arms procurement package deserves
free and rational discussion in the legislature.
</P>
<P>
Wang was referring to a government plan to purchase three
big-ticket weaponry systems from the United States, which has failed
to make the legislative agenda for more than a year due to the
opposition "pan-blue alliance's" obstruction.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a roundtable meeting on arms procurement and national
development sponsored by a private anti-arms procurement group, Wang
said that as the proposed arms procurement package is related to
national security, government financial status and economic
development, it should be put forward for extensive discussions
before any decision is made.
</P>
<P>
"My observation is that the arms procurement package, which
includes eight diesel-electric submarines, six Patriot PAC III
anti-missile batteries and a squadron of 12 P-3C anti-submarine
aircraft, should be addressed in line with the principles of
democracy and rule by law," Wang said.
</P>
<P>
Noting that democracy and rule by law have been Taiwan's most
admirable achievements after several decades of hard work, Wang said
the handling of this massive arms procurement project should
exemplify those spirits.
</P>
<P>
While U.S. President George W. Bush approved the robust arms
sales package to Taiwan in April 2001, Wang said the Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) administration did not refer the two arms
procurement-related bills to the legislature until mid-2004. As the
draft bills drew mixed reactions, the DPP administration withdrew the
two bills earlier this year and sent two revised ones to the
legislature shortly before the opening of the current legislative
session early this month.
</P>
<P>
According to the revised bills, the funds needed for the Patriot
anti-missile batteries will come from the government's regular budget
while the remaining two items will be financed by a special budget.
</P>
<P>
Wang said he was scheduled to call a cross-party consultative
meeting Monday to work out a schedule for screening the central
government's budget bill for 2006. As the budget plan includes funds
for the proposed Patriot procurement, Wang said its fate remains
uncertain.
</P>
<P>
In his view, Wang said, the legislature should allow free and
rational debate on the arms procurement package.
</P>
<P>
The opposition "pan-blue alliance" of the Kuomintang and the
People First Party has used its slim majority in the legislature's
Rules Committee to block the two arms procurement-related bills from
being placed on the legislative agenda 29 times.

PRESIDENT ATTACHES NO IMPORTANCE TO ARMS PROCUREMENT PROJECT: KMT
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Pingtung,  Sept.  25  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Opposition Kuomintang Chairman Ma
Ying-jeou claimed Sunday that it is President Chen Shui-bian and his
ruling Democratic Progressive Party that attach no importance to the
much-talked-about arms procurement project rather than the
opposition.
</P>
<P>
Ma, on the campaign trail in the southernmost county of Pingtung
with a KMT group, rebutted Chen's accusations in Central America and
the Caribbean over the past several days that Taiwan's opposition
parties have been opposing the arms procurement project because they
want to curry favor with Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Discounting Chen's remarks, Ma said that the United States agreed
in 2001 to sell the three weaponry items -- eight diesel-electric
submarines, six Patriot PAC III anti-missile batteries and a squadron
of 12 P-3C anti-submarine aircraft -- to Taiwan, but the DPP
government did not submit a bill in this regard until three years
later.
</P>
<P>
This, Ma claimed, indicates that Chen and the DPP did not pay
major heed to the matter.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Ma said, when the KMT was in office, arms procurement
budget accounted for 4 percent of the country's gross domestic
product (GDP) , but today the figure has fallen to 2.4 percent since
the DPP took power.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Ma claimed that Chen was trying to blur the focus of
attention by stressing a day earlier that the "Prospering with
Allies" project calling for US$250 million to be spent in investing
in Central America and the Caribbean was "by no means an example of
the dollar diplomacy that was practiced by the former KMT
government."
</P>
<P>
The problem with the project, according to Ma, is that it has not
been approved or overseen by the legislature. While the Legislative
Yuan will have no way to oversee the project, it will be a problem
for all parties concerned how the money should be used and who will
get the money, he said.

The delegation is hoping to recruit around 2,000 experts to work
in Taiwan, according to Liao.
</P>
<P>
In addition to holding interviews with applicants from various
famous schools in the Los Angeles area, the delegation members also
handed out a variety of pamphlets and encouraged those wishing to
join Taiwan high-tech firms and research institutions to sign up
through the Ministry of Economic Affairs Web site.
</P>
<P>
Liao said that a total of 599 high-tech experts were recruited to

PRESIDENT VOWS NOT TO ENGAGE IN 'DOLLAR DIPLOMACY' WAR WITH CHINA
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Santo Domingo,  Sept. 24 (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President Chen Shui-bian announced
Sunday that the government has "given up the dollar diplomacy" used
by the previous Kuomintang government and will not engage in a "money
spending" war with China in order to win diplomatic allies.
</P>
<P>
While enumerating the government's new diplomatic strategy, Chen
repeatedly mentioned the previous KMT government's spending record.
</P>
<P>
He said China has announced "astronomical" amounts of foreign aid
projects that it might not be able to carry through. By contrast, he
said, Taiwan does not boast but keeps its word -- which is why Nauru
was willing to resume ties with Taiwan after being fooled by China's
empty promises.
</P>
<P>
Chen quoted the U.S. assistant deputy secretary of state in
charge of Latin America affairs as saying that over the past two
years, China has won over some of Taiwan's allies in that part of the
world such as Grenada and the Commonwealth of Dominica by spending
hugely.
</P>
<P>
"Taiwan must never engage in a spending competition with China, "
he said, adding that it should instead strengthen trade and economic
cooperation with other countries by investing in niche industries and
value-added projects.
</P>
<P>
He explained that if need be, the government can join the
business community or make loans to them to invest in less-developed
diplomatic allies.
</P>
<P>
In fact, the government has been doing precisely that, but will
do it more thoroughly in order to create a win-win situation for
Taiwan's allies and for Taiwan itself, he added.
</P>
<P>
As to why Taiwan needs diplomatic allies, Chen said that without
them, no one will be willing to speak for Taiwan in such forums as
the United Nations and the World Health Organization.
</P>
<P>
He urged Taiwan's opposition parties not to show an aversion to
"our international friends and allies."

FORMER FM REFUSED TO ACT ON US$300 MILLION KOSOVO PROJECT
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taichung,  Sept.  25 (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Former Foreign Affairs Minister Jason
Hu, now Taichung mayor, said Sunday that while he was foreign
minister, he "warded off" a government project to give US$300 million
in aid to victims of the Kosovo conflict, a move that he said
offended his superiors.
</P>
<P>
Hu made the remarks in response to President Chen Shui-bian
naming him and John Chiang, another opposition Kuomintang former
foreign minister, as two former officials who best know about
Taiwan's "dollar diplomacy."
</P>
<P>
Hu said he did not know the exact context of Chen's statement,
but he recalled his role in refusing to act on a government project
for Kosovo conflict victims in Macedonia. He added that by doing
that, he invoked displeasure from then-President Lee Teng-hui, who
initiated the project.
</P>
<P>
Hu, who was foreign minister from 1997 to 1999, said that if Chen
aimed to criticize him and Chiang, he had better check his facts.
</P>
<P>
He said he totally agrees with Chen with regard to the policy of
not engaging in a "dollar diplomacy" war with China because "once
you've used up your money, you lose the friendship you've bought."
</P>
<P>
Taiwan must not compete with China in using money to buy
diplomatic friendship because in the end, "the other guy will
outspend you," Hu added.
</P>
<P>
It appeared that Hu was also explaining his diplomatic record to
Premier Frank Hsieh, who said in Pingtung, southern Taiwan, that the
KMT government used "dollar diplomacy" -- the US$300 million Kosova
project -- in a bid to set up official ties with Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
"After just two days, the diplomatic ties broke down, " Hsieh
said, adding that Chen's "co-prosperity" project to be financed with
a special US$250 million fund, is not "dollar diplomacy" but rather a
reform of the government's foreign relations strategy.

PRESIDENT TO CALL HIMSELF  'TAIWAN PRESIDENT' IF INVITED TO CHINA
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Santo Domingo,  Sept.  24 (CNA)

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President Chen Shui-bian said in
Santo Domingo Saturday that he will address himself as "Taiwan
president" if he manages to visit China.
</P>
<P>
Chen, who is currently on a two-day state visit to the Caribbean
nation of the Dominican Republic, made the remarks during an informal
meeting with Taiwan journalists to clarify an earlier statement that
he is willing to hold "rational dialogue" any time and anywhere with
his People's Republic of China counterpart Hu Jintao without any
preconditions.
</P>
<P>
"The statement made during my transit stop in Miami, Florida
earlier this week should not be misinterpreted as a compromise on my
stance. Any dialogue should take place under the principles of
'sovereignty, democracy, peace and parity.' This is common sense, "
Chen explained.
</P>
<P>
Since no political strings should be attached, Chen said, Beijing
should not mention the so-called "1992 consensus" or its "one China"
principle as a prerequisite for resuming dialogue across the Taiwan
Strait.
</P>
<P>
Chen said he understands that China is unlikely to agree or
accept his "no preconditions" appeal.
</P>
<P>
"But the United States agrees and supports the 'no preconditions'
proposal. I will not give up any possible effort or chance lightly, "
Chen said.
</P>
<P>
Noting that senior U.S. officials, including President George W.
Bush, have on many occasions encouraged cross-strait dialogue and
pushed Beijing leaders to talk with Taiwan's popularly elected
president, Chen said he appreciates U.S. concern about the
cross-strait situation.
</P>
<P>
Chen said he has never been afraid to hold talks with China.
Nevertheless, he said, Taiwan should be patient enough to wait for
the right time to come.
</P>
<P>
"It takes two to dance. We cannot harbor wishful thinking nor
should we be rash as far as cross-strait issues are concerned, " Chen
said.
</P>
<P>
Stressing that "reconciliation but no retreat, firmness without
confrontation" has been his administration's basic stance on
cross-strait engagement, Chen said reconciliation is by no means a
surrender of Taiwan's fundamental position toward China.
</P>
<P>
Chen further said he is Taiwan's president. "Whenever I visit
foreign countries, regardless of whether they have diplomatic ties
with Taiwan or not, I have consistently addressed myself as 'Taiwan
president.' If I have the opportunity to visit China, I will do the
same," he added.
</P>
<P>
The Dominican Republic is the second leg of his current
five-nation diplomatic tour that already took him to Guatemala and
will take him to Nicaragua, St. Vincent and the Grenadines, and the
Federation of St. Kitts and Nevis.

PRESIDENT'S CO-PROSPERITY INITIATIVE NOT  DOLLAR DIPLOMACY: PREMIER

<TEXT>
<P>
Premier Frank Hsieh claimed Sunday that a
new initiative unveiled by President Chen Shui-bian to seek
co-prosperity with Taiwan's diplomatic allies in Central America is
not dollar diplomacy.
</P>
<P>
Hsieh made the remarks after opposition parties criticized Chen's
initiative calling for an outlay of US$250 million, describing it as
money diplomacy. Chen, who is on a diplomatic tour of several Central
American and Caribbean states, announced the project during a
just-concluded visit to Guatemala.
</P>
<P>
According to Hsieh, the project is a new strategy aimed at
encouraging Taiwanese manufacturers to invest in Central American
countries to offer locals more jobs, which he said will both help
improve bilateral relations and facilitate Taiwan companies' global
expansion drive.
</P>
<P>
Claiming that the new initiative will be different from the
former Kuomintang government's financial assistance practices, Hsieh
said the KMT government gave money to the Republic of Macedonia in
exchange for diplomatic recognition, but shortly afterwards,
Macedonia switched diplomatic allegiance from Taipei to Beijing.

CABINET: 'CO-PROSPERITY' FUND TRANSPARENT, MULTILATERAL
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Sept. 25 (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Executive Yuan spokesman said Sunday
that a US$250 million "co-prosperity" fund that President Chen
Shui-bian announced in Central America is a transparent, multilateral
and bilateral mechanism that involves many cooperative projects in 12
countries that are diplomatic allies of the Republic of China.
</P>
<P>
Cho Jung-tai said what makes it different from previous trade and
economic cooperation funds is that the government will act more
aggressively to persuade state-run and private enterprises to seek
strategic alliances globally,
</P>
<P>
Cho noted that the government believes the US$250 million fund,
which will come from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' International
Cooperation and Development Fund and the Executive Yuan's Development
Fund, will operate in a transparent milieu and create a win-win
situation for the government and businesses in Taiwan, as well as in
Central and South America.
</P>
<P>
In contrast to the previous practice of government subsidies,
five new ideas have been adopted in the drafting of the
"co-prosperity" fund, he said: the government will assist businesses
to make independent investment; businesses are welcome to make joint
investment with the government; private businesses can cooperate with
state-run enterprises; Taiwan businesses can cooperate with a
diplomatic ally's enterprises; and Taiwan businesses can cooperate
with third-country businesses in a diplomatic ally.
</P>
<P>
Cho said under the new government initiative, Taiwan's businesses
can make good use of the large pool of labor and new market
opportunities offered by CAFTA (U.S.-Central America-Domincan
Republic Free Trade Agreement) and FTAA (Free Trade Areas of the
Americas) to build bridgeheads in Central America.
</P>
<P>
He said the government believes that the fund will help Taiwan
businesses diversify their investment risks and gain new business
opportunities.
</P>
<P>
Cho said the details of the fund were initially to be announced
at a summit meeting by President Chen Shui-bian on Sept. 27 but were
"accidentally misquoted" and then reported, drawing criticisms from
the media and politicians.

Yeh, a former vice premier who also once served as minister of

PRESIDENT QUESTIONS RATIONALE BEHIND OPPOSITION TO ARMS PACKAGE
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Santo Domingo,  Sept.  24 (CNA)
(By S.J. Tsai and Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President Chen Shui-bian said in
Santo Domingo Saturday he is hopeful that the opposition "pan-blue
alliance" of the Kuomintang (KMT) and the People First Party (PFP)
can stop its stonewalling of a long-stalled arms procurement package
from being debated in the legislature.
</P>
<P>
Speaking with a group of Taiwan journalists covering his current
five-nation diplomatic tour, Chen said the plan to purchase three
big-ticket weaponry systems from the United States was fleshed out
during the previous KMT administration.
</P>
<P>
"It's hard to imagine why the KMT would boycott the bill to such
an extent as to the bill cannot even make the legislative agenda for
more than a year, " Chen said in an informal meeting with Taiwan
journalists.
</P>
<P>
During his transit stop in Miami, Florida en route to Guatemala
before coming to the Dominican Republic, Chen recalled that he talked
with an influential U.S. congressional leader by phone.
</P>
<P>
"The congressional leader told me that he will meet with U.S.
Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld and they will send a joint letter to
KMT Chairman Ma Ying-jeou to seek Ma's support for the arms
procurement package," Chen said.
</P>
<P>
According to Chen, he had advised the U.S. congressional leader
to also write to PFP Chairman James Soong because Soong has played a
key role to block the package from being placed onto the legislative
agenda for discussion and deliberation.
</P>
<P>
Chen claimed that Taiwan's opposition leaders have been
stonewalling the arms procurement package to curry favors with
Beijing.
</P>
<P>
The arms procurement package comprises three big-ticket items --
eight diesel-electric submarines, six Patriot PAC III anti-missile
batteries and a squadron of 12 P-3C anti-submarine aircraft.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, Chen said, the then-KMT administration asked the United
States to sell Taiwan Patriot PAC III anti-missile batteries and the
U.S. government approved the request in 1999.
</P>
<P>
"At that time, I have not yet assumed the presidency. After I
took the presidency in 2000, my administration began to prepare a
budget bill for the procurement project in line with the principle of
policy continuity," Chen said.
</P>
<P>
As to the submarine procurement plan, Chen said, it was
determined during a 1994 meeting between then-KMT government and U.S.
military authorities.
</P>
<P>
Now that Taiwan has become a full-fledged democracy, Chen said
any major policy initiative can be put forward for open debate and
discussion, including the arms procurement project.
</P>
<P>
Against this backdrop, Chen said, it is unthinkable that the
opposition "pan-blue alliance" has used its slim majority in the
Legislative Yuan to completely obstruct any discussion or debate on
the package.
</P>
<P>
In the face of China's mounting military threat, Chen said he
earnestly hopes that the "pan-blue alliance" can allow the package to
be placed on the legislative agenda for discussion and deliberation.
</P>
<P>
"If lawmakers think that the procurement cost is unreasonably

TENS OF THOUSANDS TAKE TO THE STREETS TO BACK ARMS PROCUREMENT
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Sept 25 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An estimated 50,000 local people, mostly
from pro-independence groups, marched through major Taipei streets
Sunday to back an arms procurement package aimed at fending off China
but stonewalled by the opposition-controlled legislature.
</P>
<P>
Holding banners and chanting slogans of "Safeguard Taiwan" and
"Strengthen Defenses, " the marchers condemned opposition lawmakers
for blocking the government's plan to purchase eight diesel-electric
submarines, a squadron of 12 P-3C anti-submarine aircraft and six
Patriot PAC III anti-missile batteries from the United States.
</P>
<P>
But dozens of arms procurement opponents staged a small protest
outside the Legislative Yuan, claiming that the U.S. arms deal could
start an arms race with China and squeeze social welfare spending.
</P>
<P>
The two groups were separated by hundreds of police and barbed
wire barricades. Some members from the two sides traded barbs at
times, but no conflicts erupted.
</P>
<P>
The march was jointly organized by the
Hand-in-Hand-to-Protect-Taiwan Alliance and the World Taiwanese
Congress.
</P>
<P>
Ng Chiautong, the event's chief organizer, said the parade will
show the world that the people of Taiwan will not be bullied by China
and are determined to defend Taiwan's independent sovereign status.
</P>
<P>
Ng blamed the opposition "pan-blue alliance" of the Kuomintang
and the People First Party for boycotting the arms procurement
package.
</P>
<P>
"If we don't give our soldiers the most advanced weapons, how are
they supposed to fight China and defend Taiwan? " Ng said, adding:
"We must be willing to pay for the weapons for our own defense and we
must be confident Taiwan will not lose."
</P>
<P>
In addition to pro-independence groups, some lawmakers and senior
executives from the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) and its
ally -- the Taiwan Solidarity Union -- also took part in the parade
to call for more public support for the arms procurement package.
Organizers estimated the number of participants to the parade at
about 50,000.
</P>
<P>
For more than a year, opposition lawmakers have used their slim
majority in the legislature to scuttle plans to debate the arms
package on the excuse that it would spark an arms race with China
that could bankrupt Taiwan's economy.
</P>
<P>
The DPP administration recently made a compromise offer and
reduced the special appropriation to NT$340 billion (about US$11
billion), deferring part of it to the regular defense budget. Defense
officials say the arms package is aimed at deterring a Chinese
invasion, not provoking war.

himself to make changes in the established moral and religious
institutions."

ROC PRESIDENT REITERATES 'FOUR STAGES OF ROC THEORY' IN NICARAGUA
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Managua,   Sept.  25  (CNA)
(By S.J. Tsai and P.C.Tang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Republic of China President Chen
Shui-bian reiterated Sunday in Nicaragua the "four stages of the
Republic of China theory" he created last month to stress the
importance of national identity.
</P>
<P>
Chen, who arrived in Nicaragua the same day from the Dominican
Republic for a two-day visit, made the reiteration while attending a
banquet hosted by local Taiwan expatriates in his honor.
</P>
<P>
During his meeting with a group of USA Formosa Foundation
visitors in August in Taipei, the president raised the theory to
separate the ROC into four stages -- the ROC was first set up in
1912, it then moved to Taiwan in 1949, it became "the ROC on Taiwan"
when former President Lee Teng-hui was in power, and it has become
"the ROC is Taiwan" since he himself became president in 2000.
</P>
<P>
Chen said that the people's affirmation of national identity is
one of the most important supports of a country, adding that national
identity was really confused and unclear in Taiwan during the long
period of "one party" rule.
</P>
<P>
Although Taiwan cannot be separated from its history nor
overthrow the evolution process of history, the public must have an
idea about the national identity of their country, he further said,
adding: "This is why I raised the "four stages of ROC theory, " which
is entirely in line with objective historical facts."
</P>
<P>
Chen also emphasized the fact that the ROC absolutely does not
equal the People's Republic of China as the two are not only
separated from each other and do not belong to each other, but are
also under the rule of different governments.
</P>
<P>
Facing China's continuous efforts to block Taiwan from
participating in the international community, the president said that
his government will adhere to the principle of "Taiwan first, global
development, reciprocal interests and crisis management" and use this
principle as a guideline to deal with cross-strait relations and make
Taiwan into an example of freedom, democracy and human rights in the
world.
</P>
<P>
Touching on the island's failure in its bid to join the United
Nations this year due to Beijing's obstruction, the president urged
the world organization to "work bravely" on defending international
justice and peace. "The U.N. should not succumb to China's pressure,"
he added.
</P>
<P>
Two proposals put forward by Taiwan's diplomatic allies at the
U.N.'s 60th General Assembly to support the representation of the 23
million people of the island in the organization and to call for the
world body to play an active role in maintaining peace in the Taiwan
Strait were voted down by the U.N. General Committee from being
placed on the assembly's agenda.
</P>
<P>
Praising the remarkable courage shown by Nicaraguan President
Enrique Bolanos Geyer and Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi
in dealing with reforms in their countries, Chen promised that he
will do whatever he can to push reform in Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
"I hope to see a new and suitable Constitution be introduced in
Taiwan before I step down from my post, " he added.
</P>
<P>
Chen, at the head of a group of high-ranking officials and
business leaders, was greeted at the airport upon his arrival in the
country by his Nicaraguan counterpart and accorded red carpet
treatment complete with full military honors.

TAIPEI DISASTER MEDICAL TEAM SET UP

Taipei,  Sept.  26 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Taipei Disaster Medical Assistance
Team (TDMAT) was formally established Monday to serve as the first
medical service system responding to health emergencies or peacetime
disasters in cities and counties around Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Taipei City Mayor Ma Ying-jeou officiated at a ceremony marking
the inauguration of the TDMAT in his capacity as head of the disaster
medical team.
</P>
<P>
The ceremony was held at Taipei City Hospital's Zhong Xing
Branch, where a helicopter landing apron to be used in the TDMAT
operations was also inaugurated.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the ceremony, Ma said a disaster medical assistance
team backed up with helicopters will usher Taipei's medical services
into a new era.
</P>
<P>
The new service will not only shorten medical service
administrative procedures, it will also "uplift" the efficiency of
disaster medical services in Taipei, Ma said.
</P>
<P>
He added that although the disaster medical assistance team has
been founded by Taipei City Government, it can be used to help people
in other cities and counties around the country, particularly people
in offshore areas.
</P>
<P>
Also speaking at the ceremony, Taipei City Hospital
Superintendent Chang Hang noted that accidents ranked as the fifth
major cause of death in Taiwan and the sixth in Taipei City for the
third year in a row in 2004, prompting the city government to
establish the TDMAT to deal with emergency situations more
efficiently.
</P>
<P>
Chang said that emergency medical services have become one of the
most important areas in the development of modern medical services.
The TDMAT will respond to emergency medical needs in the greater
Taipei area, which includes Taipei County, as well as offshore and
remote areas, such as the islands of Kinmen and Matsu.
</P>
<P>
The ceremony was followed by a drill to test the TDMAT's response
in a simulated disaster emergency in central Taiwan.

NEW ACTING KAOHSIUNG MAYOR PAINTS ROSY PICTURE FOR HARBOR CITY

<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Sept. 26 (CNA)

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Yeh Chu-lan, senior advisor to President
Chen Shui-bian, said Monday that the mass rapid transit (MRT)
construction program in Kaohsiung will continue "in high quality" and
vowed to turn the harbor city into the "brightest star in Taiwan's
landscape."
</P>
<P>
Yeh made the remarks after she took over the acting Kaohsiung
mayor post from Chen Chi-mai in a ceremony presided over by Premier
Frank Hsieh. Also witnessing the changeover ceremony were
Presidential Office Secretary-General Yu Shyi-kun, Minister of the
Interior Su Jia-chyuan and other ranking officials.
</P>
<P>
Yeh said that she is committed to the wellbeing of the city and
that she will listen to the voice of the residents, plan the city's
economic development, introduce more high-tech businesses and
reinvigorate the economy.
</P>
<P>
She said that Kaohsiung's MRT construction will continue and that
its quality will not be compromised, promising that part of the MRT
lines will be inaugurated by Oct. 2006.
</P>
<P>
She also listed some of the priorities in her administration,
including setting up an MRT monitoring team, pulling out all the
stops for the preparation for the 2009 World Games, and building a
city of law and order.
</P>
<P>
Yeh's predecessor offered to resign after the Aug. 21 riot by
Thai workers working for the Kaohsiung Rapid Transit Corp. (KRTC) to
protest against what they perceived as harsh and unreasonable
management.
</P>
<P>
Yeh said that she can understand that the Kaohsiung residents'
approval rating for city construction plummeted, as seen in recent
polls, after the MRT construction scandal. She stressed that her
administration will "revive the passion of the residents as well as
their confidence."
</P>
<P>
She said that newly-appointed Deputy Mayor Tang Jinn-chuan is a
former Vice Minister of Justice and a legal expert. Another deputy
mayor, Cheng Wen-lung, is an engineering expert. Liao Chin-lung,
former director general of the Bureau of High Speed Rail, will also
be invited to join her administration, she continued.
</P>
<P>
With their expertise in legal and engineering affairs, Yeh said
she is confident that the MRT construction program will proceed
smoothly.

MAC ASKS TEMPLE MANAGERS TO REFRAIN FROM JOINING MAINLAND ORGANIZATION
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Sept. 26 (CNA)
(By Elizabeth Hsu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) urged
managers of religious temples around Taiwan Monday to refrain from
joining a national cultural organization in China, warning that
joining the group would be in violation of Taiwan's laws.
</P>
<P>
MAC Vice Chairman You Ying-lung made the call at a news
conference after the council unveiled a report on Chinese
authorities' alternative "united front" strategy of taking advantage
of a traditional Chinese religion centered around Matsu -- the
goddess of the sea.
</P>
<P>
You noted that the Chinese Matsu Cultural Exchange Association
was established last October on Meizhou Island off Putian in the
Chinese province of Fujian, and officially sanctioned. At its first
congress, managers of 57 temples around Taiwan were seen on its list
of executive members.
</P>
<P>
When asked about their participation in the Chinese national
organization, over 80 percent of these temple managers replied that
they did not join the group, while some of them answered that they
have totally no idea why they were listed, You said.
</P>
<P>
Under the existing Statute Governing the Relations Between the
People of the Taiwan Area and the Mainland Area, religious temples in
Taiwan are banned from serving as members of any China-based
organization like the Matsu Cultural Exchange Association.
</P>
<P>
Meizhou Island is home to the first Matsu temple of its kind and
therefore attracts large numbers of devout Taiwanese believers every
year to make visits to pay homage to the sea goddess.

TAIWAN INCREASING MILITARY EXCHANGES WITH CENTRAL AMERICA: MND
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Sept. 26 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taiwan's military has increased exchanges
with its counterparts in Central America since the Ministry of
National Defense (MND) was invited to take part in the Central
American Military Forum in April this year, Defense Minister Lee Jye
said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan was invited to take part in the Central American Military
Forum as an observer, making it the forum's fifth observer states
behind the United States, Germany, France and the Dominican Republic,
Lee said.
</P>
<P>
The ministry's participation in the forum marked one of the
nation's major breakthroughs in international military exchanges in
recent years, Lee claimed during a session at the Legislative Yuan
National Defense Committee.
</P>
<P>
In the future, he said, the MND will also expand exchanges and
interactions with its counterparts in the Asia-Pacific region, as
well as seek collaboration in war games and training drills, and help
strengthen security efforts in the region.
</P>
<P>
For instance, the MND will continue to expand bilateral exchanges
with Japan, aimed mainly at establishing a format for regular visit
exchanges with Japanese security and public safety authorities, Lee

MANDATORY MILITARY SERVICE TO BE TRIMMED TO 16 MONTHS FROM 2006

<TEXT>
<P>
The mandatory military service period for
local conscripts will be cut to 16 months from the current 18 months
from Jan. 1, 2006, Minister of National Defense Lee Jye said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a Legislative Yuan Defense Committee meeting, Lee said
the compulsory military service period will be further trimmed to one
year by July 2008.
</P>
<P>
Lee also told lawmakers that the military began to promote a
volunteers-conscripts mixed system this year, with an ultimate goal
of implementing an all-volunteer service system.
</P>
<P>
According to Lee, the military plans to recruit 6,561 volunteer
soldiers this year. As of August, 4,380 volunteers had been
recruited, or 67 percent of the target figure.
</P>
<P>
"The smooth recruitment indicates that a voluntary military has
gradually received social recognition, " Lee said, adding that the
military is set to recruit up to 45,561 volunteer soldiers and
reserve non-commissioned officers by the end of 2008.
</P>
<P>
With a view to upgrading military professionalism, Lee said the
Ministry of National Defense (MND) will continue to streamline its
recruiting mechanism, revise the existing law to expand the sources
of recruitment, ease age limits for those intending to pursue a
military career, recruit female soldiers, lower the retirement age,
and mobilize reservists to join disaster prevention and relief work.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Lee said, the MND will coordinate with the Ministry of
the Interior to improve conscription operations to lessen social
problems that may arise from the fact that some young male adults
have to wait a long time before being drafted into mandatory military
service.
</P>
<P>
In line with the Cabinet's efforts to lower the unemployment
rate, Lee said the MND will draft 2,000 additional conscripts by the
end of this year.

Republic of China President
Chen Shui-bian will meet with his Panamanian counterpart, Martin

his counterparts from four of Taiwan's diplomatic allies in Central
America and the Caribbean -- El Salvador, Honduras, Nicaragua and
Belize. The summit will also call together vice presidents or foreign
ministers from Panama, the Dominican Republic and Costa Rica, as well
as the secretary-general of the System of Central American
Integration.
</P>
<P>
Similar private meetings were also arranged between Chen and
Honduran President Ricardo Maduro, Belize Prime Minister Said Musa
and El Salvadoran President Antonio Saca, according to foreign
ministry officials.
</P>
<P>
President Chen is scheduled to host a dinner party Monday evening
in honor of the political leaders from the nine allies in the region
who will be attending the summit.

One is to have all members take up a pension

The other is to get them to but life

LI AO TO MAINLAND YOUTHS: IT'S TIME TO SAY GOODBYE TO MARXISM
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Noted Taiwan writer and independent
Legislator Li Ao said in Shanghai Monday that the young generation
should by now be disillusioned with Marxism as being outdated and
that the school of thought should be relegated to history.
</P>
<P>
In his speech at Fudan University's College of Humanities, Li
said that China has produced many talented people in the fields of
science, technology and other areas, but for many years they have
faced a disadvantage because everything in China must be viewed
through the prism of Marxism.
</P>
<P>
He encouraged mainland youths to embrace liberalism, but added
that real liberalism must be accompanied with the ability to discern
between truth and falsehood, so that they no one could deceive them.
</P>
<P>
Li said that a paradise cannot be created with sheer patriotism
and efforts, but can be realized when people with the right expertise
employ the right methods at an opportune time.
</P>
<P>
He added that the Communist Party of China will become more open
and liberalized if the mainland people force it, coax it and admonish
it in that direction.
</P>
<P>
Li, an author of more than 100 books, said that he would like to
use his visit to China to announce that he has abandoned his beliefs
as a liberal because liberalism itself is something too elusive and
intangible.
</P>
<P>
He went on to say that from the 17th century to the 20th century,
liberalism has asked people to look inward and free their spirits
from bondage, while demanding freedoms of speech, thought and
publication from the government.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, when all these freedoms are guaranteed by the
Constitution of the People's Republic of China, who needs liberalism?
"I would rather choose the Constitution than liberalism," he added.
</P>
<P>
The speech at Fudan University was Li's third and final one
during his weeklong tour of China. Last week he visited Beijing and
spoke to students and faculty at Peking University and Tsinghua
University.

TAIWANESE, JAPANESE MEDICAL EQUIPMENT INSTITUTES FORGE TIES
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Sept. 26 (CNA)
(By Elizabeth Hsu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Biomedical Engineering Center (BMEC)
of the Industrial Technology Research Institute signed a memorandum
of cooperation with the Japan Association for the Advancement of
Medical Equipment (JAAME) Monday to gain knowledge of Japan's
management and regulations on medical equipment trading.
</P>
<P>
BMEC Director-General Michael Su and JAAME President Keiju
Hasegawa signed for the alliance with Liao Chi-chou, head of the
Department of Health (DOH) Bureau of Pharmaceutical Affairs, also in
attendance. The cooperation is expected to help boost exchanges
between Taiwan and Japan in terms of medical equipment trading
regulations as the DOH has been working to help local manufacturers
in the medical equipment industry open overseas markets, Liao said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that thanks to similar cooperative relations with the
United States and the European Union, forged in 1998 and 2001, Taiwan
was able to accelerate its implementation of a mechanism to check
exports of medical equipment. The BMEC was commissioned to assist
local businesses to equip themselves with knowledge of Japanese
regulations and procedure about marketing medical equipment in Japan.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan's production value of medical equipment has seen
double-digit growth in the past few years, amounting to NT$50.4
billion (US$1.5 billion) in 2004, up 24 percent from the previous
year, Su said.
</P>
<P>
In 2004, Taiwan's total medical equipment exports reached NT$27.6
billion, with most of the exports shipped to the U.S. and those
shipped to Japan worth only NT$2.5 billion, Su added.
</P>
<P>
Noting that there is around US$19.7 billion worth of domestic
demand for medical equipment in Japan, Su said that he hopes via the
cooperation with the JAAME, a door could be opened for Taiwanese
manufacturers to make inroad into the neighboring market.
</P>
<P>
According to Hasegawa, the JAAME, which was established around 20
years ago, is one of Japan's Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare's
designated institution to take charge of work in research,
development, manufacturing, export/import, marketing and information
collection, and certification of medical machines and equipment.

LEGISLATURE CAN MONITOR USE OF OVERSEAS 'PROSPERITY FUND': MOFA
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Sept.  26 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Vice Foreign Affairs Minister Michael
Ying-mao Kau said Monday the Legislative Yuan has a right to monitor
the use of money for a proposed project to assist the Republic of
China's allies in Central and Southern America.
</P>
<P>
Kau's remarks came in the wake of an announcement by President
Chen Shui-bian, who is currently on a five-nation official tour of
Central American and the Caribbean diplomatic allies, in Guatemala
Thursday that the government will set up a special fund of US$250
million for a "co-prosperity" project.
</P>
<P>
The project, with money coming from the Ministry of Foreign
Affairs' (MOFA) International Cooperation and Development Fund and
the Executive Yuan's Development Fund, is aimed at assisting Taiwan
businessmen to invest in Central America and the Caribbean and
cementing Taiwan's diplomatic ties with countries in the region, the
president said.
</P>
<P>
Vice Premier Wu Rong-i, who is accompanying President Chen, then
told the media that related expenditures of the project can go
without being screened by the Legislative Yuan, and that the
legislature can monitor the use afterwards.
</P>
<P>
Wu's words drew the ire of opposition legislators who grilled
Kau on this point when the latter was invited to report to the
Legislative Yuan's Foreign Committee on the creative approach to
promoting Taiwan's bid to join the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
Kau said that the opposition legislators and the private sector
might misunderstand the project and that the problem might be due to
poor communication between government agencies.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the project has been in the works for more than
several months, and it has not been "hastily" unveiled as reported by
the media.
</P>
<P>
As far as he is concerned, "The Legislative Yuan will have the
right to monitor the use of the fund."
</P>
<P>
Opposition legislators said Wu's words were "inappropriate, "
believing that the government wants to evade legislative monitoring
and threatened to cut the budget altogether.
</P>
<P>
Legislators Lai Shyh-bao from the Kuomintang and Daniel Hwang
from the People First Party said that the government has announced
the project in Guatemala even when Taiwan's economy and jobless
situation have yet to see improvement.
</P>
<P>
Though the president denied that the program was "dollar
diplomacy, " and termed it "investment diplomacy, " they questioned
whether the investment in the region will help Taiwan businessmen to
reach out globally.
</P>
<P>
However, ruling Democratic Progressive Party Legislator Hsiao
Bi-khim didn't see eye to eye with them.
</P>
<P>
She was positive about the ministry's creative approach in
promoting diplomacy, saying that it will help Taiwan businessmen
reach out to the world and could promote development in the allies,
creating a win-win situation in this way.

medium-range missiles target Japan, and more than 30 long-range

education on national consciousness has to start early.

Central Election Commission Chairman Chang
Cheng-hsiung said Monday that the commission has not yet started to
study the question of whether or not to hold the next presidential
election on the same day as the legislative elections.
</P>
<P>
Chang was replying to Kuomintang Legislator Lin Hung-chih at the
Legislative Yuan's home affairs committee.
</P>
<P>
He said the next legislature will be sworn in on Feb. 1, 2008,
while the next president will take the oath of office on May 20,
2008. The current schedules show that the next legislative elections
will be held in Dec. 2007 and the next presidential election on March
20, 2008.
</P>
<P>
If the two elections are to be held simultaneously, Chang said,
then the election day for the president and vice president must be
moved ahead.
</P>
<P>
This is a controversial issue on which the CEC will not take any
stand, he added.
</P>
<P>
In a report to the committee, Chang said the re-zoning of
legislative constituencies is scheduled to be completed by September
2006 and the new constituencies will be promulgated by the end of
November 2006.
</P>
<P>
The redrawing of constituencies was necessitated by a
constitutional amendment that changed the electoral system for the
legislature, so that starting from the seventh Legislative Yuan to be
elected in 2007, the Yuan will have only 113 members for four-year
terms of office, about half of the current 225.
</P>
<P>
Of that total, 73 seats will be elected from regional districts,
six from aboriginal communities, and the other 34 reserved for
at-large and overseas expatriate representatives chosen in accordance
with the percentage of votes each political party garners.
</P>
<P>
Chang promised that the re-zoning will be done in an independent,
supra-partisan and fair manner.

WINERY DESTROYS 4,000 LITERS OF CONTAMINATED GRAPE JUICE

<TEXT>
<P>
The Nantou fruit
winery of the Taiwan Tobacco and Liquor Corp. poured 4,000 liters of
contaminated grape juice down the drain Monday under the supervision
of sanitation workers and officials from the Environmental Protection
Administration.
</P>
<P>
Tests done by technicians at the winery following a standard
procedure showed that the juice contained residue of two pesticides
-- dithiocarbamates and carbofuran -- that exceeded the legally
allowed limits.
</P>
<P>
According to a spokesman for the winery, the juice was from 6,440
kg of grapes bought from two farms that had probably harvested their
crops a few days too early in an attempt to avoid losses from a
typhoon. The waste represented only 0.5 percent of the grapes
purchased by the winery this year.
</P>
<P>
The two farms that sold the contaminated grapes will have to
absorb their own losses, he said, adding that experts at the winery
will continue to follow strict quality control procedures to protect
consumers.
</P>
<P>
The 4,000 liters of grape juice, weighing about six metric tons,
was released into the winery's drainage system and diluted with
water. It will take about three days for the winery's waste water
plant to process the contaminated liquid before it can be released
into the county's sewage system, the spokesman said.

With well-developed wafer and
semiconductor industries, Taiwan has great promise in solar energy
development, the chief executive officer of Taiwan's leading
crystalline silicon solar cell manufacturing company said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking in an interview with CNA, Motech Industries Inc.
President Leo Cheng said he urged the government to invest more in
solar energy research when his company began investing in the field
seven years ago.
</P>
<P>
"Taiwan is very suitable for solar power development because it
has the world's best wafer fabrication plants and a large number of
skilled engineers. With this precious asset, I see no other country
better equipped than Taiwan to develop solar energy," Cheng said.
</P>
<P>
In the past two years, Cheng said, more and more local companies
have got involved in solar energy development, enhancing the
possibility of forming a comprehensive industry supply chain.
</P>
<P>
"So long as we can develop a complete supply chain, the solar
energy industry will become yet another of Taiwan's star industries
like the electronics industry," Cheng said.
</P>
<P>
Motech Industries Inc., founded in 1981 and formerly known as
Meter International Corp., is a leading Taiwanese manufacturer
specializing in high-end test and measurement instruments. Over the
past 20 years, Motech Industries has expanded its product base to
become one of the most reputable test and measurement manufacturers
in Taiwan, with a growing international presence.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, Motech received permission to set up its Solar
Electricity Division (Motech Solar) in the South Taiwan Science Park.
</P>
<P>
Motech Solar is Taiwan's first manufacturer specializing in the
production of crystalline silicon solar cells.
</P>
<P>
Its main products include multi- and mono-crystalline silicon
solar cells with dimensions of 125mm x 125mm and 156mm x 156mm.
</P>
<P>
Cheng said Motech Solar plans to further expand its production
capacity by the end of 2005.
</P>
<P>
Motech Solar has also started a pilot production line for wafer
slicing to reduce cost and increase the supply of silicon wafers,
Cheng said.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Cheng went on, Motech Solar plans to begin the
construction of a second factory building for future expansion in
solar wafer and cell manufacturing.
</P>
<P>
"One of our goals is to become the lowest-cost solar cell
manufacturer in the world," Cheng said.
</P>
<P>
With the Kyoto Protocol taking effect and crude oil prices
skyrocketing, Cheng said there is a resurgence of interest in solar
energy. As a result, upstream solar energy materials have been in
short supply and he predicted that investment in upstream solar
energy materials production will reap certain dividends.
</P>
<P>
He urged the government to invest more in solar energy research
and provide incentives to encourage private investment in the field
so that Taiwan can develop a complete solar energy supply chain soon.
Cheng further said his company is expected to rank among the world's
top five solar energy firms by 2008.

KAOHSIUNG'S NEW ACTING MAYOR BETTING HER CREDIBILITY ON NEW JOB
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Kaohsiung,  Sept.  26 (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Yeh Chu-lan, who became Kaohsiung
City's acting mayor Monday, said she was betting all her political
credibility on regaining public confidence in the city government
that has become mired in a mass rapid transit (MRT) construction
scandal.
</P>
<P>
During an exclusive interview with CNA, the former transport and
communications minister said she agreed to take the job because she
could not bear to see what she described as the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party's (DPP's) "cohesive power" disintegrating as a
result of the MRT fiasco.
</P>
<P>
She replaced Chen Chi-mai, who resigned to take political
responsibility over the human rights controversy that came to light
following a riot by Thai workers on Aug. 21 in protest over their
poor living conditions and maltreatment by a management company
contracted by the Kaohsiung Rapid Transit Corp. (KRTC).
</P>
<P>
Ye said she will bring in two deputy mayors and an engineering
expert to regain the public's confidence in the city government's
ability to build the rapid transit system and to run the city well.
</P>
<P>
Tang Chin-chih, a law expert, was invited to be deputy mayor
along with Cheng Wen-lung, an engineer. The two will be joined by
railway expert Liao Ching-lung to review the building contracts, and
hopefully they will bring an end to the MRT controversy, Yeh said.
</P>
<P>
As the MRT scandal is related to the city's decision to build the
system under the build, operate, transfer (BOT) model, she described
the BOT model as a good way of encouraging private investment in
public projects and said it will be adopted for more city projects.
</P>
<P>
"Public confidence can be regained only if the BOT projects are
implemented in due process by people with credibility and as long as
no major errors occur," she added.
</P>
<P>
She reiterated her lack of interest in running for a formal
mayoral term after her tenure as acting mayor expires late next year.
</P>
<P>
What she plans to achieve is to rekindle people's confidence in
the DPP's core values, she said without elaborating.
</P>
<P>
On a practical level, Yeh said she will promote more female
executives in the city government and focus on improving social
welfare for the less privileged, as well as for women and children.
</P>
<P>
As the nation's first female mayor of a metropolitan city and a
member of the Hakka community, she said she will see to it that a
Hakka community in Tsoying gets all the benefits to which it is
eligible, including construction of public facilities.
</P>
<P>
Yeh said she will also carry on city development plans drawn up
by former mayors Frank Hsieh and Chen Chi-mai that make use of the
area's sea, ports, mountains and rivers to make the city a "shining,
comfortable, safe and beautiful place."
</P>
<P>
She said she also plans to market Kaohsiung's local
characteristics as tourist attractions in an effort to improve the
local economy.
</P>
<P>
Yeh was a senior adviser to the president, and before that, she
served as the nation's first female deputy premier, transportation
minister, and National Assembly speaker.

NOTED PSYCHIATRIST COMMITS SUICIDE

<TEXT>
<P>
A noted psychiatrist who gained fame for
having treated a number of celebrities was found dead in his clinic
in Taipei Monday in what police described as an apparent suicide.
</P>
<P>
Forensic doctors said Chen Kuo-hua, 35, apparently killed himself
by burning charcoal in his clinic. Police were still trying to find
out his motive for ending his own life.
</P>
<P>
Chen, who ran the Beautifulmind Clinic after working in several
hospitals in Taipei, wrote in a book that he was twice troubled by
depression, which he said was why he chose to become a psychiatrist.
</P>
<P>
Chen's former colleagues said he apparently carried too heavy a
mental burden and did not know to whom to turn for help.
</P>
<P>
Chou Yuan-hua, a psychiatrist at the Veterans General Hospital in
Taipei, quoted a study in the United States showing that doctors are
a high-risk group in terms of the tendency to commit suicide, and
that psychiatrists belong to an even higher-risk subgroup within this
already high-risk group.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that psychiatrists, like anyone else, can suffer
from emotional problems and become mentally disturbed.

TAIWAN COMPANY DEVELOPS WORLD'S LARGEST LCD TV PANEL
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei, Sept. 26 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Chi Mei Optoelectronics Corporation (CMO),
one the world's top three LCD TV panel suppliers, announced at its
Tainan headquarters Monday that it has successfully developed the
world's first 56-inch LCD TV panel.
</P>
<P>
With 8.29 million pixels and a resolution of 3840 x 2160 -- four
times that of the currently available products -- the panel features
the highest resolution ever achieved in the world, according to CMO
officials.
</P>
<P>
The new panel consists of over 24.8 million transistors, with a
data transmission speed of over 1.4 gigabytes per second.
</P>
<P>
In order to achieve the result, the officials said the CMO
research and development team had to overcome a number of significant
technical challenges, including the development of special new driver
methods and scanning procedures.
</P>
<P>
The LCD panel manufacturer said the new panel also boasts the
largest display size among similar products ever developed by Taiwan
LCD makers.
</P>
<P>
Describing the panel as a milestone in global display
development, CMO President Ho Jau-yang said the technical challenges
were not only in developing a large sized LCD panel, but also in
developing the four-fold increase in screen resolution.
</P>
<P>
The company said the panels can be applied to a number of
high-end applications. They will be perfect for ultra high-end
multifunction home entertainment systems and for connection to
high quality digital still and video cameras.
</P>
<P>
They can also be applied to high-end specialty uses for
high-resolution graphic displays such as in medical video cameras or
satellite picture displays, according to the CMO.

EXECUTIVE YUAN CALLS TWO OPPOSITION-INITIATED BILLS UNCONSTITUTIONAL
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,    Sept.   26   (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An opposition-initiated cross
Taiwan-Strait peace promotion bill and a national communications
commission bill are unconstitutional, Executive Yuan
Secretary-General Cho Jung-tai claimed Monday.
</P>
<P>
One day before the opposition in the Legislative Yuan is set to
railroad the two bills through the legislature, Cho said the
peace-promotion bill would usurp the president's constitutional
rights, while the organic bill of the national communications
commission will breach the Basic Organic Law of Central Executive
Agencies and contradict the principle of keeping the media free from
political influence.
</P>
<P>
He warned the opposition parties -- mainly the Kuomintang (KMT)
(KMT) and the People First Party (PFP), which between them control a
slim majority in the legislature -- not to trample on the
Constitution and law by abusing their majority to steamroller the two
controversial bills through.
</P>
<P>
Cho branded the PFP-initiated peace-promotion bill a political
struggle in disguise because it would take away the president's power
and give it to a peace-promoting commission, which would trigger
another round of constitutional fighting between the president and
the legislature.
</P>
<P>
He was referring to provisions in the bill that provide for the
formation of a peace-promotion commission with the power to negotiate
with China on the establishment of a military mutual-trust mechanism,
a free trade zone and the opening of direct cross-strait transport
links. These powers, the Executive Yuan claims, are reserved by the
Constitution for the president or the executive branch and cannot be
taken away with an ordinary law.
</P>
<P>
As to the organic bill of national communications commission, Cho
said the controversy centers on the lineup of the commission members.
</P>
<P>
In the bill crafted by the opposition, the commission members
should be named by political parties in proportion to the number of
seats they hold in the legislature to prevent the ruling party from
packing it with its own supporters, but the administration formed by
the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) opposes it for exactly
the same reason -- to ensure the proposed commission's independence
from political influence.
</P>
<P>
Cho said the DPP would engage in a last-ditch negotiation with
the two opposition parties Tuesday morning in the hope that they will
give up the attempts to put the two bills to a vote. 
</P>
<P>
Negotiations between the two sides broke down ealier in the day.
The KMT and the PFP vowed to call for a vote the following day on the
two controversial bills, which have already been on the shelf for
four months because of the impasse and thereby are technically
eligible for a settlement by vote.
</P>
<P>
Both the ruling and opposition parties called on their party
lawmakers to turn out Tuesday for a possible showdown.

Managua,   Sept.  25  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Republic of China President Chen
Shui-bian was decorated by his Nicaraguan counterpart Sunday for his
contributions to promoting bilateral cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Nicaraguan President Enrique Bolanos bestowed upon Chen the Orden
de Ruben Dario en el Grado de Gran Cruz con Placa de Plata, the
highest honor presented by Nicaragua to foreign dignitaries, in
appreciation for Chen's assistance in promoting Nicaragua's economic
development and upgrading bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
Chen arrived in the Nicaraguan capital of Managua from the
Dominican Republic earlier in the day for a three-day state visit,
during which he will attend a summit meeting with his counterparts
from the nation's allies in Central America and the Caribbean.
</P>
<P>
After the decoration ceremony, Bolanos hosted a dinner in honor
of Chen and his entourage.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the occasion, Chen praised Bolanos for his efforts to
wipe out official corruption, boost national development, reduce
foreign debt and promote inter-party reconciliation and dialogue.
</P>
<P>
"We admire the 'Nicaraguan spirit' in taking up challenges and
overcoming difficulties in pursuit of national growth and strength, "
Chen said.
</P>
<P>
Noting that commercial and cultural exchanges between Taiwan and
Nicaragua have been growing in recent years, Chen said he is
convinced that more Taiwan companies will invest in Nicaragua after
the two countries sign a free trade agreement in the near future.
</P>
<P>
The two countries began negotiations for a free trade pact in
August 2004 when then-ROC Premier Yu Shyi-kun made an official visit
to Nicaragua. Chen said he hopes negotiations can be finalized as
early as possible for the mutual benefit of both sides.
</P>
<P>
The fifth ROC-Central America summit meeting will take place in
Managua Monday, with the participation of Chen and his counterparts
from El Salvador, Honduras and Nicaragua, as well as the Belize prime
minister and vice presidents or ministers from Panama, the Dominican
Republic and Costa Rica and the secretary-general of the System of
Central American Integration.
</P>
<P>
Panama President Martin Torrijos will fly to Managua to meet with
Chen Monday. Because of his tight schedule, Torrijos cannot attend
the summit meeting.
</P>
<P>
Nicaragua is the third leg of Chen's five-nation diplomatic tour
that has already taken him to Guatemala and the Dominican Republic.

Washington-based group promoting international support for Taiwan's
cause which is in charge of Lee's itinerary while in Washington, has
also arranged for him to give a brief speech at a luncheon on Capitol
Hill,

SCHOOL TEACHERS FACE HIGH LEVELS OF STRESS, DEPRESSION: SURVEY
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Sept. 27 (CNA)
(By Elizabeth Hsu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Some 71 percent of middle and elementary
school teachers have a high stress index, while 52 percent have a
high depression index, according to the results of a survey by the
private King Car Education Foundation.
</P>
<P>
According to the survey carried out Sept. 1-25 on 1,600 teachers
at 26 middle and elementary schools around Taiwan, the main reasons
many teachers are so unhappy are being bound by an uncertain
education policy, carrying heavy administrative burdens, and having
too little time to prepare for classes.
</P>
<P>
However, despite the gloominess, 76 percent of the respondents
said they would like to have a permanent career in education.
</P>
<P>
The survey also found that 62 percent of the respondents are
worried about being transferred to other positions or schools as
student numbers drop due to low birth rates.
</P>
<P>
The poll showed that 96 percent of respondents don't feel the
existing education policy can free students from heavy academic
burdens, and 69 percent believe the existing policy fails to
adequately equip students with the skills necessary to enter society
in the future.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, 81 percent said they believe the education reforms
underway islandwide will result in a widening gap between rich and
poor, while 76 percent complained that the views of basic-level
teachers were not sufficiently taken into account in developing the
reform policies.
</P>
<P>
In terms of education content, 98 percent said students most need
instruction in morality and ethics, while 75 percent mentioned the
need for life education, and 45 percent pointed to the need for more
instruction in environmental protection. Many of the teachers
surveyed also suggested the promotion of holistic education and
encouraged parents to learn along with their kids.
</P>
<P>
Many of the teachers said they believe parents have the greatest
influence on their students' thoughts and behavior, followed by
peers, and the mass media. The influence of teachers was ranked
fourth, ahead of the Internet, according to the survey.

ROC PRESIDENT ANNOUNCES 'CO-PROSPERITY PROJECT' IN NICARAGUA
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Managua,   Sept.  26  (CNA)
(By S.J. Tsai and P.C.Tang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Republic of China President Chen
Shui-bian announced Tuesday in Managua, Nicaragua the "co-prosperity
project" to open up a new era of economic, trade and investment
cooperation between Taiwan and its diplomatic allies in Central
America and the Caribbean.
</P>
<P>
The president made the announcement while attending the 5th
ROC-Central America Summit which is currently being held in the
capital of Nicaragua.
</P>
<P>
According to the project, Taiwan will set up a fund of US$250
million to help develop the economies of its diplomatic allies in the
region.
</P>
<P>
The president said that the current meeting between the ROC and
Central American countries' heads of state has "taken on new
significance related to democratic, economic and trade development,
as well as sustainable peace, and honorable friendship among the
allies."
</P>
<P>
Pointing out that there is no perfect democratic system in the
world but only determination in pursuing a perfect democracy, the
president said that Taiwan has already put "democratic values" into
practice by a "peaceful transfer" of power between political parties
in 2000 and that the 23 million people of Taiwan also elected him to
continue to lead the country as well as held the first referendum in
Chinese society in 2004 to express their opposition to war and desire
for peace.
</P>
<P>
Chen also reiterated his wishes announced at the beginning of
this year to open up a new era of political consultation and dialogue
for the country, promising that he will continue to push
constitutional reform in order to give the people an appropriate,
useful and suitable new Constitution as " this is a plan of
institutional reform to further the island's democratization."
</P>
<P>
"A mature, progressive and untarnished "democracy of Taiwan" is a
"kinetic energy" that can not only reinforce the international
democratic community, but can also serve as a medium to connect
democratic systems in Central and South America, he further said.
</P>
<P>
Noting that without democracy, people will not treasure peace,
the president said that many people consider that cross-strait
relations are too complicated, but the substantive problem of such
relations is democratic differences between the two sides of the
strait.
</P>
<P>
"Taiwan is a free and democratic country, while China is a
country without democracy, human rights and freedom; Democratic
Taiwan symbolizes a transparency of the decision-making process and a
well-monitored policy by the people, " he said, adding that "China,
which lacks a public monitored system and a transparent policy, faces
the risk of making wrong decisions which might also endanger peaceful
development."
</P>
<P>
Therefore, the president called for the international community
to adopt active and appropriate measures to resolve the
representation problem of the 23 million people of Taiwan in
international organizations and to help rebuild durable peace between
the two sides of the strait.
</P>
<P>
Democratic progress and economic prosperity must go hand in hand
with peaceful dialogue and sincere negotiations, he continued, adding
that any military buildup and intimidation will be harmful to
regional peace and security.
</P>
<P>
Claiming that the Taiwanese people are peace-loving and
supporters of democracy, the president said that they deserve to be
treated with dignity by the international community and to have
security as "the island is a world citizen and a messenger of peace."
</P>
<P>
The president also urged the international community to
cautiously deal with the matters related to the rise of China, saying
that at a time when many countries have been lured by China's huge
market, they should pay proper heed to Beijing's recent passage of an
anti-secession law which he said poses a grave threat to Taiwan as it
legitimizes the use of "non-peaceful" means to resolve problems in
the strait.
</P>
<P>
He also urged the international community to pay attention to the
potential uncertainty that might occur during the process of China's
rise.
</P>
<P>
Stressing that nobody would like to see the collapse of China as
the international community could not bear the huge burden of such a
collapse, Chen said that in order for China to become a "positive
force" in the international community during the process of its
development, the rise of China must be accompanied by a "peaceful
awakening" and "democratic progress."
</P>
<P>
"If China can follow the international rules to develop its
democracy and sincerely accept peace, it will set an example for
those remnant forces existing in the dark places, " he added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the president also said that if the Central American
free trade agreement (FTA) and that between the Dominican Republic
and the United States can take effect as scheduled, and if such
agreements can combine with the ROC-Panama FTA and the ROC-Guatemala
FTA as well as similar agreements that will be signed between Taiwan
and other Central American countries, a complete regional economic
and trade platform will be built in the future to help bring
international investment, including investment from Taiwan, into
Central and South America and the Caribbean as well as create a
multilateral win-win situation for Taiwan and the countries in the
region.
</P>
<P>
In response to Chen's appeal, Nicaraguan President Enrique
Bolanos Geyer said while addressing the meeting that his government
will continue to support Taiwan's bid to join international
organizations, including the United Nations and the World Health
Organization.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Republic of China President Chen
Shui-bian said while meeting with his Panamanian counterpart that
future cooperation between the two countries will be focused on
investment and trade.
</P>
<P>
Chen is currently on a visit to the Nicaraguan capital of Managua
to attend the 5th ROC-Central America Summit with the participation
of the heads of state of five countries in the region, including
Belize, El Salvador, Honduras, Nicaragua and Panama.
</P>
<P>
According to Huang Chih-fang, vice secretary-general of the
Presidential Office, Chen thanked Panamanian President Martin Torrijo
Espino during the meeting for what he has done to enhance relations
between the two countries, pointing to Torrijo's earlier decision to
send a minister to visit Taiwan on Sept. 9 to discuss with him the
future strengthening of bilateral economic and trade relations.
</P>
<P>
The ROC's head of state also expressed his gratitude for his
Panamanian counterpart's decision to take part in the summit.
Torrijo, who had not planned to attend the meeting, changed his mind
after meeting with Chen.
</P>
<P>
Pointing out that the free trade agreement signed between Taiwan
and Panama has provided both countries with huge investment
opportunities, Chen said that the "co-prosperity project" is aimed at
increasing the island's investment in Central America.
</P>
<P>
The project, which was announced by Chen at the summit, will set
up a fund of US$250 million to help push economic, trade and
investment cooperation between Taiwan and its diplomatic allies in
Central America and the Caribbean.
</P>
<P>
Saying that future cooperation between Taiwan and Panama will be
centered on investment and trade, the ROC president promised that "he
will pay much attention to these areas and oversee them."
</P>
<P>
In response, Torrijo said that the Taiwan-Panama FTA is the first
ever agreement of its kind signed between his country and another
country, expressing the hope that it can set an example to
practically promote economic and trade relations between the two
countries and help increase sales of Panamanian agricultural products
to Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Chen reiterated during his bilateral meeting with
Honduran President Ricardo Maduro that the "co-prosperity project" is
abrand-new idea of Taiwan's diplomacy, which is aimed at encouraging
the island's state-run and private enterprises to invest in countries
in Central America and the Caribbean.
</P>
<P>
Praising the idea as "very good creativity, " Maduro said that he
hopes the two countries can further develop their economic, trade and

TAIWAN ON PAR WITH U.S. IN KIDNEY, LIVER TRANSPLANT SURVIVAL RATES
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei, Sept.  27 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taiwan can compete with the United States
in terms of kidney and liver transplant survival rates, but it still
has room for progress in heart and lung transplant operations, the
Bureau of National Health Insurance (BNHI) said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
According to BNHI tallies, the bureau paid about NT$900 million
for 1,352 organ transplants between 2001 and 2004, of which 686 or 51
percent were kidney transplants, 402 or 30 percent were liver
transplants, 212 or 16 percent were heart transplants and the
remaining 52 or 3 percent were lung transplants.
</P>
<P>
The BNHI report showed that Taiwan kidney transplant patients'
three-month survival rate was on average 98 percent; the one-year
survival rate was 96 percent, and the three-year survival rate was 92
percent.
</P>
<P>
Compared with figures posted on the U.S.-based United Network for
Organ Sharing, BNHI officials said Taiwan was on a par with the
United States in terms of kidney transplant patients' survival rates.
</P>
<P>
On liver transplants, Taiwan patients' average three-month
survival rate was 91 percent, compared to 88 percent for the one-year
survival rate and 84 percent for the three-year survival rate. The
levels were also compatible with U.S. rates and Taiwan even outpaced
the United States in terms of liver transplant patients' three-year
survival rate.
</P>
<P>
As for heart transplants, Taiwan's average three-month survival
rate was 80 percent, one-year survival rate was 79 percent and
three-year survival rate was 66 percent. While the three-month and
one-year survival rates were roughly the same as the U.S. level,
Taiwan was still behind the U.S. in the three-year survival rate.
</P>
<P>
Regarding lung transplants, Taiwan patients' average three-month
survival rate was 58 percent, one-year survival rate was 40 percent
and three-year survival rate was only 19 percent, which was less than
half of the U.S. level.

TAIWAN HOPES TO SIGN FTA WITH All CENTRAL AMERICAN ALLIES: CHEN
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Managua, Nicaragua, Sept. 26 (CNA)
(By S. J. Tsai and Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Republic of China hopes to
sign a free trade agreement (FTA) with each of the members of the
System of Central American Integration (SICA) as soon as possible,
President Chen Shui-bian said in Managua Monday.
</P>
<P>
Chen attended the fifth ROC-Central America summit meeting Monday
along with Nicaraguan President Enrique Bolanos, Belize Prime
Minister Said Musa, El Salvador President Elias Antonio Saca
Gonzalez, Honduras President Ricardo Maduro, and Panama President
Martin Torrijos.
</P>
<P>
A joint communique was signed at the conclusion of the event, but
the leaders of Panama and Honduras left early, and President Chen and
the three remaining leaders signed the communique after the meeting.
The SICA, launched in Feb. 1993, is comprised of Guatemala, Honduras,
El Salvador, Nicaragua, Costa Rica and Panama, all of them diplomatic
allies of the ROC.
</P>
<P>
The communique reaffirmed support for the ROC's bid to join the
United Nations, the World Health Organization and other major
international organizations and forums.
</P>
<P>
The attending leaders were upbeat about Taiwan's democratic and
economic achievements, and they stressed the importance of peace and
security in the Taiwan Strait, urging both sides to solve their
differences through dialogue.
</P>
<P>
The communique also said that the ROC hopes to sign FTAs with the
SICA countries, and to make good use of Central America's potential
given that the Central American Free Trade Agreement was signed with
the United States.
</P>
<P>
The ROC government has already set up an inter-governmental
agency team to promote public and private businesses to invest in
Central America's traditional, hi-tech and strategic sectors to help
economic development and increase employment to strengthen the
integration of the SICA.
</P>
<P>
The communique also said that the ROC government is willing to
help the SICA to promote tourism from Taiwan and related investments,
and continue to promote a "Taiwan scholarship" program to help
nurture talented people.
</P>
<P>
In a news conference after the signing of the communique,
President Chen said that he and the heads of the state of the Central
American allies are like brothers in a big family and that many of
them had come to the meeting despite their tight schedules.
</P>
<P>
"Like the Mid-Autumn Festival and the Chinese New Year in Taiwan,
everyone returns for a family reunion no matter how busy they are, "
the president said.
</P>
<P>
He said that Honduras President Maduro originally told him that
he would visit Taiwan in October, and asked if attending the meeting
was imperative, but after hearing the way Chen had spoken of the
coalition, Maduro decided to attend.
</P>
<P>
Torrijos also said over the phone that he would come to Managua
for a meeting with Chen, the president said.
</P>
<P>
President Chen said that he wanted to tell his friends in Taiwan
that a person has to "work hard for diplomacy as well as friendship."
</P>
<P>
El Salvador President Musa said that President Chen was affable,
and he has good official and personal relations with him, and the
first ladies of the two countries are also close.
</P>
<P>
Musa also said that President Chen, like him, was diminutive, but
has big heart, and can be called "little big man," lauding Chen as a
man of strong convictions and courage and an outstanding national
leader of vision.

NEARLY HALF OF TEACHERS WANT TO HAVE THEIR KIDS STUDY ABROAD: SURVEY
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Sept. 27 (CNA)
(By Elizabeth Hsu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Local schools may be good enough for most
people in Taiwan, but almost half of all elementary through high
school teachers in Taipei responding to a recent survey are
considering sending their children abroad for their education,
pollsters said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
In mid-September, the opposition People First Party (PFP) caucus
at the Taipei City Council sent questionnaires to 828 teachers
randomly chosen from the city's 20,000-plus elementary through high
school teachers to explore their views on the domestic education
environment. A total of 773 valid samples or 93 percent were
collected.
</P>
<P>
Of the roughly 46 percent who said they have thought about
sending their kids abroad for study, 56 percent pointed to the need
to improve their children's competitiveness, while 30 percent thought
that the education policy in Taiwan was poor, with 15 percent saying
that their children are under too much stress trying to make grades
high enough to allow them to enter better schools in the future.
</P>
<P>
About 52 percent said that they would like to sent their kids to
the United States or Canada for schooling, while 26 percent chose
countries in Europe, 12 percent preferred New Zealand and Australia,
and 11 percent took China into consideration, according to the poll.
</P>
<P>
Huang Yiu-chung, a PFP whip at the caucus, said Tuesday that they
found through the survey that 71 percent of the teachers are not
satisfied with the existing education policy, while 67 percent are
worry about a worsening domestic educational environment in the near

RULING, OPPOSITION PARTIES DENOUNCE EACH OTHER AFTER NCC SCUFFLE
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Sept.  27 (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ruling and opposition party caucuses
denounced each other following a scuffle on the legislative floor
triggered by the opposition's insistence on putting to a vote the
draft organic law of the National Communications Commission (NCC)
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Lawmakers from the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) and
its "pan- green" camp ally, the Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU), ran a
gauntlet to commandeer the podium, the speaker's quarters and the
central part of the meeting hall to block Kuomintang (KMT) and People
First Party (PFP) legislators from speaking.
</P>
<P>
About 20 "pan-green" camp lawmakers grabbed Legislative Yuan
President Wang Jin-pyng's microphone and gavel, pounding his table
with books and the gavel while shouting, "Dissolve the legislature,
replace the speaker!"
</P>
<P>
As the stand-off went on, KMT Legislator Hung Hsiu-chu shouted
"Party of violence!" at DPP legislators, triggering a wave of blasts
from bullhorns that both sides had prepared in violation of their own
agreement, according to Wang, who said that if the vote couldn't take
place in the afternoon, he would call off the meeting.
</P>
<P>
As the "pan-green" camp lawmakers occupied the speaker's
quarters, other DPP lawmakers such as Chang Hua-kuan and Lan Mei-chin
guarded the podium, and TSU lawmakers unfurled a banner that read
"False reform to seize power; KMT-PFP toppling NCC, media future
bleak."
</P>
<P>
As the "pan-green" lawmakers formed three cordons of defense
against "pan- blue alliance" members who might seize an opportunity
to speak from the podium, a second wave of clashes occurred at the
other side of the legislative floor.
</P>
<P>
At a news conference immediately after the turmoil, KMT caucus
Secretary- General Cho Po-yuan accused DPP Legislator Chuang Ho-tzu
of attacking KMT Legislator Liao Wan-ju in the back, and PFP
legislators Hsieh Kuo-liang and Sun Ta-chien were also roughed up by
DPP lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
Chuang and Liao later sought medical attention -- Chuang was sent
to National Taiwan University Hospital, and Liao was treated at the
Legislative Yuan's medical service center for an injury to her face.
</P>
<P>
The KMT and PFP caucuses jointly denounced the "pan-green" camp's
"violent filibustering" of the meeting, declaring that they
"definitely will pass the NCC organic law within the day." The
"pan-blue alliance" enjoys a majority at the legislature.
</P>
<P>
PFP Legislator Lee Yung-ping, who was unable to speak on the
legislative floor as she was pushed off the podium, said the DPP was
boycotting the NCC bill in an attempt to safeguard underground radio
stations that will serve as the DPP's propaganda machines during the
year-end county, city and town elections.
</P>
<P>
Chao Yung-ching, DPP caucus convener, accused the major
opposition parties of "forever changing the legislative agenda to
include the draft NCC organic law and the draft law for promoting
cross-Taiwan Strait peace."
</P>
<P>
"If they don't understand what the real public opinion is, people
will certainly pass judgment on then, " Chao said, challenging the
opposition to make a motion to disband the legislature so that the
people will have a chance to reelect it.
</P>
<P>
On the NCC bill, Chao said the KMT and PFP insisted on adopting
their version that will protect KMT-owned electronic media and
enfeeble the NCC as an independent institution.
</P>
<P>
He said he had urged his colleagues to avoid physical scuffles
and express their views in a rational manner. He also expressed the
hope that both the ruling and opposition parties will sit down to
negotiate a settlement of their differences about the NCC structure.
</P>
<P>
The "pan-blue alliance" wants the new organization to be formed
by members appointed in accordance with political party seats at the
legislature, and the "pan-green" camp opposed this as an "outdated"
idea that will deprive the NCC of its professionalism and
independence.
</P>
<P>
Besides, according to DPP caucus Secretary-General William C.T.
Lai, the KMT and PFP slipped into their draft version a clause that
will protect the future operations of KMT-owned China Television
Company; if passed, the law will set back the nation's efforts to
force political parties, the military and political powers to leave
the media alone.
</P>
<P>
If the "pan-blue alliance" insists on using their "numerical
violence" to pass the NCC bill, the DPP caucus will suggest that the
Cabinet propose a "reconsideration" by the Legislative Yuan; if that
also fails, the government should request the Council of Grand
Justices to interpret the law according to the Constitution, Lai
said.
</P>
<P>
However, the KMT's Hong Hsiu-chu cited the example of the Chen
Shui-bian government appointing ideologically inclined members to the
Central Election Commission and the Examination Yuan, which she
claimed shows that the ruling camp does not enjoy "a bit of
credibility among the people."
</P>
<P>
The KMT and PFP want the NCC to be staffed according to party
proportions exactly to "get the government's hands off the media, "
she claimed.

TYPHOON LONGWANG MAY AFFECT TAIWAN SUNDAY
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei, Sept.  27 (CNA)
(By Han Nai-kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Typhoon Longwang, the 19th typhoon this
year, has increased its intensity to that of a medium typhoon and it
will be clear in about three days whether it will affect Taiwan, the
Central Weather Bureau (CWB) reported in a forecast Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
According to the CWB report, as of Tuesday afternoon, Typhoon
Longwang's center was located at 21.7 degrees north latitude and 140
degrees east longitude -- about 970 km north-northwest of Guam. Its
150 km radius was moving west-northwest at 18 km per hour, packing
center winds at 120 km per hour.
</P>
<P>
The typhoon is expected to change its direction slightly to
northwest Wednesday, with the speed slowing down to 14 km per hour.
</P>
<P>
It is uncertain yet whether Typhoon Longwang, still 2,100 km from
Taiwan, will affect the island because the high pressure over the
Pacific Ocean is not stable. The situation will be clearer by Friday.
If the typhoon continues to move toward Taiwan, a warning could be
issued Sunday, according to the CWB forecast.

'CO-PROSPERITY' PROJECT TO CREATE 'WIN-WIN-WIN' SITUATION: MOFA
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Sept.  27  (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A project President Chen Shui-bian
unveiled in Nicaragua will create a "triple-win" situation for the
government, the private sector as well as the allies of the Republic
of China, a spokesman of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Michel Lu was referring to an announcement by President Chen
Shui-bian at the fifth ROC-Central America summit meeting in Managua,
Nicaragua, Monday that the government will set up a special fund of
US$250 million for a "co-prosperity" project, envisioning a new
investment cooperation climate between Taiwan and Central America.
</P>
<P>
The project, with money coming from the Ministry of Foreign
Affairs' (MOFA's) International Cooperation and Development Fund and
the Executive Yuan's Development Fund, is aimed at encouraging Taiwan
businessmen to invest in sectors with potential in Central America,
and the ceiling for government investment will be 49 percent.
</P>
<P>
He said that under the program, the proposals will have to
undergo a process of "negotiation and take into consideration whether
they are strong sectors of Taiwan."
</P>
<P>
Lu said the effect of the government's encouragement of Taiwan
businessmen to invest in diplomatic allies or other regions will
hinge on the places, taking Central and South America and the
Caribbean as examples to say that Taiwan businessmen's investments in
the regions stand at US$1.7 billion.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that faced with the trend of globalization and the
launch of the Central America Free Trade Agreement and the expected
formation of the Free Trade Area of the Americas, the business
potential in the region is huge.
</P>
<P>
Lu said that the government must provide necessary incentives to
encourage the private sector to pitch in technology and capital and
the crux of the "co-prosperity" program is based on the same idea,
hoping to help Taiwan businesses reach out to the world, expedite the
transformation of businesses and diversify overseas investment risks.
</P>
<P>
The government will encourage the sectors that Taiwan excel in,
such as the information and textile sectors, to invest, and will
invite the allies to join, which he said will help the allies develop
economically and create job opportunities, and help the allies to
boost trade with the United States through the Central America
Free Trade Agreement and the expected formation of the Free Trade
Area of the Americas.

'PAN-BLUE ALLIANCE' NIXES ARMS PURCHASE BILL FOR 30TH TIME
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Sept.  27 (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Pan-blue alliance" lawmakers of the
Kuomintang (KMT) and the People First Party (PFP) used their majority
to block the government's arms purchase bill from being put on the
legislative agenda for the 30th time Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Also blocked from discussion on the legislative floor were
President Chen Shui-bian's nominations of Control Yuan members and
two bills drafted by the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)
and its " pan-green" camp ally, the Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU) ,
concerning political party assets.
</P>
<P>
After a vote by the Legislative Yuan's Procedure Committee, whose
three conveners are William C.T. Lai (DPP) , Pan Wei-kang (KMT) and
Lin Hui-kuan (PFP), several "pan-blue alliance"-initiated bills were
put on the agenda of the legislature's next meeting.
</P>
<P>
These include the KMT-proposed draft amendment to the law
governing relations between the people in Taiwan and in China. The
amendments will affect direct transportation links between the two
sides of the Strait. Another KMT-proposed bill concerns a revision of
the law governing the organization of the Judicial Yuan.
</P>
<P>
A PFP proposal to legislate a law on flood control was also put
on the legislative agenda to counter the government's similar
proposal for requesting a special budget of NT$80 billion over eight
years for the same purpose. Another PFP-initiated draft bill passed
by the Procedure Committee deals with the Legislative Yuan's exercise
of authority.
</P>
<P>
At the Procedure Committee, KMT and the Non-Partisan Solidarity
Union (NPSU) made a joint proposal to put amendments to the "319
shooting investigative commission" and the organization of the
nation's court system on the meeting agenda for the second reading,
provoking a walkout by DPP lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
DPP Legislator Lin Shu-fen accused the "pan-blue alliance" of
showing contempt for the committee by trying to "smuggle" law bills
and depriving the committee of its normal functions.
</P>
<P>
Hsu Kuo-yung, another DPP lawmaker, agreed with Lin by claiming
that the "pan-blue alliance" act indicates that there is no more need
for the Procedure Committee to exist.
</P>
<P>
"Why not just go ahead and abolish all committees [that are
responsible for screening all law bills]? " he said, demanding that
the KMT face the consequences of its own actions.
</P>
<P>
Huang Shih-cho, a TSU lawmaker, charged that the "pan-blue
alliance" was trying to "seize power with majority violence" when it
tried to ram the National Communications Commission (NCC) organic
bill through the legislature.
</P>
<P>
Wu Yu-sheng, a KMT lawmaker, responded by declaring that there is
only a majority vote, and no so-called "majority violence, " at the
legislature.
</P>
<P>
By saying the opposition was using "majority violence" at the
legislature, the ruling party was actually revealing its compunction
about not following a democratic procedure to allow for a vote, he
said.
</P>
<P>
The "pan-green" camp's obstreperous act of commandeering the
speaker's quarters is obviously evidence of the ruling camp slapping
the face of the lawmaking body, an act that should be denounced by
all, Wu added.

OPTICAL DISC MAKERS MUST EXPAND TO SURVIVE: CMC CEO
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Sept. 27 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Optical drive and disc manufacturers must
expand to survive in view of the ferocious competition in the
industry, the head of a major local optical disc manufacturing
company said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking in an interview with CNA, CMC Magnetics Corp. Chairman
Bob Wong said the optical media industry prospects have improved
thanks to a combination of factors, including smaller players being
kicked out of the market, surviving companies no longer "blindly"
expanding production capacity and market demand remaining strong.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the optical media industry has a clear boom-to-slump
cycle, Wong said the industry's well-bing hinges on the market supply
and demand situation. In the past few years, Wong said, CD-R discs
have been in oversupply because the market demand has shifted to
DVDs. 
</P>
<P>
The world demand for CD-Rs is estimated at around 9.5 billion
units, but the quantity is expected to drop to the tune of between
8.5 billion and 9 billion. In contrast, the demand for DVDs has been
on the rise, Wong said, adding that the global demand for DVDs
amounts to 4 billion units this year, with the figure expected to
grow further to 6 billion units next year.
</P>
<P>
There are now about 400 CD-R manufacturing firms around the
world, but only 20 DVD makers because of the high technological
barriers to production. At the moment, Wong said, only three
companies are capable of producing double-layer DVDs and CMC
Magnetics is the only one that can produce 8x double-layer DVDs.
</P>
<P>
According to Wong, the optical media industry has undergone
structural changes in the past couple of years. One of the changes is
the takeoff of the DVD market. With the CD-R demand shrinking rapidly
and prices for petrochemical raw materials skyrocketing, many CD-R
makers who have failed to shift into DVD production have been forced
out of the market.
</P>
<P>
Wong said that as the PC material price accounts for 40 percent
of the DVD cost, crude oil price hikes have seriously affected DVD
makers' profit margins.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Wong said, as PC producers in Thailand, China and
Spain have expanded their production capacity, the room for PC prices
to rise should be limited.
</P>
<P>
Wong predicted that PC prices will begin to drop in the fourth
quarter of this year. This trend will help cut DVD production costs
and contribute to market growth, he said.
</P>
<P>
Wong further said his company's earnings in July and August have
covered all of its losses in the first half of this year and that its
profits in September will hit an all-time high. "We believe our
company's profits will grow by leaps and bounds from the second half
of this year through next year, " Wong said. 
</P>
<P>
Taiwan has been the world's biggest supplier of optical drives
and discs for several years. A projected 105 million drives were
produced by Taiwan manufacturers in 2004, according to the
Taipei-based Market Intelligence Center (MIC) , with a production
value worth US$3.6 billion.
</P>
<P>
The Industrial Economics and Knowledge Center (IEK) , another
market research firm based in Taiwan, estimated that Taiwan shipped
6.8 billion optical discs in 2004, with a total value of US$1.9
billion.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan accounts for a majority of the global output of the major
optical disc formats: CD-R, 69 percent; CD-RW, 84 percent; DVD-R, 75
percent; CD-ROM, 47 percent; and DVD-RW, 62 percent, according to the
IEK.
</P>
<P>
There are about 10 manufacturers of optical drives and 15
suppliers of optical discs in Taiwan. CD-ROM and CD-RW drives, and
CD-R and CD-RW discs remain the bread-and-butter for most
manufacturers. Because of thinning profit margins for CD-based
products, leading Taiwan suppliers have been shifting focus to DVD
rewritable drives and discs.
</P>
<P>
Some of Taiwan's top optical drive manufacturers concentrate on
R&amp;D and subcontract production to EMS companies. 
</P>
<P>
Taiwan makers expect their monthly output of optical drives to
increase by an average 27 percent in 2005. DVD drives account for
more than half of suppliers' output, a trend that is expected to
intensify in 2005. DVD dual drives, at the top of the line, account
for 18 percent of total output.

MORE BUSINESSES EXPECT BRIGHTER ECONOMIC PROSPECTS
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Sept. 27 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A total of 19 percent of businesses said
they are optimistic about the economic prospects for the next three
months, compared to 17 percent who said the opposite, according to
the latest survey released Tuesday by the Council for Economic
Planning and Development (CEPD).
</P>
<P>
The survey bodes well for the future, as the percentage of
optimists are 2 percent more than that of last month, while the
percentage of the pessimists are 6 percent less than that of last
month.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the percentage of those who believe the economic
prospects will remain the same increased for 60 percent in August to
64 percent.
</P>
<P>
Based on this survey, the CEPD predicted that the country's
economic performance will improve in the second half of this year
unless oil prices surge significantly.
</P>
<P>
The slight optimism was based on the improvement in economic
performance in August, which has seen the business revenue of the
manufacturing industry increasing by 3.8 percent over the previous
month, although it is 1.8 percent less than that of the corresponding
period of last year.
</P>
<P>
Also, orders have increased by 2.4 percent over the previous
month and by 4.7 percent over the corresponding period of last year,
the equipment-utilization rate has increased by 1.4 percent over July
and by 0.5 percent over the corresponding period of last year to 81
percent.
</P>
<P>
The average profit from sales is 5 percent, which is 0.2 percent
more than the previous month and the same as the corresponding period
of last year.
</P>
<P>
In light of the fact that the international economy continues to
grow in defiance of rising international oil prices and the toll
taken by hurricanes on the U.S. economy, the CEPD forecast brighter
economic prospects for the second half of this year.

LEGISLATURE TO NEGOTIATE NCC BILL IN NEAR FUTURE
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Legislative Yuan President Wang Jin-pyng
called off a meeting that was marred by ruling-opposition scuffles
over the organic bill of the National Communications Commission (NCC)
Tuesday, saying he will call a new round of consultations over the
bill in the near future.
</P>
<P>
Wang said all party caucuses had agreed to follow regular
procedures before the meeting began Tuesday, but ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) lawmakers swarmed the speaker's quarters soon
after the meeting started, breaking their commitment, violating the
meeting rules and causing great harm to the legislature.
</P>
<P>
He said he will call another round of "substantive negotiations"
between the ruling and opposition caucuses in the coming few days and
he expressed hope that when the legislative meeting deals with the
NCC bill again Oct. 11, all lawmakers will follow the rules.
</P>
<P>
On the question of calling in police to maintain order, as he had
been demanded to do Tuesday, Wang said there are many ways to
maintain what he described as the "dignity" of the legislature and
calling in police is the worst of them.
</P>
<P>
He showed his displeasure over the fact that only DPP Policy
Committee Executive Director Ko Chien-ming apologized for damaging
the microphone on his table, while the DPP itself merely promised to
compensate for damage to public property caused by its members.
</P>
<P>
He expressed "deep regret" that DPP lawmakers seized the
speaker's quarters and the podium and called on the party caucuses to
restrain their members so that the legislature can operate normally.
</P>
<P>
The scuffles erupted when opposition Kuomintang (KMT) and People
First Party (PFP) lawmakers insisted on putting to a vote their
version of the bill calling for appointing NCC members according to
the percentage of seats each party holds at the legislature.
</P>
<P>
Premier Frank Hsieh said the NCC should be staffed by
professionals and experts without any interference from political
parties. He also expressed hope that the legislature will deliberate
the NCC organic bill along with a bill on the Executive Yuan's
organization.
</P>
<P>
Hsieh made the remarks after attending a Central Standing
Committee meeting of the DPP, during which party leaders discussed
the feasibility of giving up legislative filibustering and instead
appealing directly to the people for support of the government
version of the NCC organic bill.
</P>
<P>
Party leaders, including Presidential Secretary-General Yu
Shyi-kun, denounced the "pan-blue alliance" of the KMT and PFP for
adopting an "outdated" idea about naming NCC members that runs
counter to "world trends."
</P>
<P>
The Government Information Office (GIO) , whose mandate over the
media will be taken over by the NCC, said the government's version of
the NCC organic bill proposed that the premier's nomination of NCC
members must win legislative approval to be effective.
</P>
<P>
Such a proposal is in complete accord with what GIO described as
"the democratic trend in the world" that authorizes the parliament or
legislature to monitor the operation of an independent government
institution.
</P>
<P>
The government has never thought of dominating the nomination and
appointment of NCC members, as some people have said it will do, the
GIO claimed.

FRESH MILK AFFECTED BY DIOXIN IN TAIWAN PASTURE: STUDY
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei, Sept. 27 (CNA)
(By Han Nai-kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
High dioxin levels in Taiwan's pasture are
posing a hazard to food safety and could affect the health of
consumers who drink fresh milk, according to the results of a study
released Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The study, conducted by the Environmental Quality Protection
Foundation and Tsinhua University from January to July, has found
that dioxin levels in four varieties of grass -- kikuyu grass,
nilegrass, pangola grass and corn silage -- in Taiwan's dairy farms
reached between 1.28 nanograms per kilogram (ng/kg) and 2.25 ng/kg,
far exceeding the 0.75 ng/kg permitted by the European Union.
</P>
<P>
The dioxin levels in local pasture are also much higher than
those found in imported grass varieties, such as alfalfa hay, Bermuda
grass and oat grass, which contain less than 0.3 ng/kg of dioxin,
according to the study.
</P>
<P>
After researchers fed local dairy cows with imported grass, the
dioxin levels in the milk from these cows gradually dropped from 2.98
picograms of the toxicity equivalent per gram of fat -- denoted as
2.98 pg TEQ/g fat -- to 1.75 pg TEQ/g fat. The EU's dioxin limit for
fresh milk is 3 pg TEQ/g fat.
</P>
<P>
The study has established that grass fed to milk cows in local
dairy farms is the main reason affecting the dioxin levels in the
milk from these farms.
</P>
<P>
Dioxin, a known carcinogen, causes cancer, birth defects,
diabetes, immune system abnormalities and many other adverse health
effects if it accumulates in the human body in large amounts.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the findings of the research, Liu Min-lung,
secretary-general of the Environmental Quality Protection Foundation,
urged the Department of Health and the Council of Agriculture to set
standards as soon as possible to control the amounts of dioxin
allowed for food products and animal feed in Taiwan.

<P>
Australia has become the third-most
popular destination for Taiwan students studying overseas, behind the
United States and Britain, according to statistics released Tuesday
by the Ministry of Education (MOE).
</P>
<P>
The statistics show that in 2004, 14,054 local students obtained
U.S. student visas, 9,207 students got British visas and 2,246 got
Australian visas.
</P>
<P>
Education officials ascribed the increased interest in Australia
to the fact that it is an English-speaking nation with an education
system compatible with that of Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the International Education Expo sponsored by the
MOE this year will begin Oct. 1 with a presentation in Taipei by the
Australian Education Center, to be followed by presentations in
Taichung and Kaohsiung.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics released by the Australian Education
Center in Taipei, more than 300,000 foreign students enrolled in
Australian schools in 2003, 75 percent of whom studied in
universities, colleges and vocational schools.
Business, management and information industry were the three fields
most popular among foreign students.

before the CGJ was scheduled to announce whether the government can
require local people to be fingerprinted when they pick up their new
identity cards.
</P>
<P>
"Whatever the CGJ ruling will be, we'll respect it. The Ministry
of the Interior will consistently uphold the principle of 'rule by
law,'" Chang said, adding that the MOI will hold a news conference to
explain its stance after the CGJ formally announces its ruling
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The ministry was originally scheduled to begin issuing new
forgery-proof ID cards July 1. But the ruling Democratic Progressive
Party (DPP) filed for a Council of Grand Justices (CGJ) ruling May 30
on the constitutionality of the Household Registration Law that
requires local citizens to have their fingerprints taken when they
pick up their new ID cards. The DPP application was a response to
mounting concern about possible human rights violations.
</P>
<P>
In view of the limited time available, the CGJ imposed a
moratorium June 10 on the fingerprinting provision until it metes out
its ruling. The CGJ held a two-day hearing on the issue in July.
</P>
<P>
Recent media reports said the CGJ will rule against the
fingerprinting provision.
</P>
<P>
Another vice interior minister, Chien Tai-lang, who defended the
fingerprinting provision in the July hearing, declined to comment on
reports, saying only that the MOI will not express its stance until
after receiving the CGJ's interpretation.
</P>
<P>
Interior Minister Su Jia-chyuan said last month that the ID card
renewal will be postponed until after the Dec. 3 "three-in-one"
elections for city mayors/county magistrates, city/county councilors
and township chiefs because local population offices will be too
busy with preparations for the elections when the CGJ hand down its
ruling.
</P>
<P>
Quoting the results of an MOI survey, Su said 14 cities and
counties have suggested that ID card renewal be started Jan. 1, 2006,
while the remaining cities and counties have recommended that the
renewal be kicked off after Dec. 20.

DPP, KMT DEADLOCKED OVER NAMING OF NCC MEMBERS
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Sept.  27 (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The ruling and opposition parties may
attend a consultation meeting over the organic bill of the National
Communications Commission (NCC) called by Legislative Yuan President
Wang Jin-pyng within two weeks, but their differences over how to
appoint NCC members were still wide apart Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Chao Yung-ching, convener of the ruling Democratic Progressive
Party's (DPP) legislative caucus, said his caucus proposed the
"Public Television (PTV) model" for staffing the NCC -- that is,
before the premier nominates the members, their list would be
discussed by all caucuses at the legislature.
</P>
<P>
The PTV's board of directors and supervisors have 11 to 15
members who are appointed by the premier, but before the appointment,
they have to win a three-quarters majority vote of a screening
committee whose 11 to 13 members are "impartial and respected members
of society" recommended by the Legislative Yuan.
</P>
<P>
If the caucuses agree on the list, the premier will proceed to
appoint the members, Chao noted. He did not say what should be done
if the caucuses cannot reach a consensus over the nominations.
</P>
<P>
However, the Kuomintang (KMT) rejected the proposal, claiming
that the ruling party is incapable of "self-restraint, " so the
opposition could only resort to "the system" to keep anything
inappropriate from happening.
</P>
<P>
KMT spokeswoman Cheng Li-wen said the NCC bill should have been
passed by the end of last year, and yet the DPP has done nothing over
the past half year except allowing the Government Information Office
(GIO) to meddle in media operations.
</P>
<P>
The DPP is now filibustering the legislative meetings scheduled
for dealing with the NCC bill in an attempt to kill it off
-- an action that runs counter to President Chen Shui-bian's
campaign promise in 2000, she claimed.
</P>
<P>
As to the composition of NCC, she said the KMT and People First
Party proposed seating it with scholars and experts recommended by
the parties, not by party members.
</P>
<P>
She noted that in the KMT and PFP proposal, party workers,
state-run enterprise executives, elected officials who have run on
party tickets and even those who have recently run but failed on
party tickets are all excluded.
</P>
<P>
She called on the DPP to look at the "pan-blue alliance" proposal
and not distort or select only the portions that fit its purposes.
</P>
<P>
However, William C.T. Lai, DPP caucus secretary-general, said the
"pan-blue alliance" version of the NCC organic bill contains two
provisions that would allow the KMT to keep running China Television
Company and owning Broadcasting Corp. of China, something that is not
acceptable to the public.
</P>
<P>
While the DPP seemed willing to return to the negotiating table,
Cheng said the KMT will definitely "fight to the end" for its version
of the NCC bill.

PFP WARNS DPP: DON'T BLOCK NCC BILL AGAIN
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,   Sept.  27  (CNA)
(By Han Nai-kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A legislative caucus whip of the
opposition People First Party (PFP) warned legislators of the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) Tuesday not to obstruct the
proceedings of the organic bill of the National Communications
Commission (NCC) and the bill promoting cross-Taiwan Strait peace
again, threatening that if they do, "anything could happen."
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the chaos created by DPP legislators who surrounded
the rostrum Tuesday and made legislative proceedings impossible,
Huang Yi-chiao, convener of the PFP caucus in the legislature, said
the PFP caucus will not rule out the possibility of fighting back in
whatever manner it chooses if the DPP continues to use the same
strategy to block the passage of the two bills.
</P>
<P>
Huang also said that for the sake of the Legislature's dignity,
Legislative Yuan speaker Wang Jin-pyng should have exercised his
right to summon police to maintain order in the meeting hall, instead
of having the proceedings adjourned.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Cho Po-yuan, a whip of the opposition Kuomintang's
legislative caucus, told a press conference that DPP legislators
breached the rules of conduct for lawmakers by occupying the rostrum
and obstructing the proceedings and that they should be dealt with by
the Disciplinary Committee of the legislature.
</P>
<P>
Cho described Tuesday's chaos in the legislature as a "disgrace"
to Taiwan's democracy and lambasted the DPP as "unworthy" of its
status as the ruling party. He demanded that the DPP apologize to the
public for "treading the dignity of the legislature" under their
feet.
</P>
<P>
Chao Yung-ching, convener of the DPP legislative caucus, urged
the KMT caucus not to refer the DPP legislators to the Disciplinary
Committee because that would only make the situation in the
legislature even more chaotic.

RESOLVE TO UPGRADE SELF-DEFENSE CRITICAL TO U.S. TIES: ENVOY
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Washington,  Sept.  27 (CNA)
(By Oliver Lin and Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taiwan must prove its resolve to
upgrading its self-defense capability in its engagements with the
United States, the nation's top representative to Washington, D.C.
said Monday.
</P>
<P>
"How to prove our determination to beef up our defenses has
become the most important and confusing issue in Taiwan-U.S.
relations, " David Ta-wei Lee, the de facto Republic of China
ambassador to the United States, said during a monthly news
conference.
</P>
<P>
With the government's plan to procure three big-ticket weaponry
items from the United States having been blocked by opposition
lawmakers, Lee said many U.S. officials, congressmen and think tank
scholars have questioned Taiwan's determination to upgrade its
defense capabilities in the face of the mounting military threat from
China.
</P>
<P>
As the United States is a stakeholder in Taiwan Strait security
and stability, Lee said the United States looks forward to seeing
Taiwan upgrade its defense capabilities. As to how to realize that
goal, Lee said, the United States is willing to exchange views and
cooperate with Taiwan in carrying out relevant projects.
</P>
<P>
Lee said it is hoped that Taiwan's opposition-controlled
Legislative Yuan can begin deliberating the long-stalled arms
procurement package in a rational manner.
</P>
<P>
The Bush administration agreed in April 2001 to sell the robust
arms package to Taiwan, which comprises eight diesel-electric
submarines, six Patriot PAC III anti-missile batteries and a squadron
of 12 P-3C anti-submarine aircraft. Taiwan's legislature has rejected
putting it on the legislative agenda for more than a year.

THREE OIL PRODUCTS TO SEE COMMODITY TAX CUT NEXT MONTH: PREMIER
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Sept.  28 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Premier Frank Hsieh announced in an
Executive Yuan meeting Wednesday that commodity taxes for gasoline,
diesel and fuel oil will be adjusted downward by 25 percent starting
Oct. 1 for a trial period of three months.
</P>
<P>
The premier's announcement came amidst soaring world crude oil
prices in recent months.
</P>
<P>
Hsieh said that on average, the commodity taxes for the three
kinds of oil products will be cut by between NT$1 and NT$1.5 per
liter.
</P>
<P>
With the cut, the premier said that consumer prices and
wholesale prices are expected to decrease by 0.06 and 0.09 percentage
points, respectively.
</P>
<P>
Although the commodity tax cut will affect tax revenues, the
Ministry of Finance is still positive about reaching its tax revenue
goal for this year, the premier said, adding that stabilizing
consumer prices is the government's priority concern.
</P>
<P>
He said that if oil prices continue to soar during the
three-month trial period, the Executive Yuan will then agree to allow
the state-owned Chinese Petroleum Corp. (CPC) to hike its petroleum
prices after the three months.
</P>
<P>
The privately run Formosa Petroleum Corp. recently hiked its gas
prices due to soaring international crude oil prices. Normally, the
CPC follows suit, but it didn't on this occasion mainly because of
government's concerns about placing a heavier burden on the people.

<TEXT>
<P>
Local governments and cultural groups
around the country held rituals at Confucius temples on "Teacher's
Day" Wednesday to commemorate the great Chinese sage's 2,555th birth
anniversary.
</P>
<P>
At Confucius Temple in Taipei, Mayor Ma Ying-jeou presided over a
ceremony, with Interior Minister Su Jia-chyuan burning incense and
chanting an ode during the ritual to pay tribute to Confucius on
behalf of President Chen Shui-bian.
</P>
<P>
Eighty-six-year-old Kung Teh-cheng, who claims to be a direct
descendant of Confucius and who has been present at similar rituals
over the past 55 years since Confucius was first commemorated
officially in Taiwan in 1950, was absent from the ceremony due to
health reasons.
</P>
<P>
The commemorative ritual strictly followed ancient ceremonial
rules, with elementary school boys performing a classical "Liu I"
dance and eight academic representatives playing the role of ritual
officials amid music originating in the Sung Dynasty.
</P>
<P>
After the ceremony, Ma gave away small gift parcels, including
"wisdom cake" and a mini copy of "Lun Yu" (The Analects of Confucius)
, to some 1,000 spectators, including many foreign expatriates,
tourists and representatives from Japanese Confucian Analects
promotional associations who have traveled to Taiwan exclusively for
the occasion.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, another commemorative ritual was held at the Confucius
Temple in Tainan City, southern Taiwan. The temple is the oldest and
most representative of its kind in Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan Provincial Government Chairman Lin Kuang-hua presided over
the ritual, which featured not only the "Liu I" dance but also a
traditional practice allowing the people to pluck the "hair of
wisdom" from an ox in anticipation of learning from Confucius'
teachings and becoming wiser.
</P>
<P>
Similar commemorative rituals were held at Confucius temples in
major cities and counties around the country to honor the great sage
and teacher who has had a far-reaching influence on Chinese
philosophy and culture.

MOTORCYCLISTS ACCOUNT FOR OVER HALF OF TRAFFIC ACCIDENT DEATHS: MOTC

<P>
More than half of those who died in
traffic accidents in Taiwan in 2003 and 2004 were motorcyclists,
according to statistics released Wednesday by the Ministry of
Transportation and Communications (MOTC).
</P>
<P>
More than 2,000 motorcyclists died in traffic accidents in each

</P>
<P>
The statistics also showed that those in the 18-24 age group
accounted for the largest share of traffic accident deaths.
</P>

The MOTC also reported that there were 1,138 traffic deaths in
the first half of this year, down 10 percent from the figure for the
same period a year earlier. At the same time, the number of traffic
accidents increased by 9 percent to 72,000.

PRO-TAIWAN U.S. HOUSE REP'S TONE GETS HARSHER ON ARMS BILL DELAY
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Washington,   Sept.  27  (CNA)

<TEXT>
<P>
A longstanding pro-Taiwan U.S.
congressman said Tuesday that those who have supported Taiwan in the
U.S. Congress might review the extent of their support for the island
if Taiwan prefers not to pass the special arms procurement budget
bill.
</P>
<P>
Steve Chabot (R-Ohio) , member of the U.S. House of
Representatives and co-chair of the Taiwan Caucus in the House, made
the harsh comments while attending a seminar held by the Heritage
Foundation, a Washington, D.C.-based think tank.
</P>
<P>
"I believe that many members of Congress who have long supported
Taiwan, including myself, will re-evaluate the degree of their
support for the island if Taiwan does not pass the bill, " he said.
</P>
<P>
The bill has been stalled in the island's Legislative Yuan due
opposition from the "pan-blue alliance" of the Kuomintang and People
First Party which holds a slight majority in the legislature.
</P>
<P>
Pointing out that the delays in passing the bill have brought
Taiwan's military modernization to a standstill, the representative
said that "this makes me feel very disappointed and is a major
setback for me."
</P>
<P>
If Taiwan makes others feel that the island is weak, then China
might take action against it, he also said, adding, that if Taiwan
has strong and powerful self-defense capabilities, there will be less
chance of it being involved in a military conflict.
</P>
<P>
He further said that the United States has commitments to various
countries around the world and that Taiwan is only one of these
countries, stressing that the island should be responsible for its
own security.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Chabot also called for the Bush administration to
review its "one China" policy as the policy might lead Beijing to
mistakenly think that it has sovereignty over Taiwan and can use
force against the island to solve internal problems.
</P>
<P>
"The United States should give up its 'one China' policy as it is
a dangerous fiction," he said.

NTD-RMB CONVERSION TO BEGIN IN KINMEN, MATSU FROM OCT. 3: PREMIER
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Sept.  28 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Premier Frank Hsieh announced Wednesday
that conversion between the New Taiwan dollar and the Chinese
currency renminbi will begin on the outlying islands of Kinmen and
Matsu from Oct. 3 on atrial basis.
</P>
<P>
Local residents of Kinmen and Matsu; Taiwan residents who can
travel between the outlying islands and China's Fujian Province under
the "mini three links" regulations; and Chinese citizens who are
allowed to visit Kinmen and Matsu will be allowed to convert NT
dollars into the mainland Chinese currency or vice versa at legal
banking institutions on the two Taiwan-held islands, Hsieh said,
adding that there will be a ceiling of 20,000 renminbi (NT$80,000)
per transaction.
</P>
<P>
On whether and when the renminbi will be allowed to be listed on
the foreign exchange lists of banks on Taiwan proper, Hsieh said that
since Taiwan and China have not yet signed a bilateral currency
clearance and liquidation agreement, the renminbi is not allowed to
be exchanged, dealt or used as currency in Taiwan at the present
time.
</P>
<P>
He urged Beijing authorities to return to the negotiating table
with their Taiwan counterparts for talks on related matters so that
the two currencies will be allowed to be converted freely to help
facilitate people exchanges across the strait.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Hsieh pointed out that the renminbi will be allowed to
be exchanged in Kinmen and Matsu -- located only a stone's throw away
from the Chinese mainland -- because there is a strong demand for the
service there.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the impact on Taiwan's national security and its
financial sovereignty of allowing the transactions on the two
frontline islands will be lighter than of allowing such transactions
on Taiwan proper, he added.
</P>
<P>
Responding to Hsieh's announcement, officials from the Mainland
Affairs Council (MAC) -- Taiwan's top China policy planner -- said
that allowing NTD-renminbi conversion in Kinmen and Matsu is a
pragmatic policy designed to meet actual needs.
</P>
<P>
Fu Don-cheng, director of the MAC's Department of Economic
Affairs, said that since more and more people are traveling back and
forth via the "mini three links" route -- between Kinmen and Matsu
and the Fujian port cities of Xiamen and Mawei -- the total amount of
spending by people using the route has risen too, making NTD-renminbi
currency exchange services an "unavoidable necessity."
</P>
<P>
From Oct. 3, Fu said, people can convert NT dollars into reminbi
and vice versa at the Kinmen or Matsu branches of the Bank of Taiwan
and the Land Bank.
</P>
<P>
Local travel agencies and tourist hotels in Kinmen and Matsu will
also be commissioned to offer currency exchange services, Fu added.
</P>
<P>
In a bid to help facilitate private exchanges across the Taiwan
Strait, the Ministry of Finance announced Feb. 28, 2004 that Taiwan
citizens or foreign visitors entering Taiwan can bring a maximum of
6,000 renminbi into Taiwan per person.

PURCHASING SUBS FROM E.U. 'NOT IMPOSSIBLE': ENVOY
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Sept.  28 (CNA)
(By P.C.Tang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taiwan's top envoy in Brussels said
Wednesday at the Legislative Yuan that it is possible that Taiwan
could turn to the European Union to try to purchase submarines for
its military, but he added that "this possibility is very small."
</P>
<P>
Chen Chien-jen, Taiwan's representative to the E.U. and Belgium,
made the remarks during an interpellation session when opposition
Kuomintang Legislator Chiang Hsiao-yen, a former foreign minister,
asked him whether the island could turn to the E.U. to buy submarines
as the arms procurement bill to buy a package of weaponry items,
including submarines, from the United States remains stalled in the
Legislative Yuan.
</P>
<P>
Claiming that he has never received instructions or anything else
from Taipei to deal with matters related to the procurement of
submarines since he became Taiwan's envoy in Brussels in July of last
year, Chen, who returned to Taiwan recently for regular
consultations, also said that Taiwan's military attache stationed in
Brussels has never mentioned anything related to such a purchase.
"Therefore, I actually don't know how to reply to the question, " he
added.
</P>
<P>
However, he said that if the government were to ask him to
collect any information regarding such a procurement, he would try to
devise means to do so.
</P>
<P>
Also in response to the same question about whether Taiwan can
purchase submarines from the E.U., the envoy said that "nothing is
impossible in the world, " adding, however, that "he dares not say
anything before doing something."
</P>
<P>
Taiwan has successfully purchased submarines from the Netherlands
and Mirage jet fighters from France in the past despite the fact that
many people had not believed that such purchases were possible, he
further said.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, as the time and circumstances have changed, Chen
said that it is worthwhile for Taiwan to consider whether the rise of
China will make it more difficult for the island to purchase arms
from E.U. countries in the future.

Deputy Defense Minister Huo Shou-yeh said
Wednesday it is unlikely that Taiwan will join the United States and

Huo made the remarks in reply to opposition Kuomintang (KMT)

IT'S PATHETIC ONLY U.S. DARES HELP TAIWAN GET NEW WEAPONS: OFFICIAL

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Deputy Defence Minister Huo Shou-yeh told
the legislature's National Defense Committee Wednesday that it is
"quite pathetic" that only Washington "dares to help Taiwan acquire
military weapons."
</P>
<P>
This is why Taiwan has no alternatives other than asking the U.S.
Navy to approach European manufacturers to make submarines that are
needed to boost Taiwan's defense capability, he noted. The U.S. has
promised to sell Taiwan several submarines of a type not built in the
United States for many years.
</P>
<P>
KMT lawmaker Ting Shou-chung alleged that "high-level" Americans
might have been involved in the arms deal between the two governments
and that Taiwan's government has been "dragged along by the arms
dealers."
</P>
<P>
After hearing a navy headquarters' report on changes to the
budget for purchasing three major weaponry items, including eight
submarines that will cost NT$288 billion, ruling and opposition
lawmakers agreed to propose setting up an appropriation committee at
the legislature in anticipation of passing the arms budget bill.
</P>
<P>
However, the proposal, put forward by the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party's Lee Wen-chung, the KMT's Liao Wan-ju, the Taiwan
Solidarity Union's Ho Min-hao and others, was dropped after several
committee members protested Huo's asking for leave from the afternoon
meeting.

TAIWAN-E.U. TIES PROGRESSING STEADILY: ENVOY
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Sept.  28 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Bilateral ties between Taiwan and the
European Union have been progressing steadily over the past year,
despite the absence of formal diplomatic relations between the two
sides, Taiwan's top envoy in Brussels claimed Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Chen Chien-jen, Taiwan's representative to the E.U. and Belgium,
said that the E.U. headquarters have made announcements at least
twice over the past year -- regarding the opening of direct charter
flights across the Taiwan Strait during the Chinese New Year holidays
and Beijing's enactment of its Anti-Secession Law targeting Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
These announcements, according to Chen, underline the E.U.'s
increasing concern over the peace and stability across the Taiwan
Strait and the E.U.'s ambition to elevate its influential clout in
the international community. He made the remarks while making a
report at the Legislative Yuan Foreign Affairs Committee on bilateral
ties.
</P>
<P>
Chen said that boosting bilateral Taiwan-E.U. ties has been one
of the priorities of Taiwan's diplomatic efforts, pointing out that
in the E.U., there are 25 member countries, with a combined
population of 450 million, contributing about one-fourth of the
world's entire production value. These facts underline how important
the E.U. is in terms of influence on international politics and
global business and trade, he added.
</P>
<P>
Reviewing the development of Taiwan-E.U. ties over the past year,
Chen claimed that these efforts have made headway at a steady pace.
</P>
<P>
In addition to growth in bilateral exchanges in trade,
science-technology, education and culture, as well as tourism between
the two sides, Taiwan's engagement with the European Commission, the
executive body of the 25-member E.U., has also increased, Chen
claimed.
</P>
<P>
The European Parliament has also resolved many times to reiterate
its support for Taiwan and its concern over the cross-Taiwan Strait
situation, Chen added.
</P>
<P>
Chen warned, meanwhile, that Taiwan should pay closer heed to
talks between the E.U. and Beijing about establishing a comprehensive
strategic partnership between them, a development that will
unavoidably have an adverse impact on Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
He also made note of the fact that the E.U. is under intense
pressure from some of its strongest members to lift its arms embargo
on China, in place since the Tiananmen massacre of 1989.
</P>
<P>
Although the E.U. is unlikely to lift its arms embargo this year,
Austria and Finland -- which will next year each hold for six months
the presidency at the Europearn Council, the top decision-making body
of the E.U. -- might turn the issue around under "certain external
pressures," Chen warned.

 Basseterre, St. Kitts and Nevis, Sept. 27 (CAN) Republic of China
President Chen Shui-bian described Taiwan Tuesday as a boat sailing
on an even keel, as long as no-one rocks the boat.
</P>
<P>
Chen, who arrived in the Federation of St. Kitts and Nevis
earlier in the day, made the remarks during a cruise on the Caribbean
with some of his entourage and reporters.
</P>
<P>
Assisted by Sheng Po-chi, the chief security officer at the
Presidential Office who once commanded a submarine, Chen tried his
hand at sailing a yacht for the first time.
</P>
<P>
Asked about his feelings at the wheel, the president said that
"one needs to concentrate. We're on the same boat, as long as there
is no rowdy noise and fighting, the boat will sail smoothly."

</P>
<P>
Su Tseng-chang, chairman of the ruling Democratic Progressive
Party, who was accompanying the president on the cruise, also said
that one should "ignore the rowdy noise of others. Just keep steadily
forward single-mindedly and concentrate on taking care of the lives
of all those aboard."
</P>
<P>
Asked about who is most suitable to take the helm of Taiwan in
2008, President Chen pointed out that that is up to the public.

COA TO MONITOR BIRD DROPPINGS TO KEEP AVIAN FLU AT BAY

<TEXT>
<P>
The Council of Agriculture (COA) has
stepped up efforts to keep avian flu at bay, including monitoring
excrement dropped by migratory birds visiting Taiwan, COA Minister
Lee Chin-lung said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Fielding questions at the Legislative Yuan Economics and Energy
Committee, Lee noted that while Taiwan is free of bird flu, it is
surrounded by nations affected by bird-flu. 
</P>
<P>
Cases of avian flu in birds have been confirmed in Cambodia,
China, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Japan, Laos, Pakistan, South Korea,
Thailand and Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
The situation now is more severe, as flocks of migratory birds
have begun to arrive in Taiwan to spend the winter, increasing the
risk of a possible avian flu outbreak in Taiwan, Lee noted.
</P>
<P>
Fortunately, so far there is no evidence to suggest that the
virus has been brought in by the feathered visitors, Lee added.
</P>
<P>
Lee made the remarks in response to an interpellation by
opposition Kuomintang Legislator Hung Yu-chin, who asked Lee to make
sure the COA strengthens preventive measures with the arrival of the
high-risk bird flu season. "If this epidemic disease, which can be
spread from birds to humans, attacks Taiwan, it will be a calamity,
at least for the country's poultry industry," Hung said.

COA STOPPING CONTAMINATED DUCK EGGS FROM ENTERING MARKET
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Sept.  28 (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Council of Agriculture (COA) took
emergency measures Wednesday to stop allegedly contaminated duck eggs
produced at a central Taiwan farm from entering the market.
</P>
<P>
COA Chairman Lee Chin-lung made the statement at the Legislative
Yuan amid reports that duck eggs from a farm in Shenkang town,
Changhua County were found to contain unsafe levels of dioxin, a
known carcinogen, the second such incident in three months.
</P>
<P>
In June, duck eggs produced in Hsienhsi town, also in Changhua
County, were found to have been contaminated by allegedly unsafe
levels of dioxin.
</P>
<P>
The county's environmental bureau tested duck eggs from Shenkang
farm Aug. 18 and Aug. 24 and found that of the five samples, two had
toxicity of 7.34 pg TEQ/g fat and 7.83 pg TEQ/g fat, respectively,
far exceeding the European Union's food safety limit of 3pg TEQ/g
fat.
</P>
<P>
A picogram (pg) is one trillionth of a gram. One pg of the
toxicity equivalent per gram of fat is expressed as 1 pg TEQ/g fat.
</P>
<P>
Lee said the authorities were holding all the ducks and 6,000 kg
of duck eggs pending further checkups. If dioxin levels exceed safety
limits, the birds and the eggs will be destroyed, he added.
</P>
<P>
As Environmental Protection Minister Chang Kuo-lung has excluded
air and soil as contamination sources, the COA will check the feed
used by the owner of the farm, but the results are not expected to
come out until December.
</P>
<P>
Initial tests show that the feed used by the farmer, identified
as Chang Chin-tze, contains two ingredients with dioxin levels of
2.31 pg TEQ/g fat and 0.773 pg TEQ/g fat, also surpassing EU's safety
limit of 0.75 pg TEQ/g fat.
</P>
<P>
Chang claimed to have been using the same duck feed for six
years.
</P>
<P>
In Kaohisung, officials visited the feed manufacturer, Mao Sheng
Feed Company, and took two samples to be analyzed by National Cheng
Kung University's Institute of Environmental Engineering.
</P>
<P>
The Environmental Protection Administration was informed by the
county bureau Sept. 21 of its tests, but the EPA did not notify the
COA until Sept. 27, triggering allegations that the delay has caused
a lot of contaminated eggs to enter the market.

<TEXT>
<P>
The ruling Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) vowed to work toward its goals of reform as it celebrated its
19th founding anniversary Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Cheng Wen-tsang, director of the DPP's Department of Culture and
Information, made the remarks in the wake of a poll showing
that the approval rating for the ruling party has fallen to a dismal
low.
</P>
<P>
The party had not planned special celebrations Wednesday as
President Chen Shui-bian is on a five-nation diplomatic tour of
Central American and Caribbean allies and Su Tseng-chang, chairman of
the ruling Democratic Progressive Party, is accompanying him.

</P>
<P>
However, the party staged a celebration in the central city of
Taichung Sept. 16, during which President Chen said that "reform is
the road we must take. We must insist on continued reform of our
political, economic and social systems to keep our vitality and
competitiveness. Otherwise, we'll be ousted from office."
</P>
<P>
Cheng, faced with recent criticism from the public, said the
party will take stock of all criticism and review all suggestions.
</P>
<P>
He was referring to a poll published by the China Times newspaper
Wednesday that shows the DPP's approval rating as having fallen to
a new low, while several social movement activists and academics also
criticized the party for deviating from its ideals.
</P>
<P>
"The DPP is a party of reforms, and many of our ideals have been
accomplished. Other goals of reform have yet to be achieved because
the timing, conditions and political environment are not yet ripe, "
Cheng claimed.
</P>
<P>
He said the DPP will not pass the buck but will reflect upon
itself in sincerity and continue to work toward its reform goals.

DPP HOPEFULS FOR 2008 ELECTION NEED TO WORK HARDER: PRESIDENT

<P>
President Chen Shui-bian
said here Tuesday that the 2008 presidential hopefuls of the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) are not working hard enough and
must make more effort if they want any chance of winning the
election.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to Taiwanese reporters covering his 12-day state visit
to five nations in Central America and the Caribbean, Chen said he is
confident of the DPP's performance in the 2008 presidential election,
as well as the December elections of mayors and county magistrates.
</P>
<P>
However, he admitted that the situation is "fluid" with regard to
which political party might win the election because the event is
still two-and-a-half years away.
</P>
<P>
Asked how the DPP will cope if the opposition Kuomintang (KMT)
presents party chairman Ma Ying-jeou and Legislative Yuan speaker
Wang Jin-pyng as its presidential and vice presidential candidates,
Chen said this is unlikely although he did not rule out such a
possibility.
</P>
<P>
He claimed that the existing rivalry between Wang and Ma is not
merely something between themselves, but also involves former KMT
Chairman Lien Chan, People First Party Chairman James Soong and
former President Lee Teng-hui.
</P>
<P>
He said a Ma-Wang ticket for the KMT in the presidential election
would not be easy to achieve because there are "too many variables."
</P>
<P>
Asked to comment on a report that Soong might seriously consider
running for Taipei mayor in 2006, Chen said the PFP is "testing the
water."
</P>
<P>
The president, accompanied by an entourage of officials and
business leaders, arrived in the Federation of St. Kitts and Nevis

OPPOSITION HEADS KNOW ARMS PROCUREMENT PACKAGE HAS TO PASS: PRESIDENT
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Basseterre, St. Kitts,  Sept. 27 (CNA)
(By S. J. Tsai and Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Visiting Republic of China
President Chen Shui-bian said Tuesday that a long-stalled arms
procurement package has to be passed in the end, and opposition
leaders and the United States know this "clearly."
</P>
<P>
President Chen made the remarks in Basseterre, St. Kitts and
Nevis, on the fourth stop of his five-nation diplomatic tour of
Central America and the Caribbean, when he spoke to a group of Taiwan
journalists covering his visit.
</P>
<P>
He was referring to the three big-ticket items in the arms
procurement package -- eight diesel-electric submarines, six Patriot
PAC III anti-missile batteries and a squadron of 12 P-3C
anti-submarine aircraft -- which has been stalled for more than one
year at the legislature.
</P>
<P>
The president's words came after the "pan-blue alliance"
lawmakers of the Kuomintang (KMT) and the People First Party (PFP)
used their majority to block the government's arms purchase bill from
being put on the legislative agenda for the 30th time earlier in the
day.
</P>
<P>
The president said that former KMT Chairman Lien Chan, PFP
Chairman James Soong, Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng and KMT
Chairman Ma Ying-jeou all know "clearly that the arms procurement
package has to pass, " and that the U.S. also knows clearly the
whole story of the long-stalled package.
</P>
<P>
The president said that during his transit stop in Miami, Florida
en route to Guatemala to embark on his diplomatic tour, he 
talked with an influential U.S. congressional leader by phone.
</P>
<P>
"The congressional leader told me that he will meet with U.S.
Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld in the hope that the latter will
send a letter to KMT Chairman Ma Ying-jeou to seek Ma's support for
the arms procurement package," Chen said.
</P>
<P>
The president said that he thinks the U.S. congressional leader
should also write to PFP Chairman James Soong because Soong has
played a key role in blocking the package from being placed onto the
legislative agenda for discussion.
</P>
<P>
Chen also said that his transit in Miami on Sept. 20 was the
result of discussions with the United States.
</P>
<P>
He said that the U.S. has its own "strategic considerations."
Chinese President Hu Jintao visited the U.S. before Chen made his
transit stop and both were treated as Asian leaders, the president
said, adding that Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi would
probably be the next to arrive in the States.
</P>
<P>
He also said that his predecessor, Lee Teng-hui, wrote him a
letter about Lee's upcoming visit to the United States, but the
president stressed that Lee will not be representing the government
or Chen.
</P>
<P>
Reports have said that Lee will visit the U.S. next month. He
will probably meet with Alaska Governor Frank H. Murkowski in
Anchorage before flying on to New York, Washington, D.C. and Los
Angeles.
</P>
<P>
Lee will give a speech at the National Press Club (NPC) based in
Washington, D.C. on Oct. 20. He will also give a brief speech over
a luncheon on Capitol Hill, reports said.

JAPANESE TOURISTS COULD TOP ONE MILLION NEXT MONTH

<P>
The one millionth Japanese tourist of
this year is expected to enter Taiwan in late October or early
November, the Tourism Bureau said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Statistics showed that Japanese tourists have made 718,000 visits
to Taiwan as of the end of August, and that the arrivals have grown
rapidly in the latter half of the year.
</P>
<P>
Tourism operators attributed the increased arrivals of Japanese
to a number of factors, including the anti-Japanese activities in
China over allegations of Japanese tampering of history in textbook
on World War II atrocities early this year as well as Japan's
territorial disputes with South Korea, which used to be a hot
destination for Japanese tourists.

COUNCIL OF GRAND JUSTICES FINDS ID FINGERPRINTING UNCONSTITUTIONAL
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Sept.  28 (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Council of Grand Justices ruled
Wednesday that the Ministry of Interior's plan to make fingerprinting
mandatory for those applying for new ID cards is unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
The Grand Justices said government agencies must have sound
institutional and procedural measures to protect the fingerprints
that would be gathered to meet the constitutional requirement for
protecting people's information and privacy rights.
</P>
<P>
They said the right to privacy, although not listed in the
Constitution, is a basic human right that is protected under Article
22 of the Constitution, which aims to safeguard private life from
being intruded on and to ensure a citizen's autonomy over private
data.
</P>
<P>
They stressed that in the event of a national necessity to
collect and file people's fingerprints, a law must be legislated in
advance to define the use of the fingerprints and to prohibit their
use outside of the law.
</P>
<P>
Only two Grand Justices on the 15-member council put forward
dissenting views on the controversy over suspected infringement of
the measure on human rights and privacy.
</P>
<P>
The measure, adopted according to the household registration law
and set to go into effect on July 1, was ordered suspended on June 10
after Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) Legislator William C.T. Lai
and 84 others challenged its constitutionality by requesting a
constitutional interpretation of the law.
</P>
<P>
Minister of the Interior Su Chia-chuan said his ministry will
respect the ruling and drop the fingerprinting requirement.
</P>
<P>
The ministry will go ahead with its plan to change ID cards
starting on Dec. 21.
</P>
<P>
The Grand Justices' decision was hailed by many groups and
individuals, including the DPP legislative caucus and Vice President
Annette Lu, who has voiced opposition to the measure from the start.

DEFENSE MINISTRY DEFENDS BUDGET FOR SUBMARINES
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei, Sept. 28 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Ministry of National Defense defended
its budget for eight submarines in a report to the Legislative Yuan
Wednesday, calling the price of NT$288 billion (US$8.65 billion)
reasonable.
</P>
<P>
The ministry said in the report that the diesel-electric
submarines offered by the U.S. to Taiwan are out of production in the
United States. Therefore, to build the submarines, the report said,
the U.S. has to set up a production line exclusively for them, in
addition to getting the approval of its origin designers for export.
</P>
<P>
Taking into account of these factors, the defense ministry said,
the U.S. estimates the price of the submarines at US$657 million, or
NT$21.12 billion apiece.
</P>
<P>
If the cost of ammunition and training of crews are included, the
price will increase to NT$288.03 billion and that is the price asked
by the ministry in a special budget for the submarines.
</P>
<P>
The report disputes allegations that the price asked by the U.S.
for the submarines is too high, saying that the price of the same
class of submarines may vary with its building time, builders and even
its buyers.
</P>
<P>
Citing a story published by Jane's Defense Weekly, the report
said, the French sold its Scorpion-class submarines to Malaysia, India
and Chile separately for prices ranging from US$580 million apiece to
US$250 million apiece.
</P>
<P>
Although the U.S. has promised to sell eight submarines to
Taiwan, the report said, it won't start the construction of them
before Taiwan's legislature approves the budget for the deal, adding
that the defense ministry will take pains to ensure that the price
for the deal is not inflated if the legislature passes the budget.

VISITS TO THAILAND 'UNRELATED TO THAI LABORERS': PREMIER
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taitung,  eastern  Taiwan,  Sept.  28 (CNA)
(By Han Nai-kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Premier Frank Hsieh
denied Wednesday that his visits to Thailand during his term as
Kaohsiung mayor were related to the hiring of Thai laborers for the
Kaohsiung rapid transit project.
</P>
<P>
In response to an allegation made at the Executive Yuan by Huang
Chao-shun, a legislator of the opposition Kuomintang (KMT) , Hsieh
said during a tour of Taitung that Huang should present evidence to
prove her allegations.
</P>
<P>
Hsieh did not say how many times he had visited Thailand while he
was Kaohsiung mayor, but an aide admitted that Hsieh went there four
times.
</P>
<P>
According to the aide, Hsieh used his first visit to gather
information about the mass rapid transit system in Bangkok. During
the second visit, he attended the inauguration of the Bangkok chapter
of the Association of Friends of President Chen Shui-bian. The third
visit was for the inauguration of the Association of Friends of Frank
Hsieh in Thailand, and the fourth was to discuss an exchange program
to acquire elephants from Thailand.
</P>
<P>
However, during an interpellation in the legislature, Huang said
that Hsieh visited Thailand six times, and that during each visit he
was accompanied by two foreign labor brokers from Taiwan who served
as advisers to the Kaohsiung City Government.
</P>
<P>
The KMT legislator produced newspaper clippings and business
cards gathered from Bangkok to show that one of the two brokers,
Huang Su-cheng, is currently a member of the Overseas Chinese Affairs
Commission, and that her residence in Thailand not only serves as the
Democratic Progressive Party's office in Southeast Asia, but is also
the address of the Association of Friends of Frank Hsieh.
</P>
<P>
When the Kaohsiung Rapid Transit Corp. (KRTC) was preparing to
hire workers for the project, its board of directors promised to
adhere to the policy set by the Kaohsiung City Government that
priority should given to domestic workers. However, critics say the
KRTC ignored the policy by setting unreasonable hurdles to keep
domestic workers away while hiring more than 17,000 Thai laborers
through a broker.
</P>
<P>
The issue of who gave the order to favor the Thai laborers has
been pursued heatedly by legislators of the opposition parties, as
well as by the news media. Public prosecutors in Kaohsiung are also
investigating accusations that hundreds of millions of new Taiwan
dollars earmarked for wages to be paid to the Thai laborers have
disappeared into mysterious accounts.
</P>
<P>
The alleged corruption was brought to light when Thai workers
rioted in their living quarters in Kaohsiung County on Aug. 22 to
protest the inhumane treatment by their employers and the manpower
management company in charge of them.

TAIWAN FIFTH MOST  COMPETITIVE ECONOMY IN THE WORLD: WEF
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Sept. 28 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taiwan was ranked fifth in the world and
first in Asia in terms of competitiveness, according the 2005
competitiveness rankings released by the World Economic Forum (WEF)
in Geneva Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Thomas Yeh, vice minister of the Council for Economic Planning
and Development, said Taiwan's global ranking is one position lower
than that of last year because of its not too good performance in
macroeconomics environment, in which the country's rank has been
downgraded from ninth place in 2004 to 17th place this year according
to the assessment of the WEF.
</P>
<P>
Yeh attributed the downgrading to surging international oil
prices and the domestic political struggles among different political
parties that have dimmed the country's economic prospects and has
fueled inflation concerns.
</P>
<P>
However, Yeh said, the WEF pointed out that Taiwan's performance
in technological innovation is excellent, not least in mobile phones,
personal computers and the use of advanced Web technologies.
</P>
<P>
According to the WEF report, Finland remains the most competitive
economy in the world for the third consecutive year, followed by the
United States, Sweden, Denmark, Taiwan and Singapore.

PATRIOT III PURCHASE SHOULDN'T BE AFFECTED BY REFERENDUM: OFFICIAL
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Sept. 29 (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The purchase of Patriot III anti-missile
batteries was approved in 1998 during President Lee Teng-hui's term
of office and therefore should not be affected by the 2004
referendum, Deputy Defense Minister Tsai Ming-hsien said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Tsai made the remarks at a Legislative Yuan National Defense
Committee meeting when he reported his ministry's response to the
controversy triggered by the defeat of the 2004 referendum initiated
by the Chen Shui-bian government.
</P>
<P>
Tsai said the ministry was simply "continuing" a government
policy by requesting a budget for purchasing Patriot III missiles,
which were not listed in the referendum question. What was listed
instead was the term "increasing anti-missile devices," he noted.
</P>
<P>
He acknowledged that the referendum was vetoed because less than
50 percent of eligible voters cast their ballots. Still, he pointed
out, of those who voted, 7.4 million agreed with the government's
proposal to increase anti-missile equipment for the armed forces,
which he said makes it clear where mainstream public opinion stands
with regard to the issue.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Tsai said, the referendum law does not specify that the
government cannot ask for legislative support for a bill or a budget
to implement a project that has been vetoed in a referendum.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, he said he would like to ask the legislature to
consider public opinion as well as the urgent need to boost the
nation's defense capability, and support the government's request for
buying Patriot III batteries.
</P>
<P>
The NT$140 billion budget for purchasing Patriot III anti-missile
batteries has been moved to the ministry's regular annual budget from
a special budget for three major weaponry items that include
submarines and anti-submarine aircraft.

FSC OFFICIAL BANNED FROM LEAVING COUNTRY: PROSECUTOR GENERAL
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>

(By S.C. Chang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Prosecutor General Wu Ying-chao said
Thursday that Financial Supervisory Commission (FSC) counselor Lee
Chin-cheng, who has been under investigation for alleged involvement
in an insider-trading scandal, has been banned from leaving the
country before the case is closed.
</P>
<P>
Wu made the remarks following media reports that the former
director of the FSC's Examination Bureau has been issued an
immigration visa by the American Institute in Taiwan. Lee was
transferred to serve as an FSC counselor after the alleged
insider-trading scandal surfaced in July.
</P>
<P>
In reply to Legislator Chiu Yi's question during a Legislative
Yuan Judicial Affairs Committee meeting, Wu said that Lee's case is
being probed by the Anti-Corruption Center of the Taiwan High
Prosecutor's Office and that Lee has since July been banned from
leaving the country.
</P>
<P>
Justice Minister Shih Mao-lin said the prosecutors will make
their best judgment with regards to the case, adding that his
ministry should refrain from making any comment.
</P>
<P>
FSC Chairman Kong Jaw-sheng, who received a phone call from Lee
Thursday morning, told another committee meeting at the legislature
that Lee was applying for a U.S. visa because he needs to take care
of his two daughters who are studying there.
</P>
<P>
Kong said that Lee did not tell him that he plans to move to the
United States for good. "As far as I understand, Lee has been banned
from leaving Taiwan," he added.
</P>
<P>
Lee was allegedly involved in a high-profile insider stock
trading case known as the "Vultures" scandal.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan High Court prosecutors in July offended Kong by
questioning Lee on suspicions that he tipped off a group that made
large profits via insider trading.
</P>
<P>
Premier Frank Hsieh later had to come forward to quell a war of
words between the prosecutors and FSC.

LAWMAKERS DEBATE VICE DEFENCE CHIEF'S REFERENDUM LOGIC
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Sept.  29 (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Both ruling and opposition lawmakers
challenged Vice Minister of National Defense Tsai Ming-hsien's
argument Thursday that even though the 2004 arms purchase referendum
did not receive enough voter participation to be considered valid,
the government can still propose a budget for buying anti-missile
equipment.
</P>
<P>
In a report to the Legislative Yuan's National Defense Committee,
Tsai said that because in the referendum people were asked to vote on
"increasing anti-missile devices, " which is unrelated to a
government policy adopted in 1998 to purchase Patriot III
anti-missile batteries, the government would be merely "continuing"
that policy by requesting a NT$140 billion budget for buying the
anti-missile batteries.
</P>
<P>
The relevant question from the referendum was: "The people of
Taiwan demand that the Taiwan Strait issue be resolved through
peaceful means. Should mainland China refuse to withdraw the missiles
it has targeted at Taiwan and openly renounce the use of force
against us, would you agree that the government should acquire more
advanced anti-missile weapons to strengthen Taiwan's self-defense
capabilities?"
</P>
<P>
In response to opposition lawmakers' charge that he was using
"twisted logic, " Tsai said an invalid referendum does not mean the
government henceforth cannot push for a budget to acquire Patriot III
missiles, and if that can be described as "twisted logic, " then he
said he was "twisting it correctly."
</P>
<P>
People First Party (PFP) Legislator Chao Liang-yen pointed out
that the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) government has bound its
own hands and feet, like a silkworm restraining itself in its own
cocoon, by initiating a referendum that was invalidated.
</P>
<P>
Now, she said, the vice minister is demonstrating "a lawyer's
traits" by "twisting the logic, " and when that isn't successful, he
simply goes on to "play the rogue" with an eye-opening performance.
</P>
<P>
Even Tsai's fellow DPP lawmaker, Lee Wen-chung, joined the ranks
of oppositionists, questioning him why in the first place should the
government push for a referendum, which was supposed to make up for
the shortfalls of representative politics, if in any way the
government was to push a policy that would be invalidated in a
referendum?
</P>
<P>
Lee suggested that if the ruling and opposition parties remain
bogged down on the issue, they could request that the Council of
Grand Justices give a legal solution.
</P>
<P>
Tsai told a DPP caucus meeting that if the "pan-blue alliance" of
the Kuomintang and the PFP removed the Patriot III budget from the
overall budget bill before putting it on the legislative agenda, the
Ministry of National Defense will likely request a constitutional
interpretation.
</P>
<P>
DDP Legislator Tang Huo-sheng said the arms purchase issue is now
beyond the legislature's ability to solve. He suggested that DPP
Chairman Su Tseng-chang invite the leaders of all political parties
for a meeting to break the impasse.

POTENTIAL VISIT BY  CHINESE OFFICIALS WOULD FOLLOW EXISTING LAW: MAC
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Sept.  29 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The government will neither waive legal
requirements nor impose special barriers in dealing with applications
by Chinese officials to visit Taiwan, Mainland Affairs Council (MAC)
Chairman Joseph Wu said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Wu made the remarks while delivering a report on the MAC's
operations and progress in planning for direct "three links" across
the Taiwan Strait and a full-fledged opening of the door for Chinese
citizens to visit Taiwan for sightseeing purposes.
</P>
<P>
After his report, opposition lawmakers asked Wu about the MAC's
stance on two senior Chinese officials' possible visits to Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
According to media reports, Jia Qinglin, chairman of the
Beijing-based Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, and
Chen Yulin, director of the Taiwan Affairs Office under China's State
Council, may travel to Taiwan to attend an economic forum to be
co-sponsored by Taiwan's opposition Kuomintang (KMT) and the
Communist Party of China in Taipei in mid-December.
</P>
<P>
KMT Legislator Lee Ching-hua asked Wu, Taiwan's top mainland
policy planner, whether the government would block the two Chinese
officials from entering Taiwan to attend the forum.
</P>
<P>
"After China dared to allow Li Ao, an independent Taiwan
legislator who is widely seen as a political gadfly, to visit Beijing
and Shanghai, will we still hesitate to open our door to senior
Chinese officials?" Lee asked.
</P>
<P>
To the best of his understanding, Wu said a large number of
Chinese officials have already been to Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Regarding Chinese officials' visit, Wu said the two sides of the
Taiwan Strait should communicate and consult first to ensure their
travel safety in Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
"Otherwise, there might be risks. Early this month, Zhu
Xiangdong, a deputy director of China's National Bureau of
Statistics, died in Taipei while taking a hot spring bath. Zhu was
here at the invitation of a local private university for academic
exchanges without prior consultations with our relevant authorities,"
Wu said.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the government has yet to formulate a policy on the
visit by Chinese officials of the level or stature of Jia and Chen,
Wu said at present he could not answer such a hypothetical issue as
to whether Jia and Chen would be granted visas to visit Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Pressed by several other KMT and People First Party lawmakers, Wu
said he himself would not oppose opening the door to Jia and Chen if
their visits would not break any of Taiwan's existing laws and
regulations governing cross-strait engagements.

OFFICIAL TALKS A PREREQUISITE FOR NTD-RMB CONVERSION IN TAIWAN: MAC
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei, Sept. 29 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Making the Chinese renminbi convertible in
Taiwan proper would first require official cross-strait talks,
Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) Chairman Joseph Wu said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Premier Frank Hsieh announced the day before that new Taiwan
dollar-renminbi conversion would be allowed on the outlying islands
of Kinmen and Matsu from Oct. 3 on a trial basis.
</P>
<P>
A group of opposition legislators asked Wu during a Legislative
Yuan Home and Nations Committee meeting whether and when the renminbi
will be allowed to be posted on the foreign exchange lists of banks
on Taiwan proper.
</P>
<P>
Wu said that since Taiwan and China have not yet signed a
bilateral currency clearance and liquidation agreement, the renminbi
is not allowed to be exchanged, dealt or used as currency in Taiwan
at the present time.
</P>
<P>
Opening of such a program that would have a far-reaching impact
on Taiwan's national security and its financial sovereignty should
not be conducted without adequate coping measures, Wu said, adding
that currently Taiwan has not set out any timetable for this.
</P>
<P>
Opposition People First Party Legislator Christina Liu suggested
that the MAC -- Taiwan's top China policy planner -- work to have an
article of the Statute Governing the Relations Between the People of
the Taiwan Area and the Mainland Area amended so that a stipulation
about "the signing of a cross-strait bilateral currency clearance and
liquidation agreement" can be changed into "the building of a
cross-strait bilateral currency clearance and liquidation mechanism."
</P>
<P>
Wu said that he would not mind if this proposal were to be passed
by the Legislative Yuan if all legislators from the ruling and
opposition parties agreed.
</P>
<P>
Even if this becomes law, Wu said, it would only be a law and the
final implementation of the money exchange program in Taiwan would
require cross-strait negotiations by officials from both sides.
</P>
<P>
Noting that Taiwan's Central Bank of China suggested long ago
that the "agreement" wording be changed into "mechanism" to
facilitate the implementation and Beijing has also expressed its
consent, opposition Kuomintang Legislator Lee Jih-chu said that the
whole issue is now "stuck" with the word "agreement, " which has been
insisted upon by the MAC.
</P>
<P>
Lee called for the MAC not to make itself "the greatest barrier"
to the development of cross-strait economic and trade exchanges.
</P>
<P>
Rebuffing Lee's accusation, Wu said that financial and monetary
liberalization toward China should be carried out gradually and in a
safe manner. Taiwan has made enough positive movements over the past
couple of years to help facilitate cross-strait exchanges and people
in Taiwan should bear in mind what kind of "external
situation" Taiwan is facing, particularly after Beijing passed its
Anti-Secession Law targeting Taiwan, Wu added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, ruling Democratic Progressive Party Legislator Hsu
Kuo-yung lashed out at Beijing for continuously refusing to engage in
talks with Taiwan's administration on the bilateral currency
clearance and liquidation agreement issue.
</P>
<P>
Hsu said that it would be unlawful if the administration opens
the renminbi to be converted in Taiwan before any relevant law is
legislated.
</P>
<P>
According to Premier Hsieh, the NTD-RMB conversion program will
be opened in Kinmen and Matsu conditionally.
</P>
<P>
Only local residents of Kinmen and Matsu; Taiwan residents who
can travel between the outlying islands and China's Fujian province
under the "mini three links" regulations; and Chinese citizens who
are allowed to visit Kinmen and Matsu will be allowed to convert NT
dollars into the mainland Chinese currency or vice versa at legal
banking institutions on the two Taiwan-held islands, Hsieh said,
adding that there will be a ceiling of 20,000 renminbi (NT$80,000)
per transaction.
</P>
<P>
Hsieh stressed that the renminbi will be allowed to be exchanged
in Kinmen and Matsu -- located only a stone's throw away from the
Chinese mainland -- because there is a strong demand for the service
there.
</P>
<P>
In addition, he said, the impact on Taiwan's national security
and its financial sovereignty of allowing the transactions on the two
frontline islands will be less than allowing such transactions
on Taiwan proper.
</P>
<P>
In a bid to help facilitate private exchanges across the Taiwan
Strait, the Ministry of Finance announced Feb. 28, 2004 that Taiwan
citizens or foreign visitors entering Taiwan can bring a maximum of
6,000 renminbi into Taiwan per person.

PFP WANTS TO HELP CONVICTED FORMER LEGISLATIVE SPEAKER IF HE RETURNS
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Sept.  29 (CNA)
(By Han Nai-kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If convicted former legislative speaker
Liu Sung-fan decides to return to Taiwan and accept his fate, the
opposition People First Party (PFP) will try to get him released from
jail on bail for medical treatment, a PFP whip said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Huang Yi-chiao, convener of the PFP legislative caucus, made the
remarks when asked to comment on news reports that Liu, who is in
poor health and tired of hiding in the United States, wants to come
back to Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Liu, 74, served as president of the Legislative Yuan from 1992 to
1999 while the Kuomintang (KMT) was in power, but he joined the PFP
in January 2000 and became one of its legislators-at-large after he
was expelled from the KMT for supporting PFP Chairman James Soong
during Soong's campaign for president.
</P>
<P>
Liu was sentenced to four years in jail and given a NT$30 million
fine in September 2004 by the Taiwan High Court's Taichung Branch for
corruption. The court found that, as chairman of the board at the
Taichung Business Bank, Liu received NT$150 million in kickbacks from
Tseng Cheng-jen, president of the Kuangsan Enterprise Group in return
for granting illegal loans worth NT$1.5 billion to the group.
</P>
<P>
At the time of the sentence, Liu was attending the Republican
Party convention in New York. He has remained in the United States
ever since. The warrant issued for his arrest will be valid for 15
years.
</P>
<P>
Also commenting on the report about Liu's intention of coming
back, Lai Ching-te, a whip of the DPP's legislative caucus, said Liu
should not try to negotiate the terms under which he will do his
time, acting as if he still has privilege.
</P>
<P>
He said that Liu should come back to Taiwan to serve his
sentence, and that if he is found to have a health problem while he
is in jail, the legal system may grant him bail for medical treatment
based on humanitarian considerations.
</P>
<P>
Answering questions in the legislature, Minister of Justice Shih
Mao-lin also said that Liu must be jailed first before he can apply
for bail, which would be based on his need for medical treatment.

Citizens of Taipei City aged 65 or over

of Health of the Taipei city government announced Thursday.
</P>

A spokesman for the department reminded elderly citizens that it

that they should be well-prepared for the flu season, which usually
begins in the second half of November and can persist through
Christmas until February or March the following year.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that people 65 or older are given priority in
getting free vaccine because they are a high risk group.
</P>
<P>
He added that the city government has prepared 170,000 doses of
vaccine this year, based on the flu vaccination rate of 58 percent
for the 65-and-over age group last year.
</P>
<P>
However, those who are allergic to egg protein or other
ingredients in the vaccine should avoid getting the shot, he said.

in the Caribbean, Chen said Taiwan can learn from its Caribbean ally
in planning its own second phase of constitutional reforms aimed at
consolidating its young democracy.
</P>
<P>
Chen said the Presidential Office set up a constitutional reform
consultative office Aug. 1 to push for extensive discussion on
relevant topics and pool the wisdom of the private and public sectors
with the ultimate goal of formulating a "timely, fitting and viable"
constitution before his term ends in May 2008.
</P>
<P>
Heading an entourage of government officials and business
leaders, Chen arrived in the St. Vincent and the Grenadines capital
of Kingstown earlier in the day for an official visit, making him the
first serving Republic of China head of state to set foot in the East
Caribbean nation.
</P>
<P>
He was accorded a red-carpet welcome complete with a 21-gun
salute and full military honors. Local school children sang a popular
Taiwanese folk song titled "Aspiring for Spring Wind" at the
welcoming ceremony.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of St. Vincent citizens, waving ROC and St. Vincent
national flags, turned out to greet Chen and the nation took a
half-day off to welcome him.
</P>
<P>
Chen met with the ROC embassy staff, members of an ROC technical
mission, volunteers and alternative service diplomatic staffers at
his hotel shortly after his arrival to ask about their work and boost
their morale.
</P>
<P>
St. Vincent and the Grenadines is the final leg of Chen's
five-nation diplomatic tour to Central America and the Caribbean that
has already taken him to Guatemala, the Dominican Republic, Nicaragua
and the Federation of St. Kitts and Nevis. He will make a brief
transit stop in San Francisco on his way home.

<P>
Authorities from the Children's Bureau
under the Ministry of the Interior urged the public Thursday to seek
to protect, defend and promote the "10 rights" and welfare of all
children in Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Huang Pi-hsia, director of the Children's Bureau, announced that
the last quarter of this year has been designated "children's rights
season" in the country.
</P>
<P>
Defining the "10 rights" of children, Huang said children should
have the right to life, to welfare and protection, to status, to
family and growth, to equality, to social participation and
representation, to play, to health, to education and to privacy.
</P>
<P>
They should also be entitled to the same basic human rights as
the rest of society, Huang said, adding that parents should not treat
their children as "property" to which they have the right to
"appropriate" or "handle."
</P>
<P>
Instead, Huang said, children are the common assets of the
country.
</P>
<P>
During the "children's rights season, " 26 public and private
organizations will jointly sponsor 95 rounds of activities nationwide
to educate adults and children alike as to the rights and welfare of
children, Huang added.

For G.O.P., DeLay Indictment Adds to a Sea of
Troubles 

The indictment of Representative Tom DeLay
of Texas, the House majority leader, on
Wednesday was the latest in a series of scandals
and setbacks that have buffeted Republican
leaders in Congress and the Bush administration.
The string of ethical issues so close
together - including the indictment and
continuing investigation of the Republican 
lobbyist Jack Abramoff, who was close to Mr. 
DeLay, and the arrest of David H. Safavian, a 
former White House budget official who was 
charged with lying to investigators and 
obstructing a federal inquiry involving Mr. 
Abramoff - is a source of anxiety in Republican 
circles. 

Wall Street Journal: Capitol Losses, House
Leader Leader DeLay Indicted, Adding to
Republican Woes

U.S. House Majority Leader Tom DeLay
was indicted by a Texas grand jury for campaign-
finance violations, shaking the capital's
Republican leadership and aggravating fissures
within the party that could unsettle its decade-
long dominance of Congress. DeLay was charged
with one count of criminal conspiracy for his
party in an alleged scheme to funnel illegal
corporate campaign contributions to Texas
Republicans running for the state Legislature in
2002.

FIRST FAMILY'S ASSETS ALREADY PUT INTO TRUST: OFFICIAL

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The first family's assets have all been
put into a blind trust and reported to the Control Yuan in line with
the Public Functionary Assets Disclosure Law, the Presidential Office
said Thursday in a press release.
</P>
<P>
The Presidential Office issued the statement after a local media
report quoted opposition People First Party Legislator Sun Ta-chien
as alleging that first lady Wu Shu-jen did not honestly report her
jewelry to the Control Yuan, the nation's supreme watchdog body.
</P>
<P>
The statement urged local media to refrain from giving prominent
coverage to unfounded and unverified speculation.
</P>
<P>
Under Article 4 of the Public Functionary Assets Disclosure Law,
public functionaries, including the president and vice president, and
the presidents and vice presidents of the five yuans, as well as
political appointees and elected officials and representatives, must
submit assets disclosure reports to the Control Yuan.

ECONOMICS MINISTRY DENIES FLOOD-PREVENTION BUDGET IS PORK BARREL

<TEXT>
<P>
Vice Minister of Economic Affairs Chen
Ruey-long denied Thursday that an NT$80 billion (US$2.54 billion)
special budget the government seeks for an eight-year flood-control
program in a draft bill is pork barrelling intended to boost the
ruling Democratic Progressive Party's election chances.
</P>
<P>
Testifying at a meeting held by the Economics and Energy
Committee of the Legislative Yuan to screen the bill, Chen said the
flood-control project is urgent and needs continuous funding if the
target is to be achieved.
</P>
<P>
However, opposition legislators claimed that the planned budget
is controversial because 74 percent of the funding would be spent in
counties and cities under the ruling party's control, whereas only 26
percent would be earmarked for administrative areas under opposition
control.
</P>
<P>
Debate on the bill is expected to be very heated, as more than
100 legislators have asked to present their views.
</P>
<P>
The opposition "pan-blue alliance" of the Kuomintang and the
People First Party is strongly opposed to the bill because they think
the plan presented by the ruling party for such a huge budget is "too
sketchy."

'FINGERPRINTING ALL CHINESE' PROGRAM IN THE WORKS: MAC
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Sept.  29 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
All Chinese citizens entering Taiwan,
regardless of their status or purpose of visit, will be
fingerprinted, Taiwan's top official in charge of China policy said
Thursday.

</P>
<P>
Joseph Wu, chairman of the Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) said
Chinese tourists and Chinese crew working aboard Taiwan fishing boats
will also be fingerprinted upon entry into Republic of China
territory starting in the near future.
</P>
<P>
Chinese citizens who come to Taiwan for settlement or reunion
with family members have already been getting fingerprinted upon
entry from Sept. 1, Wu said during a meeting held at the Legislative
Yuan Home and Nations Committee on the development of cross-Taiwan
Strait relations.
</P>
<P>
Fingerprinting equipment has already been set up and tested at
the country's two international airports and at the harbors on Kinmen
and Matsu, which are used for shipping links with China.
</P>
<P>
Chinese people already living in Taiwan should also have their
fingerprints taken while applying for renewal of their residence
permits, according to MAC officials.
</P>
<P>
With Taiwan opening its doors ever-wider to people from China, Wu
said, the number of Chinese people using false identity papers has
become an increasingly serious problem for the authorities, prompting
Premier Frank Hsieh to direct recently that a comprehensive
fingerprinting system should be put in place.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Wu noted, the issue of when Chinese tourists will be
allowed to come to Taiwan for leisure trips hinges on the Chinese
authorities.
</P>
<P>
Wu said that if the Beijing authorities are willing to engage in
negotiations with their Taiwan counterparts, the issue of Chinese
tourists holidaying in Taiwan can be settled within a matter of
months.
</P>
<P>
But if there is no official cross-strait talk on the issue, a
rumor that Chinese tourists will be allowed in before July 2006 is
too optimistic, Wu added.
</P>
<P>
Wu lamented that so far there have only been "contacts" and
"arrangements" across the strait on the tourism issue, with no
official talks or negotiations in sight.
</P>
<P>
Responding to several legislators from the ruling Democratic
Progress Party and its ally, the Taiwan Solidarity Union, who asked
how the administration will control and manage the influx of Chinese
tourists once the program is implemented, Wu said the MAC and
relevant agencies, including the Ministry of the Interior, have drawn
up a comprehensive package of regulations on the matter.
</P>
<P>
The regulations include restrictions on cash and assets carried
by the Chinese tourists and on places they can go during their stays,
Wu said, adding that they might also be required to remit personal
guarantee deposits prior to their arrival.

DANCERS NEED CASH TO PERFORM IN NATIONAL DAY  RALLY

<TEXT>
<P>
A group of senior Tao
dancers from the island of Lanyu off the southeast coast of Taiwan
are despondent, as financial constraints prevent them from going to
Changhua in central Taiwan to show off their traditional tribal
dances at a government-sponsored Oct. 10 Double Ten National Day
party.
</P>
<P>
Hsien Chiayouli, director-general of the Langtao Community
Development Association, said Thursday that a total of 40 Tao dancers
have been invited to perform their unique and traditional "Brave
Warrior Dance" and "Hair Dance" at the National Day rally.
</P>
<P>
The rally sponsor, however, allocated only NT$50,000 to the
group, far less than the approximately NT$600,000 that the group
would need for their four-day trip, Hsien Chiayouli said.
</P>
<P>
The group's trip would include round-trip flights from Lanyu,
also known as Orchid Island, to Taitung, flights from Taitung to
Taipei and train rides from Taipei to Changhua, in addition to hotel
accommodation and food, he added.
</P>
<P>
One angry dancer said scathingly that NT$50,000 is enough only
for the 40 Tao people to fly to nearby Green Island. "We would have
to swim the rest of the way," he added sarcastically.
</P>
<P>
Hsien Chiayouli called for help to facilitate the trip.

MOJ TO DRAFT MEASURES TO HELP FOREIGN WORKERS DEFEND THEIR RIGHTS
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Sept.  29 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Ministry of Justice (MOJ) will
cooperate with the Council of Labor Affairs (CLA) to draft a package
of measures to help foreign workers defend their rights and
interests, Minister of Justice Shih Mao-lin said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Shih made the remarks while delivering a special report at a
Legislative Yuan Judicial Committee meeting on how foreign workers
are treated under Taiwan's present judicial system and on the
progress of investigations into a recent riot by Thai laborers
working on the Kaohsiung mass rapid transit (MRT) system construction
project.
</P>
<P>
Under the current Taiwan Criminal Code, Shih said, foreign
laborers, no matter whether they are victims or perpetrators in a
criminal case, should be treated same as their Taiwan counterparts.
</P>
<P>
"Our current criminal law and litigation procedures do not
discriminate against foreign citizens," Shih said.
</P>
<P>
Claiming that the Aug. 21 riot by Thai workers indicated that
the foreign laborers lacked legal knowledge and were unaware of their
rights, Shih said the MOJ will draft feasible measures in cooperation
with the CLA to help them protect their rights and interests.
</P>
<P>
The group of Thai workers rioted at their living quarters in
Kaohsiung County in southern Taiwan Aug. 21 to protest their inhumane
treatment at the hands of their local management company, Huapan Co.
</P>
<P>
Shih said initial investigations show that the two senior Huapan
executives -- Yen Shih-hua and his wife Wang Tsai-pi -- are suspected
of racketeering in hiring and managing Thai workers working for the
Kaohsiung MRT project. The couple have been detained for further
questioning.
</P>
<P>
Acknowledging that foreign laborers have contributed a great deal
to Taiwan's public infrastructure projects, Shih said prosecution
authorities will be lenient toward any of the Thai workers who were
only slightly involved in the Aug. 21 riot.
</P>
<P>
"They will not be indicted or have been offered deferred
indictment, " Shih said.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, he said, the ringleader and those who played a
major role in the violence will be dealt with in accordance with the
law.

A 66-year-old
worker buried alive for 26 hours in a well he was digging was rescued
late Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Liu Ching-te was reportedly in good condition after firefighters
worked continuously for 17 hours to pull him from a nine-meter deep
hole. Doctors who treated him said they will try to prevent him from
developing kidney failure or rhabdomyolysis -- the breakdown of
muscle fiber resulting in the release of muscle fiber contents into
the circulation.
</P>
<P>
About 12 hours earlier, the rescue workers dug out Liu's
63-year-old cousin, Chang Tien-szu.
</P>
<P>
The two workers began digging the well in Hsinshe township
Wednesday. They were laying a cylinder when the sides collapsed,
burying Liu. While Chang was trying to dig his cousin out, more earth
crumbled and buried him too.
</P>
<P>
The construction firm Liu and Chang work for sent its own workers
to the rescue, but after digging for almost five hours, they found
the operation too difficult and decided to seek help from the local
fire brigade.
</P>
<P>
After digging for about nine hours, the firefighters pulled Chang
out. Eight hours later, as the digging continued, they heard Liu's
cries from below. The rescue mission sped up their work and finally
managed to pull Liu from the hole also.

The government has decided to cancel the
taxi fuel surcharge from Oct. 1 to help tide taxi drivers over their
financial straits amid the current gasoline price upward spiral,
Cabinet spokesman Cho Jung-tai said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
According to Cho, Premier Frank Hsieh reached the decision after
meeting with representatives of major local taxi driver associations.
</P>
<P>
At present, a NT$2,400 fuel surcharge is imposed on each taxi cab
per quarter to help finance highway and road maintenance and repair
projects.

</P>
<P>
Taiwan currently has about 9,600 taxis. The cancelation of the
taxi fuel surcharge will cost the national coffers an estimated
NT$930 million annually, Cho said, adding that the measure is aimed
at helping taxi drivers make ends meet in the face of soaring
gasoline prices.

PRESIDENT CHEN TO MAKE DETOUR EN ROUTE BACK TO TAIWAN

<TEXT>
<P>
President Chen Shui-bian will make a
detour to an unspecified country which does not maintain formal
diplomatic relations with Taiwan for a transit stop en route back to
Taiwan from St. Vincent and the Grenadines, an aide to Chen said
Thursday aboard the president's plane.
</P>
<P>
Since the flight from the St. Vincent capital of Kingstown to the
unspecified country will take more than 10 hours, the president's
return to Taiwan will be postponed by one day to Oct. 2, Presidential
Office Deputy Secretary-General James Huang said.
</P>
<P>
Huang told members of the media aboard the president's plane that
as a result of the detour, President Chen will not make a transit
stop in San Francisco en route home as originally scheduled.
</P>
<P>
"The U.S. authorities have been notified about the decision, and
they have expressed their understanding," he added.
</P>
<P>
Huang further said that the stopover destination will be
announced three hours prior to landing.
</P>
<P>
St. Vincent and the Grenadines was the final leg of Chen's
five-nation, 13-day diplomatic tour to Central America and the
Caribbean which also took him to Guatemala, the Dominican Republic,
Nicaragua, and the Federation of St. Kitts and Nevis. Chen and his
entourage had made a stopover in Miami, Florida en route to
Guatemala.

U.S. MIGHT COOPERATE WITH SPAIN TO BUILD SUBS FOR TAIWAN: LE MONDE
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Paris,  Sept.  30 (CNA)
(By Y.S. Lo and P.C.Tang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The United States might cooperate with
Spain to build submarines to sell to Taiwan, the French newspaper Le
Monde reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Washington has agreed to sell eight diesel-electric submarines to
Taiwan, as well as six Patriot PAC III anti-missile batteries
and 12 P-3C anti-submarine aircraft, although the island's
legislature has yet to pass the long-stalled arms procurement bill to
buy the weaponry items.
</P>
<P>
According to the Le Monde report, both Germany and France, which
have monopolized almost entire traditional submarine production in
the global market, have said they do not want to build the submarines
for Taiwan, reportedly due to concerns about irritating Beijing.
</P>
<P>
The French shipbuilding group DCN and the Spanish Navantia Group
are jointly building Scorpio-class submarines for several countries,
including Chile, India and Malaysia, and Spain intends to transfer
part of that subs' technology for use in building a new type of S-80
submarine on its own.
</P>
<P>
The report said that the United States and Spain have been in
contact and want to cooperate, with Washington expressing the hope
that Spain can lower the price for construction of the S-80 class
subs in order to be able to sell them to Taiwan in the future.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper also reported that the Navantia Group signed a
contract with the U.S.-based Rockheed Martin Co. several months ago
to equip the S-80 submarines' central combat system.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, the paper said that the Spanish authorities
concerned have not yet confirmed any plans related to the export of
the S-80 submarines to other countries. The four S-80 subs currently
being built by the Navantia Group are all for the Spanish Navy.

CENTRAL GOVERNMENT'S EXPENDITURES FOR 2006 WILL NOT GROW: PREMIER
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Premier Frank Hsieh said Friday that his
administration will manage to keep the central government's
expenditures from increasing for the next fiscal year and that all
the spending will be for "the pursuit of individual, family,
community and national health."
</P>
<P>
The premier made the remarks when he led Finance Minister Lin
Chuan and Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics
Minister Hsu Chang-yao to report on the budget proposal for the
central government for 2006 and the government's special budget
proposal to expand public construction.
</P>
<P>
He said that government expenditures will be NT$1.5996 trillion
in 2006, while revenue will be NT$1.4039 trillion, which will all be
used to improve the government's finances so that the gap between
expenditures and revenue will be cut to NT$195.7 billion, or the
first time in seven years that the gap will be cut to under NT$200
billion.
</P>
<P>
Hsieh noted that world economic growth next year is expected to
be similar to this year's growth and that Taiwan's foreign trade will
maintain modest growth and that its economy will register growth of
3.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
He also said that he is cautiously optimistic about Taiwan's
economy for next year, noting that various sectors are expected to
maintain their competitive edge because of their investment in
research and development and production of high value-added products.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the government will actively promote and expand
public construction investment and flood-control projects in
flood-prone areas, he said.

Substantive bilateral engagement between
Taiwan and Russia will not be affected by the joint military drills
conducted by Russia and China recently, visiting Taiwan-Russia
Association President Chang Chun-hsiung said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Instead, Taiwan is demonstrating its sincerity in making friends
with Russia by signing more business contracts to further deepen
bilateral ties between the two countries, Chang said during a
cocktail party in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
The cocktail party was held to mark the signing of business
contracts worth an estimated US$300 million, including a contract
between Chinese Petroleum Corp. and the Russian Institute of
International Relations on a joint crude oil exploration project;
Taiwan Fertilizer Corp.'s purchase of urea (carbamide) from Russia;
and Ho Tung Chemical Co.'s procurement of crude oil.
</P>
<P>
Held prior to the contract signing ceremony was the third
Taiwan-Russian Cooperation Forum, in which the 20-member Taiwan trade
delegation headed by Chang exchanged views with officials from
Moscow's public agencies as well as private groups on plans to
promote bilateral exchanges and cooperation in energy resources
research, trade, economic development and financial reform between
Russia and Taiwan.

PRO-INDEPENDENCE ACTIVISTS UNVEIL 'NEW CONSTITUTION' DRIVE
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Sept. 30 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The 908 Taiwan Nation Movement, a local
pro-independence group, announced Friday that it will mobilize three
million people to form a human chain around Taiwan on Feb. 28, 2008
to push for passage of a new "Taiwan Nation Constitution."
</P>
<P>
Wang Hsien-chi, convener of the movement, told a news conference
that the 2004 "one million people human chain" activity helped
President Chen Shui-bian of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party
win re-election but that it failed to realize the goal of enacting a
new constitution for Taiwan and changing the nation's official title
from the "Republic of China" to "Taiwan."
</P>
<P>
"We now plan to hold an even larger-scale activity to drum up
support for our goal of writing a new constitution for Taiwan by
mobilizing three million people to join hands to form a circle around
Taiwan on Feb. 28, 2008 ahead of the next presidential election, "
Wang said, adding that the human chain activity will show the world
the Taiwan people's resolve to formulate a new constitution and
establish a new "Taiwan Nation."
</P>
<P>
Following the end of the human chain activity, Wang said, his
group will throw support behind the presidential candidate who
explicitly backs its cause and promises to implement the new
constitution if elected. The next presidential election is scheduled
to be held in March 2008.
</P>
<P>
Wang said since two pro-unification Taiwan opposition
heavyweights -- former Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Lien Chan and People
First Party Chairman James Soong -- made high-profile visits to China
earlier this year, more Taiwan people have leaned toward China.
</P>
<P>
Worse still, Wang said, the pro-China trend has become even more
evident after charismatic Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou succeeded Lien as
KMT chairman. Ma is widely seen as a shoo-in to win the 2008
presidential election.
</P>
<P>
Wang said his group will step up its "new constitution" campaign
with a view to keeping the pro-unification KMT from reclaiming the
nation's helm.

Taiwan will reduce its tuna fleet by
scrapping 120 ocean-going longliners within two years to help
conserve the world's tuna stocks and related resources, officials
from the Council of Agriculture (COA) announced Friday.
</P>
<P>
The government will spend US$4 billion (US$121.2 million) to

Fisheries Administration said.
</P>
<P>
Although Taiwan is not a United Nations member, the country is
resolute in supporting conservation measures called for by the U.N.
Food and Agriculture Organization's Committee on Fisheries in 1999 to
reduce fishing fleets that contribute to overfishing, the officials
said.
</P>
<P>
The decision has been made as Taiwan wants to do its duty as a
member of the global village, as well as to help secure sustainable
fishery resources for all, the officials added.
</P>

The scrapping of the boats will be mandatory and the vessels'
licenses will be repealed automatically, they said.

DPP CAUCUS WELCOMES REFERENDUM ON KRTS SCANDAL

<TEXT>
<P>
A leading member of the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) said Friday that he would welcome a
referendum proposed by an opposition People First Party (PFP)
legislator to deal with the Kaohsiung Rapid Transit System (KRTS)
scandal.
</P>
<P>
William Lai, DPP caucus convener at the Legislative Yuan, made
the remarks in response to PFP Legislator Chang Hsien-yao's remarks
that he will not exclude the possibility of holding a referendum or
raising a motion at the legislature to request the resignation of the
Cabinet to tackle the problems caused by the scandal.
</P>
<P>
The scandal, which has snowballed since a riot by Thai laborers
working for the KRTS last month, has become a hot topic between the
ruling and opposition parties at the legislature.
</P>
<P>
Criticising what he claimed is the KRTS' poor administration and
corruption, Chang also blamed the DPP for its defense of the scandal
and former Kaohsiung Mayor Frank Hsieh for failing to take
responsibility for overseeing the KRTS construction program.
</P>
<P>
Claiming that the scandal might cost the nation at least NT$20
billion, the legislator said that the "power of civic rights" must
intervene in the investigation of the scandal, adding that he will
also organize yet another investigation committee to probe the
matter.
</P>
<P>
In response, Lai said that referendum is the best way to put
civic rights into practice.

vocational school in the Panamanian town of Divisa as part of its
efforts to help its Central American ally equip its agricultural
sector with digital technology.
</P>
<P>
The digital training-oriented center was inaugurated Thursday at
a ceremony that saw the participation of Panamanian Minister of
Agricultural and Livestock Development Laurentino Cortizo Cohen, ROC
Ambassador to Panama Hou Ping-fu, as well as Ke Jyh-sheng, president
of the Taipei-based state-funded Institute for Information Industry.
</P>
<P>
The institute was commissioned to design and build the center, at
which experts from Taiwan will be stationed to help develop a
computer system for collecting agricultural information and train
seed information technicians.
</P>
<P>
Ke said he hopes the facility will inspire the country to
facilitate its development in the field of agriculture and other
sectors with digital equipment and knowledge.
</P>
<P>
The ROC has been helping Panama in agricultural and livestock
development through a technical mission that assists local farmers
with modern skills and know-how. In recent years, the ROC government
has tried to expand its assistance to other fields such as the
information sector, according to Ho.
</P>
<P>
Besides Panama, Belize and El Salvador are also listed in the
ROC's information assistance program, the ambassador said.

PREMIER DEFENDS ANOTHER BAILOUT FOR HIGH-SPEED RAIL SYSTEM
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Sept. 30 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Premier Frank Hsieh said Friday that the
"most important task" is to get Taiwan's first high-speed railway
launched as soon as possible and that an avalanche of problems could
occur if the project is suspended now because of funding problems.
</P>
<P>
The premier also said he will be "responsible for major policies"
and that he "supports the Taiwan High-Speed Rail Corp. (THSRC) not
because of THSRC Chairwoman Nita Ing but out of "concern for the
people."
</P>
<P>
Hsieh made the remarks amid media reports that Cho Jung-tai,
secretary-general of the Executive Yuan, admitted that Ing discussed
with him Tuesday the capital problem and that the government will
help the THSRC recruit an additional NT$7.5 billion to complete the
project.
</P>
<P>
Fielding questions in the Legislative Yuan after reporting on the
budget proposals for the central government for next fiscal year and
the special budget proposals for the "new 10 major construction
projects" program, the premier said that "all policy problems are
referred to me, and yes, I agreed to it."

</P>
<P>
The China Aviation Development Foundation (CADF) and the China
Technical Consultant, Inc. (CTCI) Foundation were instructed by the
Executive Yuan to provide NT$4.5 billion and NT$3 billion,
respectively, reports said.
</P>
<P>
Oliver F.L. Yu, vice minister of transportation and
communications, confirmed that the CADF has changed its charter to
allow for investment in major construction projects, including the
high-speed railway, while the CTCI Foundation board chairmen have
also passed the investment project.
</P>
<P>
The premier said that the investment by state-owned enterprises
or government-controlled enterprise for the high-speed rail is around
12 percent of its total paid-in capital, far less than legal
ceiling of government's investment in the project should not exceed
20 percent. The estimated NT$480 billion (US$14.77 billion) project
is Taiwan's first infrastructure project being built under the
build-operate-transfer (BOT) model.
</P>
<P>
He reaffirmed that the system is now 87 percent complete, and it
is not time to review whether the original plan was flawed, the
"important task is to get the system inaugurated as soon as
possible."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, opposition Kuomintang Chairman Ma Ying-jeou noted that
while the government claimed in the beginning that it would not spend
any money on the project, it has continued to funnel in money along
the way.
</P>
<P>
The high-speed rail construction project has deviated from the
spirit of the build-operate-transfer model, causing "all to lose
confidence in the project," Ma claimed.
</P>
<P>
Hwang Yih-jiau, a caucus whip of the opposition People First
Party, lashed out at the government for not valuing the taxpayers'
money.
</P>
<P>
PFP Legislator Chang Hsien-yao said the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party should no longer deter the formation of five
investigation committees, including one on the high-speed rail
system.
</P>
<P>
The DPP legislative caucus said that national construction should
be an across-the-party-spectrum task and that the "pan-blue alliance"
of the KMT and the PFP should not derail the high-speed rail project
via political means, "causing Taiwan to go bankrupt."
</P>
<P>
William Lai, a DPP caucus whip, said that since Ing announced her
support for President Chen Shui-bian during the 2000 presidential
election, she has become the target of bashing from the "pan-blue
alliance."
</P>
<P>
Lai also said that if the CADF could funnel its idle funds into
the system, it will help the smooth inauguration of the system next
year and will benefit the foundation, creating what he claimed will
be a win-win situation.
</P>
<P>
Ing announced last month that the launch of the railway will be
postponed for one year until Oct. 31, 2006.
</P>
<P>
She cited various factors, including the lack of progress in the
construction, system tests and operation preparations. She was
unwilling to identify where the faults lie but said that the Japanese
Shinkansen train system is "more complex" than expected.
</P>
<P>
Ing claimed, however, that she is confident of achieving the new
goal of launching the high-speed railway by October next year.
</P>
<P>
THSRC officials said construction of core mechanical and
electrical systems have lagged behind schedule by more than 30
percent, affecting system tests and operation preparations.
</P>
<P>
The 345-km high-speed railway linking Taipei in the north and
Kaohsiung in the south will form the backbone of western Taiwan's
mass rapid transportation network that it is claimed will reduce
travel time between Taipei and Kaohsiung to 90 minutes. The system
will connect eight metropolitan areas between Taiwan's two largest
cities and will be able to transport at least 300,000 passengers
daily when it becomes fully operational.

TYPHOON LONGWANG MAY HIT TAIWAN DIRECTLY SUNDAY
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei, Sept.  30 (CNA)
(By Han Nai-kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Strong Typhoon Longwang, whose center was
located about 1,100 km east of Taiwan at 5 p.m. Friday, may hit
Taiwan directly Sunday, according to a forecast by the Central
Weather Bureau (CWB).
</P>
<P>
The CWB said a sea warning for the typhoon is expected to be
issued Friday night or early Saturday morning.
</P>
<P>
The CWB forecast indicated that with a radius of 200 km,
Longwang, the 19th typhoon this year, is moving west at a speed of 19
kph, which is expected to increase to 23 kph Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The velocity of Longwang had gone over the threshold of a strong
typhoon by Thursday night, with center winds reaching 51 meters per
second, or 184 kph, and gusts of up to 63 meters per second.
</P>
<P>
Rain from Typhoon Longwang will begin to affect northern and
eastern Taiwan Saturday. If the strong typhoon continues moving in
its present direction, its radius will cover the whole of Taiwan
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
However, there is still a slight chance that high pressure in the
Pacific Ocean might cause the typhoon to veer from the predicted
course, according to the CWB forecast.

TAIWAN CHARITY GROUPS EXTENDING HUMANITARIAN RELIEF TO CAMBODIANS
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Poipet,   Cambodia,   Sept.  30  (CNA)
(By Hsu Yu-li and Deborah Kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Five Taiwan charitable
organizations are jointly offering humanitarian relief to the needy
in a poverty-stricken border town in northwestern Cambodia.
</P>
<P>
The "Love of Taiwan" delegation, comprised of members of the
Taiwan Roots Medical Peace Corps (TRMPC) , the Field Relief Agency
(FRA), Compassion International, the Eden Social Welfare Foundation
and the Noordhoff Craniofacial Foundation, arrived in Poipet, a town
on the border with Thailand, Sept. 25 to deliver their humanitarian
relief to the locals.
</P>
<P>
In two days, delegation members have offered free medical
services to more than 700 people in Poipet, many of whom are victims
of decades of bloodshed.
</P>
<P>
The delegation has brought with it some 600 kg of medication and
medical aid materials, including wheelchairs, crutches, walking aids
and white sticks for the blind, as many people in Poipet are victims
of landmines that were planted secretly there when Poipet was a war
zone.
</P>
<P>
Due to poverty and poor sanitary condition, many youths aged
around 15 in Poipet weigh only between 20kg-30 kg, while many men,
due to long-term coolie labor, suffer problems with their joints and
most women have gynecological problems, according to TRMPC medical
professionals.
</P>
<P>
In addition, a large number of Poipet residents suffer from sight
problems, some of whom have suffered eye problems since their
childhood, said an eye doctor with the TRMPC.
</P>
<P>
Sept. 26 was a "big day" for the Poipet locals, particularly the
children and youths, because the town's first high school was
inaugurated, thanks to FRA Secretary-General Yang Wei-ling's devotion
and compassion to the Cambodian people over past several years.
</P>
<P>
Yang, a flight attendant-turned-philanthropist who founded the
FRA seven years ago and has traveled to Cambodia at least twice each
year for humanitarian relief work, helped establish the high school,
the first of its kind in northwestern Cambodian, which is capable of
allowing more than 1,000 youths to attend school free of charge.
</P>
<P>
Yang managed to raise US$120,000 to build the school, which
offers junior and senior education for youths aged over 12.
</P>
<P>
Knowing that Cambodian teachers tend to give closer academic
attention to their students in paid after-school classes in order to
make extra money, Yang decided to pay the teachers at the high school
salaries twice or three times higher than ordinary levels, hoping
that they will focus their teaching on the new school.
</P>
<P>
Yang offered her gratitude to the Taiwan International Lions Club
300-A2 for a donation of US$80,000 to fund the hardware development
in the new school and to Compassion International for donating 18
standard blackboards ready to be installed in the school's 18
classrooms.
</P>
<P>
The FRA will finance 80 percent of the cost of maintaining the
school, including teachers' salaries, while Cambodia's education
authorities will finance the remaining 20 percent, according to Yang.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the FRA has also launched a campaign to have 500
bicycles donated to help children and youths in Poipet to go to
school.
</P>
<P>
The school is not the only institution Yang has helped establish
in Cambodia. She has established a library of Chinese books, all of
which have been transported from Taiwan. She has also founded an
orphanage and a vocational training center.
</P>
<P>
Believing that education is the best way to help people surmount
poverty, Yang has continued to build schools in Cambodia and she even
made the phrase, "Education changes a child's fate, " a motto of the
new school.

AD HOC TEAM TO BE FORMED TO COORDINATE HIGH-SPEED RAIL ISSUE: HSIEH
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Sept. 30 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Premier Frank Hsieh said Friday that the
Executive Yuan will form an ad hoc team to coordinate matters related
to the high-speed rail system.
</P>
<P>
The premier made the remarks during an interpellation session when
legislators' questions centered on reports that the Executive Yuan
has instructed two foundations to invest NT$7.5 billion (US$230.77
million) in the cash-strapped Taiwan High-Speed Rail Corp.
(THSRC) so that it can continue construction of the railway.
</P>
<P>
The team will handle such issues as possible difficulties of the
high-speed rail project, on THSRC Chairwoman Nita Ing's earlier
remarks that she will step down the day the system is inaugurated, on
whether to reorganize the board of directors, and the responsibility
of the original shareholders of the multi-billion dollar
project.
</P>
<P>
Noting that all the problems have been left over from past years,
Hsieh said that "as long as I'm the premier, I have to take
responsibility."
</P>
<P>
The premier also said the government will be more actively
involved in the project.
</P>
<P>
He said the China Aviation Development Foundation (CADF) , which
has been instructed to invest NT$4 billion according to reports, is
not "sending the THSRC the money for free" and will benefit from the
investment in the future.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the law stipulates that state-owned enterprises'
investment in the high-speed rail project should not top a ceiling of
20 percent of the THSRC's paid-in capital, but the government has
only invested around 12 percent so far because of the Legislative
Yuan's earlier resolution that the government should no longer invest
in the project.
</P>
<P>
The premier said that the CADF is not a state-owned enterprise,
which shows respect for the legislature's decision.
</P>
<P>
He said that although the government encourages private
investment, as the return of the system is slower, the recruiting of
funds has not been smooth.
</P>
<P>
The government's contract with the THSRC stipulates compulsory
buyout and if the construction of the system, which he claimed "is
now 87 percent complete, " is disrupted because of a shortage of
funds, he said the company will suspend work and the government will
have to pay NT$300 billion for the remaining 13 percent of the work,
which he said would not be worthwhile.
</P>
<P>
"Only avoiding the buyout of the system is in the best interest
of the people," he claimed.
</P>
<P>
The 345-km high-speed railway is the nation's first major
infrastructure project being built under the build-operate-transfer
system. The THSRC won the bid in September 1997 by promising that the
government would have to make "zero" investment in the project.

The 2005 Austronesian Forum opened in
Kaohsiung, southern Taiwan Friday, with local officials in charge of
indigenous affairs, officials and representatives from Austronesian
countries and scholars in Austronesian cultures in attendance.
</P>
<P>
The forum was the first international event of its kind that the
Kaohsiung City Government has hosted to boost friendships, exchanges
and cooperation of Austronesian indigenous peoples. Austronesian is a
family of languages widely dispersed throughout the islands of
Southeast Asia and the Pacific.
</P>
<P>
Austronesian, meaning "southern islands, " has 10 primary
subgroups, with nine of them found in Taiwan (the Formosan languages,
unrelated to Chinese) and one ancestral to all other members of the
family (Malayo-Polynesian languages).
</P>
<P>
The participants at the Kaohsiung forum include Icyang Parod, of
indigenous origin, who is vice minister of the Council of Indigenous
Peoples, Dr. Wes Heber of the Department of Indigenous Studies at the

Palau, the Marshall Islands and the Solomon Islands to the Republic
of China, and officials of the Australian Commerce and Industry
Office, the New Zealand Commerce and Industry Office and the Fiji
Trade and Tourism Representative Office on the island.

TAIWAN OBLIGED TO ASSIST CHINA TO RISE IN POSITIVE MANNER: PREMIER
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
New York,  Sept. 29 (CNA)
(By Lillian Lin and Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taiwan has an obligation to assist and
push China to rise in a positive manner, one that protects the human
rights of all Chinese people, ROC Premier Frank Hsieh wrote in an
article carried in the Thursday issue of the Wall Street Journal.
</P>
<P>
"As two of the world's ethnic Chinese societies, China and Taiwan
are not natural enemies, but cousins sharing deep historical and
cultural ties," Hsieh wrote.
</P>
<P>
However, Hsieh stressed that Taiwan is more than just one of the
world's Chinese societies.
</P>
<P>
"Taiwan is the first and only democracy among them. We,
therefore, have an obligation to assist and push China to rise in a
positive manner, one that protects and promotes the human rights of
all Chinese people," Hsieh wrote.
</P>
<P>
Quoting President Chen Shui-bian, Hsieh wrote that China's
emergence ought to be accompanied by a peaceful awakening and
democratic development, thereby creating opportunities rather than
risks for all humanity.
</P>
<P>
"We hope China's emergence can follow the path of peace and
democracy," Hsieh added.
</P>
<P>
Noting that a clash between Taiwan and China is not inevitable,
Hsieh wrote that the two sides of the Taiwan Strait still have the
chance to achieve reconciliation and coexist.
</P>
<P>
"Even when China appears to be at its most threatening, Taiwan
will continue to seek a win-win solution with China and not attempt
to contain or suppress China's legitimate rise, " Hsieh wrote, adding
that as long as China can respect Taiwan's existence, Taiwan has no
need to stand in the way of its rise.
</P>
<P>
On the 60th anniversary of the end of World War II, Hsieh wrote,
all Asian people prayed for the birth of a peaceful, democratic and
prosperous new Asia.
</P>
<P>
"In this new Asia, a democratic Taiwan, a peaceful China, and all
the other great Asian nations would coexist and rely on each other.
In this new Asia, the Taiwan Strait would be the conduit for peace,
not for war," Hsieh added.

REGISTRATION FOR YEAR-END ELECTIONS BEGIN
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Sept. 30 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Aspirants around the island for city and
county heads and councilmen as well as village and township heads
registered at local election commissions Friday on the first day of
registration for the Dec. 3 three-in-one elections.
</P>
<P>
The Central Election Commission said that the registration will
last until Oct. 4, and that if the approaching typhoon, Longwang, is
seriously affecting Taiwan at that time, registration will be
extended for another day.
</P>
<P>
Several candidates from the ruling Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) in the hotly contested city and county races chose to register
on the first day, hoping that would prove to be lucky.
</P>
<P>
In Taipei County, Luo Wen-jia, DPP candidate for Taipei County
magistrate, kept a low profile. He was accompanied by his wife,
Chiang Chao-yi, and a group of children and their mothers holding
sunflowers to the election commission, hoping to highlight his policy
of taking care of women and children.
</P>
<P>
In contrast, Chou Hsi-wei, the Kuomintang (KMT) candidate,
registered with a large throng of supporters around him, stressing
that if the KMT wins back the county magistrate after a 16-year
hiatus, it will go on to win the 2008 presidential election.
</P>
<P>
As the year-end elections are generally considered the first
major battle leading to the presidential election, many candidates,
irrespective of their party affiliation, have solicited well-known
figures to accompany them on their trips to register to boost their
popularity.
</P>
<P>
Cheng Kuei-yuan, DPP candidate for Hsinchu City mayor, was
accompanied by senior DPP Legislator Ker Chien-ming.
</P>
<P>
Cheng said that although Hsinchu is credited as being Taiwan's
silicon valley, its city development has stalled, and he vowed to
build it into a cultural and high-tech city.
</P>
<P>
The incumbent, Lin Cheng-tzer, said that his campaign theme of "a
garden city with peace and happiness, " will be a follow-up to his
"clean administration and construction" four years ago.
</P>
<P>
Cheng Pao-ching, DPP candidate for Taoyuan County head, who is
fighting an uphill battle against the incumbent, Chu Li-lun, was
accompanied to register by his campaign manager, Tsai Ing-wen, DPP
legislator and former chairwoman of the Cabinet-level Mainland
Affairs Council.
</P>
<P>
Cheng said that if he is elected, he will desalinate sea water
and take a multiple-approach to get water to solve the persistent
water shortage problem of the county.
</P>
<P>
"If I break my promises in two years, I'll step down to take
responsibility," he vowed.
</P>
<P>
Hsinchu County Magistrate Cheng Yung-chin, accompanied by a large
number of supporters, registered for reelection.
</P>
<P>
Cheng said that the approval rating of Hsinchu County tops all
cities and counties, and it has the lowest unemployment and misery
index, stressing that he will continue to work toward bettering the
economy and wellbeing of residents.
</P>
<P>
Chiu Ping-kun, DPP candidate for Miaoli County magistrate -- a
post that has long been dominated by the opposition "pan-blue
alliance" of the Kuomintang (KMT) and the People First Party (PFP) -- 
said that he is fighting an uphill battle, but he will continue to
work hard.
</P>
<P>
KMT Chairman Ma Ying-jeou also said Friday that the integration
of the KMT and the PFP on fielding candidates for the elections has 
encountered hurdles, citing the examples of Keelung City and Miaoli
County magistrates.
</P>
<P>
He said that KMT is sincere in wishing to integrate with the PFP,
but it has nominated Liu Cheng-hung, who led other aspirants by a big
margin in pre-nomination polls, and "the KMT doesn't have sufficient
reasons to dismiss him now."
</P>
<P>
The integration of the DPP and its ally, the Taiwan Solidarity
Union (TSU), has also hit snags.
</P>
<P>
Tainan Mayor Hsu Tien-tsai of the DPP and TSU candidate Chien Lin
Hui-chun both completed their registration for their candidacies for
the southern city head.
</P>
<P>
Chien Lin was accompanied by TSU legislators Lo Chi-ming and
Tseng Tsang-teng for the registration, saying that former President
Lee Teng-hui had urged her to come forward, and she made the decision
after a long deliberation.

New York Times:
Times Reporter Free From Jail; She Will Testify
Judith Miller, the reporter for The New York
Times who has been jailed since July 6 for
refusing to testify in the C.I.A. leak case, was
released Thursday from a Virginia detention
center after she and her lawyers reached an
agreement with a federal prosecutor in which she
would testify before a grand jury investigating
the case, the publisher and the executive editor
of the paper said.

Wall Street Journal: Credit Problem,
Battle Over Academic Standards Weighs On
For-Profit Colleges

For-profit colleges are booming. But a new
fight between these upstarts and the education
establishment raises a key question regarding
the acceptance of degrees from for-profits.
Traditional colleges rarely recognize the work
do ne by students at for-profits, arguing their
academic standards aren't high enough. So these
students often have to start over if they want
to go elsewhere to complete or advance their
studies. With growing concern over the rejection
of their students' work, the for-profit industry
is pushing a bill that would make it more
difficult for traditional colleges to reject 
course credits and degrees from their schools. It
is now pending before Congress as part of broader
higher-education legislation.

MA DENIES HE WILL HELP SPECIAL ARMS BUDGET BILL PASS
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei, Sept.  30 (CNA)
(By Han Nai-kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The chairman of the opposition Kuomintang
(KMT) denied speculation Friday that he is prepared to let the
long-stalled special arms procurement budget bill be listed on the
legislative agenda for review.
</P>
<P>
Ma Ying-jeou, who is also mayor of Taipei, made the denial when
asked to comment on an allegation by independent Legislator Li Ao
that Ma has instructed one of his deputies, John C. Kuan, to set up a
task force to study how to get the bill listed on the legislative
agenda.
</P>
<P>
Ma stressed that the decision on whether the bill should be put
on the agenda lies with the KMT's legislative caucus, which will have
to form a consensus on the issue.
</P>
<P>
Li, a noted writer who has written more than 100 books, returned
to Taiwan from a visit to China Friday. He vowed that he would make
retaliatory moves against the KMT if Ma should let the bill slip onto
the legislative agenda.
</P>
<P>
Another factor that makes the passage of the bill in the
legislature unlikely is the obstruction by another major opposition
party, the People First Party (PFP), which has vowed never to let the
bill pass the Procedure Committee.
</P>
<P>
The Procedure Committee has blocked the bill 30 times in more
than one year. The opposition lawmakers, who have a slight majority
in the legislature, said the requested budget of NT$610.8 billion is
too high and that the procurement should be funded through a regular
defense budget rather than a special budget.
</P>
<P>
The government led by the Democratic Progressive Party plans to
purchase eight diesel-electric submarines, a squadron of 12 P-3C
anti-submarine aircraft and six Patriot PAC III anti-missile
batteries from the United States.
</P>
<P>
There has been speculation that the KMT has softened its
opposition to the bill under pressure from the U.S. government and in
consideration of the fact that the Ministry of National Defence
agreed in September to list the financing for the Patriot
anti-missile batteries in the regular budget, causing the proposed
special budget in the bill to drop to NT$340 billion.

CHINA SHOULD ALLOW MORE JOURNALISTS TO WORK IN TAIWAN: MAC
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Chinese authorities should allow more
media around the mainland to sent their journalists to Taiwan to
report on different aspects and various fields, a spokesman for the
Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) said Friday.
</P>
<P>
MAC Vice Chairman You Ying-lung made the comment after China
announced that it would extend the stays of Taiwanese reporters in
China from one month to three months.
</P>
<P>
You explained that the move would do little to boost news
exchanges between the two sides across the Taiwan Strait, saying the
real meaning of media interactions is having a sufficient number of
reporters stationed in Taiwan to write stories covering a wide range
of fields and able to enhance mutual understanding of people on both
sides.
</P>
<P>
He urged Beijing to give the greenlight for the Guangzhou-based
Nanfang Daily and the Xinmin Evening News to post reporters to Taiwan
as part of its "sincere efforts" to conduct cross-strait press
exchanges in a positive manner.
</P>
<P>
Since Taiwan opened its door for the posting of Chinese
journalists to cover events on the island in 2000, it has hosted 361
reporters from China.

PRESIDENT CHEN IN  UAE FOR UNPRECEDENTED STOPOVER
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Abu  Dhabi,  Sept.  30 (CNA)
(By S. J. Tsai and Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Republic of China President Chen
Shui-bian arrived in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) capital of Abu
Dhabi Friday for a one-day transit stop on his way home after a
five-nation diplomatic tour to Central America and the Caribbean.
</P>
<P>
Sheikh Hamed Bin Zayed Al Nahyan, a younger brother of UAE
President Sheikh Khalifa Bin Zahed Al Nahayan, greeted Chen upon his
arrival in the oil-rich Middle East country.
</P>
<P>
The UAE gave President Chen a red-carpet welcome. Despite the
absence of formal diplomatic ties, ROC national flags were flown at
Abu Dhabi International Airport. All of Chen's entourage and
reporters were given courtesy treatment.
</P>
<P>
Sheikh Hamed Bin Zayed Al Nahyan hosted a dinner at the hotel
where Chen stays in honor of Chen and his entourage.
</P>
<P>
National Security Council Deputy Secretary-General Parris Chang
flew from Taipei to Abu Dhabi to meet with Chen and his entourage.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Foreign Affairs Tan Sun Chen, who is a member of the
president's entourage, said the president will discuss defense and
military cooperation with UAE authorities during his 29-hour layover.
</P>
<P>
President Chen will also discuss with UAE authorities other
matters of mutual concern, including promotion of tourist exchanges,
the opening of direct flight services between the two countries, the
relocation of Taiwan's representative office from Dubai to the UAE
capital of Abu Dhabi, and cooperation between Taiwan's state-owned
Chinese Petroleum Corp. and its UAE counterpart in oil exploration.
</P>
<P>
President Chen and his entourage are scheduled to return to
Taipei Oct. 2.
</P>
<P>
President Chen and his entourage flew from the East Caribbean
nation of St. Vincent and the Grenadines to the UAE for an
unprecedented transit visit. The UAE diplomatically recognizes
Beijing, but has maintained friendly substantive ties with Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Tan Sun Chen made a low-profile visit to the UAE in April this
year, and Sheikh Hamed Bin Zayed, who is in charge of UAE economic
affairs, visited Taiwan in June during which time he met with
President Chen.
</P>
<P>
President Chen was originally scheduled to make a transit stop in
San Francisco, but dropped the plan and flew directly from St.
Vincent and the Grenadines to the UAE.
</P>
<P>
St. Vincent and the Grenadines was the final leg of Chen's
five-nation, 13-day diplomatic tour to Central America and the
Caribbean, which also took him to Guatemala, the Dominican Republic,
Nicaragua, and the Federation of St. Kitts and Nevis. Chen and his
entourage had made a stopover in Miami, Florida en route to
Guatemala.

PFP, KMT FAIL TO COOPERATE IN ELECTIONS IN FOUR COUNTIES
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Sept.  30 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With the registration of candidates for
the year-end elections of city and county chiefs, city and county
councilors and chiefs of towns and urban townships formally beginning
Friday, the two opposition parties in the pan-blue bloc, the
Kuomintang (KMT) and People First Party (PFP), still can't agree how
or if to cooperate in some pivotal counties.
</P>
<P>
According to sources close to the two parties, the KMT and the
PFP failed to agree on one joint candidate in the year-end elections
of magistrates in four counties, and may give up attempts to
cooperate all together.
</P>
<P>
The sources said negotiations between the two parties on joint
candidates broke down almost from the start Thursday, when KMT
officials couldn't agree with the PFP's request to support a PFP
candidate in Miaoli County in return for its support for KMT
candidates in the counties of Hsinchu, Ilan and Changhua.
</P>
<P>
The PFP asked for the KMT's support in Miaoli which it considers
as its stronghold, but the KMT would not agree with the PFP's
proposal because its candidate for the magistrate of Miaoli County,
Liu Cheng-hung, insisted on staying in the race, stressing the
legitimacy of his nomination.
</P>
<P>
Liu, who was chosen through a primary by the KMT, went to KMT
headquarters asking for the party authorities' endorsement Thursday,
claiming that he was the party's legitimate candidate and should not
be sacrificed in political horsetrading.
</P>
<P>
Saying that KMT Chairman Ma Ying-jeou promised that the KMT would
back its members who were named through the proper mechanism as party
candidates, Liu asked the party authorities to reiterate their
support for him.
</P>
<P>
At the request of Liu, Liao Feng-teh, the director of the KMT's
Organization Affairs Committee, declared in public Thursday that it
is hard for the KMT to accept the PFP's proposal.
</P>
<P>
Disappointed by the KMT's outright rejection, PFP spokesman Hsieh
Kung-ping said it is a shame that the cooperation between the two
parties failed because the KMT can't settle its internal disputes.
</P>
<P>
However, in Lienchiang County, the KMT agreed to support current
Magistrate Chen Hsueh-shen, who is a PFP member, to seek reelection
in exchange for the PFP's support for KMT candidate Huang Ming-hui in
Chiayi.
</P>
<P>
The two opposition parties share the same supporters across the
country's 23 counties and cities and neither of them can win the
elections in most of the constituencies without the support of the
other.
