'PAN-GREEN' VOTE ALLOCATION COOPERATION WON'T BE PROBLEM: TSU OFFICIAL
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Nov.  1 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU) official
said Monday that there shouldn't be any problems in "pan-green camp"
cooperation in employing its vote allocation campaign strategy for
the year-end legislative elections.
</P>
<P>
TSU Secretary-General Lin Jih-jia said that he has contacted Lee
Ying-yuan, deputy secretary-general of the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP), over the matter and that the two of them
will discuss using the strategy in five constituencies in the near
future.
</P>
<P>
The "pan-green camp" of the DPP has long used the vote allocation
strategy with success to raise the number of its candidates elected
under the current multi-member district, single-vote electoral
system.
</P>
<P>
Lin said the "pan-green camp" could first cooperate in five
constituencies -- namely in Tainan, Taichung, Keelung and Hsinchu
cities, and the northern region of Kaohsiung City -- and then decide
later whether to expand the vote allocation strategy to other
constituencies.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the "pan-green camp" candidates in Tainan and
Taichung cities have begun joint campaigning operations and that
cooperation in the other three constituencies could begin immediately
as the election situation there is not too complicated.
</P>
<P>
Noting that "it is not important for the 'pan-green camp' to have
individual political stars, " Lin said that although vote allocation
might lead to some grievances among some candidates, the benefits to
them in the long run are greater.
</P>
<P>
A record high of 387 candidates have registered to run for seats
in the 225-seat Legislative Yuan. The DPP has the most candidates at
92, followed by the Kuomintang at 74, the People First Party at 41,
the TSU at 30 and the Non-Partisan Solidarity Union at 26.
</P>
<P>
President Chen Shui-bian, who doubles as the DPP chairman, has
set the goal of taking 100 legislative seats in the year-end
elections and thus command a comfortable majority with its ally the
TSU in the legislature.

TAIWAN VENTURES SEEK A-SHARE LISTING IN M'LAND CHINA
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Shanghai,  Nov.  1 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
More and more Taiwan companies or joint
ventures are seeking a domestic A-share listing on mainland China's
stock exchanges, mainly to raise funds to help them survive in the
fast-changing, increasingly competitive mainland market, a capital
broker said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan business operations have been forced to seek A-share
listing on the Shanghai Stock Exchange or the Shenzhen Stock Exchange
for a variety of reasons, including cash restraints as a result of
China's efforts to cool its overheated economy; difficulties in
acquiring funds from Taiwan; the appreciating mainland Chinese
currency; and mainland Chinese stocks' comparatively higher
price/earnings (P/E) ratios, according to Liu Fang-rong, CEO of the
Friendly Business Group.
</P>
<P>
Liu, whose firm operates financial consulting services in both
Taipei and Shanghai, said that first of all, mainland China's
measures to cool its economy have made life much harder for
mainland-based Taiwan companies in terms of obtaining loans and
borrowing cash.
</P>
<P>
Secondly, he continued, the mainland-based Taiwan companies have
experienced difficulties in securing funds from Taiwan due to
Taiwan's 40-percent ceiling policy aimed at controlling the amount of
Taiwan capital that flows into the mainland. This policy has also
dampened these companies' willingness to seek listing back on
Taiwan's stock market, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Thirdly, Liu added, the appreciating renminbi and its potential
to stay strong in the months and even years ahead is another
incentive spurring the Taiwan companies to seek A-share listing on
the mainland.
</P>
<P>
Mainland Chinese stocks' relatively higher P/E ratios -- higher
than those in Singapore, Hong Kong and Taiwan -- is the fourth factor
leading the Taiwan companies to seek listing on mainland stock
exchanges, Liu said.
</P>
<P>
Besides, he said, even though the mainland's P/E ratios are
relatively higher, they are currently at their lowest levels in eight
years, representing a golden opportunity for investors to return to
the market before a definite bottoming-out.
</P>
<P>
Liu offered his analysis in a column carried Monday on the Taiwan
Business Web site forum run by the Central News Agency.

TAIWAN EXPORTS TO TOP US$160 B. THIS YEAR: ECONOMICS MINISTER
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Nov. 1 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taiwan's exports are expected to top US$160
billion for 2004, marking the highest figure ever, Minister of
Economic Affairs Ho Mei-yueh said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the opening of the Fifth National Industrial
Development Conference, Ho said that 2004 has been a brilliant year
for Taiwan's economy, with both industrial production and export
trade expanding remarkably thanks mainly to the general recovery of
the world economy.
</P>
<P>
Quoting the latest report issued by the Council for Economic
Planning and Development (CEPD) , Ho said that Taiwan's economy
flashed a 10th consecutive yellow-red light in October, reflecting a
heating-up in the domestic economy according to a five-color rating
system. This is the best performance since 1994, Ho said.
</P>
<P>
According to the five-color rating system designated by the CEPD,
a red light indicates an overheated economy, yellow-red indicates a
heating up economy, green means steady growth, yellow-blue signals
sluggishness, and blue points to recession.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Ho said, Taiwan's economy posted a growth of 7.2
percent for the first half of this year, for the best performance
since 1997. During the period, industrial production registered a
growth of 15 percent, while investment from the private sector surged
a whopping 28.3 percent. It is estimated that investment from the
private sector will top NT$1.4 trillion (US$41.9 billion) for the
whole of 2004, she added.
</P>
<P>
However, Ho also said that Taiwan's economy still faces
challenges posed by political and economic variables at home and
abroad.
</P>
<P>
In addition, she said, Taiwan's manufacturing industries and
service industries -- the two major pillars of Taiwan's economy --
need to be upgraded structurally in order to increase Taiwan's
international competitiveness.
</P>
<P>
To catch up with the industrially-advanced countries, Taiwan must
seek breakthroughs on several fronts, including innovation, the
nurturing of talent, tax incentives, technology, and so on.
</P>
<P>
Solution policies that the Ministry of Economic Affairs has moved
to push include increasing government investment in and providing
government incentives for the development of the semiconductor,
telecommunications, nanotechnology and biotechnology industries, and
knowledge-based services, she added.

NATIONAL TASK FORCE OPENS TO WIPE OUT RED FIRE ANTS WITHIN 3 YEARS
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Nov. 1 (CNA)
(By Elizabeth Hsu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Council of Agriculture (COA) set up a
national task force Monday in Taipei to eliminate the infestations of
South American red fire ants within three years.
</P>
<P>
The National Red Fire Ant Control Center, located at the Center
for Biotechnology of the prestigious National Taiwan University
(NTU) , was officially inaugurated Monday by council Chairman Lee
Chin-lung, Ketagalan Institute President Lee Hong-hsi and Yang
Ping-shih, an NTU professor of entomology who is also director of the
new facility.
</P>
<P>
Lee said during a ceremony marking the inauguration that the new
center has been tasked to carry out the Cabinet's policy of tackling
the ant infestation in three years, with the help of experts and
scientists from research units of nationwide academic institutes
including Academia Sinica, NTU, National Chung Hsing University,
National Chiayi University and National Pingtung University of
Science and Technology.
</P>
<P>
The red ant control center's current tasks include monitoring and
reporting on the infestation, providing professional consultancy
and control services, conducting assessments of efforts to eliminate
the foreign insects, and organizing presentations around the island
to raise public awareness of the ants that entered Taiwan on cargo
ships from the United States.
</P>
<P>
According to the agriculture council's latest statistics, the red
fire ants have been found in agricultural and non-agricultural areas
around the country, with those in the counties of Taoyuan, Chiayi and
Taipei being the most affected.
</P>
<P>
The agriculture council chairman said 20,000 Kilograms of
insecticides have been prepared as well as liquid nitrogen to stop
the invasion of the South America-originated ants. However, he noted
that the red fire ant infestation is basically already under control.
</P>
<P>
Lee pointed out that 21 cities and rural townships, as well as 49
schools around the nation are currently in the "yellow light" state,
meaning that the fire ants are being exterminated.
</P>
<P>
The code is part of a light rating system, similar to a traffic
light, set up by the new ant control center to show the seriousness
of a red fire ant colony in a particular location, with red
indicating the discovery of the insects but no action having been
taken; yellow indicating that ants are currently being exterminated;
and green indicating that the foreign insects have been eradicated.
</P>
<P>
However, Lee urged farmers not to deal with the red fire ants by
themselves when discovering a colony. He warned that any careless
move to disturb the ant colony will result in a wider infestation.
</P>
<P>
The official said the method of freezing the fire ants with
liquid nitrogen that was developed by a team from Academia Sinica has
proved to be able to eradicate the ants in an effective and
environmentally friendly way.

Although no any SARS case has been reported anywhere in the world
this fall, the spokesman said that the CDC is on a high alert against
the spread of the potentially deadly disease by requiring visitors
coming from mainland China, Hong Kong and Macau to fill a
questionnaire upon their arrival and conduct self-health management
by having their temperatures taken for 10 days in a row.
</P>
<P>
In line with the move, the CDC asked personnel and medical
staffers at countrywide nursing homes, halfway houses and residences
for the disabled across the country to report to health authorities
if they find anyone with symptoms, such as fever, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The CDC also encouraged kindergartens and elementary and junior
high schools to fully abide by a rule of having children with a fever
to stay at home, he added.
</P>
<P>
According to a SARS response level designated by an
inter-ministerial SARS Committee, the current "0" SARS response level
imposed by the CDC refers to a situation in which no cases have been
reported globally.
</P>
<P>
The response level will be lifted to "A" by the DOH when the
world's first confirmed case is reported.
</P>
<P>
A "B" level signals a situation in which the first confirmed case
of primary transmission is reported at home, while a "C" level points
to a development when the first confirmed case and a secondary
transmission are reported domestically. The SARS Committee will be in
charge of all arrangements at the "B "and "C"response levels.

NUMBER OF TAIWAN TRADING COMPANIES GROWS: BOFT
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  No.  1 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The number of trading companies in Taiwan
grew by 23 percent over the past decade, with their average business
volumes increasing by 36 percent, according to statistics compiled by
the Bureau of Foreign Trade (BOFT).
</P>
<P>
BOFT statistics show that there were 88,978 trading companies in
Taiwan in 1993, with an average business volume of US$1.82 million
for that year. The number of trading companies rose to 109,446 in
2003, with an average transaction turnover standing at US$2.47
million last year.
</P>
<P>
In 1993, the country's top 100 trading companies generated US$43
billion worth of business, or 26 percent of the country's overall
export and import trade, according to the same tallies. But the ratio
rose to 39 percent in 2003 recording a value of US$105.3 billion.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, performance and space of Taiwan's small
trading firms were further squeezed. Small trading companies, around
90 percent in the sector in 2003, an increase compared to 82 percent
in 1993, did only 10 percent of the business.
</P>
<P>
According to a BOFT analysis, large manufacturing companies
generated most of the business for Taiwan's foreign trade sector over
the past 10 years. Taiwan trading firms should shift their focus to
service-oriented businesses to play a bigger role in the world's
</P>
<P>
system of labor division and help foreign companies better
explore the domestic market, BOFT officials said.

LIEBERTHAL ARRIVES IN  TAIWAN FOR FOUR-DAY VISIT
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Nov.  1 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Kenneth Lieberthal, former United States
National Security Council's Senior Director for Asian Affairs,
arrived in Taiwan Monday for a four-day visit.
</P>
<P>
Reports noted that Lieberthal, a professor of political science
at the University of Michigan and a supporter of U.S. Senator John
Kerry, comes just 48 hours from the heated U.S. presidential election
on Nov. 2.
</P>
<P>
Lieberthal, at the invitation of the Mainland Affairs Council,
will attend a seminar on grassroots democracy in mainland China held
at the Institute of International Relations at National Chengchi
University Nov. 2-3 and deliver a speech. Also attending will be MAC
Chairman Joseph Wu and other scholars.
</P>
<P>
Lieberthal may meet President Chen Shui-bian during his stay in
Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Lieberthal, a China-hand who proposed the idea of an "interim
agreement" in which Taipei and Beijing would sign on to the concept
of "one China" but would put off the idea of unification for 50
years, amended his view earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
Lieberthal co-wrote a story with David Lampton, director of China
studies at the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International
Studies, to promote the idea of "establishing a stable framework
across the Strait for a long period -- counted not in years but in
decades.'
</P>
<P>
The story, which appeared in the Washington Post in April, said
that for such a framework to be effective, all sides must agree on
its fundamentals and its minimum duration, and they must seek the
support of the international community in reinforcing it.
</P>
<P>
Under such an arrangement, Taiwan could continue to assert its
sovereign status, but would take the additional step of turning de
facto independence into de jure independence.
</P>
<P>
While the mainland could continue to assert that there is only
"one China" of which Taiwan is a part, it would have to give up its
threat of using force to change Taiwan's status.

CHINESE AWARD-WINNING WRITER MAY VISIT TAIWAN SOON
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Nov. 1 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The author of the memoir, "The Past Doesn't
Disappear Like Smoke, " which won an award from the literary
organization PEN for independent Chinese-language writers Oct. 30,
will probably visit Taiwan in late November or early December to
promote her book, sources from China Times Publishing said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Yihe, the author of the vivid account of her personal
perspective on the heart-rending history and political upheavals in
modern China since the building of the People's Republic of China,
received the PEN award in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
PEN, a collection of poets, playwrights, essayists, editors and
novelists was formed in 1921 to promote cooperation among writers.
</P>
<P>
Zhang is the daughter of Zhang Bojun, one of the first ministers
of Mao Zedong's "new China" government, who later was persecuted as
the "No. 1 rightist" in Communist China.
</P>
<P>
The book, first published in Beijing in January this year, became
a hot after item soon after Beijing announced a ban on it because the
authorities did not like what she reminisced about the Chinese
Communists during the Mao era.
</P>
<P>
Pirated copies of the book have been selling briskly around
mainland China ever since.
</P>
<P>
Taipei-based China Times Publishing has recently published a
Taiwan edition of the memoir, making it the third of its kind since
Zhang's memoir written in simplified Chinese characters was published
in Beijing last year. The original copy appeared with many lines
deleted or censored.
</P>
<P>
The second edition was published by Oxford University Publishing
in Hong Kong sometime this year under the title, "The Last Noble." It
recovered most of the missing sections and sentences.
</P>
<P>
The Taiwan edition, or the China Times version, comes with the
original title, "The Past Doesn't Disappear Like Smoke, " with
tradition Chinese characters and is a complete, unabridged version,
the most "wholesome" version of the memoir, according to China Times
Publishing management.
</P>
<P>
Academia Sinica tried to invite Zhang to Taiwan for a visit, but
the invitation hit a snag for unknown reasons.
</P>
<P>
Zhang was the second mainland Chinese citizen to receive the PEN
award for independent Chinese writers. Her predecessor was Wang
Lixiong for his book, "Yellow Peril."

FORGED GREENBACK COUNTERFEITER BUSTED IN TAIWAN
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Nov. 1 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A counterfeiter with a long criminal record
for banknote forgery was busted in Sanchung, Taipei County Monday for
counterfeiting US$100 banknotes, the Investigation Bureau reported.
</P>
<P>
Koo Chuan-chen, 52, a criminal on parole, was arrested red-handed
early Monday at his print shop, where investigators discovered
US$140,000-worth of faked, finished US$100 notes and some US$3
million-worth of semi-finished notes.
</P>
<P>
The suspect admitted that he planned to trade his notes at a
price equivalent to one-tenth of their face value.
</P>
<P>
Based on that, the police estimated that the forged bills would
have fetched some NT$100 million for Koo.
</P>
<P>
Koo said he chose to counterfeit notes with a DF prefix to the
serial number instead of notes with a CB prefix because most of the
CB bills are rejected by Taiwan banks, even though they are genuine
bills issued by banks in the United States.
</P>
<P>
Koo, who has been in the printing business since he was around 20
years old, was previously sentenced to a 17-year jail term for
forging NT$1,000 bills. He was released on parole late last year
after serving one-third of his time.
</P>
<P>
Supposedly unable to find a job, Koo began to make molds in April
this year to forge US$100 greenbacks.

If President Chen Shui-bian and mainland
Chinese President Hu Jintao could meet for discussions, it would be
the most direct way to resolve cross-Taiwan Strait problems, the
president of Taiwan's most prestigious research body, Academia
Sinica, said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Lee Yuan-tseh, who is also a Nobel laureate, has been appointed
by President Chen Shui-bian to represent him at the informal summit
of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum slated to take
place Nov. 20 in Chile. He made the remarks while answering questions
during a legislative committee meeting.
</P>
<P>
Lee said he is not sure whether or not he will have an
opportunity to contact Hu during the Chile leadership meeting,
although he had brief talks in private with the mainland leader on
the occasion of a APEC meeting last year.
</P>
<P>
However, he told legislators that without careful arrangement, it
might not be easy to have talks on any cross-strait issues, but he
expressed hope that there will one day be an opportunity for Chen and
Hu to talk.
</P>
<P>
Asked if he would be willing to serve as a convener of
cross-strait negotiations, Lee said that "this is not what I do."

VP CALLS FOR PRIVATE SECTOR PARTICIPATION IN DEFENSE INDUSTRY
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Nov.  1 (CNA)
(By Huang Kwang-chun)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Vice President Annette Lu called on the
private sector Monday to participate in the defense industry
development to help strengthen the nation's defense capabilities.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a defense industry forum organized by the Ministry of
National Defense along with the 2004 Reserve Duty Research and
Development Achievements Exhibition being held in Taipei, Lu said
that the participation in the reserve duty program of the private
sector, particularly the technology industry, is very important to
the country's defense industry development.
</P>
<P>
In the face of mainland China's growing military buildup that
poses a serious threat to Taiwan's security, Lu said, Taiwan can only
maintain cross-Taiwan Strait peace by obtaining sufficient defense
capabilities.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan is a major country in terms of the development of advanced
technology and the government is conducting nine programs for
technology development classified as being on a national scale.
</P>
<P>
Based on common use by the military and civilian sectors, Lu
noted, more than 12,000 individuals have contributed their expertise
to the country's defense industry development since the defense
industry reserve duty system was established in 1980.
</P>
<P>
The defense industry reserve duty program is aimed at supplying
sufficient skilled labor for the research and development of weapons.
</P>
<P>
The exhibition opened Oct. 29 with the participation of more than
1,000 organizations and units wishing to demonstrate the promising
results of applying the private sector's R&amp;D resources to the defense
industry. It will run through Nov. 2.

STRUGGLING LEGISLATIVE ASPIRANTS IN 'HIGH-RISK' GROUP FOR GRAFT
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Nov. 1 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Justice Minister Chen Ding-nan said Monday
that legislative aspirants who are struggling to be elected are in a
"high-risk" group in terms of likelihood of resorting to bribery and
that they will be the main target of ongoing anti-graft operations.
</P>
<P>
Chen made the remarks after he and Wu Ying-chao, state public
prosecutor-general, unveiled the plaque of an anti-graft task force
at the State Public Prosecutor-General's Office, to prepare for the
Dec. 11 legislative elections.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the year-end elections will be extremely fierce as it
will be last elections using the multi-seat, one vote system, he said
the law enforcement authorities have reason to believe that those who
are struggling on the threshold of being elected could attempt to use
bribery to ensure victory.
</P>
<P>
A record 387 legislative aspirants have registered to vie for a
seat in the 225-member Legislative Yuan, but from the next
legislature on, the number of seats will be halved.
</P>
<P>
Also, the election system for legislators will be changed to a
"single seat, two votes" system, meaning that there will be one
winner in each of the smaller constituencies, with voters given one
vote for the election candidate and one for the political party they
support.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the statement issued by the Prosecutors'
Association that the association members do not want to claim
anti-graft cash awards, Chen expressed admiration, but said that the
measure will continue.
</P>
<P>
Chen explained that the cash award for prosecutors and citizens
is different, noting that a citizen reporting bribery can claim half
of the cash award of NT$5 million (US$149,700) if a prosecutor
establishes a case and files a suit. If the first trial results in a
conviction, the citizen can then claim the remaining half.
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors, however, can only claim the first half of the cash
after the first ruling and the remaining half after the final ruling.

EXECUTIVE YUAN SUES KMT-HELD RADIO STATION FOR RETURN OF LAND
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Nov.  1 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a move signaling its resolve to demand
that the opposition Kuomintang (KMT) return national property that
the Cabinet alleges was embezzled by the main opposition party, the
Executive Yuan sued a KMT-held affiliate Monday for the return of
national land.
</P>
<P>
Executive Yuan spokesman Chen Chi-mai made the announcement at a
news conference after a group of lawyers commissioned by the
Executive Yuan filed a civil suit against the KMT-controlled
Broadcasting Corporation of China (BCC) at the Panchiao District
Court, seeking the return of eight plots of BCC-held land in Panchiao
City in accordance with the Civic Code and relevant laws.
</P>
<P>
Chen said that the government has repeatedly tried to settle the
issue with the KMT through negotiations, but KMT Chairman Lien Chan
has refused to discuss the issue.
</P>
<P>
The group of lawyers launched the lawsuit in the name of the
Ministry of Transportation and Communications (MOTC) and the former
Directorate-General of Telecommunications -- the predecessor of the
now privatized Chunghwa Telecom Co., Ltd. -- requiring the Panchiao
District Court to rescind the BCC's registration as owner of the
eight land plots, valued at NT$1.053 billion (US$31.4 million).
</P>
<P>
According to lawyer Lin Yung-sung, the eight land lots were
national territory originally under registration of the then
Directorate-General of Telecommunications and the Directorate-General
of Posts affiliated to the MOTC.
</P>
<P>
But the BCC became the administrator of the land June 5, 1981 and
according to official documents, it further turned out to be the
land's owner Aug. 5, 1985 through a registration of ownership
transfer, Lin pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Lin claimed that the BCC did not pay to acquire the land and he
demanded that the KMT return what he called the inappropriately
obtained national property to the country.
</P>
<P>
The legal battle comes at a time when the "pan-green camp" led by
the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) is striving to win a
majority in the next Legislative Yuan against the opposition
"pan-blue alliance" led by the KMT as the Dec. 11 legislative
elections approach.
</P>
<P>
What the DPP calls "improperly obtained national assets of the
KMT" is always a high-profit target of the DPP against the main
opposition party at election time.

representatives from the government, academic and industrial sectors
taking part.
</P>
<P>
Focusing on the meeting's theme of industrial innovation in the

Strategies can be devised on a wide range of fronts, including
stepping up exchanges of talent with mainland China, lndia and
countries in Eastern Europe, and revising the current military
service law to lure more reserve duty officers with national defense

</P>
<P>
They also suggested that a free flow of specialists among the

TAIWAN EXPORTS SUBJECT TO 14 ANTI-DUMPING INVESTIGATIONS FROM JAN-JUNE
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Geneva, Nov. 1 (CNA)

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taiwan ranked second among all countries and
customs territories in terms of the number of anti-dumping
investigations initiated against its exports in the first half of
this year, according to World Trade Organization (WTO) statistics
released Monday.
</P>
<P>
A total of 14 anti-dumping investigations were initiated by other
WTO members against Taiwan exports in the Jan.-June period. Mainland
China's exports topped the list with 23 investigations, up from 17
for the same period the previous year, according to the statistics.
</P>
<P>
Sixteen WTO members initiated a total of 101 anti-dumping
investigations in the first half of 2004, up slightly from the 98
initiated for the same period a year earlier. A total of 23 countries
or customs territories encountered anti-dumping investigations
against their exports.
</P>
<P>
The United States led with 21 anti-dumping investigations
initiated during the first half of 2004, followed by the European
Union and Turkey, with 13 investigations each. Mainland China
initiated 11 investigations during the same period.
</P>
<P>
The largest number of anti-dumping investigations initiated
during the Jan.-June involved products classified in the base metals
sector, at 20 investigations, followed by the chemicals and plastics
sector at 18, and the textiles sector at 15, according to the
statistics.
</P>
<P>
During the period, 18 WTO members imposed a total of 52 "final
anti-dumping measures" against exports from 24 countries or customs
territories, representing a significant decline from the 114 final
anti-dumping measures imposed for the same period a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
Mainland China once again topped the list in terms of the number
of final anti-dumping measures imposed against its exports at 16.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, the WTO said the same day that "the statistics are
based on information from WTO members having submitted semi-annual
reports to the WTO anti-dumping committee for the relevant periods,
and are incomplete to the extent that members have not submitted
reports or have submitted incomplete reports."

DIPLOMATIC STRAITS TO BE WEIGHED IN CAL PRIVATIZATION DRIVE: YU
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Nov.  2 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Premier Yu Shyi-kun said Tuesday that the
government policy of privatizing state-owned enterprises will remain
unchanged, but he added that the nation's diplomatic predicament will
be taken into account in privatizing China Airlines (CAL).
</P>
<P>
Yu made the remarks after Minister of Transportation and
Communications Lin Ling-san said a day earlier that the government
will review its policy of privatizing China Airlines, Taiwan's
largest air carrier, because Taiwan must have a national carrier.
Lin's statement has caused concern about the possibility of the
government making an about-face regarding its privatizing policy.
</P>
<P>
Yu said the government will not backpedal on its privatization
policy because continuity and consistency have been important
elements in its policy formulation.
</P>
<P>
"The government will do its utmost to privatize all state-owned
enterprises in line with its established policy," Yu said.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, he said, the government has to work out a special
schedule and formula for the CAL privatization in consideration of
Taiwan's diplomatic constraints caused by Beijing's unrelenting
efforts to suppress the island in the international arena.
</P>
<P>
Over the years, Yu said, China Airlines has offered convenient
flight services for outbound Taiwan citizens. In view of mainland
China's diplomatic embargo against Taiwan, he said, the government
must conduct a careful review of the situation before fully
privatizing the carrier.

CHICAGO, Illinois -- A survey conducted by the

<P>
With the U.S. presidential race in the home
stretch, the Minisry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) said Tuesday it has
formed a special task force to monitor the latest developments in the
U.S. political arena.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a regular news conference, MOFA deputy spokeswoman
Anna Kao said Minister of Foreign Affairs Tan Sun Chen himself serves
as convener of the special task force whose members include Vice
Minister of Foreign Affairs Michael Ying-mao Kau and officials of
relevant MOFA departments.
</P>
<P>
"The special task force has been closely monitoring the
developments in the U.S. presidential race and will keep close
contact with a similar election watch team at our representative
office in Washington, D.C., " Kao said, adding that the task force
will also maintain contact with key members of both the Republican
and Democratic campaign headquarters.
</P>
<P>
Kao said the MOFA will come up with a comprehensive report on the
possible developments in Taiwan-U.S. relations in the wake of the
election in terms of either the re-election of President George W.
Bush or the victory of his challenger, Sen. John Kerry of the
Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
The report will also outline the Republic of China representative
office's future work agenda and prospects, Kao said.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, he said, the MOFA has prepared two different
congratulatory message versions. When the U.S. election outcome is
announced, the MOFA will direct the ROC representative to the United
States, David Ta-wei Lee, to forward the congratulatory message to
the U.S. government, he said.
</P>
<P>
In preparation for possible changes in U.S. personnel in charge
of Taiwan affairs in the wake of the presidential election, Kao said,
the MOFA has begun efforts to understand and develop contacts with
influential members of both the Bush and Kerry camps.

TAIWAN-U.S. RELATIONS WILL BE SOLID AFTER NOV. 2 ELECTION: PREMIER

<P>
The fundamentals between Taiwan and the
United States are good, and the outcome of the U.S. presidential
election will not affect Taipei-Washington relations, Premier Yu
Shyi-kun said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The premier made the remarks while fielding questions at a
general question and answer session at the Legislative Yuan.
</P>
<P>
Yu said that it would be inappropriate for Taiwan to comment on
the U.S. election, adding that Taiwan has always maintained good
relations with the United States, and this will not change regardless
who the next president is.
</P>
<P>
Touching on recent remarks regarding Taiwan by U.S. Secretary of
State Colin Powell, the premier said that the U.S. State Department
has clarified his words inasmuch as when Powell advocated cross-
strait "reunification" as a goal that both sides desire, he actually
meant a "settlement."
</P>
<P>
In addition, the premier said Powell had spoken positively of
Taiwan during his recent Asian visit, including continuing arms sales
to Taiwan despite pressure from mainland China, and telling mainland
Chinese leaders to seize the opportunity for negotiations that
President Chen Shui-bian made during his May 20 second inauguration
address to resume bilateral dialogue.

LAWMAKER ASKS KMT TO APOLOGIZE AND REPAY MONEY TO BANK OF TAIWAN
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei, Nov. 2 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU) on Tuesday
asked the Kuomintang (KMT) to apologize to the public and return the
money it owes the Bank of Taiwan, while the KMT said the delay in
repayment has been caused by its dire financial straits.
</P>
<P>
TSU Legislator Chen Chien-ming noted that KMT officials have long
been able to enjoy a premium 18 percent deposit rate at the Bank of
Taiwan, with the KMT paying 16.5 percent of the interest and the bank
paying the other 1.5 percent. However, as the party has not been
remitting the money for the 16.5 percent interest payments to the
bank since the March 20 presidential election, it now owes the bank
an accumulated NT$300 million (US$8.64 million) for the KMT
officials' deposits.
</P>
<P>
Chen questioned why the KMT officials enjoy such a premium
deposit rate when the average citizen only gets a deposit rate of
around 1.5 percent for a one-year term deposit. He urged the KMT to
face the issue squarely, apologize to the people soon, and return the
due interest payments.
</P>
<P>
In response to reports that the Bank of Taiwan plans to seek
repayment from the KMT and to terminate its contract with the party,
a KMT official said it is still actively coordinating with the bank
on repaying the money.
</P>
<P>
Lin Yung-jui, deputy director of the KMT administrative
management committee, said the party is still discussing with the
bank on how to repay the money, adding that there are no plans to
terminate the contract.
</P>
<P>
Liu Chien-sung, president of the KMT workers guild, said the
party, in order to take care of party officials who retired before
Feb. 28, 1997, signed a contract with the Bank of Taiwan to allow the
retirees the same premium treatment given by the government to
retired servicemen, civil servants and teachers, meaning an 18
percent deposit rate for deposits of up to NT$1.8 million.
</P>
<P>
Liu said that the NT$300 million is only the "tip of the iceberg"
of the party's financial difficulties, noting that the KMT officials
who retired in August have yet to get their retirement payments,
while those who retired in September were asked to wait for the
payments, with no interest payments during the waiting period.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the TSU also pointed out the problem of the veterans
over claiming subsidies for up to NT$12.2 billion over a period of
more than a decade.
</P>
<P>
Due to negligence on the part of Veterans Affairs Commission
(VAC) officials, Legislator Chen Chien-ming said 6,700 veterans who
are not qualified to claim subsidies have received a monthly stipend
of NT$13,550, or around NT$180,000 a year for more than 10 years,
resulting in losses amounting to NT$12.2 billion to the national
coffers.
</P>
<P>
Chen asked the VAC to review the situation, seek to return the
money, and punish the negligent officials over the matter.
</P>
<P>
In response, the VAC said that the veterans that are put on the
list to receive subsidies for 2005 has already been cut.
</P>
<P>
VAC officials said that with veterans aging and passing away, and
with some others who no longer require subsidies due to the
improvement of their lives, the number of veterans who will be on the
subsidized list will be 98,000 in 2005, down 6,700 from 2004.
</P>
<P>
The officials said the commission regularly checks the status of
the veterans and will stop subsidies once their lives are improved.
The VAC will ask local veteran service centers and nursing homes to
step up verification of the conditions of the veterans.

STABILITY IS TOP PRIORITY IN CROSS-STRAIT TIES: LIEBERTHAL
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Taiwan and mainland China should make
stability their current top priority and put aside the pursuit of a
"peaceful resolution" of cross-strait disputes for the future, a
visiting former senior White House official said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Kenneth Lieberthal, former Senior Director for Asia of the
National Security Council, made the remarks during an interview with
Taiwanese media, after attending a symposium in Taipei on grassroots
democracy on the mainland. Lieberthal is now one of the top aides to
Democratic presidential candidate John Kerry.
</P>
<P>
Lieberthal said long-lasting peace and stability should be the
main topic for discussion in the case of resumption of cross-strait
dialogue.
</P>
<P>
However, with the large number of disagreements existing between
both sides, they should prioritize the quest for stability by
building up mutual trust and increasing exchanges, Lieberthal said.
</P>
<P>
Without mutual trust, it would be impossible for both sides to
reach a "peaceful resolution" on their political disputes, according
to Lieberthal.
</P>
<P>
He again proposed that Taipei and Beijing sign an interim
agreement for maintaining the status quo of cross-strait relations
for 50 years to pave the way for further negotiations on disputed
issues.
</P>
<P>
He said the United States is obliged by the Taiwan Relations Act
to provide Taiwan with defensive weapons against possible invasion
from the mainland, and Washington will respect the decision by Taipei
and Beijing if they are able to reach an agreement on security
issues.

The European Chamber of Commerce Taipei

</P>
<P>
Hu Sheng-cheng, chairman of the Cabinet-level Council for

during a meeting with an ECCT delegation led by Chairman Paul Zeven.
</P>
<P>
Zeven submitted a proposal report to Hu thanking the Taiwan

'PEACE AND STABILITY FRAMEWORK' SIMILAR TO INTERIM PACT: MAC
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei, Nov. 2 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The concept of establishing a dynamic "peace
and stability framework" for interactions across the Taiwan Strait is
similar to that of signing a cross-strait interim agreement, Mainland
Affairs Council (MAC) Chairman Joseph Wu said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Wu made the remarks in a keynote speech delivered at an
international symposium on grassroots democracy in mainland China,
organized by the Institute of International Relations at National
Chengchi University.
</P>
<P>
According to Wu, the proposal of forging a viable "peace and
stability framework" for cross-strait interactions broached in
President Chen Shui-bian's second inaugural address is similar to that
of signing a cross-strait interim accord advocated by Kenneth
Lieberthal, a U.S. political science professor who once served as
senior director for Asia at the National Security Council.
</P>
<P>
The nation's top mainland policy planner said Taiwan intensely
hopes the two sides of the Taiwan Strait can resume dialogue on
non-political issues and mutually beneficial topics to forge a
cooperative rather than confrontational relationship and create an
environment conducive to the establishment of a dynamic "peace and
stability framework" for bilateral interactions.
</P>
<P>
Noting that Taiwan has been endeavoring to establish an
accountable and efficient political system, Wu said smooth regular
political elections indicate that Taiwan has become a liberal
democracy.
</P>
<P>
Wu said Taiwan has continued pursuing measures to enhance its
governing efficiency, including a constitutional re-engineering plan.
The legislative reform program passed by the Legislative Yuan in
August was part of the constitutional re-engineering plan, Wu said,
adding that he hopes the United States can understand Taiwan's
efforts to deepen and consolidate its young democracy.
</P>
<P>
"Taiwan has been inspired by the United States to develop a
democratic system and we hope to catch up with the United States in
democratic development," Wu said.
</P>
<P>
However, Wu said, Taiwan's "democracy-deepening" drive is facing
challenges from mainland China. "We look forward to holding direct
dialogue and consultations with mainland China without setting any
prerequisites or premises so as to foster mutual understanding and
trust," he added.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on the same occasion, Lieberthal, who arrived in Taipei
Monday for a four-day visit, said mainland China has not been
democratized but nor is it a completely totalitarian regime. From
Taiwan's and South Korea's experiences, Lieberthal said, mainland
China will eventually move toward democratization if it can continue
economic liberalization and openness.
</P>
<P>
In his view, Lieberthal, now a professor of political science at
the University of Michigan, said mainland China should not regard
global interdependence as a threat and should instead take it as an
opportunity.

President Chen Shui-bian's proposal to
introduce a "new version of the Constitution" could be attained
either through amending the existing Constitution or drafting a
completely new one, Premier Yu Shyi-kun said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking during an interpellation session at the Legislative
Yuan, Yu said the constitutional re-engineering project will be
carried out in accordance with President Chen's second inaugural
address on May 20.
</P>
<P>
If the reform is to be achieved via a referendum, the
Constitution must first be amended to include referendums as a method
for constitutional reform, Yu said.
</P>
<P>
In his second inaugural address, Chen said he hopes to hand to
the people of Taiwan and the country "a new version of our
Constitution" by the time he completes his presidency in 2008.
</P>
<P>
Chen said the government will follow the rules set out in the
existing Constitution and its amendments while carrying out the plan.
</P>
<P>
After proposed amendments are passed by the Legislative Yuan,
members of the ad hoc National Assembly will be elected and charged
with the task of ratifying the proposed amendments, according to
Chen's proposal.
</P>
<P>
The proposed amendments will cover one aimed at abolishing the
National Assembly itself and incorporating into the Constitution the
people's right to referendums on constitutional amendments.

ARMS PROCUREMENT BILL FAILS TO BE PUT ON LEGISLATIVE AGENDA
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Nov. 2 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A draft bill to authorize a special budget
for a major arms purchase from the United States failed to be put on
the agenda for review in the Legislative Yuan Tuesday, dashing the
ruling Democratic Progressive Party's (DPP) hope of having the bill
reviewed before the year-end legislative elections.
</P>
<P>
The DPP wanted to review the bill before the legislature goes
into a one-month recess Nov. 10 to prepare for the Dec. 11
legislative elections. The budgets for the arms procurement can be
reviewed when the legislators reconvene after the elections.
</P>
<P>
The "pan-green camp" of the DPP and the Taiwan Solidarity Union
(TSU) and the opposition "pan-blue alliance" of the Kuomintang (KMT)
and the People First Party (PFP) differed sharply on whether to put
the bill on agenda.
</P>
<P>
DPP Legislator Lee Wen-chung said that the arms purchase bill
should be put on the legislative agenda Friday, and then undergo
committee review.
</P>
<P>
But PFP Legislator Lee Yung-ping said that many legislators have
made their support or opposition to the arms purchase part of their
election platforms and that it makes more sense to see how the public
reacts to these candidates, and this will be an indicator of public
opinion on the issue for legislators to follow.
</P>
<P>
Serious sparring between the two camps erupted with both sides
traded such barbs as "China party" and "warmongering party." The
"pan-green camp" then bowed out in protest, and the "pan-blue
alliance" voted to suspend the draft bill due to its majority.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Premier Yu Shyi-kun said he "regretted" and "was very
disappointed" to hear that the bill had failed to be put on the
legislative agenda.
</P>
<P>
Yu also criticized KMT Chairman Lien Chan and PFP Chairman James
Soong for "inconsistencies, " noting that arms procurement is crucial
to national security and combat readiness is the best way to prevent
war.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the arms purchase from the U.S. proposal was mapped
out during the time when Lien served as premier, and that Soong
supported arms procurements while running in the 2000 and 2004
presidential elections. They seem to think that "national security no
longer matters after losing the elections," he added.
</P>
<P>
The premier promised that there will be no kickback for the arms
procurement deal and that if there are violators, they will be
severely dealt with.
</P>
<P>
The premier also said before he steps down in February in
accordance with constitutional practice, the government will not
increase taxes to finance the arms procurement, The Cabinet proposed
in June for a special budget of NT$610.8 billion (US$18.23 billion)
to buy six batteries of anti-missile Patriot-III systems, eight
diesel-fueled submarines and a squadron of 12 anti-submarine
aircraft.
</P>
<P>
The budgets for the arms procurement will be paid over a
15-year period starting in 2005 and will not harm the expenditures
for other social welfare items, he added.

'TRUTH COMMISSION' MEMBERS VISIT INVESTIGATION BUREAU
</HEADLINE>

Taipei, Nov. 2 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Members of the "319 Truth Commission" paid a
visit to the Ministry of Justice Investigation Bureau (MJIB) Tuesday
in the hope of gaining an understanding of the current state of the
bureau's investigations into the election-eve shooting of President
Chen Shui-bian.
</P>
<P>
Wang Ching-feng, spokeswoman for the controversial commission
created under the authorization of the opposition-controlled
Legislative Yuan to investigate the shooting a day before the March
20 presidential election, said the commission wants to know whether
the MJIB received any information ahead of the shooting of Chen on
the campaign trail in the southern city of Tainan, as well as its
role in the probe of the incident.
</P>
<P>
"We also hope to know the working situation of the special '319'
investigative team and the investigative procedures in the wake of
the incident," Wang explained.
</P>
<P>
MJIB Director Yeh Mao-sheng and other bureau officials warmly
received the commission members, headed by Shih Chi-yang, convener of
the "319 Truth Commission" who once served as president of the
Judicial Yuan.
</P>
<P>
Wang told the media after the visit that on the eve of the
election, a dark-blue van was parked at the intersection of Chinhua
Road and Yunghua Road in Tainan near the scene of the shooting.
</P>
<P>
"As the place was on the route to be taken by President Chen's
motorcade, the vehicle was supposed to have been moved in advance.
However, the van stayed there even after the shooting. It was
decorated with Chen's campaign banners, " Wang claimed, adding that
the truth commission will offer NT$100,000 as a reward to whoever can
provide leads that prove helpful in investigating the so-called
"suspicious van."
</P>
<P>
Responding to the truth commission's appeal, however, the law
enforcement team already investigating the shooting issued a press
statement saying that the van had been ruled out of connections with
the incident.
</P>
<P>
The team said the van belongs to a volunteer firefighter in
Tainan surnamed Lee. It joined the street parade at Minghsing Road
without prior approval and thus was stopped by traffic police and
ordered to park at the entrance to No. 2, Sec. 3, Chinhua Road.
</P>
<P>
"Neither the investigative team nor the Criminal Investigation
Bureau have ever received any inquiries from the truth commission
about the van," the press statement said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the investigation bureau renewed its call for local
people to provide leads or clues to locate a "suspicious man dressed
in gray" who was shown on video monitors to be at the "hot area" on
the day. The bureau said it would offer NT$53 million as a reward to
whoever provides useful leads to help resolve the mysterious case.
</P>
<P>
Chen won re-election a day after the shooting that mildly gazed
his abdomen. Without providing any evidence, his challenger,
opposition Kuomintang Chairman Lien Chan, insinuated that the
shooting was staged by Chen to win sympathy votes. Lien has filed two
lawsuits to invalidate Chen's re-election victory and even the entire
election so that a new one can be held. The Taiwan High Court will
announce its verdict on the election victory annulment suit this
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Council of Grand Justices (CGJ) is scheduled to
announce its interpretation of the legality and constitutionality of
the "truth commission" in two months. The Cabinet claims that the
truth commission is unlawful and unconstitutional and thus applied
for a CGJ interpretation.

spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The flu vaccination plan is aimed mainly at providing the Taiwan
people with sufficient injections to secure their health in case of
an epidemic and secondly to promote Taiwan as a production base for
flu vaccine, he said.
</P>
<P>
WHO assessments show that some 1.2 billion people in the world
belong to a high-risk group prone to flu infection. But in 2002, only
about 263 million vaccinations were provided to these people,
according to the WHO report.
</P>
<P>
To mend a similar gap in Taiwan, the government hopes to
implement its vaccine hub plan, in addition to purchasing flu vaccine
from both home and abroad, the volume of which amounted to more than
2 million vaccinations per year, falling short of the country's
overall need of between 3.5 million and 4 million injections, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Of this 4 million, around 1 million are to satisfy the demand
from the public willing to pay for vaccination by themselves, he
noted.
</P>
<P>
The CDC project also suggests forging joint ventures or mergers
between local and foreign companies.

In a day of see-sawing court rulings, a Federal appeals court

thousands of people inside polling places to challenge the
eligibility of voters, a blow to Democrats who argued those
challengers will intimidate minority voters.

RELEASE OF ANIMALS INTO WILD TO BE BANNED
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Nov.  2 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Legislative Yuan passed the first
reading of a draft revision to the existing animal protection law
Tuesday to ban the release of animals into the wild as a so-called
"charitable" act.
</P>
<P>
Legislator Lu Po-chi of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party,
who initiated the draft revision bill, said he hopes the legislature
can complete a third reading of the bill and make it law as early as
possible to better protect wildlife and natural ecology.
</P>
<P>
Some religious groups advocate the release of captive animals
into the wild -- an activity they see as an "act of charity" and have
sponsored large-scale animal release campaigns in recent years.
However, Lu pointed out that such activities have prompted
unscrupulous businessmen to capture local birds or import rare birds
from abroad. Sometimes, Lu said, religious followers even purchase
protected species on the black market for their wildlife release
rituals. Most of the animals die, as they are unable to survive in
the wild.
</P>
<P>
Quoting the results of a survey by an animal research
association, Lu said nearly 60 percent of the birds sold at 155 local
bird shops surveyed were captured by hunters hired by shop owners for
sale to religious followers.
</P>
<P>
The association spent two years surveying 155 bird shops in
Taipei County, Taipei City, Taichung City, Taichung County, Kaohsiung
City and Kaohsiung County.
</P>
<P>
According to the report released by the association, at least
600,000 birds have been injured or have died in the process of
capture and transportation before ever being "release into the wild"
by religious followers.

TIME FOR PEOPLE TO LEARN TO ISSUE MANDATES: PRESIDENT
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,   Nov.   2  (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After going through three direct
presidential elections, now is the time for the people of Taiwan to
learn how to really issue mandates in a democracy, President Chen
Shui-bian said Tuesday,
</P>
<P>
Chen, who also serves as chairman of the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP), made the comments in a weekly meeting of the
party's Central Standing Committee.
</P>
<P>
Now that the country has already held three presidential
elections, now is the time for its people to learn how to be the boss
in a democratic society in which obligations and rights, freedom and
responsibilities, go hand in hand, Chen said.
</P>
<P>
Stressing that all nationals should be united once an election is
over, Chen said that the highest value of a democracy lies in the
fact that the people are entitled to make their own choice every time
there is an election.
</P>
<P>
In the wake of his March 20 presidential election, the president
said, he outlined four major goals -- national unity, cross-Taiwan
Strait peace, social stability and economic prosperity -- as the
government's focal policies during his second four-year term, in an
effort to fend off a larger conflict in society due to the election
outcome.
</P>
<P>
He said he hopes to help lay a sound foundation for national
solidarity and democratic progress and pointed out that Taiwan's
continued development should take precedence over personal gains or a
party's benefits.
</P>
<P>
"The DPP is determined to do its utmost to cement Taiwan's
democratization and turn it into a normal nation by overcoming ethnic
differences and political unfairness with respect and understanding,
" he claimed, adding that " Taiwan will never walk back along its old
path in its search for a profound transformation."

PRESIDENT EXPECTS NO CHANGE IN U.S. TAIWAN POLICY AFTER ELECTION

Taipei,  Nov.  2 (CNA)

<TEXT>
<P>
President Chen Shui-bian said Tuesday he
believes that U.S. policy toward Taiwan and mainland China will not
change, no matter who wins the U.S. presidential election.
</P>
<P>
Chen made the remarks while meeting with visiting members of a
pro-Taiwan group in the European Parliament, the legislative arm of
the 25-state European Union.
</P>
<P>
"I think countries around the world are all concerned about the
U.S. presidential election. The outcome of the race will become clear
between 8 a.m. and 10 a.m. Wednesday (Taipei time) but I believe
that no matter who wins, U.S. policy regarding the two sides of
the Taiwan Strait will remain unchanged," Chen told his guests.
</P>
<P>
Chen expressed his gratitude for the European Parliament's
encouragement and support for Taiwan's bid to join the World Health
Organization (WHO) and the World Health Assembly (WHA) , and he said
he hopes Taiwan can realize its goal of becoming an observer in the
WHA -- the WHO's governing body -- in the near future, so that
Taiwan does not become a hole in the global anti-pandemic network.
</P>
<P>
Praising the European Parliament for its opposition to the
lifting of a 15-year-old E.U. ban on arms sales to mainland China due
to Beijing's poor human rights record, Chen also thanked the European
Parliament for its call for Beijing to remove the hundreds of
missiles it has deployed against Taiwan and to resolve cross-strait
disputes through peaceful dialogue with Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
The delegation was headed by Georg Jarzembowski, chairman of the
pro-Taiwan group in the European Parliament, and its members included
Aloyzas Sakalas, vice chairman of the pro-Taiwan group, as well as
European Parliament members Philip Claeys, Ryszard Czarnecki and
Amneli Jaatteenmaki.

MND LAMENTS ARMS PACKAGE FAILURE AT LEGISLATIVE COMMITTEE

<TEXT>
<P>
The Ministry of National Defense (MND)
lamented Tuesday the failure of a legislative committee to put a
high-profile arms procurement budget plan on its agenda for review,
and called for public support for the program.
</P>
<P>
The MND made the comments in a statement issued shortly after its
budget draft to buy defensive weapons from the United States failed
to clear the National Defense Committee under the Legislative Yuan.
</P>
<P>
Stating that national security is everyone's obligation
regardless of his or her political stance, the MND said, it deeply
regrets that the draft arms purchase budgets, worth a total of
NT$610.8 billion (US$18.23 billion ) , missed the chance of being
rationally discussed in the legislature.
</P>
<P>
Maintaining peace across the Taiwan Strait is in the best
interests of both Taiwan and the United States, and a weak national
defense will eventually take its toll on Taiwan's 23 million people
and the nation's sovereignty, the MND said, urging the public to
support the weapons procurement plan that it claims will safeguard
the country.
</P>
<P>
Only a capable national defense will provide full security for
Taiwan's people and the military buildup needs their backing, it
said, adding that "cowards do not deserve peace" and that "strength
is the best weapon at the negotiating table."

<TEXT>
<P>
The Republic of China established formal
diplomatic relations with the Republic of Vanuatu Wednesday, Foreign
Affairs Minister Tan Sun Chen announced at a press conference held in
the morning.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan began to engage in "mutual recognition" relations with the
southwest Pacific nation in September 1992. Vanuatu had maintained
formal diplomatic ties with mainland China since March 1982.
</P>
<P>
After nearly 80 years of joint French and British colonial
administration, Vanuatu became an independent nation on July 30,
1980, changing its official designation to Vanuatu from New Hebrides.
</P>
<P>
Located between Australia and Fiji, Vanuatu has a population of
about 210,000, with some 3,000 people of Taiwanese or Chinese origin.
Over 100 hundred languages are spoken in Vanuatu, with Bislama, a
type of pidgin English that combines mainly English words and
Melanesian grammar, being commonly used throughout the country.
</P>
<P>
A member of the United Nations, Vanuatu is also a member of the
South Pacific Forum and the South Pacific Commission.
</P>
<P>
An agricultural country, Vanuatu exports dried coconut meat,
coconut oil, cocoa and beef. Its major trade partners include France,
the United States, Japan and Australia.
</P>
<P>
Two-way trade between Taiwan and Vanuatu stood at US$6.4 million
in 2001, with Taiwan's exports to the country totaling US$5.6
million.
</P>
<P>
Chen's announcement of the establishment of diplomatic ties with
Vanuatu increases the number of nations with which the ROC maintains
formal diplomatic relations to 27.

VANUATU BECOMES ROC'S 27TH DIPLOMATIC ALLY
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Nov. 3 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The government of the south Pacific nation
of Vanuatu forged a communique with the Republic of China government
on the establishment of formal diplomatic relations Wednesday,
becoming the 27th diplomatic ally of Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Visiting Vanuatuan Prime Minister Serge Vohor and ROC Foreign
Affairs Minister Tan Sun Chen jointly signed the communique on behalf
of their respective countries based on the principles of equality and
reciprocity and the common wish of further developing bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
The communique was signed at a ceremony held at the Ministry of
the Foreign Affairs Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
In the communique, the governments of the two countries vowed to
further bolster economic, cultural, fishery, tourism and
technological cooperation and exchanges.
</P>
<P>
Also in the communique, Vanuatu reiterated its firm support for
Taiwan's bid to join the United Nations, the World Health
Organization and other international and regional organizations.
</P>
<P>
According to the communique, Taiwan diplomatic officials have
already visited Vanuatu's capital of Port-Vila to prepare for the
opening of an ROC embassy there.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan began to engage in "mutual recognition" relations with
Vanuatu in September 1992. Vanuatu had maintained formal diplomatic
ties with mainland China since March 1982.
</P>
<P>
After nearly 80 years of joint French and British colonial
administration, Vanuatu became an independent nation on July 30,
1980, changing its official designation to Vanuatu from New Hebrides.
</P>
<P>
A member of the United Nations and the Commonwealth, Vanuatu is
also a member of the World Bank, Asian Development Bank,
International Monetary Fund, World Health Organization, South Pacific
Forum, and South Pacific Commission. It now holds observer status in
the World Trade Organization. Currently, Vanuatu maintains formal
diplomatic relations with 74 countries around the world.
</P>
<P>
Located between Australia and Fiji, Vanuatu is made up of 80-odd
islands and isles. With an economic zone of about 680,000 square
kilometers, Vanuatu's fishery production and maritime resources are
an important source of wealth for the country.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan and Vanuatu have maintained close fishery ties over the
years, with some 30 Taiwan-based snagline fishing boats operating
regularly in the Vanuatuan economic zone.
</P>
<P>
Vanuatu has a population of about 202,000, with some 3,000 people
of Taiwanese or Chinese origin. Three major languages are spoken in
Vanuatu, namely English, French and Bislama -- a type of pidgin
English that combines mainly English words and Melanesian grammar.
</P>
<P>
An agricultural country, Vanuatu exports dried coconut meat,
coconut oil, cocoa and beef. Offshore banking services, boat
registration services and tourism are also important cash earners for
the country. Its major trade partners include France, the United
States, Japan and Australia. Per capita annual income stands at about
US$3,000.
</P>
<P>
Two-way trade between Taiwan and Vanuatu stood at US$6.4 million
in 2001, with Taiwan's exports to the country totaling US$5.6
million.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan visitors enjoy the privilege of landing visas in Vanuatu,
which they can reach via direct flights from Australia or New
Zealand.

CALM URGED PRIOR TO COURT RULING ON ELECTION LAWSUIT
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Nov. 4 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Executive Yuan asked for calm and order
Wednesday on the eve of a verdict from the Taiwan High Court over an
election result nullification lawsuit filed by the opposition
"pan-blue alliance" of the Kuomintang (KMT) and the People First
Party (PFP).
</P>
<P>
Executive Yuan spokesman Chen Chi-mai said that in view of the
the possibility that large numbers of "pan-blue alliance" supporters
might converge on the Taiwan High Court building to challenge the
ruling Thursday, he has asked the National Police Administration
under the Ministry of the Interior to be on high alert for possible
confrontations and clashes.
</P>
<P>
The "pan-blue alliance" filed the election result nullification
suit March 29 after KMT Chairman Lien Chan lost the March 20
presidential election by 29,518 votes, or 0.228 percent of the
more-than 13 million ballots cast, to incumbent President Chen
Shui-bian. The suit resulted in an unprecedented full-scale recount
that started May 10, with special attention given to the record
337,297 invalid ballots. The alliance also filed a separate lawsuit
April 5 seeking to invalidate the entire election, citing what it
claims were "irregularities" in the voting.
</P>
<P>
Chen Chi-mai also asked the Taipei city government to rigorously
carry out its responsibility in maintaining order. He also urged
Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou, who concurrently serves as a KMT vice
chairman, to exert his influence within the party to ease possible
clashes between the citizens and police.
</P>
<P>
He further reminded the public that according to the Assembly and
Rally Law, courts are off-limit areas for such activities.
</P>
<P>
Chen said the Executive Yuan will respect the verdict, which he
refused to predict. He also urged all political party leaders to
respect the ruling, saying that "Taiwan cannot stay forever on March
19" and that no-one "should incite ethnic hatred and rivalry." He also
appealed for a return of "calm and peace in society."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, KMT Chairman Lien said in a regular KMT Central
Standing Committee meeting Wednesday that his party has high
expectations for the justice system and expressed hope that it will
be the last guardian of social justice.
</P>
<P>
Participants in the meeting listened to a report from lawyer Lee
Chung-teh on "the effect of a fair justice ruling on the nation's
democracy, " after which, Lien said that one can see that the
ballots received by President Chen were incorrect.
</P>
<P>
Lien said that Chen, the defendant in the lawsuit, violated the
referendum law by holding Taiwan's first referendum on the same day
as the March 20 presidential election for his own benefit.
</P>
<P>
He also claimed that there is evidence to show that the
election-eve shooting of Chen was staged to win sympathy votes in the
bitterly fought election, but he yet again failed to back his claim
by actually producing any of the so-called evidence.
</P>
<P>
With the year-end legislative elections approaching, Lien said he
does not want the public to ask the question that if a president can
illegally link a referendum to a presidential election, "what will
happen in future elections? " and he urged the people to monitor
future elections.
</P>
<P>
Lien said that everyone is equal in democracy and that if someone
uses fraud to win an election, others should be able to stand up
against him.
</P>
<P>
Lien's words drew immediate flak from the ruling party.
</P>
<P>
Cheng Wen-tsang, director of the DPP's information department,
said that Lien's words are the most serious "misspoken remarks" he
has made since the March 20 election, that he is the worst example of
a political figure and that he should apologize to the nation.

PRESIDENT MEETS WITH VANUATU PRIME MINISTER
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Nov. 3 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President Chen Shui-bian met with visiting
Vanuatu Prime Minister Serge Vohor Wednesday to celebrate the
establishment of formal diplomatic relations between the two
countries earlier in the day.
</P>
<P>
"This is a historic day. After 12 years of efforts, Taiwan and
Vanuatu have finally forged full diplomatic ties. It is belated good
news and the tie-up deserves celebration by the governments and
peoples of our two countries," Chen told his guest.
</P>
<P>
Chen attributed the success in forging ties in part to Vohor's
long-term friendship and support for the Republic of China. Chen
recalled that Taiwan and Vanuatu already signed a joint communique on
mutual recognition in 1992 to pave the way for establishing
diplomatic ties during Vohor's tenure as Vanuatu foreign minister.
</P>
<P>
"Thanks to Vohor's unwavering support for Taiwan, the two
countries have finally been able to forge full diplomatic ties 12
years later, "Chen said jubilantly.
</P>
<P>
Chen also lauded Vohor for his achievements in promoting
democratic reform in his country, especially in leading its coalition
government in carrying out a series of constitutional reforms and
winning a majority in the parliament.
</P>
<P>
"These achievements indicate that Vohor has outstanding
leadership capability and political wisdom, " Chen said, adding that
the fact Vohor's party controls 32 seats in the 52-seat parliament
has helped ensure that his reform programs have been carried out
smoothly.
</P>
<P>
Noting that both Taiwan and Vanuatu are maritime states, Chen
said he hopes the two countries can strengthen fishery cooperation.
Vanuatu has a booming fishery industry.
</P>
<P>
"With shared values of freedom, democracy and peace, our two
countries should work together in the future to promote regional
peace, stability and prosperity," Chen said.
</P>
<P>
For his part, Vohor said he looks forward to seeing the two
countries develop mutually beneficial relations on an equal and
reciprocal basis. He also assured Chen that Vanuatu will support
Taiwan's cause in the international arena.
</P>
<P>
Vohor also expressed his hope that Taiwan will provide its
successful economic development experience for his country's
reference or emulation. "Let our two sides expand exchanges and
cooperate closely in pursuing common interests and benefits, " he
added.
</P>
<P>
The establishment of diplomatic ties with the South Pacific
island state marked a modest victory in Taiwan's efforts to break
mainland China's diplomatic embargo. The tie-up brings the number of
countries that have official diplomatic relations with the ROC back
to 27, after after the Caribbean island of Dominica switched
diplomatic recognition from Taipei to Beijing in March.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Foreign Affairs Tan Sun Chen said after signing a
joint communique with Vohor on the establishment of formal diplomatic
ties that Taiwan's pursuit of an "international space" cannot be
suppressed by mainland China's missile threat.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on the same occasion, Vohor said his country's decision
to establish diplomatic ties with the ROC is not designed to anger
any country in the world or to make an enemy of mainland China.
</P>
<P>
"We do not refuse to be friends with China, but the decision was
made based on the welfare of our people," Vohor said.
</P>
<P>
About 200,000 people live in Vanuatu, a group of 80 or so islands
2,250 km northeast of Australia. Vanuatu formed formal diplomatic
ties with mainland China in 1982. It remains unclear whether Beijing
would cut ties with Vanuatu after the island nation forged diplomatic
relations with Taiwan.

The sales volume of automobiles in the
domestic market is expected to total 500,000 units for the whole of
2004 on the back of strong performance in the first three quarters,
according to tallies published by the Ministry of Economic Affairs
(MOEA).
</P>
<P>
The estimated figure is much higher than the original target of
about 400,000 units set early this year, business sources said,
adding that the combined sales in the first nine months already
reached 330,000 units, leaving only a gap of around 30,000 units
compared with the 2003 total level.
</P>
<P>
Statistics compiled by the MOEA's Industrial Technology
Information Service (ITIS) show that Taiwan's automobile industry

billion (US$11.27 billion) in output value and services, up by 17.4
percent compared to the previous year's level.

Benefiting from a stronger euro, Taiwan-made motorcycles and

Foreign Affairs and the Taipei Economic and Cultural Representative
Office in Washington, were also closely monitoring the situation,
Chen noted.
</P>
<P>
Chen said that Foreign Affairs Minister Tan Sun Chen would issue
a formal statement on the election after the last polls closed at
about 12 p.m. Wednesday (EST).
</P>
<P>
In related news, the foreign affairs minister said that no matter
who wins, the government believes that U.S. Taiwan policy will not
change drastically and that Taiwan affairs will be handled in a
steady manner based on the existing foundation.
</P>
<P>
Chen said that although there could be some departure, the basic
stance of U.S. policy toward Taiwan is not expected to change
dramatically. Taking an incident during the time of the Bill Clinton
administration as an example, Chen said that bilateral communications
between Taiwan and the United States returned to normal soon after
Taiwan sought U.S. clarification when Clinton made some remarks that
were considered by Taiwan as not very friendly.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, David J. Keegan, deputy director of the American
Institute in Taiwan, said at an election observation center
established at a Taipei hotel Wednesday that regardless of who wins
the presidential election, the American people will be the final
winners.

<P>
XPEC Entertainment Inc. of Taiwan signed a
contract with Japan's Namco TV Games Wednesday to cooperate in
developing new TV games.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Economic Affairs Ho Mei-yueh, who was invited to
witness the signing ceremony, noted that the prospects for TV games
are brighter than those of PC games with the increasing popularity of
digital television, and is expected to be the prime mover of Taiwan's
efforts to develop a digital content industry.
</P>
<P>
Ho also expressed the hope that the Japanese TV game company will
set up a research and development center in Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Ho said that the digital content industry is expected to be the
country's two rising stars -- with biotechnology being the other --
and that the government hopes to help transform the industry so that
Taiwan can become an Asian and Chinese digital content design,
development and production center.
</P>
<P>
To promote this goal, the ministry has pushed for a series of
international cooperation meetings that resulted in the cooperation
contract between Namco and XPEC Entertainment.

HI-TECH FIRMS TO PROVIDE 1,800 OPENINGS FOR RESERVE DUTY OFFICERS
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Tainan, Nov. 3 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taiwan's high technology sector will provide
1,800 openings this year for talented new servicemen, to enable them
to complete their military service while working at privately run
companies, authorities from National Cheng Kung University said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The 2004 Reserve Duty Program Exhibition is scheduled to be moved
to Tainan, southern Taiwan for a two-day run beginning Nov. 7 on the
NCKU Kuangfu campus, where 50 high-tech firms will provide job
openings for 1,800 new conscripts who are holders of doctorates or
master's degrees, NCKU authorities said at a press conference.
</P>
<P>
So long as these graduates pass the reserve duty officer
examination set by the Ministry of National Defense, they can enter
the 50 companies, in February 2005 at the earliest, to work on an
alternative military service basis, according to NCKU authorities.
</P>
<P>
Applicants who win the opportunity to work at the private
companies for salaries the same as those for ordinary staff will have
to extend their alternative military service from the normal 22
months to four years.
</P>
<P>
Allowing elite graduates to serve their compulsory military
service in private hi-tech companies will help keep the roots of the
Taiwanese hi-tech companies at home in Taiwan at a time when the
global economy is regaining momentum, which is in turn spurring
economic recovery in Taiwan, NCKU officials said.
</P>
<P>
Many of the 50 companies are big names in their respective
fields, including Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., United
Microelectronics Corp., the Hon Hai Group, Chi Mei Optoelectronics
and Nannstar Display.
</P>
<P>
Last year, only 30-odd companies offered job openings for such
applicants.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, more than 12,000 individuals have contributed their
expertise to the country's defense industry development since the
defense industry reserve duty system was established in 1980.
</P>
<P>
The defense industry reserve duty program is aimed at supplying
sufficient skilled labor for the research and development of weapons.
</P>
<P>
The 2004 Reserve Duty Program Exhibition opened in Taipei Oct. 29
with the participation of more than 1,000 organizations and units
that wished to demonstrate the promising results of applying the
private sector's R&amp;D resources to the defense industry.

NT$117 MILLION-WORTH OF HEROIN SEIZED ABOARD TAIWAN FISHING BOAT
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Nov. 3 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Law enforcement officers uncovered 24.5 kg
of high-grade heroin aboard a Taiwan fishing boat in the southern
county of Pingtung Wednesday and arrested two key suspects in a
cross-border drug trafficking operation.
</P>
<P>
Kuo Jung-fu, a 50-year-old Taiwan man, was accused of having
colluded with a mainland Chinese man nicknamed "black dog" in
attempting to smuggle the heroin, worth an estimated NT$117 million
in street value, into Taiwan from the southeastern mainland Chinese
port city of Xiamen in Fujian Province.
</P>
<P>
Kuo and the mainland man were nabbed when they showed up at the
Hsiaoliuchiu fishing port in Pingtung County early Wednesday morning
to pick up the drugs hidden aboard the Chiyifa.
</P>
<P>
Initial investigations show that Kuo and the mainland man formed
a drug trafficking ring in October that purchased heroin from
Thailand late last month. The drugs were first sent to Xiamen and
then shipped to Taiwan aboard the Chiyifa.
</P>
<P>
Acting on a tipoff, the Criminal Investigation Bureau's (CIB's)
southern Taiwan crime-fighting center formed a special investigative
team in cooperation with coast guard and prosecution authorities in
late October. The team had been monitoring the fishing vessel's
activities since it left Hsiaoliuchiu for Xiamen Oct. 28. The boat
returned to Hsiaoliuchiu Oct. 30, but Kuo and his mainland accomplice
did not show up at the port until Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
CIB officials said they will continue to track down other ring
members involved in the drug trafficking operation.

PRESIDENT LAMENTS UNDEMOCRATIC REMARKS BY RIVAL
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
(By Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Taipei, Nov. 3 (CAN) President Chen Shui-bian lamented Wednesday
what he described as the undemocratic remarks of his campaign rival
in the March 20 presidential election on the eve of a verdict by the
Taiwan High Court on an election result nullification lawsuit filed
by the opposition "pan-blue alliance" of the Kuomintang (KMT) and the
People First Party (PFP).
</P>
<P>
The president was responding to claims made earlier in the day by
KMT Chairman Lien Chan that there is evidence to show that the
election-eve shooting of the president was staged to win him sympathy
votes in the bitterly fought election.
</P>
<P>
For a man who won the election through fraud and foul play,
anyone can stand up against him, Lien said.
</P>
<P>
The president expressed regret over Lien's remarks, made even
before the court had meted out the ruling, asking "what kind of a
society is this, and what kind of democratic manner is this?"
</P>
<P>
The "pan-blue alliance" filed a lawsuit March 29 seeking to
nullify the result of the election, which Chen won by a margin of
29,518 votes. The lawsuit resulted in an unprecedented full-scale
recount that began May 10 of the more-than 13 million votes cast.
After the initial recount, all the controversial votes were submitted
to a high court panel to rule on their validity. If the number of
questionable ballots exceeds 30,000, Lien could dispute the result of
the election.
</P>
<P>
The alliance also filed a separate suit in April 5 to nullify the
election altogether, citing what it claimed were rampant voting
irregularities, and to demand a new election.

TAIWAN LINKS WITH MAINLAND CHINA UNDENIABLE: MAC CHIEF

<TEXT>
<P>
Taiwan's language, cultural and blood links
with mainland China are an undeniable fact and the two sides should
try to understand each other to forge peace across the Taiwan Strait,
Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) Chairman Joseph Wu said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Wu made the remarks while giving a speech at the General Chamber
of Commerce of the Republic of China at the invitation of Chairman
Gary Wang.
</P>
<P>
Stating that the government led by President Chen Shui-bian of
the ruling Democratic Progressive Party has no intention of
conducting a de-sinicization of Taiwan, Wu said that language,
history, culture and race links between Taiwan and the mainland are a
fact that no one can deny.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, he said, there is no so-called de-sinicization problem
in Taiwan, and after Chen's May 20 inauguration, the government has
been extending olive branches to the mainland in an effort to boost
cooperation and create peace between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
Echoing Wu's words, Wang said that Taiwan, as the world's sole
democratic society built by ethnic Chinese, should pride itself by
standing tall as a lighthouse of human rights and democracy for all
the Chinese people around the world.
</P>
<P>
In addition to pursuing what Taiwan needs, the government should
also seek to explore what the mainland thinks, in order to improve
bilateral relations, Wang suggested.

JAPAN EMERGES AS TAIWAN'S TOP AGRICULTURAL EXPORT MARKET
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Oct.  3 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taiwan exported US$2.63 billion-worth of
agricultural products in the first nine months of this year, with
Japan its largest export outlet, the Directorate-General of Budget,
Accounting and Statistics (DGBAS) said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
According to DGBAS tallies, Taiwan's agricultural trade amounted
to US$9.28 billion in the January-September period, up 14.6 percent
from the year-earlier level.
</P>
<P>
Of the amount, exports accounted for US$2.63 billion,
representing a 9 percent increase from the year-earlier level, while
imports made up US$6.65 billion for a 17 percent year-on-year rise.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan incurred a deficit of US$4.03 billion in agricultural
trade for the nine-month period, an increase of US$750 million from
the year-earlier level.
</P>
<P>
By area, Japan was Taiwan's largest agricultural export market,
purchasing US$1.01 billion-worth of agricultural goods for a 13.5
percent year-on-year rise. Hong Kong and mainland China imported a
total of US$610 million-worth of farm produce from Taiwan during the
same period and the United States came in third, importing US$270
million-worth of Taiwan agricultural products.

TAIWAN KEY HUB OF PAN-ASIA SUPPLY CHAIN: MASTERCARD
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Nov.  3 (CNA)
(By Y.F. Low)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taiwan has emerged as a key hub of the
Pan-Asia supply chain following a "twin revolution" in terms of
consumption and outsourcing that is transforming the region into a
high-performance economy, according to a report released Wednesday by
MasterCard International.
</P>
<P>
Yuwa Hedrick-Wong, MasterCard's economic advisor for the
Asia-Pacific region, said the massive expansion of the middle class
and the "new young" market in Asia is boosting domestic consumption
in many countries in the region.
</P>
<P>
By 2010, the population of the middle class -- defined as those
earning US$5,000 or more per year -- will have reached 155 million in
mainland China, 23 million in Taiwan, 42 million in South Korea and
21 million in Thailand, Hedrick-Wong predicted.
</P>
<P>
In addition, young people aged between 25 and 35, who constitute
12 percent of the population in the Asia-Pacific region, are expected
to account for 47 percent of discretionary spending in the region by
2007, he said.
</P>
<P>
Both the rise of domestic consumption power and young consumers
will stimulate the advent of high value-added services, according to
Hedrick-Wong.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the new trend in intra-regional trade has been driven
by the outsourcing revolution, with the fastest-growing products
being the most technology- and knowledge-intensive, he said.
</P>
<P>
Of the 27 products identified by the Standard Industrial Trade
Classification (SITC) as the fastest-growing in intra-regional trade
from 1995 to 2001, 13 are classified as high-skill-, technology- and
knowledge-intensive, he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
While 11 are classified as medium-skill, medium-capital and
scale-intensive manufacturing, only three are classified as
low-skill, labor-intensive manufacturing, he added.
</P>
<P>
The lowering of tariffs and bilateral free-trade agreements have
also eased the development of a "Pan-Asia" supply chain, of which
Taiwan has emerged as a key hub, he said.
</P>
<P>
The share of Taiwan's exports accounted for 41.1 percent in the
Asia-Pacific region in 2001, and Taiwan's trade complementarity index
with Asia-Pacific nations stood at 68.5 during the same period, up
from 43.4 recorded in 1985, he said.
</P>
<P>
However, Hedrick-Wong said Taiwan needs to increase its spending
on research and development to become a knowledge-based economy,
pointing out that Taiwan's R&amp;D spending accounted for only 2.3
percent of its gross domestic product (GDP) in 2003, which was lower
than the 4.7 percent of Israel and the 2.9 percent of South Korea.

TALKS ON CROSS-STRAIT CHARTER FLIGHT SERVICES POSSIBLE: MAC
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Nov.  3 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The nation's top mainland China policy
planner said Wednesday that there could be a chance for both sides of
the Taiwan Strait to discuss cross-strait charter flight services for
passengers and cargo after the Dec. 11 legislative elections.
</P>
<P>
Joseph Wu, chairman of the Mainland Affairs Council (MAC), made
the remarks when he was invited by the General Chamber of Commerce of
the ROC to give a speech on peace and development -- the creation of
a win-win situation for both sides of the Taiwan Strait.
</P>
<P>
Wu noted that "it will be no problem for Taiwan" whether
cross-strait charter flights are limited to the Chinese New Year
holiday period or whether charter flight services for passengers and
cargo are extended to other times, as long as Beijing agrees.
</P>
<P>
But he noted that the mainland has proposed two-way charter
flights without rerouting via third places. Although Taiwan will not
be opposed to such a proposal and that there is precedence for such
charter flight services from Taiwan to the mainland, bilateral
consultations will still be required before charter planes can cross
the Taiwan Strait directly.
</P>
<P>
Charter flight services during the 2003 Chinese New Year holiday
period to pick up Taiwan businessmen operating in mainland China were
opened on a trial basis, but the flights were one-way only and had to
made stopovers in Hong Kong or Macau.
</P>
<P>
Wu noted that judging from recent remarks by the Beijing's Taiwan
Affairs Office, Beijing has budged a little on the matter and that
there is a chance of starting consultations on the issue after the
legislative elections.

MAC CHIEF FORESEES NO FUNDAMENTAL CHANGE IN U.S. POLICY TOWARD TAIWAN
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Nov.  3 (CNA)

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) Chairman
Joseph Wu said Wednesday he foresees no fundamental changes in U.S.
policy toward Taiwan after the U.S. presidential election.
</P>
<P>
Wu made the remarks at a Legislative Yuan committee meeting where
opposition People First Party Legislator Lee Ching-hua asked about
Wu's views on Washington's "one China" policy and U.S. scholar
Kenneth Lieberthal's suggestion that Taiwan vow not to declare
independence in exchange for Beijing's renunciation of the use of
force against the island.
</P>
<P>
The nation's top mainland policy planner said Washington's "one
China" policy does not imply any prerequisites.
</P>
<P>
"The United States just says it acknowledges Beijing's claim that
there is only one China, " Wu said, adding that the United States
intends to promote Taiwan-mainland China negotiations without
imposing any prerequisites or premises. In contrast, Beijing has been
pressuring Taiwan to accept its "one China" principle as a
precondition for resuming talks with Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
As to Lieberthal's "Taiwan no independence, China no use of
force" proposal, Wu said the concept is worth considering. Noting
that Beijing's renunciation of the use of force is Taiwan's wish, Wu
said no declaration of independence is not a problem for him.
</P>
<P>
"President Chen Shui-bian already expounded on the government's
stance on independence in his May 20 second inauguration address.
Taiwan is already an independent, sovereign state and need not
declare independence again," Wu explained.
</P>
<P>
Legislator Lee also asked Wu whether the campaign to rectify
Taiwan's official designation from the current "Republic of China" to
"Taiwan" or "Republic of Taiwan" advocated by some diehard
pro-independence fundamentalists could succeed.
</P>
<P>
This will depend on the general international environment and
conditions, Wu said, adding that the so-called "rectification of
Taiwan's name" is not the present Democratic Progressive Party
administration's policy.
</P>
<P>
Lieberthal, a political science professor at the University of
Michigan who once served as senior director for Asia at the U.S.
National Security Council, is currently on a four-day visit in Taipei
at the MAC's invitation.

TAIWAN STOCK INVESTORS' MOOD INDICATOR LOOKING UP: SURVEY
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Nov.  3 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Investors in Taiwan's stock market were
upbeat last month, as a newly conducted poll showed that more than
half of Taiwan's retail investors are optimistic about the market's
performance in the months ahead.
</P>
<P>
According to the results of the survey jointly carried out by
Win-Win Weekly magazine and Shih Hsin University, 55.8 percent of
stock investors polled in October said that they are optimistic about
the bourse's performance in the coming three months -- marking a
surge compared to the result of the same poll in August.
</P>
<P>
During the same time, the weighted index -- the key barometer of
the Taiwan Stock Exchange -- rose from 5,352 points to 5,772 points,
an indication that investors' mood was closely related to the
market's ups and downs, survey analysts said.
</P>
<P>
In October, only 8.3 percent held a pessimistic view of the
domestic stock market, a drop from 41.5 percent in August, the survey
found.
</P>
<P>
It also discovered that optimism about meeting investment
targets, finding a job and a positive sentiment about the market's
short-term performance are the main factors behind the clear upward
trend in the indicator.
</P>
<P>
According to the poll results, men are more optimistic than
women, while backers of the "pan green" camp formed by the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party and the Taiwan Solidarity Union are less
worried than swing voters and supporters of the opposition "pan blue"
alliance of the Kuomintang and the People First Party.
</P>
<P>
Stock investors with higher salaries and educational backgrounds
usually had a higher mood indicator, but their indicator points
tended to fall with increased age. People under the age of 29 form
the most optimistic group, while those aged over 60 are the leading
pessimists.
</P>
<P>
Investment experiences and residence locations have no effects on
the indicator, the survey pointed out.
</P>
<P>
The random telephone poll, made Oct. 7 to Oct. 18, collected
1,072 valid questionnaires from respondents aged over 18 who had
bought shares over the past year. It is conducted every two months
and has a margin of error of 3 percent.

TSU VOWS TO CUT BUDGET FOR UNNECESSARY CROSS-STRAIT EXCHANGES
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei, Nov. 3 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A pro-independence lawmaker took the central
government to task for its budget appropriation to subsidize
personnel exchanges across the Taiwan Strait.
</P>
<P>
Chen Chien-ming, deputy convener of the legislative caucus of the
pro-independence Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU) said 23 central
government agencies had set aside a total of NT$343.12 million in the
2005 budget plan for subsidizing mainland Chinese academics or
professional groups to visit Taiwan or for Taiwan officials to
conduct study tours of mainland China.
</P>
<P>
"This phenomenon is outrageous, " Chen said. "Why does the
government have to use taxpayers' money to subsidize cross-strait
exchanges? China has never subsidized Taiwan academics or experts'
mainland visits on a reciprocal basis."
</P>
<P>
If mainland scholars or officials want to understand Taiwan's
present social situation, Chen said, they should pay their travel
expenses out of their own pockets.
</P>
<P>
Chen further said some government agencies have also appropriated
funds for sending their staff members to study mainland market trends
as well as various economic, social and legal systems. In his view,
Chen said many of the planned inspection items listed in the budget
bill are ridiculous.
</P>
<P>
For instance, he said, the highway administration department
under the Ministry of Transportation and Communications earmarked
NT$102,000 in its budget plan for organizing a delegation to look
into mainland China's highway construction and maintenance systems.
"Does Taiwan's civil engineering technology and maintenance system
lag China's? Is it truly necessary to make such an inspection tour?
"he asked.
</P>
<P>

Two mainland Chinese tourists absconded
shortly after arriving at Chiang Kai-shek (CKS) International Airport
-- Taiwan's main gateway -- along with a tour group Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The two mainland tourists, identified as Ai Hungying, 51, and Jia
Yaqi, 32, got off a tour bus while the tour guide was reporting the
arrival of the 21-member mainland tour group to the Tourism Bureau's
office at the CKS Airport.

<P>
The tour group was organized by a travel agency in the southern
Taiwan city of Tainan. The group is scheduled to stay in Taiwan for
seven days. Other members will continue their local travel itinerary.
</P>
<P>
Travel sources said the two absconded tourists had both
registered their birth places as Shengyang in the northeastern
mainland province of Liaoning. In the past, absconded mainland
tourists mostly came from Fujian province which lies opposite Taiwan.

PRESIDENT CHEN CONGRATULATES BUSH ON RE-ELECTION

<TEXT>
<P>
President Chen Shui-bian on Thursday sent
his congratulations to U.S. President George W. Bush on his
re-election and offered Taiwan's assistance in efforts to maintain
stability in the Asia-Pacific region.
</P>
<P>
President Chen and Vice President Annette Lu separately sent
congratulatory messages to U.S. President Bush and Vice President
Dick Cheney immediately after Bush's challenger, Sen. John Kerry,
conceded defeat and the U.S. president's camp declared victory, top
presidential aide Su Tseng-chang said at a press conference Thursday.
</P>
<P>
In his message to Bush, President Chen said that the governments
and people of Taiwan and the United States have maintained close ties
and exchanges and have shared common values in democracy and human
rights.
</P>
<P>
Based on this, President Chen reiterated the Republic of China's
willingness to cooperate with the United States to joint maintain
peace and stability in the Asia-Pacific region and to actively seek
dialogue with mainland China so as to optimize the development of
cross-strait relations, according to Su.
</P>
<P>
President Chen stressed that Taiwan is also willing to cooperate
with the United States in arresting the proliferation of weapons of
mass destruction and terrorism and in enhancing world peace.

BUSH TO FURTHER PUSH FOR CROSS-STRAIT DIALOGUE: U.S. SCHOLARS
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Washington,  Nov.  3 (CNA)
(By W.C. Lin, J.L. Chi and P.C. Tang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Several U.S. scholars in Washington,
D.C., and former U.S. diplomats said Wednesday that President Bush is
expected to be more active during his second term in pushing for
cross-Taiwan Strait dialogue.
</P>
<P>
They also said that Taiwan and the United States might also need
to strengthen their dialogue in the future.
</P>
<P>
Bush won the presidential election held the same day after a
tough race against his Democratic opponent, Sen. John Kerry.
</P>
<P>
The scholars, including Bonnie Glaser, research fellow with the
Center for Strategic and International Studies; John Tkacik, research
fellow with the Heritage Foundation; Nat Bellocchi, former director
of the American Institute in Taiwan; and Mark Pratt, former State
Department official who had been stationed in Taipei and Beijing,
made the remarks while attending a seminar organized by the Formosan
Association of Public Affairs, a pro-Taiwan organization in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
According to Glaser, the central thought of the U.S. cross-strait
policy will remain unchanged, although there might be some minor
adjustments. However, she said that it is expected that the United
States will further encourage Taipei and Beijing to engage in direct
dialogue since the lack of such dialogue during the past several
years may have harmed their interests.
</P>
<P>
The scholar pointed out that U.S. National Security Adviser
Condoleezza Rice had asked Beijing what role Washington could play in
pushing for such dialogue during her recent visit to mainland China.
Glaser added that the United States could pass on the same message to
Taiwan in order to better understand what it can do to stabilize the
situation in the Taiwan Strait and maintain cross-strait peace.
</P>
<P>
Bellocchi, noting that Taipei and Beijing need to engage in
dialogue, said that Taipei and Washington might also need to
strengthen their communications.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Tkacik said that Bush's re-election will put Taiwan
more at ease as Sen. John Kerry seemed to be inclined to mainland
China and to recognizing the mainland's increasing influence in the
Pacific region.
</P>
<P>
If Taiwan wants to improve its relations with the United States,
the people of Taiwan should reach a consensus on the island's future,
he said, adding that if Taiwan wants to stand closer to the mainland
politically and internationally, then a veto against a special budget
on arms procurement will not be important.
</P>
<P>
If the Taiwan people want to separate from the mainland, then
their top priority is to have the capability to defend themselves,
Tkacik further said, noting that if Taiwan assumes the attitude of
"bystander" in terms of its own military defense, then the Bush
administration might have relatively less patience in relevant
matters.

COURT TO HAND DOWN RULING ON PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION RESULT SUIT
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Nov. 4 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Taiwan High Court is scheduled to issue
its ruling Thursday on a lawsuit filed by the opposition "pan-blue
alliance" of the Kuomintang and the People First Party to try to have
the March 20 presidential election result nullified.
</P>
<P>
The court will hand down its ruling in the high-profile case at 4
p.m. and call a press conference to explain the reasons behind the
ruling.
</P>
<P>
In expectation of a convergence of a large number of supporters
of the "pan-blue alliance" in front of the Taiwan High Court building
and possible clashes, 400 police officers have been mobilized and
barriers erected to help maintain order.
</P>
<P>
The court said that it has already given out 20 passes to members
of local and foreign media and 36 passes to regular citizens to hear
the ruling.
</P>
<P>
The "pan-blue alliance" filed the lawsuit on March 29 shortly
after its presidential candidate, Lien Chan, lost to incumbent
President Chen Shui-bian by a razor-thin margin in the March 20
election.
</P>
<P>
According to the regulations of the Presidential and Vice
Presidential Election and Recall Law, an election result
nullification suit can only be won if the election involved illegal
deeds or the vote count was incorrect.
</P>
<P>
To clarify the first part, or the opposition allegations that the
election-eve shooting of President Chen was staged to win sympathy
votes and that a national security mechanism was activated which
prevented many military personnel and police from leaving their posts
to cast their ballots, the court had summoned key personnel between
Aug. 31 and mid-September.
</P>
<P>
The officials summoned included Huang Shih-Cheng, former chairman
of the Central Election Commission, former National Defense Minister
Tang Yiau-min, former Presidential Secretary-General Chiou I-jen,
former National Security Council Secretary-General Kang Ning-hsian,
former president's top bodyguard Chen Tsai-fu, presidential
medical team executive secretary Huang Fang-yen and others.
</P>
<P>
As the court's hearings on the two contentious issues -- the
shooting and the activation of the national security mechanism --
were conducted in a closed-door way for security reasons, it is yet
to be seen on what the court will base its ruling or whether relevant
agencies have provided any written records or documents to back up
their testimonies.
</P>
<P>
To clarify concerns about the vote count, an unprecedented
islandwide recount of the more than 13 million ballots cast began May
10, focusing on the record number of 337,297 invalid ballots and
other contentious ballots.
</P>
<P>
Informed sources said that the court, after reexamining the
questionable ballots, will rule that the final vote count be changed,
adding however that the new vote count will not affect the
re-election of Chen. They also said the court will likely rule that
"no serious vote-fixing" could be established.
</P>
<P>
The court will also announce the final tallies of the votes
garnered by Chen and Lien in its ruling. According to the earlier
announcement by the Central Election Commission, President Chen
obtained 6,471,970 votes, while Lien garnered 6,442,452.
</P>
<P>
The Taiwan High Court, after summoning poll station staff for
testimony, found that most of the discrepancies or irregularities in
the ballots were caused by the holding of Taiwan's first national
referendum simultaneously with the presidential election, resulting
in election "flaws," but no "gross vote-fixing."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the "pan-blue alliance" said Thursday that no matter
what the Taiwan High Court's ruling is, it will be a "flawed" one
because it will fail to clarify many contentious points.
</P>
<P>
The alliance called for calm among its supporters and said that
it will continue to appeal to the court for the truth of the election
result.

NEW YORK STATE ASSEMBLYMAN-ELECT ON WAY HOME TO TAIWAN FOR CONFAB
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
New York,  Nov. 3 (CNA)
(By Eric Tseng and Deborah Kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
New York-based businessman and community
leader Jimmy K. Meng, who was elected a New York State Assemblyman in
Tuesday's legislative elections, is on his way home to Taiwan to take
part in a meeting to be convened by the Cabinet-level Overseas
Chinese Affairs Commission.
</P>
<P>
Meng, a graduate of National Taiwan Normal University and a
master's degree holder in administrative management from a university
in New York, defeated his two challengers in New York's 22nd District
for a landslide victory.
</P>
<P>
Meng will become the first Asian-American member of the New York
State Legislature after taking office shortly.
</P>
<P>
A Queens businessman who formerly headed the Flushing Chinese
Business Association, Meng beat New York State Assemblyman Barry
Grodenchik in the Democratic primaries in September to enter the race
against two candidates from two other parties for the assembly seat.
</P>
<P>
Meng, who emigrated to the United States in 1974, has been an
active community leader in New York over the past decades. He was
chosen the man of the year in New York State in 1997. In the same
year, he won the Ellis Island Medal of Honor awarded to outstanding
immigrants.
</P>
<P>
According to John Liu, who in 2000 became the first
Asian-American elected to the City Council of New York, the
Asian-American community could potentially become a powerful
political force. "The numbers continue to grow quickly, and the voter
turnout rates are potentially much greater than the overall turnout
rates of other groups," he said.
</P>
<P>
Meng is returning to Taipei to take part in the meeting in his
capacity as an overseas Chinese affairs commissioner of Taiwan.

<P>
A senior U.S. expert for East Asian
affairs said in Los Angeles Wednesday that the re-election of U.S.
President George W. Bush means the United States' cross-Taiwan Strait
policy of the past four years will continue unchanged.
</P>
<P>
Bush won re-election Tuesday after a tough race against his
Democratic rival, Sen. John Kerry.
</P>
<P>
Charles Wolf, senior advisor at the RAND Corporation, a renowned
U.S. think tank, said the Bush administration will honor its
commitment to the island and will continue to sell arms to Taiwan as
well as support Taiwan in its efforts to join international
organizations.
</P>
<P>
Noting that President Bush has always attached great importance
to the Taiwan Relations Act, the expert said that the president also
considers that all issues regarding the future of Taiwan should be
resolved peacefully and with the consent of the people of Taiwan.

<P>
Premier Yu Shyi-kun said Thursday that
Taiwan is gradually moving from customizing on an OEM basis to
creating its own brand names.
</P>
<P>
The premier made the remarks when he addressed the opening of a
one-day conference in Taipei of the Marketing Communication
Executives International (MCEI) on Asian brand names in the world.
</P>
<P>
The premier said the MCEI, in choosing Taiwan to hold the
conference, has been an encouragement and recognition of Taiwan's
development in the marketing communication industry, noting that at a
time of economic globalization, the businesses will have to rely on
research and development and the creation of their own brands to
ensure profits.
</P>
<P>
As Taiwan moves from customization to it own branding, it will
also take stock of experience gained from international branding, the
premier said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the top 10 brand names in Taiwan created a
production value of NT$121.1 billion (US$3.65 billion) in 2003,
compared with NT$140 billion this year, or a growth of 15.58 percent.
The production value of the top three brands -- Trend Micro
Enterprise, ASUStek Computer, and Acer -- increased to NT$80.2
billion, or a growth of 18.38 percent.
</P>
<P>
Kao Chi-shan, president of the MCEI Taipei Chapter, expressed the
hope that the conference will enable the participants to exchange
experiences and develop friendships to bring about opportunities for
future cooperation.

TAIWAN NEEDS TO REBUILD MUTUAL TRUST WITH U.S.: ACADEMICS
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Nov.  4 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taiwan must work harder to re-establish
communication channels and trust with the United States now that
President George W. Bush has been re-elected, a group of Academics
said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The United States' Taiwan policy is not expected to change and
will still be governed by the Three Communiques, namely the Shanghai
Communique, the Communique Establishing US-PRC Diplomatic Relations
and the US-PRC Joint Communique on arms sales; and the Taiwan
Relations Act (TRA), said Cheng Tuan-yao, a research fellow with the
Institute of International Relations, National Chengchi University.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Cheng noted, U.S. Secretary of State Colin Powell's
comment on cross-strait relations needing "a reunification that all
parties are seeking, " although later clarified by Powell as meaning
that the goal " really is to have a peaceful resolution of the
problem, " should serve as a reminder that Taiwan should be much more
careful than before in handling the cross-strait situation, beginning
with efforts to regain Washington's trust while bolstering
communications with officials there.
</P>
<P>
In his second term, Bush is expected to push harder for both
sides to resume dialogue since resumption of cross-strait talks is a
path that must be taken by both sides, Cheng said.
</P>
<P>
Cheng noted, however, that whether the long-stalled cross-strait
dialogue will be resumed next year as President Chen Shui-bian has
proposed remains to be seen.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Professor Chen Yu-chun from Chinese Culture
University's Institute of American Studies said that Washington's
stance that "Taiwan shall not seek independence while China refrains
from using force and both sides of the Taiwan Strait resolve their
differences via peaceful negotiations" is becoming more applicable as
Bush begins his second term in the White House.
</P>
<P>
Yang Yung-ming, an associate professor with National Taiwan
University, echoed Professor Chen's remarks, saying that President
Bush is expected to stick to the "one China" policy in regard to
cross-Taiwan Strait issues and will continue to use the Three
Communiques and the TRA as the bedrock of policies that the United
States applies to both sides of the Strait.
</P>
<P>
Yang noted, however, that all of these take into account the
primary interests of the United States.
</P>
<P>
He added that he expects that Washington will step in to push
both sides to resume cross-strait talks.

<P>
A total of 156 overseas Chinese delegates
from around the world are arriving in Taipei to take part in the
annual conference of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission (OCAC)
slated for Nov. 4-7, OCAC authorities said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The delegates coming from 31 countries in five continents include
New York-based businessman and community leader Jimmy K. Meng, who
was elected a New York State Assemblyman in Tuesday's legislative
elections.
</P>
<P>
Meng, who becomes the first Asian-American member of the New York
State Legislature after taking office shortly, is expected to arrive
in Taipei in time for a welcoming party at the Howard Hotel Thursday

</P>
<P>
Meng, who emigrated to the United States in 1974, has been an

chosen the man of the year in New York State in 1997. In the same
year, he won the Ellis Island Medal of Honor awarded to outstanding
immigrants.
</P>
<P>
The 2004 OCAC Conference will formally open Friday, with OCAC
Minister Chang Fu-mei presiding, followed by a working report by her;
an audience with President Chen Shui-bian; and debating and screening
proposals; in that order.
</P>

BUSH TO CONTINUE FRIENDSHIP WITH TAIWAN: REPUBLICANS ABROAD REP.
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Singapore, Nov. 4 (CNA)
(By Charles Kang and Y.F. Low)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
U.S. President George W. Bush is expected
to continue his policy of friendship toward Taiwan based on the
Taiwan Relations Act (TRA) during his second term in office, an
official of the Republicans Abroad said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Ross Darrell Feingold, chairman of the Asia-Pacific chapter of
the Republicans Abroad, said Bush's re-election was mainly due to his
advantage over Democratic challenger John Kerry in terms of his
policies on anti-terrorism, the economy, medical and education
reform.
</P>
<P>
The election results also reflected voters' disapproval of the
negative campaigning adopted by Kerry, Feingold said.
</P>
<P>
On Washington's policy toward Taiwan, Feingold said Bush is
expected to continue to befriend Taiwan in accordance with the TRA in
the next four years.
</P>
<P>
Feingold pointed out that the term "Taiwan Relations Act" was
left out deliberately from the China policy statement posted on the
Democratic Party's Web site during the run-up to the presidential
election.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, Feingold argued, Washington's policy toward Taiwan
would have become unpredictable had Kerry been elected president.
</P>
<P>
Now that Bush has been re-elected, a number of bilateral
cooperation programs including the on-going arms sales will carry on,
Feingold added.
</P>
<P>
He said the recent remarks by U.S. Secretary of State Colin
Powell on the status of Taiwan should not be misinterpreted as
Washington toughening its stance on cross-strait issues.
</P>
<P>
As a full-fledged democracy, the United States always publicizes
major policy changes, if any, via a news conference, but never via a
TV interview of one of its officials, according to Feingold.
</P>
<P>
He said the subsequent clarification by the U.S. Department of
State and Powell proved that his previous words had been a slip of
the tongue.
</P>
<P>
The fact that Bush approved an arms sales package to Taiwan soon
after he assumed office in 2000 and reaffirmed Washington's
commitment to defending Taiwan indicates his firm friendship toward
Taiwan, Feingold noted.
</P>
<P>
Most importantly, unlike the administration of President Bill
Clinton, which appointed a professional diplomat to serve as the
director of the Taipei office of the American Institute in Taiwan,
Bush has assigned Douglas Paal for the post in view of his political
influence in the U.S. government, Feingold said.
</P>
<P>
This decision was meant to upgrade the unofficial relations
between Taipei and Washington, and such policy will remain in place
after Bush's re-election, he said.
</P>
<P>
He predicted that the Bush administration will continue to urge
Taiwan and mainland China to seek a peaceful resolution to their
political dispute via dialogue, saying cross-strait stability is in
the interests of the United States.

TAIWAN MUST DEVELOP ITS OWN COMPETITIVE EDGE: ECONOMIC STRATEGIST
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Nov.  4 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The nation's top economic planner said
Thursday that the government must actively promote its six-year
national development plan and help domestic manufacturers set up
operations, and research and development centers in Taiwan to
develop their own competitive edge.
</P>
<P>
Hu Sheng-cheng, chairman of the Council for Economic Planning and
Development, pointed to the attractive investment nature of mainland
China because of its cheap labor, which has resulted in Taiwan
businesses relocating their manufacturing and assembly operations to
the mainland.
</P>
<P>
For this reason, Taiwan must make a distinctive separation from
mainland China, Hu said, adding that through the government's
"Challenge 2008" six-year national development plan, it will upgrade
domestic economic levels and attract foreign and domestic enterprises
to set up operations in Taiwan, as well as research and develop
centers.
</P>
<P>
He noted that Taiwan must ensure that major parts and components
are assembled in Taiwan, with minor sections manufactured in the
mainland. After assembly, the products will be sold under the
name of Taiwan-made to create more added value.

TAIWAN FISHERMEN DETAINED IN RUSSIA IN GOOD HEALTH: TAIWAN OFFICIALS
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Moscow, Nov. 4 (CNA)
(By Vlogya Chang and Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taiwan's representative office in Moscow has
reported the crew of a Taiwan deep-sea fishing vessel is in good
health after being detained off the Kuril Islands for trespassing
into Russian waters in late September.
</P>
<P>
Three officials from the office, including economic section chief
Tsao Su-yang, consular secretary Wei Hsin-chou and adviser Peng
Shou-shan, made the report after they visited the crew.
</P>
<P>
The trio flew nearly nine hours from Moscow to the Kuril Islands.
During their visit Oct. 28-31, they went to Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk to call
on related agencies to learn about the situation surrounding the
detained ship and went to Korsakov Harbor to see the crew of the
ship, the Kaohsiung-registered "Chenghui No. 1."
</P>
<P>
The officials originally wanted to go aboard to meet with the
crew, but the Russian side later arranged a ferry to let ship captain
Yen Jui-cheng come ashore because of turbulent seas.
</P>
<P>
Yen expressed appreciation to the officials for visiting and
bringing them fresh fruits and chocolates.
</P>
<P>
Yen said that the ship has five Taiwanese crew members, including
himself, and that Russian law enforcers have been friendly to
them. As they don't speak Russian or English, they asked Taiwan
officials to convey to the Russians that they had no intention of
running away.
</P>
<P>
The health and the spirit of the crew is fine, he said, adding
that there is enough rice, frozen vegetables, meat and fuel for the
time being. In the daytime, the ship is moored at sea, and sails
nearer land to avoid inclement weather.
</P>
<P>
According to Leskova, a local lawyer commissioned by the
Taiwanese owner of the ship, past experience in dealing with similar
cases has shown that as long as the owner provides a certain amount
of money to pay the fines, the ship and its crew will be released.
</P>
<P>
After the meeting, the officials expressed appreciation to
Kastornov, the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs 's representative
to the Kuril Islands, and appealed for him to complete the
investigation and trial as soon as possible so that the crew can be
released, and in the meantime, give necessary protection to them.

DPP EXPECTS STRENGTHENING OF U.S.-TAIWAN TIES IN BUSH'S 2ND TERM
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Nov. 4 (CNA)

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The re-election of U.S. President George W.
Bush will be beneficial to the consolidation of Taipei-Washington
relations and U.S. support for Taiwan, ruling Democratic Progressive
Party (DPP) politicians said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Lee Chun-yi, a leader of the DPP legislative caucus, said he is
confident that the relations between Taiwan and the United States
will continue to develop in a favorable direction as in past years.
</P>
<P>
The arms sales package to Taiwan, approved by Bush in his first
term, will remain the most important policy of the United States
toward Taiwan, Lee said.
</P>
<P>
Tsai Huang-liang, another leader of the caucus, said Bush has
been the friendliest U.S. president to Taiwan, which he said was
shown in the privileged treatment granted by the Bush administration
to President Chen Shui-bian and Vice President Annette Lu during
their transit stops in the United States.
</P>
<P>
According to Tsai, it is an overall diplomatic strategy of the
Bush administration to contain mainland China, and Taiwan must
continue to play a balancing role in the Asia-Pacific region in the
future to secure Washington's support for Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Sharing a similar view, Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU) Legislator
Chen Chien-ming said the national interests of the United States have
always been the main consideration of Washington's diplomatic
policies.
</P>
<P>
The triangular relations between Taipei, Washington and Beijing
will remain the same as before, Chen said.
</P>
<P>
The "pan-blue alliance" of the opposition Kuomintang (KMT) and
People First Party (PFP), however, said Bush's re-election will mean
heavier pressure on the government of President Chen, saying Bush has
"drawn a red line" for cross-strait relations.
</P>
<P>
Huang Teh-fu, whip of the KMT legislative caucus, said President
Chen must not make another attempt to break through the "red line, "
which Huang said would come at the cost of Washington's trust in
Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
PFP Legislator Chou Hsi-wei claimed that the recent remarks by
U.S. Secretary of State Colin Powell on the status of Taiwan have
indicated that the U.S. cross-strait policy is slanting toward
mainland China.
</P>
<P>
Chou urged President Chen to take concrete steps to try to
improve the country's relations with both the United States and the
mainland instead of paying lip service.
</P>
<P>
TSU Chairman Huang Chu-wen, meanwhile, called on the "pan-blue
alliance" to learn from the graceful manner of Democrat John Kerry
and admit defeat in the March 20 presidential election.
</P>
<P>
Saying the results of the election have been decided upon by the
people, Huang asked the alliance to stop wasting social resources on
meaningless legal processes.
</P>
<P>
Disagreeing with the argument, KMT spokesman Chang Jung-kung said
there is no comparison between the case of Taiwan and that of the
United States.
</P>
<P>
Without the interference of an election-eve shooting of the
president and other irregularities, the results of the U.S. election
are definitely not as disputable as that of Taiwan's, Chang claimed.

<P>
Proving that justice is indeed blind, a
young Taiwan man with a severe visual impairment passed the bar exam,
it was announced Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Lee Ping-hung, 25, was one of the 399 aspirants who managed to
pass this year's bar exam. Only 8 percent of the 4,979 hopefuls
passed the test. Lee ranked 128th among those who made it.
</P>
<P>
"The result didn't come as an accident. It's a hard-won
achievement, and I believe that other physically challenged people
can make it so long as they make devoted efforts, " said Lee, who is
almost totally blind.
</P>
<P>
Lee, a graduate of National Taipei University, said he is
grateful for his parents' encouragement and full support in his
academic and career pursuit.
</P>
<P>
"I once intended to give up after failing twice in the annual
lawyer qualification examination. Thanks to my parents'
encouragement, I continued preparations for this year's test, " Lee
recalled.
</P>
<P>
Examination Yuan President Yao Chia-wen presented souvenirs to
Lee Thursday after unveiling the list of this year's successful
hopefuls.
</P>
<P>
Noting that Taiwan doesn't have any blind lawyer presently, Yao
urged local legal firms to offer opportunities for Lee to work as an
apprentice. Lee must undergo a five-month apprenticeship before he
can formally become a lawyer.
</P>
<P>
Among Asian countries, Japan already has two blind lawyers. Yao
said Lee would be Asia's third blind lawyer.
</P>
<P>
Yao, himself a lawyer, said blind people face many challenges in
their daily life and at the workplace. Taiwan's court system and bar
associations may not be prepared for having a blind lawyer, Yao said,
adding that certain practical issues, such as whether to allow a
blind lawyer to appoint an assistant to read legal documents on his
behalf in courtrooms, has to be addressed now.

TSU URGES LIEN, SOONG TO APOLOGIZE FOR CAUSING DISORDER
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Nov.  4 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The legislative caucus of the opposition
Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU) urged the defeated presidential and
vice presidential candidates Thursday to apologize for causing social
disorder over the past few months due to their refusal to concede
defeat.
</P>
<P>
The TSU, an ally of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP), made the call shortly after the Taiwan High Court rejected an
opposition "pan-blue alliance" lawsuit contesting the March 20
presidential election and upheld President Chen Shui-bian's narrow
re-election victory.
</P>
<P>
Legislator Hung Chung-yuan, who concurrently serves as the TSU's
legislative whip, said the "pan-blue alliance's" two top leaders --
Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Lien Chan and People First Party Chairman
(PFP) James Soong -- who teamed up to challenge Chen and Vice
President Annette Lu's re-election bid -- should make a public
apology for all the disturbances and chaos in the wake of the March
20 vote simply because of their refusal to concede defeat.
</P>
<P>
Huang also urged Lien and Soong, as well as their supporters, to
respect the court ruling and to refrain from staging violent street
protests as they did in the wake of the election. He further
suggested that the two opposition leaders give up their right to
petition their case to the Supreme Court to avoid a further waste of
national resources.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Huang suggested that Lien and Soong publicly concede
defeat and offer their congratulations to Chen and Lu in a show of
sportsmanship and democratic spirit.
</P>
<P>
After more than seven months of investigations, the High Court
rejected the opposition's claims that the vote was marred by fraud
and a shooting that slightly injured Chen a day before his victory by
a razor-thin margin.
</P>
<P>
The ruling ended seven months of hearings, ballot recounting,
cross-debates, consultations and investigations into various
contentious points that posed a serious challenge to one of Asia's
youngest democracies. The disputed vote was only Taiwan's third
direct presidential election.
</P>
<P>
Wu Ching-yuan, the High Court's presiding judge, said: "We
announce hereby that the petition to nullify the election outcome is
rejected."
</P>
<P>
According to the results of an unprecedented islandwide vote
recount, the verdict said, Chen actually garnered 6,461,177 ballots
compared to Lien's 6,435,614, in the bitterly fought race. Chen won
by a slim margin of 25,563 ballots, down some 3,000 from the vote
count announced by the Central Election Commission after the
election.
</P>
<P>
Describing the 400-page verdict as a "precedent-setting
masterpiece, " High Court spokesman Wen Yao-yuan said the ruling can
withstand stringent scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
"We hope all social quarters can respect our judicial system and
refrain from complicating the case. Judicial cases should be resolved
by judicial means," Wen said.
</P>
<P>
According to Article 114 of the Presidential and Vice
Presidential Election and Recall Law, Wen said, the plaintiff can
appeal the case to the Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
Lien has insisted that the election should be held again because
of alleged ballot tampering. He also claimed that thousands of police
and soldiers could not vote because the president put them on special
alert after the shooting. Chen's administration has denied Lien's
allegations, and the opposition has consistently failed to provide
any compelling evidence to support it's claims.
</P>
<P>
Before the ruling was handed down, Presidential Office
Secretary-General Su Tseng-chang called on the opposition to refrain
from protesting violently.
</P>
<P>
"Our nation can't be split any more. We need unity. Society needs
stability," Su said.

SCHOLAR PROPOSES MAKING TAIWAN NUCLEAR-FREE COUNTRY
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Nov.  4 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
To display the government's resolve to
maintain peace and prevent Taiwan from being attacked by nuclear
arms, a scholar has raised the concept of making Taiwan and the
Penghu, Kinmen and Matsu islands into nuclear-free zones.
</P>
<P>
Yuan I, a researcher at the Institute of International Relations
of National Chengchi University, raised the idea Wednesday at a
seminar jointly sponsored by the institute and the Academia Sinica
Institute of European and American Studies to discuss the
U.S. presidential election and Taipei-Beijing-Washington ties.
</P>
<P>
Yuan said that although Taiwan and mainland China have been under
separate rule for more than 50 years, a situation not contemplated by
the existing modes applied in the world's non-nuclear states,
relevant international practices could serve as an important
reference for Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
According to Yuan, non-nuclear countries are banned from using
nuclear material for nuclear weapons and their exports of nuclear
material and equipment must be conducted in ways consistent with the
objectives underlined by the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Program.
</P>
<P>
Currently, the non-nuclear countries are mainly in Latin America,
the South Pacific, Africa and Southeast Asia, he said.
</P>
<P>
Yuan suggested that the government openly declare that it will
only use Taiwan's nuclear materials and facilities for peaceful
purposes and pledge that it will not store, use, manufacture, possess
or deploy any form of nuclear arms.
</P>
<P>
A public declaration to make Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen and Matsu
into nuclear-free zones is aimed at inviting Beijing to reciprocate
by renouncing its use of nuclear weapons against Taiwan and providing
a security guarantee to Taiwan, he said.
</P>
<P>
He claimed that such a declaration would be the first step toward
ending an arms race between Taiwan and the mainland and a historic
turning point for the two sides to show mutual respect and mutual
trust.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, it would be an effective way to underline
Taiwan's non-nuclear determination to the world and provide the
country with insurance that it would be free from nuclear attack, he
added.

TAICHUNG HARBOR FREE TRADE ZONE TO BEGIN OPERATIONS NEXT YEAR
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Nov. 4 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A free trade zone (FTZ) project at Taichung
Harbor in central Taiwan obtained government approval Thursday from
the Cabinet-level Council for Economic Planning and Development
(CEPD), with initial operations slated to begin in October next year.
</P>
<P>
CEPD Vice Chairman Yeh Ming-feng said that the FTZ has been
projected by the Ministry of Transportation and Communications (MOTC)
to accommodate container shipping, distribution and warehousing
companies because of the port's vast hinterland, convenient location
and comprehensive facilities.
</P>
<P>
Yeh said that the government plans to develop the port into a
full-dimension international port by introducing processing and
manufacturing businesses in the FTZ.
</P>
<P>
According to the CEPD vice chairman, Taichung Harbor has a total
area of 3,760 hectares, with 2,800 hectares of land area. The
Changpin Industrial District, the Chungkang Export Processing Zone,
the Central Taiwan Science-based Industrial Park and the
Chingchuankang International Airport are located nearby.
</P>
<P>
At present, more than 10 enterprises, including Evergreen Marine
Corp (Taiwan) Ltd., Taiwan's largest container shipping company,
have expressed willingness to open up shop in the FTZ, Yeh said.
</P>
<P>
In the initial stage, 181 hectares of land will be available for
the zone's first-phase operations, while an additional 278 hectares
of land will be allocated for the second-phase business scheduled to
begin in October 2006, he said.
</P>
<P>
Taichung Harbor will become the third Taiwan port to have an FTZ
after Keelung in the north and Kaohsiung in the south, MOTC officials
said.
</P>
<P>
The Keelung FTZ is receiving applications from companies wishing
to set up there, while the Kaohsiung FTZ is scheduled to begin
operations in January next year.
</P>
<P>
In the future, there will be at least seven FTZs around the
country, which are expected to attract 1,000 companies and to create
about 30,000 jobs, with total investment capital amounting to NT$67.8
billion and an overall production value of NT$162.5 billion (US$4.85
billion), they said.

TOURIST ARRIVALS UP BY NEARLY 40 PERCENT IN NINE MONTHS
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Nov.  4 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Foreign tourist arrivals to Taiwan in the
first nine months of this year topped 2.13 million, up by nearly 40
percent compared to the previous year's level, the Tourism Bureau
under the Ministry of Transportation and Communications (MOTC)
reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
According to bureau statistics, foreign tourists made a total of
more than 2.13 million visits to Taiwan in the first three quarters
of the year, marking a rise of 39 percent over the year-earlier
level, although still a slight drop of 1.92 percent from the 2002
level.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan's tourism-related businesses were seriously hit last year
by the outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) around
the world.
</P>
<P>
With a government drive to promote Taiwan tourism that started
early this year, the number of foreign tourist arrivals has been
increasing now that the SARS threat has abated.
</P>
<P>
Compared to the 2002 records, the number of travelers from South
Korea in the nine-month period grew by about 70 percent, bureau
officials said, attributing the increase to newly established charter
flight services between the two countries. The number of visitors
from Malaysia has also increased for two consecutive years, they
added.
</P>
<P>
However, they pointed out that the numbers of tourists from
Japan, Hong Kong and Macau were still smaller for the
January-September period compared to the 2002 numbers, with those
from Japan posting the largest fall of 14 percent.

MOFA REAFFIRMS VALIDITY OF ROC-VANUATU DIPLOMATIC TIES
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Nov.  4 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA)
reaffirmed Thursday the validity of the establishment of full-fledged
diplomatic relations between the Republic of China and the South
Pacific island nation of Vanuatu a day earlier.
</P>
<P>
MOFA spokesman Michel Lu said the rumor of the so-called
"invalidity" of the newly formed ROC-Vanuatu diplomatic ties was
deliberately spread by the mainland Chinese embassy in Vanuatu.
</P>
<P>
"As Vanuatu's top political leader, Prime Minister Serge Vohor is
definitely eligible to sign a joint communique with the ROC on the
establishment of diplomatic ties on behalf of the Vanuatu government
and people," Lu said.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on foreign wire service reports that Vohor's signing
of the joint communique with ROC Foreign Affairs Minister Tan Sun Chen
in Taipei was a "personal act" without the prior approval of the
Vanuatu government, Vice Foreign Minister Michael Ying-mao Kau said
the reports were incorrect.
</P>
<P>
Kau said Vohor consulted with the Vanuatuan Cabinet before he
left for Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Kau said, Vohor informed the Vanuatu deputy prime
minister Wednesday evening of the signing of the joint communique.
</P>
<P>
"Vohor has asked his deputy to inform the other Cabinet members
of the event, " Kau said, adding that the establishment of
ROC-Vanuatu diplomatic ties is valid and beyond question.
</P>
<P>
Kau said Vohor had to keep his Taipei trip secret to avoid
pressure from mainland China. Vanuatu forged diplomatic ties with
Beijing in 1982 and signed an agreement with Taipei on mutual
recognition in 1992 when Vohor was Vanuatu's foreign minister.
</P>
<P>
"Twice before, Vanuatu has had the intention of establishing
diplomatic relations with the ROC, but because Beijing exerted
pressure, the relationship did not completely come to fruition, " Kau
said, without elaborating.
</P>
<P>
Stressing that Vanuatu is a sovereign state, Kau said it is free
to choose its friends. Moreover, Kau went on, Vohor has also
expressed his desire for continued friendship with the mainland.
</P>
<P>
Kau further said the ROC has no intention of conducting a
"zero-sum" game with the mainland in the diplomatic arena. "What we
want is to expand our international space. We look forward to
peaceful co-existence with mainland China," he added.
</P>
<P>
The establishment of diplomatic ties with the South Pacific
island state marks a modest victory in Taiwan's efforts to break the
mainland's diplomatic embargo. The tie-up brings the number of
countries that have official diplomatic relations with the ROC back
to 27, after the Caribbean island nation of Dominica switched
diplomatic recognition from Taipei to Beijing in March.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Minister Tan Sun Chen said after signing the joint
communique that Taiwan's pursuit of an "international space" cannot
be suppressed by the mainland's missile threat.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on the same occasion, Vohor said his country's decision
to establish diplomatic ties with the ROC is not designed to anger
any other country or to make an enemy of the mainland.
</P>
<P>
"We do not refuse to be friends with China, but the decision was
made based on the welfare of our people," Vohor said.
</P>
<P>
About 200,000 people live in Vanuatu, a group of around 80
islands located between Australia and Fiji.

PRESIDENT PLEASED WITH COURT RULING ON ELECTION: AIDE
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Nov. 4 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President Chen Shui-bian and Vice President
Annette Lu are pleased with a Taiwan High Court ruling against an
opposition "pan-blue alliance" lawsuit contesting the March 20
presidential election, Chen's chief of staff said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Presidential Office Secretary-General Su Tseng-chang made the
remarks after the High Court earlier in the day rejected the lawsuit
filed by the "pan-blue alliance" of the Kuomintang (KMT) and the
People First Party (PFP) and upheld the Chen-Lu ticket's narrow
re-election victory.
</P>
<P>
"Chen and Lu are pleased with the court ruling and hope all
politicians and citizens will stand united to defend Taiwan's young
democracy, " Su said, adding that Taiwan cannot be split and needs
unity and stability.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the rule of law is the foundation of democracy, Su
said democracy cannot mature and flourish without respect for this
basic principle.
</P>
<P>
"The president and vice president have also asked me to convey
their gratitude for the hard work of High Court judges and all the
other people involved in the grueling vote recount as well as
investigation and trial of contentious points over the past seven
months," Su said.
</P>
<P>
Su said Chen will continue to do his utmost to unify the country
in line with the principles of "listening, understanding, and respect
for law."
</P>
<P>
The High Court rejected the opposition's claims that the vote was
marred by fraud and a shooting that slightly injured Chen a day
before his victory by a razor-thin margin over his challenger, KMT
Chairman Lien Chan.
</P>
<P>
The ruling ended seven months of hearings, ballot recounting,
cross-debates, consultations and investigations into various
contentious points that posed a serious challenge to one of Asia's
youngest democracies. The disputed vote was only Taiwan's third
direct presidential election.

OPPOSITION LOSES CASE AGAINST PRESIDENT
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei, Nov. 4 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Taiwan High Court ruled against defeated
presidential candidate Lien Chan and his running mate James Soong in
a lawsuit they brought seeking to invalidate the re-election of
President Chen Shui-bian and his running mate, Vice President Annette
Lu.
</P>
<P>
After seven months of trial, a panel of three High Court judges
ruled that the plaintiffs failed to prove their claims that the
ballot counting in the election was not accurate and that Chen and Lu
had deliberately prevented some voters from exercising their right to
vote.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the court who explained to the media the main
reasons behind the decision said a recount of the ballots found that
both the Lien-Soong ticket and the Chen-Lu ticket garnering fewer
votes than the Central Election Commission had declared.
However, this would not reverse the results of the election, as Lien
and Soong were still 25,563 votes short of Chen and Lu after the
recount.
</P>
<P>
There is no evidence to substantiate the plaintiffs' claim that
Chen engineered an assassination attempt against himself on the eve
of the March 20 election to attract sympathy votes, the spokesman
said, citing an investigation report presented by U.S. forensic
expert Henry Lee.
</P>
<P>
Even if the incident is clouded by question-marks -- as the
plaintiffs claim -- the spokesman quoted the judgment as saying that
this does not constitute grounds to believe the assassination was a
political ploy by Chen.
</P>
<P>
As for the plaintiffs' claim that Chen skewed the election in his
favor by holding a referendum concurrently with the election, the
court said this is not a totally groundless argument, but nor is it
an obstruction to the public's free exercise of the right to vote,
which under the law would render the victory of the winner in the
election invalid.
</P>
<P>
For the same reason, the court said, the plaintiffs' claim that
Chen and Lu deliberately postponed their appearance in public after
the shooting to fuel public agony in an attempt to manipulate public
opinion to their favor is also no justification to negate their
election victory.
</P>
<P>
Regarding to the plaintiffs' argument that the precautionary
measures taken by the government for national security after the
March 19 shooting unreasonably stripped some military personnel and
police officers of their right to vote, the court said that the
Ministry of National Defense, the National Police Agency and the
Coast Guard Administration all denied that they increased the number
of staff on duty or on reserve duty after the March 19 shooting.
</P>
<P>
In addition to overruling the plaintiffs' requests, the court
ordered Lien and Soong to bear the cost of the lawsuit, but did not
say whether this would include the NT$70 million (US$2.1 million)
for the recount.
</P>
<P>
The copy of the judgment, numbering about 400 pages with an
additional 7,500 pages of appendix, will be send to the parties in
the case next week, according to the court.
</P>
<P>
Lien and Soong who did not show up in court to hear the judgment,
appeared at a joint news conference later and said they will appeal
against the judgment to the Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
Calling the day a dark day in the history of Taiwan's democracy,
Lien said he was disappointed with the court's ruling and will not
stop the "fight for justice" in the case.
</P>
<P>
Claiming that many irregularities in the election were not
investigated in the trial, the Kuomintang (KMT) chairman urged the
supporters of his party and of Soong's People First Party (PFP) to
translate their indignation with the judgment into votes for the KMT
and the PFP in the upcoming legislative election.
</P>
<P>
PFP lawmaker Liu Wen-hsiung said his party was disappointed but
not surprised by the judgment, claiming that the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) had already hinted at the outcome of the
trial beforehand.
</P>
<P>
However, Liu said his party will contend the case in the court
rather than on the streets via demonstrations.
</P>
<P>
The DPP was pleased by the results of the trial. Its whip at the
Legislative Yuan, Tsai Huang-liang, said the two opposition parties
should respect the court's decision and reconcile themselves to the
result.
</P>
<P>
The DPP's political ally, the Taiwan Solidarity Union, called on
the KMT and PFP to apologize to Chen.
</P>
<P>
In anticipation of the failure of Lien and Soong in the case, a
group of their supporters rallied outside the court before the
results of the trial were released at 4 p.m.
</P>
<P>
Waving posters reading "justice is dead" and "no end to protest
until truth is out." they were kept out of the court by barricades
erected by police and dispersed after only a short confrontation with
the police.
</P>
<P>
Lien and Soong brought the lawsuit against Chen and Lu initially
March 20, hours after the ballots had been counted.
</P>
<P>
That suit was rejected by the court on the grounds that the
Central Election Commission (CEC) had not yet officially declared the
results.
</P>
<P>
Lien and Soong initiated the suit again March 29, or three days
after the CEC declared Chen and Lu the winners.
</P>
<P>
It was the first time a defeated candidate had challenged the
results of a presidential election in court.

PREMIER URGES 'PAN-BLUE' TICKET TO LEARN FROM KERRY, GORE
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Nov.  5 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Premier Yu Shui-kun on Friday urged Lien
Chan, the "pan-blue alliance" candidate in the March 20 presidential
election, and his running mate, James Soong, to learn from Al Gore
and John Kerry and come to terms with the reality of their election
loss with an open mind.
</P>
<P>
The premier made the appeal after the Taiwan High Court, after
court proceedings lasting over seven months, on Thursday ruled
against the lawsuit filed by the "pan-blue alliance" of the
Kuomintang (KMT) and the People First Party (PFP) to try to have the
election result nullified. Both Lien and Soong have said they will
appeal the decision to the Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
Premier Yu said the "pan-blue alliance" couldn't provide evidence
to back up their claims of voting irregularities in the high court
trials, adding that the ruling has cleared the names of President
Chen Shui-bian and Vice President Annette Lu.
</P>
<P>
The premier said that both the KMT and the PFP should have
national unity in mind and stop their headstrong actions for the sake
of the wellbeing of the public.
</P>
<P>
Yu said that even if Lien can't concede defeat graciously as
Kerry did after the U.S. presidential election, he can at least learn
from Gore, who said after the 2000 election that while he strongly
disagrees with the Supreme Court's ruling, he accepts it.
</P>
<P>
The premier said that Gore and Kerry are models for Lien and
Soong, criticizing both "pan-blue alliance" candidates for plunging
society into ethnic rivalry and in turn affecting the stock market
and the economy over the past seven months simply to maintain their
leadership of the KMT and the PFP.
</P>
<P>
They must now try to open their minds and accept the facts to
work for the nation's long-term wellbeing, the premier urged.

KINGSTON TECH TO FOOT BILL FOR 'PAN BLUE' LAWSUIT
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Nov. 5 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
California-based Kingston Technology Corp.
will foot part of the bill for the March 20 presidential election
vote recount and the legal costs for the suit filed by the opposition
"pan-blue alliance" to try to have the election result nullified.
</P>
<P>
The Taiwan High Court on Thursday upheld the narrow re-election
of President Chen Shui-bian and Vice President Annette Lu and ruled
that the "pan-blue alliance" challengers -- Lien Chan of the
Kuomintang (KMT) and his running mate James Soong of the People First
Party (PFP) -- would have to pay a portion of the legal costs of the
suit and the nationwide vote recount which together are estimated at
more than NT$77 million (US$2.3 million).
</P>
<P>
As a result, Lien and Soong will only have to pay some NT$16.96
million (US$507,784) for the expenses. The Lien-Soong ticket had
already put forward NT$60 million as a guarantee deposit prior to the
kick-off of the recount on May 10 of the 16,507,179 ballots which
took nine days to complete.
</P>
<P>
Kingston Tech, co-founded by Chinese-Americans John Tu and David
Sun, donated NT$100 million (US$2.99 million) in April to help pay
for the recount in the hopes of ending the election controversy and
allowing the social situation in Taiwan to return to normal. Sun then
consigned the private Judicial Reform Society to manage the fund in
Taipei.
</P>
<P>
Kingston Tech is one of the leading module manufacturers in the
world.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the Judicial Reform Society said Thursday that so
long as Lien and Soong do not appeal, the company will make the
NT$16.96 million payment at once.
</P>
<P>
The money left over after Lien and Soong's legal fees are paid
should go to charity to promote ethnic harmony in Taiwan in
accordance with Sun's intentions when he made the donation, the
spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Upon making the donation in April, Sun said it was non-political
and had nothing to do with his pro-alliance sentiments. "Ethnic
divisions appeared after the election, and the generosity and
forbearance among the people was destroyed, " he claimed, adding
however that "with the passage of time, the wounds should be healed
through tolerance and rationality."
</P>
<P>
Sun and Tu became millionaires when they sold a large chunk of
their memory chip-making company in 1996 and made headlines when they
decided to share US$100 million of the windfall with their employees,
which numbered roughly 450 at the time.
</P>
<P>
Thursday's ruling ended seven months of hearings, ballot
recounting, debates, consultations and investigations into various
contentious points that posed a serious challenge to Taiwan's system
of democracy.
</P>
<P>
Supporters of the "pan-blue alliance" staged several large
protest rallies in the days after the March 20 election against what
they perceived as an "unfair election" which they claimed was marred
by voting irregularities and the election-eve shooting of Chen and
Lu.
</P>
<P>
The protestors demanded a ballot recount as well as the
establishment of an independent committee to investigate the shooting
that they said swayed the election in Chen's favor. Although both
Chen and Lien agreed to a recount, differences remained between the
two sides on who should foot the bill.
</P>
<P>
Lien and Soong filed a lawsuit hours after the March 20 election,
but the suit was rejected by the court on the grounds that the
Central Election Commission (CEC) had not yet officially declared the
results. They then initiated another suit on March 29, three days
after the CEC declared Chen and Lu the winners.
</P>
<P>
It marked the first time in Taiwan's history that a defeated
candidate challenged the results of a presidential election in court.

M'LAND TOUGHENS ATTITUDE AGAINST TAIWAN'S TRM QUESTIONS AT WTO: SOURCE
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Geneva, Nov. 4 (CNA)
(By C.H. Lu and P.C. Tang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mainland China has toughened its attitude in
dealing with questions raised by Taiwan within the World Trade
Organization (WTO) Transitional Review Mechanism (TRM) which
evaluates Beijing's compliance with its WTO accession agreement, a
well-placed trade source said in Geneva Thursday.
</P>
<P>
According to its accession agreement, mainland China is subject
to eight years of evaluation by the TRM from the time of becoming a
member of the world trade regulatory body in 2001.
</P>
<P>
The source said that mainland China has basically been against
the TRM and has continued since its accession to frustrate the
efforts of WTO members, including Taiwan, in using the mechanism to
evaluate its trade policies.
</P>
<P>
Various WTO committees began from the end of this September's TRM
meetings to examine China's transitional trade policies, and mainland
delegates have refused to give responses to questions raised by
Taiwan, claiming that they did not receive the written questions sent
by the island's delegation to the WTO and pointing out that the
written materials put forth by Taiwan were "ineffective documents, "
according to the source.
</P>
<P>
The source cited the TRM meeting held by the WTO Subsidies and
Countervailing Measures Committee Thursday as an example, saying that
although the WTO secretariat had sent written questions raised by
Taiwan on Oct. 20 to all the WTO members Oct. 22, mainland China's
representatives still claimed at the meeting that they had not
received any such questions.
</P>
<P>
The source said that compared with the last two years, mainland
China has adopted a tougher attitude in dealing with TRM questions
raised by Taiwan this year. In the previous two years, mainland China
at least gave indirect answers to Taiwan's TRM questions.
</P>
<P>
As a matter of fact, mainland China has also dealt insincerely
with the TRM questions raised by other WTO members, including the
United States, the European Union and Japan, causing much frustration
among the WTO members, according to the source.

ABDUCTED TAIWAN BUSINESSMAN FREED THROUGH CROSS-STRAIT COOPERATION
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
A Taiwan businessman abducted in mainland
China late last month has been freed thanks to close cooperation
between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait, the Criminal
Investigation Bureau (CIB) said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The businessman, surnamed Wang, currently runs a shoe factory in
Foshan in the southeastern mainland Chinese province of Guangdong. He
called his wife in Tainan, southern Taiwan Oct. 25, asking her to
raise a ransom of NT$2.5 million (US$75,300) , but the figure was
increased to NT$6 million two days later.
</P>
<P>
His wife, after checking with the company's employees, found that
Wang and his mainland Chinese chauffeur were abducted by five
knife-wielding and gun-toting men when he was getting into his car
after shopping.
</P>
<P>
The CIB was enlisted to help in the case. It provided related
information to the Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) , a
quasi-official body formed to handle cross-strait affairs resulting
from cross-strait exchanges, which in turn contacted security police
in mainland China.
</P>
<P>
Mainland Chinese security police on Thursday made a raid on the
place where Wang was being held and arrested six mainland Chinese
involved in the abduction operation.

VP PUSHES FOR 'TAIWAN FRIENDS ASSOCIATIONS' AROUND THE WORLD
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Nov. 5 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Vice President Annette Lu exhorted members
of the Cabinet-level Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission (OCAC)
Friday to make the most of their good relations with communities
around the globe to establish "Taiwan friends associations" in all
major cities.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the opening of the 2004 annual conference of the OCAC
in Taipei, Lu urged OCAC members to help optimize Taiwan's diplomatic
efforts by tying overseas Chinese affairs to the diplomatic front.
</P>
<P>
Lu said that all Taiwan citizens should feel proud and fortunate
to be Taiwanese. Although Taiwan is geographically small, she went
on, the country is big in terms of global competitiveness, economic
growth, export capacity and women's participation in politics.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan is too strategically important to let go from mainland
China, which has for long schemed to build itself into a new Chinese
empire -- a giant map that would include Taiwan, Lu said.
</P>
<P>
Lu said that Beijing has maintained a mentality of denial toward
the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) -ruled Republic of China
government over the past four years in the belief that President Chen
Shui-bian would not be re-elected.
</P>
<P>
But a Taiwan High Court ruling Thursday that reconfirmed the
validity of Chen's re-election leaves no room for Beijing to ignore
the DPP any longer, Lu argued.
</P>
<P>
Beijing officials will have no other option but to return to the
negotiating table after the DPP scores another victory in the
year-end legislative elections, Lu said.
</P>
<P>
She added that Taiwan is ready for a resumption of the
cross-strait dialogue, while working to establish a cross-strait
peace development committee.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, OCAC Minister Chang Fu-mei urged in a report delivered
at the conference all OCAC members residing abroad to help accelerate
the implementation of various projects that Lu has initiated to
optimize Taiwan's diplomacy overseas.
</P>
<P>
The projects include the Democratic Pacific Assembly and
agricultural promotion and city-building plans in Central and South
America, Chang said.
</P>
<P>
A total of 156 overseas Chinese delegates from 31 countries on
five continents are taking part in the annual OCAC conference, which
will run until Sunday.
</P>
<P>
President Chen received the 156 overseas Chinese delegates at an
audience held at the Presidential Office earlier that day.
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, Vice Foreign Affairs Minister Michael Y.M. Kau and
Mainland Affairs Council Chairman Joseph Wu will deliver keynote
speeches to the conference, which will also include two-way
discussions, OCAC officials said.
</P>
<P>
The delegates are also expected to exchange views with government
officials on overseas efforts in campaigning for changing the
official name of the country and efforts to push for Taiwan's
accession to the United Nations and other world organizations.

MAC RENEWS CALLS FOR CHARTER FLIGHT TALKS WITH MAINLAND CHINA
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Nov. 5 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) again
urged mainland China Friday to respond to Taiwan's call for official
talks on the opening of direct charter flights across the Taiwan
Strait during the upcoming Chinese New Year holiday.
</P>
<P>
At a regular press conference, MAC Vice Chairman Chiu Tai-san
said Taiwan is ready in all aspects regarding talks over the charter
flight issue and that the only thing absent is Beijing's willingness
to discuss the issue.
</P>
<P>
So long as Beijing responds, any time would be suitable to begin
the talks, Chiu stressed.
</P>
<P>
Whether the New Year charter flight talks will materialize in the
near future hinges on three key issues: Beijing's willingness; the
technical issues about which Beijing is concerned; and Beijing's
attitude toward Taiwan after Taiwan's Dec. 11 legislative elections,
Chiu added.
</P>
<P>
In late October, Chiu urged Beijing to authorize an appropriate
person or persons to negotiate with Taiwan on the opening of direct
charter flights for the New Year season.
</P>
<P>
Chiu said the Republic of China government has demonstrated
goodwill and flexibility toward the proposal that carriers from both
sides of the Taiwan Strait could operate direct non-stop charter
flights during the Chinese New Year holiday, which will begin Feb. 6,
2005 and run through Feb. 13.
</P>
<P>
"We are hopeful that neither side will set any political
prerequisite for negotiations on the services, which are for the
convenience of Taiwan businessmen operating in mainland China who
intend to return home for family reunions, " Chiu said, adding that
the MAC, which charts Taiwan's policy toward the mainland, will name
a representative to discuss relevant technical details as soon as
possible.
</P>

With Beijing's consent, Taiwan carriers operated special charter
flights between Shanghai and Taipei/Kaohsiung via Hong Kong/Macau
during the 2003 Chinese New Year period.
</P>
<P>
Such services were not offered during the 2004 Chinese New Year
holiday because Beijing insisted that mainland carriers be allowed to
offer the same services, while declining to negotiate the technical
details with Taiwan. The ROC government said that as the opening of
two-way, non-stop cross-strait charter flight services involves the
exercise of public authority, prior negotiations are necessary.

NO ADDITIONAL SPENDING AFTER NT$610.8 B ARMS PROCUREMENT PACKAGE: MND
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Nov.  5 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Vice Minister of National Defense Tsai
Ming-hsien said Friday that a special budget of NT$610.8 billion
(US$18.23 billion) for arms procurements from the United States will
obtain three major items and will not require extra major spending
afterwards, as had been speculated.
</P>
<P>
Tsai was referring to the special budget proposal made by the
Executive Yuan in June to buy six batteries of anti-missile Patriot
III missiles, eight diesel-electric submarines and a squadron of 12
anti-submarine aircraft over a 15-year period starting 2005, saying
that all relevant weaponry systems and parts are included in the
special budget.
</P>
<P>
He said that the government will monitor spending carefully,
adding that the expenditure for repair and maintenance, as well as
the logistics for the three major arms procurement items, will be
appropriated in annual budgets and will not require a need for
further special budgets.
</P>
<P>
Tsai made the remarks during an interpellation session in the
Legislative Yuan, reaffirming again the necessity and importance of
obtaining the weapons.
</P>
<P>
Legislator Wang Chung-yu of the opposition Kuomintang questioned
remarks by Premier Yu Shyi-kun that those who oppose the arms
procurement are in the same league as mainland China, which he said
has blocked the opportunity for rational debate on the issue.
</P>
<P>
The premier pointed out that the mainland is the one who least
wants Taiwan to procure arms.
</P>
<P>
Yu also said that the items in the new package are more advanced
and therefore more expensive than those purchased in the past and
that the legislators should not question the government on the items
or the spending, but should engage in rational debate.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, more than 100 mothers and their children, accompanied
by Legislator Lee Wen-chung of the ruling Democratic Progressive
Party (DPP), read a declaration in front of the Legislative Yuan
stating that children should be allowed to grow in peace and
happiness, to lend support to the arms procurement proposal.
</P>
<P>
A bill authorizing the arms purchase failed to be put on the
agenda for legislative review earlier this week, dashing the hopes of
the DPP to have it reviewed before the Dec. 11 legislative elections,
as the legislature is scheduled to go into a one-month recess from
Nov. 10.

DPP BLOCKS PFP-PROPOSED 'CROSS-STRAIT PEACE BILL'
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei, Nov. 5 (CNA)
(By Y.F. Low)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A "cross-strait peace promotion bill" raised
by the opposition People First Party (PFP) was blocked Friday by the
ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) , which considers the bill
impractical and superfluous.
</P>
<P>
The bill was aimed at authorizing legislators to form an
unofficial team to negotiate with mainland China on a cross-strait
peace accord and the opening of direct cross-strait shipping and air
links. It was obstructed at the first reading owing to objections
from the DPP.
</P>
<P>
Tsai Huang-liang, a leader of the DPP legislative caucus, accused
the PFP of trying to boost its chances in the Dec. 11 legislative
elections by proposing the bill even though it does not truly desire
cross-strait peace.
</P>
<P>
Tsai said the bill is impractical because it is not up to Taiwan
to decide whether to resume cross-strait dialogue that was suspended
by the mainland in the first place.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the PFP's proposal to set up a special committee in
charge of cross-strait peace talks, as stipulated in the bill, is
redundant when the Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) and semi-official
Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) are already in full operation, Tsai
said.
</P>
<P>
He said the bill would be in violation of executive powers and
the Constitution if it were to be passed into law.
</P>
<P>
Disagreeing with Tsai, PFP Legislator Lee Tung-hao said the DPP
is blocking the bill because it is insincere about restarting talks
with Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Lee claimed that the government needs to authorize the private
sector to conduct negotiations with Beijing, since the mainland
refuses to talk with either the MAC or the SEF.
</P>
<P>
Liu Wen-hsiung, another PFP legislator, said the DPP's move
proves that the peace overture offered by President Chen Shui-bian in
his second inaugural and National Day addresses was a lie.
</P>
<P>
The PFP lawmakers alleged that the DPP intends to overturn the
Constitution and provoke a war across the Taiwan Strait.

CROSS-STRAIT TIES SEEN TO AFFECT WORLD SEMICONDUCTOR INDUSTRY
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Washington,  Nov. 5 (CNA)
(By Wennie Chi and Deborah Kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The cross-Taiwan Strait situation will
affect the development of the semiconductor industry, which will in
turn impact the global economy, a U.S. business leader said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Rupert Hammond-Chambers, chairman of the U.S.-Taiwan Business
Council, said that if tension across the Taiwan Strait escalates, the
semiconductor industries in both Taiwan and mainland China will be
affected and consequently have an adverse impact on the world's
overall economy.
</P>
<P>
Almost all of the multinational telecom and high-technology big
names have come to rely on Taiwan and the mainland for electronic
components, parts and hardware, Hammond-Chambers said, adding that
this is doomed to trigger a domino effect if the cross-strait
situation worsens.
</P>
<P>
Hammond-Chambers said that he has noticed that over the past
year, the mainland has continued to build up its military capability
while refusing to renounce the option of force to address the
cross-strait differences. This is indeed a source of anxiety for
business circles, he said.
</P>
<P>
The issue will be elaborated upon further during the 2nd
semiconductor industry meeting, which will be held in San Jose,
California, Dec. 7 under the joint auspices of the U.S.-Taiwan
Business Council and the Taiwan-U.S. Business Council,
Hammond-Chambers said.

2005 OPPORTUNE TIME TO RESUME CROSS-STRAIT TALKS: EX-AIT HEAD
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Washington,  Nov. 4 (CNA)
(By Oliver Lin and Deborah Kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
2005 might be an opportune time for the
two sides of the Taiwan Strait to resume long-stalled cross-strait
dialogue, former American Institute in Taiwan (AIT) Chairman Richard
Bush said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Beijing is still adopting a "wait and see" attitude toward Taiwan
and is not expected to make any new moves prior to Taiwan's Dec. 11
legislative elections, which should see Taiwan's political landscape
reshaped somewhat, said Bush, who is currently director of the
Northeast Asian Studies Center under the Brookings Institution, a
Washington-based think-tank.
</P>
<P>
During a discussion sponsored by the institute, Bush said he sees
2005 as a golden opportunity for officials from Taiwan and mainland
China to return to the negotiating table, although, he added, it is
still up to Beijing whether it is willing to grasp the opportunity.
</P>
<P>
According to Bush, the George W. Bush administration will become
even more active and upbeat in pushing for a resumption of the cross
Taiwan Strait dialogue after the president begins his second term.
</P>
<P>
Bush said the U.S. administration has begun to probe what it
should do but has not yet done and what role the United States should
play in efforts to help readdress the political impasse across the
Taiwan Strait.
</P>
<P>
The key point now is that Beijing still lacks trust in President
Chen Shui-bian, Bush said, adding that a resumption of the
cross-strait dialogue is the only option to defuse the mutual
distrust across the strait.
</P>
<P>
He backed his theory by pointing out that the mainland did not
trust the United States before the two countries normalized their
relations but the two countries established formal diplomatic ties
eventually, after a long series of talks.
</P>
<P>
Bush also stressed that in addition to pushing for cross-strait
dialogue, the Bush administration is also expected to pay closer
attention to Taiwan's possible constitutional reforms and related
activities.

GAY PARADE SET FOR  NOV. 6

<TEXT>
<P>
Some 60 social groups representing politics,
academy, culture, the arts and entertainment are expected to join in
an alternative lifestyle parade in downtown Taipei Saturday launched
by homosexuals in the capital city, an organizer of the event said
Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Taiwan Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual and Transgender Pride Parade's
organizing committee executive secretary, Wu Hsu-niang, noted that
the planned march has also won the support of many popular singers
and TV celebrities, including Sandee Chen, who will participate in a
musical rally at the Red Theater in Hsimenting at the end of the
parade.
</P>
<P>
Although the annual march no longer enjoys the financial support
it received last year from the city government, when it drew a great
deal of attention from local and foreign media, Wu said, they will
still put on a colorful activity filled with music to project the
"happy image of the homosexual street party."
</P>
<P>
Wu said the parade will feature colorful and dazzling costumes to
show the community's rich diversity and will highlight the need for
society to respect all individuals regardless of their sexual
orientation.
</P>
<P>
A statement released by the parade organizing committee said that
as citizens of Taipei, gays and lesbians need to come out and be a
part of the city. They must also understand that they have the
responsibility to teach the next generation that there is no "wrong"
identity and that differences must be acknowledged and respected.
</P>
<P>
The march will set off from the Chiang Kai-shek Memorial Hall and
wind through the 228 Park to the Red Theater.

PREMIER URGES 'SPORTSMANSHIP' IN ELECTIONS
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Nov.  5 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Premier Yu Shyi-kun said Friday that
election results are determined by the people and not by lengthy
litigation, and that the candidates should show "sportsmanship."
</P>
<P>
The premier made the remarks in a general interpellation session
at the Legislative Yuan one day after the Taiwan High Court threw out
a lawsuit filed by the opposition "pan-blue alliance" of the
Kuomintang (KMT) and the People First Party (PFP) to contest the
result of the March 20 presidential election. Lien Chan, KMT chairman
and 2004 presidential candidate, said that he will appeal the
decision in the Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
Yu said that confrontations between the ruling and the opposition
parties have been going on for four-and-a-half years -- ever since
the 2000 presidential election -- and added that "the legislature is
crucial to a stable political situation."
</P>
<P>
Yu noted that U.S. President George W. Bush won a second term,
while his Republican Party controls over half the seats in both the
Senate and the House of Representatives, so that the U.S. politics
should be stable.
</P>
<P>
He said that the candidates in Taiwan should display
"sportsmanship" in the same way that U.S. presidential candidate John
Kerry conceded defeat even before the final results of the
contentious state of Ohio were announced, to avoid allowing the
contention to splinter the country.
</P>
<P>
The premier had earlier urged Lien to learn from Kerry and Al
Gore, another election failure, adding that even if Lien cannot
graciously concede defeat, he can at least learn from Gore's behavior
following the Florida vote dispute after the 2000 election and accept
the election result even if he strongly disagrees with the court's
verdict.

The container volume of the offshore
transshipping center of Kaohsiung Port is expected to rise 10 percent
in 2004 over last year, the Ministry of Transportation and

</P>
<P>
The volume of containers handled by the transshipping center has
increased every year since it started operations in April 1997, MOTC
officials said.
</P>
<P>
While the container volume amounted to some 127,000 twenty-foot

officials pointed out.
</P>

TAIWAN STOCKS FACING HURDLE CLOSE TO 6,000 POINTS
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Nov.  5 (CNA)
(By Flor  Wang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Political factors at home and abroad that
might influence the domestic stock market have been largely removed,
but share prices on the Taiwan Stock Exchange are still facing strong
pressure to overcome the 6,000-point mark, analysts said Friday.
</P>
<P>
With the recent re-election of U.S. President George W. Bush and
the Taiwan High Court ruling securing the validity of President Chen
Shui-bian's March 20 re-election, foreign and domestic political
uncertainties were gone, in principle giving a boost to the domestic
bourse, market watchers said.
</P>
<P>
Asian markets overall made gains Thursday on good cheer over
Bush's victory, whose administration is widely viewed as
business-friendly.
</P>
<P>
The weighted index, the key barometer of the Taiwan Stock
Exchange, was slightly down by two points a day earlier, but advanced
by 70.58 points to finish Friday at 5,931.31.
</P>
<P>
However, the analysts pointed out that international oil prices
will be the leading element affecting the domestic stock market in
the mid term and that the value of the local currency will be another
major factor influencing the domestic bourse in the short term as the
weighted index approaches the 6,000-point level.
</P>
<P>
It is worth observing whether a stronger new Taiwan dollar will
have a negative impact on high-tech shares, as its noticeable
appreciation in recent days has fueled pressure on their exports, the
analysts said, forecasting that the weighted index will hover in a
narrow range between 5,900 and 6,000 points in the short term.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the new Taiwan dollar surged by NT$0.142 to end at
33.285 against the U.S. dollar Thursday. It further gained ground
against the greenback to close at 33.075 Friday -- a six-month high
-- in anticipation of a higher mainland China's renminbi.
</P>
<P>
Foreign institutional dealers have overbought the local currency
for seven days in a row with a value of NT$43.92 billion -- a level
close to the October's total of NT$46.98 billion.
</P>
<P>
Market sources said there has been an obvious foreign capital
influx in recent days and that it seems the central bank has adopted
a hands-off policy to allow the local currency to gain in value to
ease growing inflationary pressure in the home market.
</P>
<P>
They opined that the U.S. dollar will not go up against other
major currencies despite Bush's victory, citing the long-standing
U.S. trade deficits and federal fiscal deficits.
</P>
<P>
The new Taiwan dollar had a high of 30.5 against the U.S. dollar
in 2000, leaving room for the local currency to further appreciate,
they pointed out.

PRESIDENT SAYS HE WOULD RATHER LOSE ELECTION THAN RULE OF LAW
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Nov.  5 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President Chen Shui-bian said Friday he
would rather lose a presidential election than see the nation's
interests, democratic system and rule of law principles undermined.
</P>
<P>
Chen made the remarks while meeting with a group of commissioners
of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission (OCAC) who have returned
from their countries of residence to attend an annual OCAC congress.
</P>
<P>
As the meeting came a day after the Taiwan High Court ruled
against an opposition "pan-blue alliance" lawsuit contesting the
March 20 presidential election, Chen told OCAC commissioners that he
would never pursue electoral success at the expense of national
interests and the democratic spirit.
</P>
<P>
"Elections are ephemeral, while the nation is eternal. We have
only one nation, while elections take place once every few years or
many times a year. We cannot afford to lose our country simply
because of a single election. We would rather lose an election than
lose our country. We would rather lose an election than see our
democratic system and respect for rule of law undermined," Chen said.
</P>
<P>
He hailed 2004 as a year when Taiwan has made further progress in
its democratic development.
</P>
<P>
"The 2000 presidential election ushered in Taiwan's first-ever
peaceful transition of power between different political parties.
Even though this year's presidential election result was contested,
we have managed to address it through judicial means in line with the
principles of democracy and rule of law. The pursuit of judicial
judgment has helped push forward our democratic development, " Chen
said.
</P>
<P>
Compared with advanced democratic countries, Chen went on, Taiwan
still has much to do to improve and deepen its young democracy.
</P>
<P>
Stressing that democracy and rule of law should be Taiwan's
founding spirit, Chen said his administration will continue to
upgrade the quality of Taiwan's democratic rule and boost the
development of its civic society.
</P>
<P>
Chen also promised to make every possible effort to promote
mutual respect and harmony among the various domestic ethnic groups,
as well as to craft a more modern and efficient governing framework
and constitutional system that fits Taiwan's present reality and can
contribute to its global competitiveness.
</P>
<P>
The High Court rejected a day earlier the opposition "pan-blue
alliance's" lawsuit contesting Chen's narrow re-election victory.
</P>
<P>
The ruling ended seven months of hearings, a ballot recount,
cross-debates, consultations and investigations into the various
contentious points that posed a serious challenge to one of Asia's
youngest democracies. The disputed vote was only Taiwan's third
direct presidential election.

The "pan-blue alliance's" two top leaders -- Kuomintang (KMT)
Chairman Lien Chan and People First Party Chairman (PFP) James Soong
-- who teamed up to challenge Chen and Vice President Annette Lu's
re-election bid -- have insisted that the Chen-Lu's re-election
should be nullified because of alleged ballot tampering and an
election-eve shooting of Chen and Lu that they said swayed sympathy
votes in the Chen-Lu ticket's favor.
</P>
<P>
The alliance also claimed that thousands of police and soldiers
could not vote because the president put them on special alert after
the shooting. Chen's administration has denied Lien's allegations,
and the "pan-blue alliance" has consistently failed to provide any
compelling evidence to support it's claims.

KOALA LOANED FROM AUSTRALIA EUTHANIZED
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Nov. 5 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A koala loaned to Taipei Zoo from Australia
was euthanized earlier this week, Taipei Zoo officials announced
Friday.
</P>
<P>
The marsupial, named Haley, was suspected of having developed a
tumor in his nose that was affecting his breathing and his appetite,
so zoo officials, after consulting with Australian veterinarian
Michael Pyne, decided to euthanize him Monday, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
The officials said that Pyne, who had brought two new koalas to
Taiwan Oct. 28, said that even with continued treatment, the animal
would have died in between two and four weeks, and that he should be
put out of his misery.
</P>
<P>
A specimen of the tumor was sent for analysis and the results
should come out in about 10 days. It was initially determined that
the cause of Haley's death was different from that of Action, another
koala loaned to Taipei Zoo who succumbed to lymphatic cancer in
December 2002.
</P>
<P>
Chen Pao-chung, director of Taipei Zoo, said that the zoo had
done everything possible to save Haley. The delay in announcing his
death, he explained, was because the zoo was preoccupied with the
2004 joint annual conference of the Conservation Breeding Specialist
Group and the World Association of Zoos and Aquariums running from
Oct. 29 through Nov. 4, and could not spare time to deal with the
press.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that every year, more than 200 animals die in
Taipei Zoo, but about the same number is born in the zoo, saying that
this is normal in zoos.

The investment and capital-increment
projects approved for Taiwan's export processing zones in the first
10 months have surpassed the goal set for this year, the Export
Processing Zone Administration under the Ministry of Economic Affairs

TAIWAN HAILS GERMAN PARLIAMENT'S SUPPORT FOR CHINA ARMS EMBARGO
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei, Nov. 5 (CNA)
(By Y.F. Low)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taiwan praised the German Federal Parliament
Friday for passing a resolution opposing the lifting of the European
Union's arms embargo against mainland China.
</P>
<P>
In a statement, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said the move was
in compliance with mainstream public opinion and deserves the most
positive recognition from the Taiwan government.
</P>
<P>
The ministry called the international community's attention to
the significance of the move and urged the E.U. to continue to
maintain its ban on arms sales to China.
</P>
<P>
The resolution was adopted on Oct. 28 with the support of the
ruling coalition Social Democratic Party and the Greens.
</P>
<P>
According to the resolution, the German government is urged to
press the E.U. to continue to monitor the mainland's progress on
human rights protection and resolving conflicts via peaceful means as
the criteria for whether to lift the arms embargo.
</P>
<P>
The German parliament asked the E.U. to work out binding measures
on controlling arms exports by its member nations to China.
</P>
<P>
Before lifting the embargo, the E.U. must also consider China's
progress in complying with the UN Covenant on Civil and Political
Rights, protecting human rights and private property and improving
the right to self-government of minority ethnic groups in China, the
resolution said.
</P>
<P>
Other considerations should include the non-proliferation of
weapons of mass destruction and rocket propulsion materials and
technology as well as Beijing's attitude to a peaceful resolution of
cross-Taiwan Strait disputes, it said.
</P>
<P>
The arms embargo was introduced in 1989 after a bloody crackdown
ordered by the Chinese government on a pro-democracy demonstration in
Tiananmen Square in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan has launched an international campaign opposing the E.U.'s
plan to lift the embargo on the grounds that China has targeted more
than 600 missiles against Taiwan and is continuing its military
buildup.

MOST PEOPLE WANT LIEN-SOONG TICKET TO ACCEPT COURT RULING: POLL
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Nov.  5 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A majority of people responding to an
opinion poll hope that the two top opposition "pan-blue alliance"
leaders accept the court ruling against their lawsuit to try to have
President Chen Shui-bian's re-election victory nullified, a ruling
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) legislative candidate said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Wu Ping-yu said the telephone survey of 1,080 randomly chosen
adult residents was conducted by the DPP's Justice Alliance faction
Thursday evening shortly after the Taiwan High Court announced its
dismissal of the opposition petition.
</P>
<P>
According to the survey results, 68.9 percent of those
interviewed said they think that all domestic political parties
should accept the court's decision to uphold President Chen and Vice
President Annette Lu's re-election victory; only 9.4 percent said
they don't think that the "pan-blue alliance" of the Kuomintang (KMT)
and the People First Party (PFP) should accept the ruling; and 21.8
percent said they don't know whether the opposition alliance should
accept the ruling or not.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, 55.2 percent said they do not support the Lien-Soong
ticket's decision to appeal the case to the Supreme Court; 22.4
percent gave a thumbs-up to the decision; and 22.4 percent didn't
answer the question. A cross-analysis showed that 32 percent of the
"pan-blue" supporters were opposed to the Lien-Soong plan to appeal.
</P>
<P>
The poll also found that 61 percent of the respondents were
supportive of U.S. Democratic presidential candidate John Kerry's
swift concession to his defeat in the Nov. 2 election; only 3 percent
said they didn't agree to Kerry's move; and 36 percent didn't give an
opinion.
</P>
<P>
The High Court rejected a day earlier the "pan-blue alliance's"
lawsuit contesting the Chen-Lu ticket's narrow re-election victory.
</P>
<P>
The ruling ended seven months of hearings, a ballot recount,
cross-debates, consultations and investigations into the various
contentious points that posed a serious challenge to one of Asia's
youngest democracies. The disputed vote was only Taiwan's third
direct presidential election.
</P>
<P>
The "pan-blue alliance" has insisted that the re-election should
be nullified because of alleged ballot tampering and an election-eve
shooting of Chen and Lu that they said swayed sympathy votes in the
Chen-Lu ticket's favor.
</P>
<P>
The alliance also claimed that thousands of police and soldiers
could not vote because the president put them on special alert after
the shooting. Chen's administration has denied Lien's allegations,
and the "pan-blue alliance" has consistently failed to provide any
compelling evidence to support its claims.

TAIWAN CPI GROWTH RATE MILD: DGBAS
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Nov. 5 (CNA)
(By  Flor Wang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taiwan's consumer price index (CPI) grew by
1.62 percent year-on-year for the first 10 months of this year, the
Cabinet-level Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and
Statistics (DGBAS) reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
DGBAS officials pointed to higher vegetable and meat prices in
summer after a bad season of typhoons as the main factors behind the
increase, but said that the growth is relatively mild compared to
those posted by other countries.
</P>
<P>
The world's latest information shows that during the
January-September period, the United States and mainland China
recorded a CPI growth rate of 2.5 percent and 4.1 percent. South
Korea had a growth rate of 3.7 percent, while Singapore and Japan
posted rates of 1.7 percent and negative 0.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
The CPI stood at 102.54 points for October, up by 2.36 percent
compared to the previous year's level, DGBAS statistics show.
October's core price index expanded by 0.92 percent over the
year-earlier level.
</P>
<P>
The wholesales price index (WPI) rose by an annual growth rate of
12.02 percent to 113.91 points last month -- the highest level since
April, 1981, which DGBAS official attributed to soaring prices of
oil, basic metals and chemical materials since early this year.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan's WPI increased by an average 6.97 percent for the first
10 months of the year.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the effects of an appreciating local currency,
DGBAS officials said its long- and mid-term courses are to assess,
but pointed out that its short-term impact in the export and import
sectors is obvious and imminent.
</P>
<P>
The local currency's rapid surge in value in recent days will
bring down import product prices and help dilute increased
inflationary pressure at home, they said.
</P>
<P>
The new Taiwan dollar closed Friday at a six-month high of 33.075
against the U.S. dollar, a rise of NT$0.21 over the Thursday finish,
provoking grave concerns about a hike in domestic product prices.
</P>
<P>
A weaker U.S. dollar has led the world's hot money into Asian
markets, including Taiwan, pushing up their currencies.
</P>
<P>
Transactions in the Taipei foreign exchange market broke the US$1
billion level in morning trading Friday and totaled US$1.29 billion
for the day.

2 MAINLAND WOMEN USING FAKE ROC PASSPORTS INTERCEPTED AT CKS AIRPORT

<TEXT>
<P>
Two mainland Chinese women intending to
enter the United States with bogus Republic of China passports and
aircraft boarding passes were arrested in the control area of Chiang
Kai-shek (CKS) International Airport Friday.
</P>
<P>
Both women came from the southeastern mainland province of
Fujian. They arrived at CKS Airport via a Cathay Airways flight from
Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
The two women, whose real names are Chen Yodi and Chen Fang, told
airport police that a man gave them the passports and boarding passes
after they arrived at CKS Airport. They were intercepted by aviation
police when they were going to the boarding gate for a U.S.-bound
flight.
</P>
<P>
Asked about how much they had paid for the passports and boarding
passes, the two women claimed that they had no idea because the deals
were arranged by their parents.
</P>
<P>
Aviation police said the period from Halloween to New Year has
traditionally been the peak season for illegal immigration to the
United States. Would-be illegal immigrants usually buy fake passports
of various countries with U.S. visa stamps for US$30,000 to US$60,000
each.
</P>
<P>
The two women were identified as Chang Chiu-feng and Lin Li-yueh
on the bogus ROC passports, police said, adding that the entry and
exit stamps on the "passports" were also fake and the U.S. visa
stamps were rather vague. Police said they will track down the human
smuggling ring behind the case.

Four Vietnamese women were ordered to leave
Taiwan after attempting to auction themselves off for marriage in
front of the famous Matsu Temple on the offshore island of Penghu.
Prices ranged from NT$300,000 (US$9, 000) to NT$100,000 (US$3,000).
</P>
<P>
The four entered Taiwan on tourist visas and have been ordered by
the National Police Administration (NPA) to leave within a week, a
spokesman for the NPA said Friday.
</P>
<P>
According to the NPA officer, the four women from Vietnam will be
repatriated in compliance with the Immigration Law if they don't do
so before Nov. 10.
</P>
<P>
Police authorities in the island county of Penghu already issued
the women a punishment notice for pandering, the spokesman noted,
adding that what they did here was not compatible to their visa
status and that they have seriously violated social morals.
</P>
<P>
The incident came to light after local media reported days ago
that a group of foreign women, through arrangements by local brokers,
were up for auction at the temple.
</P>
<P>
Lawmakers lashed out at the brokers' "incredible lawlessness" and
called it a huge insult to Taiwan, which has always striven for human
rights.
</P>
<P>
Legislators from various political parties and social service
associations have asked government agencies to bring the alleged
human cargo traffickers and their conspirators to justice.

FOREIGN MINISTRY DENIES US$28 MILLION GRANT TO VANUATU

<P>
A spokesman for the Ministry of Foreign
Affairs said Friday that he has heard nothing about the government
promising to give Vanuatu a grant of US$28 million as reported by a
wire service.
</P>
<P>
Michel Lu said Taiwan is talking with Vanuatu over cooperation
plans after agreeing on diplomatic ties on Wednesday, and it is too
early to say exactly how much grant money Taiwan will give the South
Pacific nation.
</P>
<P>
Lu was asked about Friday's wire service report from Port Vila,
Vanuatu, that a spokesman for Vanuatu Prime Minister Serge Vohor told
a newspaper in Port Vila that Taiwan will offer grant money of up to
US$28 million to his country next year in return for Vanuatu's
diplomatic recognition.
</P>
<P>
Quoting Serge Vohor as saying in the same wire service report
that his government would like to work with both China and Taiwan
simultaneously, Lu said Vohor didn't back down on the agreement he
entered into with Taiwan in Taipei.
</P>
<P>
As an independent state, Lu said, Vanuatu is free to choose its
friends, and China should respect Port Vila's decision to maintain
ties with both sides of the Taiwan Strait. Help should be given to
Vanuatu rather than trying to force it to chose between Beijing and
Taipei.
</P>
<P>
Noting that Vohor will discuss the diplomatic ties with Taiwan
in a Cabinet meeting next week, Lu said his ministry is sure that
Vanuatu will honor its agreement with Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
China, which considers Taiwan a renegade province, has always
asked its allies not to associate with Taiwan.

FORENSIC EXPERT'S '319 SHOOTING' REPORT POSTED ON WEB SITE
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Nov. 5 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Prosecution authorities on Friday published
Chinese-American forensic expert Dr. Henry Lee's investigative report
of the shooting of President Chen Shui-bian and Vice President
Annette Lu on the eve of the March 20 presidential election.
</P>
<P>
Both the Chinese and English versions of the 133-page report were
posted on the Web site of the State Public Prosecutor General's
Office at http: //www.tps.moj.gov.tw/ for whomever is interested in
the report to download.
</P>
<P>
Lee sent the report, completed by his forensic investigative
team, to the supreme prosecutor's office from the United States via a
diplomatic channel Aug. 30.
</P>
<P>
The supreme prosecutor's office asked the Criminal Investigation
Bureau's (CIB) forensic department to translate the English version
into Chinese. CIB forensic experts spent 10 days completing the
Chinese version. After proofreading by Chuang Chun-shan, a prosecutor
versed in English, the Chinese version was sent to Dr. Lee.
</P>
<P>
State Public Prosecutor General Wu Ying-chao said now is the
"best time" to publish the report because the 319 shooting
investigative team has completed investigations based on part of the
report which had to be kept secret before.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Wu said, the Taiwan High Court already handed down its
ruling a day earlier against the opposition "pan-blue alliance's"
petition to try to have Chen-Lu's narrow re-election victory
nullified.
</P>
<P>
"The report had been open for lawyers of the plaintiffs and the
defendants of the election lawsuit to read during the court
proceeding. With a view to letting the general public understand
facts about the shooting, we decided to publish the report," Wu said.
</P>
<P>
The report includes photos of Chen's and Lu's injuries, their
clothing, and the two bullets that were found at the crime scene. So
far, investigators have arrested no suspects, but have launched
searches of illegal weapon manufacturers in an effort to find tools
that might have been used in making the bullets.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, Lee and his team found scant evidence
that could lead investigators to identify the shooter, in part
because the scene was not secured immediately after the crime was
committed.
</P>
<P>
"Many of the shooting incident details and the exact scenarios
were not able to be reconstructed, due to the fact that the crime
scene was not fully preserved," the report said.
</P>
<P>
The report pointed out that the following issues and questions
cannot be scientifically or positively concluded -- (1) Whether the
two bullets were fired from one or two different weapons with nearly
identical barrel characteristics. (2) The exact muzzle velocity of
each shot. (3) The impact velocity and impact energy of each shot.
(4) The energy created by or associated with each shot. (5) Degree of
damage created by each shot. (6) The exact ejection pattern of each
of the casings.
</P>
<P>
Lee also concluded that two shots were fired at the two
candidates within one second. But because no weapons were recovered,
it was impossible to say "whether the two bullets were fired from one
or two different weapons with nearly identical barrel
characteristics," the report said, adding that if a weapon was found
in the future, markings found on the bullets could help identify
whether it was used in the shooting.
</P>
<P>
The "pan-blue alliance's" presidential candidate, Kuomintang
Chairman Lien Chan, claimed that the presidential vote was marred by
fraud and unfairly influenced by the election-eve shooting. Lien even
insinuated that the shooting was staged by Chen's camp to sway
sympathy votes in his favor. However, the court ruled that Lien's
claims were not sufficient grounds to nullify Chen-Lu's re-election.
Lien and his running mate, James Soong, have vowed to appeal the case
to the Supreme Court.

VOTE ALLOCATION STRATEGY WOULD BE DIFFICULT FOR 'PAN-BLUE': WANG
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Nov.  6 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It would be difficult for the "pan-blue
alliance" of the Kuomintang (KMT) , People First Party (PFP) and New
Party to employ the vote allocation strategy in the year-end
legislative elections, Legislative Yuan President Wang Jin-pyng said
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Wang, who doubles as KMT vice chairman, told journalists that the
strategy would be difficult to execute for the KMT as the party's
candidates attract supporters through personal charisma.
</P>
<P>
"Even if the candidates agree among themselves to evenly divide
their support, their supporters won't necessary listen by shifting
their support from one candidate to another," Wang said.
</P>
<P>
Another problem, Wang said, is that none of the three "pan-blue
alliance" parties are sure that the support they command among them
in a particular constituent is sufficient to ensure the election of
all the "pan-blue" candidates, and dividing their support would only
result in failure for all of them.
</P>
<P>
The case is especially true in southern Taiwan where the
candidates canvass votes through their personal relations rather than
their party affiliation, Wang said.
</P>
<P>
Wang said the best thing that the "pan-blue" candidates can do is
campaign together, adding that the KMT would not grudge helping
"pan-blue" candidates who are not certain of victory but have a
chance.

<P>
People First Party (PFP) Chairman James
Soong reiterated his party's opposition to the government's arms
purchase plan Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Opening the campaign headquarters for a PFP legislative candidate
in Taipei, Soong said his party won't back off from its opposition to
the arms purchase plan because the US$18.23 billion price asked for
by the United States is "exorbitant".
</P>
<P>
Noting that President Chen Shui-bian is leading the country on a
collision course with mainland China by pressing for a new
constitution and a new country, Soong said Chen's policy will bring
disaster to the country.
</P>
<P>
He urged the public to avoid the disaster by voting for the
"pan-blue alliance, " which groups the Kuomintang and PFP, in the
year-end legislative elections because of the peace policy it
advocates.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) Legislator Tsai
Huang-liang called on the public Saturday to punish Soong and his
party for their stance on the arms purchase plan by denying them
support in the elections, arguing that their opposition to the arms
purchase will jeopardize the nation's security.
</P>
<P>
Tsai, who is the DPP whip at the Legislative Yuan, vowed to
continue his party's efforts to push the arms purchase plan through
the legislature as soon as possible.

Taiwan must be watchful of the possibility
of mainland China resorting to nationalism to try to distract
domestic attention from ongoing social disorder, Mainland Affairs
Council Chairman Joseph Wu warned Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Wu was referring to a Washington Post report which said the
Beijing leadership has felt the challenge to the rule of the Chinese
Communist Party after more than 58,000 public demonstrations occurred
on the mainland last year.
</P>
<P>
Wu said Taiwan must not consider the problem as a purely domestic
affair of mainland China.
</P>
<P>
In the face of domestic instability, mainland authorities are
likely to resort to nationalism to try to strengthen unity within the
country and distract the people's attention from the problem,
according to Wu.

He warned that this situation could mean disaster for Taiwan.

<TEXT>
<P>
The "Challenge 2008" Six-Year National
Development Plan is aimed at strengthening Taiwan's competitive edge
to counter Beijing's suppression against Taiwan in the international
community, Premier Yu Shyi-kun said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Yu made the remarks at a symposium sponsored by the Cabinet-level
Council for Economic Planning and Development (CEPD) at the National
Museum of Natural Science in central Taichung City to explain to the
public the achievements so far under the government's drive to
promote the national development plan.
</P>
<P>
Stressing that the plan is designed to make Taiwan stronger and
to further reach out to the world amid Beijing's all-dimension
blockade, Yu said that if Taiwan were to do nothing, it would become
an outcast in the international community by the time of the 2008
Beijing Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
According to the premier, the six-year national development plan
has seven targets, and some of the aims have already been met since
it was launched two years ago. He added that he is confident that
more of the targets will be reached ahead of schedule.
</P>
<P>
The main goals contained in the plan are cultivating talent for
the e-generation, developing the cultural creativity industry,
developing an industrial base for research and innovation, increasing
value-added production, doubling the number of tourist arrivals,
building a digital Taiwan, making Taiwan an operations center,
improving transportation infrastructure, conserving the ecology and
water resources, and constructing new hometown communities.
</P>
<P>
The government hopes to create at least 700,000 job
opportunities, maintain an annual economic growth rate of more than 5
percent, lower the jobless rate to below 4 percent, and boast over 6
million broadband subscribers, he added.
</P>
<P>
Taichung County Magistrate Huang Chung-sheng and Changhua County
Magistrate Wong Chin-chu, who were also present on the occasion, gave
the thumbs-up to the boost provided by the plan to local development
and promised to fully cooperate with the central government in the
drive.

REPORTED US$28 M. GRANT TO VANUATU AN 'IMAGINARY' FIGURE: MOFA
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Nov.  6 (CNA)

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An official of the Ministry of Foreign
Affairs (MOFA) said Saturday that reports about Taiwan offering a
grant of US$28 million to Vanuatu is an "imaginary" figure.
</P>
<P>
Vice Foreign Affairs Minister Kau Ying-mao made the remarks one
day after a wire service report from Port-Vila, Vanuatu quoted a
spokesman for Vanuatuan Prime Minister Serge Vohor as saying that
Taiwan will offer grant money of up to US$28 million to his country
next year in return for Vanuatu's diplomatic recognition.
</P>
<P>
Vohor and Republic of China Foreign Affairs Minister Tan Sun Chen
jointly signed a communique on the establishment of formal diplomatic
relations in Taipei Wednesday on behalf of their respective countries.
</P>
<P>
The South Pacific island nation became the 27th diplomatic ally
of the ROC.
</P>
<P>
Kau noted that the ROC does provide economic assistance to its
allies and that the ROC and Vanuatu have reached an understanding on
such assistance, although the amount will be worked out later by the
two governments.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan will have to assess the cooperation projects formally
proposed by Vanuatu before it decides on the actual amount of such
assistance, Kau said.
</P>
<P>
On the Vanuatuan spokesman's remarks that there will be a NT$28
million grant, Kau said that this is an "imaginary" figure,
reiterating that the amount has not yet been finalized.
</P>
<P>
He noted that Vohor had returned to his country and called a
press conference to announce the establishment of diplomatic
relations with the ROC.
</P>
<P>
Although there are different views within the Vanuatuan
government, Kau said that this is normal in democratic countries and
that there is nothing to worry about.
</P>
<P>
Vohor will hold a Cabinet meeting next Monday to discuss the
issue of establishing diplomatic relations with the ROC, and he will
be able to resolve the differences within his government then, Kau
said.

YU HOPES FOR RATIONAL DEBATE IN LEGISLATURE ON ARMS PURCHASE PLAN
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Nov. 6 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Premier Yu Shyi-kun said Saturday that the
Legislative Yuan should have a rational debate on the major arms
procurement plan from the United States.
</P>
<P>
He was referring to the Executive Yuan proposed special budget of
NT$610.8 to buy six batteries of Patriot-III missiles, eight
diesel-fueled submarines and a squadron of 12 anti-submarine
aircraft.
</P>
<P>
The premier said that if the opposition parties support the plan
but have different views on the price and items of the procurement,
they can debate them in the legislature, instead of trying to block
the plan through procedural matters.
</P>
<P>
Yu also said that a rational debate on the plan has been blocked
from taking place because the ruling Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) does not control a majority in the 225-seat legislature, adding
that if the party can win enough seats in the Dec. 11 elections, then
holding a debate on the plan won't be a problem.
</P>
<P>
A bill authorizing the arms purchase plan failed to be put on the
agenda for legislative review earlier this week, dealing a heavy blow
to the DPP's hope to have it reviewed before the month-long recess
that begins Nov. 10 ahead of the legislative elections.
</P>
<P>
Stressing the need for the arms purchase to defend national
security, Yu said he's worried that if Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang
Jin-pyng won't coordinate a Procedure Committee meeting in the
legislature, there won't be a chance for a rational debate on the
arms purchase plan ahead of the elections.

RUSSIAN UNIVERSITY PRESIDENT HONORED

<DATELINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Chang Tsung-jen, president of National Sun
Yat-sen University in Kaohsiung, southern Taiwan, on Saturday
bestowed ahonorary doctoral degree on Gennady P. Turmov, president of
Far Eastern State Technical University in Vladivostok, Russia.
</P>
<P>
Chang said that Turmov, a world-renowned shipbuilding expert,
enjoys a high position in Russian academic circles and has so far
published more than 400 articles in periodicals and authored 32
books.
</P>
<P>
Both schools will now actively make plans on bilateral exchanges,
Chang said.
</P>
<P>
Turmov said that his university will send a research ship to the
Bashi Channel near Taiwan next January to try to salvage a ship that
was sunk during the First World War. After the salvage operations,
the research vessel will moor at Kaohsiung and then visit National
Sun Yat-sen University and provide valuable research information to
the school to be used for future bilateral cooperation and exchanges.
</P>
<P>
Chang recalled that he signed an exchange agreement with Far
Eastern State Technical University during his visit to Vladivostok in
late July. He said that his school would invite professors from Far
Eastern State Technical University to conduct research projects next
summer, covering such fields as undersea technology, nanotechnology
and biotechnology.
</P>
<P>
Both schools will also begin a student exchange program, although
Chang admitted that students at National Sun Yat-sen University are
not familiar with Russian at present. Far Eastern State Technical
University has a department of oriental languages and literature.
</P>
<P>
National Sun Yat-sen University will also work with the Ministry
of Education's plan to recruit foreign students and recruit students
from the Vladivostok school so as to enhance bilateral cooperation.

RAPID GAIN IN VALUE OF LOCAL CURRENCY MAY INVITE CBC INTERVENTION
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Nov. 6 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The local currency's rapid appreciation in
recent days may invite intervention by the central bank at an
appropriate time when the influx of foreign capital has eased, market
analysts said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Foreign exchange experts predicted that the U.S. dollar will
continue depreciating against the world's major currencies due to the
United States' huge trade and federal fiscal deficits.
</P>
<P>
With mainland China's interest rate hikes early this week and the
re-election of U.S. President George W. Bush, the experts contended
that global hot money will continue entering Asian markets, including
Taiwan, on speculation of a stronger renminbi.
</P>
<P>
Although Taiwan's Central Bank of China (CBC) seems to have taken
a hands-off approach despite the recent gain in value of the new
Taiwan dollar against the greenback, market watchers claimed that the
CBC is very likely to intervene when the inflow of foreign capital
slows.
</P>
<P>
They said that the CBC has not done so to ease growing
inflationary pressure in the domestic market, despite the fact that
the local currency shows upward trends in the mid term and long term.
</P>
<P>
The new Taiwan dollar ended Friday at a six-month high of
NT$33.075 against the U.S. dollar, up by NT$0.21 over Thursday's
finish. Some dealers forecast that the local unit may break the 33
level against the greenback in the coming days.
</P>
<P>
Hu Sheng-cheng, chairman of the Cabinet-level Council for
Economic Planning and Development (CEPD), said a day earlier that an
appreciating local currency will help reduce imported oil costs and
dilute inflation.
</P>
<P>
Although a stronger new Taiwan dollar may affect the export
sector, Hu said its short-term impact on Taiwan businesses should be
limited as recent fluctuations are temporary.
</P>
<P>
According to the CEPD head, the local currency has come under
fierce pressure to appreciate because the country holds the world's
third-largest foreign exchange reserves, worth US$235.032 billion as
of the end of October.
</P>
<P>
Giving free rein to market forces to decide the value of the
local currency is much better to lure hot money to take advantage of
currency exchange rates, he pointed out.

<P>
More than 10 percent of college students in
southern Taiwan have attempted suicide over the past year, while some
nine percent of elementary students in Tainan have tried to harm
themselves during that period, according to a survey released
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The survey was conducted by Ke Hui-cheng, a professor at National
Cheng Kung University's Institute of Behavioral Medicine, on 346
third- and fourth-graders at two elementary schools in Tainan,
southern Taiwan, and on 3,488 college students in southern Taiwan.

Among the elementary students surveyed, 8.9 percent said they had
tried to harm themselves during the past year, with the most common
methods cited being scratching, hitting, or refraining from eating. A
total of 269 valid samples were collected among the elementary
students.

<P>
Meanwhile, 10.5 percent of the college students surveyed said
they had attempted to take their own lives over the past year, with
taking pills, burning charcoal, exposure to carbon monoxide, and
jumping from a tall building being the most mentioned methods.

TAIWAN GROUP LOBBIES AGAINST LIFTING OF EU ARMS EMBARGO AGAINST CHINA
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Nov.  6 (CNA)
(By Y.F. Low)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Members of the pro-independence Taiwan
Association of University Professors (TAUP) said Saturday that they
will submit a formal petition to the European Union against proposals
to lift its ban on arms sales to mainland China.
</P>
<P>
The TAUP will also join forces with European non-governmental
organizations to lobby members of the European Parliament to support
Taiwan's petition, according to TAUP Secretary-General Hsiao Chih-ju.
</P>
<P>
Hsiao said a lifting of the arms embargo on China would undermine
the military balance in Asia and trigger an arms race, a situation
which he said would be unfavorable to the European Union.
</P>
<P>
He said the TAUP has recently had the opportunity to meet with a
group of European Parliament members to pass on the message to them
during their visit in Taiwan, and that the European politicians have
responded positively to Taiwan's cause.
</P>
<P>
The government of Taiwan has also launched an international
campaign to lobby the European Union to maintain its arms embargo on
the grounds that mainland China has deployed more than 600 missiles
targeting Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
In what has been hailed by Taiwan as an inspiring move, the
German Federal Parliament passed a resolution on Oct. 28 to express
its opposition to a lifting of the ban.

VICE PRESIDENT HOPES FOR PEACE ACROSS TAIWAN STRAIT

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Vice President Annette Lu expressed the hope
that "peace will replace war" across the Taiwan Strait, during a
visit to the outlying island of Matsu on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Presiding over the opening ceremony for a war museum at a peace
memorial park in Matsu, Lu said the park is very meaningful to Matsu,
which was always on the frontline during the old days of military
confrontation between Taiwan and mainland China.
</P>
<P>
The park also symbolizes the replacement of war with peace for
the residents of Matsu and Kinmen, who had not been able to enjoy
democracy until later years owing to military control measures
enforced there, Lu said.
</P>
<P>
Lu promised the government will continue to fund development
projects in Matsu, even though the ruling Democratic Progressive
Party (DPP) only obtained slightly more than 200 votes in Matsu in
the March 20 presidential election.
</P>
<P>
The memorial park, which is still under construction, is expected
to cost NT$100 million (US$3.01 million) . The museum is the first
phase of the project.
</P>
<P>
Also during the trip, Lu checked out the tourism industry in
Matsu and participated in the opening of the campaign headquarters of
DPP legislative candidate Lin Huo-meng.

POLICY OF OPENING TO M'LAND TOURISTS REMAINS UNCHANGED: MAC

<TEXT>
<P>
The government's policy of opening up to
mainland Chinese tourists will remain unchanged despite individual
cases of mainland tourists absconding upon arriving in Taiwan, the
nation's top mainland China policy charter said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Joseph Wu, chairman of the Mainland Affairs Council, made the
remarks when he attended the annual conference of the Overseas
Chinese Affairs Commission.
</P>
<P>
He said that the issue of absconding mainland Chinese tourists
has become a nagging problem for many countries around the world as
it poses a potential threat to social order and national security.
</P>
<P>
Although the ratio of mainland Chinese tourists absconding in
Taiwan is relatively lower among countries around the world, the
government has not taken the problem lightly, he said.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that at the present stage, the government will
strengthen the security management mechanism, including screening
tourists before they board planes and checking on customs, in the
hopes of establishing a comprehensive management network.
</P>
<P>
Related agencies could also carry out regular reviews if the
management measures are carried out rigorously, he added.
</P>
<P>
Wu said that the opening policy will continue in order to allow
mainland tourists the opportunity to appreciate the beautiful scenery
of Taiwan as well as taste the democratic and free atmosphere on the
island.

TAIWAN PEOPLE LIKE TO RUN OWN BUSINESSES: FAIR TRADE COMMISSION
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Nov. 6 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
People in Taiwan are fond of running their
own businesses as evidenced by the fact that the number of shops of
the country's top 10 convenience store chains grew to 7,539 as of the
end of last year, according to recent tallies published by the Fair
Trade Commission.
</P>
<P>
The figure represents an increase of 9.06 percent as compared to
the level at the end of the previous year, the commission statistics
showed.
</P>
<P>
Of the more than 7,500 convenience stores across the country,
1,378 were directly run by their headquarters, while the remaining
6,161 were chain shops managed by individuals, or 81.72 percent of
the total. The ratio of the franchised stores rose from 26.41 percent
of the total in 2002 to 31.56 percent in 2003.
</P>
<P>
Commission officials attributed the increasing ratio of franchise
shops in convenience store chains to the propensity of the Taiwan
people for running their own businesses. Opening a franchised
convenience shop is an easier and less risky way for many local
people hoping to own a business.

The DPP is appealing to voters to support the party in its bid to
obtain a majority in the 225-seat Legislative Yuan to facilitate the
implementation of President Chen Shui-bian's policies.

The "pan-blue alliance," on the other hand, is claiming that the
opposition must continue to have control over the legislature to
prevent the country from becoming a "one-party dictatorship."
</P>
<P>
A total of 387 candidates have officially registered to run in
the elections. The 225 seats up for grabs will include 168 regional

<P>
Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) Chairman
Joseph Wu warned Saturday that Beijing is increasingly prone to use
military force against Taiwan and called for the public to strengthen
its determination to deter any attacks from mainland China.
</P>
<P>
The MAC head made the remarks while giving a keynote speech on
cross-Taiwan Strait ties at the 2004 annual conference of the
Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission.
</P>
<P>
Pointing out that the mainland regime is more and more likely to
resort to military means to achieve what it calls a cross-strait
unification with Taiwan, Wu urged the Taiwan people to strengthen
their determination and to build a capable self-defense force in case
of war.
</P>
<P>
Mainland China's many military exercises in recent years have
been principally aimed at Taiwan, and their increased scale each year
is due to mainland authorities taking possible intervention by
foreign countries into consideration, Wu analyzed.
</P>
<P>
He urged the Taiwan people never to underestimate the possibility
of a mainland attack and warned against a devastating catastrophe
should the Taiwan people fail to make full preparations.
</P>
<P>
In the face of a highly risky situation in the strait, Taiwan
must do its best to promote security dialogue and cooperation with
countries in East Asia, he said, stressing that support from the
United States and Japan is particularly important to Taiwan.

TNUA POISED TO BECOME TAIWAN'S ANIMATION ART CRADLE
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Nov.  7 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Tainan National University of the Arts
(TNUA) is poised to become the cradle of Taiwan's animation industry
with its well-established academic background and expanding plans and
ambition to achieve that goal.
</P>
<P>
TNUA is running Taiwan's first graduate institute of animation,
nurturing skilled talent in animation art and industry every year,
and it is also bolstering cooperation with international groups and
foreign institutes in related industries and research, according to
TNUA President Huang Pi-twan.
</P>
<P>
One of Taiwan's two "digital design resources centers, " TNUA has
been invited by the world renowned New Zealand film production
company Oktobor, which produced cinema hits such as Lord of the Rings
and Matrix, to join its production team for a new animated movie
titled The Legend of the White Snake, said Huang.
</P>
<P>
Huang made the remarks during an exclusive interview with CNA
marking the eighth anniversary of the university's establishment.
TNUA, located in Kuantian rural township in the southern county of
Tainan, was known as Tainan National College of the Arts
until August of this year, when it was formally upgraded into a
university.
</P>
<P>
TNUA has made the most of the limited NT$7 million (US$210,843)
annual budget that the central government has allocated to the
university for the development of digital design since 2003, to
optimize related activities, including organizing two international
forums on audio, video and digital arts, Huang noted.
</P>
<P>
Academics and digital designers who came to Taiwan for the second
forum, which wrapped up on the TNUA campus last week, included
production team members from Oktobor; scholars and lecturers from the
Institute of Fine Arts under Australia's University of New South
Wales, which has sisterhood ties with TNUA; and a professor from the
University of Tokyo, Japan, which in recent years has emphasized
animation and digital design.
</P>
<P>
According to Huang, the TNUA Institute of Animation has
cooperated with world-renowned lecturers and experts in writing and
translating a series of books on the science and art of animation.
So far, the second of its kind has just been published.
</P>
<P>
The institute also runs its own animation design, production and
development group, receiving orders for productions and entering
cooperation with international agencies such as Oktobor, Huang added.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Huang said, TNUA is also planning to exploit a
government program to send elite students abroad for advanced study,
in the hope that the university will be able to allow several dozen
students every year to study at top-notch universities and research
institutes from 2005.
</P>
<P>
Under the government program, students can receive government
scholarships of US$30,000 per year and those studying humanities or
social sciences can receive scholarships for three years.
</P>
<P>
The program is aimed at nurturing talent to meet expected demand
between 2010 and 2015 in national development, including industrial
and cultural development, according to the Ministry of Education.

BEIJING'S DIPLOMATIC OFFENSIVE INCREASINGLY HEINOUS: FM
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Washington,  Nov. 6 (CNA)

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mainland China's diplomatic suppression
of Taiwan has become increasingly disgraceful and outrageous,
Minister of Foreign Affairs Tan Sun Chen said Saturday in an online
speech broadcast at a Thanksgiving Day party in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
Chen said he could only address the annual Thanksgiving Day
dinner of the Taiwanese Association in the U.S. capital via the
Internet rather than in person due to Beijing's diplomatic embargo
against Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
"Although Taiwan is a sovereign state, its high-ranking
government officials are barred from visiting the U.S. capital
because of Beijing's diplomatic stranglehold, " lamented Chen, who
once headed a large Taiwanese association in the United States.
</P>
<P>
Chen further said President Chen Shui-bian has offered many
policy initiatives and has repeatedly extended olive branches to the
mainland in recent months in an effort to safeguard peace and
stability in the Taiwan Strait.
</P>
<P>
"Cross-strait peace is a common expectation of the people on both
sides of the Taiwan Strait and even the entire world. However,
Beijing has so far not given any positive response or offered any
constructive overtures. It has instead intensified its diplomatic
suppression of Taiwan and its repressive tactics have become
increasingly heinous and flagrant," he added.
</P>
<P>
Chen went to the United States to pursue a doctorate in physics.
Due to his pro-Taiwan independence stance, he was barred from
returning to Taiwan until the early 1990s, when Taiwan's democratic
reforms shifted into high gear.
</P>
<P>
With the concerted efforts of Taiwan people at home and abroad,
Chen said Taiwan is now a liberal democracy. He encouraged all
Taiwanese expatriates and Taiwanese-Americans to cooperate closely to
enhance their political influence and lobby the U.S.
government and Congress to support Taiwan's cause.
</P>
<P>
"With perseverance and devotion, I believe we'll succeed in
upgrading Taiwan's international profile and expanding its diplomatic
frontiers in the future," he added.
</P>
<P>
In addition to Taiwanese Association members, Republic of China
Representative to the United States David Ta-wei Lee, former American
Institute in Taiwan Chairman Nat Bellocchi and many other American
friends also attended the Thanksgiving Day party.

TAIWAN SHOULD BE INCLUDED IN INTERNATIONAL HEALTH REGULATIONS
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Geneva,  Nov.  7 (CNA)
(By C.H. Lu and P.C. Tang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taiwan's bid to join the international
health community has once again gained firm support from its
diplomatic allies and the United States, according to a well-place
health source in Geneva.
</P>
<P>
The country has failed to become an observer of the World Health
Assembly (WHA) , the decision-making arm of the World Health
Organization (WHO), despite years of efforts.
</P>
<P>
The WHO member states are engaged in a two-week session of inter-
governmental working group meetings that began Nov. 1 on revisions of
the organization's International Health Regulations (IHR) , with the
goal of bringing the regulations up to date and increasing controls
on the international spread of infectious disease.
</P>
<P>
The source said that both Taiwan's allies and the United States
"implied" during the first few days of meetings that Taiwan should be
allowed to join the international health community as well as being
included in the IHR after the revisions of the regulations.
</P>
<P>
Although no WTO members touched directly on the Taiwan issue
during the meetings, Nicaragua delegates proposed revising the
current IHR articles related to the participation of non-members of
the WHO in the regulations, saying that the articles should include
those territories that have the ability to push for external health
relations and to execute IHR affairs as other WHO members.
</P>
<P>
The proposal was supported by several Taiwan diplomatic allies,
including Malawi, Sao Tome and Principe, Chad, Senegal, Haiti and
Paraguay, the source said, adding that D.E. Hohman, deputy chief
delegate of the U.S. delegation to the meetings, also voiced his
support for the principle of universality, noting that the IHR's goal
is to make the regulations suitable for use by all countries around
the world.
</P>
<P>
Hohman also said that disease knows no boundaries and that in
order to avoid global public health crises, the IHR should not be
allowed to have any loopholes.
</P>
<P>
Washington has always said that the IHR should include Taiwan and
it said during a WHA meeting held in Geneva in May that the world
health body should include the nation in the IHR during its revision
proceedings.
</P>
<P>
However, the source said, mainland China's delegates to the
meetings strongly opposed Nicaragua's proposal, pointing out that the
territory's concept does not have legal status since the WHO is an
intergovernmental organization and IHR is a convention among nations.
</P>
<P>
According to Beijing's representatives, the current IHR, which
entered into force in 1969, needs no revisions because the relevant
articles mentioned by the proposal have not caused any problems.
</P>
<P>
Seventeen WHO members, including seven of Taiwan's diplomatic
allies -- Costa Rica, Dominican Republic, Burkina Faso, Kiribati,
Honduras, Swaziland, and Belize -- and three of Beijing's supporters
-- Congo, Bangladesh and Iran -- have registered to speak at the
coming meetings. Japan and the Netherlands will also express their
views during the meetings.
</P>
<P>
Health experts in Geneva have said that although a beneficial IHR
revision for Taiwan does not necessarily mean that the country will
be allowed to join the WHO, it will certainly be a breakthrough for
Taiwan in its efforts to join the organization.
</P>
<P>
Pointing out that Beijing will make all-out efforts to obstruct
Taiwan during the coming IHR meetings, the experts also said that any
changes in the relevant IHR articles will benefit Taiwan. They added
that the WHO's leading members have realized Taiwan's importance to
the international health security network and that there is room for
the nation to develop in the world health community.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the source said that Taiwan's Department of Health has
also put forth some proposals on the IHR revisions and has expressed
its wish to participate in the IHR revision working group meetings.

RICH UNDERSEA DEPOSITS OF 'FLAMMABLE ICE' SOUTHWEST OF TAIWAN
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Nov. 7 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Gas hydrate, commonly known as "flammable
ice, " which could be used as an energy source at a time of
widespread price wars over fossil fuels that could run out someday,
is said to be present in rich deposits under the sea to Taiwan's
southwest.
</P>
<P>
After preliminary surveys, the Central Geological Survey (CGS)
under the Ministry of Economic Affairs, said Sunday that there are
probably huge deposits of gas hydrate under the sea bed to Taiwan's
southwest.
</P>
<P>
So long as Taiwan or any other country is technically capable of
exploring the gas hydrate deposits, the "dormant energy" will
probably become a key to solving the earth's energy problems,
according to CGS officials.
</P>
<P>
Gas hydrate is formed of water and methane under high pressure
and low temperatures. It is called "combustible ice" because it looks
like ice crystals. It is also called methane hydrate because it
releases methane gas when it is put under normal pressure at normal
temperatures. When ignited, it burns continuously, earning itself the
nickname of "combustible ice," CGS experts said.
</P>
<P>
Gas hydrate is generally known to be in great deposits mainly
under the northern and southern polar icecaps, as well as under deep
sea beside coastlines.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that globally, deposits of gas hydrate are about
20,000 trillion cubic meters, containing about 10 trillion tons of
organic carbon, which represents an amount equivalent to two-fold the
entire deposits of organic carbon currently known to the world, CGS
experts said.
</P>
<P>
Gas hydrate could be an important energy resource in the 21st
century and could replace fossil fuels as major economic powers,
including the United States, Japan, Canada and the European Union,
even mainland China and India, have established national-level
projects on the issue.
</P>
<P>
According to CGS Director Lin Chao-tsung, his agency has
conducted preliminary surveys over the past several months, checking
the sea bed about 100 km from Taiwan proper's southwest coast to a
depth of 500-3,500 meters. The survey team found that methane hydrate
was found in high density in that area, prompting the team to
calculate that hundreds of millions cubic meters of methane are
deposited in a hydrate form in the area.
</P>
<P>
If the deposits can be explored and used, it would be enough to
provide Taiwan's entire energy consumption requirements for 50 years,
Lin said.
</P>
<P>
The CGS plans to choose two locations in the area to begin
geological prospecting from 2007 to determine the exact position of
the gas hydrate deposits, the types of deposits and the approaches
that the agency should use to explore the potential fuel source.
</P>
<P>
The other countries involved in exploring the possibility of gas
hydrate extraction have scheduled 2015 as the year to begin
commercial exploitation and the schedule could be moved ahead if
prices for fossil fuels continue to skyrocket, Lin said.
</P>
<P>
Lin stressed, however, that so far, none of these countries have
made any breakthroughs to surmount technical difficulties in gas
hydrate exploration and use.
</P>
<P>
The most difficult or challenging problem about gas hydrate is
that "it cannot be extracted, " Lin said, adding that once the
material is unearthed, at normal temperatures and normal pressure, it
immediately turns to water and methane and is useless.
</P>
<P>
The only useful option would be for the scientists operate
undersea, turning the "combustible ice" into gas in a process
undertaken under the sea bed and pipelining the transformed gas to
the surface, Lin explained.
</P>
<P>
If operated inappropriately, the gas hydrate may release huge
amounts of methane, resulting in a sudden surge in the temperature of
sea water, which could cause a major disaster for global ecology, Lin
added.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the issue is an issue for the entire global village
to tackle, Lin said that he is confident that scientists will
overcome technical difficulties eventually to "crack the treasure
box" lying deep below the sea.

HISTORY TO DOCUMENT 'LIEN-SOONG REBELLION:' PREMIER
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Nov.  7 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Premier Yu Shyi-kun lashed out at two top
opposition leaders -- Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Lien Chan and People
First Party (PFP) Chairman James Soong -- Sunday for their refusal to
concede defeat in the March 20 presidential election, saying that
history will document their post-election deeds as a "Lien-Soong
rebellion."
</P>
<P>
In an unusually combative mood while stumping for Legislator Wang
To of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party, who is seeking
re-election, Yu said Lien should have conceded defeat gracefully when
the Taiwan High Court ruled against his election lawsuit Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"Lien missed a good opportunity to concede defeat and offer his
congratulations to President Chen Shui-bian after the court dismissed
his petition to have the presidential election result nullified and
instead upheld Chen's re-election victory three days ago. This
indicates that Lien lacks political wisdom," Yu said.
</P>
<P>
Instead of conceding defeat, Yu went on, Lien mobilized a large
crowd of supporters to stage sometimes violent protests in front of
the Presidential Office for seven days shortly after the election
result was announced. Lien and his running mate Soong then filed two
lawsuits demanding the annulment of Chen's re-election victory and
even invalidation of the entire election on the claims that the vote
was marred by fraud and a shooting that slightly injured Chen a day
before his victory by a razor-thin margin.
</P>
<P>
Local society has been disturbed by the defiant posturing of Lien
and Soong over the past seven-odd months, Yu said, adding that Lien
and Soong do not trust the government, the Central Election
Commission, or the hundreds of thousands of schoolteachers who
assisted in handling the voting affairs.
</P>
<P>
"The court ruling ended the grueling series of hearings, ballot
recounting, cross-debates, consultations and investigations into
various contentious points that posed a serious challenge to our
society. However, Lien still refused to concede defeat even after
losing the suit. He has so far not made a public apology to election
staff and schoolteachers," Yu lamented.
</P>
<P>
The premier said he believes that history will document the "dark
period" in the wake of the presidential election.
</P>
<P>
"Even if textbooks for elementary schoolchildren may not include
Lien-Soong's defiant acts, I'm convinced that political science
students at universities will definitely touch on the event and
characterize it as the 'Lien-Soong rebellion,'" Yu added.

<TEXT>
<P>
Defense Minister Lee Jye made an
inspection tour Sunday of an ammunition depot in the southern Taiwan
county of Kaohsiung where an explosion killed three soldiers a day
earlier.
</P>
<P>
Lee also paid visits to the families of the three soldiers -- 2nd
Lt. Hung Tuan-lung, Sgt. Huang Chien-che and PFC Yang Wu-chang -- to
offer apologies and condolences.
</P>
<P>
In addition to ordering an immediate investigation into the cause
of the explosion, Lee further suggested that a memorial be erected at
the site to serve as a reminder for all military service members at
the depot to raise vigilance during their work.
</P>
<P>
Family members of the three soldiers complained that they did not
receive notice of the tragic accident until 4 p.m. Saturday, more
than an hour after the explosion at 2: 50 p.m. They asked military
authorities to probe the case thoroughly so that their loved ones
will not have died in vain.
</P>
<P>
Lee said he was briefed on the accident and that ammunition
experts from the military-run Chungshan Institute of Science and
Technology will conduct a forensic investigation to determine the
cause of the explosion. "The military will complete the investigation
of the possible cause as soon as possible, " he told grieving family
members.
</P>
<P>
Lee was accompanied by Chief of the General Staff Gen. Lee
Tien-yu and Gen. Tai Po-teh on the inspection tour.
</P>
<P>
According to initial investigation, Tai said, the explosion might
have occurred when the trio were moving mortar shells. "They might
have accidentally hit a shell against a wall, causing it to explode, "
he said.
</P>
<P>
The depot is located in a remote mountainous region between
Kaohsiung County's Kouping village and Chishan township. As the depot
covers a large area and is far from civilian houses, the explosion
did not affect residents in the region. Huang and Yang were killed
instantly, while Hung died en route to a hospital.

<P>
A senior member of the Presidential Office
staff urged opposition People First Party (PFP) Chairman James Soong
Sunday to stop using imaginary war scenarios to frighten people for
the sake of his partisan political interests.
</P>
<P>
Su Tseng-chang, President Chen Shui-bian's chief of staff, made
the appeal after Soong said while stumping for a PFP legislative
candidate in Taipei County earlier in the day that if the "pan-green
camp" of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) and the Taiwan
Solidarity Union (TSU) wins a clear majority in the new Legislative
Yuan to be elected Dec. 11, Taiwan could face the threat of an attack
from mainland China next year.
</P>
<P>
Soong said legend has it that definitive events happen once every
60 years. For instance, the United States was attacked by Japan in
1942 and then suffered terrorist attacks 60 years later in 2002.
</P>
<P>
Soong said 2005 will mark the 60th anniversary of Taiwan's return
to China in 1945 after 50 years of Japanese colonial rule. If the
"pan-green camp" wins a big victory in the year-end legislative
elections, Soong said, Taiwan could face a "war threat."
</P>
<P>
Commenting on Soong's remarks, Su said Soong should refrain from
using superstitious rhetoric designed to cause panic among the
citizenry.
</P>
<P>
"I cannot understand what Soong was thinking when he made such
outrageous, imaginary comments, " Su said, adding that Soong should
pray for Taiwan's well-being in case there might be indeed a war
threat for Taiwan next year.

ALCOHOLISM RELATED TO HEREDITY: DOCTOR
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei, Nov. 7 (CNA)
(By sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Alcoholism is related to heredity and the
number of alcoholics is increasing steadily in Taiwan, a local
psychiatrist said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Chen Chiao-chi, deputy director of the Taipei City Psychiatric
Center, said at a seminar on mental health that foreign academic
studies have confirmed correlation between alcoholism and heredity.
</P>
<P>
"Statistics show that if one of the identical twins is
an alcoholic, 75 percent of his or her sibling also suffer
alcoholism,. The ratio among fraternal twins is 50 percent," Chen
said, adding that the alcoholism is likelier to be passed onto males
than to females among family members.
</P>
<P>
Studies also show that those born to alcoholic parents are 10
times likelier to suffer alcoholism than those from non-alcoholic
families, Chen said.
</P>
<P>
In Taiwan, Chen said, about 1 percent of aboriginal tribesmen
suffered alcoholism in the 1940s and the ratio among other local
ethnic groups was 0.01 percent. The ratio among aborigines has surged
to 20 percent or 30 percent by now, compared to 2 percent or 3
percent among people of other ethnic origins.
</P>
<P>
"The figures indicate that alcoholism has become increasingly
rampant in Taiwan," Chen said, adding that he treats an
average of 40 to 50 new alcoholism-related outpatient cases per
month.
</P>
<P>
In foreign countries, Chen said, the average age of
first-time drinking ranges between 15 and 17 and the average age
of alcoholism ranges between 27 and 40. Foreign alcoholics usually
die from cardiovascular diseases.
</P>
<P>
Chen further said local alcoholics' average life expectancy is
only 44 years and their death rate is 10 times higher than
non-alcoholics. Local alcoholics usually die from liver diseases
or gastric diseases.
</P>
<P>
Chen attributed the rise in local alcoholics to a combination of
factors, including increased accessibility to various
alcoholic beverages due to market opening as well as progress
in local wine production technologies. He suggested that the
government impose stricter restriction on liquor commercials or
advertisements to help curb alcoholism.

LATE PRESIDENT YEN'S CENTENARY COMMEMORATED
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>

(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President Chen Shui-bian lauded the late
President Yen Chia-kan Sunday as an architect of Taiwan's economic
miracle.
</P>
<P>
Chen made the commendation at a ceremony marking Yen's centennial
birth anniversary.
</P>
<P>
"Yen was an architect of Taiwan's miraculous economic takeoff and
he had laid a foundation for Taiwan's democratic development,"
Chen said.
</P>
<P>
The president further said two special things about Yen were
worth mentioning. One was that Yen had never presided over any
military meeting during his stints as the Republic of China's vice
president and president.
</P>
<P>
"In terms of archives available to me, during Yen's tenure as
vice president between 1972 and 1975, then-Premier Chiang Ching-kuo
would chair weekly military meetings whenever his father
then-President Chiang Kai-shek was unable to do so due for health
reasons," Chen said.
</P>
<P>
During Yen's presidency from 1975 and 1978, Chen said,
then-Premier Chiang Ching-kuo continued to preside over military
meetings.
</P>
<P>
Another thing was that Yen was the first ROC president to be
buried in line with the nation's state funeral regulations, Chen
said, adding that the funerals of late President Chiang Kai-shek
and late President Chiang Ching-kuo whose presidency ran from 1978
through his death in 1988 were both handled by then-ruling party
Kuomintang.
</P>
<P>
Chen said Yen's state funeral was handled in a simple yet
graceful manner. The nation flag flew at half-mast only on the
funeral day, not for 30 days as the practice adopted after the two
Chiang's deaths.
</P>
<P>
Yen once served as economics minister, finance minister, premier,
vice president and president throughout his political career. "He
had contributed much to Taiwan's transformation from an agricultural
backwater to an industrial powerhouse," Chen said, adding that his
self-effacing and unassuming character is equally worth respect and
praise.
</P>
<P>
Chen's administration has organized a series of
commemorative activities to mark Yen's centenary, including the
issue of commemorative postage stamps and an exhibition of
Yen-related documents and artifacts at the Presidential Office's
art gallery.
</P>
<P>
Sunday's commemorative ceremony was held at Yen's previous
residence which is only a block away from Chen's present official
residence.
</P>
<P>
During the ceremony, Yen's fourth son Yen Chun-tai presented a
silver badge left by his father to Chen in appreciation of
Chen's respect for the late president.
</P>
<P>
The badge was presented by the United Nations'
secretary-general in 1970 when Yen attended the U.N.'s 25th
founding anniversary. The ROC was a U.N. founding member, but has
been shut out of the world body since 1971 when the world body gave
the China seat to Beijing.

TAX INCENTIVES MAY BE OFFERED TO PROMOTE ECO-FRIENDLY TECHNOLOGY

<P>
The government may consider offering tax
incentives to encourage the development of eco-friendly technologies,
Environmental Protection Administration (EPA) Administrator Chang
Chu-en said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Chang said the Cabinet will form a superaministerial task force
to study the feasibility of lowering taxes for high-tech products
that can meet the most stringent eco-friendly standards or greenhouse
gas emission standards, such as vehicles utilizing hybrid
electric-gasoline technologies or jet-engines to reduce emissions.
</P>
<P>
As the U.N.-sponsored Kyoto Protocol on greenhouse
gas emissions will take effect soon, Chang said Taiwan must step up
efforts to develop eco-friendly technologies and reduce
energy consumption. Although Taiwan is not a Kyoto Protocol
signatory, Chang said, Taiwan must abide by its regulations in
order to stay competitive in the world market and avoid trade
sanctions.
</P>
<P>
Noting that Premier Yu Shyi-kun already directed the Ministry of
Economic Affairs to organize a meeting on sustainable national
development in the near future, Chang said the EPA will join forces
with other government agencies to work out measures to boost the
development of eco-friendly technologies, including lowering taxes
for eco-friendly high-tech cars and other products.

MOFA DENIES PROMISING US$27 M. GRANT TO VANUATU
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Nov. 8 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taiwan has so far not promised any specific
amount of cash aid to Vanuatu, with which Taiwan established formal
diplomatic relations on Nov. 3, Vice Foreign Minister Michael
Ying-mao Kau said Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) has only promised that
Taiwan would talk with the Vanuatuan government about financial aid
after the two countries forge full-fledged diplomatic ties, Kau said
during an interpellation session at the Legislative Yuan.
</P>
<P>
Kau denied categorically that the government has promised to give
Vanuatu a grant of US$27 million as reported by a wire service.
</P>
<P>
Legislator John Chang quoted the wire service as reporting that a
spokesman for Vanuatuan Prime Minister Serge Vohor, who signed a
joint communique with Republic of China Foreign Affairs Minister Tan
Sun Chen on the establishment of diplomatic ties in Taipei Nov. 3,
said recently that Taiwan will give Vanuatu US$27 million in 2005 as
grant money to help with various development projects in the South
Pacific island country.
</P>
<P>
Chang said that the MOFA should deny and clarify the Vanuatuan
spokesman's statement if there is no truth to it.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Legislator Sun Ta-chian from the opposition People
First Party asked Kau to explain whether it is true that the
Vanuatuan government has different opinions from that of Prime
Minister Vohor over the establishment of diplomatic ties between the
two countries Nov. 3.
</P>
<P>
Sun said that he would like to know whether Taiwan indeed
established "valid" formal diplomatic relations with Vanuatu.
</P>
<P>
Kau responded by saying that Taiwan and Vanuatu did indeed sign a
joint communique establishing formal diplomatic ties and that Taiwan
will establish its embassy in Vanuatu's capital of Port-Vila shortly.
He added that Prime Minister Vohor has given his word to the MOFA
that the Vanuatuan Parliament will surely support his move.
</P>
<P>
A wire service report from Port-Vila said last Friday that
Vohor's signing of the joint communique with ROC Foreign Affairs
Minister Tan Sun Chen in Taipei was a "personal act" without the
prior approval of the Vanuatuan government.
</P>
<P>
The report said that a spokesman for Vanuatuan Prime Minister
Serge Vohor told a newspaper in Port-Vila that Taiwan will offer
grant money of up to US$28 million to his country next year in return
for Vanuatu's diplomatic recognition.
</P>
<P>
The same report also quoted Vohor as saying that his government
would like to work with both mainland China and Taiwan
simultaneously.
</P>
<P>
Vanuatu forged diplomatic ties with Beijing in 1982 and signed an
agreement with Taipei on mutual recognition in 1992 when Vohor was
Vanuatu's foreign minister.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the wire service report, MOFA spokesman Michel Lu
said last Friday that the rumor of the so-called "invalidity" of the
newly formed ROC-Vanuatu diplomatic ties was deliberately spread by
the mainland Chinese embassy in Vanuatu. The report was incorrect, Lu
added.
</P>
<P>
Kau said Vohor had to keep his Taipei trip secret to avoid
pressure from mainland China.
</P>
<P>
"Twice before, Vanuatu has had the intention of establishing
diplomatic relations with the ROC, but because Beijing exerted
pressure, the relationship did not completely come to fruition, " Kau
noted.
</P>
<P>
About 200,000 people live in Vanuatu, a group of around 80
islands located between Australia and Fiji.

TAIWAN ECONOMY FORECAST TO GROW 4.62% FOR 2005: TIER
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei, Nov. 8 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taiwan's economy is forecast to grow by 4.62
percent for 2005, down slightly from the projected growth rate for
this year, the private think-tank Taiwan Institute of Economic
Research (TIER) reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
At a seminar on the Taiwan economy's prospects for 2005, TIER
President Wu Rong-i also forecast private consumption growth of 2.61
percent for next year, and growth in exports and imports of goods and
services of 8.07 percent and 6.75 percent, respectively.
</P>
<P>
Economic growth for 2005 will be down slightly due to a variety
of factors, including skyrocketing oil prices, worldwide inflation
and mainland China's measures to cool its overheated economy, Wu
analyzed.
</P>
<P>
Worldwide, many leading economic forecasters have estimated that
the growth rate for 2005 will be down slightly from that for 2004,
with some agencies already having readjusted downward their forecasts
for next year, Wu noted.
</P>
<P>
Negative factors, including rising interest rates, surging oil
prices and mainland China's restraint measures, have already begun
impacting the world's economic growth over the third quarter of this
year, he added.
</P>
<P>
However, Wu pointed out that the "downturn" is not expected to
throw the global economy off its current track and consequently,
global economic growth for 2005 will still be higher than the
"historical average."
</P>
<P>
For 2004, Wu forecast that Taiwan's economic growth will hit 5.93
percent, mainly due to the brisk export trade and expanding
investment at home.

Taiwan and Vanuatu have established formal
diplomatic relations after detailed assessments and the two allies
are expected to swap ambassadors in two weeks, Vice Minister of
Foreign Affairs Michael Ying-mao Kau said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Fielding a question raised by Legislator Yen Ching-fu from the
ruling Democratic Progressive Party at the Legislative Yuan Foreign
and Overseas Affairs Committee about the validity of the diplomatic
ties with the South Pacific country, Kau said the ties "should be no
problem" and the two countries will exchange envoys soon.
</P>
<P>
Answering questions raised by Legislator John Chang from the
opposition Kuomintang on the veracity of the report that the
government of Taiwan will provide some US$27 million grant money to
Vanuatu next year, Kau said that Taiwan has so far not promised any

BEIJING MAY USE TAIPEI MODEL FOR PUBLIC TRANSPORT DURING OLYMPICS

<P>
Beijing may use lessons learned in Taipei's
public transportation systems to help alleviate potential traffic
jams during the 2008 Olympic Games in China's capital, Zhang Mao, a
vice mayor of Beijing, said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Talking to a group of visiting members from the Taipei
Journalists Association, Zhang said that Beijing will develop and
overhaul the city's mass rapid transportation system to avoid a
traffic nightmare from occurring during the Games.
</P>
<P>
Beijing City authorities may borrow Taipei's experiences in
streamlining its traffic conditions, including opening exclusive
traffic lanes for buses, Zhang told the media from Taipei.
</P>
<P>
Beijing could also learn a lot from Taipei's MRT system, Zhang
added.
</P>
<P>
Answering a reporter's question whether Beijing will consider
inviting Taipei to jointly host some events of the 2008 Olympic
Games, Zhang said that some people have suggested that Beijing move
the equestrian competition to Hong Kong, taking advantage of the
special administrative region's long history of horse racing, but the
decision is up to the International Olympic Committee.
</P>
<P>
The Taiwan media group, led by Broadcasting Corporation of China
President Lee Ching-ping and Eastern Multimedia Group Vice Chairman
Chao Yi, arrived in Beijing Sunday for a three-day visit. Group
members will also visit Nanjing and Shanghai before returning to
Taiwan Nov. 16.

TAIWAN RAILWAY DENIES REPORT ABOUT PRICE HIKE AFTER ELECTIONS
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Nov.  8 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Taiwan Railway Administration (TRA)
categorically denied a media report Monday that it will raise its
ticket prices after the Dec. 11 legislative elections.
</P>
<P>
TRA Director Hsu Ta-wen said that with gasoline prices rising
steadily, many motorists have opted for public transport to save
money. As a result, Hsu said, the TRA's ticket sales have increased
substantially in recent months.
</P>
<P>
"Against this backdrop, how could we raise train ticket prices at
the moment?" Hsu asked, adding that the TRA has no plan to raise its
ticket prices before or after the legislative elections.
</P>
<P>
According to media reports, the TRA has drawn up a comprehensive
ticket price adjustment plan to be put into force after the upcoming
legislative elections. Under the plan, the reports said, ticket
prices for the "Tzu Chiang" express trains will go up by 11.7
percent; those for the "Chu kuang" express trains will rise 8.8
percent and a steep 38.1 percent price hike will be imposed on the
"Fu Hsing" and various commuter train services.
</P>
<P>
Hsu said the reported plan was recommended by a consulting firm
that is helping the TRA transform its train services in urban areas
into mass rapid transit (MRT)-style commuting services.
</P>
<P>
"Transforming our urban railways into MRT-style commuting
services is our present priority. We'll not consider any price
adjustment plans until that priority goal is accomplished. With a
view to competing with the high-speed railway scheduled to be
inaugurated next October, we may even lower our ticket prices, " Hsu
said.

Diaoyutai Guest House Monday.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting with Hsu's 21-member group, Chen, director of
the Taiwan Affairs Office of mainland China's State Council, said
that agricultural sectors from the two sides of the Taiwan Strait
should further bolster their exchanges and cooperation given that the
two sides have many complementary characteristics and share common

Hsu, who had a falling-out with the DPP after the party failed to
nominate him to run in the 2000 presidential election, has recently

CURRENCY APPRECIATION HAS NOT YET 'FATALLY AFFECTED' TRADE: MINISTER
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Nov.  8 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Minister of Economic Affairs Ho Mei-yueh
said Monday that the recent appreciation of the New Taiwan dollar has
not yet brought about a "fatal impact" on Taiwan's foreign trade.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Ho said local exporters should prudently manage
their hard currency holdings lest they incur unnecessary losses from
exchange rate fluctuations.
</P>
<P>
The local currency has appreciated against the U.S. greenback
significantly in recent weeks, closing at NT$32.89 to the dollar
Monday.
</P>
<P>
In her view, Ho said the NT dollar's current appreciation rate is
still not expected to "fatally" affect Taiwan's external trade for
the moment.
</P>
<P>
"With the NT dollar appreciating, local exporters'
competitiveness will certainly be dampened. But the extent of the
impact will depend on how much the currency of a specific competing
country has appreciated. If its currency appreciation range is
similar to our currency's appreciation range against the greenback,
the impact will be limited," Ho said. The currencies of Japan, South
Korea and Singapore have all appreciated substantially against the
U.S. dollar in recent days.
</P>
<P>
Ho said the Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) will closely
monitor the currency fluctuation trends and work out feasible
measures to help the hardest-hit exporting industries tide over
challenges arising from the currency exchange rate fluctuations.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Ho reiterated that the MOEA has no timetable for
adjustments of public utilities fees.
</P>
<P>
Ho made the reaffirmation in response to media inquiries about
whether the government is likely to raise water and electricity rates
before next February.
</P>
<P>
Ho didn't give a direct response. Instead, she said the
government will handle the issue prudently because any price
adjustment could have a strong impact on people's livelihood.
</P>
<P>
"We have no timetable regarding utility fee hikes. The MOEA will
address the issue in a broader perspective based on the nation's
overall economic situation," Ho said.
</P>
<P>
Fielding questions at a Legislative Yuan interpellation session
late last month, Premier Yu Shyi-kun said there will be no tax, water
and electricity rate hikes before his tenure expires Feb. 1.
According to Taiwan's constitutional practices, the Cabinet should
resign en masse before a new legislature is inaugurated on Feb. 1. It
remains unclear if Yu will stay on as premier after his
current term expires next February.

OPPOSITION WANTS CABINET TO WITHDRAW ARMS PROCUREMENT BUDGET BILL
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Nov.  8 (CNA)
(By Y.F. Low)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Monday
demanded that the Executive Yuan withdraw its NT$610.8 billion
(US$18.23 billion) special arms procurement budget bill before the
Legislative Yuan passes a law to authorize the procurement.
</P>
<P>
The KMT-led "pan-blue alliance" had blocked nine attempts by the
ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) to put the "major arms
procurements bill" on the legislature's agenda. The KMT made the
request ahead of the DPP's 10th attempt expected on Tuesday -- the
final day the legislature is in session prior to a month-long recess
called in preparation for the Dec. 11 legislative elections.
</P>
<P>
Huang Te-fu, whip of the KMT legislative caucus, argued that the
law should come before the budget and that it is unlawful for the
Executive Yuan to bind the legislative bill together with the budget
bill.
</P>
<P>
Also, Huang said he suspected the cost of the procurement has
been "bloated" to profit the United States, asking that the Executive
Yuan plan the budget anew and halve the amount to NT$300 billion.
</P>
<P>
Huang said the arms procurement should not be funded in the form
of a special budget but should be included in the government's annual
budget.
</P>
<P>
The KMT caucus will continue to bar the legislative bill from
being included in the legislature's agenda unless the Executive Yuan
responds positively to its demands, Huang said.
</P>
<P>
Holding a tougher stance on the issue, People First Party (PFP)
Chairman James Soong said his party opposes the government's plan to
spend such a huge sum of money on some "useless" weapons and thus is
also against the DPP's bid to push the "major arms procurements bill"
through the legislature.
</P>
<P>
Soong doubted the accuracy of the anti-missile Patriot-III
systems that the government plans to buy from the United States and
called the anti-submarine planes also on the shopping list
"antiquated" items that are unhelpful to upgrading Taiwan's defense
capabilities.
</P>
<P>
In response, Executive Yuan spokesman Chen Chi-mai said the
Cabinet will never retract the budget bill, which he said has been
proposed for the purpose of defending homeland security and maintain
peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait.
</P>
<P>
Being "uncivilized" does not mean the opposition has the right to
"boycott national security," Chen said.
</P>
<P>
Chen said the Executive Yuan has drafted the legislative and
budget bills following relevant procedures and laws and then
submitted them to the legislature accordingly, dismissing the KMT's
allegation that the two bills were "bound together" as totally
unfounded.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the special budget bill for the government's
expanded infrastructure projects, which was passed in August, had
been handed to the Legislative Yuan using a similar model.
</P>
<P>
Unless the "major arms procurements bill" is placed on the
legislature's agenda on Tuesday, there will not be enough time to
allow the arms procurement budget bill to pass before the current
legislature ends in late January, according to Chen.
</P>
<P>
The government has aimed to have the NT$610.8 billion budget run
over a 15-year period starting in 2005.
</P>
<P>
The procurement covers six batteries of Patriot-III anti-missile
systems, eight diesel-fueled submarines and a squadron of 12
anti-submarine aircraft.

Minister of Economic Affairs Ho Mei-yueh
promoted Taiwan's investment environment at the 2004 Taiwan Business
Alliance Forum, which began at the Taipei World Trade Center Monday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the opening ceremony, Ho said the theme of the forum,
which will last until Wednesday, was IT service, biotechnology and IC
design, adding that more than 500 domestic and foreign companies have
joined the forum, far more than expected.
</P>
<P>
Ho noted that Taiwan is the 15th-largest economy in the world and
it is estimated that its exports and imports could reach US$300
billion this year.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan also ranked fourth in a global competitiveness report by
the World Economic Forum, and its business environment was rated the
third in Asia over the next five years by the London-based Economic
Intelligence Unit, Ho said, adding that this has shown that Taiwan
has an excellent business investment environment.
</P>
<P>
She also said that domestic high-tech manufacturers have been
able to use integration or division of labor to produce and deliver
products to their customers quickly. Traditional industry has greatly
added value through technological innovation, noting that Taiwan used
to export bicycles at around US$50 each a decade ago, but the price
has now risen for some models to US$1,000 each, showing that the
bicycles have become high-tech products, receiving large orders from
big companies.
</P>
<P>
She said that Taiwan will now target information-intensive
service industries, IT services, biotechnology and IC design as
priorities for development.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan welcomes foreign and domestic investment to promote
technology transfer, and expressed the hope that the forum can serve
as a platform for exchanges between foreign and domestic
manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
MiTAC-Synnex Group Chairman Matthew F. C. Miau and IBM
Asia-Pacific President Frank Kern gave a keynote presentation on
"Innovation and Differentiation: Vital for Success In Global Markets"
Monday, which was followed by panel discussions.
</P>
<P>
There will be fact-finding tours to see Taiwan's biotechnology,
semiconductor industry and e-government Tuesday. Arrangements will be
made for individuals Wednesday to meet with Taiwan manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
The 2003 Taiwan Business Alliance conference attracted nearly
2,000 domestic and foreign companies and resulted in NT$138.3 billion
in investments.

alliance conference every three years and a business alliance forum
every year to show the government's determination to solicit business
opportunities.

CABINET MAPS OUT TIMETABLE TO PROMOTE DIGITAL TV

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Executive Yuan unveiled Monday its
timetable for the full digitalization of television in Taiwan by
2008.
</P>
<P>
According to the timetable mapped out by a financial and economic
panel of the Cabinet, all 29-inch TV sets and larger sold in Taiwan
must be embedded with a digital receiver starting 2006, and the
policy will be expanded to cover all 21-inch TV sets and larger
starting 2007.
</P>
<P>
All TV sets sold in the market will be digital products starting
from 2008.
</P>
<P>
Government Information Office (GIO) Director-General Lin
Chia-lung said the promotion of digital TV must be carried out
simultaneously at the production, reception and programming ends in
order to be successful.
</P>
<P>
The government will halve the commodity tax for digital TV sets
before the end of 2010 to lower the prices of digital TV sets and
offer an incentive for the people to replace their old TV sets with a
digital product, Lin said.
</P>
<P>
Lin said the analogue channels currently owned by local cable TV
networks will be recalled in 2010.
</P>
<P>
In addition, he said, the government will subsidize the purchase
of add-on digital TV receivers by low-and-medium income families that
cannot afford to buy brand-new digital TV sets.
</P>
<P>
As far as digital programming is concerned, the GIO is planning
to guide the five wireless TV networks to form a joint transmission
company and to cooperate with high-quality overseas networks to
enhance the quality of domestic TV programs, Lin said.
</P>
<P>
While there are some nine million TV sets around Taiwan, the new
policy is expected to bring enormous business opportunities to
TV-related industries, Ministry of Economic Affairs officials said.
</P>
<P>
The prices of digital TV sets will be comparable to those for
traditional analogue TV sets following the mass production of digital
TV sets, the officials predicted.
</P>
<P>
The prices for an add-on digital TV receiver should range between
NT$2,000 (US$60) and NT$2,900, they said.

RENMINBI MAY UNDERGO DRAMATIC APPRECIATION: THINK TANK
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Nov.  8  (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The appreciation of mainland China's
currency, the renminbi, is only a matter of time, and when it occurs,
the scale will be major, the head of a think tank predicted Monday.
</P>
<P>
Wu Rong-i, president of the Taiwan Institute of Economic
Research, made the remarks in a seminar on Taiwan's economic
prospects for 2005.
</P>
<P>
Wu said the renminbi's appreciation will also trigger
appreciation of the new Taiwan dollar, he said. The only difference
between the two is that Beijing has suppressed its currency
appreciation for so long that once it does appreciate, it will be on
a large scale, while in Taiwan, the currency may undergo only
gradual, moderate appreciation.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the United States has long been impatient with the
mainland's undervalued currency and has urged Beijing to gradually
ease the fluctuation range of its currency.
</P>
<P>
On Beijing's raising of interest rates in late October for the
first time in nine years in a bid to slow the country's breakneck
economic growth and control inflation, Wu said the move has fueled
speculation that the renminbi will appreciate, resulting in "hot
money" flowing into Asian countries, which has also triggered recent
appreciation of Asian currencies.
</P>
<P>
According to Wu, Beijing is very likely to adjust its currency
upward in one swoop, because if the appreciation scale is too small,
it will fail to solve the problem of the mainland's overheated
economy.
</P>
<P>
The appreciation will also pressure Taiwan's currency, Wu said,
but he added that as Taiwan has an open market, it will have to
maintain export competitiveness. In addition, it has recently raised
its key interest rates.
</P>
<P>
He predicted that the Central Bank of China, Taiwan's central
bank, will adopt its consistent stance of maintaining a stable
currency and allowing only gradual, moderate appreciation.

The Republic of China government donated a
further 8 million yen (US$75,902) Monday to help Japanese people
affected by the recent earthquakes in the northeastern Japanese
prefecture of Niigata.
</P>
<P>
ROC Representative to Japan Ko Se-kai presented the donation to
Masa ji Takahashi, president of the Japanese Interchange Association
(JIA) , a quasi-official body authorized to handle exchanges with
Taiwan in the absence of formal diplomatic ties.
</P>
<P>
Major Japanese news media, including NHK and Mainichi Shimbun,
sent reporters to cover the donation ceremony.
</P>
<P>
The JIA will forward the fund to the relevant Japanese
authorities for various post-earthquake relief programs.
</P>
<P>
Shortly after Niigata Prefecture was shaken by a magnitude 6.8
earthquake and a series of strong aftershocks Oct. 30, Chen Hung-chi,
Taiwan's deputy representative to Japan, donated 2 million yen in
relief aid to the Niigata prefecture government on behalf of the ROC
government.
</P>
<P>
In the company of Kazuo Okazawa, president of a pro-Taiwan
Japanese parliamentarian association, Chen also traveled to the
disaster zone to convey President Chen Shui-bian's and Premier Yu
Shyi-kun's concern for the earthquake victims.
</P>
<P>
According to the ROC representative office in Japan, there are
about 146 Taiwan expatriates and students in the Niigata area.
However, only the home of a Taiwanese physician in the region was
partially damaged, while no other expatriates or students
incurred any losses in the disaster.
</P>
<P>
As Japan offered various kinds of assistance to Taiwan when its
central mountainous region was rattled by a magnitude 7.6 earthquake
Sept. 21, 1999, the ROC government also invited major private Taiwan
groups, including the Chinese National Association of Commerce and
Industry, the Buddhist Compassionate Relief Tzu Chi Foundation,
Christian churches and other charitable organizations, to donate
relief goods to be sent to the Niigata disaster zone.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Foundation of Medical Professionals Alliance in
Taiwan (FMPAT) has launched a fund-raising campaign to help the
Japanese earthquake victims.
</P>
<P>
FMPAT Chairman Wu Shu-min, who is also a national policy adviser
to the president, said the fund-raising campaign is aimed at
expressing the Taiwan people's concern for the earthquake victims and
gratitude for Japan's past assistance to Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
"We look forward to raising at least NT$5 million in the next
week or two to help with Japan's post-disaster relief work," Wu said.

CURRENCY APPRECIATION NOT FATAL TO EXPORTERS: ECONOMICS MINISTER

<P>
The ramifications of the appreciation of the
new Taiwan dollar have not yet sunk in, but it is certainly not fatal
for local exporters, Minister of the Economic Affairs Ho Mei-yueh
said Monday.
</P>
<P>
The hike in the value of the new Taiwan dollar, which had risen
against the U.S. dollar from NT$33.460 Nov. 1 to NT$32.890 as of
close of trade Monday, will blunt the competitive edge of Taiwan
products by inflating cost, but the seriousness of the situation
depends on the value of the currencies of Taiwan's competitors, Ho
said.
</P>
<P>
She recommended that local traders hedge against foreign exchange
risk by converting their U.S. dollars into stronger currencies.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Ministry of Finance said the value of Taiwan's
exports were posted at US$15.39 billion in October, which is the
second-highest on record for any single month, against imports worth
US$15.05 billion, also a single-month high.

<P>
A private economist said Monday that Taiwan
and Japan ought to cooperate in the information industry because it
will benefit both sides.
</P>
<P>
Chen Tain-Jy, president of the Chung-Hua Institution for Economic
Research, told a seminar on the comparative study of IT industry in
Taiwan and northern Kyushu, Japan, that the technology know-how
accumulated by Japan coupled with Taiwan's marketing strategy will
create a team unrivaled in the worldwide IT industry.
</P>
<P>
Chen said Taiwan used to depend on Japan for capital and
technology in industrial development, but the situation is changing.
Taiwan's IT industry is shifting from manufacturing products for
others to the development of new materials on its own and the
division of labor between Japan and Taiwan in the IT industry has
changed from a vertical one to a horizontal one.
</P>
<P>
There are many cooperation opportunities between Japan and Taiwan
in light of the Japanese technological experience and Taiwan's skill
in marketing, and their proximity to each other geographically Chen
went on.

TAIWAN'S CPI TO INCREASE BY 1.89% IN 2005: THINK TANK
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei, Nov. 8 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A think tank predicted Monday that Taiwan's
consumer price index (CPI) in 2005 will rise by 1.89 percent from
this year' level.
</P>
<P>
Wu Rong-i, president of the Taiwan Institute of Economic
Research, made the remarks when he presided over a seminar on
Taiwan's economic prospects for 2005.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the global price of raw materials is high,
resulting in high prices for imported goods. With the rising costs of
imports, prices of low-end daily necessities will be affected,
although domestic manufacturers will have little room to pass on the
rising costs to the consumer because of steep competition.
</P>
<P>
Based on the premise of international crude oil dropping in price
to around US$40 per barrel, the institute predicted that the CPI will
rise by 1.89 percent, while the wholesale price index will rise by
3.97 percent in 2005.
</P>
<P>
He also described Taiwan's economic performance as "brilliant" in
the first quarter, noting that exports were brisk thanks to the
global economic recovery. Domestic demand expanded, the job market
improved and stock and real estate markets were brisk.
</P>
<P>
In the second quarter, the chaotic political scene following the
March 20 presidential election disputes had a short-term effect on
overall economic development, but with the political factors
gradually fading away and the exports and stock markets continuing to
build momentum, coupled with the government's active pushing of
financial reforms, the economic growth in the first half reached 7.17
percent, and it is estimated that growth will be 5.93 percent for the
whole year.
</P>
<P>
He predicted that in 2005, affected by the still too-high price
of crude oil, as well as mainland China's policy of trying to cool
down its overheated economy, export-oriented Taiwan will be affected
and he forecast a lower economic growth of 4.62 percent.

VICE FM FORESEES CROSS-STRAIT TENSION, BUT NO WAR
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Nov.  8 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Michael
Ying-mao Kau said Monday he foresees tension between the two sides of
the Taiwan Strait from time to time, but no cross-strait war.
</P>
<P>
Kau made the remarks while delivering a report on developments in
Taiwan-U.S. relations in the wake of the Nov. 2 U.S. presidential
election in which President George W. Bush won re-election.
</P>
<P>
Asked by opposition People First Party Legislator Lee Tung-hao
which country can serve as a mediator between the two sides of the
Taiwan Strait, Kau said only the United States is qualified for that
job.
</P>
<P>
Kau further said there should be no fundamental changes in U.S.
policy toward Taiwan during Bush's second four-year term because
continuity and consistency have been important elements in U.S.
policy formulation.
</P>
<P>
As U.S. Secretary of State Colin Powell made unusually harsh
remarks about Taiwan during his recent visit to Beijing, many
lawmakers expressed their concern about the possibility of Bush
saying something harmful to Taiwan during a meeting with mainland
Chinese President Hu Jintao on the sidelines of the upcoming informal
leadership meeting of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC)
forum in the Chilean capital of Santiago.
</P>
<P>
In response, Kau said the MOFA has expressed its hope to the U.S.
authorities via proper channels that Bush will refrain from making
any negative or unconstructive remarks during his meeting with Hu.
</P>
<P>
Kau said the MOFA has been endeavoring to fortify high-level
dialogue channels with the United States in order to avoid
misunderstandings. He acknowledged that there is no high-level
hotline for the top leaders of Taiwan and the United States to
communicate directly. Nevertheless, he went on, the MOFA has crafted
an early warning mechanism to detect any developments in Taiwan-U.S.
relations.
</P>
<P>
Kau further said the MOFA has also been working on improving
high-level dialogue and communication with the United States. "We
must be very articulate in communicating with the U.S. authorities to
avoid misunderstandings. We should refrain from using negative or
ambiguous terms," he added.
</P>
<P>
As to the possible agenda of the forthcoming Bush-Hu talks, Kau
speculated that issues regarding Taiwan independence and U.S. arms
sales to Taiwan will be addressed. "We are hopeful that Bush can
adhere to the basic U.S. stance toward cross-strait relations,
particularly an insistence on abiding by the Taiwan Relations Act, "
he added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Kau said, the MOFA has prepared many reference
materials and data for Academia Sinica President Lee Yuan-tseh, a
Nobel laureate who will represent President Chen Shui-bian at the
upcoming APEC summit meeting.
</P>
<P>
If Lee has an opportunity to talk with Hu on the sidelines of the
APEC meeting, Kau said, the MOFA hopes he will convey the
government's desire to forge a regular dialogue mechanism with
Beijing in order to safeguard peace, stability and security in the
Taiwan Strait.

Singapore Airlines (SIA) was ordered by a
local court Monday to pay NT$1.33 million (US$40,462) in damages to
the Civil Aeronautics Administration (CAA) for crashing an airplane
on the runway of the Chiang Kai-shek International Airport in 2000.
</P>
<P>
In light of the damage caused by the crash to the airport's
tarmac and lighting system, the Taipei District Court granted the
compensation request from the CAA, which runs the airport.
</P>
<P>
However, the a request by the CAA for an additional NT$1.68
million (US$51,110) for losses in rent of airport land used to keep
the debris of the crashed airplane and the cost of the body bags and
blankets used to cover the bodies of the victims was denied by the
court on the grounds this should be shouldered by the aviation
authority.
</P>
<P>
The crash took place Oct. 31, 2000 when an SIA Boeing 747-400
mistakenly took off on a runway closed for repairs and crashed after
hitting construction equipment. A total of 83 people were killed and
71 were injured.

<P>
National Sun Yat-sen University in
Kaohsiung, southern Taiwan, has reported a suspected sunken vessel in
40 meters of water near the Tungsha (Pratas) islands in the South
China Sea.
</P>
<P>
Liu Chin-yuan, director of the university's Institute of Undersea
Technology, unveiled the results of his research of the waters around
the islands over the past year in a seminar held in Kaohsiung.
</P>
<P>
Liu said that his team has been collecting information and
carrying out inspections since last year, and that in May and June
this year, it detected via sonar what the team suspects is a sunken
ship. Possible salvage operations, however, will have to wait for
further confirmation, he said.
</P>
<P>
Hsieh Hsin-tsi, president of the Chinese Underwater Archaeology
Society, said that the average depth of the water around Taiwan is 70
meters and that the suspected vessel is at 40 meters.
</P>
<P>
He said the possibility of finding sunken ships in the waters
around the Pratas islands is high based on historical records and
various inspections.
</P>

National Sun Yat-sen University conducted the survey at the
commission of the Marine Bureau of the Kaohsiung city government,

LOCAL PEOPLE HAVE CONSENSUS ON TAIWAN'S SOVEREIGN STATUS: POLL
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Nov.  8 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The majority of local people have a
consensus on Taiwan's sovereign status or statehood, a spokesman for
Taiwan Thinktank said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Quoting the results of an opinion survey conducted by the private
think tank in the wake of the Nov. 2 U.S. presidential election, the
spokesman said 70.6 percent of the respondents think Taiwan is an
independent sovereign state.
</P>
<P>
The survey also found that 62.5 percent said they agree with
President Chen Shui-bian's declaration in his Oct. 10 National Day
speech that "Taiwan is the Republic of China and the Republic of
China is Taiwan."
</P>
<P>
Moreover, 57.2 percent of the respondents said they agree that
"Taiwan is the Republic of China" is a description of Taiwan's status
quo, and only 18.7 percent said they think the statement is a trick
to promote Taiwan independence.
</P>
<P>
The figures indicate that local people have a stable consensus on
Taiwan's sovereign status, Hsu Yung-ming, an assistant researcher at
Academia Sinica's Institute of Sociology, said at a news conference
at which the survey results were unveiled.
</P>
<P>
"The survey results show that the idea that Taiwan is an
independent sovereign state is a consensus conclusion, " according
to Hsu.
</P>
<P>
The telephone survey of 1,076 adult residents selected from
around the nation was conducted between Nov. 4-5, with a margin of
error of 3.04 percent.
</P>
<P>
The survey also found that 61 percent of the respondents want to
hold a referendum to safeguard Taiwan's sovereign status if the
international community continues to refuse to recognize Taiwan's
sovereignty or statehood.
</P>
<P>
Asked which domestic political party is most capable of
protecting Taiwan's sovereignty, 28 percent cited the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party, 13 percent mentioned the main
opposition Kuomintang, which ruled Taiwan for more than 50 years
until 2000, 1.7 percent cited the pro-independence Taiwan Solidarity
Union and only 0.9 percent mentioned the People First Party. Most
noteworthy was that 56.1 percent said they had no idea.
</P>
<P>
Hsu said the large number of those who failed to answer the
question reflects three possibilities -- local people are not
confident of the political parties' capability; or they feel the
issue is a matter of international concern and that Taiwan does not
have much say; or many people want to resolve the issue by
referendum.
</P>
<P>
As to expectations for Taiwan-U.S. relations during President
George W. Bush's second term, 89 percent said they look forward to
seeing normalization of Taiwan-U.S. relations under the principles of
equality and reciprocity, 70 percent said the United States should
review its "one China" policy and 42 percent said they are worried
that the United States is likely to sacrifice Taiwan's rights for the
sake of boosting cooperation with Beijing.

<P>
The Ministry of National Defense (MND) has
formed a special task force to investigate the cause of an explosion
at an ammunition depot in the southern Taiwan county of Kaohsiung
over the weekend, a senior official said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Fielding questions at a Legislative Yuan committee meeting, Vice
Defense Minister Hou Shou-yeh said the investigative team is composed
of ammunition experts at the military-run Chungshan Institute of
Science and Technology and various firearm production facilities.
</P>
<P>
Hou said the team will conduct thorough investigations into
possible cause of the explosion that killed three soldiers last
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"The investigative team will publish its findings after
investigations are completed," Hou said.
</P>
<P>
According to military regulations, soldiers usually do not
conduct ammunition repair or disposal work at weekends or on
holidays. Hou said the three soldiers were cleaning up the depot, not
handling ammunition when the explosion occurred.
</P>
<P>
The deceased soldiers were 2nd Lt. Hung Tuan-lung, Sgt. Huang
Chien-che and PFC Yang Wu-chang. Huang and Yang were killed instantly
while Hung died en route to a hospital.
</P>
<P>
Hou said the MND will offer the best possible compensations for
their families and will present them with posthumous honors.
</P>
<P>
The depot is located in a remote mountainous region between
Kaohsiung County's Kouping village and Chishan township. As the depot
covers a large area and is far from civilian houses, the explosion
did not affect residents in the region.

<TEXT>
<P>
A favorable loan program for the country's
conventional industries that do not employ high technology will be
renewed for another year, an economics official said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Yeh Min-feng, vice chairman of the Council for Economic Planning
and Development, said that during a meeting earlier in the day,
Premier Yu Shyi-kun asked for a one-year renewal of the program,
which expired at the end of October.
</P>
<P>
A total of NT$450 billion (US$13.67 billion) will be set aside
for the renewed program, which will bring the total credit line to be
extended under the program to NT$2 trillion (US$60.77 billion), Yeh
said.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan's conventional industries have been plunged into
difficulties because of the high cost of local labor and the
government launched the favorable loan program in October, 2000, to
provide them with soft loans.
</P>
<P>
Yeh said the premier decided to extend the program in
anticipation of a slowdown in the global economy next year.

YU URGES 'PAN-BLUE' TO SUPPORT QUICK PASSAGE OF ARMS PURCHASE BILL
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Nov.  9 (CNA)
(By P.C. Tang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Premier Yu Shyi-kun urged the opposition
"pan-blue alliance" of the Kuomintang (KMT) and People First Party
(PFP) Tuesday to support quick passage of the arms procurement bill
and budget for the sake of national security.
</P>
<P>
The premier made the appeal in response to media questions at the
Legislative Yuan.
</P>
<P>
The Legislative Yuan's Procedure Committee is set to review for
the tenth time at its meeting scheduled for noon Tuesday whether to
place the draft bill related to the NT$610.8 billion arms procurement
package from the United States on the agenda of the legislature's
plenary session and then submit it to the committee for examination
after next month's legislative elections.
</P>
<P>
The Bush administration agreed in April 2001 to sell Taiwan eight
diesel-electric submarines, twelve P-3C Orion anti-submarine warfare
aircraft, six sets of PAC-3 launchers and 388 Patriot missiles.
</P>
<P>
However, the "pan-blue alliance" has said that it prefers to see
a re-evaluation of the NT$610.8 billion budget before the bill is
passed by the legislature.
</P>
<P>
Yu said that although competition among political parties during
election campaigns is normal in a democracy, this should not be at
the expense of the nation's security. He therefore urged the alliance
to support passage of the bill as soon as possible.

U.S. TO CONTINUE TO ACT IN ACCORDANCE WITH 'ONE CHINA' POLICY: BUSH
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Washington, Nov. 8 (CNA)
(By Jorge Liu and P.C. Tang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
U.S. President George W. Bush on Tuesday
reiterated that his administration will continue to act in accordance
with its "one China" policy in dealing with cross-Taiwan Strait
affairs.
</P>
<P>
Bush made the comment while speaking to mainland Chinese
President Hu Jingtao on the phone, according to a White House
official.
</P>
<P>
The official also pointed out that both leaders said during their
conversation that they are looking forward to meeting with each other
at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Forum (APEC) set to be held
in Chile Nov. 20-21.
</P>
<P>
In response to questions raised by Hu regarding Taiwan issues
after he congratulated Bush on his re-election, the U.S. president
said that Washington will continue to follow its "one China" policy
based on the three communiques and the Taiwan Relations Act (TRA) ,
according to the official.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the United States does not support Taiwan
independence and opposes any unilateral change to the status quo in
the Taiwan Strait, Bush said that the United States will also provide
Taiwan with defensive weapons in accordance with the TRA.
</P>
<P>
Bush also expressed the hope that Washington and Beijing will
continue to cooperate in various fields in the future, including in
efforts to establish a nuclear-free zone in the Korean Peninsula.

KMT FILES  SUIT AGAINST PREMIER OVER 'PLUNDERED' ASSETS REMARK
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Nov.  9 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The opposition Kuomintang (KMT) filed a
lawsuit Tuesday against Premier Yu Shyi-kun for slander and public
humiliation, while the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)
responded by saying that it is the highest honor for the premier to
be the defendant in the case.
</P>
<P>
Three lawyers representing the KMT elaborated on the reasons for
filing the suit at a news conference presided over by Chang
Jung-kung, director of the KMT's Cultural and Communications
Commission.
</P>
<P>
The KMT said in the suit that as premier, Yu should know that the
KMT assets are a legacy of history as well as the accumulation of
years of efforts, and they have by no means been obtained by illegal
means.
</P>
<P>
The suit charges that the premier said in an Oct. 5 general
interpolation session of the Legislative Yuan that the KMT assets
were " plundered booty," a statement which was slander and an attempt
to publicly humiliate the KMT.
</P>
<P>
The premier also said on Oct. 21 that when the KMT administration
relocated to Taiwan from mainland China in 1949 after its defeat in
the civil war, "they only arrived with their two feet, " the suit
said.
</P>
<P>
The DPP has put the retrieval of the assets of the KMT, once one
of the richest political parties in the world, as one of its major
campaign themes of the year-end legislative elections. The suit also
claims that the DPP has said in its campaign literature that the KMT
assets were looted, plundered or obtained illicitly, and that these
allegations have smeared the KMT's reputation.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Tsai Huang-liang, DPP whip in the legislative caucus,
defended the premier by saying that he only wanted to "protect
national assets as well as justice."
</P>
<P>
"It is the highest honor in the premier's entire political career
[to be the defendant in the case], " Tsai said, adding that the DPP
caucus and the public should support the premier to retrieve the
ill-gotten assets.
</P>
<P>
Tsai lashed out at the KMT for "shamelessly plundering from the
nation and the public, " adding that statistics provided by the
National Property Bureau of the Ministry of Finance have shown that
the KMT has only returned 1.12 percent of its ill-gotten assets since
2002, but he suspected the real amount looted by the KMT is far
greater than the figure provided by the bureau.
</P>
<P>
Despite the fact that the KMT has repeatedly said that it will
return the ill-gotten assets, Tsai said that it has used its slim
majority in the legislature to block the review of a bill on the
handling of assets of political parties in the legislature's
Procedure Committee 68 times.
</P>
<P>
"The KMT will not reflect upon itself and knows no shame, and it
will eat bitter fruit come the Dec. 11 legislative elections, " he
said.

PREMIER MULLING POSSIBLE COUNTERSUIT AGAINST KMT
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Nov.  9 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Premier Yu Shyi-kun said Tuesday that he
welcomes a slander lawsuit filed by the opposition Kuomintang (KMT)
and is not ruling out the possibility of filing a countersuit.
</P>
<P>
Premier Yu was responding to a lawsuit filed by the KMT earlier
in the day against him for calling the KMT assets "plundered booty."
</P>
<P>
The premier said that the KMT assets were obtained illicitly, and
he urged third parties with good intentions not to purchase them.
</P>
<P>
"When the KMT retreated to Taiwan after its defeat in the civil
war on the mainland, it came empty-handed, " the premier said, adding
that all the assets should belong to the 23 million people, and that
all parties want to see the KMT return its ill-gotten gains.
</P>
<P>
His words came after recent controversy surrounding former
President Lee Teng-hui's remarks during stumping trips where he said
not to think Taiwan's present prosperity hinges on 9.6 million taels
of gold brought by the KMT -- widely credited with stabilizing the
economy of the island at the time -- because the ship transporting
the gold sank on its way to Taiwan. A tael is a Chinese unit of
weight. One tael is equivalent to 1.2 oz or 37.4 grams. Tael bars are
widely traded in Chinese-speaking countries, mainly Hong Kong and
Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
That amount of gold on today's market would be worth about US$5
billion.
</P>
<P>
Yu said that KMT Chairman Lien Chan said as early as 2000 that
the KMT would return its ill-gotten assets, but he has so far not
matched his words with deeds.
</P>
<P>
Chen Chi-mai, a spokesman for the Executive Yuan, also reaffirmed
Tuesday the government's determination to retrieve the KMT's
ill-gotten assets.
</P>
<P>
Chen said that an investigation report by the Control Yuan, the
highest watchdog body of the nation, has shown that the KMT has in
the past taken over assets left by the Japanese colonial rulers in
Taiwan, or used its power as the only political party on the island
to obtain national assets through cheap purchases, or through
"donations" by local governments.
</P>
<P>
"The Executive Yuan, based on the protection of national and
public interests, demands that the KMT return to the public the booty
it looted from the nation," he said, adding that "the premier made an
appropriate comment on the issue that is subject to public judgment."
</P>
<P>
Since the KMT has now filed a lawsuit over the issue, the
Executive Yuan will use the window of opportunity to compel KMT
Chairman Lien to reveal in court the workings of the party's income
and distribution of funds, Chen said.
</P>
<P>
The Executive Yuan has recently targeted eight pieces of land in
Panchiao, Taipei County that are currently under the name of the
KMT-owned Broadcasting Cooperation of China (BCC), Chen said, adding
that it will file another suit to challenge the BCC's land in Pali,
Taipei County, next week.

MAGNITUDE OF OVERNIGHT QUAKE REVISED TO 6.7 ON RICHTER SCALE
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei, Nov. 9 (CNA)
(By Y.F. Low)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Seismology Center of the Central Weather
Bureau (CWB) Tuesday corrected the magnitude of an overnight
earthquake to 6.7 from 5.7 on the Richter scale.
</P>
<P>
Seismologists said a smaller quake coming a few seconds before
the strong quake had disrupted the reading and caused the rare
mistake.
</P>
<P>
The 6.7 magnitude earthquake occurred at 11:54 p.m. Monday night,
with the epicenter located 96.6 kilometers east of the eastern city
of Hualien and 10 kilometers under the seabed, according to the
center.
</P>
<P>
The tremor was felt in most parts of the island. No casualties or
damage was reported.
</P>
<P>
It was first mistakenly reported by the center as measuring 5.7
on the Richter scale and occurring at 11: 55 p.m. from an epicenter
one kilometer northwest of Nanao, Ilan County, and 19 kilometers
underground.
</P>
<P>
CWB Deputy Director-General Hsin Tsai-chin said because there was
asmaller quake which came just four seconds before that, the
computer-aided automatic locating system confused the shockwaves of
the two quakes and misread its magnitude.
</P>
<P>
The bureau discovered the mistake and immediately released a
correction about one hour later after a manual analysis of the
recorded data, Hsin said.
</P>
<P>
Hsin said earthquakes occurring off Taiwan's eastern coast
usually carry a larger margin of error because they are recorded
merely by an observation post located in the sea.
</P>
<P>
However, Hsin admitted that it is rare for the computer system to
produce a mistake with an error margin as wide as this one.
</P>
<P>
He promised that the bureau will work to improve its earthquake
measuring mechanism to reduce the chances of misjudgment in the
future.

INDONESIAN MINISTER TO VISIT TAIWAN TO DISCUSS LABORERS EXPORT ISSUE
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Jakarta,  Nov. 9 (CNA)
(By K.C. Yu and P.C.Tang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Indonesian Minister of Manpower and Trans-
immigration Affairs Falmi Idris announced Tuesday that he will visit
Taiwan at the end of November to discuss the resumption of Indonesian
laborers export to Taiwan with Taiwan officials.
</P>
<P>
The minister made the announcement while meeting with several
representatives from local labor employment agencies,
non-governmental organizations and those who are concerned about
labor groups' interest.
</P>
<P>
"I decide to visit Taiwan at the end of this month to discuss
with officials of the Taiwan government matters regarding its
reintroduction of Indonesian laborers to the island, " the minister
said.
</P>
<P>
Idris also revealed that Taiwan will soon resume importing
laborers from Indonesia, allowing about 60,000 to 100,000 Indonesian
workers to work on Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Idris, who became a Cabinet member of the new Indonesian
government formed Oct. 20 of this year, will be the first
ministerial-level Indonesian minister to visit Taiwan after the
inauguration of former Indonesian President Megawati Sukarnopurri in
July 2001.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan's Council of Labor Affairs (CLA) decided in August 2002 to
impose a ban on the import of Indonesian laborers in retaliation for
the high rate of illegal work and absconding of Indonesian workers in
Taiwan, as well as unreasonable brokerage fees charged by the
Indonesian side.

PREMIER DENIES REPORT ABOUT FINANCIAL AID TO VANUATU
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Nov.  9 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Premier Yu Shyi-kun said Tuesday the
government did not promise a large aid package to the South Pacific
island nation of Vanuatu in exchange for diplomatic recognition of
Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Yu made the remarks during a Legislative Yuan interpellation
session where opposition Kuomintang Legislator Sun Guo-hua asked the
premier whether foreign wire service reports about Taiwan's large aid
offer to Vanuatu were correct.
</P>
<P>
"Previous foreign wire service reports said Taiwan pledged to
offer a grant of US$28 million (NT$950 million) to Vanuatu but later
reports said the aid amount could reach US$6 billion. Were those
reports correct?" Sun asked.
</P>
<P>
In response, Yu said the Republic of China government, while
establishing diplomatic relations with a specific country, is likely
to pledge aid, nevertheless, the government has never pledged an
extremely large special offer to a single diplomatic ally.
</P>
<P>
Even though he has not yet read the joint communique signed by
Minister of Foreign Affairs Tan Sun Chen and Vanuatu Prime Minister
Serge Vohor in Taipei last Thursday on the establishment of full
diplomatic ties between the two countries, Yu said he is convinced
that the ROC government did not offer Vanuatu money.
</P>
<P>
Asked whether the reported US$6 billion aid offer could be paid
out of the confidential budgets of the Presidential Office or the
national security units, Yu ruled out that possibility, saying that
all of the nation's foreign aid has consistently been listed in the
Ministry of Foreign Affairs' (MOFA's) "secret budget" section.
</P>
<P>
Vanuatu forged full-fledged diplomatic ties with the ROC last
Thursday after Vohor signed a joint communique with Minister Chen to
that effect. With a population of about 200,000, Vanuatu is the ROC's
27th diplomatic ally.
</P>
<P>
Despite confusing reports about Taiwan's aid offer to Vanuatu,
Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Michael Ying-mao Kau said Monday the
ROC has not made any firm commitment yet on aid.
</P>
<P>
Fielding questions at a Legislative Yuan committee meeting a day
earlier, Kau also said Taiwan and Vanuatu will exchange ambassadors
in two weeks to facilitate promotion of bilateral exchanges and
cooperation in various fields.

The Coast Guard on Tuesday uncovered 2.5
kilograms of pure-grade heroin in a cargo container delivered from
mainland China and arrested a key suspect.
</P>
<P>
The container, full of wooden furniture, was discovered at a
container terminal in the southern Taiwan port city of Kaohsiung, a
coast guard official said, adding that the heroin was hidden in the

Initial investigations showed that the drug originated in

TAIWAN'S ECONOMIC EXPERIENCE IS UNPARALLELED GLOBALLY: CIER CHAIRMAN
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Nov. 9 (CNA)
(By Y.F. Low)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The economic and trade experience of Taiwan
is unparalleled in the world with 18 Taiwanese products or
technologies ranking first globally, even though the nation's
population accounts for only 0.4 percent of the world, Chung Hua
Institution for Economic Research (CIER) Chairman Vincent Siew said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Siew made the remarks in his opening address to a seminar on
international economic cooperation and development organized by the
CIER in Taipei.
</P>
<P>
Siew said Taiwan has emerged from its past agriculture-based
economy to become one of the world's manufacturing giants today over
a period of 50 years.
</P>
<P>
In 2002, Taiwan was the world's 15th-largest trading country,
with its export and import volumes ranking 14th and 16th largest,
respectively, in the world, Siew pointed out.
</P>
<P>
While a total of 16 products or technologies from Taiwan ranked
first in the world in 2002, the number has increased to 18 this year,
Siew said.
</P>
<P>
For instance, he said, Taiwan supplies to the world 50 percent of
the key parts and components for such products as notebook computers,
silicon chips, motherboards, digital cameras and glass fibers.
</P>
<P>
These achievements are marvelous to a country with a small
population of 23 million, which accounts for merely 0.4 percent of
that of the entire world, Siew said.
</P>
<P>
He said Taiwan's accession to the World Trade Organization (WTO)
was a milestone for the island's efforts to take part in
international organizations and has enabled Taiwan to play a part in
promoting global economic and social development.

DPP'S BID TO PUT ARMS PROCUREMENT BILL ON AGENDA FAILS AGAIN
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Dec.  9 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The opposition "pan-blue alliance" of the
Kuomintang and the People First Party, making use of its majority in
the Legislative Yuan, for the 10th time blocked putting a bill for
arms purchases from the United States on the agenda Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The "pan-green camp" of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) and its ally, the Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU), made one last
effort to have the NT$610.8 billion (US$18.23 billion) arms
procurement bill brought to the floor in the Procedure Committee in
the legislature.
</P>
<P>
Since the legislature is scheduled to go into a one-month recess
Wednesday in preparation for the Dec. 11 legislative elections,
Tuesday was the last chance for the "pan-green camp" to have the
high-profile bill put on the agenda.
</P>
<P>
But the outnumbered DPP and TSU legislators withdrew from the
meeting en masse in protest, shouting that the "pan-blue alliance"
has neglected national security.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Premier Yu Shyi-kun said it was wrong for the
"pan-blue alliance" to block the arms procurement bill with
procedural issues.
</P>
<P>
He said that the bill could have been discussed rationally,
either in the committee or in its review or in public hearings.
</P>
<P>
He said the "pan-blue alliance" shouldn't block the bill by
making use of its majority, stressing again that this is why the
"pan-greens" should command over half the seats in the 225-member
legislature in the year-end elections.
</P>
<P>
The Executive Yuan has said that unless the arms procurement bill
is placed on the legislature's agenda Tuesday, there will not be
enough time to allow the arms procurement special budget bill to pass
before the current legislature ends in late January.
</P>
<P>
The Executive Yuan proposed in June to buy six batteries of
Patriot-III anti-missile systems, eight diesel-electric submarines
and a squadron of 12 anti-submarine aircraft from the United States
with NT$610.8 billion special budget to be paid for over a 15-year
period starting in 2005.

CIVIC GROUP ELATED OVER REJECTED ARMS PROCUREMENT BILL
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Nov.  9 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Members of a civic group opposed to the
NT$610.8 billion (US$18.23 billion) special budget for an arms
procurement from the United States were elated Tuesday after learning
that the issue failed for the 10th time to be put to the legislature
for discussion.
</P>
<P>
Members of the Democracy Action Alliance (DAA), which has staged
a sit-in outside the Legislative Yuan since Monday afternoon to
protest the sale, cheered loudly after hearing that the opposition
"pan-blue alliance" of the Kuomintang and the People First Party
(PFP) had again blocked the bill.
</P>
<P>
The members sang songs and threw gloves painted with anti-arms
purchase slogans into the air. PFP Legislators Pang Chien-kuo and Lee
Yung-ping also were on hand to lend support.
</P>
<P>
Huang Kuang-kuo, a professor and DAA convener, said that
political parties have had election strategies in mind when
deliberating on the arms procurement package, but the DAA has ideals
beyond electioneering.
</P>
<P>
The DAA thinks that the NT$610.8 billion special budget for arms
procurement is closely linked to cross-strait tensions, Huang said.
</P>
<P>
For this reason, the next step will be for the DAA to promote a
"European Union model" as a framework for cross-strait peace.
</P>
<P>
He said that the EU model is a "supra-country organization, " and
during the process to form a community, no one country will be
"unified" by others, adding that both sides of the Taiwan Strait
could start from establishing direct cross-strait trade, postal and
transportation links.
</P>
<P>
Huang said that the EU model is the only possible way to resolve
cross-strait confrontations, adding that if a community concept can
serve as a cross-strait peace framework, then Taiwan will have no
need to spend astronomical sums on special budgets to buy arms from
the United States and engage in an arms race with the other side of
the Taiwan Strait.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan society will also no longer have to suffer from ethnic
divisions, Huang added.
</P>
<P>
The Executive Yuan proposed the NT$610.8 billion special budget
to buy six Patriot-III anti-missile batteries, eight diesel-electric
submarines and a squadron of 12 anti-submarine aircraft, which will
be paid for over a 15-year period starting in 2005.

CLA TO LIFT BAN ON INDONESIAN WORKERS AFTER SIGNING MOU
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Nov.  9 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Council of Labor Affairs (CLA) said
Tuesday it would lift the ban on importing Indonesian workers after
Indonesia signs a memorandum of understanding (MOU) with Taiwan on
labor management cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The Cabinet-level council made the remarks after Falmi Idris,
minister of manpower and trans-immigration affairs of Indonesia,
announced earlier in the day that he will visit Taiwan late this
month to discuss resumption of Indonesian labor export to Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
CLA Chairwoman Chen Chu said now that the Indonesian government
has shown goodwill toward cooperation with Taiwan in resolving labor
management problems, the CLA will handle the issue in a reciprocal
manner.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the CLA has signed MOUs with countries supplying
laborers to facilitate cooperation in introducing foreign blue-collar
workers, housemaids and caregivers into Taiwan, Chen said
negotiations with Indonesia will follow the principles set forth in
those accords.
</P>
<P>
If all goes smoothly, Chen said, imports of Indonesian workers
will resume before long.
</P>
<P>
The CLA has imposed an across-the-board ban on the import of
Indonesian workers since Aug. 1, 2002 in retaliation for Indonesia's
failure to cooperate with Taiwan in fixing the high absconding rate
of Indonesian workers in Taiwan as well as unreasonable brokerage
fees charged by the Indonesian side.
</P>
<P>
CLA Chairwoman Chen made a visit to Jakarta earlier this year to
discuss a labor management cooperative agreement. The CLA originally
expected to sign an MOU soon after Chen's Jakarta visit. However, the
signing was delayed by Indonesia's presidential election. Now that
the new Indonesian administration has been inaugurated, Chen said she
expects to finalize the MOU signing soon.
</P>
<P>
According to reports from Jakarta, Idris said during a meeting
with representatives from several local-level Indonesian labor
employment agencies, non-governmental organizations and those who are
concerned about labor groups' interest that he has decided to visit
Taiwan at the end of November to discuss a bilateral labor management
cooperative agreement.
</P>
<P>
Idris also disclosed that Taiwan may soon resume importing
laborers from Indonesia, allowing about 60,000 to 100,000 Indonesian
workers to work in Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Idris, who became a Cabinet member of the new Indonesian
government formed Oct. 20 of this year, will be the first
ministerial-level Indonesian official to visit Taiwan since 2001.

TAIWAN'S TAP WATER AVAILABILITY RATIO OVER 90 PERCENT IN 2003: DGBAS
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Nov. 9 (CNA)

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The availability of tap water in Taiwan was
90.9 percent at the end of 2003, up 4.7 percentage points from 86.2
percent at the end of 1993, the Directorate General of Budget,
Accounting and Statistics (DGBAS) said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
DGBAS officials said that in terms of counties and cities, the
availability was below 50 percent in Pingtung County, while the ratio
was between 70 percent and 80 percent in the four counties of Nantou,
Taitung, Hsinchu and Miaoli, and between 80 percent and 90 percent in
five other cities and counties. But the remaining 15 cities and
counties all registered an availability ratio of over 90 percent.
</P>
<P>
To improve the living environment of urban areas and prevent
water pollution, the government has stepped up the construction of
sewage systems, the officials said, noting that the government
invested NT$46.44 billion (US$1.41 billion ) between 2001 and 2003
for sewage construction.
</P>
<P>
Taipei County (US$23.15 billion) , Taipei City (NT$9.88 billion)
and Kaohsiung City (NT$3.78 billion) accounted for nearly 80 percent
of the total investment.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that Taiwan's availability ratio of sewage
systems was 10.9 percent at the end of 2003, up 7.8 percentage points
from the previous year. The ratio is the highest in Lienchiang County
(the Matsu islands) at 67.1 percent, followed by Taipei City at
63.3 percent, and 30.2 percent in Kaohsiung.
</P>
<P>
The officials said that the infrastructure couldn't be complete
in one leap because of limited resources, but Taiwan's sewage ratio
was quite low compared with Japan (62 percent) and South Korea (68.4
percent), showing that there is an ample room for improvement.

BUYERS OF EARTHQUAKE INSURANCE INCREASE SIGNIFICANTLY IN 2003: DGBAS

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A total of 122.5 of every 1,000 insurance
policies issued in 2003 included coverage against earthquake damage,
compared with only 1.7 out of every 1,000 in the previous year, the
Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics (DGBAS)
reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
While 934,000 household insurance policies contained an
earthquake insurance clause in 2003, 99,000 fire insurance policies
had supplementary earthquake coverage, according to the DGBAS.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, 53,000 fire insurance policies carried supplementary
typhoon insurance, the DGBAS report shows.
</P>
<P>
Usually there is no separate insurance policy that provides
coverage solely against natural disasters such as earthquakes, floods
and typhoons. These risks are usually covered in fire insurance
policies.
</P>
<P>
Since April 2002, housing fire insurance policies in Taiwan have
automatically included one-year coverage against earthquake, known as
the basic housing earthquake insurance.
</P>
<P>
The new measure was introduced after the disastrous earthquake of
Sept. 21, 1999, which killed more than 2,000 people.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Taiwanese dealer of foreign drinks visited
the outlying island of Kinmen Tuesday, looking for potential trade
opportunities after mainland China announced it would allow Fujian
people to come to the Taiwan-controlled island for sightseeing.
</P>
<P>
Lee Chi-ying, chairman of Diageo Taiwan, Inc., a Taiwan branch of
Diageo that trades a broad collection of world-recognized drinks like
Johnnie Walker, Smirnoff, Smirnoff Ice, Baileys and Guinness, visited
the Kinmen County Government Tuesday, and held talks with Magistrate
Lee Chu-feng and Lee's deputy Yang Chung-chuan to inquire about the
possibility for business cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Lee said during the meeting that mainland Chinese authorities are
expected to open the door for Fujian people to travel to Kinmen and
Matsu before the end of the year, and he believes if Kinmen opens
duty free sales of foreign drinks, it will attract more tourists from
the mainland Chinese province.
</P>
<P>
Yang said that Kinmen's Shuitou Wharf has been permitted to set
up duty free shops. However, the official said, work to construct
dock facilities, including a building for travelers to clear customs,
is behind schedule, meaning the planned facilities can only be
inaugurated by the end of next year.
</P>
<P>
Not until then, pubic bidding for the rights to sell duty free
goods, including foreign drinks at the wharf, will not be offered,
Yang noted.
</P>
<P>
During the talks, Lee also expressed his interest in forging a
cooperative relationship with the county-run Kinmen Liquor Co. to set
up outlets in three major Fujian cities, which are the provincial
capital Fuzhou, Qienzhou and Xiamen, in September.

TSU LAWMAKERS CALL FOR TAIWAN-CENTRIC HISTORY TEXTBOOKS
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei, Nov. 9 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A group of lawmakers, legislative candidates
and supporters of the pro-independence Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU)
staged a demonstration at the Ministry of Education (MOE) Tuesday,
urging the ministry to compile Taiwan-centric history and geography
textbooks for school children as part of a desinicization campaign.
</P>
<P>
The group, led by TSU legislators Lin Chih-long and Huang
Chung-yuan, said Taiwan has had a hard time forging a national
consensus on its separate national identity due in part to the
sinicized education system imposed by the Kuomintang (KMT) during its
55-year rule of Taiwan until 2000.
</P>
<P>
The MOE must overhaul its education policy in line with four
principles -- National history must refer to Taiwan history; national
geography must refer to Taiwan's geography; national literature must
refer to Taiwan's literature; and Taiwan's various mother tongues
must enjoy equal status to Mandarin, Huang said.
</P>
<P>
Noting that desinicizing teaching materials is critical to his
party's localization and Taiwanization campaign, Huang said the MOE
should play an active role in making Taiwan-centric curricula the
mainstream in school education.
</P>
<P>
"I believe Taiwan-centric curricula will contribute to enhancing
local people's awareness of Taiwan's separate national identity and
thus boosting national unity," Huang said.
</P>
<P>
He further said current sinicized history and geography textbooks
for local elementary and junior high school students are unrealistic
and do not cultivate a Taiwan-conscious citizenry.
</P>
<P>
"In the past, Taiwan's history and geography has accounted for
only 5 percent of textbooks used in junior high schools.
Since 1998, the ratio has been increased to 20 percent, but this
ratio remains unacceptable and should be greatly improved," Huang
said, adding that the MOE should do more to establish a
Taiwan-centric education and cultural system.
</P>
<P>
After reading out their petition, Huang and several demonstrators
entered the MOE office, where they were greeted by Wu Tsai-shun,
director of the MOE's Elementary Education Department.
</P>
<P>

Taiwan's free software, or freeware,
industry is growing rapidly, with an annual output of NT$13.5 billion
(US$409 million) registered in 2003, an official of the Networks and
Multimedia Institute (NMI) under the Institute for Information

service industry's development, is one of the driving forces for
relevant industries and is one of the basic platforms for increasing
Taiwan's overall industrial competitiveness, Tung said.
</P>
<P>
A total of 25 companies in Taiwan are involved in the research

<P>
Taiwan and mainland China should shelve
their dispute over who owns Taiwan, maintain the status quo in terms
of their relations and cooperate in developing the economy to improve
the wellbeing of people on both sides of the Taiwan Strait,
opposition Kuomintang Chairman Lien Chan said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Receiving members from the Taiwan Kiwanis Club, Lien said his
party has never wavered in its support for the Republic of China and
will neither accept Beijing's "one country, two systems" formula for
unification with the mainland nor changing the name of the country.
</P>
<P>
Noting that some politicians are calling for a new constitution
by 2008, or claiming that "China is not our country, " Lien said they
are pushing the country on a collision course with the People's
Republic of China, which is a very dangerous move.
</P>
<P>
Both Beijing and Taiwan should set aside their territory dispute
about Taiwan for the time being and cooperate on the economy, which
will benefit both sides, Lien said.

TAIWAN MUST TAKE CARE TO AVOID PROVOKING MAINLAND CHINA: MAC CHIEF
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Nov.  9 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taiwan must make every possible effort to
avoid giving any excuse for mainland China to attack the island,
Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) Chairman Joseph Wu cautioned Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The nation's top mainland policy planner also urged local people
to be more patient in expecting any improvement in relations across
the Taiwan Strait.
</P>
<P>
Wu said the Beijing leadership has felt the challenge to the rule
of the Chinese Communist Party after more than 58,000 public
demonstrations occurred on the mainland last year.
</P>
<P>
The recent series of large-scale riots there further betrays the
instability of the mainland society, Wu said, adding that Taiwan must
be watchful of the possibility of the mainland resorting to
nationalism to try to distract domestic attention from the ongoing
social disorder.
</P>
<P>
"We should exercise prudence to avoid giving any excuse for
Beijing to launch an attack on Taiwan as a way to distract the
mainland people's attention from their discontent over their domestic
plight," Wu said.
</P>
<P>
Stressing that peace and development remain the gist of the
government's mainland policy, Wu said he hopes the mainland can
respond to Taiwan's goodwill and cooperate to improve cross-strait
relations.
</P>
<P>
"As the improvement of cross-strait ties cannot rely solely on
Taiwan's efforts, local people should have greater patience in
waiting for a thaw in the current cross-strait impasse, " Wu said,
adding that the mainland's complicated domestic politics and social
forces could easily affect its policy toward Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Wu acknowledged that Beijing has no intention of
negotiating any opening of direct cross-strait charter flight
services during the Chinese New Year holiday before Taiwan's Dec. 11
legislative elections.
</P>
<P>
Wu said he is still hopeful that Beijing's leaders will change
their minds and name an appropriate person to discuss opening such
services for the convenience of the large number of Taiwan
businessmen operating on the mainland and who intend to return for
family reunions during the Chinese New Year holiday, which will begin
Feb. 6, 2005 and run through Feb. 13.
</P>
<P>
With Beijing's consent, Taiwan carriers operated special charter
flights between Shanghai and Taipei/Kaohsiung via Hong Kong/Macau
during the 2003 Chinese New Year period. The services were not
offered during the 2004 Chinese New Year holiday because Beijing
insisted that mainland carriers be allowed to also provide the same
flight services while declining to negotiate the necessary technical
details with Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
The ROC government said that as the opening of two-way, non-stop
cross-strait charter flight services involve the exercise of public
authority, prior negotiations are necessary.
</P>
<P>
In related news, MAC Vice Chairman Chiu Tai-san said the mainland
is not expected to escalate tension in the Taiwan Strait simply
because of the result of Taiwan's upcoming legislative elections.
</P>
<P>
Chiu was commenting on opposition politicians' claims that if the
"pan-green camp" of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party and the
Taiwan Solidarity Union wins a clear majority in the Dec. 11
elections, Taiwan could face a "war threat" from the mainland.
</P>
<P>
Chiu said the mainland has become more aware of the direction of
Taiwan's mainstream public opinion.
</P>
<P>
"The mainland leaders are not expected to heighten cross-strait
tension simply because of the election results. Instead, they will
base their evaluation on the development of specific events, " he
predicted.

President Chen Shui-bian said Tuesday Taiwan

<P>
Addressing the opening ceremony for the 2004 Taiwan Venture
Forum, Chen said Taiwan has more than 200 venture firms with a

The government-owned Development Fund is a successful venture
business, Chen said. The Development Fund has invested in Taiwan
Semiconductor Manufacturing Corp., United Microelectronic Corp., Acer
Inc. and ASUSTek Computer, Chen said, adding that all of those
companies have emerged as forerunners in various high-tech fields.
</P>

Noting that venture business has helped boost Taiwan's industrial
upgrading and transformation, Chen said his administration has
further eased restrictions on venture business in order to help
accelerate corporate restructuring, reform and industrial
integration.

An anti-nuclear group demanded Tuesday that
the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) discipline Atomic

The Nuke-4 Referendum Initiative Association said Ouyang's claims

Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou promised Tuesday
to crack down on foreigners who work in the city as language teachers
without relevant work permits.
</P>
<P>
Ma told the city council that foreigners who receive work permits

education authorities.
</P>
<P>
He urged the relevant city agencies to crack down on such illegal

Ma made the promise at the request of city councilman Wang Hao,
who claimed that many language cram schools, especially those which
teach English and Japanese, hire native speakers as teachers even
though they do not have permits to teach.
</P>
<P>
Wang claimed that those foreigners cost local university
graduates who major in English or Japanese at least 2,000 jobs in

TAIWAN'S EDGE LIES IN COMBINING MANUFACTURING, SERVICE: OFFICIAL

<TEXT>
<P>
In order to keep its competitive edge,
Taiwan manufacturers should develop their own brands and market
access, as well as combining manufacturing with service, Chung-Hua
Institution for Economic Research Chairman Vincent Siew said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the 2004 Taiwan Venture Forum, Siew, a former
premier, said Taiwan has enjoyed an economic growth rate of 6.28
percent in the first quarter of this year and is anticipating a
growth of 6.40 percent in the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
However, Siew said the rise in interest rates in the United
States and the curb imposed on economic growth in mainland China will
inevitably take a toll on Taiwan's economy in the second half of this
year.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, Siew said, the economic significance of Taiwan is
eclipsed by the emergence of the mainland, which is attracting
foreign technology and getting a say in laying down technology
specifications for certain products via the weight of its huge
market.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan therefore is under pressure to upgrade its industries to
hold its own against the mainland competition, Siew said.
</P>
<P>
In order to tide over the crisis, Siew said Taiwan industries
should shift their emphasis from development and design to marketing
and the development of their own brands.
</P>
<P>
Only by combining manufacturing and service can domestic
industries keep their competitiveness, Siew said.

U.S. TAIWAN STRAIT POLICY EXPECTED TO REMAIN UNCHANGED: KELLY
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Washington,  Nov. 9 (CNA)
(By Oliver Lin and Deborah Kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The United States' Taiwan Strait policy
is expected to remain unchanged in U.S. President George W. Bush's
second term, a State Department official said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Answering questions after a speech delivered at the Woodrow
Wilson International Center for Scholars, James A. Kelly, assistant
secretary of state for East Asia and Pacific Affairs, said that
because the Taiwan Strait issue is tremendously complex, it would not
be conducive to a peaceful resolution for the United States to change
its policy rashly.
</P>
<P>
Based on this, Kelly asserted that he does not expect the U.S.
policy on relations across the Taiwan Strait to change in Bush's
second four-year term as president.
</P>
<P>
Kelly said he believes that the people on the two sides of the
Taiwan Strait have the wisdom and ability to solve their differences,
adding that he expects these differences to be resolved peacefully.
</P>
<P>
On mainland China's stepped-up militarization, Kelly said that it
could cause a military imbalance across the Taiwan Strait, which
could in turn bring about increased cross-strait tensions.
</P>
<P>
He pointed in particular to China's deployed missiles aimed at
Taiwan, saying that they could be weapons of mass destruction and
serve nobody's interests. He added that the United States is aware of
this situation and that it has expressed its concerns to Beijing and
will continue to do so.
</P>
<P>
Kelly also told his audience that he reiterated Washington's
Taiwan Strait policy at a hearing on the 25th anniversary of the
Taiwan Relations Act at the House International Relations Committee
on April 21, and that his testimony at the hearing was crafted after
full-range consultations among all related agencies of the
administration.
</P>
<P>
Kelly noted that at the hearing, he made known once again the
United States' stance that it opposes any unilateral action by either
side of the Taiwan Strait to change the status quo. Kelly also
encouraged Beijing and Taipei to engage in direct trade, postal and
transportation links, as this would create a win-win situation for
both sides in stepping up economic exchanges.

The Times: A savage dance of death in the
alleys of Fallujah.

The green video screen in the back of a Bradley fighting vehicle is
the ultimate in reality television, and that is how we watched the battle
of Fallujah unfold as our 30-tonne steel beast advanced into the district
of Jolan, the rebels' bastion, in the small hours of yesterday morning. 

Outside, in the bomb-blasted streets, up to 5,000 die-hard insurgents
were out to kill. Inside, on a screen accurate enough to show rats scavenging
on the rubbish piles, the battle between luminous green tanks and luminous
green gunmen seemed almost abstract. 

Only the shock of the explosions and the occasional back blast of dust
when a gunner opened fire reminded us we were in the midst of the most
desperate urban battle since the fall of Baghdad. That, and the shrapnel
which went right through my arm later in the morning.

CROSS-STRAIT POLICY PROPOSALS CAN'T WORK WITHOUT COMMON GROUND: KMT
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Nov.  10 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An official of the opposition Kuomintang
(KMT) said Wednesday that with no common ground between the two sides
of the Taiwan Strait, it will be impossible to carry out any
cross-strait policy proposals.
</P>
<P>
Chang Jung-kung, director of the KMT's Culture and Communications
Committee, made the remarks amid news reports that President Chen
Shui-bian will make a major announcement on cross-strait relations
based on his Double Ten National Day speech.
</P>
<P>
"The two sides of the Taiwan Strait in fact have no common ground
on the issue of maintaining cross-strait peace, " Chang claimed,
adding that cross-strait dialogue has not been able to be resumed,
which he said worries the United States.
</P>
<P>
He urged the government not to fool the Taiwan people, adding
that President Chen said before the March 20 presidential election
that if he is elected, mainland China will forgo its "one China"
formula, which it has still not done.
</P>
<P>
Chang noted that the president also said that if the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) and its ally, the Taiwan
Solidarity Union, can win more than half of the seats in the
225-member Legislative Yuan in the Dec. 11 legislative elections, the
two sides of the Taiwan Strait can resume talks next year. Chang said
that "this is just rhetoric to woo voters."

CHEN EXHORTS APEC DELEGATES TO LET TAIWAN'S VOICE BE HEARD
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Nov.  10 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President Chen Shui-bian on Wednesday
exhorted members of the Taiwan delegation to the 2004 informal
leadership meeting of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC)
forum to grasp every opportunity to let Taiwan's voice be heard.
</P>
<P>
During a meeting at the Presidential Office with Academia Sinica
President Lee Yuan-tseh, who will head the Taiwan delegation, and
other delegates to the APEC ministerial meetings, Chen said he wants
them to take every opportunity, private or public, to make known
Taiwan's sincerity in bolstering cooperation among all APEC economies
and its concrete plans towards that goal.
</P>
<P>
The Taiwan delegates should actively seize every opportunity to
talk with their counterparts, particularly those from the United
States, mainland China, Japan and Russia, to make known Taiwan's
stances, Chen noted.
</P>
<P>
Lee, president of Taiwan's top research institute and a Nobel
Prize winner in chemistry in 1986, has been assigned by President
Chen to attend the 2004 APEC informal leadership meeting scheduled to
take place in the Chilean capital of Santiago Nov. 20-21 on his
behalf.
</P>
<P>
Chen said he is confident that Lee would achieve these tasks to
win international support and respect for Taiwan again this year. Lee
also attended the APEC informal leadership meeting on President
Chen's behalf in 2002 and in 2003.
</P>
<P>
Noting that APEC is one of the few international groupings that
has both Taiwan and mainland China as members, Chen said that
although he cannot attend the leadership meeting in person due to
Beijing's obstruction, this does not mean that Taiwan's resolve in
contributing to APEC efforts as a member would be lessened.
</P>
<P>
Chen said that Taiwan is not only resolved to support the
implementation of various APEC projects and plans, it also keenly
expects that other APEC economies will throw their support behind the
projects that Taiwan plans to field this year, including an avian flu
prevention project and regional cooperation in vaccine research and
development.
</P>
<P>
He added that Taiwan cannot afford to restrict itself under the
current difficult circumstances that Taiwan faces due to Beijing's
ubiquitous diplomatic suppression and the international community's
reluctance to offend Beijing.
</P>
<P>
"We must take the initiative in creating opportunities for
ourselves and make as many friends as possible in the international
community, particularly in important dialogue platforms such as
APEC," Chen asserted.
</P>
<P>
As security will be one of the main themes to be discussed at
this year's APEC conferences, Chen said, the Taiwan delegation should
express Taiwan's desire to play an active role in cultivating a safe
living environment and its past contributions in this regard, Chen
added.
</P>
<P>
President Chen received a formal invitation from Chilean
President Ricardo Lagos Escobar in October to attend the 2004 APEC
informal leadership meeting but decided to let Lee attend on his
behalf to spare the host country any unnecessary trouble.
</P>
<P>
APEC groups 21 Asia-Pacific economies -- Australia, Brunei,
Canada, Chile, China, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Japan, South Korea,
Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea, Peru, the
Philippines, Russia, Singapore, Taiwan, Thailand, the United States
and Vietnam.

<P>
The Ministry of National Defense (MND) is
promoting a no-smoking directive in the military in an effort to help
implement a government no-smoking policy as well as optimize the
public health and environment, a military spokesman said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
MND spokesman Maj. Gen. Huang Suey-sheng said at a press
conference that under the no-smoking military project, smoking will
gradually be wiped out from the armed forces, including barracks,
military organizations and military academies, eventually making the
entire military smoke-free.
</P>
<P>
Also speaking at the press conference, Lu Li-chun, a division
director with the MND Medical Affairs Bureau, said that to facilitate
the no-smoking policy, the MND will enact regulations on smoking
prevention and will establish "smoking prevention committees" in
military units at various levels.
</P>
<P>
According to Huang, the MND is also sponsoring classes and
workshops to help personnel in uniform to quit smoking and opening
outpatient services at military hospitals and clinics for the same
purpose.

'PEACE FOR TAIWAN' POSTER DISPLAYED OUTSIDE U.N. HEADQUARTERS
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Members of an anti-war alliance from
Taiwan displayed a poster bearing the slogan "Peace for Taiwan" in
front of the United Nations headquarters in New York City Wednesday
in a bid to raise global concern over peace and stability across the
Taiwan Strait.
</P>
<P>
The poster was pieced together from more than 20 separate
paintings completed by a group of Taiwanese children and parents Oct.
31 to depict their desire for peace.
</P>
<P>
Alliance leader Chou Sheng-hsin said the poster represents the
call for peace of the Taiwanese people, who are facing the imminent
threat of more than 600 missiles and the strong military power of
mainland China.
</P>
<P>
By organizing the event, the alliance was trying to call global
attention to the issue of peace and stability across the Taiwan
Strait, to call for more positive participation by the U.N. in
cross-strait peace and stability, and to promote closer connections
between Taiwan's peace movement and those of other parts of the
world, Chou said.
</P>
<P>
Chou said the alliance is also promoting the launch of a
referendum aimed at pressing Taipei and Beijing to sign a 50-year
peace accord under the principle of maintaining the cross-strait
status quo.
</P>
<P>
The alliance was founded by a group of academics in June after
the Executive Yuan proposed a NT$610.8 billion (US$18.23 billion)
arms procurement package from the United States.
</P>
<P>
In addition to staging a June 19 demonstration against the arms
procurement, the alliance has started a signature campaign in an
attempt to initiate a public referendum on the arms procurement.

TWO MAINLAND CHINESE OFFICIALS ARRIVE IN TAIPEI FOR LOW-PROFILE VISIT
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Nov. 10 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two mainland Chinese officials arrived in
Taipei Wednesday for a low-profile visit.
</P>
<P>
Li Xiaoyun, director of the Cross-Strait Economic and
Technological Exchange Center under mainland China's Taiwan Affairs
Office, and Feng Chuozhe, president of Beijing's state-run
Cross-Strait Travel Service, were greeted by an anonymous official
upon their arrival at Chiang Kai-shek International Airport, Taiwan's
main gateway.
</P>
<P>
Li and Feng became grim-faced when they saw a crowd of
journalists and cameramen at the airport and they refused to answer
specific press inquiries.
</P>
<P>
Reporters had speculated Li and Feng are visiting Taiwan to
discuss issues regarding the opening of direct charter flights across
the Taiwan Strait during the upcoming Chinese New Year holiday, as
well as the opening of Taiwan to mainland Chinese tourists.
</P>
<P>
Li and Feng, however, said they were invited to make a
sightseeing trip. "We will travel around the island for sightseeing,
" Li said, adding that he and Feng received the invitation a long
time ago but postponed the trip until now for a variety of reasons.
</P>
<P>
This is Li's first trip to Taiwan, while Feng has visited
on several previous occasions.
</P>
<P>
Senior Taiwan officials in charge of mainland affairs, including
Mainland Affairs Council Chairman Joseph Wu, have on many occasions
urged Beijing's leaders to name an appropriate person to discuss
cross-strait charter flights during the Chinese New Year holiday for
the convenience of the large number of Taiwan businessmen operating
on the mainland, commonly known as Taishang.
</P>
<P>
With Beijing's consent, Taiwan carriers operated special charter
flights between Shanghai and Taipei/Kaohsiung via Hong Kong/Macau
during the 2003 Chinese New Year period. The services were not
offered during the 2004 Chinese New Year holiday because Beijing
insisted that mainland carriers be allowed to also provide the same
flight services while declining to negotiate the necessary technical
details with Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
The ROC government said that as the opening of two-way, non-stop
cross-strait charter flight services involves the exercise of public
authority, prior negotiations are necessary. The upcoming lunar New
Year holiday falls between Feb. 6, 2005 and Feb. 13.

TAIWAN SUPPORTS ESTABLISHMENT OF ASIA-PACIFIC FREE TRADE ZONE
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei, Nov. 10 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taiwan supports the establishment of a Free
Trade Area of the Asia-Pacific to help achieve the Bogor Goals of
accelerating regional free trade and investment reforms, Taiwan's
delegates to a sub Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum
business grouping said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The establishment of the Free Trade Area of the Asia-Pacific
(FTAAP) -- a resolution reached during an APEC Business Advisory
Council (ABAC) meeting held in Taipei in May -- will help accelerate
the implementation of plans that were hammered out during the
Bogor-round meetings of APEC leaders and ministers, said the
delegates.
</P>
<P>
Jeffrey Koo, chairman of the Taiwan-based Chinatrust Financial
Holding Corporation, TECO Group Chairman Huang Mao-hsiung and I-Mei
Foods Vice Chairman Kao Chih-shang, who will take part in the 2004
ABAC meeting to be held in Chile Nov. 16-18, made the remarks during
an audience at the Presidential Office with President Chen Shui-bian.
</P>
<P>
The trio presented Chen with a copy of an ABAC proposal letter to
the APEC informal leadership meeting scheduled to take place in the
Chilean capital of Santiago Nov. 20-21 urging the APEC leaders to
help facilitate the establishment of the FTAAP.
</P>
<P>
The ABAC proposal letter also suggests that leaders of the APEC
economies discuss the feasibility of implementing a Trans-Pacific
Business Agenda -- a resolution reached in another ABAC meeting held
last month in Auckland, New Zealand -- to further optimize APEC's
free trade spirit and obligations, the three delegates said.
</P>
<P>
They argued that although the Bogor Goals is the bedrock of APEC
visions for trade and investment liberalization, and although APEC
leaders have constantly vowed to help achieve the goals, it is
difficult to imagine some of the APEC economies, particularly
industrially-advanced countries, fully opening their trade and
investment regimes before 2010 as stipulated in the Bogor Goals.
</P>
<P>
The ABAC proposal letter also expects that the APEC will move to
improve the security and supervision system of banking and financing
institutions in the Asia-Pacific region, they said.
</P>
<P>
ABAC members also issued an Anti-Corruption Statement during
their last meeting, calling for APEC leaders to help foster efforts
to fight against corruption in the region.
</P>
<P>
They said that private business sectors have been the prime
movers behind economic development in the Asia-Pacific region and
that all governments in the region need close cooperation with
private businesses, making groupings like the ABAC important bridges
for communication between APEC political leaders and the private
sector.

DPP DEFENDS EDUCATION MINISTRY OVER TEXTBOOK CONTROVERSY
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The ruling Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) said Wednesday that it supports a plan by the Ministry of
Education (MOE) to revise history textbooks for high school students,
but the opposition accused the DPP of ruling on "ideology" and "an
acceleration toward Taiwan independence."
</P>
<P>
The DPP legislative caucus was referring to an MOE plan for the
next academic year, a draft summary of which was put on its Web site
a day earlier.
</P>
<P>
Tsai Huang-liang, DPP whip in the legislature, said that the
Cairo Declaration -- referring to a meeting of the leaders from the
three major powers, Britain, the United States and China in Cairo
regarding Japan in 1943 -- and the San Francisco Peace Treaty, in
which Japan officially renounced its rights to Taiwan -- are two
major documents on which Taiwan bases its legal status.
</P>
<P>
In the past, the textbooks were the subjective interpretation of
the rulers and are not necessarily correct, he said, adding that
interpretations of history can vary because of different backgrounds
and stances.
</P>
<P>
"The Ministry of Education has the responsibility to clarify the
legal status of Taiwan's sovereignty so that the next generation will
clearly understand Taiwan history," he added.
</P>
<P>
He noted that Taiwan students are taught about the rise and fall
of every dynasty in China but know little about their own country,
citing the example that only a few know that Wu Sha was the
pioneering hero that helped develop Ilan.
</P>
<P>
He expressed regret that the opposition have "overinterpreted"
Taiwan history and link everything to ideology, adding that they
should not try to "reap political gains from high school textbooks,"
</P>
<P>
DPP Legislator Chen Chin-chun said that Taiwan and China are "one
country on each side of the Taiwan Strait, " and that China's history
should not be included in Taiwan's history.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, Lien Chan, chairman of the opposition
Kuomintang, said that recent remarks by President Chen Shui-bian and
the DPP that China is not part of "our country" might come from the
DPP's attempts to cement its pro-independence core supporters or
could be the result of the party's own ideology.
</P>
<P>
He said that ideology is only the belief of a few, but history
will remain unchanged. "Those who try to replace history with
ideology will forego their origins, " he said, adding that doing so
will only bring "disaster" to Taiwan under the present circumstances.
</P>
<P>
Chang Jung-kung, director of the KMT's Culture and Communications
Committee, noted that the DPP's plan to put the establishment of the
Republic of China in 1912 into the category of Chinese history and
that President Chen recently said that China is not part of "our
country."
</P>
<P>
Under such logic, the ROC will also become "not part of our
country" in the future, he said, adding that the government's
approach to integrating "Taiwan independence" into education and its
acceleration of a tilt toward Taiwan independence will only force
mainland China to quicken its pace of seeking unification.
</P>
<P>
The KMT legislative caucus said that the revision of the history
textbooks is an attempt by the DPP to push Taiwan's status into
"uncertainty."
</P>
<P>
Legislator Huang Teh-fu, KMT whip in the legislature, said that
the MOE's plan to make 1945 -- when the KMT administration took over
Taiwan -- the dividing point between Taiwan and China history is
a "questionable mentality."
</P>
<P>
Huang said that the ROC ruled China in 1912 and that between 1945
and the present, its jurisdiction has only covered Taiwan, Penghu,
Kinmen and Matsu.
</P>
<P>
He also said that history has continuity, otherwise banknotes in
Taiwan would not bear the image of Dr. Sun Yat-sen, founding father
of the ROC.
</P>
<P>
Legislator Lee Ching-an of the opposition People First Party, an
ally of the Kuomintang, lashed out at what she called the
ideology-based rule of the DPP, and claimed the party is moving
toward de facto independence through education and national
examinations.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan history currently accounts for only 21 percent of the
history textbooks for high schools, but under the new plan, the ratio
of Taiwan will be raised to be the same as that of China history and
world history, so that each will account for one-third.
</P>
<P>
The establishment of the ROC will be placed in the China history
section, while in the post-World War II Taiwan, a lot of space will
cover the KMT's authoritarian rule, which encroached on human rights
and suppressed political discontent, and the tragic 2-28 incident, a
KMT massacre that has left an indelible mark on many Taiwanese
people.
</P>
<P>
The new textbooks will also elaborate on the Cairo Declaration,
the San Francisco Peace Treaty and an ROC-Japan Peace Treaty that
basically acknowledged the terms of the San Francisco Peace Treaty,
and their "uncertain relationship to Taiwan's sovereignty."
</P>
<P>
It is believed that the history textbook issue is a U-turn, as
supporters of Taiwan independence have used the San Francisco Peace
Treaty to justify Taiwan's right to self-determination because the
treaty does not explicitly state Taiwan's sovereignty.
Over the past five decades, history textbooks have stated that
the ROC, based on the Cairo Declaration, legally took over Taiwan.

WASHINGTON URGED TO BE CAREFUL ABOUT CROSS-STRAIT SITUATION
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Washington,  Nov.  9 (CNA)
(By Oliver Lin and Y.F. Low)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A senior member of the U.S. House of
Representatives called on Washington Tuesday to handle the situation
across the Taiwan Strait carefully.
</P>
<P>
James Leach, chairman of the Subcommittee on Asia and the Pacific
of the House Committee on International Relations, said Americans
must be aware of the sensitivity of the Taiwan question, namely that
mainland China will start a war if Taiwan moves toward independence.
</P>
<P>
Although the concepts of independence and self-determination are
usually synonymous in most parts of the world, this does not include
Taiwan, Leach said.
</P>
<P>
While Taiwan will enjoy a high degree of self-determination as
long as it does not declare independence, a tragic war implicating
many countries will break out immediately if Taiwan declares
independence, Leach predicted.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, he said, the United States must be very careful about
the situation, which he said could jeopardize millions of lives if it
is allowed to spiral out of control.
</P>
<P>
According to the terms of the Taiwan Relations Act, the United
States is committed to preventing the status of Taiwan from being
changed by force and allowing Taiwan to enjoy self-determination, but
this does not include independence, Leach said.
</P>
<P>
He said a recent statement by U.S. Secretary of State Colin
Powell that Taiwan "does not enjoy sovereignty as a nation" only
reflects the long-standing position of the United States.
</P>
<P>
Leach made the remarks at a seminar on the Asian relations of the
George W. Bush administration, which was organized by the Woodrow
Wilson International Center for Scholars.

<P>
Two high-ranking Indian politicians will
arrive in Taiwan Thursday for a three-day visit at the invitation of
the Taiwan Thinktank, a source from the think tank said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The anonymous source said Shri George Fernandes, chairman of the
Janta Dal, United and Jaya Jaitly, former chairman of the Samata
Party, will attend a Friday seminar organized by the Taiwan Thinktank
on the prospects for democratic cooperation among Taiwan, India and
Japan.
</P>
<P>
Fernandes, a nine-term member of the Lok Sabha, or People's
Assembly, left his post as defense minister in May after the
coalition lead by the Gharatiya Janata Party (BJP) lost the general
election. He had been touted as a favorite for prime minister should
the BJP have won the election.
</P>
<P>
During his term as defense minister, Fernandes was the first
Indian minister who sees Taiwan officials posted to New Delhi in his
office and was praised for his handling of India's dispute with
Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
Jaitly is well-known in India as a feminist and writer, and has
campaigned for better lives for India's women.
</P>
<P>
The two will exchange views with other seminar participants on
cooperation among Taiwan, India and Japan in economics, science and
democracy, the source said.

Vanuatu Prime Minister Serge Vohor has yet
to convene a Cabinet meeting to confirm the establishment of
diplomatic relations between the Republic of China (Taiwan) and the
South Pacific island nation, a spokesman for the Ministry of Foreign
Affairs said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Michel Lu said the Cabinet meeting, originally scheduled for
Wednesday afternoon, was postponed because Vohor has yet to return to
Port-Vila, the capital of Vanuatu, due to local elections.
</P>
<P>
But Lu also quoted a spokesman for Vohor as saying that the
Cabinet meeting is only a formality, and Cabinet members will not
oppose the establishment of diplomatic relations with the ROC.
</P>
<P>
ROC Minister of Foreign Affairs Tan Sun Chen and Vohor signed a
joint communique in Taipei Nov. 3 on the establishment of full
diplomatic ties between the two countries. Vanuatu has a population
of about 200,000 and will be the ROC's 27th diplomatic ally.
</P>
<P>
Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Michael Ying-mao Kau said
recently the ROC and Vanuatu would exchange ambassadors in two weeks,
and the establishment of diplomatic ties will have to wait for the
confirmation of its Cabinet meeting.
</P>
<P>
Premier Yu Shyi-kun on Tuesday denied that the government has
promised a large aid package to Vanuatu in exchange for diplomatic
recognition of Taiwan. Vohor has said repeatedly that his country

OVER 70% OF PEOPLE IN FAVOR OF ARMS PROCUREMENT BILL: POLL

<P>
Just over 70 percent of the pubic supports
the Executive Yuan's move to submit the "major arms procurement bill"
to the Legislative Yuan before lawmakers start reviewing its NT$610.8
billion (US$18.23 billion) budget, according to the results of a
survey released Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
While 16 percent of the respondents do not support the move, the
rest said they have no opinion, the survey showed.
</P>
<P>
The survey was conducted by the TVBS Poll Center at the Ministry
of National Defense's commission. It was carried out Nov. 2-3 on
1,073 Taiwan adults, with a margin of error of three percent.
</P>
<P>
The survey found that 46.2 percent of the respondents are for the
arms procurement, compared with 40.5 percent who are against.
</P>
<P>
If the cost of the procurement was cut to NT$500 billion, the
people in favor of the package rose to 54.1 percent, and those
opposing it fell to 30.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
The ruling Democratic Progressive Party's bid to put the "major
arms procurement bill" on the legislative agenda was blocked by the
opposition "pan-blue alliance" of the Kuomintang and People First
Party for the 10th time on Tuesday.

PRESIDENT CHEN PRAISES KERRY'S POISE IN DEFEAT
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Nov.  10 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President Chen Shui-bian praised U.S.
Democratic presidential candidate Sen. John Kerry Wednesday for his
democratic poise and graciousness in conceding defeat at the end of
the bitterly fought race a week ago.
</P>
<P>
Chen offered his commendation while meeting with three core
members of the U.S. Congressional Hispanic Caucus. The three House of
Representatives members, including Rep. Ciro Rodriguez (D-Texas), are
all Hispanic Democrats.
</P>
<P>
After a long, tense night of vote counting, Kerry telephoned
incumbent President George W. Bush Nov. 3 to concede defeat and
congratulate Bush on his re-election. Kerry then delivered a gracious
and heartfelt concession speech in which he said the outcome of the
election should be decided by voters, not a protracted legal process
and that he would not be giving up the fight if there was a chance
that he would prevail.
</P>
<P>
Kerry further said that in an American election there are no
losers because, "Whether or not our candidates are successful, the
next morning we all wake up as Americans." He also called for unity,
saying that America is in need of unity and longs for a larger
measure of compassion and that he will do his part to try to bridge
the partisan divide.
</P>
<P>
Chen said he admires Kerry's magnanimous sportsmanship and
democratic manners.
</P>
<P>
The situation in Taiwan is completely different, Chen lamented.
When he won his first presidential term in 2000, Chen said he didn't
receive phone calls from any of the defeated candidates. "Instead I
telephoned them to express my gratitude for their participation in
the race."
</P>
<P>
This time around, Chen said he won re-election by a slim margin.
But his challenger has so far declined to concede defeat, not to
mention to offer him congratulations.
</P>
<P>
Without referring to him by name, Chen said he feels regret that
his sole challenger in the 2004 presidential race, KMT Chairman Lien
Chan, would not respect the Taiwan High Court's Nov. 4 ruling that
upheld Chen's re-election.
</P>
<P>
"Kerry said those who were defeated in political elections should
not feel anger or rancor. In Taiwan, nearly eight months have passed
since the March 20 presidential election. I don't understand why the
defeated challenger still harbors rancor and hatred. I think we have
much to learn from Kerry and from the U.S. founding spirit, " Chen
said.
</P>
<P>
He further said that although the Democratic Party failed to win
the presidency this time, it has won the hearts and respect of
American people for its performance throughout the race. "You should
be proud of it," Chen said.
</P>
<P>
Chen also took advantage of the meeting to express his gratitude
for the U.S. Congressional Hispanic Caucus' long-term support for
Taiwan's cause. For years, the caucus has consistently thrown its
full support behind pro-Taiwan resolutions and bills in the U.S.
Congress.

RULES ON ENTRY OF MAINLAND PROFESSIONALS TO BE FURTHER EASED

<P>
Mainland Chinese athletics experts who are
employed to assist in training Taiwan's national sports teams will be
allowed to stay for up to six years, the Ministry of the Interior
(MOI) said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, mainland Chinese high-tech experts employed to conduct
research or manufacturing activities in Taiwan can also stay for up
to six years.
</P>
<P>
The new regulations are part of a package of revisions to the
existing rules governing the entry of mainland Chinese professionals
to conduct professional activities in Taiwan, MOI officials said,
adding that the proposed amendments are aimed at facilitating
exchanges of skilled individuals across the Taiwan Strait.
</P>
<P>
The MOI-drafted amendment package will be referred to the
Mainland Affairs Council for further discussions and then be sent to
the Cabinet for final approval. The new package will be put into
practice with the Cabinet's consent.
</P>
<P>
According to the new package, mainland high-tech personnel who
are allowed to stay for four months or longer can bring their spouses
and underage children. They can also apply for multiple entry/exit
permits valid for six years.
</P>
<P>
Last week, the Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) also announced
that Taiwan will offer permanent residency rights to mainland Chinese
high-tech professionals with a view to enriching the island's
technological talent pool.
</P>
<P>
According to the MOEA-drafted rules, mainland citizens with
outstanding achievements in technologies that are helpful to
upgrading Taiwan's industrial sector are eligible to apply for
permanent residence here.
</P>
<P>
Also eligible are those who are professionally trained in skills
related to rising industries, key technology or key components or
products that are needed by Taiwan or difficult to acquire in a short
period of time, according to the regulations.
</P>
<P>
By sector, the technologies considered useful to Taiwan include
digital content, image display, optoelectronics, semiconductors,
electronics, information, communications, industrial automation,
material application, biotechnology, nanotechnology, pharmaceuticals,
medical equipment, special chemicals, health food, resources
development and utilities, and alternative energy resources
development.
</P>
<P>
Eligible mainland residents can file their applications along
with documents proving their credentials after they have legally
resided in Taiwan for two years.
</P>
<P>
After the applications have passed screening by the MOEA, they
will need to undergo final review by the Ministry of the Interior,
which will ensure that the number of mainland residents in Taiwan
does not exceed the quota set by the government, MOEA officials said.

CHEN SUGGESTS BUFFER ZONE, SAFETY CONSULTING MECHANISM WITH CHINA
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Nov.  10 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President Chen Shui-bian said Wednesday
that Beijing and Taipei should agree on a military buffer zone in the
Taiwan Strait and establish a failsafe communications channel to
avoid military miscalculations from either side.
</P>
<P>
After a meeting with his senior national security advisors, the
president said the proposed buffer zone should be off-limits to
warships and aircraft from both sides of the Strait unless the other
side has been informed beforehand.
</P>
<P>
He also suggested that mainland China establish a consultation
mechanism with Taiwan to ensure stable relations. This could be
patterned on the 1972 US-Soviet Maritime Event Consultative Agreement
and the 1998 US-China Military Maritime Consultative Agreement.
</P>
<P>
The president said such a mechanism would help both sides develop
a standard of conduct in and across the Taiwan Strait.
</P>
<P>
In line with the international norms, Chen said his country has
pledged to renounce the development and use of weapons of mass
destruction, including nuclear, biological and chemical. He urged
Beijing to follow suit.
</P>
<P>
For the sake of easing the strain across the Taiwan Strait, Chen
said compulsory military service for the country's draftees will be
cut from one year and eight months to one year and six months,
beginning July next year, and to one year by 2008. At the same time,
the number of armed forces will be cut by 100,000.
</P>
<P>
The president reiterated a suggestion he made in his Double Ten
National Day address that Taipei and Beijing should resume talks on
the basis of their 1992 meetings, and negotiate the opening of direct
charter cargo flights across the Strait as well as charter passenger
flights during the upcoming Chinese New Year.
</P>
<P>
Different from the charter flights in 2003, Chen said this time
the flights would be operated by carriers from both Taiwan and China
and would not stop at an intermediate destination.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the next two years will be crucial for the reopening
of dialogue between Taipei and Beijing, and for the development of
stability and peace across the Strait, Chen urged the leaders in
Beijing to take advantage of the window of opportunity to improve the
wellbeing of the people on both sides.
</P>
<P>
He promised not to change the policy he spelled out toward
mainland China in his second inaugural address on May 20, and the
Double Ten National Day address. In those speeches, Chen promised not
to change the name or flag of the nation, which would be tantamount
to an alternation to the country's political status quo.
</P>
<P>
The president said he would wait for Beijing to reciprocate his
gesture with patience and determination.
</P>
<P>
To underline his great desire to promote peace across the Strait,
the president promised to form a commission to promote peace with
mainland China after the year-end legislative elections and might
invite an opposition leader to head the commission, which will work
out guidelines for peaceful development with China.

<P>
Political parties reacted along party lines
Wednesday to President Chen Shui-bian's latest offer to Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Hours after Chen called for a military buffer zone across the
Taiwan Strait and urged China to reopen dialogue with Taiwan,
Legislator Tsai Huang-liang, the whip of the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) at the Legislative Yuan said the president
has offered another olive branch to China.
</P>
<P>
Tsai said it is also an olive branch to the opposition parties in
Taiwan, because the president promised to form a commission for
peaceful development with China with an opposition leader as its
head.
</P>
<P>
The opposition parties, or the so-called "pan-blue alliance, "
should embrace the president's proposal by working together with Chen
in promoting peace with China, Tsai said.
</P>
<P>
Legislator Lin Chih-chia from the Taiwan Solidarity Union, a DPP
political ally in the Legislative Yuan, said the president's appeal
will fall on deaf ears unless Chen's party wins a majority in the
legislature in the year-end elections.
</P>
<P>
He confirmed Chen's efforts to maintain peace with China, saying
that the president has done whatever he can, but without backup from
the legislature, the president's appeal won't be taken seriously by
China.
</P>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The U.S. State Department on Wednesday
welcomed the statement made by President Chen Shui-bian at an
expanded National Security Council meeting in which he urged Beijing
to resume cross-strait dialogue and proposed the establishment of a
cross-strait military security consultation mechanism.
</P>
<P>
Chen said the mechanism could gradually become a cross-strait
"code of conduct. He also suggested that Taipei and Beijing mark out
a buffer zone in order to reduce tensions between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
The State Department said in a statement released Wednesday
evening that Chen's statement lays foundations for progress and
offers some creative ideas for reducing tensions and resuming
cross-strait dialogue.
</P>
<P>
"We urge both sides to take this opportunity to engage in
dialogue in order to resolve their differences peacefully, " the
department said.
</P>
<P>
Saying that the United States will not change its cross-strait
policies, the department reiterated that Washington is firmly
committed to its "one China" policy, the three joint communiques and
its responsibilities under the Taiwan Relations Act, and that it does
not support Taiwan independence and opposes any move by either side
of the Taiwan Strait to unilaterally change the status quo.
</P>
<P>
"We have long maintained that differences between China and
Taiwan are matters to be resolved peacefully by the people on both
sides of the strait, absent of the threat or use of force, and should
be accepted by the people on both sides, " it also said.

TAIWAN ROCKED BY QUAKE AGAIN
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Nov. 11 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A magnitude 6.0 earthquake rocked eastern
Taiwan at 10: 16 a.m. Thursday, about 12 hours after a magnitude 5.5
temblor hit in an adjacent area, the Seismology Center of the Central
Weather Bureau (CWB) reported.
</P>
<P>
The epicenter of Thursday's quake was located 46.8 kilometers
southeast of the eastern township of Suao, Ilan County, at a depth of
13.9 kilometers beneath the surface of the sea, CWB seismologists
said.
</P>
<P>
It was the largest aftershock so far of the magnitude 6.7
earthquake that occurred at 11: 54 p.m. Monday night. The epicenter
of that quake was located 96.6 kilometers east of the eastern city of
Hualien and 10 kilometers under the seabed, according to the center.
</P>
<P>
Thursday's quake, the third major temblor in three days in the
Taiwan area, was felt in most parts of the island. It had an
intensity of 4 in Ilan and Hualien counties; 3 in Ilan City and the
north-central county of Yunlin; 2 in Taipei City in the north, Chiayi
City in the south and Taitung City in the east, the seismologists
reported.
</P>
<P>
No casualties or damage had been reported anywhere around the
country as of noon.
</P>
<P>
On Monday night, the seismology center's computers misread the
magnitude 6.7 earthquake due to two quakes occurring four seconds
apart, marking a rare computer reading mistake. The center initially
reported that the quake had a magnitude of 5.7, but then corrected
its mistake about an hour later.
</P>
<P>
A magnitude 7.0 earthquake rattled eastern Taiwan on Oct. 15. It
was the strongest to shake Taiwan since the deadly magnitude 7.6
earthquake of Sept. 21, 1999. However, the quake didn't cause any
major injuries or damage because its epicenter was located well below
sea level and far out to sea.
</P>
<P>
The 921 earthquake, the deadliest in five decades in Taiwan,
killed 2,415 people and injured more than 10,000 others. Some 100,000
residents were displaced in the quake, and damage to property was
immeasurable.

TSU OPPOSES COMPENSATION FOR DROWNED ILLEGAL MAINLAND IMMIGRANTS
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei, Nov. 11 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU) caucus in
the Legislative Yuan on Thursday said that it opposes the decision to
provide compensation to the families of drowned illegal mainland
immigrants, saying that there is no need to do so.
</P>
<P>
The TSU, an ally of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP), was responding to a Taichung High Administrative Court ruling
Tuesday that the Miaoli Prosecutor's Office should provide
compensation to the families of eight illegal mainland citizens who
were thrown overboard by "snakeheads" off the shore of Tunghsiao,
Miaoli, in August 2003, after the snakeheads spotted a coast guard
cutter approaching.
</P>
<P>
Huang Chung-yuan, TSU whip in the legislature, said the party
regrets the court's "unreasonable" ruling.
</P>
<P>
Noting that illegal mainland immigrants are given good treatment
in Taiwan's detention centers if they are caught, Huang said
providing compensation for those who drown while attempting to enter
Taiwan is tantamount to encouraging illegal immigration.
</P>
<P>
TSU Legislator Chen Chien-ming said that it is unreasonable for
illegal mainland immigrants to receive the protection of the crime
victims.
</P>
<P>
Chen noted that Taiwan people have been killed in mainland China
and that their families have never received compensation from the
mainland Chinese government, saying that the Taiwan government has no
obligation to provide compensation to the drowned illegal mainland
immigrants.

TAIWAN TO HELP TRAIN MONGOLIAN BUSINESS ELITE
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Nov.  11 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Fifteen members of Mongolia's business
elite are coming to Taiwan shortly to receive two weeks of intensive
training under the joint auspices of Taiwan's Ministry of Foreign
Affairs (MOFA) and the European Bank for Reconstruction and
Development (EBRD), MOFA sources reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The 15 Mongolians, all owners or executive managers of small or
medium-sized enterprises in Mongolia, will be in Taipei from Nov. 24
to Dec. 6 to receive training to be sponsored by the International
Cooperation and Development Fund run by the MOFA, according to Lin
Chin-chung, deputy director of the MOFA's Department of West Asian
Affairs.
</P>
<P>
They will attend lectures on business management, financial
management, business creativity, as well as business research and
development. They are also scheduled to take field trips to several
small and medium-sized enterprises and factories around Taiwan, Lin
said.
</P>
<P>
This will mark the first program that Taiwan carries out in
collaboration with the London-based EBRD in terms of benefiting
Mongolia and other needy nations since the MOFA signed two pacts with
the European banking conglomerate in May 2003.
</P>
<P>
Tien Hung-mao, Taiwan's representative to the United Kingdom, and
Jean Lemierre, president of the EBRD, inked the agreement in
Tashkent, capital of Uzbekistan, on the eve of the EBRD's annual
meeting held May 4-5, 2003, to provide more funds as a long-term
donor to EBRD operations that help 28 countries in Central and
Eastern Europe and Central Asia to develop free market economies.
</P>
<P>
Under the Replenishment Agreement, Taiwan pledges to donate an
extra US$1 million to the EBRD's technical cooperation programs.
Taiwan is the largest non-member donor to the EBRD's technical
cooperation funds.
</P>
<P>
The second agreement commits Taiwan to contribute 1 million euros
(US$1.29 million) to a Mongolia Cooperation Fund that will be used
solely to help Mongolia develop private enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan, officially known as "Taipei China" to the bank, then
formed a supervisory board with three other donors -- Japan, the
Netherlands and Luxembourg. The board will meet twice a year to
review past performance and determine new project priorities.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with a CNA correspondent in London in May 2003,
EBRD President Lemierre said that his bank has enjoyed significant
support from Taiwan for both technical cooperation and official
co-financing over the past 12 years.
</P>
<P>
"We are pleased to see this support continuing, especially as our
work moves into countries in Central Asia," he said.
</P>
<P>
Lemierre also said that Taiwanese companies interested in
increasing their investments in Central and Eastern Europe are
encouraged to discuss their needs in the areas of trade facilitation
and project financing with the EBRD.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Tien told CNA that Taiwan and Mongolia set up
representative offices in each other's capital in early 2003, and
that the contribution of 1 million euros to the Mongolia Cooperation
Fund demonstrates that Taiwan attaches great importance to its
relationship with Mongolia.
</P>
<P>
According to Tien, since Taiwan made its initial contribution of
US$10 million to the EBRD in 1991, followed by subsequent donations,
the funds have been used to help many countries in Central and
Eastern Europe as well as those of the Commonwealth of Independent
States in their transition to market economies. A small portion of
the funds has been set aside to allow the EBRD to recruit Taiwanese
experts to assist in its operations.
</P>
<P>
The EBRD is owned by 62 shareholders -- 60 countries plus the
European Investment Bank and the European Community. The bank was
founded after the collapse of Communist regimes in Central and
Eastern European countries in 1991 to help these countries to change
from centrally planned economies to market economies.

TAIWAN TO LAUNCH PUBLICITY CAMPAIGN AT APEC SUMMIT
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Nov.  11 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taiwan will launch a series of publicity
campaigns at the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum
summit in Santiago, Chile later this month, the head of the
Government Information Office (GIO) said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
GIO Director-General Lin Chia-lung made the remarks when he
presided over a presentation ceremony of local and foreign audio and
video works to promote Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
The series of publicity campaigns will have "Taiwan Stands Tall"
as its theme, with an aim of projecting the image of Taiwan progress
to the participants of the APEC summit, Lin said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the Taipei 101 skyscraper -- currently the tallest
building in the world -- will also be included in the publicity
campaign, with the hope of underscoring the ambition of Taiwan and
its relentless efforts toward new peaks.
</P>
<P>
The ads will be placed in subway stations and local newspapers in
Santiago, Lin said.
</P>
<P>
During the ceremony, a 14-minute film to introduce the nation,
titled "Taiwan -- Where Mountains Meet the Sea, " made its debut,
which Lin said would serve as the forerunner of the nation's drive to
promote high-definition digital TV with "completely digital by 2010"
as the ultimate goal.
</P>
<P>
He also announced the kicking off of an international publicity
drive to promote Taiwan strategically, including the unveiling of the
CIS (corporate identity system), slogan, and the launching of a
national image Web page at the end of the year. In addition, there
will be six advertisements published in international newspapers and
magazines between February and June 2005, he said.
</P>
<P>
The GIO will also prepare four commercials to be aired on CNN,
ABC and BBC, as well as conduct public surveys in the United States,
Europe, Japan and Southeast Asia and promote Taiwan according to the
survey results in the various regions, Lin said.

TAIWAN HAS SUPPORT TO JOIN SUB-GROUP OF WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Geneva,  Nov.  10 (CNA)
(By C.H. Lu and P.C. Tang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taiwan's bid to enter the World Health
Organization's International Health Regulations (IHR) has the support
of several of its diplomatic allies, the United States and other
countries, although mainland China still opposes the island's
inclusion.
</P>
<P>
WHO member states are currently in a two-week inter-governmental
session that began Nov. 1 to revise the IHR. The hope is to bring the
regulations up to date and increase controls on the international
spread of infectious diseases.
</P>
<P>
During the first few days of the meetings, both Taiwan's allies
and the United States voiced "implied support" for Taiwan's inclusion
in the world health community and in the IHR after revisions to the
regulations.
</P>
<P>
A health source in Geneva has said that Nicaragua delegates to
the meetings proposed to revise Article 65 of the current IHR
regulations related to the participation of non-members of the WHO,
saying that the article should include those territories that have the
ability to add to the knowledge pool in health-related matters and that
can take on IHR affairs in the same manner as official WHO members.
</P>
<P>
The proposal was supported by 16 of the Republic of China on
Taiwan's diplomatic allies. The United States also sided with Taiwan.
The 25-member European Union and Canada emphasized the principle of
universality, although they did not make public their stance on the
proposal.
</P>
<P>
However, mainland China and its supporters strongly opposed
Nicaragua's proposal at the meetings, pointing out that the territory's
concept does not have the proper legal status to join since the WHO is
an inter-governmental organization and the IHR is a convention among
nations.
</P>
<P>
The differences between the two camps on the proposal could not
be resolved during the meetings, so the chairman of the panel
discussions decided Wednesday to shelve the issue pending future
discussions.
</P>
<P>
Shen Lyu-shun, director of the Taipei Economic and Cultural
Office in Geneva, said that the development at the meetings is
encouraging and that many countries have paid heed to the principle
of universality, which Taiwan has always emphasized.
</P>
<P>
Analyzing views expressed by WHO members at the meetings, he said
that 42 members voiced their support for Taiwan's bid to be included
in the IHR, while only 16 members backed mainland China's stance,
demonstrating that "the justification and necessity" of the bid
cannot be denied.
</P>
<P>
Shen also said that there is room for Taiwan to make further
efforts to push for its inclusion in the IHR, adding that no WHO
member can unilaterally deny Taiwan's bid to be included in the IHR
because the issue has drawn attention from many WHO members.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan has failed to become an observer of the WHA, the WHO's
highest decision-making body, despite years of efforts.
</P>
<P>
It is expected that WHO members will hold additional meetings
next year to further discuss the IHR revisions.

Chun-hsiung as "the next speaker of the Legislative Yuan" Thursday at
a campaign event and appealed for the nation's support to make the DPP
the majority party after the Dec. 11 legislative elections.
</P>
<P>
On the first stop of a tour to promote candidates in his capacity
as DPP chairman, President Chen said that only when the DPP becomes
the majority in the legislature and the Legislative Yuan speaker is a
DPP member can the administration have a free hand to answer its
calling.
</P>
<P>
Chen began the DPP campaigning at Taipei's Lungshan Temple by
offering incense to call for a landslide victory for the ruling DPP
in the upcoming legislative elections.
</P>
<P>
Chen said that he will attend all 50 campaign events scheduled
during the next 30 days to back the DPP's candidates.
</P>
<P>
The DPP is fielding 10 candidates in Taipei City, an area of
intense competition.
</P>
<P>
Chang Chun-hsiung, formerly a premier after serving as a DPP
legislator for six terms, has been tapped to be a DPP
legislator-at-large candidate. He is ranked first on a list of
at-large candidates.
</P>
<P>
In a brief interview with the Central News Agency, Chang
disclosed that President Chen talked to him in July about the
feasibility of his being elected speaker of the next legislature.
</P>
<P>
Chang said he has taken up the task with honor and will try his
utmost to enable the DPP to win up to 100 seats in the 225-seat
legislature, and along with its ally the Taiwan Solidarity Union,
hold over 50 percent of the seats.
</P>
<P>
Once he is elected speaker, Chang said, he will first work to
have the Legislative Yuan's notorious "black-gold" (violence and
corruption) umbrella removed to restore the dignity and image of the
nation's legislative system.

VICE PRESIDENT URGES SECOND  WAVE OF 'MOVING EASTWARD' POLICY
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Nov.  11 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Vice President Annette Lu urged Taiwan's
industrial sector to embark on a "second-wave of moving eastward, "
and this time eyeing the whole world.
</P>
<P>
Lu made the remarks when she addressed the 58th Industry Day
celebrations sponsored by the Chinese National Federation of
Industries.
</P>
<P>
The vice president said that thanks to the efforts of the
industry, Taiwan has weathered economic sluggishness and created
economic growth again in a few years, showing that though "Taiwan is
small geographically, it can still shine globally."
</P>
<P>
She said that between the 1970s and the 1990s, Taiwan was
promoting an "eastward" policy, seeking development in Europe and the
United States.
</P>
<P>
But since the 1990s, cross-strait relations have become too close
with Taiwan investors flocking westwards toward mainland China, she
said. Though both sides share the same language and same culture, the
exchanges are actually bad for Taiwan, citing the example of the
hollowing-out of Taiwan industrial sector.
</P>
<P>
Also, though there are advantages in investing on the mainland,
there are potential problems such as the unstable society, Beijing's
animosity toward Taiwan and missiles targeting the island, Lu said.
</P>
<P>
She urged people to think twice before jumping on the investment
wagon on the mainland, saying that at a time of globalization, Taiwan
needs to embark on a second wave of moving eastward -- targeting the
world this time.
</P>
<P>
The vice president, who is scheduled to visit Latin America next
February, also took the opportunity to invite industrial leaders to
go with her to inspect the investment environment there.

OPPOSITION LUKEWARM OVER PRESIDENT'S LATEST CROSS-STRAIT OVERTURE
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei, Nov. 11 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The opposition Kuomintang (KMT) gave a cool
reception to President Chen Shui-bian's latest peace overture to
mainland China.
</P>
<P>
President Chen elaborated on 10 points at a meeting Wednesday
with his senior advisors, which included the call for the creation of
a cross-strait military buffer zone, the promise of not developing
weapons of mass destruction, and establishing a military consultation
mechanism that would lead to the creation of a cross-strait "code of
conduct."
</P>
<P>
Huang Teh-fu, KMT whip in the Legislative Yuan called the 10
points "just another of many election gambits" of the president.
</P>
<P>
Huang noted that since the president invariably extends an olive
branch to China before elections, but acts differently afterward, the
KMT "will now listen to his words and observe his deeds."
</P>
<P>
He noted that President Chen has advocated "one country on each
side of the Taiwan Strait, " writing a new constitution, and joining
hands with the opposition to form a committee for cross-strait peace
and development, but at the same time has lashed out at the
opposition for buying into mainland China's rhetoric.
</P>
<P>
"President Chen is playing a double-handed strategy to win votes
in the Dec. 11 legislative elections," Huang said.
</P>
<P>
Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou said that President Chen's advocacy of
establishing a cross-strait military consultation mechanism is "not a
bad idea."
</P>
<P>
However, to resolve cross-strait disputes, the president
shouldn't be in a rush to take action before the year-end elections,
but should display a persistent sincerity in striving for an
improvement in cross-strait relations.
</P>
<P>
The president's idea "might not be very feasible" at the moment,
the mayor said, adding that President Chen should first display
enough sincerity over a longer period of time, and then extend his
goodwill in a gradual manner.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, James Soong, chairman of the People First Party (PFP),
commenting on President Chen's proposal that he would organize a
cross-strait peace and development committee after the
legislative elections and could invite an opposition leader to head
the committee, said that this statement was made due to pressure from
the United States.
</P>
<P>
Soong criticized President Chen for "wavering" and for doing
differently from what he said earlier, pointing out that President
Chen advocated writing a new constitution only recently, and is now
advocating a cross-strait peace and development committee.
</P>
<P>
If the president is indeed sincere, he should support a
cross-strait peaceful development bill proposed by the PFP, Soong
said.
</P>
<P>
The Taiwan Solidarity Union, an ally of the ruling DPP, said that
cross-strait relations should be based on equality, reciprocity,
security and dignity, especially the establishment of a military
buffer zone, which must be based on mutual trust. If the development
of cross-strait relations violates these four principles, the TSU
will vehemently oppose it.
</P>
<P>
TSU Legislator Chen Chien-ming also said that the TSU will not
oppose the idea of an opposition leader serving as the head of the
proposed cross-strait peace committee, but the premise must be that
the "pan- green camp" of the DPP and the TSU will hold over half of
the 225 seats in the new legislature after the elections.

GENOME-BASED RESEARCH TO SPUR FRESH TECHNO REVOLUTION: PRESIDENT
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei, Nov. 11 (CNA)
(By Y.F. Low)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Genome-based biotechnological research will
be the prime mover for a fresh round of technological innovation and
economic development for Taiwan in the 21st century, President Chen
Shui-bian said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the opening of the Genomics Research Center (GRC)
building of the Academia Sinica, Chen pointed out that the booming
semiconductor, IT and imaging industries in Taiwan have boosted the
island's technological development and economic growth over the past
two decades.
</P>
<P>
"In the 21st century, genome-based biotechnological research will
play a crucial role in motivating the next technological revolution
and economic growth in Taiwan," Chen said.
</P>
<P>
Chen said the opening of the GRC building symbolizes a major
advance for Taiwan in the field of life science research.
</P>
<P>
The GRC and the top-end research team of the Academia Sinica will
become the "bullet train" of Taiwan's biotechnology sector, which
will fuel the momentum of Taiwan's development and steer the
country's biotechnology sector toward the leading position in the
world, Chen said.
</P>
<P>
The GRC is one of the core projects in the "national-level
genomic medicine program" launched by the government in 2002 and will
provide a technological platform for Taiwan's biotechnology industry,
Chen noted.
</P>
<P>
The establishment of the GRC will also help the government
achieve the goals of attracting investment worth NT$150 billion
(US$4.54 billion) in the sector in five years, seeing the founding of
at least 500 biotech firms in 10 years, and developing Taiwan into
the Asia-Pacific hub for bio-tech venture investment, research and
development and operations, he added.
</P>
<P>
The GRC was founded in January 2003 and comprises such research
areas as functional genomics, chemical biology, cellular and
molecular medicine, and bioinformatics.

MAC CHIEF EXPOUNDS ON  'HK FORMULA' FOR CHARTER FLIGHT TALKS
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Nov.  11 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) Chairman
Joseph Wu expounded on the formula used in signing the
Taiwan-Hong Kong aviation agreement in June 2002 in preparation for
negotiations on the opening of direct cross-Taiwan Strait charter
cargo flights and Chinese New Year charter passenger flights.
</P>
<P>
Wu said the formula implies three basic principles -- shelving
disputes without imposing any premises or prerequisites; resolving
issues with mutual respect and pragmatism; being guided by the
governments while enlisting private-sector assistance.
</P>
<P>
Wu's explanations came a day after President Chen Shui-bian
directed relevant government agencies to actively promote the
resumption of dialogue with Beijing on the basis of the bilateral
meetings in Hong Kong in 1992. At the beginning, Chen went on, the
two sides can negotiate the opening of two-way, non-stop cross-strait
charter cargo flights and Chinese New Year charter passenger flights
in line with the formula set forth in the 2002 Taiwan-Hong Kong
aviation pact negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Under the formula, the Republic of China government authorized a
non-governmental airline association to negotiate the aviation pact
with Hong Kong, with officials from the MAC and the Civil Aeronautics
Administration joining the talks as advisers to the association.
</P>
<P>
Wu said the MAC and other government agencies will follow the
above-mentioned principles in pushing for opening of two-way,
non-stop cross-strait charter cargo flights and charter passenger
flights for the upcoming Chinese New Year holiday, which will run
from Fe. 6, 2005 through Feb. 13.
</P>
<P>
The nation's top mainland policy planner further said the MAC
will organize a seminar on cross-strait charter flight issues Friday,
with the participation of government officials and industry
executives.
</P>
<P>
"The seminar will serve as a platform for the government to
exchange views with relevant industry representatives on direct
cross-strait charter flight issues, " Wu said, adding that MAC Vice
Chairman Chiu Tai-san will brief the press on technical details after
the seminar.
</P>
<P>
Two mainland Chinese officials -- Li Xiaoyun, director of the
Cross-Strait Economic and Technological Exchange Center under
mainland China's Taiwan Affairs Office, and Feng Chuozhe, president
of Beijing's state-run Cross-Strait Travel Service, arrived in Taipei
Wednesday for a private visit.
</P>
<P>
Reporters had speculated that Li and Feng are visiting Taiwan to
discuss issues regarding the opening of direct cross-strait charter
passenger flights during the upcoming Chinese New Year holiday, as
well as the opening of Taiwan to mainland Chinese tourists.
</P>
<P>
However, MAC officials said they have no plan for a meeting with
the two mainland officials.
</P>
<P>
"We have no knowledge whether the two were authorized by Beijing
to negotiate with Taiwan on possible cross-strait charter flights
during the forthcoming Chinese New Year holiday and no meeting with
the two has been scheduled, " MAC Vice Chairman Chiu said.
</P>
<P>
With Beijing's consent, Taiwan carriers operated special charter
flights between Shanghai and Taipei/Kaohsiung via Hong Kong/Macau
during the 2003 Chinese New Year period. The services were not
offered during the 2004 Chinese New Year holiday because Beijing
insisted that mainland carriers be allowed to also provide the same
flight services while declining to negotiate the necessary technical
details with Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
The ROC government said that as the opening of two-way, non-stop
cross-strait charter flight services involves the exercise of public
authority, prior negotiations are necessary.

ONE OUT OF EVERY 3.7 PERSONS IN TAIWAN IS HAKKA: POLL
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Nov.  11 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
One out of every 3.7 people in Taiwan is
Hakka or of Hakka origin, constituting 26.9 percent of the entire
Taiwan population, the Cabinet-level Council for Hakka Affairs quoted
a recent survey as indicating Thursday.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference publicizing the results of the latest
census survey that the Council for Hakka Affairs has consigned a
private poll company to conduct in recent months, council Chairman Lo
Wen-chia said that the power of Hakka people in Taiwan is too big to
be ignored.
</P>
<P>
Also speaking at the same occasion, Vice Premier Yeh Chu-lan,
herself a Hakka, said that the Hakka people are full of hope.
</P>
<P>
Lo said that there had not been a precise census of the number of
the Hakka population in Taiwan before this survey.
</P>
<P>
Formerly, Lo said, it was reported by authorities that Taiwan had
about 2.86 million Hakka people. But after conducting the survey this
year of residents from 368 cities, counties and townships nationwide,
it was found that the number of Hakka people and people of Hakka
origin in Taiwan totals 6.08 million, representing 26.9 percent of
the country's entire population, he added.
</P>
<P>
According to the survey, about 1.66 million people in Taiwan who
have Hakka origin had not been considered as Hakkas. Of these people,
many cannot speak any Hakka dialect.
</P>
<P>
Some 42.5 percent of the respondents said that only those people
who are of Hakka origin and can speak Hakka dialect can be considered
as Hakkas.
</P>
<P>
In addition, 85 percent of the Hakka people think that their
mother tongue has increasingly lost ground in Taiwan due to a variety
of reasons. About 72 percent of the Hakka people said they are proud
to be Hakkas, although 46 percent of the Hakka people said that they
would not take the initiative to tell their ethnical origin without
prompting.
</P>
<P>
Hakka people, whose ancestors originated from central China more
than 1,000 years ago, have been scattering around the world since the
early 19th century due to their trademark characteristics of
hard-work and perseverance.
</P>
<P>
Last year, three top political leaders in Taiwan discovered that
they all have Hakka ancestors from the same area in today's Zhaoan
County in the mainland Chinese province of Fujian.
</P>
<P>
After a series of activities heralding Hakka culture, President
Chen Shui-bian had his ancestry traced back to the village of Baiye
in Taiping Township, Zhaoan County.
</P>
<P>
According to the Chen clan family tree records, President Chen is
a descendant of the first official dispatched by the Tang emperor to
explore the southern lands during the Tang Dynasty (618-907 A.D.).
</P>
<P>
President Chen is the ninth generation offspring of Chen Wu
(1739-1796) , the first Chen ancestor to cross the Taiwan Strait and
settle in Taiwan, according to the Chen family tree.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Vice President Annette Lu said in January 2003 that
she is half Hakka as her ancestors on her mother's side came from
Zhaoan, which is a well-known Hakka area. "Hakka" means "the guest
people" in Mandarin Chinese.
</P>
<P>
The Hakka people were so defined during the Yuan Dynasty
(1277-1367) when residents from central and north-central China fled
to the south to escape famine and calamity.
</P>
<P>
Premier Yu Shyi-kun's ancestors have been traced to a village
only some 12 kilometers from where the president's ancestors resided.

TAIWAN'S ECONOMIC GROWTH LIKELY TO TOP 6% IN 2004: ECONOMICS MINISTER
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei, Nov. 11 (CNA)
(By Y.F. Low)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taiwan is likely to post economic growth of
more than 6 percent this year as the economy continues to recover
vigorously, Minister of Economic Affairs Ho Mei-yueh predicted
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Ho made the forecast while delivering a keynote speech on
"environmental trends and challenges faced by Taiwan's economy"
during a seminar for small- and medium-sized businesses held in
Taichung.
</P>
<P>
With the global economy revitalizing noticeably, the volume of
global trade is expanding and sustaining the strong economic growth
in the United States, Europe and Japan, Ho pointed out.
</P>
<P>
The economic recovery in Japan has also motivated regional growth
in Asia including Taiwan, Ho said.
</P>
<P>
While the latest economic forecast released by the Taiwan
Institute of Economic Research shows that the country's economic
growth could reach 5.9 percent this year, it is likely that the
economy could perform even better and see a growth rate of over 6
percent, Ho said.
</P>
<P>
Export volume, meanwhile, is expected to hit a new high and
amount to more than US$160 billion this year, she said.
</P>
<P>
Exports in the first 10 months to October have reached US$143.67
billion, which is close to the record high of US$148 billion
registered in 2000, Ho noted.
</P>
<P>
She said small- and medium-sized businesses have always been an
uplifting force in the development of Taiwan's economy and are now
pushing Taiwan's industries toward higher performance.
</P>
<P>
To cope with the advent of the digital and knowledge-based
segments of the economy, small- and medium-sized businesses need to
adjust their marketing and operational models and enhance their
research and development and innovation capabilities to break through
the bottleneck of industrial development, Ho said.
</P>
<P>
The minister said Taiwan must continue to boost the development
of such sectors as biomedics, wireless broadband networking, energy
recycling, automobile parts and components, nanotechnology and
knowledge-intensive services to maintain its international
competitiveness.

Minister of the Education Tu Cheng-sheng on

The education minister, himself an historian, noted that Taiwan
was originally a pluralistic society, but under the rule of China
since the Qing dynasty, it has formed a "single culture mentality, "
in believing that only Chinese culture is "the orthodox one, " and
didn't respect people from other cultures.

<P>
The majority of people in Taiwan think the
government's NT$610.8 billion (US$18.23 billion) arms procurement
from the United States is too expensive, and nearly 50 percent of the
people believe the amount should be cut at least by half, according
to the results of a survey released Thursday by the opposition
Kuomintang (KMT).
</P>
<P>
The survey was conducted by a private poll company at the KMT's
commission from Nov. 5-6 on 1,073 people. It has a margin of error of
2.99 percent.
</P>
<P>
The results showed that 54.2 percent of the respondents think the
amount of the procurement is too high, compared with 1.6 percent who
think it is too low and 19.2 percent who think it is moderate. The
remaining 25.1 percent said they have no opinion.
</P>
<P>
While 44.8 percent of the respondents agreed to the KMT's
proposal to cut the amount by at least NT$300 billion, 29.7 percent
disagreed, and 25.5 percent did not express any opinion.
</P>
<P>
Those who believe the amount should be slashed by more than
NT$300 billion account for 36.1 percent, and 10.3 percent believe it
should be reduced by less than NT$300 billion. The rest had no
opinion.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, 23.5 percent of the respondents said the procurement
budget should be removed completely, but 65.1 percent disagreed and
11.5 percent expressed no opinion.

DIALOGUE NEEDED TO SOLVE CROSS-STRAIT DISPUTES: INDIAN EX-MINISTER
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Taipei, Nov. 11 (CAN) Former Indian Defense Minister George
Fernandes sees cross-Taiwan Straits disputes basically as political
issues that need to be solved through dialogue. He added that India
has no role to play in this process.
</P>
<P>
Fernandes, who arrived in Taipei Thursday for a three-day visit,
said in an interview with CNA that any discussion of military
cooperation between India and Taiwan is "not on the agenda, "
dispelling Beijing's fears that his visit will lead to some sort of
strategic cooperation between the island and his country.
</P>
<P>
There are three feasible areas of cooperation, though, among
India, Taiwan and Japan, he said. He noted the three countries can
form a "strategic alliance" in technological development, in addition
to economic and cultural exchanges.

Fernandes, in his capacity as India's defense minister, visited
China during the SARS outbreak last year. After meeting with top
Chinese leaders, including Prime Minister Wen Jiabao, he found that
economic development was China's top interest.
</P>
<P>
"They have a mission -- to become the No. 1 economy of the world
by the year 2020, " he said, and the Chinese are "working in a very
organized manner in that direction."

After stepping down from his Cabinet post in May, Fernandes, 74,

LARGE HAUL OF KETAMINE HIDDEN IN DVD PLAYERS SEIZED
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Nov. 11 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A man was arrested Thursday on charges of
smuggling 10 kg of ketamine into Taiwan from Malaysia by concealing
the drug in DVD players.
</P>
<P>
The man, identified as Hsieh Chung, was intercepted by law
enforcement officers near the Tucheng intersection on the second
freeway in northern Taiwan after he claimed the drugs from customs
authorities at Chiang Kai-shek (CKS) International Airport early in
the morning.
</P>
<P>
The ketamine, which was wrapped in aluminum foil or carbon paper
and then hidden in five "hollowed-out" DVD players, was delivered to
CKS the previous evening.
</P>
<P>
Law enforcement officers uncovered the drug, worth an estimated
NT$25 million in street value, and the five DVD players on Hsieh's
car.
</P>
<P>
Aviation police said it marked the first time that contraband
drugs have been delivered in such a way in an attempt to foil the
airport inspection instruments.
</P>
<P>
Acting on a tipoff from intelligence sources, police said they
had formed a surveillance team prior to the arrival of the drug. They
added that they will track down Hsieh's accomplices, who were still
at large.

AVERAGE MONTHLY SALARY DOWN 5% FROM LAST YEAR: SURVEY
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Nov.  11 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
People in Taiwan with five years of work
experience receive an average salary of NT$30,207 (US$915) per month,
down 5 percent from the same period last year, according to a survey
unveiled Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The survey was conducted by www.1111.com.tw, an online human
resources company via e-mail questionnaires, which gathered 5,217
effective samples with a margin of error of 1.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
The survey targeted those who have worked for five years and aged
around 30, with the result showing that they receive a monthly
payment of NT$30,207 on average, compared with a similar survey last
year that showed NT$31,802 on average.
</P>
<P>
Yet, over half of those surveyed said that they could accept
their current salary level, the poll found.
</P>
<P>
Although the average salary fell slightly, some sectors showed
differing results, the survey said.
</P>
<P>
Average payments for those in industry and business counseling
increased to NT$34,498 from NT$28,897 last year. Those who are in the
tourism service sector, which the government has actively promoted in
recent years, also have higher pay, with those in the restaurant,
tourism and entertainment sectors receiving an average payment of
NT$27,120 per month, an increase from NT$26,291 last year.
</P>
<P>
Officials from the online company said that lower unemployment
rates have to do with job opportunities released by the government in
the public service sector, which does not necessarily mean that the
economy is recovering.
</P>
<P>
From the perspective of the business operators, even if the
economy has rebounded, they are adopting a more conservative
approach, the officials said, adding that overall, the wage structure
is showing a downward adjustment trend.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the survey also found that wages for men are about 1.3
times those for women, with men receiving average monthly pay of
NT$34,544, compared with the average monthly pay of NT$26,517 for
women.
</P>
<P>
With more people pursuing advanced studies, the survey also found
that those who have higher degrees do receive higher pay.
</P>
<P>
The average monthly pay for those with college degrees is
NT$30,389, while those who have masters degrees get NT$46,576 per
month, and those who have doctoral degrees receive NT$78,931 on
average, or 2.6 times the salary of college graduates. Comparatively,
those who have only a high school education can only manage NT$25,865
per month.

MND DENIES MAINLAND CHINA INTERFERED WITH PRESIDENTIAL FLIGHT
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Nov.  11 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Ministry of National Defense (MND)
denied a newspaper report Thursday that mainland Chinese jet fighters
locked their radar on a plane carrying President Chen Shui-bian
during a flight over the Taiwan Strait in late September.
</P>
<P>
"The report is not factual, " the Office of Military Spokesman
said in a press statement.
</P>
<P>
The report in a Chinese-language daily claimed that Chen's flight
from Taipei to the outlying island of Penghu Sept. 27 was temporarily
diverted because 28 mainland jet fighters were spotted in the area.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, the mainland warplanes, including
Russian-made Sukhoi-27s and Sukhoi-30s, approached the sensitive
center line of the 160 km-wide Taiwan Strait that separates Taiwan
from mainland China. Chen's "Air Force One" pilots then altered their
flight path to avoid the mainland jets, delaying Chen's arrival on
Penghu by 15 minutes.
</P>
<P>
A similar incident occurred Oct. 2 when Vice President Annette Lu
was flying to Penghu, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
The MND press statement said that mainland warplanes conducted
training drills in airspace 11 nautical miles west of the center line
of the Taiwan Strait on the morning of Sept. 27. By the time Chen
flew to Penghu for an inspection tour that afternoon, the statement
said, no mainland warplanes were spotted throughout the flight.
</P>
<P>
The statement also denied that mainland jet fighters were spotted
during Lu's Oct. 2 flight to Penghu, saying that no mainland
warplanes conducted training exercises or patrol missions near the
demarcation line that day.
</P>
<P>
The statement further said the MND has consistently kept close
tabs on mainland military activities.
</P>
<P>
The air force has also worked out comprehensive regulations to
protect the top government leaders' flight safety, the press
statement stressed.
</P>
<P>
The report came a day after Chen urged Beijing to agree to the
creation of a military buffer zone -- an area that military aircraft
and warships from both sides of the Taiwan Strait would not be
allowed to enter. Chen also called for the formulation of a code of
conduct so that their militaries can avoid incidents that could
trigger a conflict as well as the establishment of a failsafe
communications channel to avoid military miscalculations from either
side.
</P>
<P>
Chen made the appeals at the end of a high-level national
security meeting to discuss measures to cope with the delicate
triangular Taipei-Washington-Beijing relations in the wake of the
U.S. presidential election as well as how to kick-start the
long-stalled dialogue across the Taiwan Strait and promote
cross-strait engagements on an equal and reciprocal basis.

CHINA'S ADVANCE TOWARD 'SECOND ISLAND CHAIN' INEVITABLE: LAWMAKERS
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Nov.  11 (CNA)
(By Y.F. Low)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It is an "inevitable trend" that the
mainland Chinese navy might advance toward the "second island chain"
after breaking through the first, as it is developing itself into a
pelagic force from a coastal one, legislators said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
They were commenting on reports that a suspected mainland nuclear
submarine entered Japan's territorial waters Wednesday near Okinawa's
Sakishima island chain, which lies close to the disputed Tiaoyutai
islands.
</P>
<P>
Some analysts say the move, if true, would mean the mainland's
breakthrough of the "first island chain, " which refers to the
defense line made up of Japan, Okinawa, Taiwan and the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
The "second island chain" refers to the defense line linking
Japan and Guam.
</P>
<P>
Ruling Democratic Progressive Party Legislator Lee Wen-chung, who
heads the Legislative Yuan's National Defense Committee, said it is a
long-term strategic goal of the mainland to continue to attempt to
break through the "second island chain" while it modernizes its navy
in the direction of building up its pelagic defense capabilities.
</P>
<P>
As an outpost of the defense lines formed by the United
States-Japan military alliance, the Taiwan Strait is also one of the
main points the mainland is trying to break through, according to
Lee.
</P>
<P>
He claimed that Taiwan and the United States now maintain what he
called a "quasi-military alliance" relationship and will work more
closely in the future.
</P>
<P>
This is the reason why the Taiwan Strait has been included in the
U.S.-Japan security treaty and why the United States has supplied
defensive weapons to Taiwan, Lee said.
</P>
<P>
Opposition People First Party Legislator Lin Yu-fang, another
member of the committee, said it is difficult to determine if the
submarine belongs to the mainland because a number of countries have
sent submarines to the area.
</P>
<P>
Lin said it is an unavoidable development for the mainland to
become a superpower, but he said this does not necessarily mean the
mainland will attack Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
By claiming to be a member of the U.S.-Japan military alliance
and even engaging in an arms race with the mainland, Taiwan is likely
to provoke Beijing and accelerate the outbreak of a war across the
Taiwan Strait, Lin warned.

NO CHANGE IN ROC-VANUATU DIPLOMATIC TIES: MOFA
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Nov. 11 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Diplomatic relations between the Republic
of China and the South Pacific island nation of Vanuatu remain
unchanged, a Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) official said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
MOFA spokesman Michel Lu made the remarks after mainland Chinese
Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Zhang Qiyue claimed at a news conference
earlier in the day that Vanuatu's Cabinet "has made the decision to
revoke the so-called communique on the establishment of diplomatic
relations between Vanuatu and Taiwan."
</P>
<P>
Zhang's claim does not represent the Vanuatu government's stance,
Lu said, adding that Vanuatu Prime Minister Serge Vohor sent a
message to the MOFA Tuesday reaffirming the validity of the joint
communique he signed with Minister of Foreign Affairs Tan Sun Chen in
Taipei Nov. 3 on the establishment of full-fledged diplomatic ties
between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
"Vohor assured us in his letter that he had singed the communique
on behalf of the Vanuatu government and people," Lu said.
</P>
<P>
Through MOFA's verification, Lu said, the mainland spokeswoman's
claim was not based on any announcement issued by the Vanuatu
government.
</P>
<P>
Lu said Vohor did not attend Wednesday's Cabinet meeting because
he is not in Vanuatu's capital. "He is staying in his home town on an
outlying island, and Wednesday's meeting was chaired by Vanuatu's
deputy prime minister," Lu said.
</P>
<P>
According to Lu, Vohor telephoned the MOFA earlier in the day to
say that some members of his Cabinet have differing opinions on his
decision to switch diplomatic recognition from Beijing to Taipei.
"But Vohor assured us that he will continue to communicate with them
in order to win their support for his decision," Lu explained.
</P>
<P>
He further said the Vanuatu Cabinet mainly discussed budget
issues at Wednesday's meeting. "Although the Vanuatu Cabinet did
discuss issues regarding the establishment of diplomatic ties with
the ROC, it remained unclear whether any conclusion had been reached
at the meeting. The MOFA is still trying to get a better
understanding of relevant developments," he added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Chen said he understands that Beijing will try every
possible means to force Vanuatu to revoke its diplomatic ties with
the ROC.
</P>
<P>
"Nevertheless, we are confident that our ties with Vanuatu will
not change. Vohor has repeatedly assured us that his government will
uphold its commitment to Taiwan," Chen said.
</P>
<P>
With a population of about 200,000, Vanuatu lies 2,250 km
northeast of Sydney, Australia. It is the ROC's 27th diplomatic ally.

U.S. STATE DEPARTMENT REAFFIRMS NO CHANGE IN 'SIX ASSURANCES'
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Washington,  Nov.  10 (CNA)
(By Oliver Lin and Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The U.S. State Department reaffirmed
Wednesday that its policy and "Six Assurances" toward Taiwan remain
unchanged.
</P>
<P>
State Department Spokesman Richard Boucher was asked during a
daily news briefing about the U.S. position on the status of the 1982
"Six Assurances" on Taiwan policy. "Specifically, is the one
pertaining to sovereignty still valid?" a reporter asked Boucher.
</P>
<P>
Boucher did not answer the question immediately, but written
answers were posted on the State Department Web site that evening.
</P>
<P>
The answer reads: "There is no change in U.S. policy, including
regarding the Six Assurances.
</P>
<P>
"The United States remains firmly committed to our 'one China'
policy, the three joint communiques, and our responsibilities under
the Taiwan Relations Act. We oppose attempts by either side to
unilaterally alter the status quo. We do not support Taiwan
independence.
</P>
<P>
"We have long maintained that differences between the People's
Republic of China and Taiwan are matters to be resolved peacefully,
absent the threat or use of force, and should be acceptable to the
people on both sides of the Taiwan Strait."
</P>
<P>
The Reagan administration offered the "Six Assurances" to Taiwan
after it signed a joint communique Aug. 17, 1982 with mainland China
over issues concerning arms sales to Taiwan. The "Six Assurances"
were conveyed by James Lilley, then-director of the Taipei office of
the American Institute in Taiwan, to then-ROC President Chiang
Ching-kuo in verbal form.
</P>
<P>
The "Six Assurances" include that the United States will not set
a date for ending arms sales to Taiwan, will not hold prior
consultations with Beijing on arms sales to Taiwan, will not play any
mediation role between Taiwan and Beijing, will not revise the Taiwan
Relations Act, will not alter its position regarding sovereignty over
Taiwan, and will not exert pressure on Taiwan to enter into
negotiations with Beijing.

Foreign spouses of Taiwan citizens should
be taught about the dangers of hepatitis B and how to avoid
infection, a hepatologist warned Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Chang Mei-hui, president of the Taiwanese Association for the
Study of Liver Disease, said Taiwan has cut down the prevalence of
Hepatitis B to 1 percent thanks to a program of screening pregnant
women for the disease and a program to inoculate all infants.
</P>
<P>
However, Chang said, most Taiwanese spouses, especially those
from Southeast Asia, where hepatitis B is not as common as in Taiwan,
are ignorant of the disease. They have neither been tested for the
disease nor have they been taught about ways to protect themselves
and their offspring from the disease.
</P>

Chang urged the government to start a program to raise the
awareness of foreign spouses of hepatitis B.

KMT LEGISLATIVE CAMPAIGN FOCUSES ON THREE ISSUES
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,   Nov.  11  (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The opposition Kuomintang's (KMT's)
legislative campaign will focus on the issues of finance, defense and
surveillance of the government, KMT Vice Chairman Wang Jin-pyng said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The KMT candidates will raise the three issues simultaneously
about two or three weeks before election day and will spell out the
party's position on them.
</P>
<P>
One day after President Chen Shui-bian unveiled a plan to cut
down the period of compulsory military service and build trust
between Taiwan and mainland China, Wang said his party will respond
with a new defense policy, the contents of which are still being
studied.
</P>
<P>
Wang said the KMT will train its attack of the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) on finance, which the opposition claims is
worsening under the DPP.
</P>
<P>
Claiming that the DPP has dried up the country's coffers, sold
stocks in state enterprises at a loss and left them in the hands of
unqualified managers, Wang said these have eluded public scrutiny and
should be addressed.
</P>
<P>
Citing a decision made by the Ministry of Education Wednesday to
separate the history of Taiwan from that of mainland China in
textbooks, Wang said it is yet more evidence of the Executive Yuan's
attempt to get around the Legislative Yuan and drives home the
importance of having the legislature controlled by the opposition
when the four other branches of government are controlled by the DPP.
</P>
<P>
Wang said the KMT will come up with a comprehensive position
paper on the three issues in the leadup to the Dec. 11 election.

a draft guideline prepared by the Ministry of Education (MOE) to

textbooks.

Quoting President Chen Shui-bian as saying that the Republic of

there is no question about the fact that the ROC is a sovereign

<P>
As premier, Yu said, he will do his utmost to defend the
sovereignty of the ROC.

As to the MOE's draft guideline, the premier said it is only a

is subject to change after public discussion. He added that the DPP

TAIWAN ENVOY IN HONG KONG CALLS FOR INCREASED EXCHANGES
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Hong Kong,  Nov. 12 (CNA)
(By Lo Kin-fai and Deborah Kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taiwan's representative in Hong Kong on
Friday called for the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region
government to let its staff members visit Taiwan more often to
optimize private exchanges between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
Pao Cheng-kang, who assumed his Hong Kong post Oct. 18, said in
an exclusive interview with the Sing Pao daily that Hong Kong and
Taiwan can foster closer bilateral ties beginning in less-sensitive
areas like the private sector.
</P>
<P>
Visits by lower-ranking Hong Kong civil servants to Taiwan could
be a good start to better mutual understanding between the two sides
and to pave the way for closer ties, said Pao, whose official title
is managing director of the Chung Hwa Travel Service in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Pao reiterated that the mutual trust and genuine desire for
better ties fostered by Hong Kong and Taiwan would lay the groundwork
for closer exchanges between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
In fact, Pao said, Hong Kong and Taiwan benefited from medical
exchanges during the outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome
in early 2003, adding that the fact that it took a shorter period of
time for him to get a work visa from the Hong Kong authorities than
it took his predecessor is an indication that bilateral ties are
improving.
</P>
<P>
Having Hong Kong Chief Executive Tung Chee-hwa visit Taiwan is of
course a distant wish, Pao said, adding that he will nevertheless
work relentlessly toward that goal.
</P>
<P>
Pao was chief secretary of the Cabinet-level Mainland Affairs
Council (MAC) before being appointed Taiwan's representative in Hong
Kong earlier this year. The MAC is the direct supervisory agency in
charge of Chung Hwa Travel Service in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
MAC Vice Chairman Chiu Tai-san has recently called for the Hong
Kong government to seriously consider setting up offices in Taiwan to
promote bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
A Hong Kong office in Taiwan would help provide better services
to the people on both sides of the Taiwan Strait, Chiu said.
</P>
<P>
Noting that more than 230,000 Hong Kong visitors arrived in
Taiwan in the first nine months of this year for sightseeing and
business purposes, Chiu said that the number is nearly equal to that
for the whole of last year, which he said demonstrates that exchanges
between the two sides are increasing rapidly.

U.K. PARLIAMENT PRO-TAIWAN GROUP BIDS FAREWELL TO OUTGOING ROC REP
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
London,  Nov. 11 (CNA)
(By N.K Han and P.C. Tang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Members of the British-Taiwanese All-Party
Parliamentary Group on Thursday bid farewell to outgoing Republic of
China Representative to Britain Tien Hung-mao at a reception held at
the House of Commons.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time that members of the British Parliament
have held a farewell reception at the Parliament for an ROC envoy.
</P>
<P>
In addition to 18 members of Parliament, some 100 dignitaries,
including members of diplomatic corps and international
organizations, local business leaders, think tank experts, scholars,
and leaders from the local Taiwanese community also attended the
gathering.
</P>
<P>
The reception was jointly hosted by the group's co-chairmen,
Thomas Cox and Sir Nicholas Winterton. Martin O'Neill, chairman of
the House of Commons Trade and Industry Committee; Lord Faulkner of
Worcester, vice chairman of the group; and two officials from the
Foreign and Commonwealth Office, Denis Keefe and Rod Wye, also
attended.
</P>
<P>
Praising Tien as an outstanding diplomat, Cox said during the
reception that he and many of his colleagues in Parliament have
always used "ambassador" as a title of respect to address the
outgoing representative.
</P>
<P>
Tien's efforts have further strengthened relations between Taiwan
and Britain, and Taiwan businesspeople's investment in Britain and
the increasing trade exchanges between the two countries have also
created employment opportunities for local people, Cox said, adding
that they will always remember Tien's achievements during his tenure
in London.
</P>
<P>
Sir Winterton also highly lauded Tien as "the most outstanding
ROC representative to Britain" and said that although Taiwan has not
obtained recognition, which he said it deserves to get, Tien has made
the British people better understand that the ROC is a very important
country in the international community and that the island's
democratic development can be regarded as a model for many other
Asian countries.
</P>
<P>
In order to express their respect to Tien, Winterton, on behalf
five leading members of the group, presented a jointly-signed letter
to him, in which they affirmed the representative as "the most
respectable diplomat".
</P>
<P>
In response, Tien expressed his gratitude for the group's
longstanding friendship with Taiwan, saying that the House of Commons
has raised several motions over the past two-and-half years to voice
its support for Taiwan, including affirming Taiwan's democratic
achievements, supporting the island's bid to join the World Health
Organization, and opposing a lifting of the European Union ban on
arms sales to mainland China.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Cox has already raised a motion in the House of
Commons to request that it cite Tien's outstanding performance in
enhancing the relationship between the two countries. The motion has
so far been signed by 54 members of Parliament.

TAIPEI DIABETES DEATHS QUADRUPLE IN 20 YEARS: HEALTH DEPARTMENT
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Nov. 12 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Thirty-six out of every 100,000 residents
in Taipei City died of diabetes mellitus last year, a ratio about
four times higher than that recorded 22 years ago, when the ratio was
nine out of every 100,000, the Taipei Department of Health (TDOH)
reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Diabetes ranked ninth among the 10 leading causes of death in
Taipei City in 1981, but it has surged to fourth place since 1999,
TDOH officials said.
</P>
<P>
According to TDOH tallies, a total of 946 people died of diabetes
in Taipei city in 2003. Of the total, 84 percent were chronic
diabetes patients aged over 65, and 14 percent were people aged
between 45 and 64.
</P>
<P>
Although diabetes affects mainly older people, it is also a
"lifestyle disease, " which can occur due to long-term rich diets and
lack of exercise, the TDOH officials said.
</P>
<P>
Nationwide, a total of 10,013 people died of diabetes last year,
marking a fatality rate of 44.38 out of every 100,000, or about 1.2
times higher than that of Taipei City. The figure would be 1.5 times
if calculated under an age parity structure, in which Taipei City's
diabetes fatality rate was 22.5 out of every 100,000, the officials
said.
</P>
<P>
The ratio is the sixth lowest in the 21 cities and counties
nationwide, only higher than that in Matsu, Kinmen, Taichung City,
Chiayi City and Hsinchu City, in that order.
</P>
<P>
By comparison, Taipei City's diabetes fatality rate of 22.5 out
of every 100,000 is still relatively much higher than Japan's 3.8,
Hong Kong's 8.3 and Singapore's 10, the TDOH officials said.

DPP UNVEILS 10-POINT CAMPAIGN PLATFORM FOR LEGISLATIVE  ELECTIONS
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei, Nov. 12 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The ruling Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) on Friday unveiled a 10-point campaign guidelines for the
year-end legislative elections in a bid to win support for its call
of a clear majority for the "pan-green camp" of the DPP and Taiwan
Solidarity Union (TSU) in the new legislature.
</P>
<P>
DPP heavyweights, including Secretary-General Chang Chun-hsiung,
Vice Secretary-General Chung Chia-pin, Department of Culture and
Information Director Tseng Wen-tsang, as well as Liang Wen-chieh,
chief vice executive director of the Policy Research and Coordinating
Committee, held a press conference to unveil the campaign outline.
</P>
<P>
In the outline, the DPP stresses that if the "pan-green camp" can
obtain half of the seats in the Legislative Yuan in the Dec. 11
elections, then the opposition Kuomintang will not dare to disperse
its "ill-gotten assets, " the umbrella to protect the corrupt "black
gold" politics will be removed, the opposition will not dare to
propose "money-pit" bills, referring to the scores of social welfare
bills totaling NT$1.6 trillion (US$48.48 billion) , the compulsory
military service period will be cut in half, and national security
will be taken care of well.
</P>
<P>
Also, the number of elections in Taiwan as well as the number of
major and minor public functionaries will be cut in half, the
minefield of bad loans will be handled, the financial burden to
families will be cut in half, and there will be no abuse in the
development of national land.
</P>
<P>
DPP Secretary-General Chang noted that 2000 marked the first ever
power transfer between different political parties at the national
level in Taiwan's history. However, he added the transfer has yet to
be completed after five years, mainly because the opposition
"pan-blue alliance" of the Kuomintang and the People First Party
still holds a slight majority in the 225-seat Legislative Yuan.
</P>
<P>
"This is why the DPP will make winning more than half of the
seats in the legislature the main theme in its campaigning so as to
have a complete transfer of power, " Chang said, adding that the DPP
"will then take full responsibility for governing."
</P>
<P>
He noted that since the power transfer in 2000, the opposition
has set its mind on boycotting instead of monitoring, which he said
has resulted in low efficiency in the legislature and difficulties
for the administration.
</P>
<P>
Tsai Huang-liang, DPP caucus whip in the legislature, speaking on
the same occasion, said that the campaign outline is
self-explanatory. In contrast, the opposition has only two focuses in
its campaign, namely the election-eve shooting of President Chen
Shui-bian and opposing President Chen, he added.
</P>
<P>
"They are still in the quagmire of their March 20 presidential
election loss, and they have yet to propose any substantial platform
or outlook for the benefit of the nation and the people," Tsai added.
</P>
<P>
He also expressed worries that if the "pan-green camp" is unable
to win a legislative majority, "it will be the end of Taiwan, "
because "the 'pan-blue alliance' will pass its 'money-pit' bills
which will lead to a collapse of the nation's finances.

VP VOWS IMPARTIALITY IN OMBUDSMEN RECOMMENDATION
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Nov.  12 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Vice President Annette Lu said Friday she
will see to it that the new ombudsmen recommendation panel abides by
the principles of openness, impartiality and fairness in recommending
candidates for the Control Yuan seats.
</P>
<P>
Lu, who concurrently serves as convener of the new ombudsmen
recommendation panel, made the remarks during a luncheon with
incumbent Control Yuan members. Also present were other members of
the recommendation panel.
</P>
<P>
The tenure of the current third-term Control Yuan members will
expire Jan. 31, 2005. President Chen Shui-bian is expected to
nominate 29 fourth-term Control Yuan members later this year.
According to the present version of the Additional Articles of the
Constitution, nominations for the Control Yuan require the consent of
the Legislative Yuan.
</P>
<P>
In addition to appointing Lu as convener of the new ombudsmen
recommendation panel, Chen also named five panelists to screen the
qualifications of hopefuls recommended by various social or academic
groups and come up with a list of qualified aspirants.
</P>
<P>
Noting that times have changed and that the political vision and
ideology of the Democratic Progressive Party administration differs
from the previous Kuomintang (KMT) administration, Lu said the
recommendation panel will take into account "timing factors" in
qualification screening.
</P>
<P>
Equally important is constitutional provisions, Lu said, adding
that the screening panel will faithfully respect the Constitution in
screening and recommending qualified candidates.
</P>
<P>
"We'll make every possible effort to ensure openness,
transparency, impartiality and fairness in the procedure, " Lu said,
adding that the panel's ultimate goal is to recommend those most
qualified and suitable to serve in the Control Yuan, the nation's
supreme watchdog body.
</P>
<P>
Lu further said she hopes the luncheon will provide a forum for
her panelists to exchange views with incumbent Control Yuan members
and thus gain a better understanding of the watchdog body's functions
and its operating rules.
</P>
<P>
"As ombudsmen are responsible for correcting government officials
at all levels and generally monitoring the government, they are often
involved in investigating scandals and graft cases. I think all
incumbent members are fully aware of the social changes, national
evolution and personal traits needed to be a competent and
outstanding ombudsman, " Lu said, adding that she welcomes the advice
and opinions of the incumbent ombudsmen for the panel's reference.
</P>
<P>
As to how many incumbents will be recommended for another term,
Lu said the panel has yet to consider this issue.
</P>
<P>
During the KMT era, a certain percentage of incumbents were
retained for a second six-year term. The incumbent ombudsmen took
office Feb. 1, 1999 when the KMT was still in power. With the DPP
winning the presidency in 2000 and again in 2004, Lu said, the nation
has entered a new era. "We could use a broader perspective in mulling
the issue," she added.
</P>
<P>
Members of the panel include incumbent Control Yuan President
Fredrick Chien and Presidential Office Secretary-General Su
Tseng-chang, as well as Chang Chien-pang, a senior adviser to the
president, Hsiao Hsin-huang, a national policy adviser to the
president, and Nita Ing, chairwoman of Taiwan High-Speed Railway, who
is also an adviser to the president. Chien has made clear that he
will retire from public service after his current tenure expires.

CORAL SOCIETY APPEALS FOR REMOVAL OF SHIP WRECKAGE
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei, Nov. 12 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Members of the Taiwanese Coral Reef Society
environmental group appealed yet again Friday to government agencies
not to let the "Amorgos" pollution case go any further and see to it
that the undersea wreckage is removed at the earliest possible date.
</P>
<P>
Wreckage of the Amorgos, a Greek freighter that ran aground and
sank off the coast of Kenting at the southernmost tip of Taiwan Jan.
14, 2001, is now "a slaughter hell" for coral in an area of Lungkeng
off Kenting, said Cheng Ming-hsiu, Society chairman and a researcher
with Academia Sinica's Institute of Zoology.
</P>
<P>
Since the freighter's sinking, its wreckage has continued to
impair the growth of coral because of the sharp metal edges of the
wreck, turning the area into a coral graveyard, Cheng claimed.
</P>
<P>
He added that after a series of observations, it has been found
that in a 2 km by 500 meter coral reef area near Lungkeng, Kenting,
coral coverage rate has continued to drop.
</P>
<P>
Contrary to previous speculation that the freighter's wreckage
could become an undersea artificial fishery reef, he said, the ship
has disintegrated in the strong currents and its debris has continued
to spread, posing increasing threats to the coral.
</P>
<P>
The harmful debris will not disappear by itself and it cannot be
"digested" by the sea, Cheng argued, adding that the only option is
to have it removed before more coral, the ecological system and
Taiwan's tourism resources are further compromised.
</P>
<P>
A similar situation has been found in an undersea area to the
east of Green Island, where the freighter Picasso sank 12 years ago,
Cheng said.
</P>
<P>
By comparison, he said, coral reefs near Penghu Island are found
to be the most healthy, with coral coverage rate totaling nearly 100
percent.
</P>
<P>
The Amorgos, carrying 60,000 tons of iron ore, was heading for
Nantong in mainland China from Singapore when it developed mechanical
problems and began to drift. It ran aground 1.6 km off the coast of
Oluanpi, Taiwan's southernmost tip, before sinking.
</P>
<P>
All 25 crew members were rescued, but the ship later broke in two
and an estimated 1,150 tons of fuel oil gushed out of the vessel and
blanketed coral reefs in the Oluanpi area.
</P>
<P>
The oil spill has blanketed coral reefs in the Oluanpi area,
causing an ecological disaster that will take the sensitive ecosystem
years from which to recover.
</P>
<P>
At least three officials were disciplined due to aftermath of
that incident.

AMPLE ROOM  FOR TAIWAN, INDIA TO IMPROVE POLITICAL TIES
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei, Nov. 12 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There is ample room for Taiwan and India to
bolster their political relations from a long-term perspective, a
former Indian government adviser said in Taipei Friday.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Jagdish Shettigar, a leading economics and finance adviser to
India's former BJP coalition government, suggested at a seminar that
the authorities from the two countries begin with economic exchanges
to eventually draw themselves together politically.
</P>
<P>
Noting that two-way trade between Taiwan and India totaled around
US$1 billion in 2003, Shettigar said trade is expected to top US$2
billion this year, with the two countries' exchanges in information
technology industry increasing by leaps and bounds.
</P>
<P>
He analyzed that high technology, the IT industry and food
processing industry are the three most promising areas for Taiwan and
India to further expand their cooperation in years to come.
</P>
<P>
Shettigar also expressed his hope that when thinking about
relocating investment or business operations overseas, Taiwan
investors should give India and Indian business partners more
consideration.
</P>
<P>
He further pointed out that as both Taiwan and India are members
of the World Trade Organization (WTO), the two countries should make
the most of the WTO platform to optimize their partnership in trade
and investment.
</P>
<P>
"After establishing solid ties and understanding in economy, the
two countries will naturally become closer in political relations, "
Shettigar claimed.

OPPOSITION 'PAN-BLUE ALLIANCE' MARKS SUN YAT-SEN'S BIRTHDAY
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Nov. 12 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The opposition "pan-blue alliance" of the
Kuomintang (KMT) and the People First Party (PFP) paid tribute to Dr.
Sun Yat-sen Friday to mark 139th anniversary of his birth, while a
pro-independence party wanted to draw a line between Taiwan and the
founding father of the Republic of China.
</P>
<P>
KMT Chairman Lien Chan said it is a historical fact that Sun led
the 1911 uprising in Wuchang, leading to the collapse of the Ching
dynasty and the inception of the Republic of China. This historical
fact should not be distorted by the ideology of a few, he said.
</P>
<P>
Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou, who concurrently serves as a KMT Vice
Chairman, led six KMT legislative candidates to Sun Yat-sen Memorial
Hall in downtown Taipei to bow before a bronze statue of the founding
father.
</P>
<P>
Ma, who holds a doctorate in law from Harvard University, then
delivered a speech on recent controversy about the legal status of
Taiwan from a historical perspective.
</P>
<P>
The mayor said that Ching dynasty ceded Taiwan to Japan in the
1895 Treaty of Shimonoseke, but the world recognized that the
Nationalist administration inherited the Ching dynasty.
</P>
<P>
The Shimonoseke treaty was rendered void because in a peace
treaty signed between the Republic of China and Japan in Taipei in
1952, one year after signing of the San Francisco Peace Treaty, Japan
promised that from Dec. 9, 1941, all treaties signed between the two
countries were void, which included the Treaty of Shimonoseke, which
Ma said clearly shows Taiwan's return to the Republic of China.
</P>
<P>
The 1943 Cairo Declaration -- in which leaders of the three Great
Powers of Great Britain, the United States and China met regarding
Japan -- also stipulated clearly that Japan must return the lands it
had stolen, including Manchuria, Taiwan and Penghu, and that they
must return to the Republic of China.
</P>
<P>
The KMT also sponsored an artifact exhibition of Dr. Sun Yat-sen
at its party headquarters in Taipei. A pair of Sun's shoes were among
the items on display, with the aim of conveying the message "tread
the right path and Taiwan will find its way."
</P>
<P>
The KMT also planned the first ever Sun Yat-sen memorial library.
</P>
<P>
PFP Chairman James Soong also led party officials to the Sun
Yat-sen Memorial Hall to pay tribute.
</P>
<P>
Soong criticised the ruling Democratic Progressive Party for
ruling on "ideology, " which leads to a "crisis of the collapse of
values in Taiwan." According to Soong, the DPP's claim that China is
an enemy country has made Sun Yat-sen and the goddess Matsu
"foreigners or enemies."
</P>
<P>
He was referring to recent controversy over Sun Yat-sen, whose
relations with the ROC or Taiwan seem tenuous after a proposed change
to the senior high school history curriculum, in which 1945, when the
KMT administration took over Taiwan, will serve as a watershed point
separating Taiwanese history and Chinese history, and the remarks of
"multiple founding fathers" by some DPP officials who say all the
martyrs who contributed to the birth of the ROC are the founding
fathers.
</P>
<P>
After the ceremony, several PFP legislators took banners and
trumpets to the Presidential Office to express their discontent over
the recent controversy.
</P>
<P>
PFP legislators Pang Chien-kuo, Lee Hung-chun and Chou Hsi-wei
wielded ROC flags and shouted slogans. The brief protest ended
peacefully after reading a statement urging President Chen Shui-bian
not to waver and to express his stance clearly on the status of the
nation.
</P>
<P>
The Taiwan Solidarity Union, an ally of the ruling party, said
that Taiwanese under the education of the KMT administration called
Sun Yat-sen the founding father, but his relationship with Taiwan is
tenuous.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Taiwan did not take part in the creation of the ROC,
so Taiwan's founding father is not Sun Yat-sen, it said.

<P>
President Chen Shui-bian said Friday he
should be able to arrange a state visit to the West Pacific island
nation of Palau in the first half of next year.
</P>
<P>
Chen made the remarks during a meeting with visiting Palau
President Tommy Remengesau and former Palau President Kuniwo
Nakamura.
</P>
<P>
The president told his guests that he is busy at present with
national affairs and with stumping for his Democratic Progressive
Party's (DPP's) candidates in the Dec. 11 legislative elections.
</P>
<P>
"After the elections, I think I will have a good opportunity to
arrange a state visit to Palau in the first half of 2005," Chen said,
adding that if possible, he hopes his planned visit can be timed to
allow him to attend the inauguration of a Taiwan-invested tourist
hotel under construction in Palau. The hotel is scheduled for
completion in May or June next year.
</P>
<P>
Noting that Taiwan tourists account for nearly half of the annual
tourist arrivals in Palau, Chen said Taiwan business groups have
already built several tourist hotels in the scenic Pacific island
nation.
</P>
<P>
"I believe that the completion of the new hotel next year will
further boost Taiwan's contribution to Palau's tourism development, "
Chen said.
</P>
<P>
He also took advantage of the meeting to express his gratitude
for Palau's consistent support for Taiwan's bid to joint the United
Nations and other major international organizations.

<TEXT>
<P>
A project to widen the southern link
highway has passed a feasibility assessment, Minister of
Transportation and Communications Lin Ling-san said in Taitung County
Friday.
</P>
<P>
Making the announcement during a meeting with Taitung County
Magistrate Hsu Ching-yuan, Lin said the travel time from Taitung to
Kaohsiung is expected to be cut by one hour after the NT$16.8 billion
(US$509.09 million) project is completed in 2012.
</P>
<P>
The project is set to start in 2006 after it undergoes an
environmental impact assessment next year, Lin said.
</P>
<P>
According to the feasibility assessment, the section between
Hsianglan and Tawu will be widened to a three- or four-lane
thoroughfare.
</P>
<P>
While tunnels will be drilled through the mountains in the
section between Anshuo and Tsaopu to reroute and straighten the
highway, passing lanes will be constructed in the section between
Tsaopu and Hsinlu to facilitate faster traffic flow, the report says.
</P>
<P>
The project will involve a total of 51 km of the highway, and the
tunneling project will run 4.5 km.
</P>
<P>
Lin said the feasibility assessment has taken into account
concerns about environmental protection and ecological conservation,
and that the ministry will avoid ecological and water resource
reserves while carrying out the tunneling project.

TAIWAN NOTEBOOK MAKERS JOCKEYING IN GREATER SHANGHAI AREA
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Nov.  12 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The monthly production volume of Taiwan
notebook computer makers based in the greater Shanghai area of
mainland China is expected to top 5 million units and hit 6 million
next year, almost double the present level, industry sources said
Friday.
</P>
<P>
Currently, Taiwan notebook makers operating in the Kunshan,
Sungjiang and Pudung areas near Shanghai put out nearly 3 million
units per month, making the greater Shanghai area the world's most
important area for notebooks.
</P>
<P>
As most of Taiwan's major notebook contractors have relocated to
the greater Shanghai area, their profit margins are falling fast --
to less than 5 percent -- and a fierce war to grab customers is set
to rage amid expanded production capacities, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
So far, some 90 percent of Taiwan's notebook manufacturers have
set up at least a production plant in the three cities, with Kunshan
luring the largest number and registering the highest level of output
volume.
</P>
<P>
Quanta Corp., Taiwan's largest notebook company, enjoys a
leadership role in Sungjiang with an output of 1.35 million units in
October, accounting for 45 percent of the Taiwan makers' total
production volume and effectively widening the gap between it and
other competitors.
</P>
<P>
Quanta is planning to build eight more plants in Sungjiang, six
of which are completed and five of which have been designated for
component assembly.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Compal Electronics Co. forecast that its
notebook export value contributed by its Kunshan division will reach
around US$6 billion for this year.
</P>
<P>
A Compal executive was upbeat that the company will be able to
put out 10 million notebooks for the whole of next year on the back
of an increased monthly capacity of 1.2 million units. It is
constructing a third manufacturing facility in Kunshan.
</P>
<P>
Inventec Corp. led other companies in opening its first facility
in Pudung 10 years ago due to its convenient location close to
Shanghai's new airport.
</P>
<P>
Inventec has plans to erect eight plants in Pudung, three of
which are completed to boost its present notebook production level of
500,000 units to 1 million.
</P>
<P>
Following in Inventec's footsteps, ASUSTek Computer Inc. has also
shown a strong ambition to explore Pudung, having purchased 2,500
acres of land there.
</P>
<P>
Should ASUSTek -- Taiwan's No. 1 motherboard manufacturer -- also
use its Pudung land for notebook production, the city stands a very
real chance of rivaling Kunshan and Sungjiang in terms of production
volume.
</P>
<P>
In the face of the expanded capacities of notebook makers in the
Shanghai area, none of them have shown signs of wanting to retreat
from the race, business sources pointed out, adding that their main
strategy now is to further squeeze their earnings to seize more
business opportunities.

<P>
With the government's declaration of war
against vote-buying prior to the Dec. 11 legislative elections, local
prosecutor's offices are gearing up to deal with illegal practices in
the crucial elections.
</P>
<P>
Chen Shou-huang, chief state prosecutor in Taichung, central
Taiwan, sent letters to all legislative candidates wishing them
success but at the same time warning them to eschew illegal means,
stressing that the Taichung Prosecutor's Office will be relentless in
its crackdown on bribery and violence.
</P>
<P>
Chen noted that the election of the best and the most able is a
lofty ideal, as well as the main purpose of the election, but if
vote-buying and violence is involved, it will become just a pipe
dream.
</P>
<P>
Liu Wei-chung, chief state prosecutor in Tainan, southern Taiwan,
called on 12 legislative candidates in the Tainan County to express
the hope that they will monitor any corrupt practice and work
together to root out vote-buying.
</P>
<P>
Lin also asked all the candidates to take part in an awareness
drive on anti-vote buying in Tainan County later this month.
</P>
<P>
Cheng Wen-kuei, chief state prosecutor in Liangchiang County on

challenge his determination to safeguard a fair election.
</P>
<P>
According to Cheng, past information shows that bribery is rare
in Matsu compared with Taiwan proper, but the problem of "phantom"
voters is serious.
</P>
<P>
He said that if people move their household registration to Matsu
for the election but do not actually live there, it will interfere
with the fairness of the elections and he warned such people that
doing so is illegal.

NOBEL LAUREATE TO CONVEY CHEN'S GOODWILL TO BEIJING LEADER AT APEC
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Nov.  12 (CNA)
(BY sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Academia Sinica President Lee Yuan-tseh
said Friday he will convey President Chen Shui-bian's goodwill to
mainland Chinese President Hu Jintao at the upcoming informal
leadership meeting of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC)
forum.
</P>
<P>
Lee, who will represent President Chen at the 2004 APEC summit
scheduled to open in the Chilean capital of Santiago Nov. 20, made
the remarks at a pre-departure news conference.
</P>
<P>
The soft-spoken scholar, who won the Nobel Prize in chemistry in
1986 along with two other men, said he is not a mediator between the
two sides of the Taiwan Strait. Nevertheless, he said if opportunity
presents itself, he would convey President Chen's goodwill and
determination to maintain cross-strait peace and stability.
</P>
<P>
APEC is one of the few international organizations that admit
both Taiwan and mainland China. Because of Beijing's diplomatic
suppression, Taiwan's president has been barred from attending the
annual APEC summit meeting in person and has to name a proxy to
attend the gathering on his behalf. This will be the third time that
Lee will serve as Chen's representative at the APEC summit.
</P>
<P>
Lee said he will take advantage of this year's meeting to let
other APEC leaders understand that Taiwan can make positive
contributions to the world and will never be a troublemaker or a
flashpoint that might become the theater of a Third World War.
</P>
<P>
Over the past year, Lee said, Taiwan has sent personnel to six
other APEC member states, including Chile, Vietnam, Peru, Indonesia,
the Philippines and Papua New Guinea, to assist in their digitization
programs.
</P>
<P>
"The assistance is part of our concrete actions to help narrow
the digital gap among APEC members," Lee said.
</P>
<P>
Asked whether President Chen has asked him to forward personal
letters to top leaders of other APEC countries, such as Chinese
President Hu, U.S. President George W. Bush and Japanese Prime
Minister Junichiro Koizumi, Lee said: "No. President Chen has not
asked me to convey letters to any foreign leader."
</P>
<P>
Lee stressed that Chen has repeatedly made peace initiatives to
mainland China in recent days. After unveiling 10 innovative policy
initiatives for forging rapprochement with mainland China two days
ago, Chen said Thursday mainland China's top negotiator, Wang Daohan,
president of the Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait,
is welcome to visit Taiwan to meet with his Taiwan counterpart,
Straits Exchange Foundation Chairman Koo Chen-fu.
</P>
<P>
"All these appeals signify President Chen's efforts to honor his
commitment to ease cross-strait tensions and safeguard peace,
stability and security in the Taiwan Strait," Lee said.
</P>
<P>
During last year's APEC summit, Lee recalled that he had a brief
courtesy chat with Hu. "I felt he was a person easy to talk with. Now
that Hu has taken command of the mainland military, I think he has
even greater clout in the mainland leadership hierarchy. I hope
mainland China's reform programs can continue moving forward under
his leadership," Lee added.
</P>
<P>
Asked what he will say to President Bush, Lee said he will
congratulate him on his re-election as well as express Taiwan's
gratitude for U.S. support for Taiwan's participation in the World
Health Organization as an observer. In addition, Lee said he will ask
Bush to accelerate free trade agreement negotiations with Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
As to talks with the Japanese prime minister, Lee said he will
ask Koizumi to begin free trade pact talks with Taiwan and to offer
visa-free privileges to Taiwan students.
</P>
<P>
APEC groups 21 economies; they are: Australia, Brunei, Canada,
Chile, China, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Japan, South Korea, Malaysia,
Mexico, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea, Peru, Philippines, Russia,
Singapore, Taiwan, Thailand, the United States and Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
Besides Lee, the Taiwan delegation to this year's APEC meeting
will also include Minister of Economic Affairs Ho Mei-yueh,
Department of Health Minister Chen Chien-jen and Vice Minister of
Finance Chen Shu.

JAN-SEPT CROSS-STRAIT COMMUNICATIONS RISE SIGNIFICANTLY: DGBAS
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Nov.  12 (CNA)
(By Y.F. Low)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The communications volume between Taiwan
and mainland China increased significantly in the first nine months
of this year, according to the Directorate General of Budget,
Accounting and Statistics (DGBAS) on Friday.
</P>
<P>
A total of 370 million phone calls were made across the Taiwan
Strait between January and September, up 16.1 percent from the same
period last year, the DGBAS report showed.
</P>
<P>
Looking at the calls in terms of time spent talking, 1.37 billion
minutes were used, up 25.4 percent year-on-year.
</P>
<P>
Of these phone calls, 920 million minutes were made from Taiwan
to the mainland and 440 million minutes vice versa, a rise of 31.8
percent and 13.8 percent, respectively, over last year.
</P>
<P>
On postal correspondence, the number of cross-strait letters and
parcels fell 5.5 percent year-on-year to 11.61 million during the
same period because of the fast development of telecommunications and
e-mail services, the DGBAS report said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, shipping and travel across the Strait has also
increased over the years since direct ferry services between Kinmen
and Matsu and the mainland's Xiamen and Fuzhou -- known as the "mini
three links" -- were launched in 2001.
</P>
<P>
A total of 2,412 ferry trips were operated in the 10 months to
October this year, which is almost double the 1,418 trips registered
during the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
Passengers traveling across the Strait via the "mini three links"
also jumped 1.8 fold to 175,000 during that period, according to the
DGBAS.

EMPLOYERS DISCRIMINATING AGAINST FOREIGN SPOUSES TO BE FINED
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Nov. 12 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Employers who discriminate against foreign
spouses with legal working rights in Taiwan could face a fine
ranging between NT$300,000 and NT$1.5 million, the Council of Labor
Affairs (CLA) said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The current Employment Law protects equal working opportunities
for every Taiwan citizen and thus prohibits employers from
discriminating against any employee or job seeker due to class,
language, ethnic origin or birth place.
</P>
<P>
Based on the principle of human rights protection, CLA officials
said the council has decided to extend the same protection to foreign
spouses of local citizens who have obtained the legal right to work
in Taiwan but have yet to obtain Republic of China citizenship.

TAIWAN READY TO NEGOTIATE WITH BEIJING ON CHARTER FLIGHTS: OFFICIAL
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Nov.  12 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) has
assigned an intermediary to begin talks on cross-strait charter
flights for the upcoming Chinese Lunar New Year holidays and is only
waiting for a positive response from Beijing, MAC spokesman Chiu
Tai-san said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Two days after President Chen Shui-bian said negotiations with
Beijing on direct cargo flights and charter passenger flights during
the Chinese New Year holiday could begin, Chiu said his council is
ready to authorize the Taipei Air Carrier Association to negotiate
with its mainland counterpart on this issue as soon as Beijing is
ready.
</P>
<P>
Noting that a spokesman for the Taiwan Affairs Office under the
Chinese State Council said on Oct. 27 that charter flight
negotiations could be patterned on the aviation negotiations between
Taiwan and Hong Kong, Chiu said the opinions of both sides are
converging.
</P>
<P>
Chiu said Taiwan's experience in opening charter flights between
Shanghai and Taipei in 2002 will serve as a useful guide in Taiwan's
possible negotiations with Beijing.
</P>
<P>
President Chen said Wednesday that charter flights this
year may be operated by carriers of both Taiwan and the mainland and
do not need to stop at any third place as did charter flights in
2002.
</P>
<P>
If the charter flights do in fact get off the ground, they might
open door for regular direct flights between Taiwan and the mainland
in the future, according to the president.
</P>
<P>
Chiu said his office had a conference with several government
agencies and six major business and industrial groups earlier in the
day to exchange views over the charter flights and all agreed that
talks on the issue could start immediately if Beijing responds
positively.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taiwan's seven major public banks continued
posting improved overdue loan ratios in October, the Cabinet-level
Financial Supervisory Commission (FSC) reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Except for the Taiwan Cooperative Bank, the remaining six -- Bank
of Taiwan, Land Bank of Taiwan, First Commercial Bank, Hua Nan Bank,
Chang Hwa Bank and the Medium Business Bank of Taiwan -- all
registered declined overdue loan rations last month as compared to
their September levels, according to statistics compiled by the FSC.
</P>
<P>
Bank of Taiwan, the country's most representative state-run bank,
recorded an overdue loan ratio of 1.58 percent for October, valued at
NT$18.94 billion (US$574 million) , a drop from September's 1.64
percent.
</P>
<P>
The Land Bank of Taiwan marked an improvement from 3.72 percent
to 3.62 percent worth NT$46.23 billion, while the Taiwan Cooperative
Bank posted a turnabout from 3.75 percent to 3.79 percent but with a
reduced value from NT$47.26 billion to NT$46.89 billion.
</P>
<P>
The rest of the banks also showed declines ranging from 0.18
percentage points to 0.03 percentage points, according to the FSC
tallies.
</P>
<P>
Since President Chen Shui-bian came to power for the first time
in May 2000, financial reform has been one of the priorities on the
government's agenda.
</P>

PREMIER CALLS FOR CLOSER TAIWAN-JAPAN-INDIA COOPERATION
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Nov.  12 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Premier Yu Shyi-kun said Friday Taiwan,
Japan and India should strengthen cooperation in various fields as
they have shared values in freedom, democracy and human rights
protection.
</P>
<P>
Yu made the appeal while addressing a seminar on the promotion of
Taiwan-Japan-India cooperation, organized by the private Taiwan
Thinktank.
</P>
<P>
Despite the absence of formal diplomatic ties, Yu said Taiwan has
consistently maintained close substantive ties with Japan, including
booming bilateral trade and brisk cultural and educational exchanges.
Two-way trade reached US$40 billion in 2003, making Taiwan Japan's
fourth largest trading partner. The people of the two countries made
more than 1.5 million visits to each other's country last year,
indicating close civilian exchanges, Yu added.
</P>
<P>
With the end of the Cold War, Yu said, Taiwan-India relations
have also been growing steadily in recent years. The two countries
exchanged representative offices in 1995 and the opening of direct
flights from Taipei to New Delhi by China Airlines in 2002 has
further facilitate bilateral personnel exchanges.
</P>
<P>
Two-way trade between Taiwan and India increased to US$1.5
billion last year and the two countries have forged close cooperation
in information-technology industries in recent years, Yu said, adding
that there is still ample room for Taiwan-India commercial exchanges
and cooperation to grow in the years ahead.
</P>
<P>
Noting that Taiwan is a new democracy in Asia, India the world's
largest democracy and Japan an advanced democracy, Yu said all the
three countries rank among the top five Asian economic powerhouses.
</P>
<P>
Yu said he intensely looks forward to seeing the three countries
reinforce cooperation in promoting freedom, democracy, human rights
and economic prosperity in Asia and the entire world.
</P>
<P>
The premier also said Taiwan fully supports Japan's and India's
bid to become permanent members of the United Nations Security
council.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan Thinktank Chairman Chen Po-chih said the think tank has
organized the "India-Japan-Taiwan Trialogue" seminar with a view to
promoting regional cooperation and world peace.
</P>
<P>
In his view, Chen said, Taiwan will benefit when the world is
more peaceful and the people of the world and East Asia all enjoy
freedom, democracy and prosperity.
</P>
<P>
"We hope the seminar can work out feasible measures to promote
Taiwan-Japan and Taiwan-India relations as well as the triangular
Taiwan-Japan-India cooperation, " Chen said, adding that by forging
partnerships and strategic alliances with Japan and India, Taiwan can
break the Beijing-imposed diplomatic embargo and gradually form
alliances with even more Asian democracies.
</P>
<P>
The Indian delegation to the seminar is headed by former Indian
Defense Minister Shri George Fernandes, while the Japanese mission is
led by Yoshitomi Masaru, president of Japan's Research Institute of
Economy, Trade and Industry.
</P>
<P>
Members of the Indian delegation also included Jagdish
Shettingar, chief economic policy advisor of the former ruling
Bharatiya Janata Party (Indian People's Party); Y.S. Rajan, principal
advisor of the Confederation of Indian Industry; Shyam Sunder, a
professor of accounting, economics and finance at Yale School of
Management; M.D. Nalapat, a professor of Geopolitics and UNESCO peace
chair at the Manipal Academy of Higher Education; and Jaya Jaitly,
former president of the Samata Socialist Party.

<P>
A spokesman for the Mainland Affairs
Council (MAC) urged Beijing authorities Friday to respond
affirmatively to President Chen Shui-bian's offer for another meeting
between Beijing's chief negotiator with Taiwan, Wang Daohan, and his
Taiwan counterpart, Koo Chen-fu.
</P>
<P>
MAC spokesman Chiu Tai-san told a news conference that Chen's
suggestion is a follow-up to his Double Ten National Day address
wherein he urged Beijing to resume talks with Taiwan on the basis of
discussions that were held between the two sides in 1992 in Hong
Kong.
</P>
<P>
Chen offered Wednesday to invite Wang, who is the head of
Beijing's Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits, to
visit Taiwan and meet with Koo, who is the chairman of Taiwan's
Straits Exchange Foundation.
</P>
<P>
The president extended the invitation after visiting Koo at a
local hospital where Koo was admitted for poor health.
</P>
<P>
Koo and Wang met for the first time in 1993 in Singapore, which
was the first talks between Taiwan and mainland China since the two
separated in 1949 after a civil war, but their discussions were not
continued because of a statement by then-President Lee Teng-hui in
1999 that the relationship between the two sides was "state to state"
in nature. China was angered and did not return to the discussions.

<P>
Famous songwriter Liang Hung-chih, who died
of pancreatic cancer at Tri-Service General Hospital Oct. 30 at the
age of 44, was remembered in a grand funeral Friday.
</P>
<P>
The funeral took place at Holy Family Catholic Church in Taipei,
with Cardinal Paul Shan presiding over a requiem mass, which was then
followed by a music-filled memorial service.
</P>
<P>
Presidential Office Deputy Secretary-General Cho Jung-tai
presented a posthumous citation to Liang on behalf of President Chen
Shui-bian at the funeral in recognition of his music career
achievements and his assistance in helping design the annual
Presidential Education Awards a few years ago.
</P>
<P>
Liang had composed many popular lyric songs during his music
career that spanned more than two decades. Many Mandarin pop singers,
including Tsai Chin, Su Jui, Wang Chi-lei, Cheng Yi, Yu Tai-yen,
Chiang Yu-heng and Tseng Ching-yu, came to fame after singing his
songs. They took turns singing Liang's songs at the memorial service.
</P>
<P>
Liang was already in the terminal stage of pancreatic cancer when
his disease was discovered by Tri-Service General Hospital doctors
early this year.
</P>
<P>
Doctors said pancreatic cancer is one of the most virulent forms
of cancer because it shows no special symptoms in the early stages.
Doctors said Liang had undergone chemotherapy and radiotherapy, but
the treatment was not effective.

<TEXT>
<P>
Nearly 53 percent of workers in Taiwan will
accept high-risk jobs if the price is right, according to the results
of a survey released by the 1111 Job Bank Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The survey was conducted between Oct. 28 and Nov. 12 on 1,300
workers, with a margin of error of 2.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
As to why a person would take a high-risk job, 42.38 percent of
the respondents said these jobs usually offer high pay, 39.92 percent
said they would earn big money in a short period of time, 30 percent
said this would help them through the hard times of unemployment, and
24.23 percent said these jobs would enrich their life experience.
</P>
<P>
The top-10 high-risk professions named by the respondents were
high-voltage electricity engineering, chemical manufacturing,
high-rise window cleaning, quarry blasting, fire-fighting, oil and
propane delivery, policeman, stunt performing, medical waste
disposal, and mining.
</P>
<P>
As to the degree of risk involving their present jobs, the
respondents graded an average of 3.84 on a 10-point scale.

Those respondents from the medical and biochemical sectors
consider their professions the most dangerous (4.7 points), followed
by those working in the traditional manufacturing sector (4.3 points)
and dining, tourism and entertainment sectors (4.1 points).
</P>
<P>
The survey found that less than 20 percent of the workers will
take workplace safety into consideration in picking their jobs, with
61 percent citing career development as their priority consideration.
</P>
<P>
Also, more than 50 percent of the respondents are unaware of the
fact that workers in some high-risk professions are not entitled to
insurance because of rejection by insurance companies, according to
the survey.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mainland China has agreed to open its
markets to seven more kinds of Taiwan fruits, an agricultural
delegation said Saturday upon its return from the mainland.
</P>
<P>
Legislative candidate Hsu Hsin-liang, who led a score of
representatives from farmers' associations last Sunday to the
mainland, said the delegation met with mainland Vice Premier Hui
Liangyu, Director of Taiwan Affairs Office of the State Council Chen
Yunlin, and Minister of Agriculture Du Qinglin during the weeklong
visit.
</P>
<P>
Hsu, a former chairman of the now-ruling Democratic Progressive
Party, noted that the World Trade Organization will expand
agricultural product trade in 2006 and that up to 134 agricultural
products might flock into Taiwan by then.
</P>
<P>
The visit aims to find outlets for Taiwan farmers and ease
cross-strait tensions to avoid unnecessary confrontations, Hsu said.
</P>
<P>
Ku Yuan-chun, president of Taiwan Province Farmers' Association,
said that Hui and other mainland officials have agreed to allow seven
more kinds of fruits -- guavas, dates, oranges, papayas, lychees,
bananas, and pineapples -- from Taiwan to the mainland in addition to
the original five kinds -- pomelos, betel nuts, mangoes, starfruits,
and wax apples -- starting Dec. 1.
</P>
<P>
Beijing also agreed that it will not dump rice, vegetables and
fruits in Taiwan after the expansion of agricultural trade under the
WTO framework in 2006, and that Taiwan will import corn, soybean and
wheat it does not produce from the mainland to cut production costs,
Ku added.
</P>
<P>
Both sides also agreed to set up counterpart offices, with
Taiwan's farmers' associations dealing with the agriculture product
transactions, which will provide 62 percent of the profits back to
farmers.
</P>
<P>
Hsieh Yung-huei, president of Yunlin County Farmers's
Association, said that the delegation has repeatedly asked for
tariff-free treatment and simplified quarantine procedures for
imported Taiwan agricultural products, and Beijing has agreed to do
as much as it could.

OPPOSITION CALLS FOR SACKING OF OFFICIALS WHO DENY ROC EXISTS
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Nov. 13 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Lawmakers from the opposition People First
Party (PFP) Saturday called for the dismissal of two officials from
the Examination Yuan who have denied the existence of the Republic of
China (ROC).
</P>
<P>
Legislator Liu Wen-hsiung, convener of the PFP caucus at the
Legislative Yuan, said President Chen Shui-bian, who was sworn in as
ROC president should honor his official oath by firing Yao Chia-wen,
president of the Examination Yuan and Lin Yu-ti, a member of the
yuan, who claimed that the ROC is not their country and Sun Yat-sen,
the founder of the ROC, was a foreigner.
</P>
<P>
Leaving the two at their posts would make Chen a hypocrite since
he said that he is the president of the ROC, an entity that Yao and
Lin deny even exists.
</P>
<P>
Another PFP lawmaker, Hsu Yuan-kuo, called on Yao and Lin to quit
their posts on their own to show that they meant what they said
instead of hanging on shamelessly to jobs in a country they don't
acknowledge.
</P>
<P>
Yao and Lin drew fire from the PFP and the Kuomintang (KMT) by
claiming earlier this week that Taiwan is not the Republic of China,
and that the Examination Yuan's history test for government employees
should exclude the history of the ROC.
</P>
<P>
In a related development Saturday, KMT lawmaker Huang Teh-fu said
President Chen and his Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) have
created the controversy over the identity of the country as a
campaign strategy for the year-end legislative elections.
</P>
<P>
Huang said Chen and the DPP should be blamed for splitting the
country for their own political gains.

National Taiwan University (NTU) will
confer an honorary doctorate degree on the 2000 Nobel Prize for
literature winner Gao Xingjian during the university's 76th
anniversary celebrations on Nov. 15, officials said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese-French writer, however, will not be able to come to
Taiwan for the ceremony because his health does not allow him to fly
long distances, the NTU officials said.
</P>
<P>
Gao will instead address the event through a 10-minute
pre-recorded video that will be shown at the event, they said.
</P>
<P>
Also, they said, Gao has promised to offer lectures at NTU during
the second half of next year or the year after that if his health
improves.
</P>
<P>
The theme of the lectures might focus on "literature and life"
and "literature and art."
</P>
<P>
As an alternative arrangement in the case of his failure to make
the trip, the NTU could send a literature professor to Paris and have
their dialogue recorded as a video for teaching purposes, according
to the officials.
</P>
<P>
Gao, who was born in mainland China's Jiangxi province in 1940,
left the mainland in 1987 and settled down a year later in France as
a political refugee.

<P>
President Chen Shui-bian confirmed in
Taipei Saturday that Dr. Sun Yat-sen is the founding father of "our
country" and the flag of the Republic of China is "the flag of our
country."
</P>
<P>
In an attempt to quell the controversy stemming from the denial
of the existence of the ROC by two senior officials from Chen's
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) , Chen said as "the 11th-term
president of the ROC," he will do his part to defend the sovereignty,
safety and dignity of "Taiwan."
</P>
<P>
The president used the terms "ROC" and "Taiwan" alternatively in
his statement to draw a parallel between them.
</P>
<P>
The two DPP officials, Examination Yuan President Yao Chia-wen
and a member of the yuan, Lin Yu-ti, caused an uproar among
opposition politicians by denying that the ROC is the name of their
country earlier this week, which gave Chen's political critics a
field day to lambaste the president.
</P>
<P>
Chen made the statement while visiting a temple in Neihu, Taipei
City. He was accompanied by five DPP candidates in the year-end
legislative elections.
</P>
<P>
While being treated by the temple to dumplings, a Chinese snack
which is supposed to bring safety to those who consume them, Chen
ascribed his failure to win re-election as mayor of Taipei City in
1998 to his failure to visit the temple and eat its dumplings that
year.
</P>
<P>
Now that the god to which the temple was dedicated has helped him
win re-election as president, Chen said he hopes the god of the
temple will also help the five DPP candidates who accompanied him on
the visit to win in the year-end elections.

<P>
Bureau officials forecast that the figure will rise to 7.8
million for the whole of this year, equalling one trip for every
three Taiwan people.
</P>
<P>
The full 2004 figure will represent a noticeable increase over
the 2003 level of 5.92 million and over the 2002 level of 7.32
million.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong and Macau are the most popular destinations for Taiwan
people who go abroad for the first time, as more than 40 percent of
the total make their first overseas trips there, they noted.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Department of Health (DOH) held a
ceremony Saturday to honor 244 medical professionals who have devoted
half a century of their lives to helping patients.
</P>
<P>
President Chen Shui-bian was invited to present them -- including
Western and Chinese medical doctors, dentists, medical examiners and
mid-wives -- with citations to express the DOH's highest regards and
gratitude.
</P>
<P>
DOH Minister Chen Chien-jen lauded the unselfish devotion of the
medical personnel, saying that have conveyed "warmth and a shining
light" in facing the "darkest moment of life."
</P>
<P>
Hsu Yuo-chuan, 93, one of the physicians honored, said he has
worked in internal medicine since finishing his studies in Japan.
</P>
<P>
Hsu and his wife, a gynecologist and obstetrician, opened a
general hospital in Chingshui, Taichung County. He only gave up his
practice at age 88.
</P>
<P>
Hsu said that he made up his mind to become a doctor after his
mother died giving birth to him. During his medical practice over 50
years, he never thought of making big money, saying that he derives
his greatest joy from seeing a patient healed.

Asked about his feelings about practicing medicine all his life,
he said that he must thank the blessing of god for letting him never
have a major malpractice problem.
</P>
<P>
Su Chi-mou, a 92-year-old ophthalmologist, has devoted all his

who were poor, adding that his house was always filled with fresh
vegetables or fish from his patients to show their gratitude.

EX-PRESIDENT MAKES PITCH FOR NEW CONSTITUTION

(By Maubo Chang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Former President Lee Teng-hui, who has been
an ardent advocate of Taiwan independence after leaving office in
2000, made a pitch for a new constitution for the country in Tainan,
southern Taiwan, Saturday, claiming the country's Constitution has
been reduced to a "ragged mosquito net" after being tinkered with six
times during his term in office.
</P>
<P>
Stumping for candidates of the Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU), Lee
said he dared not take the euphemism of "Taiwan's founding father"
offered to him by some of his supporters, but he would spare no
efforts to press for a new constitution for the country.
</P>
<P>
As a Taiwanese, he said, it was a pity that he had to serve as
the "false" president of the "Republic of China" between 1996 and
2000, although the ROC had perished long ago.
</P>
<P>
Lee disputed as nonsense the claims that a new constitution for
Taiwan will invoke a military attack from Beijing, saying that China
is incapable of doing that militarily and because of the disastrous
political fallout that would ensue.
</P>
<P>
He urged voters to support TSU candidates because in that way
they will be helping the ruling Democratic Progressive Party to win a
majority in the Legislative Yuan.

NEW TAIWAN DOLLAR WILL KEEP RISING AGAINST U. S. DOLLAR: DEALERS
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Nov.  13 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The new Taiwan dollar will maintain its
rising streak against the U.S. dollar in the future despite its
recent gains in value against the greenback, market dealers said
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
With the recent re-election of U.S. President George W. Bush and
rampant speculation on an appreciation of mainland China's renminbi,
the local currency has gotten a boost to firmer ground against the
U.S. unit, they said.
</P>
<P>
Bush's re-election coupled with the United States' long-term huge
trade and fiscal deficits have been indicative that the United States
will tolerate a weaker greenback, market watchers said, pointing out
that this widely held assumption has been prompting foreign capital
to flow into Asia.
</P>
<P>
Asian currencies, including the Japanese yen, the Korean won, the
Singapore dollar and the new Taiwan dollar all went up markedly in
value against the U.S. dollar in recent days, they noted.
</P>
<P>
The new Taiwan dollar appreciated by a combined NT$0.127 against
the U.S. dollar Thursday and Friday, finishing at NT$32.990.
</P>
<P>
They forecast that the local currency will further gain steam
against the U.S. dollar on the grounds that the renminbi will
eventually loosen its peg to the greenback and that the local unit
will get an extra boost provided by the Morgan Stanley Capital
International's move to increase the inclusion weight of its Taiwan
Index from 75 percent in late November to 100 percent in May 2005.
</P>
<P>
Yeh Yin-hua, a professor at Fu Jen Catholic University, predicted
a weak course for the U.S. dollar, pointing to the United States'
serious trade deficits as the main factor.
</P>
<P>
An analyst in charge of operations in Northeast Asia at Standard
Chartered Bank claimed that Asian currencies will further strengthen
against the U.S. dollar by at least 5 percent next year.

MONTHLY SUBSIDY FOR ELDERLY COULD BE RAISED TO NT$7,500: PRESIDENT
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei, Nov. 13 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President Chen Shui-bian said Saturday that
if the "pan-green camp" of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) and its ally, Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU), wins a majority in
the year-end legislative elections, the monthly subsidy for seniors
over 65 will be raised to NT$7,500 (US$227).
</P>
<P>
President Chen made the remarks when he led a large contingent of
officials to stump for three DPP candidates in Yunlin, central Taiwan
for the Dec. 11 legislative elections. Accompanying him were Vice
President Annette Lu, DPP Secretary-General Chang Chun-hsiung, DPP
Vice Secretary-General Lee Ying-yuan, Vice Minister of the Interior
Lee Chin-yung, and Council of Agriculture Vice Chairman Tai
Cheng-yao.
</P>
<P>
The president noted that if the "pan-green camp" wins more than
half of the 225 seats in the legislature, then after the new
legislature is inaugurated in February next year, a proposed national
subsidy bill for the elderly can be passed.
</P>
<P>
"In the future, those seniors over 65 will be able to receive
NT$7,500 a month, not the present NT$3,000 or NT$4,000," he said.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the president said that a financial restructuring
fund should be increased to help write off bad loans and attract more
foreign investment in Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
The president also took the opportunity to express his
appreciation to Yunlin County, saying that he garnered only 47
percent of the vote from the county in 2000 presidential election,
but the number topped 60 percent in the March 20, 2004 election.
</P>
<P>
The increase of 50,000 votes shows that Yunlin people want him to
better the economy and embark on major reforms, the president said.
But he said that he was hand-tied over the past four years because
the opposition "pan-blue alliance" of the Kuomintang and the People
First Party still enjoy a slight majority in the legislature.
</P>
<P>
The president asked the people of Yunlin to give him and his
administration a continued mandate in the legislature by allowing all
three DPP candidates to be elected.
</P>
<P>
Vice President Lu also said that the Taiwan fish called tilapia
is being raised commercially in ponds, some of which are damaging the
environment. Although the fish is popular on dinner tables around
Taiwan and as an export item, the problems with the ponds must be
addressed. She said she would convene a seminar to discuss the issues
soon.
</P>
<P>
Next February, she will also invite those in the industrial,
agricultural and fishery sectors to go with her to Latin American
for a visit, saying that she hopes to spread Taiwan's superb
agricultural and fishery technology.

KAOHSIUNG HARBOR WELCOMES RENEWED CONTRACT BY MAERSK

<TEXT>
<P>
The Kaohsiung Harbor Bureau on Saturday
welcomes Maersk's decision to renew the rental contract with the port
over two wharves in the port's fifth container center.
</P>
<P>
Harbor officials said Saturday that Maersk's decision to renew
its lease of the 76th and 77th wharves until 2010 is significant,
because they said it will help Kaohsiung Harbor develop into a
leading shipping center for the Asia-Pacific region.
</P>
<P>
They noted that with ports in mainland China and Southeast Asia
emerging in recent years, and the continued delay of direct
cross-strait shipping links, Kaoshiung has faced steep competition
and challenges in its operations, especially because Hong Kong and
Macau have used fairly low rates to woo shipping companies.
</P>
<P>
Maersk currently rents the 118th and the 119th wharves in the
fourth container center of the harbor as well as the 76th and 77th
wharves in the fifth container center, the contract for the latter
would have expired next year.

TAIWAN WORKS TO IMPROVE TRADE DEFICIT WITH SOUTH KOREA
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The government has launched a
sales-promotion program targeting South Korea to continue its efforts
to improve Taiwan's huge deficit with that country, Ministry of
Economic Affairs (MOEA) officials said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan has an unfavorable trade balance toward South Korea that
started in 1989, with the amount standing at US$4.32 billion in the
nine months to September this year and becoming the second-largest
source of Taiwan's trade deficit, according to MOEA statistics.
</P>
<P>
The ministry started a program to "strengthen trade toward South
Korea" early this year by organizing a series of fact-finding and
trade-show missions to South Korea.
</P>
<P>
Major industrial associations in Taiwan also jointly established
a Taiwan-South Korea trade and economic friendship club in October to
try to strengthen bilateral exchanges.
</P>
<P>
MOEA officials said this program has produced preliminary
results, with Taiwan's exports to South Korea posting an average
monthly growth of 30 percent from April to September this year.
</P>
<P>
In order to keep up with these efforts, the ministry has worked
out the sales-promotion program, which will cover measures such as
setting up a "Korean task force" and "Korean desk" at the Taiwan
External Trade Development Council (TAITRA) to assist South Korean
buyers, they said.
</P>
<P>
TAITRA staff will visit the Taiwan offices of major South Korean
manufacturers such as Samsung and LG to facilitate their procurements
in Taiwan, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
They said the ministry will also organize trade-promotion tours
to South Korea, which will join members of the automobile and mobile
phone parts and components, communications, digital content, sports
equipment and bicycle sectors.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the ministry will host a series of activities to
help domestic manufacturers promote their corporate images and assist
them with setting up more sales outlets, they said.
</P>
<P>
South Korea is the fifth-largest trading partner of Taiwan. It is
also Taiwan's fourth-largest source of imports and six-largest
out-bound market.

<P>
Vice President Annette Lu vowed Saturday to
make Taiwan's farmers and fishermen the world's happiest people in
their line of work, encouraging them to have new ideas and reach out
to explore new horizons.
</P>
<P>
Lu made the remarks while stumping at a campaign stop in central
Yunlin County for three candidates of the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party in the Dec. 11 legislative elections.
</P>
<P>
Stressing that Taiwan's agricultural and fishery industries must
aim to produce the world's top-level goods, Lu urged local farmers
and fishermen to develop new thinking in the face of severe
challenges from across the world.
</P>
<P>
Lu said that she is planning to lead a mission of fishermen,
farmers and businessmen to visit various countries in Central and
South America in February.
</P>
<P>
According to the vice president, what she hopes to achieve with
the trip is to help open a new window for young farmers and fishermen
from Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
But before that, she said, she will host a seminar with township
and village chiefs from nationwide coastal regions to discuss and
find solutions to problems related to land sinkage and aquaculture --
all issues of grave concern to their livelihood.
</P>
<P>
She also warned Taiwan's farmers not to fall into mainland
China's trap, which has been offering free land to lure Taiwan people
to settle there.
</P>
<P>
Pointing out that local farmers's poverty is usually the main
reason behind the numerous riots and unrest in the mainland's rural
areas, she urged Taiwan people to open wide their eyes and never buy
the story.

PRESIDENT URGES E.U. TO ABANDON 'ONE CHINA' POLICY
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei, Nov. 13 (CNA)
(By Huang Kwang-chun)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President Chen Shui-bian urged the European
Union Saturday to abandon the "one China" policy, according to a
press release issued by the Presidential Office.
</P>
<P>
Chen made the appeal in a pre-recorded video address to the
inauguration of the Marco Polo Club formed by pro-Taiwan lawmakers of
25 E.U. member nations and of the European Parliament in London.
</P>
<P>
Chen said in his speech that the "one China" policy adopted by
the E.U. prevents him from visiting the E.U. member nations, which,
he criticized, is not only an unreasonable restriction against a
president elected directly by the people of Taiwan but also ignores
their basic rights.
</P>
<P>
It is also ironic to the concept of freedom, democracy and human
rights upheld for long by the European nations, Chen stressed.
</P>
<P>
It was harmful to the spirit of freedom when he was forced to
abandon a trip to Denmark in 2001 to receive the "Prize for Freedom"
granted by the Liberal International and to commission his
wheelchair-bound wife Wu Shu-jen to travel to Strasbourg, France to
collect the award on his behalf, Chen went on.
</P>
<P>
The Republic of China has persistently supported the universal
values of freedom, democracy and human rights and hopes that the
international community can fairly treat Taiwan with the status it
deserves, Chen appealed.
</P>
<P>
The president also thanked the European lawmakers for the support
they have extended to Taiwan.

ROC OFFICIAL TO EXPLAIN CHEN'S CROSS-STRAIT POLICY AT ICG MEETING
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Geneva,  Nov. 13 (CNA)
(By C.H. Lu and P.C. Tang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A senior Presidential Office official said
Saturday that he will explain President Chen Shui-bian's ideas and
policies on cross-Taiwan Strait relations to leading members of the
International Crisis Group (ICG).
</P>
<P>
The ICG, an independent non-profit organization working to
prevent conflict via field-based analysis and high-level advocacy, is
holding a three-day meeting of its board in Geneva Nov. 13-15. Huang
is a Taiwan member of the ICG board.
</P>
<P>
Huang Chih-fang, deputy secretary-general of the Presidential
Office, arrived in Geneva Saturday from London, where he attended the
inauguration of a pro-Taiwan pan-European organization supported by
legislators from various member states of the European Union.
</P>
<P>
Huang said upon his arrival in Geneva that although he is not
sure whether the meeting will discuss cross-strait issues, he will
certainly take the opportunity to explain the president's ideas and
policies on cross-strait relations as well as the current state of
cross-strait relations.
</P>
<P>
Noting that Chen has formulated since February of this year a set
of rational concepts regarding cross-strait relations, the deputy
secretary-general said that Taiwan should make the international
community better understand these concepts.
</P>
<P>
The president said in February that he hopes to establish a
peaceful and stable interactive framework between the two sides of
the Taiwan Strait. He also expressed his goodwill in wanting to
develop better relations with mainland China in his May 20 inaugural
speech and his Double-Tenth National Day speech.
</P>
<P>
At an expanded meeting of the National Security Council held Nov.
10, Chen also urged Beijing to resume cross-strait dialogue and
proposed the establishment of a cross-strait military security
consultation mechanism.
</P>
<P>
The ICG board includes prominent political, diplomatic, business
and media figures from countries around the world, including former
U.S. National Security Advisor Zbigniew Brzezinski, former U.S. Trade
Representative Carla Hills, former European Parliament President Pat
Cox and former Swiss President Ruth Dreifuss.
</P>
<P>
The organization is currently chaired by former Finnish President
Martti Ahtisaari, while former Australian Foreign Minister Gareth
Evans has served as its president since January 2000.
</P>
<P>
With more than 100 staff members on five continents, the
Brussels-based ICG produces regular analytical reports containing
practical recommendations targeted at key international
decision-makers.
</P>

The organization also publishes a monthly bulletin, Crisis Watch,
to provide a regular update on the current state of the most

BEIJING TOUGHENS STANCE AGAINST TAIWAN'S IHR INCLUSION
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Geneva,  Nov.13 (CNA)
(By C.H. Lu and P.C.Tang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mainland China has promised to do whatever
it can to oppose the inclusion of Taiwan in the International Health
Regulations (IHR) after the revisions of the regulations.
</P>
<P>
WHO member states engaged in a two-week session of
inter-governmental working group meetings which began Nov. 1 on
revisions of the organization's IHR, with the goal of bringing the
regulations up to date and increasing controls on the international
spread of infectious disease.
</P>
<P>
Despite the fact that a proposal made by Nicaraguan delegates to
the meetings that could indirectly help Taiwan's participation in the
IHR was supported by 16 of the island's diplomatic allies, the United
States and other countries, Beijing continued to oppose Taiwan's
inclusion in the regulations.
</P>
<P>
Nicaragua proposed revising Article 65 of the current IHR rules
related to the participation of non-members of the WHO, saying that
the article should include those territories that have the ability to
add to the knowledge pool in health-related matters and that can take
on IHR affairs in the same manner as WHO members.
</P>
<P>
But mainland China and its backers strongly opposed the proposal
at the meetings, claiming that the territories do not have the proper
legal status to join since the WHO is an intergovernmental
organization and the IHR is a convention among nations.
</P>
<P>
As the differences between the two camps on the proposal could
not be resolved during the meetings, the chairman of the meetings
decided during the panel discussions Wednesday to shelve the issue
pending future discussions.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Beijing toughened its stance at the last plenary
session of the meetings held Nov. 12, and its chief delegate to the
meetings, Sha Zukang, said that since the WHO is a special
sub-institution of the United Nations, it can only discuss health
issues, and not political issues.
</P>
<P>
Although health issues are important, Sha said, national
sovereignty is more important, and the IHR should respect national
sovereignty and territorial integrity. "China will never compromise
and will do whatever it can to protect (the sovereignty and
territorial integrity)," he said.
</P>
<P>
In order to oppose the "principle of universality" supported by
many WHO member states, including the United States, the European
Union countries and Canada, Sha even set a precondition at the
meeting, claiming that there will be no agreements unless agreement
can be reached on all the issues regarding the IHR revisions.
</P>
<P>
In response to Sha's remarks, the U.S. delegates reiterated their
firm stance in support of Taiwan's inclusion in the global health
system, saying that nobody can be neglected by the IHR and that the
principle of universality is unquestionable.
</P>
<P>
Due to the lack of consensus being reached on various IHR
revision issues at the meetings, the WHO member states decided at the
plenary session that they will hold additional working party meetings
next February to discuss the IHR revisions proposals.
</P>
<P>
Analyzing views voiced by WHO members at the meetings, Shen
Lyu-shun, director of the Taipei Economic and Cultural Office in
Geneva, has expressed that there is room for Taiwan to make further
efforts to push for its inclusion in the IHR, noting that no WHO
member can unilaterally deny Taiwan's bid to be included in the
regulations because the issues have drawn attention from many WHO
members.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan has so far failed to become a member of the World Health
Assembly, the WHO's highest decision-making body, despite years of
efforts.

FOREST FIRE BROUGHT UNDER CONTROL
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taichung,  Taiwan,  Nov. 14 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A forest fire in the Lishan and
Tayuling areas in mountainous central Taiwan has been brought under
temporary control, sources from the Tungshih Forestry Management
Department reported Sunday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The fire, which broke out simultaneously in four places late
Saturday afternoon, had engulfed nearly nine hectares of state forest
as of noon Sunday, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
Police, who are continuing their investigations into the cause of
the fire, have not ruled out the possibility of arson.
</P>
<P>
The area ravaged by fire contains mainly Taiwan red pine and
yellow cedar, which are both systematically cultivated around
Taiwan's mountainous areas, said Chen Yi-huang, director of the
Tungshih Forestry Management Department.
</P>
<P>
Department officials were alerted about the fire at about 7 p.m.
Saturday and immediately mobilized 57 firefighters to try to contain
the fire in the woods located about 2,400 meters above sea level,
Chen said.
</P>
<P>
About 100 more firefighters were rushed to the scene during
Sunday morning, while a firefighting helicopter was also dispatched,
with the fire being brought under control by about noon Sunday,
according to Chen.
</P>
<P>
Department officials said they strongly suspect that the fire was
started by farmers who had been informed by the National Forestry
Bureau in recent months that if they failed to plant 600 trees per
hectare under a forestation project, their leased lands would be
taken back by the government and all orchards and crops on any leased
land taken back by the government are to be destroyed.
</P>
<P>
A group of farmers staged a protest in front of the Tungshi
Forestry Management Department Nov. 11 and appealed to the government
for more lenient measures and a longer grace period.

M'LAND HAS FILES ON TAIWAN RESIDENTS' PERSONAL DATA: DPP LAWMAKERS
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Mainland Chinese intelligence authorities
have files on almost all the personal data of Taiwan residents,
Legislator Trong Chai of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) claimed Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Chai, together with two other DPP lawmakers, submitted an
emergency inquiry to the Executive Yuan, telling the administration
about the seriousness of the problem and calling for a quick
resolution to the "crisis."
</P>
<P>
Chai quoted unidentified Taiwan businesspeople in mainland China
and intelligence sources as saying recently that mainland Chinese
intelligence officials have files on the personal data of almost
every resident in Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Mainland Chinese intelligence authorities' computers contain data
on Taiwan residents' household registration, military service
records, vehicle registration and even national health insurance
records, Chai claimed.
</P>
<P>
Mainland authorities also keep files on Taiwan's political
parties, military hierarchy line-ups, and high technology research
and development sector personnel, Chai asserted.
</P>
<P>
The data could be smuggled from Taiwan and sold to mainland
authorities by unworthy Taiwan officials or stolen by criminal rings
who trade the information for certain purposes, Chai claimed.
</P>
<P>
Chai said that mainland intelligence authorities have established
atask force to exclusively focus on Taiwan's upcoming legislative
elections, including gathering personal data on the candidates. The
task force is even dedicated to trying to influence the elections by
having Taiwan businesspeople on the mainland return to Taiwan to vote
or to drum up support for candidates that are more to Beijing's
liking, he added.
</P>
<P>
He said this is a pressing issue that the Taiwan people should be
concerned with and that should be tackled.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, DPP Legislators Lin Chin-hsing and Chiang Chao-yi said
they want the government to "clean up" all possible channels through
which important personal data could be smuggled to the mainland and
to establish a special task force to find out whether certain
government officials have been bribed by Beijing for intelligence
information.

DPP LEGISLATIVE VICTORY NEEDED TO GET BEIJING TO THE TABLE: CHANG
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Nov.  14 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mainland China will be willing to resume
talks with Taiwan only if the ruling Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) gains a clear majority in the Legislative Yuan in the Dec. 11
elections, DPP Secretary-General Chang Chun-hsiung said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Chang made the remarks while stumping for DPP Legislator Lee
Chun-yi who is seeking another three-year term in the southern Tainan
County constituency.
</P>
<P>
Chang said that although the DPP managed to win the presidency in
2000, it has yet to control a clear majority in the legislature.
</P>
<P>
As a result, Chang said, many aspects of the DPP's political
reform agenda and its policy initiatives have been blocked by the
opposition-controlled Legislative Yuan over the past four years.
</P>
<P>
Chang said he intensely hopes that the "pan-green" camp of the
DPP and its ally -- the Taiwan Solidarity Union -- can jointly win a
majority in the 225-seat legislature in the upcoming elections. If
this goal is accomplished, he said, the DPP will then become a
full-fledged ruling party and be able to implement its core agenda.
</P>
<P>
"Moreover, Beijing would be more willing to resume dialogue with
Taiwan to forge cross-strait rapprochement, " Chang said, claiming
that the DPP's inability to control a majority in the legislature has
been a factor discouraging mainland China from negotiating with the
DPP administration.
</P>
<P>
"If we manage to gain control of the legislature, we'll have an
even stronger mandate to negotiate with Beijing, and mainland leaders
will no longer be able to ignore the DPP administration's call for
peaceful dialogue and engagement," Chang claimed.
</P>
<P>
Beijing unilaterally suspended dialogue with Taiwan in July 1999
after then-ROC President Lee Teng-hui defined relations across the
Taiwan Strait as a special state-to-state relationship, which Beijing
viewed as a move promoting Taiwan independence.

JAPAN TO GRANT VISA-FREE ENTRY TO ROC CITIZENS FROM NEXT MARCH: REPORT
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Tokyo,  Nov.  14 (CNA)
(By Perry Hsieh and Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Japanese government has tentatively
decided to grant visa-free privilege to Taiwan citizens from March
2005, the Japanese Sankei Shimbun daily reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
According to the Japanese business newspaper, the Japanese
government will come up with a draft revision to its existing exit
and entry law to that effect early next year for the Japanese
parliament to approve.
</P>
<P>
Under the current Japanese exit and entry law, the Japanese
government can only offer visa-free privilege to citizens of
countries with which Japan maintains diplomatic relations.
</P>
<P>
As Japan switched diplomatic recognition from Taipei to Beijing
in 1972, offering visa-free privilege to Republic of China citizens
requires an amendment to its existing exit and entry law. The
Japanese government has decided to add a clause to the law allowing
citizens from "officially designated areas" to enjoy the same
visa-free privilege, the Sankei Shimbun said.
</P>
<P>
The paper further said that once the proposed revision clears the
Japanese legislative floor, former ROC President Lee Teng-hui will be
able to visit Japan easily.
</P>
<P>
For fear of offending Beijing, the Japanese government has been
reluctant to issue a visa to Lee for a private visit.
</P>
<P>
The Sankei Shimbun said Japan's decision to grant visa-free
privilege to Taiwan citizens is part of its efforts to attract more
foreign visitors to an eco-friendly world exposition to be held in
the Japanese prefecture Aichi next year. The EXPO 2005 Aichi, Japan
will be held March 25-Sept. 25, with the participation of 122
countries and many international organizations, including the United
Nations and its affiliates.

<P>
No war is expected to break out
between Taiwan and mainland China, although a tense stand-off across
the Taiwan Strait is likely to occur, an adviser to the Taipei City
Government said in Kuala Lumpur Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Cheng An-kuo made the remarks while delivering a speech on
cross-strait relations at a celebration activity organized by the
Alumni Association of the Taipei-based National Chengchi University
in Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
Noting that maintaining stability and peace across the Taiwan
Strait serves the interests of the United States, Cheng said that the
U.S. government will do its utmost to prevent either of the two sides
of the Taiwan Strait from taking any provocative actions that might
trigger a war.
</P>
<P>
U.S. President George W. Bush is expected to push for a
resumption in cross-strait dialogue in the year to come following his
recent re-election, while ROC President Chen Shui-bian will seek to
improve relations between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait, Cheng
pointed out.
</P>
<P>
He further said that relations between the United States and
mainland China are becoming closer, with the two nations becoming
cordial trade and investment partners. In addition, he noted, the
Washington and Beijing authorities have also reached a consensus on
the anti-terror issue.

Premier Yu Shyi-kun urged the public Sunday
to cooperate with the government to wipe out vote-buying in the
run-up to the Dec. 11 legislative elections.
</P>
<P>
Yu made the appeal at a rally in Taipei, organized by the
Ministry of Justice (MOJ) to signify the government's determination
to get rid of election bribery.
</P>
<P>
Noting that 387 hopefuls will vie for 176 regional and aboriginal

constituencies is tense and ferocious.
</P>
<P>
With a view to establishing clean politics, Yu said, law
enforcement authorities will gear up to fight against vote-buying.
</P>
<P>
"We should not let money pollute our politics. We want democracy,
not moneyed politics. We should work together to eradicate the
corrupt vote-buying practices which used to be rampant in the past, "
the premier said.
</P>
<P>
To upgrade the efficiency of the anti-vote-buying campaign, Yu
said, prosecutors and MOJ investigators will begin to work at police
offices in cities and counties around the nation 10 days before
voting day to facilitate monitoring and investigations into
vote-buying charges or suspicious deals.
</P>
<P>
Yu said ordinary citizens are welcome to provide any information
on any suspected vote-buying acts.
</P>
<P>
"Whoever manages to provide useful leads or clues that result in
conviction of any vote-buying case will be offered lucrative
cash rewards of up to NT$10 million," Yu added.

BOTH CAMPS TRY TO WOO VOTERS WITH NATIONAL PENSION PLAN ISSUE
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Nov.  14 (CNA)
(By Luis Huang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A legislator from the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) called on voters Sunday to support the
party's candidates in the year-end legislative elections in order to
see the establishment of a national pension system as soon as
possible.
</P>
<P>
Tsai Huang-liang, whip of the DPP's legislative caucus, said that
the Legislative Yuan has failed to deliberate a draft bill on the
establishment of a national pension program submitted by the
Executive Yuan because the legislature is controlled by the
opposition "pan-blue alliance" of the Kuomintang (KMT) and the People
First Party.
</P>
<P>
Tsai said that if the "pan-green camp" of the DPP and the Taiwan
Solidarity Union can win a majority in the Legislative Yuan in the
Dec. 11 elections, he is convinced that senior citizens will stand a
good chance of receiving a monthly pension of NT$7,500 (US$228).
</P>
<P>
It is an established policy of the DPP-led government to
establish a national pension system, Tsai stressed, adding that the
Executive Yuan had brought forward a related draft bill to the
legislature for approval as early as in 2002.
</P>
<P>
Tsai's remarks came one day after President Chen Shui-bian
reiterated at a Saturday campaign rally for DPP legislative
candidates in central Taiwan the determination of his administration
to push for early legislation of a national pension system.
</P>
<P>
President Chen said that if the "pan-green camp" wins a majority
in the legislature, then the monthly subsidy for citizens aged 65 and
older will be raised to NT$7,500 (US$227).
</P>
<P>
In reply to the president's remarks, Tseng Yung-chuan, executive
director of the KMT Central Policy Committee, said it is the DPP
legislative caucus that has not worked actively to push for the draft
bill because they are worried the clause that citizens below the age
of 65 must pay NT$600 monthly into the pension system will have a
negative impact on the DPP candidates' chances in the Dec. 11
elections.
</P>
<P>
Pointing out that the only session to review the bill was
convened by KMT Legislator Hsu Chung-hsiung in 2003 after the bill
was submitted by the Executive Yuan in 2002, Tseng said the
president's words are just a campaign ploy to trick voters into
casting their ballots for DPP candidates.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the KMT legislative caucus has brought forward its
own version of a national pension plan, under which citizens will
only have to pay monthly fees of NT$480 and will be entitled to
NT$10,000 per month after they reach the age of 65, Tseng urged
voters to support "pan-blue alliance" legislative candidates in the
year-end elections.

ARMS BUDGET SHOULD BE SLASHED TO IMPROVE SOCIAL WELFARE: KMT CHIEF
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Nov. 14 (CNA)
(By Luis Huang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Lien
Chan on Sunday blasted the Democratic Progressive Party
administration's NT$610.8 billion (US$18.23 billion) arms procurement
special budget plan, saying defense spending should be cut to provide
more funds for the welfare of disadvantaged groups.
</P>
<P>
While stumping for a KMT candidate for the year-end legislative
elections in Hsintien City, Taipei County, Lien noted that Taiwan
must procure adequate arms systems to build up the nation's defense
capabilities, but added that arms procurement will be in vain if the
government fails to effectively deal with political, economic and
diplomatic affairs.
</P>
<P>
Lien noted that the special budget for arms procurement from the
United States should be slashed to help those who cannot afford to
pay lunch fees for their school children or national insurance
premiums. He added that since the DPP came to power in May 2000, the
nation's debt has risen to NT$4.2 trillion from less than NT$2
trillion when the KMT was in power.
</P>
<P>
Huang Chih-hsiung, a KMT candidate for an at-large legislative
seat and taekwondo silver medalist at the 2004 Athens Olympic Games,
was also present at the mass rally to mark the inauguration of KMT
candidate Lo Ming-tsai's campaign headquarters.
</P>
<P>
The KMT chairman called on voters to support Lo and Huang, who he
described as being "professional, vital, enthusiastic and efficient"
young men, in the Dec. 11 legislative elections.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Tseng Yung-chuan, executive director of the KMT
Central Policy Committee, also said that the proposed NT$610.8
billion special budget should be halved to subsidize social welfare
budgets.
</P>
<P>
Stressing that the KMT supports an arms procurement plan to be
carried out under the principles of transparency, rationality and
serviceability, Tseng noted that the proposed special budget
completely runs counter to the three principles.
</P>
<P>
Tseng noted that Premier Yu had said during a visit to Panama in
2002 that the arms procurement plan would cost only NT$280 billion,
but that after the March 20 presidential election, the budget for the
procurement plan skyrocketed to NT$610.8 billion.
</P>
<P>
He added that the KMT legislative caucus insists that the budget
be reduced by NT$300 billion, with the funds saved to be used to help
low-income families.
</P>
<P>
Tseng's remarks came one day after President Chen Shui-bian
condemned the opposition "pan-blue alliance" of the KMT and the
People First Party for boycotting the inclusion of the special arms
procurement budget bill on the agenda of the Legislative Yuan before
the legislature went into a one-month recess last Wednesday in
preparation for the Dec. 11 legislative elections.
</P>
<P>
The Executive Yuan proposed in June to buy six batteries of
Patriot-III anti-missile systems, eight diesel-electric submarines
and a squadron of 12 anti-submarine aircraft from the United States
with a NT$610.8 billion special budget to be paid for over a 15-year
period starting in 2005.

<P>
Singapore's Senior Minister Lee Kuan Yew is
welcome to visit the Republic of China-held frontline island of
Kinmen again, Kinmen County Magistrate Lee Chu-feng said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Lee Chu-feng extended his invitation to the influential former
Singaporean prime minister while meeting with Ker Sin Tze,
Singapore's resident representative to Taiwan, who was on a two-day
visit to Kinmen.
</P>
<P>
Lee Chu-feng recalled that Lee Kuan Yew made a visit to Kinmen on
Feb. 28, 1981 in the company of then-ROC President Chiang Ching-kuo.
</P>
<P>
"We welcome him to visit Kinmen again," Lee Chu-feng said, adding
that Lee Kuan Yew may be able to travel to Xiamen in mainland China's
Fujian Province from Kinmen via the direct "mini three links"
shipping route.
</P>
<P>
Ker said he will convey Lee Chu-feng's invitation to Lee Kuan
Yew.
</P>
<P>
Singapore has some 100,000 residents of Kinmen origin, Ker said,
adding that many of them have outstanding career achievements.
</P>
<P>
Lee Chu-feng told Ker that mainland Chinese authorities have
agreed to allow Fujian residents to make sightseeing trips to Kinmen
via direct voyage before the end of this year. The move will help
boost Kinmen's tourist and economic development, Lee Chu-feng said.
</P>
<P>
In addition to exchanging views with Lee on the development of
relations across the Taiwan Strait, Ker also toured major tourist
attractions and war relics in Kinmen, which lies closer to Fujian
than to Taiwan.

DPP NOT TO RECOMMEND CONTROL YUAN CANDIDATES
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Nov.  14 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The ruling Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) will not recommend any hopeful for the Control Yuan seats, a
senior party official said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
As Control Yuan members must transcend partisan stances and
maintain neutrality and impartiality in supervising government
operations in line with constitutional provisions, DPP
Secretary-General Chang Chun-hsiung said the DPP will refrain from
recommending any aspirant for Control Yuan seats.
</P>
<P>
"We'll give the new ombudsmen recommendation panel the greatest
possible room to select qualified hopefuls for President Chen
Shui-bian to nominate," Chang said.
</P>
<P>
Chang's announcement is part of the DPP's efforts to defuse
opposition parties' concern about the ruling party's possible
dominance of the selection of new ombudsmen.
</P>
<P>
The tenure of the current third-term Control Yuan members will
expire Jan. 31, 2005. President Chen Shui-bian is expected to
nominate 29 fourth-term Control Yuan members later this year.
According to the present version of the Additional Articles of the
Constitution, nominations for the Control Yuan require the consent of
the Legislative Yuan.
</P>
<P>
President Chen has named Vice President Annette Lu to serve as
convener of a special panel to screen the qualifications of hopefuls
recommended by various social or academic groups and come up with a
list of qualified aspirants for his reference.
</P>
<P>
In addition to Lu, the panel has five other members -- incumbent
Control Yuan President Fredrick Chien and Presidential Office
Secretary-General Su Tseng-chang, as well as Chang Chien-pang, a
senior adviser to the president, Hsiao Hsin-huang, a national policy
adviser to the president, and Nita Ing, chairwoman of Taiwan
High-Speed Railway, who is also an adviser to the president. Chien
has made clear that he will retire from public service after his
current tenure expires.
</P>
<P>
During a luncheon with other panelists and incumbent Control Yuan
members Friday, Lu said she will see to it that the recommendation
panel abides by the principles of openness, transparency,
impartiality and fairness in recommending candidates for the Control
Yuan seats.
</P>
<P>
Lu further said the panel's ultimate goal is to recommend those
most qualified and suitable to serve in the Control Yuan -- the
nation's supreme watchdog body responsible for correcting officials
at all levels and generally monitoring the government.

LONG-TERM STABILITY REQUIRES EFFORTS FROM BOTH SIDES: ROC OFFICIAL
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Geneva,  Nov. 14 (CNA)
(By C.H. Lu and P.C. Tang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A senior Presidential Office official said
Sunday in Geneva that maintaining a durable stability in the Taiwan
Strait requires efforts from both sides of the strait, rather than
just unilateral actions by Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Hung Chih-fang, deputy secretary-general of the Presidential
Office, made the comments while explaining the current state of
cross-Taiwan Strait relations to foreign affairs experts attending
the International Crisis Group's (ICG's) meeting of its board being
held in Geneva Nov. 13-15. Huang is a Taiwan member of the ICG board.
</P>
<P>
The Brussels-based group, an independent non-profit organization
working to prevent conflict via field-based analysis and high level
advocacy, includes prominent political, diplomatic, business and
media figures from countries around the world, and is currently
chaired by former Finish President Martti Ahtisaari.
</P>
<P>
Despite the fact that the ICG has not officially discussed
cross-strait issues at the meeting as it considers that there is
currently no crisis in the Taiwan Strait, Hung still took the
opportunity to urge the international community to pay heed to the
cross-strait problems.
</P>
<P>
Pointing out that cross-strait relations have basically not
deteriorated over the past four years, Hung said that this is because
Taiwan has demonstrated goodwill in wanting to have better relations
with mainland China and has not provoked the mainland nor attempted
to change the status quo.
</P>
<P>
However, he also pointed out that there hasn't been an
improvement in cross-strait relations during this period, stressing
that long-term stability in the Taiwan Strait requires joint efforts
by Taipei and Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Without mainland China's cooperation, it is impossible for the
two sides of the Taiwan Strait to engage in dialogue, Huang
emphasized.
</P>
<P>
Huang is scheduled to leave Monday for London en route back to
Taipei.

MOFA WELCOMES VANUATU CABINET'S APPROVAL OF FORMAL TIES WITH TAIWAN
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Nov.  15 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA)
expressed welcome Monday to the Vanuatuan Cabinet's approval of the
joint communique that Vanuatuan Prime Minister Serge Vohor and ROC
Foreign Minister Tan Sun Chen signed in Taipei Nov. 3 on the
establishment of formal diplomatic relations between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
The Vanuatu Council of Ministers' approval Monday reaffirmed the
validity of the formal diplomatic ties between Taiwan and the South
Pacific island country, MOFA spokesman Michel Lu said.
</P>
<P>
Currently, Taiwan diplomatic personnel in Vanuatu are exchanging
views with Prime Minister Vohor on substantive and technical matters
surrounding the newly-established diplomatic relations, including the
establishment of embassies in each other's country, Lu said.
</P>
<P>
Sources from the Vanuatu capital of Port-Vila said Monday that
the Vanuatuan Council of Ministers gave its consent to the communique
recognizing Taiwan as a formal diplomatic ally, although several
ministers had expressed concerns that switching diplomatic
recognition from Beijing to Taipei may affect Vanuatu's relations
with mainland China.
</P>
<P>
It was also learned that Prime Minister Vohor will make a
television address to the nation later Monday to formally announce
the government's decision on establishing formal diplomatic relations
with Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Beijing has been working since Nov. 3 to get Vanuatu to drop its
decision to establish formal diplomatic ties with the ROC. It has
claimed that Vohor's signing of the joint communique with Foreign
Minister Chen in Taipei was a"personal act" without the prior
approval of the Vanuatuan government.
</P>
<P>
Mainland Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Zhang Qiyue also
claimed at a news conference last week that Vanuatu's Cabinet "has
decided to revoke the so-called communique on the establishment of
diplomatic relations between Vanuatu and Taiwan."
</P>
<P>
According to MOFA officials, it is believed that People's
Republic of China Ambassador to Vanuatu Bao Shusheng will continue to
negotiate with the Vanuatuan government to try to get it to drop its
decision, and that Beijing may choose to sever formal ties with
Vanuatu shortly based on its "one China" policy if Bao is not given a
satisfactory answer.
</P>
<P>
With a population of about 210,000, Vanuatu lies 2,250 kilometers
northeast of Sydney, Australia. It is the ROC's 27th diplomatic ally.

TAIWAN NEEDS BETTER  CRISIS MANAGEMENT ON WATER RESOURCES
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Nov.  15 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taiwan must improve its water resources
crisis management in the face of frequent natural disasters and
accidents, participants at a seminar said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a seminar attended by experts and specialists from
Taiwan and the United States on business, engineering and technology,
Yang Wei-pu, chief engineer with the Cabinet-level Water Resources
Agency, said a spate of typhoons and accidents over the past year has
shown the need for crisis management involving dams, reservoirs and
catchments.
</P>
<P>
Yang mentioned some of the problems: pipelines connecting the
Nanhua Reservoir in southern Taiwan ruptured; a reservoir in the
outlying island of Kinmen was contaminated with rat poison in June; a
floodgate failed at the Liyutan Reservoir in central Taiwan during a
typhoon in early July; and the turbidity of the water in the Shihmen
Reservoir in Taoyuan County became unprecedentedly high after Typhoon
Aere pounded northern Taiwan with record rainfall in August.
</P>
<P>
Also speaking at the seminar -- formally known as the 2004
Biannual ROC-USA Business Conference and the Modern Engineering and
Technology Seminar 2004 -- Dr. Chein-chi Chang from the United States
said that Taiwan and America are different in terms of water
resources crisis management.
</P>
<P>
While the U. S. government has striven to protect the security of
dams around the United States from terrorist attacks, Taiwan
authorities should pay closer attention to reservoir safety, mainly
against damage caused by natural disasters, Chang noted.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Junn-ling Chao, also from the United States, has 40 years of
experience in tap water engineering and sewage systems. He took tap
water as an example to explain that every junction, ranging from
catchments to water tanks, of a running water system is crucial in
terms of water safety and security since errors or accidents could
happen anywhere along the line.
</P>
<P>
As to the issue of water pipeline ruptures, Chao said that water
companies should have their own information, detection and monitoring
systems, plus maintenance personnel in addition to guards and
firefighting and medical units to maintain safe and efficient water
supplies.
</P>
<P>
Chao suggested that Taiwan reservoir authorities use computers to
monitor areas susceptible to ruptures and work out crisis management
policies by simulating failures in computer models.

TAIWAN ENJOYS SUPERB ADVANTAGES IN CHINESE DIGITAL CONTENT
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Nov. 15 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taiwan has unique advantages when it comes
to Chinese digital content, an information official pointed out
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Huang Kuo-chun, executive vice president of the semi-official
Institute for Information Technology, made the remarks during the
opening of the two-day, 27th biennial ROC-USA conference and the 20th
modern engineering and technology seminar 2004.
</P>
<P>
Huang said that it is estimated that by 2006, digital content
market will have a production value of NT$370 billion (US$11.2
billion) and Taiwan has the opportunity to become the design,
development and integration center of Chinese digital content.
</P>
<P>
He noted that Taiwan has considerable advantages in leading the
Chinese digital content market, citing as an example that Taiwan has
accumulated considerable capital, talented workers and technology in
the information industry over the years, and has established an
industry chain that has combined the IT upper- and lower-stream
sectors.
</P>
<P>
"This experience can be transplanted to the digital content
industry, " he said, saying that it will be a great help to Taiwan's
entry into the digital content market.
</P>
<P>
In addition, he noted that Taiwan culture is a fertile breeding
ground for nurturing the digital content industry, noting that with
Taiwan's unique experience and geography, it has integrated
Chinese culture, the ocean culture of the aboriginal people, the
colonial culture of the Dutch, and the Western culture it has been
exposed to over the long term. These various cultures have converged
in Taiwan, he said.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, compared with Hong Kong, Singapore, Malaysia, and
Shanghai, Taiwan has the most democratic politics, open society and
pluralistic culture in the world, which are the main ingredients to
develop into a society centered on digital content, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that he believes Chinese around the world need a digital
content center, and Taiwan enjoys a unique edge in terms of
industrial, social and cultural conditions.
</P>
<P>
Since Taiwan has the edge in being of the same race and having
the same language as those on mainland China, he said that whether it
is European or American companies wanting to make inroads into the
Chinese market, or Chinese manufacturers wanting to enter the world
market, Taiwan can provide assistance and service closer to market
needs.
</P>
<P>
He concluded by saying that by 2006, Taiwan's digital content
industry will create a production value of N$370 billion, with 3,000
companies and 70,000 workers.

SOME CHILDREN OF CROSS-CULTURAL MARRIAGES HAVE DEVELOPMENT PROBLEMS
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Chiayi, Nov. 15 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
About 90 percent of the children of foreign
brides of Taiwan citizens suffer slowness in cognition and language
development, the Chiayi Christian Hospital (CCH) reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
CCH specialists called for the overseas spouses and their
Taiwanese families not to let these young children, the so-called
"new Taiwanese," miss the most crucial time of their treatment due to
the adults' ignorance or the language barrier.
</P>
<P>
About 300,000 foreign brides have arrived in Taiwan and their
number is increasing, mostly as a result of marriages arranged by
venal cross-border marriage brokers, CCH specialists said.
</P>
<P>
Under this system, overseas young women, mostly from poor
families in Southeast Asian countries, can fly into Taiwan within two
weeks or one month and become Taiwan citizens' wives in a very short
time, soon changing their roles from a young woman to a stranger's
wife, and a mother and daughter-in-law in a Taiwanese family.
</P>
<P>
Language barriers may be the root of many problems for foreign
brides in Taiwan -- ranging from intense husband-wife relations,
confrontations between them and their mothers-in-law, and adverse
impact on the education of their children -- but other factors,
including too short a time for the foreign brides to develop mutual
understanding with their Taiwanese families; big cultural
differences; and lack of social support, have also contributed to the
mothers of the "new Taiwanese" finding themselves in difficult
situations without satisfactory help, the specialists said.
</P>
<P>
Chiayi Christian Hospital, which grouped with 12 other social
groups and medical institutions to form the Around Taiwan Health Care
Alliance this year, recently conducted a poll of therapists of
early-stage treatment, psychologists, and social work specialists
around the island to further investigate the plight of foreign brides
and their "new Taiwanese" children.
</P>
<P>
The poll found that 62 percent of the respondents believe that
social psychological factors are the prime reason causing the "new
Taiwanese" to suffer in their development.
</P>
<P>
Some 37 percent of the respondents pointed to congenital diseases
and genetic abnormalities as reasons behind the cognitive and
language slowness.

PRESIDENT WILL NOT ASSIGN BLAME FOR 'SOFT COUP': TOP AIDE
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Nov. 15 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President Chen Shui-bian has no intention
of assigning culpability for what he alleges was a "soft coup"
attempt after the presidential election and only seeks to put an end
to the chaos of the nation via the ballot box in the Dec. 11
legislative elections, the president's top aide said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Su Tseng-chang, secretary-general of the Presidential Office, was
referring to President Chen's remarks Sunday when he was stumping for
legislative candidates of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) who will compete in the Dec. 11 elections in Taipei County.
</P>
<P>
The president first attacked the opposition "pan-blue alliance"
of the Kuomintang (KMT) and the People First Party (PFP) for being
unwilling to concede defeat in the March 20 presidential election. He
then proceeded to say that after the election, there was a
reported "seven-day coup" wherein several retired ranking generals
advised active generals to resign or go on sick leave.
</P>
<P>
This, the president said, was not a military coup, but a "soft
coup."
</P>
<P>
Chen said that if they had been successful, the consequences
would have been unthinkable.
</P>
<P>
Su agreed that after the presidential election, some in the
opposition camp tried to lobby active generals to resign to create a
social disturbance. "This was by no means just a rumor, as such an
atmosphere did in fact exist," Su added.
</P>
<P>
"This shows that Taiwan's drive to separate political affiliation
with military effectiveness has been successful. Taiwan's military
and generals now pledge their allegiance to the nation, and
democratic development has solidly taken root," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that compared with the "pan-blue alliance" who mobilized
supporters to demonstrate in front of the Presidential Office and who
have distributed "bulletgate" pamphlets over the election-eve
shooting of President Chen in an attempt to smear the president, the
military generals have more democratic training.
</P>
<P>
Premier Yu Shyi-kun also said that since the presidential
election, the KMT and the PFP have "used every means" to fight the
result, including the relatively little-used attempt of a "soft
coup."
</P>
<P>
Regarding any evidence to support the president's theory of a
"soft coup, " or whether the government has a list of the retired
generals who were alleged to have been pulling the strings behind the
"coup attempt, " the premier said only that he has kept abreast of
the matter and he has been in close contact with the president since
that time, adding, "Some parts are not appropriate to make public
now."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the KMT lashed out at the president's remarks as
"despicable," urging him to publish evidence to back up his claim.
</P>
<P>
Huang Teh-fu, KMT whip in the Legislative Yuan, said that if the
president has evidence to substantiate his words, he should produce
it, instead of wantonly smearing opposition parties.
</P>
<P>
He wondered how the Ministry of National Defense could put up
with remarks so damaging to its image, saying that the ministry
should get tough and fight against such slander.
</P>
<P>
Liu Wen-hsiung, PFP whip in the legislature, called President
Chen's "coup" wording is his own "fantasy," and said if Chen knew the
truth behind the coup, why hasn't he arrested those responsible?
</P>
<P>
President Chen said in his speech at the anniversary celebration
of a senior high school in Chiayi, southern Taiwan April 25 that with
god's blessing of the nation, he was able to pass three major
hurdles: surviving the March 19 shooting, winning the March 20
presidential election by a narrow margin, and surviving the
"seven-day coup" after March 20.

PRESIDENT BUSH RECOGNIZES TAIWAN'S ECONOMIC ACHIEVEMENTS

<TEXT>
<P>
U.S. President George W. Bush has
recognized Taiwan's role in the global trade and economic system,
saying the island's financial reforms and high-tech industrial
development have created abundant business opportunities for business
people from both countries.
</P>
<P>
Bush made the commendation in a congratulatory message read at the
opening of an ROC-USA economic conference and modern engineering and
technology seminar being held at the Taipei International Convention
Center.
</P>
<P>
In his written message, Bush lauded Taiwan for its relentless
efforts to promote industrial upgrading and international trade.
Nowadays, Bush said, Taiwan plays an important role in global
trade and economics. Bush also praised Taiwan's achievements
in democratic development and its continued efforts in financial
reforms and high-tech industrial development.
</P>
<P>
President Chen Shui-bian also issued a written message marking
the opening of the two-day conference which brought together many
high-tech industry executives, crisis management experts and trade
promoters from Taiwan and the United States to discuss a range of
relevant topics.
</P>
<P>
At a time when the global economy faces challenges from rising
oil prices and terrorist attacks, Chen said he hopes the conference
participants can offer valuable advice and initiatives to help Taiwan
break bottlenecks in high-tech development and further boost
Taiwan-U.S. trade and economic cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Douglas Paal, director of the Taipei office of the American
Institute in Taiwan, which represents U.S. interests in Taiwan in the
absence of formal diplomatic ties, delivered a speech at the opening
ceremony.
</P>
<P>
Paal said the United States has long been one of Taiwan's most
important trading partners. Although the United States is no longer
Taiwan's top export outlet, it remains Taiwan's second-largest market
and bilateral economic ties have gotten even closer through
technology transfers and the formation of joint-venture partnerships.
</P>
<P>
Wang Chung-yu, president of the ROC-USA Economic Council, which
organized the ongoing conference, said Taiwan is at a critical
juncture of industrial upgrading. He said he hopes the conference can
help formulate feasible strategies and measures to contribute to
Taiwan's high-tech industrial development and corporate restructuring
and crisis management.

Taiwan and the United States held their
annual bilateral talks on competition law Monday in Taipei, officials
from the Fair Trade Commission (FTC) said Monday.
</P>
<P>
FTC Vice Chairman Chen Chi-yuan and Makan Delrahim, vice director

exchanged experiences on their handling of anti-trust cases at the
conference, according to an anonymous FTC official.
</P>

The FTC official said Taiwan and the U.S. exchanges views on the
implementation of competition law regularly because the globalization
of trade has made the contents and enforcement of an individual
country's competition law a cause of concern of other countries.
</P>

As close trade partners, the bilateral conference is the fourth
of its kind, and FTC Chairman Huang Tsung-lo went to Washington, D.C.
for the conference last year.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Taiwan Semiconductor Industry Association and the
US-Taiwan Business Council will jointly organize an Anti-trust

Vice President Annette Lu called on the
hi-tech sector to help Taiwan build up "soft power" Monday.

Lu said the 21st Century is an era for cooperation and sharing,
which she said are the characteristics of technological industries.

Lu urged the hi-tech sector to help the country expand its
foreign relations and integrate with the cultural and creative
sectors to face "the era of knowledge warfare."
</P>

TOMBS FOR TWO LATE PRESIDENTS SET FOR COMPLETION NEXT JUNE
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Nov.  15 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Tombs for the late President Chiang
Kai-shek and his son and successor Chiang Ching-kuo in Taipei County
are scheduled to be completed by late June, the Ministry of National
Defense (MND) said Monday.
</P>
<P>
The MND's Bureau of Armament and Acquisition (BAA) said that after
many twists and turns, the process of bidding and contract operations
for the tombs have finally been completed.
</P>
<P>
Geographical surveys will next have to be carried out to ensure
soil conservation, while at the same time, design work will be done
and approval obtained from the families of the two late presidents.
</P>
<P>
The widow of Chiang Ching-kuo sent a letter to the MND early this
year asking it to help with the relocation of the two Chiangs -- who
are embalmed in interim mausoleums in Taoyuan, northern Taiwan -- to
the Wutzushan military cemetery in Hsichih, Taipei County, for
permanent interment.
</P>
<P>
After the approval of President Chen Shui-bian, the MND, the
Ministry of the Interior and various other government agencies began
to plan for the relocation and burial in line with the state funeral
law. The BAA was in charge of the bidding and contracting operations.
</P>
<P>
These failed several times, and there were also heated debates on
whether to have state funerals for the two Chiangs before the issue
was hammered out.
</P>
<P>
It is understood that the MND's Combined Logistics Command, which
is in charge of the Wutzushan military cemetery, known for its serene
and beautiful views, offered three sites, sized 950, 1,200 and 250
pings (one ping is equal to 3.3 square meters) . The two larger plots
are on hilly terrain and pose difficulties in construction, while the
smaller one is on flatter ground, which is the one chosen by the
families.
</P>
<P>
Chiang Kai-shek fled to Taiwan in 1949 after losing the Chinese
mainland to the Mao Zedong-led communist party in a bloody civil war.
He died in 1975 and his remains were embalmed in a temporary
mausoleum at Tzuhu in Taoyuan, awaiting a proper burial on the
mainland.
</P>
<P>
Chiang ruled Taiwan with an iron fist, using martial law to
suppress democracy. However, some view him as a hero for keeping the
island out of reach of the Chinese communists and claim that it was
he who fostered Taiwan's freewheeling market economy.
</P>
<P>
Chiang Ching-kuo is respected for ending martial law in 1987,
shortly before his death, thus unleashing the democratic forces that
broke his family's firm grip on power and eventually ended the
Kuomintang's half-century of rule over Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Chiang died in 1988 and his remains also lie embalmed in an
interim mausoleum at Touliao in Taoyuan.

TAIWAN IS BRIGHT STAR IN ECONOMIC SHOWING: WEF ECONOMIST

<TEXT>
<P>
With the world's fourth-most competitive
economy and the first in Asia, Taiwan is a bright star in terms of
its economic achievements, a World Economic Forum (WEF) economist
said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Augusto Lopez-Claros, chief economist and director of the WEF's
Global Competitiveness Programme, made the remarks in a speech in
Taipei, citing the latest Global Competitiveness Report released by
the WEF in October.
</P>
<P>
Lopez-Claros said that according to the report, Taiwan's
performance has been brilliant, especially in the field of
technological development.
</P>
<P>
While Taiwan's technological development has expedited the
country's economic development over the past two decades, the
island's technology index now ranks second in the world after the
United States, Lopez-Claros pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Despite the small size of the country, Taiwan has a thriving IT
industry, with some products taking up to 60-percent shares of the
global market, he said.
</P>
<P>
However, he said there is still room for improvement in Taiwan's
government sector, suggesting that Taiwan work to solve the problems
of deficit and emigration of businesses.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan moved up a notch to fourth place this year in terms of the
WEF's Growth Competitiveness Index, according to the WEF report.
</P>
<P>
The nation scored second in technology competitiveness, an
advance of one notch from last year, and it grabbed ninth spot in
terms of its macro-economic situation, an improvement from 18th place
last year.
</P>
<P>
But it lost ground in terms of the quality of public
institutions, falling to 27th from 21st.

FORMER CZECH PRESIDENT TO ARRIVE FRIDAY FOR SIX-DAY VISIT
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Nov.  15 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Former Czech Republic President Vaclav
Havel and his wife will arrive in Taipei Friday for a six-day visit,
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) announced Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Havels are coming to Taiwan at the invitation of President
Chen Shui-bian and the Taiwan Foundation for Democracy, MOFA
officials said.
</P>
<P>
During his stay, Havel will meet with Chen, Vice President
Annette Lu, academics and literary figures. Chen will decorate him
with a medal in recognition of his contribution to the promotion of
Taiwan-Czech Republic ties and his versatile career achievements,
particularly his courage in keeping alive the "flame of democracy"
when his country was under communist rule.
</P>
<P>
Havel will also deliver a speech and receive an honorary
doctorate from National Chengchi University. His itinerary also
includes meetings with local academics, artists and literary
celebrities.
</P>
<P>
A resourceful man, Havel has had multifaceted roles throughout
his career -- a poet, playwright, dissident, thinker and politician.
He formally ended his 12-year presidency in February 2003.
</P>
<P>
After his retirement, MOFA officials said, Havel immediately
planned to visit Taiwan. But he later chose to stay in his country to
help stabilize the domestic political situation following the
transfer of power. Early this year, Havel planned to visit Taiwan and
several other Asian countries to promote his new book. However, his
Asian tour stopped in India and he canceled the remaining itinerary
due to health reasons.
</P>
<P>
Havel played a pivotal role in his country's "velvet revolution"
of 1989. He used his literary and theatrical creations to kindle and
keep the flame of democracy burning amidst a storm of repression and
autocracy during communist rule. He eventually led his country to
break the shackles of communist suppression and move toward
democracy. During his presidency, he continued working hard to
consolidate the Czech Republic's democratic system as well as promote
human rights and social justice, earning wide respect and admiration
from his fellow countrymen.
</P>
<P>
MOFA officials said Havel has been very friendly toward Taiwan
because of his conviction in democracy and courage in standing up to
mainland China's pressure.
</P>
<P>
During his presidency, Havel invited then-ROC President Lee
Teng-hui to attend an international forum in Prague. Incumbent ROC
first lady Wu Shu-chen and former Vice President Lien Chan have also
visited the Czech Republic. In 1995, Havel spoke for Taiwan's bid to
join the United Nations at an annual U.N. General Assembly plenary
session. He is one of the few world leaders willing to publicly throw
support behind Taiwan without fearing Beijing's backlash.
</P>
<P>
To welcome Havel's visit, Taipei National University of the Arts
has designated November as its "Month of Vaclav Havel Art." In
addition to performing Havel's plays, the university has also
organized many other activities during the period of Nov. 5-24,
including a Havel book fair and a series of seminars on Havel's
artistic and political achievements, as well as a Czech film
festival.

DECISION ON WHETHER TO SUSPEND TRUTH COMMISSION TO BE MADE DEC. 15
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Nov.  15 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Council of Grand Justices decided
Monday to hand down its decision Dec. 15 on whether to suspend the
Truth Investigation Commission as requested by lawmakers of the
ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP).
</P>
<P>
The commission, formed under a statute crafted and railroaded
through the Legislative Yuan by the opposition parties, has been
branded unconstitutional by the DPP, whose lawmakers asked the
Council of Grand Justices to rule on its constitutionality and to
suspend its operations until a final ruling on its constitutionality
has been made.
</P>
<P>
DPP lawmakers claim that the commission, set up to investigate
the March 19 shooting of President Chen Shui-bian, infringes on the
constitutional power of other government agencies and should be
suspended immediately.
</P>
<P>
The council, which is responsible for interpreting the
Constitution, has never been asked to suspend the operation of any
commission with such urgency and have sought opinions from the
attorneys of the DPP lawmakers about its authority to do so.
</P>
<P>
The council decided after a meeting earlier the day to come up
with a decision on whether to suspend the commission Dec. 15 and to
rule on whether the statute is invalid by Dec. 30.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Shih Chi-yang, the convener of the Truth Investigation
Commission, shrugged off the news, saying he will press on with the
investigation regardless of the Council of the Grand Justices'
decision.

60% OF PARENTS UNSURE OF GLOBAL COMPETITIVE EDGE OF THEIR CHILDREN

<TEXT>
<P>
More and more parents are having their
children learn English at an early age, hoping to foster their
competitive edge in the world, although over 60 percent said they are
not confident they will achieve their goal, according to the results
of a survey released Monday.
</P>
<P>
The prestigious Commonwealth Magazine conducted the survey in
mid-October to try to learn about the global perspective of Taiwan
residents and parents' attitude toward English learning for their
children. The monthly sampled residents over the age of 18 on the
first question, collecting 1,079 effective replies, while asking
parents with children under 12 on the second, obtaining 763 effective
samples.
</P>
<P>
On English learning, parents with higher academic background tend
to have their children learn English earlier, with 54.3 percent of
parents with masters degrees sending their children to study English
at nursery school or even earlier.
</P>
<P>
Sixty-one percent of the parents also think it is better to study
English at an early age, while 78 percent said good English is
important for a child's future.
</P>
<P>
The survey also found that over 60 percent of Taiwan people have
been overseas, with 90 percent of the respondents having been
elsewhere in Asia and 29 percent having been to North America. Only 2
percent had been to the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 90 percent go abroad for travel, 16 percent for work, 6
percent to visit family members and only 2 percent for studying.
</P>
<P>
Sixty-two percent of those polled cited the best part of their
foreign experience as broadening their horizons, followed by 44
percent who cited enhancement of their understanding of other
cultures.
</P>
<P>
The survey also found that nearly 80 percent did not know the
location of the United Nations headquarters, 60 percent did not know
Athens is in Europe, and over half were unaware that the mainland
Chinese President is Hu Jintao.
</P>
<P>
The international events Taiwan people are familiar with are
mostly related to wars, with 80 percent of the respondents aware that
the U.S. led an attack on Iraq last year and 77 percent aware that
the United States dropped atomic bombs in Japan near the end of the
Second World War.
</P>
<P>
Knowledge of wars was followed by economic issues, with nearly 50
percent aware of the World Trade Organization and 42 percent aware
that Germany now uses the euro as its currency.
</P>
<P>
Overall, the survey found that 73 percent of the respondents
believe their global competitive capability is insufficient.

Hou Sheng-mao, director of the department
of medicine of National Taiwan University (NTU) , has been tapped to
serve as vice minister of the Department of Health (DOH) , Cabinet
spokesman Chen Chi-mai said Monday.
</P>
<P>
According to Chen Chi-mai, DOH Minister Chen Chien-jen will soon
complete the formalities regarding the appointment of Hou as his
deputy.
</P>
<P>
Hou, a noted orthopedic physician, will fill the position left
vacant by Chang Hung-jen who resigned last month amid controversy
over national health insurance-related reform measures.
</P>
<P>
Media reports said Hou is a mentor of President Chen Shui-bian's
son-in-law, Chao Chien-ming, who is now an orthopedic physician at
NTU Hospital. The reports further speculated that Hou will be
promoted to the position of DOH minister at the end of this year,
when Chen Chien-jen returns to his NTU teaching position.
</P>
<P>
Chen Chi-mai dismissed the reports, pointing out that as the
Cabinet will resign en masse before the Feb. 1 inauguration of the
new Legislative Yuan to be elected Dec. 11, it is meaningless to
speculate as to who will be the next DOH minister.

About 1,000 aborigines clashed with police
in a demonstration in front of the Executive Yuan Monday in which
several police officers, including one draftee serving alternative
military service in the police force, suffered bruising.
</P>
<P>
The protesters, led by an aboriginal lawmaker, were demonstrating
to protest against what they claim is the Executive Yuan's failure to
provide enough funds for the rebuilding of roads in mountainous
areas that were ravaged by flooding earlier this year.
</P>

The clashes occurred when the protesters tried to enter the
Executive Yuan and were prevented from doing so by about 300 police
officers and draftees. None of the reported injuries were serious.

CANADA'S NATIONAL SCIENCE ADVISOR CALLS FOR COOPERATION WITH TAIWAN
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,   Nov.  15  (CNA)
(By Huang Kwang-chun)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Canada-Taiwan technology and trade
cooperation should be enhanced to create mutually beneficial
opportunities, Canada's National Science Advisor Arthur Carty
suggested Monday.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a luncheon jointly hosted by the Canadian Trade Office
in Taipei and the Chinese International Economic Cooperation
Association, Carty said Canada has been vigorously promoting
technological development by setting national strategies in emerging
areas -- nanotechnology, quantum information technology,
biotechnology and alternative energy technologies -- which he said
are also priorities listed by Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
He introduced Canada as a dynamic and comprehensive economy and
said that it is open for global business, while praising Taiwan for
its performance in trade and technology development.
</P>
<P>
"I am very pleased that the collaboration between Canada and
Taiwan in science and technology has created economic growth, high
quality of life and opportunities for our citizens," Carty said.
</P>
<P>
Carty, a frequent visitor to Taiwan, arrived in Taiwan a day
earlier for a three-day visit. He is a leader in the development of
research collaboration involving Canada's National Research Council
(NRC) and Taiwan's National Science Council.
</P>
<P>
Before being appointed National Advisor on Science and Technology
to the Prime Minister in April 2004, Carty was the NRC president.
</P>
<P>
The purpose of his present visit to Taiwan is to share
information about the state of scientific and technological
development in Canada, to recognize the thriving science and
technology relationship between Canada and Taiwan, to further explain
the global reach of Canada's international collaboration initiatives
involving prominent research organizations, agencies and institutions
worldwide, and to promote two-way investment, as well as other
commercial partnerships between Canada and Taiwan, according to the
Canadian Trade Office in Taipei.

<TEXT>
<P>
More than 600 black-faced spoonbills have
flown from the Korean peninsula to the Chiku wetlands in the southern
county of Tainan to overwinter, local wildlife conservationists said
Monday.
</P>
<P>
As of Monday, 617 of the highly endangered wading birds had
arrived at the wetlands at the estuary of the Tsengwen river in
Tainan County, conservationists said, adding that the number accounts
for more than half of the total surviving population of the species.
</P>
<P>
According to the result of a global survey conducted in January
this year, only 1,206 black-faced spoonbills still survive in the
world.
</P>
<P>
The birds usually begin arriving in Taiwan to spend the winter
after the Mid-Autumn Festival and will make the return migration for
breeding between March and April the following year.
</P>
<P>
A record 750 black-faced spoonbills were recorded at the Chiku
wetlands Dec. 3, 2003 and birdwatchers said they believe more birds
will arrive as the temperature drops in the coming weeks.

<TEXT>
<P>
Vanuatu Prime Minister Serge Vohor has confirmed
his country's diplomatic ties with Taiwan in a letter to Minister of
Foreign Affairs Tan Sun Chen, Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesman
Michel Lu said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Lu said Vohor told Chen that Vanuatu finished the legal process
of recognizing Taiwan and the prime minister announced his
government's decision in a televised address earlier that day.
</P>
<P>
As for Vanuatu's relations with mainland China, Lu said Taiwan
will respect whatever decision is made by Vanuatu.
</P>
<P>
In light of the fact that there are about 20 mainland diplomats
who have not yet left the South Pacific island nation, Lu said it is
understandable that those people will try to destroy the ties between
Vanuatu and Taiwan and that the foreign ministry is guarding against
this.
</P>
<P>
Now that diplomatic ties with Vanuatu are confirmed, Lu said
Taiwan diplomats there will find a location for an embassy in the
hope of raising Taiwan's flag as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
Vohor signed an agreement to recognize Taiwan Nov. 3 while in
Taipei, but his Cabinet denied any knowledge of it and there were
conflicting reports about whether Vohor was empowered by his
government to recognize Taipei.

PFP URGES THAT AIR FARES NOT BE RAISED RASHLY
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Nov. 16 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The opposition People First Party (PFP) on
Tuesday urged air carriers to make public their cost structures for
air fares and to not rashly raise ticket prices during the current
Legislative Yuan recess.
</P>
<P>
PFP Legislator Hsu Yuan-kuo noted that the legislature is
currently in a one-month recess in preparation for the Dec. 11
legislative elections and that the price of crude oil in the world
market has dropped to around US$45 per barrel from a recent peak of
more than US$50 per barrel.
</P>
<P>
"This is not an appropriate time to raise air fares, especially
because the air carriers have not yet made public the cost structure
of air tickets," Hsu said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that raising air fares will lead to a series of price
hikes in the transportation sector. As global oil prices go down, the
price of air tickets should not be raised, and should instead be
lowered, he added.
</P>
<P>
Hsu's words came one day after the Civil Aeronautics
Administration (CAA) under the Ministry of Transportation and
Communications convened a review meeting on a proposal by air
carriers to raise air fares.
</P>
<P>
CAA Director General Chang Kuo-cheng noted that fuel price is
only one of the 14 items that air carriers use in calculating the
cost of air fares. With the continued rise in world crude oil prices,
the air carriers have complained that they have lost the profits they
earned in the first 10 months of this year, and have therefore asked
to hike air fares.
</P>
<P>
But review meeting members still had questions concerning the
relation between the rising oil prices and the level of air fare
hikes. They demanded that the air carriers provide them with more
detailed calculations before they discuss air fare hikes further.
</P>
<P>
PFP Legislator Lee Hung-chun noted that not only has there been
an upward price trend in air fares, water, electricity and gas, there
has been in an upward trend in the consumer price index, which rose
2.36 percent in October.
</P>
<P>
Directorate General of the Budget, Accounting and Statistics
tallies show that wholesale prices increased by 12 percent in October
over the same month a year earlier, or the biggest jump in over 23
years, which Lee said shows that inflationary pressures still exist.
</P>
<P>
Lee Tung-hao, acting director of the PFP Policy Center, said that
the party suspects the government will have to raise taxes in the
next three years because of financial difficulties.
</P>
<P>
He said Executive Yuan spokesman Chen Chi-mai's recent comment
that "the government currently has no plan to raise taxes" was only a
way of avoiding the question of whether the government could raise
taxes in the future.

TAIWAN RANKS 6TH IN NUMBER OF STUDENTS IN U.S.
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Washington,   Nov.  15  (CNA)
(By Wennie Chi and Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The number of Taiwan students
registered in schools in the United States between 2003-2004 was 6.6
percent lower than the previous year, making Taiwan the sixth largest
source of foreign students in the United States, the Institute of
International Education (IIE) reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The IIE's latest statistics showed that Indian students ranked
first in terms of numbers, followed by mainland Chinese students.
</P>
<P>
Among 26,178 Taiwan students registered in U.S. schools, 57.4
percent are studying in graduate schools, while 32.4 percent are
studying in undergraduate programs at universities, and the remaining
10.2 percent are studying at other institutions.
</P>
<P>
The report showed that the number of Taiwan students going to the
United States has been on the decline in recent years. Between 1993
and 1994, the number of Taiwan students peaked at 37,581. Between
1987 and 1988, Taiwan students topped all foreign students in the
United States in terms of numbers. Mainland Chinese students topped
the list between 1988 and 1989.
</P>
<P>
The report analyzed that the number of foreign students studying
in the Unites States recorded negative growth for the first time in
between 2003-2004 mainly because it has become more difficult to
obtain student visas following the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks
on the United States, especially for those students in the science
and technology fields.
</P>
<P>
The active recruiting campaign to woo foreign students by other
English-speaking countries such as the Australia and Britain has also
cut the number of students going to the United States, according to
the report.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the tuition fees of U.S. universities have been
rising, the report added.

<P>
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) on
Tuesday extended Taiwan's recognition and appreciation to outgoing
U.S. Secretary of State Colin Powell for his efforts at enhancing
Taiwan-U.S. relations during his four years in office.
</P>
<P>
MOFA spokesman Michel Lu pointed out that Powell has praised the
democratic development of Taiwan on various occasions and has
reaffirmed Washington's commitment to defending Taiwan according to
the Taiwan Relations Act (TRA).
</P>
<P>
Powell has also praised Taiwan as a success story and has
supported Taiwan's bid to participate in international organizations,
including the World Health Organization, Lu added.
</P>
<P>
The ministry believes Powell's departure will not affect the
development of relations between the two countries, which share
identical values in terms of freedom, democracy and human rights, and
which maintain close cooperation in economics and trade as well as in
anti-terrorism efforts, Lu said.
</P>
<P>
Lu, however, would not comment on Powell's possible successor on
the grounds that this is an internal affair of the United States.
</P>
<P>
Lu said the ministry believes that relations between Taipei and
Washington will continue to develop under the framework of the TRA
regardless of who is appointed as the next secretary of state.
</P>

The White House confirmed Monday that Powell had tendered his
resignation.

PRESIDENT CHEN HAILS HU JINTAO'S REMARKS AS 'SIGNALING GOODWILL'
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Nov. 16 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President Chen Shui-bian on Tuesday hailed
mainland Chinese President Hu Jintao's recent remarks as containing
signs of goodwill that give weight to Taiwan's expectations of a thaw
in relations across the Taiwan Strait.
</P>
<P>
Chen made the statement while meeting at the Presidential Office
with a group of overseas Chinese community leaders from western
Canada and the United States.
</P>
<P>
Hu is currently in Brazil on the first leg of his official visit
to several South American countries that will also take him to
Argentina and Chile. He was quoted as having told mainland Chinese
community leaders in Rio de Janeiro Monday that mainland China's
development comes ahead of cross-Taiwan Strait unification issues on
his government's agenda.
</P>
<P>
President Chen said he felt that Hu's remarks signalled "some
goodwill toward the expectation of a gradual thaw in the lingering
cross-strait stalemate."
</P>
<P>
Chen added that he noticed that Beijing had refrained from using
some of its stock rhetorical phases regarding Taiwan in a news
release issued the previous day.
</P>
<P>
"In the latest Beijing news release, we found some signs of
goodwill that we are paying close attention to, " Chen said, adding
that he takes this as mainland China's initial response to the
10-point conclusion reached at a National Security Council (NSC)
meeting chaired by him last Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Since his re-election, Chen said he has repeatedly extended olive
branches to Beijing in the hopes of resuming regular cross-strait
dialogue and normalizing bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
Noting that he unequivocally expounded on the aspirations of his
administration and of the Taiwan people for cross-strait
rapprochement in his May 20 inauguration speech for a second term and
in his Double Ten National Day address as well as in last Wednesday's
10-point NSC meeting conclusion, Chen said he intensely hopes Beijing
can make a goodwill response to open up a "window of opportunity" for
the future.
</P>
<P>
Chen assured the overseas Chinese community leaders that his
administration will continue to pursue normalization of cross-strait
relations with maximum goodwill, sincerity and patience.
</P>
<P>
"My administration will adopt effective measures to create an
environment favorable for cross-strait interaction and peaceful
development for the sake of regional stability and the people's
well-being," Chen said.
</P>
<P>
As a popularly elected president, Chen said, he is obligated to
safeguard the nation's sovereignty, dignity and security as well as
the 23 million Taiwan people's well-being.
</P>
<P>
In an attempt to defuse controversy over national identity
issues, Chen also took advantage of the occasion to call for support
for the Republic of China.
</P>
<P>
"The Republic of China's continued existence since 1911 is beyond
question. As the ROC's 11th-term president, I cannot tolerate any
questioning of the ROC's existence. During my tenure, I will not
allow any person to make the claim that the ROC no longer exists.
I'll dedicated myself to defending its sovereign status, dignity and
security," Chen added.

The U.S. government's policy toward

TAIWAN-AIDED ORPHANAGE OPENS IN BURKINA FASO

<P>
An orphanage built with support from
Taiwanese churches has been completed and opened earlier this month
in Burkina Faso, a Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) official said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
A 20-member delegation formed by the Glory Star Church in Taipei
and the Bread of Life Christian Church in Pingtung went to Burkina
Faso on Nov. 3 to attend the opening ceremony and established
sisterhood ties with churches in the African nation, according to
Patrick Chang, director of MOFA's Department of African Affairs.
</P>
<P>
Lien Chia-en, who is a medical school graduate and a member of
the Glory Star Church, started a fundraising campaign in Taiwan for
the construction of the orphanage a few years ago when he was serving
in Taiwan's medical mission in Burkina Faso as an alternative to
military service.
</P>
<P>
On finishing his service last year, he was hired to become a
staff physician at the mission and continued to work on the orphanage
project.
</P>
<P>
Chang said the completion of the orphanage shows that foreign
service as an alternative service has been a success.

The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) has
instructed its missions overseas to establish an urgent communication
network with 25 Taiwan nationals currently residing in the Ivory
Coast since military conflicts have broken out in the West African
country.
</P>
<P>
Chang Pei-chi, director of MOFA's Department of African Affairs,
noted that European and American countries have since Nov. 11 started
to evacuate their nationals.
</P>
<P>
He said that there are currently 25 Taiwan expatriates living in
the Ivory Coast, and that the ministry has asked an ROC office in the
Ivory Coast to establish an urgent communication network to execute
an evacuation if the situation deteriorates.
</P>
<P>
Chang noted that the office has urgently communicated with the
U.S. embassy in the Ivory Coast and secured their consent to help
evacuate Taiwan expatriates should such need arise, but Taiwan
expatriates are currently unwilling to leave because they want to
safeguard their investments in the country.
</P>
<P>
Chang also urged Taiwan people to refrain from traveling to the
Ivory Coast for the time being.
</P>
<P>
The Ivory Coast's government reopened the nation's civil war on

Ivory Coast war planes bombed a French peacekeeping post, killing
nine French troops and an American aid worker and plunging the

TAIWAN STEEL EXPORTS RISING: DGBAS
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Nov.  16 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taiwan's steel export value has been
growing every year and has topped its import value since 1996 to
account for 6.5 percent of the country's total outbound shipments
last year, according to government tallies.
</P>
<P>
The statistics compiled by the Cabinet-level Directorate General
of Budget, Accounting and Statistics (DGBAS) show that with rapid
development in the domestic steel industry in 1987, the sector's
outbound shipment value began to surpass its inbound shipment every
year since 1996 through 2003 at a double-digit rate, except for 2001,
when the United States was attacked by terrorists.
</P>
<P>
DGBAS officials attributed the domestic industry's boom in recent
years to strong demand from mainland China and the whole world. It
made the third-largest contribution in terms of output value to the
manufacturing sector only after those registered by the electronics
and the petroleum industries.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, more and more domestic steel makers are considering
relocating to the mainland in the face of higher labor costs and
tighter restrictions on greenhouse emissions, they said, adding that
mainland-bound investment by Taiwan companies approved by the
government for 2002 and 2003 totaled US$630 million and US$720
million, respectively.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, the recent strong appreciation of the
new Taiwan dollar has kept fierce pressure on domestic downstream
steel makers but is benefiting their upstream counterparts, industry
sources said.
</P>
<P>
Taking China Steel Corp. (CSC) , Taiwan's largest steel maker,
which heavily relies on imported materials, as an example, a stronger
new Taiwan dollar has helped it rack up a greater profit after having
gained in imports, they said, adding that an appreciating local
currency is definitely beneficial to upstream suppliers.
</P>
<P>
Like CSC, Tung Ho Steel, Feng Hsin Iron and Steel and others are
now awash in cash, they added.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, downstream companies will have greater
difficulties in acquiring materials and will have to absorb price
gaps without being able to fully pass on the costs to customers, they
noted.

INVOLVED OFFICERS CONFIRM 'SOFT COUP' ATTEMPT: PRESIDENT
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Nov. 16 (CNA)
(By Y.F. Low)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President Chen Shui-bian Tuesday defended
his claim concerning an opposition-backed "soft coup" attempt after
the March 20 presidential election, saying the military officers
contacted to join the operation had confirmed its existence.
</P>
<P>
Chen gave a detailed account of his claim at a ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) Central Standing Committee meeting after the
allegation, which he made over the weekend, drew strong protest from
the opposition "pan-blue alliance" of the Kuomintang (KMT) and People
First Party (PFP).
</P>
<P>
"After March 20, several retired generals tried to persuade
active generals to fake sickness or tender their resignations in an
attempt to upset the morale of the military and worsen social
disorder after the election," Chen said.
</P>
<P>
"This is not a made-up story. I have checked out the who, when
and where of the incident and the persons involved have also admitted
to it," Chen added.
</P>
<P>
Chen said the purpose of his raising the issue again was to let
the public understand how the "pan-blue alliance" had intended to
overturn the result of the election -- not only by instigating a mob
in front of the Presidential Office but also by fomenting a plot to
destabilize the government and the military.
</P>
<P>
The failure of the operation is also an example of the success of
the DPP government's efforts to nationalize the armed forces and
institutionalize the intelligence service since 2000, Chen said.
</P>
<P>
"In the past, the KMT always considered the military one of its
possessions.... Regrettably, the 'pan-blue alliance' and some retired
generals still retain this erroneous belief after the 2004
presidential election," Chen said.
</P>
<P>
It was a victory of democracy and the people that none of the
generals in service had been moved to take part in the plot, Chen
said.
</P>
<P>
Trying to justify his use of the term "soft coup, " Chen said the
expression is not an exaggeration in light of the critical situation
the country was facing in March.
</P>
<P>
In addition to inciting supporters to ram a district court in
Kaohsiung and occupy the boulevard in front of the Presidential
Office for an entire week after the election, "pan-blue alliance"
presidential candidates Lien Chan and James Soong hosted a series of
news conferences in which they urged foreign governments to intervene
in the election results, Chen said.
</P>
<P>
Chen said that while the "pan-blue alliance" called on the
military to join an "uprising" on Web sites and posters, it also
incited its supporters to storm the Central Election Commission
building March 26 to try to prevent the commission from proclaiming
his re-election.
</P>
<P>
This chain of events prompted the mainland Chinese authorities to
issue a statement saying that Beijing would not "sit idly" if the
situation in Taiwan spiralled out of control, Chen noted.
</P>
<P>
"If this is not a 'soft coup,' what is it? A 'coup' does not mean
only a 'coup d'etat' or a successful operation in toppling the
government. An 'abortive, soft coup' is also a 'coup,'" he argued.
</P>
<P>
Also Tuesday, Ministry of National Defense spokesman Huang
Suey-sheng said the military always abides by the Constitution and
that it is impossible that the military would start a coup.
</P>
<P>
Huang said the military, which pledges allegiance to the country
and is politically neutral, will never become a tool for political
struggle by any party.

U.S. COURT RESCINDS DISGRACED TYCOON'S SUIT AGAINST ROC REP OFFICE
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Los Angeles,  Nov. 15 (CNA)
(By Lu-sheng Chu and Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A U.S. federal court in Los Angeles
has rescinded a disgraced Taiwan business tycoon's lawsuit against
the Republic of China's representative office in Los Angeles, a
lawyer said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Lin Ying-lang, a U.S.-based Taiwan lawyer who has been retained
by the Taipei Economic and Cultural Office (TECO) in Los Angeles to
handle the case, said the federal court had rescinded former Tuntex
Group Chairman Chen You-hao's suit earlier in the day without
bothering to hold any debate session, on the grounds that the U.S.
court does not have jurisdiction over the case.
</P>
<P>
Lin said the U.S. court ruling has not only given a fair and
impartial judgment but also indicates that the U.S. judicial
authorities recognize Taiwan as a sovereign state.
</P>
<P>
According to Lin, Chen filed the suit in March, demanding that
the U.S. court revoke an ROC government move to put him on the list
of Taiwan's 10 most-wanted fugitives and "other political
persecutions." Chen claimed that Taiwan's move impinged upon his
basic human rights and privacy as well as restricted his business
activities. The listing resulted in his being detained on two
occasions by customs authorities when he was entering the United
States, Chen claimed in his suit.
</P>
<P>
TECO filed an application with the U.S. federal court Aug. 17,
asking the court to rescind Chen's suit. The court then informed the
plaintiff of TECO's application. On Nov. 5, Chen refused to withdraw
the suit.
</P>
<P>
Lin said the court was originally scheduled to hold a hearing on
the case Monday but the presiding judge later decided to cancel it
and directly handed down his ruling rescinding Chen's suit.
</P>
<P>
The judge said in a written verdict that in accordance with the
foreign sovereign immunity law, Taiwan is a foreign state to the
United States and also a sovereign state. As TECO represents the
Taiwan government, he said, the U.S. government has no jurisdiction
over the case.
</P>
<P>
According to U.S. law, Chen can appeal his case to a higher
court, but cannot use the same reason. As a result, Lin said, the
case is closed as far as TECO is concerned and the office is immune
from any further legal action on Chen's part.
</P>
<P>
Chen was an influential businessman during the tenure of former
President Lee Teng-hui. His Tuntex Group was involved in a number of
businesses, including textiles, cement, construction, petrochemicals,
travel and telecommunications. His business empire failed in the late
1990s due in part to a botched land development project. He has been
indicted on charges of breach of trust and corporate funds
embezzlement. He fled Taiwan in late 2001 and has since lived either
in the United States or in mainland China as one of Taiwan's
most-wanted fugitives.
</P>
<P>
He caused a stir before Taiwan's March 20 presidential election
by claiming in San Francisco that he had twice offered huge political
contributions to President Chen Shui-bian's wife -- the first time
during the run-up to the Taipei mayoral election in 1994 and the
second time during the lead-up to the 2000 presidential election. His
allegations were seen at the time as a tactic to undermine President
Chen's re-election bid.

EX-INTELLIGENCE OFFICER INDICTED ON CHARGES OF SPYING FOR BEIJING
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Nov.  16 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A former staff member of the Military
Intelligence Bureau (MIB) under the Ministry of National Defense was
indicted Tuesday on charges of spying for mainland China.
</P>
<P>
Liao Hsien-ping, 59, was accused of having collected information
about activities of Taiwan's major political parties and Taiwan's
2004 presidential elections, as well as visits to Taiwan by
pro-Taiwan members of the Hong Kong Legislative Council, for the
reference of mainland Chinese authorities.
</P>
<P>
According to the indictment, Liao was fired from his position as
an MIB intelligence officer in 1994 for dereliction of duty. He then
went to live in the Philippines. In late 1999, he returned to Taiwan
under the arrangement of a pro-Beijing overseas Chinese businessman
in Manila to collect intelligence for mainland China.
</P>
<P>
Liao worked as a taxi driver to cover up his
intelligence-gathering operations. He regularly sent intelligence
reports to designated people in Hong Kong and Macau for which he
received at least NT$1.7 million since 2000, the indictment said.
Prosecutors demanded a three-year prison term for Liao for
infractions of the National Security Law, document forgery and
leaking of non-military national secrets.

TAIWAN WTO ENVOY HOPES FOR SPEEDY TALKS ON TRADE FACILITATION
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Geneva,  Nov.  15 (CNA)
(By Neil Lu and Flor Wang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taiwan's permanent representative to the
World Trade Organization (WTO) called Monday for speeded up
negotiation on trade facilitation, one of the issues contained in the
Singapore issues, among WTO members.
</P>
<P>
Yen Ching-chang issued the call after a WTO negotiation panel
opened its first meeting to discuss the trade facilitation issue
earlier the same day at the organization's Geneva headquarters.
</P>
<P>
Saying that WTO member states should step up their pace to
complete the talks as soon as possible, Yen suggested that the panel
hold more meetings in order to settle the issue prior to a
ministerial meeting scheduled for December 2005 in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Currently, the panel has slated only five formal meetings on
trade facilitation from February to July for the whole of next year.
Prior to that, the panel will conduct this year's second and final
meeting Nov. 22-23.
</P>
<P>
According to Yen, the panel's top priority is to accelerate the
discussion pace to catch up with those on the other two Singapore
issues -- investment and transparency in government procurement and
competition policy.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan has rich experience in promoting trade facilitation and is
keen to advocate the issue under the WTO framework, he noted, adding
that the country is willing to provide its assistance in helping the
world trade regulatory body to forge a sound climate for the talks
among member states.
</P>
<P>
The Singapore issues form a key segment of the so-called July
Package, which was agreed upon in August by all WTO member countries
to include in the next round of the Doha Talks.

CTV SHARE PRICE PLUNGES AFTER SEIZURE OF BUILDINGS
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei, Nov. 16 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Kuomintang (KMT)-owned China Television
Co. (CTV) issued a statement Tuesday after the Shihlin District
Court seized property owned by the station, saying that it was as
much a victim as the bankrupt company whose downfall precipitated the
seizure.
</P>
<P>
The two buildings were seized because the TV station is the
supervisory body of the failed company, Procom, and is responsible
for any legal actions taken against it.
</P>
<P>
The buildings are in the Nankang district of Taipei and include
CTV's headquarters.
</P>
<P>
CTV's share price went into freefall after investors heard the
news of the property seizure. The price fell the maximum daily limit
of 7 percent to NT$10.6 (US$0.32) per share, or close to its face
value -- a value assigned all Taiwan stocks to be NT$10 per share --
after the opening of the Taiwan Stock Exchange Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
CTV, which formed a crisis team in the wake of the provisional
seizure, has mapped out emergency measures to try to mitigate the
impact and to keep the company operating normally.
</P>
<P>
Reports say that the real estate involved in the CTV seizure
exceeds NT$2.5 billion, and CTV Chairwoman Cheng Su-ming's assets,
including all her bank deposits and one-third of her monthly salary
were also temporarily frozen by the court.
</P>
<P>
CTV and its legal representative, who is also Cheng, have served
as one of the supervisors of Procom, Co. since August 2002. A series
of fraudulent practices involving the company's operations came to
light early this year.
</P>
<P>
The Shihlin Prosecutor's Office recently indicted Yeh Su-fei,
chairwoman of Procom, and 30 other defendants for various violations
including securities transactions infractions, breach of trust and
money laundering. The prosecutor asked for a maximum 20-year term for
Yeh and a fine of NT$500 million (US$15.15 million).
</P>
<P>
The non-profit Securities and Futures Investors Protection
Center, which is handling complaints from 7,500 Procom investors who
are asking NT$3.3 billion in compensation, have already acted on
behalf of the investors in obtaining compensation from 19 people,
including the chairwoman, other members of the Board of directors
and the supervisors of Procom and accountants from two prestigious
accounting firms that audited and certified the financial reports of
Procom.
</P>
<P>
But since CTV borrowed NT$1.65 billion from a bank using the two
buildings in question as mortgage earlier this month, the protection
center asked that the Shihlin District Court provisionally seize the
two properties to ensure the rights of the creditors.
</P>
<P>
In a six-point statement issued Tuesday, CTV implored the
Protection Center to give the same consideration to the shareholders
of the TV station as it has to the investors in Procom.
</P>
<P>
CTV also stressed that the borrowed NT$1.65 billion was mainly
used when it returned a NT$1.1 billion deposit made by a Buddhist TV
station for renting facilities in the buildings, and digitization
work of the CTV. The TV station stressed that it has no intention of
selling or transferring its assets.
</P>
<P>
The seizure of the buildings comes at a politically sensitive
time as the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) -- currently
campaigning to try to capture a majority in the legislature -- has
made the return of assets owned by opposition parties alleged to
have been obtained illegally a key plank in its electioneering
strategy.
</P>
<P>
A KMT spokesman said Tuesday that a "political hand" was pulling
the strings behind the seizure of CTV's buildings.
</P>
<P>
Chang Jung-kung said that the court over-extended its scope by
taking control of property that far exceeds the amount in
compensation money at the center of the court action. Taking just one
of the two buildings would have been sufficient, he said.
</P>
<P>
Chang said that the seizure was politically motivated and was
designed to undermine the financial operations of the TV station, and
hence deal a blow to the KMT.
</P>
<P>
However, the DPP flatly denied the allegation, saying that the
protection center was only acting in accordance with the law to
protect investors.

EPA SEEKING INVESTORS IN ENVIRONMENTAL TECHNOLOGY INDUSTRIAL PARKS
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei, Nov. 16 (CNA)

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Environmental Protection Administration
(EPA) Tuesday offered preferential packages to try to attract
investors to set up operations in four environmental technology
industrial parks.
</P>
<P>
While the Penchou Industrial Park in Kaohsiung County was
completed and opened in February, construction of the other three --
located in Hualien, Taoyuan and Tainan counties -- is set to be
completed by March 2005, EPA officials said.
</P>
<P>
The EPA has worked out a number of preferential measures as
incentives for investors, including a 50 percent subsidy for land
rental, a NT$25 million (US$761,754) production subsidy and a NT$10
million fund to finance research projects on trial and mass
production, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
Seven domestic companies specializing in the recycling of
lead-acid batteries, metal-impregnated mud and waste lubricant have
established operations in the industrial park in Kaohsiung County,
they said.
</P>
<P>
With a combined output of more than NT$1.3 billion per annum,
these companies are expected to create over 200 jobs, they said.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the U.S.-based World Resources Company (WRC) has
also decided to set up a treatment plant in the park, the officials
said.
</P>
<P>
Interested investors are urged to contact the EPA at (02)23117722

CABINET TO SET UP ANTI-TERRORISM COMMAND OFFICE
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Nov.  16 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Premier Yu Shyi-kun has ordered the
formation of an anti-terrorism command office within a week to step
up response measures, Cabinet spokesman Chen Chi-mai said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Yu issued the directive at a weekly Cabinet meeting, Chen said,
adding that the planned office will comprise seven divisions to cope
with different types of terrorist attacks.
</P>
<P>
According to Chen, the seven divisions will deal with violent
attacks, biological attacks, toxic attacks, radioactive attacks,
attacks on major public facilities, attacks on information and
communication systems and other forms of terrorist attacks,
respectively.
</P>
<P>
During the Cabinet meeting, Yu also directed that the new command
office must organize at least one full-range anti-terrorist training
exercise within three months.
</P>
<P>
Noting that national security strategies have changed
significantly since the 911 terrorist attacks, Chen said major
countries around the world have all stepped up preparations against
terrorist assault.
</P>
<P>
In line with the general world trend, Chen said, the Cabinet
referred a draft anti-terrorist action bill to the Legislative Yuan
for approval in November 2003.
</P>
<P>
"Much to our regret, the opposition-controlled legislature has so
far failed to screen the bill," Chen said.
</P>
<P>
The draft bill has designed a three-color warning system to
signal the risks of a possible terrorist attack -- green, yellow and
red -- in a progressive measurement system, Chen went on.
</P>
<P>
Quoting a report prepared by the National Police Administration
(NPA), Chen said, there are 75 mature terrorist organizations around
the world, with Europe, the Middle East and Asia as their main hubs.
</P>
<P>
According to the NPA report, bombings, armed surprise attacks and
kidnappings are the most common forms of terrorist attack. In the
first 10 months of this year, 1,381 terrorist attacks were reported
around the world, resulting in 3,097 deaths and 7,041 injuries.

OPPOSITION LEADERS SUE PRESIDENT OVER 'SOFT COUP' ALLEGATION
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Nov. 16 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Lien
Chan and People First Party (PFP) Chairman James Soong lodged a civil
lawsuit Tuesday against President Chen Shui-bian for defamation over
Chen's allegation about an aborted "soft coup" after the March 20
presidential election.
</P>
<P>
Commissioned by Lien and Soong, who formed the "pan-blue
alliance" ticket against the ticket of the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) of Chen and Vice President Annette Lu in the
election, lawyer Li Fuldien brought the suit to the Taipei District
Court against Chen over his rhetoric about a "soft coup" plotted by
Lien and Soong in the wake of their failed election bid.
</P>
<P>
According to Li, both Lien and Soong believe that Chen has
seriously damaged their reputations and the two men decided to seek
justice and symbolic compensation through legal means.
</P>
<P>
They are demanding that Chen compensate a token NT$1 dollar for
his allegation and that he run a half-page advertisement on the front
page of seven major daily newspapers at home and abroad, such as
Taiwan's Liberty Times, United Daily News and China Times, as well as
Japan's Yomiuri Shimbun, the United States' New York Times, Le Figaro
of France and Britain's Times, Li said.
</P>
<P>
Liao Feng-te, a KMT legislator, and Liu Wen-hsiung, a PFP
lawmaker, who accompanied Li in bringing the case to the court, asked
Chen to make public the hard evidence that he claims to have in hand
as soon as possible. "Only so doing will help clarify the truth, "
they argued.
</P>
<P>
Chen claimed Sunday while stumping for a DPP candidate in the
Dec. 11 legislative poll in southern Taiwan that he has hard evidence
of who attempted the so-called "soft coup," when and where.
</P>
<P>
According to Chen, various retired generals sought to persuade
about a dozen generals in active service to offer their resignations
or take sick leave in an attempt to undermine the military's morale
and order in the wake of his March 20 election victory.
</P>
<P>
However, Chen said, their plot failed thanks to Taiwan's success
in turning the military into a national force that has allegiance to
the country rather than to a political party, as was the case during
the KMT's five decades in power.
</P>
<P>
He also asked the public to end what he called "Lien-Soong"
unrest in the coming legislative polls by giving the "pan-green camp"
of the DPP and the Taiwan Solidarity Union a majority in the
Legislative Yuan.

NOTED JOURNAL PUBLISHES ARTICLE ON TAIWAN'S SARS-FIGHTING DRIVE
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Nov. 16 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The world-renowned medical journal Lancet
carries an article on Taiwan's fight against severe acute respiratory
syndrome (SARS) in its latest issue, marking world recognition of
Taiwan's efforts in this regard, a medical expert said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Su Ih-jen, director of the clinical research division at the
National Health Research Institute, who co-authored the article with
Ho Mei-hsiang, an Academia Sinica research fellow, said the article
is mainly aimed at sharing Taiwan's experience in SARS prevention and
control with other countries.
</P>
<P>
"It marks the first time that we have offered a comprehensive
review of our SARS-fighting experience, " Su said, adding that he was
pleased to see the article published in the authoritative medical
journal.
</P>
<P>
Another purpose of the article is to introduce Taiwan's
experience in fighting influenza, Su said.
</P>
<P>
In his view, Su said, influenza poses an even greater challenge
than SARS in quarantine and containment of its transmission.
</P>
<P>
"By now, we have become fully aware of the path of SARS
transmission and can effectively treat the disease. A SARS-infected
person usually cannot transmit the virus to other people until he or
she develops fever. In contrast, a flu-infected person can pass the
virus onto other people two or three days before he or she develops
fever," Su explained.
</P>
<P>
Noting that Tamiflu, an anti-virus drug, is the most effective
way to contain the spread of influenza, Su said the drug can break a
fever, thus containing transmission of the disease.
</P>
<P>
Su said Taiwan is the first country whose government has
purchased the drug to treat flu patients. In the face of the
ever-increasing flu threat, the drug is now in short supply. "Our
neighbors, such as Japan, Singapore and South Korea, have expressed
admiration for our government's foresight," he said.

SOUTHERN SCIENCE PARK SEES JUMP IN REVENUE

<TEXT>
<P>
The Southern Taiwan Science Park in Tainan
County has seen a jump in revenue, with 50 companies based there as
of the end of last year, according to government statistics published
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The tallies complied by the Cabinet-level Directorate General of
Budget, Accounting and Statistics (DGBAS) show that the park recorded
an average 75.9 percent growth rate in its annual revenue in the last
three years, a ratio far higher than the 13.8 percent posted by the
Hsinchu Science-based Industrial Park in the north, the most
representative establishment of its kind in Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
The Southern Taiwan Science Park was set up in 1996, with 50
hi-tech companies operating there, which have fueled in actual
capital worth NT$42.9 billion (US$1.3 billion).
</P>
<P>
The park chalked up combined business of NT$155.3 billion for the
whole of last year, with the opto-electronics industry as its
mainstay, generating NT$89.7 billion in business, or 57.8 percent of
the total, according to the same tallies. The IC industry ranked
second, contributing NT$60.9 billion. The two industries made up 97
percent of the park's overall business.

U.S., TAIWAN CONTINUE TO WORK ON TRADE ISSUES: USTR
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Washington,  Nov.  16 (CNA)
(By Wennie Chi and Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A U.S. Trade Representative Office
(USTR) spokesman said Tuesday that the United States has continued to
work with Taiwan on a number of trade issues.
</P>
<P>
Richard Mills made the remarks during a regular press conference
when he was asked whether the USTR, in its annual review next March
or April, will remove Taiwan from its priority watch list compiled
according to the special 301 provisions of the 1989 U.S. Omnibus
Trade Acts regarding intellectual property rights protection.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan has been placed on the priority watch list for the last
three straight years because the United States considers that the
island has not made sufficient efforts in the protection of
intellectual property rights.
</P>
<P>
"Taiwan is an important trading partner of the United States, and
we will continue to work with them on a number of issues related to
intellectual property rights and other areas to make sure that
Americans are treated fairly," he said.
</P>
<P>
On questions about Taiwan-U.S. talks on lifting the island's ban
on U.S. beef imports imposed after the appearance of a case of mad
cow disease in Washington State in December 2003, and on whether the
United States will re-open to Taiwan chicken imports, Mills didn't
give a specific timetable, saying only that both sides have continued
to communicate on these issues.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) recently said that
Taiwan has agreed in principle to resume imports of U.S. beef and
beef products.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan health and agriculture officials are currently in the
United States to inspect the major features and implementation of
U.S. safeguards against mad cow disease, or bovine spongiform
encephalopathy (BSE).
</P>
<P>
Taiwan purchased US$325 million worth of U.S. beef and beef
products in 2003, making it the sixth largest importer of U.S. beef
prior to imposing the ban, according to the USDA.

deciding whether to allow a casino here in the 
coming weeks when potential investors will be 
asked to submit their concepts for the integrated
resort project.

And with it, Senior Minister for Trade and
Industry Vivian Balakrishnan hopes to shift the 
debate on the casino issue to whether Singapore 
as a society is ready for it.

The Lianhe Zaobao:Renting to illegals:Jail
term no loger a must.

CHANGES to the Immigration Act passed will
give the courts discretion when sentencing 
landlords who rent out their premises to 
immigration offenders.

Not all will face a mandatory jail term in
addition to a fine, as has been the case 
previously.

This is because a distinction is being made
between the more serious act of 'reckless
harbouring' of an illegal and a 'negligent'
harbouring.

U.S. CROSS-STRAIT POLICY NOT EXPECTED TO CHANGE WHEN RICE TAKES OVER
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Washington,  Nov.  16 (CNA)
(By Oliver Lin and Deborah Kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
U.S. policy on cross-Taiwan Strait
relations is expected to remain unchanged after Condoleezza Rice
takes over from Colin Powell as secretary of state, a group of
U.S.-based academics opined Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. policies toward Taiwan and mainland China are expected
to remain basically the same after National Security Advisor Rice
assumes her new post, including the "one China" policy, and the
position that cross-strait differences should be solved peacefully
and that no unilateral changes should be made to the current
cross-strait status quo by either side, said Vincent W.C. Wang,
associate professor of political science at the University of
Richmond, Virginia.
</P>
<P>
Noting that Rice, who is particularly familiar with Russian
affairs, is an expert at power politics, Wang predicted that Rice
will probably rely heavily on the opinions of the assistant secretary
of state and the deputy assistant secretary of state for East Asian
and Pacific affairs when formulating policies on Taiwan and mainland
China.
</P>
<P>
June Teufel Dreyer, professor of political science at the
University of Miami at Coral Gables, also said that Washington's
China policy is not expected to change after Rice assumes the post of
secretary of state.
</P>
<P>
Dreyer said that the Iraq war and Iraqi affairs will remain the
top U.S. foreign policy concern, followed by Afghanistan and North
Korea. She added that she does not agree with speculation in the
State Department that mainland China will assist Washington in these
efforts.
</P>
<P>
As to mainland China, Dreyer said two developments deserve the
Bush administration's close attention, namely that members of
Congress have become increasingly displeased with the United States'
ever-widening trade deficit with mainland China, and that Beijing
authorities are taking high-handed measures in an attempt to suppress
social unrest that has surfaced in many provinces around the country.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Bonnie Glaser, a fellow researcher with the
Washington-based Center for Strategic and International Studies think
tank, said that she foresees continuity in U.S. cross-strait
policies.
</P>
<P>
Rice is expected to follow the policy of continuing to foster
bilateral ties with both Taiwan and mainland China, while the three
communiques that Washington signed with Beijing, the Taiwan Relations
Act, and opposition to any unilateral moves to change the
cross-strait status quo will remain the bedrock of Washington's
policies, Glaser noted.
</P>
<P>
She added that Rice has maintained good interactions with the
Beijing leadership and has visited Beijing twice in her current post.
Like President Bush, Rice is very much concerned with China's
escalating military build-up and with the possibility of Taiwan
taking actions to change the status quo.
</P>
<P>
Larry Diamond, a senior fellow at Stanford University's Hoover
Institution, also forecast that the current U.S. policy on
cross-strait relations will remain basically unchanged. He pointed
out that this also means that Washington will continue to pressure
Taiwan to adopt a more reconcilable stance on the development of
cross-strait relations.

ROC MINISTERS ARRIVES IN CHILE FOR APEC MEETING
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROC Minister of Economic Affairs
Ho Mei-yueh and Minister of Finance Lin Chuan arrived in the Chilean
capital of Santiago Tuesday to attend an annual ministerial-level
meeting of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum.
</P>
<P>
The 2004 APEC ministerial-level meeting will open Wednesday for a
two-day run.
</P>
<P>
Ho said Taiwan's participation in APEC activities are mainly
aimed at making positive contributions to trade liberalization
championed by the regional economic cooperation forum as well as to
the Doha round global trade talks launched by the World Trade
Organization in 2001.
</P>
<P>
On the sidelines of the multilateral APEC meeting, Ho said she is
scheduled to hold bilateral talks with her counterparts from at least
six other APEC member economies, including Chile -- the host country
of all 2004 APEC activities.
</P>
<P>
Ho said the formation of an Asia-Pacific free trade area is one
of the topics to be addressed at this year's APEC ministerial
meeting.
</P>
<P>
According to Ho, the issue has been discussed at the annual APEC
senior ministers meeting held in Santiago earlier this week. While
some member countries gave a thumbs-up to the proposal, several other
members were opposed to it. Ho said the issue will be further weighed
at the ministerial meeting.
</P>
<P>
As to Taiwan's plan to sign bilateral free trade agreements
(FTAs) with its major trading partners, Ho said Taiwan faces
difficulties negotiating FTAs with countries with which it doesn't
maintain formal diplomatic ties.
</P>
<P>
"We must overcome those difficulties step-by-step. We should
start from forging close cooperative ties," Ho explained, adding that
the government will tackle the issue with maximum patience.
</P>
<P>
For his part, Finance Minister Lin said he hopes to hold
bilateral talks with his counterparts from other APEC member
economies on customs cooperation and signing of taxation agreements
to facilitate mutual investment.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Yu Shao-wu, director-general of customs, who attended
the APEC senior officials meeting, said Taiwan will realize the goal
of "paperless" customs clearance by 2005.
</P>
<P>
Trade liberalization, automation and economic cooperation are
three major topics of this year's APEC conference. Yu said Taiwan has
been actively promoting automated customs clearance systems in recent
years and has achieved remarkable progress in the field.

<TEXT>
<P>
Minister of the Interior Su Jia-chyuan is
currently in Hawaii taking part in the 2004 Asia-Pacific Homeland
Security Summit and Exposition, sources from the Ministry of the
Interior (MOI) said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Su, who has kept his Hawaii visit low key to avoid interference
from Beijing, arrived in Honolulu Monday to participate in the second
Asia-Pacific Homeland Security Summit, which is being held Nov.
14-17.
</P>
<P>
Soon after his arrival, Su met with Hawaii Governor Linda Lingle
for talks on a wide range of topics, according to MOI officials.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Lingle, who visited Taiwan in 2001, told Su
that she came away from her trip to Taiwan with a distinct impression
of Taiwanese hospitality and strong cultural and educational
development there.
</P>
<P>
For his part, according to the MOI officials, Su conveyed Premier
Yu Shyi-kun's greetings to Lingle and the regional homeland summit
meeting, which is being sponsored by the state government of Hawaii.
</P>
<P>
Su told Lingle that Taiwan has been enthusiastically supportive
of the U.S.-led war on terror and that it will continue to cooperate
with all countries in the Asia-Pacific region to ward off global
terrorism.
</P>
<P>
Su also told Lingle that Taiwan can learn a lot from Hawaii in
the area of tourism and related development. Taiwan would also like
to exchange views with Hawaii in efforts seeking balanced development
between tourism and counter-terrorist programs, Su added.
</P>
<P>
At the dinner party Monday marking the opening of the summit, Su
met with Tom Ridge, secretary of the U.S. Department of Homeland
Security, for a brief chat, the MOI officials said.
</P>
<P>
Ridge told Su that he is welcome to visit Washington anytime for
talks on counter-terrorism efforts, according to the officials.
</P>
<P>
The development of innovative response strategies to the threat
of terrorism is at the core of the four-day conference, which has
been divided into three tracks, namely leadership and policy, law
enforcement, and counter-terrorism regional outreach.
</P>
<P>
Su is scheduled to return to Taipei Saturday.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The chairman of the Aviation Safety Council
(ASC) under the Executive Yuan, has been honored with an award for
his achievements, ASC officials said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Upon the recommendation of the U.S.-based Flight Safety
Foundation, Kay Yong received the Laura Taber Barbour Air Safety
Award in Shanghai, where the foundation is holding its annual
international air safety seminar Nov. 15-18.
</P>
<P>
The officials noted that award was established in 1956 by the
late Clifford E. Barbour and his son, Clifford E. Barbour Jr., in
memory of the elder Barbour's wife, a passenger on a DC-3 that struck
a mountain in West Virginia in 1945.
</P>
<P>
The award recognizes notable achievements in the field of
aviation safety in method, design, invention, study or other
improvements. Over the past 48 years, most of the recipients of the
award have been Americans.
</P>
<P>
The Flight Safety Foundation recommended Yong because under his
leadership, the ASC has become an independent and professional body,
projecting an image of fairness, integrity and professionalism.
</P>
<P>
Yong was the Aviation Weekly and Space Technology 2002 laureate
and also holds the Sir Barnes Wallis Medal, awarded by the Guild of
Air Pilots and Air Navigators of Great Britain.
</P>
<P>
Yong, 63, served as adjunct professor of National Cheng Kung
University and director of the Aerospace Science and Technology
Research Center before he became the ASC managing director and
chairman.

TAIWAN UNIVERSITY PROFESSORS POSITIVE ON EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT MEMBERS

Taipei,  Nov. 17 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An official of the pro-independence Taiwan
Association of University Professors (TAUP) expressed welcome
Wednesday that members of the European Parliament Committee on
Foreign Affairs have opposed the lifting of a ban on arms
sales to mainland China.
</P>
<P>
TAUP Secretary-General Hsiao Chih-ju made the remarks in the wake
of a discussion on arms sales in the Committee on Foreign Affairs
that day, when several members spoke out against the lifting of the
arms embargo that was imposed after the Tiananmen Square massacre in
1989.
</P>
<P>
Commissioner for External Relations Chris Pattern also
said that if China had made more substantial progress in human
rights, then it could have persuaded the Europeans that a lifting of
the ban would be appropriate.
</P>
<P>
Hsiao welcomed the views, but he also cautioned that some major
European countries are still promoting a lifting of the embargo and
that the European Union could very possibly announce a lifting by
mid-2005.
</P>
<P>
"The government should address the issue squarely, and block any
possible move in that direction," he said.
</P>
<P>
He also urged the EU to demand that China forego the use of force
against Taiwan if it wants to lift the ban, so as to safeguard
Taiwan's safety.
</P>
<P>
Hsiao said that the association is joining forces with European
non-governmental organizations to lobby members of the European
Parliament to support Taiwan's position, hoping to build momentum
within Europe to oppose a lifting of the arms embargo, adding that
the efforts have borne initial results.

<P>
The Awakening Foundation released Wednesday
a list of recommended candidates for the Dec. 11 legislative
elections that the group considers faithful advocates of gender
equality.
</P>
<P>
Fan Yun, a board director of the foundation, said the candidates
were selected based on their long-time devotion to the promotion of
gender equality and not based on partisan considerations.
</P>
<P>
The ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) candidates on the
list include Chou Ching-yu, Yeh Yi-chin, Chou Ya-shu, Hsiao Bi-khim,
Tang Pi-o, Tuan Yi-kang, Shen Fu-hsiung, Chen Chin-jun and Lai
Ching-te.
</P>
<P>
The opposition Kuomintang (KMT) candidates recommended by the
group are Tina Pan, Wang Yu-ting, Yang Li-huan, Tsai Ling-lan, Hung
Hsiu-chu, Chen Shei-saint and Shyu Jong-shyong.
</P>
<P>
The opposition People First Party (PFP) candidates on the list
are Li Yung-ping, Chao Liang-yen, Chin Huei-chu and Shen Chih-hwei.
</P>
<P>
While Chien Lin Hui-chun is the only Taiwan Solidarity Union
(TSU) candidate on the list, the independent candidates recommended
by the group include Su Ying-kui, Wang Fang-ping and Lin Cheng-hsiu.
</P>
<P>
The at-large legislative candidates of the DPP recommended by the
group are Chen Hsiu-hui, Huang Shu-ying, Yang Fang-wan and Lu
Tzu-yen. Those from the KMT are Huang Chao-shun and Huang Te-fu.
</P>
<P>
On the percentage of female candidates fielded by each party, the
DPP stands at 20 percent, the KMT at 26 percent, the PFP at 23
percent and the TSU at 10 percent, according to Fan.
</P>
<P>
She pointed out that all the figures have failed to reach the
30-percent target set by the parties.
</P>
<P>
Also Wednesday, a draw was conducted in each county and city to
decide the order of the candidates on the ballots.
</P>
<P>
In Taipei City, meanwhile, the DPP unveiled a vote-allocation
plan aimed at scoring all five seats it is vying for in the
Taipei-south district.
</P>
<P>
According to the plan, DPP supporters whose identification card
numbers end with the Arabic numerals "1" and "2" are asked to vote
for Lan Mei-chin; those ending with "3" and "4" are urged to vote for
Julian Kuo; those ending with "5" and "6" are asked to vote for Tuan
Yi-kang; those ending with "7" and "8" are urged to vote for Shen
Fu-hsiung; and those ending with "9" and "0" are asked to vote for

PRESIDENT TO WITNESS REINTRODUCTION OF HISTORICAL TABLET IN PENGHU
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Nov.  17 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President Chen Shui-bian is scheduled to
fly to Penghu Saturday to officiate at a ceremony marking the
reintroduction of an ancient stone tablet that carries the history of
the first encounter between Chinese and Dutch officials in the early
17th Century, which had a profound influence on Taiwan's development.
</P>
<P>
The ancient stone tablet -- with a Chinese inscription saying
that Ming dynasty official Shen Yourong rejects Dutch Captain
Wijbrand van Waerwijck here -- was carved in the Penghu Islands
(Pescadores) in December 1604 after van Waerwijick, an official and
captain of the Dutch East India Company, was rejected by Shen, a Ming
Dynasty official from Fujian, over a request to exchange in commerce.
</P>
<P>
The stone tablet was first unearthed from under the floor of an
altar in the Tienhou Matsu temple in Makung, Penghu's capital city,
in 1919 when the temple was being rebuilt.
</P>
<P>
The tablet was stored in a corner of the temple until 1985 when
the Cabinet-level Council for Cultural Affairs (CCA) refurbished the
temple and designated it a national historical site. The stone tablet
was at that time moved to a library on the second floor of the
temple.
</P>
<P>
Although the stone tablet remains intact, the characters engraved
upon it have long since become blurred.
</P>
<P>
Van Waerwijck led a Dutch East India Company fleet to today's
Macau in early 1604 in an attempt to take it as a colonial bastion.
</P>
<P>
But he was defeated by the Ming troops there and consequently led
the remaining fleet in a retreat. Pounded by a typhoon, van Waerwijck
and his fleet arrived in the Penghu islands, also then Ming
territory, in summer of that year.
</P>
<P>
The Dutch East India Company forces landed on Penghu and started
settling there. Van Waerwijck, meanwhile, sent his men to Fujian to
request to exchange in commerce with the Chinese.
</P>
<P>
Before long, Shen Yourong, under the authority of the Ming
government, led 20 ships to Penghu to expel the Dutch invaders. Shen
rebuked van Waerwijck for offering a bribe of 30,000 gold nuggets and
told him that a Chinese traitor, Pan Xiu, who guided the Dutch to
Penghu, would be executed. On Dec. 15, 1604, van Waerwijck left
Penghu.
</P>
<P>
After departing Penghu, van Waerwijck headed to Taiwan, then not
yet part of Ming territory, to begin another page of the Dutch
colonization of the island.
</P>
<P>
History would have been different should van Waerwijick have
succeeded in capturing Macau or if the Ming forces did not expel the
Dutch from Penghu, CCA officials said.
</P>
<P>
The stone tablet reintroduction is part of a series of activities
that the CCA is sponsoring to mark the 400th anniversary of the first
encounter between Chinese and Dutch officials.
</P>
<P>
Among the activities will be an exhibition at the Tienhou Matsu
Temple of photos, historical artifacts and documents that witness the
Dutch activities in the area including the Chinese mainland, the
Penghu islands and Taiwan.

BASIC LANGUAGE ABILITY TO BE PREREQUISITE FOR NATURALIZATION
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Nov.  17 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Foreigners intending to naturalize as
Republic of China citizens must possess basic language ability and
knowledge about ROC citizens' rights and obligations, according to a
draft package of revisions to the existing Nationality Law.
</P>
<P>
The Cabinet passed the draft package at its weekly meeting
Wednesday and it will soon be referred to the Legislative Yuan for
approval, a Cabinet official said.
</P>
<P>
With the number of foreign spouses increasing rapidly in Taiwan,
the official said, the government has attached great importance to
their life and work in local society, as well as the education of
their children.
</P>
<P>
Against this backdrop, the official said, the Ministry of the
Interior (MOI) has come up with the draft revisions to the
Nationality Law to add basic language and civic knowledge
requirements to those who intend to naturalize as ROC citizens.
</P>
<P>
To facilitate implementation of the revisions, the official said
that Premier Yu Shyi-kun has directed the MOI to join forces with the
Ministry of Education, the Ministry of Justice and the Ministry of
Economic Affairs to work out required language and civic knowledge
measurement standards and complementary testing rules.
</P>
<P>
Under the existing law, foreigners intending to naturalize must
meet requirements regarding abode, duration of residence, financial
status, professional skills, sobriety and having no criminal record.
</P>
<P>
"We hope to add language ability and civic knowledge requirements
in the future so that naturalized foreign spouses can adapt to the
local lifestyle more easily," the official said.
</P>
<P>
Official tallies show that Taiwan now has more than 320,000
foreign spouses, most of whom are young women from Southeast Asian
countries. Because of the language barrier, many of them have a hard
time adapting to daily life here and educating their children.
</P>
<P>
Yu has recently directed the MOI to strengthen care and
assistance for foreign spouses, including pushing them to receive
literacy and supplementary education, the official said.

TAIWAN'S DIGITAL CAMERA OUTPUT ON RISE: III
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,   Nov.  17  (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taiwan's output of digital cameras
continued to grow for the third quarter of this year, with models of
four and five megapixels dominating production, according to the
results of a recent investigation by the semi-official Institute for
Information Industry (III).
</P>
<P>
The investigation carried out by the III's Market Information
Center (MIC) showed that Taiwan manufactured 5.94 million digital
cameras in the third quarter, up by 12.4 percent compared to the
second quarter level and a 19.2 percent growth over the previous
year's level.
</P>
<P>
The sector's Q3 production value hit US$549 million, a rise of
25.1 percent year-on-year, but the average price quotation dropped to
US$92.4 per unit, according to the investigation.
</P>
<P>
It also discovered that four and five megapixel models have
replaced three megapixel models as the mainstay of production,
enjoying a stake of more than 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
MIC researchers said that market demand for high resolution and
value-added products will remain strong but forecast that the
domestic industry's output volume will reach around 5.65 million for
the fourth quarter, a slight fall of 5 percent from the Q3 level, as
a result of eroded consumer confidence due to higher oil prices.

HONG KONG URGED AGAIN TO INCREASE EXCHANGES WITH TAIWAN
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Hong Kong,  Nov.  17 (CNA)
(By Lin Yu-kuo and Deborah Kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Hong Kong authorities were once
again called upon Wednesday to establish a representative office in
Taiwan and increase exchanges with Taiwan liaison officials stationed
there.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan's representative in Hong Kong, Pao Cheng-kang, urged the
Hong Kong authorities to adopt an open and pragmatic approach to
handling Taiwan-Hong Kong affairs, including opening a counterpart
liaison office in Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Pao, who assumed his Hong Kong post Oct. 18, said that Hong Kong
and Taiwan can cooperate to bolster bilateral ties, beginning with a
swap of representative offices and stepped-up bilateral exchanges in
tourism and high technology industry and business.
</P>
<P>
Pao has still had no opportunity to meet with Hong Kong's
Secretary for Constitutional Affairs Stephen Lam for a talk even
after being in Hong Kong for a month, and said that the Hong Kong
authorities are too reserved with regard to Taiwan-Hong Kong affairs.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated that the Hong Kong authorities could have done
better and added that Hong Kong is the best platform for
communication between Taiwan and mainland China.
</P>
<P>
It was the second time in a week that Pao had made a call for
efforts to facilitate bilateral exchanges between Taiwan and Hong
Kong.
</P>
<P>
In a similar appeal Nov. 12, he called for the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region government to let its staff members visit
Taiwan more often to optimize private exchanges between the two
sides.
</P>
<P>
Pao said in an interview with the Sing Pao daily newspaper that
Hong Kong and Taiwan can foster closer bilateral ties beginning in
less-sensitive areas like the private sector.
</P>
<P>
Visits by lower-ranking Hong Kong civil servants to Taiwan could
be a good start to better mutual understanding between the two sides
and to pave the way for closer ties, said Pao, whose official title
is managing director of the Chung Hwa Travel Service in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated that mutual trust and a genuine desire for better
ties fostered by Hong Kong and Taiwan would lay the groundwork for
closer exchanges between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
In fact, Pao said, Hong Kong and Taiwan benefited from medical
exchanges during the outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome
in early 2003, adding that the fact that it took a shorter period of
time for him to get a work visa from the Hong Kong authorities than
it took his predecessor is an indication that bilateral ties are
improving.
</P>
<P>
Having Hong Kong Chief Executive Tung Chee-hwa visit Taiwan is of
course a distant wish, Pao said, adding that he will nevertheless
work relentlessly toward that goal.
</P>
<P>
Pao was chief secretary of the Cabinet-level Mainland Affairs
Council (MAC) before being appointed Taiwan's representative in Hong
Kong earlier this year. The MAC is the direct supervisory agency in
charge of the Chung Hwa Travel Service.
</P>
<P>
MAC Vice Chairman Chiu Tai-san recently called for the Hong Kong
government to seriously consider setting up offices in Taiwan to
promote bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
Noting that more than 230,000 Hong Kong visitors arrived in
Taiwan in the first nine months of this year for sightseeing and
business purposes, Chiu said that the number is nearly equal to that
for the whole of last year, which he said demonstrates that exchanges
between the two sides are increasing rapidly.

Three Taiwanese enterprises have opted to
establish operations in the Philippines' Subic Bay Industrial Park in
support of the Taiwan government's "go south" policy, Republic of
China Representative to the Philippines Wu Hsin-hsing said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Coin Chemical, Taiwan Pao An Industrial Co. and Asia Wooden
Articles Industrial Co. signed contracts with the park on the
investment projects last Saturday, Wu said.

During the meeting, SBMA head Alfredo Antonio promised to help
work out solutions to problems such as high water, electricity and
land rental costs, about which Taiwanese investors there have
complained, Wu said.

Wu, meanwhile, told Antonio that Taiwan will continue to promote
the "go south" policy and encourage businesses to set up operations

TAIWAN SHOULD STRESS STRATEGIC LOCATION WHEN DEALING WITH U.S.
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Nov.  17 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A former Mainland Affairs Council (MAC)
official said Wednesday that Taiwan should stress its "strategic
location" when dealing with the United States.
</P>
<P>
Lin Chong-pin, who is now a professor at the Graduate Institute
of International Affairs and Strategic Studies of Tamkang University,
said that for incoming U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice,
democracy and freedom are not the highest paradigms of the United
States when dealing with other countries and that in the next four
years of Bush's second term, the government should play its
"strategic location" card, instead of appealing for democracy.
</P>
<P>
The former MAC vice chairman noted that several of the core
members of the Bush administration, including Rice herself, submitted
a policy report on American national interests in July 2000 that first
and foremost spoke of the establishment of favorable relations
between mainland China and the United States in a seven-point focus,
with peace in the Taiwan Strait placed third and democratic issues
placed fifth.
</P>
<P>
Lin said that Rice and other U.S. high-ranking officials regard
the mainland as the major potential rival in Asia and feel that good
relations with Beijing must be established.
</P>
<P>
He said that with Taiwan jammed between the two superpowers, it
should stress its strategic location rather than continuing to
trumpet its democracy, for to Rice, strength is mightier than
everything else.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Lin said that from the experience of the past four
years, Taiwan's administration has to inform the United States in
advance concerning its major policies on cross-strait relations and
foreign affairs to save time and energy later in elaborating on the
policies.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that this is not a sign of weakness but a principle
of engagement between mature countries.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, an opposition Kuomintang expert on mainland affairs
said that U.S. foreign policy is not expected to undergo any major
adjustment after U.S. Secretary of State Colin Powell steps down.
</P>
<P>
KMT spokesman Chang Jung-kung made the remarks after U.S.
President George W. Bush nominated Rice to replace Powell.
</P>
<P>
Chang said that the Bush administration has continued to adjust
its cross-Taiwan Strait policy over the past two years and that the
general view of the international community is that the policy is
gradually tilting in favor of mainland China.
</P>
<P>
He predicted that although U.S. foreign policy will not see any
major adjustments after Rice assumes the top U.S. diplomatic post,
the trend is a tilt toward the mainland, which he claimed is due to
Beijing's rising influence but is also a problem of Taiwan's own
making.

<P>
The government is dedicated to the creation
of an environment conducive to the development of the movie industry,
in the hope that Taiwan's film industry will shine once again, the
head of the Government Information Office (GIO) said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
GIO Director-General Lin Chia-lung made the remarks when he
presided over the first of four presentations on incentives for film
investors in Taipei. The three other presentations will be held in
Taipei and Kaohsiung.
</P>
<P>
According to Lin, Taiwan culture is the most dynamic and creative
in Asia, but Taiwan people seem to have lost interest in Taiwan films
in recent years.
</P>
<P>
Describing the film industry as a high-return, high-risk
business, he said the government will shoulder up to 20 percent of
the investment risk to help encourage enterprises to put money into
domestic filmmaking, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that in the first stage of reviving Taiwan's film
industry, the government will offer incentives to investors, nurture
film talent and increase import taxes on foreign films.
In the mid- and long-term, it will oversee a convergence of
the movie, television and digital industries, and will encourage
the cultural and creative industry, multi-national production of
films, and coordination with related government agencies, so as to
create an excellent environment for the development of Taiwan's movie
industry.

TAIWAN OPENS DOOR WIDER TO MAINLAND CHINESE BUSINESSMEN
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Nov.  17 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taiwan will open its doors much wider to
mainland Chinese people intending to visit the island for business
activities, Cabinet spokesman Chen Chi-mai said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Chen made the remarks after the Cabinet passed a package of
regulations governing visits by mainland people for business at its
weekly meeting earlier in the day.
</P>
<P>
With the implementation of the new regulations, Chen said, the
number of mainland business visitors can reach 140,000 or more
annually, marking a 10-fold increase from the present figure.
</P>
<P>
Quoting statistics compiled by the Mainland Affairs Council and
the Ministry of Economic Affairs, Chen said the government approves
an average of 1,500 applications by prospective mainland business
visitors per month and that about 70 percent of the applicants
actually come to Taiwan, as the mainland authorities impose even
stricter standards in screening such applications.
</P>
<P>
To date, Chen said, none of the mainland business visitors have
ever absconded or overstayed their visas nor have they been found to
have been involved in any illegal activities.
</P>
<P>
In the past, Chen said, the government has not formulated a
special set of rules to regulate the entry of mainland business
visitors. Screening of those applications were based on regulations
governing mainland professionals' visits as well as regulations
governing multinational corporations' business activities.
</P>
<P>
As many local business executives have complained of the
stringency of the existing regulations, Chen said, the Cabinet
decided to compile a new set of rules to govern the entry of mainland
business visitors.
</P>
<P>
"The new rules largely ease restrictions on the qualifications of
local companies or institutions intending to host mainland business
people's visits to Taiwan, the number of mainland business people
they are eligible to invite and the duration of mainland visitors'
stay, " Chen said, adding that the new regulations will be able to
meet the local business community's general demands and are expected
to help attract more multinational business groups to invest in
Taiwan to facilitate their inroads into the mainland market.
</P>
<P>
Under the new regulations, prospective local hosts are no longer
confined to those who have invested more than US$300,000 in mainland
China. Prospective mainland business visitors will no longer be
restricted to those who have worked for a certain period of time at
their current posts and more mainland business managers and
professionals can be allowed to visit Taiwan for business activities.

AGING PROBLEM TO CAUSE SHORTAGE IN HI-TECH WORKFORCE: TIER
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Nov. 17 (CNA)
(By Y.F. Low)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Low fertility and an aging population are
expected to worsen workforce shortages in Taiwan, especially in the
hi-tech sector, according to a report released Wednesday by the
Taiwan Institute of Economic Research (TIER).
</P>
<P>
While the number of people 65 years old and older accounted for
over 7 percent of Taiwan's population in 1993, the figure has risen
to 9.24 percent with nearly 2.09 million people by 2003, Ministry of
the Interior statistics show.
</P>
<P>
The fertility rate in Taiwan, meanwhile, has dropped to one child
per woman today from four children per woman decades ago, and every
7.6 working persons need to support one elderly person now.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that every 2.7 working people will need to
support one elderly person 20 years from now, and 50 years from now,
it will become every 1.6 working people supporting one elderly
person.
</P>
<P>
According to the report authored by TIER associate research
fellow Chen Miao, the aging of Taiwan's population will lead to a
decline in productivity and lay a heavy burden on future generations
as they will have to support the senior population.
</P>
<P>
As young people nowadays tend to spend longer in education, which
delays their entry into the job market, the low fertility and aging
of the workforce will further worsen manpower shortages, Chen said.
</P>
<P>
Chen said the shortages will also affect the hi-tech sector and
threaten its competitiveness.
</P>
<P>
To solve the problem, he suggested that the government push back
the standard retirement age, which now stands at 65 years old.

MSCI'S WEIGHTING INCREASE MEANS PRAISE FOR TAIWAN: CEPD OFFICIAL

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Morgan Stanley Capital International's
(MSCI's) announcement of its prospective weighting increase later
this month for Taiwan is an affirmation of the country's progress and
growth, a government official said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Hu Chung-ying, director of the Economic Research Department under
the Cabinet-level Council for Economic Planning and Development
(CEPD) , made the remarks after the MSCI issued the announcement
earlier the same day.
</P>
<P>
Saying that the MSCI's move is an indication of its recognition
of Taiwan's efforts in financial and entrepreneurial reform, Hu said
that the famous investment consulting company's further weighting
increase planned for May next year is set to provide fresh leads for
the domestic stock market.
</P>
<P>
Effective following the Nov. 30 trading, the MSCI will raise its
inclusion weight of the MSCI Taiwan Index to 75 percent from the
current 55 percent. It will fully increase the ratio to 100 precent
in late May 2005. By that time, Taiwan will surpass South Korea to
become the Far East's largest country outside Japan in terms of the
MSCI's weight capitalization.
</P>
<P>
Fueled by the lead, the weighted index in the Taiwan Stock
Exchange rose by 117.83 points to close at 6,028.68 the same day. All
eight major share categories rose, particularly the flat-panel and
other hi-tech shares. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Corp.
finished at a six-month high of NT$49.5 per share.
</P>
<P>
Foreign institutional buyers have overpurchased Taiwan stocks for
15 trading days in a row.
</P>
<P>
An executive at the Taipei-based Jin Sun Futures Co., Ltd. said
that he is looking forward to a new wave of surges following the Dec.
11 legislative elections and that buying by foreign investors will be
the key engine that will push the market up, especially in the fourth
quarter, according to past experience.
</P>
<P>
Market analysts predicted that the MSCI's first stage movement
will help bring in foreign capital worth about US$7.3 billion for the
domestic bourse on strong speculation that the weighted index will
continue climbing to 6,800 points in the coming month.
</P>
<P>
At present, local investors have remained more conservative in
the face of bullish sentiments, market watchers pointed out, claiming
that they will soon join ranks with foreign investors in search of
handsome profits.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the new Taiwan dollar has come under robust pressure
to appreciate in view of the persistent influx of foreign capital
despite its rapid gains in value against the greenback over the past
month.
</P>
<P>
Chou Ar-ting, director-general of the Foreign Exchange Department
of Taiwan's Central Bank of China, said that the central bank will
leave the value of the local currency to be decided by market forces.
</P>
<P>
For the time being, the impact of a strengthening new Taiwan
dollar has been limited in the domestic export sector, as other
currencies, such as the Japanese yen and the euro, also rose against
the U.S. dollar, he noted.
</P>
<P>
The new Taiwan dollar further firmed against the greenback by
NT$0.16, finishing at 32.659 Wednesday in the Taipei foreign exchange
market -- a new high in three years and eight months.
</P>
<P>
Local consumption and asset shares, including construction and
financial stocks, will be helped the most by a stronger new Taiwan
dollar, market watcher said.

President Chen Shui-bian said Wednesday he
sincerely hopes that Taiwan's designation in the Lions Clubs

Chen made the remarks while meeting with Clement F. Kusiak,

</P>
<P>
Without the consent of Taiwan's Lions Clubs, Lions Clubs

that the designation in the organization be changed to "Taiwan."
</P>
<P>
Since the first Lions Club was established in Taiwan in 1953,
Chen said, the number of Lions Clubs has grown to exceed 100, with
more than 32,000 members.
</P>
<P>
Over the past 10 years, Chen said, local Lions Clubs have donated

of people's well-being, Chen said, adding that he hopes Kusiak can

TAIWAN REJECTS CHINESE 'CENSORSHIP' OF  TV COMMERCIAL BANNED IN CHILE

<P>
The government Wednesday refused to revise
a TV commercial that was to be shown in Chile during the Asia-Pacific
Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum meeting, which was banned owing to
protests from mainland China.
</P>
<P>
Calling the mainland's move a form of "censorship, " Government
Information Office Director-General Lin Chia-lung said for the sake
of national dignity, Taiwan will not change the content of the TV
commercial just to meet China's expectations.
</P>
<P>
Also, Lin said, Taiwan will not pay for the air-time for the
commercial because Chile has breached the contract with Taiwan by
ordering the ban.

The two-minute commercial showcasing Taiwan's natural beauty,
economic and technological developments, delicious foods and
achievements in sports was launched on Nov. 14 in Chile and was
originally set to run through Nov. 21.
</P>
<P>
However, it was stopped Nov. 16 after China protested to Chilean
authorities over a line in the narration, which says "building a
nation one day at a time."
</P>
<P>
China argued that the word "nation" had violated the "one China"
policy of APEC.
</P>
<P>
Lin said the line is meant to emphasize the energy and vitality
of Taiwan and that China's emotional reaction has exposed its
ignorance and cowardice.
</P>
<P>
He said Taiwan has no intention of stirring up controversy at the
APEC meeting but will not yield to any attempt by China to degrade
its status.

<P>
The Republic of China flag was finally
raised Wednesday in Port-Vila, the capital of Vanuatu, heralding the
start of formal diplomatic ties between the two countries, according
to Michel Lu, spokesman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
</P>
<P>
Lu made the remarks at a news conference where he confirmed that
the ministry had received written notice of the matter from the
Vanuatu government earlier the same day.
</P>
<P>
ROC diplomats in Vanuatu immediately raised the national flag at
a makeshift embassy in a local hotel after having gained approval
from the Vanuatuan government, Lu said, quoting the officials as
adding that no boycott or protests from mainland China surfaced in
the process.
</P>
<P>
Lu was reserved when asked by reporters about who might be
appointed ambassador to the new ally, saying only that the ministry
is looking for a qualified career diplomat.
</P>
<P>
Vanuatu Prime Minister Serge Vohor signed a document Nov. 3 in
Taipei with Minister of Foreign Affairs Tan Sun Chen to set up
diplomatic relations with the ROC. However, the matter was later
shelved by the country's Cabinet due to Beijing's protests.
</P>
<P>
The South Pacific country finally recognized its ties with Taiwan
Monday, becoming the ROC's 27th diplomatic ally in a diplomatic
tug-of-war with the mainland.

CABINET SPOKESMAN, DPP DEFEND FUNDRAISING PROGRAM
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei, Nov. 17 (CNA)
(By sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Cabinet spokesman Chen Chi-mai defended the
ruling Democratic Progressive Party's (DPP) requirement that its
members holding high-ranking posts in the government and state-owned
enterprises donate funds to the party.
</P>
<P>
Chen, a DPP member who had served as a legislator for three terms
before assuming his current post, said it is a normal practice in
democratic countries for party members to raise funds within the law,
which in Taiwan is the Political Contributions Law.
</P>
<P>
"Since the DPP doesn't have any party assets, it can only rely on
membership fees and funds raised or donated by its public
office-holding members," Chen said, adding that the practice has been
used since the DPP's establishment 18 years ago.
</P>
<P>
Chen said the DPP headquarters has opened a special account to
receive voluntary political contributions from rank and file members
as well as supporters and always issues receipts for each political
donation.
</P>
<P>
Chen was responding to media reports that the DPP headquarters
has recently sent letters to its members holding high-ranking posts
in the government and state-run enterprises to raise funds for the
party.
</P>
<P>
According to DPP regulations, an ROC president who is from DPP
must donate or raise NT$10 million annually; the vice president NT$3
million; the premier NT$2.5 million and the vice premier NT$1.5
million; chairmen of state-owned enterprises who are DPP members must
raise or donate NT$1 million annually.
</P>
<P>
"All of our fundraising activities have been transparent and have
strictly abided by the law, " Chen stressed, adding that the DPP
headquarters has enclosed copies of the Political Contributions Law
provisions in its letter to its members holding high-ranking posts in
the government and state-owned enterprises to remind them not to
violate the law in their fundraising activities.
</P>
<P>
DPP spokesman Cheng Wen-tsan said political parties can receive
donations under the Political Contribution Law.
</P>
<P>
"Our public office-holders can either raise funds from their
supporters or make donations out of their own pockets. Our
fundraising activities are legal and transparent. There will
absolutely not be any cases of funneling government funds or
state-run enterprises' funds into our party coffers, " Cheng insisted.
</P>
<P>
Government Information Office Director-General Lin Chia-lung, a
DPP member who is required to raise NT$500,000 for the party this
year, said he will donate the sum out of his own pocket and would not
solicit donations from supporters.

RISING LOCAL UNIT NOT TO HINDER TAIWAN'S ECONOMIC GROWTH: SCHOLARS
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Nov.  17 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A stronger new Taiwan dollar is not
expected to affect Taiwan's economic growth rate this year, scholars
said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Hsu Chen-ming, an economics professor at National Taiwan
University, said that the new Taiwan dollar's recent gains in value
against the U.S. dollar have been moderate compared to other Asian
currencies' appreciation.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese yen and the South Korea won have appreciated against
the U.S. dollar more sharply, a development which Hsu said will bail
out Taiwan's export-oriented economy.
</P>
<P>
Lai Feng-hsiung, dean of the College of Business at Tamkang
University, contended that an appreciation of mainland China's
renminbi will have a greater impact on the domestic economy on the
grounds that most of Taiwan's exports are bound for the mainland.
</P>
<P>
Should the mainland currency remain stable this year, Taiwan's
economic growth rate will also stay on track, Lai said, pointing out
that market forces are very likely to stop the greenback further
depreciating out of public concern about a serious shrinkage in their
assets in U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The two men's comments came after the new Taiwan dollar closed at
32.659 against the U.S. dollar -- a new high in three years and eight
months -- on the same day in the Taipei foreign exchange market.
</P>
<P>
Although a strengthening local currency is good for bringing down
import product prices and quell growing inflation at home, some
people are worried about whether it will make Taiwan's exports less
competitive overseas.

Economic Affairs Minister Ho
Mei-yueh and Finance Minister Lin Chuan met with their counterparts
from Chile, Canada and South Korea Wednesday for bilateral talks on
the first day of the ministerial-level meeting of the Asia-Pacific
Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum.
</P>
<P>
During the talks, Ho and Lin reiterated Taiwan's strong
willingness to participate in all formal activities of the APEC.
</P>
<P>
In their talks with South Korean Trade Minister Kim Hyun-chong,
Ho and Lin stressed that Taiwan has actively taken part in various
APEC activities since 1991 and that it will also participate in all
formal APEC activities to be held next year.
</P>
<P>
Ho and Lin expressed their admiration for South Korea's success
in staving off a financial crisis while optimizing the development of
its innovative and high-technology industries in recent years.
</P>
<P>
Also on Wednesday, Ho and Lin met with their counterparts from
the host country of Chile, mainly for talks on bilateral cooperation
on APEC-related issues.
</P>
<P>
Trade exchanges between Taiwan and Chile have gradually increased
in recent years, thanks to the cooperative platform that the APEC has
provided, Ho and Lin said.
</P>
<P>
Chile's exports to Taiwan for the first ten months of this year
registered growth of 80 percent over the level for the previous year,
while Chile's trade surplus with the island for the same period grew
by 135 percent over the year-earlier figure.
</P>
<P>
The two ROC ministers also held similar talks with their
counterparts from Canada during the day.
</P>
<P>
Ho, who arrived in the Chilean capital of Santiago Tuesday to
attend the annual APEC ministerial-level meeting, said Taiwan's
participation in APEC activities is mainly aimed at making positive
contributions to trade liberalization championed by the regional
economic cooperation forum as well as to the Doha round of global
trade talks launched by the World Trade Organization in 2001.
</P>
<P>
Ho said the formation of an Asia-Pacific free trade area is one
of the topics to be addressed at this year's APEC ministerial
meeting.
</P>
<P>
As to Taiwan's plan to sign bilateral free trade agreements
(FTAs) with its major trading partners, Ho said Taiwan faces
difficulties negotiating FTAs with countries with which it doesn't
maintain formal diplomatic ties.
</P>
<P>
"We must overcome these difficulties step-by-step. We should
start by forging close cooperative ties, " Ho explained, adding that
the government will tackle the issue with maximum patience.
</P>
<P>
For his part, Lin said he hopes to hold bilateral talks with his
counterparts from other APEC member economies on customs cooperation
and the signing of taxation agreements to facilitate mutual
investment.
</P>
<P>
On the sidelines of the multilateral APEC ministers meeting, Ho
and Lin are expected to hold bilateral talks with their counterparts
from at least six other APEC member economies during the two-day run
of the meeting.

Financial Times: Blair vows to target sabotage by animal rights
extremists.

Tony Blair on Wednesday promised to introduce an unprecedented
criminal offence that targets "economic sabotage" by animal rights
activists as part of a drive to make Britain a global magnet for life science companies.

The new offence is designed to tackle the small band of anti-vivisectionists who
attack companies by focusing on their suppliers, financial backers, investors and
customers, as well as their employees and directors.

CHILD CARE CONCEPTS POLL RELEASED
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei, Nov. 18 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Nearly 50 percent of Taiwan parents believe
children are obliged to repay any debts left by their parents, and
parents in this group are at greater risk of committing
murder-suicides involving their children, according to the Taiwan
Fund for Children and Families.
</P>
<P>
The organization based its conclusions on a child care concepts
survey it conducted on parents of elementary school children around
Taiwan. The results of the survey, in which a total of 1,590 valid
samples were collected, were unveiled Thursday.
</P>
<P>
In the survey, parents scored an average 70.22 points out of a
possible 100 on child care, and 41 percent of the parents received
scores of less than 70 points.
</P>
<P>
Nearly half of the parents surveyed said they believe children
are responsible for any debts left behind by their parents, and
nearly 20 percent said they would consider ending their children's
lives in order to avoid them having to pay back their debts.
</P>
<P>
The organization urged society to pay attention to this group of
parents as they potentially present a serious danger to their
children.
</P>
<P>
The survey also found that 80 percent of the parents surveyed
agree with the notion that children cannot have a normal life growing
up without proper parental care, while 57 percent said that no one
can take the place of parents. The organization interpreted these
results as indicating that there is widespread distrust in the
ability of the government or private care institutions to provide
proper care for children.
</P>
<P>
On the question of disciplining children, nearly 30 percent of
the respondents said that corporal punishment is unavoidable. The
fund therefore reminded parents to try to avoid direct or cruel
punishment in order not to inadvertently endanger the lives of their
children.

LATE HONG KONG TYCOON PROPOSED FEDERATION BETWEEN CHINA AND TAIWAN
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Hong  Kong,  Nov.  18 (CNA)
(By Lin Yu-kuo and Deborah Kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The late Hong Kong-based shipping
magnate C.Y. Tung once proposed a federation formula for Taiwan and
mainland China to bypass the thorny issue of "two Chinas, " according
to a report in an English daily in Hong Kong Thursday.
</P>
<P>
In his diary, C.Y. Tung, who once owned the largest container
fleet in the world, wrote that he suggested during a talk with former
U.S. President Richard Nixon that Washington instigate the formation
of a federation, similar to that of the United States of America,
between Taiwan and mainland China to solve the "one China" or "two
Chinas" problem and see the two rivals unify peacefully, according to
the report carried in Thursday's South China Morning Post.
</P>
<P>
The innovative suggestion, however, was not received favorably by
the then Beijing leadership, the report said.
</P>
<P>
According to the "Diary of C.Y. Tung, " which has just been
published and is scheduled to hit Hong Kong's bookstores Saturday,
Tung met with Nixon in Los Angeles in October 1979 for talks, during
which he made the suggestion to the U.S. president who had normalized
diplomatic relations between the United States and mainland China.
</P>
<P>
In his diary, Tung said that the Republic of China on Taiwan was
forced out of the United Nations in 1971, but the notion of "two
Chinas" was not recognized by either mainland China or the United
States.
</P>
<P>
Gravely concerned with the situation, Tung, who had maintained
close ties with Taiwan, made the "bold" proposal to Nixon.
</P>
<P>
In a diary entry dated May 1973, Tung, founder of Orient Overseas
International Ltd. and Orient Overseas Container Lines (OOCL), wrote
that he had striven to "try to pave the way for the Chinese Communist
Party and the Kuomintang to talk for a peaceful resolution of the
divisions between the two sides."
</P>
<P>
The Shanghai-born C.Y. Tung was the father of Tung Chee-hwa, who
is currently the chief executive of the Special Administrative Region
of Hong Kong. C.Y. Tung died at the age of 70 in 1982.
</P>
<P>
The diary also revealed that Tung, despite being a billionaire,
led a simple life, traveling around by MRT and sometimes even washing
his own clothes.

<P>
Vice President Annette Lu said Thursday the
government will designate 2005 as the year of health.
</P>
<P>
Lu made the remarks at a panel discussion of basic medical rights
and the universal health insurance program. The meeting was attended
by members of the Presidential Office human rights advisory panel,
government officials and medical community representatives.
</P>
<P>
Noting that medical service and health care are basic human
rights, Lu said the universal health insurance program is aimed at
granting low-income people access to basic medical services and
health care.
</P>
<P>
Lu said even though disputes over the universal health insurance
program have arisen from time to time since its inception some 10
years ago, all relevant quarters are obliged to cooperate in
resolving them so that the program can continue.
</P>
<P>
With a view to encouraging local people to lead a healthy
lifestyle, Lu said the government will designate 2005 as "healthy
life year" and will launch a series of activities to raise public
health awareness.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Lu said the government will coordinate with travel
service operators in issuing "healthy life tourist passports" to
encourage local people to engage in health-oriented tours
and leisure activities.

The American Institute in Taiwan (AIT)
announced Thursday that student visas issued to Taiwan students in
the first 10 months of this year have surpassed the number during all
of 2003.
</P>
<P>
AIT has issued 12,654 students visas to Taiwan applicants in
Jan.-Oct. 2004, compared to 11,277 for all of 2003, AIT officials
said.

ONE PERSON SUFFERS FROM CANCER EVERY 8.5 MINUTES IN TAIWAN: REPORT
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Nov. 18 (CNA)
(By Y.F. Low)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
One person was being diagnosed with cancer
every 8.5 minutes in Taiwan in 2001, compared with 9 minutes the
previous year, according to a report released Thursday by the
Department of Health (DOH).
</P>
<P>
The statistics were compiled based on the number of cancer cases
at 194 hospitals around the island with at least 50 beds in 2001.
</P>
<P>
There were 261.13 cancer patients out of every 100,000 people in
Taiwan in 2001, with liver cancer and cervical cancer being the most
common, the report showed.
</P>
<P>
It was found that the 10 most common kinds of cancer among men
were liver cancer, lung cancer, colon cancer, oral cancer, stomach
cancer, prostate cancer, bladder cancer, esophagus cancer, skin
cancer and pharyngeal cancer.
</P>
<P>
Among women, the 10 most common kinds of cancer were cervical
cancer, breast cancer, colon cancer, liver cancer, lung cancer,
stomach cancer, thyroid cancer, skin cancer, ovary cancer and uterine
cancer.
</P>
<P>
Chao Kun-yu, deputy director-general of the DOH's Bureau of
Health Promotion, said a total of 61,607 new cancer cases were
reported in 2001, up 2,491 compared with 2000.
</P>
<P>
While there were 278.02 cancer patients out of every 100,000 men,
there were 243.41 cancer patients for every 100,000 women, Chao said.
</P>
<P>
With cervical cancer and breast cancer usually diagnosed earlier
than lung cancer and liver cancer, 57.84 percent of women cancer
patients survive after five years, compared with only 32.35 percent
of men, Chao said.
</P>
<P>
Chao attributed the increase of cancer cases in Taiwan to
unhealthy living and dietary habits, in addition to the aging of the
population.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that people who smoke, drink alcohol and chew
betel nuts are 123 fold more likely to suffer from cancer than those
who do not.
</P>
<P>
For example, he said, the number of oral cancer cases among men
in 2001 was 29.4 percent higher than the 1997 level, and the number
of uterine cancer cases among women was 26.86 percent higher.
</P>
<P>
While the increase in oral cancer cases is related to the habit
of betel nut chewing, the rise of uterine cancer is related to the
consumption of a high-fat diet as well as hormonal changes, he said.

TAIWAN PART OF GLOBAL ANTI-TERRORISM ACTIONS: INTERIOR MINISTER
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Nov.  18  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taiwan will not absent itself from
international counter-terrorist actions and efforts, Republic of
China Minister of the Interior Su Jia-chyuan said in a speech made in
Hawaii recently, sources from the Ministry of the Interior (MOI) said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Su, who completed his attendance at the 2004 Asia-Pacific
Homeland Security Summit and Exposition in Honolulu Nov. 14-17,
delivered a speech during the summit to make known concrete measures
taken by Taiwan against global terrorism, according to an MOI news
release.
</P>
<P>
Su said that Taiwan has been active in taking part in global
anti-terrorism efforts since the 9/11 terrorist attacks on the United
States. Concrete measures taken in this regard included new plans and
execution of the plans in Taiwan by the administration, MOI officials
said in the news report released Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The interior minister is scheduled to return to Taipei Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Su related in his speech that Taiwan's Executive Yuan established
a national counter-terrorism action task force in early 2002 in
accordance with a resolution reached by the United Nations Security
Council in the wake of the 9/11 terrorist attacks.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that although not a UN member, Taiwan considers
itself a member of the global village and spares no efforts to
contribute in efforts maintaining international peace and regional
stability.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan is more than willing to cooperate with all members of the
global village to optimize security of the world and bolster
bilateral ties as well, Su added.
</P>
<P>
Su also introduced Taiwan, once known as Formosa, a beautiful
island in the eyes of the Dutch navy and traders who first visited
Taiwan more than 400 years ago, to his summit fellow participants. He
received a big round of applause from the audience, the news release
indicated.
</P>
<P>
During the summit, Su gave an exclusive interview with American
Broadcast Corporation (ABC) , in which he urged the United States to
include Taiwan in a U.S.-led global counter-terrorism system.
</P>
<P>
He also expressed Taiwan's eagerness to join the U.S.-led
Proliferation Security Initiative (PSI) to contribute the island's
wisdom and energy to help make the world a better place to live in.
</P>
<P>
Su, who kept his Hawaii visit low profile to avoid interference
from Beijing, arrived in Honolulu Monday to participate in the second
annual Asia-Pacific Homeland Security Summit since November 2003.
</P>
<P>
Su met with Hawaii Governor Linda Lingle for talks on a wide
range of topics. During the meeting, Lingle, who visited Taiwan in
2001, told Su that she came away from her trip to Taiwan with a
distinct impression of Taiwanese hospitality and strong cultural and
educational development there.
</P>
<P>
For his part, according to the MOI officials, Su conveyed Premier
Yu Shyi-kun's greetings to Lingle and the regional homeland summit
meeting, which was sponsored by the state government of Hawaii.
</P>
<P>
Su told Lingle that with Pingtung County and Hawaii's Maui County
being sister counties, Taiwan should learn from Hawaii's success in
promoting tourism, adding that Taiwan should also exchange ideas
about finding a balance between tourism and preventing terrorism.
</P>
<P>
At the dinner party Monday marking the opening of the summit, Su
met with Tom Ridge, secretary of the U.S. Department of Homeland
Security, for a brief chat, the MOI officials said.
</P>
<P>
Ridge told Su that he is welcome to visit Washington anytime for
talks on counter-terrorism efforts, according to the officials.
</P>
<P>
The development of innovative response strategies to the threat
of terrorism was at the core of the four-day conference, which had
been divided into three tracks, namely leadership and policy, law
enforcement, and counter-terrorism regional outreach.

KMT QUESTIONS DPP LEGISLATIVE CANDIDATE'S FITNESS TO RUN
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Nov.  18 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The opposition Kuomintang (KMT) said
Thursday a former official of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) should be thrown out of the Dec. 11 legislative elections
because he was convicted for disseminating unfounded information.
</P>
<P>
But Cheng Yun-peng, a former director of the DPP's Department of
Culture and Information, retorted by saying that he is currently in
"not guilty" status.
</P>
<P>
Cheng said that he was acquitted in the first trial, but the
plaintiffs appealed and he was subsequently sentenced to six months in
jail. He then appealed to the Supreme Court, which returned the case
to the Tainan branch of the high court for review.
</P>
<P>
"The case will be re-tried in Tainan Nov. 25, and I will continue
to fight for justice," Cheng said.
</P>
<P>
A trio of KMT officials -- Liao Feng-teh, director of the KMT's
Organization and Development Committee, Huang Teh-fu, KMT whip in the
Legislative Yuan, and KMT Legislator Tsai Cheng-yuan -- asked Cheng
to bow out at a news conference.
</P>
<P>
Liao noted that Cheng helped produced a party campaign ad three
years ago in the previous legislative elections to smear opposition
parties.
</P>
<P>
The ad, called "No matter how barbaric [you are], " which was
believed to have dealt a heavy blow to the opposition, impressed
voters with the message that no matter how barbaric the opposition
parties are, they should not cut budgets that concern the general
public. The ad linked a series of bills that failed to clear the
legislature with the faces of opposition legislators to insinuate
that they were to blame.
</P>
<P>
Liao said that Taiwan High Court's Tainan branch recently
sentenced Cheng to six months in jail and stripped him of his civil
rights for three years for disseminating unfounded information which
was deemed defamatory.
</P>
<P>
"But Cheng, instead of being remorseful, has produced a sequel to
the ad to try to smear the opposition parties," Liao said.
</P>
<P>
He further said that Cheng was most likely the fall guy for those
higher up in the DPP. The Taipei Prosecutor's Office dismissed suits
against then-DPP chairman Frank Hsieh and then-DPP secretary-general
Wu Nai-jen over the same ad.
</P>
<P>
Liao also claimed that since the case had been dragged out over
three years, there was room to suspect that a political force was
involved.
</P>
<P>
KMT Legislator Huang Teh-fu said that the smear campaign has
seriously undermined Taiwan's democracy, and the court's verdict is
overdue justice for his party.

<P>
The Ministry of Examination said Thursday
that it is cautiously optimistic that Taiwan can join the
Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Engineers next year.
</P>
<P>
Ministry officials said that the body of APEC Engineers was
established in 1995, with the purposes of recognizing "substantial
equivalence " of professional competence in engineering.
</P>
<P>
The body currently has 11 member economies -- Australia, Canada,
Hong Kong, Indonesia, Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, New Zealand, the
Philippines, the United States and Thailand.
</P>
<P>
APEC countries can apply to become members of the agreement by
demonstrating that they have in place systems that allow the
competence of engineers to be assessed to the agreed international
standard set by the APEC Engineers agreement.
</P>
<P>
Ministry officials noted that to bid for membership in the APEC
Engineers, the Executive Yuan has since last year instructed the
Ministries of Examination, Foreign Affairs and Education to send
officials to form a promotion committee.

TAIWAN ISSUE TO BE ON BUSH-HU TALKS AGENDA: WHITE HOUSE
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Washington,  Nov.  17 (CNA)
(By Wennie Chi and Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Issues regarding cross-Taiwan Strait
relations will be on the agenda of talks between U.S. President
George W. Bush and mainland Chinese President Hu Jintao on the
sidelines of an upcoming informal leadership meeting of the
Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum, senior White House
officials said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Three White House officials gave a background briefing to foreign
journalists stationed in Washington, D.C. ahead of Bush's departure
for the Chilean capital of Santiago to attend the 2004 APEC summit
meeting scheduled for Nov. 20-21. The three officials spoke on
condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
The three officials said Bush will hold bilateral talks with Hu
on the sidelines of the multilateral APEC summit meeting and that the
topics to be addressed are expected to include the North Korea issue
as well as the Taiwan Strait issue.
</P>
<P>
As far as the Taiwan Strait issue is concerned, the officials
said, the United States will adhere to its "one China" policy.
</P>
<P>
The officials further said the Bush administration has noticed a
"new element" in the recent development of cross-strait relations,
namely, President Chen Shui-bian's proposal in his Oct. 10 National
Day speech that the two sides of the Taiwan Strait resume dialogue
based on their "1992 talks" in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
According to the U.S. officials, the United States has
consistently encouraged the two sides of the Taiwan Strait to conduct
regular dialogue in order to defuse cross-strait tension and forge
constructive interactions.
</P>
<P>
Asked whether the United States is likely to change its arms
sales to Taiwan under Beijing's pressure, the three officials said
the U.S. government will provide Taiwan with adequate defensive
weapons to safeguard its security in line with the Taiwan Relations
Act and will not waver on this stance simply because of Beijing's
opposition.
</P>
<P>
As to whether Bush would hold bilateral talks with Lee Yuan-tseh,
Taiwan's representative to the APEC summit, the officials said Bush
doesn't have such a plan for the moment. Because of Beijing's
opposition, Taiwan's president has been barred from attending the
annual APEC leadership meeting in person and has to name a proxy to
attend on his behalf.
</P>
<P>
Asked whether Bush would likely ask Lee to pass any message to
President Chen, the U.S. officials didn't give a direct response.
They instead said Lee can fully represent Chen at the APEC summit.
</P>
<P>
APEC groups 21 Asia-Pacific economies -- Australia, Brunei,
Canada, Chile, China, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Japan, South Korea,
Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea, Peru, the
Philippines, Russia, Singapore, Taiwan, Thailand, the United States
and Vietnam.

<TEXT>
<P>
Coast Guard Administration (CGA) officials
vowed Thursday to step up protection of fishermen in Kinmen.
</P>
<P>
CGA officials made the remarks when they met with Kinmen
fishermen at a seminar held in the outlying island to learn more
about their needs.
</P>
<P>
The fishermen complained that mainland Chinese fishermen often
trespass into Kinmen waters, affecting their fish haul and their
livelihood. They asked the CGA to step up operations to chase the
trespassers away.
</P>
<P>
Kuo Hsien-wu, head of CGA's Kinmen branch, said that six rubber
rafts have been in use since last year while seven advanced radar
monitoring systems were installed early this year to monitor the sea.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the rubber rafts sailed out 132 times this year to
disperse mainland fishing vessels in coastal waters, evicting 214
mainland fishing ships, arresting 47 suspects, seizing 9,872 kg of
agricultural or fishery products and five kg of drugs. There were
also six cases of illegal electrocution of f0ish.
</P>
<P>
The coast guard cutters also made 902 sorties at sea this year,
seizing 167 smuggling suspects, nearly 50,000 kg of agricultural and
fishery products, 26.655 kg of drugs and 16 illegal mainland
immigrants.

The government has adopted a strategy of
deterrence in its counter-terrorism work, according to a report
released by the National Police Agency (NPA) Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The report was presented by NPA Deputy Director-General Liu
Shih-lin at the 2004 Asia-Pacific Homeland Security Summit and
Exposition held Nov. 14-17 in Honolulu.
</P>
<P>
Liu said that among the efforts to thwart terrorism, the top
priority is setting up a comprehensive anti-terrorism law and
organization, gaining access to early-warning intelligence,
establishing an anti-terrorism deterrent and building up
international anti-terrorism partnerships.
</P>
<P>
In terms of beefing up an anti-terrorism deterrent, Taiwan is
enhancing its "capability, credibility and communication" to thwart
any intent or attempt by terrorists to launch an attack in Taiwan,
Liu said.
</P>
<P>
He said the government has earmarked a budget to establish a

<TEXT>
<P>
Tourist arrivals will break the 3 million
mark this year thanks to the concerted promotional efforts of the
government and the private sector, Vice Premier Yeh Chu-lan said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the opening ceremony of the 2004 Taipei International
Travel Fair, Yeh said the government has listed tourism as one of
Taiwan's most important industries, subject to intensive promotion.
</P>
<P>
In an attempt to attract foreign tourists, Yeh said, the
government has made strenuous efforts in recent years to create a
tourist-friendly environment and simplify visa processing.
</P>
<P>
"Our efforts have gradually paid off. We set a goal of attracting
3 million foreign tourists this year. So far, tourist arrivals have
already exceeded 2.9 million. We believe that the number will reach
or exceed 3 million by year's end," Yeh said.
</P>
<P>
The travel fair is organized by the Taiwan Visitors Association
(TVA) with the assistance of the Tourism Bureau under the Ministry of
Transportation and Communications (MOTC).
</P>
<P>
Nearly 500 institutions from 55 countries and areas around the
world are participating in the fair, manning 720 exhibition booths at
the Taipei World Trade Center.
</P>
<P>
"The number of booths is an increase of 200 from the year-earlier
level. The exhibition space has also been expanded by 30 percent and
is fully occupied, " said Stanley Yen, chairman of the travel fair
organizing committee.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong and Singapore have sent large delegations, while Egypt,
Italy, Slovakia, Mexico and Argentina are taking part for the first
time.
</P>
<P>
Many countries offer attractive tour packages to entice
prospective Taiwan tourists. The travel show will open to the general
public from Friday, with an admission fee of NT$200 per person and
NT$150 for the elderly and the physically challenged.

PRESIDENT WANTS CLOSER INTERNATIONAL COOPERATION IN DISASTER RELIEF

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President Chen Shui-bian said Thursday he
hopes Asian countries can strengthen exchanges and cooperation in
disaster prevention and post-disaster relief for the benefit of all
parties concerned.
</P>
<P>
Chen made the appeal in a speech delivered at the opening of the
23rd annual conference of the International Fire Chief's Association
of Asia (IFCAA).
</P>
<P>
Noting that disaster knows no borders, Chen said international
cooperation in meteorological and seismological studies is needed in
disaster prevention and control.
</P>
<P>
"In view of our geographical proximity, we Asian countries should
increase exchanges in experience of fire-fighting and battling
various natural disasters. We should also enhance relevant
technological and resources exchanges so that we can create a better
and safer living environment for our peoples," Chen said.
</P>
<P>
In the modern world, Chen said, a natural disaster can often
evolve into a regional crisis.
</P>
<P>
"Against this backdrop, we should have new concepts about
security, cooperation and disaster prevention measures, " Chen said,
adding that he believes cooperation in disaster prevention and
post-disaster rehabilitation can eventually contribute to regional
integration.
</P>
<P>
More than 2,000 delegates from 23 IFCAA member states or areas
are taking part in the organization's three-day annual conference,
with new global disaster prevention and relief trends as its main
theme.
</P>
<P>
In addition to a regular IFCAA board meeting, a working-level
meeting and a plenary session, a series of lectures and seminars on
disaster prevention/relief mechanisms, management systems and
relevant technological development will also be held during the
conference, organizers said.

STRONGER RENMINBI WILL HURT TAIWAN IT SECTOR: ANALYSTS
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei, Nov. 18 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An appreciating renminbi will hurt Taiwan's
information-related business more than a stronger new Taiwan dollar,
industry analysts said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Despite the fact that the local currency has surged to a
high in almost four years against the U.S. dollar, the analysts said
that a stronger renminbi will do greater damage to Taiwan computer
companies based in mainland China, as a vast majority of them are
contract makers for big multinationals.
</P>
<P>
Mainland-based Taiwan computer companies will face a fierce war
to defend their gross earnings should the mainland currency go up in
value as expected next year, they pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Many leading international economic forecasting agencies have
predicted that the renminbi will appreciate against the greenback in
2005, ranging from 3 percent to 7 percent.
</P>
<P>
The United States and Japan have repeatedly asked Beijing to
allow its currency to float freely by dropping the renminbi's peg to
the U.S. dollar, which stands at about 8.277 against the greenback at
present.
</P>
<P>
According to a recent survey carried out by the Professional
Management Association in Taipei, some 60 percent of the Taiwan
businessmen working on the mainland believe that the renminbi will
rise in value next year, with nearly 50 percent of the opinion that
such a development will hurt their profits.
</P>
<P>
Most of them have turned from "optimistic" to "cautiously
optimistic" in terms of their business prospects in the coming three
years, the survey found.
</P>
<P>
Chen Miao, a researcher at the Taiwan Institute of Economic
Research, said that the mainland currency is now enjoying a strong
advantage in exports due to its close peg to a sliding U.S. dollar.
</P>
<P>
But he added that the mainland has been confronting mounting
pressure to allow the renminbi to pick up amid growing inflationary
pressure and efforts to cool its overheated economy. The mainland's
recent interest rate hikes form part of its bid to stifle the
increased appreciation pressure on its currency, he noted.
</P>
<P>
A senior researcher at the semi-official Institute for
Information Industry pointed out that compared to the local
currency's gains in recent days, a much-anticipated appreciation of
the renminbi will create a heavier burden on Taiwan computer makers
on the mainland.
</P>
<P>
As about 80 percent of Taiwan's computer firms have relocated
their production lines to the mainland in search of cheaper costs, a
strong new Taiwan dollar will only have a limited impact on their
knowledge-based research and development centers at home, he said.
</P>
<P>
However, a strong renminbi will levy a robust operating cost on
export-oriented Taiwan contractors operating on the mainland, making
their efforts to seek cheaper production in vain, according to an
analyst with the Taipei-based Topology Research Institute.
</P>
<P>
In particular, makers of cell phones and wireless LAN facilities
will be affected the most, as well as producers of notebooks and
personal computers, he said.
</P>
<P>
If the mainland allows the renminbi to appreciate, as is widely
expected, Taiwan manufacturers will have to absorb currency exchange
rate losses on their own in a war against multinational big names,
which usually hold effective bargaining chips on back of their global
presence, he explained.

57% OF TAIWAN WORKERS FEAR DEATH FROM OVERWORK: POLL
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Nov.  18 (CNA)
(By Y.F. Low)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Fifty-seven percent of workers in Taiwan
are worried that they might die from overwork and 40 percent think
they are in poor health, according to the results of a survey
released Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The survey was conducted by the 9999 Pan Asia Job Bank among
6,391 workers between Oct. 11 and Nov. 9. It had a margin of error of
1.25 percent.
</P>
<P>
Among the respondents who complained of poor health, the most
common illnesses were those involving the neck and shoulders, waist
and back, intestines and stomach, and liver, as well as obesity and
headache.
</P>
<P>
On the causes leading to their health problems, 51.15 percent
attributed their problems to a stressful life and work, 44.3 percent
to long work hours, 41.53 percent to a lack of exercise, 37.11
percent to nutritional imbalance, and 27.87 percent to irregular
mealtimes.
</P>
<P>
Because of these health problems, 56.53 percent of the
respondents said they fear death from overwork, compared with 14.29
percent who said they do not.
</P>
<P>
While 61.18 percent of the workers said their jobs are likely to
cause their death through overwork, 20.31 percent were not so sure,
and 18.51 percent said it is unlikely.
</P>
<P>
The top five role models for a "healthy worker" selected by the
respondents were Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou, supermodel Lin Chih-ling,
designer Chiang Yu-po, singer Wang Lee-hom and baseball player Tsao
Chin-hui.

TAIWAN TO SEND DELEGATION TO ATTEND BUSH INAUGURATION

<P>
The government will follow past practice by
sending a delegation to attend U.S. President George W. Bush's
inauguration next January, a Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA)
official said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Chin Jih-hsin, director of the MOFA's North American Affairs
Department, said the delegation will be composed of representatives
of major political parties, legislators and academics.
</P>
<P>
Despite the absence of formal diplomatic ties with the United
States, Taiwan has consistently sent non-governmental delegations to
attend U.S. presidential inaugurations to convey the congratulations
of the ROC government and people.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Chin said he is convinced that Taiwan-U.S. relations
will continue to grow on the solid existing basis after incumbent
National Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice takes over from Colin
Powell as U.S. secretary of state.
</P>
<P>
Chin said Rice came up with many diplomatic policy initiatives
during Bush's first term, contributing a great deal to the U.S.
foreign policy enforcement and earning Bush's trust.
</P>
<P>
As for Powell, Chin said, the outgoing U.S. secretary of state
has on various occasions recognized Taiwan's democratic development
and has contributed greatly to the global war on terrorism.
</P>
<P>
According to a CNA report from Washington, D.C., John J. Tkacik,
a U.S. Heritage Foundation fellow familiar with cross-Taiwan Strait
affairs, said Wednesday that Rice is a mature strategic thinker and
capable of formulating foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
Tkacik further said Rice has a clear understanding of the gist of
the United States' "one China" policy.
</P>
<P>
Noting that Rice once wrote in an article that the "one China"
policy also demands that Beijing, with a stronger military strength,
should renounce the option of using force, Tkacik said he believes
Rice will adopt a pragmatic and realistic approach in implementing
the U.S. policy toward China after assuming her new post.

<P>
The two men were identified only by their family names of Yeh and

Initial investigation results show that the drug was first
shipped to mainland China for processing into powder and divided into
12 packages that were disguised in cans of brand-name nutritional

"This marks the first time traffickers have disguised contraband

PRESIDENT: EMBRACING CHINESE CULTURE NOT BEING ASSIMILATED BY CHINA
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President Chen Shui-bian drew a fine line
between politics and culture Thursday, saying that Taiwan should
accept Chinese culture, which is not the same as "being assimilated
by China."
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a conference of the National Cultural Association,
Chen said Taiwan should keep spreading excellent Chinese culture,
enrich its own culture and foster self-confidence and cultural
tolerance in tune with its democracy."
</P>
<P>
Noting that the virtues that he said are treasured by Chinese
culture, such as benevolent government, kindheartedness, peace,
honor, harmony and friendliness are also vital to a modern country and
society, Chen said they are valuable assets of all Chinese and there
is no question of discarding them because of their Chinese origin.
</P>
<P>
"We do not accept China's military threat against the 23 million
people of Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen and Matsu, but political rivalry
should not necessarily drive us to get rid of anything reminiscent of
China," Chen said.
</P>
<P>
As to the controversy surrounding guidelines came up by the
Ministry of Education for history textbooks used in senior high
schools, Chen said Taiwan is an island that has been exposed to
various cultures. However, the Kuomintang suppressed the development
of local culture and interpreted history in its own view. Now, he
went on, it is time to review history in perspective.
</P>
<P>
Chen said his administration respects different historical
aspects and will leave the controversy in the hands of historians,
but will not agree with those who cast doubt on the sovereignty of
the Republic of China.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the guidelines are still being worked on and that
public opinion will be consulted before they are finalized, Chen said
he regrets that some politicians have picked them apart as "good for
nothing, " consider them part of his administration's efforts to
"distance itself from China" and have even "blamed me for them."
</P>
<P>
In a democracy, Chen said, everybody is entitled to his or her
own opinion, but no one should force his own views on others. The
same rule should apply to the controversy caused by the history
textbook guidelines, he said.

GROWTH CONTINUES AT KAOHSIUNG PORT OFFSHORE TRANSSHIPMENT HUB

Business of the cross-Taiwan Strait
offshore transshipment center at the Kaohsiung Port in southern
Taiwan continues to increase, with the number of containers handled
by the hub showing substantive growth, according to tallies released
Thursday by the Kaohsiung Harbor Bureau.
</P>
<P>
In October alone, the center dealt with more than 53,500
containers, up by 2.7 percent over the previous year's number, the
tallies show. It handled a combined 553,100 containers for the
January-October period, an increase of 6.5 percent over the
year-earlier level.
</P>
<P>
Bureau officials forecast that the center will deal with as many
as 670,000 containers for the whole of this year. Meanwhile,
Kaohsiung Port, Taiwan's largest, is estimated to handle more than
9.4 million containers for the whole of 2004.
</P>
<P>
At present, there are 10 shipping companies -- four from Taiwan
and six from mainland China -- plying the Kaohsiung-Fuzhou and
Kaohsiung-Xiamen routes between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait,
the officials said, adding that they provide a total of 20 crossings
per week.
</P>
<P>
The cross-strait offshore transshipment center at Kaohsiung Port
was opened in 1997 to allow vessels from the mainland to load and
unload containers there, as their personnel and cargoes are
restricted from entering Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
The purpose of the establishment was to boost cross-strait
economic exchanges in the face of the lack of trade, transport and
postal links between Taiwan and the mainland due to their long-term
political disputes.

PHILIPS KEEN ON CLOSER COOPERATION WITH TAIWAN
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei, Oct. 18 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Philips Taiwan is keen on setting up closer
cooperative ties with local companies on a wide range of product
lines, Philips Taiwan President Chuang Chun-yuan said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
In addition to increasing purchases in Taiwan, the Dutch
multinational group is willing to enhance cooperation with local
companies, mainly in the fields of wireless telecommunications,
electronic medical treatment equipment, cathode ray tubes and
personal digital entertainment facilities, Chuang said.
</P>
<P>
According to the new company president, the world trends focusing
on creating multifunctional devices with a mix of audio, visual and
telecommunications effects have sharply increased the chance of
bilateral cooperation between the Philips group and Taiwan firms.
</P>
<P>
Philips will further expand its cooperation with Taiwan and buy
more here, he promised, adding that future purchases will center on
five areas, including telecommunications goods and digital
televisions.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan companies seeking to create their own brands specializing
in digital home appliances will have a better chance and more
opportunities to set up cooperative ventures with the group, he
noted.
</P>
<P>
Last year, Philips bought a total of NT$15 billion (US$461.5
million) worth of Taiwan products, which he said is only a small
portion compared to the group's entire revenue of NT$1.2 trillion.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan ranks as the group's 13th-largest purchase source, mainly
providing liquid crystal displays, memory chips and power-generating
facilities.
</P>
<P>
Philips Taiwan posted a business turnover of NT$120 billion for
the whole of 2003.

FM DENIES REPORT ABOUT VANUATU'S RENEGING ON TIES WITH TAIWAN
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Nov.  18 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs denied a
report Thursday that Vanuatu's Cabinet has reneged on its newly
forged diplomatic ties with Taiwan, calling it a lie put into
circulation by Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Michel Lu, a spokesman for the foreign ministry, dismissed as
"groundless" a report broadcast by a radio station in Australia that
Vanuatu's Cabinet reaffirmed Thursday its commitment to the "one
China policy," which recognizes the People's Republic of China as the
sole legitimate government of China, and opposes ties with Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said his ministry checked the report with the
country's diplomats in Port Vila, Vanuatu, and was told that
Vanuatu's new foreign minister has denied the report, saying that
Thursday's Cabinet meeting did not even discuss the issue in depth,
let alone oppose the diplomatic ties.
</P>
<P>
Lu said mainland China's diplomats in Port Vila are putting out
lies through several Vanuatu Cabinet members, although the Republic
of China flag is flying at its temporary embassy in Port Vila.
</P>
<P>
Vanuatu Prime Minister Serge Vohor concluded an agreement with
Taiwan Nov. 3 in Taipei, extending diplomatic recognition to the
country.
</P>
<P>
However, Vohor's Cabinet had since given out conflicting messages
as to whether it would approve Vohor's agreement with Taiwan until
Monday, when Vohor announced the government's recognition of Taiwan
on television.

MA DENIES PLANNING TO RUN FOR KMT CHAIR
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Nov.  19 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taipei City Mayor Ma Ying-jeou on Friday
categorically denied that he has been planning to run for the
chairmanship of the opposition Kuomintang (KMT).
</P>
<P>
Ma dismissed a local daily report that he has been planning to
run for the post currently occupied by KMT Chairman Lien Chan as a
"patched-up" and "groundless" report since the reporter did not even
interview him before writing it.
</P>
<P>
Ma said he has absolutely not thought about the chairmanship,
particularly at a time when he has been busy with stumping for KMT
legislative candidates in his capacity as a KMT vice chairman and
busy with running the city as the mayor.
</P>
<P>
As a vice chairman of the KMT, Ma said that the most critical
work for him at the moment is helping to bolster KMT legislative
candidates' support base and helping to retain the opposition
"pan-blue alliance's" majority in the Legislative Yuan. Things
besides this and his work as mayor are beyond his considerations at
the present time, he added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, KMT Chairman Lien Chan ducked reporters' questions
about the veracity of Ma's "increasingly evident" intention to run
for the KMT chairmanship in party elections slated for next March,
responding only by saying that "all of the KMT candidates in the Dec.
11 legislative elections will be elected."

MOFA WELCOMES E.U. DECISION TO CONTINUE BAN ON ARMS SALES TO CHINA
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Nov. 19 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) on
Friday welcomed a decision by the European Parliament to maintain its
arms sales embargo against mainland China.
</P>
<P>
MOFA spokesman Michel Lu was referring to a vote by the European
Parliament Wednesday to continue the ban on arms sales to China which
was imposed shortly after the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre.
</P>
<P>
Lu said the decision shows that the E.U. still thinks that China
has not done enough in improving its human rights protection, and
that it is concerned about the Asian-Pacific region.
</P>
<P>
"The ministry hopes the international community will attach more
importance to the issue," he urged.
</P>
<P>
The European Parliament said the arms embargo should continue
until the European Union has adopted a code of conduct providing
legal restraints on arms exports, and until China takes concrete
measures to improve its human rights situation. The arms ban issue is
expected to come up again during an E.U. summit in Brussels in
December.
</P>
<P>
Lu noted that the E.U. imposed the ban in the first place because
the human rights situation in mainland China was poor. There has
still not been sufficient improvement in this respect to meet the
E.U.'s conditions for lifting the ban, he said.
</P>
<P>
Lu added that if the E.U. lifts the arms ban, it will affect the
peace and stability in the Asia-Pacific region.

PRESIDENT HAILS NAME CHANGE OF KIWANIS TAIWAN CHAPTER
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Nov. 19 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President Chen Shui-bian said Friday he is
pleased with the successful change in the official designation of the
Taiwan chapter of Kiwanis International.
</P>
<P>
Chen made the remarks while meeting with Kiwanis International
President Case Van Kleef at the Presidential Office.
</P>
<P>
The local Kiwanis club was originally named the "Republic of
China District of Kiwanis International." With a view to signifying
Taiwan's identity, the club applied last year to have its official
designation changed to "Taiwan District of Kiwanis International." It
has received approval from the Kiwanis International headquarters in
the United States.
</P>
<P>
Chen said the Kiwanis Taiwan chapter has contributed a great deal
to the local community and charitable services over the years. During
the Kiwanis International general conference held this June, Kiwanis
Taiwan received a citation as one of the most outstanding district
Kiwanis chapters.
</P>
<P>
In compliance with the Kiwanis International's 2004 theme of
promoting children's welfare, Chen said the Kiwanis Taiwan chapter
has set up a children's welfare fund to help improve welfare services
for children from impoverished families.
</P>
<P>
Kleef is currently in Taipei to inspect progress in preparations
for the Kiwanis International's 2006 Asia-Pacific conference to be
held in Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Chen told Kleef that his administration will give necessary
assistance to the Taiwan Kiwanis chapter in organizing the
conference.

<P>
Kiwanis International is an association of men and women

communities.

FORMER CZECH PRESIDENT IN TAIWAN FOR SIX-DAY VISIT
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Nov.  19 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Former Czech Republic President Vaclav
Havel and his wife arrived in Taipei Friday for a six-day visit,
Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) officials said.
</P>
<P>
A multi-talented and resourceful man, Havel, who has been a poet,
playwright, dissident, thinker and politician, and his wife are in
Taiwan at the invitation of President Chen Shui-bian and the Taiwan
Foundation for Democracy, the MOFA officials said.
</P>
<P>
During his stay, Havel will meet with Chen and Vice President
Annette Lu. He will be decorated by Chen with a medal in recognition
of his contribution to the promotion of Taiwan-Czech Republic ties
and his career achievements, particularly his courage in keeping
alive the "flame of democracy" when his country was under communist
rule.
</P>
<P>
Havel is scheduled to deliver a speech and receive an honorary
doctorate from National Chengchi University.
</P>
<P>
Also included in Havel's itinerary are meetings with local
academics, artists and literary celebrities.
</P>
<P>
Havel formally ended his 12-year presidency in February 2003.
During his presidency, he continued working hard to consolidate the
Czech Republic's democratic system as well as to promote human rights
and social justice, earning wide respect and admiration from his
compatriots.
</P>
<P>
MOFA officials said Havel has been very friendly toward Taiwan
because of his democratic convictions and his courage in standing up
to mainland China's pressure.
</P>
<P>
During his presidency, Havel invited then-ROC President Lee
Teng-hui to attend an international forum in Prague. Incumbent ROC
first lady Wu Shu-chen and former Vice President Lien Chan have also
visited the Czech Republic. In 1995, Havel spoke in support of
Taiwan's bid to join the United Nations at an annual U.N. General
Assembly plenary session. He is one of the few world leaders willing
to publicly throw his support behind Taiwan without fearing a
backlash from Beijing.
</P>
<P>
After his retirement, MOFA officials said, Havel had planned to
visit Taiwan immediately. But he later chose to stay in his country
to help stabilize the domestic political situation following the
transfer of power. Early this year, Havel again had planned to visit
Taiwan and several other Asian countries to promote his new book.
However, his Asian tour was cut short in India due to health reasons.
</P>
<P>
Havel played a pivotal role in his country's "velvet revolution"
of 1989. He used his literary and theatrical creations to kindle and
keep the flame of democracy burning amidst a storm of repression and
autocracy during communist rule. He eventually led his country to
break the shackles of communist suppression and move toward
democracy.
</P>
<P>
To welcome Havel's visit, Taipei National University of the Arts
has designated November as its "Month of Vaclav Havel Art." In
addition to performing Havel's plays, the university has also
organized many other activities during the period of Nov. 5-24,
including a Havel book fair and a series of seminars on Havel's
artistic and political achievements, as well as a Czech film
festival.

Chen said he was pleased with Taiwan's ability to take the lead
in detecting the mainland submarine's intrusion. Taiwan alerted Japan
and the United States to the intrusion and the intelligence was later
verified, he added.
</P>
<P>
In the face of the mainland's military threat, Chen said, Taiwan,
Japan and the United States have a shared interest in maintaining
peace and stability in the Asia-Pacific region.
</P>
<P>
Chen said he has noticed that many Japanese people look forward
to having the post-war Japanese Constitution revised to make Japan a
"normal" country. Taiwan faces a similar situation, he went on,
adding that although Taiwan is an independent sovereign state, it has
yet to become a fully "normal and complete" country. Chen said his
administration must redouble its efforts to complete many unfinished
tasks.
</P>
<P>
Touching on Taiwan-Japan ties, Chen said the successive opening
of regular flights between Taiwan and three more Japanese cities --
Sapporo, Hiroshima and Sendai -- in recent years has further
facilitated exchanges between the two countries. Taiwan and Japanese
people exchanged 1.4 million visits in 2003, Chen said, adding that
the number will continue to increase in the years ahead.
</P>
<P>
He also expressed a warm welcome to Japan's decision to offer
visa-free entry for Taiwan people during the World Exposition in
Aichi from March 25 through Sept. 25, 2005. Chen said he hopes Japan
will offer full-fledged visa-free entry to tourists from Taiwan on a
reciprocal basis in the not-too-distant future.

TAIWAN LIKELY TO POSTPONE RESUMPTION OF U.S. BEEF IMPORTS
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Nov. 19 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taiwan is likely to postpone a resumption
of imports of U.S. beef and beef products upon reports of possible
new cases of mad-cow disease in the United States, sources from the
Department of Health (DOH) said Friday.
</P>
<P>
While Taiwan has continued to dispatch quarantine personnel to
the United States for on-site inspections of the implementation of
U.S. safeguards against bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), also
known as mad cow disease, before giving a green light to a resumption
of U.S. beef imports, new cases of the disease reported Thursday,
although not yet confirmed, may cause the DOH to postpone the
schedule of the resumption.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan suspended imports in December 2003 following the discovery
in Washington State of a single BSE-infected cow, but the two sides
have been working in last two months to facilitate a resumption of
imports.
</P>
<P>
According to Hsieh Ting-hung, a senior engineer with the DOH
Bureau of Food Sanitation, Taiwan is still assessing the possibility
of reopening its market to beef products from the United States and
Canada, and related personnel have continuously been dispatched to
the two countries for on-site inspections.
</P>
<P>
If the Taiwan inspectors are satisfied with their findings,
Taiwan may reopen its doors to U.S. and Canadian beef and beef
products before the end of 2004, Hsieh said.
</P>
<P>
The reopening, however, will be feasible only on the premise that
no new cases of mad-cow disease are reported, Hsieh noted.
</P>
<P>
He added that even if Taiwan agrees to re-introduce U.S. beef in
the near future, such imports will all be beef and meat products, and
brain and spine parts will not be considered.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan purchased $325 million-worth of U.S. beef and beef
products in 2003.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) officials reported Oct. 26
that Taiwan had agreed in principle to resume such imports.
</P>
<P>
Dr. J.B. Penn, undersecretary for Farm and Foreign Agricultural
Services, met with Taiwan health and agriculture officials early in
October for talks on the matter, USDA officials said.
</P>
<P>
The Taiwan officials have indicated that they are close to
completing the reviews necessary for resuming the beef trade, with
on-site inspections as the final step in the process, according to
the USDA news release.
</P>
<P>
"We are very pleased with this progress in yet another important
beef market, " Agriculture Secretary Ann M. Veneman said. "We are
continuing our market opening efforts in the remaining key countries.
Our goal is a return to normal beef trade as quickly as possible."
</P>
<P>
According to Penn, the United States and Japan concluded an
agreement in Tokyo Oct. 23 that paves the way for a partial
resumption of the beef trade between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Japan was the largest importer of U.S. beef before it imposed a
ban last year, with annual beef imports from the United States
amounting to more than US$1.4 billion, or more than 30 percent of
total U.S. beef exports.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan was the sixth-largest importer of U.S. beef before it
imposed the ban. Only Mexico continued to import U.S. beef and beef
products after the discovery of the case of mad cow, according to
USDA.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Hsieh said, Taiwan is not planning to reopen its doors
to Japanese beef and related products, which were banned in March
2000 after mad cow disease was reported in that country.

PRC HAS NO RIGHT TO CENSURE TAIWAN AD: GIO
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Satiago,  Chile, Nov. 18 (CNA)
(By Kuan Chung-wei and Deborah Kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The People's Republic of China has
no right to censure advertisements run by Taiwan, which is another
economic entity and a formal member of the Asia-Pacific Economic
Cooperation (APEC) forum, a Government Information Office (GIO)
official said here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Yi Rong-tsung, deputy director-general of the GIO, who is
incumbent spokesman for the Taiwan APEC delegation, said Taiwan
agreed to scrap a promotional commercial, which had absolutely no
political content or implication, in order not to cause inconvenience
for the host country, Chile.
</P>
<P>
Yi said that the two-minute, four-segment commercial -- dubbed
into English and describing how Taiwan has struggled "from humble
beginnings, laboring in the fields, but gradually worked toward
building a nation one day at a time" -- was not meant to provoke
anyone or any APEC economy.
</P>
<P>
The people of Taiwan have realized the dream of a better tomorrow
and have succeeded in creating a prosperous modern society. At the
dawn of the 21st Century, Taiwan has already walked toward an even
brighter future, the commercial said.
</P>
<P>
Beijing lodged two written protests with the APEC Secretariat
several days ago against the TV commercial, produced by the GIO and
screened at the APEC International Media Center, demanding that it be
removed immediately.
</P>
<P>
Beijing claimed that the use of the word "nation" in the ad went
against the "consensus" and "normal practice" of the annual
conference. It also charged that the wording of the ad was clearly
"inappropriate" and "politically oriented."
</P>
<P>
Responding to the protests, the APEC Secretariat requested that
Taiwan edit the ad's content.
</P>
<P>
Yi said that Taiwan agreed to scrap the ad but refused to edit
the content on the grounds that each member economy of the APEC
should be on an equal footing when promoting their own country. "The
request was a humiliation of our national dignity and a heinous move
to belittle our international status," Yi said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the furor over the ad raised concern in the Chilean
media. Ultimas Noticias (Latest News) , a major, mass-circulation
daily, contributed an entire page Thursday to the matter, including
an interview with David Lee, director of the GIO International
Information Services Department, who flew into Santiago from Taipei
particularly to smooth out the controversy surrounding the ad.

<P>
"The Beauty of Traditional Chinese Music, " also known as "The

NO MAJOR CHANGES LIKELY IN ROC LEGISLATIVE STRUCTURE: U.S. SCHOLAR
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Washington,  Nov. 18 (CNA)
(By Oliver Lin and Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An American scholar said Thursday that
Taiwan's year-end legislative elections are not expected to give an
absolute majority to any political camp, which she said will help
avert a crisis resulting from possible major changes to the
Constitution.
</P>
<P>
Shelley Rigger, brown associate professor of political science at
Davidson College, made the remarks during a seminar on Taiwan's Dec.
11 legislative elections, which was presided over by Richard Bush,
former American Institute in Taiwan chairman and currently a director
of the Brookings Center for Northeast Asian Policy Studies (CNAPS) in
Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
Rigger speculated that the results of the legislative elections
will not lead to major changes in terms of the number of seats held
by each party and that the structure of the legislature will
basically remain intact.
</P>
<P>
President Chen Shui-bian won his second four-year term by a
narrow margin in the March 20 presidential election, but according to
Rigger, his hope of translating this into a major victory in the Dec.
11 elections may prove to be limited.
</P>
<P>
She said that most of the candidates in the Dec. 11 elections are
incumbent legislators seeking re-election. The current multiple-seat
election system, which often sees several candidates from a political
party vying for seats from their comrades of the same party in the
constituency, also means that personal attributes of individual
candidates take precedence over their party affiliation.
</P>
<P>
For this reason, she predicted, even if the "pan-green camp" of
the ruling Democratic Progressive Party and its ally the Taiwan
Solidarity Union can garner more seats in the new legislature, the
changes will not be too big and the main structure of the legislature
will not undergo dramatic change. Currently, the opposition "pan-blue
alliance" of the Kuomintang and the People First Party enjoy a slim
majority in the legislature.
</P>
<P>
She noted that even if the "pan-green camp" garners between 105
and 109 seats, as it has estimated before, it will still be a
relative majority and not an absolute majority in the 225-seat
legislature.
</P>
<P>
For this reason, she said, the "pan-green camp" will still be
short of the absolute majority needed to make major changes to the
Constitution as advocated by the DPP.
</P>
<P>
Such changes would undoubtedly raise the ire of Beijing and could
precipitate a crisis in the Taiwan Strait, she added.
</P>
<P>
However, Liu Shih-fang, former Executive Yuan secretary-general
and currently a visiting fellow at the Bookings Institute, said on
the same occasion that while the "pan-green camp" can garner about
110 seats, still short of an outright majority, it will have no major
difficulties in soliciting the support of independent legislators
when reviewing bills.
</P>
<P>
An official from the U.S. State Department also asked about a
major issue in the Dec. 11 elections -- the Executive Yuan's proposal
for a NT$610.8 billion (US$18.23 billion) special budget for a major
military procurement from the United States -- mainly for six Patriot
PAC-3 missile batteries, eight diesel-electric submarines and a
squadron of 12 P-3C anti-submarine aircraft.
</P>
<P>
W. Michael Meserve noted that Taiwan's defense spending has gone
</P>
<P>
down every year and asked if the island can surpass partisan
politics to make possible an increased defense spending.
</P>
<P>
His question went unanswered. But John J. Tkacik, Jr. a research
fellow on China policy at the Heritage Foundation, said that judging
from recent remarks by Richard P. Lawless, deputy under secretary of
defense for Asia-Pacific affairs, when he exhorted Taiwan to stop
dallying and buy U.S. arms, the result of the year-end legislative
elections could well be a touchstone for U.S-Taiwan relations in
years ahead.

The 2004 Honduras Trade Week and Product
Fair opened Friday at the Taipei World Trade Center, one of a series
of activities organized by Honduran Ambassador Marlene Villela to
boost bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
High-ranking Honduran government officials, including the
presidential secretary-general and the trade and industry minister,
delivered congratulations via video, in which they voiced their firm
willingness to sign a free trade agreement (FTA) with Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Vice President Annette Lu, who presided over the opening of the
fair, echoed their sentiments by reiterating her plan to lead a
delegation to visit the Republic of China Central American diplomatic
ally next year to further increase two-way relations.
</P>
<P>
Lu said that she is looking forward to sustainable development in
Taiwan-Honduran exchanges on a broad range of fronts and she thanked
the Honduran government and people for their long-term support and
friendship of Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
The Honduran trade show will also be staged in central Taichung
City and southern Tainan City.
</P>
<P>
Under the arrangement of Villela, the Ministry of Economic
Affairs (MOEA) and the Taiwan External Trade and Development Council,
a Honduran trade-promotion mission is currently visiting Taiwan,
where it has conducted more than 60 meetings with Taiwan businessmen.
</P>
<P>
According to Economic Affairs Vice Minister Chen Ruey-long,
Honduras is Taiwan's leading coffee supplier in Central America and
from June this year, it began to provide Taiwan consumers with
high-grade beef at competitive prices.
</P>
<P>
Chen said that the MOEA has invited the Honduran trade and
industry minister to visit Taiwan next year to start bilateral FTA
talks.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan enjoys a long-term surplus in its trade with Honduras, but
imports from the Central American country have been increasing in
recent years. For the first 10 months of this year, Taiwan imports
from Honduras totaled US$2.7 million.

U.S. President George W. Bush is expected
to continue to try to stabilize the triangular relations between
Taipei, Washington and Beijing, given the long-term Taiwan-U.S.
friendship, Taiwan's envoy to the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation
forum (APEC) summit said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Lee Yuan-tseh said the ongoing Cabinet reshuffle in the Bush
administration should not cause any change in U.S. policy toward
Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks upon arrival in the Chilean capital to attend
the APEC leader's conference, set for Nov. 20-21, on behalf of
President Chen Shui-bian.
</P>
<P>
Bush and mainland Chinese President Hu Jintao will hold talks on
the sidelines of the summit, with issues concerning Taiwan expected
to take center stage.
</P>
<P>
Pointing out that Chen has displayed willingness to improve
cross-Taiwan Strait relations on many occasions since his second
inauguration in May, Lee said he will pass on Chen's resolve to
pursue cross-strait stability to Hu if he sees him during the summit.
</P>
<P>
On the agenda of the summit, Lee proposed that APEC leaders put
their heads together for measures to prevent inflation as the global
economy recovers.
</P>
<P>
Lee said he hopes APEC member nations will learn from the Asian
financial crisis, the 911 terror attacks and the severe acute
respiratory syndrome outbreaks, and will work together to stabilize
the Asia-Pacific trade and investment environment and strive for
security, regional peace and economic prosperity.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan will share its economic and technological achievements
with other members to narrow development gaps for the goal of common
prosperity, he said.
</P>
<P>
Also, he said, the development of energy recycling technologies
is becoming a crucial issue on the APEC agenda in the face of the
challenge of a possible imbalance between oil supply and demand.

trillion, up 20.22 percent from the previous year's level, while
direct exports totaled NT$3.3040 trillion, up 20.33 percent from the
previous year's level.
</P>
<P>
In terms of sector, sales of electronic parts and components were
NT$564 billion in the third quarter, up 27.18 percent from the
previous year, mainly because of strong demand from mainland China
and Europe and the phasing out of the high-end cell phone panel.
</P>
<P>
Sales of the chemical material industry totaled NT$268
billion in the third quarter, up 38.09 percent from the previous
year, thanks to the high international crude oil price and the
accidents of naphtha cracker plants.
</P>
<P>
In the textile industry, sales grew by 7.13 percent to NT$72.3
billion after manufacturers adjusted their operation strategies,
strengthened research and development and adjusted prices following
price increases for upstream raw materials.

<TEXT>
<P>
Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou shared his
achievements in administering the capital city Friday with a group of
visiting young political leaders from the United States.
</P>
<P>
Ma pointed out that he has put a great deal of effort into
developing Taipei as a "cyber city" by implementing measures such as
providing free e-mail boxes and computer courses for residents.
</P>
<P>
While 90 percent of residents are familiar with computer use, 84
percent know how to use the Internet, Ma noted.
</P>
<P>
Also, Internet networking equipment is available now in every
classroom in primary schools and the city government is working to
establish a wireless Internet infrastructure in the city, Ma said.
</P>
<P>
Showing off the city government's achievements in garbage
classification and recycling, Ma said each resident used to produce
an average of 1.1 kg of garbage per day in the past, an amount that
has been cut by half after the city government started to charge
garbage collection fees on a per-bag basis.
</P>
<P>
The mayor said the "garbage revolution" has been a success and is
the pride of the city government, adding that the city will continue
to try to attain the goal of "zero garbage output, full resource
recycling."
</P>
<P>
The 11-member delegation of the American Council of Young
Political Leaders (ACYPL) is led by New Jersey's Hamilton Township
Council President Daniel Benson.
</P>
<P>
In addition to observing the Dec. 11 legislative elections, the
group will visit the Legislative Yuan, the Ministry of Foreign
Affairs and major technological firms around the country.

TAITUNG CHIEF WITHDRAWS FROM PFP IN ORDER TO STUMP FOR DPP CANDIDATE
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Nov.  19 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taitung County Magistrate Hsu Ching-yuan
quit the opposition People First Party (PFP) Friday to pave the way
for his stumping for the Democratic Progressive Party's (DPP's) sole
candidate in his county for the Dec. 11 legislative elections.
</P>
<P>
While announcing his decision to renounce his PFP membership, Hsu
also confirmed that he will deliver on his promise to stump for Hsu
Jui-kuei, the DPP's sole candidate in the eastern county, in a
campaign rally Saturday together with President Chen Shui-bian, who
doubles as DPP chairman.
</P>
<P>
"It's a painful decision for me to withdraw from the PFP, " Hsu
said, adding that he made the decision mainly because he intends to
seek maximum benefits for Taitung voters.
</P>
<P>
"By endorsing the DPP candidate, I hope to cooperate closely with
the DPP administration in carrying out two critical infrastructure
construction projects to accelerate the county's economic
development," he said.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the expansion of the southlink highway -- which
connects Taitung County with the booming western part of the island
-- and the construction of the Fukang fishing port are crucial to
Taitung's long-term development, Hsu said he hopes the two projects
can be completed as early as possible.
</P>
<P>
"Putting aside politics and giving the top priority to local
construction are my primary concerns in deciding to endorse the DPP
candidate," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
As the PFP's ally -- the Kuomintang (KMT) -- has fielded a
candidate in the Taitung constituency, Hsu said he must renounce his
PFP membership before stumping for the DPP candidate, in order to
spare PFP Chairman James Soong a headache.
</P>
<P>
He further said he supports a merger of the PFP and the KMT.
Nevertheless, he went on, he has no intention of joining such a
merged party. If the two parties fail to merge, he continued, he is
also unlikely to return to the PFP ranks, nor will he join the DPP.
"I'll keep my status as a non-partisan independent in the future," he
added.
</P>
<P>
It is believed his support will give DPP candidate Hsu Jui-kuei's
legislative bid a big boost. The DPP has never been able to win a
legislative seat in the eastern rural county, which has long been a
KMT stronghold.
</P>
<P>
DPP Secretary-General Chang Chun-hsiung said the DPP appreciates
Hsu's endorsement of its legislative candidate and will respect his
decision to maintain his independent status instead of joining the
DPP ranks.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the PFP issued a statement expressing its regret over
Hsu's decision and condemning the DPP for dangling a "carrot" in
front of him, which has given him no choice but to comply with the
DPP's wishes if he hopes to realize his campaign promise of
accelerating Taitung's development.

RESEARCHER CONFIDENT OF TAIWAN'S BIOMEDICAL INDUSTRY
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Nov.  19 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taiwan is strong in the biochemistry,
semiconductor and display industries, an advantage which will help
the country become a front-runner in developing a competitive
biomedical industry, a well-known researcher said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Wong Chi-huey, director of the Gene Research Center at the
Institute of Botany under Academia Sinica, made the remarks while
giving a speech at the 2004 International Symposium for Chinese
Medicinal Chemists held at National Taiwan University.
</P>
<P>
Claiming that Taiwan stands a good chance of creating a
competitive biomedical industry due to its abundant hi-tech manpower
and rich know-how as well as full government support and a sound
environment, Wong said that the country should also use its
advantages to develop new technologies and devices for disease
examination.
</P>
<P>
But he suggested that Taiwan set its sights on making new
medicines, although it is a time consuming task that warrants
visionary moves over the long term.
</P>
<P>
For instance, he said, Taiwan is suitable to study the virus of
the potentially deadly severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and
make effective drugs to tackle it amid public concern that SARS might
stage a comeback as peak winter season approaches.
</P>
<P>
Despite the fact that mainland researchers have been keen on
producing new medications by mixing traditional Chinese medicines and
Western drugs, he pointed out that they have not developed any new
drugs that have been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration (FDA).
</P>
<P>
He said that he is confident that Taiwan will be able to produce
new medicines that can pass the FDA's strict requirements. "Only by
surpassing the FDA's thresholds can drugs made by Taiwan make inroads
into the global market and that is the correct path for the domestic
biomedical industry to walk, " he said.

<P>
The government has detected 5,088 attacks
allegedly launched by a mainland Chinese "cyber army" on its official
Web sites in September and October, according to a report released
Friday by the National Information and Communications Security
Taskforce (ICST).
</P>
<P>
Following a massive, organized cyber attack against Taiwan near
the March 20 presidential election, Chinese hackers again started
large-scale attacks against the island in September and October, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
The hackers first invaded the Web systems of private companies
and civil organizations with weak security as a "springboard" for
them to gain access to the Web systems of government agencies, it
said.
</P>
<P>
After they succeeded in doing this, they would change the
information posted on the Web sites and even steal some other
information stored in the government's computer systems, the report
said.
</P>
<P>
To protect itself from these attacks, the government has enhanced
its monitoring of suspicious e-mails and stepped up firewalling and
the detection of spyware, it said.

FORMER CZECH REPUBLIC PRESIDENT HAVEL HAPPY TO BE IN TAIWAN
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Nov.  19 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Former Czech Republic President Vaclav
Havel said Friday he takes great pleasure in coming to Taiwan for a
visit.
</P>
<P>
Havel made the remarks after his arrival at Chiang Kai-shek
International Airport for his first-ever visit to Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
"From file photos, I come to know that Taiwan is a beautiful
island. I'm very delighted to be able to visit your country, " Havel
told ROC Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Ouyang Jui-hsiung, who
greeted Havel at the airport.
</P>
<P>
Havel is being accompanied by his wife, doctors and close aides
on his six-day visit to Taiwan at the invitation of President Chen
Shui-bian and the Taiwan Foundation for Democracy (TFD).
</P>
<P>
In consideration of his health, TFD officials said Havel's
itinerary is not a busy one so that he can have enough time to rest.
Smoking resulted in Havel having to have a lung removed.
</P>
<P>
As Havel has keen interest in Taiwan's arts, culture and customs,
his itinerary includes visits to the National Palace Museum and
several aboriginal cultural museums.
</P>
<P>
During his stay, Havel will receive a decoration from President
Chen for his contribution to the promotion of Taiwan-Czech Republic
ties and his versatile career achievements, particularly his courage
in keeping alive the "flame of democracy" when his country was under
communist rule.
</P>
<P>
Havel will deliver a speech on the future of globalization and
democracy as well as receive an honorary doctorate from National
Chengchi University. His itinerary also includes meetings with local
academics, artists and literary celebrities.
</P>
<P>
A resourceful man, Havel has had multifaceted roles throughout
his career -- a poet, playwright, dissident, democracy activist,
thinker and politician. He formally ended his 12-year presidency in
February 2003.
</P>
<P>
After his retirement, diplomatic officials said, Havel
immediately planned to visit Taiwan. But he later chose to stay in
his country to help stabilize the domestic political situation
following the transfer of power. Early this year, Havel planned to
visit Taiwan and several other Asian countries to promote his new
book. However, his Asian tour stopped in India and he canceled the
remaining itinerary due to health reasons.
</P>
<P>
Havel played a pivotal role in his country's "velvet revolution"
of 1989. He used his literary and theatrical creations to kindle and
keep the flame of democracy burning amidst a storm of repression and
autocracy during communist rule. He eventually led his country to
break the shackles of communist suppression and move toward
democracy. During his presidency, he continued working hard to
consolidate the Czech Republic's democratic system as well as promote
human rights and social justice, earning wide respect and admiration
from his fellow countrymen.
</P>
<P>
Havel has been very friendly toward Taiwan because of his
dedication to democracy and courage in standing up to mainland
China's pressure.
</P>
<P>
During his presidency, Havel invited then-ROC President Lee
Teng-hui to attend an international forum in Prague. Incumbent ROC
first lady Wu Shu-jen and former Vice President Lien Chan have also
visited the Czech Republic. In 1995, Havel spoke for Taiwan's bid to
join the United Nations at an annual U.N. General Assembly plenary
session. He is one of the few world leaders willing to publicly throw
support behind Taiwan without fearing Beijing's backlash.
</P>
<P>
To welcome Havel's visit, Taipei National University of the Arts
has designated November as its "Month of Vaclav Havel Art." In
addition to performing Havel's plays, the university has also
organized many other activities during the period of Nov. 5-24,
including a Havel book fair and a series of seminars on Havel's
artistic and political achievements, as well as a Czech film
festival.

A total of 86 investment plans made by
overseas Chinese and foreigners in Taiwan were approved in October by
the Investment Commission under the Ministry of Economic Affairs
(MOEA), a commission spokesman reported Friday.

New York Times: Judiciary panel backing
Specter as its chairman.

Senator Arlen Specter, the Pennsylvania Republican under attack
by some conservatives as too liberal to lead the Senate Judiciary
Committee, won the unanimous backing of the panel's Republicans on
Thursday, a move that appears to guarantee that he will become
chairman when the new Congress convenes in January. The committee
will not take a formal vote until January, when it is reconstituted
with new members, and the entire Republican caucus must ratify the
appointment.

Wall Street Journal: The deregulator, a less-visible role for the
Fed chief: freeing up markets.

As Alan Greenspan approaches his last year as chairman of the
Federal Reserve Board, he continues to draw praise for his most
visible job: steering the economy by raising and lowering interest
rates. But behind the scenes, the 78-year-old economist has had a big
impact on American life in an entirely different role: pushing the
government to stay out of financial markets.

NO LOCAL STEAKHOUSES SELLING JAPANESE BEEF: HEALTH DEPARTMENT
</HEADLINE>

(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Department of Health said Friday it has
not found any local steakhouses selling Japanese beef.
</P>
<P>
The department was responding to a newspaper report that said
many local steakhouses were still selling Japanese beef even though
the government had banned imports of the meat in March 2000 over
concerns of foot-and-mouth and mad cow diseases.
</P>
<P>
Health department officials said they conducted 1,810 spot-checks
on domestic steakhouses last year, including 14 stores that publicly
advertised that they were selling premium brand-name Japanese beef,
such as Kobe and Matsusaka beef.
</P>
<P>
"None of the stores inspected were selling Japanese beef," said
Hsieh Ting- hung, a health department official in charge of food
sanitation.
</P>
<P>
Hsieh said the health department will intensify inspection of
steakhouses that boast of having Kobe or Matsusaka beef. If they
decline to produce documents proving the origins or sources of their
beef, Hsieh said they will face a fine ranging between NT$30,000 and
NT$150,000 and their names will be published as part of the penalty.
</P>
<P>
So-called Kobe beef or Matsusaka beef refers to cattle breeding
methods rather than cattle origins.
</P>
<P>
If any steakhouse is found to have imported beef from Japan,
Hsieh said, it will be slapped a fine ranging between NT$60,000 and
NT$1.5 million, in addition to having all its beef destroyed.
</P>
<P>
According to customs authorities, no Japanese beef was imported
into Taiwan in the first nine months of this year. The main sources
of imported beef have been Australia, Panama and New Zealand.
</P>
<P>
Restaurants, tourist hotels and supermarkets that were mentioned
by local media as selling Kobe or Matsusaka beef also rushed to
clarify that their beef came from cattle raised in Australia with
Japanese breeding methods.

VANUATU PRIME MINISTER REAFFIRMS TIES WITH TAIWAN: FOREIGN MINISTRY
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Vanuatu Prime Minister Serge Vohor has
reaffirmed that there is no change in his country's diplomatic
relations with Taiwan, Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) spokesman
Michel Lu said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Vohor made the reaffirmation during a meeting with MOFA staff
members stationed in the Vanuatu capital of Port-Vila earlier in the
day, Lu said.
</P>
<P>
"Vohor assured our officials that ties between the two countries
remain unchanged. Nevertheless, he said he needs a bit more time to
confer with a few members of his Cabinet who have different opinions
about forging diplomatic ties with Taiwan," Lu said.
</P>
<P>
He further said Vohor will deliver an administrative report at
his country's parliament. Vohor is expected to report on the
establishment of diplomatic relations between Vanuatu and Taiwan in
his report, Lu added.
</P>
<P>
According to Lu, the Republic of China's provisional Embassy has
begun operations at Le Meridien Hotel in Port-Vila. "Relations
between our two countries are proceeding normally, " he said, adding
that the Embassy hoists the ROC national flag from 8 a.m. through 5
p.m. each day.
</P>
<P>
Noting that Vohor is Vanuatu's top government leader, Lu said the
joint communique signed by Vohor and ROC Minister of Foreign Affairs
Tan Sun Chen in Taipei Nov. 3 on establishing bilateral formal
diplomatic ties is fully valid. The confirmation of Vanuatu's Cabinet
is only a formality and will by no means affect the validity of
Taiwan-Vanuatu ties, Lu added.
</P>
<P>
He further said a media report about Vanuatu reneging on its
newly forged diplomatic ties with Taiwan was groundless. He dismissed
it as "a lie" put into circulation by Beijing.

Independent Legislator Tsai Hau from
Pingtung, southern Taiwan was prosecuted in his hometown Friday for
buying votes in the 2001 legislative elections, and the prosecutor
from the Pingtung Prosecutor's Office is seeking a six-year jail
term.
</P>
<P>
Also prosecuted were Tsai's wife, Soong Li-hua, and 34 of his
former campaign workers; each was recommended by the prosecutor to
jail terms of three years and six months.
</P>
<P>
Another 722 were prosecuted for going on overseas tours financed
partially by Tsai. The prosecutor is seeking six months in jail for
each of them.
</P>
<P>
According to the prosecutor, Tsai gave handouts varying from
NT$3,000 to NT$5,000 to each of the 722 voters under the pretext that
anyone who subscribed to the Commons Daily for one year would get
money to go toward an overseas tour.
</P>
<P>
The prosecutor said in his statement of charges that the 722
voters visited Japan or Thailand between February and October, 2001
in 22 groups, fully aware that part of their fare was coming from
Tsai. Tsai, his wife or his campaign workers accompanied these groups
on the tours.
</P>
<P>
Tsai, whose three-year term runs out next February, is running
for re-election, and could not be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Justice Chen Ding-nan was reported to be angry with
the fact that the prosecutor took three years to finish the
investigation and filed the charges only weeks before the Dec. 11
legislative elections. He said that this has left the impression that
the release of the indictment was timed to block Tsai's chance of
winning re-election.
</P>
<P>
Chung Rung-sung, a chief prosecutor at the Pingtung Prosecutor's
Office said too many people were involved in the case and it took
time to question each of them.

Dirk Sanger, chairman of the European
Chamber of Commerce in Taipei (ECCT) left recently for Brussels to
give his chamber's annual report about Taiwan's business climate to
the European Commission under the European Union (EU).
</P>
<P>
Before embarking on his trip, Sanger said he would urge the
EU to support Taiwan's bid to join the World Health Organization and
facilitate the normalization of business exchanges between Taiwan and
the mainland.
</P>
<P>
Sanger said that most European companies have relocated part of
their manufacturing operations to the mainland, and Taiwan's
restrictions on imports of Chinese-made products have virtually shut
these European companies' goods out of Taiwan, not to mention the
absence of direct transportation links between Taiwan and the
mainland, which has damaged European companies' competitiveness in
Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Sanger's complaints were included in the ECCT's annual report and
have already been made known to Taiwan authorities.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan officials defended the island's policy of restricting
imports from the mainland, arguing that it has already opened its
markets to mainland Chinese goods wide enough and shifted the blame
for the lack of direct transportation links to the mainland and the
Beijing authorities.

SIX-YEAR HIGH ECONOMIC GROWTH RATE ESTIMATED FOR 2004 AT 5.93 PERCENT
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Nov.  19 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The government raised its forecast for
Taiwan's economic growth rate Friday for the whole of 2004 to a
six-year high of 5.93 percent, up from 5.87 percent predicted in
August.
</P>
<P>
The Cabinet-level Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and
Statistics (DGBAS) renewed its estimate following a screening meeting
involving the country's newest figures and data.
</P>
<P>
The DGBAS also reported that the Taiwan economy expanded by 5.27
percent in this year's third quarter and it predicted that it will
grow by 4.11 percent in the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
DGBAS Director-General Hsu Chang-yao attributed the upward
adjustment of the full-year economic growth rate to a sound domestic
economy well underpinned by a global economic recovery since the
beginning of this year, which peaked in the middle of the year.
</P>
<P>
According to Hsu, the performance of the domestic economy this
year will be better than the world's average of 4.2 percent, the
United States' 4.4 percent, South Korea's 4.3 percent and Japan's 4.1
percent.
</P>
<P>
The country's outbound and inbound shipments also increased by
23.5 percent and 34.7 percent, respectively, during the
January-October period year-on-year, he said, adding that per capita
income will hit US$13,995 for 2004.
</P>
<P>
However, he pointed out that Taiwan's economic growth rate for
2005 will be around 4.56 percent as a result of an anticipated slower
economic upturn across the world.
</P>
<P>
But he forecast that per capital income will increase to an
all-time high of US$14,961 next year, thanks to the government's
drive to improve the country's infrastructure and boost local
consumption and investment.

MAC URGES BEIJING TO EXPRESS CLEAR STANCE ON CHARTER FLIGHTS

<TEXT>
<P>
Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) Vice
Chairman Liu Teh-hsun urged mainland China Friday to make clear its
attitude toward the opening of direct two-way charter passenger
flights across the Taiwan Strait during the upcoming Chinese Lunar
New Year holiday.
</P>
<P>
Liu said the MAC has unveiled a comprehensive package of measures
for the proposed charter flight services.
</P>
<P>
"We hope Beijing will speak up as to what it wants to do
regarding the proposal and start negotiations with Taiwan over the
issue to facilitate the return of Taiwan business people operating in
mainland China for family reunions during the lunar new year
holiday," Liu said.
</P>
<P>
The MAC has authorized the Taipei Airlines Association to
negotiate with its mainland counterpart.
</P>
<P>
With Beijing's consent, Taiwan carriers operated special charter
flights between Shanghai and Taipei/Kaohsiung via Hong Kong/Macau
during the 2003 Chinese New Year period. The services were not
offered during the 2004 Chinese New Year holiday because Beijing
insisted that mainland carriers be also allowed to provide the same
flight services while declining to negotiate the necessary technical
details with Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
The ROC government said that as the opening of two-way, non-stop
cross-strait charter flight services involves the exercise of public
authority, prior negotiations are necessary. The upcoming lunar new
year holiday falls between Feb. 6-13, 2005.

PRESIDENT:  LEGISLATIVE PRESIDENT SHOULD HEAD CONTROL YUAN
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  Nov.  19 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President Chen Shui-bian said Friday he
will name Wang Jin-pyng, currently president of the Legislative Yuan,
to head the Control Yuan.
</P>
<P>
Stumping in Hsinchu, northern Taiwan for a legislative candidate
of his Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) , the president said the
chief of the Legislative Yuan should be one detached from politics;
therefore, Wang, who is a vice chairman of the opposition Kuomintang
(KMT), is not suitable for the post.
</P>
<P>
Chen said he would name Wang to head the Control Yuan, and would
wait until after the Dec. 11 legislative elections to nominate
candidates, including Wang, for members of the Control Yuan.
</P>
<P>
The president's nominees for Control Yuan members have to be
approved by the Legislative Yuan.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, DPP convener at the Legislative Yuan,
Legislator Ker Chien-ming, said his party recommended Wang to
President Chen as head of the Control Yuan to rescue Wang
who, Ker claimed, has been held political hostage by KMT Chairman
Lien Chan and Lien's political ally, People First Party Chairman
James Soong in the elections.
</P>
<P>
Wang, who was named as the KMT's first choice for lawmakers-at
-large, and who was campaigning for KMT candidates in the race,
passed over DPP's proposal as a joke.
</P>
<P>
KMT spokesmen Chang Rung-kung decried Chen's statement as a
political trick to alienate Wang from the KMT, noting that Chen
has claimed that he would name another KMT vice chairman, Wu
Poh-hsiung, as head of the Control Yuan sometime before.
</P>
<P>
As a response to Chen's statement, Legislator Huang Teh-fu, KMT
secretary at the Legislative Yuan, said facetiously that his party
suggested Chen name Vice President Annette Lu as the head of the
Control Yuan and she would probably find out the truth behind the
March 19 shooting.

TAIWANESE WOULD BE PLEASED TO SEE PRESIDENT AT APEC: ENVOY

<P>
Taiwanese would be pleased to see
President Chen Shui-bian attend the the 2004 Economic Leaders'
Meeting of the Asia-Pacific Economic (APEC) forum set to begin here
Saturday, Chen's envoy to the meeting, Lee Yuan-tseh, said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The APEC leaders' meeting has been off-limits to Taiwan's
president ever since it began in 1993 because of Beijing's
opposition, and Lee has been named by Chen as his envoy to the
meeting for the last two years.
</P>
<P>
In a veiled attempt to air Taiwan's grievance, Lee told a news
conference that the Taiwanese would like to see their president speak
for them in international conferences.
</P>
<P>
He touted Taiwan's contributions to APEC, saying that his country
has followed up on its call last year for narrowing the gap among
members in digital technology by sending six teams of experts to help
13 member economies.
</P>
<P>
Predicting an outbreak of avian flu next year, Lee said his
country will suggest that APEC come up with a prevention program,
adding that Taiwan will funnel US$20 million into developing a
vaccine against the disease, which will be enough to meet Taiwan's
own needs with some left over for other countries.
</P>
<P>
Lee, who is president of Academia Sinica, Taiwan's highest
research body, expressed his concerns that many countries are pursuing
economic development on the wrong assumption that natural resources
are inexhaustible.
</P>
<P>
Instead of exploiting nature for endless economic development,
the winner of the 1986 Nobel prize in chemistry said mankind should
try to balance development with the preservation of nature.
</P>
<P>
Lee, who arrived in Santiago Thursday, told a dinner party in his
honor the following evening that many people he has had contact with
here are worried about Taiwan's strained ties with mainland China.
"We hope peace will prevail in the Taiwan Strait for ever and we will
do our best to achieve that goal," he said.

<P>
Taiwan hopes to ink a free trade
agreement (FTA) with Chile to enhance bilateral trade relations,
Taiwan's envoy to the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit
in the Chilean capital of Santiago said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Lee Yuan-tseh, who attended the summit on behalf of President
Chen Shui-bian, made the remarks in response to questions on how to
enhance bilateral trade relations between Taiwan and Chile when he
was interviewed by Chilean TV channels TVN and UCV, as well as by
United Press International.
</P>
<P>
Lee also said Chilean President Ricardo Lagos' idea of an
Asia-Pacific FTA is worth studying.
</P>
<P>
During a separate interview with the Associated Press, Lee said
that Taiwan, in addition to developing its own economy, is willing to
cooperate with other APEC members to promote regional economic
prosperity.
</P>
<P>
He noted that APEC consists of developed countries, such as the
United States, Japan and Canada, and developing countries, with
Taiwan in between, which will enable it to play a major role in
contributing to the regional organization.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan is capable and determined to contribute to APEC, the Nobel
laureate said.
</P>
<P>
He also said that Taiwan has rich experience in its development
of small- and medium-sized enterprises, as well as having excellent
information technology and an e-government that can be of reference
to other countries.

2004 WHOLESALE, CONSUMER PRICES TO RISE: DGBAS
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Nov. 20 (CNA)
(By Y.F. Low)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taiwan's wholesale price index (WPI) and
consumer price index (CPI) are expected to rise 7.2 percent and 1.8
percent, respectively, in 2004, according to a forecast by the
Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics (DGBAS)
released Saturday.
</P>
<P>
With the costs of imports having jumped significantly this year
due to soaring oil and raw material prices, the WPI stood at 10.4
percent in the third quarter and is expected to amount to 9.4 percent
in the fourth quarter, the report says.
</P>
<P>
The CPI, on the other hand, saw a less vigorous increase of 2.9
percent in the third quarter and is expected to register a 2.6
percent rise in the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
While prices for foodstuffs soared as a result of typhoon damage,
commodity prices mostly remained stable because of market
competition, and the fall in housing rentals also helped even up
service prices, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
On the outlook for 2005, the DGBAS predicted that pressure on
prices will become more moderate as the appreciation of the new
Taiwan dollar is expected to lower import costs.
</P>
<P>
Next year's WPI and CPI are expected to rise 2 percent and 1.9
percent, respectively, according to the DGBAS.

The head of the semi-official Taiwan
External Trade Development Council (TAITRA) said he and a delegation
from a South Korean company will climb Yushan, the highest mountain
in northeast Asia, Sunday, as part of an effort to promote tourism
for business visitors.
</P>
<P>
TAITRA Chairman Hsu Chih-jen noted that foreigners made 2.24
million visits to Taiwan last year, with those naming business as
their main purpose for visiting accounting for the most at 698,000,
or 31.08 percent, showing that this is an area worth development.
</P>
<P>
He said that TAITRA has been working with local travel agents to
choose a score of attractive tour routes that will hopefully prompt
business visitors to come to Taiwan or extend their stays in Taiwan
when they visit for exhibitions, conferences and other trade
activities in Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Hsu said he invited Yoon Young Dal, president of Crown
Confectionery Co., to climb Yushan when he visited South Korea last
June. The South Korean company then organized a 19-member team for
the trip.
</P>

Hsu said that he hopes to share the beauty of Taiwan's mountains

SOUTHERN TAIWAN SCIENCE PARK BOOSTS JOBS: POLL
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Nov. 20 (CNA)
(By Y.F. Low)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The jobs available in southern Taiwan now
are nine-fold the level of three years ago following the
establishment of the Southern Taiwan Science Park, according to the
results of a survey released Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The survey was conducted by the 104 Job Bank from Nov. 4-8 among
3,818 job seekers and 222 enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Statistics of the job bank show that 54,982 jobs in southern
Taiwan have been advertised on its Web site so far in November,
compared with 5,796 in the same month of 2001.
</P>
<P>
While openings in the fields of finance, securities and insurance
have increased by 5,056, those in the electronic manufacturing sector
rose by 4,193, and those in the business management and industrial
and commercial consulting sectors increased by 2,688.
</P>
<P>
Positions related to sales and trading were most common, with
15,237 openings available, followed by those related to production
and manufacturing, with 12,139 openings and those related to
engineering and research and development, with 11,470 openings.
</P>
<P>
However, the survey found a wide gap between demand and supply.
</P>
<P>
For example, jobs in the finance, securities and insurance
sectors accounted for 9.9 percent of all the jobs in southern Taiwan,
but only 6.6 percent of the people in that region were interested in
them.
</P>
<P>
The electronic manufacturing sector offered only 8.3 percent of
the openings, but 23.9 percent of people were seeking to enter the
popular sector.
</P>
<P>
Sales personnel positions comprised 30 percent of all openings,
but only 8.7 percent of the survey respondents were willing to take
such jobs.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, 61 percent of the enterprises and 58 percent of the
job seekers surveyed said the scale of the Southern Taiwan Science
Park will catch up with that of the Hsinchu Science-based Industrial
Park in three to five years.
</P>
<P>
On the benefits of working in southern Taiwan, 79.7 percent of
the enterprise respondents named the low cost of living, 53.2 percent
named the relaxed tempo of life, 40 percent named the low housing
costs, and 30.2 percent named the pleasant living environment.
</P>
<P>
On the problems they face in personnel recruitment in the south,
65.3 percent of the respondents said talent is scant, 26.6 percent
cited the high personnel turnover rate and 25.7 percent said their
enterprises are not attractive for new talent.

TAIWAN COMPANIES FEEL THREATENED BY RISING CURRENCY
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Nov.  20 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the face of rapid surges of the new
Taiwan dollar, local companies are worried about a decrease in their
competitiveness overseas, spokesmen for trade groups and industry
associations said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Out of grave concern over losing their competitive edge in
foreign markets, Taiwan businessmen are asking the central bank to
intervene to stem the local currency from further strengthening
pushed up by global hot money on a dwindling U.S. dollar and rampant
speculation over an appreciated mainland China currency early next
year, they said.
</P>
<P>
Lo Hai-chia, an executive of the Taiwan Electrical and Electronic
Manufacturers' Association, said that this recent wave of
appreciation of the domestic currency has been much fiercer than
public expectations, seriously affecting many companies that failed
to hedge in advance.
</P>
<P>
The new Taiwan dollar dropped by NT$0.134 Friday to end at 32.554
against the greenback on the Taipei foreign exchange market. It
finished at 32.42 a day earlier, marking an almost-four-year high. In
the first four days of the week, it picked up NT$0.57 in value.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the Chinese National Federation of Industries
said that the rising new Taiwan dollar has greatly eroded the
competitiveness of home-based export-oriented textile makers and he
pointed out that they have asked the central bank to take measures to
curb any further strengthening.
</P>
<P>
He said that domestic textile makers will be in big trouble
should the local unit continue rising and he urged the central bank
to do something quickly to help them tackle their difficulties.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan posted a trade surplus of US$6.7 billion for the first 10
months of this year, down by a whopping US$7.9 billion from the
previous year's level, a situation he said indicates that Taiwan
companies are much less capable of creating foreign exchange
reserves.
</P>
<P>
If the situation persists, it will deal a heavy blow to the
domestic export sector and lead to many business closures, he warned.
</P>
<P>
Officials of the Cabinet-level Council for Economic Planning and
Development admitted earlier this week that the new Taiwan dollar has
surged too fast recently and that it will cause some negative effects
on domestic businesses. But the impact has yet to be assessed, as
most of the companies would have made efforts to hedge against such
an eventuality.
</P>
<P>
However, they acknowledged that a continuously appreciating local
currency will have a profound impact on export businesses.

TAIWAN, JAPAN URGED TO ENHANCE SECURITY COOPERATION
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Nov.  20 (CNA)
(By Y.F. Low)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taiwan and Japan should maintain closer
security cooperation and exchanges to fend off potential political
and security risks between the two countries and mainland China, the
leader of an Asian studies group from Japan said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Kunihiko Takano said there are many uncertainties in Asia and
these include the Asia policy in the second term of U.S.
President George W. Bush, as well as the mainland's political,
economic and military movements.
</P>
<P>
Takano said the mainland's economic development has faced
challenges such as a shortage of raw materials, food production
reaching the limit for exporting countries, a large amount of
non-performing loans and a severe imbalance in the distribution of
wealth.
</P>
<P>
He said that anti-Japan riots on the mainland, the dispute over
the Tiaoyutai islands, a mainland intrusion into Japan's territorial
waters and Beijing's ignoring of President Chen Shui-bian's peace
overtures show that there are potential political and security risks
between Taiwan, Japan and the mainland.
</P>
<P>
Takano made the remarks during a forum on "China's peaceful rise"
organized by the Foundation on International and Cross-Strait Studies
in Taipei.

CROSS-STRAIT RELATIONS MIGHT FACE NEW CHALLENGES NEXT YEAR: ENVOY
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
London, Nov. 20 (CNA)
(By N.K. Han and Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taiwan's outgoing representative to Britain
said Friday that cross-Taiwan Strait relations might face new
challenges next year because of President Chen Shui-bian's
determination to push through constitutional reforms.
</P>
<P>
Tien Hung-mao made the remarks when he spoke at a farewell dinner
given in his honor by Taiwan businessmen residing in Britain.
</P>
<P>
Tien said Beijing could respond to Chen's insistence on promoting
constitutional reforms, which might cause tension across the strait
and result in a complex and contradictory situation.
</P>
<P>
He noted that since the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks on the United
States three years ago, the U.S. has viewed mainland China as a
cooperation partner in its anti-terrorism campaign. The attack
changed the situation, which cannot be unilaterally reversed by
Taiwan, he added.
</P>
<P>
The seasoned diplomat also said that U.S. President George W.
George is not expected to change his anti-terrorism campaign as
priority policy after winning his second four-year term.
</P>
<P>
But although the United States needs cooperation from the
mainland, it will not be mean to Taiwan, as the core members of the
Bush administration will continue to support the country, he said.
</P>
<P>
The situation in the Taiwan Strait is currently stable, he went
on, adding that this has to do with the attitude of the United
States. On one hand, the U.S. has decided to rein in Taiwan from
taking too-provocative actions against the mainland, while Beijing on
the other hand has shown restraint by not involving the United States
into a possible eruption of conflict in the Taiwan Strait.
</P>
<P>
As the only military superpower in the world, the United States
will continue to play a decisive role in the Taiwan Strait, he said.
</P>
<P>
On cross-strait relations, Tien said that after years of
development, both sides of the strait have formed interdependent
relations. He noted that Taiwan businessmen flock to the mainland to
find outlets for their labor-intensive industries, attracted by the
rich human resources and huge potential mainland market.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the coastal areas of the mainland have good
infrastructure and both sides of the Taiwan Strait also share the
same language, culture and eating habits, he said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that Taiwan businessmen traveling to the mainland do not
necessarily support cross-strait unification and that they only go to
the mainland because they have no choice because of the world trend
of division of labor.
</P>
<P>
A conservative estimate puts Taiwan's investment in the mainland
at at least US$100 billion. The number of Taiwan businessmen,
employees and their dependents who have to live there for over six
months a year is between 600,000 and 700,000, while about 300,000
Taiwanese in the mainland marry mainlanders.
</P>
<P>
With continued investment by Taiwan businessmen, cross-strait
trade has risen rapidly and the mainland has replaced the United
States as Taiwan's largest market. Two-way trade between Taiwan and
the mainland is expected to reach US$60 billion this year, with
Taiwan enjoying a trade surplus of US$40 billion.
</P>
<P>
Tien also predicted that in the next five or 10 years, Beijing
will avoid taking drastic action against Taiwan because of these
closer trade relations, which could be favorable to the unification
of the two sides.
</P>
<P>
He said the Beijing authorities currently have adopted three
strategies with regard to Taiwan: either woo the Taiwan people, warn
them of risky consequences, or use verbal or military intimidation.
</P>
<P>
Basically, he added, the mainland leaders are all hardliners,
though they may employ different methods.
</P>
<P>
Tien predicted that in the end, Beijing will not resort to a
destructive approach for handling cross-strait issues and that Taipei
will also not bet on the lives and property of the 23 million people
of Taiwan.

<P>
The National Fire Administration under the
Ministry of the Interior said Saturday that a visit by the faculty of
a French national firefighting school will help enhance bilateral
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The 34-member group arrived Nov. 14 for a weeklong visit during
which they visited fire departments in various cities and counties,
including Taipei City and Taipei, Nantou, Pingtung, Taitung and
Hualien counties. The group will wind up its visit Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Fire administration officials said that the French group mainly
observed fire prevention work in high-rising buildings, as well as
rescue and evacuation operations for people in such buildings.
</P>
<P>
The officials also said that a student of the school was the main
catalyst behind the visit, noting that the student was one of the
members of a French rescue team who came to Taiwan for rescue
operations in the wake of the devastating earthquake of Sept.
21, 1999, which caused heavy casualties and tremendous property
losses in Taiwan, especially central areas.

PRESIDENT LAUDS FIRST ENCOUNTER BETWEEN TAIWAN, HOLLAND 400 YEARS AGO
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President Chen Shui-bian presided over a
ceremony in Makung, Penghu County, Saturday, to mark the arrival of
Dutch sailors in Penghu 400 years ago, describing it as the first
encounter between Taiwan and the outside world.
</P>
<P>
Citing a story inscribed on a stone tablet unearthed in 1919 at
the site of the Tienhou Temple in Makung, Chen said Dutch sailors
arrived in Penghu in 1604, bringing Taiwan into contact with the
world and opening a new chapter in the country's history.
</P>
<P>
Chen said the arrival of the Dutch in Taiwan put the island onto
the international stage and gave Taiwan an important role to play in
exchanges between the West and the East.
</P>
<P>
According to Chen, the role Taiwan has played in the West-East
exchanges is the same role Penghu plays in the current exchanges
between Taiwan and mainland China.
</P>
<P>
He hailed the significance of Saturday's ceremony, the first of
its kind in Taiwan, claiming that it underlines the fact that Taiwan
is an island of the world.
</P>
<P>
The president said he has a map of Taiwan drawn by Dutch in 1726
hanging in his office to remind him of the Netherlands' contributions
to Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
The tablet found in the Tienhou Temple describes an official of
China's Ming Dynasty who succeeded in expelling a group of Dutch
sailors who landed on Penghu and tried to settle there in 1604.
</P>
<P>
Menno Goedhart, the representative of the Netherlands' Trade and
Investment Office in Taipei, attended Saturday's ceremony, during
which he presented Chen with a bottle of jenever, a traditional Dutch
liquor.
</P>
<P>
Chen also promised to set up a science and technology university
in Penghu by August next year and to start another ferry service
between Kaohsiung and Penghu before the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
After his speech, the president opened an exhibition of Dutch
artifacts at the Tienhou Temple.

the fourth Marriage Day, during which he urged the public to "find
love," which he said is the key to family happiness.
</P>
<P>
The premier attended the event, organized by the Taiwan Blissful
Marriage Promotion Association and held at the Civil Service
Development Institute in Taipei, in the company of his wife. Yu said
his administration has implemented many plans aimed at strengthening
a support network for local families.

KMT CHAIRMAN CALLS FOR 'PAN BLUE' MAJORITY IN NEXT LEGISLATURE
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Nov. 20 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Lien
Chan reiterated his call Saturday for a majority of legislators from
the opposition "pan blue alliance" in the next legislature, in order
to safeguard the future course of the Republic of China.
</P>
<P>
Lien issued the call in southern Kaohsiung City while stumping
for various "pan blue alliance" candidates, including Chiang Yi-wen
and Lo Shih-hsiung of the KMT and Chiu Yi and Chang Hsien-yao of the
People First Party (PFP) in the Dec. 11 legislative elections.
</P>
<P>
Stressing that the outcome of the elections will be of maximum
importance to the country's future, Lien claimed that it is vital to
have more than half of the 225-seat Legislative Yuan held by "pan
blue" lawmakers to defend the country's current system, including its
title and territory, freedom and democracy.
</P>
<P>
The KMT chairman was also critical of the plans for the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) for ruling the country over the
long term, calling it a reflection of an "authoritarian mindset."
</P>
<P>
"100 percent power will lead to 100 percent corruption, " he
said. He also accused the DPP of creating hatred and conflict among
Taiwan's various ethnic groups that has led to social disorder under
its rule.
</P>
<P>
According to Lien, the misery index of the Taiwan people has
peaked at a 20-year high of 7.2 points, as the country's jobless rate
and living costs have remained high without showing signs of cooling.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan does not need to provoke war against mainland China and
the two sides should seek to maintain the status quo in their best
interests by putting aside sovereignty disputes, he said.
</P>
<P>
Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng also claimed in Kaohsiung
that same day that it would be a "major crisis" in Taiwan's
democratic development should the "pan blue alliance" fail to secure
its current majority in the next legislative.
</P>
<P>
Wang, who is also a vice chairman of the KMT, said that Taiwan is
now facing serious problems arising from the dangers of war, poverty,
marginalization and a twin-peak society under the leadership of
President Chen Shui-bian.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on Chen's repeated vows to write a new constitution by
2006, Wang said that it will further worsen the sharp divide in
Taiwan society, engulfing the country in a risky situation with
mainland China.

LAWMAKER CALLS FOR INVESTIGATION INTO 'SOFT COUP' ALLEGATION
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei, Nov. 20 (CNA)
(By Y.F. Low)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)
legislator demanded Saturday that prosecutors start an investigation
into the "soft coup" allegation made by President Chen Shui-bian.
</P>
<P>
Wang Sing-nan said anyone found to have engaged in such an
activity can be charged with sedition or attempted sedition according
to the Criminal Code.
</P>
<P>
Chen first claimed last week that the opposition "pan-blue
alliance" of the Kuomintang (KMT) and People First Party (PFP)
incited a "soft coup" by asking some retired generals to attempt to
persuade active service generals to fake sickness or resign after KMT
candidate Lien Chan lost the March 20 presidential election.
</P>
<P>
Following up on his allegation, Chen said Friday that a former
defense minister and Hsu Li-nung, former director of the General
Political Warfare Department under the Ministry of National Defense,
were involved in the plot.
</P>
<P>
Also Saturday, KMT Vice Chairman and Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou
agreed that prosecutors must probe the case immediately, saying that
the head of state must not be allowed to "speak with indiscretion
without having to take responsibility" for his words.
</P>
<P>
Holding a similar view, Lien said it is irresponsible of Chen to
make the allegation "based only on information gathered from the
Internet."
</P>
<P>
Huang Te-fu, the KMT's legislative caucus whip, accused Chen of
trying to mislead the people by making groundless remarks just so
that his party wins the Dec. 11 legislative elections.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, former Premier and Defense Minister Hau Pei-tsun said
Chen's allegation is "naive and ignorant" and is a humiliation for
the military.
</P>
<P>
Hau said the nationalization of the military was already
completed during the term of former President Lee Teng-hui and that
the military abides by the Constitution and obeys the command of the
president.
</P>
<P>
If the military had intended to start a coup, it would have done
so as soon as Chen was elected to his first term in 2000, according
to Hau.

or documents to certify a transfer -- can be changed to e-disbursing
so as to upgrade the e-disbursing efficiency of the national coffers.

STRONG NEW TAIWAN DOLLAR AFFECTS EXPORTS TO U.S., EUROPE: SCHOLAR
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Nov.  20 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A strong new Taiwan dollar will affect
Taiwan's exports to the United States and Europe, but its impact will
be limited on outbound shipments to mainland China, scholars said
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Lin Chu-chia, an economics professor at National Chengchi
University, said that the recent appreciation of the new Taiwan
dollar should have had some effects on the country's exports, in
particular those to the United States and Europe.
</P>
<P>
However, exporters doing business with mainland China are being
less influenced, he said. Currently, Taiwan's trade with the mainland
accounts for one-third of the country's total foreign trade, he
noted.
</P>
<P>
Since late September, the new Taiwan dollar has strengthened
against the U.S. dollar by about 4 percent, a ratio Lin described as
"reasonable." Should the local unit gain in value by more than 10
percent, its impact on the domestic export sector will have to be
reassessed, he added.
</P>
<P>
The new Taiwan dollar closed at 32.554 against the greenback
Friday in the Taipei foreign exchange market, a drop of NT$0.134 from
Thursday's finish. It had gained NT$0.57 in value for the first four
days of the week on back of an influx of international hot money
taking advantage of the weak U.S. dollar.
</P>
<P>
Despite wide speculation over a mainland China's renminbi
appreciation of between 5 percent and 10 percent early next year,
however, the professor was reserved about the likelihood of the
mainland authorities making such a move, pointing to the mainland's
relatively low per-capita income of about US$1,000.
</P>
<P>
As many mainland economists are opposed to a renminbi
appreciation at this time, he said it is hard to predict precisely
when such a move will actually be implemented.
</P>
<P>
Chen Ruey-long, vice minister of economic affairs, also said that
the impact of a rising local unit must be evaluated compared to the
gains made by other currencies, such as the Euro, the Japanese yen,
the renminbi and the South Korean won.
</P>
<P>
In essence, a more expensive local currency has both positive and
negative effects on different lines of businesses in various regions,
he explained.

MAC HEAD EXPLAINED TAIWAN'S MAINLAND POLICY IN EUROPE
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Berlin,  Nov.  20 (CNA)
(By Y.S. Lin and P.C. Tang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Republic of China's top official for
mainland affairs said that the goal of his tour of Europe was to
explain Taiwan's mainland policy to various countries to counter
Beijing's attempts to marginalize the island.
</P>
<P>
Joseph Wu, chairman of the Mainland Affairs Council (MAC), spoke
on the eve of his departure in Berlin. Wu returned to Taipei
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Pointing out that many European heads of state have side with
mainland China against Taiwan to further their business interests,
Wu said that Beijing has never relented in its campaign to belittle
Taiwan, labeling it a "troublemaker."
</P>
<P>
"This greatly harms Taiwan and my current tour in Europe has been
to explain clearly to European countries the Taiwan government's
consistent and transparent cross-Taiwan Strait policy," he said.
</P>
<P>
His tour of Europe was a sensitive matter and he was not
welcomed by all European countries. France, for instance, is still
pro-China, Wu said.
</P>
<P>
However, Germany seems to better accept Taiwan, Wu said, adding
that German think tanks have a good understanding of cross-strait
affairs, as do pro- Taiwan members in the German Parliament.
</P>
<P>
Touching on Taiwan's bid to join the World Health Organization as
an observer, Wu said that Berlin has stressed that it has to discuss
the matter with other members of the European Union and cannot take
unilateral action because the EU has a common foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
Wu said that he had personally thanked German parliamentarians
for their support. He emphasized that in a pro-Taiwan resolution,
many voiced their concerns about Taiwan's security, showing that the
military threat from China has drawn attention from the German people.
</P>
<P>
The resolution, which was raised by German ruling parties,
requested that the arms embargo against mainland China be maintained.
It also asked Beijing to resolve cross-strait disputes peacefully, to
improve its human rights record and to oppose the proliferation of
weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
The resolution, along with a similar one passed recently by the
European Parliament, shows the strong international support for
Taiwan, Wu said, adding that he hopes that these resolutions can
serve as a foundation for other European countries to discuss Taiwan
and to keep the arms embargo in place.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated that if the EU agrees to lift the export ban, it
would mean that Europe does not care about Beijing's military threat
toward Taiwan and accepts its threat of the use of force in the
Taiwan Strait. Some EU members, including France, have been
requesting that the EU lift the ban.
</P>
<P>
During his visit, Wu met with Guido Westerwelle, president of the
opposition German Free Democratic Party, scholars and
representatives from think tanks. He also gave interviews with some
leading German newspapers, including Frankfurt's Allgemeine Zeitung,
Berlin's Zeitung and Germany's Financial Times.

TAIWAN CULTURE RECEIVES INCREASING WORLD ATTENTION: OFFICIAL
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Los Angeles,  Nov.  20 (CNA)
(By Chu Lu-sheng and Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taiwan's multi-ethnic culture is
receiving ever-increasing world attention, a visiting Republic of
China official said in Los Angeles Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Wu Chin-fa, vice chairman of the Council for Cultural Affairs,
made the remarks in a speech delivered to a group of Taiwanese
expatriates residing in California.
</P>
<P>
Wu said the University of California at Santa Barbara sponsored an
international seminar on Taiwan culture recently, with the
participation of academics from the United States, Canada, Japan and
South Korea.
</P>
<P>
A total of 27 papers on Taiwan's history and culture were
discussed at the seminar, Wu said, adding that it marked the first
time that a U.S. university has ever organized a symposium
exclusively on Taiwan's cultural development.
</P>
<P>
In the past, Wu said, international seminars or studies on Taiwan
usually focused on political and economic issues.
</P>
<P>
Wu, himself a poet and essayist, said Taiwan culture's greatest
features lie in its receptivity and inclusiveness.
</P>
<P>
"Although Taiwan is a small island, it has a great ability to
assimilate foreign cultures. It has managed to integrate many alien
cultural elements into its own culture, adding to Taiwan culture's
diversity, uniqueness and vitality, " Wu said, adding that the
cultural receptivity can explain why Taiwan can far more easily
accept democratic political systems than mainland China.
</P>
<P>
Wu further said the government and people of Taiwan should let
the world understand that Taiwan is a very special place and that
values demonstrate in its arts, music and dances form the core of
Taiwan culture.
</P>
<P>
In the future, Wu said, the Council for Cultural Affairs will
endeavor to have Taiwan's literary works translated into English for
distribution to English-speaking countries and to introduce Taiwan's
diverse musical and artistic creations to the world.
</P>
<P>
In another news development, an exhibition of photos featuring
Taiwan's beautiful natural scenery and folk customs and culture
opened Saturday at the Los Angeles culture center for a four-day run.
The show is being organized by the Taipei Economic and Cultural
Office in Los Angeles.

TSOU FISH FESTIVAL BEGINS IN ALISHAN
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Chiayi, Taiwan, Nov. 21 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Tsou Fish Festival began Sunday
in Shanmei rural township of Chiayi County to mark the successful
conservation of the carp-like fish that is endemic to Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
The aboriginal Tsou people, who have traditionally made the Sun
Moon Lake and Mount Ali (Alishan) regions their home, celebrated the
opening of this year's Tsou Fish Festival at a ceremony held at
Danayi Valley in Shanmei Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The Tsou people first offered millet wine to worship the river
god of Shamichi Creek, which is upstream from Tsengwen Creek, one of
the major waterways in Taiwan, followed with other traditional Tsou
celebrations, including Tsou-style wrestling, an archery competition
and glutinous rice grinding by stone mortar.
</P>
<P>
The Tsou people began the conservation project in 1988 to protect
the endangered fish that is endemic to Taiwan's mountainous areas, in
hopes that the fish, known as Yosku Aulu in the Tsou dialect --
meaning "the genuine fish" -- will not be threatened with extinction
due to poaching.
</P>
<P>
Since then, the Tsou people have organized their own patrols to
guard the Yosku Aulu from illegal fishing.
</P>
<P>
The Danayi Valley of Shanmei rural township is home to many of
the fish.
</P>
<P>
Yosku Aulu, commonly known in Taiwanese as Kohuei, has been
coveted by both aboriginal and Han people since ancient times because
it has been regarded as a great delicacy. The Japanese colonial
settlers during the 1920s called it Oshima.
</P>
<P>
The fish, with yellowish green glittering scales and pale yellow
or white belly, is found in mountainous streams with strong currents
where the water is clear and cold.
</P>
<P>
President Chen Shui-bian attended a similar ceremony held at
Danayi Valley in April 2002.

BUSH-HU TALKS ON TAIWAN ISSUE WENT AS EXPECTED: MAC HEAD

<TEXT>
<P>
The head of the Mainland Affairs Council
(MAC) said Sunday that the talks between U.S. and mainland Chinese
leaders on Taiwan issues on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific
Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum in Santiago went as expected.
</P>
<P>
MAC Chairman Joseph Wu made the comments when he attended a
friendly baseball game between teams from his council and the
Presidential Office at the opening of the 2005 Presidential Cup
Baseball Championship, which began the same day.
</P>
<P>
According to wire services reports, mainland Chinese President Hu
Jingtao said after he met with U.S. President George W. Bush on the
summit sidelines that he appreciated Bush's commitment to the "one
China" policy, the "three communiques" and his opposition to Taiwan
independence.
</P>
<P>
Wu, who just returned from Europe where he explained the ROC
government's cross-strait policies to various European countries,
said that the Bush-Hu talks on Taiwan issues showed that Washington's
cross-strait policy is consistent, noting that aside from the "one
China" policy, there is the Taiwan Relations Act and the "three
communiques" and that the U.S. also opposes Beijing's use of force
against Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Considering that Washington's existing cross-strait policy will
remain unchanged in the foreseeable future, and that the United
States will explain the contents of the Bush-Hu talks to Taiwan
through appropriate channels, the official said that the authorities
in Taipei will then give further explanations to the public.
</P>
<P>
Wu also predicted that Washington's cross-strait policy will not
change after Condoleezza Rice assuming the post of U.S. Secretary of
State because she was already aware of the issues as national
security advisor.

COAST GUARD ADMINISTRATION STEPS UP PATROL AGAINST MAINLAND POACHERS
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Nov. 21 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Coast Guard Administration (CGA) has
begun a sweeping patrol operation in waters to the west of Taiwan to
expel mainland Chinese poachers.
</P>
<P>
The operation, dubbed "Clear Seas, " began in waters outside
Taichung, central Taiwan to the areas surrounding Penghu Islands
Friday night after local fishermen complained that a large number of
mainland fishing boats have converged in the areas in recent days to
fish illegally, CGA officials said.
</P>
<P>
Under the "Clear Seas" operation, four CGA cruiser frigates,
flanked by several patrol boats, began to patrol the Taichung-Penghu
area in the Taiwan Strait Friday night for three days.
</P>
<P>
During the patrol, most of the mainland Chinese fishing boats
fled while some stubborn ones who refused to leave the ROC economic
territory were cornered by the CGA coast guard forces, having their
catch and fishing gear confiscated before being driven away.
</P>
<P>
CGA authorities said that patrolling will continue in three-day
stints because this time of the year, the northeast trade winds bring
in big schools of fish to the Taiwan Strait, which attracts mainland
Chinese fishing boats to Taiwan waters.
</P>
<P>
CGA authorities also called for Taiwan fishing boats or anybody
who spots mainland Chinese boats conducting illegal fishing in Taiwan
waters to call 118 -- the Taiwan Fishermen's Broadcasting Station --
which will in turn notify the CGA.

RETIRED GENERALS DENY PRESIDENT'S 'SOFT COUP' ALLEGATION
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Nov. 21 (CNA)
(By Luis Huang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Former Minister of National Defense Chiang
Chung-ling on Sunday denied President Chen Shui-bian's allegations
that he cooperated with several other retired generals to stage a
"soft coup" after the March 20 presidential election.
</P>
<P>
Chiang made the denial at a news conference held at the
headquarters of the major opposition Kuomintang (KMT) after Chen said
Friday that a former defense minister who also served as a KMT deputy
chairman and Hsu Li-nung, former director of the General Political
Warfare Department under the Ministry of National Defense were
involved in the "plot."
</P>
<P>
Chiang said that the former defense minister and former KMT
deputy chairman mentioned by the president should refer to him, and
stressed that he absolutely did not persuade generals on active
service to fake sickness or resign in an attempt to launch a "soft
coup" after KMT candidate Lien Chan lost the presidential election.
</P>
<P>
"If President Chen has concrete evidence for the who, when and
where of the incident and the persons involved, he should immediately
give it to the justice authorities for investigation, and I would be
subject to legal punishment if I were found having violated the law,"
Chiang told reporters.
</P>
<P>
Chiang also voiced the hope that former Defense Minister Tang
Yiau-min and incumbent Defense Minister Lee Jye will engage in a
public cross-debate with him about the alleged "soft coup" in order
to find out the truth.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on the same occasion, Yok Mu-ming, chairman of the
opposition New Party, denied the president's accusation on behalf of
Hsu Li-nung, who is currently receiving medical treatment in mainland
China, saying that Chen's charges were aimed at defaming the
opposition camp in the lead-up to the Dec. 11 legislative elections.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Ku Chung-lien, a legislator of the opposition People
First Party (PFP) , who served as commander-in-chief of the Republic
of China Navy, also rejected the president's accusation that he was
involved in the plot, through his proxy at the press conference as he
was stumping for PFP candidates in southern Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Chen first claimed last week that the opposition "pan-blue
alliance" of the KMT and PFP incited a "soft coup" by asking some
retired generals to attempt to persuade active service generals to
fake sickness or resign after the March 20 presidential election to
cause social unrest.
</P>
<P>
Following up on his allegation, Chen said Friday that a former
defense minister and Hsu Li-nung, former director of the General
Political Warfare Department under the Ministry of National Defense,
were involved in the "plot."

U.S. BRIEFED TAIWAN ON BASIC STANCE BEFORE BUSH-HU TALKS: MOFA
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei, Nov. 21 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The U.S. government had assured Taiwan that
there would be no changes in its policy toward cross-Taiwan Strait
relations before President George W. Bush held talks with mainland
Chinese President Hu Jintao in Chile Saturday, a diplomatic official
said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"U.S. authorities had briefed us on their basic policy line ahead
of the Bush-Hu talks on the sidelines of the ongoing informal
leadership meeting of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC)
forum in Santiago the previous day, " Ministry of Foreign Affairs
(MOFA) spokesman Michel Lu said.
</P>
<P>
Lu was responding to foreign wire service reports saying that Hu
had praised Bush after their one-hour talk for his reaffirmation of
the U.S. commitment to the "one China" policy, the three
Washington-Beijing joint communiques and opposition to Taiwan
independence. The reports further said Bush didn't mention any
Taiwan-related subjects after his talks with Hu.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the reports, Lu said the reported content of the
Bush-Hu talks didn't go beyond what Taiwan had expected.
</P>
<P>
"From the pre-summit U.S. briefings, we already knew that the
U.S. policy toward cross-strait relations would not be changed, " Lu
said, adding that MOFA will continue to maintain close interactions
with the United States and make every possible effort to boost
bilateral substantive relations.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) Chairman Joseph Wu said
the latest Bush-Hu talks indicates that the U.S. government will
uphold consistency in its basic policy line toward Taiwan and
mainland China and is unlikely to waver on this stance in the
foreseeable future.
</P>
<P>
Wu, who just returned from a European tour to expound on the
nature of Taiwan's cross-strait policy, further said he didn't find
any unexpected elements in the latest Bush-Hu face-to-face talks on
the sidelines of the APEC summit in the Chilean capital.
</P>
<P>
According to foreign wire service reports, Hu said after
his meeting with Bush that he was pleased with the result of the
talks.
</P>
<P>
The two "exchanged views on the issue of Taiwan and I expressed
my high appreciation to President Bush for his position on the 'One
China' policy and his opposition to Taiwan's independence," Hu said
after the meeting.

MANUFACTURERS URGED TO GLOBALIZE OPERATIONS DUE TO WEAKER GREENBACK
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei, Nov. 20 (CNA)
(By Luis Huang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taiwanese manufacturers should speed up the
globalization of their business operations as a way to reduce the
negative impact that a weaker U.S. dollar will have on their exports,
a government official said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Vice Minister of Economic Affairs Chen Ruey-long said that the
continued appreciation of the New Taiwan dollar against the greenback
shows the importance of globalizing business operations, adding that
the Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) is not worried that this will
accelerate domestic manufacturers' "go west" policy.
</P>
<P>
Noting that it is the MOEA's duty to create a favorable
environment for Taiwanese manufacturers to globalize their business
operations, Chen said that the government will actively participate
in various trade talks within the framework of the World Trade
Organization and seek to sign with more foreign countries agreements
aimed at avoiding double taxation to facilitate domestic
manufacturers' business operation globalization.
</P>
<P>
The local currency has appreciated against the U.S. dollar by
about 3 percent over the past two weeks, an amount that Chen
described as "acceptable." Although it has an impact on export
prices, import prices for semi-finished products, raw materials and
key spare parts and components required for export product
manufacturing are also lowered at the same time, he explained.
</P>
<P>
Chen said that the Japanese yen and the South Korea won have
appreciated against the U.S. dollar more sharply over the past two
weeks while the appreciation range of the local unit against the
greenback has been relatively lower.
</P>
<P>
Although mainland China's renminbi is also facing growing
appreciation pressure, it is still pegged to the greenback, thus
leaving Taiwan in a more advantageous position than Japan and South
Korea, Chen noted, adding that domestic manufacturers with operations
on the mainland can export those items which are prone to be affected
by the foreign exchange fluctuations directly from the mainland.
</P>
<P>
However, domestic entrepreneurs are worried about losing their
competitive edge in foreign markets in the face of a continuously
appreciating N.T. dollar. Executives from several business and
industrial organizations, including the Chinese National Federation
of Industries, said that the recent appreciation range of the local
unit is higher than expected and asked the central bank to take
measures to curb any further strengthening of the New Taiwan dollar.

FORMER PRESIDENT CALLS ON VOTERS TO SUPPORT 'PAN-GREEN' CANDIDATES

<TEXT>
<P>
Former President Lee Teng-hui called on
voters Sunday to support candidates of the "pan-green camp" of the
ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) and the opposition Taiwan
Solidarity Union (TSU) in the year-end legislative elections.
</P>
<P>
"Only when the 'pan-green camp' win a majority in the Legislative
Yuan in the Dec. 11 elections, can Taiwan enjoy a stable political
situation, " Lee said, adding that the number of seats to be garnered
by the TSU will be decisive for the camp to control the legislature.
</P>
<P>
Lee, also the spiritual leader of the TSU, made the remarks while
stumping for the party's candidate Chang Chin-hu who inaugurated his
campaign headquarters in Taiping City, Taichung County.
</P>
<P>
It has been more than eight months since the March 20
presidential election, but the domestic political situation is still
unstable because the legislature is controlled by the opposition
"pan-blue alliance" of the Kuomintang and the People First Party, Lee
pointed out.
</P>
<P>
He went on to say that if the "pan-green camp" can win more than
half of the legislative seats in the Dec. 11 elections, the
government will be able to carry out various sweeping reforms.

the quality of locally produced fresh milk Sunday, saying the product
is hygienic and nutritious.
</P>
<P>
The Cabinet-level council was responding to a study by a National
Chiao Tung University (NCTU) research team that claimed that 80
percent of locally produced fresh milk, including most popular
brands, were not very nutritious because their beta-lactoglobulin
contents were almost completely lost in the process of
ultra-high-temperature (UTH) flash sterilization.
</P>
<P>
The NCTU report further said the quality of locally produced
fresh milk lagged far behind that of U.S.-originated fresh milk and
even fell below that of imported powdered milk. The beta-lactoglobulin
is the main component of proteins in fresh milk that can enhance
immunity, lower cholesterol and help vitamin digestion.
</P>
<P>
In response, Chen Hsing-hao, a COA department chief in charge of
husbandry affairs, and Chen Pao-chi, chairman of National Taiwan
University's livestock husbandry department, jointly held a news
conference to defend the quality of locally produced fresh milk.
</P>
<P>
Chen Hsing-hao said local dairy farms have consistently followed
the standard sterilization procedures widely used in the
international community in keeping their products free of bacteria.
</P>
<P>
"Flash sterilization under a temperature of 130 degrees Celsius
is not expected to seriously affect nutrients in fresh milk, " Chen
Hsing-hao said.
</P>
<P>
Chen Pao-chi echoed Chen Hsing-hao's statement, saying that
although flash, ultra-high-temperature sterilization may slightly
affect some temperature-sensitive nutrients in fresh milk, such as
beta-lactoglobulin and some kinds of vitamins, most other proteins,
calcium and nutrients in fresh milk remain intact.
</P>
<P>
Both of them insisted that the UTH sterilization method used in
Taiwan has been widely certified in the international community and
adopted by many Western countries. They further stressed that locally
produced fresh milk still contains beta-lactoglobulin and many other
proteins, including whey protein, casin and gamma-lactalbumin.
</P>
<P>
"Our fresh milk is nutritious and safe for consumers to drink, "
Chen Hsing-hao stressed.

<TEXT>
<P>
Egypt blanked Taiwan 12-0 in the
opening game of the Chinese Taipei 2004 Tournament of the FIFA Futsal
World Championships held in Taipei Sunday.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time that the FIFA Futsal championship is being
held in Taiwan, in which teams from 16 countries are taking part.
</P>
<P>
President Chen Shui-bian attended the opening ceremony of the
championship held earlier in the day at National Taiwan University
stadium.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the opening, Chen said that it is a great honor for
Taiwan to play host to the world indoor football championship. Taiwan
will gain much visibility on the world stage after hosting this
tournament, he said, adding that via this tournament, the
sport will also gain much more popularity in Taiwan as well.
</P>
<P>
Chen said he believes that the Taiwan team, also known as Chinese
Taipei, will "kick well" in the world championship and he offered his
appreciation for the Federation International of the Football
Association (FIFA) for authorizing the 16-nation tournament.
</P>
<P>
Chen also thanked the Taipei City Government and Chinese Taipei
Football Association, co-sponsors of the tournament.
</P>
<P>
Also addressing the opening, Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou said that
it is not the first time for Taipei City to host international sport
competitions, but it is the first time that Taipei City has a world
championship televised around the world via satellite.
</P>
<P>
Ma said it is hoped that by hosting the Futsal competition,
enthusiasm for soccer will be rekindled in Taiwan and local players
will be able to pick up experience and expertise from top players
from around the world.
</P>
<P>
He added that it has been a struggle for Taipei City to win the
opportunity to host the tournament due to strong competition from
rival countries.
</P>
<P>
The 2004 FIFA Futsal World Championship Chinese Taipei is one of
the activities devoted to marking the 100th anniversary of the
founding of FIFA, Ma said.
</P>
<P>
Altogether, 16 teams from six regions are scheduled to come to

COMING DECADE CRITICAL TO TAIWAN-U.S.-CHINA TIES: EX-MAC CHIEF
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Nov. 21 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The coming decade will be a crucial period
for the development of Taiwan-U.S.-China relations, former Mainland
Affairs council Chairwoman Tsai Ing-wen said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Tsai, who is a ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)
candidate for at-large legislative seat in the Dec. 11 legislative
elections, made the remarks during a campaign rally in the southern
city of Tainan.
</P>
<P>
Tsai, one of the most articulate women politicians in Taiwan,
said that with U.S. President George W. Bush winning re-election and
mainland Chinese President Hu Jintao taking full control of China,
the coming 10 years will be a crucial period for the development of
the delicate triangular Taiwan-U.S.-China relations and possible
changes in Taiwan's international status.
</P>
<P>
In her view, Tsai said, President Chen Shui-bian's re-election
has helped strengthen Taiwan identity and consolidate the "one
country on either side" of the Taiwan Strait framework.
</P>
<P>
Tsai said the government has made tremendous efforts to insist on
Taiwan's basic political stance in its interactions with mainland
China.
</P>
<P>
Tsai urged local voters to support candidates fielded by the
"pan-green" camp of the DPP and its ally -- the Taiwan Solidarity
Union -- in the upcoming legislative elections.
</P>
<P>
"By controlling a clear majority in the Legislative Yuan,
President Chen will have an even stronger mandate to safeguard our
national sovereignty," Tsai said.
</P>
<P>
Over the past four-plus years, the DPP administration has had a
hard time implementing its policy initiatives and political reform
agenda due to its failure to control a majority in the legislature,
Tsai said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Tsai said Taiwan badly needs to inject new blood into
its legislative, diplomatic, economic and social welfare systems in
order to accelerate national development and upgrade overall national
competitiveness.
</P>
<P>
"We need a new generation of lawmakers, formulate new Legislative
Yuan operational rules and establish a new mechanism for substantive
policy debates," Tsai said.
</P>
<P>
The nation also needs a new generation of diplomatic and trade
officials, Tsai said.
</P>
<P>
"In the past, most of our diplomats and foreign trade planning
personnel were civil servants. In the future, we should recruit
high-caliber young professionals to assume leading diplomatic and
trade posts to open up new frontiers for our diplomatic work and
economic development," Tsai said.
</P>
<P>
She also criticized the efficiency of existing social welfare
mechanisms, saying the current systems are unfair and must undergo
modernization reforms.

LOY KRATHONG DAY MARKED IN TAIPEI TO HONOR THAI WORKERS
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Nov.  21 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Taipei City Government organized a
series of activities Sunday to mark Loy Krathong Day, one of the most
beautiful and popular festivals in Thailand, to honor the 3,700-plus
Thai workers in the city.
</P>
<P>
Taipei City Deputy Mayor Yeh Chin-chuan said at an evening party
at the 228 Peace Park that the celebration activities are aimed at
helping Taipei citizens get a taste of the beauty of Thai culture and
let nostalgic Thai workers reminisce about their joys and cultural
life in their home country.
</P>
<P>
Yeh said the city government is grateful for the contribution of
Thai workers to major municipal infrastructure construction projects,
including the Neihu and Nankang lines of the mass rapid transit
systems.
</P>
<P>
"We hope the Loy Krathong Day celebrations will bring joys and
happiness to all Thai laborers in Taipei," Yeh said.
</P>
<P>
The celebration activities included a ball game, making of
Krathongs which mean lotus-shaped vessels made of banana leaves, and
performances of traditional Thai dances.
</P>
<P>
During the evening party, Yeh presented gifts and a trophy to the
top winner of a beauty queen contest, an important part of the Loy
Krathong festival celebrations.
</P>
<P>
Loy Krathong Day celebrates annually on the 15th day of 12th
month on the Thai calenda. It takes place at a time when the weather
is fine as the rainy season is over and there is a high water level
all over Thailand.
</P>
<P>
"Loy" means "to float" and a "Krathong" is a lotus-shaped vessel
made of banana leaves. The Krathong usually contains a candle, three
joss-sticks, some flowers and coins.
</P>
<P>
On the day, people offer thanks to the goddess of the water. By
moonlight, people light the candles and jos-sticks, make a wish and
launch Krathongs on canals, rivers or small ponds. It is believed that
the Krathongs carry away sins and bad luck, and the wishes that have
been made for the new year due to start.

<TEXT>
<P>
The Cabinet will pass a draft package of
amendments to the Referendum Law at its weekly meeting Wednesday,
Cabinet spokesman Chen Chi-mai said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Chen said that as the present Referendum Law, passed by the
opposition-controlled Legislative Yuan, contains many flaws, Premier
Yu Shyi-kun directed Minister-without-Portfolio Hsu
Chih-hsiung to come up with draft revisions to the law.
</P>
<P>
"The draft amendments are aimed at formulating a referendum law
that complies with the democratic concepts and meet Taiwan's
practical demands," Chen said.
</P>
<P>
The draft package had passed initial screening by officials from
the Judicial Yuan, the Ministry of the Interior, the Ministry of
Justice, the Central Election Commission and other relevant
agencies.
</P>
<P>
"The Cabinet is scheduled to pass the package at Wednesday's
meeting after further discussions," Chen said, adding that the
package will then be referred to the Legislative Yuan for approval.
</P>
<P>
If the "pan-green" camp of the ruling Democratic Progressive
Party and the Taiwan Solidarity Union can win a clear majority in the
Dec. 11 legislative elections, Chen said, the draft revisions to the
Referendum Law will be able to clear the legislative floor soon.

ROC REP TO U.K. DEPARTS LONDON WITH HIGH PRAISE
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
London, Nov.21 (CNA)
(By N.K. Han and Deborah Kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Outgoing Republic of China Representative to
Britain Tien Hung-mao departed London with his wife Sunday for home,
concluding a stint of two years and seven months as Taiwan's top
envoy in the United Kingdom.
</P>
<P>
Tien departed with praise from Taiwan expatriate community
members in Britain and with a high degree of recognition from
political and diplomatic circles in both the United Kingdom and
Europe.
</P>
<P>
Over 50 Taiwanese and British friends saw the Tiens off at the
the airport.
</P>
<P>
During his time in office, Tien scored several "record"
achievements in his efforts at strengthening Taiwan's friendship with
the United Kingdom and Europe and at broadening Taiwan's diplomatic
horizons.
</P>
<P>
Tien's most recent achievement was inviting 26 parliamentarians
from 20 European countries who have been friendly toward Taiwan to
establish the "Marco Polo Club" and convening the club's first
general meeting on Taiwan-related issues, including how to facilitate
Taiwan's participation in important international organizations.
</P>
<P>
Last week, members of the British-Taiwanese All-Party
Parliamentary Group bid farewell to Tien and his wife at a reception
held at the House of Commons. It marked the first time that members
of the British Parliament had held a farewell reception at the
Parliament for an ROC envoy.
</P>
<P>
Thomas Cox, one of the co-chairmen of the parliamentary group,
raised a motion in the House of Commons to request that it cite
Tien's outstanding performance in enhancing relations between the two
countries. The motion was signed by over 60 members of Parliament.
</P>
<P>
Altogether, the House of Commons raised eight motions during
Tien's tenure in London to show support for Taiwan. The motions
featured efforts ranging from supporting Taiwan's accession to the
World Health Organization and recognizing Taiwan's democratization,
to raising concerns about China's military intimidation of Taiwan and
calling for the European Union not to lift its arms embargo against
mainland China.
</P>
<P>
During his stint, Tien also signed an agreement with Jean
Lemierre, president of the London-based European Bank for
Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) , to jointly initiate two
programs to help 28 countries in Central and Eastern Europe and
Central Asia in their transition to free market economies.
</P>
<P>
Under the Replenishment Agreement, Taiwan pledges to donate an
extra US$1 million to the EBRD's technical cooperation programs.
Taiwan is the largest non-member donor to the EBRD's technical
cooperation funds.
</P>
<P>
The second agreement commits Taiwan to contribute 1 million euros
(US$1.29 million) to a Mongolia Cooperation Fund that will be used
solely to help Mongolia develop private enterprises.
</P>
<P>
After signing the agreements, Taiwan, officially known as "Taipei
China" to the bank, then formed a supervisory board with three other
donors -- Japan, the Netherlands and Luxembourg. The board will meet
twice a year to review past performance and determine new project
priorities.
</P>
<P>
Tien is going to be succeeded by Lin Chun-yi, currently ROC
ambassador to Gambia.

Strong northeast trade winds have brought
another flock of black-faced spoonbills from the northern Korean
Peninsula to the Chiku wetlands in southern Taiwan to overwinter,
local wild bird fans said Monday.
</P>
<P>
As of Monday, 682 of the endangered wading birds had arrived at
the wetlands located at the estuary of the Tsengwen River in Tainan
County, said a spokesman for the Happy Family, which groups wild bird
fans to promote wildlife conservation.
</P>
<P>
"The number is already close to the record set Dec. 3, 2003, when
705 black-faced spoonbills were counted wintering at the Chiku
sanctuary, " the spokesman said, adding that more of the rare bird
species are expected to arrive in the coming weeks as the weather
gets colder.
</P>
<P>
According to a global survey conducted in January of this year,
only 1,206 black-faced spoonbills remain in the world.
</P>
<P>
The wading birds usually begin arriving in Taiwan to spend the
winter after the Mid-Autumn Festival. They then start heading back
north to their breeding grounds between March and April the following
year.

DPP WHIP WANTS 'HAPPIER' NATIONAL ANTHEM
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei, Nov. 22 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The party whip of the legislative caucus of
the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) said Monday that he
would like to see a "happier and lighter" Republic of China national
anthem.
</P>
<P>
Lee Chun-yi said that the current national anthem -- which was in
fact also the party anthem of the opposition Kuomintang (KMT) -- was
composed nearly 80 years ago, and that it is "heavy" both in terms of
tune and lyrics.
</P>
<P>
Even James Soong, former KMT secretary-general and current
chairman of the KMT-allied opposition People First Party, has on at
least one occasion criticized the national anthem as confusing,
saying that the first and second lines mix the nation and the KMT,
according to Lee.
</P>
<P>
The anthem first declares the "Three Principles of the People" to
be the foundation of the party and the nation, and then calls upon
the party members to be brave, earnest and unrelenting in striving to
fulfill the nation's goals.
</P>
<P>
Since there is no law yet to regulate the national anthem at the
moment, Lee said he would be very pleased to see all the parties from
across Taiwan's political spectrum come together to consult one
another on whether and how to revise the national anthem to make it
more cheerful and light-hearted.
</P>
<P>
The words of the ROC national anthem were first delivered as an
exhortation at the opening of the Whampoa Military Academy on June
16, 1924, by Dr. Sun Yat-sen. This exhortation was designated as the
KMT's party song in 1928, after which the KMT then solicited
contributions from the public for a tune to fit the words. The melody
submitted by Cheng Mao-yun was chosen from among 139 contenders.
</P>
<P>
The tune, with the Whampoa exhortation, was temporarily adopted
as the ROC national anthem in the late 1920s before being officially
announced as the national anthem in 1937. The piece was honored as
the world's best national anthem at the 1936 Berlin Olympics.

KMT LOGO SHOULD CHANGE, NOT SYMBOL OF THE ROC: CABINET SPOKESMAN

The government has no plans to change the
nation's official national emblem, Executive Yuan spokesman Chen
Chi-mai said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Chen Chi-mai confirmed, however, that the Executive Yuan will
soon start working to have the National Emblem Law revised in
response to President Chen Shui-bian's recent remarks that the party
emblem of the opposition Kuomintang (KMT) is "too close" to the
national emblem on the ROC national flag and that he would like to
have the KMT change its party emblem to avoid confusion.
</P>
<P>
Clarifying President Chen's position, Chen Chi-mai stressed that
the government is not going to change the national emblem. Instead,
the government will see to it that the National Emblem Law is amended
in three months to pave the way for the government to legally require
the KMT to change its party emblem.
</P>
<P>
Chen Chi-mai added that the revised National Emblem Law will be
much clearer than the existing one and will have exact punishments
set out for violators.
</P>
<P>
According to regulations of the National Emblem Law, the ROC
national flag belongs to the government of the Republic of China and
it should not be used "commercially" by any other groups, Chen
Chi-mai said.
</P>
<P>
He also pointed to the Trademark Law as stipulating that the
national flag, national emblem or any pattern that is closely similar
to the two cannot be used as logos or trademarks of any organization.
Based on this, he said, the KMT has been using its logo illegally.
</P>
<P>
Chen Chi-mai said the Executive Yuan is soliciting opinions and
suggestions from the public to facilitate the amendment to the
National Emblem Law.

GOVERNMENT RETORTS KMT HEAD'S CALL FOR REFERENDUM ON INDEPENDENCE
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Nov. 22 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taiwan is already a sovereign, independent
country so there is no need to hold a referendum on independence,
only on the question unification with China, a spokesman for the
Executive Yuan said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Chen Chi-mai was responding to a call by opposition Kuomintang
(KMT) Chairman Lien Chan in a KMT Central Standing Committee meeting
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Lien said the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) has
repeatedly advocated "one country on each side of the Taiwan Strait,
an independent Taiwan and the establishment of a nation" to try to
fool the people of Taiwan and he tried to call the DPP's bluff by
daring President Chen Shui-bian to propose a referendum on Taiwan
independence, which could be held alongside the Dec. 11 legislative
elections.
</P>
<P>
President Chen responded during a stumping trip for DPP
legislative candidates that night by saying that he would not fall
for Lien's ploy, adding that everyone knows that he sticks to his
"five noes" pledge -- which includes no referendum on independence or
unification.
</P>
<P>
Spokesman Chen noted that President Chen has stressed on several
occasions that Taiwan is already a sovereign, independent country and
its name is the Republic of China. Unless the nation or its status
quo is threatened by foreign countries or its sovereignty is at risk
of being changed, then the president will invoke Article 17 of the
Referendum Law concerning a "defensive referendum."
</P>
<P>
Chen also reminded Lien that according to the Referendum Law that
cleared the opposition-dominated legislature last November, there is
no possibility of holding a referendum on Taiwan independence.
</P>
<P>
He said that Article two of the Referendum Law stipulates that
issues concerning changing the name and geographic boundaries of the
nation involve constitutional revisions and cannot be included in a
referendum.
</P>
<P>
"Lien doesn't even understand the law he helped clear the
legislature, " Spokesman Chen said, adding that he "felt sorry for
him."
</P>
<P>
Another DPP official also criticized Lien for being too reckless
as a party chief.
</P>
<P>
Cheng Wen-tsang, director of the DPP's Department of Culture and
Information, said that according to the Referendum Law, the formation
of a referendum topic must take at least 102 days, and that Lien's
proposal that a referendum be held simultaneously with the
legislative elections next month is simply to take national security
as "horseplay."
</P>
<P>
Cheng noted that the DPP passed a resolution on Taiwan's future
in 1999, which clearly stated that Taiwan is a sovereign, independent
county, and that its name is the Republic of China according to the
Constitution, and any changes to the status quo must have the consent
of the 23 million people on Taiwan.

Wall Street Journal: A brutal killing opens Dutch eyes to threat

On Friday a group of left-wing aldermen from Amsterdam's heavily
Muslim western districts met to discuss an issue previously left to
the police: how to root out Islamic terrorists in their
neighborhoods. The socialist aldermen's resolve follows the murder
early this month of Dutch filmmaker Theo van Gogh, who was shot,
stabbed and slashed across the throat by a suspected Islamic radical.
The killing set off a wave of attacks on mosques. It also triggered a
surprising shift in a country where, like elsewhere across much of
Western Europe, America's "war on terror" has often been derided as
too crude and too brutal.

KMT SHOULD RETURN NATIONAL SYMBOL TO THE NATION: DPP
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei, Nov. 22 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)
official charged the opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Monday with being
purposefully ambiguous with the KMT party logo and the national
symbol of the Republic of China.
</P>
<P>
Cheng Wen-tsang, top DPP official in charge of publicity, urged
the KMT to return the national symbol to the nation and change the
opposition party's logo to avoid confusion.
</P>
<P>
Cheng repeated President Chen Shui-bian's recent remarks that the
KMT party logo is "too close" to the national emblem on the ROC
national flag and that he would like to have the KMT change its party
logo to allow the country to have a clear symbol.
</P>
<P>
He quoted Chen as urging the KMT Sunday evening to change its
party emblem within three months. Otherwise, he said, the government
will move to have the National Emblem Law revised to make it illegal
for any political party, private organization or business group to
use the national symbol commercially. The revision will say that the
symbol is national property and only the government has the legal
right to its use.
</P>
<P>
He added that President Chen will never seek to change the ROC's
national symbol nor its flag since the president stands behind his
May 20, 2000 inaugural speech where he said that so long as mainland
China has no intention of using force against Taiwan, his
administration will uphold the "five noes" policy.
</P>
<P>
The "five noes" refers to no declaration of Taiwan independence,
no changes to the ROC's national title, no inclusion of the
controversial "special state-to-state relationship" concept into the
ROC's Constitution, no referendum on the issue of independence or
unification, and no abolition of the ROC's existing National
Unification Guidelines and National Unification Council.
</P>
<P>
Some other officials from the DPP headquarters commented Monday
that the KMT is now caught in a dilemma, which, they claimed, is a
result of a longstanding problem with differentiating between the KMT
and the nation.
</P>
<P>
In response to President Chen's demand that the KMT change its
party logo in three months, KMT spokesman Chang Jung-kung said Monday
that the president does not need to wait three months, because "we
are not changing anything."
</P>
<P>
Chang said that the KMT party emblem is a form of property with
history and is protected by the Constitution. "Only by showing
respects to history, the law and the opposition can the Republic of
China prove itself to be a nation of law and order," Chang argued.
</P>
<P>
Chang called for President Chen not to use the state apparatus to
suppress the opposition and stop using destructive rhetoric during
the current election campaign.
</P>
<P>
KMT Chairman Lien Chan dismissed the president's demand as
"narrow-minded" and not worth responding to.
</P>
<P>
Legislative caucus members of the opposition People First Party
called on President Chen to stop trying to put blinkers on the nation
with such ideological nonsense.
</P>
<P>
Having failed to build Taiwan into a better nation over the past
four years, Chen has no other option to drum up support for the DPP
legislative candidates but to play both ends against the middle to
deepen the rift between the ruling and opposition parties, including
the accusation of a "soft coup," they added.

PRESIDENT CHEN DECORATES HAVEL FOR CONTRIBUTIONS TO BILATERAL TIES
</HEADLINE>

Taipei, Nov. 22 (CNA)

<TEXT>
<P>
President Chen Shui-bian decorated visiting
former Czech Republic President Vaclav Havel with the Order of
Brilliant Star with Special Grand Cordon Monday in recognition of his
contributions to the promotion of relations between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
Praising Havel as a world-class literary figure, thinker and
political leader as well as an important dissident, Chen said he was
honored to meet Havel in person.
</P>
<P>
As Havel accidentally slipped in his hotel room in Taipei and broke
his leg two days ago, he sat in a wheelchair during the decoration
ceremony. Chen apologized for the accident and asked Havel to take
care.
</P>
<P>
Chen expressed his admiration for Havel's versatile career
achievements. Havel played a pivotal role in his country's "velvet
revolution" of 1989. He used his literary and theatrical creations to
kindle and keep the flame of democracy burning amidst a storm of
repression and autocracy during communist rule. He eventually led his
country to break the shackles of communist suppression and move
toward democracy. During his 12-year presidency, he continued working
hard to consolidate the Czech Republic's democratic system as well as
promote human rights and social justice, earning wide respect and
admiration from his fellow countrymen.
</P>
<P>
Chen also thanked Havel for his efforts at promoting high-level
exchanges between the two countries. During Havel's presidency, his
wife visited Taiwan. The wife of the then-Czech Republic prime
minister, who is now the country's president, also has been to
Taiwan. Meanwhile, former ROC President Lee Teng-hui, former Vice
President Lien Chan and incumbent first lady Wu Shu-jen all have
visited Prague.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Chen said, the 23 million Taiwan people were grateful
for Havel's explicit support for Taiwan's participation in the United
Nations while addressing a ceremony marking the U.N.'s 50th founding
anniversary in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Chen said he himself almost succeeded in making a visit to the
Czech Republic in 2002. Even though he eventually failed, Chen said
he still appreciated Havel's and the Czech Republic government's
support for Taiwan's cause.
</P>
<P>
Personally, Chen said he admires many of Havel's convictions and
concepts, particularly those regarding human rights, such as that
human rights take precedence over national sovereignty and nations
are formed by people whom Havel said were created by god.
</P>
<P>
Havel, accompanied by his wife, doctors and close aides, arrived
in Taipei Friday for his first-ever visit to Taiwan at the invitation
of President Chen Shui-bian and the Taiwan Foundation for Democracy
(TFD).
</P>
<P>
In consideration of his health, TFD officials said Havel's
itinerary is not a busy one so that he can have enough time to rest.
Smoking resulted in Havel having to have a lung removed.
</P>
<P>
Havel was originally scheduled to visited the National Palace
Museum and an aboriginal culture museum Sunday, but the visits were
canceled due to his leg problems.

PRESIDENT'S APEC SUMMIT ATTENDANCE HINGES ON CROSS-STRAIT TIES: ENVOY

<TEXT>
<P>
President Chen Shui-bian's attendance at
the annual informal leadership meeting of the Asia-Pacific Economic
Cooperation (APEC) forum will hinge on relations across the Taiwan
Strait, Taiwan's foremost scholar said in Santiago Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Academia Sinica President Lee Yuan-tseh, a co-winner of the 1986
Nobel Prize in chemistry, who arrived in the Chilean capital Thursday
to attend the 2004 APEC summit on behalf of Chen, made the remarks at
a news conference held at the end of the two-day meeting.
</P>
<P>
Because of Beijing's opposition, Taiwan's top leader has been
barred from attending the annual APEC summit in person and has to
name a proxy to attend instead. This is the third consecutive year
that Lee has attended the event on Chen's behalf.
</P>
<P>
If cross-strait relations were to improve, Lee said, it would be
possible for Chen to attend the annual APEC summit in person. "I
still look forward to seeing that scenario happen, " Lee said, adding
that if cross-strait ties remain deadlocked, the possibility of Chen
attending the APEC event would remain slim.
</P>
<P>
Lee said he had brief talks with mainland Chinese President Hu
Jintao earlier in the day. He described the atmosphere of their talks
as amicable, but added that their talks did not touch on cross-strait
issues.
</P>
<P>
"As we had only limited time, we couldn't address any complicated
topic. Moreover, cross-strait ties are not an APEC theme, " Lee said,
adding that their talks focused on issues related to energy resources
and economic development.
</P>
<P>
Lee said that although he did not convey a goodwill message from
Chen to Hu during their face-to-face talks, he passed Chen's message
on to the mainland leader indirectly during a news conference held
upon his arrival in Santiago. On that occasion, Lee said if he had an
opportunity to talk with Hu during the APEC summit, he would convey
Chen's goodwill and invite the top mainland cross-strait negotiator,
Wang Daohan, to visit Taiwan on the basis of the 1992 cross-strait
meetings in Hong Kong and a 1993 meeting in Singapore.
</P>
<P>
A mainland official issued a statement after the Lee-Hu
talks, confirming that Hu had a brief meeting with Lee.
</P>
<P>
"What happened was that at the APEC meeting, Lee Yuan-tseh, the
representative from Taiwan, came to President Hu and they did have a
brief conversation, " mainland Foreign Ministry spokesman Kong Quan
told journalists.
</P>
<P>
"The core element of their conversation was that Hu emphasized
that the one China principle must be adhered to. So if Lee Yuan-tseh
called the meeting cordial, it must be because they discussed the one
China principle," Kong claimed.
</P>
<P>
During Lee's news conference, Lee also said he met with U.S.
President George W. Bush on several occasions on the last day of the
summit.
</P>
<P>
Bush was very friendly, Lee said, adding that the American
president clearly said he hopes to see peaceful development on both
sides of the Taiwan Strait and would not like to see any cross-strait
conflict.
</P>
<P>
Lee said he is convinced that both sides of the Taiwan
Strait are oblidged to work together for cross-strait peace and
stability. "Both sides should defuse misunderstanding and forge
constructive peaceful interactions in order to contribute to world
peace and prosperity," he added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Lee said he also had conversations with Japanese Prime
Minister Junichiro Koizumi, during which Koizumi said Japan has
agreed to grant visa-free privileges to visitors from Taiwan. Koizumi
was also quoted as having told Lee that Taiwan and Japan should boost
cultural and technological exchanges.
</P>
<P>
Although the curtain has already fallen on the APEC summit, Lee's
work has not yet concluded. He has been invited to deliver a speech
on the challenges of the 21st Century at the National Science Academy
of Chile Monday. After the speech, Lee will depart for home via San
Francisco.

ALLIANCE CALLS FOR NEW LAW TARGETING SEXUAL HARASSMENT PREVENTION
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei, Nov. 22 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An alliance said on Monday that it wants a
new law targeting sexual harassment prevention, but the Ministry of
the Interior (MOI) said that it would create confusion and would
overlap current regulations and stretch existing resources.
</P>
<P>
The alliance is backing the revision of two bills, one on
domestic violence, and another on violent serial criminals. A third
bill advocated by the alliance is one regarding sexual harassment,
which has yet to be passed into law.
</P>
<P>
The alliance said more work has to be done to revise or pass
legislation to protect people from sex crimes, including sexual
harassment.
</P>
<P>
The alliance is comprised of 11 civic groups, including the
Taiwan Association for the Treatment of Domestic Violence and Sexual
Offence, the Garden of Hope Foundation and the Modern Women's
Foundation.
</P>
<P>
The alliance also unveiled the results of an online survey to
show that most victims of sexual harassment tend to be passive or
accept the unpleasant feelings of sexual harassment, and that fewer
people are actively seeking assistance.
</P>
<P>
Chi Huei-jung, executive director of the Garden of Hope
Foundation, said that 30.03 percent of respondents to the survey said
that they would complain to their relatives or colleagues after being
sexually harassed, while 24.9 percent would swear at the
perpetrators, with about 24 percent saying that they would just
ignore the action or "swallow their pride" and do nothing.
</P>
<P>
Answering for situations that occurred over the past two years,
51 percent received unwanted pornographic e-mails and 45 percent were
verbally harassed.
</P>
<P>
Kao Huei-hsien, a judge and member of the alliance, said that the
draft sexual harassment prevention bill has obtained support from
half of the members of a legislative committee and discussions have
been completed.
</P>
<P>
But Kao noted that the MOI has said that it lacks the manpower
and money and is opposed to the idea of the central and local
governments setting up sexual harassment prevention operations and
that the MOI is also opposed to a mediation system, and has said that
a separate law would overlap with bills concerning equal gender
working rights and equal education rights.
</P>
<P>
But Kao pointed out that the victims of sexual harassment often
do not want to fight with their perpetrators in court, and a
mediation system could be an alternative.
</P>
<P>
Kao also said the alliance advocates that all agencies shoulder
the responsibility for compensation, saying that the legislation aims
to prod the agencies to do their share to prevent and discipline the
perpetrators so that the victims will not have to fight alone.

CZECH OFFICIAL PRAISES TAIWAN'S COURAGE TO 'WALK ITS OWN ROAD'
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Nov.  22 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Former Czech Republic President Vaclav
Havel praised Taiwan's courage in "walking its own road" Monday in
the first public speech delivered since his arrival in Taipei Friday
for a six-day visit.
</P>
<P>
Havel, a poet and playwright-turned-politician, focused his
speech at the National Library on the theme of globalization and
democracy.
</P>
<P>
He told his audience that when he launched a pro-democracy
campaign during his country's communist era, he never thought he
would one day become president.
</P>
<P>
"I and my like-minded friends were not even sure whether we could
succeed in overthrowing communist rule. We just listened to our
consciences and said what we should say. With our efforts and
international assistance, we finally made it. Our 'velvet revolution'
of 1989 became part of the turbulent international changes of that
time and I became the president of my country. This was a 'gift of
destiny,'" Havel said.
</P>
<P>
In his speech, Havel said the fall of the Soviet Union spelled an
end to the bi-polar world political landscape. Nowadays, he said, the
world has yet to develop a new world order.
</P>
<P>
During his 12-year presidency until February 2003, Havel said he
visited 50 countries around the world.
</P>
<P>
"During overseas trips, when I woke up in the morning, I often
did not know where I was because the decor of hotels around the world
was almost the same. But this was just superficial. Beneath the
surface, enormous differences exist in cultures, histories,
traditions, languages and customs and lifestyles in different
countries and areas around the world," Havel said.
</P>
<P>
In his view, Havel said, people from different civilizations
should respect one another.
</P>
<P>
"World civilization requires all countries around the world to
mutually respect their own traditions and lifestyles. All countries
should get along peacefully on the basis of democracy and human
rights," Havel said.
</P>
<P>
He further said Taiwan has set a good example in its national
development. "Brave Taiwan people have been firm in taking their own
road and upholding their own concepts and values," he added.
</P>
<P>
Asked whether Taiwan should change its military conscription
system, Havel said the Czech Republic phased out its mandatory
military service system just a year ago. In addition to establishing
a democratic society, Havel said, a country must also have the
ability to safeguard its security, freedom and human rights.
</P>
<P>
President Chen Shui-bian decorated Havel with the Order of
Brilliant Star with Special Grand Cordon earlier in the day in
recognition of his contributions to the promotion of relations
between Taiwan and the Czech Republic.

<P>
Philippine President Gloria
Macapagal-Arroyo expressed appreciation to Taiwan during the Asia
Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum in Santiago, Chile, for
treating the 90,000 Filipino laborers in Taiwan well, a Philippine
presidential spokesman said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Igamacio Bunye said that before the summit began, there were
various bilateral meetings between the APEC members in which
Macapagal-Arroyo met with Lee Yuan-tseh, president of Academia Sinica
and the leader of the Republic of China delegation, for a 15-minute
closed-door meeting.
</P>
<P>
The two did not touch on political issues and did not violate the
Philippines' "one China" policy that recognizes Beijing as the sole
ruler of China, Bunye said.
</P>
<P>
He said that Macapagal-Arroyo took the opportunity to thank
Taiwan for taking care of the Filipino workers there, while Lee
solicited Manila to support Taiwan's proposal to set up a
communicable disease prevention center.
</P>
<P>
They also discussed the establishment of an APEC Digital
Opportunities Center, in the hope that all APEC members "will become
a digital village like Taiwan," Bunye added.

Taiwan's jobless rate dropped to 4.31
percent in October, the lowest since May 2001, when the unemployment
rate was 4.22 percent, the Directorate General of Budget, Accounting
and Statistics (DGBAS) said Monday.
</P>
<P>
The October jobless rate was lower than Hong Kong's 6.7 percent

government's goal of bringing this year's average unemployment rate
down to 4.5 percent can be realized smoothly.
</P>
<P>
Compared with September, the October jobless rate fell 0.19
percent and also marked a 0.61 percent decline from the year-earlier
level.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the jobless rate among those who have received
tertiary education dropped to 4.24 percent in October, down 0.14
percent and 0.18 percent from September and the year-earlier level,
respectively.
</P>
<P>

EMBLEMS OF POLICE, FIREFIGHTERS SHOULD BE `CORRECTED': OFFICIAL

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
One day after President Chen Shui-bian
pointed out the similarity between the opposition Kuomintang's
(KMT's) emblem and the national emblem, Vice Minister of the Interior
Lee Chin-yung said Monday that the police and firefighters who
"falsely" incorporated the KMT emblem into their emblems should make
"corrections."
</P>
<P>
Lee said the emblems of police and firefighters have incorporated
the national emblem, which has a bigger blue rim but is otherwise
similar in figure to the KMT emblem.
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, Lee said, the contractors who provided the
uniforms to the police and firefighters "mistook" the KMT emblem for
the national emblem and used it in the uniforms.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of the Interior has urged the National Police
Administration and the National Fire Administration to "correct this
mistake," Lee said.
</P>
<P>
Chen raised the issue the previous day while stumping for
legislative candidates of his Democratic Progressive Party. He
accused the KMT of patterning the national emblem on its party emblem
in the belief that the party would control the country forever.
</P>
<P>
Chen threatened to change the national emblem after the
legislative election unless the KMT drops its emblem by itself.
</P>
<P>
A similar issue applies to the Ministry of National Defense,
which also uses the national emblem as the military emblem.
</P>
<P>
An anonymous defense officer said, however, that the military
will change its emblem as long as the national emblem is changed,
which falls under the authority of the MOI.

VANUATU PRIME MINISTER REAFFIRMS RELATIONS WITH TAIWAN

<P>
Vanuatu Prime Minister Serge Vohor issued a
statement Monday to reaffirm that the diplomatic relations
established between the South Pacific island state and the Republic
of China earlier this month remain intact, according to a report from
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA).
</P>
<P>
Vohor said in the statement that the Union of Moderate Parties
(UMP) he leads won a Nov. 9 provincial election, showing that most of
the Vanuatu people support the establishment of diplomatic relations
with Taiwan in the interest of enhancing their own welfare and the
long-term economic development of the nation.
</P>
<P>
Vohor also called attention to the fact that there is no law in
Vanuatu that says the establishment of diplomatic relations must
receive the consent of the Cabinet.
</P>
<P>
MOFA officials said Vohor will take the opportunity of a special
session of Vanuatu's parliament to urge political leaders to work for
the rapid and sustainable development of the nation's economy. To
reach that goal, Vanuatu must fully carry out the establishment of
diplomatic relations with the ROC, the statement says.
</P>
<P>
MOFA spokesman Michel Lu said the Vanuatu parliament opened that
day but did not discuss Vanuatu's ties with Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
He said that Vohor's UMP controls 36 of the 52 seats in the
parliament and that the prime minister is confident that the
establishment of diplomatic ties will be passed by the parliament.
</P>
<P>
Vohor and ROC Foreign Affairs Minister Tan Sun Chen signed a
joint communique to establish diplomatic relations Nov. 3, making the
South Pacific island state the 27th ally of the ROC, despite reports
that mainland China has continued to try to woo the country away from
Taiwan.

MATSU AIRPORT TO BE INCLUDED IN CROSS-STRAIT DIRECT LINKS: PREMIER
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Premier Yu Shyi-kun said Monday that after
the completion of a new terminal building at Peikan Airport on the
island of Matsu, it will be included in direct transportation links
with mainland China.
</P>
<P>
Yu made the remarks when he inspected the construction of the new
terminal building on the outlying island.
</P>
<P>
He said that once the airport is included in the direct shipping
links with the mainland, it will help the diversification of the
island's development.
</P>
<P>
Currently, only one harbor on Kinmen and Fuao Harbor in Matsu are
used as direct shipping points with the mainland's Fujian Province.
</P>
<P>
The premier noted that the government has already provided
subsidies of nearly NT$3 billion (US$92.3 million) for the Nankan
airport, which was inaugurated in January 2003, while the
construction at Peikan airport further shows that the government
attaches great importance to Matsu's development.
</P>
<P>
President Chen Shui-bian garnered more than 200 ballots on Matsu
in this year's presidential election, or almost three times the
number he got in the previous election in 2000, although the premier
said the government's attention to local development is not weighed
by ballots.
</P>
<P>
The premier said that due to the efforts and cooperation of the
Civil Aeronautics Administration and Matsu county government, the new
terminal will be completed by the end of the year as scheduled and is
scheduled to be inaugurated at the Chinese New Year.
</P>
<P>
It is expected to greatly benefit Matsu's outbound traffic and
tourism, the premier added.

<P>
Universities have to shift their focus from
teaching to research and step up exchanges with foreign universities
if they want to upgrade their ranks to the top level in the world,
National Cheng Kung University President Kao Chiang said in Tainan
City Monday.
</P>
<P>
Presiding over the opening of a two-day forum of university heads
in Taiwan and the mainland China, Kao said the function of
universities has tipped from teaching toward research, witnessed by
the emergence of many research-oriented universities around the
world.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan, he said, is moving in this direction, with the Ministry
of Education setting aside NT$50 billion (US$1.53 billion) over five
years to merge several research-oriented universities into one in the
hope that can become one of the world's top universities, Kao said.
</P>
<P>
A top-level university should also be able to commercialize the
results of its research and attract foreign students, which is vital
for a good university.
</P>
<P>
The publication of articles about new discoveries, new knowledge
and new technology in well-known periodicals, and the winning of
international prizes such as the Nobel Prize are also vital
indications of a top level university, Kao said.
</P>
<P>
The forum has attracted 48 university chiefs from Taiwan and the
mainland.

CROSS-STRAIT TIES NOT RAISED IN TALKS WITH HU: ROC ENVOY

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Academia Sinica President Lee Yuan-tseh
reiterated in Santiago, Chile Monday that his talks with mainland
Chinese President Hu Jintao a day earlier did not touch on
cross-Taiwan Strait issues.
</P>
<P>
Lee, who attended the just-concluded informal leadership meeting
of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum on behalf of
ROC President Chen Shui-bian, was responding to a mainland official's
remarks that Hu had mentioned Beijing's cherished "one China"
principle in his brief talks with Lee on the sidelines of the APEC
summit.
</P>
<P>
Lee stressed that he didn't bring up any issues regarding
cross-strait relations in his short meeting with Hu because
Taiwan-mainland China ties were not one of the APEC themes.
</P>
<P>
"My conversation with Hu mainly focused on the APEC's core
agenda, including energy supply and regional economic development, "
Lee said.
</P>
<P>
This was the third consecutive year that Lee represented
President Chen at the annual APEC summit. Lee recalled that when he
encountered former mainland Chinese President Jiang Zemin on the
sidelines of the APEC summit three years ago, Jiang immediately
talked about Beijing's "one China" principle as a prerequisite for
resumption of cross-strait dialogue.
</P>
<P>
"It was not unexpected that Beijing would seize every opportunity
to mention the 'one China' principle, " Lee said, adding that "the
mainland official's statement came as no surprise to me."
</P>
<P>
Beijing's "one China" principle downgrades Taiwan to a province
under the its jurisdiction -- a stance unacceptable to the Republic
of China on Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Because of Beijing's opposition, Taiwan's head of state has been
barred from attending the annual APEC summit in person and has had to
name a proxy to attend instead.
</P>
<P>
APEC groups 21 Asia-Pacific economies -- Australia, Brunei,
Canada, Chile, China, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Japan, South Korea,
Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea, Peru, the
Philippines, Russia, Singapore, Taiwan, Thailand, the United States
and Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
Lee, a co-winner of the 1986 Nobel Prize in chemistry, delivered
a speech on "The Challenges of the 21st Century" at the National
Science Academy of Chile Monday.
</P>
<P>
In his speech, Lee said excessive consumption of fossil fuels has
resulted in serious damage to the natural environment. In the new
century, Lee said, humankind should develop new approaches that can
ensure the co-existence of Mother Nature and sustainable economic
development.
</P>
<P>
On globalization, Lee said differences among different cultures
and nations should be respected in the process of globalization. "We
should educate a new generation of responsible Global Village
citizens," he added.
</P>
<P>
Dealing with the continued growth in the global population and
the widening gap between developed and underdeveloped countries are
also major challenges for the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
Lee is scheduled to depart Chile for home via San Francisco
Monday evening.

MOFA DISMISSES REPORT ABOUT MISAPPROPRIATION OF ROC AID TO PALAU
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) on
Tuesday dismissed a media report claiming that the Republic of
China's aid to the West Pacific island nation of Palau has been
misappropriated.
</P>
<P>
Lee Chuan-tung, deputy director of the MOFA's East Asian and
Pacific Affairs Department, said the report by a local weekly was
groundless and incorrect.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, Taiwan companies were barred from
bidding for Taiwan-financed infrastructure construction projects in
Palau, and the quality of those construction projects were worrisome.
</P>
<P>
Lee said tenders for all Taiwan-donated infrastructure
construction projects in Palau have been carried out with the consent
of the Palauan government and in compliance with the country's legal
procedures.
</P>
<P>
"The report about excluding prospective Taiwan contractors'
participation in bidding and the poor quality of the construction
projects was not true," Lee stressed.

MOFA CONFIRMS FORMER MINISTER'S INSTRUCTIONS ON NATIONAL EMBLEM ISSUE
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Nov.  23 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA)
confirmed Tuesday that the ministry did instruct its overseas
missions four years ago about the principle to be used in displaying
the national emblem.
</P>
<P>
MOFA spokesman Michel Lu said that according to the principle,
the Republic of China flag and emblem are to be used in countries
with which the ROC maintains diplomatic relations, while pragmatism
is to be pursued in countries with which the ROC does not maintain
formal ties. He said the principle is based on pragmatic needs and to
avoid any unnecessary confusion.
</P>
<P>
Lu made the remarks amid media reports that former Foreign
Affairs Minister Tien Hung-mao sent a message in November 2000 to
overseas missions instructing them to drop the use of the national
emblem as the official logo and to replace it with the ROC flag on
official invitations, menus, name cards, seating cards, and letter
paper in countries with which the ROC maintains formal diplomatic
ties, and to use the plum blossom -- the national flower of the ROC
-- in other countries.
</P>
<P>
Lu confirmed that the MOFA did send such a message.
</P>
<P>
Lo Chih-cheng, former director of the MOFA's Research and
Planning Board, said at the time that the change in policy was made
mainly because the national emblem is too similar to the opposition
Kuomintang's emblem and could create unnecessary misunderstanding.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a military spokesman noted that the emblem on the
uniforms of servicemen is the national emblem, adding that the
question of whether this should be changed is for the Ministry of the
Interior to decide.
</P>
<P>
Maj. Gen. Huang Suey-sheng, spokesman of the Ministry of National
Defense (MND) , said that the use of the national emblem on military
uniforms is in accordance with the National Emblem Law. He said he
would not comment on the current debate over the national emblem,
saying that it is not an issue for the MND to decide.
</P>
<P>
Debate on the national emblem issue has intensified following
President Chen Shui-bian's comments Sunday while stumping for
Democratic Progressive Party candidates in the Dec. 11 elections.
Chen pointed to the similarity between the national emblem and the
KMT emblem and demanded that the party change its emblem within three
months, or else he'll push for a revision to the National Emblem Law
after the elections.

The pro-independence Union of Taiwanese
Teachers (UTT) released a "2005 calendar for the Taiwanese" Tuesday
that marks dates that are considered significant to Taiwan's history
and omits a number of traditional national holidays.
</P>
<P>
The calendar features 13 works of art by local painter Chen

UTT.
</P>
<P>
UTT President Huang Jui-chiang said the calendar has done away
with national holidays that have no relevance to Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
These include Youth Day, the Republic of China's National Day,
the birth and death anniversaries of ROC founding father Sun Yat-sen
and late President Chiang Kai-shek, Huang said.
</P>
<P>
Instead, the calendar highlights dates such as those
commemorating Taiwanese men of letters such as Lai Ho and Yang Kuei,
the 228 Peace Memorial Day and the death anniversary of Chen Nan-zon,
a martyr for freedom of speech in Taiwan, Huang added.

UNCERTAIN IF E.U. WILL LIFT CHINA ARMS EMBARGO: ROC DIPLOMAT

<P>
It is still too soon to tell if the
European Union will lift its arms embargo against mainland China in
view of the opposition from the majority of its member nations,
Republic of China deputy representative to the United States Stanley
Kao said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Kao was commenting on reports that Bernard Bot, minister of
foreign affairs of the Netherlands, who presides over the Council of
the European Union, had hinted that the E.U. might remove the
15-year-old ban on arms sales to China.
</P>
<P>
According to Kao, the majority of East European nations do not
support lifting the embargo, and the Netherlands is also inclined to
oppose the plan.
</P>
<P>
While Great Britain is not opposed to lifting the embargo under
certain conditions, France and Germany are the two prime movers
pressing the E.U. to end the ban, Kao pointed out.
</P>
<P>
By doing so, France is trying to expand the market for its
ammunition industry and to curry favor with Beijing in an effort to
create more business opportunities for French investors in China, Kao
said.
</P>
<P>
The United States, on the other hand, is objecting to the
proposal to lift the embargo and has recently sent officials to
Europe to express its opposition, Kao noted.
</P>
<P>
Kao said the U.S. may use its influence to lobby European
countries including Great Britain to block the plan, making it
uncertain as to whether the bid by France and Germany will be
successful.

CHINA FACTOR BEHIND CONFLICTING REPORTS ON VANUATU: FOREIGN MINISTRY
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Nov.  23  (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The "China factor" is to blame for
sometimes contradictory reports about relations between the Republic
of China and its latest diplomatic ally, Vanuatu, according to the
ROC Ministry of Foreign Affairs Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Foreign ministry spokesman Michel Lu was responding to reports
that Taiwan's relations with Vanuatu are on the rocks and that the
South Pacific island nation is being fickle in dealing with Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
"The foreign ministry is doing everything possible to solicit
more maneuvering space for the nation, " Lu said, noting that the
nation's diplomatic situation is very difficult because of mainland
China's unceasing efforts to isolate Taiwan. "If there was no 'China
factor' involved, people in Taiwan would most likely not have to be
subjected to the twists and turns in the drama with Vanuatu, " Lu
said.
</P>
<P>
Lu noted that the establishment of diplomatic relations between
the two countries is based on common interests.
</P>
<P>
Vanuatu can support Taiwan's bid to participate in international
organizations, while Taiwan's experience in manpower resource
investment, the fishery industry, public health and training for
high-tech jobs will be useful to Vanuatu.
</P>
<P>
He noted that between 1960 and 1975 the ROC received an average
of US$100 million a year in aid from the United States, and that the
achievements of Taiwan can be attributed to the concerted efforts of
the people as well as the aid of the international community to the
island.
</P>
<P>
The establishment of bilateral relations will enable Vanuatu to
share Taiwan's experiences, and help bring Taiwan businessmen to
Vanuatu, creating a win-win situation for both countries.
</P>
<P>
Lu said that since Vanuatu Prime Minister Serge Vohor and ROC
Minister of Foreign Affairs Tan Sun Chen signed a joint communique on
the establishment of diplomatic relations in Taipei on Nov. 3,
mainland China has tried its best to scuttle the relationship. The
foreign ministry will continue to fight this diplomatic battle, Lu
said.
</P>
<P>
Although there are differing stances within the Vanuatu
government on the establishment of relations with Taiwan, Lu said
that the foreign ministry will respect the wishes of the people of
Vanuatu and will continue to help form a consensus.
</P>
<P>
Reports have said that Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Kau
Ying-mao and Lin Sung-huan, director of the ministry's department of
East Asian and Pacific affairs, traveled to Vanuatu Nov. 20 to try to
cement bilateral relations, but the foreign ministry has only said
that it would not comment.
</P>
<P>
Lee Chuan-tung, vice director of the foreign ministry's
department of East Asia and Pacific affairs, said Vanuatu's
parliament called a special session Tuesday during which Vohor
explained the nature of the Taiwan-Vanuatu diplomatic relations to
the 46 members present to solicit their support.

Ukraine approached a political stalemate on Monday, as vote
counts of the presidential runoff election indicated that Prime
Minister Viktor F. Yanukovich had won but international observers
alleged systemic voting abuses and the opposition candidate refused
to accept defeat. With more than 99 percent of ballots counted, the
government tally gave Mr. Yanukovich 49.42 percent of the vote to
46.7 percent for Viktor A. Yushchenko, whose supporters turned out in
the tens of thousands in Independence Square here, vowing not to move
until results were reversed.

Wall Street Journal: Inside Abu Ghraib; missed red flags, team

What happened at Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq eight months after the
United States 372nd Military Police Company of Army reservists
shipped out to Iraq in March 2003 is now well known as a low point in
U.S. military history. Naked detainees were stacked in pyramids,
raped with phosphorescent light sticks and forced to masturbate in
groups. While all that and more happened, American soldiers smiled
for the cameras and signaled their approval with broad grins and
hoisted thumbs.

<P>
The Ministry of Education held a joint
celebration Tuesday for the 100th anniversary of 21 elementary
schools founded between 1904 and July 1905 around Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
An exhibition of some of the old artifacts used by the schools
was held at the ministry Tuesday, and they will also be on display at
the Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hall from Dec. 11-19.
</P>
<P>
The exhibit items included school flags of 100 years ago,
students' manuscripts, school diaries, school bells, old photos and
documents.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Education Tu Cheng-sheng said while schools used to
celebrate their 100th anniversary individually, the ministry will
hold joint celebrations every year starting this year to show its
concern for the schools' precious historical heritage.
</P>
<P>
According to Tu, modern education was introduced by the Japanese
colonial government into Taiwan in 1895, when two schools for the
purpose were established on the island.
</P>
<P>
While seven more schools were built in 1896, 56 schools were set
up in 1898, and 166 more were founded in 1904, Tu said.

MOI VOWS TO FOSTER ENVIRONMENT CONDUCIVE TO HAVING CHILDREN
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei, Nov. 23 (CNA)
(By sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The government will do its utmost to foster
an environment conducive to having children, Vice Minister of the
Interior Chien Tai-lang said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Chien made the pledge at a public hearing in Taipei on how to
encourage childbirth among young couples.
</P>
<P>
Quoting academic studies, Chien said the number of people aged 65
or older is likely to reach 39 percent of Taiwan's total population
by 2051.
</P>
<P>
By then, Chien said, Taiwan's streets could be filled with
silver-haired elderly people. Against this backdrop, he said,
encouraging people to have children is the government's established
policy.
</P>
<P>
Noting that having children is not only a personal duty but also
agovernment responsibility, Chien said the government will cultivate
an environment in which young couples are willing to have children.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics compiled by the Ministry of the Interior
(MOI) , Taiwan's childbirth rate ranked among the world's lowest in
2003, with 1.24 births per 1,000 persons. During the same year, the
birth rate was 1.2 births per 1,000 persons in Italy, 1.5 in Sweden,
1.9 in France, and 2 in the United States.
</P>
<P>
The Council for Economic Planning and Development once estimated
that Taiwan's population could begin to show negative growth after
registering zero growth in 2022. Some scholars said if the government
fails to adopt effective measures to encourage childbirth, Taiwan's
future would be doomed.
</P>
<P>
In response, Chien said the MOI has been organizing public
hearings in various parts of the island to collect opinions on how to
address low childbirth rate issues. All the opinions expressed in the
hearings will be included in the government's population policy white
paper to be published next March, he added.
</P>
<P>
During Tuesday's hearing, some conference-goers said the present
general social situation is too stressful to encourage young couples
to raise children. They said the government should work to lower the
unemployment rate first and resolve various social problems to reduce
stress in people's daily lives. Only when the general social
atmosphere is less stressful will young couples have a greater
interest in having children, they added.
</P>
<P>
Some infertile couples suggested that the government offer
financial subsidies or health insurance coverage for infertile
couples' first child delivered by expensive artificial reproduction
technology.
</P>
<P>
At the moment, the success rate of artificial insemination is
only 12.39 percent and would-be mothers have to endure great pain in
the process. Some attendees said they hope the government can invest
more in upgrading artificial insemination technology as an alternate
way to enhance the childbirth rate.
</P>
<P>
Some other participants said the government should beef up child
care systems by providing better daycare services. Moreover, they
said, the government should develop multifacted, well-rounded
education systems for young children. In addition to academic study,
they said, physical and aesthetic education should be given equal
emphasis.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, many representatives complained that private corporate
bosses fail to offer women employees child-rearing leave and flexible
work schemes for monthers with young kids. The present workplace
gender equality law stipulates that companies with 250 employees or
more should allow their employees to enjoy child-rearing leave, but
the law doesn't contain any penalties for violators. The present
Labor Standards Law also doesn't require employers to allow young
mothers to work more flexible schedules.

TAIPEI WILL HAVE PRIORITY RIGHT TO HOST 2006 ASIAN CITIES CONFERENCE
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei, Nov. 23 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taiwan will have priority right to host the
annual conference of the Asian Network of Major Cities (ANMC) in
2006, according to a joint declaration issued at the conclusion of
the Asian cities organization's conference Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Participants in the conference, which was held in Jakarta, issued
a six-point declaration that includes Taipei's priority right to host
the annual conference in 2006. a Taipei city government spokesman
said.
</P>
<P>
Yu Tze-hsiang said that all the ANMC members except Beijing
signed the Jakarta declaration. The Beijing delegation did not sign
because it is opposed to Taipei's hosting of the conference.
</P>
<P>
Yu noted that Taipei wanted to solicit the hosting right in 2005,
but Beijing won the right "through its barbaric manner."
</P>
<P>
He said that due to the efforts of the Taipei delegation, 10
members of the ANMC issued an open letter at the end of the
conference saying that they will not vie for the right to host the
2006 conference, which Yu said is "tantamount" to saying that Taipei
has won the right.
</P>
<P>
Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou, who attended the conference for the
first time in person, expressed regret at Beijing's attitude and
expressed appreciation for the support of the other members, Yu said.
</P>
<P>
Yu said the ANMC is mainly a forum for the capitals of Asian
countries to exchange views on issues relating to city development
such as medical care, traffic and technology.
</P>
<P>
Political issues are not relevant at the meeting, but Beijing
brought its dispute with Taiwan to the ANMC meeting by blocking
Taipei's bid to win the hosting right, he said.
</P>
<P>
"This attitude has hurt the feelings of Taiwan and is
unacceptable to the Taipei city government," Yu added.
</P>
<P>
He noted that in order to solicit the right to host the ANMC
conference in 2005, Taipei made the application in July this year.
</P>
<P>
According to practice, those who apply earlier will enjoy the
priority in hosting the conference the following year, and although
Beijing only applied earlier this month, it launched massive
diplomatic lobbying and the member states voted to grant Beijing the
right to host the 2005 meeting.
</P>
<P>
Tokyo formed the ANMC in 2000 and the organization held its first
plenary session in 2001.
</P>
<P>
The network groups 12 Asian capitals -- Tokyo, Taipei, Seoul,
Beijing, Hanoi, Manila, Bangkok, Kuala Lumpur, Singapore, Jakarta,
New Delhi and Yangon.

NO REFERENDUM ON ANY ISSUE OTHER THAN UNITING WITH CHINA: DPP LAWMAKER
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Nov.  23 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The ruling Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) will not call for a referendum on any issue other than the
possibility of uniting with mainland China, a DPP lawmaker said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Tsai Huang-liang, the secretary of the DPP caucus at the
Legislative Yuan, made the statement to rebut the opposition
Kuomintang's (KMT) allegations that the DPP is trying to change the
country's national emblem via a referendum, which would be tantamount
to a referendum on whether to keep the national flag or whether to
seek permanent separation from China.
</P>
<P>
Before there is consensus among the people on changing the
country's name, flag, emblem and anthem, Tsai said a referendum on
these issues would only fracture the country and the DPP knows better
than to do such a thing.
</P>
<P>
The only question that could be put to a referendum is whether
the country should change its political status quo, uniting with
China being one such option, Tsai said.
</P>
<P>
The KMT's allegations are meant to scare voters away from the
ruling party in the Dec. 11 legislative elections, Tsai said.
</P>
<P>
The country's emblem became an issue in the upcoming legislative
elections after President Chen Shui-bian said the KMT had to change
its party logo, which is very similar to the nation's insignia,
within three months, or face possible legislation that would force
them to change it.

 Taipei, Nov. 23 (CAN) The Ministry of National Defense (MND) said

<TEXT>
<P>
The Council of Labor Affairs (CLA) unveiled
a new program Tuesday to help needy foreign and mainland Chinese
spouses of local citizens land jobs.
</P>
<P>
According to the program, the CLA will offer subsidies for local
employers who hire foreign or mainland Chinese spouses for at least
six months. The subsidy is NT$5,000 per person per month for a
maximum period of 12 months.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the CLA will offer a subsidy of NT$95 per hour for
low-income local citizens' foreign or mainland spouses who work on an
hourly wage scheme. The subsidy will also be offered for a maximum
six-month period, with a ceiling of 176 hours per month.
</P>
<P>
Under the new subsidy program, the CLA hopes to help 5,000
foreign and mainland spouses land jobs per year. If all goes
smoothly, CLA officials said, the program will benefit 10,000
underprivileged foreign and mainland spouses by the end of
2006.
</P>
<P>
According to a Ministry of the Interior report, about 82,000
foreign spouses are now eligible to work in Taiwan and more than
28,000 of them already have jobs. Meanwhile, 32,000-plus mainland
spouses are qualified to work in Taiwan, 23,000-plus of whom have
landed jobs. Altogether, more than 62,000 mainland and foreign
spouses remain unemployed at present.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The 29th joint conference of the
Taiwan-Korea Business Council concluded in Seoul Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The conference was presided over by Wang Chih-kang, head of the
Korea Committee of Taiwan's Chinese International Economic
Cooperation Association, and his Korean counterpart, Park Yong-Oh,
from the Federation of Korean Industries.
</P>
<P>
At the end of the meeting, Wang and Park signed a joint statement
recording the conclusions reached in the conference and calling for
closer economic and trade cooperation between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Wang said the absence of diplomatic relations between Taiwan and
South Korea has impeded the resolution of problems in bilateral trade
and has cost a number of opportunities for economic cooperation and
technological exchanges.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that official channels of communication can
be restored soon to enhance the friendship and partnership between
the two sides.
</P>
<P>
While Korean soap operas are very popular in Taiwan, Korean foods
and commodities such as mobile phones, electrical appliances,
automobiles and clothing also sell very well, Wang pointed out.
</P>
<P>
After the launch of charter flights between the two sides, more
than 4,000 Korean tourists have visited the eastern county of Hualien
every month, which is the largest number among all foreign visitors,
Wang said.
</P>
<P>
However, official contact between Taipei and Seoul is confined to
the multilateral framework of international organizations such as the
World Trade Organization and the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation
forum, he noted.
</P>
<P>
He said it is the top priority for both sides to resume
bilateral, official interaction by exchanging visits, holding regular
economic cooperation conferences and signing a free trade agreement.
</P>
<P>
Wang said he hopes Tuesday's conference will help upgrade
bilateral economic and trade relations.
</P>
<P>
The 29-member delegation led by Wang is scheduled to return to
Taiwan Wednesday.

CABINET FULLY SUPPORTS TAIPEI'S BID TO HOST ASIAN CITIES CONFERENCE
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  Nov.  23 (CNA)

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Executive Yuan said Tuesday that it
regrets Beijing's "highhanded political interference" with exchanges
between Asian cities and that it supports Taipei's bid to host the
annual conference of Asian Network of Major Cities (ANMC).
</P>
<P>
Executive Yuan spokesman Chen Chi-mai made the remarks after the
ANMC awarded the right to host the 2005 conference of the Asian
cities organization to Beijing and gave Taipei the priority right to
hold the 2006 meeting.
</P>
<P>
Chen said that to promote cooperation and exchanges with other
major cities in Asia and upgrade the profile of Taiwan cities, the
Executive Yuan fully supports Taipei's bid to host the meeting.
</P>
<P>
But he said that from the process of Taipei's bid to solicit the
hosting rights, one can see the relentless squeezing and isolation
attempts by mainland China, adding that Taiwan people should also
transcend their partisan divisions and unite together when faced with
such suppression.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, he expressed appreciation for Tokyo Governor
Shintaro Ishihara and other members who supported Taipei's bid to
host the conference.
</P>
<P>
Chen noted that the ANMC groups 12 capital cities in Asia --
Tokyo, Taipei, Seoul, Beijing, Hanoi, Manila, Bangkok, Kuala Lumpur,
Singapore, Jakarta, New Delhi and Yangon -- with an aim of promoting
cooperation between the cities and discussing common issues such as
education, traffic, culture and economics. The issues of politics and
national sovereignty are irrelevant to such discussions, he added.

DPP MUST WIN 101 LEGISLATIVE SEATS IN UPCOMING ELECTIONS: PRESIDENT
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Nov. 23 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President Chen Shui-bian said Tuesday the
ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) must strive to win at least
101 seats in the new Legislative Yuan to be elected Dec. 11.
</P>
<P>
Chen issued the instruction at a weekly meeting of the DPP's
Central Standing Committee in his capacity as DPP chairman.
</P>
<P>
Noting that he has long outlined three main goals for the DPP for
2004 -- holding the first-ever nationwide referendum, winning the
presidency again and winning a clear legislative majority, Chen said
the first two goals have already been accomplished.
</P>
<P>
If the "pan-green camp" of the DPP and its ally -- the Taiwan
Solidarity Union -- fails to win more than half the seats in the
upcoming election, Chen said, his re-election will be meaningless
because the opposition "pan-blue alliance" will continue to block
implementation of his policy initiatives at every turn just as it has
done for the past four years.
</P>
<P>
In his view, Chen said, the "pan-green camp" will be able to win
a clear majority in the 225-seat legislature if the DPP can take 101
seats.
</P>
<P>
Judging from the significant growth in the number of votes he
garnered in the 2004 presidential elections, Chen went on, he is
confident that the DPP will be able to realize its goal.
</P>
<P>
"With confidence, sweat and the right strategy, we'll make it," a
confident Chen stressed.

A group of students from various U.S.
universities paid a visit to the Republic of China's representative
office in Washington, D.C. Monday and many of them expressed keen
interest in Taiwan's international status and independence issues.
</P>
<P>
The visit was arranged by the Washington Center for Internships
and Academic Seminars.
</P>
<P>
Kao Shou-tai, deputy ROC representative to the United States,
delivered a speech titled "Taiwan: Too Big to Ignore, " to the
students in which he explained in detail Taiwan's historical origins
and economic performance, its bid to join the United Nations and the
World Health Organization (WHO) , the present state of relations
across the Taiwan Strait and mainland China's suppression of Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Kao told his audience that Taiwan is already an independent
sovereign state and does not need to declare independence.
</P>
<P>
Despite its outstanding economic achievements, Kao said, Taiwan
had to spend 12 years realizing its goal of joining the World Trade
Organization (WTO) mainly because of Beijing's opposition.
</P>
<P>
Kao said Taiwan now pays a WTO membership fee equivalent to 2
percent of the WTO's annual budget. This amount is more than the
combined payment of the WTO's 48 African member states.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan is now striving to join the U.N. and the WHO and to sign
free trade agreements with the United States and Asian countries, Kao
went on.
</P>
<P>
Given its economic achievements, Kao said, Japan, New Zealand and
Australia originally planned to sign free trade agreements with
Taiwan. However, he went on, all three countries have shelved their
plans due to pressure from Beijing.

President Chen Shui-bian reiterated his
determination to force the opposition Kuomintang (KMT) to drop its
party logo, which it incorporated as part of the national emblem
during its five-decade regime.
</P>
<P>
Presiding over a weekly conference of the Democratic Progressive
Party (DPP) , of which he is concurrently chairman, Chen said he
wanted DPP members to understand the urgency of separating the
country from any particular political party, saying that is what the
2000 shift of power in Taiwan was meant for.
</P>
<P>
He accused the KMT, which founded the Republic of China in 1912,
of trying to dominate the country forever and of enacting a bill to
make the party's emblem part of the national emblem.
</P>
<P>
The issue was not addressed in the five decades until 2000, when
the DPP was swept to power in the general election, Chen said.
</P>
<P>
The power shift ushered in a period for the country to review its
former practices and to address the mistakes committed by the KMT,
Chen went on.
</P>
<P>
Since the KMT has made its party logo part of the national
emblem, Chen said, the KMT should be forbidden to use the logo, in
order to let the people know the state and the KMT are not
synonymous, Chen said.

During the January-October period, the tallies show, industrial
production enjoyed an annual growth rate of 11.48 percent.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the output of the manufacturing sector grew by
12.51 percent year-on-year.
</P>
<P>
However, the manufacturing sector's production in October posted
only a moderate growth of 3 percent over that of a year ago.
</P>
<P>
Chang Yao-chung, the MOEA's statistics department director,
attributed the slowdown of the manufacturing sector's production
expansion to domestic manufacturers' global deployment, international
oil price hikes, mainland China's efforts to cool down its overheated
economy and the uncertainty caused by interest rate hikes in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
According to results of a survey conducted by his department,
Chang noted, 23.82 percent of domestic manufacturers believe they
will receive more export orders in November than they did in October,
while 47.07 percent see fair prospects for November and 29.11 percent
are pessimistic.
</P>
<P>
Statistics compiled by the MOEA show that export orders received
by Taiwan manufacturers in October amounted to US$20.25 billion,
marking a 25.46 percent annual growth and posting the highest
single-month level on record.

PRESIDENT'S `PUSH FOR INDEPENDENCE' DENTS U.S. TRUST: KMT
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Nov. 23 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President Chen Shui-bian's so-called "push
for Taiwan independence" has dented U.S. trust in the Republic of
China and has made Taiwan's dialogue with mainland China virtually
impossible, opposition Kuomintang Chairman Lien Chan claimed Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Madrid-based newspaper El Pais, Lien said
the strained ties between Taiwan and the mainland is of great concern
to him because, he claimed, Chen's statements often catch Washington
off-guard.
</P>
<P>
U.S. President George W. Bush's latest reconfirmation of
Washington's commitment to its "one China" policy and former Secretary
of State Colin Powell's statement that Taiwan is not a sovereign
state and that its dispute with the mainland should be solved
peacefully all indicate a worrisome tip in Washington's attitude
towards China, Lien said.
</P>
<P>
As to the government trying to "rewrite" the country's history to
cover up its Chinese origins, Lien likened this to the attempts of
Adolf Hitler, Joseph Stalin and Benito Mussolini, who thought they
could change history in whatever way they wished once they had power.
</P>
<P>
With a government like this, Lien said, the Taiwanese will only
see the country reduced to insignificant status in the international
community, while the country's industries relocate overseas.
</P>
<P>
Lien accused Chen of using trickery in order to win his second
term and claimed that he "might resort to more innovative tricks" in
the upcoming legislative elections.

ROC ENVOY OPTIMISTIC ABOUT CROSS-STRAIT AIR LINKS TALKS RESUMING
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Washington, Nov. 23 (CNA)
(By Jorge Liu, Wennie Chi and Deborah Kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Republic of China representative to
the United States is optimistic that cross-Taiwan Strait talks on the
opening of direct air links will be resumed before long, hopefully
sometime next year, the Washington Times reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
David Ta-wei Lee hinted during a luncheon with Washington Times
editors and journalists Monday that Beijing is likely to acknowledge
President Chen Shui-bian's olive branches by making some favorable
responses, increasing the likelihood of a resumption of the
cross-strait air link talks, which have been suspended since 1999,
the daily reported.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the Central News Agency Tuesday, Lee said
that the "10-point" directive that President Chen gave during a
recent national security meeting has reopened a "window of
opportunity" for the two sides of the Taiwan Strait to resume
cross-strait air link talks.
</P>
<P>
In the "10-point" directive, President Chen exhorted relevant
government agencies to step up preparations for the opening of direct
trade, postal and transportation links with mainland China using the
"1992 Hong Kong talks" as the basis, Lee said.
</P>
<P>
President Chen also said he wants relevant government agencies to
start negotiations immediately with their mainland counterparts on
the opening of direct charter passenger flights across the Taiwan
Strait for the upcoming Chinese New Year holiday and non-stop charter
cargo flights based on the Hong Kong-Taiwan formula, Lee noted.
</P>
<P>
He added that the U.S. government has also on numerous occasions
suggested that Beijing grab the golden opportunity to re-start the
long-stalled cross-strait dialogue.
</P>
<P>
Also on Tuesday, Lee said during a press conference at the Twin
Oaks Garden that Taiwan has fully grasped the contents of the talks
between U.S. President George W. Bush and mainland Chinese President
Hu Jintao on the sidelines of the just-concluded informal leadership
summit of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum held in
Santiago, Chile.
</P>
<P>
From the Hu-Bush talks, Lee said, it was learned that Washington
would be pleased to see Taiwan and mainland China resume dialogue and
tackle their differences peacefully.
</P>
<P>
He commented that parts of the Hu-Bush talks concerning the
so-called Taiwan or cross-strait issues showed clear "consistency."
</P>
<P>
Lee also said that he foresees the new U.S. Secretary of State
Condoleezza Rice sticking closely to President Bush's firm opposition
to either side of the Taiwan Strait making potentially destabilizing
moves to change the status quo.
</P>
<P>
Asked about the possibility of meeting with Rice, Lee said that
there are currently no such arrangements due to "certain objective
constraints."

Opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Lien
Chan celebrated the 110th anniversary of the party Wednesday by first
paying tribute to its founder.
</P>
<P>
Lien went to the Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hall to pay his respects to
Dr. Sun Yat-sen, who founded the party in 1894, and then to Chiang
Kai-shek Memorial Hall to honor the party's longest-reigning leader.
</P>
<P>
The KMT will hold a celebration in a dome stadium in Taoyuan,
northern Taiwan later in the day.
</P>
<P>
Touching on the possible merger of the KMT and its two splinter
parties -- the New Party and the People First Party (PFP) -- Lien
said that a merger is inevitable and that the KMT will wait
patiently.
</P>
<P>
He also said that the nation is currently facing a daunting
situation and that his party will insist on its lofty ideals and
follow the right path. He added that the urgent tasks facing the
nation include creating a clearer national identity and more
harmonious society and strengthening the nation's democracy.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, PFP Chairman James Soong said while stumping for PFP
legislative candidates in southern Taiwan that the two parties can
talk about the course of a merger and related details next February
when the new legislature will be sworn in.
</P>
<P>
Presidential Office Secretary-General Su Tseng-chang took the
opportunity of the KMT's anniversary to extend congratulations to the
KMT, expressing the hope that the KMT can play the role of a loyal
opposition party to monitor the performance of the administration. He
added that he hopes the KMT can "transform" itself to keep in step
with Taiwan's democratic progress.
</P>
<P>
The KMT ruled Taiwan continuously for more than five decades
before it was swept out of power by the Democratic Progressive Party
in the 2000 presidential election.

</P>
<P>
In the 15-minute report to the WTO Committee on Trade in

Taiwan's stock market is growing steadily, and its insurance market

Kung also said that Taiwan's current advantages include a sound
financial system, abundant talent and capital, and a strong
manufacturing sector.

the island into a center for asset management and for raising funds
in the Asia-Pacific region.

views with Kung on the financial supervisory system and their own
countries' experiences in related matters.

Kung, who is heading a delegation of FSC and Taiwan Securities
Association officials on the visit to Switzerland, said the trip has

<P>
The Los Angeles-based Formosa
Foundation is scheduled to host a conference in Taipei Dec. 13,
immediately following Taiwan's legislative elections, on post
election U.S.-Taiwan-mainland China relations, a foundation source
said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The conference will take place at the Grand Hotel, with the
participation of at least six noted "China hands" and academics from
the United States and a larger number of political experts and
observers from Taiwan, said Donald S. Lee, chairman of the
foundation's board of directors.
</P>
<P>
The conference, titled "The Post-Election Era -- the Impact on
U.S., Taiwan and China Relations, " will tackle four related issues:
Taiwan in the post-2004 election era; cross-strait relations and
Taiwan's economic prospects; political and strategic development of
U.S.-Taiwan relations in the post-election era; and retrospective
views on the U.S. "one China" policy, according to Lee.
</P>
<P>
Lee said that holding the conference right after Taiwan's
important legislative elections slated for Dec. 11 is aimed mainly at
expressing the concerns of U.S. experts and academics on Taiwan's
democratization, as well as at enhancing the Taiwan people's resolve
in safeguarding freedom and democracy.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. "China hands" and academics that have confirmed that
they will attend the conference are John Thacik, research fellow in
China policy with the Heritage Foundation; Jacques deLisle, director
of the Asia Program under the Center for East Asia Studies at the
University of Pennsylvania; June Dreyer, professor of political
science at the University of Miami at Coral Gables; Daniel Lynch,
international relations professor at the University of Southern
California; and Richard Kagan, professor of history at Hamline
University, according to Lee.
</P>
<P>
The non-profit Formosa Foundation was founded in 2001 in Los
Angeles to promote greater understanding between Taiwan, the United
States and the People's Republic of China, and to preserve and
enhance democracy, liberty and human rights for the people of Taiwan.

Five young legislative candidates from the
opposition "pan-blue alliance" of the Kuomintang, New Party and
People First Party jointly spelled out their "five-no" and "five-yes"
platform Wednesday to woo supporters.
</P>
<P>
The five "pan-blue alliance" candidates, including Chou
Shou-hsun, who has been a TV anchorman and a KMT spokesman, vowed at
a press conference in their "five no" statement to push for peace (no
to war), strength (no to violence), professionalism (no to reward for
favors) , jobs (no to unemployment) and reconciliation (no to
confrontation).
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, they also put forward their "five-yes" proposals to
stabilize cross-Taiwan Strait relations and to improve relations
between the ruling and opposition parties in Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
The "five-yes" proposals are: pushing to make the Taiwan Strait a
no-war zone; requiring that future ROC premiers be technocrats with
strong economics backgrounds, instead of political puppets;
organizing a Taiwan peace corps to mainland China to optimize peace
across the strait; pushing for consultations between the ruling and
opposition parties; and seeking to shelve the cross-strait political
impasse issue for the next 30 years.

<P>
Nearly 100 women boxers from 16 countries
will take part in the Women's Boxing Taiwan International set to kick
off in Hualien, eastern Taiwan Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Lee Wu-nan, president of the Chinese Taipei Amateur Boxing
Association, said that this will be the largest international boxing
event in Taiwan in recent years.
</P>
<P>
Noting that women's boxing could be included in the 2008 Beijing
Olympics, Lee said that Taiwan began to promote women's boxing in
1999, or earlier than any other country in Asia.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan has won the right to host the third Asian Women's Boxing
Championship in 2005, and the association wants to stage the Hualien
invitational as a warm up for the championship, he added.
</P>
<P>
The Nov. 25-28 invitational will be divided into international
and domestic competitions, with boxers from the United States,
Russia, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Japan, mainland China, the
Philippines, India, Vietnam, Hong Kong, Macau, Sri Lanka, Nepal,
Mongolia and the host Republic of China taking part in the former,
and more than 500 boxers from Taiwan's 64 schools taking part in the
latter.

<P>
An exposition on the achievements of
lifelong learning of foreign spouses will be held in Kaohsiung,
southern Taiwan Sunday, with the aim of displaying the pluralistic
society of a Taiwan rich in different cultures, Education Minister Tu
Cheng-sheng announced Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Tu made the remarks during a press conference held at the
ministry to introduce the exposition.
</P>
<P>
Noting that one out of every seven or eight newborns in Taiwan
are the offspring of parents in inter-racial marriages, Tu said that
Taiwan has to face the issue squarely.
</P>
<P>
Education aims to allow foreign spouses to join the fabric of
Taiwan society, which in turn helps them educate their children, he
said.
</P>
<P>
With a view to creating a more pluralistic society, Tu said, the
Executive Yuan and his ministry don't want the foreign spouses to
"become thoroughly Taiwanese" by giving up their own cultures. Tu
added that he hopes these spouses from Vietnam, Thailand, Indonesia
and other Southeast Asian countries will be proud of their own
cultures and that the Taiwan people will try to understand these
cultures more.

BUSH ADMINISTRATION MULLING CANDIDATES FOR AIT CHAIRMANSHIP: ENVOY
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Washington,  Nov.  23 (CNA)
(By Oliver Lin and Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The U.S. government is scouting a
suitable person to serve as its top liaison officer with Taiwan in
the absence of formal diplomatic ties, the Republic of China
representative to the United States said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a regular news conference, David Ta-wei Lee said that
to the best of his understanding, relevant U.S. authorities are
weighing a short list of candidates for the top American Institute in
Taiwan (AIT) post which has been left vacant since the resignation of
former AIT Chairwoman Therese Shaheen in April this year.
</P>
<P>
Lee said a final decision is expected to be made after the new
U.S. secretary of state assumes office next January when U.S.
President George W. Bush will be sworn in for a second four-year
term.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Lee said he is delighted at Bush's decision to appoint
Stephen J. Hadley, incumbent deputy national security adviser, as the
new national security adviser.
</P>
<P>
Hadley will succeed outgoing National Security Adviser
Condoleezza Rice who has been designated as the new secretary of
state. Rice's appointment requires Senate approval, while Hadley's
does not.
</P>
<P>
Noting that Hadley has a deep understanding of the Taiwan Strait
issue, Lee said Taiwan welcomes Hadley's appointment as the new White
House national security adviser. Hadley understands every detail in
the Taiwan Strait issue, he added.
</P>
<P>
Touching on cross-strait relations, Lee said the ROC government
has a full grasp of the content of the talks between Bush and his
mainland Chinese counterpart, Hu Jintao, on the sidelines of the
just-concluded informal leadership meeting of the Asia-Pacific
Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum held in the Chilean capital of
Santiago.
</P>
<P>
Lee said the latest Bush-Hu talks underscored consistency in the
U.S. policy toward Taiwan and cross-strait issues. Lee said he
expects to meet in the coming days with U.S. officials who were
present at the annual APEC meeting to gain a better understanding of
the details regarding the latest Bush-Hu talks.
</P>
<P>
Asked whether the United States has moved to push the two sides
of the Taiwan Strait to resume the long-stalled dialogue, Lee said
the U.S. government would be pleased to see the two sides using
peaceful means to resolve their disputes in order to maintain the
present status quo across the Taiwan Strait.
</P>
<P>
Noting that President Chen Shui-bian has on many occasions
extended olive branches to Beijing, Lee said he is convinced that
there will be good opportunities for the two sides of the Taiwan
Strait to resume dialogue in the coming two years.
</P>
<P>
"President Chen's May 20 inauguration speech, Oct. 10 National
Day address and Nov. 10 directives at a National Security Council
meeting have opened up a 'window of opportunity' for cross-strait
dialogue, "Lee said.
</P>
<P>
He further said the Bush administration's policies toward Taiwan
and China are expected to remain unchanged after Rice takes over from
Colin Powell as secretary of state.
</P>
<P>
"We have come to a full comprehension of the possible directions
of U.S. policies toward East Asia and the Taiwan Strait situations
after Rice becomes the top U.S. diplomat," Lee added.
</P>
<P>
With Thanksgiving Day just around the corner, Lee hosted an
evening party with Taiwanese dishes and snacks Tuesday in honor of
journalists of Chinese-language media stationed in Washington, D.C.

TAIWAN EXPATS IN LOS ANGLES TO RETURN FOR LEGISLATIVE STUMPING
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Los Angles,  Nov.  23 (CNA)
(By L.S. Chu and Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With the approach of the Dec. 11
legislative elections, Taiwan expatriates in Los Angeles are
returning to Taiwan to lend support to their favored candidates.
</P>
<P>
As voters in the legislative elections have to reside in a
constituency for six consecutive months to be eligible to vote in the
elections, most of the expatriates are unlikely to be able to take
part in the voting.
</P>
<P>
For this reason, the numbers returning are relatively smaller
than those who returned for the March 20 presidential elections and
most of the returnees are returning to take part in the campaign.
</P>
<P>
In the case of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), the
DPP's branch on the west coast of the United States and another group
friendly toward President Chen Shui-bian have decided to pool their
strength to stump for three DPP candidates -- Trong Chai, Chiang
Chao-yi and Hsiao Bi-khim -- who have either studied or worked in the
United States and who are considered to be more relevant to Taiwan
expatriates.
</P>
<P>
As of Tuesday, more than 1,000 expatriates had registered to take
part in the DPP stumping for the three candidates, while supporters
of the opposition Kuomintang, People First Party and the Taiwan
Solidarity Union have decided that they will provide assistance based
on the needs of the individual candidates.
</P>
<P>
As the number of DPP supporters is very large, the first batch is
expected to return to Taiwan Thursday and to join the campaign
Saturday, while opposition supporters will return in smaller groups
and then travel to various cities and counties to stump for specific
candidates.

CROSS-STRAIT CURRENCY SETTLEMENT SYSTEM UNDER ASSESSMENT: CBC
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  Nov.  24 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Responding to reports that new Taiwan
dollars can be directly exchanged for renminbi at some mainland
Chinese banks, a key figure said Wednesday that the issue regarding
setting up a currency settlement system between Taiwan and the
mainland is being assessed by relevant authorities.
</P>
<P>
Hsu Yi-hsiung, deputy governor of the Taipei-based Central Bank
of China (CBC) , made the remarks following news from Taiwan
businessmen operating on the mainland that the local currency can be
directly exchanged into renminbi at some mainland banks.
</P>
<P>
On the question of whether the CBC will allow one month in which
renminbi can be exchanged for new Taiwan dollars on a trial base on
Taiwan's frontline Kinmen and Matsu islands, Hsu said that the CBC
and the Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) are gauging the possibility of
such a move.
</P>
<P>
He also claimed that it is technically difficult for the CBC to
calculate how many new Taiwan dollars have been brought by Taiwan
people to the mainland, although there are widespread rumors that
more than NT$50 billion worth of domestic currency has been carried
to the mainland.
</P>
<P>
MAC Chairman Joseph Wu told a news conference later the same day
that there is no set timetable regarding when such a policy might be
implemented and he suggested that the two sides of the Taiwan Strait
model any such policy on a settlement pact inked late last year
between Hong Kong and the mainland.
</P>
<P>
MAC Vice Chairman Chiu Tai-san said on the same occasion that a
cross-strait settlement pact must be clinched before the mainland
currency can be allowed to be exchanged in Taiwan and on the offshore
islands.
</P>
<P>
Chiu said that the MAC, the CBC and the Financial Supervisory
Council have yet to consult local banks on their willingness to start
renminbi operations and on their capabilities to take the risks
brought about by this operation.
</P>
<P>
He claimed that the Taiwan authorities are waiting for a positive
response from the mainland to the idea of two-way negotiations and
ruled out any links between the issue and a mainland plan to permit
people from Fujian Province to make pleasure trips to the Kinmen and
Matsu islands in the near future.

PARTIES PLAY `ORANGE' CARD AS CITRUS PRICES NOSEDIVE
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Nov.  24 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
All parties across Taiwan's political
spectrum have been playing the so-called "orange" card at the height
of the legislative election campaign, using the nosediving prices of
the fruit as a tool to broaden support base or lash out at rivals.
</P>
<P>
After the opposition Kuomintang (KMT) lambasted the government
for failing to safeguard fruit farmers' interests, the legislative
caucus of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) announced
Wednesday that it will buy 20,000 taels (a tael is equivalent to 600
grams) of oranges from fruit farmers to help compensate for
over-production of the seasonal fruit.
</P>
<P>
The wholesale price of domestic oranges has plummeted to NT$1 per
fruit over the past several days due to over-production, causing
widespread outcry from growers, who are complaining that the income
from 5 kg of oranges cannot even buy 1 kg of fertilizer or pesticide,
not to mention labor and time costs.
</P>
<P>
Echoing the DPP legislative caucus' enthusiasm, DPP legislators
Chen Mao-nan and Kao Chien-chih also announced that they will each
purchase 3,000 taels of oranges from the farmers to help tide them
over their difficulties.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Huang Teh-fu, a KMT party whip at the Legislative
Yuan, accompanied officials from the Taiwan Farmers Cooperative and a
KMT legislative candidate at a press conference to express the
farmers' plight and offer advice to the government on solutions.
</P>
<P>
Huang criticized the government for being aware of the problem
but doing nothing except electioneering.
</P>
<P>
According to Pai Tien-chih, the KMT candidate, while prices for
fertilizers and pesticides continue to rise, the prices of locally
produced vegetables and fruit continue to plummet, causing further
aggravation for farmers.
</P>
<P>
Since the DPP took the helm of the central government, Pai said,
Taiwan's unemployment rate has continued to surge. With more people
unable to find jobs in Taipei returning to rural areas, villagers'
and farmers' lives have worsened, he added.
</P>
<P>
Pai suggested that the government provide subsidies to fruit
growers in the same way that it subsidizes the country's rice
farmers.
</P>
<P>
Also blasting the government's inability to offset the orange
crisis, opposition People First Party (PFP) Chairman James Soong said
his heart goes out to the fruit growers, who are leading bitter lives
despite the sweetness of their produce.
</P>
<P>
Soong claimed that he will send PFP legislative candidate Lee
Cheng-ling and Tsai Sheng-chia, chief executive of the Tainan County
Farmers Association and a PFP candidate, to mainland China for
negotiations to allow the export of locally produced fruit to
mainland China.

GOVERNMENT MIGHT ACTIVATE PURCHASE SYSTEM TO HELP PROP UP ORANGE PRICE
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Nov. 24 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Premier Yu Shyi-kun said Wednesday that if
necessary, the government will activate a purchase system to help
prop up the price of local oranges.
</P>
<P>
Yu issued the instruction during a floor meeting of the Executive
Yuan to hear reports on orange production and distribution by the
Council of Agriculture (COA).
</P>
<P>
The premier said that if all other means of promotion are
exhausted and the price of oranges still falls below the production
cost, the COA will activate a "95 project, " meaning that the
government will purchase oranges in great numbers at a price of 95
percent of the production cost to help bring the price up.
</P>
<P>
COA officials noted that total production of oranges is expected
to reach 230,000 tons this year, up 13 percent from last year. The
overproduction has caused the price to slump continuously and the COA
has implemented various promotion measures to deal with the
situation.
</P>
<P>
The premier asked the COA to step up these promotion activities
in the hope that consumers will buy more of the fruit.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of National Defense (MND) should also step up
purchases, the premier said. The MND has estimated that it will be
able to consume 1,000 tons of oranges between December and next
March if it provides the fruit to servicemen.
</P>
<P>
Also, Yu asked the COA to help growers and farmers groups to
embark on a stockpiling program by preserving 10,000 tons of oranges
at normal temperature and 5,000 tons at low temperature. The COA will
then put them on the market between February and May next year
contingent on market needs.
</P>
<P>
On the processing of orange juice, the premier instructed that
the COA and other agencies purchase inferior quality oranges to
produce juice starting Nov. 20 at a purchase price of NT$7 (US$0.22)
per kilo. The planned purchase amount is 6,000 tons, but this could
be increased if necessary.
</P>
<P>
All agricultural administrative agencies around the island must
also step up promotion between now and Feb. 28, with the goal of
selling 2,000 tons of oranges.
</P>
<P>
In the longer term, the premier instructed that the COA should
speed up adjustment of the structure of the fruit industry and reform
its distribution system, especially international marketing channels,
so as to help the nation's farmers.

ACTIVISTS UNVEIL LIST OF LAWMAKERS SUPPORTING TAX CUTS FOR THE RICH
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Nov. 24 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Pan-Purple Alliance, a private group
dedicated to promoting fair and just social welfare services and
speaking for the underprivileged, unveiled a list of lawmakers
Wednesday who it claims support tax cuts for the rich.
</P>
<P>
Chien Hsi-chieh, convener of the alliance, joined with the chief
executives of several other like-minded social groups in unveiling
the list at a news conference dubbed "Beware! Look Who Is Undermining
Our National Finances."
</P>
<P>
Over the past 10 years, Chien said, the nation's financial status
has continued to worsen, with the ratio of tax revenues to gross
domestic product (GDP) declining from 18.6 percent to 12.3 percent.
As the tax revenues have decreased by NT$700 billion over the past
decade, Chien said, the government has had to sell its land
holdings and stocks, as well as float state bonds, to make ends meet.
</P>
<P>
Ignoring the government's financial straits, Chien claimed, the
Legislative Yuan has passed revisions to three major bills that
"would allow business corporations and wealthy families to evade
taxes with legal protection."
</P>
<P>
The three bills refer to packages of revisions to the statute on
promoting industrial upgrading, the statute on land value increment
tax and the inheritance and gift tax law.
</P>
<P>
In the run-up to the Dec. 11 legislative elections, Chien said,
candidates of different political stripes are gearing up to canvass
votes. However, he claimed, few candidates have paid attention to
issues related to people's livelihoods, such as government finances
and welfare services for the underprivileged.
</P>
<P>
Chien said the Pan-Purple Alliance has consequently decided to
unveil a list of legislators who have initiated the above-mentioned
three bills and are seeking re-election in the upcoming vote.
</P>
<P>
The listed lawmakers come from across the political spectrum,
Chien said, adding that the move should serve as a warning to those
legislators.
</P>
<P>
In response to the move, Huang Chung-yuan, legislative whip of
the opposition Taiwan Solidarity Union, who was named by the alliance
as one of the initiators of the revised statute on promoting
industrial upgrading, said the revisions were mainly aimed at
creating a better investment climate to boost private investment and
increase job openings.
</P>
<P>
If the tax rate is too high, Huang said, it may result in an
exodus of industries and a reduction in job opportunities.
</P>
<P>
As to the proposed revisions to the inheritance and gift tax law,
Huang said the proposals are aimed at enabling the government to
actually collect taxes from rich people. Excessively high tax rates,
he went on, can only prompt wealthy families to use every possible
means to evade taxes.
</P>
<P>
Norman Yin, an finance professor-turned-lawmaker of the
opposition People First Party, who has pushed for a 50 percent cut in
land value increment tax, said the tax cut is aimed at making the
country's taxation system more reasonable and more just. The
"pan-purple alliance, " he claimed, has just paid heed to the land
value increment tax rate cut while failing to pay attention to
unreasonable clauses in the existing tax laws.
</P>
<P>
Some lawmakers of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)
are also on the list and Tsai Huang-liang, DPP legislative whip, said
the party caucus must respect individual lawmaker's rights to
initiate legislative bills.
</P>
<P>
In the future, Tsai said, the DPP caucus will exercise more
prudence in screening legislative bills, particularly those regarding
tax cuts. "Fairness, justice and the government's financial status
will all be weighed carefully in the legislative process, " he said,
adding that the DPP will do its utmost to achieve social justice and
avoid further widening the domestic wealth gap.

<P>
Taiwan and the United States are slated to
reopen talks on the Trade and Investment Framework Agreement (TIFA)
next week in Washington, D.C., officials of the Ministry of Economic
Affairs (MOEA) said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Vice Minister of Economic Affairs Chen Ruey-long and Josette
Sheeran Shiner, U.S. deputy trade representative, will hold the talks
next Monday and Tuesday on behalf of their respective governments,
the officials said.

</P>
<P>
The two sides will discuss economic issues of mutual concern, in
addition to stalled issues related to the protection of intellectual
property rights, Taiwan's market opening to foreign rice imports,
telecommunications services and pharmaceutical pricing.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan and the United States first conducted the TIFA talks in
1995, and the talks were held again in 1997 and 1998. The fourth
round of talks in 2002 were postponed until now by the U.S. for what
it called lackluster performance on Taiwan's part in resolving key
matters related to the stalled issues.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan has been hoping to rekindle the TIFA talks to further
boost bilateral economic and trade relations during the second term
of President George W. Bush.
</P>

After concluding the TIFA talks, Chen will travel to San
Francisco, where he will discuss the signing of a free trade
agreement with officials from Nicaragua between the two
countries.

Tokyo,  Nov.  24 (CNA)

<TEXT>
<P>
Lin Chih-ling, a popular Taiwan fashion
model, paid a courtesy call on Japanese Minister of Land,
Infrastructure and Transportation Kazuo Kitagawa Wednesday in her
capacity as a goodwill envoy for a tourism promotional campaign to
attract tourists from Taiwan, a post she assumed Nov. 17.
</P>
<P>
Ministry staff members swarmed to Kitagawa's office to get a

Taiwan tourists to Japan is expected to break the 1 million mark in
the next few days, Kitagawa said, adding that he is very grateful for
Lin's assistance in helping promote Japan to prospective Taiwan
tourists.

FORMER CZECH PRESIDENT ENDS TAIWAN VISIT

Taipei,  Nov.  24 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Former Czech Republic President Vaclav
Havel concluded his six-day visit to Taiwan Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Havel said prior to his departure that he would treasure the
memory of his first-ever Taiwan visit very much. The poet and
playwright-turned-politician lauded Taiwan as a country that respects
freedom and democracy.
</P>
<P>
As Havel accidentally slipped in his hotel room and broke his leg
on the first day of his arrival in Taipei, his itinerary was
partially affected and he canceled planned tours of the National
Palace Museum and several other cultural institutions. He also
canceled a plan to visit Thailand following his Taipei trip.
</P>
<P>
During his visit, Havel delivered a speech on globalization and
the future of democracy at the National Central Library in Taipei,
attracting a packed audience. Many fans of his books traveled from al
over Taiwan to listen to his speech and obtain his autograph.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, President Chen Shui-bian decorated Havel with the
Order of Brilliant Star with Special Grand Cordon in recognition of
his contributions to the promotion of relations between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
Praising Havel as a world-class literary figure, thinker and
political leader, as well as a conscientious political dissident,
Chen said he was honored to meet Havel in person.
</P>
<P>
Havel played a pivotal role in his country's "velvet revolution"
of 1989, using his literary and theatrical creations to kindle and
keep the flame of democracy burning amidst a storm of repression and
autocracy during communist rule. He eventually led his country to
break the shackles of communist suppression and move toward
democracy. During his 12-year presidency, he continued working hard
to consolidate the Czech Republic's democratic system as well as
promote human rights and social justice, earning wide respect and
admiration.
</P>
<P>
Havel has been friendly toward Taiwan and has on many occasions
explicitly supported Taiwan's bid to join the United Nations.

CROSS-STRAIT TALKS LIKELY AFTER DEC. 11 ELECTIONS: MAC
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Nov.  24 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The two sides of the Taiwan Strait are
likely to resume long-stalled talks after Taiwan's Dec. 11
legislative elections, Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) Chairman Joseph
Wu claimed Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Wu said the opportunity for the two sides to talk about the
opening of direct cross-strait charter passenger flights during the
upcoming Chinese New Year holiday after Taiwan's legislative
elections still exists.
</P>
<P>
"The flip-flops in Beijing's attitude toward Taiwan after
President Chen Shui-bian extended olive branches on many occasions
since his inauguration in May indicate that Beijing has yet to reach
a final decision on the charter flight issue," Wu said.
</P>
<P>
Through cross-strait scholastic exchanges, Wu said, he gets the
impression that the mainland Chinese authorities are still weighing
Chen's proposal about opening direct cross-strait passenger and cargo
charter flights.
</P>
<P>
According to Wu, some mainland scholars have said Beijing will
carefully consider Chen's proposal in the run-up to Taiwan's
legislative elections and make a final decision after the elections.
</P>
<P>
With Beijing's consent, Taiwan carriers operated special charter
flights between Shanghai and Taipei/Kaohsiung via Hong Kong/Macau
during the 2003 Chinese New Year period. The services were not
offered during the 2004 Chinese New Year holiday because Beijing
insisted that mainland carriers be allowed to also provide the same
flight services while declining to negotiate the necessary technical
details with Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
The ROC government said that as the opening of two-way, non-stop
cross-strait charter flight services involves the exercise of public
authority, prior negotiations are necessary. The upcoming lunar New
Year holiday falls between Feb. 6, 2005 and Feb. 13.

KINMEN SHOULD BE PREPARED FOR INFLUX OF FUJIAN VISITORS: PROSECUTOR
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Nov.  24 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the face of a much-expected influx of
tourists from mainland China's Fujian Province, Kinmen Public
Prosecutor General Tsai Juei-tsung has urged the Kinmen authorities
to take precautions against a possible worsening of social order.
</P>
<P>
Tsai issued the call Tuesday while making a report during a
meeting with local police, prosecution and investigation agents, in
which Kinmen County Magistrate Lee Chu-feng also took part.
</P>
<P>
Although Tsai admitted that social order on the frontline island
has not shown signs of deterioration over the almost four years since
the Jan. 1, 2001 opening of the "three mini links" -- direct trade
and transportation links between Kinmen and Xiamen and between Matsu
and Mawei -- he still called for heightened alert to secure public
order on Kinmen with the expected inflow of tourists from Fujian.
</P>
<P>
Since the inception of the mini links, the Kinmen Prosecutor's
Office has received a monthly average of 60 complaints each year,
except for 2002, Tsai reported.
</P>
<P>
The office got an average of 59.9 cases per month in 2001, 64.5
complaints in 2002, and 57.9 in 2003, according to Tsai. For the
first 11 months of this year, there was an average of 59.7 complaints
per month, he added.
</P>
<P>
Despite the fact that there have been no serious or violent
crimes reported over the past few years on Kinmen, he urged relevant
authorities to be wary of possible consequences that might result
from an influx of tourists from the Fujian area, in particular, the
smuggling of arms and drugs.
</P>
<P>
He said that he has repeatedly urged the central government in
Taipei to legalize petty trade on Kinmen's beaches in order to
effectively wipe out the smuggling of arms and narcotics from
mainland China via the frontline island that has long been a serious
problem without being realized.
</P>
<P>
According to Lee, Fujian residents might be permitted by the
mainland authorities to go sight-seeing on Kinmen by the end of this
year. In the initial stage, up to 600 people would be allowed in per
day, he said, urging the relevant agencies to pay greater heed to
stem any irregularities.
</P>
<P>
He also echoed Tsai's call by urging the central government to
make Kinmen's beach trade legal in order to better manage the long
standing practice and stop related illegal activities.

TAIPEI MAYOR: BEIJING OFFENDS MAYORS OF ASIAN CITIES
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Nov.  24 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou said Wednesday
that the "rudeness and unreasonableness" of mainland Chinese
representatives to the meeting of the Asian Network of Major Cities
(ANMC) in Jakarta Nov. 22-23 offended everyone at the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Ma, who had just returned from the meeting, told journalists that
Taipei has won the priority right to host the 2006 ANMC meeting,
despite opposition from Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Ma said Taipei bid to host the 2005 meeting in July, but Beijing
entered the race against Taipei for the right only a few days before
the 2004 Jakarta meeting, simply because it did not want to see
Taipei play any significant role in the meeting.
</P>
<P>
In a vote to choose between Taipei and Beijing, Beijing won seven
out of 12 votes, which was one vote shy of the two-thirds of the vote
needed to win the hosting right.
</P>
<P>
In the ensuing negotiations, all of the meeting-attendants except
Beijing Deputy Mayor Zhang Mao, the Beijing representative, agreed
that Beijing should host the 2005 meeting, with Taipei getting the
priority right to host the 2006 meeting, Ma said.
</P>
<P>
When the chairman of the meeting announced the results of the
negotiations, Beijing's representative walked out in protest.
</P>
<P>
Ma expressed regret that Beijing representative did his best to
scuttle Taipei's chance to play a role on the international stage.
</P>
<P>
However, Ma did not rule out the possibility of attending the
2005 meeting in Beijing in spite of his unhappy encounter with Zhang,
and said he anticipates no difficulty in getting the Executive Yuan's
approval to visit Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Founded in 2001 by Tokyo Governor Shintaro Ishihara, the ANMC is
meant to be a forum of mayors of major Asian cities. It groups
Bangkok, Beijing, Delhi, Hanoi, Jakarta, Kuala Lumpur, Manila, Seoul,
Singapore, Taipei, Tokyo and Yangon.

Mencius' lesson of the day: "Benevolence subdues its opposite
just as water subdues fire. Those, however, who nowadays practice
benevolence (do it) as if with a cup of water they could save a whole
wagon on fire, and then when the flames were not extinguished were to
say that water cannot subdue fire. Such a course is the greatest aid
to what is not benevolent."

THINK TANK CHIEF DEFINES MAJOR TASKS OF TAIWAN BUSINESSES INVESTING OVERSEAS

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Tapping markets and establishing brands
have become the major tasks of Taiwan businesses investing overseas,
the head of a local think tank said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Vincent Siew, chairman of the Chung-Hwa Institution for Economic
Research, made the remarks in a seminar on the experiences of Taiwan
businesspeople investing overseas.
</P>
<P>
Several entrepreneurs -- including Giant Chairman Liu Chin-piao
and Johnson Health Tech Chairman Lo Kun-chuan -- were also on hand to
share their experiences in investing overseas.
</P>
<P>
Siew, an expert in economics, said that with the changing world
situation, Taiwan businesspeople have flocked overseas, mostly to
mainland China and Southeast Asia. However, he added that in order to
maintain their competitiveness, Taiwan businesspeople have to
continue to expand to other parts of the world.
</P>
<P>
He noted that years ago, Taiwanese invested overseas mainly for
the purpose of cutting their production costs. However, in recent
years, their overseas investment has not been confined to the
establishment of production bases, but has come to include the
tapping of new markets, the establishing of brand names and marketing
channels, and the integrating of multinational resources.

SWISS FATHER'S SCHEME LEADS ABORIGINALS TO SAVE
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taitung,  eastern Taiwan,  Nov.  25 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A co-op venture system
introduced some thirty years ago in Taitung by the late Swiss
Catholic Father Dominik Stener has not only helped foster good
savings habits among aboriginal people in the county but also a
stronger community spirit over the years.
</P>
<P>
The Rev. Dominik Stener, a Jesuit missionary who was assigned to
eastern Taiwan to sponsor churches there in 1964, introduced the
co-op venture system in 1967 as a scheme to encourage aboriginal
residents to "save money for a rainy day."
</P>
<P>
Stener died of an illness in Taitung two years ago. The Yiwan
Church, where he had resided and preached, has been turned into a
memorial hall in his memory.
</P>
<P>
Liu Hua-pi, chief of Ningpu village, said that savings in the
co-op in the Ningpu-Danman tribal region total about NT$200 million
at present, with the figure steadily increasing as villagers
enthusiastically put their money into the co-op.
</P>
<P>
A senior tribe member, who has been a member of the co-op for
decades, said that he has enjoyed the convenience of borrowing cash
from the co-op. Even if someone wants to borrow money in excess of
the amount in their savings deposit, they won't encounter many
difficulties so long as they can produce a guarantor, he explained.
</P>
<P>
An old lady, the only non-aboriginal co-op member, said she
joined the group more than 10 years ago and has found it to be much
better than any bank.
</P>
<P>
The co-op, which is managed by a committee manned by
representative members, has also been known for its leniency toward
its members, never "pressing" debtors to repay loans or interest on
the loans, Liu said.
</P>
<P>
In 1965, two Taiwan-based foreign Jesuit fathers and two local
Catholic followers went to Bangkok to attend a regional conference on
social and economic development in Asia. During the conference, the
four picked up the know-how for establishing saving co-op ventures,
an idea invented by German Friedrich Wilhelm Raiffeisen (1818-1888).
</P>
<P>
Raiffeisen, leader of a cooperative movement, once said that the
best way to solve social and economic problems of the people is to
let them help themselves.
</P>
<P>
The Taitung co-op was established in 1967 after Father Stener
sent two members of the Amis tribe to Taichung to learn about co-op
venture systems in lectures given by the four people who attended the
conference in Bangkok.
</P>
<P>
The Taitung co-op formally registered with the government in
August 1982 to become the first legal, public-interest cooperative in
Taiwan.

GOVERNMENT URGED TO DEAL WITH RISING CONSUMER PRICES

<TEXT>
<P>
Legislators from the opposition People
First Party (PFP) on Thursday urged the government to come up with
measures to deal with the issue of rising prices of daily
necessities.
</P>
<P>
PFP Legislators Liu Wen-hsiung and Lee Hung-chun said that the
government should pay attention to the problem of rising consumer
prices while the salary of the average person has not increased
accordingly.
</P>
<P>
Lee cited the first three quarters of this year as an example,
saying that the wholesale price index increased 6.5 percent, the
consumer price index rose 1.5 percent, while salaries declined by
0.46 percent on average.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the increase in the price of raw materials
was 22.6 percent in the third quarter, but the consumer price
increase during the same period was only 0.7 percent, showing that
consumer price increases have been contained for the time being.
However, he expressed concerns that it can no longer be contained,
leading to dramatic increases in the price of daily necessities.
</P>
<P>
Lee also noted that the ruling Democratic Progressive Party
recently purchased 20,000 kilograms of oranges after overproduction
of the fruit triggered a price slump. However, he added, this will
not solve the fruit growers' problem, saying that the government
should address the impact on agricultural products of Taiwan's entry
into the World Trade Organization Jan. 1, 2002, and map out a
comprehensive policy to deal with it.
</P>
<P>
Legislator Liu also expressed the hope that the government will
not place its focus solely on the Dec. 11 legislative elections and
will come up with measures to solve the problem of rising prices of
daily necessities.

CALL FOR HALVING ARMS PROCUREMENT BUDGET AN 'ELECTION PLOY': DPP
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Nov.  25 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The ruling Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) on Thursday criticized a call by the opposition Kuomintang to
halve the special budget for arms procurement from the United States
as an "election ploy."
</P>
<P>
Tsai Huang-liang, DPP whip in the Legislative Yuan, was
responding to a call by KMT Chairman Lien Chan during a celebration
of the party's 110th anniversary party the previous day.
</P>
<P>
Lien said that if the special budget of NT$610.8 billion
(US$18.23 billion) for the purchase of six Patriot PAC-3 anti-missile
batteries, eight diesel-electric submarines and a squadron of 12
P-3C anti-submarine aircraft from the United States can be halved and
the extra money used for social welfare programs, the opposition
parties are willing to have the proposal put to early screening by
legislative committee after the Dec. 11 legislative elections.
</P>
<P>
Tsai said that Lien's call shows his total disregard for national
security by turning arms procurement into "horseplay" to try to win
votes.
</P>
<P>
"Arms procurement and social welfare are two different things, "
Tsai said, noting that if the KMT wants to spend more on social
welfare programs, this can be achieved through consultation among the
parties.
</P>
<P>
He urged the opposition to respect the judgment of the Ministry
of National Defense and pass the budget as soon as possible, adding
that if the opposition really loves Taiwan, it should form a team to
monitor the use of the budgets.
</P>
<P>
James Huang, deputy secretary-general of the Presidential Office,
also said that the point is whether Taiwan can buy arms at a
reasonable price, adding that the proposal should be subjected to
screening by the legislature and not arbitrarily decided by any
single party.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, although the KMT and its ally, the People First Party
(PFP), blocked a bill authorizing the special arms procurement budget
earlier this month, a KMT party whip in the legislature said the
party is not against arms procurement.
</P>
<P>
"We are only against a bloated budget for such procurement, "
Huang Teh-fu said.
</P>
<P>
Quoting KMT's information, Huang claimed that back in 2002,
Premier Yu Shyi-kun and then National Defense Minister Tang Yiau-min
said the arms procurement for the Patriot PAC-3 batteries, eight
submarines and 12 P-3C aircraft required only about NT$280 billion,
but when the Executive Yuan proposed it in June this year, it had
ballooned to NT$610.8 billion.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Huang claimed that the DPP administration has
registered deficits of NT$250 billion a year since coming to power in
2000, accumulating a debt of NT$1.0002 trillion after five years in
power.
It has also sold state-owned shares and land cheaply, resulting in a
squandering of national assets of at least NT$480 billion per year,
he added.
</P>
<P>
Huang said that if the Executive Yuan withdraws its proposal and
resubmits it after cutting the amount by half, the KMT will consider
putting the arms procurement proposal forward for screening in the
legislature.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, PFP Legislator Liu Wen-hsiung said that the PFP also
supports arms procurement at a reasonable price, but that it is
against squandering money by making the arms purchase at such an
inflated price.

KMT DENIES REPORT ON SALE OF CENTRAL INVESTMENT HOLDING CO.

Taipei,  Nov. 25 (CNA)

<TEXT>
<P>
A high-ranking official of the opposition
Kuomintang (KMT) on Thursday denied reports that the party has sold
the Central Investment Holding Co. to the Chinatrust Group at a price
of NT$17 billion (US$526.31 million).
</P>
<P>
Chang Che-shen, chairman of the KMT's Administration and
Management Committee, said the party has never contacted the
Chinatrust Group about such a deal.
</P>
<P>
Chang did confirm that a number of buyers had shown interest in
taking over the company, but added that no deal was struck with any
of them. He said all the potential buyers have been scared away
because the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) government reportedly
has vowed to intervene to bar the KMT from selling off its assets.
</P>
<P>
He said that it is the KMT's policy to stop operating commercial
businesses and that the party is disposing of its assets through
lawful means.
</P>
<P>
Chinatrust Group head Jeffery Koo also denied the report,
pointing out that his group has not purchased the KMT-controlled
company.
</P>
<P>
Also on Thursday, Premier Yu Shyi-kun criticized the KMT for
attempting to cash in its "ill-gotten" assets to evade its
responsibility of returning the assets to the government and the
people.
</P>
<P>
Yu said the move is inconsistent with KMT Chairman Lien Chan's
promise to return the assets.
</P>
<P>
The premier also said the DPP and its ally parties must win a
majority of seats in the Legislative Yuan in the Dec. 11 elections in
order to push through a law to retrieve the assets from the KMT.
</P>
<P>
DPP lawmakers, meanwhile, warned buyers interested in any of the
KMT's assets of the risk of possible financial loss, saying most of
these assets are considered "booty" that will be subject to retrieval
by the government.

<P>
New Party Chairman Yok Mu-ming and the
party's eight legislative candidates each drew their own blood and
placed it on a Republic of China national flag Thursday to symbolize
their vow to protect the ROC.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference, Yok said that the New Party will emulate
the spirit of the martyrs who sacrificed their lives for the building
of the Republic of China nearly 100 years ago, adding that the party
calls for voters to rise up for the cause of the nation.
</P>
<P>
Yok said that the New Party will no longer sit idly by and watch
the growing independence sentiment in the country, adding that the
New Party will ally with all supporters of the ROC in the nation to
defend it to the end.
</P>
<P>
Yok claimed that the Dec. 11 legislative elections provide a
crucial opportunity for supporters of the ROC to consolidate among
themselves at a time when the Kuomintang, the major opposition party,
is still "facing difficulties to free itself from the black hole of
being a ruling party for decades, " and at a time when the "pan-blue
alliance" supporters are "bogged down in a quagmire with no
leadership in sight."
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the New Party, which split from the KMT 12 years
ago, chose to have its eight candidates run under the KMT banner in
the upcoming legislative elections in order to manifest the New
Party's determination to broaden the "pan-blue alliance's" support
base.
</P>
<P>
Yok claimed that this is also the first step in the integration
of the KMT, the People First Party and the New Party, and promised to
continue to push toward the ultimate goal of merger of the three
parties.

JUSTICE MINISTER WANTS VOTE-BUYING CASES TO BE DEALT WITH MORE QUICKLY
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Nov. 25 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Justice Minister Chen Ding-nan on Thursday
called for court cases involving vote-buying to be dealt with more
quickly, saying that "justice overdue is no justice."
</P>
<P>
Chen made the remarks after he presented a cash award of NT$5
million (US$153,840) to an informer in a vote-buying suit against
legislative candidate Wang Tao-fu in the 1995 legislative elections.
In a show of protecting the identity of the informer, Fan Wen-hao,
chief prosecutor of Tainan Prosecutor's Office, received the money on
behalf of the informer at the presentation ceremony.
</P>
<P>
According to the Executive Yuan's promulgated regulations
concerning awards for informers, an informer will receive half of the
award after the first trial in a district court in which a defendant
is convicted based on the information provided by the informer, and
will receive the other half after a final ruling by a higher court.
The cash award for informers in legislative elections graft cases is
NT$10 million.
</P>
<P>
Speaking about the graft case involving legislative candidate
Wang, Chen noted that if the case had been concluded eight years ago,
the effect would have been much greater, saying that the final ruling
handed down after a delay of nine years didn't produce the impact
that it was intended to have.
</P>
<P>
Chen urged the Judicial Yuan to step up the monitoring of graft
suits filed by prosecutors so that courts at all levels can carry out
speedy trials.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, with only three weeks left before the Dec. 11
legislative elections, prosecutors had handled 3,191 reported graft
cases as of Wednesday, the State Public Prosecutor General Wu
Ying-chao said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Of that total, 615 cases are in Tainan, showing that the
prosecutors and other law enforcement units in the southern Taiwan
city are working hard in the crackdown on vote-buying, Wu said during
an anti-vote-buying meeting with prosecutors and other law
enforcement personnel in Tainan.
</P>
<P>
Cheng Ming-shun, deputy chief of the Investigation Bureau, said
on the same occasion that judging from the information collected
over the past three weeks, vote-buying methods have shifted from
providing free trips or banquets to the distribution of cash, with
the latter form of bribery accounting for 52 percent of the reported
cases.

APEC ENVOY SAYS MAINLAND PRESIDENT FRIENDLIER THAN TAIWAN REPORTERS
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Nov.  25 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Academia Sinica President Lee Yuan-tseh
said Thursday he felt that mainland Chinese President Hu Jiantao was
"friendlier than Taiwan reporters" to him during the just-concluded
informal leadership meeting of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation
(APEC) forum in Santiago, Chile.
</P>
<P>
Lee, a co-winner of the 1986 Nobel Prize in chemistry, made the
remarks at a news conference held after briefing President Chen
Shui-bian on the results of the annual APEC summit meeting and his
personal feelings about the event.
</P>
<P>
Lee, who attended the APEC summit on Chen's behalf, said that
during the one-and-a-half-day meeting, he held talks with the top
leaders of all APEC member economies, including Hu.
</P>
<P>
As to the content of his conversation with Hu, Lee said he
conveyed Chen's goodwill toward promoting rapprochement across the
Taiwan Strait and desire to invite Beijing's top cross-strait
negotiator, Wang Daohan, to visit Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Lee acknowledged that he did not go into detail in
his talks with Hu about cross-strait issues because their meeting was
brief.
</P>
<P>
Prior to his departure for the Chilean capital, Lee said he had
repeatedly reminded local journalists that APEC is basically a
multilateral economic cooperation forum, not an avenue for political
wrangling or diplomatic maneuvering.
</P>
<P>
"However, since my arrival in Santiago, many Taiwan reporters
relentlessly questioned me about my interaction with Hu. Some
reporters' attitudes were rude. In the end, I told them that in fact,
I felt Hu's attitude toward me was friendlier than theirs, " Lee
recalled.
</P>
<P>
This was the third consecutive year that Lee has served as Chen's
proxy at the annual APEC summit meeting.
</P>
<P>
Lee said he hopes that the two sides of the Taiwan Strait can
talk after Taiwan's Dec. 11 legislative elections to mend their
differences. Cross-strait peace and stability are not only critical
to Taiwan and mainland China but also important to the world as a
whole, he added.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Lee said he looks forward to seeing Chen attend the
2005 APEC summit in person.
</P>
<P>
"Chen's attendance is of great significance as it will symbolize
progress in cross-strait relations," Lee said.
</P>
<P>
Because of Beijing's opposition, Taiwan's head of state cannot
attend the annual APEC summit in person and has to name a proxy to
attend on his behalf.
</P>
<P>
After having attended the annual APEC summit for three years in a
row, Lee said he felt many other APEC members have made tremendous
progress in various fields. In contrast, he said, the pace of
Taiwan's progress is comparatively lagging behind because of domestic
political instability and chaos.
</P>
<P>
The soft-spoken scholar said he sincerely hopes that local
political parties can stop their strife after the December
legislative elections and work together to accelerate domestic
economic development, a cultural renaissance and social stability.

Police released Thursday a picture and
filmed image of the so-called "rice bomber, " who is allegedly
responsible for more than a dozen bomb threats in Taipei over the
past year, and offered a reward of NT$500,000 (US$15,479) for
information leading to his arrest.
</P>
<P>
The portrait was sketched according to descriptions from
witnesses and images obtained from surveillance cameras, police said.
</P>
<P>
The suspect is believed to be aged between 20 and 35 and is about
168 centimeters tall, with short hair, according to police.
</P>
<P>
Anyone with information on the suspect is urged to call the
Taipei City Police Department's criminal investigation unit at

(02) 27676676 or 0931770110.
</P>
<P>
Since November last year, a man claiming to oppose the
government's policy of permitting rice imports has placed home-made
explosives in public areas such as parks, trains, railway stations
and mobile toilets in the greater Taipei area.
</P>
<P>
One of the devices exploded outside the Legislative Yuan building
in June and another outside the Ministry of Education building

TAIPEI MAYOR SAYS PERFORMANCE IN MEETING HAS NOT LET DOWN CITIZENS
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou said Thursday
that he did his best to win the priority right to host an Asian
cities conference in 2006 and that he "did not let the Taipei
citizens down."
</P>
<P>
Ma made the remarks when he was interviewed by a local radio
station after returning from a conference of the Asian Network of
Major Cities (ANMC) in Jakarta Nov. 22-24.
</P>
<P>
The mayor noted that Taipei bid to host the 2005 meeting in July,
and should have been awarded the right according to past practice,
but Beijing cut into the race simply because it did not want to see
Taipei play any significant role in the meeting. Taipei then
solicited the support of other members to win the priority right to
host the meeting the following year.
</P>
<P>
Ma pointed out that in contrast with Beijing's "barbaric and
irrational" method, Taipei displayed "friendship, cooperation, and an
attitude of measurement" to win the sympathy and support of other
members.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the member cities of the organization have always
coordinated with each other in their discussions and that "there has
never been the need to vote on the hosting issue."
</P>
<P>
But, he went on, Beijing put on an air of "having veto power" in
the meeting, so that many representatives, although having been
instructed by their governments to lend support to Beijing, did not
support Beijing due to its "overbearing" attitude.
</P>
<P>
The ANMC was founded in 2001 by Tokyo Governor Shintaro Ishihara.
It provides a forum for the mayors of major Asian cities to exchange
views on issues concerning city development. It groups Bangkok,
Beijing, Delhi, Hanoi, Jakarta, Kuala Lumpur, Manila, Seoul,
Singapore, Taipei, Tokyo and Yangon.

FRENCH, TAIWANESE SCIENTISTS TO JOINTLY DETECT QUAKES IN EAST TAIWAN
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Paris,  Nov. 24 (CNA)
(By Lo Yuan-shao and Deborah Kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Geophysicists from France and Taiwan agreed
in Paris Wednesday to step up cooperation in earthquake and active
tectonics research, beginning with the installation of more seismic
detectors off Taiwan's east coast next year.
</P>
<P>
At an award presentation ceremony, Dr. Liu Char-shine, a
professor with the Institute of Oceanography at National Taiwan
University, who is one of the two recipients of the prestigious
French-Taiwan Science Prize of 2004, said that France will help
Taiwan in efforts to monitor earthquakes by offering academic
expertise as well as undersea earthquake detecting equipment.
</P>
<P>
It is expected that the number of undersea detectors in Taiwan,
currently numbering 18, will be increased to 40 or 50 after French
research organizations, including the Institute for Sciences of the
Earth, Water and Space under the University of Montpellier II, begin
supplying Taiwan with equipment from next year, Liu said.
</P>
<P>
The beefed up equipment is expected to enhance Taiwan's
capability in earthquake detection and even earthquake prediction,
Liu added.
</P>
<P>
Also at the award presentation ceremony, Dr. Serge Lallemand, the
other winner of the 2004 French-Taiwan Science Prize, who is director
of the Research, Geophysics, Tectonics and Sedimentology Lab under
the Montpellier Institute for Sciences of the Earth, Water and Space,
said that Taiwan's geographic format is not only extraordinary but
also a living classroom for studying active tectonics.
</P>
<P>
Lallemand, who has been to Taiwan many times for research, said
he had discussions with many Taiwanese and French scientists before
deciding to choose the offshore area of eastern Taiwan as a spot to
intensify earthquake studies.
</P>
<P>
Onshore and offshore areas of eastern Taiwan have the greatest
number of recorded earthquakes around Taiwan, Lallemand said, adding
that close detection and recording of tectonic plate friction in the
area can possibly one day help seismologists to predict earthquakes.
</P>
<P>
Lallemand also said that Taiwan's educational level is relatively
high, with a good research environment, which is why he encourages
French young people to study there.
</P>
<P>
Wu Mao-kun, chairman of the Cabinet-level National Science
Council (NSC) , also attended the award ceremony and delivered a
speech in which he exhorted scientists and academics from Taiwan and
France to continue cooperating under a program jointly sponsored by
the NSC and the Institute of France to make the world a better place.
</P>
<P>
The annual French-Taiwan Science Prize was established in 1999 by
the NSC and the Institute of France, a prestigious research institute
supported by French government grants.

CRIMINOLOGIST CALLS FOR CLOSER TAIPEI-HK-BEIJING POLICE COOPERATION
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A noted Chinese-American forensic scientist
has urged police authorities in Taiwan, Hong Kong and mainland China
to cooperate closely in fighting cross-border crime without
consideration of political factors.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Henry Lee, who is currently attending an international
seminar on forensic investigation technology in Beijing, made the
appeal in an interview with the Hong Kong-based daily Wen Hui Pao.
</P>
<P>
Lee said he is happy with the close cooperation between Hong Kong
and mainland Chinese police authorities in criminal investigations.
</P>
<P>
Despite the present political stalemate across the Taiwan Strait,
Lee said, it would be very encouraging if the Hong Kong and mainland
police authorities could similarly cooperate with their Taiwan
counterparts, particularly in the arrest of fugitive criminal
suspects and convicts.
</P>
<P>
Noting that many gangsters have taken advantage of legal
loopholes to engage in cross-border criminal activities in the three
Chinese societies, Lee said the authorities should not be daunted by
political hindrances in developing cooperative ties to upgrade their
crime-fighting efficiency.
</P>
<P>
As the mainland is now in a rapidly changing stage, Lee said,
many new types of social problems and crimes have arisen in mainland
society.
</P>
<P>
"My observation is that although the quality of the mainland
Chinese police force has improved, it still needs renovation in
manpower training, " Lee said, adding that the mainland police
authorities should send more technological staff abroad for advanced
training.

RISING NEW TAIWAN DOLLAR HAS LITTLE IMPACT ON EXPORTS: MOEA
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei, Nov. 25 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Despite a continued appreciation of the new
Taiwan dollar, the government is optimistic about the prospects for
the country's exports.
</P>
<P>
Chang Yaw-tzong, director-general of the Statistics Department
under the Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA), claimed recently that
Taiwan, compared to South Korea, one of the country's major export
rivals, still enjoys an advantage in exports, as the South Korean won
has strengthened more than the new Taiwan dollar.
</P>
<P>
Chang forecast that Taiwan's outbound shipments, particularly in
the information and electronics industries, will continue to grow in
November and December and next year after the country's export order
value broke the US$20 billion mark to reach a new single-month high
of US$20.25 billion in October.
</P>
<P>
The new Taiwan dollar continued its rise Thursday, gaining
NT$0.148 to end at 32.239 against the U.S. dollar on the Taipei
foreign exchange market on a weakening greenback.
</P>
<P>
Amid anticipation that mainland China's renminbi may appreciate
early next year, a well-known Taiwan economist forecast that the
mainland currency will go up in value in the second half of next
year.
</P>
<P>
Kung Ming-hsin, a division chief at the Taiwan Institute of
Economic Research (TIER), predicted that the renminbi will strengthen
by 10 percent in the second half of 2005.
</P>
<P>
Kung contended that the timing of late this year or early next
year is not yet ripe for a renminbi appreciation, and he suggested
that members of the public hoping to take advantage of currency
exchange rates should wait a little longer.
</P>
<P>
He based his argument on the grounds that President George W.
Bush will have fully completed his personnel changes by late next
year, which will be a better time to discuss the renminbi's exchange
rate issue with Beijing.
</P>
<P>
According to Kung, mainland China has a 35 percent growth rate in
exports at present and will still enjoy double-digit expansion even
if its currency picks up in value by 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
Mainland President Hu Jintao revealed in the recent informal
leaders' summit of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum in
Santiago, Chile, that Beijing intends to depeg the renminbi's
decade-old peg to the U.S. dollar under stable economic conditions.
</P>
<P>
Hu's comments have prompted public speculation on a stronger
renminbi and many people are planning to convert their holdings in
other currencies into the mainland unit to make profits on the
exchange rate.
</P>
<P>
But a stronger renminbi will have a bigger impact on Taiwan-made
goods, as the mainland is Taiwan's largest manufacturing base and a
majority of Taiwan companies operating there are export-oriented. An
appreciating renminbi will make products made by Taiwan companies
less competitive in other countries.
</P>
<P>
Far East Group Chairman Douglas Hsu said that the currency
exchange rate issue alone should not affect the export business at
the moment, but it is a risk that it should be taken into account for
the future.
</P>
<P>
He said that the mainland authorities are expected to loosen the
floating range for the renminbi, but added that a large jump in value
might not be very likely in the short term.

DPP OPTIMISTIC ABOUT WINNING MAJORITY IN LEGISLATIVE ELECTIONS
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Nov.  25 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The ruling Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) is optimistic about winning a majority in the Dec. 11
legislative elections, which it believes is vital for Taiwan's
stability, DPP Secretary-General Chang Chun-hsiung said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the Madrid-based El Paise newspaper, Chang
said the ruling party's control of the legislature will improve the
government's efficiency, which will in turn serve the best interests
of the nation.
</P>
<P>
As to opposition claims that President Chen Shui-bian won his
re-election through trickery, Chang pointed out that the Taiwan High
Court, which heard the opposition's complaints, has cleared Chen of
the accusation and has confirmed that Chen won the election by a
margin of 25,536 votes.
</P>
<P>
Chang also explained Chen's idea of rewriting a constitution for
the country, saying that the existing Constitution was formulated by
the Republic of China in Nanjing in 1947, under a political situation
quite different from that of Taiwan, and that therefore the president
called for a referendum on the creation of a new constitution better
suited to today's reality.
</P>
<P>
The DPP secretary-general also raised the country's bid to enter
the United Nations, saying that Taiwan's bid is in tune with the
U.N.'s purpose of giving representation to all people around the
world.
</P>
<P>
In another development, Chang rebutted insinuations by opposition
Kuomintang Chairman Lien Chan that the judicial system, including the
court, is controlled by the DPP, saying that the Taiwan High Court's
judgment to throw out the opposition parties' claims that the
presidential elections were flawed numbers almost 400 pages. "Which
court would go into such detail in overthrowing a complaint?" he
asked rhetorically.
</P>
<P>
Lien insulted the judges presiding over the trial by suggesting
that they are manipulated by the DPP, he said.
</P>
<P>
Chang's optimism about a DPP victory in the legislative elections
was shared by President Chen Shui-bian's chief of staff Su
Tseng-chang, who told journalists while canvassing votes for DPP
candidates in Chiayi that the DPP is expected to win 101 seats and
will command over half of the 225 seats in legislature after
combining forces with its political ally, the Taiwan Solidarity
Union.

A government plan to open renminbi exchange
in Kinmen and Matsu on a trial basis is based on the future needs and
development of the frontline islands, Mainland Affairs Council Vice
Chairman Chiu Tai-san said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Chiu said the government started to study the plan a few months

the islands and the mainland ports of Fuzhou and Xiamen.
</P>
<P>
Chiu said the Central Bank of China and the Financial Supervisory

</P>
<P>
Despite the lack of a currency settlement system between Taiwan
and the mainland, several domestic banks with branches on Kinmen and
Matsu, including the Bank of Taiwan and the Land Bank, have expressed
an interest in operating renminbi exchange services, Chiu pointed
out.
</P>
<P>
Chiu said the Executive Yuan will announce the date for the
launch of the trial program after it has finalized all the relevant

Visa processing for visitors from the
Philippines, Thailand, Vietnam, Indonesia and India are to be
simplified, a spokesman for the Tourism Bureau said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
According to the spokesman, the Cabinet's Tourism Promotion
Commission (TPC) passed the Ministry of Foreign Affairs
(MOFA) -initiated proposal to simplify visa processing for applicants
from the five Asian countries at a meeting held earlier in the day.
</P>
<P>
Hereafter, the spokesman said, visa applications by citizens from

applicants meet all the stated requirements.
</P>
<P>
If those applicants hold visas from the United States, Canada,
Japan, Australia or New Zealand, they will be exempt from producing
papers proving their financial and employment status.
Wealthy ethnic Chinese in those countries or wealthy retirees in
those countries will be offered similar treatment.
</P>
<P>
To encourage citizens from these countries to conduct group tours
in Taiwan, the spokesman said, visa fees for groups of eight or more
visitors will be halved.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the MOFA will issue group visas to ethnic Chinese
residing in the Bangkok area who hold a "Travel Document For Aliens"
issued by the Thai government, so that they can make group visits to
Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
The MOFA will also issue one-year multiple-entry visas for
Indian citizens who have been to Taiwan twice.
</P>
<P>
"These measures are aimed at attracting more foreign tourists to
Taiwan to realize the government's goal of doubling the annual number
of tourist arrivals to 5 million by 2008," the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Vice Premier Yeh Chu-lan presided over Thursday's TPC meeting and
urged the Tourism Bureau to take advantage of the imminent resumption
of direct air links between Taiwan and South Korea to launch various

committee, said that even though the opposition Kuomintang-produced
video contains defamatory slogans against the CEC, the commission
still agreed to its broadcast on local terrestrial television
channels based on the principle of freedom of speech.
</P>
<P>
Chi said the CEC screened the campaign videos in line with the
principles of objectivity, impartiality, neutrality and legality.
</P>
<P>
Besides the KMT's video, Chi said, the CEC also approved the
campaign videos presented by four other parties -- the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party, the People First Party, the Taiwan
Solidarity Union and the Non-Partisan Solidarity Union.
</P>
<P>
The campaign videos will be broadcast on the nation's five
terrestrial television channels -- Taiwan Television Enterprise,
China Television Co., Chinese Television System, Public Television
Service and Formosa Television -- from Dec. 6.
</P>
<P>
According to Chi, the KMT video contains slogans such as "the
Central Election Commission violates the law, is not impartial and
not fair" and "Chen Shui-bian used illegal means to gain power."
</P>
<P>
As those words do not definitely violate Article 54 of the Public
Functionary Election and Recall Law or Articles 21 and 22 of the
Radio Broadcasting and Television Law, Chi said, the CEC's screening
panel gave the green light to the video.

New York Times: Two top officials are
reported to quit C.I.A.

Two more senior officials of the Central Intelligence Agency's
clandestine service are stepping down, intelligence officials said
Wednesday, in the latest sign of upheaval in the agency under its new
chief, Porter J. Goss. As the chiefs of the Europe and Far East
divisions, the two officials have headed spying operations in some of
the most important regions of the world and were among a group known
as the barons in the highest level of clandestine service, the
Directorate of Operations.

World Street Journal: Ukraine opposition prepares for nationwide
protest strike.

Backed by thousands of protesters who spent a fourth night
outside in the bitter cold, Ukrainian opposition leaders on Thursday
prepared for a nationwide strike to protest authorities' decision to
declare Prime Minister Viktor Yanukovych winner of a presidential
election amid allegations of vote rigging. The West-leaning reformist
candidate Viktor Yushchenko and his allies have called for an
"all-Ukrainian political strike" after election officials on
Wednesday declared the Kremlin- backed Yanukovych the winner of a
bitterly disputed runoff ballot denounced by Western observers as
fraudulent.

TALKS OVER COMPENSATION FOR AMORGOS DAMAGE BREAK DOWN
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Nov. 25 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Negotiations over compensation for damage
to Taiwan's ecology and to the government's tax revenues caused by a
Greek-registered cargo ship have broken down, the Environmental
Protection Administration (EPA) said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The EPA was referring to a lawsuit it has filed with a Norwegian
court against a Norway-based insurance firm over damage caused the MV
Amorgos to coastal areas of the Kenting National Park in southern
Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
The Norwegian court dealt with the case from Nov. 1-18, EPA
officials said. In the first four days, lawyers from both sides
explained their stances. In the second stage from Nov.
5-16, representatives and expert witnesses further explained
these stances and conducted cross-questioning. In the final
two days from Nov. 17-18, lawyers conducted final debates.
</P>
<P>
EPA officials said the defendant disagreed that it should pay any
more compensation apart for the US$8.4 million it has already paid to
Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
The EPA demanded total compensation of NT$350 million (about
US$10.84 million).
</P>
<P>
"This means that the two parties failed to come to terms on the
compensation amount and negotiations broke down, " said Lu
Hung-kuang, an EPA department chief.
</P>
<P>
The Norwegian court has yet to hand down its judgment, Lu said,
adding that this is just the first trial. After the court hands down
its verdict, both the defendant and the plaintiff can appeal the case
to a higher court.
</P>
<P>
On Jan. 14, 2001, the Amorgos, on its way from Indonesia to
mainland China, ran aground near Kenting National Park in Pingtung
County due to bad weather. A large amount of fuel oil aboard the
freighter leaked into the surrounding waters and contaminated some
7,000 square meters of the coastal area within the Lungkeng
Ecological Reserve.
</P>
<P>
According to EPA estimates, the Amorgos oil slick caused a total
of NT$350 million in financial losses to Taiwan, including NT$90
million in tax revenues and economic losses, NT$240 million in damage
to fishery and coral resources and the costs needed for
rehabilitation, as well as NT$18 million in ecology monitoring costs.

BEIJING'S INCREASING MILITARY BUILDUP THREATENS REGIONAL STABILITY
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei, Nov. 25 (CNA)
(By Huang Kwang-chun)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Beijing's increasing military buildup poses
a threat to the stability of the Asia-Pacific region, an aide to
President Chen Shui-bian said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
James Huang, deputy secretary-general of the Presidential Office,
said that countries in the region should pay more attention to the
threat created by the expansion of mainland China's military forces
to regional balance and stability because it is not a problem for
just one country but a common issue affecting the whole region.
</P>
<P>
Huang made the remarks when commenting on reports that both
Japanese Vice Foreign Minister Ichiro Aisawa and Vice Minister of
Defense Agency Hiroshi Imazu denied that Taiwan provided the Japanese
authorities with information on a recent intrusion of a mainland
Chinese submarine into Japan's territorial waters.
</P>
<P>
Huang said it is regrettable that the Japanese officials issued
the denial. However, he added, Taiwan will continue to do its best to
maintain the Asia-Pacific region's stability and security.
</P>
<P>
A mainland nuclear submarine intruded into Japan's territorial
waters Nov. 10 for which the Beijing authorities apologized to Japan
Nov. 16.
</P>
<P>
In a meeting with Japan's Interchange Association President
Reijiro Hattori last Friday in Taipei, President Chen told his guest
that Taiwan provided Japan and the United States with intelligence
about the intrusion.

TAIWAN TARGETS FOREIGN STUDENTS, INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCES

<TEXT>
<P>
A panel under the Executive Yuan decided
Thursday to target young foreign students and international
conferences in its effort to attract foreign tourists to Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
In order to do so, the panel for developing and promoting tourism
charged Cheng Li-chiun, chairwoman of the National Youth Commission,
with soliciting foreign students and Vice Minister of Economic
Affairs Shih Yen-shiang with selling Taiwan as an ideal venue for
international conferences.
</P>
<P>
The panel also decided to bid to host the 2006 World Youth and
Student Travel Conference.
</P>
<P>
Su Cheng-tien, director-general of the Tourism Bureau under the
Ministry of Transportation and Communications, told the panel that
young students accounted for 20 percent of the world's tourists in
2002 and is expected to make up a 25 percent share in
2005.
</P>
<P>
By hosting the 2006 World Youth and Student Travel Conference, Su
said, Taiwan will get the chance to showcase its hospitality to young
people around the world and therefore encourage them to visit the
nation.
</P>
<P>
Hosting other international conferences will have a similar
effect on local tourism, Su said.
</P>
<P>
Tourism Bureau statistics show that 2.4 million foreign travelers
arrived in Taiwan in the first ten months of this year, which
represents a 36.4 percent growth over the same period of 2003 but a
minus 1.38 percent growth from 2002.
</P>
<P>
The bureau ascribed the poorer-than-hoped-for performance to
"outbreaks of avian flu in the first and second quarters of this
year."
</P>
<P>
However, the bureau went on, the number of foreign visitors grew
by 3.19 percent in October compared to the same period of 2001 and is
on track to fulfilling the whole year's goal of having 2.9 million
visitors.

SPECIAL GRADUATE COURSES PLANNED TO PROVIDE HI-TECH WORKERS
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Nov.  25 (CNA)
(By Flor  Wang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
To meet the country's strong demand for
hi-tech manpower, the government is planning to launch special
graduate courses to help provide domestic industry with skilled
hi-tech professionals, a government official said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Economic Affairs Ho Mei-yueh made the announcement at
a forum sponsored by the Industrial Technology Research Institute on
ways to foster well-trained manpower for Taiwan's key high tech
industries. Scores of representatives from government agencies,
research institutes and universities took part in the forum.
</P>
<P>
Stressing that human resources are vital to Taiwan's industrial
upgrading, Ho acknowledged that the gap between supply and demand in
the domestic job market has been widening. She said that Taiwan
industry is keen, in particular, on luring fresh masters degree and
doctorate graduates from local post-graduate schools.
</P>
<P>
In an effort to help Taiwan-based businesses recruit sufficient
hi-tech workforce, the government is planning to finance special
graduate courses at universities in conjunction with demand from
different sectors according to their needs, she said.
</P>
<P>
Under the terms of the program, cooperating enterprises will have
to hire at least 70 percent of the graduates, while the Ministry of
Economic Affairs and the companies will jointly raise the funds for
the courses, she explained, adding that recruitment of candidates is
slated to begin soon.
</P>
<P>
For the time being, the program aims to train 5,000 qualified
workers in three years for the companies involved in the project, she
said.
</P>
<P>
In addition, she went on, the government will offer better
scholarships to attract foreigners to study and develop their careers
in Taiwan while considering how to provide greater access for
immigrants with technology expertise.
</P>
<P>
The government is poised to do its best to educate and train a
hi-tech workforce and keep them at home amid fierce foreign
competition, she said, pointing to Singapore as an example, which she
said has claimed to lure 3,000 talented professionals from Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on the same occasion, Industrial Technology Research
Institute President Johnsee Lee pointed out that Taiwan will face a
shortage in experienced hi-tech workforce supply of about 13,900
through the period ending in 2006, mainly in the biotech, nanotech,
semiconductor, display, digital-content and telecommunications
sectors.

JUDGMENT IN PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION CASE TO BE HANDED DOWN DEC. 30
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  Nov.  25 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A lawsuit seeking to annul the March 20
presidential election went through its last oral proceeding Thursday
and the Taiwan High Court set a date of Dec. 30 to hand down its
judgment.
</P>
<P>
The suit brought by the defeated presidential candidate,
opposition Kuomintang Chairman Lien Chan and his running mate, People
First Party Chairman James Soong, asked the court to throw out the
election on the grounds that it was flawed and unfair.
</P>
<P>
Attorneys for Lien and Soong argued in Friday's hearing that
President Chen Shui-bian, who won the election by a slim margin, held
a referendum alongside the election in a move designed to boost his
campaign, which skewed the election outcome in his favor.
</P>
<P>
They also claimed that the Central Election Commission (CEC)
failed to carry out the election properly, citing what they described
as "mistakes" as evidence.
</P>
<P>
Attorneys for the CEC defended the validity of the election on
the grounds that the errors, committed unwittingly by CEC workers,
did not reverse the final results and should not make the election
null and void.
</P>
<P>
The lawsuit is one of two cases brought by Lien and Soong. The
other, in which Lien and Soong asked the court to invalidate Chen's
election on the same grounds, was turned down by the Taiwan High
Court Nov. 4. Lien and Soong have appealed against that ruling.

<TEXT>
<P>
President Chen Shui-bian said on Friday
that Taiwan has adopted a flexible and pragmatic air transportation
policy.
</P>
<P>
The president made the comments while addressing the opening of
the 48th Association of Asia Pacific Airlines (AAPA) Assembly of
Presidents in Taipei. The assembly is being sponsored by China
Airlines, Taiwan's largest civil air carrier.
</P>
<P>
The president noted that civil aviation is a high-tech
transportation industry. Faced with a new situation after joining the
World Trade Organization Jan. 1, 2002, Taiwan has actively worked to
improve its airport facilities, navigation equipment and outbound
traffic connection systems to upgrade service quality, he said.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan has also made an overall review and adjustment of the
ratio of various airport fees, established an airline assessment
system, reviewed and revised related regulations, and actively
engaged in exchanges with other nations and international
organizations, shaping a flexible and pragmatic air transportation
policy, the president said.
</P>
<P>
Chen also affirmed the AAPA's contribution to the regional
aviation industry, noting that compared with the performance of
airlines in other areas, the AAPA can be proud of itself. He added
that at a time when the global aviation industry has been affected by
economic slump, the airlines in the Asia-Pacific region have
continued to provide high-quality service and to make satisfactory
profits.
</P>
<P>
The AAPA currently groups 17 major airlines, including Taiwan's
China Airlines and EVA Airways, in the Asia-Pacific region. The
AAPA Assembly of Presidents is sponsored each year by member airlines
on a rotational basis, providing a forum for the airline leaders to
exchange views on the aviation industry's prospects.
</P>
<P>
The last such meeting in Taipei took place in 1989, with China
Airlines also sponsoring that gathering.
</P>
<P>
Major topics to be discussed at this year's assembly include new
developments in U.S. aviation policy, rising world crude oil prices,
risk hedging strategies, premiums and war risk, as well as the
emergence of budget airlines.

TSU TO SEEK LAW AMENDMENTS TO DENY MAINLAND SPOUSES CITIZENSHIP

<P>
The Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU) will push
to amend the existing laws governing cross-strait relations in order
to deny citizenship to mainland Chinese people married to Taiwan
citizens out of national security considerations, the TSU party whip
in the Legislative Yuan said Friday.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference, TSU lawmaker Chen Chien-ming said that
according to existing laws, mainland Chinese spouses of Taiwan
citizens can serve in government organizations and have the right to
vote in Taiwan, which he claimed could eventually allow mainland
Chinese authorities to exert influence on Taiwan's politics.
</P>
<P>
Chen said the TSU will seek amendments to the existing laws so
that mainland spouses of Republic of China nationals can only be
granted residency, instead of full ROC citizenship.
</P>
<P>
He said that according to government tallies, the number of
mainland Chinese-Taiwan married couples totaled roughly 190,000 as of
the end of 2003.
</P>
<P>
The lawmaker claimed that if all these mainland spouse obtain
full ROC citizenship, which entitles them to vote in Taiwan elections
and even to run for public office, Beijing could possibly use their
political weight to influence Taiwan's domestic affairs.
</P>
<P>
Noting that many Western countries, including the United States
and Canada, have laws explicitly banning the entrance of people from
"enemy" or "hostile" countries, Chen claimed that Taiwan's laws
allowing mainlanders to enter and work in the country are tantamount
to "tossing the nation's sovereignty down the drain."
</P>
<P>
Considering the fact that Beijing continues to deploy ballistic
missiles targeting Taiwan and to refuse to renounce the option of
force to settle cross-strait differences, Chen said, Taiwan should
only grant mainland spouses residency, which he said allows them
access to many privileges, including work permits and national health
insurance, instead of granting them full citizenship.

</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Nov.  26 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Control Yuan, the nation's supreme
watchdog body, said Friday it impeached a total of 48 public
officials in the first 10 months of this year, with officials from
the Ministry of National Defense (MND) accounting for the lion's
share.
</P>
<P>
Ku Teng-mei, a Control Yuan member, made the remarks during an
inspection tour of the Executive Yuan along with her colleagues.
</P>
<P>
Quoting constitutional provisions, Ku said the Control Yuan is
authorized to censure and impeach local and central government-level
public officials as well as to rectify administrative agencies under
the Executive Yuan.
</P>
<P>
In 2004, Ku said, similar administrative problems involving
public security, the 921 earthquake-related reconstruction projects,
mudslides and sewerage engineering, occurred repeatedly.
</P>
<P>
"We hope the relevant administrative departments can make efforts
at resolving these problems once and for all, " Ku said during a
meeting with Cabinet members.
</P>
<P>
"Some of the problems involve different departments, and we hope
the Executive Yuan can coordinate and integrate the resources of
different agencies to facilitate the solving of relevant problems, "
she added.
</P>
<P>
Among the public officials impeached between January and October,
14 were from the MND, five from the Ministry of Transportation and
Communications (MOTC), and four from the Council of Labor Affairs.
</P>
<P>
During the 10-month period, the Control Yuan decided in a total
of 130 cases to ectify various government agencies' administrative
measures.
</P>
<P>
From February 1999 to October 2004, 300 public officials were
impeached, with 80 coming from the MND, 38 from the Ministry of
Economic Affairs, 24 from the MOTC, 23 from the Ministry of the
Interior and 21 from the Ministry of the Justice.
</P>
<P>
During the same period, the Control Yuan decided in a total of
947 cases to rectify various government agencies' administrative
measures.
</P>
<P>
The six-year tenure of the incumbent Control Yuan members will
expire Jan. 31, 2005.

POLICE IDENTIFY 'RICE BOMBER' VIA DNA TESTS
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei, Nov. 26 (CNA)
(By Y.F. Low)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Police said Friday a man who turned himself
in a day earlier is very likely the "rice bomber" responsible for
more than a dozen bomb threats in Taipei over the past year.
</P>
<P>
Hsieh Ing-dan, director-general of the National Police Agency,
said test results show that the physical DNA specimens of the
suspect, Yang Ju-men, match with most specimens collected from the
evidence left at the crime scenes.
</P>
<P>
However, Hsieh said prosecutors will need to conduct further
investigations before the case can be announced as "resolved."
</P>
<P>
Since Nov. 13 last year, a man claiming to oppose the
government's policy of permitting rice imports has placed home-made
explosives in public areas such as parks, trains, railway stations
and mobile toilets.
</P>
<P>
One of the devices exploded outside the Legislative Yuan building
in June and another outside the Ministry of Education building
earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
Yang turned himself in to police in the company of his brother on
Thursday, the same day police released a picture and filmed image of
the alleged "rice bomber" and offered a reward of NT$500,000
(US$15,479) for information leading to his arrest.
</P>
<P>
But Yang later denied he was involved in those cases during
questioning by police.
</P>
<P>
According to Taipei district prosecutor Cheng Ke-sheng, Yang is
"highly connected" with 11 of the 16 cases that allegedly were
committed by the "rice bomber" as shown by the DNA tests.
</P>
<P>
Police also found some suspected sketches of threat letters,
timers and unidentified powder after a search at his residence.
</P>
<P>
Yang, 26, sells chickens in Keelung. He received blast training
while serving in the marine corps, police said.
</P>
<P>
According to law, a person can be sentenced to death if convicted
of making explosives without permission.

Ukraine's Supreme Courton Thursday temporarily blocked the
victory of Prime Minister Viktor F. Yanukovich in the disputed
presidential election, barring publication of the Central Election
Commission's results until the court reviews complaints of widespread
fraud and abuse. When the losing candidate, Viktor A. Yushchenko,
said to the thousands of demonstrators that complaints of election
abuse would be heard in court, the demonstrators erupted in cheers.

Ukraine's Supreme Court suspended certification of the results of

move left the announced winner, Prime Minister Viktor Yanukovych,
unable to formally take office at least until the appeal is decided.
Yanukovych was declared the winner of Sunday's runoff election by a

ONLY 3% OF KMT'S 'ILL-GOTTEN' ASSETS RETURNED TO NATION: LAWYER
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Nov.  26 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Only three percent of the opposition
Kuomintang's (KMT's) "ill-gotten" assets acquired over five decades
in power have been returned to the nation, while some three-quarters
have been transferred to "third party" private individuals,
government-hired lawyers said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Lin Yong-sung, chief attorney of a group of legal counselors that
has been enlisted by the Executive Yuan for probes into the KMT's
"ill-gotten" assets, said the land that the KMT and its affiliated
organizations had owned totaled 254,637 square feet, with a value of
over NT$20.9 billion (US$649 million).
</P>
<P>
Of that total, three percent has been relinquished by the KMT and
returned to the national coffers; 18 percent is still under the
ownership of the KMT or its affiliates; 75 percent has been
transferred to "third party" private individuals; and two percent is
state-owned land that has been used by the KMT without payments, Lin
noted.
</P>
<P>
Premier Yu Shyi-kun said last month that the Executive Yuan will
retrieve the KMT-held assets which he claimed were "robbed" from the
people. "The government cannot tolerate this kind of exploitation and
will make every effort to retrieve the 'booty, '" Yu also said at the
time.
</P>
<P>
Lin said that the Executive Yuan will via legal process try to
have the KMT make full reimbursement to the nation for the 75 percent
of the assets that it has already sold, as well as pay 5 percent in
interest charges.
</P>
<P>
The KMT "booty" includes land and buildings that were used during
the Japanese-colonial era, land and buildings that the Taiwan
Provincial Government handed out when it was disbanded, and land and
buildings that were required by the government for public use when
the KMT was still in power, Lin added.
</P>
<P>
The Kuomintang announced last December that it was relinquishing
ownership of two major buildings and seven movie theaters in Taipei
City as part of efforts to clear its name in the wake of a spate of
criticism of the party for "embezzling" national assets.
</P>
<P>
Chang Che-sen, director-general of the KMT Administration
Management Committee, claimed that most of the party's assets -- many
of which are described by party rivals as "ill-gotten assets" -- are
"a historical legacy" that have made significant contributions to the
country.
</P>
<P>
However, despite reluctance, the KMT has since last year
continued to give up these assets and return property to the original
"donors," Chang said.
</P>
<P>
According to Chang, KMT Chairman Lien Chan announced in September
2002 that the party would undertake a sweeping consignment of party
assets back to their former owners in an effort to recuperate some of
the former ruling party's image and dignity.
</P>
<P>
Lien said that a total of 120 land lots and 42 buildings would be
returned to their former owners, mostly local governments around the
island that gave the property to the KMT as donations in the years
when the KMT was in power.
</P>
<P>
As of August 2003, according to Chang, 120 out of the 165 land
lots that the KMT had been using had been returned to their original
donors, constituting a completion rate of over 80 percent.

DENYING M'LAND SPOUSES CITIZENSHIP WOULD VIOLATE HUMAN RIGHTS: KMT
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei, Nov. 26 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The idea of denying citizenship to mainland
Chinese spouses of local residents runs counter to the notion of
human rights protection, a group of legislators from the opposition
Kuomintang (KMT) said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The KMT lawmakers were criticizing an announcement by the Taiwan
Solidarity Union (TSU) earlier the same day that it would push to
amend the existing laws governing cross-strait relations in order to
deny citizenship to mainland Chinese people married to Taiwan
citizens out of national security considerations. The KMT legislators
called the TSU initiative "an infringement of human rights."
</P>
<P>
KMT Legislator Chiang Yi-wen asked whether Taiwan could still be
considered a democratic country if the legislature were indeed to
amend the relevant laws to deny mainland spouses full citizenship.
</P>
<P>
"If lawmakers harbor hostility toward certain groups of people,
then marginalization and hatred will prevail in Taiwan society, "
Chiang claimed.
</P>
<P>
He added that an individual's rights protected by the Republic of
China's law or the ROC Constitution should not be infringed upon for
political reasons.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, KMT Legislator Chu Fong-chi pointed out that Taiwan
must emulate advanced Western countries in the treatment of so-called
"new immigrants."
</P>
<P>
Chu urged legislators as well as government workers to be
broad-minded toward the nation's new citizens. "So long as the new
immigrants recognize Taiwan as their new home, we should welcome them
with open arms," he added.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference earlier in the day, TSU party whip Chen
Chien-ming said that according to existing laws, mainland Chinese
spouses of Taiwan citizens can serve in government organizations and
have the right to vote in Taiwan, which he claimed could eventually
allow mainland Chinese authorities to exert influence on Taiwan's
politics.
</P>
<P>
Chen said the TSU will seek amendments to the existing laws so
that mainland spouses of ROC nationals can only be granted residency,
instead of full ROC citizenship.
</P>
<P>
He said that according to government tallies, the number of
mainland Chinese-Taiwan married couples totaled roughly 190,000 as of
the end of 2003.
</P>
<P>
The lawmaker claimed that if all these mainland spouse obtain
full ROC citizenship, which entitles them to vote in Taiwan elections
and even to run for public office, Beijing could possibly use their
political weight to influence Taiwan's domestic affairs.
</P>
<P>
Noting that many Western countries, including the United States
and Canada, have laws explicitly banning the entrance of people from
"enemy" or "hostile" countries, Chen claimed that Taiwan's laws
allowing mainlanders to enter and work in the country are tantamount
to "tossing the nation's sovereignty down the drain."
</P>
<P>
Considering the fact that Beijing continues to deploy ballistic
missiles targeting Taiwan and to refuse to renounce the option of
force to settle cross-strait differences, Chen said, Taiwan should
only grant mainland spouses residency, which he said allows them
access to many privileges, including work permits and national health
insurance, instead of granting them full citizenship.

The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) will
study and work pragmatically to materialize President Chen
Shui-bian's idea of Taiwan seeking to enter the United Nations under
the name of "Taiwan," a MOFA spokesman said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Michel Lu said that Taiwan has tried over the past 12 years to
enter the U.N. with the title of "Republic of China, " but this has
not been met favorably by the international community.
</P>
<P>
Lu said that Chen's advocacy is not only an effort to safeguard
the interests of Taiwan's people, but also makes known Taiwan's
resolve to take part in international organizations and related
activities.
</P>
<P>
Chen said during a campaign rally a day earlier that Taiwan
should make its bid to join the U.N. using the name "Taiwan" rather
than "Republic of China."
</P>
<P>
He also promised that he would lead Taiwan to become one of the
members of the World Health Assembly (WHA) within two years, saying
that Taiwan is a sovereign nation of 23 million people whose rights
and interests cannot be excluded from international society.
</P>

Lu said MOFA will made further studies of the feasibility of
Taiwan's U.N. and WHA bids and will readjust strategies to facilitate
the bids at the earliest possible date.

COA TO MONITOR BIGEYE TUNA FISHING IN ATLANTIC
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Nov.  26 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Council of Agriculture (COA) said
Friday that next year will be critical to Taiwan's fishing industry
because of serious concern in the international community about
Taiwan's overfishing of bigeye tuna in the Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
James Sha, deputy director-general of COA's Fishery
Administration, said that the government will adopt clear and
effective improvement measures to address the issue.
</P>
<P>
The measures will include the continuation of a monitoring system
for Taiwan fishing boats, random checks at overseas harbors or final
destination harbors, rigorous screening of fish hauls, ensuring that
long-fin tuna vessels have not fished for bigeye tuna, ensuring that
bigeye tuna fishing vessels report their hauls every month to make
sure they have not exceeded their quotas and close cooperation with
other nations to apprehend poachers.
</P>
<P>
Sha said that the vessels must also exercise strenuous
self-discipline and should not take chances, adding that if
violations are detected, the fishery administration will deal with
them severely, to the extent of revoking operating licenses.
</P>
<P>
In the recently concluded International Commission for the
Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT) meeting, Japan and several
other nations accused Taiwan vessels of poaching and the U.S.
delegation demanded talks with Taiwan and Japan.
</P>
<P>
The Taiwan delegation admitted that there could be "isolated
cases" of poaching, but claimed the practice is not widespread,
saying that the scale of the illegal activity in the Atlantic totaled
4,000 tons at most and not the 20,000 tons claimed by Japan.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan promised that it will strengthen management and deduct the
overfishing quota annually and the ICCAT agreed to give Taiwan one
year of probation and continue to give it a quota until a review next
year. If there is still no significant improvement in violations,
Taiwan's qualification to fish in the Atlantic will be revoked, and
it will also face the serious consequences of trade sanctions.
</P>
<P>
Fishery officials said that the international community has
demanded that Taiwan cut its fishing fleet and the government is now
mapping out a plan to cut 50 ships within five years.

Taiwan's animation industry could learn
from Japan and South Korea -- some of whose animation products tell
profound and dramatic stories -- to sharpen its competitiveness in

</P>
<P>
Huang Kuo-chun, director of the digital content industry
promotion office under the Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) and
deputy chief executive of the quasi-official Institute for

Japanese animation businesses that Taiwan's digital creations,
including video games and animation films, display innovatory scenes
lack drama.
</P>
<P>
Forging cooperative relations with Japanese animation creators,
whose products have already successfully made inroads into world

he said.
</P>

Representatives of well-known animation businesses from Japan,
including Shogakukan Inc., Milky Cartoon Co. Ltd., NTT Data Contents
Planning Corporation, GONZO and Japan Digital Contents Inc., attended
the one-day workshop in Taipei in the hope of forging cooperative
ties with Taiwanese companies in the animation sector.

TAIWAN REGRETS JAPAN'S DENIAL OF SUB INTELLIGENCE OFFER
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei, Nov. 26 (CNA)
(By Y.F. Low)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The government expressed regret Friday that
Japan denied Taiwan's claim that it provided Tokyo with intelligence
about the intrusion of a mainland Chinese nuclear-powered submarine
into Japanese waters earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
Su Tseng-chang, secretary-general of the Presidential Office,
said it is regrettable that Japan issued the denial.
</P>
<P>
Su said Taiwan and Japan should cooperate to maintain regional
security in the face of mainland China's military buildup and
intrusion into the territorial waters of other countries.
</P>
<P>
The mainland nuclear-powered submarine intruded into Japanese
territorial waters Nov. 10, for which the Beijing authorities
apologized to Japan Nov. 16.
</P>
<P>
During a meeting with Japanese Interchange Association President
Reijiro Hattori Nov. 19, President Chen Shui-bian said that Taiwan
was the first to detect the intrusion and that it alerted Japan and
the United States to the matter.
</P>
<P>
However, officials from Japan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs and
Defense Agendy denied Thursday that was the case.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesman Michel Lu said
Japan's handling of the case was understandable yet regrettable and
was probably the result of orders from the mainland.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, opposition Kuomintang (KMT) spokesman Chang Jung-kung
claimed that Japan's denial has done "serious harm" to Taiwan and he
asked President Chen to give the people an explanation to protect the
national dignity.
</P>
<P>
Questioning Chen's credibility, Chang also claimed that it was
also unlikely that Japan, which is equipped with the latest
anti-submarine frigates, would have missed the mainland submarine.

Among the candidates, 107 were self-recommended, 63 were
recommended by professional or social groups and 18 are incumbent
ombudsmen who have expressed interest in serving another six-year
term in the Control Yuan, the nation's supreme watchdog body, Lu
said, adding that the candidates include 170 males and 18 females.
</P>
<P>
The new ombudsmen recommendation panel, headed by Lu, began to
accept reference letters Nov. 5 and stopped accepting referrals Nov.
24.
</P>
<P>
Judging from the number of recommendation letters received during
the period, Lu said, Control Yuan seats are still held in high
esteem.
</P>
<P>
Lu said the recommendation panel will screen all reference
letters in two stages. In the preliminary stage, 60 candidates will
be selected from among the 188 hopefuls. In the second phase, 40
candidates will be chosen from the 60 short-listed names.
</P>
<P>
The list of 40 finalists will then be presented to President Chen
Shui-bian for his reference in nominating candidates for Control Yuan
seats, Lu said, adding that Chen is expected to nominate candidates
for 27 Control Yuan seats, as well as for the Control Yuan presidency
and vice presidency, by mid-December.
</P>
<P>
According to the present version of the Additional Articles of
the Constitution, nominations for the Control Yuan require the
consent of the Legislative Yuan. The present legislature is expected
to vote on the nominations before its term expires Jan. 31, 2005.
</P>
<P>
Lu said the recommendation panel will abide by the principles of
openness, impartiality and fairness in choosing the finalists.
</P>
<P>
Neither the Presidential Office nor the Executive Yuan have
recommended anyone, Lu stressed, adding that the president himself
has also not made any recommendations.
</P>
<P>
During the news conference, Lu displayed a recommendation letter
from the ruling Democratic Progressive Party's (DPP's) legislative
caucus suggesting that incumbent Legislative Yuan President Wang
Jin-pyng be named the next Control Yuan head.
</P>
<P>
However, Lu said, the recommendation panel will not deal with the
DPP recommendation because it is the president's right to decide
candidates for the Control Yuan presidency and vice presidency.
</P>
<P>
Wang, a vice chairman of the opposition Kuomintang, is seeking
re-election in the Dec. 11 legislative elections and has publicly
dismissed the DPP recommendation as an ill-motivated "joke." He said
he has no interest in the top Control Yuan post.
</P>
<P>
According to Lu, the recommended hopefuls include incumbent and
former elected representatives as well as retired officials, private
business executives, literary celebrities, artists, accountants,
medical doctors and elite members from other professional fields.
</P>
<P>
"Among the hopefuls are many former officials and elected
representatives from the opposition 'pan-blue alliance' of the KMT
and the People First Party," Lu added.
</P>
<P>
Members of the recommendation panel include incumbent Control
Yuan President Fredrick Chien and Presidential Office
Secretary-General Su Tseng-chang, as well as Chang Chien-pang, a
senior adviser to the president, Hsiao Hsin-huang, a national policy
adviser to the president, and Nita Ing, chairwoman of the Taiwan
High-Speed Railway Co., who is also an adviser to the president.
Chien has made clear that he will retire from public service after
his current tenure expires.
</P>
<P>
The new Control Yuan members will assume office Feb. 1, 2005.

REVISED DRAFT OF REFERENDUM LAW SEEKS TO LOWER THRESHOLD
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei, Nov. 26 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A revised draft of the Referendum Law will
dramatically lower the threshold for passing a referendum proposal,
an official of the Ministry of the Interior (MOI) said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Chuang Kuo-hsiang, a section chief of the MOI's Civil Affairs
Department, made the remarks at a seminar convened by several
environmental protection groups on the eve of the first anniversary
of the passing of the Referendum Law.
</P>
<P>
The groups claimed that the thresholds for the initiation and
establishment of referendum topics are too high, so that except for a
"defensive referendum" initiated by President Chen Shui-bian and held
alongside the March 20 presidential election, no proposals have yet
been established as a referendum topic since the law cleared the
opposition-dominated Legislative Yuan Nov. 27 last year.
</P>
<P>
Chuang said that the revised draft law makes revisions on several
controversial points, including lowering the threshold to establish a
proposal and the abolishment of a screening committee.
</P>
<P>
The screening committee, which is composed of members recommended
by political parties in proportion to the number of seats they occupy
in the legislature, should be abolished, he said, so that
representative politics will not supersede those of a direct
democracy.
</P>
<P>
The threshold for initiating a referendum topic would also be
lowered from the current over 80,000 votes to just 8,000, while the
threshold for petitions to establish a topic will be cut from the
current 800,000 to 300,000, according to the revised draft.
</P>
<P>
Current provisions say the people should not resubmit the same
topic within three years if they have withdrawn the topic, abandoned
a petition drive or failed to implement a referendum, but Chuang said
that the provision would be dropped under the revised draft law.
</P>
<P>
He said that although over 90 percent of the people who cast
ballots in the first nationwide referendum March 20 agreeing with the
two questions -- whether to strengthen Taiwan's anti-missile defense
capability and whether to negotiate a peace framework with mainland
China -- they were considered invalid because fewer than half of the
eligible voters took part.
</P>
<P>
Chuang said that to truly reflect the will of the people, the
regulation that half of the voters should take part in the voting
would be dropped and that if over 25 percent of registered voters t
agree with the topic and outnumber those who are against, then the
proposal would be valid.
</P>
<P>
But on such topics as a change of the national boundaries or
constitutional amendments, the approval rate would have to top 50
percent to be considered valid under the revised law draft, Chuang
said.
</P>
<P>
Lin Wen-yin, vice president of the Taiwan Environmental
Protection Union, said that there are still flaws in the Referendum
Law and he urged a speedy revision by legislators across the party
spectrum on the controversial parts after the Dec. 11 legislative
elections.
</P>
<P>
Chou Sheng-hsin, convener of the Alliance for a Peaceful
Homeland, said that the law stipulates that the initiators of
proposals must collect 825,360 signatures within six months to have
the proposal established, which she said is too difficult.
</P>
<P>
She pointed out that the threshold of 825,000 is 3.6 percent of
the population, compared to the ratio of 0.8 percent in Italy to have
a proposal established, 1.1 percent in Switzerland, and 0.6 percent
in California. Taiwan's civil rights are not getting due attention,
she added.

60% OF TAIWAN MANUFACTURERS NEUTRAL ON ECONOMIC PROSPECTS
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
(By Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Taipei, Nov. 26 (CAN) Over 60 percent of Taiwan manufacturers are
neutral about their economic prospects in the next six months,
according to a survey by a local think tank.
</P>
<P>
The results of the survey conducted in October by the Taiwan
Institute of Economic Research (TIER) show that the ratio of
manufacturers optimistic about their economic prospects in the next
six months dropped to 12.21 percent from 37.4 percent in September,
while those who are pessimistic dropped slightly to 21.3 percent from
22.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
Those who felt their economic situation would remain the same
increased dramatically to 66.4 percent from 40.4 percent the previous
month.
</P>
<P>
TIER Vice President Hung Teh-sheng said that the ratio of those
who are optimistic dropped significantly because most manufacturers
tend to become more conservative as the year draws to an end.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the TIER also adjusted its prediction for the average
exchange rate of the new Taiwan dollar to the U.S. greenback to
NT$32.2 for next year.
</P>
<P>
The researchers said the world financial community has expected
an appreciation of mainland China's renminbi. This, coupled with
Taiwan's large foreign exchange reserves and its huge trade surplus,
while foreign institutional investors continue to flock into the
Taiwan market, are expected to add tremendous pressure for
appreciation of the Taiwan dollar.

<TEXT>
<P>
Taiwan's Ministry of Justice Investigation
Bureau (MJIB) was cited by the Tokyo Customs Office Friday for its
successful cooperation with Japanese law enforcement authorities in
thwarting cross-border drug trafficking.
</P>
<P>
It marked the first time the MJIB has ever been publicly
recognized for contributions to Japan's war on contraband drugs.
</P>
<P>
Yang Kuang-chuan, director of the MJIB's Narcotics Investigation
Center, headed a group of staff members that attended the citation
ceremony, which was held in connection with the Tokyo Customs' 51st
founding anniversary.
</P>
<P>
Also cited for their contributions to international cooperation
in the fight against drug trafficking were Hong Kong and Canadian
customs authorities, Israeli police and the Australian Embassy in
Japan.
</P>
<P>
Keiji Fujiwara, director of Tokyo Customs Office, presented
citations to representatives from the MJIB and the other foreign
authorities during the award ceremony.
</P>
<P>
Fujiwara expressed his heartfelt gratitude for the assistance
from the foreign authorities in preventing contraband drugs from
entering Japan.
</P>
<P>
By cooperating with the MJIB, Japanese law enforcement officers
have managed to uncover two large-scale cross-border drug trafficking
cases in the past two years. In one case, Japanese police
successfully intercepted 113 kg of amphetamines that were being
smuggled into Japan.
</P>
<P>
Law enforcement officers from Taiwan and Japan have increased
exchanges of visits and information in recent years to enhance their
efficiency in joint operations against drug trafficking. The MJIB has
also posted officers at Taiwan's representative office in Japan to
facilitate bilateral crime-fighting cooperation.

<P>
The government approved 41 new investment
projects and 72 cases of additional investment worth a total of
NT$35.97 billion (US$1.12 billion) in export processing zones (EPZs)
around Taiwan from January to November this year, according to
official statistics released Friday.
</P>
<P>
The amount represents a 35.98 percent rise over last year,
according to a report by the Export Processing Zone Administration
(EPZA) under the Ministry of Economic Affairs.
</P>
<P>
Sales amounted to NT$297.8 billion during the 10 months to
October, up 22.91 percent compared with the same period of last year,
the report shows.
</P>
<P>
The electrical and machinery equipment manufacturing sector
posted the highest sales at NT$231.8 billion, a growth of 22.47
percent from last year's level.
</P>
<P>
Chou Yen, director of the EPZA, said the structure of EPZs in
Taiwan has experienced a fundamental change over the past 30 years.
</P>
<P>
While foreign investors used to account for 80 percent of the
investment in the past, domestic businesses have replaced foreign
investors as the major investors, Chou said.
</P>

Chou said the EPZA is working to renew plants in the zones to try
to attract more investment.

CHINA TRYING TO SABOTAGE TAIWAN'S TIES WITH VANUATU: OFFICIAL
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei, Nov. 26 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mainland China is going all-out to sabotage
Taiwan's ties with Vanuatu and Taipei is keeping a close eye on the
situation, Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesman Michel Lu said
Friday.
</P>
<P>
Addressing wire service reports that Australia is cutting down on
its aid to Vanuatu, Lu said it is "obviously Beijing" that is
twisting Australia's arm to pressure Vanuatu to back down from a Nov.
3 agreement with Taipei to strike diplomatic ties.
</P>
<P>
Lu said Beijing's former ambassador to Vanuatu has flown to Port
Vila to see if he could use his personal influence with Vanuatu
leaders to reverse Premier Serge Vohor's decision.
</P>
<P>
Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Kau Ying-mao who is in Port Vila
will see to it that the newly forged diplomatic ties are not nipped
in the bud, Lu said.
</P>
<P>
Vanuatu's parliament will meet next week, Lu said, adding that
Vohor is confident he can convince the parliament that the diplomatic
ties with Taiwan serve the country's best interests.
</P>
<P>
Vohor, who complained that Beijing's promise of aid has not
materialized, extended diplomatic recognition to Taipei Nov. 3 in
exchange for a promise of an unspecifed aid.
</P>
<P>
But his government has since been caught in a diplomatic
tug-of-war between Taipei and Beijing, both of whom have gone out of
their ways to woo the friendship of the tiny South Pacific island
state.

<P>
Delegates from Taiwan and Nicaragua are
slated to hold a second round of free trade agreement (FTA) talks
next week in San Francisco, Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA)
officials said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Vice Minister of Economic Affairs Chen Ruey-long and his
Nicaraguan counterpart Alejandro Arguello will conduct the
negotiations on behalf of their respective governments in the
meeting, which will open Monday, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
Officials from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the MOEA, the
Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Justice, the Department of
Health, the Council of Agriculture, the Financial Supervisory
Commission and the Directorate General of Telecommunications will
make up the bulk of the Taiwan delegation.
</P>
<P>
The two countries are expected to reach agreement on issues
related to plant and animal quarantine, investment and the protection
of intellectual property rights during the new round of talks, which
will be divided into five panels, the officials said, adding that the
MOEA hopes to conclude all the talks and sign an FTA accord by the
end of the first half of next year.
</P>
<P>
According to Chen, Taiwan and Nicaragua exchanged customs tariff
reduction lists for agricultural and farm products prior to the San
Francisco negotiations, which will help two-way substantive talks
conclude sooner.
</P>
<P>
The two countries finished their first round of FTA talks in late
September in Taipei, making Nicaragua a would-be second FTA partner
of Taiwan, after Panama.

TAIWAN HIGH SPEED RAIL CORP. REACHES SETTLEMENT WITH EUROTRAIN

<TEXT>
<P>
The Taiwan High Speed Rail Corp. (THSRC)
reached a settlement Friday with its former partner, Eurotrain,
wherein THSRC will pay US$65 million in damages to Eurotrain, THSRC
officials said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Compared with an arbitration ruled by the International Chamber
of Commerce (ICC) early this year, the new settlement saves THSRC
US$24 million, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
THSRC teamed up with the Eurotrain consortium in 1996 to make a
bid to construct Taiwan's first high-speed railway, and won the US$16
billion contract in 1997.
</P>
<P>
However, THSRC ditched Eurotrain for Japan's Shinkansen
consortium in 1999, on the grounds that Eurotrain charged too high a
price for its system and refused to become a shareholder of THSRC.
</P>
<P>
Eurotrain filed for arbitration with the ICC in 2001.
</P>
<P>
The ICC issued an arbitration award March 15, 2004, wherein THSRC
was ordered to pay US$73.04 million in damages and interest to
Eurotrain.
</P>
<P>
The payment, along with the interest payable, had amounted to
US$89 million as of Nov. 26, THSRC officials said.

Police in the mainland Chinese city of
Dongguan in Guangdong Province have arrested a man in connection with
the murder of a Taiwanese family of three and their maid, according
to news arriving here Friday.
</P>
<P>
The man arrested is a carpenter who was hired to decorate the
family's house, and probably killed the family to steal their money,
said Dongguan police.
</P>
<P>
The Taiwanese, Chang Chien Rung-kun, his pregnant spouse, their
daughter and a maid were found murdered in their home early Friday.
</P>
<P>
However, Deputy Secretary-General of the Straits Exchange
Foundation Yen Wang-chin said in Taipei that he is not certain the
pregnant woman and child are Chang Chien's wife and child because
local newspapers said his wife and their children live in southern
Taiwan. He said the SEF is helping Chang Chien's Taiwan family
members to visit Dongguan.
</P>
<P>
Yen said the SEF will urge its mainland counterpart, the
Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits, to prod the
Chinese police into investigating the case aggressively and bringing
the killer or killers to justice as soon as possible.

NO TIMETABLE FOR TRIAL RENMINBI EXCHANGE SERVICE ON KINMEN: MAC
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Nov.  26 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The government has yet to decide on the
timing for opening a mainland Chinese currency exchange service on
the frontline islands of Kinmen and Matsu on a trial basis, Mainland
Affairs Council (MAC) Vice Chairman Chiu Tai-san said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Chiu made the remarks in response to a press inquiry as to
whether the proposed experimental renminbi exchange service will be
implemented simultaneously with the arrival of the first tourists
from mainland China's Fujian Province to Kinmen and Matsu for
pleasure trips in December.
</P>
<P>
If the mainland indeed begins to allow its Fujian Province
residents to visit the two outlying islands in December, Chiu said
the proposed opening of experimental renminbi exchange services will
become more urgent.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, he said, the government must still follow
established operational procedures in launching the service on the
islands, both of which lie closer to Fujian Province than to Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Chiu said the MAC began to weigh the feasibility of the new
service in July and started preparatory work in August.
</P>
<P>
"Once the regulation-drafting work is completed, the package must
be put up for approval by MAC commissioners before being referred to
the Cabinet for final endorsement. The Cabinet will then decide on
the exact enforcement timing," Chiu said.
</P>
<P>
According to media reports, the mainland will allow Fujian
residents to make sightseeing trips to Kinmen and Matsu in the first
half of December, with the first such tour group headed by Huang
Xiaoyen, director of the Fujian Provincial Travel Bureau.
</P>
<P>
Chiu said the government has long had preparations in place for
mainland citizens making sightseeing trips to Kinmen and Matsu and
travel agents in the two outlying islands are also well prepared for
receiving mainland tourists.
</P>
<P>
In consideration of hotel and tourism facilities on the two
islands, Chiu said the daily mainland tourist ceilings for Kinmen and
Matsu are 600 and 100, respectively.

NEW TYPE OF FLU TO BE DESIGNATED AS STATUTORY COMMUNICABLE DISEASE
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Nov.  26 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A new type of influenza will be formally
designated as a statutory communicable disease in mid-December,
making it subject to stringent controls and preventive measures, the
Department of Health (DOH) said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Shih Wen-yi, deputy director of the DOH's Center for Disease
Control (CDC) , made the remarks after the World Health Organization
(WHO) warned a day earlier that the world is closer to the next flu
pandemic "than we have ever been before" and that it may kill 2
million to 7 million people and infect more than 1.5 billion.
</P>
<P>
Shih said the DOH made te decision as Taiwan is adjacent to avian
flu mutation high-risk areas such as mainland China, Thailand and
Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
Shih said the DOH completed a comprehensive response plan in
August in preparation for any possible flu pandemic.
</P>
<P>
Once the flu is listed as a statutory communicable disease,
people who show suspicious flu symptoms and have come into contact
with poultry within the previous 10 days or who have traveled to
avian flu-affected countries must immediately seek medical treatment
and physicians will decide whether to collect blood samples for
testing and whether to offer anti-flu drugs.
</P>
<P>
Shih said the CDC has stockpiled 2.3 million tablets of Tamiflu,
a drug for treating flu. Moreover, the CDC has decided to increase
Tamiflu stocks to 23 million tablets for the use of 2.3 million
people. In addition, the CDC will invest US$10 million in research
and development of flu vaccines.

TAIWAN ECONOMY SLOWS, SIGNALS GREEN LIGHT FOR OCTOBER: CEPD
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Nov.  26 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taiwan's economy displayed a green light
for October, an indication that domestic economic activity had turned
from heating up to steady, the Cabinet-level Council for Economic
Planning and Development (CEPD) reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The green light was a change from the yellow-red light for
September, which signals a booming economy.
</P>
<P>
The green light for last month was the first for the country's
economy since Dec. 2003, as the leading index stood at 106.7, down
from 108 in September, while the current index dropped to 110.2 from
110.9. The October composite index showed a fall to 29 points from 32
points a month earlier.
</P>
<P>
The other colors in the five-color rating system designated by
the CEPD are red, indicating an overheated economy, yellow-blue,
representing sluggishness and blue, pointing to recession.
</P>
<P>
Hu Chung-ying, director of the CEPD's Economic Research
Department, attributed the declines in the major economic indexes for
October to various key factors at home and abroad, such as the
central bank's interest rate hikes, the effects of typhoons, soaring
world oil prices that surged to nearly US$60 a barrel, growth in the
local wholesale price index (WPI) and fewer work days in the month.
</P>
<P>
Statistics compiled by the Directorate General of Budget,
Accounting and Statistics (DGBAS) show that the WPI increased by an
annual growth rate of 12.02 percent last month -- the highest
single-month growth rate since 1980.
</P>
<P>
In October, outbound shipments expanded by only 7.7 percent in
value, a noticeable drop from September's 15 percent, according to
the DGBAS tallies.
</P>
<P>
As signs are clear that both the domestic and world economies
have slowed in the second half of this year, an economist said it is
not a surprise development and suggested that there is nothing to
worry about.
</P>
<P>
Chou Chi, chief of the economic forecast center at the Chung Hua
Institution for Economic Research, said that business conditions at
home are expected to remain stable through the end of this year with
a slim chance of a further worsening.
</P>
<P>
Chou, however, pointed out that a much-anticipated strengthening
of mainland China's renminbi next year will be a major element that
will affect Taiwan's business climate for the whole of 2005.
</P>
<P>
The fluctuations in the value of the mainland currency will have
a profound impact on the competitive edge of Taiwan companies, as
many of them use the mainland as a manufacturing base for their
exports to other countries.

CUSTODY SOUGHT FOR MAN SUSPECTED OF PLANTING BOMBS AROUND TAIPEI

<TEXT>
<P>
A prosecutor sought court approval Friday
to take into custody a man suspected of planting bombs around Taipei
in the last year.
</P>
<P>
Cheng Ke-sheng, a prosecutor at the Taipei District Court, said
Yang Ju-men, the suspected bomber, should be taken into custody to
prevent him for jumping bail or tampering with evidence.
</P>
<P>
Yang accompanied his brother to a police station in Taipei
Thursday evening and waited outside as his brother told police that
he is the wanted bomber.
</P>
<P>
His brother also asked for a reward of NT$500,000 offered by
police for information leading to the arrest of the bomber, who has
planted at least 17 explosive devices since last November, with notes
on them expressing opposition to the government's policy of opening
the local market to foreign rice, earning himself the nickname "the
rice bomber" in the newspapers.
</P>
<P>
No-one has been hurt by Yang's explosives.
</P>
<P>
The police offered the reward only Wednesday after making public
a picture of the rice bomber caught on a surveillance camera.
</P>
<P>
Yang denied his brother's allegations but tests found that his
DNA matches that of specimens found on evidence collected from the
crime sites.
</P>
<P>
Born into a farming family in southern Taiwan, police believe
Yang has the motive to oppose the government's market-opening policy.

not seek it. Go home and seek it, and you will have an abundance of
teachers."

The Taiwan External Trade Development

Hong Kong chain supermarket to promote Taiwan fruits.
</P>
<P>
TAITRA began the promotion activity at 50 PARKnSHOP stores in
Hong Kong Nov. 25 at the commission of the Council of Agriculture.
</P>
<P>
The focus of the promotion activity is on Taiwan's seasonal
fruits, including oranges, papayas, grapefruits, pineapples,
starfruit, guavas and pomelos, TAITRA officials said.
</P>
<P>
They noted that Hong Kong has been a major market for Taiwan's
agricultural products. They also noted that PARKnSHOP is the largest
chain store in Hong Kong and that it also distributes fruits to the
mainland.
</P>
<P>
The officials further said they hope the two-week promotion
activities will help upgrade the image of Taiwan agricultural
products and expand their market share in Hong Kong as well as help
them make inroads into the markets of the Greater Pearl River Delta

Premier Yu Shyi-kun on Saturday expressed

months ahead of schedule.
</P>
<P>
Construction work on the 31-km Peiyi Expressway, which connects
Shihting in Taipei County and Suao in the northeastern county of
Ilan, is scheduled to be completed in December 2005.

<P>
While inspecting the project in Ilan County, Yu pointed out that
he had always demanded during his term as Ilan magistrate that public
construction projects be completed three months ahead of schedule.
</P>
<P>
Yu said he hopes the engineering team of the Peiyi Expressway
project will step up the pace and have the project completed two
month earlier in order to provide time to deal with any problems that
may arise.
</P>
<P>
The 12.9-km Shueishan Tunnel, the centerpiece of the project, was
bored through in September. It is the longest highway tunnel in Asia

NEW CONSTITUTION NECESSARY FOR TAIWAN'S SURVIVAL: FORMER PRESIDENT
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Nov.  27 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Denying Taiwan the right to have a new
constitution is tantamount to denying Taiwan the right to survive,
former President Lee Teng-hui claimed Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the opening of an international seminar on a new
constitution for Taiwan, the former president said that the current
Republic of China Constitution is an impediment to Taiwan's
democratic development and that the Taiwan people need to discard it.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan's democracy will be suffocated to death if the current ROC
Constitution is not done away with and a new one is not set in its
place, Lee continued.
</P>
<P>
Lee boasted that he amended the ROC Constitution six times during
his 12-year presidency to give back to the people the right to rule
the country, adding that he found during his time in office that he
was facing a stone wall whenever he tried to further Taiwan's
democracy.
</P>
<P>
Lee said the ROC Constitution defines a territory for the nation
that overlaps with territory that other countries claim sovereignty
over, which he claimed has resulted in contradictions and conflict.
He added that instead of improving the country's stability, the ROC
Constitution gives Beijing the excuse to claim sovereignty over
Taiwan, and therefore plunges the country and the region into crisis.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, Lee claimed that the ROC Constitution was crafted
without the participation or approval of the Taiwan people, adding
that it goes against the notion of democracy to impose this
constitution on the people.
</P>
<P>
Claiming that the people's right to write their own constitution
is a basic human right acknowledged by the United Nations, Lee urged
the world to support Taiwan's bid to create a new constitution which
he said will lay the groundwork for the country's future development.
</P>
<P>
The two-day seminar organized by the Taiwan Advocates, a private
think tank founded by Lee in 2001, has drawn 28 domestic and 17
foreign scholars.

'PAN-GREEN' MAJORITY IN LEGISLATURE NEEDED TO END UNREST: PRESIDENT
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei, Nov. 27 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President Chen Shui-bian on Saturday called
for the public to support the "pan-green camp" in the Dec. 11
elections to help it form a majority in the new legislature and end
the political uncertainties and social unrest with constitutional
reform.
</P>
<P>
Chen made the call at the opening of an international seminar on
a new constitution for Taiwan. Former President Lee Teng-hui also
spoke at the seminar held at the Grand Hotel in Taipei.
</P>
<P>
Asking for the public support for the "pan green camp" of the
ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) and the Taiwan Solidarity
Union (TSU), Chen stressed that Taiwan needs a suitable constitution
to deal with the fast changing world and to secure its survival and
sustainable development.
</P>
<P>
The president said that he is determined to hold a referendum on
putting forth a new constitution for Taiwan by the end of 2006 and to
hold another referendum on implementing it, on May 20, 2008, when his
current term ends.
</P>
<P>
He vowed to put an end to the current political instability and
social unrest in Taiwan with a new constitution if the "pan green
camp" wins a majority in the 225-member Legislative Yuan.
</P>
<P>
If the "pan green camp" can win more than half the seats, he
continued, a constitutional re-engineering task force will begin
operations immediately after the elections.
</P>
<P>
He also urged the international community to realize that the
constitutional reform in Taiwan is key to helping create peace and
stability in the Asia-Pacific region and the rest of the world.

VOTE ALLOCATION STRATEGY BOUND TO FAIL FOR 'PAN-BLUE': DPP WHIP
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Nov.  27 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The vote allocation strategy is bound to
fail for the opposition "pan-blue alliance" of the Kuomintang (KMT)
and the People First Party (PFP) , a legislator of the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) predicted Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Tsai Huang-liang, DPP whip in the Legislative Yuan, made the
remarks amid reports that the ruling and opposition political parties
have both adopted the ballot allocation strategy under the current
multiple-seat constituency election system to ensure that as many of
their candidates as possible get elected in the Dec. 11 legislative
elections.
</P>
<P>
The DPP has decided to use the strategy in 13 constituencies, and
it will also work with its ally Taiwan Solidarity Union in four of
these constituencies.
</P>
<P>
With only two weeks to go before election day, the KMT and the
PFP have agreed to use the strategy in eight cities and counties --
namely the cities of Kaohsiung and Chiayi, and the counties of
Nantou, Tainan, Ilan, Lienchiang (Matsu), Hualien and Taitung.
</P>
<P>
PFP Chairman James Soong said Saturday that the two parties will
make final assessments and plans on large constituencies, such as
Taipei City, Taipei County and Taoyuan County, one week before the
elections.
</P>
<P>
However, DPP whip Tsai said that the opposition political parties
have their own axes to grind and that it will be difficult for them
to use the strategy. Moreover, the "pan-blue alliance" has never used
the strategy before, and their supporters tend to vote based on a
individual candidate's merits and not on party affiliation, he
continued, adding that the non-cooperative attitude of the individual
candidates of the opposition parties also exacerbates the situation.
</P>
<P>
Tsai said that the DPP has used the vote allocation strategy for
years and that the party's supporters have better teamwork spirit,
which he claimed will ensure that the strategy works for his party.

KMT CHAIRMAN CALLS FOR PRESIDENT TO STEP DOWN FROM DPP CHAIRMANSHIP

<TEXT>
<P>
Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Lien Chan on
Saturday challenged President Chen Shui-bian to resign from his post
as chairman of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) in order
to end the "party-state" era in Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
During a campaign rally in Taichung County, Lien said the DPP has
recently focused its criticism of the KMT on the "party-state" system
during the period of KMT rule while at the same time trying to build
its own "party-state."
</P>
<P>
Lien pointed to President Chen's concurrent role as DPP chairman
and to the fact that all the Cabinet ministers are acting as
campaigners in the Dec. 11 legislative elections to back up his
claims of the DPP's intentions to build a "party-state."
</P>
<P>
Lien demanded that Chen step down from the DPP chairmanship and
that the DPP remove itself from all media operations, state-run
enterprises and financial institutions to set a proper example.
</P>
<P>
He said that the country has lost its direction after four years
DPP rule, with the Republic of China founding father Sun Yat-sen
being called a "foreigner" and the history of the ROC being defined
as "ancient history."
</P>
<P>
The KMT chairman said that the Dec. 11 elections are not only a
chance for the people to choose their legislators, but also a moment
for them to decide the future of the country.
</P>
<P>
He said the elections are about whether the ROC will continue to
exist, whether peace will be achieved across the Taiwan Strait,
whether the country will move toward dictatorship and demagoguery,
and whether reconciliation will arrive in Taiwan society.
</P>
<P>
Lien criticized the DPP government for avoiding a number of
serious problems facing the country, saying the DPP has so far failed
to satisfactorily respond to doubts over the presidential
election-eve shooting of Chen and the NT$610.8 billion (US$18.23
billion) arms procurement plan.

TAITRA LENDING HAND IN SELLING ORANGES
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Nov.  27 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Taiwan External Trade Development
Council (TAITRA) is lending a hand to help promote the sale of
oranges in a bumper harvest year.
</P>
<P>
The Council of Agriculture (COA) estimated that total production
of oranges is expected to reach 230,000 tons this year, up 13 percent
from last year. Although the COA has activated its purchase mechanism
to deal with the overproduction, the move has not been sufficient to
offset the losses to orange growers caused by slumping prices.
</P>
<P>
The TAITRA, which is mainly responsible for export promotion, has
therefore decided to pitch in by helping sell oranges at home and
overseas.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan's oranges mainly go to Southeast Asia, Hong Kong and
mainland China, and the TAITRA recently invited importers from
Singapore to come to Taiwan to taste the oranges and bring some
samples back home. The two sides are now discussing export prices,
and TAITRA officials have said they are optimistic that a deal can be
clinched.
</P>
<P>
The officials noted that Taiwan oranges are sweet and succulent,
although some foreign buyers have complained that it is troublesome
to eat them because of their thick skin and have thought that selling
them as juice might be a good idea.
</P>
<P>
The officials said that they have persuaded businesspeople to
deliver large juice mixers when they export oranges, and to sell both
oranges and orange juice.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, noting that the annual "information month" activity
to be held at the Taipei World Trade Center in early December always
attracts large crowds, the officials said that they have invited
fruit growers from southern Taiwan to set up pavilions selling
oranges and orange juice outside the exhibition sites.
</P>
<P>
They estimated that at least 130 tons of oranges could be sold
during the Dec.4-12 exhibition period.

A scholar called for a new constitution to
confirm Taiwan's sovereignty during a seminar Saturday organized by
the Taiwan Advocates, a private think tank, to beat the drums for a
new constitution for the country.
</P>
<P>
Lee Yung-chih, a professor of history at National Taiwan
University, said Taiwan belongs to the people living on the island,
and not China, adding that this fact will be more clear when the
Taiwan people deny that they are Chinese.
</P>
<P>
Under Beijing's threat of the use of force against the country,
Lee claimed, many Taiwanese are afraid of admitting they are
Taiwanese. Instead, they have claimed their country to be the
Republic of China, which doesn't exist, according to Lee.
</P>
<P>
Although the ROC Constitution has been amended six times, Lee
said, it will never be able to suit the needs of Taiwan because it
wasn't originally formulated for the country. Taiwan therefore needs
its own constitution which is made for it and has nothing to do with
China.
</P>
<P>
Chen Tzu-yang, a law professor at National Taipei University,
said at the seminar that a constitution formulated in 1991 by a
National Assembly elected in Taiwan is the first example of a
constitution created by the Taiwan people, regardless of what name
was given to that constitution.
</P>
<P>
As to a new constitution for Taiwan, which President Chen
Shui-bian has vowed to promulgate by 2008, it should define the
country's system of government and the division of power between the
central and local governments, as well as ensure a separate and
independent judiciary, the law professor said.

<P>
JetStar Asia, a budget airline based in
Singapore, confirmed a media report Saturday that it will open a
regular route between Taipei and Singapore in December to provide
travelers with cheaper trips between the two cities.
</P>
<P>
The opening of the route will make JetStar Asia the first
low-cost airline to edge into the Taiwan air travel market, an
executive for the carrier said, noting that the company is confident
of making handsome earnings from the lucrative route -- one of the
most popular in Asia.
</P>
<P>
JetStar Asia will make public the exact ticket price and the date
of the route opening in two weeks, the executive said.
</P>
<P>
Business sources forecast that JetStar Asia's cheaper ticket
prices will have a noticeable impact on other airlines that fly
between Taipei and Singapore.
</P>
<P>
However, China Airlines and EVA Airways Corp., Taiwan's two
largest carriers, claimed that they are not worried about the entry
of JetStar Asia, on the grounds that the consumers they target are
different.
</P>
<P>
In addition to Taipei, the budget airline is also planning to
offer flight services to Hong Kong, Shanghai, Jakarta, Manila and
other destinations in the region from January next year.

TOURISM AGENTS CALL FOR CROSS-STRAIT EXCHANGES VIA 'MINI THREE LINKS'
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Nov. 27 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Representatives from the domestic tourism
industry signed a declaration Saturday on the frontline island of
Kinmen, urging the government to allow tourist exchanges between
Taiwan and mainland China via the existing "mini three links."
</P>
<P>
More than 300 officials of tourist associations from 25 cities
and counties around Taiwan inked the declaration, calling on the
government to relax the rules governing the "mini three links" -- the
direct trade, postal and transportation links between the Taiwan-held
islands of Kinmen and Matsu and mainland China's Fujian Province --
to bolster bilateral tourist exchanges, forge peace and boost
understanding between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
The representatives demanded in the document that the government
allow people from Taiwan to take pleasure trips to mainland China via
Kinmen or Matsu using only their Republic of China passport.
</P>
<P>
They also urged the government to allow mainland citizens to
visit Taiwan for sight-seeing or business purposes via the two
offshore islands instead of via Hong Kong or Macau as currently
required.
</P>
<P>
Such moves will help Kinmen and Matsu build a security and
tourist corridor in the Taiwan Strait, they said.
</P>
<P>
Lai Cheng-ying, chairman of the Taiwan Federation of Visitors
Associations, expressed their hope that Kinmen and Matsu could be
turned into a transshipment hub in two-way travel and for an eventual
full opening of tourist exchanges between Taiwan and the mainland.
</P>
<P>
In the face of the expected inflows of visitors from Fujian
Province in the wake of the mainland authorities giving the go-ahead,
Lai said that the Taiwan tourism industry representatives really hope
that the government will make the moves swiftly to help inject a new
lease on life into the domestic tourism industry.
</P>
<P>
The tourism agents from across Taiwan were taking part in the
2004 Taiwan Tourism Conference on Kinmen, which opened a day earlier.
</P>
<P>
According to news reaching here, the Fujian tourism authorities
have recently approved five local tourist agencies to operate tourist
trips to Taiwan's Kinmen, Matsu and Penghu islands.

Two opposition People First Party (PFP)
legislators urged President Chen Shui-bian Saturday not to let out
military secrets.
</P>
<P>
Lawmakers Liu Wen-hsiung, convener of PFP caucus in the
Legislative Yuan, and Lee Tung-hao criticized President Chen for
telling Japanese Interchange Association Chairman Reijiro Hattori on
Nov. 19 that Taiwan tipped Tokyo off about the intrusion of a
mainland Chinese nuclear-powered submarine into Japanese territorial
waters Nov. 10. Japan protested to the mainland Chinese government
about the submarine intrusion, and Beijing apologized for the
incident Nov. 16.
</P>
<P>
The two PFP lawmakers said that as the head of state, Chen should
not reveal the nation's intelligence work or the level of its
intelligence capabilities as this is detrimental to the nation's
security interests.
</P>
<P>
They also urged the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to rebut
Beijing's allegations that Taiwan bribed Vanuatuan Prime Minister
Serge Vohor into agreeing on Nov. 3 to establish diplomatic ties with
Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Since that date, a diplomatic tug-of-war has continued in
Port-Vila, capital of Vanuatu, with diplomats from Taipei and Beijing
competing against each other to woo leaders of the tiny south Pacific

PRESIDENT HEAPS PRAISE ON PREMIER

Taipei, Nov. 27 (CNA)

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President Chen Shui-bian on Saturday lauded
Premier Yu Shyi-kun for being a good campaign strategist and a man
who knows how to run a country.
</P>
<P>
The president made the remarks while stumping for legislative
candidates from the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) in the
northeastern county of Ilan, where Yu served two terms as magistrate
and enjoys a high-level of popularity.
</P>
<P>
Chen urged Ilan voters to throw their weight behind the
candidates of the "pan-green camp" of the DPP and its ally, the
Taiwan Solidarity Union, in the Dec. 11 legislative elections so that
the camp can gain a clear majority in the 225-seat Legislative Yuan
and thus facilitate the pushing through of the premier's
administrative agenda.
</P>
<P>
Lauding Yu as the "No. 1 premier, " Chen said that the criticism
by the opposition "pan-blue alliance" that the DPP administration
"knows only how to campaign and doesn't know how to run a country" is
unfair to the premier, as well as a serious insult to the people of
Ilan.
</P>
<P>
In fact, Chen said, the premier knows both how to campaign and
how to run a country, pointing out that Yu won both times he ran for
a Taiwan Provincial Council seat and both times he ran for the post
of Ilan County magistrate.
</P>
<P>
"Yu also contributed a great deal to my re-election in the March
20 presidential election," the president noted.
</P>
<P>
On Yu's performance as premier, the president praised him as a
man "with ability and determination, " pointing out that during his
premiership, he has seen the completion of the 12.9-km Shueishan
Tunnel, the most difficult part in the construction of the 31-km
Peiyi Expressway linking Shihting in Taipei County and Suao in the
northeastern county of Ilan, launched successful dredging operations
in the Keelung River, and improved the tap water quality in
Kaohsiung, all of which were projects left unfinished by the previous
Kuomintang administration.

Taiwan businessmen operating in mainland

businesspeople or members of their families have been killed in
mainland China since 1991, while 167 others remain missing.
</P>

In 1998 alone, a record high of 13 Taiwan people were murdered in
mainland China, while another nine were killed in 1999. So far this
year, eight Taiwan citizens have been killed on the mainland,
including a recent case in Dongguan, Guangdong Province.

Some of Iraq's most powerful political groups, including the
party led by the interim prime minister, called Friday for a
six-month delay in elections scheduled for Jan. 30, citing concerns
over security. The list of groups includes some that have been among
the strongest backers of American policy in Iraq, and their call
gives sudden momentum to those arguing for a postponement. The two
main Kurdish parties supported the delay request, marking the first
time the Kurds, closely allied with the Americans, have taken a clear
stand on the issue.

Wall Street Journal: Will energy costs' pinch scuttle holiday
spending?

Analysts are weighing whether the extra cost of energy will cause
consumers to cut down their holiday spendings. They worry, too, that
the effect will hit hit hardest the lower-income earners. Gasoline
prices have shot up more than 60 percent from a year ago, and the
cost of home heating oil has doubled in some parts of the U.S. So
far, consumers' faith in the economy has remained fairly unscathed in
the face of these rising costs. Americans' spending behavior has been
relatively robust heading into the 2004 holiday shopping season.

500 ABSCONDERS NABBED IN 1 MONTH WITH HELP OF VIETNAMESE OFFICIALS
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Nov.  28 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a sweeping operation, Taiwan police
authorities have managed to round nearly 500 absconders in a
one-month period, with the help of Vietnamese officials, sources from
the Council of Labor Affairs (CLA) said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan police authorities, backed up by labor affairs officials
from the Vietnam Economic and Culture Office (VECO) in Taipei and
Vietnamese labor brokers, successfully nabbed during the recent
one-month period nearly 500 Vietnamese laborers or caregivers who had
absconded from their Taiwanese employers, CLA officials said.
</P>
<P>
Under mounting pressure from the Taiwan authorities, who had
threatened to freeze imports of Vietnamese laborers if absconding was
not checked before the end of 2004, the Vietnamese authorities have
summoned some 100 labor brokerage personnel from Vietnam to Taiwan to
help find the Vietnamese absconders, who were believed to be still in
Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Equipped with maps and the absconders' ID information, the
Vietnamese labor brokerage agents, divided into groups of six, left
no stone unturned in their search.
</P>
<P>
In one "lucky" raid, eight Vietnamese absconders were nabbed in
one single action, a VECO official said.
</P>
<P>
The Vietnamese labor brokers were efficient because they had
detailed information about the absconders, including addresses and
telephone numbers of their direct relatives back in Vietnam. Since
most of the Vietnamese workers regularly send money back to their
hometowns, "it's easy to find them via their contact information, "
the VECO official said.
</P>
<P>
Reading the Taiwan maps and sorting out directions were pretty
much the hardest part of the action, he added.
</P>
<P>
VECO authorities said Saturday that it would be no problem for
them to achieve the goal of 2,000 absconders nabbed by the end of
this year that was set by CLA as a condition to prevent Taiwan from
adopting a freeze on the import of Vietnamese laborers.
</P>
<P>
The action was taken after a visit to Taiwan in October by Nguyen
Luong Trao, Vietnam's deputy minister of labor, war invalids and
social welfare, who promised the CLA that he would see to it that the
problem was tackled in a timely manner.
</P>
<P>
According to CLA talles, 11,000 out of the some 84,000 Vietnamese
workers currently in Taiwan had absconded as of the end of October.
Since about half of all the absconded foreign laborers in Taiwan are
Vietnamese nationals, Vietnam posted the highest rate of absconding
among all foreign laborers as of the end of August in terms of
nationality, followed by the Philippines and Thailand.
</P>
<P>
The sweeping action was further aided by the fact that the
Vietnamese government agreed to pay for the airfares home -- about
NT$8,000 (US$248) -- for each absconder, who will be repatriated
immediately, and the fact that the Vietnamese labor brokers were
warned that their licenses would be revoked if they failed to
cooperate, according to Kuo Fang-yu, director-general of the CLA
Employment and Vocational Trading Administration.
</P>
<P>
The CLA in May suspended the introduction of Vietnamese fishermen
and crew members into Taiwan in response to the group's high
absconding rate.
</P>
<P>
Although Vietnam is not the largest source of foreign laborers in
Taiwan, Vietnamese workers have continued to top the list in terms of
number of absconders who have not been found, according to CLA
tallies.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan had about 302,000 legal foreign laborers at the end of
June, with 102,000 from Thailand, 86,000 from the Philippines, 72,000
from Vietnam, 40,000 from Indonesia, 36 from Mongolia and 22 from
Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia, because it failed to comply with a CLA request to cut
the exorbitant brokerage fees charged by employment agencies in its
country, has not been allowed to export any laborers to Taiwan since
Aug. 1, 2002.
</P>
<P>
The manufacturing sector has absorbed the largest number of
foreign laborers, followed by the caregiving sector and the
construction industry. A few thousand of these foreign laborers also
serve as maids.

<TEXT>
<P>
A lecturer at a science-technology
university in Taipei County was nabbed Saturday for producing illicit
drugs at the laboratory where he teaches, police reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The university teacher, surnamed Fang, who has double masters
degrees in mechanics and chemistry from a U.S. university, was caught
red-handed with his accomplices during a police raid at the lab
Saturday night, said police authorities from Panchiao and Hsinchuang
cities.
</P>
<P>
Fang, 42, was apprehended along with several of his accomplices,
including a drug pusher nicknamed "White Monkey." Also seized at the
lab were 14 kg of amphetamine, 148 kg of semi-finished amphetamine
and gear and instruments that they used to produce the drugs.
</P>
<P>
According to Cheng Hsin-hung, chief prosecutor with the Panchiao
District Prosecutor's Office, investigators had been tailing Fang and
"White Monkey" for three months before conducting the raid.
</P>
<P>
Police believe Fang was lured by the enticement of big profits
into running the risk of producing amphetamine using the lab of the
institute where he teaches as a production hub.
</P>
<P>
Police said they are tracking his other accomplices and trying to
find out who Fang and "White Monkey" channeling the drugs to.

TAIWAN MUST STRENGTHEN DEFENSES BEFORE BUILDING A NEW NATION: SCHOLAR
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Nov. 28 (CNA)
(By P.C. Tang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taiwan must improve its national defensive
strength and its people's determination to protect the island if it
wants to build a new nation, a U.S. scholar said in Taipei Sunday,
adding that "the United States will support a determined democratic
Taiwan."
</P>
<P>
John J. Tkacik, senior research fellow at the Asia Studies Center
of the Heritage Foundation, made the remarks at a seminar to discuss
issues related to enacting a new constitution for the nation.
</P>
<P>
Emphasizing that Washington can only "work seriously" if Taiwan
just wants to be protected by the United States and to treat itself
as an outsider of its national defense, the scholar said that the
island is not an ally that has signed treaties with the United States
and that the Taiwan Relations Act is only Washington's
self-commitment toward Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Saying that both enacting a new constitution and revising the
contents of the existing Constitution are Taiwan's business, Tkacik
noted that as a foreigner, his only concern is whether the issue will
make mainland China attack Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
According to a senior U.S.-China expert, Charles Freeman, said
"enacting a constitution means independence" and noted that the mainland
sees "a declaration of Taiwan independence the same as a declaration of
war."
</P>
<P>
Tkacik further said that based on an assessment of the mainland's
military ability, "China is guaranteed to use its force" and "will
use its force to attack."
</P>
<P>
Pointing out that if Taiwan wants to build a new nation, the
first step is to strengthen its national defenses and the
determination of its younger generation to protect the island, the
scholar said, adding that only then should the island establish the
new governmental system.

FRENCH FILM FESTIVAL HONORS TAIWAN SOUND ENGINEER

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Tu Tu-chih, an award-winning Taiwan
sound engineer, is the theme figure of the ongoing 26th International
Tri-Continental Film Festival in Nantes, France, organizers said
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
International film festivals traditionally focus attention on
directors and actors or actresses. Few film festivals have ever
selected backstage personnel as their theme figures. Nantes film
festival organizers said they have selected Tu as this year's theme
figure mainly because they want to recognize his professional
accomplishments and to emphasize the importance of team spirit in
film production.
</P>
<P>
Tu, a winner of the 2004 Taiwan National Literary and Arts
Awards, said he was honored to be featured at the festival.
</P>
<P>
At the invitation of the festival organizers, Tu used
synthesizers and other equipment to create sound for a 1919 silent
movie directed by American director David Wark Griffith screened
Saturday evening, winning much acclaim from film industry
professionals who were gathered in Nantes for the festival.
</P>
<P>
In a eulogy delivered after Tu's performance, Yang Teh-chang, a
noted Taiwan director, said Tu is a perfectionist who devotes all his
energy into his work.
</P>
<P>
"Tu has never been daunted by setbacks and challenges in his
work. He has always tried to learn useful lessons from flops and
finally attained a pinnacle in a profession he loves very much," said
Yang, who has collaborated with Tu on many films.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on the same occasion, Wong Kar Wei, a Hong Kong
director, said Tu is one of the best screen recording masters he has
ever collaborated with. "I'm very pleased with the Nantes film
festival organizers' decision to honor Tu and exhibit some of his
screen recording works this year."
</P>
<P>
Tu is the first movie professional to have received Taiwan's
National Literary and Arts Awards. He also won an award at the 2001
Cannes Film Festival for his work on the movie "What Time Is It
There?"

RICE IMPORTS HAVE NOT AFFECTED DOMESTIC MARKET: COA
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Nov. 28 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Rice imports have so far not affected the
domestic rice market, the Council of Agriculture (COA) said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Since Taiwan was admitted to the World Trade Organization (WTO)
in January 2002, it has been required to import up to 144,720 metric
tons of rice annually.
</P>
<P>
But only 35 percent of the mandatory amount has been opened for
the private sector to import, with the remaining 65 percent imported
by the government for stockpiling for later distribution in
accordance with the domestic market supply and demand situation.
</P>
<P>
As a result, COA officials said, the domestic rice market has so
far not been affected by the restricted market opening measures.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the officials went on, the COA has adopted various
other measures to protect rice farmers' rights and interests and
maintain domestic market stability, including raising subsidies for
rice paddy owners and farmers whose paddies are compulsorily left
fallow, upgrading the quality of locally produced rice and promoting
rice exports.
</P>
<P>
Noting that sustainable development of the rice farming industry
is a government policy goal, the officials said the government is
determined to develop a globally competitive rice production industry
and protect rice farmers' legitimate rights and interests.

'TEACHER CHANG' LIFELINE TURNS 35 YEARS OLD

(By Deborah Kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The "Teacher Chang" lifeline turned 35
years old Sunday, having provided consultations to some 1.7 million
callers around Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
The telephone hotline has given consultations to 1.71 million
people over the past 35 years, with the number of consultation
services totaling 60,758 in 2004, a 15-fold increase compared with
the 4,094 posted in the inaugural year, said officials from China
Youth Corps (CYC), sponsor of the lifeline.
</P>
<P>
Most of the "Teacher Chang" consultations have been provided via
telephone calls, although "Teacher Chang" also provides consulting
via other means, including face-to-face talks, letters and e-mail.
</P>
<P>
Except for the first year, female callers have outnumbered male
callers throughout the past 34 years, and most of the callers have
been students, followed by jobless adults, CYC officials said.
</P>
<P>
In the last 10 years, according to a breakdown compiled by the
CYC, some 17,000 high school students called "Teacher Chang" for help
or consulting, followed by 14,000 university students and 12,000
junior college students, to vent their fear or spleen, or to seek
expert advice.
</P>
<P>
The issues that the callers have presented range from family or
household problems, romantic affairs, other personal relations and
other matters, in that order.
</P>
<P>
October and July are traditionally the busiest months for the
service, CYC officials said.
</P>
<P>
The "Teacher Chang" lifeline runs affiliated operations in 13
cities and counties around the island, with some 130 consultants and
939 volunteers regularly working in the system.
</P>
<P>
Over the past three decades, some 10,000 people who have received
consultations have returned to "Teacher Chang" to work as volunteers.
Of the total, 78 percent are females, mostly aged over 40, CYC
officials said.
</P>
<P>
The CYC, founded by the late President Chiang Ching-kuo in an
effort to strengthen services to the nation's youth population,
organized a party at the Chientan Youth Activity Center Sunday to

<TEXT>
<P>
A group of foreign
brides of local residents in the Pingtung area have formed a
supporters group Sunday to throw their support behind a Democratic
Progressive Party legislative candidate, even though they have no
right to vote in Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
The 10-odd foreign brides, clad in traditional Indonesian,
Filipino and Vietnamese costume, said during a campaign rally of DPP
legislative candidate Pan Meng-an that although they have no right to
vote, they will prod their husbands and other Taiwan relatives into
voting for Pan, who they claimed "will make a good lawmaker because
he takes good care of Taiwan's foreign nationals."
</P>
<P>
The show of support was a shot in the arm for Pan, who, according
to local election analysis, has no clear majority.
</P>
<P>
Welcoming the foreign brides' support, Pan said that he has been
abroad for many years doing business and knows only too well how
lonely a foreign expatriate can feel living in a foreign land.
</P>
<P>
Pan said that the purpose of his establishing the Hemp Garden
Community Education and Culture Center in Pingtung several years ago
was mainly to provide a shelter and hub for foreign brides in the
Pingtung area.
</P>
<P>
Over the years, Pan said, the center has offered Taiwanese
language classes and other cultural classes for the foreign brides,
helping them better adapt to Taiwan society and their new Taiwan
families.
</P>
<P>
Pan added that it is one of his center's goals to take better
care of the mothers of the so-called "New Taiwanese" -- the children
of Taiwan locals and their foreign brides -- so that the "New
Taiwanese" can receive better education and their foreign mothers can
find Taiwan to be a good new home.

WEB SITE RATING FOUNDATION TO BE INAUGURATED TO PROTECT KIDS
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Nov.  28 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An Internet Web site rating foundation,
composed of representatives from the government, portal operators and
public-interest groups, will be inaugurated Monday in an attempt to
ensure that the Internet will not adversely affect local youngsters.
</P>
<P>
The establishment of the foundation is part of the Government
Information Office's (GIO's) efforts to create a safe Web environment
for local children and adolescents following its promulgation of Web
content rating regulations in April this year.
</P>
<P>
The foundation's board members will include officials from the
GIO, the Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Transportation and
Communication, portal operators such as Chunghwa Telecom Co.,
Seednet, yam.com, Yahoo! and ETToday, as well as public-interest
groups dedicated to promoting children's welfare.
</P>
<P>
GIO officials said the enforcement of a Web rating system is
urgent because the number of local Web surfers aged under 12 has
broken the 1 million mark.
</P>
<P>
The foundation will work out a Web rating system that will
require operators to mark out "restricted" Web sites and to help
parents set codes on their home computers to stop their children
gaining access to Web sites with violence, sex and drug references,
the officials said.
</P>
<P>
According to a GIO study, the number of local Web surfers aged
below 12 has reached 1.06 million and 92.3 percent of children aged
between 12 and 15 have Internet experience.
</P>
<P>
The GIO also conducted a public opinion survey of 1,095 adult
residents around the island from Nov.15-16 to explore their opinions
about the implementation of a Web rating system.
</P>
<P>
The survey results show that 89.4 percent of the respondents
support the proposal that the GIO require portal operators to mark
out "restricted" Web sites to be subject to close monitoring.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, 85 percent said they support the proposal that the GIO
encourage local parents to set secret codes on their home computers
to prevent children and juveniles from surfing pornographic Web
sites.
</P>
<P>
Generally speaking, GIO officials said, local residents fully
support the GIO's plan to introduce the rating system.
</P>
<P>
The survey also had some other noteworthy findings, including
that women are more supportive of the Web rating system than their
male counterparts and that the support rate is particularly high
among young and better educated respondents.

JAPAN TO REVISE LAW TO GRANT VISA-FREE ENTRY FOR ROC CITIZENS
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Tokyo,  Nov. 28 (CNA)
(By Amy Huang and Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Japan will revise its entry and exit law to
pave the way for granting visa-free privilege to Taiwan citizens for
six months starting from March 2005, the Japanese Yomiuri Shimbun
daily reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The temporary visa-free measure is mainly aimed at attracting
more Taiwan visitors to the EXPO 2005 Aichi -- an eco-friendly world
exposition to be held in the Japanese prefecture Aichi March 25-Sept.
25, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
According to the paper, the Japanese government will consider
whether to permanently offer visa-free entry to Taiwan citizens based
on the implementation results during the six-month period.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan has long offered visa-free entry to Japanese citizens.
Japan has so far not reciprocated because under the current Japanese
exit and entry law, the Japanese government can only offer visa-free
privilege to citizens of countries with which Japan maintains
diplomatic relations.
</P>
<P>
As Japan switched diplomatic recognition from Taipei to Beijing
in 1972, offering visa-free privilege to Republic of China citizens
requires an amendment to its existing law. The Japanese government
has decided to add a clause to the law allowing citizens from
"officially designated areas" to enjoy the same visa-free privilege,
according to previous media reports.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan has been Japan's second largest tourist source after South
Korea and the number of Taiwan visitors to Japan is expected to break
the 1 million mark this year.
</P>
<P>
Japan intends to attract 1.5 million foreign visitors to the EXPO
2005 Aichi, with 300,000 or one-fifth of visitors expected to come
from Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi took the initiative to
tell Lee Yuan-tseh, Taiwan's representative to the Nov. 20-21
informal leadership meeting of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation
forum in Santiago, Chile, that his administration has tentatively
decided to offer visa-free entry to ROC citizens during the Aichi
expo period.
</P>
<P>
The Yomiuri Shimbun reported Sunday that the Japanese government
will refer a draft law revision bill to the Diet early next year for
the proposed visa-free privilege for Taiwan citizens.
</P>
<P>
A total of 122 countries and many international organizations,
including the United Nations and its affiliates, will exhibit
eco-friendly technologies and products at the Aichi expo.

Democratic Progressive Party's (DPP's) candidate for the Dec. 11
legislative elections in the Hualien County constituency in eastern
Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Chen's statement came a day after an opposition party chairman
warned that if the "pan-green" camp of the DPP and the Taiwan
Solidarity Union wins a clear majority in the new legislature, the
VAC would definitely be phased out.
</P>
<P>
Chen said he felt regret that the opposition politician had made
such a false and irresponsible claim simply for instigating retired
soldiers' anti-government and anti-A-bian (Chen's nickname)
sentiments and thus winning their votes in the upcoming elections.
</P>
<P>
Chen said the Cabinet's restructuring plan complies with the
general world trend and is aimed at upgrading administrative
efficiency and Taiwan's overall competitiveness in the global market.
</P>
<P>
The United States, Japan, Great Britain and France far outpace
Taiwan in terms of their spaces and populations but the numbers of
their government departments are less than Taiwan's, Chen said,
adding that Taiwan must streamline its government structure to cut
red tape and enhance operational efficiency.
</P>
<P>
According to the Cabinet's restructuring plan, its current 36
departments will be integrated into 13 ministries plus four
commissions and five independent agencies.
</P>
<P>
While the number of Cabinet agencies will be trimmed, Chen said,
the VAC will not disappear. "Instead, it will be upgraded to merge
with the MND to become the Ministry of National Defense and Veterans
Affairs," Chen explained.
</P>
<P>
He further said the existing veterans hospitals and sheltering
centers for elderly veterans will never be phased out as the
opposition politician has claimed. Moreover, he said the government
will further improve welfare services and care for retired military
servicemen.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Chen said Taiwan now has five ethnic groups -- native
Taiwanese, Hakka, Aborigines, mainlanders and naturalized foreigners.
</P>
<P>
"Despite our ethnic diversity, we should stand united to
safeguard national security. National unity is critical to
sustainable national development. All of the residents on this
island, regardless of their ethnic origins and birth places, are
masters of Taiwan. This country neither has oppressors nor the
oppressed," Chen added.
</P>
<P>
He also reminded local people that the Republic of China existed
in mainland China before 1949, moved its seat to Taiwan in 1949 and
has since taken roots in Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
"Nowadays, the Republic of China refers to Taiwan and Taiwan
refers to the Republic of China, " Chen said, adding that the two
terms are identical. "We must have a clear understanding of national
identity, then we can love this land and love this country.

CABINET ASSIGNS 40 ADDITIONAL POLICE OFFICERS TO WORK IN TAICHUNG
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Nov.  28 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Premier Yu Shyi-kun has directed the
Ministry of the Interior (MOI) to assign 40 more police officers to
work in Taichung to help improve the central Taiwan city's public
order, Cabinet spokesman Chen Chi-mai said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Chen said the premier gave the directive after Taichung City
Mayor Jason Hu asked the central government to deploy 20 additional
police officers in Taichung earlier in the day. Hu made the request
after two men were killed and three others injured in a Mafia-style
shootout in a teahouse in Taichung City the previous day.
</P>
<P>
Hu attributed the city's deteriorating order and rising crime
rate mainly to its insufficient police force. However, Chen said
Taichung's police force does fall behind that in other major Taiwan
cities. In Taichung, a police officer serves an average of 420
citizens, compared to 426 in Tainan City and 418 in Hsinchu City.
</P>
<P>
"In response to Hu's request, Premier Yu has instructed the MOI
to deploy 40 more police officers in Taichung. The figure doubles the
Hu-requested number," Chen said, adding that the Cabinet hopes Mayor
Hu can take immediate steps to improve the city's public order and
safeguard people's personal safety.
</P>
<P>
Chen pointed out that major reasons behind Taichung's worsening
public order and mounting crime rate lie in the city's rampant sex
trade and underground companies specializing in using violent means
to coercing debtors to repay debts.
</P>
<P>
In his view, Chen said the Taichung City Government should target
those special businesses and areas for intensified crackdown in order
to improve the city's public order and curb its crime rate.

War II, Lee said the international community should not sit idle
while Taiwan is being suppressed diplomatically and threatened
militarily by mainland China.
</P>
<P>
"The 23 million peace-loving Taiwan people have set a model in
establishing a prosperous vibrant democracy over the past five
decades and the world should respect Taiwan people's desire to build
a normal, complete country, " Lee said, adding that Taiwan's
sovereignty belongs to the 23 million people living on this island,
not to Beijing.
</P>
<P>
The international community should assist in resolving this
sovereignty dispute then can Asia have permanent peace, Lee said.
</P>
<P>
He further said he is pleased to learn that all foreign scholars
participating in the seminar supporting Taiwan's drive to write a new
constitution that fits the island's present status quo to facilitate
its sustainable national development.
</P>
<P>
After to days of discussions, Lee said, the theoretical basis for
the campaign to rectify Taiwan's name and write a new constitution
has become firmer and clearer. He further said he will dedicate the
rest of his life to push for realization of the goal.

New York Times:
Parliament says votes in Ukraine were
not valid

Ukraine's Parliament, meeting in a stormy
special session, voted overwhelmingly Saturday
that last Sunday's presidential runoff did not
reflect the will of the people, and more
narrowly to declare the results invalid. But the
legislators failed to set a date for a new
election. Parliament, the Supreme Rada, does not
have the authority to overturn the election
results, which according to the government, made
Prime Minister Viktor F. Yanukovich the
country's next president. But the vote - even
the debate itself - signaled the swelling
dissatisfaction over an election marred by
accusations of wholesale fraud.

Wall Street Journal: Ukrainian Parliament
declares Presidential Election invalid

Ukraine's Parliament on Saturday declared
invalid the disputed presidential election that
triggered a week of growing street protests and
legal maneuvers, raising the possibility that a
new vote could be held in this former Soviet
republic. Parliament's decision isn't binding,
but it clearly demonstrated rising
dissatisfaction with the announced outcome. The
U.S. and other Western nations contend the vote
was marred by massive fraud.

1999: The ROC Navy takes delivery of the YTB-51, a new locally
built harbor tugboat, as part of its warship modernization program.

one must have standards. None has yet accomplished anything without
them. The gentlemen fulfilling their duties as generals and
councilors have their standards. Even the artisans performing their
tasks have their standards."

DPP CAUCUS AGAIN CALLS FOR KMT TO CHANGE PARTY EMBLEM
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Nov.  29 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The legislative caucus of the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) again on Monday called for the
opposition Kuomintang (KMT) to change its party emblem to avoid any
confusion with the national emblem of the Republic of China.
</P>
<P>
Noting that changing the ROC national emblem would be much more
difficult a matter than changing the KMT's party emblem, DPP party
whip Tsai Huang-liang said that it is the KMT's duty to differentiate
its party emblem from that of the nation.
</P>
<P>
Tsai quoted President Chen Shui-bian as saying at a campaign
rally the day before that if the KMT stubbornly refuses to change its
emblem, the DPP will then take action to force it to do so once the
"pan-green camp" of the DPP and the Taiwan Solidarity Union wins a
majority in the Legislative Yuan in the Dec. 11 elections.
</P>
<P>
President Chen Shui-bian said one week ago at a DPP campaign
rally that the KMT party emblem is "too close" to the national emblem
on the ROC national flag and that he would like to have the KMT
change its party emblem to avoid confusion.
</P>
<P>
Responding to the president's calls, Executive Yuan spokesman
Chen Chi-mai said that the government will see to it that the
National Emblem Law is amended in three months to pave the way for
the government to legally require the KMT to change its party emblem.
</P>
<P>
Chen Chi-mai added that the revised National Emblem Law will be
much clearer than the existing one and will have exact punishments
set out for violators.
</P>
<P>
According to Chen Chi-mai, the government will move to have the
National Emblem Law revised to make it illegal for any political
party, private organization or business group to use the national
symbol commercially. The revision will state that the symbol is
national property and that only the government has the legal right to
its use.
</P>
<P>
In response to President Chen's demand that the KMT change its
party logo in three months, KMT spokesman Chang Jung-kung said the
next day that the president does not need to wait three months,
because "we are not changing anything."
</P>
<P>
Chang said that the KMT party emblem is a form of property with
history and is protected by the ROC Constitution. "Only by showing
respect for history, the law and the opposition can the Republic of
China prove itself to be a nation of law and order," Chang argued.
</P>
<P>
Chang called for President Chen not to use the state apparatus to
suppress the opposition and stop using destructive rhetoric during
the current election campaign season.

'PAN-BLUE ALLIANCE' APPEALS COURT RULING ON CASE AGAINST PRESIDENT
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Nov. 29 (CNA)
(By Y.F. Low)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The opposition "pan-blue alliance" of the
Kuomintang (KMT) and People First Party (PFP) Monday appealed a court
ruling which rejected their bid to annul the re-election of President
Chen Shui-bian and his running mate, Vice President Annette Lu.
</P>
<P>
Lodging the appeal with the Supreme Court, a "pan-blue" legal
team led by lawyer Lee Tzung-teh claimed that the Taiwan High Court
ruling was based on a misconstruction of the law, improper grounds
and inadequate review of evidence.
</P>
<P>
The Taiwan High Court on Nov. 4 ruled that "pan-blue"
presidential candidate Lien Chan and his running mate, James Soong,
failed to prove their claims that the ballot counting in the March 20
election was not accurate and that Chen and Lu had deliberately
prevented some voters from exercising their right to vote.
</P>
<P>
Lee argued that the high court had misconstrued the meaning of
"inaccurate vote count" set down in the President and Vice President
Election and Recall Law by only examining whether the vote count was
correct and whether there was a mix-up of valid and invalid ballots.
</P>
<P>
Lee said the court did not check if any of the ballots were cast
by a fill-in, by a voter who had already voted once, by someone with
no right to vote, or by a phantom voter.
</P>
<P>
He accused the high court of ignoring the scientific evidence
presented by the plaintiffs and adopting a report by U.S. forensic
expert Henry Lee as the only basis in determining that the March 19
shooting of Chen and Lu was not a political ploy to win sympathy
votes.
</P>
<P>
In addition, he said, the high court did not review crucial facts
such as the lists of registered voters, evidence related to the
election-eve shooting and evidence concerning the activation of the
"national security mechanism" after the shooting.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the move by the "pan-blue alliance, " ruling
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) spokesman Cheng Wen-tsang
questioned the opposition's purpose in filing an appeal when it
continues to suspect that there is political interference in the
judicial system.
</P>
<P>
Cheng said most of the points raised by the "pan-blue alliance"
to support its appeal suit were already clarified during hearings
held by the high court.
</P>
<P>
Tsai Huang-liang, whip of the DPP legislative caucus, said Lien
and Soong are only trying to evade their responsibility in losing the
election by dragging out the legal process.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Lee Shang-ren, director of the Taiwan Solidarity
Union's policy center, urged Lien and Soong to admit their defeat and
step down from the leadership of the KMT and PFP to facilitate a
rebirth of the two parties.

PRIVATE INVESTORS WELCOME TO BUILD OFFSHORE DESALINATION PLANTS
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Nov. 29 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The private sector is welcome to invest in
the building of desalination plants in offshore areas to help the
government redress water supply problems in these particular areas,
the Council of Economic Planning and Development (CEPD) reported
Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Cabinet-level CEPD convened a meeting Monday, exclusively on
the development of desalination plants on the islands of Penghu,
Kinmen and Matsu, where drought often occurs and where the number of
suitable sites for building dams or reservoirs is limited.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, according to CEPD officials, Premier Yu
Shyi-kun gave a three-point directive to facilitate the development
of desalination plants in order to redress the water supply problem
in the three offshore areas.
</P>
<P>
In accordance with the government's plans of encouraging the
private sector to take part in public construction and development
projects, Yu said, private investors are welcome to build
desalination plants on these three islands, adding that firstly, they
will be allowed to operate other related businesses that will help
lower their overall costs in building and operating the desalination
plants.
</P>
<P>
Secondly, Yu said, the desalinated water that the private
investors produce will be bought back by the government at guaranteed
prices. In Kinmen and Matsu, the central government will offer
subsidies to the private desalination plants to make up for their
income shortfalls, while in Penghu, water prices will be finalized
after the desalination plant investors negotiate with the Taiwan
Water Co.
</P>
<P>
Thirdly, the desalination plants should be built on public lands,
Yu said, adding that if no suitable sites on public lands are
available, then private lands will be acquired at the government's
expense.
</P>
<P>
The Water Resources Agency (WRA) under the Ministry of Economic
Affairs has been placed in charge of the desalination plant
development project.
</P>
<P>
Under the project, the WRA plans to have a desalination plant
with a production capacity of 2,000 tons of fresh water per day built
in each of Kinmen and Matsu, and a plant capable of producing 10,000
tons of fresh water per day built in Penghu.

'PAN-GREEN CAMP' CAN WIN 113 SEATS IN UPCOMING ELECTIONS: DPP POLL
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Nov.  29  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The "pan-green camp" of the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) and the Taiwan Solidarity Union
(TSU) will be able to win a total of 113 seats in the Dec. 11
legislative elections, a DPP official predicted Monday.
</P>
<P>
Pan Yi-hsuan, director of the DPP's Public Opinion Survey Center,
said his estimate was based on the results of the party's latest
public opinion poll.
</P>
<P>
According to the poll results, Pan said, the DPP can win an
estimated 97 seats, including regional, at-large and overseas
community seats, while the TSU can win 16 seats.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, she said, the opposition "pan-blue alliance" of the
Kuomintang (KMT), the People First Party (PFP) and the New Party will
capture 98 seats, with the KMT garnering 67 seats, the PFP 30 seats
and the New Party one seat.
</P>
<P>
Quoting the results of the latest DPP survey, Pan said the
Non-Partisan Solidarity Union (NPSU) will be able to win seven seats
and the remaining seven seats in the 225-seat legislature will be
snatched by independents.
</P>
<P>
In the 2001 legislative elections, the "pan-green camp" won 100
seats (87 DPP seats plus 13 TSU seats) ; the "pan-blue alliance" took
115 seats (68 KMT seats plus 46 PFP seats and one New Party seat) ;
the NPSU secured seven seats; and the remaining three seats were
captured by independents.
</P>
<P>
According to the DPP's estimate, Pan said, the "pan-green camp"
can seize 13 more seats this time around, while the number of seats
to be secured by the "pan-blue alliance" could decline by 17 from the
2001-level.
</P>
<P>
Pan said the DPP has so far conducted three large-scale opinion
surveys to gauge the various political groups' election prospects.
</P>
<P>
"The survey results show that the numbers of seats to be won by
the PFP and the New Party remain almost the same in all three polls,
while the KMT shows a downward trend, " Pan said, adding that any
decline in the number of KMT seats could be attributed to the fact
that some of their supporters have turned to support several noted
independent hopefuls, such as Li Ao, Cheng Li-wen and Shih Ming-teh.
</P>
<P>
In contrast, Pan said the "pan-green camp's" support rate has
been rising steadily thanks to President Chen Shui-bian's
barnstorming-style campaign and the camp's joint campaign and ballot
allocation strategies.

INTERNET RATING FOUNDATION INAUGURATED
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,   Nov.   29  (CNA)
(By Wayne Lee)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A foundation set up jointly by
representatives from the government, Internet portal operators and
public interest groups to enforce an Internet rating system was
inaugurated Monday, according to the Government Information Office
(GIO).
</P>
<P>
The foundation, named the Taiwan Internet Content Promotion
Foundation, whose goal is to create a safe Web environment to protect
underaged Internet surfers from illegal Web content, will attempt to
implement a rating system similar to the ones used for TV, movies
and publications, said GIO Director-General Lin Chia-lung.
</P>
<P>
The rating system will require local Web site operators to mark
out "restricted" sites inappropriate for children and adolescents and
help parents set up codes on their computers to prevent younger
family members from gaining access to certain sites, Lin said.
</P>
<P>
In 2004, the number of Internet surfers aged under 12 has reached
1.06 million and more than 92 percent of children aged between 12 and
15 have Internet experience, according to statistics released by the
GIO.
</P>
<P>
The establishment of the foundation is a three-month effort by
the public interest groups and the government, which also promulgated
regulations regarding Web content ratings in April.
</P>
<P>
Most people, particularly women and the well-educated, are
opening their arms to the notion of Internet rating, with the results
of a survey conducted by the GIO earlier this month showing that more
than 85 percent of the respondents support such a rating system.
</P>
<P>
Lai Fei-pi, an electrical engineering professor from National
Taiwan University, was elected the foundation's chairman of the board
of directors by the board members, who include representatives of the
GIO, Chunghwa Telecom Co., and Microsoft Taiwan.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Both the ruling Democratic Progressive
Party (DPP) and opposition Kuomintang (KMT) are set to hold
large-scale rallies at the weekend in a last-ditch effort to boost
their chances in the Dec. 11 legislative elections.
</P>
<P>
DPP Secretary-General Lee Ying-yuan said his party plans to
gather 100,000 supporters for a rally scheduled for Saturday in
Taipei.
</P>
<P>
He said the rally will take the form of a carnival displaying the
theme of "protecting Taiwan for its well-being."
</P>
<P>
That evening, both President Chen Shui-bian and former President
Lee Teng-hui will attend another DPP rally in Kaohsiung to promote
their goal of having the "pan-green camp" of the DPP and Taiwan
Solidarity Union win a majority of the seats in the Legislative Yuan.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, the DPP will send campaign jeeps around the central
counties of Taichung, Changhua and Nantou to drum up support for its
candidates.
</P>
<P>
Not to be outdone, the KMT also plans to mobilize at least
100,000 supporters for a rally Sunday in Taipei to boost the morale
of the "pan-blue alliance" of the KMT and the People First Party.
</P>
<P>
KMT spokesman Chang Jung-kung said the rally will highlight the
theme of "uniting to protect the country and save Taiwan."
</P>
<P>
Chang said the KMT must stand up to safeguard the Republic of
China, claiming that the DPP has made evident its intention to
destroy the Republic of China over the past four-and-a-half years
since it came to power.
</P>
<P>
Chang accused the DPP of denying ROC history and ROC founding
father Sun Yat-sen of their due status and of attempting to change
the national emblem.

TAICHUNG ASKS CABINET TO BOOST CITY POLICE FORCE
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taichung, Nov. 29 (CNA)
(By Elizabeth Hsu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the face of deteriorating public order
in the central city of Taichung, Mayor Jason Hu appealed to the
central government Monday again for a boost in the number of police
assigned to his city.
</P>
<P>
At a meeting of top city officials, Hu complained that Taichung
has suffered a serious lack of police for years, saying that this is
why his administration has not been able to maintain order.
</P>
<P>
The city was shaken by yet another gangster shootout Saturday in
which two men were shot dead and three others were injured. The case
was the fourth to occur in Taichung in the last six months.
</P>
<P>
A day after the bloody shooting, Hu asked the central government
to deploy additional police officers in his city. He received a
response from the premier that same day, who directed the Ministry of
the Interior (MOI) to assign an additional 40 police officers to
Taichung.
</P>
<P>
The additional police force went on duty Monday, but Hu claimed
the 40-strong force is too small to clean up the city that has been
inundated with vicious criminals involved in prostitution, drugs,
gambling and illegal guns.
</P>
<P>
Hu cited the latest MOI report as saying that Taichung's crime
rate has been the highest among all cities around the country for the
past 12 years and complained that the central government has failed
to carry out a promise it made last year to supplement Taichung
City's police force to a ratio of 1: 350 -- with one police officer
serving every 350 citizens.
</P>
<P>
At present, there is only one police officer for every 420
citizens in Taichung, according to official statistics.
</P>
<P>
Hu added that criminal gangs are the cause of most major social
problems in Taichung. To improve public order, Hu suggested launching
a large-scale police operation in a time span of three to six months
to crack down on illegal organizations.
</P>
<P>
The mayor added that the relevant authorities would have to
mobilize some 3,000 to 4,000 personnel to effectively crack down on
crime in his city.

<P>
The Council of Labor Affairs (CLA) has not
fully ruled out the possibility of freezing imports of workers from
Vietnam in view of their high ratio of absconding, a CLA spokesman
said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Although the Vietnamese authorities sent officials to Taiwan to
help resolve the problem in October, the spokesman said the CLA has
not completely given up the idea of banning imports of Vietnamese
laborers to Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
The CLA has decided to temporarily stop allowing in more
Vietnamese workers and will continue to gauge the situation before
making a final decision, he said.
</P>
<P>
Citing statistics provided by the Vietnamese authorities, Kuo
Fang-yu, director-general of the CLA's Employment and Vocational
Training Administration, said that the Vietnamese authorities helped
track down more than 260 Vietnamese laborers on the run in Taiwan in
the first two weeks of this month, with a further 100 found in the
third week.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan government statistics show that as of the end of
September, more than 7,900 Vietnamese workers had absconded from
their workplace.
</P>
<P>
Vietnamese laborers had recorded an absconding rate of 9.39
percent as of the end of August, markedly higher than the 2.5 percent
and 1.6 percent of workers from the Philippines and Thailand,
respectively.

At present, there are more than 300,000 foreign workers in

TAIWAN TO SEEK INTERNATIONAL COOPERATION IN RECYCLING NUCLEAR WASTE
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Nov.  29  (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taiwan needs to cooperate with the
international community in recycling its nuclear waste, the chairman
of the Cabinet-level Council of Atomic Energy (CAE) said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Ou Yang Ming-sheng made the remarks in a two-day Taiwan-Japan
seminar on nuclear safety that opened in Taipei Monday.
</P>
<P>
The seminar is being sponsored by the Taiwan Power Co.
(Taipower), with 21 Japanese delegates led by Susumu Takato,
executive vice president of Chugoku Electric Power Company and around
150 delegates from Taipower, CAE and the Institute of Nuclear Energy
Research participating.
</P>
<P>
Ou Yang noted that there are more than 50 nuclear generator units
in Japan and that the country is more advanced than Taiwan in terms
of nuclear safety, nuclear waste storage, low-radioactive nuclear
waste disposal and the recycling of nuclear waste.
</P>
<P>
Takato, for his part, noted that Japan is short on energy
resources and has had to make long-term planning for energy, as well
as promoting energy and nuclear power education.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Japan is also taking steps to recycle its nuclear
waste with the aim of cutting down on the purchase of uranium, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Ou Yang said that the uranium Taiwan uses in nuclear power plants
can be recycled repeatedly if the country had the relevant
sophisticated technology.
</P>
<P>
He said that although a recycling factory for nuclear waste in
Japan has yet to be completed, Japan has enough nuclear waste to make
such a venture viable, while Taiwan's three nuclear power plants with
six generating units do not produce enough nuclear waste to carry out
recycling on a commercial scale.
</P>
<P>
For this reason, he went on, Taiwan needs to cooperate with the
international community to make recycling possible, on a mutually
beneficial basis.
</P>
<P>
He said that when the amount of nuclear waste produced in Taiwan
becomes commercially viable, its handling would be better dealt with
through international cooperation, pointing out that both France and
Russia have sophisticated technology in this field.
</P>
<P>
According to figures produced by the CAE's Fuel Cycle and
Materials Administration, there are currently 97,672 barrels of
nuclear waste stored on outlying Orchid Island, with a further 86,254
barrels stored at the country's three nuclear power plants.

TV, RADIO ELECTION CAMPAIGN ADS TO BE BANNED FROM DEC. 1
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Nov.  29 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Television and radio stations will be
banned from broadcasting legislative election campaign commercials
from Dec. 1, when the 10-day official campaign period for the Dec. 11
legislative elections will begin, the Central Election Commission
(CEC) said Monday.
</P>
<P>
"From Dec. 1, political parties, individual legislative
candidates and third parties will be prohibited from airing
commercials on TV and radio channels, " said CEC Chairman Chang
Cheng-hsiung.
</P>
<P>
From that date, Chang went on, TV and radio stations will also be
prohibited from campaigning for any individual candidates in their
programs.
</P>
<P>
According to the television and radio broadcasting law, Chang
said, violators will face fines. The fines for cable TV stations
could reach a maximum of NT$500,000, while law-breaking terrestrial
TV stations could be slapped with fines of up to NT$1 million.
</P>
<P>
Chang made the remarks after opposition Kuomintang and People
First Party legislative whips -- Huang Teh-fu, Huang Chao-shun, Liu
Wen-hsiung and Lee Tung-hao -- paid a visit to the CEC to gain a
better understanding of the ban on TV and radio campaign commercials
during the official campaign period.
</P>
<P>
Chang said the law requires TV and radio stations to deal with
news events regarding individual candidates and their parties
impartially and fairly. The law also forbids them from broadcasting
campaign commercials put up by individual candidates, political
parties or third parties during the official campaign period. TV and
radio stations are also not allowed to campaign for any parties or
candidates in their programs during the period, Chang explained.
</P>
<P>
From Dec. 1, Chang said the Government Information Office (GIO)
will closely monitor all TV and radio news programs. If any are found
to have violated the principles of fairness and impartiality, the GIO
will send the monitoring videotapes to the CEC for review.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Chang said, all CEC commission members will meet Dec.
1 to more clearly set out standards for determining whether a TV or
radio program has violated the "no campaign" regulations and whether
news programs have been fair and impartial.

<P>
Restrictions on the entry of the mainland
Chinese spouses of foreign professionals are to be further eased,
Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) Vice Chairman Chiu Tai-san said
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Chiu made the remarks after MAC commissioners passed a package of
revisions to the regulations governing the entry to Taiwan of
mainland Chinese citizens at a meeting held earlier in the day.
</P>
<P>
According to the revised rules, such mainland spouses will no
longer be required to give up their mainland passports or other
travel papers to the Taiwan authorities.
</P>
<P>
Under the new rules, foreign professionals' direct supervisors or
their corporate CEOs, regardless of nationality, can serve as
guarantors of their mainland spouses. According to the existing law,
guarantors can only be Taiwan nationals and must meet many other
qualifications.
</P>
<P>
Chiu said the relaxation is a response to a request by the
European Chamber of Commerce in Taipei, which asked the government
earlier this year to ease the restrictions.
</P>
<P>
The new rules will be implemented after the Cabinet endorses them
in the near future, Chiu said, adding that the MAC hopes the eased
rules will make Taiwan more attractive to foreign high-tech
professionals.

FM URGES AUSTRALIA NOT TO INTERFERE IN VANUATU'S INTERNAL AFFAIRS
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei, Nov. 29 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Minister of Foreign Affairs Tan Sun Chen
said Monday he called in Australia's representative to Taipei
recently to urge Australia not to interfere with Vanuatu's decision
to forge diplomatic ties with Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Citing wire service reports that Canberra is cutting its aid to
Vanuatu, Chen claimed this is evidence that Australia is currying
favor with Beijing by leaning on the South Pacific state to renege on
its diplomatic ties with Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Chen said he has told Australia's representative to Taipei that
Canberra should not poke its nose into Vanuatu's ties with Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Noting that Beijing is offering Vanuatu aid of US$32 million per
year in an attempt to dissuade it from entering diplomatic ties with
Taiwan, Chen said Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Kao Ying-mao, who
is in Port Vila, the capital of Vanuatu, will see to it that Vanuatu
does not reverse it decision.
</P>
<P>
Although the diplomatic war-of-tug between Taiwan and mainland
China is still going on in Vanuatu, Chen claimed his ministry has
neither put a foot wrong nor has it lost anything thus far, while the
mainland is almost at the end of its wits about how to woo Vanuatu.
</P>
<P>
The minister urged the public to give Taiwan's diplomats a big
hand for their struggle with Beijing over Vanuatu.
</P>
<P>
Vanuatu Prime Minister Serge Vohor visited Taipei and forged an
agreement Nov. 4 to set up diplomatic ties with Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Refusing to accept the fact, Beijing has since scrambled to
dissuade Port Vila from recognizing Taipei, even though Taiwan
diplomats have already arrived there and have raised the country's
flag at their hotel to mark the inception of diplomatic ties between
the two countries.

TAIWAN TO ALLOW SECURITIES FIRMS TO INVEST IN MAINLAND CHINA
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,   Nov.  29  (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The government will allow domestic
securities companies to invest in their mainland China counterparts,
according to a revised draft regulation passed Monday by the
Cabinet-level Mainland Affairs Council (MAC).
</P>
<P>
MAC Vice Chairman Chiu Tai-san said that under the new
regulations, which still need to be approved by the Executive Yuan,
securities firms that meet the following qualifications will be
allowed to invest in mainland securities firms:
</P>
<P>
-- Their net worth published in their latest financial reports
should exceed NT$7 billion (US$217.39 million) and should exceed
their capital stocks. In addition, the securities firms should not
have been disciplined by the Financial Supervisory Commission, the
Taiwan Stock Exchange, the Gretai Securities Market or the
Taiwan Futures Exchange for a specific time period.
</P>
<P>
-- The capital adequacy ratio of the securities companies over
the past three months should be higher than 200 percent; and
</P>
<P>
-- In terms of investment ceilings, the securities companies
should not invest more than 10 percent of their net worth and the
holding shares should not be less than 25 percent of the total shares
issued by the mainland securities firms.
</P>
<P>
The MAC estimated that 16 domestic securities firms will meet the
qualifications.
</P>
<P>
However, Chiu noted that at the present stage, the mainland
insists on signing a memorandum of understanding (MOU) on
cross-strait financial supervision before it will allow Taiwan
securities firms to invest there.
</P>
<P>
But he said that judging from the experience of other countries,
signing an MOU with the host government will not necessarily
guarantee the supervisory operations.
</P>
<P>
Chiu expressed the hope that the mainland authorities will accept
the goodwill of Taiwan and revise its regulations so that the talent
and resources of Taiwan securities firms can make inroads into the
mainland soon.

TAIPOWER FACING CHALLENGES, DIFFICULTIES: GENERAL MANAGER
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,   Nov.  29  (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The state-run Taiwan Power Company
(Taipower) is facing transformation difficulties and rising operating
costs, so much so that simply increasing electricity fee may not be
enough to deal with the situation, a company executive said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Taipower General Manager Chen Kuei-ming made the remarks at the
19th Taiwan-Japan nuclear power security seminar while giving a
speech on the company's business prospects and development direction.
</P>
<P>
Chen said that the company will focus on high-efficiency and
cost-effective power generation and will devote itself to
diversification and globalization in its pursuit of privatization.
</P>
<P>
Vowing that Taipower will continue to increase power supplies in
line with government policy by improving infrastructure and promoting
alternative energy sources, Chen, however, pointed out that the
company is facing critical problems on a number of fronts, including
market liberalization, privatization, rising costs and the handling
of nuclear waste.
</P>
<P>
According to Chen, the government's legislation on nuclear power
security and relevant facilities has made noticeable progress in
recent years, but the issue of nuclear waste disposal has long been a
major headache for the company and its biggest challenge.
</P>
<P>
In an effort to satisfy the country's growing demand for power,
Taipower will have to increase its supply by 4 percent each year over
the next 10 years, he said, pointing out that if expenditure on
infrastructure improvement projects are added, the company will have
to spend more than NT$100 billion (about US$3 billion) per year.
</P>
<P>
To serve that end, he went on, Taipower needs to build sound
finances. However, troubled by continuously rising fuel prices, in
particular the price of coal, in the international market, the
company has come under strong financial pressure, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Chen said the company will not be able to meet its profit target
for this year, given the fact that it has had to pay extra fuel costs
to the tune of NT$20 billion.
</P>
<P>
If Taipower cannot recoup the additional spending, the company is
set to report a loss next year -- the first of its kind since it
began operations in 1946, he added.
</P>
<P>
Despite the fact that the company has not yet made a final
decision on when to raise its power rates, he predicted that an
adjustment might be necessary in order to sustain its operations.
However, he stressed that the company will take public opinion,
national development and its own business into detailed account when
mulling a rate hike.

CONSTITUTIONAL REFORMS WILL NOT INVOLVE INDEPENDENCE/UNIFICATION
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Nov. 29 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The constitutional re-engineering project
promoted by President Chen Shui-bian will not involve the issue of
independence or unification with mainland China, an official of the
ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) reiterated Monday.
</P>
<P>
Wang Shu-fen, director of the DPP's Department of Chinese
Affairs, made the remarks while attending a peace forum sponsored by
the Foundation on International and Cross-strait Studies.
</P>
<P>
Wang noted that Chen said in his May 20 inauguration speech that
he would abide by his "four noes plus one" pledge of his first
inaugural speech in 2000 -- referring to no declaration of
independence as long as Beijing does not use force to take Taiwan, no
change of the nation's name, no introduction of the "state-to-state"
theory in the Constitution, no referendum on the issue of
independence or unification, and no abolition of the National
Unification Guidelines.
</P>
<P>
The president also pledged in May that the constitutional
re-engineering project will not touch upon national sovereignty,
territory or the subject of independence/unification before the
nation reaches a consensus on these issues, she said.
</P>
<P>
Wang said the president's pledges on national sovereignty,
territory, and the subject of unification vs independence were not
simply expedient remarks and that the "four noes plus one" is
unlikely to change.
</P>
<P>
She noted that a new constitution that the party wants to write
will be aimed not at handling the issue of independence vs
unification and not at resolving cross-strait relations, but will
concern the election system and party politics, the relations between
the executive and legislative branches, the checks-and-balances
mechanism, and the relationship between central and local government.
</P>
<P>
She said Beijing need not question the sincerity of the DPP in
pushing for cross-strait exchanges and the resumption of cross-strait
dialogues, nor should it have rejected the many peace overtures
extended by the DPP administration since 2000.
</P>
<P>
She said the peoples on both sides of the Taiwan Strait have
different views on Taiwan's national sovereignty issue, but a respect
for the status quo along with both sides working on their internal
and cross-strait development would meet the aspirations of the
international community and would be in the best interests of both
sides of the strait.
</P>
<P>
The participants in the forum were mostly positive about Hsu's
remarks.
</P>
<P>
Tamkang University Professor Chang Wu-yueh said that if the
constitutional reforms promoted by the DPP renege on Chen's
inauguration pledges, it will be difficult to expect a good response
from Beijing, but if they stick to the president's promises, then the
cross-strait risks should be under control.

IMPACT OF RISING LOCAL CURRENCY NEEDS TO BE HEEDED: SCHOLARS
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Nov.  29 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A rising new Taiwan dollar may lead to a
worsening in the competitive edge of local companies and a flight of
Taiwan capital, according to scholars and industry sources.
</P>
<P>
Kung Ming-hsin, a division chief at the Taiwan Institute of
Economic Research (ITRI) , said that the price of many Taiwan-made
products quoted in U.S. dollars for export to other countries, except
for the United States, will still become lower on a rapidly falling
greenback due to different currency exchange rates.
</P>
<P>
Although export-oriented Taiwan companies operating in mainland
China will benefit from a cheaper renminbi -- which is closely pegged
to the U.S. dollar -- Kung pointed out, however, that businesses
based at home will become increasingly less competitive.
</P>
<P>
In addition, he warned against a negative impact on Taiwan's
overall economic development in the face of a possible capital flight
to the mainland.
</P>
<P>
Lo Huai-chia, an executive of the Taiwan Electrical and
Electronic Manufacturers's Association, said that, however, that the
impact on Taiwan exporters will be little, as many of them are
producing in mainland China and delivering their products from there.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the new Taiwan dollar ended at NT$32.155 against the
U.S. dollar Monday on the Taipei foreign exchange market, down by
NT$0.06 from Friday's finish, amid rampant rumors that the
Taipei-based Central Bank of China had intervened.
</P>
<P>
S. T. Chen, general manager of the Chinatrust Commercial Bank,
said that the chances are high that the mainland currency will go up
in value. But he added that it is hard to predict the precise timing
and range, on the grounds that the mainland authorities will have the
final say rather than market forces on the issue.
</P>
<P>
ITRI President Wu Rong-i forecast last week that an appreciation
of the renminbi is just a matter of time under strong pressure from
the United States, Japan and the European Union to cool down the
mainland's overheated economy.
</P>
<P>
Although speculation over a stronger mainland currency has fueled
an influx of hot money into the Asian market, pushing up the new
Taiwan dollar and keeping some pressure on the domestic export
sector, Wu said that the rising new Taiwan dollar has in turn diluted
growing inflationary pressure at home.
</P>
<P>
According to Wu, the rise in value of the local currency has
offset some increased costs of imported products. He forecast that
the growth rate on Taiwan's wholesale price index will largely fall
to just about 2 percent for the whole of 2005 and that the consumer
price index will show slight growth of 1.9 percent.

ONSLAUGHT OF ALIEN RED FIRE ANTS UNDER CONTROL: CKS AIRPORT

<TEXT>
<P>
An onslaught of red fire ants at Chiang
Kai-shek International Airport, Taiwan's main gateway to the world,
has been brought under control and has not affected flight safety,
the director of the airport said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Wei Sheng-chi said that since the red ants -- an alien species
not native to Taiwan -- were found in the grass neighboring the
airport tarmac, the airport immediately started prevention measures,
checkings the cables of major facilities and navigation radar every
day to ensure they are not being destroyed by the imported pests.
</P>
<P>
However, when it was found that the ants had spread back to the
airport from the original area of infestation -- a township near
the airport -- the authorities began another wave of attack and
brought the ants under control with pesticide.
</P>
<P>
To effectively put an end to the threat of the pests, Wei said
the airport needs to cooperate with several villages of the adjacent
Tayuan township in Taoyuan County.
</P>
<P>
Wei made the statement amid media reports that the ant hazard has
caused problems with radar equipment and tarmac peripherals, which
could affect flight safety.

Five Taiwan feature films will make their
debuts Tuesday at the 35th India International Film Festival in Goa,
an island off the coast of western India, an official from the
Government Information Office (GIO) said Monday.
</P>
<P>
It is the first time that Taiwan-produced movies have been
screened in an Indian film festival and although they are not in
competition. They are being screened as part of the 5th Films in
Country Focus feature, which is designed to promote the understanding
of different countries through their films.
</P>
<P>
The five Taiwanese films chosen by the GIO to play at Goa
are all realistic depictions of local life and are excellent examples
of innovative narrative techniques, according to the anonymous GIO
official.
</P>
<P>
The first film, to be screened Tuesday, is Formula-17, by
Ying-jung Chen. Simon C. Hsieh, the director of the Information
Division of the Taipei Economic and Cultural Center in New Delhi,
will give a speech about the overall view of Taiwan's film industry
before the screening.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan is the only country whose films are being shown at this
year's country focus feature.
</P>
<P>
Noting that India has the world's largest movie audience, the GIO
official said Taiwan film makers are trying hard to make inroads into
the India market and that hopefully, the Goa festival will set them
off on the right foot.

15% OF LABORERS IN NOISY WORK CONDITIONS HAVE HEARING PROBLEMS: CLA

<TEXT>
<P>
Up to 15 percent of laborers who work in
noisy environments have impaired hearing that could affect their
language communication ability, according to the results of a survey
released Monday by the Council of Labor Affairs (CLA).
</P>
<P>
The impairment will increase with age, the CLA survey also found,
with 13 percent of those between 26 and 35 complaining of hearing
problems, while the ratio is 29 percent for those over 55.
</P>
<P>
The CLA's Institute of Occupational Safety and Health said that
the institute has collected hearing information on more than 37,000
laborers working under noisy conditions and has found that laborers
in three trades -- construction, rubber product manufacturing and the
textile sector -- suffer the highest hearing damage risks.
</P>
<P>
The hearing impairment is often exacerbated due to lack of
detection, and even when finally detected, might be beyond repair,
the institute said, urging employers to reduce noise levels in the
workplace and to provide annual hearing checks for workers.

ASEAN ASIAN TRADING BLOC PLAN WILL NOT AFFECT TAIWAN: MOE
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Nov.  29 (CNA)

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Minister of Economic Affairs Ho Mei-yueh
said Monday that a plan by the Association of Southeast Asian Nations
(ASEAN) to establish an Asian trading bloc will not have much effect
on Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
On the heels of the annual summit of the 10-member ASEAN plus
three other Asian countries -- mainland China, Japan, and South Korea
-- which opened that day in the Laotian capital of Vientiane, it was
reported that India may also be invited to take part in the trading
bloc, making a trade entity on a par with Europe and the United
States.
</P>
<P>
Asked whether Taiwan, as the only country left out, will become
economically marginalized, Ho was optimistic.
</P>
<P>
She said that although ASEAN plus three has set a grand goal of
making a free trade area, the differences among the countries are so
great that it will be difficult to achieve the goal.
</P>
<P>
She noted that many countries have become keen on economic
integration, mainly because the World Trade Organization (WTO) talks
in Cancun collapsed and they are worried about the slow progress of
the WTO, although regional integration will heighten the cost of
world trade.
</P>
<P>
She further said that the mainstay of Taiwan exports today is IT
products, and that over 70 percent of the IT product market countries
-- including Taiwan -- have signed Information Technology Agreements
enabling them to enjoy tariff-free treatment on IT products. No
matter which countries sign a free trade agreement, they will not
affect Taiwan's IT exports, she said.

U.S. OPPOSES ANY REFERENDUM ON MOVE TOWARD INDEPENDENCE: STATE DEPT.

<DATELINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The U.S. State Department responded
Monday to President Chen Shui-bian's recent remarks about holding a
referendum in 2006 on a new constitution for Taiwan, saying that
Washington opposes any changes to Taiwan's status or moves toward
independence through referendum.
</P>
<P>
"Our primary interest is in maintaining stability across the
Taiwan Strait, and the United States is opposed to any unilateral
steps that would change the status quo, " State Department spokesman
Richard Boucher said while responding to a reporter's question at a
daily press briefing.
</P>
<P>
"We are opposed to any referendum that would change Taiwan's
status or move towards independence," the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
President Chen said Nov. 27 that he will hold a referendum on a
new constitution for Taiwan in 2006 and that the new constitution
will be promulgated on May 20, 2008.
</P>
<P>
Chen also said that if the "pan-green camp, " which groups the
ruling Democratic Progressive Party and the Taiwan Solidarity Union,
is able to gain a majority in the Legislative Yuan in the Dec. 11
legislative elections, he will put an end to disorder in Taiwan,
including by creating a new constitution for Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Pointing out that President Chen had pledged in his inauguration
address in 2000 not to declare independence; not to change the name
of Taiwan's government; not to add the state-to-state theory to the
constitution; and not to promote a referendum on the issue of
independence versus unification, and that he reaffirmed the pledge in
his 2004 inauguration speech, Boucher said the United States
appreciates Chen's pledge and his subsequent reaffirmations of it.
</P>
<P>
"We take those reaffirmations and that pledge very seriously,
particularly as they apply to this referendum on a new constitution,"
he further said.
</P>
<P>
Emphasizing that Washington has always held the position that
cross-Taiwan Strait dialogue is important to peace and stability in
the Taiwan Strait area, Boucher said the U.S. administration has
consistently urged the two sides to work to resume dialogue.
</P>
<P>
"We believe that such efforts should continue. We do not support
Taiwan independence," he added.
</P>
<P>
Asked whether he sees President Chen's remarks on promoting a
referendum on a new constitution in 2006 as a violation of his
earlier pledge, Boucher said that Washington's view is that the
president's pledges "are very important and need to be respected."
</P>
<P>
"As far as whether any other ideas or proposals contradict that
or not, I think he'll have to explain," the spokesman added.

Asean leaders began their summit here

PRESIDENT CHEN STICKS FIRM TO HIS PLEDGE: PRESIDENTIAL OFFICE
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President Chen Shui-bian has reaffirmed his
commitment to maintaining the status quo across the Taiwan Strait on
many occasions, and that commitment will remain in place through the
rest of his term, Presidential Office Deputy Secretary-General James
Huang said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Huang was responding to remarks by U.S. State Department
spokesman Richard Boucher on Monday that Washington is "opposed to
any referendum that would change Taiwan's status or move towards
independence" and that it takes Chen's pledge very seriously.
</P>
<P>
Boucher reiterated the U.S. position after President Chen said
over the weekend that he would hold a referendum on a new
constitution for Taiwan in 2006.
</P>
<P>
Huang pointed out that Chen has reaffirmed his commitment to
maintaining the status quo on many occasions, such as in his
inauguration speech for a second term on May 20 and his National Day
address on Oct. 10.
</P>
<P>
This commitment will not change during the rest of President
Chen's term in office, Huang said.
</P>
<P>
Huang said that phasing out the National Assembly and allowing
for popular referendums on constitutional amendments is one of the
items in the proposed constitutional reform package passed by the
Legislative Yuan in August, and not a personal idea of President
Chen.
</P>
<P>
Huang said this new mechanism for amending the ROC Constitution
will not violate the pledge made by President Chen, who has
repeatedly emphasized that the constitutional re-engineering effort
will be carried out according to the existing constitutional system.
</P>
<P>
While promoting constitutional re-engineering in the future, the
government will step up its communication with the international
community in order to avoid any misunderstanding, Huang said.
</P>
<P>
Chen promised in his first inauguration address in 2000 that he
would not declare independence, not change the name of Taiwan's
government, not add the state-to-state theory to the ROC
Constitution, and not promote a referendum on the issue of
independence versus unification.

ROC ECONOMICS MINISTER TO VISIT U.S. CAPITAL NEXT WEEK
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Washington,  Nov. 29 (CNA)

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Republic of China Minister of Economic
Affairs Ho Mei-yueh is scheduled to arrive in Washington, D.C. Dec. 8
to attend an international seminar and meet with U.S. trade and
economics officials, business sources said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Ho will attend a seminar to be organized by the Institute for
International Economics, a noted U.S. think tank, and deliver a
speech to American business executives at the invitation of the
U.S.-Taiwan Business Council which groups U.S. companies with
interests in Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
This will be Ho's first visit to the U.S. capital since she
assumed her current post in May this year. During her stay, Ho is
also expected to meet with Bush administration officials from the
U.S. Trade Representative Office and the Department of Commerce, the
sources said.
</P>
<P>
Because of Beijing's diplomatic embargo against Taiwan, few ROC
ministers have been able to visit Washington, D.C. The ROC
representative office in the United States has remained low-key
concerning Ho's upcoming visit.
</P>
<P>
In a telephone interview with the CNA's Washington office Monday,
Ho confirmed reports about her forthcoming U.S. visit. Nevertheless,
she said her itinerary is still in the works.
</P>
<P>
Ho said the main purpose of her visit is to conduct direct
dialogue with representatives of major U.S. business groups, briefing
them on improvements in Taiwan's investment climate and lobbying U.S.
high-tech companies, particularly those in the biotechnology, digital
content and semiconductor industries, to use Taiwan as their Asian
operations hub.
</P>
<P>
As U.S. President George W. Bush is still organizing his new
administrative team for his second term, Ho said she is not sure at
the moment which U.S. officials she will meet during her upcoming
Washington visit.
</P>
<P>
Ho's visit marks yet another breakthrough in the high-level
Taiwan-U.S. economic exchanges following the re-opening Monday in the
U.S. capital of the sub-Cabinet-level trade consultations under the
bilateral Trade and Investment Framework Agreement (TIFA) after a
six-year hiatus.
</P>
<P>
The ongoing sub-Cabinet TIFA meeting is focusing on issues
regarding Taiwan's intellectual property rights (IPR) protection and
further liberalization of its telecommunication market. The meeting
is expected to achieve breakthroughs in some trade fields. If all
goes well, the United States is likely to remove Taiwan from its
Special 301 "priority watch" list for IPR violations monitoring next
spring.

CONSTITUTIONAL REFORM UNRELATED TO INDEPENDENCE: PREMIER
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Nov. 30 (CNA)
(By Y.F. Low)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The planned constitutional re-engineering
project in Taiwan will not involve issues of independence versus
unification, or a change of territorial boundaries or the country's
official name, Premier Yu Shyi-kun said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Yu noted that President Chen Shui-bian made the point very clear
in his inauguration speech for his second term on May 20, when the
president said he hoped to present the people of Taiwan with a new
constitution in 2008.
</P>
<P>
The purpose of the reform, as stated in the president's
inauguration address, is to achieve a constitution that is "timely,
relevant and viable," according to Yu.
</P>
<P>
Chen said over the weekend that he would hold a referendum in
2006 to let the people vote on the new constitution which, if
approved, would be implemented on May 20, 2008.
</P>
<P>
In response to this proposal, U.S. State Department spokesman
Richard Boucher reiterated on Monday that Washington is "opposed to
any referendum that would change Taiwan's status or move towards
independence" and that Washington takes Chen's May 20 pledge very
seriously.
</P>
<P>
Lee Ying-yuan, deputy secretary-general of the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party, said President Chen will never go back on his
pledges, which include not to declare independence, not to change the
name of the country, not to add the state-to-state theory to the
Republic of China Constitution, and not to promote a referendum on
the issue of independence versus unification.
</P>
<P>
President Chen has repeated many times that Taiwan is already an
independent sovereign state and does not require a referendum on
independence, Lee said.
</P>
<P>
As the majority of people in Taiwan are known to oppose
unification with mainland China, a referendum on unification is also
unnecessary, Lee added.
</P>
<P>
Opposition Kuomintang spokesman Chang Jung-kung said the United
States is concerned about Taiwan's plan to reform the ROC
Constitution because it is related to the question of whether a war
will break out across the Taiwan Strait.
</P>
<P>
Accusing President Chen of playing with words, Chang said Chen
has confused Washington as to whether he means to amend or redo the
ROC Constitution.

TAIWAN ECONOMIC GROWTH FORECAST AT 5% FOR 2005: CEPD

Taipei,   Nov.  30  (CNA)

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taiwan's economic growth rate and
unemployment rate for 2005 have been forecast at 5 percent and 4
percent, respectively, by the Cabinet-level Council for Economic
Planning and Development (CEPD).
</P>
<P>
The CEPD forecast that per-capita income will reach US$14,900
next year, while the country's consumer price index (CPI) and its
core CPI will increase no more than 2 percent and 1.5 percent,
respectively.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the CEPD also estimated that the country will post
an average economic growth rate of 4.9 percent and an unemployment
rate of 4 percent, respectively, for the period from 2005 through
2008, when per-capita income is expected to hit US$17,700.
</P>
<P>
CEPD Vice Chairman Yeh Ming-feng said that relevant government
agencies will do their best to meet the set targets in the
knowledge-based era while facing several challenges, including
dealing with a graying population, carrying out environmental
protection measures, promoting ethnic harmony, upgrading industry and
achieving sustainable national development amid fierce foreign
competition.
</P>
<P>
According to Yeh, dealing effectively with several major issues,
including structural unemployment, resource consumption, natural
disaster and epidemic disease control, pollution, cross-strait
competition and relations, and high oil prices, are of key importance
in Taiwan's continued economic growth
</P>
<P>
He said that based on the concept of building Taiwan into a"green
silicon island, " the government will tackle these issues with
greater innovation, care and tolerance.

TAIWAN SIGNS LARGEST TOURIST INVESTMENT BOT CASE
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Nov.  30 (CNA)
(By Elizabeth Hsu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Tourism authorities concluded a NT$10.34
billion (US$321.57 million) deal with an international investment
company Tuesday to develop the Dapeng Bay National Scenic Area in
southern Taiwan, the country's largest tourism-oriented
build-operate-transfer (BOT) case.
</P>
<P>
The contract was signed by Hsieh Wei-chun, chief of the Tourist
Bureau's Dapeng Bay National Scenic Area Administration under the
Ministry of Transportation and Communications, and Dapeng Bay
International Investment Chairman Pan Chung-kuang, with Tourism
Bureau Director-General Su Chen-tien, as well as acting Pingtung
Magistrate Wu Ying-wen, witnessing the ceremony.
</P>
<P>
The Dapeng Bay development project, covering a 257-hectare region
made up of wetland, lagoon and sea water, is Taiwan's largest BOT
investment in terms of the area scale and investment, while it also
contains the most multi-dimensional development packages, according
to the Tourism Bureau.
</P>
<P>
Tourism officials said the projects will be carried out in two
stages, with the first stage focusing on the construction of a marina
and port zone facilities, including a fisherman's wharf and a seaside
restaurant; an artificial peninsula that will be home to a museum of
history and literature, a leisure and entertainment center, a water
world and an international convention center equipped with a tourist
hotel; a golf resort; and a large parking lot.
</P>
<P>
Construction work for the first-stage development is scheduled to
finish by the end of 2012, with the second stage scheduled for
completion eight years later, according to the officials.
</P>
<P>
They noted that the planned second-stage development will center
on work to build a southern Taiwan leisure-oriented coastal area, an
ecological educational park and an educational hall.
</P>
<P>
The Dapeng Bay National Scenic Area, set up in November 1997, is
located on the southern coast and borders Donggang and Linbien
townships in Pingtung. A natural, wildlife-rich area spanning 1,438
hectares of land, lagoon and sea, it includes Dapeng Bay -- the only
cystiform lagoon in Taiwan, according to the area administration.
</P>
<P>
The Tourism Bureau has assessed that once the development project
is completed, the scenic area will dominate the island's tourism
market.

PRESIDENT ORDERS STRINGENT CRACKDOWN ON VOTE BUYING

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President Chen Shui-bian Tuesday ordered
law enforcement authorities to step up a crackdown on vote-buying
ahead of the Dec. 11 legislative elections.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the weekly meeting of the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party's (DPP) Central Standing Committee, Chen noted that
the election campaign will enter its final stage Wednesday, when
official campaign activities begin.
</P>
<P>
This is also the time when vote-buying activities are especially
prevalent, Chen said.
</P>
<P>
While the government successfully prevented a number of
candidates with "black gold" backgrounds from being elected during
the last legislative elections in 2001 by enforcing a series of
operations against vote-buying, it must step up its effort this time
to stop the corrupt practice from coming back into fashion, Chen
said.
</P>
<P>
He said the crackdown will be based on evidence and not
partisanship.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he announced that he will take part in a large-scale
DPP rally scheduled for Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Chen said the DPP must unite the people of Taiwan as it did Feb.
</P>
<P>
28, when more than a million people held hands to form a human
chain stretching from the northernmost to the southernmost tip of the
island to protest the missile threat from mainland China.
</P>
<P>
He called on supporters to attend the upcoming parade around
Taipei City "for the security of Taiwan and the well-being of its 23
million people."

2006 REFERENDUM ON NEW CONSTITUTION WON'T BREACH PLEDGE: PRESIDENT
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Nov. 30 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President Chen Shui-bian said Tuesday his
administration's plan to hold a referendum in 2006 on a draft new
constitution to be implemented May 20, 2008 completely complies with
the nation's constitutional system and will by no means breach his
May 20 inauguration pledge.
</P>
<P>
Chen made the remarks while meeting with a visiting U.S.
congressional delegation headed by Rep. John Culberson (R-Texas).
</P>
<P>
He also took advantage of the meeting to reaffirm his commitment
to maintaining the status quo across the Taiwan Strait through the
rest of his term in office.
</P>
<P>
Chen's reaffirmation came a day after U.S. State Department
spokesman Richard Boucher said that the U.S. government is opposed to
any referendum that would change Taiwan's status or move toward
independence. Boucher reiterated the U.S. position after Chen said
Nov. 27 that he will hold a referendum on a new constitution for
Taiwan in 2006.
</P>
<P>
During his meeting with the U.S. congressional delegation, Chen
said the policy guidelines outlined in his May 20 second inauguration
speech, his Oct. 10 National Day address and his Nov. 10 10-point
directive for his administration's cross-strait policy and
constitutional re-engineering plan have not undergone any change and
will remain intact through the end of his tenure.
</P>
<P>
He assured the U.S. congressmen that his administration will
strictly follow Taiwan's existing constitution-amending procedures in
writing a new constitution that fits Taiwan's present situation.
</P>
<P>
Under the existing mechanism, the new constitution draft requires
the consent of three-quarters of the legislators before it can be
referred to a "functional National Assembly" for further review and
approval.
</P>
<P>
According to a legislative reform package passed by the
opposition-controlled Legislative Yuan in August this year, Chen said
the first and last "functional National Assembly" will be elected
next year to vote on the draft new constitution.
</P>
<P>
If all goes well, he went on, the draft new constitution will
again be put up for a nationwide referendum in 2006. If passed, the
new constitution will be put into force on the day of the conclusion
of his tenure -- May 20, 2008.
</P>
<P>
According to the new constitution, Chen said, the "functional
National Assembly" will be phased out and all future
constitution-amending bills passed by the legislature will be subject
to national referendum rather than approval by the "functional
National Assembly."
</P>
<P>
In conclusion, Chen said, his constitutional re-engineering plan
is fully compliant with Taiwan's constitutional procedures and will
not violate the content or spirit of his May 20 inauguration speech,
National Day address and Nov. 10 directives. "Our promises remain in
place and will not be subjected to any change, " he added.
</P>
<P>
Chen reiterated that he hopes the "pan-green camp" of his
Democratic Progressive Party and the Taiwan Solidarity Union can win
a clear majority in the Dec. 11 legislative elections to facilitate
his policy initiatives, including legislative reform and
constitutional re-engineering.
</P>
<P>
Once the "pan-green camp" controls a legislative majority, Chen
went on, Taiwan will be more confident in dealing with cross-strait
relations and the two sides of the Taiwan Strait will be more likely
to resume dialogue to maintain regional peace and stability.
</P>
<P>
Other members of the U.S. congressional delegation include Rep.
John Carter (R-Texas) and Rep. Phil Gingrey (R-GA), as well as former
Congressman Greg Laughlin and their aides. They arrived in Taipei
earlier in the day.

SUB-CABINET-LEVEL TAIWAN-U.S. TIFA TALKS RESUME AFTER 6-YEAR HIATUS
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Washington,  Nov.  29 (CNA)

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Sub-Cabinet-level Taiwan-U.S. trade
consultations under the bilateral Trade and Investment Framework
Agreement (TIFA) resumed Monday after a six-year hiatus.
</P>
<P>
The two-day meeting is being held at the U.S. Trade
Representative Office in Washington, D.C., with Deputy U.S. Trade
Representative Josette Sheeran Shiner serving as the chief U.S.
delegate and Chen Ruey-long, vice economics minister, heading the
Taiwan delegation.
</P>
<P>
The primary goal of the Taiwan delegation is to lobby the United
States to remove Taiwan from its Special 301 "priority watch" list
for IPR violations monitoring, while the U.S. delegation is expected
to push Taiwan to further liberalize its telecommunication and
pharmaceutical markets.
</P>
<P>
The TIFA trade consultation is the highest-level official
Taiwan-U.S. economic meeting. The talks had been suspend since 1998
due to U.S. discontent with Taiwan's alleged sloppy IPR enforcement.
</P>
<P>
With Taiwan having made tremendous progress in cracking down on
commercial piracy and in IPR protection, the U.S. government finally
agreed to resume TIFA talks this year.
</P>
<P>
If all goes smoothly, sources close to Taiwan's representative
office said, the U.S. government will agree to take Taiwan off its
Special 301 "priority watch" list next spring.
</P>
<P>
The Taiwan delegation to the ongoing TIFA meeting is composed of
officials from the Ministry of Economic Affairs, the Council of
Agriculture, the Directorate General of Telecommunications, the
Bureau of National Health Insurance Bureau, the Board of Foreign
Trade and the nation's representative office in the United States.

BEIJING USING ECONOMIC CLOUT TO 'MARGINALIZE' TAIWAN: MOFA
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Nov. 30 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mainland China is stepping up its efforts
to marginalize Taiwan by signing multilateral or bilateral free trade
agreements with other countries, Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA)
spokesman Michel Lu said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Lu was commenting on Beijing's signing of a free trade agreement
(FTA) with the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) in
Vientiane, Laos, the previous day.
</P>
<P>
"The new accord marks yet another move by Beijing to use economic
means to marginalize Taiwan, " Lu said, adding that relevant
government agencies will communicate with ASEAN countries through the
proper channels and work out response strategies to cope with the new
situation.
</P>
<P>
Chieh Wen-chi, deputy director of the MOFA's International
Organizations Department, said the new mainland China-ASEAN FTA is
not expected to have a significant adverse impact on Taiwan because
the World Trade Organization (WTO) imposes many restrictions on such
regional pacts.
</P>
<P>
If the FTA imposes stringent discrimination against non-members,
Chieh said, the existing multilateral international trading system
will not tolerate its existence.
</P>
<P>
While the signing of the FTA may signal a step forward in the
regional integration of East Asia, Chieh said he is convinced that
major countries in the region will eventually come to a new
understanding of Taiwan's important role in the region.
</P>
<P>
With Taiwan's economic strength and quality manpower resources,
Chieh said, Taiwan will be able to play a constructive role in East
Asia.

<TEXT>
<P>
Central Election Commission (CEC) Chairman
Chang Cheng-hsiung posted the names of the legislative candidates
running in the Dec. 11 elections on the commission's bulletin board
Tuesday on the eve of the start of the 10-day official campaign
period.
</P>
<P>
Also posted on the CEC bulletin board was the legally sanctioned
timeframe for campaign activities. The official campaign period
starts from Dec. 1 and will last through Dec. 10., with the daily
campaign time from 7 a.m. through 10 p.m.
</P>
<P>
A total of 493 hopefuls passed the qualification screening and
completed a drawing of lots to determine the order in which their
names will appear on the ballots. Among the hopefuls, 386 will vie
for regional and aboriginal legislative seats, while 89 will compete
for at-large seats and 18 will run for overseas community seats.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a news conference, Chang said television and radio
stations will be barred from broadcasting legislative election
campaign commercials from Dec. 1.
</P>
<P>
"Starting tomorrow, individual legislative candidates and third
parties should not air campaign commercials on TV or radio channels,
otherwise they will violate the Public Officials Election and Recall
Law," Chang said.
</P>
<P>
From Dec. 1, Chang went on, TV and radio stations will also be
barred from giving full-length live broadcasts of any campaign rally.
</P>
<P>
"They can only broadcast selected scenes in their news programs,"
Chang said, adding that all CEC commissioners will meet Wednesday to
more clearly set out standards for determining whether a TV or radio
program has violated the "no campaign" regulations and whether news
programs have been fair and impartial.
</P>
<P>
According to the television and radio broadcasting law, Chang
said, violators will face varying fines for violations. The fines for
cable TV stations could reach a maximum of NT$500,000, while
law-breaking terrestrial TV stations could be slapped with fines of
up to NT$1 million.
</P>
<P>
Chang said the law requires TV and radio stations to deal with
news events regarding individual candidates and their parties
impartially and fairly. The law also forbids them from broadcasting
campaign commercials put up by individual candidates, political
parties or third parties during the official campaign period. TV and
radio stations are also not allowed to campaign for any parties or
candidates in their programs during the period.
</P>
<P>
From Dec. 1, Chang said the Government Information Office (GIO)
will closely monitor all TV and radio news programs. If any are found
to have violated the principles of fairness and impartiality, the GIO
will send the monitoring videotapes to the CEC for review.

GOODWILL IS KEY TO CROSS-STRAIT TALKS: MAC CHIEF
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Hong  Kong,  Nov.  30 (CNA)
(By Huang Kwang-chun)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taiwan's Mainland Affairs Council
Chairman Joseph Wu said in a recent interview with the monthly
magazine "China Review" that goodwill is the key to the resumption of
cross-Taiwan Strait talks.
</P>
<P>
In the interview, carried in the edition that will be put on
newsstands Wednesday, Wu said that President Chen Shui-bian has
repeatedly offered goodwill overtures to mainland China since he
assumed office May 20, 2000, but Beijing has never reciprocated.
</P>
<P>
Beijing should not try to squeeze Taiwan's international space
when Taiwan is seeking to improve the cross-strait relations with
goodwill proposals, Wu said.
</P>
<P>
Noting that Taiwan does not rule out any topics to be discussed
in cross-strait talks, including the "one China" issue, the country's
top mainland policy planner said that it is difficult for Taiwan to
accept the "one China" as a prerequisite to the dialogue as demanded
by Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Given that the "one China" issue is a basic problem for both
sides of the Taiwan Strait, the two parties should first create an
ambiguous environment and start negotiations with non-political
issues, such as a liquidation accord for their currencies, the
signing of a Taiwan businessmen's investment protection guarantee
agreement, a double taxation avoidance accord, an intellectual
property rights protection pact, direct cross-strait trade,
transportation and postal service links, cross-strait tourism and
repatriation of illegal immigrants, among others, he proposed.
</P>
<P>
Many problems have emerged from the cross-strait exchanges and
should be dealt with quickly, Wu pointed out, adding that Taiwan is
trying to promote a sound development of cross-strait ties and to
make them move toward cooperative ties.
</P>
<P>
An uncertain, unstable and unfriendly cross-strait relationship
is harmful to both Taiwan and the mainland, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Referring to a plan initiated by Chen to establish a framework
for cross-strait peace and stability and to set up a committee for
cross-strait peace and development, Wu said that relevant government
agencies are making preparations and that action is expected to be
launched after the Dec. 11 legislative elections because the
government does not want to let the issues become topics of electoral
campaigns, which may make the situation even more complicated.
</P>
<P>
The government will have a better position to promote
cross-strait relations after the "pan green camp" formed by the
ruling Democratic Progressive Party and the Taiwan Solidarity Union
wins a majority of legislative seats in the upcoming elections, he
said.

45 LAWMAKERS FAIL WATCHDOG GROUP'S ATTENDANCE, INTEGRITY EVALUATIONS
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,   Nov.   30  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Taipei Society, a private
self-proclaimed legislative watchdog organization, issued an
evaluation report on incumbent legislators Tuesday, 11 days ahead of
the Dec. 11 legislative elections.
</P>
<P>
The evaluation was based on lawmakers' attendance at various
committee meetings during the past two legislative sessions, as well
as on three negative indexes -- conflict of interest, inappropriate
deeds or remarks, and involvement in corruption or other criminal
cases.
</P>
<P>
In terms of those indexes, the Taipei Society flunked 45
incumbent lawmakers from across the political spectrum and 62 others
were put on the "negative watch list."
</P>
<P>
The flunked lawmakers referred to those whose attendance rates
fell below 50 percent, as well as those whose attendance rates were
above 50 percent but who were connected with two or more of the three
negative indexes.
</P>
<P>
The "negative watch list" includes lawmakers with low attendance
rates and connection with one of the negative indexes.
</P>
<P>
Among the flunked legislators, one is an independent, 16 are
opposition Kuomintang (KMT) members, 12 are from the opposition
People First Party (PFP) , seven each are from the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) and the Non-Partisan Solidarity Union (NPSU)
and two are from the Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU).
</P>
<P>
Chang Mao-kuei, a research fellow with Academia Sinica's
Institute of Social Sciences, who authored the evaluation report,
said KMT Legislator Ho Chih-hui, who tops the "flunked" list, should
return his annual legislative stipend of NT$8.5 million because he
has seldom attended legislative committee meetings and has been
indicted over corruption charges. Chang also urged Ho, who has been
nominated by the KMT to seek re-election in the Miaoli County
constituency, to make a public apology to taxpayers.
</P>
<P>
Chang said all the "flunked" lawmakers should give public
explanations of their low attendance rates and their improper deeds
and words, as well as their failure to avoid conflicts of interest
and their roles in corruption and criminal cases.
</P>
<P>
He also urged those who failed to attend at least 20 percent of
legislative committee meetings to refund their legislative stipends.
</P>
<P>
The evaluation report also unveiled a "positive
list" of 39 lawmakers who have high attendance rates and are
believed to be less likely to be connected with negative
indexes. Among them, 15 are DPP members, 11 each are from the KMT
and the PFP, one is from the TSU and one is an independent.

LEGISLATIVE ELECTION CAMPAIGN TO BEGIN, LAW ENFORCEMENT STEPPED UP
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Nov.  30 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Campaign activities for the Dec. 11
legislative elections will officially begin Wednesday and run through
until the election eve amid stepped up law enforcement, police
authorities said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
According to a spokesman for the National Police Administration,
campaigning will be allowed from 7 a.m. through 10 p.m. each day
during the period from Dec. 1 to Dec. 10.
</P>
<P>
In an effort to wipe out irregularities, violence and vote-buying
and to protect the personal safety of all candidates and secure a
smooth election, law enforcement has been stepped up across Taiwan,
he said.
</P>
<P>
Citing the newest survey results, Chang Chun-hsiung, secretary-
general of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), said he is
cautiously optimistic that the DPP will seize 101 seats in the
225-member Legislative Yuan -- the target set by President Chen
Shui-bian.
</P>
<P>
Along with the Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU) , the "pan green
camp" will be able to grab at least 113 seats to form a majority in
the sixth legislature, laying a foundation for sweeping reforms,
Chang said.
</P>
<P>
A TSU official said that his party has a potential of capturing
24 seats in the elections with 17 having been secured.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the opposition "pan blue alliance" of the Kuomintang
(KMT) and the People First Party (PFP) is also striving to retain
their present majority in the next Legislative Yuan.
</P>
<P>
Liao Feng-teh, director of the KMT's Organization Development
Committee, forecast that the KMT will win about 79 seats. In a bid to
garner as many seats as possible, the KMT is considering resorting to
a vote-allocation strategy among its supporters, he added.
</P>
<P>
The PFP has set a goal of winning between 35 and 40 seats in
order to achieve a "pan blue" majority in the legislature in
cooperation with the KMT.
</P>
<P>
An official of the Non-Partisan Solidarity Union (NPSU) claimed
that the party stands a good chance of garnering as many as 20 seats
amid fierce competition between the "pan blue alliance" and the "pan
green camp, " especially when both sides launch their mechanisms to
allocate votes among their backers.
</P>
<P>
A total of 387 eligible candidates will contest the upcoming
legislative election, vying for 168 regional seats and eight
aboriginal seats. The remaining eight overseas Chinese seats and 41
at-large seats will be allocated to the various parties according to
the number of votes they garner.
</P>
<P>
The DPP has recommended 92 candidates for regional seats,
followed by the KMT, with 74. The PFP is fielding 41, while the TSU
and the NPSU are fielding 30 and 26 hopefuls, respectively.

TAIWAN-NICARAGUA FTA 2ND-ROUND TALKS OPEN IN SAN FRANCISCO
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
San Francisco,  Nov. 29 (CNA)
(By Chiang Yin and Huang Kwang-chun)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Delegates from Taiwan and Nicaragua
started a second round of free trade agreement (FTA) talks Monday in
San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
Officials of Taiwan's Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) said
the negotiations are divided into five panels that will discuss
animal and plant health inspection and quarantine, investment,
telecommunications and the protection of intellectual property
rights.
</P>
<P>
The MOEA hopes to conclude the talks and sign an FTA accord by
the end of the first half of next year, they added.
</P>
<P>
Vice Minister of Economic Affairs Chen Ruey-long and his
Nicaraguan counterpart Alejandro Arguello are jointly chairing the
negotiations on behalf of their respective governments at the
meeting, which will run through Dec. 3, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
Officials from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the MOEA, the
Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Justice, the Department of
Health, the Council of Agriculture, the Financial Supervisory
Commission and the Directorate General of Telecommunications make up
the bulk of the Taiwan delegation.
</P>
<P>
According to Chen, Taiwan and Nicaragua exchanged customs tariff
reduction lists for agricultural and farm products prior to the San
Francisco negotiations, which will help two-way substantive talks
conclude sooner.
</P>
<P>
The two countries finished their first round of FTA talks in late
September in Taipei, making Nicaragua a would-be second FTA partner
of Taiwan, after Panama.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan-Nicaragua trade in the first 10 months of this year
totaled US$226 million, up by 117 percent over the previous year's
level.
