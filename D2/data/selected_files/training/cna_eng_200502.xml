Confucius' lesson of the day: "In my method of teaching, I always
wait for my student to make an effort himself to find his way through
a difficulty, before I show him the way myself. I also make him find
his own illustrations before I give him one of my own. When I have
pointed out the bearing of a subject in one direction and found that
my student cannot himself see its bearings into other directions, I
do not then repeat my lesson."

<TEXT>
<P>
The new members of the sixth Legislative
Yuan were sworn in Tuesday for a three-year term.
</P>
<P>
The 225 legislators, which were elected in the Dec. 11
legislative elections, took their oath of office under the
supervision of Grand Justice Yang Jen-shou at 9:40 a.m. at the
legislature's main conference hall.
</P>
<P>
The most conspicuous among them was independent lawmaker Li Ao, a
historian and prolific writer, who refused to face a portrait of the
founding father, Dr. Sun Yat-sen, and instead chose to face his own
picture, to take the oath.
</P>
<P>
Li had earlier issued an open letter to all his colleagues in
which he criticized the contents of the oath that legislators must
take when being sworn in, saying that they are the legacy of the
previous Kuomintang regime. He also said the portions of the oath
asking the lawmakers "not to be corrupt" and "not to accept bribes"
are "ridiculous" and should be abrogated.
</P>
<P>
After the swearing-in ceremony, the most important matter on the
legislators' agenda was the election of a speaker and a vice speaker
of the legislature, set for 10: 30 a.m. and 2: 30 p.m., respectively.
The voting for each is expected to take two hours, and the counting
should take 30 minutes.
</P>
<P>
The "pan-blue alliance" of the Kuomintang (KMT) the People First
Party (PFP) said after demanding that its legislators toe the party
line or face party discipline that it is optimistic about its
candidate, incumbent speaker Wang Jin-pyng, being re-elected.
</P>
<P>
Legislator Ker Chien-ming, candidate of the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP), said "the result will not be final until the
last minute."
</P>
<P>
Regarding its vice speakership candidate, the "pan-blue alliance"
said that "the situation of David J. C. Chung is stable" and that it
is hoped that he can pass the first round of voting.
</P>
<P>
The DPP has yet to announce its candidate for the vice
speakership, and the DPP legislative caucus said that it is not
ruling out the possibility of Ker running for vice speakership in the
hopes that he can win by a slim margin.
</P>
<P>
The "pan-blue alliance" commands a slim majority of 114 seats in
the 225-member legislature, while the "pan-green camp" of the DPP and
its ally, the Taiwan Solidarity Union, has 101 seats.
</P>
<P>
The red carpet was rolled out for the new legislators in the
swearing-in ceremony in the morning, with Wang and Chung walking the
red carpet hand-in-hand to drum up support for their bid for the
speakership and vice speakership.

his opponent, Ker Chien-ming of the ruling Democratic Progressive
Party (DPP) , 123-101 in a vote held by the sixth Legislative Yuan
shortly after its members were sworn in.
</P>
<P>
Wang, 64, was able to win thanks to the support of the "pan-blue
alliance" of the KMT and the People First Party, which demanded that
all members toe the party line or face expulsion from the alliance,
as well as of the Non-Partisan Solidarity Union (NPSU). Wang has held
the post since 1999.
</P>
<P>
The "pan-blue alliance" commands a slim majority of 114 seats in
the 225-seat legislature.
</P>
<P>
Ker obtained all 101 votes of the "pan-green camp" of the DPP and
the Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU) . The DPP has 89 seats in the
legislature, and the TSU has 12 seats.
</P>
<P>
The DPP, which has yet to announce its candidate for vice
speakership, is not ruling out the possibility of having Ker run for
the post. The vice speakership election is set for 2:30 p.m.
</P>
<P>
If Ker runs, he will face David J. C. Chung of the People First
Party, who has the support of the "pan-blue alliance."
</P>
<P>
During the speakership election, all of the lawmakers, except for
Legislator Li Ao, displayed their ballots to show that they had
supported their party's candidate.

The "pan-green camp" of the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) and its ally, the Taiwan
Solidarity Union (TSU), reached consensus early Tuesday on fielding
Huang Tsung-yuan of the TSU as the camp's candidate in the
Legislative Yuan vote for a new vice speaker set for 2:30 p.m.
</P>
<P>
Huang, TSU caucus whip in the legislature, said in the hours

would represent the "pan-green camp" to run for the vice speakership
against David J. C. Chung of the People First Party (PFP) , the
candidate supported by the opposition "pan-blue alliance" of the
Kuomintang (KMT) and the PFP.

Knowing that the "pan-blue alliance" commands a majority of 114

"daunting task" to win the vice speakership but added that the
"pan-green camp" should not be absent from the race.

FRANK HSIEH SWORN IN AS PREMIER
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei, Feb. 1 (CNA)

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Former Kaohsiung Mayor Frank Hsieh was sworn
in as premier on Tuesday, inaugurating a new Cabinet which Hsieh said
will make consultations and coexistence its cornerstone.
</P>
<P>
With senior presidential adviser Peng Ming-min looking on, Hsieh
took over the official seal from Yu Shyi-kun, who has been appointed
secretary-general of the Presidential Office.
</P>
<P>
Hsieh said the new Cabinet must be humble because the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) is the largest but not the
majority party in the Legislative Yuan.
</P>
<P>
In the future, the Cabinet will step up communication with the
opposition, society and the DPP to try to generate a new political
landscape in Taiwan through consultations.
</P>
<P>
Hsieh pledged his Cabinet will give equal priority to economic
development, social justice and sustainable environmental protection
and will seek to improve law and order, enhance fairness in taxation
and resolve problems concerning the National Health Insurance
program.
</P>
<P>
Yu, meanwhile, said -- tongue-in-cheek -- that the heavy burden
of the premiership has made him almost one centimeter shorter and
that he is greatly relieved now that he is able to let go of the
burden.
</P>
<P>
Over the past three years, Yu said, his Cabinet has succeeded in
its efforts in boosting the country's economic growth, lowering the
unemployment rate, easing traffic congestion, slowing down the
industrial exodus to mainland China, expanding civil rights,
downsizing the government and preventing financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
Yu said he believes Hsieh's new Cabinet will outperform his own.
</P>
<P>
Immediately after Hsieh's inauguration, members of his Cabinet
were sworn in.
</P>
<P>
Almost all members of Yu's Cabinet have been retained with the
exception of Executive Yuan Secretary-General Arthur Iap, Minister of
Justice Chen Ding-nan and Central Personnel Administration
Director-General Lee Yi-yang.
</P>
<P>
The ceremony was completed after Iap, Chen and Lee handed over
official seals to their successors Lee Ying-yuan, Shih Mao-lin and
Chang Chun-yen.
</P>
<P>
The post of vice premier, however, remained vacant at the time of
the swearing-in. Hsieh had previously said that he would not rule out
the possibility of naming an opposition member as his deputy.

DPP HOPES FOR NEW BEGINNING OF DIALOGUE AFTER LEGISLATIVE RACE
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Feb.  1 (CNA)

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ker Chien-ming of the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP), who earlier lost the legislative speakership
election Tuesday, congratulated Wang Jin-pyng of the Kuomintang (KMT)
on his victory, saying that it could usher in better dialogue and
cooperation between the ruling and opposition camps.
</P>
<P>
Accompanied by DPP Legislator Chang Chun-hsiung, Ker made the
remarks after he was defeated 101-123 in the speakership election
earlier in the day.
</P>
<P>
Ker thanked the support of the "pan-green camp" of the DPP and
its ally, Taiwan Solidarity Union, adding that although faced with a
strong contender such as Wang, who is well-rounded and has held the
post since 1999, the DPP couldn't surrender without a fight.
</P>
<P>
He also said that during the election, he thought about a lot of
things, including the future of Taiwan. He said that on reflection,
it was apparent that the KMT has been mean-spirited, and KMT Chairman
Lien Chan has made inappropriate remarks, although he has maintained
a good manner throughout.
</P>
<P>
He urged the KMT not to fall back on its old mindset in these
modern times or there will never be reconciliation between the ruling
and opposition parties.
</P>
<P>
He also expressed the hope that Wang will play a neutral role,
saying that the DPP threw its weight behind Wang for the speakership
three years ago, but he lamented there the most serious violations of
constitutionality have also occurred over the past three years.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the KMT and the People First Party (PFP) have only
put forward "money-pit" bills, and not those that would benefit the
nation or the people, which he termed the "decadence" of the
legislature.
</P>
<P>
He also appealed for an end to the seemingly endless wrangling
between the ruling and opposition parties, expressing the hope that
Wang helps establish a new culture in the legislature.
</P>
<P>
Legislator Chang also said that the DPP accepts the decision by
the 225 legislators, and wishes that Wang leads legislative reforms
to earn accolades from the people and not to repeat the dereliction
of duty seen by the refusal to screen the qualifications of the
members of the Control Yuan, the nation's highest watchdog body,
nominated by President Chen Shui-bian.
</P>
<P>
Tsai Hao, caucus whip of the Non-Partisan Solidarity Union
(TPSU) , also congratulated Wang on his victory, saying that his
winning was natural and the TPSU's support for Wang is only the
"icing on the cake."
</P>
<P>
The TPSU pledged all eight votes for Wang, but in the end seven
voted for Wang, and one for Legislator Ting Shou-chung, which Tsai
attributed to a possible "mistake" by a new member.
</P>
<P>
Tsai also said that the TPSU would support David J.C. Chung of
the PFP, for the vice speakership, saying that the
support for Chung means "lending a hand in need."

ARATS OFFICIALS ARRIVE TO PAY TRIBUTE TO LATE SEF CHIEF

Taipei,  Feb.  31 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Three senior officials from mainland
China's quasi-official Association for Relations Across the Taiwan
Strait (ARATS) arrived in Taipei Tuesday to attend a memorial service
for the late Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) Chairman Koo Chen-fu.
</P>
<P>
ARATS Vice President Sun Yafu, who is concurrently deputy
director of the Taiwan Affairs Office of the mainland's State
Council, ARATS Secretary-General Li Yafei, and Ma Xiaoguang, director
of the ARATS research department were greeted by SEF Chief Secretary
Lin Shu-min upon their arrival at Chiang Kai-shek International
Airport -- Taiwan's main gateway.
</P>
<P>
Sun and Li said they were requested by ARATS President Wang
Daohan to convey his last respects for Koo.
</P>
<P>
In addition to expressing Wang's esteem for Koo, the duo said,
their arrival also symbolized mainland China's respect for the people
of Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Lin extended a warm welcome to the three ARATS officials, saying
that the SEF is grateful that they came to pay their last respects to
the late top Taiwan negotiator with mainland China.
</P>
<P>
Wang, who is in his late 80s, asked Sun and Li to convey a letter
of condolence to Koo's widow. During his meeting with his deputies in
Shanghai Monday, Wang was quoted as having said that he felt
nostalgic about his old friend Koo, and very much wanted to pay his
last respects at Koo's memorial, but was prevented from doing so by
ill health.
</P>
<P>
Koo's funeral is scheduled for Wednesday at the National Sun
Yat-sen Memorial Hall in Taipei.
</P>
<P>
Koo, a respected business tycoon known for his diplomatic acumen,
held a groundbreaking meeting with Wang in Singapore in 1993 in the
first formal cross-strait contact in more than four decades. He died
Jan. 3 just days before he would have turned 88.
</P>
<P>
The historic Koo-Wang meeting laid the framework for the
quasi-official SEF and ARATS to handle cross-strait exchanges in the
absence of official ties. In 1998, the two envoys met again when Koo
traveled to Shanghai and Beijing to boost further rapprochement.
However, Beijing unilaterally suspended regular SEF-ARATS dialogue in
July 1999, when then-ROC President Lee Teng-hui defined cross-strait
ties as "state-to-state" in nature.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, Chen Yunlin, director of the Taiwan Affairs Office
(TAO) of the State Council, said in Beijing that the three ARATS
officials' Taipei trip is not only aimed at expressing the mainland's
esteem for Koo's contributions to the promotion of cross-strait
relations but also at symbolizing the mainland's respect for the
people of Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
"We hope the trio will convey our remembrance and condolences
during their trip to Taipei," Chen said.

<TEXT>
<P>
Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng, who
was re-elected earlier Tuesday, said that it is "his unshirkable
duty" to promote harmony between the ruling and opposition parties
for the sake of political stability.
</P>
<P>
Wang, who defeated Ker Chien-ming, the candidate of the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) 123 votes to 101, said that with
the new mandate, he will push for legislative reforms, and formulated
"good bills and policies" in the legislature.
</P>
<P>
He also pledged to "pull out all the stops" for the sake of
national solidarity and harmony between legislative caucuses.
</P>
<P>
But Wang, who is a vice chairman of the opposition Kuomintang
(KMT), did not reveal whether he would run for KMT chairman or seek a
higher position, saying only that he "has not thought about the
matter."
</P>
<P>
Noting that the DPP is extending an olive branch for inter-party
reconciliation, Wang also said that he would help promote harmony
between the ruling and opposition parties and upgrade the quality and
efficiency of the legislature.
</P>
<P>
President Chen Shui-bian, Premier Frank Hsieh, Presidential
Office Secretary-General Yu Shyi-kun, National Security Bureau
Director Hsieh Shih-min, KMT Chairman Lien Chan and People First
Party (PFP) Chairman James Soong called to congratulate Wang upon
hearing of his re-election.
</P>
<P>
Wang expressed his appreciation for Lien and Soong, saying that
because of the full support of the KMT and the PFP, which combined
hold 114 seats, he was able to win a majority in the first round.

ANTI-NUCLEAR GROUP PRESSES NEW PREMIER TO STICK TO NUCLEAR-FREE IDEAL
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  Feb.  1 (CNA)
(By Y.F. Low)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An anti-nuclear group on Tuesday demanded
that newly inaugurated Premier Frank Hsieh stick to the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party's (DPP) long-standing ideal of making
Taiwan a nuclear-free country.
</P>
<P>
The group led by former DPP Chairman Lin I-hsiung, which is
campaigning for a referendum on the country's Fourth Nuclear Power
Plant project, marched around the Executive Yuan and Legislative Yuan
in demonstration of their appeal soon after Hsieh was sworn in as
premier.
</P>
<P>
Chang Kuo-lung, convener of the group, pointed out that Hsieh had
expressed his approval of the nuclear-free ideal when he ran for DPP
chairman five years ago and during his re-election bid for Kaohsiung
mayor two years ago.
</P>
<P>
However, Chang said recent remarks by Hsieh indicate that he has
somewhat deviated from his original concepts.
</P>
<P>
In an open letter to Hsieh, the group urged him to make a
nuclear-free Taiwan a reality during his term to protect the life and
property of the Taiwanese people.
</P>
<P>
It said amending the Referendum Law and achieving the goal of
making Taiwan a nuclear-free country are President Chen Shui-bian's
commitments and that the DPP must stick firm to its platform in order
to continue to win the support of the people.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Chang criticized the Executive Yuan as being
"totalitarian" for sending riot police to greet the demonstrators at
its gate and he urged the ruling party to abandon such an
undemocratic mind-set so that Taiwan can become a modern country.

YANG MING UNIVERSITY PROFESSOR BECOMES TAIPEI HEALTH CHIEF
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Feb.  1 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Sung Yen-jen, an anatomy and cellular
biology professor at National Yang Ming University, was sworn in as
director of the Taipei City Government's department of health
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Sung filled the post vacated by Chang Hang, who resigned last
month to assume responsibility for a medical incident involving the
Taipei Municipal Hospital's Jen Ai branch. Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou
said at the changeover ceremony that as the Taipei Municipal Hospital
has long maintained a cooperative program with National Yang Ming
University, Sung's joining of his administrative team will be
conducive to the integration of the university and the municipal
hospital and thus contribute to the upgrading of the city's medical
service system.
</P>
<P>
Chang will from now on exclusively serve as Taipei Municipal
Hospital superintendent. Ma said he hopes Chang and Sung will work
hand in hand to plug holes in the city's emergency medical service
system and streamline its patient transfer operations to prevent
recurrence of the tragedy of an abused girl who was first refused
admission to the municipal hospital's Jen Ai branch after being
critically injured by her abusive father and ended up being
transported to a hospital more than 100 kilometers away in the
central county of Taichung for surgery.
</P>
<P>
The 4-year-old girl, surnamed Chiu, was pronounced brain dead and
died two weeks after the surgery failed to improve her condition. Her
family later donated her kidneys and liver, which have each been
successfully transplanted to two female patients.
</P>
<P>
Chiu's ordeal triggered an uproar which led to an investigation
into why the 4-year-old was refused treatment when there were
sufficient beds in major Taipei hospitals. The Jen Ai hospital's
superintendent and a neurosurgeon at the hospital have been
disciplined over the incident.
</P>
<P>
The Cabinet-level Department of Health announced after the tragic
incident that it would overhaul the existing system for patient
transfers. The new system will take effect in June.

<P>
The Ministry of National Defense said
Tuesday that the response to a program to recruit young people to
serve voluntarily in the military has been enthusiastic, with the
number of those registering surpassing 1,000 on the first day.
</P>
<P>
Fu Mao-yao, director of the defense ministry talent recruitment
center, said Tuesday that the ministry intends to recruit 6,561 young
people, including 90 women, in February, April, June and August this
year.
</P>
<P>
The military had hoped to register 1,826 people in the first
stage between Jan. 31 and Feb. 4, but was pleasantly surprised to
find that more than 1,000 signed up on the first day alone, Fu said.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the defense ministry has only recruited 399 young men
over the past two years, he said that the ministry has continued to
better the salary and benefits for the recruits, making signing up
more attractive to young people.
</P>
<P>
Volunteer privates will receive a monthly wage of NT$27,105
(US$857.75) and various stipends, and they will enjoy half off for
water and electricity bills during the service in the military. After
their service period, they can also obtain a retirement pension and
government agencies will assist them in gaining professional licenses
related to their posts.
</P>
<P>
Fu said that because of the generous offer, the recruitment
center has received many inquiries recently, and that there have been
more than 17,000 hits on the Web site set up by the ministry in less
than a month.
</P>
<P>
Vice Minister of National Defense Tsai Ming-hsien announced last
week that under a conscription system reform program, the mandatory

LUNAR NEW YEAR  CHARTER FLIGHTS POPULAR: CARRIERS
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Feb.  1 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With the special Lunar New Year holiday
charter flights kicking off between Taiwan and mainland China last
Saturday, Taiwan-bound flights from Shanghai have been extremely
popular, aviation companies said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Tickets on flights from Shanghai to Taiwan offered by Taiwan's
China Airlines (CAL), Far East Air Transport Corp., Trans Asia
Airways and the mainland's Xiamen Airlines have all been fully booked
by mainland-based Taiwan businessmen and their families wishing to
spend the Feb. 9 Chinese New Year holiday at home, they said.
</P>
<P>
For instance, more than 300 seats on a CAL A330-300 flight slated
to take off from Shanghai for Taipei Saturday have all been reserved,
with a large number of passengers on a waiting list.
</P>
<P>
Xiamen Airlines will provide the next charter flight Wednesday
from Guangzhou to Kaohsiung, with about 80 percent of its tickets
booked. However, only a few tickets on the return trip have been
sold.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, Trans Asia Airways will inaugurate its maiden charter
flight from Taipei to Guangzhou. Only some 20 percent of the tickets
on the Guangzhou-bound flight have been sold, while nearly 80 percent
of the tickets on the Taipei-bound flight have been booked.
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, Far East Air Transport Corp. will also launch its
maiden charter service between Taipei and Guangzhou, with the
Guangzhou-Taipei flight fully loaded. Seats on its Feb. 7 round-trip
flights connecting Taipei and Shanghai have also all been booked.
</P>
<P>
The special charter flights were designed exclusively for
mainland-based Taiwan businessmen and their dependents flying between
the two sides -- Taipei and Kaohsiung in Taiwan and Shanghai,
Guangzhou and Beijing in mainland China -- from Jan. 29 - Feb. 20.
</P>
<P>
A total of nine flights were provided by eight aviation companies
from the two sides of the Taiwan Strait on the first day of the
service, which marked the historic landings of mainland carriers on
Taiwan soil in more than 55 years.
</P>
<P>
Direct transport, trade and postal links across the strait have
been banned since 1949, when Taiwan and the mainland separated in the
wake of a civil war.

NAVY INVESTIGATING OFFICER'S SUICIDE IN U.S.
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Kaohsiung,  Feb.  1 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The ashes of a non-commissioned navy
officer who committed suicide in the United States last week were
brought back to Taiwan Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Naval authorities said the Navy General Headquarters (NGH) has
assigned staff to assist Chief Petty Officer Wu Chin-chung's family
in handling their affairs. Wu's ashes have been placed in a makeshift
memorial hall at a military hospital near the Tsoying naval base in
southern Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
The NGH has also formed a special task force to investigate the
possible cause of Wu's suicide, a Naval Fleet Command official said.
</P>
<P>
"We'll get to the bottom of the incident and find out who should
be held responsible for it," the official said.
</P>
<P>
Wu was a member of the Republic of China Navy staff working at a
U.S. shipyard in South Carolina in preparation for taking delivery of
four Kidd-class destroyers that Taiwan purchased from the United
States in 2001. The four destroyers were originally built for the
Shah of Iran in 1979, but were later mothballed when Iran canceled
the deal. The four warships are being refurbished and are undergoing
maintenance in the United States before being delivered to Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Wu was found to have strangled himself aboard one of the
destroyers by his colleagues Jan. 26, according to naval sources.
Wu's colleagues immediately performed emergency first aid and
informed their superiors of the incident.
</P>
<P>
After receiving the information from the U.S. naval base, the
Naval Fleet Command immediately notified Wu's family in Taiwan of the
tragedy and sent staff members to provide assistance.
</P>
<P>
In the past, Taiwan has sent special naval teams to the United
States to receive training and take delivery of U.S.-built warships.
As the work is very complicated and stressful, military sources
said, some incidents involving naval staff have been reported in the
past.
</P>
<P>
Wu's grandmother was heartbroken when she saw her grandson's
ashes at Kaohsiung International Airport. Wu's uncle said Wu had
faxed a suicide note to his parents, complaining about his extremely
heavy workload, long working hours and his superiors' frequent
fault-finding. The uncle said the naval authorities should find out
the cause of his suicide.

PREMIER UNDERLINES COEXISTENCE AS CORE VALUE OF ADMINISTRATION

(By Maubo Chang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Premier Frank Hsieh unveiled coexistence as
the core value of his administration Tuesday in the first Cabinet
meeting after his swearing-in earlier in the day.
</P>
<P>
The former mayor of Kaohsiung City told his Cabinet that
coexistence means tolerance toward different views and does not run
contrary to the idea of giving Taiwan predominance over everything
else.
</P>
<P>
Hsieh said his administration will follow the principle of "live
and let live" and iron out its political differences with the
opposition parties through negotiation and compromise.
</P>
<P>
He said coexistence will not damage the principle of Taiwan
predominance and compromise will not lead to the regression of the
country.
</P>
<P>
Giving Taiwan priority will not prohibit people from showing
their individual preferences for other countries like Japan, South
Korea, or even mainland China, although Taiwan's interests must be
served first should there be a conflict of interests between Taiwan
and those other countries, Hsieh went on.
</P>
<P>
Only coexistence can nurture a sense of "esprit de corps" among
the Taiwan people, according to the premier.
</P>
<P>
Hsieh said Taiwan's status as an independent political entity
should be established by action rather than through fruitless
quarrels.

GERMAN GROUP PLANNING WIND POWER INVESTMENT IN CHIAYI
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Feb.  1 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Chiayi Magistrate Chen Ming-wen agreed
Tuesday in principle to a wind energy investment project proposed by
the Germany-based Infra Vest Group, which plans to set up 97 wind
turbines in coastal areas of the southern Taiwan county.
</P>
<P>
Chen gave the nod to the investment plan with conditions attached
after hearing a briefing by Infra Vest officials. 
</P>
<P>
The magistrate stipulated that the group must cooperate
unconditionally in future infrastructure construction and must fully
communicate with local residents and environmentalists. He also
demanded that the group come up with compensation and feed-back
measures before moving into further negotiations.
</P>
<P>
According to Infra Vest officials, the group has decided to
invest NT$16 billion (US$500 million) in setting up 97 wind turbines
in Chiayi's coastal areas after carrying out various in-depth
inspections of the area.
</P>
<P>
Stressing that the Tungshih and Putai areas are extremely rich in
wind power and resources, they said the group is planning to install
six turbines there in the initial stage. Each will have the capacity
of between 12 million and 18 million watts, generating 51 million
kilowatt-hours per year, they explained.
</P>
<P>
They said the plan will cause no pollution, low noise, and no
exhaust gas or waste water, and pointed out that electricity
generated by wind energy is increasing at a fast pace of between 15
percent and 30 percent every year in advanced countries such as
Germany and Denmark.
</P>
<P>
In these strictly eco-friendly nations, wind energy has largely
replaced traditional coal, gas, nuclear power or other fossil fuel
for power generation, they said, adding that the group has made
similar investment plans in Brazil, France, mainland China, Spain,
Sweden and Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Investment in wind energy should bring fourth profit. This is
necessary for a sustainable development of renewable energies, a
distinct goal of many governments, Infra Vest said at its Website.
</P>
<P>
It is our strong belief that this goal can only be achieved by
proper plans and commercially viable projects that can also create
local economic benefits, it said, calling wind energy clean,
competitive and inexhaustible that will heed public concerns over
environmental protection and conservation.
</P>
<P>
Infra Vest has already held a seminar in Putai township to
explained the investment plan to local residents. It has gained
security confirmations from the Ministry of National Defense and the
Civil Aeronautics Administration, as well as initial land use
approval from the Kaohsiung Harbor Bureau.
</P>
<P>
At present, the state-run Taiwan Power Company maintains four
wind power turbines in offshore Penghu County and is considering
adding another four due to its better-than-expected capacity, in line
with the Kyoto Pact that will become effective this summer in several
parts of the world to cut emissions of greenhouse gas.

NEW JUSTICE MINISTER VOWS TO CRACK DOWN ON CRIME
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Ministry of Justice (MOJ) will pool the
resources of the prosecution, investigation, police and coast guard
authorities to fight corruption, violence, drug trafficking, sexual
assault, telephone fraud and financial crimes, its new minister said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Justice Shih Mao-lin made the pledge at his first
news conference after assuming office earlier in the day.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the public have high expectations of the MOJ and its
subordinate prosecution and investigation agencies, Shih said he will
reinforce coordination among various law enforcement authorities to
crack down on crime.
</P>
<P>
Priority will be given to economic crimes and cross-border drug
trafficking because they damage social justice and tarnish the
national image, he said.
</P>
<P>
Pointing out that economic and financial crimes can directly
affect the average investor's interests and rights, Shih said the MOJ
will organize more professional training courses for criminal
investigators and prosecutors to upgrade their abilities to
investigate and collect evidence.
</P>
<P>
"By so doing, we'll be able to better maintain overall economic
and market order and achieve social justice," Shih said.
</P>
<P>
He further said the manpower and equipment of the drug-fighting
center under the Ministry of Justice Investigation Bureau (MJIB) will
be expanded to facilitate a crackdown on drug trafficking and abuse.
</P>
<P>
Amid mounting concern about women and children falling victim to
domestic violence and sexual abuse, Shih said the MOJ will cooperate
with police, social welfare and medical administrative agencies to
create a safer living environment and better protect victims of
crime.

ARATS LOOKS FORWARD TO POSITIVE DEVELOPMENT IN CROSS-STRAIT TIES
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei, Feb. 1 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A senior official from mainland
China's quasi-official Association for Relations Across the Taiwan
Strait (ARATS) said in Taipei Tuesday he hopes cross-strait relations
can develop in a positive direction.
</P>
<P>
ARATS Vice President Sun Yafu made the remarks after paying his
tribute to the late Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) Chairman Koo
Chen-fu, who used to be Taiwan's top negotiator with mainland China.
</P>
<P>
Sun, who is concurrently deputy director of the Taiwan Affairs
Office (TAO) of the mainland's State Council, ARATS Secretary-General
Li Yafei, and Ma Xiaoguang, director of the ARATS research
department, arrived in Taiwan earlier in the day to attend Koo's
funeral scheduled for Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Sun said he and Li are representing ARATS President Wang
Daohan to attend Koo's memorial service.
</P>
<P>
Shortly after their arrival, the three ARATS officials paid a
visit to Koo's home and convey Wang's letter of condolence to
Koo's widow.
</P>
<P>
"We have conveyed Wang's heartfelt esteem to Koo," Sun said,
adding that Wang gave high marks for Koo's outstanding contribution
to promoting cross-strait relations and dialogue.
</P>
<P>
Sun said he has also conveyed TAO Director Chen Yun-lin's
esteem and remembrance of Koo.
</P>
<P>
Asked whether his arrival could usher in a new era in
cross-strait relations, Sun said he would not touch on any
cross-strait issue during his brief visit.
</P>
<P>
"We are here simply to pay our last respects for Koo," Sun said.
But he added that he hoeps cross-strait ties can move in a positive
direction in the long run.
</P>
<P>
The three ARATS officials were greeted by SEF Chief Secretary Lin
Shu-min upon their arrival at Chiang Kai-shek International
Airport.
</P>
<P>
Lin extended a warm welcome to the three ARATS officials, saying
that the SEF is grateful that they came to pay their last respects to
the late top Taiwan negotiator with mainland China.
</P>
<P>
Wang, who is in his late 80s, asked Sun and Li to convey a letter
of condolence to Koo's widow. During his meeting with his deputies in
Shanghai Monday, Wang was quoted as having said that he felt
nostalgic about his old friend Koo, and very much wanted to pay his
last respects at Koo's memorial, but was prevented from doing so by
ill health.
</P>
<P>
Koo, a respected business tycoon known for his diplomatic acumen,
held a groundbreaking meeting with Wang in Singapore in 1993 in the
first formal cross-strait contact in more than four decades. He died
Jan. 3 just days before he would have turned 88.
</P>
<P>
The historic Koo-Wang meeting laid the framework for the
quasi-official SEF and ARATS to handle cross-strait exchanges in the
absence of official ties. In 1998, the two envoys met again when Koo
traveled to Shanghai and Beijing to boost further rapprochement.
However, Beijing unilaterally suspended regular SEF-ARATS dialogue in
July 1999, when then-ROC President Lee Teng-hui defined cross-strait
ties as "state-to-state" in nature.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, Chen Yunlin, director of the Taiwan Affairs Office
of the mainland's State Council, said in Beijing that the three ARATS
officials' Taipei trip is not only aimed at expressing the mainland's
esteem for Koo's contributions to the promotion of cross-strait
relations but also at symbolizing the mainland's respect for the
people of Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
"We hope the trio will convey our remembrance and condolences
during their trip to Taipei," Chen said.

OFFICIAL TAPPED FOR DEPUTY PREMIER REQUIRES KMT APPROVAL

<TEXT>
<P>
Opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Vice Chairman
P.K. Chiang said Tuesday that he will serve as deputy premier in the
administration of Premier Frank Hsieh only with the approval of the
KMT.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with a local radio station Tuesday, Chiang, who
has been tapped by Hsieh as his favorite choice for his deputy, said
negotiations between the ruling Democratic Progressive Party and the
KMT on overall policy is necessary before he will agree to serve in
the administration.
</P>
<P>
As a technocrat, Chiang has accumulated wide experience in the
economic sector during the period of KMT rule. He gave Hsieh a
favorable comment recently, describing him as a pragmatic and
respectful political leader.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, KMT lawmaker Lee Chia-ching claimed that the only way
his party will allow Chiang to join the administration is for the DPP
to agree to a coalition with the KMT.
</P>
<P>
If Hsieh and Su Tseng-chang, who is set to take the post of DPP
chairman, pay a call on KMT Chairman Lien Chan before Chinese New
Year, "it is quite possible that Lien will give a green light" to
Chiang's appointment, he went on.
</P>
<P>
A coalition between the DPP and the KMT would give the government
a broad basis, Lee said, adding that if Chiang joins the
administration as deputy premier, "the premier should give him a free
hand in dealing with economic affairs for the benefit of the
country."

<P>
Premier Frank Hsieh confirmed Tuesday that
opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Vice Chairman P.K. Chiang is still his
first choice for deputy premier.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the media, Hsieh said he has approached
Chiang, as well as the KMT, about the possibility of Chiang serving
in his Cabinet and is waiting for a response.
</P>
<P>
Noting that Chiang has served in various posts in the economic
sector of the government as well as a vice president of the
Legislative Yuan, Hsieh said his economic background would help the
Cabinet to deal with economic issues and his relationship with the
lawmakers would help rally their support for Executive Yuan policy.
</P>
<P>
Some KMT heavyweights had suggested that Chiang should join the
administration as a representative of his party rather than as an
individual, and Hsieh said he was trying to find out from the KMT the
exact meaning of this statement.
</P>
<P>
The issue is not pressing, but should be settled before the
Executive Yuan presents its general administrative report to the
Legislative Yuan two weeks from now, he added.

PRESIDENT CHEN PAYS TRIBUTE TO TOP CROSS-STRAIT NEGOTIATOR
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei, Feb. 2 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President Chen Shui-bian said Wednesday that
seeking consensus is the spirit of the groundbreaking "Koo-Wang
talks" of 1993 and also the most precious legacy left to the people
across the Taiwan Strait by the late Koo Chen-fu, who once served as
Taiwan's top negotiator with mainland China.
</P>
<P>
The president made the remarks at the memorial service held at
the Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hall in Taipei Wednesday for Koo, who died
Jan. 3 at the age of 88. Koo, a respected business tycoon known for
his diplomatic acumen, served as the chairman of the intermediary
Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) from 1991 to 2004.
</P>
<P>
In 1993, Koo met with Wang Daohan, president of the Beijing-based
Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait (ARATS) , in
Singapore for the first formal cross-strait contact in more than four
decades, better known as the landmark "Koo-Wang talks."
</P>
<P>
At the memorial service, President Chen offered his condolences
to Koo's family and praised Koo's exceptional contributions to
Taiwan's economic prosperity as well as cross-strait exchanges.
</P>
<P>
Chen said that as SEF chairman, Koo had been on the frontline of
dialogue and communications with mainland China, helping usher
cross-strait exchanges onto a regular track.
</P>
<P>
The 1993 "Koo-Wang talks" were an unprecedented ice-breaking
rendezvous between top negotiators authorized by the governments of
the two sides, while the 1998 "Koo-Wang meeting" was a historical
event representing a step-forward in cross-strait relations, Chen
said.
</P>
<P>
The president lamented the fact that cross-strait dialogue was
suspended indefinitely later in 1998 as a result of changes in the
political climate on both sides of the Taiwan Strait.
</P>
<P>
He quoted Koo as saying at the 10th anniversary of the "Koo-Wang
talks" in April 2003 that because of political differences, it is
imperative that the two sides continue to engage in dialogue based on
respect for each other's differing opinions.
</P>
<P>
He added that bearing Koo's legacy in mind, the two sides should
re-start the long-stalled dialogue and thus unveil a new era in
cross-strait relations, which will pave the way for eventual peace
across the Taiwan Strait.
</P>
<P>
Alluding to Koo's renowned career as an amateur Peking opera
singer, Chen noted that the current cross-strait impasse is like a
drama on stage. He said the key point is whether the leaderships of
the two sides will have the wisdom and insight to jointly face the
cross-strait situation and try to resolve their differences so that
they can, in the words of Koo, "leave the audience impressed when
they leave the stage."
</P>
<P>
Finally, Chen said that he was told by Koo during their last
brief meeting late last year that one thing which always preoccupied
him was not being able to meet with Wang again.
</P>
<P>
In this spirit, Chen said that he extends his personal invitation
to Wang in the hope that Wang will come to visit Taiwan at anytime in
the future at his convenience.
</P>
<P>
Chen also offered his welcome to the two ARATS senior officials
-- Vice President Sun Yafu and Secretary-General Li Yafei -- who
arrived in Taipei Tuesday to pay their last respects to Koo on behalf
of ARATS President Wang Daohan. Sun is also currently deputy director
of the Taiwan Affairs Office of the mainland's State Council.
</P>
<P>
Officials and dignitaries also on hand at Wednesday's memorial
service included Vice President Annette Lu, Premier Frank Hsieh,
Democratic Progress Party Chairman Su Tseng-chang, opposition
Kuomintang Chairman Lien Chan, People First Party Chairman James
Soong, Taiwan Solidarity Union Chairman Su Ching-chiang, and Douglas
Paal, director of the American Institute in Taiwan (AIT) Taipei
Office, as well as more than 50 Japanese politicians and business
executives.

PREMIER TO VISIT KMT CHAIRMAN OVER VICE PREMIER APPOINTMENT
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Premier Frank Hsieh said Wednesday he will
visit opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Lien Chan to discuss his
offer to name one of the KMT's vice chairmen, P.K. Chiang, as his
deputy.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with a local radio station, Hsieh said he hopes
the meeting can take place before next week's Lunar New Year holiday.
</P>
<P>
Hsieh said he contacted Chiang indirectly to extend his offer and
Chiang said he must obtain his party's approval before he can accept
the offer.
</P>
<P>
The KMT has previously ruled that no party member will be allowed
to join the Cabinet in their personal capacity and that they will
have to do so as a representative of the party.
</P>
<P>
Hsieh said he has no idea if the KMT requires simply its approval
or party-to-party negotiations with the ruling Democratic Progressive
Party for such an appointment and that he hopes the meeting with Lien
will help.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that he promised to visit Lien when he assumed the
position of DPP chairman in August 2000, but this promise was never
realized because of the rivalry between the ruling and opposition
parties.
</P>
<P>
Hsieh first disclosed Tuesday that Chiang was still his first
choice for vice premier and that he was waiting for a response from
Chiang and the KMT.
</P>
<P>
Asked about the issue by the press earlier in the day, Lien said
he had not considered the matter.
</P>
<P>
Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng, another KMT vice
chairman, said Hsieh also expressed his hope of recruiting Chiang to
the Cabinet during a meeting with him the previous day, but he had
not discussed the details with Lien.
</P>
<P>
However, KMT legislative caucus leader Huang Teh-fu insisted that
any arrangement for KMT members to join the Cabinet must be based on
a party-to-party agreement.
</P>
<P>
Huang said that if the DPP had been sincere about inviting any
KMT members to join the Cabinet, it should have negotiated with the
KMT before the Cabinet lineup was finalized.

CROSS-STRAIT IMPASSE THAWING BUT ROOM FOR IMPROVEMENT: MAC
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Feb.  2 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Several recent developments indicate that
the cross-Taiwan Strait political impasse has thawed a little,
although there is still room for improvement, Taiwan's top official
in charge of mainland China policy said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) Chairman Joseph Wu was referring
to Beijing's decision to send two senior officials to Taipei to
attend a memorial service for Koo Chen-fu, the late chairman of
Taiwan's quasi-official Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) , who died
Jan. 3 at the age of 88.
</P>
<P>
Wu was also referring to the recent opening of direct
cross-strait charter flight services for the Jan. 29-Feb. 20 Lunar
New Year holiday period, the first of their kind in 56 years.
</P>
<P>
Despite these latest developments, Wu said, cross-strait
relations are still fragile, with Beijing drafting an anti-secession
law targeting Taiwan, continuing to contain Taiwan in the
international community and continuing to mount pressure on Taiwan
militarily.
</P>
<P>
President Chen Shui-bian led the country to pay tribute to Koo at
the memorial service held at the Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hall that day.
During the service, Chen praised Koo's unparalleled contributions to
Taiwan's economic prosperity as well as cross-strait exchanges in his
capacity as a business tycoon and as Taiwan's top negotiator with the
mainland.
</P>
<P>
The president also extended an invitation at the service to Koo's
counterpart in Beijing, Wang Daohan, president of the Association for
Relations Across the Taiwan Strait (ARATS), to visit Taiwan.
Koo and Wang met in Singapore in 1993 for the first
formal cross-strait contact in more than four decades, better known
as the landmark "Koo-Wang talks."
</P>
<P>
Commenting on Chen's invitation, Wu reiterated that the MAC has
on numerous occasions, including several during his tenure, invited
Wang to visit Taiwan. Noting that the invitation still stands, Wu
said the government will roll out the red carpet for him should he
decide to pay a visit.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng said the
arrival of two ARATS senior officials -- Vice President Sun Yafu and
Secretary-General Li Yafei -- to pay their last respects to Koo on
behalf of ARATS President Wang Daohan, indicates that cross-strait
relations are improving. Sun is also currently deputy director of the
Taiwan Affairs Office of the mainland's State Council.
</P>
<P>
Wang Jin-pyng said that should the opportunity present itself, he
would not exclude the possibility of visiting the mainland to help
facilitate cross-strait reconciliation.

<P>
Department of Health (DOH) officials
cautioned people planning to travel to mainland China Wednesday about
an outbreak of epidemic cerebrospinal meningitis in Anhui, Hebei,
Henan, Jiangsu and Sichuan provinces.
</P>
<P>
The officials urged travelers to avoid going to crowded places to
prevent infection and to consider vaccination if they plan to stay on
the mainland for an extended period.
</P>
<P>
According to the DOH, 800 to 1,000 doses of vaccine are available
through any Center for Disease Control (CDC) office and should be
obtained two weeks before departure for the mainland.
</P>
<P>
CDC Deputy Director-General Lin Ting said the DOH has notified
the Veterans Affairs Commission to pass on the message to retired
soldiers who plan to visit their relatives on the mainland during the
Lunar New Year holiday.
</P>
<P>
Lin pointed out that the symptoms of epidemic cerebrospinal
meningitis are similar to those of flu and that treatment with
anti-biotics can help lower the fatality rate of the disease.
</P>
<P>
With a prevalence rate of less than 100 in every 100,000 people,
the mainland is not one of the epidemic areas of epidemic
cerebrospinal meningitis announced by the World Health Organization,
according to the DOH.
</P>
<P>
While approximately 2,200 to 2,600 cases of epidemic
cerebrospinal meningitis were reported annually from 2001 to 2004 on
the mainland, a total of 546 cases have been reported over the past
month.
</P>
<P>
In Taiwan, 20 to 45 cases are reported every year.

Newly inaugurated Justice Minister Shih
Mao-lin pledged Wednesday to continue the government's
anti-corruption operations.
</P>
<P>
Shih said he hopes the anti-corruption operations center under

Shih proposed that the organic law be amended to include a clause

Trying to clarify reports that suggested the ministry has

bank, predicted Wednesday that Asian currencies, including the new
Taiwan dollar, will largely pick up in value against the U.S. dollar
in 2005.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a world economic meeting in Taipei, the bank's
leading economists forecast that the U.S. dollar will continue to
weaken in the future due to the country's huge federal and trade
deficits and a low savings rate. Such a situation, they said, will in
turn prop up the values of Asian currencies this year rather than the
euro, which surged sharply last year.
</P>
<P>
They forecast that the new Taiwan dollar will strengthen the most
against the greenback by 21 percent in the months to come on the
grounds that the local currency appreciated less than the Japanese
yen and the South Korean won last year.
</P>
<P>
The new Taiwan dollar finished at 31.699 against the greenback in
the Taipei foreign exchange market Wednesday. The local currency has
appreciated against the U. S. unit by more than 6 percent over the
past year.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, they contended that mainland China's renminbi
will ease its peg to the U.S. dollar to gain in value in a range
between 5 percent and 10 percent in the initial stage.
</P>
<P>
At the end of this year, the yen and the won will climb to 90 and
to 900 to the U.S. dollar, respectively, they said, adding that the
Hong Kong dollar will be the sole Asian currency to maintain a fixed
currency exchange rate.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the economists are optimistic about the prospects of
Asian economies except for Japan. They estimated that Taiwan's gross
domestic product will grow by 5 percent for 2005 and that the
Japanese economy will expand by only 0.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
They opined that Taiwan will still be competitive thanks to its
relatively advantageous currency exchange rates and labor division
strategy in terms of mainland China. Assessing Taiwan's economic
growth rate at 5 percent for 2005, they pointed out, however, that
Taiwan's fragile relations with the mainland and a bubble property
market that might burst are likely to hinder its economy.
</P>
<P>
They also gave a positive view about the markets of Hong Kong,
the mainland and South Korea, citing reasons such as strong local
demand, a booming middle class, fast urbanization, a freer financial
market and lavish consumers among the younger generation for their
optimism.
</P>
<P>
They said that mainland China will succeed in a soft landing to
stem its high flying economy with an economic growth rate of about
8.8 percent this year and that the mainland will allow its currency
to freely float against other currencies in order to strike a balance
with a continued influx of foreign investment capital. They predicted
that these changes will take place in the short term.

FORMER CABINET SPOKESMAN SWORN IN AS ACTING KAOHSIUNG MAYOR
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Kaohsiung, Feb. 2 (CNA)
(By Y.F. Low)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Former Cabinet spokesman Chen Chi-mai was
sworn in as acting Kaohsiung mayor Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Chen pledged to continue the policies of former mayor Frank Hsieh
and work to develop the port city into the best maritime capital of
Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated that he will stabilize the city government's
relations with the city council through constant consultation and
make the "Kaohsiung experience" a model for other counties and cities
around Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Chen said the so-called "Kaohsiung experience" established by
Hsieh means the replacement of confrontation with consultation and
communication and that Hsieh's philosophy of coexistence has made
Kaohsiung a more beautiful and efficient city and its residents
happier.
</P>
<P>
Chen said he hopes all city government staff will learn to be
creative and innovative and take the initiative to discover and solve
problems for residents in the future.
</P>
<P>
He said he will try his best to exceed Hsieh, whose approval
rating stood at as high as 83 percent.
</P>
<P>
The position of Kaohsiung mayor became vacant after Hsieh was
appointed premier by President Chen Shui-bian. It is widely believed
that the ruling Democratic Progressive Party's decision to name Chen
as acting mayor is aimed at paving the way for his bid to run for
Kaohsiung mayor in 2006.

MAINLAND ENVOY TO REPORT TAIWAN'S INVITATION TO ARATS CHIEF
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Feb.  2 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A visiting mainland Chinese envoy said
Wednesday he will report Taiwan's invitation to mainland China's top
negotiator with the island after his return.
</P>
<P>
Sun Yafu, vice president of the Beijing-based Association for
Relations Across the Taiwan Strait (ARATS) who is concurrently deputy
director of the Taiwan Affairs Office of the mainland's State
Council, made the remarks at Chiang Kai-shek International Airport
prior to his departure for home.
</P>
<P>
Sun, ARATS Secretary-General Li Yafei and Ma Xiaoguang, director
of the ARATS research department, arrived in Taiwan Tuesday to pay
their last respects for the late Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF)
Chairman Koo Chen-fu, a respected business tycoon who once served as
Taiwan's top negotiator with the mainland.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at Koo's memorial service earlier in the day, President
Chen Shui-bian publicly invited Koo's mainland counterpart, ARATS
President Wang Daohan, to visit Taiwan. It marked Chen's first public
invitation to Wang.
</P>
<P>
Asked about his view on Chen's goodwill gesture, Sun said he will
pass on Taiwan's invitation to Wang.
</P>
<P>
"We'll report to Mr. Wang Daohan what we saw, heard and felt
here," Sun told a pack of reporters following him.
</P>
<P>
Sun and the two other ARATS officials didn't personally heard
Chen's invitation to Wang as they didn't show up at Koo's official
memorial service at the National Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hall. The trio
arrived at the memorial hall around noon to skip meetings with
President Chen and other Taiwan political figures.
</P>
<P>
SEF Secretary-General Liu Teh-hsun who is concurrently vice
chairman of Taiwan's Mainland Affairs Council, and SEF Deputy
Secretary-General Jan Jyh-horng greeted the ARATS officials when they
arrived at the memorial hall to pay their tribute to Koo. They shook
hands and exchanged courtesy chats. The brief encounter marked the
first high-level SEF-ARATS contact since the two sides suspended
regular dialogue in mid-1999 over former ROC President Lee Teng-hui's
"state-to-state" remarks.
</P>
<P>
Sun and Li were Wang's personal representatives to pay his
tribute to Koo. They presented flowers and bowed their heads before
Koo's picture. Thye then extended their condolences to Koo's widow,
Cecilia Koo, who asked the duo to convey her "thank-you" letter to
Wang. Shortly after their arrival in Taipei Tuesday, they handed
Wang's letter of condolence to Koo's widow. Wang, who is in his late
80s, said in his letter that he felt nostalgic about his old friend
Koo, and very much wanted to pay his last respects at Koo's memorial,
but was prevented from doing so by ill health.
</P>
<P>
Koo held a groundbreaking meeting with Wang in Singapore in 1993
in the first formal cross-strait contact in more than four decades.
He died Jan. 3 just days before he would have turned 88.
</P>
<P>
The historic Koo-Wang meeting laid the framework for the
quasi-official SEF and ARATS to handle cross-strait exchanges in the
absence of official ties. In 1998, the two envoys met again when Koo
traveled to Shanghai and Beijing to boost further rapprochement.
However, Beijing unilaterally suspended regular SEF-ARATS dialogue in
July 1999, when then-ROC President Lee Teng-hui defined cross-strait
ties as "state-to-state" in nature.
</P>
<P>
After all these years, Sun and Li said prior to their departure
that they feel more and more that the two sides should continue to
promote peaceful and stable cross-strait development and safeguard
peace in the Taiwan Strait.
</P>
<P>
"That will help us promote exchanges between both sides and push
cross-strait relations to a good, positive direction," Sun said.
</P>
<P>
For his part, Li said:"We join the people of Taiwan to mourn Mr.
Koo Chen-fu. We can feel the respect he enjoyed in Taiwan society. I
have been impressed by Koo's active efforts to promote cross-strait
relations."
</P>
<P>
In his eulogy on Koo, President Chen said: "Now it's impossible
for Koo and Wang to meet again. But if Chairman Wang's health and
time allow, we still welcome him to come and visit Taiwan."
</P>
<P>
Chen further said the current cross-strait stalemate like a
drama. Noting that the curtain will eventually fall, Chen said top
leaders on both sides should jointly work for cross-strait peace
based on the legacy left by Koo.

PRESIDENT LOOKS FORWARD TO MEETING WITH OPPOSITION LEADERS: AIDE
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Feb.  2  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President Chen Shui-bian has ordered
preparations for his meetings with top leaders of opposition parties
after the Chinese New Year holiday, Chen's chief of staff said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Presidential Office Secretary-General Yu Shyi-kun made the
remarks in an interview with Formosa Television Co.
</P>
<P>
Yu, who stepped down from the premiership to take over as Chen's
chief of staff a day earlier, said the president has directed him to
arrange for meetings with opposition leaders after the lunar new year
holiday.
</P>
<P>
According to Yu, Chen wants to forge cooperative ties with
opposition parties to facilitate implementation of his major policy
initiatives and reform agenda.
</P>
<P>
Opposition People First Party (PFP) Chairman James Soong told a
news conference earlier in the day that he doesn't rule out meeting
with chen after the lunar new year. But he said working-level staff
members from the two sides should first meet to narrow the gap
between their differences on relations across the Taiwan Strait.
</P>
<P>
On Taiwan's political spectrum, the PFP and Chen's ruling
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) are at opposite ends, with the PFP
prefers to cross-strait unification and the DPP wants Taiwan
independence.
</P>
<P>
If the DPP fails to adjust its pro-independence party charter,
Soong said, he sees little possibility for the two parties to
cooperate. Should this be the case, he added, a meeting between him
and Chen would be meaningless.
</P>
<P>
Responding to Soong's statement, Yu said that if necessary, he
would be willing to meet with opposition leaders, including Soong and
Kuomintang Chairman Lien Chan, to seek their opinions about the
format for the proposed high-level meetings.
</P>
<P>
"President Chen has no bottom line. He will fully respect
opposition leaders' opinions. He can either meet with Lien and Soong
simultaneously or hold separate meetings with them. It's all up to
them to decide on the format," Yu said.
</P>
<P>
As to the agenda, Yu said Chen will respect opposition leaders'
opinions.
</P>
<P>
"The president has given only some principles. He hopes to shelve
controversial topics and focus on major policy issues that are
closely related to people's livelihood, such as crime, improvement of
the national health insurance system and tax reform," Yu said.
</P>
<P>
Asked whether Soong is likely to assume any post related to
cross-strait affairs, Yu said that to the best of his understanding,
new Premier Frank Hsieh has many formal and informal interactions
with PFP and KMT heavyweights in the process of forming the new
Cabinet. Such engagements mainly focused on seeking the possibilities
of cooperation in major legislative bills and didn't touch on any
horse trading, Yu added.
</P>
<P>
There has wide speculation that Chen intends to name PFP chairman
Soong to head the quasi-official Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF)
which is authorized to handle cross-strait exchanges in the absence
of official ties. The first SEF chairman, Koo Chen-fu, died from
renal cancer Jan. 3 at the age of 88.
</P>
<P>
At his news conference, Soong clarified that nobody has ever
asked whether he would take over the SEF chairmanship.

TAIWAN'S IMPORTS AND EXPORTS HIT 51-YEAR HIGH
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Feb.  2 (CNA)
(By Elisa Kao)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taiwan's exports and imports registered
US$174 billion and US$167.9 billion, respectively, in 2004, the
highest level since 1953, officials of the Directorate General of
Budget, Accounting and Statistics (DGBAS) announced Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
DGBAS officials attributed the booming trade to the recovery of
the world economy last year. The exports and the imports in 2004
represented a 20 percent and 30 percent growth over the previous
year, leaving a trade surplus of US$6.1 billion for the country, the
lowest level since 1999.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong and mainland China were the major sources of Taiwan's
trade surplus last year, with its trade surplus with the two areas
registering US$45.1 billion.
</P>
<P>
Japan was the largest source of the island's trade deficit in
2004, with a record high of US$30.4 billion. DGBAS officials noted
that the sharp increase of imports from Japan made the island's trade
surplus shrink to US$6.1 billion last year, the lowest level since
1999.
</P>
<P>
South Korea has become Taiwan's second-largest source of trade
deficit since 1998.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan's efforts in developing high technology in the 1990s have
made its exports of related products, including machinery, electronic
and electrical articles, the island's major source of trade surplus,
exceeding that registered by the textile industry in 1995. The
exports of those products have created an average of US$17.5 billion
in trade surplus during the last 10 years, according to DGBAS
statistics.

WTO OFFICIALS IN TOWN TO UNDERSTAND TAIWAN'S TRADE POLICY
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Feb.  2 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A group of trade policy review officials
from the World Trade Organization (WTO) arrived Wednesday in Taipei
to gain a better understanding of Taiwan's trade policies and
practices that have attributed to its success for future reference
for other WTO member states.
</P>
<P>
Clemens Boonekamp, director of the WTO's Trade Policy Review
Division, and Michael Daly and Masahiro Hayafuji, took part in a
seminar sponsored by the Bureau of Foreign Trade (BOFT) the same day
under the Ministry of Economic Affairs to serve that end.
</P>
<P>
In the meeting, Boonekamp explained the WTO's trade review
mechanisms and process to officials from the Ministry of Foreign
Affairs, the Ministry of Economic Affairs, the Ministry of Finance,
the Financial Supervisory Commission, the Central Bank of China and
the Council of Agriculture, with BOFT Director-General Huang
Chih-peng promising to provide the WTO visitors with all relevant
information.
</P>
<P>
Boonekamp highly praised Taiwan's outstanding performance in
foreign trade and said that many WTO member countries have a keen
interest in getting to know Taiwan's market exploration strategies --
an issue that needs cooperation from the country. Taiwan is an
important economic power, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Daly stressed that the WTO's trade policy review aims to increase
policy transparency among its member states and to step up their
understanding of the body's regulations and rules.
</P>
<P>
According to WTO regulations, the world's four largest economies
must have their trade policies reviewed every two years, while the
economies ranking between fifth and 16th undergo a review every four
years.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan is rated as the world's 14th-largest economy and the WTO
is slated to carry out its first trade policy review of Taiwan in
June 2006 after the country entered the world trade regulatory body
in January 2002.
</P>
<P>
In line with the schedule arranged by the WTO, its secretariat
will send another group of officials to conduct inspections in
November in Taiwan, where they will exchange views with government
officials, enterprise executives, business leaders and academic
researchers.
</P>
<P>
The secretariat will issue a draft report in January 2006, while
Taiwan will have to submit a government report in April the same year
before the WTO calls an official review meeting on June 20 and June
22.

Two Chinese officials who came to Taiwan to
pay homage to the late chief of the Straits Exchange Foundation

The anonymous official said Sun Yafu, the vice chairman of

SEF officials for "a considerable time" although they said before
their departure for Taiwan that they were not going to engage in any

U.S. HOUSE RESOLUTION URGES E.U. NOT TO LIFT ARMS EMBARGO AGAINST CHINA
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Washington, Feb. 2 (CNA)
(By Jorge Liu and P.C. Tang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The U.S. House of Representatives passed
a resolution Wednesday saying that a lifting of the European Union's
arms embargo against mainland China would endanger the security of
Taiwan and U.S. troops stationed in Asia.
</P>
<P>
The resolution urging the European Union to maintain its ban on
arms sales to China was passed by a vote of 114-3.
</P>
<P>
Both the United States and the European Union implemented a ban
on arms sales to China following the 1989 Tiananmen Square Massacre.
</P>
<P>
According to the resolution, China has been engaged in an
extensive military buildup, including the deployment of approximately
500 short range ballistic missiles near the Taiwan Strait. China's
military-industrial complex has also been involved in the transfer to
Iran of certain controlled equipment and technology.
</P>
<P>
British Foreign Minister Jack Straw recently informed Condoleeza
Rice, the new U.S. secretary of state, that the European Union is
ready for a removal of the arms sales ban and that the ban would be
replaced by a"Code of Conduct" regulating E.U. arms exports to third
countries. Several heads of state of E.U. member countries have also
said recently that the ban is expected to be lifted within six
months.
</P>
<P>
During the debate before the resolution was put to a vote, Rep.
Elton Gallegly (R-Calif.) said that a lifting of the E.U. ban would
directly threaten Taiwan, which he called one of the dynamic
democracies in Asia and a close partner of the United States.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Rep. Tom Lantos (D-Calif.) said during the debate that
the European Union's shortsightedness and greedy manner have
demonstrated that it has lost its moral character. He added that the
security of U.S. troops will be directly threatened if the E.U. ban
is lifted.

<P>
Legislators from the various political
parties have reached consensus that the new legislative session will
begin Feb. 25, Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Wang made the remarks after presiding over a consultation meeting
between the ruling and opposition parties on the opening date for the
new legislative session.
</P>
<P>
Ker Chien-ming, acting chairman of the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party, said prior to the meeting that the Procedure
Committee has continued to block the issue of confirmation of those
appointed as members of the Control Yuan, the nation's top watchdog
body, from being put on the legislature's agenda, which he said has
resulted in constitutional conflict.
</P>
<P>
Ker expressed the hope that Wang will make the confirmation issue
a top priority and that the review and confirmation will take place
right after the Chinese New Year holidays.
</P>
<P>
However, Huang Teh-fu, legislative whip of the opposition
Kuomintang caucus, claimed that the name list of Control Yuan
nominees put forward by President Chen has failed to receive a
positive response from the public. Huang said he hopes that President
Chen will consult with the opposition parties and put forward a new
name list after the opening of the new legislative session.
</P>
<P>
"Otherwise, President Chen's stated intention to work for
inter-party reconciliation will prove to be just empty words, " Huang
said.

A growing discipline crisis and thousands of persistently failing
schools are undermining efforts to raise education standards, the
head of Ofsted gave warning yesterday.

David Bell said that one in ten schools had made no real progress
between inspection visits in the past three years.

Of the 10,000 schools visited since 2001, a tenth had made
"unsatisfactory, poor or very poor" progress. Applied to England's
total number of state schools, this would produce a figure of 2,500
schools that had made no real progress nationwide.



Financial Times: Big three unions in talks on merger.

Three of Britain's biggest trade unions are expected to begin
exploratory merger talks on creating a "super-union" that would
match in size Germany's IG Metall, one of Europe's largest, and
boast huge industrial and political clout. 

The three private sector unions - Amicus, the Transport and
General Workers Union and the GMB - have between them some
2.6m members in manufacturing, the financial services industry,
energy and the public sector. 

A merger could give them greater influence over policy debate
in Tony Blair's Labour party because of the number of votes they
would have at its annual conferences.

hardworking, " a government- sponsored survey released Thursday
indicated.
</P>

Lin Chia-lung, director-general of the Government Information

most foreign nationals visiting or living in Taiwan consider the
Taiwanese people to be "friendly, diligent and polite."
</P>
<P>
The foreigners who responded said that Taiwan society is
"diverse, dynamic, competitive and safe, with family values being the
binding force of society," according to Lin.
</P>
<P>
The GIO survey was conducted by Shih Hsin University from Oct. 26
to Dec. 31, 2004 under a publicity program aimed at bettering
Taiwan's image in the international community. The poll of randomly
chosen foreign nationals, including tourists, business people,
students and expatriates, was conducted via face-to-face interviews
and gathered 1,033 valid responses. The survey had a margin of error
of plus or minus 3.04 percent.
</P>
<P>
As for the government in Taiwan, the poll found that more than
half of the responding foreigners thought that Taiwan's
democratization and media freedoms are commendable.
</P>
<P>
In general, those foreigners who had stayed in Taiwan longer,
were older, had higher educational backgrounds and frequently
socialized with local people had a higher regard for the people of
Taiwan and society in general, Lin said.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan is considered by nearly 70 percent of the responding
foreigners as having outperformed most of the countries in the world
in terms of economic growth and science and technological
development, according to the poll.

<P>
More than 80 percent of the respondents thought that Taiwan
surpasses mainland China in almost every aspect, particularly in
democratization.
</P>

On Taiwan's tourist attractions, the foreigners said that local
foods and snacks are the top magnet, followed by cultural aspects,
shopping, nighttime activities and historical sites, in that order.
</P>
<P>
As to Taiwan's shortcomings, the foreigners said that

<P>
He also said that the format and meeting place is flexible and

The issues to be discussed will focus on major policies related

President Chen has suggested discussing such things as the
national health insurance system and tax reforms, he added.

The Taiwan public opened their hearts and wallets as well when
the Government Information Office (GIO) called for donations to raise
funds to sponsor 10,000 children affected by the tsunami catastrophe
in South and Southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
In two weeks, NT$400.95 million in cash was raised after the GIO
launched its "Day after Tomorrow, 10,000 Hopes" fundraising drive,
hoping to sponsor 10,000 tsunami-affected children for one year, Lin
said.
</P>
<P>
The GIO signed a contract with Hua Nan Commercial Bank Thursday
for the formation of a trust fund to manage the donated money and
ensure that the donations are used correctly and wisely.
</P>
<P>
The GIO also forged contracts with three private organizations;
namely, the Taiwan Fund For Children and Families, World Vision
Taiwan and the Buddhist Compassionate Relief Tzu Chi Foundation,
which are commissioned to plan how to use the funds.
</P>
<P>
Part of the funds will also be used to finance programs
benefiting poor children in Taiwan, according to GIO officials.

DIFFERENCES OVER 'ONE CHINA" ISSUE KEY TO CROSS-STRAIT TIES: MAC
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Hong Kong,  Feb. 3 (CNA)
(By Lin Yu-kuo and Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The differences between the two sides of
the Taiwan Strait over the issue of "one China" are key to
cross-strait relations, an official in charge of Taiwan's mainland
China policy said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Chiu Tai-san, vice chairman of the Mainland Affairs Council, made
the remarks during an interview by the pro-Beijing daily Wen Wei Po
in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
He said that if both sides of the Taiwan Strait can take a cue
from the launch of the cross-strait charter flights during the
Chinese New Year holiday, leave political factors out and try to
understand the problems and pressures faced by each side, then
cross-strait relations are bound to be improved.
</P>
<P>
He also stressed several times that Beijing has no need to
formulate an "anti-secession law," which he said he was worried could
only lead to cross-strait tensions. The proposed law will be screened
and put before the full National People's Congress in March for
approval.
</P>
<P>
The mainland should use "new thinking, " Chiu said, adding that
both sides have no need to continued wasting their energies by
needlessly going in circles on the "one China" issue; otherwise,
Taiwan's maneuvering space in the international community could
shrink and thereby increase the calls by those in Taiwan for
independence.
</P>
<P>
Chiu said the basic tone of the ruling Democratic Progressive
Party (DPP) is clear, and that President Chen Shui-bian made this
clear in his second inaugural address on May 20, 2004.
</P>
<P>
The chances of Taiwan acting upon its underlying sentiments
regarding "one China" are slim, Chiu said, adding, "We understand
that the mainland has misgivings about Taiwan's writing a new
constitution in 2006."
</P>
<P>
The DPP will soon unveil the content of the revised constitution,
which will prove non-controversial, Chiu said, citing as examples
whether the nation will follow "the presidential or Cabinet system, "
or if absolute majority or simple majority should be followed in the
presidential election, or whether to continue to promote legislative
reforms.
</P>
<P>
"If the mainland puts on a tough face during this period, it will
by no means be good timing or a shrewd move," Chiu said.
</P>
<P>
He also said that Taiwan thinks that the mainland is "continuing
to be tough, " so that Taipei has to make assessments on another
level.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan thinks being heavy-handed is unnecessary and that it will
undermine the status quo across the Taiwan Strait, and the
'anti-secession law', whatever it contains, is certain to bring more
risks to cross-strait exchanges, especially its definition of
'secession,' Chiu said.

KMT VICE CHAIRMAN REJECTS OFFER TO BECOME VICE PREMIER
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Feb. 3 (CNA)
(By Y.F. Low)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Vice Chairman
P.K. Chiang turned down Premier Frank Hsieh's offer Thursday to
assume the position of vice premier.
</P>
<P>
Chiang told reporters that any such appointments should have been
arranged through party-to-party negotiations before the new Cabinet
was formed and that it would be meaningless for him to enter the
Cabinet as an individual who enjoys no support or endorsement from
his party.
</P>
<P>
Hsieh has openly expressed his intention to name Chiang as his
deputy over the past two days and said he hoped to visit KMT Chairman
Lien Chan before next week's Lunar New Year holiday to discuss the
matter.
</P>
<P>
According to Chiang, Hsieh had before that inquired as to his
attitude towards the appointment through a friend and he immediately
rejected the offer.
</P>
<P>
Chiang said he did not expect the matter would remain a news
item.
</P>
<P>
Chiang stressed that if the ruling Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) intends to recruit any opposition members to join the Cabinet,
it must negotiate with the concerned party for a party-to-party
agreement, which he said is a symbol of ruling and opposition
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Otherwise, Chiang said, the same old story will be repeated of
former Premier Tang Fei, who accepted President Chen Shui-bian's
appointment in 2000 without the KMT's blessing and stepped down
months later over disagreements with the DPP over the Fourth Nuclear
Power Plant project.
</P>
<P>
Through party-to-party negotiations, the KMT could at least make
sure that the DPP would not put forth any controversial policies that
are likely to lead to partisan confrontations and tensions, Chiang
said.
</P>
<P>
Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou, another KMT vice chairman, said Hsieh
had asked him to help talk to Lien about his plan to appoint Chiang
vice premier but Lien had shown little interest in such an
arrangement.
</P>
<P>
According to Ma, Lien does not think appointing Chiang vice
premier will be of any help to inter-party consultations and
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Lien believes that any form of inter-party cooperation must be
attained through party-to-party negotiations, rather than by
recruiting an individual opposition member to join the Cabinet, Ma
said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, acting DPP Chairman Ker Chien-ming said whether the
KMT will allow Chiang to enter the Cabinet is a matter of whether it
is willing to adjust its way of thinking.
</P>
<P>
Ker said he will do his best to help Hsieh with the matter.

LEGISLATIVE HEAD OFFERS TO TALK WITH MAINLAND ON 'ANTI-SESSION LAW'

<P>
Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng said
Thursday that he is willing to lead a legislative delegation to visit
mainland China to ease cross-strait tensions.
</P>
<P>
Wang said that the Legislative Yuan is willing to play a more
positive and active role in breaking through the cross-strait
impasse, but this will require goodwill on the part of the
administrative branch, and such goodwill will have to include its
attitude toward the issue of Taiwan independence, something that
could trigger an attack by Beijing.
</P>
<P>
He said that a cross-strait crisis contingency team in the
legislature will be formed as soon as the new legislative session
opens on Feb. 25, and that it will discuss how to restart stalled
cross-strait dialogue and build cross-strait mutual trust.
</P>
<P>
Wang also said that the mainland will start to discuss the
legislation of its proposed "anti-secession law" in April, which he
worries will increase cross-strait tensions if passed.
</P>
<P>
He also said that it is more feasible for the legislative bodies
from both sides of the Taiwan Strait to communicate on the promotion
of cross-strait peace, hoping that even if Beijing is set on creating
the law, if could delay its legislation so that there would be more
time and space for cross-strait peace.
</P>
<P>
As long as both sides can agree to put aside sensitive political
ideologies, they can talk productively about the more substantive
issues of direct cross-strait charter flights and the opening of
mainland tourists to Taiwan, he added.

DIRECT CROSS-STRAIT LINKS HIGHEST HOPE FOR BUSINESSES: CICD

<TEXT>
<P>
A business group has urged the opening of
direct cross-Taiwan Strait trade, postal and transport links, saying
that direct links best meet the hopes of the business sector.
</P>
<P>
Kuo Tai-chiang, president of the Council for Industrial and
Commercial Development, made the remarks as he and Legislator Chu
Feng-chi of the opposition Kuomintang (KMT) released the results of a
survey of more than 800 dome
stic enterprises.
</P>
<P>
According to the survey results, most of the respondents think
the nation most needs to solve its economic problems, followed by the
bickering among the political parties and cross-strait issues.
</P>
<P>
On cross-strait rations, 85.9 percent of the respondents said
they are dissatisfied, while 78.8 percent said cross-strait trade and
economic exchanges are too slow and that direct trade, postal and
transportation links should be at the top of cross-strait policy,
followed by bilateral consultations.
</P>
<P>
Kuo said the respondents believe a good premier should have the
attributes of vision and planning, followed by leadership and
international perspective. 
</P>
<P>
The respondents also said that KMT's P. K. Chiang, former
legislative vice speaker and long-term chairman of the Council for
Economic Planning and Development, and the new Premier Frank Hsieh
best qualify for the post.

CENTRAL BANK MIGHT RAISE INTEREST RATES IN LATE MARCH
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Feb. 3 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taiwan's Central Bank of China (CBC) might
follow the United States by raising key interest rates in late March,
probably within a range of between a quarter percentage point and an
eighth percentage point, market watchers said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Their comment came after the U.S. Federal Reserve (Fed) announced
a fresh interest rate hike of a quarter percentage point a day
earlier, pushing up its key interest rates to an average level of 2.5
percent.
</P>
<P>
The market analysts predicted that the CBC might follow in the
footsteps of the United States after holding a meeting of its board
of directors and supervisors in late March, when the Fed is expected
to raise its rates by another one quarter percentage point.
</P>
<P>
The CBC will be more likely to increase rates by 0.125 percentage
points at the end of next month and is expected to keep on doing so
piecemeal in the future, they said, adding that power and water rate
increases and possible fallout in the economy are factors that could
contribute changes to the bank's moves.

KMT CALLS FOR NEGOTIATIONS OVER VICE PREMIER APPOINTMENT
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Feb. 3 (CNA)
(By Y.F. Low)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Lien
Chan set party-to-party negotiations Thursday as the condition for
allowing one of the party's vice chairmen, P.K. Chiang, to join the
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) administration as vice premier.
</P>
<P>
Over the past two days, Premier Frank Hsieh has openly expressed
his desire to appoint Chiang as his deputy and has said he hopes to
visit Lien before next week's Lunar New Year holiday to discuss the
matter.
</P>
<P>
Responding to the issue through the party's spokesman Chang
Jung-kung, Lien said he appreciates Hsieh's offer but believes such
an appointment must be arranged through party-to-party negotiations
in order to avoid a repeat of the mistake made by former Premier Tang
Fei.
</P>
<P>
Lien was referring to Tang's decision to accept President Chen
Shui-bian's offer to become premier in 2000 without the KMT's
blessing. Tang stepped down just a few months after assuming the
position over disagreements with the DPP over the Fourth Nuclear
Power Plant project.
</P>
<P>
Before the KMT accepts the DPP's offer to appoint Chiang, Lien
proposed that the two parties negotiate first to clarify and seek
consensus on divided issues such as the country's status, opening
direct transportation links with mainland China, plans to change the
official name of the country, investigations into last year's
presidential election-eve shooting of President Chen Shui-bian, and
attempts to liquidate the KMT's ill-gotten assets, in addition to the
controversial power plant project.
</P>
<P>
Also, the two parties need to negotiate on how much authorization
Chiang will enjoy as vice premier to ensure he will not be just a
dummy in the DPP government, Lien said.
</P>
<P>
Lien said the KMT hopes for partisan reconciliation, cross-Taiwan
Strait peace and economic prosperity for the sake of national
development.
</P>
<P>
The KMT last proposed in December that the DPP form a coalition
government through party-to-party negotiations, according to the
results of the legislative elections in which the DPP failed to gain
an absolute majority. The KMT also recommended that Chen appoint
Chiang as premier.
</P>
<P>
The proposal was ignored by the DPP.

NO STRINGS ATTACHED TO OFFER OF CABINET JOB TO KMT LEADER: PREMIER
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei, Feb. 3 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Premier Frank Hsieh said Thursday that there
are no strings attached to his offer of deputy premiership to
opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Vice Chairman P.K. Chiang.
</P>
<P>
Chiang's party would not be obliged to support his Cabinet's
policies if it were to give the green light to Chiang to take up the
offer, Hsieh said.
</P>
<P>
At an informal gathering held by the Executive Yuan, Hsieh said
he asked Chiang to join the Cabinet because of Chiang's experience as
one of the country's former economic architects, his knowledge would
be put to better use in the Cabinet than in the legislature where
Chiang serves as a lawmaker.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, Chiang's participation in the Cabinet would
demonstrate that there is the possibility of cooperation between the
ruling and opposition parties, Hsieh said.
</P>
<P>
The premier expressed reservations about some KMT lawmakers' idea
that negotiations between the ruling Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) and the KMT should go forward before the KMT had even
considered agreeing to Chiang's participation in the Cabinet, saying
that negotiations would inevitable result in agreements covering each
others' rights and obligations, which is not appropriate in this
case.
</P>
<P>
What's more, Hsieh said, any negotiations involving the DPP
should be carried out by the chief of the DPP, not by the premier.
</P>
<P>
Hsieh said his chief aide, Lee Ying-yuan, has contacted KMT
Secretary-General Lin Fong-cheng with the view of lining up a meeting
between the premier and KMT Chairman Lien Chan to study the
possibility of having Chiang join the Cabinet.
</P>
<P>
The issue is not pressing, Hsieh said, but it's better to be
settled one week before the Legislative Yuan gathers for its new
session on Feb. 25.

PRESIDENT MUM ON  RED ENVELOPE MONEY
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President Chen Shui-bian has not disclosed
how much money will be in the red envelops he traditionally hands out
to neighbors in his hometown of Kuantien, Tainan County, at Chinese
New Year, according to Ho Yuan-po, the Kuantien township chief.
</P>
<P>
With only five days to go before the Feb. 9 New Year's day, Ho
said there is no suggestion as to how much money the president will
put in his red envelopes, which are traditional gifts given to each
other by Chinese on New Year's day.
</P>
<P>
Chen has handed out red envelopes to his neighbors every year
since he was elected president in 2000, Ho said.
</P>
<P>
Usually, they contain NT$200 (US$6.25) , but the money was
replaced last year by a NT$10 memorial coin because the presidential
election in March sparked fear that the NT$200 might be considered by
Chen's political rivals as vote-buying money.
</P>
<P>
The president's aides used to inform officials at the Kuantien
Town Hall of how much money Chen would hand out, but Ho said he has
not been informed this year.
</P>
<P>
Enthusiastic neighbors, who consider a red envelope from the
president more of a charm than a windfall, did not seem to care about
the money, judging by the long line of chairs -- each one
representing a person's place in the line -- already formed in front
of Chen's home.
</P>
<P>
Chen also used to host a lunch party for leaders of his home town
on New Year's day. About 1,000 people were invited to the party last
year, but only about 500 have been invited this year, according to
Ho.
</P>
<P>
The party will be held in Liuying, Tainan County, and all guests
will be subject to maximum security checks, which has not been the
case in the past, Ho said.

The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) has
sent personnel from India to neighboring Nepal, which has been placed
in a state of emergency, to help Taiwan tourists get out of the
country, a MOFA spokesman said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
According to the MOFA official, Nepal remains stable and air
travel has been reopened for the time being after being closed down
by the monarch. No unrest or conflict has erupted, they said, noting
that the ministry sent officials earlier in the day to help visitors
from Taiwan to leave.
</P>
<P>
The ministry has issued a "red" travel advisory for Nepal and is
cooperating with the Tourism Bureau in keeping a close watch on the
country, he said.
</P>
<P>
As of Feb. 1, when the Nepal's King Gyanendra sacked the prime
minister and declared a state of emergency for his failure to hold
elections or halt a Maoist rebellion, a total of 165 Taiwan tourists
were in the country at the time, 72 of whom had returned to Taiwan as
of late Thursday, he said.
</P>
<P>
Information provided by Taiwan tourism agencies shows that the
Taiwan tourists still in Nepal are safe. Nepal has imposed no
restrictions on foreign visitors.

Gyanendar said that he would build a new government to rekindle

VISAS FOR THAI WORKERS POSTPONED: CLA

<P>
A visa rift between Taiwan and Thailand has
created a new complication, as the Cabinet-level Council of Labor
Affairs (CLA) announced Thursday that Thai workers applying to work
in Taiwan will not get their visas until 60 days later.
</P>
<P>
According to a CLA official, Thai workers who applied for a work
visa Dec. 15 were originally to get their visas Wednesday after a
35-day processing period.
</P>
<P>
However, they will have to wait until April to receive their
visas to enter Taiwan due to a failure by the Thai government to give
an explanation about its refusal to grant a courtesy visa late last
year to CLA Chairwoman Chen Chu, who was planning to take part in a
bilateral labor affairs meeting in Thailand, the official said.
</P>
<P>
The Thai government failed to live up to a pledge it made earlier
to Taiwan, and issued only a tourist visa to Chen, he explained.
</P>
<P>
On the grounds that Thailand has broken its promise to carry out
two-way cooperation based on respect and reciprocity, the CLA has
decided to postpone until April the issuance of the batch of visas
that should have been due a day earlier, he added.

<TEXT>
<P>
The charter flights between Taiwan and
mainland China during the Chinese New Year holiday period have paved
the way for dialogue between the two sides and offer an opportunity
for positive engagement, the Council for Economic Planning and
Development under the Executive Yuan said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The council made the statement in response to the results of a
survey released the previous day that most businessmen believe that
direct transport links with the mainland and the easing of strain
with the mainland should be the top priorities of the government's
economic policy.
</P>
<P>
In an attempt to ease local businessmen's clamor for direct
transport links with the mainland, the council rattled off the mantra
used by the government that it is an established policy to open
direct transport links with the mainland on the condition that such
talks do not compromise the country's safety and dignity.
</P>
<P>
The council noted in the statement that President Chen Shui-bian,
in his Double Ten Day speech, asked related government agencies to
push for charter flights between Taiwan and China for passengers and
cargo, which resulted in the Chinese New Year holiday charter
flights.
</P>
<P>
It assured the business world that Chen's administration will
press for the opening of direct transport links with the mainland
steadily and pragmatically.

<P>
In an attempt to halt construction of
Taiwan's proposed eighth naphtha cracking plant and a large steel
mill, which recently received government approval, environmental
activists from Green Party Taiwan are planning to solicit support
from their Asian-Pacific counterparts.
</P>
<P>
A delegation of Green Party Taiwan activists, to be led by Prof.
Yenwen Peng from Tunghai University, is scheduled to take part in the
Asia-Pacific Greens Kyoto Meeting set for Feb. 11-13 in Kyoto, Japan,
marking the establishment of the Asia-Pacific Greens Network,
according to Peng.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, the Green Party Taiwan delegates will
exchange views with their Asian-Pacific counterparts on several
issues, including reduction of greenhouse gas emissions as well as
regional security.
</P>
<P>
The Green Party Taiwan members will also solicit support from
meeting participants in their efforts to stop the proposed
construction of Taiwan's eighth naphtha cracking plant by the Formosa
Plastics Group as well as the proposed construction of a large steel
mill by Chinese Petroleum Corp.

The Kyoto Protocol, which was negotiated in 1997 and has been signed
by most of the U.N. member countries, is scheduled to enter into

The Times: Cover-up row over £27 billion
secret of Black Wednesday. 

Highly sensitive Treasury papers on the events leading to
Black Wednesday in 1992 are being kept secret at the request
of John Major and Lord Lamont of Lerwick, Prime Minister and
Chancellor at the time, The Times has learnt. 

Senior Treasury officials are furious that the documents, which
should have been published under the Freedom of Information Act
on Tuesday, are being held back, apparently on the orders of Sir
Andrew Turnbull, the Cabinet Secretary, to give Mr Major and Lord
Lamont more time to study them. 

The delay has raised fears among Treasury officials that
publication could be delayed indefinitely, or that key passages
will be removed to prevent embarrassment to figures in one of the
most humiliating episodes in recent economic history, when
Britain left the European exchange-rate mechanism on September
16, 1992, and the Bank of England reputedly spent £27 billion of
reserves propping up sterling.

<P>
Senior presidential adviser Wu Li-pei,
who headed the Republic of China delegation to the U.S. National
Prayer Breakfast Thursday, said Taiwan can learn from the gathering
which brought together people of different political views.
</P>
<P>
The prayer breakfast, held at the Hilton Hotel in Washington,
D.C., was attended by U.S. President George W. Bush, many senior U.S.
officials and members of Congress, as well as political, diplomatic,
religious and business leaders from various countries around the
world.
</P>
<P>
The members of the ROC delegation included Parris H. Chang,
deputy secretary-general of the National Security Council; Chan
Chi-shean, advisor to President Chen Shui-bian; Theodore M. H. Huang,
chairman of the National Association of Industry and Commerce; Liu
Shyh-fang, former secretary-general of the Executive Yuan; and

</P>
<P>
Pointing out that he has noticed Beijing's recent goodwill toward
Taiwan, including agreeing to launch special cross-strait Lunar New
Year charter flights and sending envoys to participate in the funeral
ceremony for Koo Chen-Fu, the late chairman of Taiwan's Straits
Exchange Foundation, Wu said that mainland China has finally
responded to the goodwill that Taiwan has shown it for a long time.
</P>
<P>
Wu said the two sides should hold consultations and expressed the
hope that Beijing would not use its proposed anti-secession law to
escalate tensions in the Taiwan Strait. Wu also said he hopes the
United States will work to prevent China from unilaterally changing
the status quo in the Taiwan Strait.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Parris Chang said that officials, legislators and the
media in the United States should openly voice their opposition to
China's proposed anti-secession law which is widely seen as being
aimed at Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Apart from attending the 2005 National Prayer Breakfast
gathering, the delegation will also call on Washington-based think
tanks, including the Heritage Foundation, as well as members of
Congress and Bush administration officials to exchange views on
issues related to China's proposed anti-secession law.
</P>
<P>
According to Chang, the delegation will also express Taiwan's
wish to conclude a free trade agreement with United States as soon as

reconciliation among people despite their political differences,
expressing the hope that legislators in Taiwan can learn from this
and work together for the common welfare of the people.

Meanwhile, Yuan said that he explained the KMT-PFP position on
maintaining the cross-strait status quo to a political advisor to

<P>
Premier Frank Hsieh hopes to learn as soon
as possible whether opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Vice Chairman P.K.
Chiang will accept the position as his deputy, Legislative Yuan
Speaker Wang Jin-pyng said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Wang made the remarks after Hsieh called on him at the
Legislative Yuan.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was mainly to exchange views on the current political
situation, as well as on the exchanges between the executive and
legislative branches, Wang said.
</P>
<P>
Hsieh has offered the post of vice premier to Chiang, but the
latter has said any such appointment should have been arranged
through party-to-party negotiations before the new Cabinet was formed
and that it would be meaningless for him to enter the Cabinet as an
individual with no support or endorsement from his party.
</P>
<P>
According to Wang, Hsieh said that party-to-party consultations
is a matter between parties and that it is therefore "not
appropriate" for him to get involved.
</P>
<P>
Wang quoted Hsieh as saying that it would be best if Chiang could
serve in the post, but if that's not possible, he hopes to know as
soon as possible in order to consider other candidates.
</P>
<P>
Hsieh, during his second meeting with Wang since assuming office
Feb. 1, also said the Executive Yuan will not ask the legislature to
review several controversial bills so as avoid confrontation between
the executive and legislative branches, according to Wang.
</P>
<P>
Hsieh also said the most pressing issue the Executive Yuan faces
is revamping the financially troubled national health insurance
system.

New York Times: Shiite Coalition takes
a Big Lead in Early Vote Count in Iraq

Preliminary election returns released Thursday by Iraqi 
authorities showed that 72 percent of the 1.6 million votes 
counted so far from Sunday's election went to an alliance of 
Shiite parties dominated by religious groups with strong links 
to Iran. Only 18 percent went to a group led by Prime Minister 
Ayad Allawi, a secular Shiite who favors strong ties to the 
United States. Few votes went to Sunni candidates. Although 
the early votes were drawn only from Baghdad and from five 
southern provinces where the Shiite parties were expected to 
score strongly, and from only 10 percent of the 5,216 polling 
stations, the scale of the vote for both religious and secular 
Shiites underscored the probability of a crushing triumph and 
a historic shift from decades of Sunni minority rule in Iraq. 

Wall Street Journal: Deep in Sahara, BP Tries to Put Dent in
Global Warming

British Petroleum, one of the world's biggest energy

global-warming problem: Bury it. At a new natural-gas processing 
plant in Sahara, BP PLC and two partners have spent US$100 
million to take carbon dioxide that otherwise would be sent into 
the air and put it back where it came from: a mile underground. 
With the Kyoto Protocol, the treaty limiting global-warming 
emissions in most industrialized nations, set to enter into force 
Feb. 16, companies that will have to curb their emissions 
in compliance with their countries' caps are scrambling to figure 
out how to do so without killing their bottom lines.

PREMIER CALLS FOR LEGISLATIVE SUPPORT TO SAVE HEALTH PROGRAM
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Feb.  4 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Premier Frank Hsieh called Friday for
support from the Legislative Yuan for several proposed amendments to
related statutes to help save the national health insurance program
from bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
Hsieh met with Legislative Yuan Speak Wang Jin-pyng to seek
legislative support for several proposed amendments to several
existing laws to allow for transferring tobacco and liquor tax
revenues to support the financially troubled national health
insurance program.
</P>
<P>
Hsieh said that the health insurance program's reserve funds will
run out by the end of March and that the program is expected to be on
the brink of collapse should no extra funds be infused after March.
</P>
<P>
The premier noted that implementing a proposed second-generation
health insurance program -- currently in the pipelines at the
Department of Health (DOH) -- under which premiums would be
calculated based on a person's total income as opposed to just their
salary, also requires the Legislative Yuan's support to be passed
into law.
</P>
<P>
Under this proposed new health insurance program, premium
ceilings would be adjusted upwardly, requiring that people with
higher incomes share a greater burden in supporting the program.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the proposed second-generation program, Wang said
that it makes sense to him and that the issue can be brought to the
Legislative Yuan floor for discussion.

Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng
reaffirmed Friday that he is willing to lead a delegation to visit
mainland China to ease cross-strait tensions, but only if he is given
some bargaining authority from the administration.
</P>
<P>
Noting that mainland China's proposed "anti-secession law" will
have a damaging effect on Taiwan if it is passed into law, Wang said
that if the chance arises, he will visit the mainland to communicate
with Beijing on the matter.
</P>
<P>
However, he stressed that "without any bargaining authority,
there is no use in making such a visit."

When asked about opposition People First Party Chairman James

OPPOSITION APPEALS COURT RULING ON PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION DISPUTE
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Feb.  4 (CNA)
(By Y.F. Low)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The opposition "pan-blue alliance" of the
Kuomintang (KMT) and People First Party (PFP) appealed to the Supreme
Court Friday after its bid to have last year's presidential election
nullified was rejected by the High Court.
</P>
<P>
The alliance alleges that the results of the election were swayed
by various electoral scandals, a referendum held on the same day of
the election, the activation of a "national security mechanism" that
they claim barred a number of police and military servicemen from
going to the polls, and the election-eve shooting of President Chen
Shui-bian.
</P>
<P>
However, the Taiwan High Court ruled Dec. 30 that the claims made
by the two plaintiffs -- KMT Chairman Lien Chan and PFP Chairman
James Soong, who were beaten in the presidential election by Chen --
could not stand up in court.
</P>
<P>
A legal team led by Lee Tzung-teh said it lodged an appeal
claiming that the ruling is "in violation of the law."
</P>
<P>
According to Lee, the High Court unlawfully turned down the
plaintiffs' requests to review the electoral rolls and to obtain
audio CDs recording the court hearings.
</P>
<P>
Lee further accused the court of taking unlawful command of the
lawsuit and failing in its duty for not making a judgment on whether
it was lawful for the Central Election Commission (CEC) to hold the
referendum simultaneously with the presidential election.
</P>
<P>
Also, Lee said, the court rejected evidence put forth by the
plaintiffs that the secrecy of the vote was compromised because the
referendum was held alongside the election, but did not provide any
rationale for its decision.
</P>
<P>
Lee said the points mentioned above are only a few among the
numerous irregularities in the case and that it is inconceivable that
such an important judicial case was processed with such low quality.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the development, ruling Democratic Progressive
Party (DPP) Chairman-elect Su Tseng-chang said his party respects the
KMT's and PFP's right to lodge an appeal.
</P>
<P>
He also urged the two parties to respect the court's judgment and
the judicial system.
</P>
<P>
Incoming DPP Secretary-General Lee Yi-yang said the "pan-blue
alliance" set a bad example by suggesting there was political
influence behind the court's ruling.
</P>
<P>
Lee said he hopes the KMT and PFP will accept the final result to
be released by the Supreme Court and put an end to partisan
confrontation to meet public expectations for political
reconciliation.

PROPOSED CROSS-STRAIT PEACE PROMOTION LAW MAY POSE ADDITIONAL TROUBLE
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei, Feb. 4 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A cross-Taiwan Strait peace promotion law
proposed by the opposition People First Party (PFP) could be caught
up in the existing political disputes and pose additional problems,
an official in charge of mainland China policy said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Chiu Tai-san, vice chairman of the Mainland Affairs Council
(MAC) , made the remarks amid reports that President Chen Shui-bian
was irritated about the proposed law, believing it will seriously
infringe upon the rights of the president with regard to
decision-making on cross-strait issues.
</P>
<P>
According to the draft law unveiled by the PFP in October, a
cross-strait peace consultation special committee would be
established under the law that would be able to negotiate and consult
with the mainland authorities without the authorization of the
president.
</P>
<P>
Any cross-strait peace agreement signed by the committee and
approved by the Legislative Yuan would become effective after being
put to a public referendum. The resolutions and suggested laws passed
by the committee and approved by the legislature would be binding for
government agencies, according to the draft law.
</P>
<P>
Chiu noted that both sides of the Taiwan Strait have tried to put
aside political differences that are unlikely to be resolved in the
short term. If the PFP promotes its proposed law, it will only jump
right into yet another political dispute that will only add
unnecessary trouble without providing substantial assistance, he
said.
</P>
<P>
On a proposed "anti-secession law" on the mainland designed to
prevent Taiwan from declaring independence, Chiu said the proposed
law will not help create an atmosphere favorable to cross-strait
goodwill.
</P>
<P>
The international community also thinks it is unnecessary to
formulate such a law and that it will not be conducive to the
development of cross-strait relations, he continued.
</P>
<P>
On Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng's expressed intention
to go to the mainland to communicate with Beijing on the proposed
"anti-secession law, " Chiu said that any individuals or political
parties who want to contribute to the positive development of
cross-strait relations, as long they act in line with the pace and
direction of the government, are welcome to do so.

GOODWILL RHETORIC NEEDS BACKUP WITH ACTION: MAC
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei, Feb. 4 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) Vice Chairman
Chiu Tai-san expressed welcome Friday to remarks made by a senior
Beijing official in charge of Taiwan affairs that "the two
intermediary bodies across the Taiwan Strait are expected to continue
to maintain good relations in the future, " saying that it is
definitely a goodwill overture.
</P>
<P>
Chiu added, however, that goodwill rhetoric needs the support of
action to make it a reality.
</P>
<P>
Chiu was referring to remarks made by Sun Yafu, vice president of
the Beijing-based Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait
(ARATS) Thursday after Sun returned to the mainland from Taiwan,
where he and ARATS Secretary-General Li Yafei paid their last
respects Wednesday to the late Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF)
Chairman Koo Chen-fu, a respected business tycoon who served as
Taiwan's top negotiator with the mainland.
</P>
<P>
The SEF and ARATS are quasi-official intermediary bodies
authorized to handle exchanges across the Taiwan Strait in the
absence of official contacts between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
Sun told the Chinese media that ARATS and the SEF are expected to
"continue to interact, engage and negotiate in a favorable
atmosphere" in the future.
</P>
<P>
Chiu said that the MAC keenly hopes that both organizations will
transform rhetoric into action while trying their utmost to remove or
at least "properly handle" barriers in the way of bilateral
engagement.
</P>
<P>
The visit to Taiwan by Sun, who is also concurrently deputy
director of the Taiwan Affairs Office of the mainland's State
Council, marked the first high-level Beijing official visit to Taiwan
since the two sides suspended regular dialogue in mid-1999 over
former ROC President Lee Teng-hui's "state-to-state" remarks.

HEALTH INSURANCE BUREAU PLANS TO RAISE PREMIUM CEILINGS
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Feb.  4 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Bureau of National Health Insurance
(BNHI) is planning to raise the ceiling of premiums of the national
health insurance program in an effort to raise funds to save the
program from bankruptcy, a BNHI official said Friday.
</P>
<P>
BNHI Vice President Lai Chin-hsiang said the bureau is planning
to raise the ceiling of premiums from the current level of NT$87,600
to NT$130,000 in an attempt to increase revenues to support the
financially troubled national health insurance program.
</P>
<P>
If the ceiling is raised to NT$130,000, an extra NT$1.3 billion
is expected to be generated per year to help with the program, which
is doomed to bankruptcy if no extra funds are infused after March
this year, Lai said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the BNHI hopes that the tobacco tax will also be
raised to accelerate this effort, Lai said, adding that another NT$4
billion to NT$6 billion is expected to be generated should the
tobacco tax be increased from the present NT$5 to NT$8 or NT$10 per
pack of cigarettes.
</P>
<P>
Implementation of both the premium ceiling raise and the raise in
tobacco tax needs the consent by the Legislative Yuan by amending the
current national health insurance law, as well as the tobacco and
liquor law, Lai added.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, Premier Frank Hsieh called for support from
the Legislative Yuan for several proposed amendments to related
statutes to help save the national health insurance program from
bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
Hsieh met with Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng to seek
legislative support for several proposed amendments to existing laws
to allow for transferring tobacco and liquor tax revenues to support
the national health insurance program.
</P>
<P>
Hsieh said that the health insurance program's reserve funds will
run out by the end of March and that the program is expected to be on
the brink of collapse should no extra funds be infused after that
time.
</P>
<P>
The premier noted that implementing a proposed second-generation
health insurance program -- currently in the pipelines at the
Department of Health (DOH) -- under which premiums would be
calculated based on a person's total income as opposed to just their
salary, also requires the Legislative Yuan's support to be passed
into law.
</P>
<P>
Under this proposed new health insurance program, premium
ceilings would be adjusted upward, requiring people with higher
incomes to share a greater burden in supporting the program.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the proposed second-generation program, Wang said
that it makes sense to him and that the issue can be brought to the
Legislative Yuan floor for discussion.
</P>
<P>
The Department of Health said recently that it will adopt
austerity measures to save the national health insurance program from
bankruptcy without raising premiums for a year or so.
</P>
<P>
The then DOH Minister Chen Chien-jen said the department will
respect the consensus reached by participants in a public forum in
mid-January rejecting a proposed hike in health insurance premiums.
He said the DOH will refrain from raising premiums this year.
</P>
<P>
Pointing out that there is room to reduce the program's costs by
5 percent to 10 percent through cost-saving measures and curbing
waste, Chen said that if this can be achieved, the program should be
able to continue operating for another year or so without an increase
in premiums.

GOVERNMENT GIVES PRIORITY TO CRACKDOWN ON PHONE FRAUD: PREMIER

<TEXT>
<P>
Premier Frank Hsieh said Friday that a
crackdown on telephone fraud and coercion is one of the government's
priorities.
</P>
<P>
Hsieh made the remarks at a special Cabinet meeting aimed at
curbing crime and improving public order during the upcoming Chinese
New Year holiday.
</P>
<P>
Noting that many people have complained about rampant telephone
fraud and coercion, Hsieh said law enforcement authorities should
cooperate closely in investigating the sources of fraudulent
telephones and figurehead bank accounts in order to prevent criminal
rings from using phones to swindle money from ordinary citizens or
coerce them into joining criminal operations.
</P>
<P>
Law enforcement authorities should also cut red tape and simplify
administrative measures to assist victims in retrieving their lost
funds.
</P>
<P>
Hsieh further said President Chen Shui-bian has directed the
Cabinet to give priority to clamping down on criminal activities.
Relevant government agencies should pay more heed to average
citizens' feelings about public order and work even harder to raise
the crime-fighting-related approval rating, Hsieh said.
</P>
<P>
While the number of burglary, fraud, firearm and drug trafficking
cases increased last year, Hsieh said the crime solution rate also
rose proportionally. "We recognize police efforts in this regard," he
added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Hsieh urged police to respond quickly to crime
reports and recruit volunteers to strengthen services for victims of
crime.
</P>
<P>
Law enforcement authorities should also step up publicity to let
the public understand the progress in crime-fighting campaign and
allay their misgivings, he said.

YUNLIN PROSECUTOR'S OFFICE TO STEP UP INVESTIGATION INTO BAD PORK

<TEXT>
<P>
 Taipei, Feb. 4 (CAN) The Justice Department has instructed the
Yunlin County Prosecutor's Office to step up an investigation into
pork from sick and dead pigs finding its way into major meat markets.
</P>
<P>
Vice Justice Minister Yen Ta-he made the remarks in a press
conference Friday as the nation continued to focus on the problem
pork following the arrest of a meat supplier in Yunlin County and a
major distributor in Taichung, who reportedly made a lot of money by
selling pork from sick or dead pigs Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Reports said that nearly 10,000 kg of the bad pork has found its
way into major hotels, restaurants and shopping malls in Taipei city
and county, Taichung city and county and Yunlin and Kaohsiung
counties.
</P>
<P>
Yen said that the Yunlin Prosecutor's Office found that some
illicit rings are collecting the pork and that investigators have
found that five slaughter houses in Yunlin are involved in the case
and are tracking down on their distribution networks.
</P>
<P>
Yunlin County raises more than 1.3 million hogs annually. Judging
from the survival rate of about 75 percent of the raised hogs, the
number of sick or dead pigs could be large, reports said.

The Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) released
an infomercial Friday urging mainland China to work with Taiwan to
overcome their mutual obstacles to make way for "new cross-Taiwan
Strait relations."
</P>
<P>
The 30-second film, titled "New Year, New Cross-Strait Relations"
will be aired on major TV networks in Taiwan from Friday, according
to the MAC.
</P>
<P>
With no narration, the film is presented with a subtitle reading
"unconditional, practical, put disputes aside, respect each other"
and images of two drivers together braving a storm to remove a fallen
tree that blocks their way.
</P>
<P>
MAC Vice Chairman Chiu Tai-san said both Taiwan and the mainland
are well aware of the fact that it will be impossible to achieve a
mutually acceptable resolution to their political disputes in the
near future.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, like the two drivers who remove the barricade, both
sides should think of a way to bypass their disputes, Chiu said.
</P>
<P>
Chiu urged the Beijing authorities to cherish the present
"amiable" cross-strait atmosphere, seek to reopen cross-strait
negotiations and dialogue and abandon their plan to enact an
"anti-secession law," so as not to miss the opportunity of peace.
</P>
<P>
The infomercial was released after special cross-strait Lunar New
Year charter flights were launched last week.
</P>

Sun Yafu, vice president of mainland-based Association for
Relations Across the Taiwan Strait (ARATS) , and ARATS
Secretary-General Li Yafei also visited Taiwan earlier this week to
attend a memorial service for late Straits Exchange Foundation
Chairman Koo Chen-fu.

Both developments are considered by Taiwan as signs of
cross-strait relations tempering after tensions over the past few

The production value of Taiwan's financial
sector increased to 11.5 percent of the country's gross domestic
product in 2003, the Cabinet-level Council for Economic Planning and
Development (CEPD) reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The ratio is a similar level to those of Hong Kong and Singapore,
two of the world's key financial centers, CEPD officials said, adding
that in an effort to balance the country's finances, the government
imposed a reform package in April 2003.
</P>
<P>
The new Cabinet led by Premier Frank Hsieh pointed out clearly in
a Feb. 1 meeting that financial reform will continue to be a key

agencies will keep on working toward that end.
</P>
<P>
Stressing that financial reform is a long-term goal of the
government to bolster Taiwan's economic development, CEPD officials
said that the reform has showed initial improvement. For instance,
mergers in the banking industry have been conducted smoothly and the
banks' overdue loan ratios have been noticeably reduced, they noted.

They said the council has worked out five strategies containing
51 measures and 160 reviewed rules and regulations that are being
followed by the relevant government agencies after being approved

TAIPEI MAYOR TO APPEAL COURT RULING ON LIBEL SUIT AGAINST DPP
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Feb. 4 (CNA)
(By Y.F. Low)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou announced Friday
his decision to appeal a court judgment that rejected a libel claim
he had made against the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP).
</P>
<P>
However, Ma said he will drop the case if the DPP apologizes to
him.
</P>
<P>
The dispute was triggered by a TV commercial produced by the DPP
in October 2003 to promote a referendum for a new Constitution, which
Ma claims libelously painted him as a pro-mainland China politician.
</P>
<P>
In the film, footage of Ma attending a National Day flag-raising
ceremony was edited together with images showing people raising the
People's Republic of China national flag, with a voice in the
background shouting "long live Hu Jintao."
</P>
<P>
Ma filed his lawsuit with the Taipei District Court, asking for
NT$1 million (US$31,646) in compensation and demanding that the DPP
print an apology in newspapers.
</P>
<P>
The court rejected Ma's claim last month on the grounds that the
content of the commercial was protected by freedom of speech.
</P>
<P>
Calling the result regrettable and disappointing, Ma said the
judgment will set a dangerous precedent because it encourages
mud-slinging.
</P>
<P>
Ma said he is not pro-mainland, which he said can be seen from
his constant criticism of the communist regime.
</P>
<P>
Also, Ma pointed out that he has never missed the annual event
commemorating the pro-democracy activists massacred by mainland
troops in Tiananmen Square June 4, 1989, and has spoken up for the
Falun Gong members who have been persecuted by the Beijing
authorities.
</P>
<P>
In response to Ma's decision to lodge an appeal, DPP spokesman
Cheng Wen-tsan urged Ma to respect and trust the judiciary.
</P>
<P>
Cheng said the footage used in the commercial was taken from TV
news reports and he claimed that the DPP had "no intention" of
painting Ma as a pro-mainland politician but was only trying to
highlight Beijing's suppression of Taiwan.

<TEXT>
<P>
Foreign capital continued flooding into the
domestic stock market, with its combined value hitting US$81.6
billion as of the end of January, the Financial Supervisory
Commission (FSC) reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The figure represents a rise over the US$80.1 billion recorded in
late December, with about NT$1.5 billion funneled into the domestic
stock market in January, FSC officials said.
</P>
<P>
Share prices on the Taiwan Stock Exchange rose on every trading
day since the beginning of this month, with overbought value reaching
more than NT$10 billion per day, creating a positive sentiment for
the reopening of the market after the Feb. 9 Chinese New Year
holiday, market watchers said. The market closed on Feb. 4 and will
reopen Feb. 14.
</P>
<P>
The independent FSC was set up in 2004 to oversee the domestic
banking insurance, securities and futures industries, which were

HSIEH SAYS HE'S NOT ABLE TO MEET KMT'S CONDITIONS FOR VICE PREMIER
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Changhua, Taiwan, Feb. 4 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Premier Frank Hsieh said Friday he
is not in a position to negotiate with the opposition Kuomintang
(KMT) over its conditions for one of its vice chairmen to join his
Cabinet as vice premier.
</P>
<P>
"As a premier, I cannot fulfill the KMT's prerequisite for
party-to-party negotiations for KMT Vice Chairman P.K. Chiang to join
the Cabinet as vice premier, " Hsieh said after attending the opening
ceremony for the 2005 Taiwan Flower Exposition in the central county
of Changhua.
</P>
<P>
With a view to promoting inter-party reconciliation, Hsieh has so
far left vacant the vice premier post and has repeatedly expressed
his desire to invite Chiang to serve as his deputy.
</P>
<P>
However, KMT Chairman Lien Chan said Thursday that the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) must negotiate with the KMT to
clarify and seek consensus on certain critical policy issues before
the KMT accepts the DPP's offer to appoint Chiang.
</P>
<P>
The issues to be discussed should include the country's status,
the opening of direct transportation links with mainland China, plans
to change the official name of the country, investigations into last
year's presidential election-eve shooting of President Chen
Shui-bian, and attempts to liquidate the KMT's ill-gotten assets, in
addition to the controversial Fourth Nuclear Power Plant project,
Lien said, adding that the two parties also need to negotiate on how
much authorization Chiang will enjoy as vice premier to ensure he
will not be just a dummy in the DPP government.
</P>
<P>
In his first response to Lien's proposal, Hsieh said that as he
is not DPP chairman, he is not in a position to conduct
party-to-party negotiations on those issues.
</P>
<P>
Hsieh said he keenly hopes that Lien can reconsider his offer to
Chiang during the upcoming Chinese New Year holiday and change the
KMT's stance. "I'm hopeful that Lien will change his mind during the
lunar new year holiday that will run from Feb. 9 through Feb. 13.
After the holiday, I would be willing to meet with Lien to express my
thanks to his consent to Chiang's participation in the DPP
administration," Hsieh said.
</P>
<P>
If Lien still insists on the KMT's stance and is unwilling to
meet with him, Hsieh said he will look for another suitable person to
serve as vice premier.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the DPP's traditional ally, the Taiwan Solidarity
Union (TSU), panned the KMT for proposing what it called "absurd and
outrageous" conditions for Chiang's participation in Hsieh's Cabinet.
</P>
<P>
TSU Chairman Su Chin-chiang said the KMT's conditions run counter
to the present mainstream public opinion for inter-party
reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
"It is regrettable that Lien put the KMT's partisan interests,
such as ill-gotten party assets, above national interests and public
aspirations for political stability, " Su said, adding that the DPP
should not compromise its core values simply for promoting
inter-party reconciliation.

TAIWAN SHOULD DEVELOP THREE METROPOLISES: CEPD
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Feb.  4 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The nation's top economic planning agency
has suggested that the government pool its resources to develop one
metropolis each in northern, central and southern Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
The Council for Economic Planning and Development (CEPD) noted
that although Taiwan has continued to make progress in a global
competitiveness report by the World Economic Forum in 2004, which is
positive about Taiwan's efforts to improve its economic fundamentals
and investment environment, it is not given a high score in terms of
business competitiveness.
</P>
<P>
CEPD officials said that with strong international competition
triggered by globalization, Taiwan should make focusing its resources
into developing the metropolises into its top priority so that the
overall competitiveness and the attraction of the three cities would
be higher than those of foreign countries.
</P>
<P>
The three metropolises would then play a magnet effect and become
the three development centers of Taiwan, the officials claimed.
</P>
<P>
They also said that the metropolises would each have the goal of
becoming a world-class city, taking into consideration the
development of the cities and counties they encompass so as to turn
into regional economic bodies with local features.
</P>
<P>
Each would have a world-class harbor and airport so that they can
easily be integrated into the global traffic network, and each would
develop competitive industries so as to lead the development of the
national economy and integrate it into the global economic system.

ONE-FIFTH OF SUICIDE VICTIMS WERE JOBLESS BEFORE DEATH: FOREIGN STUDY
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Feb.  4 (CNA)
(By Y.F. Low)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
While local National Health Insurance and
Labor Insurance data show that the risk of jobless people dying in a
year is double that of working people, and a foreign study also
identifies unemployment as a possible factor leading to suicide, a
local researcher said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Cheng Tai-an, a research fellow at the Academia Sinica's
Institute of Biomedical Sciences, said recent a study conducted by
foreign researchers indicates that one-fifth of suicide victims were
unemployed before their death.
</P>
<P>
No similar study is available locally, Cheng said.
</P>
<P>
According to Cheng, suicide is a complicated phenomenon involving
both social and psychological dimensions, and unemployment does not
always lead to suicide.
</P>
<P>
Many people are depressive or alcoholic before attempting
suicide, which could be caused by a sense of loss resulted from the
loss of jobs, close relatives and health, Cheng said.
</P>
<P>
Physically, these people may complain of insomnia and tiredness,
he said.
</P>
<P>
Special occasions such as birthdays, marriage anniversaries and
death anniversaries of relatives are when these people are most
likely to attempt suicide, he added.

TWO AGRICULTURAL EXPERTS RECEIVE PRESIDENTIAL AWARDS
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President Chen Shui-bian said Friday the
establishment of the Presidential Agriculture Awards is aimed at
honoring those who have dedicated themselves to farming and
agricultural development.
</P>
<P>
Chen made the remarks at the presentation of the awards to two
outstanding agricultural experts for their lifelong dedication to
agriculture.
</P>
<P>
It marked the first time that the government has set up the
top-level presidential awards to honor the nation's agricultural
professionals. The presentation ceremony took place at the Council of
Agriculture headquarters in Taipei.
</P>
<P>
Chen personally presented the Agricultural Peace Award to Hsieh
Shun-ching, 77, for his remarkable contributions to international
cooperation in the agricultural sector, and the Agricultural Service
Award to Hsu chin-hsi, 66, for his long-term contributions to water
productivity enhancement.
</P>
<P>
The first Presidential Agriculture Awards honor dedicated
professionals in five categories -- food safety, agricultural
innovation, agricultural service, ecological conservation along with
an agricultural peace award. The awards in the three remaining
categories were not given because the jury didn't find qualified
candidates.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the five award categories form core values of
Taiwan's agricultural development, Chen said he was moved by the two
winners' professionalism, dedication and perseverance. "Their
achievements glorify the presidential awards," he added.
</P>
<P>
The president further said he hopes the awards can help encourage
agricultural professionals to redouble their efforts to further
upgrade the competitiveness of the nation's agricultural sector and
create yet another economic miracle in Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
For his part, Hsieh, an expert on rice cultivation, said the
award is a great honor for him.
</P>
<P>
"I was born in a rural town, majored in agriculture during my
university and graduate school years and then worked at agricultural
agencies. My whole life has been closely related with agriculture. I
feel honored to receive the award," an emotional Hsieh said.
</P>
<P>
Hsieh, now a professor of tropical agriculture at National
Pingtung University of Science and Technology in southern Taiwan, was
one of the leading people promoting agricultural technology transfer
to developing countries.
</P>
<P>
Hsu, head of the Tainan-based Chianan Irrigation Association, has
contributed much to the improvement of irrigation systems and
flexible allocation of water resources to different sectors for
households, industry and agriculture to counter droughts.

DPP LAWMAKERS CALL FOR RECTIFICATION OF DICTUM ON STUDENTS' NOTEBOOKS
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Feb.  4 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two ruling Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) lawmakers urged the Ministry of Education Friday to rectify the
decades-old adage printed on elementary and junior high school
students' standard notebooks to avoid confusing their sense of
national identity.
</P>
<P>
Legislators Trong Chai and Chuang Ho-tzu said at a news
conference at the Legislative Yuan that a large number of local
elementary and junior high schools still distribute notebooks printed
with the maxim urging students to be "a good student and a decent
Chinese citizen."
</P>
<P>
The two DPP lawmakers said they are afraid that the slogan could
confuse local young students regarding their concept of national
identity.
</P>
<P>
"The term of 'ethnicity' should be clearly distinguished from
that of 'country.' For instance, Singaporeans would probably say they
are ethnic Chinese, but they would never say they are Chinese
citizens," Chai said.
</P>
<P>
He urged the Ministry of Education to change the saying to read
"be a good student and a decent Taiwanese" to signify Taiwan's
national identity distinct from that of China.

CAL REFUSES TO ACCEPT HONG KONG'S REPORT ON 1999 CRASH
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Feb.  4 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
China Airlines (CAL) , Taiwan's largest
carrier, refused Friday to accept the results of an investigation by
the Hong Kong civil aviation authorities into a CAL jet crash in
August 1999 at Chek Lap Kok Airport, arguing that wind shear, rather
than human error, was behind the accident.
</P>
<P>
CAL public relations director Liang Han-chung said that the
aviation company cannot accept the investigation results that
ascribed the fatal accident to pilot error on the grounds that Boeing
Corporation, the maker of the MD-11 jet plane, found new evidence
during the investigation that a wind gust suddenly changed direction
1.5 seconds before the plane touched down.
</P>
<P>
Evidence collected from the plane's flight data recorder (FDR)
showed that swift wind changes, triggered by a tropical storm
sweeping through Hong Kong at that time, made the pilot unable to
control the aircraft's sudden descend, Liang said, pointing out that
wind, not the pilot, caused the accident.
</P>
<P>
According to Liang, CAL forwarded the evidence to the Hong Kong
Civil Aviation Department and asked it to attach the information to
its investigation report.
</P>
<P>
CAL CI642 from Bangkok with 300 passengers and crew on board
plunged into the runway of Chek Lap Kok Airport Aug. 22, 1999 while
trying to land during a typhoon. It flipped and burst into flames,
killing three and seriously injuring 50.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan's Aviation Security Commission, which helped in the
investigation, pointed out that the FDR showed that the pilot tried
hard to keep the airplane aloft when the gust hit. But the wind was
too strong for the pilot to respond, it concluded.
</P>
<P>
The plane crashed at the airport of Hong Kong, and the Hong Kong
government was in charge of carrying out the plane in line with
international norms.
</P>
<P>
According to the Hong Kong investigation report, the cause of the
accident was the commander's inability to arrest the high rate of
descent, a foreign wire service reported. The pilot was descending
too fast as he tried to touch down during a tropical storm, the
services reported, citing the Hong Kong's Civil Aviation Department.

A group of activists formed a "Beggars
Alliance" Friday to focus public attention on the increasingly
serious issue of poverty.
</P>
<P>
Fang Cheng-ping, convener of the Beggars Alliance, said the
alliance has over 20 founding members from various walks of life,
including SOHO (small office/home office) entrepreneurs, engineers
and homemakers.
</P>
<P>
"We are not beggars. We have become friends through the Internet.
Our main purpose of forming the Beggars Alliance is to generate
public interest in poverty, which has become increasingly serious in
our society. By forming the alliance, we hope to promote social
welfare benefits for the unemployed and the impoverished, " Fang said
at a news conference.
</P>
<P>
Fang and other founding members presented a petition to the
Executive Yuan after announcing the formation of the Beggars
Alliance, urging the government to designate Feb. 4 as Beggars Day to
remind local people not to forget the issue of poverty.
</P>
<P>
"'Feb. 4' sounds like 'starving to death' in Mandarin Chinese. We
hope to designate the day as Beggars Day to symbolize concern and
care for poor people," Fang said.
</P>
<P>
Noting that poverty is not just a personal problem, Fang said the
government should assume the responsibility of helping find ways
to address the issue.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Executive Yuan sent a report to the
Legislative Yuan Friday outlining four main administration guidelines
for this year.
</P>
<P>
They are: pursuing a Taiwan-centric identity, improving the
social security network, establishing a normal political landscape
and promoting economic strategic alliances.
</P>
<P>
The report said that the guidelines are based on the four main
administration targets set by President Chen Shui-bian: unite the
people of Taiwan, stabilize cross-Taiwan Strait relations, maintain
social order and bring prosperity to the country's economy.
</P>
<P>
The real challenge facing Taiwan is no longer in sharpening the
country's economic competitiveness, but in the establishment of a
Taiwan-centric culture and national identity, it noted.
</P>
<P>
The country's political and economic achievements should be
channeled into the re-establishment of Taiwan's spiritual cultivation
and cultural values, it stressed.
</P>
<P>
On political developments, the report said the Executive Yuan is
seeking to establish a timely, suitable and feasible constitutional
framework for Taiwan and improve the government's efficiency.
</P>
<P>
The Executive Yuan will do what is necessary to see that
legislative reforms are carried out and address problems in the
Constitution. The report goes on to list various goals; among them,
promoting the legislation of sunshine laws, enacting an international
human rights code as domestic law, reorganizing the government,
establishing a creative and dynamic administrative culture, and
creating an innovative mechanism for public services.
</P>
<P>
On social security and social order, the government will increase
the care it gives the elderly, children in need, and the sick and
handicapped.
</P>
<P>
Regarding the economy, the government will seek to establish
international strategic alliances, explore new trade opportunities
through a global deployment campaign, create momentum in economic
growth by promoting investment in Taiwan, make use of the advantages
that Taiwan has to create a profit-making foundation for the
manufacturing industry, create additional job opportunities for
improving social security and form a plan for sustainable use of the
country's land.

<P>
The Taiwan External Trade Development Council
(TAITRA) opened Taiwan food exhibitions at Indonesia's major
supermarkets Saturday, focusing on ethnic Chinese customers with high
incomes.
</P>
<P>
TAITRA officials noted that Indonesia has been economically and
politically stable during the last three years, with its currency and
stock market remaining strong with interest and inflation rates
dropping gradually.
</P>
<P>
With a population of 211.7 million, the fourth-largest country in
the world, Indonesia registered an economic growth of 5.4 percent in
2004 due largely to its strong domestic consumption.
</P>
<P>
The "Taiwan Food Festival" held in seven major supermarkets in
Indonesia will last 30 days, hoping to attract Chinese consumers, who
play a leading role in Indonesia's economy.
</P>
<P>
This was the first time TAITRA has held food festivals in
Indonesia. Taiwan's major food companies are also participating.
</P>
<P>
An Indonesian importer of Taiwanese products has reached
agreements with local supermarkets to put the Taiwanese food on the
shelves for long-term sales.

PREMIER REMAINS HOPEFUL ABOUT VICE PREMIER OFFER TO KMT
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Feb.  5 (CNA)
(By Y.F. Low)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Premier Frank Hsieh said Saturday he is
still hopeful that opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Vice Chairman P.K.
Chiang will become his deputy, and he urged the KMT to consider his
offer seriously.
</P>
<P>
Hsieh said he will not consider other candidates before Executive
Yuan Secretary-General Lee Yi-Yang and KMT Secretary-General Lin
Fong-cheng meet on Feb. 17 over the matter.
</P>
<P>
Hsieh has openly expressed his desire to appoint Chiang as vice
premier after assuming the premiership early this week.
</P>
<P>
However, KMT Chairman Lien Chan insisted that such an appointment
could only be considered through party-to-party negotiations. Lien
said the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) and the KMT must
first sort out their differences through negotiations on issues such
as the country's status, opening direct transportation links with
mainland China, plans to change the official name of the country,
investigations into last year's presidential election-eve shooting of
President Chen Shui-bian, attempts to liquidate the KMT's ill-gotten
assets, and the Fourth Nuclear Power Plant project.
</P>
<P>
Lien also asked to discuss how much authorization Chiang would
enjoy as vice premier.
</P>
<P>
On this issue, Hsieh said the power of vice premier is dictated
by law, which is to assist the premier in administering government
affairs.
</P>
<P>
The power of the vice premier will not surpass that of the
premier and does not extend to national defense and foreign affairs,
Hsieh pointed out.
</P>
<P>
While cross-Taiwan Strait relations are under the command of the
president and the National Security Council, the premier does not
have a final say in such policies, not to mention the vice premier,
according to Hsieh.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, Hsieh said, some of the issues proposed by the KMT for
negotiations are beyond the Executive Yuan's jurisdiction.
</P>
<P>
As to the KMT's request for party-to-party negotiations, Hsieh
said this would have to wait until DPP Chairman-elect Su Tseng-chang
is sworn in on Feb. 15 before any negotiations could start.
</P>
<P>
Hsieh said he invited Chiang to enter the Cabinet because he
believes Chiang's talent would be of great help to the country and
that he hopes there will be good news from the KMT soon.

<TEXT>
<P>
Fishery authorities said on Saturday that
there should be a sufficient supply of fish at markets around the
island to meet increased demand during the Chinese Lunar New Year
holiday since aquaculturalists have been encouraged to up production
and imports.
</P>
<P>
About 7,000 tons of fish are expected to reach the 24 major
markets around the island during the five-day period prior to the
Lunar New Year, which will falls on Feb. 9, according to the
Fisheries Administration under the Cabinet-level Council of
Agriculture.
</P>
<P>
The amount is a 30-percent increase over normal days, officials
of the agency said, noting that 6,566 tons of fish were put on the
market during last year's holiday.
</P>
<P>
Prices are expected to rise slightly to average NT$85 per
kilogram, a 10 percent to 12 percent increase over non-seasonal days,
according to the administration.
</P>
<P>
Officials suggested consumers purchase high-quality Taiwan-farmed
tilapia at reasonable prices to add to their New Year's dinner.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, there have been abundant fruits and vegetables at
markets recently thanks to good harvests, according to the Hsiluo
fruit and vegetable market in Yunlin County, central Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
As a result of the good supply, prices of fruits and vegetables
were lower over the past days, market dealers said, but indicated
they expect that prices will move higher in the next few days because
of increased demand.

KEELUNG, TAIPEI COUNTY MOST PRONE TO TSUNAMI DISASTER
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Feb. 5 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Keelung City and Taipei County are Taiwan's
most tsunami-prone areas, according to a rating system designed by
the Central Weather Bureau's Seismology Center.
</P>
<P>
The center decided to hammer out a tsunami warning system after
tsunamis triggered by a strong earthquake beneath the Indian Ocean
devastated a dozen South and Southeast Asian countries late last
December.
</P>
<P>
The center classified the nation's 25 cities and counties into
three levels in terms of the risk of being hit by tsunamis. According
to the newly completed rating system, Keelung and Taipei County in
northern Taiwan rank at the first level as the riskiest areas.
</P>
<P>
In contrast, Nantou County, Chiayi City, Taichung City and Taipei
City are rated as "free of tsunami threat" because they are far away
from the sea.
</P>
<P>
Three northwestern counties of Taoyuan, Hsinchu and Miaoli as
well as two frontline islands of Kinmen and Matsu rank at the third
level with limited tsunami risk.
</P>
<P>
The remaining cities and counties, including northeastern Ilan
County and two eastern counties of Hualien and Taitung, rank at the
second level, with a bit higher risk than the third-level areas.
</P>
<P>
Kuo Kai-wen, director of the Seismology Center, said Taiwan has
been rattled by 36 magnitude-7 or stronger earthquakes since 1900.
While more than 20 of them originated below the shallow seabed, Kuo
said, none of them ever caused disastrous tsunamis.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Kuo said that judging from the Dec. 26 Indian Ocean
tsunamis, nobody can make assurances that Taiwan will never be hit by
tsunamis. Therefore, he said, Taiwan should still work out response
measures to cope with any possible tsunami disasters.
</P>
<P>
In the future, Kuo said, the Seismology Center will issue a
tsunami warning whenever a magnitude-7 earthquake undersea at a depth
of less than 35 kilometers is reported.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, government agencies are scheduled to unveil
regulations before the end of February to govern ship and train
control and evacuation of coastal areas after a tsunami warning is
issued.

COA STEPS UP CRACKDOWN ON SALES OF TAINTED PORK
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei, Feb. 5 (CNA)
(By Y.F. Low)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Council of Agriculture (COA) has decided
to quadruple its reward to NT$2 million (US$63,291) for information
concerning the sale of tainted meat after a large quantity of
unhealthful pork from pigs dying of sickness was recently uncovered,
an official said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
At a news conference held by the Consumers' Foundation, Lin
Shih-yu, deputy director-general of the COA's Bureau of Animal and
Plant Health Inspection and Quarantine, said 32 cases of unwholesome
pork sales have been uncovered around Taiwan since 2001.
</P>
<P>
They include the latest three cases in Yunlin County on Feb. 1,
in which more than 4,500 kilograms of pork from pigs dying of
sickness were found, Lin pointed out.
</P>
<P>
In these cases, the carcasses of the dead pigs were illicitly
processed for human consumption. They should have been buried,
cremated or processed into animal feed, Lin said.
</P>
<P>
Members of the ROC Swine Association said the problem exists
because the penalty for the offence is too light, and they urged
prosecution authorities to charge violators with creating a public
hazard and fraud.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Consumers' Foundation Secretary-General Huang Yi-teng
proposed that the government set up a system to monitor the origin,
breeding, inspection, slaughtering, packaging, delivery and marketing
of meat to ensure its quality.
</P>
<P>
To increase the incentive for pig farmers to dispose of their
dead pigs lawfully, the government should establish an insurance
system or a system under which the dead animals will be paid for
according to market prices, according to the foundation.

U.S. House Representative Sherrod
Brown has warned the European Union against lifting its arms embargo
against mainland China, saying the move will upset the military
balance across the Taiwan Strait.
</P>
<P>
In his testimony before the U.S.-China Economic and Security
Review Commission on Thursday, Brown said the fact that the EU has
maintained the embargo for 15 years indicates Europe's ongoing
dissatisfaction with the pace of political reform and the human
rights record of China, and he urged the EU to reconsider the matter.
</P>
<P>
"Lifting the embargo will alter the current fragile military
balance across the Taiwan Strait and will rapidly tip the balance in
China's favor," Brown warned.
</P>
<P>
"Lifting the EU-China arms ban sends only one signal: Democratic
Taiwan will be staring down the barrel of guns manufactured by EU
democracies," he added.
</P>
<P>
The EU is considering lifting the arms embargo and replacing it
with a code of conduct on arms exports.

NEW PREMIER URGED TO FORM CONSULTATION CHANNEL WITH LEGISLATURE
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei, Feb. 5 (CNA)
(By Elisa Kao)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Several politicians from the opposition camp
urged Premier Frank Hsieh Saturday to establish a channel between the
Cabinet and the Legislative Yuan to facilitate political harmony.
</P>
<P>
Hsieh, who assumed his post on Feb. 1, has promised to make his
team a "Cabinet of consultations, " stressing the importance of the
Cabinet's being humble in dealing with opposition parties since the
ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) does not have a majority in
the legislature.
</P>
<P>
Opposition Kuomintang (KMT) spokesman Chang Jung-kung noted that
the DPP had said many sweet words in the past, giving the public high
expectations, but the final results always frustrated the people. He
expressed hope that this time a real "Cabinet of consultations" can
be realized.
</P>
<P>
Dubbing the former Yu Shyi-kun administration as a "fighting
Cabinet, " another KMT official, Tseng Yung-chuan, criticized Yu as
causing the confrontation between the Executive Yuan and the
Legislative Yuan by prohibiting high-level officials from attending
meetings of the opposition parties, which hold a majority in the
legislature.
</P>
<P>
Unlike other opposition politicians that have shown little faith
in the ruling party, Legislative Yuan President Wang Jin-pyng gave
high appraisal to the idea of forming a "Cabinet of consultations, "
saying that he has experienced the sincerity of the new premier.
</P>
<P>
Wang said he is confident that there will be a benign interaction
between the executive and legislative branches under the leadership
of Hsieh.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou, who is also one of the
KMT's vice chairmen, said he supports Hsieh's idea to establish a
Cabinet focusing on consultations, but suggested Hsieh present
concrete measures regarding how this was going to happen.
</P>
<P>
Although there were rumors before the formation of the new
Cabinet that members of the opposition People First Party (PFP) could
join the DPP administration, PFP Legislator Sun Tai-Chian stressed
that the pro-unification "pan-blue alliance" of the KMT and the PFP
will not cooperate with the pro-Taiwan independence DPP unless the
ruling party makes clear its stance on the nation's identity.

Newly elected PFP Legislator Chang Hsien-yao said that whether
the Cabinet is one receptive to dialogue or one based on a coalition,
political cooperation must be conducted through party-to-party
negotiations, and not via secret negotiations by individuals.

<P>
Although Hsieh has invited certain KMT members to join his

869 UNAUTHORIZED MAINLAND-BOUND INVESTMENT CASES UNCOVERED IN 2004

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A total of 869 unauthorized mainland
China-bound investment cases were uncovered last year, with investors
in 564 of those being fined, the Investment Commission under the
Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
To encourage local corporate owners to voluntarily report their
mainland investment projects, the MOEA adjusted fines on investment
rules violators last March. The fines were adjusted to between
NT$50,000 to NT$25 million from the previous NT$1 million to NT$5
million.
</P>
<P>
Of the 869 unauthorized investment cases uncovered last year, 729
were reported by investors themselves, 22 were discovered with
information provided by informers and 118 were uncovered by the
Investment Commission itself.
</P>
<P>
The commission slapped fines on investors in 564 of those cases,
of which 539 had paid fines totaling about NT$30 million as of the
end of last December.
</P>
<P>
Encouraging local entrepreneurs to faithfully report their
unauthorized mainland investment projects is part of the MOEA's
efforts to substantiate the government's policy of "active opening
and effective management" regarding mainland-bound investments, a
senior official said.

55 PASSENGERS BARRED FROM BOARDING AIR CHINA CHARTER FLIGHT
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Feb. 5 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Fifty-five local holidaymakers were barred
from boarding an Air China charter plane bound for Beijing Saturday
because they were not legally registered "taishang" -- Taiwan
businessmen operating in mainland China.
</P>
<P>
They were the first groups of passengers denied embarkation on a
cross-strait charter flight since the special Chinese Lunar New Year
holiday flight services were launched Jan. 29.
</P>
<P>
The passengers were recruited by five local travel agencies. They
claimed that they joined the tour groups after travel agencies
assured them that they were qualified to use the special charter
flight services. However, immigration officers intercepted them due
to "identity" problems. None of the passengers were legally
registered investors or employees of Taiwan-invested firms in
mainland China.
</P>
<P>
After negotiations between China Airlines -- Air China's ground
service agent in Taiwan -- and travel agencies, 53 of the passengers
agreed to take a China Airlines flight to Hong Kong at 6: 25 p.m. for
a free overnight transit stop. They are scheduled to take an Air
China flight to Beijing from Hong Kong Sunday for a sightseeing tour.
Two other passengers canceled their mainland travel plan after being
denied embarkation on the special direct non-stop cross-strait
charter flight.
</P>
<P>
As a result, only 23 passengers managed to take the Air China's
Saturday charter flight to Beijing from Chiang Kai-shek International
Airport.
</P>
<P>
Relevant government agencies said they will look into why the 55
passengers with no proper documents proving their identity as
"taishang" managed to obtain flight tickets in the first place.
</P>
<P>
According to a landmark cross-strait deal reached in Macau Jan.
15, six carriers from each side will operate a total of 48
round-trip, non-stop charter flights during the Jan. 29-Feb. 20
period between Taipei/Kaohsiung in Taiwan and
Shanghai/Beijing/Guangzhou in mainland China to accommodate
home-bound "taishang" for the upcoming Lunar New Year celebrations.
The Lunar New Year falls on Feb. 9.

BEIJING URGED TO MEND FENCES WITH TAIWAN VIA WHO
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Washington,  Feb. 5 (CNA)
(By Oliver Lin and Deborah Kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An adviser to President Chen Shui-bian
called for Beijing Saturday to mend its fences with Taiwan via the
World Health Organization (WHO) , saying that the WHO is the best
starting point for the two sides to seek reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
Former Health Minister Chan Chi-shean said that Taiwan's
participation in WHO activities benefits the 23 million people of
Taiwan and has nothing to do with the issue of sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
Chan, one of the members of the Taiwan delegation attending the
U.S. National Prayer Breakfast in Washington, D.C., Feb. 3, urged
Beijing not to be an obstacle to Taiwan in the country's efforts to
join the World Health Assembly (WHA), the WHO's top decision-making
body, as an observer.
</P>
<P>
Currently superintendent of the Chi Mei Foundation Medical
Center, Chan reiterated that the WHO's general assembly in May would
be the most opportune time for the two sides to improve their
relations, which have experienced a slight thawing since the
beginning of this year after years of political impasse.
</P>
<P>
Chan said that Taiwan's bid for WHA observer status does not
involve the issue of sovereignty. Besides, he continued, the mainland
Chinese leadership has said that matters which are to the benefit of
the "people" should be handled first. Based on this, Chan said,
mainland China should grasp the opportunity to better its relations
with Taiwan by allowing Taiwan to become a WHA observer this coming
May.
</P>
<P>
Chan made the remarks at a press conference held at the Twin Oaks
Garden where members of the Taiwan delegation to the U.S. National
Prayer Breakfast made known their goals and achievements during their
current visit in the United States.
</P>
<P>
Chan said that he has met with relevant U.S. officials over the
past two days and asked them to render the greatest possible
assistance to Taiwan in its efforts to become a WHA observer.
</P>
<P>
Also attending the press conference were all the other members of
the Taiwan delegation, including senior president advisor Wu Li-pei,
who is heading the delegation; as well as Parris H. Chang, deputy
secretary-general of the National Security Council; Theodore M. H.
Huang, chairman of the National Association of Industry and Commerce;
and Liu Shyh-fang, former secretary-general of the Executive Yuan.

SIEW VOICES TAIWAN CONCERNS ABOUT EXCLUSION FROM REGIONAL INTEGRATION
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Manila,  Feb.  6 (CNA)
(By Emerson Lim and Deborah Kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Former Republic of China Premier Vincent
Siew voiced Taiwan's concerns about being excluded from participation
in the various major regional economic blocs that have been taking
shape.
</P>
<P>
Siew, currently chairman of the Taipei-based Chung-Hua
Institution for Economic Research, took part in an international
symposium on the future of Asian regional integration held in Manila
Feb. 4-5.
</P>
<P>
During the symposium, entitled "An Integrated Road Map to East
Asian Free Trade Agreement, " Siew reiterated that Taiwan has made
hefty and diverse investments in East Asia and Southeast Asia and has
maintained close business and trade links in the region.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan has initiated and contributed in various technology
transfer and industrial cooperation programs in the region, playing a
constructive role as "lubricant" in regional economic and industrial
development, Siew noted.
</P>
<P>
These are some the reasons why Taiwan should not be excluded from
the process of regional economic integration, Siew said, urging
political and economic leaders in the region to let Taiwan
participate in the formation of regional economic blocs, such as the
ASEAN Plus Three, which groups members of the Association of
Southeast Asian Nations with Japan, China and South Korea.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan has not been invited to any of the talks on the formation
of regional free trade blocs. It is foreseeable that by 2010, when
the ASEAN and Plus One (China) free trade bloc is formed, Taiwan will
be seriously marginalized, Siew said.
</P>
<P>
This is an issue which Taiwan government and opinion leaders and
many private sectors are gravely concerned about, Siew noted.
</P>
<P>
During the symposium, Siew promoted the idea that Taiwan --
unable to take part in official regional engagements or meetings
because of certain political realities -- could have its voice heard
via a "second track" formed by private think-tanks from various
countries.
</P>
<P>
Symposium participants, including retired ministers, sitting
high-ranking government officials, and leaders from various academic
and research bodies, responded favorably to Siew's calls.
</P>
<P>
According to Siew, the symposium reached three major conclusions.
Firstly, relevant countries should make the East Asia Free Trade
Agreement (EAFTA) a high-level official plan. Secondly, EAFTA member
countries should maintain partner relationships, and in addition to
trade liberalization, these countries should also cooperate in
service industry, investment and other economic areas. Thirdly, it is
hoped that Taiwan can be invited to join the EAFTA.
</P>
<P>
Jointly organized by the Asian Institute of Management Policy
Center and the Japan Economic Foundation, the symposium was aimed at
providing Asian business leaders with an opportunity to exchange
views and to deepen their mutual understanding of current regional
integration in Asia.
</P>
<P>
Former Philippine President Fidel Ramos, who delivered a keynote
speech at the symposium, led a long list of distinguished panelists.

KMT REINSTATES MEMBERSHIP FOR FORMER HEAVYWEIGHTS

<TEXT>
<P>
Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Lien Chan
reinstated party membership for former Justice Yuan President Lin
Yang-kang and former Premier Hau Pei-tsun by recruiting them as
members of the KMT Advisory Council.
</P>
<P>
Lin and Hau were expelled from the party in 1996 after they
teamed up to run as independents against the KMT ticket of Lee
Teng-hui and his running mate Lien Chan in the presidential and vice
presidential election that year.
</P>
<P>
Lin insisted on entering the race at that time, claiming that he
and Lee had come to an understanding in 1992 that Lee would support
him to run on the KMT ticket in 1996 in return for his support for
Lee's presidential bid in 1992.
</P>
<P>
Lin and Hau quit politics after they were defeated by Lee and
Lien in the 1996 election.
</P>
<P>
Lin was not present at Sunday's ceremony in which Lien lauded Lin
and Hau for doing their best to help the KMT in the 2004 legislative
elections despite not being KMT members.
</P>
<P>
Lien, who has tried to revive the KMT by bringing back into the
party fold former KMT members who had left the party because of their
political differences with former KMT Chairman Lee Teng-hui, said he
offered Lin and Hau the positions on the KMT Advisory Council to
demonstrate the party's respect for them and its determination to
reconcile with them.
</P>
<P>
For his part, Hau said he joined the KMT in 1931 and has never
felt that he has left the party in "mentality".
</P>
<P>
He called on all those who support the "Three Principles of the
People, " which was established by KMT founder Dr. Sun Yat-sen as a
guideline for building the country, to rally behind the KMT.
</P>
<P>
Asked by journalists whether his call was directed at James
Soong, chairman of the People First Party, Hau said he would
certainly like to see Soong and his supporters return to the KMT
fold.
</P>
<P>
Soong was expelled from the KMT after he decided to run against
KMT candidate Lien Chan in the 2000 presidential race. Soong founded
his own party after the Democratic Progressive Party candidate Chen
Shui-bian won the election.
</P>
<P>
Several other former KMT heavyweights who were kicked out of the
party after falling out with Lee Teng-hui during Lee's term as KMT
chairman between 1988 and 2000 were among the 18 members named to the
KMT Advisory Council Sunday.
</P>
<P>
KMT spokeswoman Cheng Li-wen said these former KMT heavyweights'
party membership will be restored automatically by serving on the KMT
Advisory Council.

The Times: Doctors: cancer care is in
crisis.

The government's £2 billion scheme to revolutionise the treatment
of British cancer sufferers has failed, with much of the money wasted
on creating 400 bureaucrats. A damning report by Britain's biggest
independent group of NHS doctors says many patients are waiting
longer for treatment than they were when the programme was launched
five years ago. The proportion facing"appalling"delays for
radiotherapy that could cure their cancer has doubled. Many new
machines are waiting in boxes because of staff shortages.

MOFA WELCOMES E.U. TO PLAY BIGGER ROLE IN CROSS-STRAIT ISSUES
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei, Feb. 6 (CNA)

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taiwan welcomes the European Union to play a
bigger role in cross-Taiwan Strait issues and hopes that the
international community can voice its opposition to Beijing's
proposed "anti-secession" law, according to the Ministry of Foreign
Affairs (MOFA).
</P>
<P>
The MOFA said in a statement issued late Saturday that Taiwan
expects the European Union to play a more prominent role in a broad
range of cross-strait issues to help boost peace and prosperity in
the region. It also called on the international community to take
concrete measures to stop Beijing from creating a legal basis for an
invasion of Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
The MOFA's statement came days after the European Union expressed
in a declaration its welcome for the agreement between Taiwan and
mainland China for the launch of special cross-strait Lunar New Year
charter flights to serve mainland-based Taiwan business people and
their families during the Jan. 29-Feb. 20 period.
</P>
<P>
The European Union said that it strongly believes that
cross-strait peace is of utmost importance to the rest of the world
and that it supports dialogue between the two sides to bolster
bilateral understanding and communications. It said that it welcomes
Taiwan and mainland China reopening peace talks as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
Direct transport, trade and postal links across the strait were
banned since 1949, when Taiwan and the mainland split in the wake of
civil war.

CASH NOT ENOUGH TO ENCOURAGE TAIWAN PARENTS TO HAVE MORE CHILDREN
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Feb. 6 (CNA)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Cash subsidies are not enough to encourage
parents in Taiwan to have more children, experts said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan has one of the lowest birth rates in the world.
</P>
<P>
The central government and various local county and city
governments, including those of Hsinchu City, Hsinchu County, Tainan
City, Tainan County, Miaoli County, Yunlin County and Chiayi County,
offer cash subsidies to encourage parents to have more children, the
experts said.
</P>
<P>
Taking Hsinchu City as an example, they said that the city
government in northern Taiwan offers a subsidy of NT$3,5000
(US$1,100) to parents for their first baby, and NT$20,000 and
NT$25,000 for their second and third babies, respectively. The city
also offers NT$50,000 and NT$100,000 to parents who have twins and
triplets, respectively, they added.
</P>
<P>
However, the incentives have not been effective, they pointed
out. According to statistics released by the Ministry of the
Interior, Hsinchu City registered the highest birth rate among all
cities and counties in Taiwan last year. Nevertheless, the figure
marked a decline over previous years' levels, they noted.
</P>
<P>
Citing the results of recent public opinion polls, the experts
said that more than 60 percent of Taiwan women expect the government
to put in place more concrete measures to help reduce the burden of
raising a child, such as providing day care facilities and greater
health care assistance for children aged up to six years old as well
as lowering their tax burden.
</P>
<P>
Despite the fact that the government has implemented some
measures to help parents, the public thinks that the government can
still do more, the experts said.
</P>
<P>
Chien Tai-lang, vice minister of the interior, said in a recent
seminar that the government is gravely concerned about Taiwan's
population growth rate, which is expected to dip into negative
figures around 2022.
</P>
<P>
Quoting academic studies, Chien said that Taiwan citizens aged
over 65 years will account for 39 percent of the country's total
population by 2051.
</P>
<P>
As encouraging parents to have more children is an established
government policy, relevant government bodies, including the Ministry
of Education, the Council for Economic Planning and Development, and
the Interior Ministry, will join forces to iron out a "population
white paper" next month to serve as the guidelines for building a
favorable atmosphere to encourage parents to have more children,
Chien said.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan women gave birth to an average of 1.24 babies last year --
one of the world's lowest rates.
</P>
<P>
Couples in France and the United States had an average of 1.9 and
1.2 babies in 2004, while the figures for Sweden and Italy were 1.2
and 1.5, respectively, according to statistics compiled by the
Ministry of the Interior.

Taiwan's machinery industry is estimated to
have experienced growth of 11.2 percent in production value for 2004,
hitting NT$501.4 billion (US$15.7 billion) for the year, according to
the latest government statistics.
</P>
<P>
Tallies released by the Industrial Technology Intelligence
Services (ITIS) under the Ministry of Economic Affairs showed that
machinery imports and exports reached NT$ 675.7 billion and NT$418.1
billion last year, both posting positive growth.
</P>
<P>
Despite the noticeable expansion, the fallout from mainland
China's efforts to cool its high flying economy will be a key issue
affecting the domestic industry this year, ministry officials said,
pointing out that the mainland's financial policy, such as its
interest rate adjustments, and the oil price in the international
market, will also have a significant effect on the export-oriented
sector.
</P>
<P>
In essence, the macro economy will be the main factor to
influence the prospects of the industry, the officials said.

Confucius' lesson of the day: "Perfectly honest men I do not

possess what they really do not possess; pretend to have plenty, when
they have really nothing; and pretend to be in affluence when they
are in actual want -- in such a state of society, it is difficult to
be even a scrupulous man."

<P>
The Central Weather Bureau (CWB) issued a
thick fog warning for northern and western Taiwan for the second
straight day Monday.
</P>
<P>
Thick fog, caused by warm and damp air from the Pacific Ocean,
has hampered air traffic in Taiwan and the Taiwan Strait area since
Sunday, and the situation is not expected to improve until late
Tuesday, the eve of Chinese New Year, CWB meteorologists reported.
</P>
<P>
The weather bureau forecast rainy days for the first couple of
days of the Lunar New Year holiday.
</P>
<P>
Some 150 flights of foreign and domestic airlines have been
delayed or canceled since Sunday morning at Chiang Kai-shek
International Airport in Taoyuan, northern Taiwan as a result of poor
visibility. At least 15,000 passengers have been affected, according
to CKS airport authorities.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Chiayi Airport in southern Taiwan was closed Monday
morning due to the thick fog. The airport will not re-open for air
traffic until it turns sunny, according to airport authorities there.
</P>
<P>
On the outlying island of Kinmen, air traffic was not noticeably
affected by the thick fog, thanks to use of the cutting-edge ILS
system which allows aircraft to land or take off accurately despite
low visibility.
</P>

All Taiwan-bound flights from Kinmen have been full since Sunday
as large numbers of Kinmen residents as well as mainland-based Taiwan

Monday paid a visit to the Candy World 2005 festival being held in
Chiali township, Tainan County.
</P>
<P>
President Chen arrived at the festival at around 10 a.m. to the
warm welcome of tourists as well as children.
</P>
<P>
While handing out candies, the president reminisced about his
impoverished childhood when he saw a sugar cane vehicle pass by.
Chen, the son of a poor tenant farmer, talked about how he had
to cook meals as a child while his parents were busy working out in
the fields.
</P>
<P>
The president said the more affluent young generation of today
can't imagine the difficulties that his generation had to face.
</P>
<P>
He also said that the prosperity that Taiwan now enjoys is the
result of the efforts and contributions of the 23 million people of
Taiwan, adding that everyone should cherish the hard-earned fruits of
their labor.
</P>
<P>
The festival, co-organized by the Cultural Affairs Bureau of the
Tainan County Government and the Taiwan Agricultural Strategy
Coalition, has 11 sections, including candy exhibitions from 25
countries, music and theater for children, a science fun house, a
children's playground, a 3-D animation theater, a Yami cultural
gallery, and an outdoor carnival.
</P>
<P>
Three of the most popular attractions are the International Candy
Exhibition Hall, the Candy Fun House and the International Chocolate
Exhibition Hall.
</P>
<P>
The festival will run through Feb. 28.

NEW CABINET URGED TO PAY CLOSER ATTENTION TO AGRICULTURAL SECTOR
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Feb.  7 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The new Cabinet under the leadership of
Premier Frank Hsieh was urged Monday to pay closer attention to the
interests and development of the farming and fishery sectors.
</P>
<P>
Professor Yang Ping-shih from National Taiwan University called
for Premier Hsieh and his Cabinet ministers to visit farming and
fishery communities often in order to deepen their understanding of
the needs of Taiwan's farmers and fishermen.
</P>
<P>
Yang said that Taiwan's agricultural sector has been ignored for
too long. He noted that although the agricultural sector's output
only constitutes about 1.6 percent of the country's gross domestic
product (GDP) , agriculture is the bedrock of national development,
with a large number of people making a living from it.
</P>
<P>
He urged the administration not to judge the value of the
agricultural sector based solely on its output, which he said is only
part of the picture.
</P>
<P>
Yang offered several suggestion on how the administration could
help facilitate development in the agricultural sector, including
drafting policies to better protect farmer's and fishermen's
interests and welfare; helping increase agricultural exports;
ensuring food safety and sanitation for consumers; and bolstering
collaboration between the research and production fields.
</P>
<P>
Asserting that the "sun is not setting" on Taiwan's agriculture
sector, Yang said that if the government can collaborate with the
farmers and help them find new niches in the market, then the
agricultural sector will have a bright future and in turn help
sharpen Taiwan's international competitiveness.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Lee Chin-lung, chairman of the Cabinet-level Council
of Agriculture, said that one of the priorities of his council this
year is to step up promotion of Taiwan's agricultural exports as well
as the development biotechnology parks.
</P>
<P>
Lee also spelled out five core agricultural policies that his
council plans to carry out this year: namely developing added-value
agriculture in order to raise the island's international
competitiveness; promoting "safe" agriculture to protect consumers'
rights; integrating the tourism and leisure and agriculture sectors
to raise living standards in rural areas; developing
environmentally-friendly agriculture; and facilitating overall
development in the farming and fishery sectors to help boost incomes
and living standards for farmers and fishermen.

<P>
The Ministry of Education has taken the
initiative to provide relief assistance and counselling to overseas
Chinese students studying in Taiwan whose families have been affected
by the Dec. 26 tsunami tragedy.
</P>
<P>
Education officials noted that the ministry had asked colleges
and universities to investigate the situation of the overseas
students in the wake of the tsunami disaster that hit 11 countries in
Southeast Asia and South Asia.
</P>

The study found that six overseas Chinese students in Taiwan come
from Aceh, Indonesia and that their families suffered the most
serious losses. In response, the ministry gave each of the students
NT$50,000 (US$1,587).
</P>
<P>
Six other students whose families also suffered losses in the
tsunami tragedy received NT$30,000 each.
</P>

<P>
Premier Frank Hsieh expressed his
appreciation Monday to all police officers around Taiwan for
continuing to carry out their duties of maintaining social order
during the week-long Chinese New Year holiday period.
</P>
<P>
The premier made the comments while visiting the police
department in Taichung, central Taiwan. During the visit, he also
presented cash awards to police officers who have helped solve major
criminal cases.
</P>
<P>
Hsieh was accompanied by Lee Ying-yuan, secretary-general of the
Executive Yuan; Cho Jung-tai, spokesman of the Executive Yuan; Liao
Yung-lai, executive director of the Central Office of the Executive
Yuan; and National Police Administration Director General Hsieh
Yin-tang.

Taichung Mayor Jason Hu, in welcoming Hsieh's entourage,
expressed his appreciation for the premier's concern about social
order in his city.
</P>
<P>
Social order has been a major concern for Taichung's residents,
Hu said, noting that the problem of a shortage of police officers in
the city persists.
</P>
<P>
The premier said that as Hu is a good friend, he chose Taichung
as his first stop in visiting the police departments around the
island.
</P>
<P>
Hsieh also said that as a former mayor of Kaohsiung, he is aware
of the tremendous pressure faced by local chiefs regarding social
order, adding that he used to wake up in the middle of the night when
he heard sirens of the fire trucks and would immediately call the

TAIPEI MAYOR REAFFIRMS RESOLVE TO WORK FOR KMT REFORM AND UNITY
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Feb.  7  (CNA)

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou on Monday
reaffirmed his commitment to working for reform and unity of the
opposition Kuomintang (KMT).
</P>
<P>
Ma, a vice chairman of the KMT who reportedly is planning to run
for the party's chairmanship in the next election set for this May,
said he has always been concerned about the development of the party
and that his plans will not change despite some party heavyweights
supporting incumbent KMT Chairman Lien Chan to continue in his post.
</P>
<P>
Ma has not openly announced his decision to run for the KMT
chairmanship. Speaking on the matter over the weekend, Ma said he is
willing to take a greater share of the responsibilities but added
that there are some other matters that he needs to take into
consideration.
</P>
<P>
While it is widely believed that Lien will step down in May,
senior KMT member Hsu Li-nung expressed upon rejoining the party
Sunday his support for Lien to run for re-election. Hsu said Ma is
too young for the position.
</P>
<P>
The 54-year-old Ma said people his age are always too young in
the eyes of the older generation and not young at all in the eyes of
the younger generation.
</P>
<P>
Ma said that the KMT is a pluralistic party and that he believes
a consensus on the direction of the party will be reached among its
members through communication and consultation.
</P>
<P>
Ma made the remarks while visiting low-income senior citizens who
live alone in the city ahead of Lunar New Year. The mayor presented
each of the seniors with a red envelope containing NT$500 (US$15.78)
and some Lunar New Year gifts including glutinous rice cakes and
ginseng tea.
</P>
<P>
According to the city's Department of Social Welfare, there are
230 low-income senior citizens who live on their own in the city.
</P>
<P>
The department has handed out food, quilts and red envelopes to
these citizens ahead of the Lunar New Year in cooperation with
private social welfare organizations, officials said.

INTERVIEW REQUIREMENT FOR VIETNAMESE BRIDES RECEIVED POSITIVELY: MOFA
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,   Feb.  6  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The government's reinstated measure
requiring Vietnamese women intending to marry Taiwan men to undergo
face-to-face pre-marriage interviews has received a positive response
from Vietnamese authorities and Taiwanese businessmen operating in
Vietnam, diplomatic officials said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Officials from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) made the
remarks after Chen Wen-chuan, president of a private association
dedicated to helping intermarried couples, committed suicide last
week and left a suicide note for Premier Frank Hsieh calling for
government attention to what he called the "troubles and confusions"
brought about by the reinstated interview requirement.
</P>
<P>
Chen claimed that the measure has affected the rights of foreign
brides and intermarriage brokers.
</P>
<P>
According to the MOFA officials, the number of Taiwan nationals
marrying Vietnamese women has been increasing significantly in recent
years, with the figure now standing at about 10,000 per year.
</P>
<P>
In 1999, the officials said, Taiwan's representative office in Ho
Chi Minh City in southern Vietnam replaced its face-to-face interview
requirement for would-be Vietnamese brides with a "group
presentation" requirement.
</P>
<P>
With social problems resulting from Taiwanese-Vietnamese
intermarriages getting ever more serious, the Control Yuan, Taiwan's
top watchdog body, asked the Executive Yuan last November to
prudently address the social and legal problems involving foreign and
mainland Chinese spouses of Taiwan nationals.
</P>
<P>
Against this backdrop, the MOFA directed the nation's
representative offices in the Vietnamese capital of Hanoi and Ho Chi
Minh City to stringently screen suspicious visa applications and to
reinstate face-to-face interviews for would-be Vietnamese brides.
</P>
<P>
Acting on the latest MOFA directive, the representative office in
Ho Chi Minh City reinstated the face-to-face interview requirement
Jan. 4. Since then, the rejection rate for intermarriage-related visa
applications stands at about 30 percent, MOFA officials said, adding
that those who fail to secure a visa the first time they apply can
re-apply after three months.
</P>
<P>
MOFA officials said the ministry will invite all relevant
government agencies to a Feb. 18 meeting to discuss issues regarding
screening of visa applications for would-be brides from Southeast
Asian countries.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Ministry of the Interior (MOI) expressed its
regret over Chen's suicide in a press statement.
</P>
<P>
The ministry also said in the press release that the government
has always paid much attention to the well-being of foreign and
mainland spouses of Taiwan citizens.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the government has long been implementing a special
project to help foreign and mainland spouses adapt to Taiwan's
lifestyle, the press statement said the Executive Yuan has set up a
NT$3 billion fund for various relevant educational and welfare
programs. Those programs have been carried out by the MOI, the
Ministry of Education and the Council of Labor Affairs, respectively,
the statement said.
</P>
<P>
It added that the face-to-face interviews of would-be foreign
brides are mainly aimed at protecting the rights and interests of
legally married couples and at blocking entry for those who intend to
come to Taiwan through marriages of convenience to engage in criminal
operations. Mainland Chinese citizens intending to marry Taiwan
nationals are also now required to undergo face-to-face interviews.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, MOI officials urged unlicensed private intermarriage
brokers to apply with responsible government agencies as soon as
possible to become legal brokerages for legal protection.
</P>
<P>
According to media reports, more than 86,000 Vietnamese women
have married Taiwan men over the past few years. Quoting statistics
compiled by the Taipei Economic and Cultural Office in Ho Chi Minh
City, the reports said the divorce rate among Taiwanese-Vietnamese
intermarried couples surged to 13 percent last year from an average
of about 8 percent in previous years.
</P>
<P>
A MOFA official stationed in Ho Chi Minh City said an average of
about 20 Taiwan men per week approach his office for assistance in
locating their "missing or lost" wives and children. He said an
estimated 3,000 Taiwanese-Vietnamese mixed-race children may now be
"languishing" somewhere in Vietnam.

MAINTAINING ECONOMIC STABILITY IS CHALLENGE FOR NEW CABINET: EXPERTS
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Feb.  7 (CNA)
(By Y.F. Low)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With Taiwan's economic growth expected to
slow down this year, it will be a challenge for the new Cabinet led
by Premier Frank Hsieh to maintain economic stability, analysts said
Monday.
</P>
<P>
According to the Council for Economic Planning and Development,
the economic growth rates forecasted by various research institutes
for 2005 range from 4 percent to 5 percent, which are lower than the
5 percent to 6 percent that was projected for 2004.
</P>
<P>
Wu Rong-I, president of the Taiwan Institute of Economic
Research, said it is important for Hsieh to avoid conflicts between
the ruling and opposition parties to minimize the influence from
political factors over the economy.
</P>
<P>
Wu said executive ability is crucial to the performance of the
new Cabinet and that Hsieh should avoid any drastic policy shift
during his term.
</P>
<P>
A lot of the good policies put forth by former Premier Yu
Shyi-kun, such as the "10 new major development projects, " should be
continued, Wu suggested.
</P>
<P>
Wu Hui-lin, a research fellow at the Chung Hua Institution for
Economic Research, pointed out that while Hsieh has pledged to
promote consultations between the ruling and opposition parties,
stability and improvement of the economy is still the issue that
people are the most concerned about.
</P>
<P>
Though Yu laid a solid foundation for the economy during his
three-year term, the development of Taiwan's hi-tech industries
remains an urgent issue that Hsieh needs to deal with, Wu Hui-lin
said.
</P>
<P>
Wu Hui-lin said it is time the government reconsidered whether
hi-tech industries should continue to enjoy exclusive preferential
treatment when these industries have contributed to only 1.4 percent
of indirect tax revenue of the country.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, citing the results of a recent survey, Taiwan
Thinktank analyst Chou Yung-hung said Hsieh's premiership is
supported by the majority of people in Taiwan owing to his brilliant
performance during his term as Kaohsiung mayor.
</P>
<P>
Most respondents of the survey expect Hsieh to make economic
development and social welfare his priority policies while
establishing a "Cabinet of consultations," Chou noted.

KINMEN MAGISTRATE ADVOCATES FURTHER OPENING OF 'MINI THREE LINKS'
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Kinmen, Feb. 7 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Kinmen Magistrate Lee Chu-feng expressed the
hope Monday that the government can further ease its policy on direct
trade, postal and transportation links, commonly known as the "mini
three links, " between the two outlying islands of Kinmen and Matsu
with mainland China's Fujian province.
</P>
<P>
Lee made the remarks as he inspected Shuitou Wharf in Kinmen --
the jumping off point for Taiwan businessmen operating in the
mainland plying the shipping route between Kinmen and Xiamen, Fujian
province.
</P>
<P>
The Kinmen County Government has estimated that from Jan. 29 to
Feb. 6, 13,748 passengers made the trip between Kinmen and Xiamen,
and that the number could top 15,000 by Feb 7.
</P>
<P>
Just over 65 percent departed from Xiamen to Kinmen, while 35
percent came the other way. The passengers were mostly Taiwan
businessmen and their families returning to Taiwan proper via Kinmen.
</P>
<P>
Lee was satisfied with the situation, saying that the government
has since March 2004 further opened the " mini three links," allowing
Taiwan businessmen operating in places outside Fujian to shuttle
between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait via the channel.
</P>
<P>
Because of this, 405,000 trips were made last year, Lee said,
adding that he believes that if the government can further open its
policy, the "mini three links" will become a shortcut for Taiwan
people shuttling between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait.
</P>
<P>
Wu Chin-chung, president of the Taiwan Businessmen Association in
Xiamen, took the first ferry from Xiamen to arrive at Shuitou Wharf,
Kinmen Monday.
</P>
<P>
Wu said that although there are charter flights between Taiwan
and mainland China this year between Jan. 29 and Feb. 20 to
facilitate Taiwan businessmen in the mainland to return to Taiwan for
the Chinese New Year, the Kinmen-Xiamen direct link has its own
advantage, saying that he knows personally that Taiwan businessmen in
Zhejiang and Guangxi provinces choose to ply the route to return to
Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
"The route is especially favored by those Taiwan businessmen who
reside in central Taiwan," he said.
</P>
<P>
The government opened the "mini three links" in January 2001.

HELPING HANDS REACH OUT TO VILLAGE OF MISFORTUNE
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taichung,  Feb.  7 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
One small village in central Taiwan has
had more than its fair share of misfortune -- being decimated by the
7.6-magnitude earthquake on Sept. 21, 1999 and then having their
homes and bridges swept away by flooding from a typhoon last summer.
</P>
<P>
But in the end, it was the helping hand of compassionate
strangers that got the people -- particularly the children -- back on
their feet.
</P>
<P>
The 921 Earthquake, as it has come to be known, killed over 2,400
people, mostly in the central part of the island, and the small
Lileng Atayal tribal village in the rural Hoping township in Taichung
was hard hit.
</P>
<P>
In an effort to rebuild, one of the teachers at the only
elementary school put out a call last May on the Internet for people
to donate books. Within a short time the school had received 12,000
books; but a new problem arose -- where to keep them all.
</P>
<P>
The teacher behind the Internet plea, Chang Chien-hua, went back
online and soon a woman from Changhua County gave the school 15
wooden bookcases. Even so, the shelves could only hold about
one-third of the books.
</P>
<P>
Chang said he was astounded by the overwhelming generosity and
compassion demonstrated by people around Taiwan after he received so
many books in such a short time.
</P>
<P>
The school children were happy to sort and arrange the books,
Chang said. "It was the first time in their lives to see so many
books in one place," he recalled.
</P>
<P>
Things were looking up for the school until last July when a
typhoon hit the island, triggering numerous mudslides and flooding.
</P>
<P>
Some village residents, still living in "temporary" housing of
converted shipping containers saw their houses swept away, along with
the only two bridges linking the village with the outside world.
</P>
<P>
Most importantly, the village's farming and cultural settings --
the lifeline of the aboriginal people -- were ruined.
</P>
<P>
For a time, the books were the only source of solace, Chang said.
</P>
<P>
Finally, Chang made a final appeal on the Internet for help, this
time for more aid than just books.
</P>
<P>
Top Taiwan pop singer A-mei, who is an aborigine from eastern
Taiwan, gave a benefit concert exclusively for Lileng village,
raising NT$110,000.
</P>
<P>
Chang used the money to build an audio-visual theater at the
village's activity center.
</P>
<P>
The Cultural and Educational Foundation of the International
Commercial Bank of China donated some NT$400,000, enabling the
village to be equipped with computers and English-teaching
facilities.
</P>
<P>
In addition, according to Chang, students from Taichung Normal
College and the city's Providence University have taken turns
visiting the village at weekends to teach the villagers and children
computer skills and English.
</P>
<P>
Chang is pragmatic about the ups and downs of the village: "Even
at the darkest times, we always find that there is light at the end
of the tunnel."

JAPAN TO PASS TEMPORARY 'VISA-FREE' MEASURE FOR TAIWAN SOON
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Tokyo,  Feb. 7 (CNA)
(By Perry Hsieh and Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Despite mainland China's repeated protests,
the upper house of Japan's Diet is expected to pass a special bill
Wednesday to offer visa-free privileges for Taiwan tourists during a
world exposition to be held in Japan later this year, major Japanese
news media reported over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
With a view to attracting more foreign visitors to the Aichi
World Expo to be held in the central Japanese prefecture of Aichi
from March 25 to Sept. 25, the Japanese government has decided to
waive visa requirements for Taiwan and South Korean tourists during
the six-month period.
</P>
<P>
As Japan does not maintain formal diplomatic ties with Taiwan, it
will have to revise its existing law to allow visas for Taiwan
tourists to be waived during the Aichi Expo.
</P>
<P>
According to the latest Japanese media reports, the Japanese
House of Councilors, or the upper house of the Diet, will pass the
revision bill proposed by lawmakers from the ruling coalition of the
Liberal Democratic Party and the New Komeito Party at its plenary
session Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
As part of its Aichi Expo promotional campaign, the Japanese
government has also decided to issue visas for prospective visitors
from all mainland Chinese provinces and cities during the six-month
period. At present, Japan only accepts visa applications from
residents in three major mainland cities and five coastal mainland
provinces.
</P>
<P>
However, Beijing authorities have on many occasions protested
Japan's allegedly discriminatory measures. Among others, a senior
mainland tourism official told visiting Japanese Land, Infrastructure
and Transportation Minister Kazuo Kitagawa in Beijing late last month
that it was unacceptable for Japan to require visas for mainland
nationals while exempting Taiwanese tourists from visa requirements.
</P>
<P>
Japanese media reports said Japan has decided to offer visa-free
privileges for Taiwan tourists mainly because Taiwan is Japan's
second-largest source of foreign tourists after South Korea and
because few Taiwan tourists overstay their visas. In contrast,
Japanese news media said, there have been a lot of cases involving
mainland Chinese tourists overstaying their visas since Japan opened
its doors to mainland tourists a few years ago.

PREMIER WANTS LOCAL CHIEFS' INPUT ON NATIONAL HEALTH INSURANCE PROGRAM
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Feb. 7 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Premier Frank Hsieh said in Chiayi county,
southern Taiwan, Monday that he will soon invite the chiefs of local
governments to discuss the financially troubled national health
insurance program.
</P>
<P>
Hsieh made the remarks in Chuchi township, Chiayi County.
Accompanying him were Lee Ying-yuan, secretary-general of the
Executive Yuan, Chiayi County Magistrate Chen Ming-wen, and
legislators Tsai Chi-fang and Chang Hua-kuan of the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party.
</P>
<P>
Hsieh noted that in five years, one out of every five people will
be a senior citizen; therefore, the government should complete
legislation of an annuity for the elderly and revamp the national
health insurance program.
</P>
<P>
However, he lamented the fact that the Legislative Yuan is
constantly mired in partisan confrontations and never seems to manage
to have a serious discussion on the matter.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the national health insurance program could go
bankruptcy in three months judging from the fact that the program is
losing more than one billion NT dollars every month.
</P>
<P>
He said that he wants to meet with the chiefs of cities and
counties to sound them out on the problems and possible solutions
this month or early next month.
</P>
<P>
The venue is temporarily set for Taitung in the hopes that a
scenic backdrop will be conducive to reasoned argument on the
subject, Hsieh added.
</P>
<P>
Hsieh called on Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng last week
to solicit his assistance for several proposed amendments to related
statutes to help the national health insurance program stay afloat,
including amendments to existing laws to allow for the transfer of
tobacco and liquor tax revenues into the financially strapped
program.
</P>
<P>
Hsieh said that the Executive Yuan is also mulling raising the
ceiling of the national health insurance premium, and is leaning
toward having those who have higher incomes pay a higher premium.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Magistrate Chen introduced sweet jujubes, succulent
pears and October longans, which are distinctive agricultural
produce, to the premier.
</P>
<P>
Hsieh said Taiwan's fruits are world famous, but that farmers
have to upgrade their quality and study how to better distribution
channels to meet the challenges that will come from the current and
upcoming World Trade Organization talks.
</P>
<P>
Hsieh also visited the only mobile medical "hospital" in Taiwan
-- which cost the Chiayi County Government NT$20 million
(US$634,920).
</P>
<P>
The unit caters to remote villages and towns in Chiayi. But since
there are over 100 such remote areas, the vehicle will only be able
to stop in each place once every several months.
</P>
<P>
Magistrate Chen suggested to the premier that the central
government subsidize the NT$20 million needed to add another vehicle
to better care for people in remote areas.

LEE TENG-HUI LIBRARY PROJECT IN THE PIPELINE
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Feb.  7 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The proposal to build a library to keep
personal effects and historical records related to former President
Lee Teng-hui's 12-year presidency is in the pipeline, sources close
to Lee said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Former Taiwan Solidarity Union Legislator Cheng Chen-lung said
Lee's friends have begun preparations for raising funds to set up a
Lee Teng-hui Library Foundation to build and manage the proposed
library.
</P>
<P>
It has been tentatively decided that the library will be located
in Lee's hometown of Sanchih, a coastal township on Taipei's northern
outskirts, Cheng said, adding that the building will concurrently
house the library and classrooms for the Lee Teng-hui School.
</P>
<P>
As official documents, archives and artifacts regarding retired
presidents have been kept at the state-run Academia Historica, Cheng
said the proposed Lee Teng-hui Library will mainly display Lee's
personal letters, books and historical records.
</P>
<P>
Once the project is realized, it will be Taiwan's first library
dedicated to a former president. Lee served as the Republic of China
president from 1988 through May 20, 2000. As the first Taiwan-born
president, Lee contributed much to Taiwan's transformation from
authoritarian rule to a democracy and the shaping of Taiwan's
national identity distinct from that of China.
</P>
<P>
The Lee Teng-hui School is run by Taiwan Advocates, a private
think tank headed by Lee, to enhance local people's knowledge about
Taiwan's history, culture and developments over the past 400 years.
According to Cheng, every class opened by the school has invariably
received enthusiastic response.
</P>
<P>
"There have been no empty seats in any class. The current
classrooms at the Taiwan Research Institute are not spacious enough
to meet the demand. We need a new place to accommodate more students,
" Cheng said, adding that a blueprint for the Lee Teng-hui Library
project will be unveiled later.

PREMIER NOT TO ANNOUNCE CHOICE OF VICE PREMIER BEFORE FEB. 17
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Feb. 7 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Premier Frank Hsieh said Monday he is still
waiting for a response from the opposition Kuomintang (KMT) to his
invitation to one of its vice chairmen to serve as his deputy.
</P>
<P>
Hsieh made the remarks during an inspection tour of the emergency
relief command center at the National Fire Administration under the
Ministry of the Interior.
</P>
<P>
With a view to promoting inter-party reconciliation, Hsieh has so
far left vacant the vice premier post and has repeatedly expressed
his desire to invite KMT Vice Chairman P. K. Chiang, who is
concurrently a legislator-at-large, to serve as his deputy.
</P>
<P>
However, KMT Chairman Lien Chan has demanded party-to-party
negotiations on a number of critical issues as prerequisites for
Chiang to join Hsieh's Cabinet.
</P>
<P>
Hsieh disclosed that his invitation has so far not made any
progress.
</P>
<P>
As Lien will go abroad Tuesday for a vacation, Hsieh said the two
sides are not expected to have further contacts during the upcoming
Chinese Lunar New Year holiday, which will run through Feb. 13.
</P>
<P>
Hsieh said he will honor his promise to give the KMT more time to
consider his offer.
</P>
<P>
"I'll wait for a goodwill response from the KMT. But as the new
Legislative Yuan will begin its new session Feb. 15, I cannot wait
too long. I'll wait until Feb. 17. If the KMT fails to give me a
response by that time, I'll then announce who my deputy will be, "
Hsieh said.
</P>
<P>
Lien said last week that the ruling Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) must negotiate with the KMT to clarify and seek consensus on
certain critical policy issues before the KMT accepts the DPP's offer
to appoint Chiang.
</P>
<P>
The issues to be discussed should include the country's status,
the opening of direct transportation links with mainland China, plans
to change the official name of the country, investigations into last
year's presidential election-eve shooting of President Chen
Shui-bian, and attempts to liquidate the KMT's ill-gotten assets, in
addition to the controversial Fourth Nuclear Power Plant project,
Lien said, adding that the two parties also need to negotiate on how
much authorization Chiang will enjoy as vice premier to ensure he
will not be just a dummy in the DPP government.
</P>
<P>
In a previous response, Hsieh said that as a premier, he cannot
fulfill the KMT's prerequisites because those terms go beyond his
authority.

ROC OFFICIAL IN INDIA WRITES TO PAPER OF TAIWAN'S ISOLATION
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Feb.  7 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Taiwan official's appeal in an Indian
weekly to end the international isolation of the Republic of China
was echoed in a letter to the same broadsheet.
</P>
<P>
Reader John Alexander from Nagpur, Maharashtra, wrote that the
opinion piece by Simon C. Hsieh, the director of the Information
Division, Taipei Economic and Cultural Center in New Delhi, should
"find sympathetic echo in the hearts and minds of people across the
world."
</P>
<P>
Noting that Taiwan has pledged to donate US$50 million in relief
to the tsunami-stricken countries around the India Ocean -- the
world's 11th-largest donor -- the letter regretted that Taiwan was
not invited to the international meeting on tsunami aid in Jakarta on
the grounds that it is not a UN member.
</P>
<P>
"Ostracization of Taiwan by the international community is
painful, to say the least," the letter went on.
</P>
<P>
The letter was a response to Hsieh's appeal carried in the Jan.
22 issue of the Sahara Time.
</P>
<P>
In his appeal, Hsieh touted Taiwan's generous aid to the
tsunami-ravaged countries after the Dec. 26 disaster, including a
program initiated by its Government Information Office to raise funds
to "adopt" 10,000 children from the disaster area, providing for
their needs for three years.
</P>
<P>
However, Hsieh's letter said, Taiwan's significant contributions
to the relief operation didn't earn it a seat at the Jan. 6
conference when the heads of the world's major donor countries
gathered in Jakarta, Indonesia to coordinate their relief operation,
because Taiwan is not a UN member.
</P>
<P>
"We are living in a global village where all the members are
interdependent on each other, " Hsieh wrote, adding that Taiwan's
exclusion from the aid effort was unwise.

NUMBER OF MINI LINKS PASSENGERS HIT SINGLE DAY HIGH OF 1,992
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Feb.  7 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With only two days left until the Feb. 9
Chinese New Year holiday, a record high of 1,992 passengers for a
single day traveled between Xiamen and Kinmen Sunday, according to
tallies made public Monday by Kinmen authorities.
</P>
<P>
More than 90 percent of the passengers were mainland-based Taiwan
businessmen and their families returning home for the lunar new year
holiday -- 1,381 from Xiamen to Kinmen and 611 vice versa, statistics
compiled by the Kinmen harbor authorities showed.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, more than 1,600 people used the ferry service between
the two sides Monday -- 1,142 from Xiamen to Kinmen and 523 in the
opposite direction.
</P>
<P>
As of the same day, a total of 15,413 passengers had sailed
between Kinmen and Xiamen since Jan. 29, a number exceeding the
harbor's target, an official said, noting that passengers'
willingness to use the direct Kinmen-Xiamen shipping links were not
affected by the special charter flight service between Taiwan and
mainland China during the lunar new year festival period through Feb.
20.
</P>
<P>
The figure stood at 13,748 as of late Sunday, the official said,
adding that most of the homecoming travelers from mainland China,
about 10,000, used the service to transfer to destinations on Taiwan
proper.
</P>
<P>
The Kinmen-Xiamen shipping links form part of the so-called
"three mini links" -- along with direct trade and transport links --
between Taiwan's Kinmen and Matsu islands connecting Xiamen and Mawei
ports in mainland China's Fujian province. The links were established
on Jan. 1, 2001 to help promote economic development on the two
frontline islands.
</P>
<P>
Full direct links across the Taiwan Strait have been absent since
1949, when the nationalist forces retreated to Taiwan after a civil
war with Chinese communists in mainland China.
</P>
<P>
In response to a call by the international community to reduce
tensions between the two sides and an enthusiastic call by a large
number of Taiwan business people operating in mainland China,
representatives from the two sides agreed upon a ground-breaking pact
in the middle of last month in Macau on the direct charter flight
service during the Chinese New Year holidays.
</P>
<P>
The landmark agreement, involving six carriers from either side,
permitted the first landings of mainland carriers on Taiwan soil in
more than 55 years.
</P>
<P>
The charter flights were limited to Taiwan business people and
their dependents based in the mainland, who have repeatedly called
for setting up regular commercial flights across the Taiwan Strait in
view of two-way close and frequent exchanges despite long-standing
political feuding between the two sides.

SPECULATION ON RENMINBI BOOSTS VALUE OF NEW TAIWAN DOLLAR
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Feb.  7 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The new Taiwan dollar is expected to
continue to surge after the lunar new year holidays on rampant
speculation that mainland China will allow its currency to freely
float within a narrow range, market sources said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Backed on continued influx of cash from foreign investors over
the past few weeks, the local currency may continue to rise and
challenge the level of NT$31.50 to the U.S. dollar after the lunar
new year holiday period, market watchers said.
</P>
<P>
Amid sluggish trading in the pre-holiday period, the new Taiwan
dollar kept its robust rising streak against the U.S. dollar during
the trading session Saturday -- the last trading day before the
Chinese New Year Holiday -- in the Taipei foreign exchange market.
But the local unit gave way by NT$0.057 to finish at NT$31.68 against
the greenback as a result of strong intervention by the central bank.
</P>
<P>
They said that the local unit is expected to see a noticeable
jump in value by that time, boosted by a widely expected stronger
renminbi. They claimed, however, that Taiwan's central bank may
intervene if the local currency approaches the NT$31.50 mark. The new
Taiwan dollar has picked up in value against the U.S. currency by
more than 6 percent over the past year.
</P>
<P>
The analysts made the comments after mainland China signed on
Sunday in London a comunique endorsed by Britain, Canada, France,
Germany, Italy, Japan and the United States, agreeing to greater
exchange rate flexibility for countries with fixed currency exchanges
regimes.
</P>
<P>
Although key mainland officials fell short of setting a timetable
to loosen the exchange rate formulation system for renminbi, analysts
said that a change of attitude on the mainland side is an indication
that the mainland currency is likely to appreciate from 3 percent to 5
percent in the initial stage.
</P>
<P>
They also predicted that mainland China will not rashly make the
appreciation announcement for its currency before the Feb. 9 Chinese
New Year holiday. But they said that they are convinced that the
mainland will sooner or later permit its dollar-pegged currency to
gain in value this year.
</P>
<P>
The mainland currency has been rigidly pegged at 8.3 to the U.S.
dollar since 1995. But the renminbi's exchange rate on forward
contract delivery shows that it will appreciate by 5 percent to 7.88
against the greenback in one year, market dealers said.
</P>
<P>
Mainland China has long resisted pressure from the United States
and the European Union to float its currency, thus giving the country
an unfair advantage in foreign markets.
</P>
<P>
European Central Bank President Jean-Claude Trichet said after
the London meeting that the G-7 was convinced that "some appropriate
changes" could be foreseen in mainland China's exchange rate policy,
according to a foreign wire service report.
</P>
<P>
Ministers and bankers from the G-7 wealthy nations said in the
comunique that "more flexibility in exchange rates is desirable for
major countries or economic areas that lack such flexibility, " the
report said.
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese continue to emphasize their commitment to move to a
flexible exchange rate and we have seen steps that are consistent
with a move in this direction, " U.S. Treasury Secretary John Snow
said, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
The G-7 Group also forecast sound economic growth and eased
consumer product inflation in 2005 and reiterated currency
declarations that have been viewed by some economists that could stem
the U. S. dollar's fall.

PRESIDENT VOWS TO PURSUE STABILITY THROUGH CONSULTATIONS
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Feb. 7 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President Chen Shui-bian vowed on Monday to
pursue political stability through consultations and dialogue with
opposition political parties.
</P>
<P>
Flanked by Vice President Annette Lu, Chen told a group of
sailors at a dinner party at a Naval base in Keelung, northern
Taiwan, that stability is the general sentiment of the people, and
his administration will do its best to meet that desire.
</P>
<P>
Creating political stability through consultations and dialogue
is not only a vision and a promise made by him to the people but also
the government's firm response dictated by the people, Chen said.
</P>
<P>
However, the president said, political reconciliation and
cooperation among different political parties will be elusive unless
the parties set aside their differences and subordinate their
partisan interests to the benefit of the people and the goals of the
nation.
</P>
<P>
Recalling that he has likened the country's 23 million people to
travelers on the same boat in a speech to mark Armed Forces Day on
Sept. 3, 2003, the president said the metaphor is still valid, and so
is the motif of that speech that "we should united to fight for the
country's sustained development and for Taiwan people's wellbeing."
</P>
<P>
The president said the country owes its security and peace to the
armed forces, and as the supreme commander of the armed forces, Chen
thanked them for doing their best.
</P>
<P>
He urged the armed forces to sharpen their awareness of the
military threats posed by mainland China to Taiwan, strengthen the
country's defense, support the country's arms purchase from the
United States and be safety conscious during their routine training.
</P>
<P>
The president also wished the armed forces a happy new year at
the end of his speech.

MANY LEGISLATORS PLAN TO RUN FOR MAYORS, MAGISTRATES
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Feb.  8 (CNA)
(By Y.F. Low)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With the elections for city mayors and
county magistrates set to be held at the end of this year, a number
of incumbent and former legislators are prepared to join the races to
seek to advance their political careers.
</P>
<P>
The posts of mayors and magistrates have always been a favorite
among lawmakers planning a career shift. The high success rate is
just as encouraging: of the 23 sitting mayors and magistrates around
Taiwan, 12 used to be legislators.
</P>
<P>
The elections, which are considered a litmus test for the 2008
presidential race, will also be the main battlefront between the
"pan-blue" and "pan-green" camps.
</P>
<P>
In the coming elections, cutthroat competition within the
"pan-green" camp is expected in Yunlin County, where sitting
magistrate Chang Jung-wei will step down after finishing two terms.
</P>
<P>
While three former Yunlin-elected legislators of the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) -- Su Chih-fen, Kao Meng-ting and
Lin Kuo-hua -- have expressed their intention to vie for the party's
nomination for Yunlin magistrate, the Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU)
reportedly is planning to nominate Legislator Cheng Chen-lung to run
in the race.
</P>
<P>
Former DPP legislators Tsao Chi-hung and Lin Feng-hsi also gave
up their legislative re-election bids last year to pave the way for
running for Pingtung magistrate and Taichung magistrate,
respectively. Chiu Yi-ying, another former Pingtung-elected DPP
legislator, is being pushed by supporters to run for Pingtung
magistrate after losing her re-election bid in December.
</P>
<P>
Also, former TSU legislators Chen Chien-ming and Chien Lin
Whei-jun, who both lost their re-election bids, have expressed their
interest in the post of Taipei magistrate and Tainan mayor,
respectively.
</P>
<P>
As far as the "pan-blue" camp is concerned, competition will be
the fiercest in Taipei County. The contestants for Taipei magistrate
include opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Legislators Hung Hsiu-chu, Lee
Chia-chin and Huang Teh-fu as well as opposition People First Party
(PFP) Legislator Chou Hsi-wei.
</P>
<P>
In Keelung City, the re-election bid of Mayor Hsu Tsai-li from
the KMT is expected to be challenged by PFP Legislator Liu
Wen-hsiung.
</P>
<P>
While KMT Legislator Liu Cheng-hung is preparing to run for
Miaoli magistrate, former KMT Legislator Liao Feng-teh is reportedly
planning to run for Ilan magistrate.
</P>
<P>
KMT Legislator Cho Po-yuan, who is a former deputy Changhua
magistrate, has also expressed his intention to run for Changhua
magistrate.
</P>
<P>
To coordinate these ambitious politicians within the "pan-blue"
camp, KMT Legislator Hung Hsiu-chu proposed that the KMT and PFP hold
aprimary before the end of May to choose their candidates.

TAIWAN RED CROSS SOCIETY TO ATTEND  RELIEF CONFERENCE IN INDONESIA
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Geneva,  Feb.  7 (CNA)
(By Neil Lu and Maubo Chang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Red Cross Society of the Republic of
China has been invited to an international relief conference to be
held in Indonesia next week, according to an anonymous source from
the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) in Geneva.
</P>
<P>
The source said that Taiwan was invited to the conference because
of its generous aid to tsunami victims in South Asia.
</P>
<P>
The conference will also be attended by representatives from
mainland China, giving the two sides of the Taiwan Strait a rare
opportunity to rub shoulders at an international event.
</P>
<P>
The conference was jointly organized by the ICRC and the
International Federation of Red Crescent (IFRC) to coordinate the
relief efforts made by the Red Cross and Red Crescent across the
world.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan took offence at the fact that it was shut out of an
international relief conference organized by the Association of
Southeast Asia Nations in Jakarta, Indonesia on Jan. 6 although it
has promised to contribute US$50 million to help with relief
operations. That figures makes Taiwan the 11th-largest donor state.
</P>
<P>
The ICRC doesn't recognize the Red Cross Society of the ROC, but
invited it to the Indonesia conference anyway, "because the
conference is a working meeting without any political overtones" the
source said.
</P>
<P>
The Red Cross Society of the ROC has funnelled US$15 million to
aid tsunami victims, including US$3 million to the IFRC.

<P>
The four leading motherboard manufacturers
in Taiwan are aiming to make a total of 100 million shipments in
2005.
</P>
<P>
As motherboard shipments by Asus topped 40 million units in 2004,
Micro-Star International (MSI) and Elitegroup saw their shipments
declined to 16.5 million units and 14.5 million units during the same
period.
</P>

Meanwhile, shipments by Gigabyte Technology rose 5.2 percent to
14.5 million units last year.
</P>
<P>
Asus has set a goal for 2005 to expand its shipments further to

</P>
<P>
Facing the threat from Asus, MSI is targeting more than 17.5
million shipments this year, and Elitegroup is also ambitious to
restore its market share with 20 million shipments.

OVER 16,000 PASSENGERS USE KINMEN-XIAMEN FERRY LINKS BEFORE NEW YEAR
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  Feb. 8 (CNA)

<P>
A total of 16,189 passengers have traveled
between Taiwan and mainland China through the ferry service linking
the outlying island of Kinmen and the mainland's Xiamen port during
the 11 days before Chinese Lunar New Year, officials said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
During the period from Jan. 29 to Feb. 8, 128 ferries were
provided between the two ports, transporting 10,781 people from
Xiamen to Kinmen and 5,408 people the other way round, according to
statistics from the Kinmen County Government.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, the eve of the lunar new year, 776 passengers
traveled via the service, county government officials said.
</P>
<P>
They included 500 passengers from Xiamen to Kinmen, most of whom
were mainland-based Taiwanese businessmen and their families
returning home for the holiday. The other 276 passengers from Kinmen
to Xiamen comprised mainly mainland spouses of Taiwanese citizens and
staff of mainland-based Taiwanese investors.
</P>
<P>
The officials said the ferry service will be suspended on
Wednesday and reopen on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Kinmen-Xiamen ferry service is part of the so-called "mini
three links" between Kinmen/Matsu and Xiamen/Fuzhou.
</P>
<P>
Since the service was launched in 2001, it has become a major
means of transportation for Taiwanese businessmen based in the
southern part of the mainland to travel between the two sides.

TAIWAN TOURISM BUREAU WELCOMES VISA-FREE ENTRY TO JAPAN

<TEXT>
<P>
The expected move by Japan to give visitors
from Taiwan visa-free status for a limited time was met with approval
Tuesday from Taiwan's Tourism Bureau.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese House of Councilors, or the upper house of the Diet,
is expected to pass a revision bill proposed by lawmakers from the
ruling coalition of the Liberal Democratic Party and the New Komeito
Party at its plenary session Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
An official from the Tourism Bureau said the measures have been
long in coming as Taiwan has allowed Japanese tourists to come to
Taiwan without first obtaining a visa for the last three years.
Japan's move should boost private exchanges between the two
countries, the official added.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan tourists will be allowed into Japan without a visa between
March 25 and Sept. 30, which is timed to coincide with the Aichi
World Expo to be held in Aichi prefecture in central Japan from March
25 to Sept. 25.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan tourists can stay in Japan for three months.
</P>
<P>
A similar visa waiver will be extended to South Korean tourists
from March 1 to Sept. 30.
</P>
<P>
The official said the Japanese government had worked out the
changes to the visa requirements last September but didn't asked for
the Diet's approval until early this year because of badgering from
Beijing, which frowns on any engagement between Japan and Taiwan.

RECOVERY IN CONTRACT CHIPMAKING INDUSTRY EXPECTED IN H2 OF 2005
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Feb.  8 (CNA)
(By Y.F. Low)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The two leading contract chipmakers --
Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC) and United
Microelectronics Co. (UMC) -- expect the contract chipmaking industry
to recover in the second half of 2005, although sales are expected to
continue to slip in the first half owing to inventory adjustments in
the semiconductor sector.
</P>
<P>
Supported by the booming semiconductor sector in the first three
quarters, the sales of TSMC rose 26.8 percent year-on-year to
NT$255.99 billion (US$8.08 billion) in 2004. Net profit also jumped
95.3 percent to a record-high of NT$92.31 billion, with earnings per
share standing at NT$3.97.
</P>
<P>
UMC also did well, posting record sales of NT$117.31 billion in
2004, up 38.2 percent from the previous year. Net profit amounted to
NT$31.84 billion, with earnings per share registering at NT$1.89.
</P>
<P>
However, the impact from the inventory adjustments that started
in the fourth quarter of 2004 is expected to continue well into the
first half of 2005.
</P>
<P>
TSMC has projected a 10 percent fall in its shipments in the
first quarter of 2005 over the previous quarter and has revised its
gross margin down from 42.5 percent to 38 percent.
</P>
<P>
UMC has also predicted a 17 percent decrease in its shipments in
the first quarter and a 10 percent drop in the prices of its
products.
</P>
<P>
According to TSMC Chairman Morris Chang, the semiconductor sector
is likely to see a 10 percent growth in 2006 after experiencing a
recession in 2005.
</P>
<P>
Market analysts said the recession of the semiconductor sector is
expected to hit bottom in the first half of this year and that the
operations of TSMC and UMC will be boosted by seasonal demand and
clients' need to stock up starting from the third quarter.

ARRANGEMENTS FOR CHEN-SOONG MEETING UNDERWAY: PRESIDENTIAL AIDE
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei, Feb. 11 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Preparations and arrangements for a meeting
between President Chen Shui-bian and opposition People First Party
(PFP) Chairman James Soong will begin next Monday after the Lunar New
Year holidays, Presidential Secretary-General Yu Shyi-kun said
Friday.
</P>
<P>
Yu said that no matters pertaining to when and where the meeting
should be held have been decided, adding that President Chen is open
to ideas regarding the meeting's format and discussion topics. He
pointed out that the president will fully respect Soong's opinions in
this regard.
</P>
<P>
Yu's remarks came after local media reported that Chen and Soong
have agreed to meet on Feb. 23 in a gesture of reconciliation between
the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) and the opposition
forces in view of political instability over the past few years.
</P>
<P>
A Chen-Soong meeting has been much anticipated by the public
since the president called for compromise and ice-breaking between
the two camps in the wake of the Dec. 11 legislative elections.
</P>
<P>
Although Chen marginally won the March 20, 2004 presidential
election for a second term, the opposition "pan-blue alliance" of the
Kuomintang (KMT), the PFP and the New Party retained its majority in
the 225-seat Legislative Yuan in the Dec. 11 elections, winning a
combined 114 seats.
</P>
<P>
Many analysts predicted that this situation could prolong the
bitter domestic political conflict over the next three years.
</P>
<P>
In an effort to put an end to this, the DPP, which garnered 89
seats in the legislative elections, has tried hard to entice the PFP,
which won 34 seats, to form a stable majority with it in the sixth
Legislative Yuan which opened Feb. 1.

CHEN PITCHES FOR CROSS-STRAIT PEACE, INTER-PARTY RECONCILIATION
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Changhua,  Taiwan,  Feb.  11 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President Chen Shui-bian said
Friday he looks forward to seeing inter-party reconciliation and
cooperation as well as permanent peace across the Taiwan Strait
during the Lunar New Year of the Rooster.
</P>
<P>
Chen made the remarks while attending a flower festival activity
in Changhua County's Hsichou township in central Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
The president said he has two hopes for the new year. First of
all, Chen said he hopes all the people of Taiwan will enjoy good
fortune and prosperity. Secondly, Chen said he looks forward to
permanent cross-strait peace and an end to hostile political wrangling
between the ruling and opposition camps.
</P>
<P>
Noting that flowers come in many different colors, Chen said an
open, democratic society needs to have a myriad of political parties
in order to reflect the opinions of different segments of society.
</P>
<P>
"Flowers are beautiful because they have many colors.
Eye-catching rainbows consist of seven colors. If our political
landscape only has two 'colors' -- blue and green -- it will be too
dull and monotonous. We need orange, yellow and other colors, " Chen
said.
</P>
<P>
In Taiwan's political arena, green is the color of the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) , while blue is the color of the
main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) , and orange is that of the People
First Party (PFP) -- the KMT's "pan-blue" ally.
</P>
<P>
The DPP administration has been seeking to forge a working
partnership with the PFP and the KMT since it failed to garner a
majority in last December's legislative elections.
</P>
<P>
In his speech at the floral deity worship ritual at the Changhua
Lunar New Year Flower Show, Chen reaffirmed his determination to find
a way to engage the KMT-led opposition, which holds a slim
legislative majority.
</P>
<P>
"For the sake of the national interest and the people's
well-being, the ruling and opposition parties have to reconcile and
cooperate. We have to find a new model of working together, " Chen
said.
</P>
<P>
Touching on cross-strait relations, Chen said he hopes that the
two sides of the Taiwan Strait can stop pursuing policies and using
rhetoric that provoke each other, and instead move toward
reconciliation and cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Chen was accompanied Presidential Office Deputy Secretary-General
James Huang and DPP Legislator Chiang Chao-yi during his tour of the
annual Changhua flower show.
</P>
<P>
The president noted that the flower show attracted a record 1.57
million visitors last year. "This time around, I hope the number of
visitors will be even higher," he said.
</P>
<P>
"If you come, you'll find that the beauty of the Hsichou floral
township can compete with the likes of Paris and Amsterdam, " the
president added.

US$500,000 DONATION FOR GUATEMALA, NOT PORTILLO: ROC AMBASSADOR

<P>
A US$500,000 donation by the Republic
of China government to Guatemala in 2000 was directed to its
government, not to the then President Alfonso Antonio Portillo
Cabrera, ROC Ambassador to Guatemala Francisco H. L. Ou clarified
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Ou's comments came after the Guatemalan media reported earlier
the same day that the former Guatemalan president received US$500,000
from Taiwan in 2000 in a check bearing his personal name, instead of
the Education Ministry or Presidential Office.
</P>
<P>
Pointing out that the ROC government contributed the money to
Guatemala for the central American diplomatic ally to print handbooks
for teachers, Ou said that the fund was presented to the Guatemalan
government in a public ceremony.
</P>
<P>
Ou stressed that the ROC government made the contribution to the
Guatemalan government to carry out the project and repeated that it
was not a donation to a private individual.
</P>
<P>
The ROC Embassy is very willing to cooperate with the Guatemalan
prosecution authorities if they decide to conduct an investigation
into this case, Ou said.
</P>
<P>
According to an official at the ROC Embassy in Guatemala, the
Guatemalan Education Ministry did send various teachers' handbooks to
ROC Embassy officials as proof of the ministry's execution of the
mission.
</P>
<P>
Portillo has been living in exile in Mexico since February 2004
after stepping down from his post the same year. He has been accused
of graft, and the Guatemalan prosecution authorities are currently
conducting investigations.

AVIATION POLICE SEIZE NEARLY 250 KG OF ILLICIT DRUGS IN 2004
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Feb. 11 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Aviation Police Bureau (APB) seized a
total of 241.95 kilograms of illegal drugs last year, a record high
in recent memory, a bureau official said Friday.
</P>
<P>
According to APB tallies, ketamine made up the largest portion of
the total drugs seized, followed by heroin, marijuana, amphetamine
and ecstasy, in that order.
</P>
<P>
The APB official said most of the seized drugs were brought to
Taiwan via Southeast Asian, Hong Kong and Macau air routes, with
concealing the drugs in luggage being the most common smuggling
method.
</P>
<P>
In some cases, the illicit drugs were hidden in the soles of a
trafficker's shoes or in bags in a trafficker's trousers, or fastened
to their waist or legs.
</P>
<P>
In the past, the official said, drug trafficking rings recruited
foreigners in Hong Kong, Macau and Southeast Asian nations to smuggle
drugs into Taiwan. In recent years, he said, drug rings have often
recruited local people, including students, with no previous criminal
records, particularly unemployed persons or vagrants, to work for
them.
</P>
<P>
With advanced detecting equipment, the official said, drug
trafficking via air has become ever riskier. He urged local people
not to get involved in drug trafficking, manufacturing, trading or
abuse. He added that the maximum penalty for drug trafficking is
death.

TAIWAN DENTISTS SPREAD LOVE AND CARE IN MALAWI

<P>
A group of dentists from Taiwan
visited Malawi from Jan. 31 to Feb. 8, spreading their love and care
to the southern African country and building a bridge between the
peoples of the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The group's visit to Malawi -- its first to Africa -- was
welcomed by the locals, the vast majority of whom are too poor to
receive dental treatment at expensive private clinics. There are no
more than 20 qualified dentists in Malawi, with only two of them
serving in public hospitals -- for a population of more than 12
million people.
</P>
<P>
In addition to providing charitable services at schools,
residential communities and orphanages in the capital, the group also
donated various sets of portable equipment to their Malawian
counterparts and carried out academic exchanges with them.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Su Chen-tai, leader of the group who has practiced dentistry
for many years in Taiwan's eastern county of Hualien, claimed that
the most important aspect of their visit to Malawi was to set an
example for their local counterparts to learn to serve the poor.
</P>
<P>
The group is also considering the possibility of establishing an
institute to help foster dentists in Malawi, he added.
</P>
<P>
The group left Malawi for Swaziland on Feb. 8. Both Malawi and
Swaziland are staunch Republic of China diplomatic allies in southern
Africa. Currently, the ROC maintains formal diplomatic relations with
26 nations around the world, with most of these scattered in Latin
America and Africa.

35-45 AGE GROUP MAIN HOME BUYERS IN TAIWAN IN Q4: CEPD SURVEY
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei, Feb. 11 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
People aged between 35 and 45 were the main
home buyers in the fourth quarter of 2004 in Taiwan, accounting for
42.7 percent of the total number of buyers in the domestic
real-estate market, according to the results of a recent government
survey.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the 25-35 age group surpassed the 40 percent
mark for the first time to make up 40.4 percent of the total number
of home buyers in the final quarter of last year, the results of the
poll carried out by the Cabinet-level Council for Economic Planning
and Development (CEPD) showed.
</P>
<P>
The average age for home buyers was 35.9 years, with those with a
monthly income of between NT$30,000 and NT$60,000 (US$1,880) making
up the largest portion, or 34.1 percent, of the total number of home
buyers, according to the poll results.
</P>
<P>
In the third quarter of 2004, buyers with a monthly income above
NT$60,000 were the major driving force in the market, accounting for
59.5 percent of the total number of buyers.
</P>
<P>
CEPD officials attributed the growth in the number of younger
first time home buyers to the government's low interest rate policy,
evidenced by the fact that some 54 percent of the home buyers in the
fourth quarter were first time buyers, up from 45.9 percent in the
third quarter, according to the survey.
</P>
<P>
Second-hand homes were the most popular in the fourth quarter,
making up 46 percent of the total number of homes purchased.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the average home price was 5.7 times that of the
average family income per year, representing a drop from the third
quarter level.
</P>
<P>
Demand for second-hand houses and apartments was stronger than
that for newly-built ones in Taipei City and Taipei County, while the
demand for newly-built ones was stronger in Taoyuan County, Hsinchu
County, Taichung City and Taichung County, according to the survey.

ROC REPRESENTATIVE OFFICE IN LONDON CELEBRATES LUNAR NEW YEAR

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Republic of China representative office
in Great Britain joined with the London Press Club and the London
Foreign Press Club in holding a Taiwan-style Lunar New Year party at
the press club's conference hall Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The festivity, dubbed the Taiwan Day party, brought together more
than 150 people, including British media professionals, leading
figures of major Taiwanese associations and staff members of the
Taipei Representative Office in the U.K., to celebrate the new Year
of the Rooster.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the evening party, Lin Chun-yi, the ROC representative
to the U.K., said Taiwanese culture stems from Chinese culture just
as American culture stems from English culture. Over the years, Lin
said, Taiwanese culture has developed its own unique features in
terms of the arts, language and customs.
</P>
<P>
Lin, who assumed his current post just a month ago, said he is
hopeful that members of the British press community can get a better
understanding of Taiwan which he said is striving to consolidate its
young democracy while being isolated from the international community
due to Beijing's diplomatic suppression and military threat.
</P>
<P>
Lin said all staff members of the ROC representative office will
strengthen engagements with members of the London Press Club and the
London Foreign Press Club to help them better understand Taiwan's
achievements in various areas, including its cultural wonders.
</P>
<P>
A puppet theater troupe from Taiwan, led by veteran puppeteer
Chen Hsi-huang, performed at the evening party, winning much acclaim
from the audience. Chou chien-chang, a doctoral student at the London
School of Economics and Political Science, demonstrated the art of
traditional Chinese calligraphy, while Lin Hsing-hsiang, a Taiwan
expatriate in London versed in tea ceremony, introduced six strains
of fine-quality Taiwan tea.
</P>
<P>
Also on display were brochures and souvenirs featuring Taiwan's
tourist resources. Lin said he hopes the festivities can help inspire
more British people to visit Taiwan to experience the island's
natural and cultural wonders.

<TEXT>
<P>
Legislative Yuan President Wang Jin-pyng
said Friday he supports the proposal that sitting Kuomingtang (KMT)
Chairman Lien Chan continue to lead the main opposition party.
</P>
<P>
Wang made the remarks while hosting a Lunar New Year party in
honor of his supporters in his hometown of Luchu in the southern
county of Kaohsiung.
</P>
<P>
Wang said 2005 marks the 30th anniversary of his entry into the
political world. An emotional Wang said he wanted to take advantage
of the occasion to express his gratitude for the long-term support of
all the townsfolk. More than 5,000 people, including lawmakers from
the opposition "pan-blue alliance" of the KMT and the People First
Party (PFP) and the Non-Partisan Solidarity Union as well as Wang's
grassroots supporters, attended the massive-scale lunch party.
</P>
<P>
During the party, many of Wang's fans urged Wang to announce his
bid to run for KMT chairmanship. KMT members are expected to directly
elect a new party chairman in May.
</P>
<P>
However, Wang said he agrees with many party elders' views that
Lien should continue to head the KMT because the party still faces
many crucial challenges and needs an experienced leader to steer it
through the rough tide ahead.
</P>
<P>
"Our party must address issues regarding a merger with the PFP,
disposal of party assets and party restructuring. All these issues
are complicated and require Lien's leadership in the process of
resolving them," Wang said.
</P>
<P>
Wang, a 10-term legislator who just won the legislative
speakership for a third term, said he will not consider running for
the KMT chairmanship until after Lien definitely decides to quit the
post.
</P>
<P>
If Lien insists on stepping down as KMT chairman after his
current tenure expires in August, Wang may face competition from
popular Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou in his bid for the top KMT post. Ma
is widely believed to run for the post if Lien insists on retirement.

ROC REITERATES SOVEREIGNTY OVER TIAOYUTAI ISLANDS

(By Sofia wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Republic of China's sovereignty over the
Tiaoyutai Islands is undisputed, Ministry of Foreign Affairs
spokesman Michel Lu said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Lu made the remarks after the Japanese government took ownership
a lighthouse on a small islet of the uninhabited Tiaoyutai
archipelago Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Known as Senkaku by Japanese, the Taioyutais lie in the East
China Sea between Taiwan and Japan. Surrounded by rich fishing
waters, the island group is a frequent source of friction among the
ROC, Japan and mainland China.
</P>
<P>
Stressing that the ROC's sovereignty over the Tiaoyutais is an
undisputed fact, Lu said the ROC government hopes that the three
parties can hold peaceful talks to resolve the issue.
</P>
<P>
Mainland China ceded the Tiaoyutais along with Taiwan to Japan in
an 1895 Sino-Japanese war. The United States had jurisdiction over
them after World War II until 1972, when they were handed back to
Japan. Taiwan and mainland China say their claims to the islands date
back centuries.
</P>
<P>
A Tokyo-based right-wing group built the lighthouse on one of the
Tiaoyutai islet in 1988. The ownership of the structure, which had
since been transferred to a fishery association in the southern
Japanese prefecture of Okinawa, was passed to the Japanese government
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Lu said the ROC government will lodge a protest with Japanese
authorities after the Lunar New Year holiday.

Financial Times: Russsia restricts foreign bids.

Russia will bar foreign-owned companies from bidding for the
country's most lucrative natural resources this year in the most
explicit and sweeping manifestation of a nationalistic state policy
developed under the presidency of Vladimir Putin.

The Ministry for Natural Resources said companies would have
to be at least 51 per cent Russian-owned to take part in this year's
tenders for strategic oil and metals deposits. The rule may prevent
oil companies such as ExxonMobil and ChevronTexaco from
developing new Russian oil reserves, and also stymie TNK-BP, a
pioneering 50-50 owned Anglo-Russian oil company.

Senate Approves Measure to Curb Big Class

The U.S. Senate overwhelmingly approved a
measure on Thursday that would sharply limit the
ability of people to file class-action
lawsuits against companies. Now the measure is
heading to the House of Representatives, where
Republican leaders say it will be approved next
week and sent to the White House for President
Bush's signature. The measure would prohibit
state court from hearing many kinds of cases
they now consider, transferring them to federal
courts. Experts say many cases will wind up not
being brought because federal judges have been
constrained by a series of legal precedents from
considering large class actions that involve
varying laws of different states.

The company's struggle, at a time when Aceh's

A large majority of the British people do not want the Queen
to abdicate in favour of the Prince of Wales in the next few years,
according to a Populus poll for The Times. 

A third of the country thinks that Prince Charles's marriage to

COA TO ADOPT CARROT AND STICK APPROACH TO CONTAIN BAD PORK PROBLEM
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei, Feb. 12 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Council of Agriculture (COA) will adopt
a carrot and stick approach in an effort to prevent pork from pigs
that are sick or dead before reaching slaughterhouses from entering
the market.
</P>
<P>
COA Chairman Lee Chin-lung made the remarks during a visit to
Chiang Kai-shek International Airport Saturday to inspect the work of
quarantine officers and sniffer dogs during the Chinese New Year
holiday.
</P>
<P>
Amid public concern that a large amount of pork from pigs that
were sick or dead before reaching abattoirs has been sold by
unscrupulous money-hungry criminal farmers in local meat markets, the
COA is studying ways to manage the problem at the grassroots level,
Lee said.
</P>
<P>
The measures under study include educating pig raisers on how to
handle dead pigs properly and providing incentives to persuade them
to send sick or dead pigs to plants for producing organic fertilizer,
Lee said.
</P>
<P>
The COA will also launch a campaign warning pig raisers not to
sell their dead or sick pigs to meat markets so as not to undermine
the sale of pork in the hope that they will follow government policy.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the COA is studying measures to confiscate the
assets of criminals who make pork products from sick and dead pigs,
Lee said.
</P>
<P>
He also took the opportunity to urge the public not to bring any
fresh fruit or meat products into Taiwan, especially since the launch
of cross-Taiwan Strait charter flights Jan. 29 for the Chinese New
Year holiday.
</P>
<P>
Noting that many Taiwan people are in the habit of bringing
agricultural products into Taiwan from the mainland, he said the
COA's Bureau of Animal and Plant Health Inspection and Quarantine has
since Jan. 29 seized 640 kg of smuggled agricultural and poultry
products.

the benefit will cost US$724 billion over a

TAIWAN MUST SPEAK OUT AGAINST BEIJING'S PROPOSED ANTI-SECESSION LAW
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
New York,  Feb. 11 (CNA)
(By Eric Tseng and Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Taiwan people must speak out to let
the international community know that they are opposed to a proposed
anti-secession law by mainland China, an official of a Taiwan think
tank said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Lai Yi-chung, director of the Department of International Affairs
of Taiwan Thinktank, made the remarks in a speech on the threat posed
by the mainland on Taiwan at an overseas Chinese cultural and
educational center in New York.
</P>
<P>
The Taiwan people need to make clear that they will never accept
Beijing's approach of "defining the status quo and changing the
status quo" in the Taiwan Strait.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the tone of the so-called anti-secession law is
based on "Taiwan is an inalienable part of China," which he said is a
concept defined by the mainland.
</P>
<P>
Using the anti-secession law to define the status quo will show
that Beijing is now tilting toward adopting a harsher policy toward
Taiwan, Lai said, showing that Beijing is on the one hand trying to
squeeze democracy in Taiwan and Hong Kong, while on the other hand
using the enactment of the law to try to mitigate the political
responsibility in making decisions on Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Lai cited reports that a court may be set up under the law to
prosecute those who support Taiwan or even Tibetan and Xinjiang
independence.
</P>
<P>
For this reason, the proposed law is an "anti-freedom" law that
will not only squeeze the freedom that comes with the mainland's
economic development but will also affect human rights and democracy
in Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
As the content of the anti-secession law has not yet been made
clear, the international community will have to wait until the
proposed law is reviewed and approved by the mainland's rubber-stamp
National People's Congress in March, Lai said.
</P>
<P>
The urgent task for the Taiwan people is to let the international
community know that the anti-secession law has no market in Taiwan
and that they will not accept the way Beijing is trying to
unilaterally define the status quo in the Taiwan Strait, he added.
</P>
<P>
Lei also cited a survey conducted by Taiwan Thinktank late last
year on the Taiwan people's perception of the anti-secession law that
shows that more than 60 percent of those polled believe the
enactment of the proposed law will increase tension in the Taiwan
Strait.

Presidential Office Secretary-General Yu
Shyi-kun said Saturday that staff of President Chen Shui-bian and
opposition People First Party Chairman James Soong will officially
begin work from next Monday on arranging a meeting between the two.
</P>
<P>
Reporters have claimed that the president and Soong will meet in
an attempt to effect a reconciliation between the ruling and
opposition parties. However, the date, venue and even the issues to
be discussed have not been decided upon.
</P>
<P>
According to Yu, in order to show goodwill and sincerity, the
president has said he will respect the opposition's choice of
meeting place and date, as well as the issues on the agenda.
</P>
<P>
The president said he will also meet with all opposition leaders,
Yu said, adding that apart from Soong, Chen also hopes to meet with
Kuomintang Chairman Lien Chan to discuss national affairs.
</P>
<P>
Yu, who made the comments while responding to media questions at
his residence, reiterated his gratitude for Soong's goodwill in
agreeing to meet with Chen, saying that in order to effect
inter-party reconciliation and cooperation, Chen will communicate his
ideas and opinions with opposition leaders with sincerity and
goodwill.
</P>
<P>
Saying that Chen respects the PFP's opinion on holding the
meeting Yu expressed the hope that Chen and Soong will discuss
various issues and then report to the media.
</P>
<P>
As to whether Chen will meet with Lien, Yu said it is up to both
sides to decide.

MOFA CLARIFIES  DONATION FOR GUATEMALA
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Feb. 12 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Republic of China donation to Guatemala
was to assist a human resource investment project of the Central
American ally and was not a political donation, a spokesman for the
Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Michel Lu was responding to reports that former Guatemalan
President Alfonso Antonio Portillo Cabrera received three checks for
a total of US$1.5 million from the Taiwan government.
</P>
<P>
Lu said that the checks bore Portillo's name because he proposed
the project before he assumed the presidency. As the project was
ongoing and he continued to preside over it, the three checks were
issued in his name, according to Lu.
</P>
<P>
However, Lu admitted that making out checks to an individual's
name to assist an ally's investment project is "inappropriate" and he
added that the ministry has adjusted its approach.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan donated US$1.5 million in 2000, mainly for handbooks for
teachers and reference books, he said.
</P>
<P>
Lu said that Guatemala held an open ceremony at that time to
express appreciation for the donation, and the teachers' handbooks
and reference books were also printed with words of appreciation for
the ROC.
</P>
<P>
Portillo, who has been living in exile in Mexico since leaving
office in January 2004, has been accused of graft and the Guatemalan
prosecution authorities are investigating him.

Radiation contamination tests conducted
regularly over the past year on the country's main food, imported
food and drinking water prove that they were not affected by
radiation, according a report released Saturday by the Radiation
Monitoring Center under the Cabinet-level Atomic Energy Council.
</P>
<P>
The center, which is responsible for investigating and testing
the island's radioactive materials contained in food, regularly
collected samples from Taipei, Taichung and Kaohsiung including rice,
flour, vegetables, fruit, meat, eggs and milk to make radioactive
contamination tests. It also tested fish, shellfish and algae from
Hsinchu, Changhua, Chiayi, and Kaohsiung, all of which were negative.
</P>
<P>
To test drinking water, the center regularly collected samples
from 11 of Taipei City's water supply stations and 23 of the island's
water supply stations which also tested negative.
</P>
<P>
As for imported food, the council said the center regularly
tested radioactive contamination tests on frozen meat and milk
powder. A total of 132 milk powder samples were tested, all of which
were negative.
</P>
<P>
During the examination period, the center also sent officials to
shopping malls and markets to collect a total of 240 samples
including seafood, vegetables, dried fruit, dairy products, baby
supplies and drinks, all of which were negative for radiation
contamination.

U.S. STANCE AGAINST REMOVAL OF ARMS EMBARGO ON CHINA UNCHANGED
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Washington, Feb. 11 (CNA)
(By Oliver LIn and P.C. Tang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The U.S. State Department said Thursday
that Secretary of State Condoleeza Rice clearly explained during a
recent tour of Europe the reasons for the U.S. stance against lifting
an arms embargo on mainland China.
</P>
<P>
The department also said that the United States has not changed
its stance and has no intention of accepting the European Union's
position of lifting its arms embargo on the mainland.
</P>
<P>
Both the United States and the European Union implemented a ban on
arms sales to the mainland following the 1989 Tiananmen Square
Massacre.
</P>
<P>
In response to questions raised at a daily briefing regarding
whether it is fair to say Washington is ready to accept the European
position on the lifting of the embargo after Rice's meeting with
European leaders in Brussels, State Department Spokesman Richard
Boucher said: "No it's not."
</P>
<P>
"Secretary Rice made very clear in her discussions that the
United States doesn't think this is a good move for two reasons: One,
the human rights signal it might send, since political prisoners from
Tiananmen are still in jail; and two, the potential security problems
that such sales of European technology might entail, " he said.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the United States wants to keep talking with the E.U.
about the matter and will keep working on it with the E.U. to see if
both sides can find ways to deal with the issue, Boucher said: "We
have not changed our position. I don't think the secretary changed
her position during the course of the trip."
</P>
<P>
Asked whether the U.S. will participate or get involved if
European countries draft regulations before they lift the embargo,
the spokesman refused to speculate.

U.S. CONGRESSMEN VOICE OPPOSITION TO ANTI-SECESSION LAW
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Washington,  Feb.  12 (CNA)
(By Oliver Lin and P.C. Tang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Several members of U.S. House of
Representatives have voiced their opposition to mainland China's
proposed anti-secession law, saying that the law will not only
unilaterally change the status quo in the Taiwan Strait but will also
escalate military tension and endanger regional peace and stability.
</P>
<P>
They said the proposed law will also challenge the U.S.
determination to honor its commitment to the Taiwan Relations Act
(TRA) and urged Beijing not to enact such a law. They also called for
other free nations to jointly oppose the law.
</P>
<P>
The remarks of the representatives, including Dan Burton, Sherrod
Brown, Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, Peter T. King, Thomas G. Tancredo and
Heather Wilson, have been put on the congressional record.
</P>
<P>
According to Burton, the proposed anti-secession law, together
with the publication of a PRC white paper last year titled "China's
National Defense in 2004 " that calls Taiwan's independence the
"biggest immediate threat to China's sovereignty and territorial
integrity, " along with the prospect of a lifting of a European Union
arms embargo on the mainland, are alarming and represent a disturbing
trend in Beijing's attitude toward the situation in the Taiwan
Strait.
</P>
<P>
"If this anti-secession law is enacted, the response from the
Taiwanese will be predictable. Military tension will rise accordingly
in the Taiwan Strait and regional peace and stability will be
affected, " he said, adding that "this cannot be in the best
interests of any country, especially those in the region."
</P>
<P>
Pointing out that the proposed law is unnecessarily provocative
and will escalate tension in the Taiwan Strait as well as challenge
Washington's will to stand behind the TRA, Brown said that the
mainland is seeking to unilaterally change the status quo in the
strait and force its own style of government on the 23 million people
of Taiwan. He also said that the mainland has ignored Taiwan's
contributions to the mainland's strong economy, as well as Taiwan
President Chen Shui-bian's gestures of goodwill.
</P>
<P>
Saying that the freedom-loving people of Taiwan have reacted to
the proposed law with disappointment, Rose-Lehtinen noted that in a
recent public opinion poll, 70 percent of Taiwanese people opposed
the "anti-secession" law.
</P>
<P>
"I share the sentiments of the people of Taiwan and stand with
them in their zeal for freedom and liberty, " the representative
further said.
</P>
<P>
Condemning the proposed law, Tancredo said that Beijing is
feeling out the free world to determine its commitment to the safety
and security of Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
"I hope the family of free nations will condemn the
`anti-secession law' with a unified voice, making it clear to China
that any resolution of cross-strait tension must be peaceful and
above all acceptable to the people of Taiwan," he added.
</P>
<P>
Expressing his concern that the mainland might use the law to
make unilateral decisions to change the status quo of cross-strait
relations, Wilson said that the proposed law, if adopted, will not
foster an atmosphere favorable to cross-strait goodwill.
</P>
<P>
King expressed hope that the mainland will not enact an
anti-secession law or take any steps that might prompt a
confrontation in the Taiwan Strait.

<P>
Hsieh first visited the Fuokuanshan temple to a warm welcome from

during Chinese New Year.
</P>
<P>
Hsieh burned incense and prayed for prosperity for the nation and

<P>
The premier then went to the Kuanteh temple, where he received
teaching in Buddhism in 1998 from the temple's head, Master
Chinghsin.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the temple is currently building a nursing home for
the elderly, Hsieh also said that his Cabinet will step up care for
the elderly in rural areas and will try to persuade youngsters to
return to the countryside through education.
</P>
<P>
He said that more than 10 million out of the island's population
of 23 million live in rural areas, while younger people have moved to
urban areas, leaving the elderly behind without adequate care.

TSU HOPES TO GAIN IN YEAR-END LOCAL CHIEF ELECTIONS

<TEXT>
<P>
The opposition Taiwan Solidarity Union
(TSU) will try to strengthen its political base at the grassroots in
the hope of expanding its political landscape in year-end local chief
elections.
</P>
<P>
For the sake of the sustainable development of the party and to
avoid it disintegrating totally after the its poor performance in the
Dec. 11 legislative elections, the TSU has decided to make every
effort in the elections slated for late this year, the TSU officials
said.
</P>
<P>
The initial plan is to communicate with its ally, the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) and try to field TSU candidates in
between three and five cities and counties, the officials said.

</P>
<P>
The TSU fared worse than expected in the legislative elections,
garnering just 12 of the 225 seats, one fewer than in the previous
legislative election, prompting a bout of soul-searching in the
party.
</P>
<P>
The TSU's so-called "spiritual leader, " former President Lee
Teng-hui, as well as Huang Tsung-yuan, TSU caucus whip in the
legislature, discussed the party's direction after the December
elections.
</P>
<P>
Lee has offered to serve as the TSU's adviser, believing that the
TSU must strengthen its support base at the grassroots, pool the
strengths of its affiliate organizations -- think tank Taiwan
Advocates and the Lee Teng-hui School -- and hold regular seminars
to solicit more talent to prepare for the year-end elections.
</P>
<P>
Newly elected TSU Chairman Su Chin-chiang also said that the most
urgent task is to strengthen the party's support base, saying that as
a DPP ally, it will lend support to the government's policies but will
keep its own independent identity and will not be absent from the
year-end mayoral and magistrate elections.

KAOHSIUNG GRAVEL SHIP MISSING EN ROUTE TO JAPANESE ISLAND
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Feb. 13 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A ship carrying some 4,500 tons of gravel
with 18 crewmen aboard has reportedly gone missing in open seas after
it departed Taiwan's eastern harbor of Hualien the night of Feb. 10,
shipping industry sources said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The Kaohsiung-based gravel ship, the "Jui Tai No. 8, " departed
from Hualien Harbor en route to Ishigaki Island in Japan's Okinawa
Prefecture on the evening of Feb. 10. Of the 18 crewmen, 12 were
Taiwanese and six Indonesian and Burmese.
</P>
<P>
The 5,177-ton "Jui Tai No. 8" was last heard from at 7: 58 p.m.
on Feb. 10 when it reported its position -- about 17 nautical miles
away from Hualien Airport -- to Kaohsiung's Juipang Shipping Co.,
which owns the vessel.
</P>
<P>
Despite the fact that the ship was equipped with VHF radio as
well as a satellite telephone, Taiwan-based shipping officials have
been unable to raise the ship and no signal has been received, nor
has there been anything from the vessel's automatic distress beacon.
</P>
<P>
Officials speculate that the gravel ship may have encountered a
large wave that swamped it without warning.
</P>
<P>
The Jui Pang Shipping Co. asked the National Search and Rescue
Center for help on the morning of Feb. 12, about one day after the
agent on Ishigaki Island called the company to say that the "Jui Tai
No. 8" had not arrived as scheduled and that the agent had not
received any communication from the ship since Feb. 10.
</P>
<P>
One military search and rescue helicopter and six patrol vessels
from Taiwan's Coast Guard Administration scoured the gravel ship's
route for one day but found no trace of the ship and no evidence of
an oil slick that usually marks the spot where a ship has gone down.
</P>
<P>
A manager from the Jui Pang Shipping Co. said Sunday that the
"Jui Tai No. 8" had just undergone regular maintenance and overall
inspections in January and that the amount of gravel on board was
within safe carriage allowances.
</P>
<P>
The manager said that his company is still hoping that the
"Jui Tai No. 8" is safe and sound and has just suffered from
mechanical failure and is drifting in a position that does not allow
for communication.
</P>
<P>
The mysterious disappearance of the "Jui Tai No. 8" reminded
many officials of a similar incident involving another gravel ship,
the "Hualien No. 1," that vanished five years ago.
</P>
<P>
The two ships have a number of aspects in common, including that
both were transporting gravel, both departed from Hualien Harbor on a
dark February night in inclement weather and both vanished without a
trace and without any contact.
</P>
<P>
On Feb. 28, 2000, the "Hualien No. 1, " carrying 5,300 tons of
gravel, departed from Hualien Harbor en route to Taipei Harbor at
5:30 p.m. The ship had 21 crewmen aboard, including 14 Taiwanese and
seven Burmese.
</P>
<P>
Traveling at an estimated speed of 10 knots on a course that kept
it three to five nautical miles away from the coast, the ship was
scheduled to reach its destination at around 6 a.m. the next day,
but failed to arrive.
</P>
<P>
A team of professors from National Taiwan University's (NTU)
Institute of Oceanography claimed to have located the wreckage of the
"Hualien No. 1" off the coast of northern Taiwan in September 2003,
but subsequent investigations by the Coast Guard Administration have
been unable to confirm NTU's findings.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the "Jui Tai No. 8, " NTU Professor Sung Kuo-shih,
who took part in the effort to located the wreckage of the "Hualien
No. 1, " said that the "Jui Tai No. 8" probably met with the same
fate as that of the "Hualien No. 1"-- both vessels were hit by a
massive and unexpected wave that shifted the gravel in the hold,
resulting in a dangerous redistribution of weight which contributed
to the vessels' sinking.
</P>
<P>
Sung believes that the NTU team indeed found the "Hualien No. 1."
He said that sunken vessels usually can be spotted using sonar unless
they are below 3,000 meters.
</P>
<P>
The sea route that the "Jui Tai No. 8" was traveling, however,
has areas that are between 3,000 and 4,000 meters deep, Sung noted.

PREMIER REITERATES SERIOUSNESS IN PURSUING POLITICAL RECONCILIATION

<TEXT>
<P>
Premier Frank Hsieh reiterated Sunday that
he is serious in wanting to make peace among the various political
parties.
</P>
<P>
In a meeting with Master Cheng Yen, founder of the Buddhist
Compassionate Relief Tzu Chi Foundation, Taiwan's largest charitable
organization, located in Hualien, eastern Taiwan, Hsieh said that
political reconciliation will contribute to social stability and
domestic tranquility.
</P>
<P>
It is for this reason that since he was named premier by
President Chen Shui-bian last month he has been advocating that the
different parties put aside their differences, Hsieh said, adding
that he believes that fence-mending should be initiated by the top
officials of the government and that he is willing to take the first
step.
</P>
<P>
There will be no war in the Taiwan Strait if Taiwan maintains its
own stability and peace, the premier stressed.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Cheng Yen told the premier that a society
should be stable and peaceful and that catastrophes caused by people
are worse than natural disasters.
</P>
<P>
Citing what happened in Aceh, Indonesia as an example, Cheng Yen
said that the Dec. 26 tsunami destroyed 600 to 700 schools in the
Indonesian province, yet the conflict between the government's armed
forces and the rebels has so far destroyed more than 1,000 schools.
</P>
<P>
She praised Hsieh for his ability, wisdom and tenacity in serving
the people, saying that Hsieh should have no problems achieving his
aims.

<TEXT>
<P>
The 13th Taipei International Book
Exhibition (TIBE), sponsored by the Government Information Office, is
slated to open Feb. 15 at the Taipei World Trade Center (TWTC).
</P>
<P>
The annual event will feature a series of exhibitions and
discussions that reflect reading activities and trends in the
Asia-Pacific region, according to the organizer, the private Taipei
Book Fair Foundation.
</P>
<P>
During the book fair, two major reading trends will be
highlighted: "book art" and "digital publishing."
</P>
<P>
The TIBE 2005 will take place at three different TWTC halls, with
Hall I divided into five major sections -- international publishers
and their publications; general books; books of special interest; and
assorted magazines featuring business, finance, digital content,
popular culture and lifestyle.
</P>
<P>
Hall II will be dedicated to comic books to accommodate domestic
and foreign publishers, while Hall III will be devoted to children's
books and will include 400 booths displaying works from both Taiwan
and abroad, according to the organizer.
</P>
<P>
Halls I and III will be open only to professional visitors Feb.
15-16, but the public can take part in the activities in Hall II
throughout the event and in Halls I and III after the 16th. The show
will run until Feb. 20.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, to celebrate the book festival, two major chain
bookstore operators in Taiwan-- Eslite and Kingstone -- have already
launched "fun reading book fairs" at their 20 branches across the
island prior to the TIBE 2005 opening.
</P>
<P>
Taipei Book Fair Foundation Chairman Rex How said Sunday that the
bookstore activities, which began Feb. 1 and will run until Feb. 28,
are not only warm-ups for the exhibition but an effort to precis the
upcoming TIBE at bookstores around the country.
</P>
<P>
The effort is aimed at boosting a nationwide reading atmosphere,
How said, adding that he hopes those who live in townships and
villages outside of Taipei City and not able to visit the TIBE 2005
can still feel the book fair atmosphere and buy books with the same
discount that book fair visitors will enjoy.

<TEXT>
<P>
The 23rd quadrennial congress of the
International Council of Nurses (ICN) is scheduled to be held in
Taipei May 21-27 this year, ICN sources said in Geneva Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The 2005 Taipei ICN Congress is expected to be the largest NGO
activity ever been held in Taiwan. It will also mark a milestone for
Taiwan in its efforts to seek membership in the World Health
Organization (WHO) and secure recognition by the international
community, Swiss political observers said.
</P>
<P>
According to Linda Carrier-Walker, a spokesperson for the ICN, so
far some 3,000 people from 106 countries have registered to take part
in the Taipei ICN Congress. Carrier-Walker said she expects that more
than 5,000 people from around the world, including world-renowned
nursing professionals, authorities and representatives, will
ultimately sign up to go to Taipei for the world conference.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the Taiwan Nurses Association, which is a major
co-sponsor of the congress, the Republic of China's Ministry of
Foreign Affairs and the Department of Health will also pitch in as
supporting agencies to make the congress as successful as possible.
</P>
<P>
The Taipei ICN Congress will be divided into three parts: the ICN
conference of national representatives, May 21-23; the ICN general
assembly, May 23-27 -- both to be held at the Taipei International
Convention Center -- and an ICN exhibition to be held at the nearby
Taipei World Trade Center, May 21-27, according to Carrier-Walker.
</P>
<P>
The ICN was established in Geneva, Switzerland in 1899. There are
currently 125 member countries. The ICN is one of the three largest
medical organizations in the world besides the World Medical
Association and the International Pharmaceutical Federation. Among
the three, the ICN has the largest number of members.
</P>
<P>
These three organizations have been supportive of Taiwan's bid to
enter the World Health Assembly (WHA) , the decision-making body of
the WHO, as an observer, said Carrier-Walker, adding that pushing for
Taiwan's entry into the WHO is a fixed policy of the ICN.
</P>
<P>
With the theme of "Nursing on the Move: Knowledge, Innovation and
Vitality, " the 2005 Taipei ICN Congress will feature 80 symposiums
and seminars, as well as more than 400 meetings. A total of 1,400 out
of 2,500 papers submitted to the ICN have been approved and
recognized. Of the 1,400 papers, 800 will be displayed at the Taipei
World Trade Center during the congress, Carrier-Walker said.
</P>
<P>
Major topics to be mooted during the congress will include issues
regarding AIDS, malaria and pneumonia; nursing manpower, treatment,
work environments and mutual recognition agreements; and cutting-edge
techniques and facilities.
</P>
<P>
According to Carrier-Walker, there will be a debate between two
representatives from Australia and the United States during the ICN
general assembly on the issue of whether there should be legislation
on the ratio of the number of nurses to patients in a country.
Assembly participants will vote on this issue immediately after the
debate, she added.

CSBC EXPECTED TO COMPLETE PRIVATIZATION BY END OF 2005
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Feb.  13 (CNA)
(By Elizabeth Hsu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The state-operated Kaohsiung-based China
Shipbuilding Corporation (CSBC) is expected to finish privatization
by the end of 2005, according to a CSBC statement.
</P>
<P>
The statement said that since the company implemented a "rebirth"
project to adjust its enterprise structure and management on Dec. 31,
2001, it has seen operational surpluses. The CSBC's 2004 revenue was
NT$16.26 billion (US$512.13 million), with an accumulated surplus of
about NT$711 million, surpassing its compulsory target of NT$320
million, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the CSBC had 24 orders for new ships, with a total
value of the new contracts amounting to NT$30.89 billion, according
to company officials. As of Jan. 31, the total number of contracts
the state-run shipbuilder holds is 47, of which 41 are orders for new
container ships and six are for freighters.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to these deals, manufacturing at the two CSBC shipyards in
Keelung and Kaohsiung will run through 2009, the officials said,
noting that the busy schedule, which was partly caused by a recent
boost in the marine transportation market, will help with
privatization.
</P>
<P>
The CSBC has been working on a privatization plan and necessary
preparations. As soon as the plan is approved by the Executive Yuan,
the government-owned manufacturer will accept tenders, according to
CSBC officials.
</P>
<P>
The CSBC was established in July, 1973 as one of the 10 Major
Economic Construction Projects in Taiwan in a governmental effort to
promote economic development.
</P>
<P>
In 1978, the company acquired the Taiwan Shipbuilding Company,
becoming the leading shipbuilder on the island.

CROSS-STRAIT RELATIONS TO BE CENTERPIECE OF CHEN-SOONG TALKS: PFP
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Feb. 13 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Talks on cross-Taiwan Strait relations are
expected to be the centerpiece of a forthcoming meeting between
President Chen Shui-bian and opposition People First Party (PFP)
Chairman James Soong, a PFP spokesman said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
It is hoped that by talking about cross-strait affairs, the
government and the opposition PFP will deepen understanding of each
other and consequently reach the greatest possible consensus how to
resolve their differences, said PFP spokesman Hsieh Kung-ping.
</P>
<P>
The PFP hopes that Chen and Soong will also exchange views on a
cross-strait peace promotion draft law unveiled by the PFP last
October, Hsieh said, adding that the PFP remains open to all opinions
and arguments about the contents of the draft law, particularly the
part regarding the "1992 consensus" and a part that the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party has criticized as "a move that may
result in legislative intervention in administrative operations."
</P>
<P>
As to the date and venue of the Chen-Soong meeting, Hsieh said,
it is expected to be decided after Presidential Office
Secretary-General Yu Shyi-kun meets with PFP Secretary-General Chin
Chin-sheng on Monday.
</P>
<P>
"Anything can be discussed and the PFP has no preconditions to
the Chen-Soong meeting," Hsieh added.
</P>
<P>
Taipei media has reported that Chen will meet with Soong in an
attempt to effect a reconciliation between the ruling and opposition
parties. However, the date, venue and even the issues to be discussed
have not been decided upon.
</P>
<P>
President Chen will also meet with all opposition leaders,
according to an earlier statement by Yu, who said that apart from
Soong, Chen also hopes to meet with Kuomintang Chairman Lien Chan to

<P>
Reports have said that President Chen was irritated about the
proposed cross-strait peace promotion draft law, believing that it
would seriously infringe upon the rights of the president regarding
decision-making on cross-strait issues.
</P>
<P>
According to the draft law, a cross-strait peace consultation
special committee would be established that would have the right to
negotiate and consult with mainland authorities without the
authorization of the president.
</P>
<P>
Any cross-strait peace agreement signed by the committee and
approved by the Legislative Yuan would become effective if it were
approved by the public in a nationwide referendum. The resolutions
and suggested laws passed by the committee and approved by the
legislature would be binding for government agencies, according to
the draft law.

Today is Monday, Feb. 14, or the sixth day
of the first month of the Year of the Rooster according to the
lunar calendar. Following is a list of important events that have
occurred on this date in the past:

1766: Thomas R. Malthus, the British economist who wrote "An
Essay on the Principle of Population," is born. His 1798 work argues
that populations tend to increase faster than food supplies unless
the increase is checked by moral restraints or by war, famine, or
disease.

1779: Captain James Cook, the British navigator and explorer who
commanded three major voyages of "discovery," charting and "naming"
many islands in the Pacific Ocean, is killed by a native's spear in
Hawaii.

1797: British naval forces under Admiral John Jervis and Captain
Horatio Nelson defeat the Spanish fleet off Portugal's Cape St.

1933: The League of Nations refuses to recognize the Japanese
puppet regime known as "Manchukuo." To deflect world condemnation of
their hegemony, the Japanese invaders of northern China installed the
Manchukuo regime in 1932. This "land of the Manchu" proved to be no
more than another stepping stone for the extension of Japanese
aggression.

1939: The German battleship Bismarck is launched.

1950: The Chinese communist regime and the Soviet Union sign the
"Sino-Soviet Friendly Alliance and Mutual Assistance Treaty" in
Moscow.

1956: Soviet President Nikita Khrushchev denounces the policies

president of the Amman Chamber of Commerce, arrives in Taipei for a
weeklong visit.

1974: Commissioner W. Stanley Cottrill, international secretary
of the Salvation Army International Headquarters, leaves Taipei after
a three-day visit.

1975: The Marinas Islands in the Pacific becomes a territory of
the United States.

1977: Shih Wei-liang, a noted Republic of China musician, dies in
Taipei at the age of 54.

1989: Ayatollah Khomeini, Iran's religious leader, issues a
"fatwa," or death sentence, against British writer Salman Rushdie for
what he deemed to be blasphemy in the author's book "The Satanic
Verses," sending him into years of hiding.

1999: Former Nixon White House aide John Ehrlichman dies at the
age of 73. He served 18 months in prison for his role in the
Watergate cover-up.

2000: President Lee Teng-hui confers the Order of the Brilliant
Star with Grand Cordon on Cor Boonstra, president of Royal Philips
Electronics, in recognition of his company's contribution to Taiwan's
economic development.

2000: Democratic Progressive Party presidential candidate Chen
Shui-bian says that he will visit Beijing and invite mainland Chinese
leaders to visit Taipei if he wins the March 18 election.

without judgment leads to crime; uprightness without judgment makes
men tyrannical."

TAIPEI MAYOR LESS TIGHT-LIPPED ON RUNNING FOR KMT CHAIRMANSHIP
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Feb. 14 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou, who is also a
vice chairman of the opposition Kuomintang (KMT), said Monday that he
would like to "give it a try" when he was asked by reporters whether
he intends to run for the KMT chairmanship in May.
</P>
<P>
Ma was less tight-lipped on the issue following current KMT
Chairman Lien Chan's call Monday for party members considering vying
for the post to begin their preparations for the May election.
</P>
<P>
Lien's call indicated that he might not run for re-election,
despite the fact that a number of KMT heavyweights, including
Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng, who is also a KMT vice
chairman, have urged him to continue leading the main opposition
party which controls 79 seats in the 225-seat Legislative Yuan.
</P>
<P>
Ma said that he would like to "give it a try" as part of his
commitment to working for reform and unity of the KMT.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, other senior KMT members have begun a signature drive
in support of Wang to run for the KMT chairmanship.
</P>
<P>
Wang and Ma are considered by political observers as the two top
candidates to replace Lien Chan as chairman if he decides not to run
for re-election.
</P>
<P>
Neither Wang nor Ma has explicitly stated in public that they
want to run for the post, but political observers say that the two
have been sounding out the possibility in private.

GERMAN MINISTER'S CANCELLATION OF SCHEDULED TAIWAN VISIT CRITICIZED
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Berlin, feb. 13 (CNA)
(By Y.L. Lin and P.C. Tang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An influential German newspaper published a
commentary Sunday criticizing the German economics minister's
cancellation of a planned visit to Taiwan due to mainland China's
fierce opposition.
</P>
<P>
German Minister for Economic Affairs Wolfgang Clement has decided
not to visit Taiwan this year after the Chinese ambassador to Germany
told German Vice Minister for Economic Affairs Bernd Pfaffenbach last
week that Beijing will never tolerate any visit to Taiwan by a German
minister.
</P>
<P>
The Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung criticized Clement in the
commentary for apparently taking the Beijing envoy's words as an
order. The German daily argued that politicians cannot persuade
others if they follow orders from totalitarian regimes.
</P>
<P>
Regardless of the minister's diplomatic reasons for cancelling
the scheduled visit to Taiwan, his succumbing to pressure from
Beijing is a scandal, the newspaper claimed.
</P>
<P>
"Since when does Germany need envoys from other countries to
meddle in its economic policies?" it added.
</P>
<P>
While welcoming the benefits to the Chinese people of the
country's quick economic development, the newspaper argued that
market economies are based on the rule of law and can only really
become vigorous after democracy is established. It urged politicians
to look for opportunities to promote freedom and democracy.
</P>
<P>
During ROC Minister of Economic Affairs Ho Mei-Yueh's visit to
Germany last December, she extended an invitation to Clement to visit
Taiwan this year.
</P>
<P>
Although Taiwan and Germany have exchanged visits of high-ranking
economic officials over the years, the latest visit to Taiwan by a
German economics minister was in 1997.

TAIWAN URGED TO ACTIVELY TAKE PART IN CLEAN DEVELOPMENT MECHANISM
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Feb.  14 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taiwan was urged Monday to actively take
part in the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) under the Kyoto
Protocol on reducing greenhouse gas emissions.
</P>
<P>
Although Taiwan is not a signatory to the U.N.-initiated Kyoto
Protocol, the island will have to face the realities and global
demands for greenhouse gas emission reduction, according to professor
Lee Ho-ching of Chung Yuan Christian University in Taoyuan, northern
Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
The CDM is one of the protocol's two project-based flexible
mechanisms designed to make it easier and cheaper for industrialized
nations to meet greenhouse gas emission reduction targets agreed to
under the protocol, and to assist developing countries in achieving
sustainable development.
</P>
<P>
Lee, one of the founders of the Taiwan Climate Protection
Coalition, called for the Taiwan government to aggressively seek
participation in the less political CDM engagements, which she said
will not only help Taiwan to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and
secure sustainable development, but also help the island to take part
in bankable projects in developing countries and gain great earnings
expected to be generated from greenhouse gas reduction options.
</P>
<P>
With the Kyoto Protocol set to enter into force Feb. 16,
governments and companies that will have to curb their emissions in
compliance with their countries' caps are scrambling to figure out
how to do so without killing their bottom lines.
</P>
<P>
One of the best policies to deal with the issue is to cooperate
with developing countries, either by helping them reduce greenhouse
gas emissions or by buying their greenhouse gas emission "quotas, "
according to National Taiwan University professor Liu Chung-ming.
</P>
<P>
Liu noted the World Bank has estimated that under the CDM
operations, some US$10 billion in funds will flow into developing
countries a year.
</P>
<P>
Of that total, about 70 percent will be directed into mainland
China. This will provide Taiwan with a golden opportunity to cash in
on the huge market by investing or partaking in bankable CDM projects
in China, given Taiwan's cultural, language and geographic
advantages, Liu added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Tunghai University professor Yenwen Peng, who is also
a spokeswoman for the Green Party Taiwan, said that Taiwan may end up
facing trade sanctions if it doesn't step up its greenhouse gas
reduction efforts.
</P>
<P>
Peng said that Taiwan releases some 2.39 million tons of carbon
dioxide into the air each year, or about 1 percent of the global
total, ranking the island 22nd in the world.
</P>
<P>
If stronger measures are not taken, Taiwan's greenhouse gas
emissions will rise to some 4.61 million tons a year by 2020, Peng
warned.

Iraqi Shiites Win, but Margin Is Less Than
Projection

A broad Shiite alliance led by two
Iran-backed religious parties won a slim
majority of seats in the national assembly,
final election results showed Sunday.
The alliance's victory - in the first fully
elected parliament in Iraq's 85-year history as a

had projected and set the stage for protracted 
maneuvering. 

Wall Street Journal: Global Warming; In
Climate Debate, The 'Hockey Stick' Leads to a
Face-Off

One of the pillars of the case for man-made
global warming is a graph nicknamed the hockey 
stick. It's a reconstruction of temperatures over
the past 1,000 years based on records captured in
tree rings, corals and other markers. The stick's
shaft shows temperatures oscillating slightly 
over the ages. Then comes the blade: The 
mercury swings sharply upward in the 20th 
century. Since it was published four years ago
in a United Nations report, hundreds of
environmentalists, scientists and policy makers
have used the hockey stick in presentations and
brochures to make the case that human activity
in the industrial era is causing dangerous
global warming. But according to a semiretired
Toronto minerals consultant Stephen McIntyre,
who has spent two years and about US$5,000 of
his own money trying to double-check the
influential graphic, he says he has found
significant oversights and errors. He claims its
lead author, climatologist Michael Mann of the
University of Virginia, and colleagues used
flawed methods that yield meaningless results.

'ANTI-SECESSION LAW' COULD EQUAL 'RED TERROR' FOR TAIWANESE: MAC
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Feb.  14 (CNA)
(By P.C. Tang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If mainland China enacts its proposed
"anti-secession law, " it could signal the beginning of "red terror"
for Taiwan citizens working or traveling in mainland China, the
Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) said recently.
</P>
<P>
The Standing Committee of the Chinese National People's Congress
adopted a draft of the proposed law last December. The draft will be
reviewed at the congress' plenary meeting next month.
</P>
<P>
Facing this situation, MAC Vice Chairman Chiu Tai-san said that
the government must voice its opposition to the proposed law and this
is the reason why the government gave a clear explanation about the
matter to the public before the beginning of the Chinese Lunar New
Year holiday.
</P>
<P>
The MAC said that the proposed law is a mainland Chinese domestic
one and that should it pass, it would be a "red terror" for mainland
China-based Taiwanese business people, Taiwanese tourists and
students, and even multi-national enterprises. Moreover, it would be
harmful to normal cross-strait exchanges and activities, the
council claimed, adding that peace and stability could be
compromised.
</P>
<P>
It is mainland China's intention, the MAC said, to use
"anti-secession" to mean that the current cross-strait status quo
should be "unified" rather than "individual, " which is contradictory
to the fact that neither side of the Taiwan Strait is subordinate to
the other.
</P>
<P>
It said that Beijing's intention of becoming the dominate force
in the Taiwan Strait by enacting the "anti-secession law" totally
neglects the international community's understanding of the
cross-strait situation.
</P>
<P>
Noting that under the proposed law, the only option for future
cross-strait relations is "unification, " the council said it can
also be regarded as a "law for war" and could be interpreted as a
justification for military action to solve the "Taiwan issue."
</P>
<P>
Reiterating that an MAC survey released last December showed that
83 percent of Taiwan people who responded were opposed to mainland
China's proposed "anti-secession law, " the council said that peace
and stability in the Taiwan Strait are not only the wish of those on
Taiwan, but also the wish of the international community.
</P>
<P>
The council also said that the government will continue to push
for the establishment of a "cross-strait peace and stability
interaction framework, " as well as further explaining Taiwan's
position to the international community to enlist their support so
that Beijing stops its attempt to destroy regional peace and
stability.

The Washington Post: After Bush
Leaves Office, His Budget's Costs Balloon.

For President Bush, the budget sent to Congress last week
outlines a painful path to meeting his promise to bring down the
federal budget deficit by the time he leaves office in 2009. But for
the senators and governors already jockeying to succeed him, the
numbers released in recent days add up to a budgetary landmine that
could blow up just as the next president moves into the Oval Office.

MAYOR MA THROWS HIS HAT INTO THE RING FOR KMT CHAIRMAN
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Feb.  14 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou, who had been
reticent about announcing whether he would run for the chairmanship
of the Kuomingtang (KMT), said Monday that he would "give it a try"
in the May election.
</P>
<P>
Asked if he was willing to compete against another possible
strong contender, Legislative Yuan Speaker and KMT Vice Chairman,
Wang Jin-pyng, for the party's top post, Ma said, "Certainly."
</P>
<P>
Faced with some within the party who want Lien to stay on for
another term and those who support Wang, Ma, who is also a KMT vice
chairman, said the election will be held in an open and direct way,
and anyone who qualifies will be able to compete.
</P>
<P>
For Wang's part, he said that he "wished Ma the best" in the
election, but stopped short of saying whether he would support Ma's
bid.
</P>
<P>
Wang reaffirmed that "his own intention is clear, " which is to
support Lien for another term, if that is his desire.
</P>
<P>
However, KMT Chairman Lien Chan reiterated Monday in a statement
that the party continues to advocate gradually turning over the KMT
to the next generation of politicians.
</P>
<P>
Lien, who is currently traveling overseas, made the remarks in
his message to a gathering of KMT members at the end of the Chinese
Lunar New Year holiday. Vice KMT Chairman Vincent Siew presided.
</P>
<P>
Lien urged all aspirants within the party to come forward to
solicit nominations, adding that the KMT can use its high-profile
members to help bring about progress within the party as well as to
aid the development of the nation.
</P>
<P>
Lien did not say, however, whether he would follow through with 
his earlier remarks that he would really not seek re-election to the
post of chairman.
</P>
<P>
Wang was asked by reporters if he will run for KMT chairman if
Lien has no wish to stay on, to which he replied: "It is better not
to talk about the 'if' question."
</P>
<P>
Regarding Ma's bid, two popular KMT politicians said that they
wish the best to come forward through the party's open and democratic
election mechanism.
</P>
<P>
Taichung Mayor Jason Hu said that aspirants for the party
chairman must follow the democratic mechanism within the party, and
that the more important thing is the person must be able to bring
solidarity and lead the KMT to once again become the ruling party.
</P>
<P>
"Anyone who can meet these conditions will get my support, " Hu
said.
</P>
<P>
He also expressed the hope that the party chairman election will
be a gentlemen's battle, and there will be no pre-designated person
for the party's top post.
</P>
<P>
Taoyuan County Magistrate Chu Li-lun lauded Ma for being an elite
within the party, and dubbed him "the best choice."
</P>
<P>
Chu also said that he hoped that KMT party members can come in
droves to elect their leader in a "just, fair, and open" way.
</P>
<P>
On bids by other aspirants for the post, Chu said that it will be
a good thing if many take part in the election, but he hoped that the
election can be conducted in a harmonious atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
An official of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party said that
the party will give "best wishes and respect" to any aspirants for
KMT chairman.

PRESIDENT CHEN HAS HIGH EXPECTATIONS OF MEETING WITH PFP CHIEF
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Feb. 14 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President Chen Shui-bian said Monday he is
confident that his upcoming meeting with opposition People First
Party (PFP) Chairman James Soong will be able to lay a good
foundation for inter-party reconciliation and cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a Presidential Office lunar new year gathering, Chen
said his chief of staff, Yu Shyi-kun, has contacted PFP
Secretary-General Chin Chin-sheng to arrange the meeting.
</P>
<P>
"We all have high expectations for the upcoming meeting, " Chen
said, adding that he believes the meeting will be able to help put an
end to hostile relations between the ruling and opposition camps and
usher in a new era of inter-party reconciliation and cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Chen further said he hopes the spirit of reconciliation and
cooperation can be extended from the domestic arena to relations
across the Taiwan Strait.
</P>
<P>
"Inter-party reconciliation, national unity, cross-strait peace,
economic prosperity and social stability are my first wishes for the
new year of the rooster," Chen said.
</P>
<P>
Over the past year, Chen said, hostile political wrangling
between the ruling and opposition camps has taken toll on national
development.
</P>
<P>
"Now is the time for us to end all internal rifts and stand
united to promote peaceful cross-strait development and domestic
economic growth," Chen said.
</P>
<P>
If political parties cannot reconcile and cooperate, Chen said
Taiwan would be unable to engage mainland China and push for a thaw
in cross-strait ties.
</P>
<P>
"I attach great importance to the upcoming meeting with Soong. I
hope all people and parties can pool their wisdom and resources to
help turn a new page in our nation's political development, " Chen
urged.
</P>
<P>
In the year of the rooster, Chen said he also hopes that Taiwan's
democratic reforms can be further deepened and consolidated,
particularly in crime-fighting, national health insurance renovation,
tax system reform, government restructuring and constitutional
re-engineering.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Chen said he looks forward to seeing the "Taiwan first"
and "Taiwan identity" policy line continue moving forward smoothly
and even more swiftly. "This is a common dream of most local people.
Let's all weave the dream together, pursue the dream and realize the
dream," he added.
</P>
<P>
Touching on cross-strait affairs, Chen said he doesn't rule out
any possibility for inter-party cooperation.
</P>
<P>
"The most important thing at the moment is that ruling and
opposition parties sit down to talk and forge a consensus on measures
to resume cross-strait dialogue and boost cross-strait rapprochement.
"If necessary, I don't reject the proposal to legislate a law on how
to promote cross-strait peace," Chen said.
</P>
<P>
He was referring to the PFP-proposed cross-strait peace promotion
bill that is pending legislative approval.
</P>
<P>
In his view, Chen said, a cross-party commission should be formed
first to work out a package of guidelines for promoting peaceful
cross-strait development. "I keenly hope that opposition party
leaders can play an active role in the formulation of new
cross-strait working guidelines," he added.

The new chairman of the opposition Taiwan

this year.
</P>
<P>

cities and counties around the island, as well as township
representative elections.
</P>
<P>
Speaking of the recent inter-party activities regarding political
reconciliation, the TSU leader said his party is looking forward to
forming party-to-party cooperation so long as it is promoted to do
the country good, not just political horse-trading.

<P>
All executive TSU members and those serving the central and local
governments gathered at the party headquarters on the first working
day after the Chinese Lunar New Year holiday to greet the year of the
rooster. During the festive activity, Su also made a wish that the

The Times: Charities struggle to spend cash
for tsunami.

British charities admitted last night that they would struggle to
spend the vast sums of money donated by the public to victims of the
Asian tsunami. More than £365 million has been raised in individual
donations to tsunami relief in the six weeks since the Boxing Day
disaster. More than 85 per cent of British adults have given
something. But the British Red Cross has told The Times that it may
have difficulty responsibly spending the £60 million raised so far
and is considering whether it can divert some money to other causes.
At least two other large British charities have privately admitted
that they will have difficulty in allocating all the money received.
However the charities fear that saying so publicly would result in a
belief that they did not need donations in the future.

Financial Times: Blair tries to rebuild relations with public.

Tony Blair confessed on Sunday that he had often appeared
arrogant in a candid mea culpa which marked his most concerted
attempt to reconnect with the British public after the Iraq war. The
prime minister used his keynote speech at Labour's spring conference
in Gateshead to acknowledge it was largely his fault that his bond
with the public had frayed.

MOST OF TAIWAN'S YOUNG OFFICE WORKERS UNWILLING TO GET MARRIED: POLL
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Feb.  14 (CNA)
(By Huang Kwang-chun)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
More than 60 percent of Taiwan's young
office workers are unwilling to get married or have babies, according
to the results of a poll released Monday.
</P>
<P>
The poll, conducted by the online human resources service company
www.9999.com.tw from Jan. 15 to Feb. 6, shows that 62.27 percent of
the respondents aged between 18 and 30 said they are unwilling to get
married, against 37.73 percent who said they would like to get
married.
</P>
<P>
The reason most cited by those who do not want to get married is
the limitations imposed by marriage on their lives, at 68.86 percent
of the respondents, followed by lack of money, unwillingness to have
complicated family relations and to "permanently enjoy the feeling of
falling in love."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, 74.51 percent of the respondents said they do not want
to have children, against 25.49 percent who said they would like to.
</P>
<P>
Not having sufficient money to raise a child was the reason most
cited by those who do not want to have babies, at 61.33 percent of
the total, followed by maintaining the quality of life and the idea
that "children are no fun."
</P>
<P>
Yang Ken-cheng, chief operations officer of the online company,
ascribed the mentality demonstrated by the so-called F generation
toward marriage to the lack of upward adjustment of salaries for
young office workers over the past several years.
</P>
<P>
Also, he added, the F generation office workers pay relatively
more attention to the quality of their personal lives, while giving
less importance to the continuance of their family lines.
</P>
<P>
The survey collected a total of 13,707 samples with an error
margin of 0.8 percent.

GIO HEAD FAVORS SETTING UP NATIONAL COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,   Feb.  14  (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Government Information Office (GIO)
Director-General Lin Chia-lung said Monday that he favors setting up
a national communications commission (NCC) in line with the
Constitution, with its members appointed by the premier and approved
by the legislature.
</P>
<P>
Lin made the remarks to reporters in central Taiwan's Taichung
City.
</P>
<P>
Lin said he is opposed to a draft bill forwarded by the
opposition Kuomintang (KMT) and People First Party (PFP) in January
and called their version unconstitutional in that NCC members would
be named by party representatives based on a proportional
representation system.
</P>
<P>
Lin made it clear that he is in favor of establishing an NCC as
soon as possible, but pointed out that the KMT-PFP bill is not
congruent with the public mandate that political parties and the
military should quit the media.
</P>
<P>
According to the GIO chief, the ruling Democratic Progressive
Party (DPP) should do its best to conduct inter-party negotiations
and push for the early passage of a bill that is in line with
constitutional requirements.
</P>
<P>
If the two opposition parties try to press for the passage of
their unconstitutional bill in the Legislative Yuan, it would bring a
follow-on effect in the form of "numerous boycotts," he warned.
</P>
<P>
The governing DPP controls the largest number of 89 seats in the
225-member legislature, followed by the KMT with 79 and the PFP with
34 seats.
</P>
<P>
However, as the "pan-green alliance" of the DPP and its ally, the
Taiwan Solidarity Union, failed to secure an overall majority in last
year's Dec. 11 legislative elections, it is still finding it
difficult to push its bills through the legislature.

OFFICIALS TO MEET TO ARRANGE MEETING BETWEEN PRESIDENT, PFP HEAD
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Feb. 14 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President Chen Shui-bian's chief of staff
will meet with opposition People First Party (PFP) Secretary-General
Chin Chin-sheng Friday to set the stage for a meeting between Chen
and PFP Chairman James Soong, party sources said Monday.
</P>
<P>
PFP spokesman Hsieh Kung-ping said Yu Shyi-kun, secretary-general
to the president, telephoned Chin earlier in the day to discuss
preparatory work for the much-anticipated Chen-Soong meeting.
</P>
<P>
Yu and Chin agreed to meet Friday at the Taipei Guest House, a
government-owned estate near the Presidential Office, to work out
technical details for the meeting, including the date, venue, format
and agenda, Hsieh said.
</P>
<P>
According to Hsieh, neither side has any prerequisites or preset
stances on the Chen-Soong meeting.
</P>
<P>
"Our party hopes the upcoming high-level inter-party rendezvous
will address a PFP-proposed bill on promotion of peaceful development
across the Taiwan Strait. The bill is pending legislative approval.
Our primary goal is to create a mechanism for peaceful cross-strait
interaction based on the core values agreed by both the ruling and
opposition parties, " Hsieh explained, adding that the PFP has no
intention of usurping the president's power in dealing with
cross-strait engagements.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Soong said at a PFP Lunar New Year party that he is
willing to meet with Chen mainly because the PFP wants to assist the
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) administration in seeking a
breakthrough to the deadlocked cross-strait relations.
</P>
<P>
"Cross-strait issues are closely related to domestic political,
economic and social developments. We cannot afford to ignore them. As
an opposition party, the PFP can do little in pushing for
cross-strait peaceful development. Therefore, we hope to cooperate
with the DPP administration to realize our ambitious goal of ensuring
permanent cross-strait peace," Soong said.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Soong went on, the PFP will never compromise on its
stance against Taiwan independence simply in order to cooperate with
the pro-independence DPP.
</P>
<P>
"Taiwan independence is never a PFP option. We believe that
pursuing independence will bring infinite disaster to Taiwan.
Independence is no solution to the cross-strait issue. The PFP
insists that the two sides of the Taiwan Strait must use
peaceful, non-violent, non-military means to resolve their
disputes. Pro-independence rhetoric and action are
counterproductive to cross-strait ties," Soong said.
</P>
<P>
Noting that rancorous political wrangling between the ruling and
opposition camps over the past few years has undermined Taiwan's
development, Soong said the PFP is willing to work for inter-party
reconciliation and cooperation for the sake of national interests and
the people's well-being.
</P>
<P>
He further stressed that the PFP will not seek horse-trading with
the DPP.
</P>
<P>
"We will not seek any posts. What we really care about is
assisting the DPP in promoting ethnic harmony, political
transparency, inter-party cooperation and cross-strait peace," Soong
said.
</P>
<P>
Previous media reports said Chen might name Soong to serve as
chairman of the quasi-official Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) ,
which is authorized to handle cross-strait engagements in the absence
of official ties. However, PFP sources said Soong is not interested
in taking over the post that has been left vacant since the death of
former SEF Chairman Koo Chen-fu early this year.
</P>
<P>
Unless the DPP drops its pro-independence party platform, the
sources said, Beijing is unlikely to engage the DPP administration.
Under such circumstances, the sources said, accepting Chen's offer to
be SEF chairman would only hinder Soong from playing a more active
and constructive role in promoting cross-strait rapprochement.

TAIWAN TO UPGRADE ENERGY EFFICIENCY IN VIEW OF KYOTO PROTOCOL
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Industrial Development Bureau (IDB)
under the Ministry of Economic Affairs will help domestic industries
upgrade their energy efficiency while also studying the feasibility
of international cooperation to cut greenhouse gas emissions, IDB
officials said Monday.
</P>
<P>
The officials made the remarks in view of the Kyoto Protocol,
which will come into force Wednesday, putting limits on greenhouse
gas emissions.
</P>
<P>
The officials said that Taiwan will work in line with the
international trend of environmental protection as a citizen of the
global community, but will also take into consideration the needs of
its industrial development with the official start of the Kyoto
Protocol.
</P>
<P>
The officials said they will work on a multi-prong approach to
cut greenhouse gas emissions. The government will lead industry in
structural adjustments and step up the promotion of new sectors that
rely less on energy consumption, such as the information service and
cultural and creativity industries, by providing them with tax and
financial incentives.
</P>
<P>
The bureau will also help manufacturers cut their greenhouse gas
emissions in an economically viable way. Major investment projects in
volving large amounts of greenhouse gas emissions will undergo streng
thened energy efficiency screening, they said.
</P>
<P>
The IDB also will help manufacturers examine greenhouse gas
emissions and will establish an emission databank. On the other hand,
the bureau will also help high energy-consuming industries to
implement "clean production," they added.
</P>
<P>
The IDB will also provide economic incentives to encourage
industries to introduce or develop technology or equipment that can
cut greenhouse gas emissions, and adopt production procedures that
will cut energy use and greenhouse gas emissions.
</P>
<P>
The bureau will also study ways to introduce recycling of carbon
dioxide and will explore the possibility of international cooperation
to cut the emissions of carbon dioxide.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the bureau will launch a campaign to promote the
importance of the Kyoto Protocol among domestic manufacturers, and to
let the international community understand Taiwan's efforts in this
regard.

POLICY DISCUSSION SHOULD COME BEFORE NAMING KMT VICE PREMIER: KMT
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei, Feb. 14 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The opposition Kuomintang (KMT) said Monday
that the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) should discuss key
policies with the party before talking about inviting a KMT vice
chairman to serve as vice premier.
</P>
<P>
Chang Jung-kung, a KMT spokesman, made the remarks in response to
an invitation from Premier Frank Hsieh to P.K. Chiang to serve his
deputy. Hsieh has expressed the hope that the KMT will give a
goodwill response on the matter by Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Chang noted that before Hsieh assumed office Feb. 1, he said he
would talk about policy first before filling his Cabinet posts.
</P>
<P>
If Hsieh wants to invite Chiang and make good use of his rich
experience, especially in the economic field, then both sides should
talk about policy first, said Chang.
</P>
<P>
The KMT is willing to talk with the DPP about major issues, such
as the orientation of the nation, cross-Taiwan Strait direct trade,
postal and transportation links, and the construction of the fourth
nuclear power plant, he said.
</P>
<P>
Chang said that all major issues should be sorted out so that
they will not be manipulated later to undermine the trust between the
ruling and the opposition parties, further affecting national
stability.
</P>
<P>
Chiang earlier this month turned down Hsieh's offer, saying that
any such appointment should have been arranged through party-to-party
negotiations before the new Cabinet was formed and that it would be
meaningless for him to enter the Cabinet as an individual who enjoys
no support or endorsement from his party.
</P>
<P>
Chiang stressed that if the DPP intends to recruit any opposition
members to join the Cabinet, it must negotiate with the concerned
party for a party-to-party agreement, which he said would be a symbol
of ruling and opposition cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Otherwise, Chiang said, the same old story will be repeated.
Former Premier Tang Fei, who accepted President Chen Shui-bian's
appointment in 2000 without the KMT's blessing, was forced to step
down just a few months later over a disagreement with the DPP about
the fourth nuclear power plant.

PREMIER SETS `4-NO-INCREASES PRINCIPLE' FOR HEALTH INSURANCE REFORM
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,   Feb.   14  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Premier Frank Hsieh has set a
"four-no-increases principle" for a transitional reformation of the
national health insurance program aimed at preventing the debt-ridden
system from bankruptcy, Cabinet spokesman Cho Jung-tai said Monday.
</P>
<P>
According to Cho, Hsieh issued the directive during a meeting
with Department of Health (DOH) Minister Wang Hsiu-hung, DOH Vice
Minister Hou Sheng-mao and Minister-without-Portfolio Fu Li-yeh.
</P>
<P>
It was decided during the meeting that future health insurance
reforms will be carried out in the form of "dynamic adjustments," Cho
said.
</P>
<P>
With a view to winning more public support for a proposed
transitional reformation of the cash-strapped national health
insurance program, Cho said, the premier outlined his principle,
which means no increase in the basic insurance premiums; no increase
in the self-payment rate for patients whose monthly salary falls
below NT$87,600; no increase in the self-payment rate for patients
with serious diseases; and no increase in the self-payment rate for
chronic disease patients.
</P>
<P>
In a bid to plug the health insurance program's gaping deficits,
the DOH has floated plans to add a new bracket to the current system
that determines an individual's contribution to the program in terms
of his or her monthly salary. At present, the top bracket is capped
at NT$87,600 per month. Under the DOH-proposed plan, the new top
bracket will be capped at NT$130,000 per month by the end of
February. Should this proposal be adopted, it is expected to generate
additional revenue of NT$1.3 billion per year.
</P>
<P>
Cho said the Cabinet will make a final decision at its regular
weekly meeting Feb. 23 on whether this short-term or transitional
reform measure will be adopted, as well as on how to curb the
wasteful use of medical resources and which laws or regulations
should be revised to improve the national health insurance program.
</P>
<P>
During Monday's meeting, Cho said Hsieh also announced five
measures to avoid waste of medical resources: using smart IC health
insurance card information to check on those who frequently visit
hospitals; avoiding repeated physical checkups; tightly monitoring
pharmaceutical prices to narrow price gaps; stepping up
investigations into violations of health insurance rules by hospitals
and clinics; intensifying publicity campaigns to instill in local
people the knowledge of correct medication and when to visit
hospitals.
</P>
<P>
Cho said Hsieh will also make an inspection tour of major medical
facilities to see for himself the health insurance system in
practice.

DOMESTIC RECONCILIATION WOULD PROMOTE CROSS-STRAIT PEACE COMMITTEE
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
(By Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Taipei, Feb. 14 (CAN) An atmosphere of reconciliation between the
ruling and opposition parties would be favorable to the promotion of
a cross-Taiwan Strait peaceful development committee, Taiwan's top
mainland China policy charter said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Joseph Wu, chairman of the Mainland Affairs Council (MAC), made
the remarks as arrangements were being made on a series of meetings
between the ruling and opposition party leaders.
</P>
<P>
The meetings will be conducive to reconciliation between the
ruling and the opposition parties, Wu said, claiming that this in
turn will help promote a peaceful and stable exchange framework
between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait and the establishment of
a cross-strait peaceful development committee.
</P>
<P>
Wu noted that the committee's establishment is a key policy
promoted by President Chen Shui-bian after winning his re-election
bid last year.
</P>
<P>
Looking ahead, Wu said that although cross-strait relations
seemed to ease at the end of last year, a proposed "anti-secession
law" by mainland China that will be put to review and approval in the
rubber-stamp National People's Congress in March, still cast a long
shadow over cross-strait relations.
</P>
<P>
If it is enacted into law, it will definitely impact the
government's promotion of a more eased cross-strait policy, Wu said.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that "China will forego the legislation of
the anti-secession law in consideration of the response of the
international community and the views of the Taiwan people. "
</P>
<P>
On whether the government will step up the promotion of
cross-strait cargo charter flights, MAC Vice Chairman Chiu Tai-san
said that it is still too early to talk about the matter.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the cross-strait Chinese New Year charter flights
for Taiwan businessmen operating on the mainland are still underway
and said the MAC will have to wait for related government agencies to
give their reports after the services end Feb. 20 before it can
assess when to promote cross-strait cargo charter flights.
</P>
<P>
Chiu said the promotion of cross-strait cargo charter flights
will require the willingness of both sides and that even if there is
willingness, they cannot be promoted immediately.
</P>
<P>
"The more important thing is the cross-strait atmosphere. When
the atmosphere is right, both sides will promote the matter, " he
said.

ANTI-SECESSION LAW COUNTERPRODUCTIVE TO CROSS-STRAIT PEACE: MINISTER
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Feb.  14 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Both the United States and the European
Union think mainland China's planned anti-secession legislation is
counterproductive to peace across the Taiwan Strait, Minister of
Foreign Affairs Tan Sun Chen said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Chen made the remarks after presiding over a Lunar New Year
gathering at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) auditorium.
</P>
<P>
He said the government sent six delegations to the United States,
Japan and EU countries last year to brief officials, academics and
opinion leaders on the adverse impact on cross-strait relations of
Beijing's planned anti-secession law, which targets Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
The MOFA has also instructed embassies and representative offices
abroad to express to their host governments Taiwan's opposition to
the proposed legislation, Chen said.
</P>
<P>
The mainland's rubber-stamp parliament -- the National People's
Congress -- is scheduled to screen the so-called anti-secession law
in March. Chen said such a move could draw a backlash and protests
from the people of Taiwan and could hinder cross-strait
rapprochement.

DPP HOPES CHEN-SOONG MEETING CAN PAVE WAY FOR PASSAGE OF MAJOR BILLS
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei, Feb. 14 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The legislative caucus of the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) looks forward to seeing the
upcoming meeting between President Chen Shui-bian and opposition
People First Party (PFP) Chairman James Soong can contribute to the
passage of major bills related to people's livelihoods, a party whip
said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Legislator Lai Ching-teh, who concurrently serves as
secretary-general of the DPP legislative caucus, made the remarks
after the Presidential Office announced that Chen's chief of staff,
Yu Shyi-kun, will meet with PFP Secretary-General Chin Chin-sheng
Friday to set the stage for the much-anticipated Chen-Soong meeting.
</P>
<P>
In addition to addressing issues related to cross-Taiwan Strait
relations, Lai said he hopes the Chen-Soong meeting will pave the
way for the passage of major bills in the opposition-controlled
Legislative Yuan to facilitate sweeping domestic reforms.
</P>
<P>
"Many critical bills have been pending legislative approval for
a long time. We hope the Chen-Soong meeting can contribute to a
speedy passage of those bills, including those related to judicial
reform and reformation of the national health insurance system," Lai
said.
</P>
<P>
Through a telephone conversation, Yu and Chin agreed to meet
Friday at the Taipei Guest House, a government-owned estate near the
Presidential Office, to work out technical details for the
Chen-Soong meeting, including the date, venue, format and agenda, the
Presidential Office said Monday evening. There will be no limits on
the topics to be discussed during the Yu-Chin meeting, a spokesman
said.

KMT, PFP MAY FACE SHOWDOWN IN YEAR-END ELECTIONS
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei, Feb. 14 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Although the opposition "pan-blue alliance"
secured a majority in the legislature after last December's
elections, the Kuomintang (KMT) and the People First Party (PFP) are
very likely to face a showdown in the magistrate and mayor elections
slated for the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said that the two allied parties are very likely to be
competing with each other in the elections, including those for
Taipei and Kaohsiung mayors and magistrates, should they fail to
agree to a joint election strategy as they did in last year's
legislative polls.
</P>
<P>
If the PFP refuses to cooperate with the KMT in the coming
elections, such a development would drive both into a very difficult
situation in the face of strong competition from the "pan-green camp"
of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) and the Taiwan
Solidarity Union, they said.
</P>
<P>
Given that the voter ratio for the "pan-blue alliance" and the
"pan-green camp" is about 55 percent to 45 percent, they said that a
split between the KMT and PFP will make it extremely hard for both to
perform well in the year-end magistrate and mayor elections.
</P>
<P>
Whether or not the two parties will continue to cooperate or seek
backing from other forces will be a test of wisdom for their leaders
and mutual trust will be indispensable in any coming two-way
cooperation, they said, noting the PFP's attitude will be the key due
to its crucial importance as the third largest party in the
Legislative Yuan.
</P>
<P>
The PFP controls 34 seats in the 225-member legislature, lagging
behind the ruling DPP's 89 seats and the main opposition KMT's 79
seats in the sixth Legislative Yuan, which opened Feb. 1.
</P>
<P>
But the chances of KMT-PFP cooperation in the coming elections
appear to be very slim, as PFP Chairman James Soong has repeatedly
said in recent months that the party will "walk its own way" for the
welfare and benefit of the Taiwan people. The meaning of the PFP's
existence is now to help the DPP adopt a middle road and push the KMT
to step up reform, Soong has said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the PFP seems to have kicked off efforts to cement its
power base at the grassroots level, evident in that it has already
started preparations for the magistrate and mayor elections in
various administrative areas where it stands a good chance, including
Taipei County, Keelung City and Changhua County, regardless of the
KMT, observers said.
</P>
<P>
For the time being, the PFP plans to field hopefuls to run in
five or six cities and counties. Once the candidates are decided, the
PFP will hold on to the end and will never yield to outside pressure
from the KMT, party officials said, adding that Soong hopes to foster
greater affinity for the PFP among the rank and file through the
year-end elections for the party's long-term development.
</P>
<P>
To serve that end, the party will name candidates with strong
popular backing to run, such as Legislator Chou Hsi-wei for Taipei
County magistrate, legislative caucus whip Liu Wen-hsiung for Keelung
mayor and former lawmaker Hsieh Chang-chieh for Changhua magistrate,
party officials said.
</P>
<P>
They stressed that PFP candidates will not be absent for a second
time in the magistrate and mayor elections in the various key areas
and claimed that they are confident of winning the race despite
competition from the KMT.
</P>
<P>
According to the PFP officials, it is good for party lawmakers to
take part in popular elections, as most of them have no
administrative experience. It will also be a good thing for the
party, which they said is keely hoping to foster younger generations.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the KMT is scheduled to put forth a candidate
list in May or June before conducting negotiations with the PFP. By
August at the latest, the KMT will have decided upon all its
candidates in every electoral area.
</P>
<P>
At present, incumbent KMT magistrates and mayors, including
Keelung Mayor Hsu Tsai-li, Taoyuan County Magistrate Chu Li-lun,
Hsinchu County Magistrate Cheng Yung-chin, Hsinchu Mayor Lin
Zhen-zhe, Taichung Mayor Jason Hu, Taichung County Magistrate Huang
Chung-sheng, Penghu County Magistrate Lai Feng-wei and Hualien County
Magistrate Hsieh Shen-shan have shown keen interest in running for
re-election.
</P>
<P>
But a fresh KMT-PFP cooperation seems unlikely in view of the
PFP's reluctance, observers said, adding that sharp competition
between the two parties will be hard to avoid.

MOEA TO PROMOTE ENERGY SAVING POLICIES

<P>
The Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA)
will pull out all the stops to promote energy saving policies in line
with the implementation of the Kyoto Protocol, Economics Minister Ho
Mei-yueh said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan will adhere to terms of the Kyoto Protocol, even though it
is not a signatory of the international agreement, Ho said.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan is not allowed to sign the international accord as it is
not a member of the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
A national energy conference slated for June 20-21 will mainly
discuss the country's energy consumption structure, greenhouse gas
emissions and upgrading energy efficiency, the minister revealed.
</P>
<P>
According to a draft plan, the MOEA has set mid-term and
long-term energy saving targets of upgrading energy efficiency by 1.2
percent year-on-year by 2010 and by a further 1 percent by 2020, she
added.
</P>
<P>
However, she said, the government's policy of making Taiwan

<P>
President Chen Shui-bian on Tuesday urged
the public to respect intellectual property rights while addressing
the opening ceremony of the 2005 Taipei International Book Exhibition
at the Taipei World Trade Center.
</P>
<P>
Jointly presiding over the opening ceremony with Lin Chia-lung,
director-general of the Government Information Office, Chen said that
reading can not only increase the sum of one's knowledge, but can
also help expand a person's "field of vision" to deal with matters.
Only those people or nations that have a wide field of vision can
move forward steadily and not be eliminated by the times or
circumstances, he added.
</P>
<P>
The president also expressed the hope that students will respect
intellectual property rights by not engaging in such activities as
photocopying textbooks.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Lin said the exhibition is a model of cooperation
between the government and private sectors. He added that the
government will not only help publishers to hold exhibitions, but
will also help them to participate in leading international book
fairs overseas. He said that by doing so, it is hoped that Taiwan's
publishing sector can serve as a center for cultural exchanges.
</P>
<P>
On display at the exhibition, whose theme is "New Reading Trends
in Asia, " are paper and digital publications from around the world.
Various seminars and forums will also be held during the fair to give
the public a better understanding of the reading trends in other
countries in Asia and the West.
</P>
<P>
A total of 877 publishing companies from 40 countries are
participating in the fair which is set to run through Feb. 20.

MA CONFIDENT ABOUT DOING JOB OF TAIPEI MAYOR AND KMT CHAIRMAN WELL

Taipei, Feb. 15 (CNA)

<TEXT>
<P>
Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou said Tuesday that
he is confident about being able to do both the job of mayor and of
chairman of the opposition Kuomintang well.
</P>
<P>
Ma, who a day earlier openly expressed his intention to run for
the post of party chairman in the election scheduled for this May,
made the remarks at a gathering of KMT members at the party's Taipei
branch to celebrate the Chinese New Year.
</P>
<P>
Ma, who concurrently serves as a KMT vice chairman, said Monday
that for the sake of reform and solidarity of the KMT and the
integration of the "pan-blue alliance" of the KMT, People First Party
and New Party, he would "give it a try" regarding running for the
post of chairman. Ma's term as Taipei mayor is set to expire in
December next year.
</P>
<P>
Ma said Tuesday that he will travel around the island to explain
his views in running for the party's top post and his views on
various party affairs in meetings with rank and file KMT members in
the hopes of arousing their concern for party affairs and their
support for the party's policies.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, another possible contender for the KMT chairmanship,
Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng, said that he would give
running for the post "serious consideration" if incumbent KMT
Chairman Lien Chan decided not to run for re-election.
</P>
<P>
The politically savvy Wang, who is also a KMT vice chairman, said
Monday that he supports Lien's continued leadership of the party.
</P>
<P>
On the view expressed by Legislator Ker Chien-ming of the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party that a legislative speaker should not
concurrently serve as a party chairman, Wang said this is only Ker's
own personal opinion.
</P>
<P>
Chi Kuo-tung, the KMT's caucus whip in the legislature, noted
that even President Chen Shui-bian concurrently served as party
chairman before, adding there is no reason why a legislative speaker
cannot do so. He also noted that Lien Chan has called for all
qualified candidates within the party to come forward to run for the
chairmanship.

The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) has
so far received a total of NT$230.61 million (US$7.21 million) in
cash for relief aid to people affected by last December's devastating
tsunami tragedy in South and Southeast Asia, a ministry official said
Tuesday.
</P>

According to Chiang, the MOFA has also collected a large amount

STUDENTS BARE ALL IN THE NAME OF CLEAN AIR
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Six university students bared all Tuesday
in Taipei to bring attention to Taiwan's failure to address the
reduction of the emission of greenhouse gases as specified in the
Kyoto Protocol, which will come into force tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
The students from Taichung and Yunlin, under the auspice of
Taiwan Environmental Protection Union Secretary-General He Tsung-hsun
and Yunlin County Wild Bird Society Acting President Chang Tzu-chien,
stripped in front of the Executive Yuan despite pleas from police that
they could be cited for indecent exposure. In the end, the students
-- all men -- were left with fig-leaf signs covering their private
parts admonishing Environmental Protection Administration (EPA).
</P>
<P>
The Taiwan Academy of Ecology also took part in the protest.
</P>
<P>
Under the Kyoto Protocol, to which Taiwan is not a signatory, 30
industrialized countries have agreed to reduce emissions of six major
greenhouse gases between 2008 and 2012 to 5.2 percent below 1990
levels.
</P>
<P>
EPA figures show that Taiwan's total greenhouse gas emissions
rose by 70 percent between 1990 and 2000.
</P>
<P>
The environmentalists pointed out that the government has acted
against international trends and has continued to promote an
investment project by the Formosa Plastics Group (FPG) to build the
island's eighth naphtha cracker and a large steel refinery, which
they said consume large amounts of energy and give off a great deal
of greenhouse gases.
</P>
<P>
The Industrial Development Bureau (IDB) under the Ministry of
Economic Affairs said earlier this month that the FPG's steel
refinery in Yunlin will begin construction in June at the latest.
</P>
<P>
The project is now only waiting for environmental impact
assessments and related operations are proceeding smoothly, IDB
officials said.
</P>
<P>
When the Executive Yuan officials got wind of what was going on
outside, they asked the protesters to come inside and discuss the
issue; however, the students preferred to carry on with their
publicity stunt.
</P>
<P>
The event ended with the environmentalists shouting slogans of
"love the earth" and "protect the climate."
</P>
<P>
A student surnamed Wu said that this was the first time that he
had ever done something like this, adding that he and the others had
decided to strip without being cajoled.

<P>
Premier Frank Hsieh said Tuesday that if he
fails to find a candidate from one of the opposition parties to
become vice premier, he will announce his own candidate after Feb.
17.
</P>
<P>
The premier made the comments while attending the inauguration of
the ruling Democratic Progressive Party's (DPP) new chairman, Su
Tseng-chang.
</P>
<P>
Pointing out that although he already has his own candidate for
the post in mind, Hsieh said that to establish political harmony and
respond to the people's expectations, the Executive Yuan still hopes
to find a candidate from one of the opposition camps.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, the premier said that since administrative work
should not be interrupted and the legislature will soon start its new
session, he will announce his own candidate for the post if the
opposition continues to give him the cold shoulder.
</P>
<P>
The premier has invited P.K. Chiang, a former deputy speaker of
the Legislative Yuan and a vice chairman of the Kuomintang, to serve
as vice premier, but Chiang has not been receptive to the idea.

FOREIGN TRADE IN JANUARY POSES DOUBLE-DIGIT GROWTH: BOFT
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Feb.  15 (CNA)
(By Elizabeth Hsu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taiwan's exports and imports in January
reached US$30.82 billion, a growth of 37.7 percent over the same
month last year, officials of the Bureau of Foreign Trade (BOFT) said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan suffered a deficit in January of US$200 million, the
second deficit in a row. Despite that, the island has still
maintained double-digit growth in terms of foreign trade, the
officials said. According to customs tallies, Taiwan's exports in
January saw a 29.7 percent increase over the previous year's level to
US$15.31 billion, while imports surged 46.7 percent to US$15.51
billion.
</P>
<P>
With an expected sluggishness in global economic development due
to factors including the recent fluctuation of the U.S. dollar
against the yen and the euro, the possible raising of U.S. interest
rates, as well as mainland Chinese authorities' economic controls,
the scale of global trade is expected to shrink this year, a
situation that is believed will slow Taiwan's economic expansion,
BOFT officials said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, in January, Taiwan's combined exports to Hong Kong and
mainland China saw a growth of 38.3 percent over the same month last
year, with exports accounted for 37.8 percent of the island's total
exports, according to the BOFT.
</P>
<P>
In order not to be over-dependent on the mainland Chinese market,
the bureau has chosen Vietnam, India, Bangladesh, Japan, South Korea,
Brazil, Russia and Argentina to serve as goal markets in its efforts
to help Taiwanese business diversify their overseas markets, the
officials added.

DPP SHOULD CONSIDER HOW TO SHAKE OFF THREAT FROM CHINA: VP LU
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei, Feb. 15 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Vice President Annette Lu said Tuesday that
the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) must consider how to
shake off the threat from communist mainland China.
</P>
<P>
Lu made the remarks when she attended the inauguration of Su
Tseng-chang as the new DPP chairman.
</P>
<P>
Lu noted that the Eurasia Group recently ranked President Chen
Shui-bian as the 27th major national leader in the world, while in
another ranking by the U.S. magazine Parade, a weekend supplement to
340 U.S. newspapers, Chinese President Hu Jintao was called the
fourth of the world's top-10 dictators.
</P>
<P>
The sharp contrast is a great encouragement to the DPP, Lu said.
</P>
<P>
The vice president used the comparison to highlight the fate of
the Taiwan people, saying that Taiwan bears two historical crosses.
</P>
<P>
Firstly, Lu was referring to the authoritarian regime of the
Kuomintang administration, a situation that began to be addressed
first during the infamous "Kaohsiung Incident" in 1979, a rally
organized by the opposition to celebrate International Human Rights
Day that turned violent. The incident is generally considered to have
sewn the seeds for the growth of the DPP.
</P>
<P>
Secondly, Taiwan faces an unprecedented threat from mainland
China, which seeks hegemony by absorbing Taiwan, something that the
people of Taiwan must counter, Lu said.
</P>
<P>
The DPP has to see clearly its historic responsibility and
understand the historical challenges it has faced, Lu said, adding
that instead of concentrating on relations with mainland China, the
focus must also be on Taiwan's relations with the world.
</P>
<P>
Lu said that President Chen stands for the Taiwan people, whose
influence and moral courage have won recognition from the
international community.
</P>
<P>
The DPP needs to recreate this beautiful island, she said, adding
that the party's goal is to build Taiwan into a "normal, great,
beautiful and complete country," Lu said.

<P>
New ruling Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) Chairman Su Tseng-chang said Tuesday he will dedicate himself
to leading the party in winning the hearts and minds of the public.
</P>
<P>
Su made the pledge in his inaugural speech, titled "Action,
Interaction, Touch the People."
</P>
<P>
Saying that the DPP belongs to the people, Su said the party is
willing to take firm action to realize its noble ideals and will move
the people through "action and interaction."
</P>
<P>
"As the ruling party, the DPP must always be modest, humble,
accountable and responsive to popular demand. The DPP must also take
the lead in offering initiatives toward formulating mainstream public
opinion," Su said.
</P>
<P>
Su, a lawyer-turned-politician, said he will serve as a role
model for all DPP party workers by "embracing the land and the
grassroots people, interacting with rank-and-file party members and
engaging all social quarters."
</P>
<P>
He said he will also direct all departments at the DPP
headquarters to engage the major political parties and direct DPP
local chapters to forge extensive and familiar ties with various
segments of society.
</P>
<P>
"We'll turn attentive ears to different voices and reflect
popular opinion. We'll be a sincere party and win the hearts and
minds of the people with passion, sincerity and humility," Su said.
</P>
<P>
Stressing that the DPP has accomplished many historic missions
with courage, diligence and perseverance, Su said the party must
continue working hard because many even tougher challenges lie ahead.
</P>
<P>
Su took the DPP's helm in a ceremony attended by many prominent
political figures from both the ruling and opposition camps,
including President Chen Shui-bian, Vice President Annette Lu,
Premier Frank Hsieh, former President Lee Teng-hui, Legislative Yuan
President Wang Jin-pyng, Examination Yuan President Yao Chia-wen,
Taiwan Solidarity Union Chairman Su Chin-chiang, People First Party
Vice Chairman Chang Chao-hsiung and Cheng Feng-shih, deputy director
of the Kuomintang's policy coordination department.
However, three former DPP Chairmen -- Hsu Hsin-liang, Shih Ming-teh
and Lin Yi-hsiung -- did not attend.
</P>
<P>
As Su used to be rugby player, a rugby ball was used in the
handover ceremony to symbolize the transition of the party's helm.
President Chen, who stepped down as DPP chairman last December to
assume responsibility for the party's worse-than-expected performance
in the Dec. 11 legislative elections, passed the rugby ball to acting
Chairman Ker Chien-ming, who then transferred the ball to Su,
completing the handover ceremony.
</P>
<P>
Su entered politics after serving as a defense lawyer in the
trial of pro-democracy activists involved in the 1979 Kaohsiung
Incident during Taiwan's martial-law era. He also previously served
as a provincial assemblyman, as well as the magistrate of Taiwan's
southernmost county of Pingtung and the most populous county of
Taipei in northern Taiwan. He resigned as President Chen's chief of
staff last December to run for the DPP chairmanship. He invariably
ranks top of a shortlist of DPP candidates for the 2008 presidential
race.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the handover ceremony, Chen said success has always
belonged to those who have worked hardest at every stage of life.
</P>
<P>
Premier Hsieh, who also once served as DPP chairman, said Su has
outpaced him in terms of personal image, intelligence, courage and
popularity. 
</P>
<P>
"I have a feeling of ease in seeing Su taking the party's helm.
Under his leadership, the DPP will become even stronger and more
popular. I keenly hope the DPP will serve as the Cabinet's backup in
delivering on the party's promise to bring good fortune, prosperity
and security to the nation and the people," Hsieh said.

FOCUS OF BATTLE AGAINST PIRACY TO BE CONCENTRATED ON BOOKS

<TEXT>
<P>
The Intellectual Property Office (TIPO)
under the Ministry of Economic Affairs will concentrate on cracking
down on pirated books, a TIPO official said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Lu Wen-hsiang, vice director of the TIPO, told a news conference
while unveiling an anti-piracy advertisement that book piracy has not
aroused the same public awareness as piracy of software, music and
movies, because, he claimed, it "prevails only among university
students" who prefer to download digital books from the Internet or
steal the work of authors by buying pirated books rather than buying
authentic copies.
</P>
<P>
"Therefore we will try to instill into them the respect for
intellectual property through an advertising campaign using film and
posters that should appeal to youth," Lu said.
</P>
<P>
In order to get the maximum publicity, Lu said, the advertising
campaign was timed to launch to coincide with the beginning of the
new semester and the beginning of the Taipei International Book
Exhibition 2005, which opened that day.
</P>
<P>
Lu said he hopes the ads will also impress foreign publishers who
visit Taiwan for the book exhibition.

The Bush administration, condemning the assassination of the

Syria's domination of Lebanon at the United Nations Security Council.
American and European officials als o said the Bush administration

EXPERTS CALL FOR URGENT NEED TO CUT GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Feb.  15 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taiwan might face serious heatwaves and
power and water shortages in 30 years if the country fails to cut its
greenhouse gas emissions, experts and researchers have warned.
</P>
<P>
According to a mock forecast by the Global Changes Research
Center under National Taiwan University, there will be more than 60
days with temperatures above 35 degrees Celsius each summer three
decades from now should average temperatures continue to rise. The
number could surge to 90 days six decades from now, according to the
research. The present average is 40 days.
</P>
<P>
Center Director Liu Chung-ming said that continued high
temperatures would first trigger dry spells, affecting agriculture
and that subsequent water shortages would deal a heavy below to the
country's economy and threaten people's lives, especially children
and the elderly.
</P>
<P>
However, in a total contradiction, Liu Shaw-chen, director of the
Research Center for Environmental Changes at Academia Sinica,
expressed grave concern over flooding rather than drought.
</P>
<P>
As a result of rising temperatures, floods caused by
precipitation due to sharply increased evaporation would become much
more frequent in Taiwan, Liu explained, pointing out that Taiwan's
average temperature is rising at a pace double that of the world
average.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan's average temperature has increased by 1.1 C over the past
century, compared to the world's average increase of 0.6 C degrees,
according to Liu, who ascribed the worsening to the country's rapid
urbanization, the "heat island" effect and pollution.
</P>
<P>
He claimed that per-capita carbon dioxide emissions in Taiwan are
double the levels of developed countries such as Germany and Britain
but is still less than levels in the United States and Canada.
</P>
<P>
Given that Taiwan's gross domestic product has not in turn grown
markedly, it is an indication that energy has been seriously wasted,
he said, urging the government to review its energy policies and
tighten restrictions on vehicles and energy-consuming industries.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the government should draw up a comprehensive
policy to deal with the country's long-term demand, he went on. He
also called for an in-depth examination and practical adjustments of
the ruling party's anti-nuclear power stance.
</P>
<P>
In view of the implementation of the Kyoto Protocol Wednesday,
Taiwan is very likely to be sanctioned by the international community
if it fails to cut its greenhouse gas emissions effectively, local
environmentalists have warned.
</P>
<P>
Citing statistics released by the Environmental Protection
Administration, Taiwan is the world's 22nd-largest polluter in terms
of carbon dioxide emissions -- 2.39 million metric tons per year, or
nearly 1 percent of the globe's total, they said, adding that the
amount will have climbed to 4.61 million metric tons in 2020 at its
current pace of an annual 7.9 percent growth rate.
</P>
<P>
Should Taiwan be punished, exports of its cement, petrochemical
and steel industries, as well as the hi-tech semiconductor and panel
display sectors will be tremendously hurt, they pointed out.
</P>
<P>
The issue is not just about the economy but also about a tainted
national image, they said.

NEW MOVE ADOPTED TO PREVENT MAINLAND CHINESE TOURISTS FROM ABSCONDING
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,   Feb.  15  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Tourism Bureau took over the
responsibility Tuesday of handling the reception of tour groups from
mainland China to prevent them from absconding en masse once they
arrive in Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Several cases involving mainland tour groups disappearing en
masse upon arrival at Chiang Kai-shek International Airport --
Taiwan's main gateway -- were reported last July. To prevent a
recurrence of similar incidents, the Aviation Police Bureau then sent
staff members to receive mainland tour groups, assisting them in
customs clearance and luggage claim before transferring them to tour
guides employed by local travel agencies.
</P>
<P>
As the Aviation Police Bureau faces a manpower shortage, relevant
government agencies decided to authorize the Tourism Bureau's travel
service center at CKS Airport to take over the job from Feb. 15.
</P>
<P>
Hereafter, the CKS travel service center will issue provisional
passcards to licensed tour guides from local tourist agencies so that
they can enter the airport's controlled areas to receive incoming
mainland tour groups.
</P>
<P>
In preparation for taking over the new mission, the Tourism
Bureau has organized training programs to help qualified local tour
guides familiarize themselves with the procedures of receiving
mainland tour groups. About 300 local tour guides have attended the
training courses and passed examinations to qualify them for
provisional passcards.
</P>
<P>
Lin Chung-ching became the first local tour guide to legally
enter the airport's controlled areas with a temporary passcard issued
by the Tourism Bureau Tuesday to receive eight incoming mainland
tourists.
</P>
<P>
With a view to revving up the local tourist industry, the
government now allows mainland citizens to make group tours of Taiwan
as long as they arrive and leave via a third area.

PREMIER MAKES NEW APPOINTMENTS

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A former director of the Department of Mass
Rapid Transit (MRT) System under the Kaohsiung city government will
be the new vice minister of transportation and communications,
Cabinet spokesman Cho Jung-tai said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Cho said Premier Frank Hsieh, who was previously mayor of the
southern port city of Kaohsiung, has endorsed Chou Li-liang's
replacement of Tsai Duei as vice minister of transportation and
communications.
</P>
<P>
Tsai will now serve as vice chairman of the Cabinet-level Public
Construction Commission, Cho said.
</P>
<P>
Chou resigned as the Kaohsiung MRT department chief last year in
the wake of a spate of landslides and other accidents at MRT
construction sites and his new appointment is expected to receive
criticism, but Cho claimed that the landslide accidents were mainly
related to the region's topography and had "nothing to do" with
faulty or slipshod engineering.
</P>
<P>
As the island's first high-speed railway is slated to become
operational later this year, Cho said Chou was recruited to oversee
relevant affairs. Chou's professional expertise has long received
high recognition in engineering circles, according to Cho.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Cho said the premier has also approved the appointment
of Tang Chin-chuan, a former legislator of the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP), as vice minister of justice.
</P>
<P>
Noting that Tang has been a noted labor and human rights lawyer,
Cho said Tang is very suitable for the new post.

TAIWAN IC INDUSTRY YIELDS NEW HIGH IN OUTPUT VALUE: DGBAS
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Feb. 15 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taiwan's IC industry recorded a production
value of US$33.3 billion in 2004, the first time that the country's
hi-tech business surpassed the NT$1 trillion mark, the Cabinet-level
Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics (DGBAS)
reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The figure represents a 1.5-fold increase over the 1999 level and
ranks Taiwan in the world's fourth place in terms of output value,
according to DGBAS tallies.
</P>
<P>
However, it is worth noting that the chip foundry sector of the
domestic industry is the world's No. 1, setting a production value of
US$12 billion last year, the same statistics show. In terms of good
items, chips made up the bulk of the domestic industry, accounting
for more than 80 percent of the total.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the domestic IC design sector also ranks in
second spot globally, with an output value of US$7.8 billion, the
tallies indicate.
</P>
<P>
DGBAS officials attributed the brilliant performance to the
industry's excellent research and development abilities, outstanding
manufacturing processes and unique labor division strategy.
</P>
<P>
They also ascribed the global industry's growth to strong demand
for opto-electronic goods such as digital cameras and video cameras,
and for daily use products such as cell phones and personal
computers.
</P>
<P>
The increase marked a turnabout for a sluggish world
semiconductor industry over the past few years. The international
market scale of the semiconductor industry peaked in 2000 at US$204.4
billion, but started to dwindle in 2001 due to a global economic
recession.
</P>
<P>
In terms of region, the United States was the world leader in the
IC industry prior to 2000, enjoying a market share of more than 30
percent.
</P>
<P>
However, Asian countries such as Taiwan and South Korea have
increasingly replaced the United States in recent years, DGBAS
officials said. Countries in the Asia-Pacific region have outpaced
the United States since 2001 to become the world's largest
manufacturing base, with a combined production value of US$88.7
billion and a 40 percent stake in the global market.

<TEXT>
<P>
opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Vice Chairman
P.K. Chiang, who has been tapped by Premier Frank Hsieh as his
favorite candidate for vice premier, said Tuesday that he backs the
KMT's stance on the idea of his serving in the Cabinet and was
relieved to learn that Hsieh has already found someone else.
</P>
<P>
In a written statement issued through the KMT, Chiang affirmed
the premier's efforts to cooperate with the KMT for the sake of
political stability and his pragmatic approach to political issues.
</P>
<P>
"There is no single panacea for the economic issues, " Chiang
said, adding that the economy will not be easily turned around simply
by appointing him vice premier.
</P>
<P>
As a loyal party member, Chiang said, he respects the KMT's
insistence that the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) should
have sought KMT approval before trying to recruit him, claiming that
this would have brought about reconciliation and cooperation between
the ruling and opposition parties.
</P>
<P>
Noting that he recommended to President Chen Shui-bian four years
ago that he cooperate with the opposition in order to stabilize the
political situation, seek harmony with mainland China for the
interest of both sides of the Taiwan Strait, strengthen the ruling
team and boost morale in the civil service, Chiang said these
recommendations were also the KMT's demands for the DPP in exchange
for it's approval of Chiang's appointment.
</P>
<P>
"The KMT's requests are necessary for the Taiwan people to have a
better future, for me to have a free hand in the Cabinet and for the
people to improve their wellbeing," Chiang claimed.
</P>
<P>
Chiang said he hopes Chen and Hsieh are not disappointed because
of the failure of their negotiations with the KMT, predicting that
there will be more opportunities for cooperation between the two
parties on other issues.
</P>
<P>
Chiang left for the United States for a private visit earlier in
the day after learning that Hsieh had given up trying to recruit him.

<P>
Mainland China is pushing Taiwan to decide
through a referendum whether to "separate from the mainland" if it
makes the "one country, two systems" or "one China" principle a part
of its proposed anti-secession law, Mainland Affairs Council Chairman
Joseph Wu said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking with a group of pro-Taiwan independence activists, Wu
said Taiwan will have no choice other than to ask its people to
decide in a referendum whether to unite with the mainland on
Beijing's terms of "one country, two systems" or whether to accept
the "one China" principle if Beijing enshrines either of them in its
proposed law.
</P>
<P>
He warned Beijing that the enactment of the so-called
"anti-secession law" is a provocation and an attempt to change the
status quo across the Taiwan Strait, which Taiwan will not tolerate.
</P>
<P>
The pro-independence activists called on the government to
respond strongly to Beijing's proposal to enact an anti-secession law
designed to frighten Taiwan into giving up moves toward independence.

CHINA WELL AWARE OF U.S. VIEWS ON ANTI-SECESSION LAW: STATE DEP'T
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Washington, Feb. 15 (CNA)
(By Oliver Lin and P.C. Tang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
U.S. State Department spokesman Richard
Boucher said Tuesday that Beijing is acutely aware of Washington's
views concerning it's proposed anti-secession law.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman made the remarks in response to reporters'
questions after Robert B. Zoellick, nominee for the post of deputy
secretary of state, commented on China's anti-secession law in his
confirmation hearing by saying that Washington certainly discourages
Beijing from enacting such a law.
</P>
<P>
"We encourage a dialogue, and we certainly discourage actions
like that that move in the other direction," Zoellick said during the
hearing held by the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations.
</P>
<P>
Asked how the United States has tried to discourage China from
enacting the anti-secession law, Boucher responded by saying that the
U.S. government has made it clear that neither side " should take
unilateral steps that try to define the situation further or push it
in one direction or another."
</P>
<P>
Boucher noted that the United States has made its position on the
proposed anti-secession law clear right from the start.
</P>
<P>
Pointing out that Secretary of State Colin Powell and the U.S.
embassy in China have raised the issue with Beijing, Boucher said
that "the Chinese know clearly what our views are."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, in response to questions raised by Sen. Lisa Murkowski
(R-Ala.) , Zoellick said during the hearing that the goal of the
United States is for China and Taiwan to work out their differences
peacefully and in a way that is acceptable to the people on both
sides of the Taiwan Strait.
</P>
<P>
Zoellick also said that the U.S. administration maintains its
policy based on the one-China principle and the three communiques and
that U.S. President George W. Bush remains committed to the terms of
the Taiwan Relations Act.

TOP ECONOMIST TIGHT-LIPPED ON POSSIBLE APPOINTMENT AS VICE PREMIER
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Feb.  16 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taiwan Institute of Economic Research
(TIER) President Wu Rong-i declined to respond to news reports
Wednesday that he is going to be appointed by Premier Frank Hsieh as 
vice premier.
</P>
<P>
Wu said that he has no idea about the appointment, which he
described as "an appointment made by the media."
</P>
<P>
He also declined to confirm whether he has been sounded out by
Hsieh about such an appointment.
</P>
<P>
Premier Hsieh disclosed Tuesday that he already has a suitable
candidate for the vice premiership who "is able to handle the overall
economic situation, capable of dealing with international affairs and
who is not a member of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party."
</P>
<P>
Wu is widely believed to be the person described by Hsieh.
</P>
<P>
Hsieh extended an invitation to opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Vice
Chairman P.K. Jiang in January to serve as his deputy and later said
he would not contact any other potential candidates ahead of the Feb.
17 deadline that he set for a response from the KMT on the
appointment of Jiang. The KMT has set six preconditions which Hsieh
said go beyond his authority to meet.
</P>
<P>
Hsieh, formerly Kaohsiung mayor, was sworn in as premier Feb. 1,
inaugurating a new Cabinet which Hsieh said will make consultations
and coexistence its cornerstone.
</P>
<P>
All the members of the previous Cabinet under former Premier Yu
Shyi-kun were retained, with the exception of Executive Yuan
Secretary-General Arthur Iap, Minister of Justice Chen Ding-nan and
Central Personnel Administration Director-General Lee Yi-yang.
</P>
<P>
The post of vice premier, however, has remained vacant.

WANG SERVING AS KMT HEAD WOULD AFFECT HIS NEUTRALITY AS SPEAKER: DPP
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Feb.  16 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The legislative caucus of the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) said Wednesday that if Legislative
Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng assumes the post of KMT chairman, this
will affect his neutrality as the head of the legislature.
</P>
<P>
Lai Ching-teh, DPP caucus whip in the legislature, made
the remarks as reports circulated that Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou, who
openly expressed Monday his intention to run for the top KMT post,
could face a possible challenge from Wang.
</P>
<P>
Wang has said that he supports KMT Chairman Lien Chan's continued
leadership of the party and that he would only give "serious
consideration" to running in the May election if Lien decided not to
stay on in his post.
</P>
<P>
Lai said that the KMT chairman election is an internal matter of
the KMT and that the DPP will not interfere. He added however that
the DPP's position is that the legislative speaker should be neutral.
</P>
<P>
As the speaker, Wang represents the legislature, Lai noted,
adding that if he were to assume the KMT chairmanship, then he might
ignore the views of other parties when speaking for the legislature.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, four DPP legislators said Wednesday that Wang must
make a choice between the legislative speakership and the KMT
chairmanship, adding that if he decides to run for KMT chairman, he
should first step down as speaker.
</P>
<P>
DPP Legislators Huang Wei-tse, Hsieh Hsin-ni, Chen Ying and Cheng
Yun-peng made the call in a press conference held at the legislature.
</P>
<P>
Huang said that it is "inappropriate" for others to stick their
noses into the KMT's internal affairs, but he added that Wang must
maintain his strict neutrality as legislative speaker.
</P>
<P>
If Wang serves concurrently as the KMT chairman, this will
undermine his neutrality in presiding over the legislature, thus
affecting the harmony between the ruling and the opposition parties
as well as the legislature's efficiency, Huang claimed. He added that
Wang might be inclined to put party considerations first, thus
undermining the dignity of the legislature as well as seriously
affecting its operations.

KMT CHAIRMAN, PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS SHOULD NOT BE LINKED: OFFICIAL
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei, Feb. 16 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng said
Wednesday that those who want to take part in the election of the
opposition Kuomintang (KMT) chairman should not link the election
with the next presidential election.
</P>
<P>
Wang made the remarks amid reports that he and Taipei Mayor Ma
Ying-jeou could face off in the KMT chairman election in May.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the next presidential election will not be held until
2008, Wang said that changes could be dramatic during the ensuing
period and that those who want to take part in the party chairmanship
election should not link the outcome with jockeying for the
presidential election.
</P>
<P>
With media surveys showing that Ma is far more favored than Wang
for either the KMT chairmanship or the presidential election, Wang
claimed that the survey is only "for reference" and that there will
be changes in the actual elections.
</P>
<P>
Wang also said he will maintain party solidarity and harmony.
</P>
<P>
"Whether I run in the party chairman election or not, I'll
respect Ma, " Wang said, adding that he will "protect him to a
substantial degree, " as Ma is a major asset of the party and should
be cherished.
</P>
<P>
On the issue of some legislators promoting a meeting between him
and Ma, Wang said there is no need for such a meeting, as Ma has
already made known his intention to run, while Wang said he is still
undecided.
</P>
<P>
But he said the KMT has been pushing for years without success
for reforms by making the legislative caucus, instead of the party's
central committee, decide on the KMT's policies. "If I have the
chance to serve as the legislative speaker and concurrently the party
chairman, I would be better able to push for such reforms," he said.
</P>
<P>
On claims from the ruling Democratic Progressive Party that it is
not appropriate for him to serve concurrently as party chairman and
legislative speaker, Wang noted that the constitutional systems of
each country vary and that there are different stipulations on the
role, function and power of the legislative speaker.
</P>
<P>
There are no regulations in the legislature that say the speaker,
in addition to presiding over the legislature, has no political room
or cannot take part in policy making, he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
According to Wang, the neutrality of the speaker and his role
outside the legislature should not be relevant. In addition, he went
on, the majority leader in the House of Representatives of the United
States also concurrently serves as the speaker of the House.

NATIONAL ENERGY CONFAB SLATED FOR JUNE IN RESPONSE TO KYOTO PROTOCOL
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Feb. 16 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A national energy conference is scheduled
to be held in June to allow the country to work out measures to cope
with Wednesday's implementation of the Kyoto Protocol on reducing
greenhouse gas emissions, according to officials from the Bureau of
Energy.
</P>
<P>
More than 200 people, including government officials, lawmakers,
labor representatives, academics and activists from environmental
protection groups, will be invited to take part in the conference,
which is aimed at soliciting experts' opinions and reaching consensus
on Taiwan's energy policies in the post-Kyoto Protocol era, the
officials said.
</P>
<P>
The Kyoto Protocol, negotiated in Japan's ancient capital of
Kyoto in 1997 and ratified by 140 nations, calls on 35 industrialized
countries to rein in their release of carbon dioxide and five other
gases produced by burning oil and coal, as well as by various other
processes.
</P>
<P>
Although Taiwan is not a United Nations member nor a signatory to
the U.N.-initiated Kyoto Protocol, the island is obliged to bear its
responsibilities as a member of the global village, a Bureau of
Energy spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan might end up becoming a target of concern or even trade
sanctions if it does not step up its greenhouse gas reduction
efforts, given that Taiwan releases some 2.39 million tons of carbon
dioxide into the atmosphere each year, or about 1 percent of the
global total, ranking the island 22nd in the world in this regard.
</P>
<P>
If stronger measures are not taken, Taiwan's greenhouse gas
emissions are expected to rise to some 4.61 million tons per year by
2020, the official warned.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Liu Ming-lung, one of the founders of the Taiwan
Climate Protection Coalition, said that Taiwan cannot sit idly by any
longer in the face of global actions to curb emissions.
</P>
<P>
Liu called on the government to ratify the Kyoto Protocol, even
though Taiwan is not a signatory, and then move to deal with
industries and companies that are the country's major polluters.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Liu said, the administration should aggressively
push for the enactment of a greenhouse gas emissions control law to
legally require that greenhouse gas emissions in Taiwan be cut to the
2005 levels by 2015.
</P>
<P>
Liu said the administration should also conduct an overall review
of the country's energy policies regarding nuclear, thermal and
recycled power, and try to secure for the country a low-pollution
power source that requires low energy to produce.
</P>
<P>
In light of the implementation of the Kyoto Protocol, Taiwan is
also urged to take part in the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM)
under the Kyoto Protocol.
</P>
<P>
The CDM is one of the protocol's two project-based flexible
mechanisms designed to make it easier and cheaper for industrialized
nations to meet greenhouse gas emission reduction targets agreed to
under the protocol, and to assist developing countries in achieving
sustainable development.
</P>
<P>
Although Taiwan is not a signatory to the Kyoto Protocol, it will
have to face reality and the global demand for greenhouse gas
emission reduction, according to Professor Lee Ho-ching of Chung Yuan
Christian University in Taoyuan, northern Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Lee, another founder of the Taiwan Climate Protection Coalition,
called on the government to seek participation in the less
politically high-profile CDM engagements, which she said would not
only help Taiwan to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and secure
sustainable development, but would also help the island to take part
in bankable projects in developing countries and gain a share of the
great earnings expected to be generated from greenhouse gas reduction
options.
</P>
<P>
With the Kyoto Protocol entering into force, governments and
companies that will have to curb their emissions in compliance with
their countries' caps are scrambling to figure out how to do so
without killing their bottom lines.
</P>
<P>
One of the best policies for dealing with the issue is to
cooperate with developing countries, either by helping them reduce
greenhouse gas emissions or by buying their greenhouse gas emission
"quotas, " according to National Taiwan University Professor Liu
Chung-ming. Those that emit less gas are allowed to sell the "credit"
to other countries or companies who emit too much.
</P>
<P>
Liu noted that the World Bank has estimated that under the CDM
operations, some US$10 billion in funds will flow into developing
countries every year.
</P>
<P>
Of that total, about 70 percent will be directed into mainland
China. This will provide Taiwan with a golden opportunity to cash in
on the huge market by investing in or taking part in bankable CDM
projects on the mainland, given Taiwan's cultural, language and
geographic advantages, Liu added.

CABINET DECIDES TO IMPOSE INCOME TAX ON SERVICEMEN, SCHOOL TEACHERS
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Feb.  16 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Executive Yuan decided Wednesday to
impose income tax on military servicemen and primary and junior high
school teachers.
</P>
<P>
The draft of the amended income tax law will be sent to the
Legislative Yuan for screening.
</P>
<P>
Executive Yuan officials said the move is a major short-term
measure for financial reforms promoted by the Ministry of Finance.
</P>
<P>
The officials estimated that if income tax for military
servicemen and school teachers is collected, it will add around NT$13
billion (US$412.69 million) in tax revenues to the national coffers.
</P>
<P>
The government scrapped income tax for military servicemen and
primary and junior high school teachers in 1955, mainly as an
incentive, because their salaries were generally low at the time.
</P>
<P>
However, former Premier Yu Shyi-kun decided to reimpose the
income taxes to establish a just and reasonable tax system.
</P>
<P>
The ministries of national defense, education and finance reached
a consensus on the reimposition of income tax in 2002 but the
previous legislative Yuan that ended in January this year failed to
screen the amended income tax law.

The Times: Mayor casts shadow on London's
Olympic bid.

Ken Livingstone was under intense pressure last night to
apologise for an allegedly anti-Semitic remark which is overshadowing
the most crucial week for London's 2012 Olympic bid. Inspectors from
the International Olympic Committee arrived yesterday to evaluate the
capital's £25 million campaign. Supporters of the bid now fear that
the Mayor of London's refusal to apologise for his remarks is
distracting attention from the four-day visit which climaxes with a
dinner hosted by the Queen at Buckingham Palace.

Financial Times: France fuels China arms row.

Michele Alliot-Marie, the French defence minister, has argued
that sales of weapons technologies to China could slow Beijing's push
to develop its own capabilities, which was part of the reason why her
country backed lifting a European Union arms embargo on China.
Although Ms Alliot-Marie insisted France had strict export regimes
that would prevent most lethal technologies getting into China's
hands, she said in an interview with the Financial Times that Beijing
was likely to have advanced arms in five years with or without
western help.

CABINET TO PUSH FOR REVIVAL OF SCHOOL SUBSIDIES: PREMIER

<TEXT>
<P>
The Executive Yuan will push for the
revival of subsidies for Taiwanese schools based in mainland China,
Premier Frank Hsieh said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Hsieh said that although subsidies for 2005 were axed by the
Legislative Yuan in its last session, the Cabinet will seek to plan
for extra budget in this area so that educational subsidies for
mainland-based Taiwanese schools can be sustained.
</P>
<P>
The premier made the remarks in an address to an annual Spring
Festival party in honor of mainland-based Taiwanese businessmen. The
party was co-sponsored by the Mainland Affairs Council, the Ministry
of Economic Affairs, the Straits Exchange Foundation and the
Taipei-based Chinese National Federation of Industries.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 500 Taiwanese businessmen, including 50 chairmen and 20
presidents of various Taiwanese trade associations based on the
mainland, attended the luncheon party.
</P>
<P>
It marked the first time Hsieh had attended an event with members
of the mainland-based Taiwanese business community since he assumed
the premiership Feb. 1.
</P>
<P>
He played a tune on a ceramic flute to entertain the
participants, who responded with a big round of applause.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the opening of the luncheon, Hsieh touted for support
for the establishment and operation of a cross-Taiwan Strait peace
and development committee initiated by President Chen Shui-bian.
</P>
<P>
Hsieh, who vowed in his inaugural speech Feb. 1 that his new
Cabinet will make consultations and coexistence its cornerstone, said
that consultations and coexistence can also be motto for the
development of cross-strait relations.
</P>
<P>
Hsieh also voiced his staunch support for a statement made by
Chen earlier in the day that he will push for the launch of direct
cargo charter flights across the Taiwan Strait based on the
successful Chinese Lunar New Year two-way, non-stop cross-strait
passenger charter flights.
</P>
<P>
He said direct cross-strait cargo charter flights will not only
help bolster business and trade development on both sides of the
Taiwan Strait, they will also benefit Taiwan in its development of
free trade ports.
</P>
<P>
As to whether he will accept an invitation from Taiwan business
groups to visit the mainland, Hsieh said his tight schedule will not
allow him at present to make such a trip.

CLINTON EXPECTED TO VISIT TAIWAN LATER THIS MONTH
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Feb.  16 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA)
confirmed news reports Wednesday that former U.S. President Bill
Clinton is expected to visit Taiwan before the end of this month as
part of a tour of Asia.
</P>
<P>
MOFA spokesman Michel Lu said the Foreign Ministry invited
Clinton to visit Taiwan in a move to show Taiwan's admiration for
Clinton's contributions to maintaining stability in the Asia-Pacific
area during his tenure.
</P>
<P>
Inviting retired U.S. presidents, as well as heads of state from
countries that are friendly toward Taiwan, have always been the set
policy of the Foreign Ministry, Lu added.
</P>
<P>
Delivering a speech in Taipei and meeting with President Chen
Shui-bian are expected to be part of his one-day itinerary, the
details of which have yet to be fleshed out, according to MOFA
officials.
</P>
<P>
Although Clinton is no longer president, he is expected to be
accorded treatment befitting a head of state during his visit,
according to MOFA officials.
</P>
<P>
Clinton has remained an internationally important figure since
his retirement and now acts as an unofficial representative of the
United States.
</P>
<P>
During his upcoming Asian tour, Clinton is expected to visit
South Asian and Southeast Asian countries that were battered by the
devastating tsunami of Dec. 26 last year. He is also expected to
visit several Northeast Asian countries, including Japan, South Korea
and mainland China.
</P>
<P>
"It is hoped that Clinton will be able to squeeze in one day to
visit Taiwan during the tour, " MOFA officials said.
</P>
<P>
With eight years in the White House, Clinton is very familiar
with the delicate triangular Taipei-Washington-Beijing relations.
</P>
<P>
The former U.S. president originally planned to come to Taiwan in
November 2003 but was forced to cancel the visit due to a tight
schedule. He was also scheduled to visit Taiwan Sept. 12, 2001, but
failed to make it due to the 911 terrorist attacks.
</P>
<P>
Clinton visited Taiwan four times during his tenure as governor
of Arkansas before being elected U.S. president in November 1991.

TAIWAN READY TO NEGOTIATE WITH MAINLAND CHINA ON CARGO CHARTERS
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Feb. 16 (CNA)
(By Y.F. Low)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taiwan is ready to negotiate with mainland
China on the launch of cross-Taiwan Strait cargo charter flights,
Mainland Affairs Council Chairman Joseph Wu said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
According to a plan unveiled by the government in 2003 but never
implemented, the cargo charter service will be operated by Taiwanese
air carriers and planes will be required to stop in Hong Kong or
Macau en route, Wu said.
</P>
<P>
However, other arrangements such as allowing mainland carriers to
offer the service and making the charter flights non-stop will have
to be made through negotiations between both sides, Wu said.
</P>
<P>
Wu made the remarks after President Chen Shui-bian said earlier
in the day that he hopes cross-strait cargo charter flights could be
started soon following the launch of special cross-strait Lunar New
Year charter flights this year.
</P>
<P>
Wu said the negotiation format of the passenger charter flights,
in which government representatives were allowed to participate,
should also apply to the negotiations on the cargo charter flights.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Wu urged Beijing to drop its plan to enact an
"anti-secession law, " legislation that will damage what he described
as "the friendly atmosphere across the strait."
</P>
<P>
If the law is to dictate "one country, two systems" as the only
option for the future development of cross-strait relations or make
Beijing's "one China" principle the precondition of cross-strait
negotiations, it will be tantamount to forcing the Taiwanese people
to call a referendum to express their opinions on the issues, Wu
said.
</P>
<P>
He said Taiwan and the mainland need to promote different
policies to enhance mutual trust.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the Lunar New Year charter flights, the government
is working to facilitate the launch of cargo charter flights, enhance
tourism across the strait and step up cross-strait crime-fighting
cooperation, he added.

<P>
Premier Frank Hsieh said Wednesday that he
will announce his deputy within the next few days.
</P>
<P>
Hsieh made the remarks following media speculation that possible
candidates for the vice premier post are Taiwan Institute of Economic
Research (TIER) President Wu Rong-i or Taiwan's permanent
representative to the World Trade Organization Yen Ching-chang.
</P>
<P>
Hsieh, a member of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP),
was sworn in as premier Feb. 1.
</P>
<P>
Describing speculation as "impolite" and making unnecessary
trouble for those named, Hsieh said he will announce the appointment
within the next few days.
</P>
<P>
However, he joked that the candidates named by the media are not
bad and maybe he will start to think about them.
</P>
<P>
The choosing of the vice premier has been through many twists and
turns after Hsieh had originally invited P.K. Chiang, a vice chairman
of the opposition Kuomintang (KMT) and a former deputy speaker of the
legislature, to take the post but received the cold shoulder from the
KMT.
</P>
<P>
Hsieh's invitation of a KMT member to serve as his deputy was
considered by the DPP to be a gesture of goodwill toward the
opposition, whose "pan-blue alliance" holds the majority in the
legislature.

PRESIDENT VOWS TO PUSH FOR CROSS-STRAIT CARGO CHARTER FLIGHTS
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei, Feb. 16 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President Chen Shui-bian offered talks with
mainland China Wednesday on the opening of direct cargo charter
flights across the Taiwan Strait, but warned that Beijing's proposed
anti-secession law could further strain bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a Spring Festival gathering of Taiwanese businessmen
operating in mainland China -- commonly known as "taishang" -- in
Taipei, Chen said he looks forward to an early launch of direct
cross-strait cargo charter flights based on the successful Chinese
Lunar New Year two-way, non-stop cross-strait passenger charter
flights.
</P>
<P>
"The success of the passenger charter flights shows that if there
is sincerity, nothing is impossible. If the mainland wants to sit
down and talk, there is nothing that cannot be discussed," Chen said.
</P>
<P>
The president further said he hopes the mainland will work to
ease misunderstandings and hostility toward Taiwan and stop any
actions that would only drive the two sides farther apart, such as
its unilateral suspension of institutionalized cross-strait dialogue
and its planned anti-secession law targeting Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Chen said the so-called anti-secession law could spoil the
positive mood created by the Lunar New Year passenger charter
flights. The law, slated to be discussed by the mainland's
rubber-stamp National People's Congress in March, is viewed as part
of Beijing's campaign to pressure democratic Taiwan into uniting with
the communist mainland.
</P>
<P>
More than 480 members from 67 Taiwanese trade associations on the
mainland, including many senior executives of those organizations,
attended the party, which was jointly organized by the Mainland
Affairs Council, the Ministry of Economic Affairs, the Straits
Exchange Foundation and the National Federation of Industries.
</P>
<P>
Chen said the Year of the Rooster has come with new opportunities
for both domestic political development and cross-strait affairs.
</P>
<P>
"My appeal for opening a new era of consultations and dialogue
has won the support of a majority of local people and various
political parties, " Chen said, adding that he believes his upcoming
meeting with opposition People First Party (PFP) Chairman James Soong
will help put an end to protracted hostile political wrangling
between the ruling and opposition camps and re-mould national unity.
</P>
<P>
Turning to cross-strait affairs, Chen said the smooth launch of
direct cross-strait charter flights for home-bound "taishang" for
Lunar New Year celebrations has not only benefited the "taishang" but
has also served as a good omen for the opening of the
long-talked-about cross-strait charter cargo flights.
</P>
<P>
Over the past more-than four years, Chen said, he has on numerous
occasions held out olive branches to the mainland and has
demonstrated the maximum degree of flexibility in dealing with
cross-strait affairs, including his "five noes" guarantee, his
willingness to discuss the "future one China" issue, the opening of
the "mini three links, " and the adjustment of the "no haste, be
patient" policy toward mainland-bound investment.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Chen went on, he even came up with the initiative in
his New Year's Day message that the two sides could resume dialogue
on the basis of their 1992 Hong Kong talks. Chen said he has never
wavered on his "pragmatic forward-looking" cross-strait policy since
he assumed the presidency May 20, 2000.
</P>
<P>
Chen said he hopes to invite opposition political leaders and
representatives from various social quarters to discuss the formation
of a cross-strait peaceful development commission in the near future
to draft concrete working guidelines for a solid foundation for
long-term peaceful cross-strait development.
</P>
<P>
A 56-year-old ban on direct cross-strait air links has been
temporarily lifted for this year's Lunar New Year holiday, also known
as the Spring Festival. Under a landmark cross-strait deal, six
mainland Chinese airlines and six Taiwanese airlines have been
allowed to operate 48 passenger charter flights between Jan. 29 and
Feb. 20.

The United States' policy on the Taiwan

EPA TO SPEED UP ENACTMENT OF GREENHOUSE GAS CONTROL LAW
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei, Feb. 16 (CNA)

<TEXT>
<P>
The Environmental Protection Administration
(EPA) will speed up the enactment of a greenhouse gas control law in
reaction to the implementation of the Kyoto Protocol on reducing
greenhouse gas emissions, EPA head Chang Juu-en said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Chang said he hopes the draft of the law will be finalized in
June and passed by the legislature by the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
Although Taiwan is not a signatory to the Kyoto Protocol, the
country will contribute its part in controlling greenhouse gas
emissions to comply with international standards, Chang said.
</P>
<P>
According to the EPA, the carbon dioxide released by Taiwan is
expected to increase to 460 million tons in 2020, which will be
quadruple the volume of 1990.
</P>
<P>
The law targets a reduction of carbon dioxide emissions by 35.6
million tons a year by 2020.
</P>
<P>
Chang said the EPA has surveyed six major greenhouse gases
released by the electricity, petrochemical, steel, paper, cement and
optoelectronic semiconductor industries in order to control their
total emission volume.
</P>
<P>
Also, Chang said, he will not rule out the possibility of
recommending that the government impose a "carbon tax" to push
pollution-prone industries to reduce their emissions of greenhouse
gases.
</P>
<P>
In the future, greenhouse gas emissions will be one of the
criteria for environmental impact assessments for major development
projects by the industrial sector, he went on.
</P>
<P>
This measure can be put into force in six months at the earliest,
he added.

TRANSFER OF TWO CHIANGS' DIARIES TO U.S. HURTS TAIWAN'S FEELINGS:DPP
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Feb. 16 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The transfer of two late Republic of China
presidents' personal diaries to the United States has hurt Taiwan
people's feelings, the legislative caucus of the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Legislator Lai ching-the, who will soon serve as the DPP
legislative whip, was referring to the transfer of the late President
Chiang Kai-shek's and his son and successor Chiang Ching-kuo's
personal diaries to the Hoover Institute of Stanford University.
</P>
<P>
"Although the Chiang family's move was not illegal, it has hurt
Taiwan people's feelings," Lai said.
</P>
<P>
In his view, Lai said, the two late presidents' personal effects
are Taiwan's assets. Academia Sinica, Taiwan's foremost academic
body, has expressed a keen interest to keep the two Chiangs' diaries,
but failed to obtain the Chiang family's consent.
</P>
<P>
The two Chiangs ruled Taiwan many years. Lai said that although
some local people have ill feelings about them, many other people
recognized their contributions to Taiwan. "It is regrettable that the
Chiang family has sent the two late presidents' diaries abroad, " he
added.
</P>
<P>
Chiang Kai-shek fled to Taiwan in 1949 after losing the Chinese
mainland to the Mao Zedong-led communist party in a bloody civil war.
He died in 1975 and his remains were embalmed in a temporary
mausoleum at Tzuhu in Taoyuan, awaiting a proper burial on the
mainland.
</P>
<P>
Chiang Kai-shek ruled Taiwan with an iron fist, using martial law
to suppress democracy. However, some view him as a hero for keeping
the island out of reach of the Chinese communists and claim that it
was he who fostered Taiwan's freewheeling market economy.
</P>
<P>
Chiang Ching-kuo is respected for ending martial law in 1987,
shortly before his death, thus unleashing the democratic forces that
broke his family's vice-grip on power and eventually ended the
Kuomintang's half-century of rule over Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Chiang Ching-kuo died in 1988 and his remains also lie embalmed
in an interim mausoleum at Touliao in Taoyuan. His Russian-born wife
died Dec. 15, 2004 and her cremated ashes, which are being kept at
Chiang's mausoleum, will be buried along with her husband.
</P>
<P>
The two Chiangs' personal diaries were brought to the United
States earlier this year by Chiang Ching-kuo's daughter-in-law Fang
Chih-yi.
</P>
<P>
Fang said in San Francisco Tuesday that the contents of the two
Chiangs' personal diaries were closely related with modern Chinese
history.
</P>
<P>
"Therefore, the Chiang family would not retain them in private.
We instead hope to present them to internationally recognized experts
for preservation and study in an open, just and impartial manner.
Many research institutes have expressed hopes to own them. But we
think that the Hoover Institute, which has a rich collection of
modern Chinese archives, is the most appropriate organization to hold
them. We have decided to have the Hoover Institute store them for 50
years," Fang said.
</P>
<P>
Kuo Tai-chun, a Hoover Institute researcher who plays a key role
for the institute's decision to form the Modern Chinese Archives,
said the institute has used what she called the safest way to
preserve the two Chiangs' diaries.
</P>
<P>
Modern Chinese history experts at the Hoover Institute and the
Chiang family will form a special task force to screen the two
Chiangs' diaries before deciding which parts will be publicized.
</P>
<P>
The Hoover Institute will hold a ceremony Wednesday (U.S. time)
to mark the establishment of its Modern Chinese Archives.
</P>
<P>
Kuo said the archives contain many historically significant
documents regarding the three most powerful families in modern China
-- the Chiang, Soong and Kung families -- as well as the Kuomintang
(KMT) and the Chinese Women's League founded by Madame Chiang
Kai-shek.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Kuo said, many living KMT party elders, including
former ROC Premiers Hau Pei-tsun and Tang Fei and former Control Yuan
President Wang Tso-jung, have also presented their personal documents
and effects to the Hoover Institute for preservation. According to
Kuo, all those documents are extremely readable and of great
historical significance.
</P>
<P>
KMT Vice Chairman P. K. Chiang already arrived in San Francisco
to attend the Modern Chinese Archives' inaugural ceremony at the
Hoover Institute.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the embalmed bodies of the two Chiangs are scheduled 
to be interred at a military cemetery in Taipei County this July.

NO INCREASE IN NUCLEAR POWER TO HELP CUT GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei, Feb. 16 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The government will not increase the use of
existing nuclear power plants or build new ones to reduce Taiwan's 
emissions of greenhouse gases, an official of the Executive Yuan said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Yeh Jiunn-rong, the executive officer of the Executive
Yuan's task force on the United Nations Framework Convention on
Climate Change and the Kyoto Protocol, stressed that the government's
goal of promoting a "nuclear-free homeland" remains unchanged.
</P>
<P>
The government will step up the development of clean and
renewable energy, and will never resort to increasing the number of
generators in nuclear power plants or build new nuclear power plants
to help resolve the greenhouse gas emissions problem.
</P>
<P>
Yeh made the remarks as the Kyoto Protocol came into effect the
same day.
</P>
<P>
The Kyoto Protocol has 84 signatories of which 30 are
industrialized nations. Taiwan is not a signatory.
</P>
<P>
However, Yeh continued, since Taiwan is highly reliant on
international trade, if domestic enterprises cannot fall into line
with international trends of reducing greenhouse gas emissions, then
it will lose its international competitive edge.
</P>
<P>
For Taiwan to substantially reduce its greenhouse gas emissions
will involve many complex factors, Yeh said, adding long-term
planning is required.
</P>
<P>
Taking a cue from industrialized countries, Yeh said that it will
take at least 10 to 15 years to see marked changes.
</P>
<P>
Amid reports that the government will impose some form of
"ecology tax" or a "carbon dioxide tax," Yeh said that the government
will definitely establish tax incentives, such as encouraging
enterprises to build new factories or renew equipment and phase out
dilapidated facilities or outdated production procedures to upgrade
energy efficiency and cut greenhouse gas emissions.
</P>
<P>
"But there is no plan to cope with the problem simply with
taxes," Yeh stressed.
</P>
<P>
Speaking of environmentalists who recently protested against the
government's approval of Formosa Plastics Group's project to build a
a large steel mill in Yunlin County, Yeh said that cutting carbon
dioxide emissions does not mean that companies will not be able to
build new facilities.
</P>
<P>
On the contrary, he said, if the construction of new, cleaner
plants eliminates out-of-date polluting ones, the practice will be
encouraged.

<TEXT>
<P>
The Executive Yuan will introduce
legislation to cut greenhouse gas emissions in Taiwan, Premier Frank
Hsieh said Wednesday as the Kyoto Protocol went into effect.
</P>
<P>
To reduce greenhouse gases in the country, mainly carbon dioxide
and other carbon by-products produced as the result of burning oil,
gas and coal, Hsieh said the Executive Yuan will work out measures to
improve energy efficiency, develop renewable energy and review the
country's energy management and industrial policies to meet the
requirements of the Kyoto Protocol.
</P>
<P>
As a member of the global village, Taiwan cannot exempt itself
from the obligation to cut emissions of greenhouse gases to below the
1990 level by 2012 as provided for by the Kyoto Protocol, although
the country is not a signatory, Hsieh said.
</P>
<P>
The premier made the comments after being briefed by Yeh
Jiunn-rong, head of a panel under the Executive Yuan formed to
prepare the country for the requirements called for by the Kyoto
Protocol.
</P>
<P>
The premier also asked the Environmental Protection
Administration to draw up rules to regulate greenhouse gas emissions,
and the Ministry of Economic Affairs to formulate new industry and
energy management policies to bring the country within the limits of
the protocol.
</P>
<P>
The premier said the Executive Yuan has already submitted to the
Legislative Yuan a draft bill designed to encourage the development
of renewable energy.
</P>
<P>
Hsieh asked related government agencies to focus on attracting
investments from environmentally friendly industries to avoid damage
to ecosystems.

New York Times: F.D.A. to Create Advisory
Board on Drug Safety.

Responding to widespread criticism of the government's handling
of drug safety problems, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration
announced Tuesday that it was creating a board to advise it on drug
complications and to warn patients about unsafe drugs. The agency
will soon tap into large databases, including those at the Medicare
agency, to uncover dangerous side effects in drugs already on the
market. The announcement comes as Congressional committees are
investigating the agency's ability to discover drug dangers.

Wall Street Journal: New Factor in Iraq: Irregular Brigades Fill
Security Void.

In the battle against insurgents in Iraq, two kinds of Iraqi
military forces are emerging: the planned units and the pop-ups. The
planned units of the Iraq Army, about 57,000 soldiers strong, are the
result of careful preparation this summer between the U.S. and Iraqi
commanders. The pop-ups started to emerge last fall out of nowhere,
catching the American military by surprise. These dozen disconnected
units totaling as many as 15,000 soldiers are fast becoming one of
the most significant developments in the new Iraq security situation.
Frequently, U.S. officials don't find out about the irregulars until
they stumble across them. Some Americans consider them a welcome
addition to the fight against the insurgency -- though others worry
about the risks.

GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION REQUIRED OF NEW INVESTMENT PROJECTS: MOEA
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  Feb.  16 (CNA)
(By Y.F. Low)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The two new investment projects by the
Formosa Plastics Corp. (FPC) and Chinese Petroleum Corp. (CPC) will
be required to minimize their carbon dioxide emissions to conform to
international efforts in controlling the release of greenhouse gases,
a Ministry of Economic Affairs official said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Chen Chao-yi, director of the MOEA's Industrial Development
Bureau, made the remarks after local environmental protection groups
had asked that the two projects -- one for a steel plant and another
for a petrochemical plant -- be scrapped.
</P>
<P>
The projects were approved by the ministry ahead of Wednesday's
implementation of the Kyoto Protocol, an international agreement to
cut back on the emission of greenhouse gases.
</P>
<P>
Chen said the ministry is very concerned about the problem of
greenhouse gas emissions and held serious discussions before
approving the projects.
</P>
<P>
It was determined during the National Energy Conference in 1998
that the hi-tech sector will be the backbone of Taiwan's industries
and that basic industries such as steel and petrochemical industries
will be mainly for domestic demand, Chen pointed out.
</P>
<P>
The Environmental Protection Administration will require the FPC
and CPC to minimize their carbon dioxide emissions while conducting
environmental impact assessments for the two projects, Chen said.

fifth from 24th recorded in the previous Games.
</P>
<P>
The deaf athletes' performances have not only upgraded Taiwan's

MANUFACTURERS MUST CUT GREENHOUSE GASES: ECONOMICS MINISTER
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Feb.  16 (CNA)
(By Elisa Kao)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Domestic manufacturers should adopt new
production procedures that emit less greenhouse gases, a move geared
to respond to the spirit of the Kyoto Protocol, which came into force
Wednesday, Minister of Economic Affairs Ho Mei-yueh said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Ho made the remarks after environmentalists voiced concern that
Taiwan's recently approved petrochemical investment projects may
produce large amounts of carbon dioxide, a kind of greenhouse gas
believed to cause global warming.
</P>
<P>
The minister noted that before approving the large investment
projects presented by Formosa Plastics Group and state-run Chinese
Petroleum Corp. to construct a naphtha cracker plant, a steel
refinery and a petrochemical complex, the ministry reached agreement
with the companies for them to adopt the finest production procedures
to reduce carbon dioxide emissions.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the ministry also asked them to present
energy-saving projects, Ho added.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the production of steel necessarily produces carbon
dioxide, Ho stressed that Taiwan will do what it can to reduce this
output to its lowest level possible.
</P>
<P>
The process of adopting new production procedures and eliminating
those factories with low energy efficiency will have a positive
impact on the reduction of global greenhouse gas emissions, Ho said.
</P>
<P>
As to the opinions of environmentalists, Ho said, "We can have
more communication with them, but investors ought to be given the
chance to fully explain their projects given that no other country
prohibits new investment projects simply because of the Kyoto
Protocol."
</P>
<P>
The U.N.-initiated Kyoto Protocol, of which Taiwan is not a
signatory, requires industrialized countries to reduce greenhouse
gases on average to 5.2 percent below 1990 levels by 2012.

PREMIER ORDERS IMMEDIATE STEPS TO CURB CRIME

<P>
Premier Frank Hsieh directed relevant
government agencies Wednesday to work out more effective
crime-fighting measures within a week.
</P>
<P>
Hsieh gave the directive at his first formal Cabinet meeting
since assuming office Feb. 1.
</P>
<P>
The premier said the Ministry of the Interior, which oversees the
National Police Administration, and all city and county governments
must work together to increase the number of police officers.
</P>
<P>
According to the government's 2005 budget, Hsieh said, the nation
should have 72,423 police officers.
</P>
<P>
"But at the moment, we have only slightly more than 68,500. The
interior ministry and local governments should immediately recruit
more police officers to reduce the crime rate," Hsieh said.
</P>
<P>
With a view to enhancing police authorities' criminal
investigative and preventive capabilities, Hsieh said the ratio of
detectives in the forces should be raised from the current 10 percent
to 12 percent.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Hsieh said equipment should be upgraded where possible
and the police presence in residential communities should also be
increased.
</P>
<P>
Relevant government agencies should also study the feasibility of
adjusting police ranks to boost police officers' morale and dignity,
Hsieh said.

ENVIRONMENTALISTS PROTEST U.S. FOR NOT SIGNING KYOTO PROTOCOL
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Feb. 16 (CNA)
(By Elisa Kao)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Several environmental groups protested in
front of American Institute in Taiwan's (AIT) Taipei office Wednesday
because of the Bush administration's refusal to sign the Kyoto
Protocol, which requires most signatory nations to cut greenhouse gas
emissions.
</P>
<P>
The groups, including the Taiwan Environmental Protection Union
(TEPU), presented ironic dramas describing Bush as being "responsible
for global warming."
</P>
<P>
TEPU Chairwoman Chen Shu-hua noted that the United States' carbon
dioxide emissions account for 36 percent of the world's total, No. 1
in the world.
</P>
<P>
However, she added, even though it is responsible for the
escalation of global warming, the Bush administration refused to sign
the Kyoto Protocol for the sake of the country's economic interests.
</P>
<P>
Chen urged the U.S. to assume its duty as world leader and
implement the regulations of the protocol.
</P>
<P>
She also urged the Taiwan government not to follow the incorrect
path taken by the United States and continue developing industries
that pollute. Taiwan must also not import poorly designed nuclear
power generating equipment from the U.S.
</P>
<P>
Judging from the current increase of Taiwan's carbon dioxide
emissions, the output of this greenhouse gas from the island in 2010
will be four times that of the 1990 level, Chen added.
</P>
<P>
The U.N.-initiated Kyoto Protocol requires industrialized
countries to reduce greenhouse gases to an average of 5.2 percent
below 1990 levels by 2012.

<P>
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs welcomes
Japan's decision to waive the visas requirement for Taiwan tourists,
and hopes the temporary measure will become permanent.
</P>
<P>
An ministry official said the measures approved by the Japanese
House of Councilors, or the upper house of the Diet, on Feb. 8 will
boost exchanges between the two countries and will benefit both
sides.
</P>
<P>
Under this measure, Taiwan tourists will be allowed into Japan
without a visa for a maximum of 90 days between March 25 and Sept.
30, which is timed to coincide with the Aichi World Expo to be held
in Aichi Prefecture in central Japan from March 25 to Sept. 25.
</P>
<P>
Since Taiwan has been offering Japanese tourists visa-free entry
for the past three years, the official said the ministry hope Japan
will reciprocate Taiwan's goodwill by making this temporary measure a
permanent one after Sept. 25.

<P>
More than 80 investigators led by two
prosecutors from the Hsinchu District Court searched the
semiconductor giant United Microelectronics Corp.'s (UMC) Hsinchu
headquarters and its Taipei office Tuesday amid allegations that the
company has invested in a wafer foundry in Suzhou, eastern China.
</P>
<P>
Also searched Tuesday were four venture capital companies and a
public accountant's office.
</P>
<P>
The investigators seized a number of documents and account books
for further investigation.
</P>
<P>
A former UMC senior executive, Hsu Chien-hua, who is now chairman
of the Hejian Technology in Suzhou after resigned from the UMC, was
also called in by prosecutors for questioning Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
UMC had no comment on investigations Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the company answered journalists' questions by
saying that Hsu is no longer a UMC employee and the company is in no
position to make any comment.
</P>
<P>
As the second-largest semiconductor manufacturer in Taiwan, UMC
has long been reported to be investing in Hejian without the
authorities' approval, and the fact that 24 former UMC senior
executives were recruited by Hechien en masse gave the speculations
some substance but UMC has denied any direct investment in Hejian.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan authorities have warned UMC that it would be punished
severely if it jumps the gun and invests in the mainland without the
approval of the government.
</P>
<P>
Investigators are said to be mulling the necessity to question
UMC Chairman Robert Tsao.

CHINA'S MILITARY BUILDUP COULD TILT CROSS-STRAIT BALANCE: CIA HEAD

<TEXT>
<P>
Mainland China's continuous military
buildup and modernization could tilt the strategic balance across the
Taiwan Strait and also threaten U.S. forces in Asia, CIA Director
Porter Goss warned Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Goss made the remarks at a Senate Intelligence Committee hearing
to assess the main security threats to the United States.
</P>
<P>
The CIA chief said that Beijing has significantly increased the
number of its missiles aimed at Taiwan and has commissioned several
brand new submarines over the last year.
</P>
<P>
In addition to beefing up its conventional military capability,
Beijing has stepping up efforts to develop "robust, survivable
nuclear armed missiles," he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Goss also noted that Taiwan has continued to strengthen its own
national identity in various ways, including pushing for
constitutional reform, which Beijing has seen as moves toward
independence.
</P>
<P>
"If Beijing decides that Taiwan is taking steps towards permanent
separation that exceeds Beijing's tolerance, we assess China is
prepared to respond with varying levels of force," he added.
</P>
<P>
"China is increasingly confident and active on the international
stage, " Goss said, adding that Beijing is "trying to ensure that it
has a voice on international issues and secures access to natural
resources and to counter what it sees as Untied States' efforts to
contain or encircle it."

</P>
<P>
In presenting the bill, Rep. Tom Tancredo (R-Colo.) , leading
author of the bipartisan resolution, said that the "one China"
policy, in which Washington recognizes Beijing's stance that Taiwan
is a part of China, is fiction.
</P>
<P>
"Taiwan is a free, sovereign and independent country that elects
its own leaders. It is not, nor has it ever been a local government
of communist China -- and everyone knows that," Tancredo said.
</P>
<P>
He asserted that the time has come "to scrap this intellectually
dishonest and antiquated policy in favor of a little consistency and
honesty."
</P>
<P>
"There is absolutely no good reason that the United States cannot
maintain the same kind of normal relationship with the democratically
elected government in Taiwan that it maintains with the autocratic
regime in Beijing," Tancredo continued.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that when then U.S. President Jimmy Carter decided to
sever formal ties with Taiwan and shift U.S. recognition from Taipei
to Beijing in 1979, Carter did not consult with Congress in advance,
let alone seek its approval.
</P>
<P>
Tancredo noted that despite Carter's unilateral decision to cut
diplomatic relations with Taiwan, the island has remained a staunch
and reliable ally of the United States.
</P>
<P>
The bipartisan resolution was jointly introduced by Tancredo and
four other lawmakers, including Rep. Ileana Rose-Lehtinen (R-Fla.) ,
chairman of the House International Relations Subcommittee.

AIT TAIPEI CHIEF PAYS COURTESY CALL ON NEW DPP CHAIRMAN
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei, Feb. 17 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Douglas Paal, director of the Taipei Office
of the American Institute in Taiwan (AIT), paid a visit to new ruling
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) Chairman Su Tseng-chang Thursday
and exchanged views on a variety of issues.
</P>
<P>
It marked the de facto U.S. ambassador's first visit to DPP
headquarters since Su took over the ruling party's helm earlier this
week.
</P>
<P>
Su said after their hour-long, closed-door meeting that he had
spoken with Paal on a range of topics, including his plan to visit
the United States, Taiwan's arms procurement and Beijing's proposed
"anti-secession law."
</P>
<P>
Saying that the United States is Taiwan's best friend, Su said
the DPP attaches great importance to Taiwan-U.S. relations.
</P>
<P>
"We keenly hope to forge extensive ties with various U.S. social
quarters and maintain smooth bilateral communications channels, " Su
said.
</P>
<P>
During their talk, Su mentioned that the DPP has come up with a
comprehensive plan to promote party-to-party diplomacy. "Paal
welcomed our plan, " Su said, adding that senior DPP officials,
including himself, will travel abroad to foster friendship and
cooperative programs with major foreign political parties.
</P>
<P>
Asked whether Paal had any message from U.S. authorities, Su said
only that they discussed matters of mutual concern and had common
views.
</P>
<P>
Legislator Hsiao Bi-khim, who concurrently heads the DPP's
international affairs department, said DPP chairmen have
traditionally been welcomed to visit the United States.
</P>
<P>
With two important elections to be held this year -- elections
for mission-oriented National Assembly members in May and elections
for city mayors and county magistrates in November or December, Hsiao
said it is unclear when Su might travel to the U.S., but that it was
likely to be in the second half of the year.

RAISING WATER, ELECTRICITY RATES STILL ON BACK BURNER: MOEA
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Feb.  17 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Minister of Economic Affairs Ho Mei-yueh
tried Thursday to explain remarks made a day earlier by the premier
regarding hikes in water and electricity rates by saying that any move
in that direction would depend on various factors.
</P>
<P>
Premier Frank Hsieh had said that electricity and water rates
should not be increased if bank interest rates are lower than
inflation levels. Ho said that as far as she knows, Hsieh did not
mean that key utility rates would never be raised, only that talks on
the issue have been postponed.
</P>
<P>
As to how long such talks should be delayed, Ho said, "It all
depends on the overall economic situation at home as well as how well
the utility suppliers are doing financially."
</P>
<P>
It would not be acceptable to allow the Taiwan Power Company to
go bankrupt because it could not raise rates, she added.
</P>
<P>
Ho has in the past made clear her intention to raise rates. She
said on Dec. 29 that electricity rates will be raised by no more than
NT$0.5 per unit, or one kilowatt/hour, given that Taiwan's
electricity costs NT$2.07 per unit on average, which is far less than
Japan's NT$4.8, Hong Kong's NT$3.74 and even the Philippines'
NT$3.56.
</P>
<P>
For the same reason, she said, the price of water should also be
raised, arguing that Taiwan's water rates, now NT$10.77 per ton, are
unreasonably cheap compared to NT$62.7 per ton in Germany, NT$56.7
per ton in Denmark, NT$17.5 per ton in the United States, NT$14.4 per
ton in Canada, and between NT$17 to NT$44 per ton in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Besides, Ho argued, Taiwan's water rates have remained unchanged
for 10 years. A rate hike would also discourage users from wasting
water, she said.

PROMOTING  UNITY IS PURPOSE OF RUNNING FOR KMT CHAIRMAN: TAIPEI MAYOR
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Feb.  17 (CNA)
(By Y.F. Low)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taipei Mayor and opposition Kuomintang
(KMT) Vice Chairman Ma Ying-jeou said Thursday the purpose of his
running for the party's chairmanship is to promote party unity.
</P>
<P>
Ma said he will quit the race if his decision to run causes a
split in the party.
</P>
<P>
Public concerns have been voiced that the competition between Ma
and Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng, another KMT vice
chairman, for the chairmanship may cause the party to fracture.
</P>
<P>
Ma said it is the common expectations of all KMT members to see
reforms take place within the party and that he hopes whoever is
chairman will work towards this goal to save the party.
</P>
<P>
He urged anyone running for the chairmanship to present their
respective philosophies to provide party members information on which
to base their decision when it comes time to choose their future
leader.
</P>
<P>
Ma said he believes this competition will make the KMT more
united than before.
</P>
<P>
Agreeing with Ma, Wang said every KMT member has a responsibility
to unite the "pan-blue alliance" of the People First Party and the
KMT to boost the KMT's development.
</P>
<P>
Wang would not speculate as to whether KMT Chairman Lien Chan
plans to run for re-election, and he said issues concerning the
chairmanship election were not mentioned during his conversation with
Lien over the phone on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Lien, who is currently on a trip in Europe, has not specified if
he will seek re-election. Ma had previously said that Lien has no
intention of continuing at the post.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, KMT Legislator Lee Chuan-chiao, who is a supporter of
Wang, confirmed that Ma had called him to explain why he was running
for the KMT chairmanship.
</P>
<P>
However, Lee said he does not think Ma is a suitable candidate
for the position.
</P>
<P>
Lee said Ma and Wang should play different roles within the party
and complement each other, and he suggested that the two meet in
private to exchange their views on the future development of the KMT.
</P>
<P>
Disagreeing with Lee, pro-Ma KMT Legislator Wu Yu-sheng said no
one is in a position to judge who is suitable and who is not to
become the party leader.

Wall Street Journal: Tsunami Lending in Sri Lanka, Loans Take On
Key Role In Disaster Relief

Though the world has pledged more than a US$1 billion to help Sri
Lanka care for its tsunami victims, but the relief cash has been too
slow to reach those who need them to rebuild their lives. Many
survivors are going into debt as much of the roughly US$1.1 billion
pledged internationally for Sri Lanka still hasn't arrived, and of
what has, only a small portion has made it to victims so far,
according to local aid officials. The reasons include bureaucratic
snafus and political wrangling. Aid workers note that government
officials are even impounding some donated supplies for fear they
could be delivered to insurgents such as the Tamil Tigers.

A Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA)
official expressed gratitude Thursday for a motion presented by
several U.S. congressmen calling for the restoration of diplomatic
ties with Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Victor J. Chin, director of MOFA's Department of North American
Affairs, made the remarks after several members from the U.S. House
of Representatives presented a proposal a day earlier urging the Bush
administration to abandon its "one China" policy and resume official
ties with Taiwan.

Rep. Tom Tancreado (R-Colo.) , who led the bipartisan proposal,

Chin noted that the proposal has been made before in the U.S.
Congress and expressed hope that Taiwan will gain the joint support
of both the executive and legislative branches in the United States to
carry out the plan.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Chin added that the ministry has also noticed the

<P>
Chin said the congressmen are worried that the law might have a

The opposition Taiwan Solidarity Union
(TSU) will hold a seminar on Friday to discuss mainland China's plan
to enact an "anti-secession law."
</P>
<P>
During the seminar, former president and TSU spiritual leader Lee
Teng-hui is expected to call for unity by all Taiwanese people

According to TSU officials, although the legislation is only a

allies to support the law to step up its diplomatic suppression of
Taiwan.

<P>
Under these circumstances, overseas Taiwanese who support the
cause of changing the country's official name and rewriting the
Constitution may face the risk of being extradited to the mainland
for trial, they said.

The TSU is planning to push for a piece of legislation to

his vice premier Friday in light of the fact that his attempt to
recruit opposition Kuomintang Vice Chairman P.K. Chiang was rebuffed.
</P>
<P>
Anonymous sources close to the premier said Hsieh has promised to
wait for Chiang's decision until Friday, but Chiang made his
intentions clear when he left for the United States Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The sources said Hsieh decided to ask Wu to join his Cabinet as
vice premier Tuesday evening and was greeted with a positive
response.
</P>
<P>
The premier told journalists that his choice for the post of vice
premier should be a person with training in finance and economics,
familiar with international affairs, capable of managing the
country's overall economic aspects, good at coordinating the work of
various government units and preferably not a member of the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party.
</P>
<P>
As a U.S.-educated economist, Wu meets all the requirements and
has long been an important economic advisor to the administration of
President Chen Shui-bian.
</P>
<P>
Wu scrapped a plan to go on an overseas trip at the last minute
Thursday, apparently for the purpose of attending a Friday morning
news conference at which the premier is expected to announce Wu's
appointment.

MARINES TO JOIN CAPITAL DEFENSES: MND
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Feb.  17 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A brigade of marines will be posted in
Linkou on the outskirts of Taipei from March as part of the Ministry
of National Defense's (MND's) plan to reinforce defenses in the
greater Taipei area to counter any possible "decapitation" strategy
adopted by mainland China against Taiwan, MND sources said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Decapitation strategies short-circuit command and control
systems, wipe out nationwide nerve centers and leave the opponent
hopelessly lost. Many military observers say the mainland is very
likely to use this strategy to invade Taiwan by seizing the island's
center of power, the capital and its top leaders.
</P>
<P>
Against this backdrop, MND sources said, defenses in the greater
Taipei area will be greatly beefed up. The marines to be stationed in
Linkou from March will be armed with portable air-defense missiles,
minesweeping helicopters and other rapid response weapons.
</P>
<P>
In addition, military police forces in Taipei's suburban Tachih
district will also be augmented in April by adding an artillery
regiment and an armored brigade that will be equipped with 120 mm
mortars, anti-tank rockets and Avenger air-defense missiles. In the
future, the military police unit will also purchase locally developed
"Clouded Leopard" eight-wheeled armored vehicles.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the sources said, the army division stationed in the
Kuantu-Tamsui area on the outskirts of metropolitan Taipei will also
be reinforced. Once the MND's three massive arms procurement projects
clear the legislature, the missile command in Taipei County's Taishan
township will be equipped with advanced Patriot PAC III anti-missile
batteries.
</P>
<P>
The navy is also planning to deploy fast warships at the newly
built Taipei Port, the sources said, adding that once the military's
current troops restructuring project is completed, defenses in the
greater Taipei area will be heavily fortified.

HSINCHU SCIENCE PARK SETS NEW HIGH IN OUTPUT VALUE FOR 2004
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Feb. 17 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Hsinchu Science-based Industrial Park
set a new high in output value of NT$1.859 trillion (US$59 billion)
for 2004, up by 27 percent over the previous year's level, the
Hsinchu Science-based Industrial Park Administration reported
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Despite the fact that many economic forecasting agencies have
predicted that the world economy is set to slow this year,
administration officials are optimistic that the figure will further
go up by more than 10 percent for 2005.
</P>
<P>
The semiconductor, computer and peripherals, telecommunications,
opto-electronics, precision machinery and bio-tech industries were
the major driving force behind the park's all-time high productivity,
with the semiconductor sector contributing the largest portion of its
total production value of NT$744.1 billion, or 69 percent.
</P>
<P>
In terms of the ratio of output value, the semiconductor industry
was followed by the computer and peripherals sector with 12.7
percent, the opto-electronics industry with 12.1 percent, the
telecommunications industry with 5.6 percent and the precision
machinery industry and biotechnology industry with 0.9 percent and
0.2 percent, respectively.
</P>
<P>
In terms of revenue growth rate, the precision machinery industry
increased the most by 60 percent over the 2003 level to NT$9.2
billion, followed by 39 percent for the opto-electronics and the
biotech industries, with output values of NT$131.3 billion and NT$2.5
billion, respectively. The telecom and computer industries expanded
by 10 percent and 3 percent, respectively, to hit NT$60.5 billion and
NT$138.2 billion.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, mainland China, replacing Hong Kong, became for the
first time the park's No. 1 export outlet last year, accounting for
about 20 percent of outbound shipments and registering a growth rate
of 52 percent year on year.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong, Japan, the United States and South Korea came after in
that order, while Japan, the United States, Singapore, Hong Kong and
South Korea were the leading five import sources for the park.
</P>
<P>
As of the end of last year, a total of 115,477 workers were
employed by 384 companies operating in the park, up by 13 percent and
4 percent, respectively, compared to the level of a year ago.
</P>
<P>
It marks an average per-capita production value of NT$9.4 million
for the park in 2004, with each worker in the semiconductor sector
posting the highest level of NT$111.9 million, ahead of NT$96.9
million in the computer and peripherals industry, NT$83.4 million in
the telecom industry, NT$60.5 million in the precision machinery
industry, NT$52.6 million in the opto-electronics industry and
NT$24.8 million in the biotech sector.
</P>
<P>
The Hsinchu Science-based Industrial Park in northern Taiwan, set
up in 1979, is the country's oldest and the most representative of
its kind in Taiwan. Its success serves as a text book model for many
countries keen to build similar compounds to house high-tech
businesses.

BUSINESS LEADERS PLAY DOWN IMPACT FROM INVESTIGATION OF UMC
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Feb.  17 (CNA)
(By Elisa Kao)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Several business leaders in Taiwan said
Thursday that they believe an investigation into a local
semiconductor giant's alleged ilegal investments in mainland China
will not affect Taiwanese businessmen's willingness to invest there.
</P>
<P>
Leaders of major Taiwan business groups, including the Chinese
National Association of Industry and Commerce and the National
Association of Small and Medium Enterprises of the Republic of China,
made the remarks one day after law enforcement agencies started to
investigate alleged illegal transactions as well as capital and
technology transfers between United Microelectronics Corp. (UMC) and
HeJian Technology in Suzhou, mainland China, a wafer foundry believed
to have received investment from UMC without the approval of the
Taiwan government.
</P>
<P>
Day Sheng-tung, chairman of the National Association of Small and
Medium Enterprises, said the issue is not expected to affect
Taiwanese investments there and that the investigation should be
considered an economic affair rather than a political one.
</P>
<P>
He said the government's regulations regarding Taiwan companies'
direct investment in the mainland China or Hong Kong are quite
relaxed and that local businessmen already consider Taiwan, the
mainland and Hong Kong as investment targets rather than political
entities.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Huang Mao-hsiung, chairman of the Chinese National
Association of Industry and Commerce, expressed hope that the
investigation will not cause any negative impact on Taiwanese
investment in the mainland.

JAPANESE TOURISTS VISIT KINMEN; MINI LINKS URGED TO BE OPENED WIDER
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Feb.  17  (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A group of Japanese tourists arrived
Thursday on the outlying island of Kinmen for a two-day visit, part
of a four-day Taipei-Kinmen tour organized by a travel agency based
in Osaka.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese tourists, mainly middle-aged women, were met warmly
by the Kinmen tourism authorities and local people. Kinmen County
Tourism Bureau chief Lin Chen-chia gave a gift bag to each of the
Japanese visitors.
</P>
<P>
Although most of the Japanese visitors said they did not know
much about the Taiwan-controlled island, they said they most wanted
view nearby mainland China's Xiamen from Kinmen and drink the special
Kinmen kaoliang liquor after learning something of the island's
history.
</P>
<P>
The Kinmen County Tourism Bureau and the council organized a
delegation that visited Tokyo, Osaka and Fukuoka last August as part
of efforts to attract foreign visitors.
</P>
<P>
Saying that the Kinmen county authorities have been trying hard
to push the island on to the world stage, Lin called on the central
government in Taipei to open wider the existing "mini three links,
"-- direct trade and transport services maintained between Taiwan's
Kinmen and Matsu islands and the mainland ports of Xiamen and Mawei
in Fujian Province -- to help serve that end.
</P>
<P>
According to Lin, Kinmen county is hoping to lure some of the
200,000 foreign visitors that visit Xiamen each year to travel to
Kinmen via the mini links. Should foreign tourists visiting Kinmen be
further allowed to proceed to Taiwan proper on sightseeing trips, it
would also help the government meet its target of doubling the number
of tourist arrivals by 2008.
</P>
<P>
The "mini three links" kicked off in January 2001 to offset the
absence of full links between Taiwan proper and the mainland. Direct
trade, transport and postal services across the Taiwan Strait have
been banned since 1949 after the two sides split in the wake of
acivil war.

UMC DENIES LINKS WITH HOJIAN TECHNOLOGY

<TEXT>
<P>
United Microelectronics Corp. (UMC) , a
major chip maker in Taiwan, issued a statement Thursday denying any
direct or indirect investment in HoJian Technology, located in
Suzhou, in mainland China's Jiangsu Province.
</P>
<P>
The statement was issued one day after law enforcement
authorities began to investigate UMC's alleged ilegal transactions as
well as capital and technology transfers with HoJian Technology, a
chip maker believed to have received investment from UMC without the
approval of the Taiwan government.
</P>
<P>
The UMC statement denied any personnel exchanges with HoJian, and
said that no UMC executives have ever, directly or indirectly,
invested in the mainland company.
</P>
<P>
The statement said UMC and companies associated with the group
are all enterprises with independent operations. They have never
assigned anyone in the group to work in HoJian.
</P>
<P>
However, the statement added that the company has no idea whether
any former UMC employee has worked for HoJian.
</P>
<P>
UMC said in the statement that the company has not sold any
machinery to HoJian, not has it transferred technology to HoJian, and
said it would bring a lawsuit against any semiconductor firm that
violates UMC patent rights.

CLINTON TO BE ACCORDED RED-CARPET WELCOME: MOFA
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Feb.  17 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The government will accord former U.S.
President Bill Clinton a red-carpet welcome when he visits Taiwan
later this month, a Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) official said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Victor J. Chin, director of the MOFA's North American Affairs
Department, told a news conference that in recognition of Clinton's
contributions to the promotion of substantive Taiwan-U.S. relations
during his presidency, particularly his decision to send two aircraft
carrier battle groups to patrol waters near Taiwan during the 1996
Taiwan Strait crisis, the government will accord Clinton courteous
treatment "near the level" offered to a sitting head of state.
</P>
<P>
"We'll offer him the maximum grade of security protection. The
only difference from his treatment to that of a sitting head of state
will be the absence of military honors and a 21-gun salute because
the United States does not maintain formal diplomatic ties with
Taiwan, " Chin explained.
</P>
<P>
Asked whether Clinton will meet with senior Taiwan officials and
opposition leaders, Chin said Clinton's itinerary has yet to be
finalized.
</P>
<P>
Out of respect for Taiwan, Chin said, Clinton is expected to meet
with President Chen Shui-bian during his brief visit.
</P>
<P>
Since Clinton ended his eight-year tenure, he has traveled around
the globe delivering speeches for staggering fees. Chin acknowledged
that a local private organization will pay the bill for Clinton's
speech in Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
According to Chin, the fee will be "reasonable" and will not
surprise or impress anybody. As for the exact amount, Chin said the
MOFA is not in a position to divulge such information out of regard
for general international practice and a tacit understanding with
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
According to MOFA officials, Clinton is scheduled to deliver a
speech on Asian democracy on the evening of Feb. 27 to be sponsored
by the Taiwan Foundation for Democracy and a youth association.
Clinton's exact arrival time and details of his local itinerary have
not yet been fully fleshed out, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
"We have been keeping in close contact with Clinton's office and
we hope his itinerary can be finalized soon so that we can publicize
it," said a MOFA official.

FORMER EXECUTIVE OF TAIWAN SEMICONDUCTOR GIANT RELEASED ON BAIL
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Feb. 17 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A former executive of semiconductor giant
United Microelectronics Corp. (UMC) who is at the center of a scandal
involving UMC's alleged illegal investment in mainland China, was
released on bail of NT$10 million (US$317,088) Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The prosecutors who asked the court to take Hsu Chien-hua into
custody the previous day have yet to decide whether to appeal against
the court's decision.
</P>
<P>
Hsu, who has been working as chairman of HeJian Technology Co. in
the mainland city of Suzhou immediately after leaving his job as a
senior technician at UMC in 2001, is suspected of being the UMC's
representative to HeJian and prosecutors said they have
circumstantial evidence of UMC's investment in the mainland chip
maker.
</P>
<P>
Hsu was questioned by prosecutors one day before he was slated to
return to Suzhou after spending the Chinese New Year holiday in his
home in Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
The Taiwan authorities restrict hi-tech firms from investing in
the mainland without approval.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Economic Affairs Ho Mei-yueh said the regulations for
investment in the mainland are very clear. Local firms may invest
there if they follow the regulations, which she claimed do not impose
unreasonable restrictions on would-be investors.
</P>
<P>
However, she then said her office will review the regulations if
businessmen feel they are unreasonable.

PREMIER TO PUSH FOR CONSISTENCY IN ECONOMIC POLICY
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Feb. 18 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Premier Frank Hsieh said Friday that there
should be consistency in the country's overall economic policy in
order to help the administration forge ahead with various development
projects with the private sector coping with it smoothly.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a breakfast meeting with leaders from six major
industrial and business groups, Hsieh noted that he will see to it
that major economic and development projects that were implemented or
planned during Yu Shyi-kun's term as premier will be continued.
</P>
<P>
On the prospects of Taiwan's economic development in the future,
Hsieh said that he thinks "political variables" could be major
factors that may interrupt normal development.
</P>
<P>
Hsieh, who just appointed an economist to be his deputy to
reflect his determination in reforming and propping up Taiwan's
economic and industrial progress, also said that he will push for a
more dynamic tax regime requiring all individuals and businesses to
pay at least some tax.
</P>
<P>
Noting that minimum taxation levels may be worked out in the near
future, Hsieh, who took office Feb. 1, explained that this is an
attempt to broaden the base for the government to levy taxes and
increase revenues.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, reiterating his administration's "healthy Taiwan"
motto, Hsieh called for support from the business and industrial
sectors for the government's plans to raise the top bracket of the
national health insurance premiums based on a person's monthly
salary, from the current NT$87,600 to NT$130,000, in an attempt to
avoid increasing premiums for those in the lower brackets while
saving the debt-ridden system from bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
Noting that he himself will be affected by the higher-bracket
initiative, Hsieh appealed to the industrial and business leaders to
support the plan based on a sense of social justice, saying that
individuals with higher incomes should pay more to help sustain the
cash-trapped national health insurance program.

The Straits

For the first time, patients at Ang Mo Kio
Hospital will be able to have acupuncture in 
the wards, when a full-fledged Traditional

The Lianhe Zaobao:Q4 surge pushes growth of
Singapore's economy last year to 8.4%.

Biomedical manufacturing cluster has a over-
expectation growth, and pushes the growth of
Singapore's economy last year to 8.4% from
the forecasted growth rate 8.1%.

Government officals warned of clouds on the
horizon that could take the shine off this
year's growth.

But slower growth would still mean a healthy
3% to 5% expansion, Dr. Friedrich Wu, director
of economics at the Ministry of Trade and
Industry, said yesterday.

U.S. ADMINISTRATION URGED TO STRONGLY OPPOSE ANTI-SECESSION LAW
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Washington,  Feb.  17 (CNA)
(By Jorge Liu and P.C.Tang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Several members of the U.S. House of
Representatives introduced a motion Thursday calling for the Bush
administration to voice strong opposition to China's proposed
anti-secession law.
</P>
<P>
The motion came one day after a bipartisan resolution was
introduced into the House by five legislators, including Rep. Tom
Tancredo (R.-Colo.) and Rep. Ileana Rose-Lehtinen (R-Fla.), demanding
that the Bush administration scrap its "one China policy" and resume
diplomatic relations with Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
The motion, which was introduced with Rep. Steve Chabot (R-Ohio),
co-chairman of the pro-Taiwan U.S. congressional Taiwan Caucus, as
the lead author, said that the Standing Committee of the Chinese
National People's Congress agreed Dec. 29 last year to place the
anti-secession bill on the agenda for the congress' plenary meeting
set to open March 5 this year.
</P>
<P>
Claiming that enacting the law will unilaterally change the
status quo in the Taiwan Strait, which goes against the United
States' longstanding cross-strait policy, the motion called for the
U.S. administration to express fierce opposition to the proposed law.
</P>
<P>
President Chen Shui-bian reiterated in his inauguration speech
for a second term and his Double Tenth National Day speech last year
Taiwan's determination to maintain peace, stability and the current
cross-strait status quo, the motion also said.
</P>
<P>
The motion added that the agreement reached by representatives
from the two sides of the strait Jan. 15 on direct cross-strait
charter flights during the Lunar New Year holidays ought to establish
a foundation for the development of normalization of relations and
the resumption of dialogue between the two sides of the strait.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the United States' Taiwan Relations Act, which was
enacted in 1979, is an efficient instrument for maintaining peace,
security and stability in the Taiwan Strait, the motion said that
according to the act, any actions to decide Taiwan's future that are
not peaceful and do not have the consent of the Taiwan people would
cause serious concern for the United States.
</P>
<P>
The motion also requested that the U.S. government continue to
encourage Taipei and Beijing to engage in a dialogue.

MAC OPEN TO CROSS-STRAIT 'TWO-WAY, NON-STOP' CARGO FLIGHTS
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei, Feb. 18 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) does not
exclude the possibility of opening "two-way, non-stop, multi-spot"
cargo flights across the Taiwan Strait, MAC Vice Chairman Chiu
Tai-shan said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a hearing at the Legislative Yuan sponsored by
Democratic Progressive Party Legislator Hung Chi-chang calling for a
pragmatic policy to accelerate steps toward realization of
cross-strait cargo flights, Chiu said that so long as the carriers
and the mainland-based Taiwanese businesspeople submit concrete data
indicating their needs, the government will spare no efforts to
facilitate implementation of related programs.
</P>
<P>
Chiu's remarks were a follow-up to President Chen Shui-bian's
statement two days earlier saying that he hopes that cross-strait
cargo charter flights could be started soon following the success of
the special cross-strait Lunar New Year passenger charter flights
this year.
</P>
<P>
Hailing the special Lunar New Year charter flights as a success,
Chiu stressed that so long as the private sector can agree on terms
with the administration, and the governments of the two sides of the
strait can turn "ideas into action, " then progress in the promotion
of "two-way, non-stop, multi-spot" cross-strait cargo charter flights
can be made easily.
</P>
<P>
According to a plan unveiled by the MAC in 2003 but never
implemented, the cargo charter service would be operated only by
Taiwanese carriers, and planes would be required to stop in Hong Kong
or Macau en route. However, other arrangements, such as allowing
mainland carriers to offer the service and making the charter flights
non-stop will have to be made through negotiations between the two
sides.
</P>
<P>
Chiu added that opening cargo charter flights should be a less
difficult issue than the opening of passenger charter flights and
that the MAC will remain open to talks as well as plans regarding the
implementation of cross-strait cargo charter flights.

Premier Frank Hsieh announced Friday that
Wu Rong-I, president of the Taiwan Institute of Economic Research, is
his vice premier.
</P>
<P>
Hsieh, accompanied by Lee Ying-yuan, secretary-general of the
Executive Yuan, and Cho Jung-tai, spokesman for the premier, made the
announcement at a press conference in front of the Executive Yuan.
</P>
<P>
Introducing the newly appointed vice premier, Hsieh said that Wu,

deputy has also been an economic advisor to President Chen Shui-bian
and various governmental institutions and agencies.

</P>
<P>
The premier also said that the new vice premier, who he described
as "a man of international vision, " is also a man with coordinating

</P>
<P>
Hsieh had originally sought to appoint P.K. Chiang, a vice
chairman of the opposition Kuomintang, but his overtures were rebuffed.
</P>
<P>
Saying that he will rely on Wu to integrate and coordinate the
nation's economic and financial policies, the premier added that Wu,
who has good relations with the industrial and business sectors, will
have his full support in putting the government's policies into

<P>
Newly appointed Vice Premier Wu Rong-i was
urged Friday to help improve the quality of life in Taiwan and make
the nation a better place in which to live.
</P>
<P>
Wu, a Belgium-trained economist who has been president of the
Taiwan Institute of Economic Research for several years, was formally
appointed by Premier Frank Hsieh as his deputy that day.
</P>
<P>
Chen Po-chih, chairman of the Taiwan Thinktank, who has been a
close friend of Wu for 20 years, urged Wu to help forge ahead with
the existing administrative policies, to help hammer out detailed
plans to facilitate implementation of the Ten New National
Development Projects, and to help upgrade Taiwan's quality of life.
</P>
<P>
Chen, who has also served as chairman of the Cabinet-level
Council for Economic Planning and Development, said he hopes the new
Cabinet under Hsieh's leadership will not see frequent policy
turnarounds.
</P>
<P>
The Ten New National Development Projects, which Chen described
as goals the government must achieve, needs more elaborate planning
before they can be implemented, Chen said.
</P>
<P>
Noting that both Hsieh and Wu have made great contributions to
efforts aimed at improving the environment around Taiwan, Chen called
for Wu to help make further efforts to raise the quality of life as a
top priority of the new administrative team.

CHEN-SOONG MEETING TO DISCUSS CROSS-STRAIT, SECURITY, ETHNIC ISSUES
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Feb.  18 (CNA)
(By Y.F. Low)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Cross-Taiwan Strait peace, defense and
security, as well as ethnic amity, will be the main issues on the
agenda of a long-awaited meeting between President Chen Shui-bian and
opposition People First Party (PFP) Chairman James Soong, officials
said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The agenda was agreed upon by Presidential Office
Secretary-General Yu Shyi-kun and PFP Secretary-General Chin
Chin-sheng, who were in charge of arranging the technical details of
the meeting.
</P>
<P>
The meeting will take place at the Taipei Guest House but the
date of the meeting has yet to be set, according to Yu and Chin.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Chen and Soong will seek consensus on the
three issues, on which opinion between the two sides is divided, Yu
said.
</P>
<P>
In the same way that the last Chen-Soong meeting, held four years
ago, made possible the economic development conference, the upcoming
meeting will create a fresh opportunity for political stability in
Taiwan, Yu said.
</P>
<P>
Yu said both Chen and Soong are determined and sincere about
meeting each other and that he will maintain close contact with Chin
to hammer out a date for the meeting.
</P>
<P>
A local daily reported Friday that the PFP would prefer to
postpone the meeting until after Feb. 28 in the wake of massive raids
launched by prosecutors on United Microelectronics Corp. (UMC) over
the semiconductor giant's alleged unlicensed investments in mainland
China.
</P>
<P>
While UMC Chairman Robert H.C. Tsao is known to be a close friend
of Soong and a supporter of the PFP, there has been speculation that
the raids were ordered by the ruling Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) government because of Tsao's affiliation with the PFP.
</P>
<P>
Chin admitted that some PFP members have demanded that the
Chen-Soong meeting be postponed because of the UMC incident, which he
said is more destructive than the DPP's decision to scrap the fourth
nuclear power plant more than four years ago.
</P>
<P>
PFP legislative caucus convener Liu Wen-hsiung, who is one of the
politicians supporting a postponement of the meeting, said the UMC
incident has made the political atmosphere completely improper for
such a meeting.
</P>
<P>
For this reason, Liu said, the caucus canceled a meeting set for
later Friday with Executive Yuan Secretary-General Lee Ying-yuan.
</P>
<P>
In response, DPP Policy Committee chief Ker Chien-ming urged the
PFP not to politicize the case, saying efforts to reconcile the
ruling and opposition parties should not be affected by an isolated
incident.
</P>
<P>
Ker said the UMC incident is a judicial case that should be taken
care of by the judiciary.

Council tax bills will increase by more than twice the level of

The cost of meeting pension commitments for civil servants,

public sector pension liabilities will reach £690bn in March - more
than one-and-a-half times the £417bn level of net public sector

Wall Street Journal: Harvard Clash Pits Entrenched Faculty vs.
Brusque Leader Vs. Brusque Leader.

Harvard University's secretive seven-member governing board
issued an unusual statement yesterday to stand behind the school's
president, Lawrence H. Summers, who has been criticized for a talk he
gave at a recent conference on work-force diversification. The
board's one-page letter to "the Harvard community" sets the stage for
a possible showdown between Summers and his prominent faculty
critics, who are moving toward a referendum on his leadership. Hired
more than three years ago to retool Harvard for the 21st century, the
former treasury secretary has found the hierarchical management style
common in corporations and cabinet agencies to be a tough fit for a
storied university accustomed to decision making that is
decentralized and collegial. The confrontation comes as more and more
universities, pressed financially on several fronts, have turned to
leaders with experience outside academia to reinvigorate their
institutions -- and have in turn often met resistance from faculty.

SCIENCE PARK ASSOCIATION CALLS FOR POLICY LIBERALIZATION
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Hsinchu,  Feb.  18 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Allied Association for Science Park
Industries in Taiwan urged the government Friday to accelerate the
overhaul or liberalization of regulations that are either outdated or
insufficient.
</P>
<P>
Tung Chao-chin, chairman of the association, called for the
government to pay heed to the trends of industrial developments at
home and abroad and readjust laws and regulations to meet the actual
needs.
</P>
<P>
Taking the recent incident involving semiconductor manufacturing
giant United Microelectronics Corp. (UMC) as an example, Tong said it
is a worldwide trend to allow mature high technology to be
transferred overseas when costs of production at home are
prohibitively high while demand for such production remains brisk in
the world markets.
</P>
<P>
Tung said that only by allowing these mature high technologies to
be transferred overseas, where production costs are much lower, will
Taiwan's hi-tech industries be able to maintain their international
competitiveness.
</P>
<P>
This is a trend that has been practiced for years in industrially
advanced countries such as Japan and the United States, Tung argued.
</P>
<P>
UMC was charged with illegal investing in a mainland China-based
firm and the Hsinchu prosecutors' office has stepped up a probe into
UMC after the chief of the mainland-based firm He Jian Technology,
who is aformer executive of UMC, was released on bail of NT$10
million (US$317,088) Thursday. UMC released a statement later that
day denying any wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
Tung said that the incident is adversely affecting UMC's
competitiveness and it is also shaking Taiwan hi-tech firms'
confidence in the government's resolve to help the private sector, a
development Tung said runs counter to the principle of "Taiwan First"
that the government has espoused for years.

CAL POSTS 5.6% PROFIT FROM CROSS-STRAIT NEW YEAR FLIGHTS
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Feb.  18 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
China Airlines (CAL) , Taiwan's largest
carrier, has posted a 5.6 percent profit from the four round-trip
passenger charter flights it provided across the Taiwan Strait during
the Chinese Lunar New Year holiday, a CAL executive said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a public hearing on cross-strait transportation
issues organized by a group of ruling Democratic Progressive Party
legislators, CAL Chairman Chiang Yao-chung said that even though the
unprecedented two-way, non-stop cross-strait passenger charter
flights were launched hastily and the occupancy rate fell short of
expectations, his company still managed to turn a profit.
</P>
<P>
"This means that cross-strait flight services could be
profitable," Chiang said, adding that the average passenger occupancy
rate for the CAL's four round-trip Lunar New Year cross-strait
charter flights was 60 percent.
</P>
<P>
Under a landmark cross-strait deal, six mainland Chinese airlines
and six Taiwanese carriers have been allowed to operate a total of 48
round-trip passenger charter flights between Jan. 29 and Feb. 20 for
homebound Taiwan businessmen operating in mainland China -- commonly
known as "taishang" -- for Lunar New Year celebrations.
</P>
<P>
While recognizing the significance of the flights, Chiang also
presented his views on the opening of the much-anticipated
cross-strait cargo charter flights.
</P>
<P>
Chiang said mainland China's three commercial airline groups have
only 13 all-cargo planes, while CAL alone has 17 all-cargo aircraft
and ranks seventh in the world in terms of annual cargo
transportation volume.
</P>
<P>
"We are confident of offering the best cargo transport services
should the ban on direct cross-strait cargo charter flights be
lifted, " Chiang said, adding that CAL has long been prepared to
launch such services and can begin operations soon after the two
sides of the Taiwan Strait come to terms on the issue.
</P>
<P>
As to the formula for the proposed cross-strait cargo charter
flights, Chiang said he hopes the flights can be direct and non-stop.
In the initial stage, Chiang said, the destinations can include
Taipei on the Taiwan side and Shanghai, Beijing and Guangzhou on the
mainland side. In the second stage, the mainland's Xiamen, Kunming,
Chengdu, Hangzhou and Nanjing can be included and carriers can be
allowed to extend cross-strait charter flights to major European
destinations.
</P>
<P>
In the first stage, Chiang said, cross-strait charter flights can
focus on transporting products produced by "taishang, " but he said
that products manufactured in the United States and European
countries should also be included in the second stage to maximize the
economic effects of the operations.
</P>
<P>
Direct cross-strait air and shipping links have been banned since
1949 when the Chinese communists took control of the mainland.
President Chen Shui-bian said earlier this week he hopes the two
sides can discuss the opening of cross-strait cargo charter flights
based on the successful Lunar New Year passenger charter flights.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at Friday's public hearing, a spokesman for EVA Airways,
Taiwan's second-largest carrier, said that if direct cross-strait
cargo charter flights do not open soon, local carriers will lose
opportunities to enter the vast mainland airborne cargo market.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said EVA plans to cooperate with Shanghai Airlines
in setting up a joint-venture air cargo company but he would not
elaborate.

He said the government will manage the case concerning UMC's alleged
illegal investment in a mainland Chinese wafer foundry, the HeJiang
Technology Co., under the law and will allow law-enforcement units
make an independent investigation.
</P>
<P>
The Taiwan authorities restrict high-tech companies from
investing in the mainland without approval.
</P>
<P>
Hsu Chien-hua, a former UMC executive who was taken into custody
after being suspected of being the chipmaker's representative to
HeJian, was released Thursday on bail of NT$10 million (US$317,100).
Hsu has been working as chairman of the Suzhou-based company since
leaving his job as a senior technician at UMC in 2001.
</P>
<P>
Hsu was questioned by prosecutors one day before he was slated to
return to Suzhou after spending the Lunar New Year holiday at his
home in Taiwan.

GOVERNMENT EYEING SERVICE SECTOR TO EASE KYOTO PROTOCOL IMPACT
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Feb.  18 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Cabinet-level Council for Economic
Planning and Development (CEPD) is poised to promote the service
sector as part of the government's efforts to minimize the impact of
the Kyoto Protocol on Taiwan industry, a CEPD spokesman said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The CEPD, Taiwan's highest economic policy making agency, will
swing into full gear soon to promote that goal in the coming four
years and it expects to lift the service sector's output value to
NT$8.99 trillion (US$285.4 billion) to account for 71.4 percent of
the country's gross domestic product (GDP) by that time -- an
increase from the current level of 67.8 percent, the official said.
</P>
<P>
Of the NT$8.99 trillion production value, about NT$4.78 trillion
will be generated by knowledge-intensive businesses -- some 31.9
percent of the country's GDP -- the official said, adding that around
61.39 million workers will be employed in the sector.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the government will advocate energy-saving
service businesses in the future by stepping up industrial upgrading
and added value productivity.
</P>
<P>
The Kyoto Protocol, designed to cut greenhouse gas emissions,
became effective Wednesday in more than 140 countries around the
world.
</P>
<P>
Although Taiwan is not a member of the United Nations or a
signatory to the protocol, local environmentalists have urged the
government to adhere to the pact as a constructive member of the
global village.
</P>
<P>
In response to their calls, the Industrial Development Bureau
under the Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) has made it clear that
the government, in line with a conclusion reached in a 1998 national
energy conference, will still encourage hi-tech industries rather
than traditional ones, production of which will be limited to
satisfying local demand in the future.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, various technical assistance task forces set up under
the MOEA kicked off operations that same day to help promote energy
effective measures to 2,900 large consumers in both the private and
government sectors in the coming four years, an official of the
Bureau of Energy said.
</P>
<P>
Private sector companies in the steel and electronics industries,
hypermarkets, department stores, hospitals and thermal power plants,
as well as public agencies, state-run enterprises and schools, will
be targeted by the task forces, which will provide on-the-spot
energy-saving technical assistance focusing on recycling, pollution
prevention and reuse of industrial waste water.

MAC MULLS RELAXING PASSENGER RESTRICTIONS FOR CROSS-STRAIT CHARTERS
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Feb.  18  (CNA)
(By Y.F. Low)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) Vice
Chairman Chiu Tai-san said Friday that the government might relax
passenger restrictions for cross-Taiwan Strait charter flights in the
future so that they can serve more people besides mainland
China-based Taiwanese businessmen and their dependents.
</P>
<P>
Chiu said this year's special cross-strait Lunar New Year charter
flights, which started Jan. 29 and are set to run through Feb. 20,
have been successful despite some minor shortcomings.
</P>
<P>
A total of 45 flights have been made so far, serving 9,887
passengers, Chiu pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Chiu said the government will conduct a comprehensive review and
evaluation of the charter service after it is completed and try to
seek improvements.
</P>
<P>
The government will not rule out the possibility of relaxing
passenger restrictions in the future if the problems involved can be
overcome, Chiu said.
</P>
<P>
Although the charter flights are designed to serve Taiwanese
businessmen, some unqualified passengers, such as foreign maids,
journalists and students, reportedly were found to have been allowed
to take the flights this year.
</P>
<P>
Unlike the previous Lunar New Year charter flight services in
2003, which were operated solely by Taiwanese airlines between
Shanghai and Taipei/Kaohsiung via Hong Kong/Macau, this year's
service is being jointly operated by a total of 12 carriers from
Taiwan and the mainland, with flights between
Beijing/Shanghai/Guangzhou and Taipei/Kaohsiung.
</P>
<P>
The flights are not required to land in a third location en route
this time around, although they still need to detour through Hong
Kong air space.

PRESIDENT ASKS JAPAN FOR VISA-FREE TREATMENT FOR TAIWAN TOURISTS
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei, Feb. 18 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President Chen Shui-bian urged Japan Friday
to brush aside pressure from Beijing and grant permanent visa-free
treatment to visitors from Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Chen made the call while receiving a group of Japanese visitors
composed of members of the Sino-Japanese Cultural and Economic
Association.
</P>
<P>
Chen thanked Japan for its decision to extend visa-free
privileges to Taiwan tourists during the 2005 World Exposition to be
held in Aichi from March 25 to Sept. 25, but he expressed the hope
that the Japanese government and parliament will make the measure
permanent despite pressure from Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Pointing out that Japan ignored Beijing's pressure to vote in May
last year in favor of Taiwan's participation as an observer in the
World Health Assembly, he said he strongly believes that permanent
visa-free status would not be a problem should the Japanese
government fully exercise its leverage.
</P>
<P>
He also called for support from his visitors for the signing of a
free trade agreement between Taiwan and Japan, describing it as an
urgent matter to prevent mainland China's economic expansion.
</P>
<P>
The president also boasted of his success in strengthening Taiwan
identity since he assumed the presidency for the first time in May
2000. The reasons behind his decision to step down last year from the
chairmanship of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party were to carry
out Taiwan-centric reform and to make Taiwan a sound, progressive,
beautiful and great nation, he said.

United Microelectronics Corp. (UMC)
Chairman Robert H.C. Tsao denied allegations Friday that the company
has unlawfully transferred capital, technology and human resources to
mainland China-based He Jian Technology.
</P>
<P>
Tsao made the clarification in ad space that he purchased in two
major dailies in the wake of raids by prosecutors over the past two
days on UMC over the company's alleged unlawful investments in He
Jian.
</P>
<P>
Tsao claimed that UMC only helped He Jian to begin operations but
did not make any substantial investment and thus did not violate the
government's policy on investments in the mainland.
</P>
<P>
Tsao said he made the decisions in matters regarding the case and
will take full responsibility.
</P>
<P>
According to Tsao, UMC Vice Chairman Hsuan Ming-chih helped He
Jian in its start-up to maintain cordial business relations and the
opportunity for a merger should the government on Taiwan decide in
the future to relax its restrictions on mainland investments.
</P>
<P>
Tsao denied allegations that UMC has transferred some of its
orders to He Jian, although he admitted that UMC did try to assist He
Jian in winning orders from clients.

PREMIER CALLS FOR PRAGMATIC REVIEW OF CROSS-STRAIT INVESTMENT POLICY
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Feb.  18 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The nation's policy toward commercial
exchanges with mainland China should be reviewed pragmatically in
line with the changing global economic climate and general market
trends, Premier Frank Hsieh said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Hsieh made the remarks amid growing concern about the
government's policy direction regarding high-tech companies'
investments in mainland China after prosecutors raided Hsinchu-based
United Microelectronics Corp. (UMC) , the world's second-largest
contract chipmaker, earlier this week in search of evidence of the
company's allegedly illegal mainland investment activities. Under
current regulations, chipmakers are required to apply for permission
before investing in mainland China.
</P>
<P>
Hsieh said the government has a clear-cut policy toward
cross-Taiwan Strait trade and investment, which he said has not been
completely implemented.
</P>
<P>
In his view, Hsieh said, all existing laws and regulations must
be followed and enforced for the sake of defending the government's
credibility and maintaining fair play in business.
</P>
<P>
"Poor law enforcement will not only undermine the government's
credibility but will also hurt the interests and rights of those who
faithfully obey the rules," Hsieh said.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Hsieh went on, business activities are mainly
regulated by economic rules rather than by laws. "Therefore, a
specific commercial law or rule should be pragmatically and prudently
reviewed whenever the ratio of law breakers exceeds that of law
abiders," Hsieh said.
</P>
<P>
To the best of his understanding, Hsieh said, law enforcement
authorities have received more than 800 reports about local companies
violating the existing laws in launching investment projects on the
mainland. The UMC case is one of the relatively more serious
violations, Hsieh said.
</P>
<P>
Stressing that he didn't receive any information before
prosecutors launched the raid on nine UMC offices and the residence
of one of its senior executives, Hsieh said he will not give any
directives on any specific judicial case.
</P>
<P>
However, Hsieh said, he will discuss with the Ministry of Justice
general principles for handling similar cases, including suspects'
human rights and protection of rights of investors or shareholders in
the process of investigations of any suspicious cases.

<P>
The Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU) will
launch a series of activities this month against Beijing's proposed
"anti-secession law," TSU Chairman Su Chin-chiang said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a seminar on policies to be promoted by the TSU, Su
said that his party will initiate a signature drive on Feb. 28 to
express Taiwan people's opposition to the proposed bill.
</P>
<P>
The TSU will organize a large demonstration in early March in
Kaohsiung, southern Taiwan, for the same purpose, Su added. Former
President Lee Teng-hui, who is considered the TSU's spiritual leader,
will also take part in the rally.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the meeting, Lee said that Taiwan is a sovereign and
independent nation and that it cannot accept Beijing's proposed law,
which he said obviously targets Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
As a countermeasure, Taiwan should enact a "China relations act"
or a bill in opposition to mainland China's desire to swallow Taiwan,
Lee suggested.
</P>
<P>
The 23 million people of Taiwan should make it clear to the
Beijing authorities that they will defend Taiwan's democracy, freedom
and sovereignty, he went on.

TAIWAN SOLIDARITY UNION EARMARKS 12 BILLS IT URGENTLY WANTS PASSED

<TEXT>
<P>
The Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU) vowed
Friday to introduce 12 urgent bills in this legislative session.
</P>
<P>
Lawmaker Lo Chih-ming, convener of the TSU caucus at the
Legislative Yuan, said his party has not been active enough in
initiating and acting on bills relating to the public's livelihood in
the past and will be more aggressive in the new session.
</P>
<P>
The TSU only holds 12 seats in the 225-seat Legislative Yuan.
</P>
<P>
Notable among the bills is a "China relations act, " which is
designed to make clear Taiwan's designation as a state and
crystallize its opposition to mainland China's desire to annex
Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Another bill is an "allegiance to the country act, " crafted to
ensure government employees are loyal to Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Lo said his party wants to introduce a revision to the Referendum
Law that would transfer the legislature's power to initiate a
referendum to the Executive Yuan, with the caveat that any referendum
proposed by the Executive Yuan would need the approval of the
legislature.
</P>
<P>
Other legislation that the TSU would like to see passed into law
is a sunshine bill to address allegations of ill-gotten gains by
political parties -- specifically targeting the Kuomintang -- and a
law governing the activities of political parties.
</P>
<P>
The party will also push for legislation regarding agriculture
and fishery issues, religion and a basic law for women's welfare.

<P>
President Chen Shui-bian urged the
nation's naval force Friday to play a more active strategic role in
the Taiwan Strait area and strengthen cooperation with their U.S. and
Japanese counterparts.
</P>
<P>
Chen made the remarks while attending a Chinese Lunar New Year
celebration party at the Tsoying naval base near the southern port
city of Kaohsiung.
</P>
<P>
The president took advantage of the occasion to express his
gratitude for naval officers and enlisted men for their braving bad
weather to defend national security on sea during the Lunar New Year
holiday.
</P>
<P>
"Because of Beijing's refusal to renounce the option of using
force against Taiwan, our soldiers have to keep alert during the
Lunar New Year holiday," Chen said. With its fast economic growth in
recent years, Chen said, mainland China has largely increased its
military budget. In addition to purchasing and developing advanced
weapons, Chen said, the mainland navy has also adjusted its overall
development strategy from coastal defense to building up a deep-sea
naval force. Moreover, its submarines have been very active in the
Taiwan Strait and Asia Pacific.
</P>
<P>
In the face of ever mounting mainland military threat, Chen said
the navy must beef up its defense capabilities.
</P>
<P>
"I hope local people can support the government's plan to procure
eight diesel-electric submarines and 12 P-3C anti-submarine aircraft
from the United States to beef up naval defense capabilities, " Chen
said, adding that the navy should also adjust its development
strategy and play a more active strategic role in the region and
deepen cooperation with U.S. and Japanese naval forces.

UMC CASE INDIVIDUAL, LEGAL INVESTMENT SECURE: ECONOMICS MINISTER

<TEXT>
<P>
The court case of United Microelectronics
Corp. (UMC) is an individual case and Taiwan companies will not have
any problem with their mainland-bound investments as long as they
conform to the government's regulations, Minister of Economic Affairs
Ho Mei-jueh said Friday.
</P>
<P>
UMC, the world's second-largest chip foundry after the Taiwan
Semiconductor Manufacturing Corp. (TSMC) , has been charged with
illegally passing on capital and technology to mainland-based He Jian
Technology Co. in Suzhou. UMC headquarters and factories in Taipei
and Hsinchu were searched by prosecutors on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Taiwan government bans private individuals or companies from
investing in wafer plants in mainland China without government
permission.
</P>
<P>
Stressing that local companies will not be punished by the
government if their investments in mainland China fully fall in line
with the required legal process, Ho said she hopes that the
prosecution authorities will complete their investigation into the
case and find the facts as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
Ho said that her ministry will deal with UMC in compliance with
the law should prosecutors discover hard evidence that implicates UMC
in any illegal activities with He Jian.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, He Jian issued a statement on its Web site denying any
links to UMC, emphasizing that it is an independent, foreign-owned
company that has nothing to do with the Taiwan company.
</P>
<P>
James Lee, director of the Hsinchu Science-based Industrial Park
Administration, called on Taiwan businesses to strictly follow
government rules in launching investment plans in mainland China.
</P>
<P>
Lee further said that the government should heed Taiwan
companies' needs and that it should help local enterprises break into
foreign markets amid fierce competition. But he reiterated that local
companies should abide by the law when carrying out investments
overseas, in particular mainland China, due to its sensitive
relations with Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
According to Lee, UMC applied to open an office in Shanghai a few
years ago to study and explore neighboring markets. But he added that
no unusual changes to the company's business have been found.
</P>
<P>
The administration has showed grave concern over the UMC case, as
the semiconductor industry is the major engine at the Hsinchu
Science-based Industrial Park in northern Taiwan -- the country's
oldest and most representative facilities to accommodate hi-tech
industries.
</P>
<P>
The park racked up a record revenue of NT$1.859 trillion (US$59
billion) for the whole of 2004, some 69 percent of which was
contributed by the semiconductor sector. TSMC and UMC generated
nearly 30 percent of the industry's total output value.

is to enhance economic growth and help businessmen make money.
</P>
<P>
However, the economist-turned-vice premier said Taiwan's economic
growth forecast to be 4.67 percent this year, couldn't be raised by
any single person; rather, it can only be boosted by teamwork.
</P>
<P>
He promised to coordinate the efforts of different government
branches and various sectors to achieve this goal.
</P>
<P>
As to the priority of the Executive Yuan's economic and financial
policy, Wu said it should be set by the premier and executed by
various ministries and related government agencies. What he will do,
Wu said, is to help with the exchange of views among different
ministries.
</P>
<P>
In regard to the policy concerning economic exchanges with
mainland China, the former chief of the Taiwan Institute of Economic
Research said the "no haste, be patient" policy employed by the
government under former President Lee Teng-hui was a bit on the
conservative side, and has been replaced by the policy of "active
opening, effective management."

CROSS-STRAIT SECURITY COUNTS ON U.S. ADHERENCE AND ALLIES' SUPPORT
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Washington,  Feb.  18 (CNA)
(By Oliver Lin and P.C. Tang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza
Rice said Friday that the cross-Taiwan Strait issue is one of concern
and that U.S. policy toward the region remains unchanged.
</P>
<P>
Rice also said that neither side of the strait should try to
unilaterally change the status quo and that U.S. efforts to maintain
stability in the region depend very much upon itself and its allies.
</P>
<P>
Her comments came while responding to media questions regarding a
Washington Post report that the United States and Japan will declare
after a meeting they will hold in Washington, D.C. Saturday on
bilateral security matters that Taiwan is a mutual security concern.
</P>
<P>
Pointing out that the United States and Japan have "very deep and
broad relations" to try and help bring and maintain peace and
stability in the Asia Pacific region, Rice said that Japan has also
more recently taken on a broader role in its humanitarian efforts in
Iraq and also in the cooperation to help victims of the Dec. 26
tsunami. "So in fact this is already a broad and deep relationship
that addresses most of the issues of concern, " she continued.
</P>
<P>
Rice also said that with the recognition of a one-China policy on
the basis of the three communiques and Washington's responsibility
under the Taiwan Relations Act, the policy of the United States is
very clear.
</P>
<P>
"We have cautioned all parties that there should be no attempt to
change the status quo unilaterally. That means no attempt by China to
change the status quo unilaterally, no attempt by Taiwan to change the
status quo unilaterally. And our efforts to maintain stability in the
region count very much on an American adherence and that of our
allies, of which Japan is certainly an ally, that the cross-strait
problems will be resolved peacefully, " she said
</P>
<P>
Touching on the upcoming meeting she and U.S. Defense Secretary
Donald Rumsfeld will have with Japanese Foreign Minister Nobutaka
Machimura and Defense Minister Yoshinori Ohno, Rice said they look
forward to discussing at the meeting ways to promote peace and
security in the Asia Pacific region.

TAIWAN TO HOLD TRADE FACILITATION SEMINAR: BOFT
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  Feb. 19 (CNA)

<TEXT>
<P>
Taiwan is set to hold a trade facilitation
seminar next month to share its experience of automation in dealing
with customs operations with other countries, the Board of Foreign
Trade (BOFT) under the Ministry of Economic Affairs announced
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The BOFT said the island has engaged in talks on trade
facilitation issues raised by the World Trade Organization (WTO) and
put on the agenda of the multilateral Doha Round of trade
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
It also said that trade facilitation is aimed at promoting
international trade by simplifying import and export procedures,
particularly customs clearance procedures, of WTO members.
</P>
<P>
Despite the fact that the issues have been included on the agenda
of the new round of multilateral trade talks, the BOFT said, however,
that the developing and least developed countries are worried that
they will not be capable of carrying out future decisions of the
talks.
</P>
<P>
Saying that the government has worked on the elimination of trade
obstacles and that the relevant suggestions it has raised at the Doha
talks have been welcomed by other WTO members, the BOFT said that it
will invite the developing and least developed countries to attend

U.S.-JAPAN SECURITY PACT CHANGES TO HINDER CHINESE INVASION OF TAIWAN

<TEXT>
<P>
Former President Lee Teng-hui said Saturday
that expected revisions to the U.S.-Japan Security Alliance will make
a mainland Chinese invasion of Taiwan difficult to achieve.
</P>
<P>
According to a Washington Post report, the United States and
Japan are expected to release a joint agreement in Washington
Saturday to identify security in the Taiwan Strait as their "common
strategic objective."
</P>
<P>
While giving a lecture to trainees at the Lee Teng-hui School,
Lee said that Beijing has used military force to try to intimidate
the Taiwanese people into voting for candidates it favored in three
presidential elections since 1996.
</P>
<P>
Disappointed at its failure to achieve the desired results,
Beijing has given up hope on unification through peaceful means and
is determined to achieve unification through military force,
according to Lee.
</P>
<P>
He said the mainland's plan to enact an "anti-secession law" has
received negative responses from the United States and Taiwan
because, he said, Beijing's claim that Taiwan is part of China is
totally unconvincing.
</P>
<P>
He urged Beijing to review its nationalist policy and to bring
about peace in Asia.

BLIND PEOPLE SOLICIT SUPPORT FOR  GUIDE DOG SCHOOL
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Feb.  19 (CNA)
(By Elisa Kao)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Several visually impaired people pleaded
for support from the public Saturday for the establishment of a guide
dog school in Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Yang Huan-hsieh noted that he is one of only eight blind people
in Taiwan to have obtained a licensed guide dog from the American
group "Leader Dog." With the help of the dog, his mobility and
quality of life has significantly improved, he said.
</P>
<P>
As there are still many blind people who need this kind of help,
Yang urged the public to donate money for the establishment of a
guide dog training school. Their target is to raise NT$60 million
(US$1.9 million).
</P>
<P>
Those interested in donating can do so through the more than
1,700 7-11 convenience stores around the nation, Yang added.
</P>
<P>
Chen Chang-ching, secretary-general of the Taiwan Guide Dog
Association, said there are some 50,000 blind people around the
country, but only 11 guide dogs in service.
</P>
<P>
Chen said his association hopes to set up a guide dog school
within three years to serve the blind, with support from both the
government and the private sector.
</P>
<P>
He explained that it costs some NT$1.2 million to train a guide
dog and that the association assigns guide dogs to the visually
impaired for free.
</P>
<P>
In addition, a guide dog school should have kennels, a
playground, a hospital and a dormitory for the visually impaired, as
well as training and administration offices.
</P>
<P>
According to Chen, the association has matched eight blind people
with dogs and has sent three people to receive guide dog training in
Europe and United States.
</P>
<P>
The training procedure for a guide dog is quite difficult but
interesting, Chen said.
</P>
<P>
While urging the public to extend their support for the training
of guide dogs, he advised people not to feed, touch or shout at the
dogs, as doing so could distract them from their work.

<P>
A plan by the United States and Japan to
revise their security pact to make Taiwan a mutual security concern
will send a clear warning to mainland China, a ruling Democratic
Progressive Party lawmaker said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
According to the Washington Post, the United States and Japan are
expected to release revisions to the U.S.-Japan Security Alliance in
Washington Saturday to identify security in the Taiwan Strait as a
"common strategic objective."
</P>
<P>
Lee Wen-chung, who is a co-convener of the legislature's National
Defense Committee, said that although the content is not new, the
fact that the United States and Japan are confirming this point in
their security alliance indicates that they have recognized the
precarious situation across the Taiwan Strait.
</P>
<P>
Lee pointed out that Washington and Tokyo in 1998 included in
their alliance the phrase "areas surrounding Japan that have an
important influence on Japan's peace and security, " and that
then-Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto also specified that
the Taiwan Strait was considered part of "areas surrounding Japan."
</P>
<P>
In other words, Lee claimed, the United States and Japan would
consider a war across the Taiwan Strait as an attack on Japan and
would take joint military action to defend security in the region.
</P>
<P>
According to Lee, the United States and Japan see the mainland as
a potential strategic opponent and the economic lifelines of Japan
will be severely impacted in the event of a war across the Taiwan
Strait.
</P>
<P>
He said the U.S.-Japan security alliance will thus provide
protection for Taiwan's security.

DPP LEGISLATOR TO RUN FOR NANTOU COUNTY CHIEF POSITION

<P>
Ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)
Legislator Tsai Huang-liang announced Saturday that he will
participate in a party primary for the nomination to run for the post
of Nantou magistrate in the year-end magistrate and mayoral
elections.
</P>
<P>
Tsai, a legislator-at-large born in Nantou, urged incumbent
Nantou Magistrate Lin Tzung-nan, also a DPP member, to compete with
him in the party primary to be held later this year.
</P>
<P>
Tsai noted that there is increasing dissatisfaction about the
county's development according to several surveys among residents of
Nantou County and said he decided to run for the post not only for
the sake of Nantou but also for the sustainable development of the
party.
</P>
<P>
Saying that the year-end magistrate and mayoral elections are
considered a prelude to the 2008 presidential election, Tsai said the
DPP must win the local elections to ensure its administrative
leadership.
</P>
<P>
He also issued a declaration guaranteeing not to make personal
attacks or disseminate false information about other candidates.
</P>
<P>
For his part, Lin expressed doubt about the provenance of the
"various surveys" mentioned by Tsai, claiming that it is "natural"
for a low approval rate to occur in the first term of a political
figure, citing the example of Premier Frank Hsieh, who was formerly
Kaohsiung mayor. Lin said Hsieh's approval rating was low in the
first few years of his first term as mayor, but that the rate surged
sharply in his second term.
</P>
<P>
Lin, who assumed his post three years ago, said that many
construction projects have got underway in his current term and that
these projects cannot be interrupted. He added that eight years will
be sufficient for him to realize his promises to voters.
</P>
<P>
Describing the competition in the party's preliminary vote as no
less fierce than that in the official elections, Lin said he respects
Tsai's decision to seek the candidacy.

TAIWAN AIRLINE EXECUTIVES TO VISIT BEIJING NEXT WEEK
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,   Feb.   19  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Beijing-based Civil Aviation
Administration of China (CAAC) has invited senior Taiwan airline
executives to visit mainland China next week, aviation sources said
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Michael Lo, president of the Taipei Airlines Association (TAA) ,
who concurrently serves as Mandarin Airlines president, said the CAAC
invitation is mainly aimed at celebrating the Spring Festival or the
Chinese New Year.
</P>
<P>
According to Lo, this is not the first time the CAAC has invited
Taiwan airline executives to Beijing for Spring Festival
celebrations.
</P>
<P>
"Taiwan's airline companies have all set up representative
offices in mainland China and are familiar with the CAAC officials.
We have maintained frequent exchanges. Similar Spring Festival
gatherings between the two sides have taken place in the past, " Lo
said.
</P>
<P>
In his capacity as TAA president, Lo and Pu Zhaozhou, director of
the CAAC's Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office, signed a
landmark deal in Macau Jan. 15 to allow six carriers on each side of
the Taiwan Strait to operate a total of 48 round-trip special
cross-strait charter flights between Jan. 29 and Feb. 20 to carry
mainland-based Taiwan businessmen and their families home for the
Lunar New Year celebrations.
</P>
<P>
Lo's upcoming Beijing visit has drawn attention, as media reports
have speculated that he might take advantage of the trip to discuss
the opening of direct cross-strait cargo charter flights with the
mainland authorities.
</P>
<P>
Lo said the speculation is unfounded because he will visit
Beijing in his capacity as Mandarin Airlines president, not the TAA
president.
</P>
<P>
"My upcoming Beijing visit has nothing to do with cross-strait
cargo charter flight negotiations. The Cabinet-level Mainland Affairs
Council (MAC) has not authorized the TAA to negotiate cargo charter
flight issues," Lo said.
</P>
<P>
As Beijing refuses to engage Taiwan's government, the MAC has had
to commission the private TAA to negotiate Lunar New Year charter
flights and aviation pacts with Hong Kong and Macau in the past.
</P>
<P>
During his visit, Lo said, he might exchange views with CAAC
officials on the operations of the unprecedented two-way, non-stop
cross-strait passenger charter flights during the just-concluded
Lunar New Year holiday and the long-talked-about cargo charter
flights.
</P>
<P>
"But the talks will be private in nature, not formal
consultations," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
The media reports had claimed that Lo and senior executives of
other Taiwan carriers, such as China Airlines, UNI Airways and
TransAsia Airways, will travel to Beijing Feb. 22 to meet with CAAC
officials, including Pu, on the cargo charter flight issues. The
reports also quoted mainland sources as saying that Beijing will not
oppose a proposal that the cargo charter flight negotiations follow
the model set in January's holiday charter flight talks that took
place in Macau.

CHEN-SOONG MEETING PENDING DPP'S CROSS-STRAIT INVESTMENT POLICY: PFP
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Feb.  19  (CNA)

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Opposition People First Party (PFP)
Chairman James Soong might meet President Chen Shui-bian next week if
the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) government responds
positively to a call to relax restrictions on investment in mainland
China, PFP officials said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Top aides of Chen and Soong met Friday to discuss the technical
details of the Chen-Soong meeting but failed to set a date for it.
</P>
<P>
PFP politicians claimed that the atmosphere was improper at
present for such a meeting in the wake of raids launched by
prosecutors on semiconductor giant United Microelectronics Corp.
(UMC) over alleged unlawful investments made by the company in the
mainland.
</P>
<P>
UMC Chairman Robert H.C. Tsao is known to be a close friend of
Soong and a supporter of the PFP.
</P>
<P>
According to the PFP officials, the UMC case indicates that the
government's policy toward the mainland is already out of date and
that it is necessary for the opposition to push the government to
address the problems faced by local industry and to seek to relax its
policy.
</P>
<P>
The Chen-Soong meeting will only be meaningful if the DPP
government is willing to change its cross-Taiwan Strait policy, the
officials said.
</P>
<P>
Liu Wen-hsiung, convener of the PFP legislative caucus, said the
UMC case has sent a shockwave across the hi-tech sector and has cast
doubt on the DPP's sincerity in seeking political stability through
the Chen-Soong meeting.
</P>
<P>
Chen Wen-tzung, a spokesman for the Presidential Office, said the
opinions of the PFP have been heard and that the president's aides
will keep in contact with the PFP to try to hammer out a date for the
meeting.
</P>
<P>
Presidential Office officials claimed the president has always
been sincere about meeting Soong, but they said the UMC incident is a
judicial case in which the president is in no position to interfere.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, DPP Policy Committee head Ker Chien-ming urged the PFP
not to delay the meeting any longer, saying that it should not be
linked to the UMC case.
</P>
<P>
Ker proposed that Chen and Soong seize the opportunity of the
meeting to exchange their views on problems concerning local
industry.
</P>
<P>
Lo Chih-ming, convener of the opposition Taiwan Solidarity Union
legislative caucus, said his party is opposed to the PFP's attempt to
use the Chen-Soong meeting as a bargaining chip.
</P>
<P>
Until related laws are amended, any investments in the mainland
without the government's approval are illegal, Lo pointed out.

U.S. SCHOLARS TALK ABOUT CROSS-TAIWAN STRAIT SECURITY
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Washington,  Feb. 19 (CNA)
(By Oliver Lin and Elisa Kao)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An American scholar said Saturday that
discussions between the United States and Japan about security in the
Taiwan Strait should not surprise anyone, as apart from China and
Taiwan, these are the only two countries that are likely to become
militarily involved in case of a conflict across the Taiwan Strait.
</P>
<P>
Bonnie Glaser, a senior researcher at the Washington-based Center
for Strategic and International Studies, made the remarks following
reports that the United States and Japan are expected to revise their
security agreement to make Taiwan a security concern for both
countries.
</P>
<P>
Glaser said that concerns about a growing mainland military
buildup are rising in Japan and there are also worries about the
possible use of force against Taiwan, as well as the presence of
Chinese submarines in Japanese waters.
</P>
<P>
As allies, both the United States and Japan share interest in
preserving peace and stability in the region, Glaser said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, professor Edward Friedman from the University of
Wisconsin, noted that Taiwan's real security lies in the respect of
the mainland to Taiwan's identity, as Russia does with Finland and
Britain does with Ireland.
</P>
<P>
It does not serve the long-term interests of the Taiwanese people
that cross-strait relations are in a dilemma where each side feels it
is responding defensively to the other side and does not respect the
interest of the other side or understand the "ratcheting-up"
consequences of its own actions, Friedman said.
</P>
<P>
Noting that a military buildup and tension will not serve the
interests of peace and prosperity in the region, Friedman claimed
that the mainland is not aware of the long-term impact of its
decision to target Taiwan with missiles in an attempt to threaten the
island into submitting to its demand that Taiwan accept status under
which Hong Kong is ruled by Beijing.
</P>
<P>
"What is needed now is a way and a forum for both sides of the
strait to talk and understand each other and back away from any
further increase of tensions, " Friedman said, adding that the
mainland's President Hu Jintao and Taiwan's President Chen Shui-bian
should cooperate, with the mainland taking the first step away from
its military threat in order to eliminate the tension, which will be
in the interest of all the people in the Asia-Pacific region.

U.S., JAPAN CONCERNED AT MILITARY BUILDUP BY MAINLAND CHINA: ANALYSTS
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Feb.  19 (CNA)

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The rapid military buildup by mainland
China is making the United States and Japan worried that it might
tilt the military balance across the Taiwan Strait, analysts said
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on a plan by Washington and Tokyo to release a joint
agreement to identify security in the Taiwan Strait as a "common
strategic objective, " National Sun Yat-sen University Professor
Andrew Yang said the move indicates that the mainland's military
activities in the Western Pacific are making them nervous.
</P>
<P>
Yang said the cross-strait military balance is altering and that
the United States and Japan must be prepared for all possible
contingencies.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, national policy adviser Luan Ming said that by making
the declaration, the United States and Japan are trying to warn
Beijing against waging a war in the region.
</P>
<P>
According to Luan, Japan used to avoid touching on the Taiwan
Strait issue, but the security threat posed by the mainland's
military buildup in the Asia-Pacific region has forced Japan to take
a position.
</P>
<P>
Luan said the United States does not wish to see Beijing or
Taiwan try to change the cross-strait status quo unilaterally and is
very unhappy with Beijing's plan to enact an "anti-secession law"
providing legal means to deal with the Taiwan issue through
non-peaceful means.
</P>
<P>
He said the United States and Japan are sending a message to
Beijing that they will not sit idly by in the event of a war across
the Taiwan Strait.

TAIWAN'S MOBILE INTERNET USAGE RATE LESS THAN THOSE OF NEIGHBORS
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Feb. 19 (CNA)
(By Elizabeth Hsu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The results of a recent global survey show
that Taiwan's mobile Internet usage rate in 2004 reached 43 percent,
lagging behind Japan's 64 percent, South Korea's 51 percent and Hong
Kong's 55 percent.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan's authoritative Web site, the Focus on Internet News and
Data (www.find.org.tw) , organized and operated by the Advanced
e-Commerce Institute and the Institute for Information Industry,
along with similar facilities in other countries and areas including
Japan, South Korea, Hong Kong, the United States, Finland and Greece,
conducted the "Worldwide Mobile Internet Survey" simultaneously in
October and November in an effort to study mobile Internet
developments and trends.
</P>
<P>
According to survey results, Taiwanese users spent an average of
21.3 minutes on mobile Internet services in the most recent month
that the poll was carried out, compared with 22.1 minutes in South
Korea, 29.1 minutes in Hong Kong and 33.5 minutes in Japan.
</P>
<P>
The figures reflect the fact that there is ample room in the
Taiwan market for mobile network service providers to expand their
business, according to a report by the Web site.
</P>
<P>
In terms of the monthly amount of money that online users paid
for their mobile Internet services in 2004, Taiwan also saw the
smallest average figure of NT$168.6 (US$5.36) among its neighbors,
while Japanese users spent NT$671.9 on average, followed by NT$301.6
in South Korea and NT$204.1 in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
The results also show that in Japan, the most popular mobile
Internet service was the E-mail service, with the most recent usage
rate recorded at 85 percent. In the case of other mobile online
services, those for downloading pictures and telephone ring tones
were also frequently used in the countries conducting the survey.

PREMIER SINGLES OUT FIVE PRIORITY BILLS
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Feb.  19 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Premier Frank Hsieh has singled out five
legislative bills that he hopes can clear the legislative floor soon
after the new legislative session opens Feb. 25, Cabinet spokesman
Cho Jung-tai said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The five bills involve measures to bolster the tottering national
health insurance program, the restructuring of the Executive Yuan,
the special statute regarding three massive arms procurement
projects, revisions to the rules of operation of the mission-oriented
National Assembly and the special statute concerning a planned world
exposition in 2008, Cho said.
</P>
<P>
According to Cho, Hsieh called during a working lunch with
legislative whips of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)
and several government officials for quick legislative passage fo the
five urgent bills.
</P>
<P>
Those present at the lunch at Hsieh's official residence included
Vice Premier Wu Rong-i, Cabinet Secretary-General Lee Ying-yuan,
Legislator Ker Chien-ming, who concurrently heads the DPP's policy
coordination commission, two new DPP whips in the legislature -- Chao
Yung-ching and Chen Ching-chun -- and Cho himself.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Cho said the premier also promised to assign
more aides to strengthen engagements and consultations with the
Legislative Yuan in order to win the legislature's support for the
administration's policy initiatives and reform programs.
</P>
<P>
In the past five years, the hostile opposition-controlled
Legislative Yuan has stonewalled the passage of many critical bills
and has boycotted the implementation of a number of reform programs
at nearly every turn.
</P>
<P>
Since Hsieh assumed the premiership, he has made inter-party
reconciliation and cooperation one of his priorities. Dubbing his
team a "Cabinet of consultations, " Cho said Hsieh has assured DPP
legislative whips that he will deliver on his promise to strengthen
communications and consultations with the legislature before floating
any major policy initiatives or bills.

<P>
Taiwan will make a bid for the right to
host the 20th World Orchid Conference and Exhibition scheduled for
2011, the Council of Agriculture (COA) said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the World Orchid Conference is the highest-level
global meeting on orchid cultivation and development, COA officials
said that hosting such an event will help further upgrade the
worldwide competitiveness of Taiwan's orchid industry.
</P>
<P>
"Taiwan has long been lauded as a kingdom of orchids and accounts
for more than 70 percent of the world's total orchid exports. We are
qualified to sponsor the world orchid congress and exhibition, " said
a senior COA official.
</P>
<P>
According to COA tallies, Taiwan's orchid gardens cover more than
500 hectares of land and its annual orchid production amounted to
US$74 million. Taiwan plays an influential role in the world orchid
market, the official said.
</P>
<P>
The 18th World Orchid Conference and Exhibition will be held in
Dijon, France March 11-20, 2005.
</P>
<P>
"We'll organize a delegation to take part in the upcoming world
orchid conference and show and to lobby the support for our bid to
host the 2011 event," the official said.
</P>
<P>
Singapore and South Africa reportedly are also interested in
hosting the 2011 world orchid congress, the official said, adding
that Taiwan will step up efforts to seek other countries' support for
its bid.

MAN SEIZED FOR INTENDING TO SMUGGLE FAKE COINS INTO TAIWAN
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Kinmen,  Feb.  19 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A man was arrested at an airport on the
frontline island of Kinmen Saturday for allegedly intending to
smuggle bogus NT$50-denominated coins into Taiwan from mainland
China, aviation police said.
</P>
<P>
Tsou Wen-feng, 56, was originally scheduled to take a Mandarin
airlines flight from Kinmen to the central Taiwan city of Taichung
after arriving on the nation's offshore defense outpost via the
direct "mini three links" route from Xiamen in mainland China's
Fujian province.
</P>
<P>
Tsou was intercepted after security officers at Kinmen's Shangyi
Airport detected "suspicious articles" in his carry-on baggage by
X-ray. Aviation police later uncovered 1,377 NT$50-denominated fake
coins in the baggage.
</P>
<P>
It marked the first time that a Taiwan businessman operating on
mainland China has ever tried to smuggle counterfeit coins into
Taiwan via the "mini three links" route.
</P>
<P>
Tsou, who has previous criminal records of burglary and fraud,
claimed that he bought the fake coins in an antique shop in Beijing
for 1,300 yuan or renminbi (about NT$5,200).
</P>
<P>
Aviation police have transferred the case to the Kinmen
Prosecutor's Office for further investigations, including his
motivation and the possible flow of the fake coins.
</P>
<P>
Police said they will also look into why Tsou had managed to pass
security checks at Xiamen and Kinmen ports.
</P>
<P>
"The mini three links" refer to direct trade, postal and shipping
links between Taiwan's two outlying defense outposts of Kinmen/Matsu
and Fujian's Xiamen/Mawei. Only Kinmen/Matsu residents and Taiwan
businessmen operating in Fujian area and other selected groups of
Taiwan people are eligible to use the direct "mini three links"
shipping services.

<P>
President Chen Shui-bian attended the
light-up ceremony for the 2004 Taipei Lantern Festival Saturday at
the Taipei City Hall plaza.
</P>
<P>
Chen joined Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou in lighting up a theme
lantern to mark the start of a series of festive activities in
cerebration of Lantern Festival which falls on Feb. 23 this year.
</P>
<P>
It marked the first time that Chen attended the light-up ceremony
for the Taipei Lantern Festival in his capacity as president. The
annual event was launched during Chen's tenure as Taipei mayor from
1994 to 1998.
</P>
<P>
Chen said he took great pleasure in attending the ceremony,
saying he was impressed by the "lantern tunnel" along the tree-dotted
Jen Ai Road that links the Presidential Office to the Taipei City
Hall. The road, decorated with numerous lanterns and small light
bulbs, now looks like a "lantern tunnel."
</P>
<P>
Noting that Lantern Festival, which falls on the 15th day of the
first month on the lunar calendar, has traditionally marked the end
of Lunar New Year celebrations, Chen said he hopes all local people
will start hard work after the festival.
</P>
<P>
"Our country endured man crises and difficulties in the past
year. The new Year of the Rooster is like a 'blank' paper which is
full of promise. Let's work even harder from now on to create even
brighter future for our country," Chen said.
</P>
<P>
In related news, Premier Frank Hsieh attended the Pinghsi Sky
Lantern Festival light-up ceremony in Pinghsi on the outskirts of
Taipei.
</P>
<P>
Hsieh wrote eight Chinese characters on a big sky lantern to pray
for reconciliation, co-existence and progress in the new year.
</P>
<P>
"I keenly hopes the sky lantern will bring good fortune, peace
and prosperity to Taiwan and all mankind around the world, " Hsieh
said.
</P>
<P>
The activity was organized by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs
(MOFA) and attended by more than 40 foreign ambassadors and
representatives stationed in Taipei as well as tens of thousands
local people to pray for world peace and security.
</P>
<P>
Foreign diplomats signed their names with calligraphy brushes on
five huge lanterns that were lit and allowed to rise into the sky,
hot air balloon-style, in a gesture to appeal for world peace.
</P>
<P>
The activity was designed to help foreign envoys gain a better
understanding of Taiwan's traditions and lifestyles and offer them an
opportunity to spread love, care and compassion to the rest of the
world jointly with the Taiwan people, MOFA officials said.
</P>
<P>
The activity was also meant to thank the many anonymous donors
who contributed to the tsunami refugees in Southeast Asia and South
Asia, the officials said, adding that the ROC government and private
sector contributed more than NT$2 billion (US$63.5 million) and 3.55
million tons of relief materials to various tsunami-affected
countries.

A panel of experts voted unanimously on
Friday to advise the Food and Drug
Administration that three leading painkillers
- Celebrex, Bextra and Vioxx - can cause
worrisome heart problems. But it also advised
against banning the drugs, though by narrow
margins in the cases of Bextra and Vioxx. Most
of the advisory panel's members said that the
agency should do the following: place warnings
on the drugs' labels detailing their heart
risks; ban consumer advertising for the drugs;
and require each prescription to include a guide
outlining the risks.

New York Times: Audit Faults U.S. for Its
Spending on Port Defense

The Department of Homeland Security has allocated hundreds of
millions of dollars to protect ports since Sept. 11 without
sufficiently focusing on those that are most vulnerable, a policy
that could compromise the United States' ability to better defend
against terrorist attacks, the department's inspector general has
concluded. The audit found that hndreds of thousands of dollars has
been invested in redundant lighting systems and unnecessary technical
equipment, but "the program has not yet achieved its intended results
in the form of actual improvement in port security." The audit report
indicated that lless than a quarter of the US$517million that the
department distributed in grants between June 2002 and December 2003
had been spent as of September 2004.

DPP WHIP SAYS PFP MUST NOT DERAIL PLANNED CHEN-SOONG MEETING
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Feb.  20  (CNA)

<TEXT>
<P>
Postponing a planned meeting between
President Chen Shui-bian and opposition People First Party (PFP)
Chairman James Soong would cast a shadow over the credibility of the
PFP and disappoint the public, ruling Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) whip Lai Ching-the said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was to have been sometime before the start of the new
legislative session on Feb. 25, but the PFP has cooled on the idea
since an investigation into possible illegal investments in mainland
China by semiconductor giant United Microelectronics Corp. (UMC) was
undertaken. The chairman of the company, Robert Tsao, is a PFP
supporter.
</P>
<P>
Lai said the Chen-Soong meeting should not be linked with the
possible case against UMC as it is a judicial probe that has nothing
to do with politics.
</P>
<P>
UMC is alleged to have invested without the permission of the
Taiwan government in a Suzhou, southern China-based chipmaker, He
Jian Technology. Tsao has denied the allegations.
</P>
<P>
It is inappropriate for the PFP to postpone the proposed
Chen-Soong meeting to try and gain leverage over the outcome of the
UMC investigation, Lai said, adding that the image of the judicial
branch of government would be sullied if it were less than impartial,
as Soong seems to be implying.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the image of the PFP would be tarnished if it actually
believes that the president could meddle in judicial affairs.
</P>
<P>
The Chen-Soong meeting is aimed at creating an atmosphere for
reconciliation among competing parties and thereby lay the groundwork
for some form of cooperation between the DPP and the PFP, Lai said.
It is not an exercise in political horse-trading, which would benefit
no one and prompt a backlash from the general public, Lai went on.
</P>
<P>
Noting that preparations for the Chen-Soong meeting have already
begun, Lai urged Soong not to disappoint the public by pulling the
plug at the eleventh hour.

MOFA WELCOMES INCLUSION OF TAIWAN IN U.S.-JAPAN SECURITY STATEMENT
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Feb.  20 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs Sunday
welcomed the new U.S.-Japan joint security statement, in which
cross-Taiwan Strait issues are included for the first time.
</P>
<P>
The United States' security alliance with Japan forms the
backbone of U.S foreign policy in Asia.
</P>
<P>
The joint security statement, announced upon the conclusion of
the U.S.-Japan Security Consultative Committee in Washington, D.C.
Saturday, indicated that both Japan and the United States will
develop a cooperative relationship with China, welcoming it to play a
responsible and regionally and globally constructive role.
</P>
<P>
The statement also indicated that Japan and the United States
encourage the peaceful resolution of issues concerning the Taiwan
Strait through dialogue.
</P>
<P>
Saying that he was pleased that cross-strait issues were included
in the security statement as common strategic objectives of Japan and
the United States, foreign ministry spokesman Michel Lu said that
Taiwan attaches great importance to maintaining peace across the
Taiwan Strait, and that Taiwan is committed to securing peace,
stability and sustainable development in the Asia-Pacific region.
</P>
<P>
The text of the official statement, however, was not identical to
what was reported earlier in the Washington Post that said that "the
United States and Japan will declare Saturday for the first time in a
joint agreement that Taiwan is a mutual security concern." Commenting
on this, Lu said that " although the official statement differs from
the media report, their spirits are perceptibly the same."
</P>
<P>
On what roles the United States and Japan are expected to
play in matters concerning cross-strait security in the future, Lu
said that it is still too early to speculate on any "concrete moves,"
although the statement is believed to be conducive to peaceful
development across the Taiwan Strait in the long run.

Talk With Putin Will Test Bush's
Inaugural Pledges.

The last time they sat down, President Bush politely asked
President Vladimir Putin about Russia's retreat from democracy.
Putin, according to U.S. officials, responded with a testy tirade on
Russian history, filibustering for so long that Bush, left with an
extended list of other issues to cover in a short private lunch, let
the matter go without challenging the former KGB colonel.

'PAN-BLUE ALLIANCE' URGED TO OPPOSE CHINA'S 'ANTI-SECESSION LAW'
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Feb. 20 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Scholars urged political leaders from the
"pan-blue alliance" of the Kuomintang (KMT), People First Party (PFP)
and New Party Sunday to come forward and oppose mainland China's
attempt to enact an "anti-secession law."
</P>
<P>
At a seminar organized by several pro-independence groups to
discuss Taiwan's options to counter Beijing's attempts to bring
Taiwan into its fold, Hsu Young-ming, a researcher at Academia
Sinica, recommended that the Taiwan Solidarity Union, which is the
leading organizer of a Feb. 28 protest against mainland China's
proposed legislation, ask leaders of the "pan-blue alliance" to side
with them on this issue.
</P>
<P>
Noting that KMT Vice Chairman and Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou is
expected to run for president in 2008, Hsu said Ma is likely to be
amenable to joining the protest to fend off Beijing's attempt to
enact a law purporting to prevent Taiwan from seeking independence.
</P>
<P>
Once Ma joins the protest, Hsu said, KMT Chairman Lien Chan and
PFP Chairman James Soong are almost certain to follow suit, Hsu
optimistically predicted.
</P>
<P>
Wu Shu-ming, chairman of the Northern Taiwan Society, told the
seminar that the joint statement issued the previous day in
Washington by the United States and Japan that encourages the
peaceful resolution of issues concerning the Taiwan Strait is an
unveiled warning to mainland China against its military threat to
Taiwan. This statement is beneficial for Taiwan, he added.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan should make good use of this opportunity to air its
opposition to Beijing's proposed "anti-secession law," and drive home
to the international community the danger posed by such a law to
Taiwan, Wu said.
</P>
<P>
He urged the government to respond in a high-profile manner to
the proposed bill, preferably in conjunction with the international
community, since the world will not even notice what Beijing is doing
if Taiwan remains silent.
</P>
<P>
Also at the seminar was Lin Hsiang-kei, a professor from National
Taiwan University. He questioned Taiwan's policy of dealing with
matters of politics and economics differently regarding the mainland
when China treats them the same when it comes to Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
The economist said international rating firms considered Taiwan's
business environment excellent in 2000 when the Democratic
Progressive Party took power; however, foreign investors got cold
feet afterward because of the island's decision to allow domestic
manufacturers to relocate their operation to the mainland. If local
businessmen are scrambling into the mainland market, how can the
government convince foreigners to invest in the island deserted by
its own businessmen?
</P>
<P>
The island is nursing a viper by funnelling so many investment
projects to the mainland, Lin warned, adding that this will give
Beijing an easy weapon to control the island through Taiwan's heavy
economic interdependence on China.

PREMIER WELCOMES INTERNATIONAL ATTENTION TO TAIWAN ISSUE

<TEXT>
<P>
Premier Frank Hsieh said he welcomes the
international community's concern about peace across the Taiwan
Strait after the U.S. and Japan listed the peaceful resolution of
cross-strait issues as one of their joint strategic objectives in the
region.
</P>
<P>
Noting that peace resolution of issues between Taiwan and the
mainland would serve the interests of both sides of the Strait, the
premier said he would like to see more attention paid to the issue by
the international community.
</P>
<P>
As to the review conducted by Washington and Tokyo about the
geographical scope covered by their joint defense pact, Hsieh said
his administration will monitor the situation, but he cautioned his
fellow countrymen not to expect too much from it.

TAIWAN READY TO CUT BACK ON 'OVER-PACKAGING' OF PRODUCTS
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei, Feb. 20 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taiwan is preparing to notify other members
of the World Trade Organization (WTO) about a draft bill concerning
efforts to limit excessive product packaging, authorities from the
Environmental Protection Administration (EPA) said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The draft bill, still in the pipeline at the EPA, is meant to
notify WTO members about Taiwan's regulations and standards on
product packaging in an attempt to minimize the negative impact on
the environmental and to ensure that regulations, standards, testing
and certification procedures do not create unnecessary obstacles or
technical barriers to international trade, EPA officials said.
</P>
<P>
The contents of the draft bill are expected to be posted on the
WTO Technical Barriers to Trade (TBT) Web site beginning later this
month to allow interested parties from other WTO members to become
acquainted with Taiwan's regulations on future product packaging, EPA
officials noted.
</P>
<P>
Since consistent international standards do not exist, EPA
officials said, the EPA is drafting Taiwan's own statute to limit
excessive packaging of products, while taking into consideration that
the impact of the statute must not cause problems regarding trade
with other WTO members.
</P>
<P>
The early notification is being done so that amendments can still
be introduced and comments taken into account, EPA officials said.
</P>
<P>
Technical regulations and product standards vary from country to
country. Having many different regulations and standards makes life
difficult for producers and exporters, EPA officials noted.
</P>
<P>
According to the EPA-drafted "over-packaging control draft bill,"
the outer package of a product must not exceed 25 percent of the
product's volume or size, and no outer wrapping should exceed three
layers.
</P>
<P>
The bill, which will contribute to reducing the waste of
materials and resources, as well as reducing the labor needed in
waste handling, is expected to be enacted and publicized next May and
take effect next July at the earliest, EPA officials said.
</P>
<P>
It is expected that after the "over-packaging control law" takes
effect, Taiwan's packaging designs will move toward a
"material-saving, easy-to-recycle direction, " the officials said,
adding that the volume of packaging materials is expected to be
reduced by 6,900 tons a year, about one-third of the volume that is
used islandwide currently.

JAPAN'S 'CHINA PHOBIA' CHANGING: DPP LAWMAKER
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Feb.  20 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Japan's anxiety over Communist China has
gradually eased, underlined by its willingness to explicitly agree in
a joint U.S.-Japan security statement that Japan and the United
States encourage the peaceful resolution of issues concerning the
Taiwan Strait through dialogue, a Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)
legislator said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Tang Bi-a, the Tainan-based DPP legislator who maintains close
connections with Japanese politicians, said that although Japan and
the United States were not specific on protecting Taiwan's security
in the new U.S.-Japan joint security statement, it is historically
significant that the two governments included cross-Taiwan Strait
issues as one of their common strategic objectives for the future.
</P>
<P>
Tang added that Japan and the United States did not explicitly
indicate in the joint statement that "Taiwan is a mutual security
concern" as the Washington Post predicted earlier to save face for
Beijing and to avoid irritating Chinese at the same time.
</P>
<P>
The United States' security alliance with Japan forms the
backbone of U.S foreign policy in Asia.
</P>
<P>
The joint security statement, announced upon the conclusion of
the U.S.-Japan Security Consultative Committee in Washington, D.C.
Saturday, indicated that both Japan and the United States will
develop a cooperative relationship with China, welcoming it to play a
responsible and regionally and globally constructive role.

what was reported Friday in the Washington Post that said that "the
United States and Japan will declare Saturday for the first time in a
joint agreement that Taiwan is a mutual security concern."
</P>
<P>
Tang commented that it has been difficult for the Japanese
government to make major changes in its policy on mainland China,
although Japan's stance on Beijing has been changing gradually as a
result of Beijing's bullying attitude toward Japan and other
countries.
</P>
<P>
Tang said she will trying harder in the future in efforts to push
for the Japanese government to take a harder attitude toward Beijing
to reflect the facts.

U.S.-JAPAN STATEMENT REAFFIRMATION OF ASIAN ROLE: ANALYST
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,   Feb.   20  (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The newly released joint United
States-Japan statement that included a reference to desiring peace in
the Taiwan Strait was not made to contain mainland China; rather, it
emphasized the maturing alliance between Japan and the U.S. in the
Asia-Pacific region, a political analyst from a Taiwan think tank
said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Lai I-chung, director for the Department of International Affairs
at Taiwan ThinkTank, said although the U.S.-Japan joint statement
said the two countries "encourage the peaceful resolutions of issues
concerning the Taiwan Strait through dialogue" rather than list
"Taiwan security" as their joint concern as reports had forecast, it
doesn't means the reports are false.
</P>
<P>
"Officials from the Japanese foreign ministry indicated that 'the
security of the Taiwan Strait' would be listed among the joint
strategic objectives of Japan and the United States," Lai said.
</P>
<P>
The statement showed that Japan has joined hands with the United
States in assuming a role as the manager of international order in
the area in line with its increasing strength and globalization.
</P>
<P>
In case of a military conflict between Taiwan and China, Lai
predicted that Washington would not sit idly by and Tokyo would give
logistic support to whatever military action is taken by the United
States, but would stop short of participating in the conflict itself.
</P>
<P>
He recommended that Taipei authorities reach out to this new
accord through exchanges with Japan and the United States in the
fields of economics, the military and anti-submarine warfare.

FULL TEXT OF JOINT U.S.-JAPAN SECURITY COMMITTEE STATEMENT
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Washington,  Feb.  19 (CNA)
(By Huang Kwang-chun &amp; Jorge Liu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mainland China and North Korea were
main concerns of a meeting of the U.S.-Japan Security Consultative
Committee held Saturday in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
A joint statement, issued by the committee after U.S. Secretary
of State Condoleezza Rice and Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld,
Japan's Minister for Foreign Affairs Nobutaka Machimura and Minister
of State for Defense and Director-General of the Defense Agency
Yoshinori Ohno concluding the one-day meeting, indicated that new
threats are also emerging in the Asia-Pacific region and that
modernization of military capabilities in the region requires
attention.
</P>
<P>
To encourage China to improve transparency of its military
affairs and to encourage the peaceful resolution of issues concerning
the Taiwan Strait through dialogue were listed in the statement as
part of U.S.-Japan common strategic objectives in the region.
</P>
<P>
The ministers also strongly urged North Korea to return to the
six-party talks expeditiously and without preconditions, and to
commit itself to complete dismantlement of all its nuclear programs
in a transparent manner subject to verification.
</P>
<P>
The full text of the joint statement is as follows:
</P>
<P>
1. United States Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and
</P>
<P>
 Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld hosted Japan's Minister
</P>
<P>
 for Foreign Affairs Nobutaka Machimura and Minister of State
</P>
<P>
 for Defense and Director-General of the Defense Agency
</P>
<P>
 Yoshinori Ohno in a meeting of the Security Consultative
</P>
<P>
 Committee (SCC) in Washington, DC, on February 19, 2005. They
</P>
<P>
 addressed security and alliance issues facing the United
</P>
<P>
 States and Japan, as well as other aspects of the
</P>
<P>
 relationship. Working Together on Challenges Facing the World
</P>
<P>
 Today
</P>
<P>
2. The Ministers noted the excellent state of cooperative
</P>
<P>
 relations between the United States and Japan on a broad array
</P>
<P>
 of security, political, and economic issues. They looked to
</P>
<P>
 expand that cooperation, recognizing that the U.S.-Japan
</P>
<P>
 Alliance, with the U.S.-Japan security arrangements at its
</P>
<P>
 core, continues to play a vital role in ensuring the security
</P>
<P>
 and prosperity of both the United States and Japan, as well as
</P>
<P>
 in enhancing regional and global peace and stability.
</P>
<P>
3. The Ministers underscored the importance of U.S. and Japanese
</P>
<P>
 leadership in providing international assistance to
</P>
<P>
 Afghanistan, Iraq, and the broader Middle East -- efforts that
</P>
<P>
 are already producing results. The Ministers lauded the
</P>
<P>
 successful cooperation between the United States and Japan
</P>
<P>
 with other countries in extending wide-ranging assistance to
</P>
<P>
 those who suffered from the earthquake and the subsequent
</P>
<P>
 tsunami disaster in the Indian Ocean.
</P>
<P>
4. The Ministers recognized that cooperation and consultation
</P>
<P>
 between the United States and Japan have been pivotal in
</P>
<P>
 promoting non-proliferation, particularly through the
</P>
<P>
 Proliferation Security Initiative. They welcomed the success
</P>
<P>
 of multinational interdiction exercises hosted by the United
</P>
<P>
 States and Japan and by others.
</P>
<P>
5. The Ministers expressed their confidence that ballistic
</P>
<P>
 missile defense (BMD) enhances our ability to defend against
</P>
<P>
 and deter ballistic missile attacks and dissuade other parties
</P>
<P>
 from investing in ballistic missiles. Taking note of
</P>
<P>
 achievements in missile defense cooperation, such as Japan's
</P>
<P>
 decision to introduce ballistic missile defense systems and
</P>
<P>
 its recent announcement on its Three Principles on Arms
</P>
<P>
 Export, the Ministers reaffirmed their commitment to close
</P>
<P>
 cooperation on policy and operational matters and to advancing
</P>
<P>
 U.S.-Japan cooperative research in BMD systems, with a view to
</P>
<P>
 possible cooperative development.
</P>
<P>
Common Strategic Objectives
</P>
<P>
6. The Ministers discussed the new security environment in which
</P>
<P>
 new and emerging threats, such as international terrorism and
</P>
<P>
 proliferation of weapons of mass destruction (WMD) and their
</P>
<P>
 means of delivery, have surfaced as common challenges. They
</P>
<P>
 recognized that deepening interdependence among nations in a
</P>
<P>
 global community means that such threats can affect the
</P>
<P>
 security of nations worldwide, including the United States and
</P>
<P>
 Japan.
</P>
<P>
7. While noting that these threats are also emerging in the
</P>
<P>
 Asia-Pacific region, the Ministers also emphasized that
</P>
<P>
 persistent challenges continue to create unpredictability and
</P>
<P>
 uncertainty. Moreover, they noted that modernization of
</P>
<P>
 military capabilities in the region also requires attention.
</P>
<P>
9. Based on this understanding of the international security
</P>
<P>
 environment, the Ministers concurred that both Governments
</P>
<P>
 need to work closely together to pursue common strategic
</P>
<P>
 objectives through their respective efforts, implementation of
</P>
<P>
 the U.S.-Japan security arrangements, and other joint efforts
</P>
<P>
 based on the alliance. Both sides decided to hold regular
</P>
<P>
 consultations to coordinate policies in accordance with these
</P>
<P>
 common strategic objectives and to update these objectives as
</P>
<P>
 the security environment requires.
</P>
<P>
10. In the region, common strategic objectives include:
</P>
<P>
* Ensure the security of Japan, strengthen peace and stability in
the Asia-Pacific region, and maintain the capability to address
contingencies affecting the United States and Japan.
</P>
<P>
* Support peaceful unification of the Korean Peninsula.
</P>
<P>
* Seek peaceful resolution of issues related to North Korea,
including its nuclear programs, ballistic missile activities, illicit
activities, and humanitarian issues such as the abduction of Japanese
nationals by North Korea.
</P>
<P>
* Develop a cooperative relationship with China, welcoming the
country to play a responsible and constructive role regionally as
well as globally.
</P>
<P>
* Encourage the peaceful resolution of issues concerning the
Taiwan Strait through dialogue.
</P>
<P>
* Encourage China to improve transparency of its military
affairs.
</P>
<P>
* Encourage Russia's constructive engagement in the Asia-Pacific
region.
</P>
<P>
* Fully normalize Japan-Russia relations through the resolution
of the Northern Territories issue.
</P>
<P>
* Promote a peaceful, stable, and vibrant Southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
* Welcome the development of various forms of regional
cooperation, while stressing the importance of open, inclusive, and
transparent regional mechanisms.
</P>
<P>
* Discourage destabilizing sales and transfers of arms and
</P>
<P>
military technology.
</P>
<P>
* Maintain the security of maritime traffic.
</P>
<P>
11. Global common strategic objectives include:
</P>
<P>
* Promote fundamental values such as basic human rights,
democracy, and the rule of law in the international community.
</P>
<P>
* Further consolidate U.S.-Japan partnership in international
peace cooperation activities and development assistance to promote
peace, stability, and prosperity worldwide.
</P>
<P>
* Promote the reduction and non-proliferation of weapons of mass
destruction (WMD) and their means of delivery, including through
improved reliability and effectiveness of the Non-Proliferation
Treaty, the International Atomic Energy Agency, and other regimes,
and initiatives such as the Proliferation Security Initiative.
</P>
<P>
* Prevent and eradicate terrorism.
</P>
<P>
* Coordinate efforts to improve the effectiveness of the United
Nations Security Council by making the best use of the current
momentum to realize Japan's aspiration to become a permanent member.
</P>
<P>
* Maintain and enhance the stability of the global energy supply.
Strengthening of U.S.-Japan Security and Defense Cooperation.
</P>
<P>
12. The Ministers expressed their support and appreciation for
</P>
<P>
 each other's efforts to develop their respective security and
</P>
<P>
 defense policies. Japan's new National Defense Program
</P>
<P>
 Guidelines (NDPG) emphasize Japan's capability to respond
</P>
<P>
 effectively to new threats and diverse contingencies, Japan's
</P>
<P>
 active engagement to improve the international security
</P>
<P>
 environment, and the importance of the Japan-U.S. Alliance.
</P>
<P>
 As a central component of its broad defense transformation
</P>
<P>
 effort, the United States is reorienting and strengthening
</P>
<P>
 its global defense posture to provide it with appropriate,
</P>
<P>
 strategy-driven capabilities in an uncertain security
</P>
<P>
 environment. The Ministers confirmed that these efforts will
</P>
<P>
 ensure and strengthen effective security and defense
</P>
<P>
 cooperation as both countries pursue common strategic
</P>
<P>
 objectives.
</P>
<P>
13. In this context, the Ministers underscored the need to
</P>
<P>
 continue examining the roles, missions, and capabilities of
</P>
<P>
 Japan's Self Defense Forces and the U.S. Armed Forces
</P>
<P>
 required to respond effectively to diverse challenges in a
</P>
<P>
 well-coordinated manner. This examination will take into
</P>
<P>
 account recent achievements and developments such as Japan's
</P>
<P>
 NDPG and new legislation to deal with contingencies, as well
</P>
<P>
 as the expanded agreement on mutual logistical support and
</P>
<P>
 progress in BMD cooperation. The Ministers also emphasized
</P>
<P>
 the importance of enhancing interoperability between U.S. and
</P>
<P>
 Japanese forces.
</P>
<P>
14. The Ministers concurred that this examination should
</P>
<P>
 contribute to these consultations on realignment of U.S.
</P>
<P>
 force structure in Japan. They decided to intensify these
</P>
<P>
 consultations in a comprehensive effort to strengthen the
</P>
<P>
 alliance as the bedrock of Japan's security and the anchor of
</P>
<P>
 regional stability. In this context, both sides confirmed
</P>
<P>
 their commitment to maintaining deterrence and capabilities
</P>
<P>
 of U.S. forces in Japan while reducing the burden on local
</P>
<P>
 communities, including those in Okinawa. The Ministers
</P>
<P>
 directed their staffs to report expeditiously on the results
</P>
<P>
 of these consultations.
</P>
<P>
15. The Ministers also stressed the importance of continued
</P>
<P>
 efforts to enhance positive relations between local
</P>
<P>
 communities and U.S. forces. They emphasized that improved
</P>
<P>
 implementation of the Status of Forces Agreement (SOFA) ,
</P>
<P>
 including due attention to the environment, and steady
</P>
<P>
 implementation of the Special Action Committee on Okinawa
</P>
<P>
 (SACO) Final Report are important to the stable presence of
</P>
<P>
 U.S. forces in Japan.
</P>
<P>
16. The Ministers, noting that the current Special Measures
</P>
<P>
 Agreement (SMA) will expire in March 2006, decided to start
</P>
<P>
 consultations on future arrangements to provide appropriate
</P>
<P>
 levels of host nation support, bearing in mind the
</P>
<P>
 significant role of the SMA in supporting the presence of
</P>
<P>
 U.S. forces in Japan.

<TEXT>
<P>
Aides to President Chen Shui-bian and
opposition People First Party (PFP) Chairman James Soong will meet in
the next few days to set a date for a much-anticipated meeting
between the two, a PFP official said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Chang Hsien-yao, director of the PFP's policy-making center, told
the Central New Agency that PFP Secretary-General Chin Ching-sheng is
expected to contact Presidential Secretary-General Yu Shyi-kun to
talk about the detail of the meeting, and added that he himself will
soon meet Presidential Vice Secretary-General James Huang to set a
date and concrete discussion topics for the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Local media has reported that the Chen-Soong meeting is very
likely to be held between Feb. 25, when the sixth Legislative Yuan
will hold its first meeting, and Feb. 27, when former U.S. President
Bill Clinton is slated to visit Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Lai Ching-teh, a whip of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) at the legislature, said that the two parties should do
everything they can to make the much-awaited meeting happen as soon
as possible amid high public expectations.
</P>
<P>
A Chen-Soong meeting has been much anticipated by the public
since the president called for compromise and rapport between the
ruling and opposition parties in the wake of the Dec. 11 legislative
elections.
</P>
<P>
Despite the fact that Chen narrowly won the March 20, 2004
presidential election for a second term, the opposition "pan-blue
alliance" of the Kuomintang, the PFP and the New Party retained its
majority in the 225-member Legislative Yuan after the general polls,
controlling a total of 114 seats.
</P>
<P>
In an effort to put an end to bitter political conflicts, the
DPP, which won 89 seats in the legislature, has tried hard to entice
the PFP, which seized 34 seats, to form a majority to push through
bills.

The Times: Blair's pension offer to
mothers.

Tony Blair is planning to woo stay-at-home mothers in the
forthcoming general election by pledging a big increase in their
basic state pension if Labour is re-elected. The proposed manifesto
pledge, worth at least 3 billion pounds, would mean that women would
be entitled to full state pensions regardless of how many years they
had worked.

VICE PREMIER VOWS TO HELP ECONOMY, WARNS OF MAINLAND INVESTMENT RISKS
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Feb.  20 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Vice Premier Wu Rong-i has vowed to help
Premier Frank Hsieh improve Taiwan's economy and help domestic
companies effectively explore the mainland market by offering them
advice to avoid investment risks there.
</P>
<P>
Wu made the remarks Saturday at a news conference held at a
Russian-style restaurant run by the Taiwan Russia Association (TRA)
in response to concerns over investigations into United
Microelectronics Corp. (UMC).
</P>
<P>
The Taiwan-based semiconductor giant -- the world's
second-largest chip maker on a contract basis -- was charged by
prosecutors with illegally investing in a mainland-based wafer plant
-- He Jian Technology in Suzhou -- which triggered concerns from the
public and the political spectrum.
</P>
<P>
Claiming that the UMC case is by no means a politically motivated
matter, Wu urged the public not to overreact to the case and said
that the government does not prevent Taiwan businesses from making
money in mainland China; on the contrary, it provides them with
advice to ward off risks in the highly volatile market.
</P>
<P>
Wu urged domestic enterprises to be extremely cautious in their
mainland investment plans and said that the government is in a
position to remind them of possible risks, despite the fact that
their investments are not prohibited by law.
</P>
<P>
The vice premier also encouraged Taiwan companies to diversify
their investments by considering breaking into the Russian market.
</P>
<P>
Citing remarks by TRA Vice Chairman Chen Wu-hsiung, he said that
a TRA delegation visited Russia last year and did business worth
US$250 million.
</P>
<P>
The establishment of the TRA was also designed to boost economic
and cultural exchanges between the two countries, he said, pointing
out that the former communist country has transformed to a
market-driven economy.
</P>
<P>
George Zinoviev, deputy director of the Moscow-Taipei Economic
and Cultural Coordination Commission in Taipei, voiced his hope that
the TRA will help open a new window of opportunities and exchanges
for the people of the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Wu served as chairman of the Taiwan Institute of Economic
Research before becoming Hsieh's deputy.

MASTERCARD ADVISOR POSITIVE ABOUT TAIWAN'S ECONOMY, JOB MARKET
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Feb.  20 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taiwan's economy and the job market will
continue to improve this year on the back of a resilient real estate
market, according to the leading economic advisor with MasterCard
International.
</P>
<P>
Yuwa Hedrick-Wong, the leading economic advisor in charge of
Asia-Pacific markets at the international credit card organization,
made the forecast Saturday while publishing a report on the new
global economy.
</P>
<P>
According to Hedrick-Wong, the Taiwan economy is currently in an
upward spiral, with its property market expected to further move up
this year after a recession of more than nine years. Housing prices
in Taiwan surged by 12 percent on average for 2004.
</P>
<P>
As banks are likely to continue a loose loan policy for home
buyers this year, a low interest rate will further stimulant the real
estate market and benefit other sectors, helping pushing up incomes
of salaried people and increase consumers' spending, Wang said.
</P>
<P>
Wang predicted that Taiwan's jobless rate will fall from 4.1
percent in 2004 to 3.7 percent in 2005, and that consumer spending
will rise by 4.5 percent this year as compared to last year's 3.6
percent. Consumer product prices are assessed to increase by around 3
percent, he added.
</P>
<P>
He also forecast that the Taiwan economy will expand by 5.5
percent this year, slower than the previous year's 6 percent, but
pointed out that employees' salaries will not grow at a fast pace on
the grounds that companies would rather spend money to hire more
workers.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on future challenges facing Taiwan's businesses, he
said that large enterprises should step up their research and design
efforts to build up their own brand names to grab a larger slice in
the world market, including mainland China.
</P>
<P>
In the small- and medium-sized sector, companies may encounter a
shortage of skilled workers as a result of a long-term lack of
industrial upgrading and innovation, he estimated.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan will be able to create and seize a larger market only when
its trade and economic exchanges with mainland China are fully free
from restrictions and included in the vast trade bloc formed by the
mainland and the member states of the Association of Southeast Asian
Nations, he concluded.

GOVERNMENT MULLS INCREASE OF CROSS-STRAIT CHARTER FLIGHT SERVICES
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,   Feb.   20  (CNA)
(By Huang Kwang-chun)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The government will evaluate the
possibility of increasing cross-Taiwan Strait charter flight
services, Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) Vice Chairman Chiu Tai-san
said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Chiu made the remarks after this year's special cross-strait
Lunar New Year charter flight services came to an end that day.
</P>
<P>
The government will conduct a comprehensive review and evaluation
of the charter flight services and will weigh the possibility of
allowing the operation of charter flights for the Dragon Boat
Festival and Mid Autumn Festival holidays or on weekends, he said.
</P>
<P>
This year's cross-strait Lunar New Year charter flights, which
started Jan. 29, were successful and were believed to have paved the
way for improvement in the cross-strait ties, Chiu stressed.
</P>
<P>
A total of 48 flights were jointly operated by 12 carriers from
the two sides of the strait, serving more than 10,000 passengers,
aviation industry sources said.
</P>
<P>
Unlike the previous Lunar New Year charter flight services in
2003, which were operated solely by Taiwanese airlines between
Shanghai and Taipei/Kaohsiung via Hong Kong/Macau, this year's
charter flights were not required to land in a third location en
route, although they still need to detour through Hong Kong air
space.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, more than 35,000 people used the ferry service between
Kinmen and Xiamen with a total of 250 trips operated by ships from
the two sides during the period between Jan. 29 and Feb. 20,
according to tallies made public Sunday by Kinmen authorities.
</P>
<P>
The Kinmen-Xiamen shipping links form part of the so-called
"three mini links" -- along with direct trade and transport links --
between Taiwan's Kinmen and Matsu islands and mainland China's Xiamen
and Mawei ports. The links were established on Jan. 1, 2001 to help
promote economic development on the two frontline islands.

U.S.-JAPAN JOINT STATEMENT A 'POSITIVE STEP' SAYS U.S. SCHOLAR
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Washington,  Feb.  20 (CNA)
(By Oliver Lin and P.C. Tang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A U.S. scholar on Sunday affirmed
Japan's endorsement of the need for a peaceful solution of the Taiwan
Strait issue in a joint statement released after the U.S.-Japan
Security Consultation Committee meeting, saying that "it is a
positive step."
</P>
<P>
The meeting was held in Washington, D.C. last Saturday by U.S.
Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, Defense Secretary Donald
Rumsfeld, Japanese Foreign Minister Nobutaka Machimura and Defense
Minister Yoshinori Ohno to discuss various issues including a
peaceful resolution of cross-strait problems.
</P>
<P>
Concluding the meeting, the United States and Japan officials
listed "encouraging the peaceful resolution of issues concerning the
Taiwan Strait through dialogue" in the statement as part of their
common strategic objectives in the Asia-Pacific region.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the statement, June Teufel Dreyer, a political
science professor at the University of Miami, said: "This is less
than we were led to believe would be contained in the joint
statement. But it is still a positive step, since to the best of my
knowledge, it is the first time that Japan has expressed itself
officially endorsing the need for a peaceful solution of the Taiwan
Strait issue."
</P>
<P>
It is reckoned that the United States and Japan talked more about
the issue in private than in public, the professor said, adding that
if China adopts its proposed anti-secession law, this will further
stimulate Japan.
</P>
<P>
However, the scholar said she's worried about Washington's recent
description of its one-China policy, saying that what worries her "is
the way recent references to the one-China policy have seemed to
accept Beijing's view of what 'one China' is, as opposed to the
original Shanghai Communique statement that the U.S. merely
acknowledges that 'Chinese on both sides of the strait' believe there
is but one China."
</P>
<P>
In the statement, the United States and Japan's common strategic
objectives also include ensuring Japan's security, strengthening
peace and stability in the Asian and Asian-Pacific regions,
developing cooperation relations with China, and welcoming China to
play a responsible and constructive role in the region and in the
world.
</P>
<P>
Expressing their serious concern over the statement, a spokesman
for the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs said Sunday that the
Chinese government and people are fiercely opposed to the United
States and Japan including Taiwan issues related to China's national
sovereignty, territorial integrity and national security in the joint
statement.

CROSS-STRAIT CHARTER CARGO FLIGHTS NEED OFFICIAL NEGOTIATIONS: MOTC
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei, Feb. 21 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The opening of direct charter cargo flights
across the Taiwan Strait needs to be negotiated by representatives
commissioned by the governments of the two sides, a Ministry of
Transportation and Communications (MOTC) official said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Lin Chih-ming, director of the MOTC's Department of Navigation
and Aviation, said that he does not think it appropriate that senior
executives from six Taiwan airlines talk about the issue with
mainland Chinese authorities when the Taiwan executives attend a
Spring Festival party in Beijing Tuesday. The event is being hosted
by the mainland's Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC).
</P>
<P>
Although the unprecedented two-way, non-stop cross-strait charter
passenger flights went off without a hitch during the recent Chinese
Lunar New Year holiday, creating a favorable atmosphere for carriers
from the two sides to consider direct cross-strait charter cargo
flights, Lin stressed that official negotiations are a must before
direct cross-strait charter cargo flights can be opened.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan negotiators, whether officials from the private Taipei
Airlines Association (TAA) or airline representatives themselves,
will have to be authorized by the Cabinet-level Mainland Affairs
Council (MAC) to engage in cross-strait negotiations before direct
charter cargo flights are operated on a regular basis, Lin noted.
</P>
<P>
He added that since Beijing refuses to engage Taiwan's
government, the MAC had to commission an official from the TAA to
negotiate the Chinese Lunar New Year charter flights and other
aviation pacts with Hong Kong and Macau in the past.
</P>
<P>
Chang Kuo-cheng, director-general of the MOTC Civil Aeronautics
Administration, in his capacity as an adviser to the private TAA,
took part in talks with mainland Chinese negotiators for the opening
of the landmark Chinese Lunar New Year charter passenger flights.
</P>
<P>
Chang said that so far he has no idea whether he will be assigned
again as one of the Taiwan negotiators for talks with Beijing on
direct cross-strait charter cargo flights.
</P>
<P>
All 12 senior executives from Taiwan's six carriers who are
traveling to Beijing for Tuesday's Spring Festival party have kept a
low profile and have said nothing about speculation that direct
cross-strait charter cargo flights will be brought up during the
party.
</P>
<P>
Purely coincidental or not, the MAC hosted a similar party Monday
in honor of the representatives from the six Taiwan carriers and
officials from the TAA as well as the transportation and
communications ministry.
</P>
<P>
According to Michael Lo, president of the TAA, who concurrently
serves as president of Mandarin Airlines, this is not the first time
the CAAC has invited Taiwan airline executives to Beijing for Spring
Festival celebrations.
</P>
<P>
"Taiwan's airline companies have all set up representative
offices in mainland China and are familiar with CAAC officials. We
have frequent exchanges. Similar Spring Festival gatherings between
the two sides have taken place in the past," Lo said.
</P>
<P>
Lo said the rumors of the trip being used to discuss the direct
flights are unfounded because he will visit Beijing in his capacity
as Mandarin Airlines president, not as president of the TAA.

TAIPEI MAYOR STILL AWAITING RESPONSE FROM PFP CHAIRMAN ON MEETING

<TEXT>
<P>
Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou said Monday that
he is still awaiting a response from opposition People First Party
Chairman James Soong regarding his suggestion that they come together
for a meeting.
</P>
<P>
According to Ma, who is also one of the Kuomintang's vice
chairmen, Soong promised to meet him during or after the Lunar New
Year holidays.
</P>
<P>
While responding to media questions before listening to a
briefing on the "Taipei Travel Network" project at the Taipei
Municipal Hall, Ma said that he doesn't mind waiting until a later
date if the PFP chairman is too busy to hold such a meeting at the
current time.
</P>
<P>
In response to a reporter's question, Ma said that a meeting
between President Chen Shui-bian and James Soong would not affect the
"pan-blue alliance's" process of further consolidating their
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
"Pan-blue alliance" supporters have requested that the Kuomintang
and the PFP further consolidate their cooperation or even move toward
a merger, the mayor said, adding that the Kuomintang will not abandon
these goals even though it will take a lot of effort to achieve.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, New Party Chairman Yok Mou-min was critical of the PFP
chairman, saying that a Chen-Soong meeting could undermine the
"pan-blue alliance" power to take the initiative in dealing with the
nation's policies.

'NAVAL FLEET DIPLOMACY' EFFECTIVE WAY TO BOOST TIES WITH ALLIES: MOFA
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei, Feb. 21 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs said Monday
that sending a naval fleet abroad is an effective way to engage
diplomatic allies.
</P>
<P>
Foreign ministry spokesman Michel Lu was responding to media
reports that the navy's "Friendship Fleet " will embark on an
around-the-globe training voyage across the Pacific, Atlantic and
Indian oceans between March and June, during which time the fleet
will make port calls at seven of the Republic of China's diplomatic
allies.
</P>
<P>
Lu said the voyage is a regular part of naval training. Cadets at
the Chinese Naval Academy are required to receive training aboard the
"Friendship Fleet" before graduation. Lu said the foreign ministry
has consistently offered necessary assistance to the fleet for its
annual overseas training voyage, including negotiating port calls
with diplomatic allies and arranging logistic supplies and
administrative services.
</P>
<P>
Lu said the Ministry of National Defense (MND) will make a formal
announcement after this year's "Friendship Fleet" itinerary is
fleshed out.
</P>
<P>
MND spokesman Naval Captain Liu Chih-chien said earlier in the
day that the "Friendship Fleet" is now undergoing coastal navigation
training.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, the "Friendship Fleet" has sailed to Latin
America, the ROC's diplomatic stronghold. During the voyage, naval
academy cadets are given the chance to practice combat skills,
tactics and navigation.

CHEN-SOONG MEETING TO TAKE PLACE AT TAIPEI GUEST HOUSE FEB. 24
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Feb.  21  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The much-anticipated meeting between
President Chen Shui-bian and opposition People First Party (PFP)
Chairman James Soong is scheduled to take place at the Taipei Guest
House Feb. 24, top aides of Chen and Soong announced Monday after
finally ironing out the details.
</P>
<P>
President Chen's chief of staff, Yu Shyi-kun, consulted with PFP
Secretary-General Chin Chin-sheng Monday morning in an attempt to
hammer out the date, venue and format as well as agenda of the
meeting, as early as possible.
</P>
<P>
In a written statement, the Presidential Office announced in the
afternoon that based on beliefs that the interests of the nation as
well as the people should be given top priority, both Yu and Chin
agreed that the Chen-Soong meeting should be held without further
delay.
</P>
<P>
The two top aides and their respective negotiating teams decided
that President Chen will meet with PFP Chairman Soong at the Taipei
Guest House, a government-own estate located near the Presidential
Office, this Thursday.
</P>
<P>
At the beginning of this year, President Chen said that he would
like to meet with Soong as well as other political party leaders for
talks on issues pertaining to cross-strait relations, economic
affairs and the legislation of major bills related to the people's
livelihood.
</P>
<P>
The PFP warned last week that Soong would meet President Chen
only if the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) government
responds positively to a call to relax restrictions on investment in
mainland China.
</P>
<P>
PFP politicians claimed last Friday that "the atmosphere was
improper at present for such a meeting in the wake of raids launched
by prosecutors on semiconductor giant United Microelectronics Corp.
(UMC) over alleged unlawful investments made by the company in the
mainland." UMC Chairman Robert Tsao is known to be a close friend of
Soong and a supporter of the PFP.
</P>
<P>
According to the PFP officials, the UMC case indicates that the
government's policy toward the mainland is already out of date and
that it is necessary for the opposition to push the government to
address the problems faced by local industry and to seek to relax its
policy.
</P>
<P>
The Chen-Soong meeting will only be meaningful if the DPP
government is willing to change its cross-Taiwan Strait policy, the
officials said.
</P>
<P>
Presidential Office officials said that the opinions of the PFP
have been heard and they said that the president has always been
sincere about meeting Soong, but they said the UMC incident is a
judicial case in which the president is in no position to interfere.

DPP WANTS DIALOGUE WITH OPPOSITION TO CONFIRM CONTROL YUAN NOMINEES
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Feb.  21 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The ruling Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) wants to discuss with the various parties involved how to
resolve the impasse regarding opposition lawmakers' refusal to
confirm the president's Control Yuan nominees immediately after the
new Legislative Yuan opens on Feb. 25.
</P>
<P>
Ker Chien-ming, executive director of the DPP's central policy
committee, made the remarks after the previous legislature, which
ended last month, failed to confirm the members nominated by
President Chen Shui-bian.
</P>
<P>
The nominations were shelved by the legislature owing to
objections from the opposition Kuomintang and People First Party
(PFP). The move left the watchdog body in limbo as its members should
have been sworn in on Feb. 1.
</P>
<P>
Ker said the ROC Constitution stipulates that there will be 29
members in the Control Yuan serving six-year terms. They are to be
nominated by the president and confirmed by the Legislative Yuan. The
Constitution also says that the committee will first review the
nominated Control Yuan members and then the matter will be taken to
the floor of the legislature for a vote.
</P>
<P>
Noting that any proposed bills or budgets that failed to pass one
legislature must start from scratch in the next, Ker said the
Constitution stipulates that the members of the Control Yuan must be
confirmed, and any laws or regulations that contradict the
Constitution are invalid.
</P>
<P>
Ker also said that it is the responsibility for the legislature
to do their duty and confirm the choices of the president. Only if
the nominees are not confirmed by the legislature can they be chosen
again and only by the president if he so decides, he said. The
request for new nominees is not provided for in the Constitution or
any law, he added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a PFP legislator said that Ker should not interpret
the Constitution on his own.
</P>
<P>
Liu Wen-hsiung, PFP whip in the legislature, said that whether to
confirm the nominees or not is the prerogative of the new legislature.
</P>
<P>
Since the public is generally not satisfied with the individuals
nominated by President Chen, Liu claimed, the legislature not
confirming the picks follows the consensus of the people, and if the
ruling party has a different view, it should sort out the problem
through consultations with the opposition parties.

CRACKDOWN ON BURGLARY, FRAUD TO BE TOP PRIORITY: INTERIOR MINISTER
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Feb. 21 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
From March 1, the police authorities will
give priority to a crackdown on burglary and fraud as part of their
efforts to create a safer and more secure living environment,
Minister of the Interior Su Jia-chyun said Monday.
</P>
<P>
"In the coming six months from March, an intensified crackdown on
burglary and fraud will be the top priority for all the police
forces, " Su said after presiding over a meeting of police chiefs
from cities and counties around the nation at the headquarters of the
National Police Administration (NPA) under the Ministry of the
Interior (MOI).
</P>
<P>
Su called the meeting after Premier Frank Hsieh directed relevant
government agencies last Wednesday to work out more effective
crime-fighting measures within a week.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Su said senior NPA officials and local police
chiefs reached consensus on giving priority to intensifying the fight
against burglary and fraud.
</P>
<P>
Quoting NPA tallies, Su said burglary and car theft account for
65 percent of the criminal cases reported in Taiwan. Against this
backdrop, he went on, police authorities will focus on cracking down
on burglary and car theft in the coming six months.
</P>
<P>
From April, Su said, the NPA will post police officers at
motorized vehicle inspection and license bureaus in various cities
and counties to prevent stolen cars from being licensed.
</P>
<P>
In August, he said, the Ministry of Transportation and
Communications will issue new automobile license plates with new
devices to prevent counterfeiting.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Su said, MOI officials will discuss with Ministry of
Justice officials the possibility of enhancing the ratio of repeat or
habitual burglars taken into custody and the possibility of imposing
heavier punishments on repeat offenders.
</P>
<P>
In view of telephone fraud becoming increasingly rampant, Su
continued, police authorities will also give equal priority to this
form of crime in the first stage of the intensified crime-fighting
drive.
</P>
<P>
Su said the government will tighten the supervision of cell phone
subscription applications and stipulate that only cell phone
companies' own branches can handle such applications. The new
measures are aimed at preventing criminal rings from using cell
phones to commit fraud, Su said.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, he said, police will step up community patrols and hold
seminars to brief local people on how to prevent burglary. Community
patrol squads will be awarded cash prizes if they can achieve
satisfactory results in reducing crime in their precincts, Su said.
</P>
<P>
All local police chiefs attending Monday's meeting signed a joint
declaration on making concerted efforts to beef up police forces and
upgrade their crime-fighting capabilities, as well as to crack down
on burglary and fraud, upgrade police service quality and promote
cooperation with the public to prevent criminal activities, Su said.
</P>
<P>
The minister further said the MOI will call a meeting of city and
county government chiefs in Taitung Friday to further discuss
measures to fight crime and improve public order.
</P>
<P>
"The public and private sectors must pool their wisdom and
resources to prevent crime and violence from polluting or eroding our
hard-won economic prosperity and democratic lifestyle," Su said.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at his first formal Cabinet meeting last Wednesday,
Hsieh directed the NPA and all city and county governments to work
together to increase the number of police officers.
</P>
<P>
According to the government's 2005 budget, Hsieh said, the nation
should have 72,423 police officers.
</P>
<P>
"But at the moment, we have only slightly more than 68,500. The
Interior Ministry and local governments should immediately recruit
more police officers to reduce the crime rate," Hsieh said.
</P>
<P>
With a view to enhancing police authorities' criminal
investigative and preventive capabilities, Hsieh said the ratio of
detectives in the forces should be raised from the current 10 percent
to 12 percent.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Hsieh said, equipment should be upgraded where possible
and the police presence in residential communities should also be
increased.
</P>
<P>
Relevant government agencies should also study the feasibility of
adjusting police ranks to boost police officers' morale and dignity,
Hsieh said.

NINE AIRLINES ACROSS TAIWAN STRAIT TO MEET IN BEIJING

<TEXT>
<P>
Nine airlines executives from both sides
of the Taiwan Strait will gather in Beijing for a post Chinese New
Year party Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The "spring festival party" is being held at the invitation of
the Office of Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macau Affairs under Beijing's
Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC) and comes at a time
when cross-strait charter flights for China-based Taiwan businessmen
during Chinese New year holiday has just concluded and the topic of
cross-strait charter cargo services is on everyone's lips.
</P>
<P>
It is understood that Michael Lo, president of the Taipei
Airlines Association (TAA), who consulted with Pu Zhaozhou, director
of CAAC's Office of Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macau Affairs, in early
January on cross-strait charter flights, will attend the party in his
capacity of the president of the Taiwan-based Mandarin Airlines.
</P>
<P>
Lo denied that the party has to do with the discussion of
cross-strait charter cargo flights, although he said that it is
possible to exchange views on the just-concluded cross-strait charter
flights and possible charter cargo flights.
</P>
<P>
"There will by no means be formal consultations," Lo said.
</P>
<P>
Nearly every Taiwan airline has set up offices in the mainland.
Taiwan airline operators said that CAAC officials have invited Taiwan
operators individually for the "spring festival party" in recent
years, but it will be the first time that the two sides gather
together.

PRESIDENT HONORS FARMERS

<TEXT>
<P>
President Chen Shui-bian honored 34 farmers
with "Shen Nung" or "farming god" prizes, as well as naming 18 "model
farmers" Monday in recognition of their contributions to agriculture.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the prize awarding ceremony, which was sponsored by
the Council of Agriculture, the president expressed hope that the
awards will persuade more people, especially the younger generation,
to enter the agricultural sector.
</P>
<P>
There have been 765 winners since the awards were established in
1983.
</P>
<P>
The president noted that small farmers are the mainstay of
Taiwan's agriculture but that they are relatively uncompetitive in
terms of operation costs.
</P>
<P>
Faced with the impact of market opening after Taiwan joined the
World Trade Organization (WTO) Jan. 1, 2002, Chen said the government
has unveiled a series of measures related to the adjustment and
transformation of agriculture, better use of farmland, the upgrading
of the labor force in the agriculture sector, assistance to farmers
to transfer to other sectors and the care of aged farmers.
</P>
<P>
He said the government's measures are aimed at stabilizing the
domestic agricultural product market in the short term, and
developing export-oriented and high value-added agriculture that will
be competitive in the long term.
</P>
<P>
The president said that Taiwan's agriculture must work toward
quality and branding through research and development as well as
international marketing, so as to ensure the sustainable development
of Taiwan's agriculture, while on the other hand increasing the
income of farmers and fishermen.
</P>
<P>
On agricultural issues in the new round of WTO Doha Round of
talks, the president also said the government has always wanted to
protect the interests of farmers and advocates a reasonable grace
period be given to each WTO member considering the unique nature of
agricultural development.
</P>
<P>
The government will also forge allegiances with countries whose
stances are close to Taiwan's in the hope of effectively safeguarding
the nation's interests and the rights and interests of farmers.

PFP WHIP RULES OUT PARTY CHIEF'S ROLE IN CROSS-STRAIT UNITS
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Feb.  21  (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A People First Party (PFP) lawmaker
demanded Monday that the ruling party and the Presidential Office
stop defaming PFP Chairman James Soong by spreading rumors that he
will be offered a post in exchange for inter-party cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Liu Wen-hsiung, a PFP whip at the Legislative Yuan, made the
comments in an effort to dismiss rampant rumors that the government
might offer Soong a post related to cross-Taiwan Strait affairs in a
trade for his party's cooperation with the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party at the legislature.
</P>
<P>
Describing the rumors as a gross insult to both the PFP and
Soong, Liu urged the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) and
the Presidential Office to stop spreading them.
</P>
<P>
"Soong will never accept an offer to take over the chairmanship
of the semi-official Straits Exchange Foundation or that of the
Committee for Cross-Strait Peace and Development under the
Presidential Office, " Liu said, claiming that "it is totally out of
the question in the future, nor has it even been considered by
Soong."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, DPP legislative whip Lai Ching-teh appealed for
continued efforts to forge rapport between the two parties despite
outside or inside pressure.
</P>
<P>
Lai's remarks came after an announcement from the PFP
headquarters that a planned meeting between Soong and President Chen
Shui-bian will take place Friday. Lai welcomed the PFP's statement.
</P>
<P>
In view of the fragile cross strait situation, Chen has
repeatedly sought cooperation with the PFP since last December's
legislative elections. The PFP won 34 seats in the polls, becoming
the third-largest party in the sixth Legislative Yuan, lagging behind
the DPP with 89 seats and the main opposition Kuomintang with 79
seats.
</P>
<P>
The DPP has been trying hard to entice the PFP to form a stable
majority with it to secure political stability during Chen's second
term, despite sharp differences over the two parties' stances on
Taiwan's future course with regard to independence or unification
with mainland China.

AMPLE ROOM FOR TAIWAN-MAINLAND CHINA CHARTER FLIGHTS TO IMPROVE
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Feb. 21 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
This year's Lunar New Year charter flights
should serve as a reference for improvements to future similar
operations and the service should be enhanced to provide carriers
with greater incentives, aviation industry sources said Monday.
</P>
<P>
The key point for the government to consider is whether the
service should be expanded in the future in order to stimulate the
willingness of aviation companies to operate the flights, the sources
said.
</P>
<P>
According to a Far East Air Transport Corp. spokesman, the
passenger load averaged about 90 percent on the round-trip
Taipei-Shanghai route, but the rate on its Taipei-Guangzhou route was
only about 50 percent. The Taipei-Shanghai route should be marginally
profitable if relevant promotion and advertisement costs are written
off, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Mandarin Airlines estimated that it should also have chalked up a
slim profit from the Lunar New Year charter flights -- offered by six
carriers from either side during the January 29-Feb. 20 period.
</P>
<P>
Although this year's holiday charter flights won a better
response from mainland-based Taiwan businessmen and their families
thanks to low ticket prices and the historic non-stop service,
industry sources suggested that the practice be applied to other
major holidays such as the Dragon Boat Festival, the Mid-Autumn
Festival or even weekends.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Transportation and Communications estimated that
average passenger load on the special charter flights should be more
than 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
Compared to the first Taiwan-mainland charter flights in 2003,
this year's service saw some improvements, Taipei Airlines
Association (TAA) President Michael Lo said. Lo is also Mandarin's
general manager.
</P>
<P>
Lo revealed that executives from the Taiwan aviation industry
will travel to Beijing Tuesday to take part in a Spring Festival
gathering hosted by the Civil Aviation Administration of China. But
he was reserved about the possibility of whether the two sides will
touch on issues regarding the long proposed cross-Taiwan Strait cargo
services.
</P>
<P>
The TAA chairman was one of the Taiwan representatives that
reached a final agreement on the just-concluded charter flights in
the middle of last month with mainland counterparts in Macau.

BEIJING URGED TO RESPOND TO CALL FOR TALKS ON CARGO CHARTER FLIGHTS
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Feb.  21 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) Chairman
Joseph Wu urged mainland China Monday to respond positively to
Taiwan's call for talks on the opening of direct cargo charter
flights across the Taiwan Strait.
</P>
<P>
Wu made the appeal during a lunch with senior executives of six
local airline companies to review the operations of the
just-concluded special cross-strait strait charter flights for
home-bound Taiwan businessmen operating on the mainland for Lunar New
Year celebrations. The lunch party was jointly organized by the MAC
and the Ministry of Transportation and Communications (MOTC).
</P>
<P>
Wu said the smooth conclusion of the unprecedented two-way,
non-stop cross-strait passenger charter flights has laid a good
foundation for the launch of the long-talked-about cargo charter
flights.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan has been well prepared for talks with Beijing about the
opening of direct cross-strait cargo charter flights, Wu said, adding
that back in 2003, the MAC unveiled a package of principles for
cross-strait cargo flights.
</P>
<P>
"We are willing to negotiate with Beijing on the cargo flight
service on the basis of those guidelines and on the formula set forth
in the Lunar New Year passenger charter flights," Wu said.
</P>
<P>
As cargo charter flights would be operated on a regular basis, Wu
said the scope of negotiations will be even wider. Therefore, he
said, Taiwan hopes the mainland will respond as soon as possible to
its call for negotiations of technical details regarding the flights.
</P>
<P>
"Cross-strait cargo charter flights are even more important than
the Lunar New Year passenger charter flights and involve more issues
that require bilateral talks to settle. We keenly hope that
negotiations can get underway as early as possible, " Wu said, adding
that he is hopeful Beijing will not set any prerequisites for opening
talks.
</P>
<P>
Under a landmark cross-strait deal struck in Macau Jan. 15, six
carriers on each side of the Taiwan Strait were allowed to operate a
total of 48 round-trip special charter flights between Jan. 29 and
Feb. 20 to carry mainland-based Taiwan businessmen and their families
home for the New Year celebrations.
</P>
<P>
Senior executives of all six Taiwan airlines -- China Airlines,
Mandarin Airlines, EVA Airways, UNI Airways, Far East Air Transport
Corp. and TransAsia Airways -- were invited to the lunch party to
review the charter flight operations and offer opinions for
improvements.
</P>
<P>
Wu expressed his gratitude for all MAC and MOTC staff members as
well as the six airlines for their concerted efforts to make the
cross-strait Lunar New Year charter flights a reality.
</P>
<P>
The lunch came a day before senior executives of the six Taiwan
airlines were to leave for Beijing to attend a similar gathering to
be hosted by the Civil Aviation Administration of China. In addition
to reviewing the just-concluded passenger charter flights, they are
also expected to exchange views with their mainland counterparts on
the launch of cargo charter flights.

TAIWAN, HONG KONG, JAPAN WORK TO BUST MULTI-NATIONAL DRUG OPERATIONS
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei, Feb. 21 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taiwan has been working with Japan and Hong
Kong to bust a multi-national drug smuggling operation, officials of
the Ministry of Justice Investigation Bureau (MJIB) said Monday.
</P>
<P>
The officials made the remarks as police in Tokyo announced that
they had broken up a smuggling operation involving Taiwan, Japan,
mainland China and Hong Kong.

</P>
<P>
Tokyo police also seized 75 kg of liquid methamphetamine and more
than 286,000 ecstasy pills, estimated to worth more than 6 billion
yen (around US$57.14 million) in market value, and arrested four
Japanese suspects.
</P>
<P>
The officials said that MJIB Taichung agents first took notice
of the case and began worked with the National Police Administration
to monitor the exchanges between drug rings in Hong Kong and Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
The agents learned in early 2004 that drug rings in mainland
China, Hong Kong and Taiwan wanted to collaborate to smuggle the raw
materials for making amphetamine to Japan.
</P>
<P>
The agents then provided related information to Japan and Hong
Kong police in May 2004, and began a long-term surveillance
operation. Tokyo police recently began a series of raids on the
hangouts of four of the suspects.
</P>
<P>
Tokyo has attached great importance to the information provided
by Taiwan, twice sent officials to Taiwan to get information and has
expressed appreciation for the help in solving the case, the agents
added.
</P>
<P>
They said that the MJIB will continue to work with drug
enforcement agencies of other countries to crack down on drug crime.

THREE ISSUES TO BE TABLED IN PRESIDENT'S MEETING WITH PFP HEAD: AIDE
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei, Feb. 21 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President Chen Shui-bian's Thursday meeting
with opposition People First Party Chairman James Soong will center
on peace across the Taiwan Strait, national security and harmony
among the different ethnic groups, an aide to the president said
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Huang Chih-fang, deputy secretary-general of the Presidential
Office, said economic ties with mainland China might also be raised,
adding that since these issues cannot be covered in a single meeting,
the president would like to have follow-up meetings with Soong after
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Sub-issues of their discussion are still being worked on by the
two leaders' aides, who might exchange views in the leadup to
Thursday's meeting, Huang said.
</P>
<P>
As to the PFP's insistence that the president should change his
administration's policy on economic exchanges with the mainland
before any meeting with Soong can take place, Huang said, the
president is keeping an open mind about which issues should be
discussed and will not rule out economic policy with regard to the
mainland.
</P>
<P>
Answering journalists' questions, Huang confirmed that the
president will discuss with Soong his idea for a commission on
promoting peace across the strait, but "only its framework and
general principles."
</P>
<P>
The press has rumored that Chen will offer Soong the job as head
of the proposed commission in exchange for PFP support for the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party in the legislature.
</P>
<P>
Huang emphasized that the president would like to exchange views
with Soong even though he understands it is impossible to expect
Soong to see eye-to-eye with him on all of the issues.
</P>
<P>
The meeting is part of Chen's efforts to reconcile with his
political rivals, namely Kuomintang Chairman Lien Chan and Soong, who
challenge the legitimacy of the president and have asked the courts
to deny Chen the presidency in two failed lawsuits that are under
appeal.
</P>
<P>
Asked whether the president would like to meet with Lien too,
Huang said his office would not rule this out.

COMPILATION OF MEMORIES OF AUTHORITARIAN RULE VICTIMS SOUGHT
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei, Feb. 21 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A researcher at Academia Sinica recommended
Monday that the government borrow a lesson from Guatemala and compile
a report on the memories of the victims of Taiwan's period of
authoritarian rule.
</P>
<P>
In a speech to government leaders in a monthly meeting at the
Presidential Office, Academia Sinica Researcher Wu Nei-teh said
turning the political legacy of past authoritarian rulers into a
democratic asset is a difficult challenge facing many newly developed
democracies around the world.
</P>
<P>
Among them, there are about 20 that have followed the example of
South Africa in setting up a commission to get a true picture of past
terror and to pardon those who admit their past crimes in
contributing to such reigns of terror, Wu said.
</P>
<P>
Studies have shown that the stories pried out by South Africa's
Truth Commission have only aggravated the wrath of the people and
widened the rift between different racial groups, Wu went on.
</P>
<P>
Although truth might not bring about reconciliation, the absence
of truth will only make reconciliation even more difficult, Wu
warned.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, he went on, Guatemala has set up a historical
clarification commission to collect the testimonies of more than
20,000 victims who suffered at the hands of that country's past
military dictators and compile them into a book titled "Memories of
Silence."
</P>
<P>
Instead of naming the victims' offenders, the book published by
the government refers to them as "the ruling authorities" to avoid
reopening wounds or giving rise to further conflict.
</P>
<P>
Rather than venting the victims' vengeance on the offenders, the
report is trying to sooth the victims' grief and shed light on the
past of the country by giving a fair report.
</P>
<P>
Given that Taiwan is plagued by the different ethnic groups'
different perceptions of the past government, Wu suggested that the
government follow the Guatemalan model in dealing with the political
legacy of the country's past authoritarian rulers.

President Chen Shui-bian will visit three
of the Republic of China's diplomatic allies in the South Pacific in
May, an official of the Presidential Office said Monday.
</P>
<P>
James Huang, deputy secretary-general of the Presidential Office,
made the remarks following media speculation that Chen will visit
the allies in May and could possibly stay aboard the navy's
"Friendship Fleet."
</P>
<P>
The reports said the fleet will embark on an around-the-globe
training voyage across the Pacific, Atlantic and Indian oceans
between March and June, during which time the fleet will make port
calls at seven of the ROC's diplomatic allies.
</P>
<P>
Huang clarified that Chen plans to visit the Marshall Islands,
Tuvalu and Kiribati, but said his visit will not include stay with
the fleet, as this would disrespect to the allies.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the fleet's itinerary is different to that of Chen's
state visits, he added.

Chen visited two other ROC South Pacific allies -- Palau and the
Solomon Islands -- in late January. He said at that time that he

FSC TO OPEN OFFICES IN NEW YORK, LONDON: FSC CHAIRMAN
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Feb. 21 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Financial Supervisory Commission (FSC)
will open offices in New York and London in July and December this
year, FSC Chairman Kong Jaw-sheng announced Monday.
</P>
<P>
Kong made the announcement during classes on Taiwan's financial
management, investment and challenges at National Taiwan University
and National Chengchi University -- the first of their kind in a
series planned by the FSC in colleges and universities across the
country.
</P>
<P>
According to Kong, the FSC will step up its pace to push the
domestic financial market to go international and make Taiwan into a
world fund-raising and capital management center.
</P>
<P>
First of all, Kong said, the FSC will speed up mergers in the
domestic banking sector in the hope of creating a major and prominent
bank for the country.
</P>
<P>
Pointing out that Taiwan lacks a representative and efficient
bank to compete against banks of other countries, he said that the
leading five banks in Taiwan only enjoy a combined 37 percent stake
in their home market, even lagging well behind the 73 percent boasted
by the leading bank of Indonesia and the 68 percent of Thailand's
most prominent bank.
</P>
<P>
The urgent need to merge and consolidate Taiwan's banks is far
beyond the public's imagination, he noted, adding that the FSC will
provide sound banks with greater incentives in the second half of
this year to help them move swiftly in that direction. The FSC will
also increase pressure on those with inadequate performance to do the
same, he said.
</P>
<P>
According to the FSC chief, the lack of globalization is another
major shortcoming of Taiwan's banks. He said that domestic banks are
unable to make more lucrative profits due to their inability to
market innovative financial products and services.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan has a large amount of capital lingering outside of the
country -- as much as NT$400 billion (US$12.7 billion) from the
banking sector, some NT$100 billion from the securities companies and
over NT$60 billion from the mutual fund companies, he added.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the relatively lackluster stock market in recent
months, he expressed confidence that the domestic bourse will
gradually regain momentum in the near future. As the Taiwan Stock
Exchange is one of those approved by the American Stock Exchange as
appointed overseas markets, its operations are comparable to those of
any developed countries, he explained.

across the Taiwan Strait corresponds with Taiwan's concern, an aide
to the president said Monday in a response to a joint statement
issued by the two countries in Washington Saturday.
</P>
<P>
However, Huang Chih-fang, deputy secretary-general of the
Presidential Office, said the government will not stress too much the
significance of the statement and will not comment on it.
</P>
<P>
He confirmed a news report that the U.S.-Japan joint statement
was brought up in a meeting of the National Security Council (NSC)
earlier in the day, but rebutted a press rumor that the meeting was
called by the president in response to the statement, saying it was a
routine meeting presided over by NSC Secretary-General Chiou I-jen
without the participation of the president.

TAIWAN WILL INCREASE SELF-DEFENSE CAPABILITY: PRESIDENT
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Feb. 21 (CNA)
(By Huang Kwang-chun)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President Chen Shui-bian said Monday that
the government will increase Taiwan's self-defense capability to
safeguard the peace and security in the Taiwan Strait.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a dinner party hosted by Minister of Foreign Affairs
Tan Sun Chen to entertain members of the diplomatic corps in
celebration of the Lunar New Year, Chen said it is part of his
government's efforts for this year to increase Taiwan's self-defense
capability to avoid the peaceful cross-Taiwan Strait status quo from
being changed unilaterally.
</P>
<P>
Beijing's increasing military buildup has not only posed a threat
to the peace and stability of the region but also has broken the
regional balance, Chen pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Also, he criticized Beijing's attempt to enact a proposed
anti-secession law as casting a shadow on the development of
cross-strait ties, which he said has just showed signs of improvement
following the smooth operation of cross-strait charter flights during
the Lunar New Year holiday.
</P>
<P>
It is a serious promise he made to the 23 million people of
Taiwan and to the international community to create a new and stable
environment for consultation and dialogue, the president said, adding
that it also serves as his basic position in pursuing peaceful and
stable interactions between the two sides of the strait.
</P>
<P>
Chen said he will continue to promote the establishment of a
framework of peaceful and stable interactions between the two sides
by setting up a committee for cross-strait peace and development to
seek a domestic consensus on the issue.
</P>
<P>
Chen also called on the international community to join efforts
to safeguard the peace and security of the Taiwan Strait. The
normalization of cross-strait relations needs not only the goodwill
demonstrated by and concrete actions taken by the two sides but also
promotion by the international community, he said.

PREMIER ECHOES CALLS FOR REVIEW OF ECONOMIC REGULATIONS
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Feb.  21 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Premier Frank Hsieh supports calls for a
review of economic regulations, especially those that restrict local
hi-tech companies's investment in mainland China and the tax-free
privileges extended to the semiconductor industry, Executive Yuan
spokesman Cho Rong-tai said Monday.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman quoted the premier as saying that he prefers to
enforce thoroughly more relaxed rules rather than have stringent
rules that are too harsh to be applied.
</P>
<P>
As to which technology should be considered as advanced skills
and whether they should enjoy tax-free privilege, the premier was
cited as saying that the related government agencies should redefine
and update regulations on their own without having to be asked by
their superiors.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman made the comment after local businessmen complained
that some "hi-technology" prohibited by the government from being
transferred to the mainland is no longer considered high-tech and
should not be protected by the regulations.
</P>
<P>
They complained in the wake of prosecutors' search of the United
Microelectronics Corp. (UMC) in connection with its alleged illegal
investment in the mainland that the out-dated regulations have only
cost the companies that command these skills the chance to venture
into the mainland market.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a lawmaker complained that the UMC, as well as another
giant chipmaker, the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, have
not paid any tax in the last eight years because of the tax-free
status provided for the hi-technology companies.

When it comes to polytechnic courses, life
sciences have pushed engineering into the shade.

Over the past five years, since the
Government declared its intention in 2000 to
develop the lucrative biomedical industries
sector, interest in the field has boomed.

In 2002, out of the 15,505 applicants to
polytechnics, 22.9 per cent chose a chemical 
and life sciences course as their first choice. 
Only 21.2 per cent chose engineering.

By last year, the gap had widened even
further, with 26.6 per cent choosing life
sciences and just 17.5 per cent opting for
engineering.

PREMIER, PFP AGREE TO COOPERATE TO ENACT MAJOR BILLS

<TEXT>
<P>
Premier Frank Hsieh reached a three-point
agreement, including cooperation in the legislation of major bills,
with the legislative caucus of the opposition People First Party
(PFP) Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
With the new legislature set to open Friday, the premier has been
busy calling on the legislative caucuses of various parties,
including the ruling Democratic Progressive Party and the Kuomintang,
over the past two days.
</P>
<P>
Hsieh called on the PFP caucus for a closed-door breakfast
meeting Tuesday and then called on the Non-Partisan Solidarity Union
to exchange views with them on which bills should take top priority
in the new legislature and to promote exchanges between the
legislative and the executive branches.
</P>
<P>
Hsieh noted that the next three years presents a good opportunity
for reform as there are no national elections scheduled for the
period. He added that the two sides agreed at the meeting to
cooperate to promote the legislation of major bills over the next two
years.
</P>
<P>
He also said that the Executive Yuan will not float any
politically controversial bills without prior consultations
with opposition parties during his tenure, noting that in the past,
many such bills failed to clear the legislature because of the
absence of prior communications with the opposition and because the
ruling party had not controlled a majority in the 225-seat
legislature.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Hsieh and the PFP expressed the hope of passing
legislation floated by the PFP related to promoting cross-strait
peace.
</P>
<P>
Liu Wen-hsiung, PFP caucus whip in the legislature, said that the
party will promote the bill based on respect of the right of
President Chen Shui-bian to set cross-strait policy.
</P>
<P>
Hsieh stressed that President Chen has proposed the establishment
of a cross-strait peace and stability exchange framework, adding that
he is sure that when President Chen and PFP Chairman James Soong meet
Thursday, the two sides can discuss the matter and reach a consensus
on promoting cross-strait peace.

CHINA AGAIN IN AN ATTEMPT TO BLOCK TAIWAN'S IHR INCLUSION
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Geneva,  Feb. 21 (CNA)
(By P.C. Tang and C.H. Lu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Beijing's permanent representative to the
United Nations Office in Geneva insisted Monday that any revisions to
the International Health Regulations (IHR) must uphold the principles
of the sovereignty and territorial integrity of WHO member states.
</P>
<P>
Although Sha Zukang did not directly refer to Taiwan in his
remarks at the WHO meeting in Geneva on the IHR, his remarks have
been widely interpreted as an attempt to block Taiwan's inclusion in
the IHR after it is revised.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, the second of its kind since last November, was held
with the goal of bringing the IHR up to date and increasing controls
on the international spread of infectious disease.
</P>
<P>
The WHO member states that engaged in the two-week session of
inter-governmental working group meetings held last November failed
to reach agreement on certain contents of the regulations, including
Article 65 of the current IHR rules related to the inclusion of
states that are not WHO members.
</P>
<P>
During Monday's meeting, Sha said that Beijing can only accept
the IHR if the basic principles of WHO members' sovereignty and
territorial integrity are respected.
</P>
<P>
Although it had been decided that the revisions of some IHR
articles, including Article 65, would be discussed at a meeting set
for Feb. 25, Sha requested that the agenda be changed to discuss the
articles in advance. As such, a consultation meeting was scheduled
for Tuesday to discuss the request.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan's diplomatic allies have said that they will oppose such a
request.
</P>
<P>
Nicaragua has proposed revising Article 65 of the current IHR
rules relating to the participation of non-members, saying that the
article should include those territories that have the ability to add
to the knowledge pool in health-related matters and that can take on
IHR affairs in the same manner as WHO members.
</P>
<P>
If the Nicaraguan proposal is adopted, Taiwan is expected to be
included in the IHR.
</P>
<P>
However, China and its backers have strongly opposed the
proposal, claiming that the territories do not have the proper legal
status to join the IHR since the WHO is an inter-governmental
organization and the IHR is a convention among nations.
</P>
<P>
It has been learned that some WHO members have also suggested
that the IHR add the text of "universal application" in Article 2 of
the regulations, which Beijing would most likely oppose fiercely.
</P>
<P>
Sources close to the Taipei Economic and Cultural Office in
Geneva said the office has been trying to drum up strong support
among friendly nations for its IHR bid.
</P>
<P>
Although admitting that there is still a long way to go for
Taiwan to gain inclusion in the IHR, the sources said that the
island's efforts have generally been welcomed by several WHO members.

PHILIPPINE WORKERS STAND TO LOSE IN CROSS-STRAIT CONFLICT

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Hostilities between mainland China and
Taiwan would adversely affect the lives of thousands of Philippine
workers on both sides of the Taiwan Strait, a Philippine university
professor said Monday.
</P>
<P>
 Professor Dagdag of the University of the Philippines was
commenting on mainland China's proposed "anti-secession law." The
Standing Committee of the Chinese National People's Congress agreed
Dec. 29 last year to place the "anti-secession bill" on the agenda of
the congress's plenary session set to open March 5 this year. The
details of the proposed law have yet to be made public.
</P>
<P>
According to the government on Taiwan, the law could become a
"war law" that might lead China's military, police and militia to use
force to solve cross-strait problems.
</P>
<P>
The professor also said the Philippines hopes to maintain
friendly relations with both sides of the Taiwan Strait.
</P>
<P>
Pointing out that some 100,000 Philippine workers are in Taiwan
and many Filipinos are also working in China and Hong Kong, the
professor said that an conflict between Taipei and Beijing would
certainly affect the lives of the Philippine workers.
</P>
<P>
He also said that cross-strait problems should be resolved
peacefully and that the Philippines does not want to see war between
Taiwan and mainland China.

U.S. President George W. Bush will probably keep a promise to

However, while seeking explanations, Bush is unlikely to tie his
administration's Russia policy to Putin's record on democracy because
Moscow remains too valuable as a partner in security and oil and
would become too troublesome as a spoiler if antagonized.

PRO-INDEPENDENCE CHURCH URGES PARTIES TO UPHOLD TAIWAN'S SOVEREIGNTY

<P>
The pro-independence Presbyterian Church in
Taiwan called on both the ruling and opposition parties Tuesday to
uphold the sovereignty of Taiwan while conducting inter-party
consultations and cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The call was made in a "declaration of justice and peace"
released by the church ahead of President Chen Shui-bian's planned
meeting with opposition People First Party Chairman James Soong.
</P>
<P>
Officials of the church said the declaration was issued out of
concern for the country's future, especially since mainland China is
planning to enact an "anti-secession law."
</P>
<P>
In the declaration, the church insists that the independence of
Taiwan's sovereignty is the foundation of inter-party cooperation.
</P>
<P>
It says the pursuit of justice and peace is a shared
responsibility of the international community and that the long-time
isolation of Taiwan by the international community is against the
universal principles of justice and peace.
</P>
<P>
Calling for the establishment of a new relationship between
Taiwan and China, the church said the two sides should seek mutual
recognition and respect based on the principles of equality,
reciprocity and peaceful coexistence.

Minister of Foreign Affairs Tan Sun Chen
left Taipei Tuesday for visits to two of the Republic of China's
diplomatic allies in the Caribbean -- Haiti and the Dominican
Republic.
</P>
<P>
This will be Chen's first-ever visits to the two Caribbean allies
since he assumed the top diplomatic post last April.
</P>
<P>
Chen is scheduled to make transit stops in Tokyo and New York en
route to the Caribbean, which has led observers to wonder if will
take advantage of the stopovers to exchange views with Japanese and
U.S. authorities on Taiwan Strait issues after a Japanese official
announced over the weekend that the security of the Taiwan Strait
will be subsumed in the U.S.-Japan joint security pact.
</P>
<P>
Chen said his itinerary has long been set and that meetings with
Japanese or U.S. officials were not on his agenda for the current
trip.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Chen said that as Taiwan's minister of foreign
affairs, he always welcomes opportunities to talk with foreign
officials, including those from countries with which the Republic of
China doesn't have diplomatic ties.
</P>
<P>
Touching on the latest joint U.S.-Japan security statement that
called for a peaceful solution to cross-strait disputes through
dialogue, Chen said the ROC government welcomes the international
community's increasing concern about Taiwan Strait security and
stability.
</P>
<P>
"We also hope that China can pay heed to this growing
international trend and cooperate with Taiwan in maintaining regional
peace and stability, which is not only in Taiwan's interests but also
in China's," Chen said.
</P>
<P>
Stressing that peace is Taiwan's top cross-strait policy goal,
Chen said he keenly hopes that the just-concluded Chinese Lunar New
Year cross-strait charter passenger flights can serve as a foundation
for bilateral constructive engagements in the future.
</P>
<P>
Chen's two-leg Caribbean visit will last about a week,
diplomatic officials said.

THREE LOBBYING GROUPS TO VISIT EUROPE TO LOBBY ON TAIWAN'S BEHALF
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Feb.  22 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The government will soon send three
delegations to Scandinavia, the Baltic and other European countries
to lobby on Taiwan's behalf, an official of the Ministry of Foreign
Affairs said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Yang Maysing, chairwoman of the foreign ministry's Research and
Planning Committee, said that in view of mainland China's proposed
"anti-secession law" against Taiwan and the European Union leaning
toward lifting an arms embargo against mainland China, the
delegations hopes to help the international community learn more
about the threat faced by Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Yang said that the groups will explain that the proposed
"anti-secession law" will seriously hurt peace in the Taiwan Strait
and human rights in Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Hopefully, the international community, after being briefed on
the precarious situation Taiwan faces, will do what it can to block
the "anti-secession law" from going into force, she said.
</P>
<P>
Wu Shu-ming, the head of the Northern Taiwan Society, an academic
group, will lead the group to Scandinavian countries. A doctor
surnamed Teng will lead the second group to Baltic countries, and the
third group will be headed by Mainland Affairs Council Vice Chairman
Huang Wei-feng and herself to visit the Netherlands, Poland, Slovakia
and Italy, Yang said.
</P>
<P>
Scandinavian countries have been concerned about issues related
to the human rights situation in mainland China and peace and
stability in the Taiwan Strait, she explained.
</P>
<P>
The Baltic countries should be more able to empathize with
Taiwan's situation given its experience of being under the threat of
Russia in the past. The third group will visit European countries
that the foreign ministry has not frequented before, hoping that the
visit will give them more understanding of the will of the Taiwan
people and their government's position.
</P>
<P>
She said that the government's lobbying against the proposed
"anti-secession law" through private communication and media
publicity "has borne fruit, while Beijing's move has caused concern
from the Untied States, Japan and East Asian countries."
</P>
<P>
She said that at present, the government will devote itself to
the prevention of the legislation of the "anti-secession law."
</P>
<P>
On the EU's intention of lifting an arms embargo against mainland
China, Yang observed that Europe is concerned about the human rights
situation there but rarely touches on the delicate situation in the
Taiwan Strait.
</P>
<P>
The EU does not seem worried that the lifting of the arms embargo
would tilt the military balance in the Taiwan Strait, which she
said would seriously damage Taiwan.

RULES FOR HI-TECH INVESTMENT IN CHINA NEED REVAMPING: CONSULTANT
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Feb.  22 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The government should overhaul its rules
restricting Taiwan hi-tech companies' investment in mainland China,
as there is a big gap between business demand and the existing law,
according to an investment consultant.
</P>
<P>
Hsieh Chie-liang, a manager at Polaris Securities Co., Ltd.
suggested that the government revise its current regulations and work
out a phased opening to heed the hi-tech sector's need to explore the
mainland market.
</P>
<P>
According to Hsieh, only by doing so will Taiwan hi-tech industry
maintain their competitive edge across the world amid aggressive
foreign competition.
</P>
<P>
Despite a government law banning private individuals and
companies from investing in mainland-based hi-tech businesses without
official permission, he said that it is hard to control outflows of
capital and personnel.
</P>
<P>
In view of the fact that the global semiconductor industry has
prominently clustered in the mainland, Taiwan's competitive chip
foundries will suffer huge losses if they are still not permitted to
"go west," he said.
</P>
<P>
Against such a backdrop, the government should allow investment
by domestic chipmakers in certain mature and low-profit manufacturing
processes in the mainland, he said.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, it is necessary for the government to strictly
define the role of Taiwan in domestic corporations' market deployment
strategies as a business operations center or a research and
development hub, requiring them to retain their key expertise and
capital at home, he added.
</P>
<P>
Yeh Ming-feng, vice chairman of the Cabinet-level Council for
Economic Planning and Development, said Monday that the government
will further discuss a wider opening of its policy with hi-tech
industry insiders and scholars.
</P>
<P>
In response to a continued cry for a full opening by some
companies, Yeh said that the government reviews its policy
periodically, but he added that a go-ahead for some leading
technologies requires detailed assessments in advance.

ROC REPRESENTATIVE TO PHILIPPINES SPEAKS IN MANILA

<TEXT>
<P>
Reacting to the recent U.S.-Japan statement
that included a reference to cross-strait peace and stability, a
Republic of China diplomat said Monday that Taiwan acts in
accordance with its best interests and needs.
</P>
<P>
ROC representative to the Philippines Wu Hsin-hsing was referring
to a U.S.-Japan Security Consultative Committee meeting held in
Washington, D.C. Saturday in which officials from both sides
discussed various issues including the peaceful resolution of
cross-strait problems via dialogue.
</P>
<P>
Wu was speaking at a university seminar in Manila on the
significance of Taiwan's democratization on surrounding countries.
</P>
<P>
Wu said that the U.S. and Japan formulate their East Asian
policies based on their own interests, and that the statement
indicated that the two countries are concerned about and have taken
heed of the subtle changes of the strategic environment in East Asia
and the entire Asia-Pacific region.
</P>
<P>
He said the subtle changes have come from the so-called "peaceful
emergence" of mainland China, North Korea's claim to be in possession
of nuclear weapons and the subtle changes in cross-strait relations.
</P>
<P>
On the reaction of Taiwan to the U.S.-Japan joint statement, Wu
said that Taiwan will basically handle the situation based on its own
interests and needs.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan knows what is best for its people, Wu maintained. In
addition to positive exchanges with the U.S. and Japan, Taiwan also
needs to work to ensure peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait,
Wu said.

MOFA REGRETS CHINA'S ATTEMPT TO BLOCK TAIWAN'S IHR INCLUSION
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Feb.  22 (CNA)
(By Y.F. Low)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ministry of Foreign Affairs officials
expressed regret Tuesday over mainland China's latest attempt to
block Taiwan's inclusion in the International Health Regulations
(IHR).
</P>
<P>
During a World Health Organization (WHO) meeting on the IHR held
Monday in Geneva, Beijing's permanent representative to the United
Nations Office in Geneva, Sha Zukang, insisted that any revisions to
the IHR must uphold the principles of sovereignty and territorial
integrity of WHO member states.
</P>
<P>
Sha's remarks were apparently an attempt to block Taiwan's
inclusion in the IHR due to the fact that Taiwan is not a WHO member.
</P>
<P>
Foreign ministry spokesman Michel Lu said the IHR revisions can
provide an opportunity for Taiwan to take part in the WHO and that
nothing should deprive the 23 million Taiwanese people of their right
to medical care and health information.
</P>
<P>
In a statement, the ministry called on the international
community to help Taiwan participate in the WHO framework for IHR
revisions and urged mainland China to stop its blockade against
Taiwan to enhance the attachment between people from both sides of
the Taiwan Strait and promote cross-strait cooperation.
</P>
<P>
It said that Beijing had invited officials of Taiwan's Center for
Disease Control (CDC) to attend the IHR meeting set for Feb. 21-26 as
members of the Chinese delegation, when it was well aware of the fact
that Taiwan would never agree to attend the meeting as a Chinese
delegate.
</P>
<P>
In a similar attempt to make the international community believe
that Taiwan is controlled by mainland China and has a representative
place in the Chinese delegation, Beijing invited CDC officials to
attend a IHR conference between mainland China, Hong Kong, Macau and
Taiwan in October last year, according to the statement.
</P>
<P>
The ministry asserted that Taiwan and China are two independent
entities and that it is impossible for Taiwan to join the Chinese
delegation.
</P>
<P>
The ministry urged the WHO to respond to Taiwan's request to send
its own representatives to participate in the inter-governmental
working group meetings in the name of human rights and
humanitarianism.
</P>
<P>
In addition to securing the assistance of its diplomatic allies,
the government is lobbying for the support of the United States and
European nations for IHR revisions in favor of Taiwan, foreign
ministry officials said.

FAPA LAUNCHES DRIVE TO OPPOSE PROPOSED 'ANTI-SECESSION LAW' BY CHINA
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Washington,  Feb. 21 (CNA)

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A pro-Taiwan independence group based
in the United States has launched a "one-person, one-call" drive to
lobby U.S. congressmen to oppose to a proposed "anti-secession law"
by mainland China.
</P>
<P>
The Formosan Association for Public Affairs (FAPA) gathered in a
Presbyterian Falls Church in North Virginia Monday, with He
Cheng-shan, head of the FAPA's Washington, D.C. branch and reverend
Chen Chin-fang spearheading the movement.
</P>
<P>
Chen noted China's full National People's Congress will meet in
Beijing in March to discuss the draft "anti-secession law, " and
urged all Taiwan compatriots to act in unison to urge U.S.
congressmen to oppose the proposed law.
</P>
<P>
If Taiwan expatriates can get the support of 100 U.S.
congressmen, the voices opposing the "anti-secession law" will get
wider attention, he said.
</P>
<P>
The FAPA, established in 1982 in Los Angeles to promote the
establishment of an independent and democratic Taiwan, also plans to
protest in front of the Chinese Embassy Saturday.

President Chen Shui-bian likened the onset
of spring with a thaw in cross-strait relations when he attended a
Spring Festival gathering of literary and artistic figures Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The president said that with the concerted efforts of all people,
political reconciliation and the easing of cross-strait tensions can
be achieved.
</P>
<P>
"Spring is coming," the president said, referring to cross-strait
peace and democratic development in Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Chen made the remarks during his meeting with hundreds of
literary and artistic figures at the party, which was sponsored by
the National Cultural Association (NCA).
</P>
<P>
The president also presented each participant a "red envelope, "
or lucky money, to wish them a happy and prosperous new year.
</P>
<P>
Chen said that he has always admired the lives of the literati
and artists, saying that the power of culture and arts is unlimited.
</P>
<P>
With no pressure to seek another term, Chen said he hopes to do
his best to deliver on the promise he made when he headed the NCA in
August 2000 to establish a country based on culture so that Taiwan
can become steeped in rich cultural ambience.
</P>
<P>
Chen also took the opportunity to introduce Tchen Yu-chiou, the
NCA's secretary-general, saying that she served as the chairwoman of
the Council for Cultural Affairs before, and hoped that she will

MEANING OF 'ANTI-SECESSION LAW' GETTING ATTENTION ABROAD: MOFA
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei, Feb. 22 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The international community is beginning to
understand the serious ramifications of Beijing's proposed
"anti-secession law, " thanks to the foreign ministry's efforts to
get the message across, Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Michael
Ying-mao Kau said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Meeting with a group of pro-independence activists at his office,
Kau explained that the international community is starting to
understand that Beijing is trying to translate its threat against
Taiwan in general into pressure on Taiwan people and businessmen
through the proposed law.
</P>
<P>
Citing information gathered by his ministry, Kau said it is
possible that Taiwan people and businessmen would be subject to
criminal punishment when they are outside of Taiwan because of the
"schism" of their domicile as provided for in the Beijing law, which
is an infringement on their human rights, he added.
</P>
<P>
The foreign ministry has sent teams around the world to explain
what Beijing is up to, although there are still some countries that
believe that the law won't disturb the status quo across the Taiwan
Strait.
</P>
<P>
This issue is put on the back burner by some countries because
they already have their hands full with the crises in Iraq,
Afghanistan, Africa and North Korea, Kau said.
</P>
<P>
Kau said his ministry is sparing no effort to make the world
understand that if they coddle China on this issue, it will only
encourage military adventurism in solving its disputes with Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Activists, mainly members of the four Taiwan Societies in
northern, central, southern and eastern Taiwan, and the Association
of Lee Teng-hui's Friends, have urged the ministry to respond
strongly to Beijing's "anti-secession law, " and to push vigorously
for the country's entry into the United Nations or organize a
referendum to decide the country's future.

U.S. HOPES CHINA WILL PUT OFF 'ANTI-SECESSION LAW': AIT OFFICIAL
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei, Feb. 22 (CNA)
(By Y.F. Low)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The United States hopes mainland China will
put off its plan to enact an "anti-secession law" to help temper the
tension across the Taiwan Strait, an American Institute in Taiwan
(AIT) official said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Raymond F. Greene, chief of the political section at the AIT's
Taipei office, made the remarks during a visit to the legislative
caucus of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), according to
Lai Ching-teh, one of the caucus leaders.
</P>
<P>
Greene expressed concern about the DPP's attitude toward the
"anti-secession law" and whether it will promote a law to counteract
it, Lai said.
</P>
<P>
He also expressed worry that cross-strait tension will escalate
as a result of the enactment of the law and any move by Taiwan to
retaliate, Lai said.
</P>
<P>
Lai told Greene that the DPP has repeatedly displayed goodwill to
Beijing to try to improve cross-strait relations but it has to show
its resolve to defend Taiwan's sovereignty in the face of the
mainland's plan to introduce the "anti-secession law."
</P>
<P>
While the DPP and its ally, the Taiwan Solidarity Union, will
organize a demonstration for this purpose Feb. 28, they are likely to
cooperate to propose a piece of counteracting legislation after the
"anti-secession law" is passed, Lai said.
</P>
<P>
Asked whether the "anti-secession law" is the reason behind the
United States' and Japan's recent decision to list "encouraging the
peaceful resolution of issues concerning the Taiwan Strait through
dialogue" part of their common strategic objectives in the region,
Greene said Washington has a long-standing concern over peace in the
Asia-Pacific region and that this concern will not change because of
the "anti-secession law," according to Lai.
</P>
<P>
Also during the visit, Greene expressed the hope that the
Legislative Yuan will pass the budget for a NT$610.8 billion
(US$18.23 billion) arms procurement package from the United States
within this session.

CROSS-STRAIT CARGO LINKS MAY TAKE PLACE BEFORE PASSENGER SERVICE: MAC
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Kinmen,  Feb.  22 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Direct cargo links between Taiwan and
mainland China might take place ahead of passenger services due to
their importance to Taiwan's economic development, Mainland Affairs
Council (MAC) Chairman Joseph Wu said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Wu made the remarks while paying a visit to outlying Kinmen
Island, where he thanked the Kinmen authorities for their hard work
in operating the "mini three links" -- direct trade and transport
links between Taiwan's Kinmen and Matsu islands and mainland China's
Xiamen and Mawei ports in Fujian Province -- during the Chinese New
Year holidays.
</P>
<P>
A record high of more than 35,000 passengers, mainly
mainland-based Taiwan businessmen and their families, returned home
for the Feb. 9 holiday via the mini links despite direct charter
flights between Taiwan proper and the mainland during the January
29 - Feb. 20 period.
</P>
<P>
Turning to the direct charter flight services, Wu said that the
MAC, Taiwan's top mainland policy planning agency, will use this
year's experience to improve similar operations in the future. But he
pointed out that the MAC has no plans for the time being to expand
the service to other major holidays.
</P>
<P>
According to the MAC chief, the decision was made on the grounds
that demand for Taiwan-mainland charter flights on other holidays or
weekends is not strong.
</P>
<P>
However, he revealed that the council will try its best to push
for direct cargo services between Taiwan and the mainland, as the
issue has long been hoped for by the two sides. He added that the
scope of the links is expected to be broad and may run during the
whole of year.
</P>
<P>
Compared to passenger services, direct cargo transportation
carries a greater significance to Taiwan's economic development, he
explained.
</P>
<P>
Kinmen Magistrate Lee Chu-feng and MAC officials were also
present during the visit.

MAC CHIEF PROMISES TO EXPAND 'MINI THREE LINKS' IN GRADUAL MANNER
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Kinmen,  Feb. 22 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) Chairman
Joseph Wu said Tuesday that the government will further expand the
direct "mini three links" in a gradual manner to help boost the
development of Taiwan's two offshore defense outposts of Kinmen and
Matsu.
</P>
<P>
Wu made the remarks during an inspection tour of Kinmen to review
the "mini three links" operations. Also, for the first time, Wu
invited journalists posted in Taipei by three mainland Chinese news
organizations -- Xinhua News Agency, China News Service and the
People's Daily -- to accompany him on the Kinmen tour to show his
determination to improve relations across the Taiwan Strait.
</P>
<P>
The "mini three links" refers to direct trade, postal and
shipping links between Kinmen/Matsu and Xiamen/Mawei in the
southeastern mainland province of Fujian. With the launch of two-way,
non-stop cross-strait charter flights during the just-concluded
Chinese Lunar New Year holiday, some people were worried that the
prospects for the "mini three links" might dim after the holiday.
</P>
<P>
However, Wu said the "mini three links'" function cannot be
easily replaced even when direct cross-strait shipping links become a
reality.
</P>
<P>
"For Taiwan businessmen in the Fujian area, it's very convenient
to travel via the 'mini three links' routes, " Wu said, adding that
the government will conduct regular reviews of the "mini three links"
operations and continue to expand them in terms of practical demand.
</P>
<P>
Kinmen Magistrate Lee Chu-feng echoed Wu's views, saying that
Kinmen, which lies closer to Fujian than it does to Taiwan, will not
be marginalized even after direct links between Taiwan proper and the
mainland are opened.
</P>
<P>
"If the decades-old ban on direct cross-strait links can truly be
lifted, it would symbolize substantial progress in cross-strait
relations. By then, residents in all mainland provinces will be
allowed to make sightseeing trips to Kinmen to help boost its tourist
industry and overall economic development."
</P>
<P>
The mainland authorities began allowing Fujian residents to make
leisure trips to Kinmen late last year. Because of poor publicity,
only 400-plus Fujian residents have visited so far, but Lee said they
have shown amazing purchasing power.
</P>
<P>
"I hope the cross-strait policy can become ever more open to
allow residents in other major mainland cities, such as Shanghai and
Beijing, to travel to Kinmen via direct air links," Lee said.
</P>
<P>
In response, Wu said that so long as the mainland is willing to
negotiate with Taiwan, the two sides will be able to flesh out
feasible packages for more convenient passenger and cargo transport
services across the Taiwan Strait.
</P>
<P>
Under a landmark cross-strait deal struck in Macau Jan. 15, six
carriers on each side of the Taiwan Strait were allowed to operate a
total of 48 round-trip special charter flights between Jan. 29 and
Feb. 20 to carry mainland-based Taiwan businessmen and their families
home for the New Year celebrations.
</P>
<P>
If mainland China is willing to negotiate without setting any
prerequisites, Wu said he believes direct cross-strait cargo charter
flights can take off on a regular basis in the not-too-distant
future.

The National Kaohsiung First University

Baiko Gakuin University (BGU) of Japan Tuesday, according to NKFUST
President Chou I-chang.
</P>
<P>
The signing ceremony was held at the NKFUST, in which Chou and
BGU President Nakano Shinji signed a five-year bilateral agreement on
exchanges of personnel, professors, students, academic reports and
journals. They also agreed to co-organize academic symposia in
various fields, Chou said.
</P>
<P>
To further promote academic research exchanges, both sides agreed
to exchange a professor and two students for a one-year research and
study program, Chou went on.
</P>
<P>
They also plan to set up "dual degree programs" in graduate
schools, where graduate students can pursue studies for the first
year in one school and the second year in the other. In the third
year, the students' theses will be assessed by both universities'
professors, Chou added.

FOREIGN MINISTER MAKES TRANSIT STOP IN JAPAN

<TEXT>
<P>
Republic of China (ROC) Foreign Minister Tan
Sun Chen made a three-hour transit stop at Narita Airport outside
Tokyo Tuesday on his way to Haiti and the Dominican Republic.
</P>
<P>
He was greeted at the airport by Taiwan's representative to Japan
Koh Se-kai and officials from the Interchange Association of Japan,
which was formed to deal with Taiwan in the absence of diplomatic
ties. He was then escorted to a VIP lounge that was off-limits to the
press.
</P>
<P>
Chen's arrival was considered by the Taiwan authorities to be
politically significant, not only because he is the first ROC foreign
minister to set foot in Japan since the two countries severed
diplomatic ties in 1972 but also because Japan has just aligned
itself with the United States in calling for the peaceful resolution
of issues concerning the Taiwan Strait through dialogue. 
</P>
<P>
Reporters speculated that Chen might have exchanged views with
Japanese officials on issues of mutual concern during his brief stay.

MILITARY NO LONGER OPPOSED TO DIRECT CROSS-STRAIT TRANSPORT LINKS
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Feb. 22 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With the unprecedented two-way, non-stop
Lunar New Year charter flights across the Taiwan Strait concluding
smoothly, the military's attitude toward direct cross-strait
transport links has changed, a senior official said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Minister of National Defense Lee Jye said during a Spring
Festival lunch with local journalists that the military will not be a
"stumbling-block" to the implementation of government policies.
</P>
<P>
According to Lee, the just-concluded Lunar New Year charter
flights have proved that the the military is capable of fully
monitoring mainland China's commercial flights.
</P>
<P>
"Therefore, if the government makes a policy decision on opening
cross-strait air links on a regular basis, the Ministry of National
Defense (MND) will not oppose such a policy," Lee said.
</P>
<P>
Under a landmark cross-strait deal struck in Macau Jan. 15, six
carriers on each side of the Taiwan Strait were allowed to operate a
total of 48 round-trip special charter flights between Jan. 29 and
Feb. 20 to carry mainland-based Taiwan businessmen and their families
home for the Lunar New Year celebrations. Following their smooth
conclusion, the government is now mulling a further easing of
cross-strait economic exchanges and promoting regular cross-strait
cargo charter flights.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on the same occasion, Chief of the General Staff Lee
Tien-yu echoed the defense minister's views, saying that so long as
the government comes to a decision, the military will coordinate with
the government to facilitate the launch of cross-strait cargo charter
flights.
</P>
<P>
"During the Lunar New Year period, the military's radar system
was capable of monitoring each mainland charter flight from its
takeoff from a mainland airport, its detour through Hong Kong
airspace, to its arrival in Taiwan," he said.
</P>
<P>
With progress in warfare strategy and weaponry systems, Lee
Tien-yu said, the ancient "Trojan Horse" formula is no longer
applicable in modern warfare. Moreover, he went on, the military is
fully prepared to cope with any contingencies.
</P>
<P>
Military sources said the military has reinforced combat
preparedness at military bases surrounding the two airports used for
the Lunar New Year cross-strait charter flights -- Chiang Kai-shek
International Airport in Taoyuan and Hsiaokang International Airport
in Kaohsiung. Rapid response forces equipped with air-defense and
anti-terrorist weaponry systems have been stationed at all those
bases to deal with contingencies at the two airports, the sources
said.
</P>
<P>
The sources further said the military is still opposed to opening
military-cum-commercial airports for cross-strait charter flights out
of security concerns. The military also opposes allowing cross-strait
night flights for similar reasons. As military-cum-commercial
airports are used for domestic air routes, the sources said,
cross-strait flights could be "downgraded" to domestic flights if
they use those airports.

MINI LINKS TO BE GRADUALLY ENHANCED: MAC
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Kinmen,  Feb.  22 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) Chairman
Joseph Wu said Tuesday that the "mini three links" might be gradually
enhanced due to their indispensable role in the absence of full links
between Taiwan and mainland China.
</P>
<P>
Wu made the remarks during an inspection trip to the frontline
island of Kinmen. The MAC chief was briefed by Kinmen county
officials about the mini links operations during the recent Lunar New
Year holiday and he thanked relevant personnel for their hard work
during the peak period.
</P>
<P>
Claiming that the government is poised to further upgrade and
open the mini links in a piecemeal fashion, Wu said that the practice
is of great significance owing to their indispensable convenience for
passengers traveling between Taiwan proper and the mainland in the
absence of direct transport services between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
The mini links are in particular important for Taiwan businessmen
and their families based in Fujian Province, he said, adding that the
convenience is extremely important, even if direct air links are set
up across the Taiwan Strait.
</P>
<P>
Kinmen lies closer to Fujian Province than it does to Taiwan
proper.
</P>
<P>
A record high number of more than 35,000 passengers --
principally mainland-based Taiwan businessmen and their families --
returned home for the Feb. 9 Chinese New Year holiday via the mini
links.
</P>
<P>
Kinmen Magistrate Lee Chu-feng said he is not worried that Kinmen
would be marginalized should cross-strait air travel be permitted. If
air links were established between Taiwan and the mainland, he said,
it might help bring in a larger number of mainland visitors, boosting
the economy for the outlying island.
</P>
<P>
Lee, however, pointed out that the government should further step
up its promotion campaign to lure tourists from Fujian, as the Fujian
authorities began permitting residents late last year to travel to
Kinmen on sight-seeing trips.

ROC LOOKS FORWARD TO MILITARY EXCHANGES WITH JAPAN: MINISTER
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Feb.  22  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The military has on many occasions
expressed interest in setting up exchanges with its Japanese
counterpart, Minister of National Defense Lee Jye said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Lee made the remarks at a Spring Festival lunch with local
journalists where he was asked about his views on an earlier media
claim that the military will conduct a joint computerized war game
with U.S. and Japanese forces during the Han Kuang 21 Exercise to be
held later this year.
</P>
<P>
Lee just said the military's computerized war game system can be
linked up with the U.S. forces but he refrained from mentioning
whether the system can also be linked up with Japanese forces.
</P>
<P>
Asked about the possibility of triangular Taiwan-U.S.-Japan
military cooperation, Lee said the military has consistently
maintained cooperative ties with its U.S. counterpart.
</P>
<P>
As for Japan, Lee went on, the exchanges have so far been
confined to reservist generals. "We have repeatedly expressed our
intention to conduct exchanges with the Japanese military and we are
well prepared to forge cooperative ties with Japanese forces, " he
added.
</P>
<P>
According to media claims, the Presidential Office was upset by
the premature media exposure of the planned joint computerized war
game with the U.S. and Japanese forces and thus canceled a military
meeting a day earlier.
</P>
<P>
However, Lee denied that the Presidential Office had any plans to
hold a military meeting that day but he confirmed that the military
is investigating how the information about the Han Kuang exercise was
leaked to the media.
</P>
<P>
Lee said details of the Han Kuang exercise have not yet even been
fleshed out.

DOMESTIC BANKS' OVERDUE LOAN RATIO STABLE IN JANUARY: FSC
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
(By Flor Wang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Taipei, Feb. 22 (CNA ) Taiwan's banks posted an average overdue
loan ratio of 2.78 percent in January, a similar level to the rate
registered at the end of December last year, a spokesman for the
Financial Supervisory Commission (FSC) reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The 2.78 percent ratio is equal to a combined overdue loan worth
NT$432.8 billion (US$13.7 billion) , the FSC official said, adding
that it is worth noting that the amount of normal bank loans
continued to drop to NT$155.1 billion.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan's banks have succeeded in slashing their overdue loan
ratios in recent years. The average overdue loan rate still stood at
above 5 percent at the end of June 2003.
</P>
<P>
As of late January this year, some 87.5 percent of the domestic
banks had managed to register an overdue loan ratio lower than 5
percent, with 50 percent of them recording a rate below 2.5 percent.

DPP SETS KEYNOTE FOR SNAP PARTY CONGRESS
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Feb.  22 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Central Executive Committee of the
ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) set the keynote Tuesday for
its March 12 extraordinary party congress.
</P>
<P>
DPP Secretary-General Lee Yi-yang said after a meeting of the
committee that the keynote will be "persist in reform and defend
Taiwan," while the logo of the congress will be a shield with a heart
formed by two hands, according to Lee. 
</P>
<P>
The shield represents the party's determination to defend Taiwan
and the heart means the party's passion for the island.
</P>
<P>
The purpose of the snap congress is to approve regulations for
nominating the party's candidates for members of the National
Assembly that will be responsible for amending the Constitution later
this year.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the DPP has promised to update the country's
Constitution by cutting the size of the legislature and redrawing the
constituencies from which lawmakers are elected, Lee said his party is
determined to carry out its campaign promises thoroughly.
</P>
<P>
But since Beijing's National People's Congress is set to enact a
so-called "anti-secession law" in an attempt to prevent Taiwan from
seeking independence, the DPP Congress will also speak out against
Beijing loudly during the congress, Lee said.
</P>
<P>
Calling Beijing's "anti-secession law" an attempt to justify an
eventual attack against Taiwan and thereby posing a serious threat to
regional security, Lee said the DPP was founded to defend Taiwan's
sovereignty and it will do whatever it can to ensure the country's
survival.
</P>
<P>
During the snap congress, Lee said, the DPP will lambaste
Beijing's attitude toward Taiwan and will reiterate its determination
to defend the country.

POLITICIANS THROW COLD WATER ON IDEA OF AGREEMENT WITH CHINA
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Feb. 22 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Politicians across the political spectrum
threw cold water Tuesday on a U.S. China affairs expert's idea of
locking in the status quo across Taiwan Straits with a U.S.-brokered
agreement of 20-to-30 years between China and Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Su Chi, a lawmaker of the opposition Kuomintang and a former
chief of the Mainland Affairs Council pointed out that the suggestion
of Kenneth Lieberthal, a former senior director for Asian affairs of
the National Security Council in the United States, is unfeasible
because China, which considers the Taiwan issue to be an internal
affair, would never accept the mediation of any third country,
particularly the United States, which China blames for encouraging
Taiwan independence.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, Su said, Taiwan has difficulty even building a
consensus among its own politician on negotiations with China.
</P>
<P>
Lawmaker Sun Ta-chian of the opposition People First Party also
took a dim view of the idea, saying that the possibility of an
agreement such as that suggested by Lieberthal is slim in light of
Beijing's hostility toward Taiwan's leaders.
</P>
<P>
Tung Li-wen, director of the Department for Chinese Affairs
under the ruling Democratic Progressive Party, said his party will
not accept any negotiation on the sovereignty of Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Lai Hsing-yuan, a lawmaker of the opposition Taiwan Solidarity
Union, said it would not pay to compromise Taiwan's sovereignty for
only 20 or 30 years of peace with China.
</P>
<P>
Lieberthal said in an article published in the March-April issue
of Foreign Affairs that there are two approaches to eliminate the
possibility of war across the Taiwan Strait.
</P>
<P>
The first approach, according to Lieberthal, is for Beijing to
adopt an international definition of Taiwanese independence, under
which a country is independent only if other countries recognize it
as such.
</P>
<P>
Citing former Secretary of State Colin Powell as declaring in
Beijing late last year that "Taiwan is not independent", Lieberthal
said Beijing had already succeeded in preventing Taiwan's
independence by this standard.
</P>
<P>
However, Lieberthal said Beijing is highly unlikely to adopt this
simple resolution, therefore there are the second approach which is
to lock in the status quo by having Beijing and Taipei negotiate a
20-to-30-year "agreed framework" for stability across the Taiwan
Strait.
</P>
<P>
Such an agreement would eliminate the possibility of Beijing's
attack against Taiwan, and the possibility of Taiwan's crossing the
independence red line, Lieberthal said.

ROC FOREIGN MINISTER ARRIVES IN NEW YORK FOR TRANSIT STOP

<P>
Republic of China Foreign Minister Chen
Tan-sun arrived in New York Tuesday for an one-day transit stop en
route to Haiti and the Dominican Republic -- two ROC diplomatic
allies in the Caribbean.
</P>
<P>
According to the Taipei Economic and Cultural Office in New York,
the minister has no plans to meet with U.S. officials or local
Taiwanese expatriates during his short stay in the city.
</P>
<P>
Chen's three-hour transit stop at Narita Airport near Tokyo
earlier the same day has received significant media attention as Japan
recently held a security consultation meeting with the United States
after which the two countries emphasized in a joint statement that
maintaining stability in the Taiwan Strait is part of their common
strategic objectives.
</P>
<P>
The New York Times recently quoted Chen as saying that the joint
statement has made Taiwan more confident in it's security but that he
would not like to see the statement as a challenge to China and only
wants to emphasize the importance of resolving cross-strait problems
peacefully.
</P>
<P>
Chen's trip to Haiti and the Dominican Republic will be his first
to ROC diplomatic allies in the Caribbean since he became the
nation's top diplomatic official last year.

Nearly 20 pygmy killer
whales were found beached Wednesday morning on a beach in Tainan
County, southwest Taiwan, one day after eight others were found on
the same beach, coast guard authorities reported.

<P>
Veterinarians, coast guard officers and experts from the Taiwan

whales back into the sea.
</P>

The experts are still trying to determine why so many pygmy

is actually a species of dolphin, is usually seen in waters off
Taiwan's east coast and rarely off the island's western shores.

Of the eight beached pygmy killer whales discovered on the

MAC CALLS FOR BEIJING TO ABANDON MOVES HARMFUL TO CROSS-STRAIT TIES
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Feb. 23 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A ranking official from the Cabinet-level
Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) called for the Beijing leadership
Wednesday to abandon moves and gestures that are potentially harmful
to the development of cross-Taiwan Strait relations.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on Beijing's proposed anti-secession law, MAC Vice
Chairman Chiu Ta-san said that it is undesirable and meaningless for
China to take actions that will consequently hamper cross-strait
exchanges, infringe on the rights of the Taiwan people, and
destabilize the situation in East Asia.
</P>
<P>
China's National People's Congress (NPC) Standing Committee late
last year placed the anti-secession bill on the agenda for the annual
session of the NPC set for this March.
</P>
<P>
Chiu noted that the Beijing authorities have yet to make public
the contents of the proposed bill, presumably because they are still
watching how nations concerned are reacting to it.
</P>
<P>
President Chen Shui-bian in his New Year's message called for the
nation to seriously face Beijing's proposed anti-secession law which
he said would undermine stability across the Taiwan Strait if
enacted.
</P>
<P>
Chen said that Beijing has been actively engaging in
"psychological, legal and media warfare" in pushing to enact the
anti-secession law, which he said is aimed at establishing a legal
justification for a military invasion of Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
In related news, Chiu welcomed Minister of National Defense Lee
Jye's remarks a day earlier that the defense ministry will not oppose
the opening of cross-strait air links on a regular basis if the
government makes such a policy decision.
</P>
<P>
It is a welcome message from Lee that the military is capable of
defending Taiwan and is fully capable of monitoring mainland China's
commercial flights, a reassurance that further strengthens the
confidence of the people, Chiu added.
</P>
<P>
Lee said Tuesday that with the unprecedented two-way, non-stop
Lunar New Year charter flights across the Taiwan Strait concluding
smoothly, the military's attitude toward direct cross-strait
transport links has changed.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the military will not be a "stumbling-block" to the
implementation of government policies.
</P>
<P>
Lee said that the just-concluded Lunar New Year charter flights
have proved that the military is capable of fully monitoring mainland
China's commercial flights.
</P>
<P>
"Therefore, if the government makes a policy decision on opening
cross-strait air links on a regular basis, the Ministry of National
Defense will not oppose such a policy," Lee said.

Forces from Japan's Fisheries
Agency detained Tuesday a Suao-based fishing boat, the Chin Fu Yu No.
66, for allegedly trespassing into Japan's economic zone, sources
from the Ilan Fishery Association said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Lin Yue-ying, executive director of the Ilan Fishery Association,
quoted a Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) source in Fukuoka as
saying that the vessel, along with its three Taiwanese and seven
mainland Chinese crew, was seized by the Japanese fisheries forces in
the East China Sea, which is an overlapping area between Taiwan's and
Japan's 200-km economic zones.
</P>
<P>
The vessel was towed to a fishing port in the Japanese Five
Islands chain, while the crew was transported to Fukuoka for
questioning, according to the MOFA source.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese fisheries authorities are said to have demanded some
4.3 million yen as a guarantee payment for the crew's release.
</P>
<P>
The families of the three Taiwanese crewmen called the Suao
Fishermen's Radio Tuesday night for help, Lin said, adding that the
Suao Fishery Association is currently making emergency arrangements
to bail the crew out as quickly as possible.

New York Times: Bush
Says Europe Should Not Lift Its China Arms
Embargo

A simmering dispute with Europe came to the fore front on Tuesday
when U.S. President Bush said there was "deep concern" in the United
States that lifting the European Union's arms embargo against China
would change the balance of relations between China and Taiwan. The
issue has been one of the few disagreements to spill into the open
during Bush's trip to repair relations across the Atlantic. In his
most explicit public argument, Bush said lifting the ban would allow
the transfer of critical military technology to the Chinese that
would "change the balance of relations between China and Taiwan, and
that's of concern." The U.S. administration also fears that such
technology, especially advanced radar and communications systems,
might be passed on to other countries.

Veterinarians, coast guard officers and experts from the Taiwan

FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT TO VISIT TAIWAN SUNDAY

<TEXT>
<P>
Former U.S. President Bill Clinton will
arrive in Taipei Sunday for a two-day visit, the Ministry
of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
MOFA officials said the government invited Clinton through the
Republic of China's Representative Office in the United States and
that the ministry will provide him with maximum security protection
and treatment nearly on par with that accorded to an sitting head of
state.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Affairs Minister Tan Sun Chen, who is currently on a
visit to ROC allies in Central America, will return early Sunday so
he can greet Clinton upon his arrival, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
Clinton is scheduled to deliver a speech Sunday on Asian
democracy to be sponsored by the Taiwan Foundation for Democracy,
after which he will answer questions from the audience.
</P>
<P>
Later in the evening, he will attend a dinner party given in his
honor by President Chen Shui-bian and both sides will exchange views
on issues related to regional security.
</P>
<P>
On Monday morning, Clinton will attend an autograph session for
his autobiography "My Life" before leaving that afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Since Clinton stepped down from the presidency, the government
has wanted to invite him for a visit, but a planned trip failed to
materialize due to the Sept. 11, 2001 terrorist attacks on the United
States, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
The Taiwan Foundation for Democracy, a non-profit organization
dedicated to the promotion of democracy and human rights in Taiwan
and abroad, planned to invite Clinton to deliver a speech in November
2003, but that plan was also postponed.
</P>
<P>
Clinton wanted to make a stopover in Taiwan last September on an
Asian tour to promote his book, but the plan was canceled when he
suffered a heart attack.
</P>
<P>
Clinton visited Taiwan four times during his tenure as governor
of Arkansas before being elected president in November 1991.
</P>
<P>
MOFA officials said recently that Clinton contributed a great
deal to the promotion of substantive Taiwan-U.S. relations during his
presidency, particularly his decision to send two aircraft carrier
battle groups to patrol waters near Taiwan during the 1996 Taiwan
Strait crisis.

PARTY CHAIRMAN ELECTION TO FOLLOW ESTABLISHED SYSTEM: KMT

<P>
The election of the opposition Kuomintang
(KMT) chairman will be held in accordance with the party's
established system, KMT Secretary-General Lin Fong-cheng said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Lin was commenting on a proposal by KMT Legislator Lee
Chuan-chiao to postpone the election for one year.
</P>
<P>
With the next election set to take place this May, Lee claimed
that the postponement would call a truce in the struggle between
Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou and Legislative Yuan speaker Wang Jin-pyng,
who are both vice chairmen of the KMT, for the chairmanship.
</P>
<P>
However, Lin said the KMT charter, which stipulates that the
chairman is elected every four years, will guide the chairmanship
election.
</P>
<P>
According to KMT spokeswoman Cheng Li-wen, Lee's proposal is not
feasible because it is too late to revise the charter now.
</P>
<P>
Also speaking on the issue, Ma said the system for the direct
election of the party chairman was established by incumbent chairman
Lien Chan more than four years ago and that he does not see any
reason why this system should be changed this time.
</P>
<P>
Ma denied there is any rivalry between himself and Wang, saying
he has maintained smooth communication with Wang to avoid unnecessary
misunderstandings.
</P>
<P>
Ma said the purpose of his decision to run for the KMT
chairmanship is to promote party reforms and that he hopes to change
the KMT culture through a mechanism of fair competition.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Wang said there is a consensus between himself and Ma
to compete with each other based on mutual respect and to maintain
the peace and unity of the party.
</P>
<P>
On the proposal to postpone the election, Wang said it would
require a consensus within the party before any change could take
place.

<P>
A 37-member group of pilgrims from mainland
China arrived on the Taiwan-held outlying island of Matsu Wednesday
for religious and cultural exchanges.
</P>
<P>
It was the first mainland pilgrim group to visit Matsu since the
Republic of China government initiated direct trade, postal and
shipping links between the ROC outlying islands of Kinmen and Matsu
and the mainland's Fujian Province port cities of Fuzhou and Xiamen
in January 2001, better known as the "mini three links."
</P>
<P>
The group from Fuzhou City joined their Matsu counterparts in a
ceremony worshipping the Shangshu God, which has been enshrined in a
temple in Matsu's Peikan Isle for several hundred years. The pilgrims
then joined a procession which made its way throughout the streets of
Matsu.
</P>
<P>
Members of the Fuzhou pilgrim group, who are scheduled to stay on
Matsu for three days, will also join Matsu residents in a ceremony to
be held Wednesday evening to mark the Lantern Festival celebration.
</P>
<P>
The ceremony will be the second of its kind since last February,

Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA)
officials confirmed Wednesday a 4,000-ton rice donation from Taiwan
to Iraq has been auctioned off without Taiwan's knowledge by a Jordan
charity group entrusted to deliver the shipment.
</P>
<P>
The rice, worth US$4 million, was sold by the Jordan Hashemite
Charity Organization as animal feed for just US$600,000 after it had
been left in the warehouse for one year owing to delivery
difficulties, according to MOFA spokesman Michel Lu.
</P>
<P>
Lu said the government has protested to the organization over the
matter and will seriously reconsider whether to continue its
cooperation with the organization in the future.
</P>
<P>
Despite its dissatisfaction with the decision, the government has
adopted the organization's recommendation to use the US$600,000 to
purchase medical and relief supplies to help Iraqi refugees, Lu said.
</P>
<P>
He said the MOFA will closely monitor the procurement and
delivery process to ensure the supplies are actually sent to Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan has provided relief supplies through various channels to
help the Iraqi people in the aftermath of the U.S.-led war in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
In April 2003, it shipped a total of 5,000 tons of rice to
Jordan, of which 1,000 tons had been successfully delivered to Iraq
as of April 2004, according to the MOFA.
</P>
<P>
Delivery of the remaining shipment was obstructed by constant
terrorist attacks, kidnapping of foreigners and soaring

The Fisheries Administration under the

Fishery officials also said they will strengthen the management

The Taiwan delegation admitted at the time that there could be

The Times: Queen will not attend the
Prince's wedding.

The Queen will not attend the civil wedding ceremony of the
Prince of Wales, her son and heir, to Camilla Parker Bowles,
Buckingham Palace said last night. The official explanation for the
decision is that she respects the Prince of Wales' s wish for the
occasion to be low key. But her refusal to attend the ceremony in the

TALENT SEARCH LAUNCHED TO MARK WORLD YEAR OF PHYSICS 2005

<TEXT>
<P>
The Physics Society of the Republic of
China launched a physics talent search Wednesday to mark the World
Year of Physics (WYP) 2005.
</P>
<P>
Academia Sinica President Lee Yuan-tseh, who is also a member of
the society, said the purpose of the project is not to look for an
Albert Einstein or excellent scientists but to arouse students'
interest in physics.
</P>
<P>
Lee said that although Einstein is known today for his
contributions to a number of physics discoveries including the theory
of relativity, he was not an outstanding student in the eyes of his
high school teachers.
</P>
<P>
According to Lee, while examinations might be a tool for
evaluating the abilities of students, they are incapable of assessing
the talent of a great scientist.
</P>
<P>
Lee said the talent search is a competition and does not mean
that those contestants who are not selected are not talented in
physics.
</P>
<P>
The competition is open to local elementary, junior high and
senior high students aged between 10 and 18, according to the
society.
</P>
<P>
Two male and two female senior high students, one male and one
female junior high student, as well as one male and one female
elementary student, will be selected to become "International WYP
2005 Physics Young Ambassadors," who will represent Taiwan in the WYP
2005 Conference to be held in South Africa.
</P>
<P>
Online registration for the competition is being accepted at

TSU TO GATHER SIGNATURES AGAINST CHINA'S 'ANTI-SECESSION LAW'
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Feb.  23 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The opposition Taiwan Solidarity Union
(TSU) and a dozen civic groups announced Wednesday that they will
launch an "anti-annexation" petition drive in Kaohsiung on Feb. 28,
also known in Taiwan as 228 Peace Memorial Day.
</P>
<P>
Huang Chao-chan, TSU deputy secretary-general, claimed that
mainland China will soon take action against Taiwan businessmen who
support the ruling Democratic Progressive Party and its ally, the
TSU, because of the parties' support for Taiwan independence,
intimidating the businessmen from openly expressing their views.
</P>
<P>
The full session of Beijing's National People's Congress will
also meet in March to review and is expected to approve a proposed
"anti-secession law" against Taiwan independence, Huang said.
</P>
<P>
"If the people of Taiwan don't speak up against this 'annexation
law,' the security of the island will be undermined," he said.
</P>
<P>
Tseng Kuei-hai, president of the Southern Taiwan Society, said
that 228 Peace Memorial Day recalls a traumatic time in Taiwan's
history and everyone should learn from that time and come out openly
against the mainland bill.
</P>
<P>
The 228 Incident refers to events that led to a brutal crackdown
by the Chiang Kai-shek Kuomintang government against the local
people, particularly the elite and dissidents -- real or suspected.
Tens of thousands of people were systematically killed.
</P>
<P>
There will also be a gathering in front of the 228 monument at
Shou Mountain that night as part of the demonstration.
</P>
<P>
The TSU's southern Taiwan office also announced Wednesday that it
will hold a 10,000-person "anti-annexation and protect Taiwan" march
on March 6 in Kaohsiung between 2 p.m. and 4:30 p.m.
</P>
<P>
Two groups will begin the march from separate points and meet up
at the final destination, the Kaohsiung Cultural Center, where Lee
Teng-hui, former ROC president and spiritual leader of the TSU, will
give a speech.
</P>
<P>
Kaohsiung City Councilor Chao Tien-lin said that the Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) should attend the march and clearly state the
party's stance.
</P>
<P>
The TSU will invite Premier Frank Hsieh, DPP Chairman Su
Tseng-chang and acting Kaohsiung Mayor Chen Chi-mai to participate in
the march and to speak on the issue of mainland China's proposed law.

KMT TO HOLD PRIMARIES, WORK WITH ALLIES FOR LOCAL CHIEF ELECTIONS
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Feb. 23 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The opposition Kuomintang (KMT) will hold
intra-party primaries to select potential candidates for the year-end
local chief elections and then decide on the final candidates after
consultations with the party's two political allies, a KMT
spokeswoman said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Cheng Li-wen said that the KMT expects the primaries will be
conducted in an open, fair and democratic manner.
</P>
<P>
Regarding coordination with the People First Party and the New
Party, she said the "pan-blue alliance" must agree on a "game plan"
for selecting the final candidates, adding that this model is how the
alliance will win the mayoral and magistrate elections.
</P>
<P>
She also said that the party will address the different needs of
each city and county and seek the views of local party branches
during the nomination process.
</P>
<P>
Basically, all incumbent KMT local chiefs will seek re-election,
and the party will support them, she said.
</P>
<P>
In several hotly contested areas such as Taipei County, the KMT
</P>
<P>
will pull out all the stops to win, while the party is also
hoping to regain lost ground in Changhua and Nantou counties, Cheng
said.
</P>
<P>
The party also stands a good chance of winning back Pingtung
County, she added.
</P>
<P>
She said the party hopes all aspirants will make known their
intentions and make preparations early.
</P>
<P>
The party will also complete the nomination operations as early
as possible so that newcomers will have enough time to prepare for
the elections.
</P>
<P>
The local chief elections are fiercely contested, and the
outcome will have a significant impact on the political landscape,
Cheng said.

CHEN-SOONG TALKS START OF MEETING OF THE MINDS: YU SHYI-KUN
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Feb. 23 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President Chen Shui-bian and People First
Party (PFP) Chairman James Soong are expected to move closer in their
opinions about ties with mainland China after their Thursday meeting,
a result that will be conducive to developing a mechanism to promote
peace with mainland China, an aide to the president said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Yu Shyi-kun, secretary-general of the Presidential Office, said
that it is not surprising that leading figures from different parties
should have differing views about ties with mainland China, but this
gap should narrow after Chen and Soong reach a meeting of the minds
on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Noting that Soong's party has initiated a bill to promote peace
with mainland China, and President Chen is contemplating setting up a
non-partisan commission as the supreme arbiter of the course of ties
with mainland China, Yu said the two leaders ought to be able to find
common ground in their views, which will pave the way for later
negotiations between their aides until a firm consensus eventually
emerges.
</P>
<P>
Yu said the two leaders, slated to exchange views on ties with
mainland China, defense, and harmony among different ethnic groups,
will discuss generalities rather than specific cases or rules.
</P>
<P>
As to the PFP's call for President Chen to set aside the goal of
seeking Taiwan independence, a plank in the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party's platform, Yu said the president spelled out his
vision for the country's status and ties with mainland China in his
second inaugural address, adding that these will not change.
</P>
<P>
Given that the aides from both camps spent considerable effort to
make the meeting a reality, Yu said he feels that Chen and Soong are
sincere in trying to reconcile their differences. He said he was
confident the meeting would be the beginning of a coalescence of a
common sense of purpose.
</P>
<P>
Preparations for a similar meeting between the president and
Kuomintang Chairman Lien Chan are also underway, with one of Chen's
aides having phoned Lien's chief of staff, Lin Fong-cheng, to explore
the possibility, Yu said.

TAIWAN PULLING ITS WEIGHT IN CUTTING OZONE-DEPLETING AGENT: OFFICIAL
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Feb.  23 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taiwan is in compliance with the 1987
Montreal Protocol regarding the production and use of
hydrochlorofluorocarbons, or HCFCs, even thought the Republic of
China is not a signatory to the agreement, the Environmental
Protection Administration announced Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The administration said in a statement that Taiwan's HCFC
consumption has been cut to 414.8 tons, or 35 percent less than its
1996 consumption of 638.1 tons in line with the requirement of the
Montreal Protocol which requires a gradual phase-out of HCFCs until
2030 when HCFCs must not be produced at all.
</P>
<P>
HCFCs contribute to the depletion of the ozone layer, which in
turn is harmful to life and the environment by allowing an excess
amount of harmful UV-B radiation through the atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
The country's economic and trade organizations, as well as
technological research organizations helped in the reduction, the
statement said.
</P>
<P>
In 1992, members of various sectors in Taiwan, including the
government, set up the Taiwan Ozone Layer Protection Association to
parallel requirements stated in the Montreal Protocol.
</P>
<P>
According to the protocol, HCFCs, which have been, among other
things, used widely as a refrigerant, should be cut by 65 percent
from the 1996 level by 2010.

<P>
The Ministry of National Defense (MND)
denied reports Wednesday that the ROC Air Force plans to buy 200 F35
jet fighters in 2020.
</P>
<P>
A statement issued by the MND Military Spokesman's Office said
that the reports are not true and that the air force is now
evaluating programs for renovating its jet fighters.
</P>
<P>
The armed forces are focusing their efforts for the moment on
acquiring submarines, P-3C submarine-hunting planes and Patriot PAC-3
anti-missile batteries.
</P>
<P>
The country's arms procurement follows a standarized process
which is established in line with the results of a combined
assessment on international situations, needs of the armed forces,
new global trends in the development of jet fighters, the possibility
of acquisition and the timing, it added.
</P>
<P>
The MND will begin to plan the acquisition of armored vehicles
and attack helicopters for the army after the completion of the
current arms purchase program for which budgets are pending to be
approved by the Legislative Yuan, the statement revealed, adding that
the program for purchasing the so-called third generation of jet
fighters will be initiated only after the army's arms purchase is
completed.

The F35 fighter is a joint strike fighter being developed by
Lockheed Martin Aeronautics Co. for the U.S. Air Force, Navy and

As the country exuberantly celebrated the
traditional Lantern Festival by displaying various types of electric
lanterns Wednesday, Vice President Annette Lu decried the way the
holiday is celebrated in Taiwan as a waste of electricity and a
benefit to rival China.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a ceremony marking the 100th anniversary of the
International Rotary Club in Keelung, northern Taiwan, Lu said she
turned down several invitations from local governments to light
lanterns because she said the exhibition of lanterns in the country
consumes about 60,000 kilowatts of electricity per night.
</P>
<P>
What's more, the outspoken critic of mainland China said most of
the lanterns sold in Taiwan were made in China, and the island is
unwittingly contributing to Beijing's economic growth.
</P>
<P>
Lu also called on men in the country not to wear suit coats this

CHEN-SOONG MEETING KICKS OFF
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Feb.  24 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President Chen Shui-bian and opposition
People First Party (PFP) Chairman James Soong began their much
anticipated meeting at the Taipei Guest House at about 10: 30 a.m.
Thursday, marking their second such meeting since Chen assumed the
presidency in 2000.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders, slated to exchange views on ties with mainland
China, defense, and harmony among the different ethnic groups in
Taiwan, will discuss general principles rather than specific cases or
rules, according to President Chen's chief of staff, Yu Shyi-kun.
</P>
<P>
The first Chen-Soong meeting was held on Oct. 19, 2000, during
which the two exchanged views on political party cooperation, the
development of cross-strait relations, the economy, crime and
corruption control, as well as post-921 earthquake reconstruction.
</P>
<P>
Chen and Soong are expected to meet with the press for a question
and answer session at around noon following their high-profile
meeting.

LEGISLATIVE CROSS-STRAIT TASK FORCE TO BE REACTIVATED: SPEAKER
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Feb. 24 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The legislative cross-strait affairs task
force, which has not been in active operation since 1999, will be
reactivated to allow lawmakers to contribute more in efforts at
accelerating the development of cross-strait relations, Legislative
Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng announced Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the mechanism of the task force still exists, Wang
stressed that the legislature should grasp the "favorable" atmosphere
across the Taiwan Strait, epitomized by the recent implementation of
the special cross-strait charter flights for the Chinese New Year
period, and reactivate the mechanism.
</P>
<P>
Wang said that he will take the initiative at the next round of
inter-party consultations in reactivating the task force after its
operations were suspended after 1999 following then President Lee
Teng-hui's remarks defining cross-strait relations as special
"state-to-state" relations.
</P>
<P>
The legislative speaker said it is hoped that all future
cross-strait activities and relations will be included under the
operations of the legislative cross-strait affairs task force, which
he said he believes will allow Taiwan to get on better terms with the
mainland eventually.
</P>
<P>
The Legislative Yuan will also make known its position, through
the cross-strait affairs task force, on Beijing's proposed
anti-secession bill and other crucial issues, Wang added.

TAIWAN'S CAPITAL MARKET WINS INTERNATIONAL RECOGNITION: VICE PREMIER
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei, Feb. 24 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taiwan's capital market has won recognition
from international investment institutions for a series of reforms
and continued market opening in recent years, Vice Premier Wu Rong-i
said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Wu made the remarks while addressing the opening of the 2005
International Organization of Securities Commission (IOSCO) Emerging
Market Training Seminar in Taipei.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that Morgan Stanley Capital International (MSCI)
raised its weighting of Taiwan stocks, increasing Taiwan's Limited
Investability Factor (LIF) from 0.55 to 0.75 last year, and that it
will increase Taiwan's LIF from 0.75 to 1 at the end of this May.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the FTSE Group, a joint venture between the
Financial Times and the London Stock Exchange, announced in September
2004 that Taiwan had officially been added to its Watch List and
would be reviewed in 2005 for a possible upgrading to developed
market status, Wu said.
</P>
<P>
All indexes show that Taiwan's economic environment and capital
market have won recognition from international investment
institutions, he added.
</P>
<P>
Wu said that through years of efforts, Taiwan's capital market
has developed all the features of a developed market based on
fairness, efficiency, transparency, the rule of law and respect for
investors' rights.
</P>
<P>
Kong Jaw-sheng, chairman of the Financial Supervisory Commission,
(FSC) speaking on the same occasion, noted that the commission has
since last month begun an islandwide tour to introduce the operations
of the commission and help solve the problems faced by investors.
</P>
<P>
Andrew Sheng, chairman of Hong Kong's Securities and Futures
Commission, said that Kong visited Hong Kong last month and came to
the belief that bilateral exchanges between Taiwan and Hong Kong will
be even closer in the future.
</P>
<P>
The main topics of this year's IOSCO emerging market seminar in
Taiwan are corporate governance and investor protection.
</P>
<P>
More than 60 representatives from the securities institutions of
more than 20 countries are attending the two-day seminar sponsored by
the FSC.

CHEN-SOONG MEETING AIMED AT INTER-PARTY RECONCILIATION
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Feb.  24 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President Chen Shui-bian said Thursday
morning prior to his meeting with opposition People First Party (PFP)
Chairman James Soong that the meeting is aimed at ending the hostile
political wrangling among the domestic parties and boosting
inter-party reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
Chen made the remarks at the Taipei Guest House, a
government-owned estate near the Presidential Office, where the much
anticipated meeting was being held.
</P>
<P>
Because of the "fragile state of trust" between the ruling and
opposition parties, Chen said that arranging the meeting required
strenuous efforts.
</P>
<P>
"In Taiwan's present political atmosphere, inter-party
confrontation is easier than reconciliation. And this volatile
situation necessitates today's meeting between myself and Chairman
Soong, " Chen said.
</P>
<P>
Chen presented Soong with a calligraphic work featuring the two
Chinese characters "chen cheng, " meaning "sincerity, " as a goodwill
gift. The two then posed for a photo with the calligraphic work to
symbolize their sincerity in tempering inter-party animosity and
promoting mutual reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
For his part, Soong said his decision to meet with Chen is a
response to the mainstream public aspiration for an end to the "war
of attrition" between the ruling and opposition camps that has
dominated the domestic political arena for more than four years.
</P>
<P>
"The people are fed up with the hostile inter-party wrangling.
The main topic for today's meeting will focus on how to let our
people live with dignity, how to sustain Taiwan's development and how
to ease disputes across the Taiwan Strait," Soong said.
</P>
<P>
Chen and Soong hold diverging views on the development of
cross-strait relations. Soong has accused Chen of lacking a
consistent China policy and of provoking Beijing, while the president
has accused the opposition of being too accommodating toward the
communist giant.
</P>
<P>
Chen was also hoping to smooth over differences with Soong about
several critical legislative bills, including a major arms
procurement package, because the PFP is a key partner of the
opposition "pan-blue alliance" that controls a majority in the
Legislative Yuan.
</P>
<P>
In the 2004 presidential election, Soong was the
vice-presidential candidate for the "pan-blue alliance" headed by the
Kuomintang (KMT). After Chen narrowly won the vote, the PFP took part
in rowdy protests against the result.
</P>
<P>
Since the opposition alliance retained a slim majority in the
Dec. 11 legislative elections, Chen's ruling Democratic Progressive
Party (DPP) has worked hard to engage the PFP to seek more dialogue
and less confrontation.
</P>
<P>
Chen and Soong haven't met formally since October 2000, and the
president has also expressed the wish to meet the other opposition
leader, KMT Chairman Lien Chan.
</P>
<P>
In another conciliatory move, the DPP administration has recently
said it could cut the price for the massive arms procurement package
the opposition has described as too expensive.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan wants to buy advanced weapons, including eight
diesel-electric submarines, six Patriot PACIII anti-missile batteries
and a squadron of 12 P-3C Orion anti-submarine aircraft, from the
United States worth NT$610.8 billion, but opposition "pan-blue
alliance" lawmakers have held up a special budget for the package for
months. They claimed that the deal could spark an arms ra ce with
mainland China.

CHEN-SOONG MEETING REPRESENTS 'ETHNIC RECONCILIATION' EFFORTS: SOONG
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Feb.  24  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Opposition People First Party (PFP)
Chairman James Soong described his much anticipated meeting with
President Chen Shui-bian Thursday morning as representing efforts at
"ethnic reconciliation" in Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Soong made the comments just prior to the meeting at the Taipei
Guest House. He described the rendevouz between President Chen, a
native of Taiwan, and himself, a mainlander who emigrated to Taiwan
in the late 1940s, as a prime example of efforts at healing Taiwan's
ethnic divisions.
</P>
<P>
The meeting is part of Chen's promise made at the beginning of
this year to meet with opposition party leaders to try to work out a
consensus on Taiwan's future and the development of cross-strait
ties.
</P>
<P>
Soong said that reconciliation between President Chen and himself
is meant to show that an end to divisions within Taiwan can only be
achieved through mutual respect and trust.
</P>
<P>
The PFP chairman also stressed that before Taiwan can begin to
deal with its internal divisions and the cross-strait political
deadlock, it must recognize itself as the "Republic of China."
</P>
<P>
"How can you expect others or other countries to call us the
Republic of China if we do not recognize ourselves as the ROC?" Soong
asked.
</P>
<P>
Soong reiterated that Taiwan was a part of China -- a historical,
cultural and psychological China that is not today's People's
Republic of China.
</P>
<P>
"If Taiwan was not a part of China like some local politicians
have argued, how could the Ching dynasty government have given the
island to Japan after it signed the shameful Treaty of Shimonoseki
(in 1895)," he ridiculed.
</P>
<P>
If there was no Ching dynasty, there would have been no
revolutions initiated by Dr. Sun Yat-sun, and if there was no Dr. Sun
Yat-sen, there would have been no Kuomintang, and if there was no
Kuomintang, there would have been no Republic of China, " he
continued.
</P>
<P>
"This is undeniable history," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Soong said that he gave President Chen a glass work depicting a
crawling snail in a gardon as a token commemorating the first
Chen-Soong meeting since Oct. 19, 2000. The crawling snail symbolizes
Taiwan's democratization in that "true democracy takes time to
achieve and is worth the labor, like a snail crawling toward a
beautiful garden," he added.
</P>
<P>
Soong said that he attaches great importance to the meeting with
President Chen and expects that they will both be sincere and honest,
not only during the meeting, but also on policies concerning the
people's interests and livelihood.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he also pointed out that Taiwan's two-way trade with
mainland China totaled some US$50 billion last year, making mainland
China Taiwan's largest export market. He said this proves that
Taiwan's industrial sector cannot survive without the mainland
Chinese market.

CHEN-SOONG MEETING FIRST STEP TOWARDS RECONCILIATION: PRESIDENT
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei, Feb. 24 (CNA)
(By Y.F. Low)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President Chen Shui-bian said Thursday that
his meeting with opposition People First Party (PFP) Chairman James
Soong is the first step towards reconciliation and cooperation
between the ruling and opposition parties.
</P>
<P>
Before the meeting, Chen presented a work of calligraphy with two
Chinese characters meaning "sincerity" to Soong, who in turn gave the
president a lapis lazuli carving.
</P>
<P>
According to Chen, the two characters represent the spirit of his
meeting with Soong and is the cornerstone of future cooperation
between both sides.
</P>
<P>
Chen said as the national leader, he is worried about the
political turmoil and social unrest following last year's
presidential and legislative elections.
</P>
<P>
While politicians can choose between reconciling with each other
and continuing to confront each other, reconciliation is the only
choice from the perspective of the country and its people, Chen said.
</P>
<P>
Chen said after two major elections last year, the people of
Taiwan are in dire need of a rest, and the country also requires
unity and stability.
</P>
<P>
The voices of the people are sending a clear message to both
sides that the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) should
govern the country with humility, while the opposition should monitor
the government with rationality, Chen said.
</P>
<P>
It was for this reason the president said that he put forth on
Jan. 1 the idea of creating a new atmosphere via consultations which
would result in stability in Taiwan. He also called for
reconciliation between the ruling and opposition camps for the sake
of political stability, people's well-being, ethnic harmony and
cross-Taiwan Strait peace.
</P>
<P>
After the DPP and PFP have taken the first step towards
ruling-opposition reconciliation and cooperation, they will stick to
this path, Chen said.
</P>
<P>
Chen said the ideological differences between the DPP and PFP
will not hinder their cooperation because he said inter-party
cooperation will be based on the principles of agreeing to disagree
and respecting different opinions.
</P>
<P>
For example, he said, ruling and opposition representatives
managed to put their heads together to seek consensus during the
economic development conference four years ago although they differed
on various policies.
</P>
<P>
Even on the most sensitive issue of national identity, the
differences between the ruling and opposition parties are not
uncompromising, he said.
</P>
<P>
The president pointed out that Soong had a campaign slogan of
"striving for Taiwan" during the 2000 presidential election, which he
said was similar in nature to the DPP's ideas of "Taiwan first" and
"Taiwanese identity."
</P>
<P>
Chen said inter-party competition is not a zero-sum game and that
he hopes the Chen-Soong meeting is a beginning, not the end, to
cooperation.

LEGISLATIVE SPEAKER HOPES LIEN  STAYS ON AS PARTY CHAIRMAN
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei, Feb. 24 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng said
Thursday that he still hopes Chairman Lien Chan will stay on and lead
the opposition Kuomintang (KMT).
</P>
<P>
Wang, while attending an orientation for new KMT legislators,
also said that if Lien makes clear that he won't run for another term
in the KMT Central Standing Committee meeting Friday, then he will
consider running for the party chairmanship.
</P>
<P>
"I still hope that Lien will lead the party for another term, "
politically savvy Wang said, adding that he has not yet campaigned
for the party chairmanship.
</P>
<P>
Although Lien had said several times that he hoped for a
generational power transition within the party, he has stopped short
of publicly expressing his intention of stepping down.
</P>
<P>
As the new Legislative Yuan will open Friday, he said that he
won't be able to attend the KMT meeting that day.
</P>
<P>
With the KMT party chairmanship election set to take place in
May, some KMT legislators have called for a postponement of the
election for another year to avoid a struggle between Wang and Taipei
Mayor Ma Ying-jeou, who recently made clear his intention to run, so
as not to undermine the party's unity. Both Wang and Ma are currently
KMT vice chairmen.
</P>
<P>
But two KMT legislators said the election system for KMT chairman
through a popular vote was established after a great deal of effort,
and everyone should follow the system.
</P>
<P>
Legislator Lai Shyh-bao said that if the consensus is for Lien to
continue to lead the party, then he will seek another term via the
established framework.
</P>
<P>
If the KMT can elect a chairman through a harmonious election,
then the party will serve as a model for other parties, as chairman
of other parties are either designated by the sitting chairman or
other party heavyweights.
</P>
<P>
Legislator Wu Yu-sheng also said that the election should follow
the established system to show that the party is superior to the
ruling Democratic Progressive Party's "one-man culture."
</P>
<P>
Wu said that the elections for mayors and magistrates at the end
of 2005 and the elections for Taipei and Kaohsiung city mayors are
very important, not to mention the 2008 presidential election.
</P>
<P>
"The election of KMT chairman every four years should not be
postponed for specific considerations," Wu said.
</P>
<P>
However, KMT Legislator Liu Cheng-hung, who proposed the one-year
postponement, said that the current party member structure makes some
feel that it is not a fair system.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the new KMT chairman will take up the post in August
after the May election, Liu said. There is not enough time for the
new chairman to campaign for KMT candidates in the year-end
elections, he added.
</P>
<P>
The Democratic Progressive Party has already selected Su
Tseng-chang as its chairman and is gearing up for the year-end
elections. "It would be unwise for the KMT to still be fighting over
the chairmanship in May," Liu said.

TAIWAN FURTHER RELAXES RESTRICTION ON TOURISM BY MAINLANDERS
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Feb. 24 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Ministry of the Interior has recently
amended a regulation governing mainland Chinese people making
sightseeing trips to Taiwan, further relaxing entry restrictions to
certain mainland Chinese.
</P>
<P>
Mainland Chinese people who have permanent residency in a foreign
country can now visit Taiwan alone without having to follow the
"group in, group out" requirement that has been in effect since 2002.
Their visits, however, will have to be arranged by a travel agency,
said an official from the Bureau of Immigration.
</P>
<P>
The new regulation, to take effect Friday, is part of the
government's efforts to attract more visitors from abroad to Taiwan
to help realize the Executive Yuan's ambitious goal of doubling the
number of tourists coming to Taiwan by 2008.
</P>
<P>
Officials from the Republic of China Association of Travel
Agencies welcomed the amendment, saying that more solo travelers will
be interested in visiting Taiwan if Taiwan makes more publicity
efforts abroad.
</P>
<P>
A China Airlines public relations official concurred, adding that
the current regulation requiring mainland citizens who have permanent
residency in Hong Kong, Macau or other foreign countries -- mostly
intellectuals with high incomes -- to travel to and leave Taiwan in
groups and report their whereabouts to a police station every night
is simply beyond the pale.
</P>
<P>
However, Chang Chih-yuan, an official with the Tourism Bureau in
charge of mainland China affairs, said that the new rule will most
likely not result in a significant number of new tourists coming to
Taiwan from mainland China.
</P>
<P>
Chang noted that only when Taiwan opens its door wider to
ordinary mainland citizens who travel to Taiwan via Hong Kong or
Macau can Taiwan's tourism really begin to grow.
</P>
<P>
Also, the issue does not only hinge on the Taiwan side, Chang
said, adding that mainland Chinese officials from the National Travel
Bureau have made it very clear that all mainland citizens are
prohibited from touring Taiwan, regardless of their situation.
</P>
<P>
Chang called for authorities from Taiwan and mainland China to
talk about how to facilitate tourist exchanges across the Taiwan
Strait.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan began to allow mainland Chinese citizens to make
sightseeing trips to Taiwan on a trial basis in January 2002.
Mainlanders made a total of 38,766 person/visits to Taiwan during the
period between January 2002 and December 2004, according to tallies
from the Bureau of Immigration.
</P>
<P>
The Bureau of Immigration under the Ministry of the Interior
classifies mainland visitors into three categories: ordinary Chinese
citizens who travel from the mainland to Taiwan via Hong Kong or
Macau as the first category; mainland Chinese who travel to Taiwan
from a third country as the second category; and mainland Chinese who
have been living abroad for years and have permanent residency in a
foreign country as the third category.
</P>
<P>
The great majority of mainlanders who have visited Taiwan over
the last three years were people from the second category, according
to a Bureau of Immigration official.
</P>
<P>
Almost none from the first category have visited Taiwan since
January 2002, while a large number from the second category absconded
after entering Taiwan, the official said.
</P>
<P>
Only two people from the third category absconded after entering
Taiwan, the official said.

PRESIDENT AND SOONG TO JOINTLY PROMOTE COMMON AIMS FOR TAIWAN
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Feb.  24  (CNA)
(By Y.F. Low)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President Chen Shui-bian on Thursday
reaffirmed his "five noes" commitment, including not to change the
status quo between Taiwan and mainland China, as part of a 10-point
agreement with opposition People First Party (PFP) Chairman James
Soong.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was reached after more than two hours of
discussions between Chen and Soong, which the president called the
first step towards reconciliation and cooperation between the ruling
and opposition parties.
</P>
<P>
Chen said he and Soong will jointly promote cross-strait peace,
national security and ethnic reconciliation in the future based on
this agreement.
</P>
<P>
According to a joint statement released after the meeting, Chen
and Soong agreed that the national status of the Republic of China as
stated in the ROC Constitution defines the de facto and de jure
status quo across the Taiwan Strait, and that this sovereign status
of the ROC deserves recognition and respect by both sides of the
Taiwan Strait and the international community.
</P>
<P>
Abiding by the Constitution, maintaining the status quo and
maintaining peace should be the guiding principles for cross-strait
relations at present, and President Chen promised that during his
term, he will not declare independence for Taiwan, change the
official name of the country, include the "state-to-state" theory in
the Constitution, promote a referendum to change the cross-strait
status quo or abolish the Guidelines for National Unification and the
National Unification Council, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
Chen and Soong agreed that the ruling and opposition parties need
to seek consensus on constitutional reforms to enhance the country's
overall competitiveness and the government's efficiency, but the
reforms should not involve changes to national sovereignty, territory
and cross-strait status quo.
</P>
<P>
To normalize cross-strait relations and establish a framework of
peace and stability, the two leaders decided that both sides will
work together to institutionalize a mechanism for cross-strait peace.
</P>
<P>
They agreed that the government should seek negotiations with the
mainland to expedite the launch of cross-strait charter cargo flights
and the opening of direct cross-strait transportation links. The
government should also review and amend restrictions that hamper
industrial development and national competitiveness.
</P>
<P>
Chen and Soong determined that any changes to the cross-strait
status quo must have the consent of 23 million people on Taiwan and
that Taiwan will not rule out any possibilities in terms of the
future development of its relations with the mainland.
</P>
<P>
On national security, the two leaders agreed that the government
will procure armaments necessary to beef up the country's defense
capabilities, under the strategic objectives of maintaining national
security, cross-strait stability and regional peace.
</P>
<P>
They affirmed that Taiwan will not engage in an arms race with
the mainland and will seek to establish a cross-strait military
buffer zone and military confidence-building mechanism to temper
cross-strait tensions.
</P>
<P>
On the issue of ethnic harmony, Chen and Soong agreed that anyone
using language or behavior that is abusive and discriminatory against
a particular ethnic group should be subject to punishment and that
both sides will promote the enactment of a basic law to protect the
rights of different ethnic groups and enhance ethnic harmony and
equality.
</P>
<P>
Lastly, they agreed that the government should ensure that
different ethnic groups enjoy equal rights and status regarding
economic, social, educational, cultural and examination issues.

AGREEMENT OF CHEN-SOONG MEETING BETRAYS TAIWAN IDENTITY: TSU
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Feb.  24 (CNA)
(By Y.F. Low)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The pro-independence Taiwan Solidarity
Union (TSU) criticized President Chen Shui-bian Thursday, claiming
that he "betrayed the Taiwan identity" after he reaffirmed his "five
noes" commitment, including no change to the status quo between
Taiwan and mainland China.
</P>
<P>
As part of a 10-point agreement reached between Chen and
opposition People First Party Chairman James Soong, Chen reaffirmed
his long-standing promise that during his term, he will not declare
independence for Taiwan, will not change the official name of the
country, will not include the "state-to-state" theory in the
Constitution, will not promote a referendum to change the
cross-strait status quo and will not abolish the Guidelines for
National Unification and the National Unification Council.
</P>
<P>
Strongly protesting the agreement, TSU Secretary-General Chen
Chien-ming claimed that the president has "betrayed the founding
ideals" of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP).
</P>
<P>
Chen Chien-ming said the fate of Taiwan should be decided by the
23 million people of the nation and that it is regrettable that the
DPP has failed to assert Taiwan's sovereignty when the mainland is
planning to enact an "anti-secession law" targeting the country.
</P>
<P>
He insisted that the DPP must not compromise its ideals and
principles while seeking reconciliation with the opposition parties.
</P>
<P>
Unlike the DPP, he said, the TSU will continue to promote a
campaign aimed at drafting a new constitution for the country and
changing the official name of the country from the Republic of China
to the "Republic of Taiwan."
</P>
<P>
Lo Chih-ming, convener of the TSU's legislative caucus, claimed
that the agreement represents "the surrender" of the DPP to the
pro-unification forces on Taiwan and the "one China" policy of
Beijing.
</P>
<P>
By declaring the Republic of China as their largest area of
common ground on the issue of national identity, Chen and Soong have
dishonored the Taiwanese people's pursuit for a new name and new
constitution for the country, according to Lo.
</P>
<P>
Also, by agreeing with Soong that constitutional reforms will not
involve changes to national sovereignty and territory, the president
has gone back on his promise to introduce a "relevant and viable
constitution" for Taiwan, Lo added.

U.S. SCHOLARS URGE GREATER U.S. OPPOSITION TO ANTI-SECESSION LAW
</HEADLINE>

Washington,  Feb. 23 (CNA)

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
U.S. scholars urged the U. S.
administration Tuesday to display stronger opposition to Beijing's
proposed "anti-secession law" at a seminar sponsored by the Heritage 
Foundation here.
</P>
<P>
Members from the Commission of the U.S.-China Economic and
Securities Review Commission under the House of Representatives,
including Commissioner Carolyn Bartholomew and various scholars,
expressed grave concern over the proposed legislation and called for
greater opposition from the U.S. government.
</P>
<P>
Bartholomew said Washington should clearly set forth its
opposition to the Beijing's planned law and added that she is not
satisfied with what the U.S. administration has done so far.
</P>
<P>
According to Bartholomew, Beijing might be thinking of using the
legislation as an excuse to increase its military budget, or using it
to pacify its hardliners, or using it as a chip in its bargaining
with the United States.
</P>
<P>
Dennis Halpin, a senior staff official of the House's Committee
on International Relations said various representatives have voiced
strong disagreement to the proposed legislation by raising a
resolution. But he pointed out that it will be too late for the House
to press Beijing on the issue after the House reopens its session in
the middle of March.
</P>
<P>
Harvey Fedman, a senior researcher at the Heritage Foundation who
hosted the seminar, suggested that the U.S. government strongly make
its stance known to Beijing, but he admitted that the chances are
slim that Beijing will annul or postpone the legislation.
</P>
<P>
Liu Shih-fang, a former secretary-general of the Republic of
China Executive Yuan who is currently a visiting researcher at the
Brookings Institution, said at the seminar that the anti-secession
law is devised to provide Beijing with a pretext to launch an attack
against Taiwan at any time.
</P>
<P>
It will greatly hinder the freedom of speech of the many Taiwan
businessmen operating on the mainland, she pointed out.

 Taipei, Feb. 24 (CAN) Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou's plan to visit
South Korea early next month has been aborted due to intervention
from mainland China, a spokesman for the Taipei city government said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Yu Tzu-hsiang, director of the city's Information Department,
said that the mayor originally planned to attend an Asian leader's
meeting in Seoul at the invitation of the Chosun Ilbo newspaper March
2.
</P>
<P>
But the head of the Korean daily sent a message Wednesday to the
effect that the invitation was revoked because of "unpredictable
technical problems" and because some participants were displeased
with Ma's presence, Yu said.
</P>
<P>
Yu said that the Taipei city government expressed its stance on
the matter through the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
</P>
<P>
Mainland China's delegates to the Asian leader's meeting include
a professor from Shanghai Academy of Social Sciences and mainland
China's ambassador to South Korea.
</P>
<P>
Ma would have delivered a speech and mingled with former
U.S. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger, former Japanese Prime
Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone, former Malaysian Prime Minister Mahatir
and former Indonesian President Megawati Sukamoputri to exchange
views on issues on Asian cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Because of the cancellation, Ma will move ahead his schedule to
visit Japan by one day and will depart for Tokyo and Yokohama for

PAN-PARTY TALKS NEEDED IN NEW LEGISLATURE  ON U.S. ARMS SALE

<TEXT>
<P>
Chairman of the opposition People First
Party (PFP) James Soong said legislators from across the party
spectrum must begin productive discussions on the controversial U.S.
arms purchase plan when the new legislature opens Friday.
</P>
<P>
Soong made the remarks after his high-profile, two-hour meeting
with President Chen Shui-bian. The two spoke on a variety of issues,
including formalizing a mechanism for maintaining cross-strait peace,
the national identity and mainland China's proposed "anti-secession
law."
</P>
<P>
Soong stressed that his party was opposed to the arms procurement
in the previous legislature because of differences over the items and
price of the weapons, adding that the party's stance on the matter
remains unchanged.
</P>
<P>
He was referring to an arms purchase package proposed by the
Cabinet last June to buy six Patriot Pac-3 anti-missile batteries,
eight diesel-fueled submarines, and a squadron of 12 P-3C
anti-submarine aircraft from the United States.
</P>
<P>
At the time of the proposal, the deal was worth NT$610.8 billion
(US$18.23 billion).
</P>
<P>
Soong said that while he was in the U.S. he told those he met
that if the cost was NT$610.8 billion, the package wouldn't pass the
legislature.
</P>
<P>
But he also said that he agreed that Taiwan must maintain a
credible defense force, and in the new legislature the PFP plans to
have a good discussion with the ruling party on the weaponry sale.
</P>
<P>
"We cannot buy nothing, but we also cannot take everything as it
is, " Soong said, adding that the PFP will fulfill its duty as an
opposition party to monitor the budget.
</P>
<P>
Soong also said that he and the president agreed to formulate a
framework to ensure continued peace and stability across the Taiwan
Strait.
</P>
<P>
However, Soong said that President Chen did not invited him to
head a cross-strait peaceful development committee proposed by the
president himself despite widespread reports that Chen was
considering such a move.

Premier Frank Hsieh will reaffirm his
commitment in his first-ever administrative report to the legislature
to safeguarding Taiwan's identity in the face of Beijing's planned
"anti-secession" legislation.
</P>
<P>
Hsieh is scheduled to deliver an administrative report to the

1.
</P>
<P>
According to a written version of the report sent to the

identity as the basic stance of his Cabinet's policy toward relations
across the Taiwan Strait.
</P>
<P>
He will also declare the government's decision to promote
convenient cross-strait cargo transportation services, such as the
opening of direct cargo charter flights, in line with the cardinal
principles of peace and parity.
</P>
<P>
Acknowledging that Taiwan is facing grave challenges, including
mainland China's "magnetic effect" in attracting foreign investment,
cross-strait tension, a widening gap between the rich and the poor, a
shaky national health insurance program, environmental pollution, a
rising crime rate and ethnic divisions, Hsieh will promise in his
report that the administration will humbly listen to mainstream
public opinion and respond to their aspirations.
</P>

He will also pledge to promote inter-party reconciliation through
dialogue and consultations, as well as strengthen communications and
cooperation with the legislative branch in formulating policy
initiatives, in order to smooth over the implementation of major
reform projects.

Incentives to Dissuade Iran

U.S. President Bush said Wednesday that he and German, British

and French leaders had discussed negotiating tactics to try to

get Iran to give up its suspected nuclear weapons program, and

his national security adviser later left open the possibility

that Bush would consider offering incentives to dissuade Iran

Wall Street Journal: Change of Command: A Marine Captain Trains
Iraqi Colonel To Take Over Fight

The struggle to train a new generation of Iraqi military leaders
is emerging as a crucial hurdle to bringing U.S. troops home. And
U.S. officials say that whether an Iraqi force succeeds or fails
often comes down to one person: its commander. In the old Iraqi Army,
combat leaders were distant and autocratic. They stifled initiative
and rewarded blind loyalty over competence, Iraqi and U.S. officials
say. When the Iraqi Army was challenged, troops frequently deserted.
Even with Saddam Hussein gone, U.S Military officials are finding the
old culture hard to change.

PFP CHIEF  PLEDGES TO PUSH FOR PEACE WITH MAINLAND CHINA
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
People First Party (PFP) Chairman James
Soong said Thursday he will push for peace with mainland China in his
capacity as PFP head until such time as a legal framework and
specific mechanism for this purpose is put in place.
</P>
<P>
Soong, who met with President Chen Shui-bian for two hours of
talks earlier in the day, reiterated that he has no intention of
heading a peace development commission proposed by Chen to improve
ties with the mainland because its formation, function and authority
are not provided for in any legislation.
</P>
<P>
Soong said the PFP, which has introduced to the Legislative Yuan
a bill for promoting peace across the Taiwan Strait, would like to
discuss its bill, as well as Chen's idea for the peace development
commission, with the other political parties, including the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party, and to work out a peace-promoting
mechanism acceptable to all participants.
</P>
<P>
Soong said he did not discuss with the president who should lead
the work for peace with the mainland, adding that "I am not in a
position to recommend anyone to the president for this post" even if
the PFP-initiated bill is enacted into law, because the chief of the
peace-promoting commission should be chosen by members of the
commission, according to the bill, and "I am not certain that I would
be elected."
</P>
<P>
Before the law governing the peace-promoting mechanism is in
place, Soong said he will do his best to improve peace with the
mainland in his capacity as PFP chief.

with Soong. Chen also expressed his hope of having meetings with
other opposition leaders.
</P>
<P>
Claiming that the meeting yielded no new breakthroughs to help
improve the fragile Taiwan-mainland ties, Chang said that the "five
noes" policy outlined by Chen when he came to power for the first
time in May 2000 have already been hollowed out by the president
himself as a result of his pro-independence stance and ethnic-split
election strategy.
</P>
<P>
If Chen really wishes to resolve cross-Taiwan Strait disputes, he
should do something concrete to serve the people, Chang said, adding
that the KMT will first heed the opinions of the "pan-blue alliance"
supporters regarding the Chen-Soong meeting before considering a
summit between KMT Chairman Lien Chan and the president.
</P>
<P>
The "pan-blue alliance" of the KMT, the PFP and the New Party
retained its majority in the 225-member Legislative Yuan with a
combined 114 seats in the December elections, beating the "pan-green
camp" of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) and the Taiwan
Solidarity Union, which gained a total of 101 seats.
</P>
<P>
Ever since, the president has repeatedly called for compromise
and ice-breaking between the governing and opposition camps in view
of the tensions between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait. He has
tried hard to woo the crucial PFP -- the third-largest party in the
legislature with 34 seats, lagging behind the DPP with 89 seats and
the KMT with 79 seats -- to form a stable majority with the DPP.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, DPP Chairman Su Tseng-chang thanked Soong for his
participation in the meeting and said the president's efforts to
forge political stability and promote cross-strait peace through
inter-party cooperation should win high approval from the public.
</P>
<P>
Byron S.J. Weng, a national policy advisor to the president, was
optimistic about a positive response from Beijing in the wake of the
Chen-Soong meeting.
</P>
<P>
Although mistrust and difficulties remain in the way of a thaw
between Taiwan and the mainland, Weng told CNA in an exclusive
interview that Beijing is expected to respond positively to the
development in order not to further hamper cross-strait relations,
since neither side is seeking to settle their dispute by waging war.
</P>
<P>
Despite his optimism about the prospects for bilateral ties, he
was also of the opinion that it is impossible that Beijing will
postpone its legislation of an anti-secession law aimed at Taiwan.
The context of the law will be the key to gauging the future
situation across the strait, he added.
</P>
<P>
Chang Wu-ueh, a veteran mainland affairs expert, claimed that the
Chen-Soong meeting will be conducive to easing Beijing's worry about
Taiwan to some extent, as the president reiterated his vow to
maintain the ROC status quo in the joint 10-point statement.
</P>
<P>
Despite the fact that the meeting will not end all the problems
at home and across the strait, it heralds a good beginning to serve
that end, he contended.

<TEXT>
<P>
Opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Lien
Chan said Thursday that the new party head should be chosen in line
with the party rules and he urged all KMT members to work according
to the existing mechanisms.
</P>
<P>
Lien made the remarks at a seminar held by the KMT's Central
Policy Making Committee.
</P>
<P>
According to Lien, the party's new chief should be named by
August in compliance with the party rules. He also said that a vote
for the new chairman can be held earlier in order not to affect the
nomination operations for the mayor and magistrate elections set for
December this year.
</P>
<P>
Only by so doing will the KMT be able to expand continuously and
set an open and fair model for the party's sustainable growth while
bracing for a new phase of development, he said.
</P>
<P>
The issue regarding the new KMT chairmanship has triggered
rampant speculation over a competition between Taipei Mayor Ma
Ying-jeou and Legislative Yuan President Wang Jin-pyng -- both vice
chairmen of the main opposition party.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taiwan's first lady Wu Shu-jen is scheduled
to make a six-day trip to Japan this May, mainly to visit the Expo
2005 Aichi, Fuji Television reported late Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Wu and her entourage are scheduled to arrive in Nagoya May 9
before proceeding to Aichi for a one-day visit to the international
expo May 10. The first lady will also visit Tokyo before returning to
Taiwan May 14, Fuji Television reported.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, Wu and her entourage will enjoy
visa-free treatment as the Japanese government has decided to waive
the visa requirement for Taiwan tourists in the period between March
25 and Sept. 30 this year.
</P>
<P>
The visa-free policy was adopted mainly to attract more tourists
from Taiwan, one of the major sources of tourists to Japan, to visit
the Aichi Expo, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
In related news, the Republic of China Ministry of Foreign
Affairs (MOFA) expressed welcome last week to Japan's decision to
waive the visa requirement for Taiwan tourists and expressed the hope
that the temporary measure will be made permanent.
</P>
<P>
A MOFA official said the measure, approved by the Japanese House
of Councilors, or the upper house of the Diet, on Feb. 8, will boost
exchanges between the two countries and will benefit both sides.
</P>
<P>
Under this measure, Taiwan tourists will be allowed to visit
Japan without a visa for up to 90 days at a time between March 25 and
Sept. 30. The Aichi World Expo is being held from March 25 to Sept.
25.
</P>
<P>
Since Taiwan has been offering Japanese tourists visa-free entry
for the past three years, the official said, the ministry hopes Japan
will reciprocate Taiwan's goodwill by making this temporary measure a

saying only that it would push for Taiwan and China to engage in
dialogue to solve their problems peacefully.

The statement on cross-strait relations, national defense and
ethnic reconciliation was signed by Chen and Soong after they met
Thursday morning at the Taipei Guest House for talks that lasted over
two hours.

Six of the points focused on cross-strait relations and issues
related to the nation's status, including agreement that the
country's name is the Republic of China and that the government
should set up a mechanism to promote cross-strait peace.

E.U. SHOULD MAINTAIN ARMS BAN ON CHINA: ROC ENVOY
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Brussels,  Feb. 24 (CNA)
(By Y.S. Lo and P.C. Tang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taiwan's top envoy to the European Union
and Belgium on Thursday urged European countries to pay more
attention to Taiwan's security, saying that the E.U. should not lift
its arms embargo against China.
</P>
<P>
Chen Chien-jen, ROC representative to the E.U and Belgium, made
the appeal in his first news conference since becoming the nation's
top official in Brussels Oct. 15 last year.
</P>
<P>
Noting that Taiwan has developed over the past forty years into a
model of democracy in Chinese society, Chen said that the suspension
of cross-strait political dialogue in 1998 is unfortunate.
</P>
<P>
Although the agreement reached by the two sides of the strait on
direct charter flights during the Lunar New Year holidays seems to
convey a positive message, the envoy said, China's deployment of more
than 600 missiles targeting Taiwan as well as its proposed
anti-secession law demonstrate that tensions continue to exist
between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
Emphasizing Taiwan's strong opposition to a lifting of the E.U.
ban on arms sales to China, Chen said that the United States, Japan
and the ASEAN countries have voiced their serious concerns over the
current situation in the Taiwan Strait and that the European
countries should also pay more attention to security in the strait.
</P>
<P>
Claiming that enactment of the anti-secession bill would
represent a unilateral move to alter the cross-strait status quo and
would affect regional stability and security, Chen urged the
international community to work to prevent Beijing from doing so.

ROC FIRST LADY HAS NO PLAN TO VISIT JAPAN IN MAY: PRESIDENTIAL OFFICE

<P>
Denying Japanese news reports, a spokesman
for the Presidential Office said Friday that President Chen Shui-bian
and his wife, Wu Shu-jen, currently have no plans to visit Japan in
May for the Expo 2005 to be held in Aichi Prefecture.
</P>
<P>
Chen Wen-tsung, director-general of the Department of Public
Affairs under the Presidential Office, said that the first couple
presently have no such plans as reported by two Japanese media
organizations over the past two days.
</P>
<P>
Kyodo News reported Friday that aides to President Chen Shui-bian
have been sounding out Japanese authorities since early February
about the possibility of Chen and his wife visiting Japan this May,
primarily for the Expo 2005 Aichi.
</P>
<P>
Fuji Television reported late Thursday that Taiwan's first lady
Wu Shu-jen is scheduled to make a six-day trip to Japan May 9-14,
mainly to visit the Aichi Expo.
</P>
<P>
It has been learned that Wu Shu-jen has expressed a desire to
visit Japan, particularly during the cherry blossom season, to
experience the culture and because Japan is located close to Taiwan
and it would not be a difficult journey for the wheelchair-bound
first lady.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, officials from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA)
offered no comments on the Japanese news reports, saying only that
they have no idea about the first couple's plans regarding visiting
Japan.
</P>
<P>
According to the Fuji Television report, Wu and her entourage
will enjoy visa-free treatment as the Japanese government has decided
to waive the visa requirement for Taiwan tourists in the period
between March 25 and Sept. 30 this year.
</P>
<P>
The visa-free policy was adopted mainly to attract more tourists
from Taiwan, one of the major sources of tourists to Japan, to visit
the Aichi Expo, the report said.
</P>
<P>
According to the Kyodo News report, Taiwan officials sounding out
Japanese authorities about a possible visit by the first couple has
placed the Japanese government in a dilemma as such a visit would
inevitably invite protests from Beijing.
</P>
<P>
The MOFA expressed welcome last week to Japan's decision to waive
the visa requirement for Taiwan tourists and expressed the hope that
the temporary measure will be made permanent.
</P>

A MOFA official said the measure, approved by the Japanese House

RISING NT DOLLAR ERODING CONFIDENCE IN BUSINESS PROSPECTS: TIER
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Feb. 25 (CNA)

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The continuing appreciation of the Taiwan
currency against the U.S. dollar is eroding the Taiwan industrial
sector's confidence in securing vigorous growth this year, the Taiwan
Institute of Economic Research (TIER) reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
While Taiwan's business climate index for January slid to 99.77
points, the lowest level since June 2003, more companies expressed
pessimism in a recent poll about their business prospects over the
next six months, TIER's acting president David Hong said.
</P>
<P>
According to the latest TIER report, Taiwan's business climate
index for January dropped to 99.77 points, down from December's
100.33 points, representing the sixth consecutive month-on-month
decline.
</P>
<P>
In addition, although 28.5 percent of the manufacturing companies
polled expressed optimism about business conditions at home over the
next six months, up from last month's 23.3 percent, the percentage of
companies that were pessimistic about their business prospects rose
noticeably to 26.2 percent from last month's 14.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
Hong attributed the growing pessimism mainly to the substantial
appreciation of the New Taiwan dollar against the greenback, a trend
which is seen as continuing over the next several months.
</P>
<P>
According to Hong, the dollar has been flat due to the United
States' trade deficits and budget deficits, with no improvement in
sight for either, leading economists to believe that the greenback
will continue to fall in the months ahead.
</P>
<P>
Based on this, as well as a speculation that China is unlikely to
adopt a flexible policy against the U.S. dollar anytime soon, the
Taiwan dollar is likely to continue to appreciate, although mildly,
in the near future, Hong predicted.

TAIWAN TO ATTEND OECD TRADE COMMITTEE MEETING AS 'AD HOC OBSERVER'
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Geneva,  Feb. 24 (CNA)
(By C.H. Lu and P.C. Tang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taiwan has been invited for the first time
to attend the Trade Committee meeting of the Paris-based Organization
for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) set to be held March
10-11 as an "ad hoc observer, " a ranking ROC trade official said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Huang Chih-peng, director-general of the Board of Foreign Trade
(BOFT) under the Ministry of Economic Affairs, who is currently in
Geneva to participate in the service sector negotiations of the World
Trade Organization's Doha Round of trade talks, confirmed that he
will go to Paris next month to attend the meeting and to hold
bilateral talks with French officials.
</P>
<P>
Huang said that since this will be Taiwan's first time
participating in an OECD Trade Committee meeting, his main goal is to
understand the operations of the committee and to enhance contact and
communication with the organization's secretariat and representatives
of OECD member states, adding that he will also introduce Taiwan's
current trade policies and situations during the gathering.
</P>
<P>
The OECD, which agreed last October to grant Taiwan "ad hoc
observer" status in its March trade committee meeting, has not made a
final decision on whether it will grant the island formal observer
status in the committee. Taiwan has been bidding to obtain such
status since September 2003.
</P>
<P>
According to OECD officials, the "ad hoc observer" status is a
provisional arrangement that allows Taiwan, at the invitation of the
committee and under the designation of "Chinese Taipei, " to attend
the committee's special meetings with no obligations, including the
paying of membership fees, and no rights.
</P>
<P>
Noting that he will appropriately express Taiwan's wish for
active participation in the OECD's trade committee, Huang said he
won't immediately push the island's bid for formal observer status as
this will be the island's first time participating in such a meeting.
He added that its better for him to first learn about the committee's
operations and to establish good cooperation relations with the
organization.
</P>
<P>
The OECD groups 30 member countries sharing a commitment to
democratic government and market economy. Taiwan obtained observer
status in the organization's Competition Committee Dec. 20, 2001.

CHEN-SOONG MEETING HELPS CROSS-STRAIT TIES: SPEAKER
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Feb.  25 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng
claimed Friday that an agreement reached between President Chen
Shui-bian and opposition People First Party Chairman James Soong will
help ease cross-Taiwan Strait relations and domestic political
stability.
</P>
<P>
Wang made the remarks while attending the handover ceremony of
the heads of a KMT subgroup in the legislature.
</P>
<P>
He noted that among the agreements reached between Chen and Soong
Thursday was that the national status of the Republic of China as
stated in the Constitution defines the de facto and de jure status
quo across the Taiwan Strait and that this sovereignty status of the
ROC deserves recognition and respect by both sides of the Taiwan
Strait and the international community.
</P>
<P>
Both sides also said that abiding by the Constitution,
maintaining the status quo and promoting peace should be the guiding
principles for cross-strait relations, Wang observed, adding that the
president also reaffirmed the "five noes" promises he made in his
inaugural speech and did not rule out any possible development of
cross-strait relations.
</P>
<P>
These factors, according to Wang, should help the mainland China
authorities rethink their "anti-secession law." The proposed law,
aimed at providing a legal basis for the use of force against Taiwan
should it declare independence, will be put to review and is expected
to be approved by the National People's Congress, the mainland's
rubber-stamp parliament, in March.
</P>
<P>
"These factors should help China consider the postponement of its
enactment, or even make its content less hostile toward Taiwan," Wang
claimed.
</P>
<P>
He also said Chen's reaffirmation of his "five noes" has pointed
out a clear path for the nation and should help stabilize domestic
politics in the longer term.
</P>
<P>
The "five noes" refers to Chen's promise that during his term, he
will not declare independence for Taiwan, will not change the
official name of the country, will not include the "state-to-state"
theory in the Constitution, will not promote a referendum to change
the cross-strait status quo and will not abolish the Guidelines for
National Unification and the National Unification Council.
</P>
<P>
Wang also said that the Cabinet's major military procurement
project will have to follow set procedure.
</P>
<P>
The Cabinet should first send a proposed statute concerning the
procurement and that after it clears the legislature, the Cabinet can
make a special budget on the purchase and send the budget proposal to
the legislature for review.
</P>
<P>
Wang's remarks came amid media rumors that the ruling and
opposition parties might have clinched a deal on the arms purchase
project following the Chen-Soong meeting.
</P>
<P>
Soong said after his meeting with the president Thursday that his
party opposes the arms deal -- a proposal to buy six Patriot Pac-3
anti-missile batteries, eight conventional submarines and a squadron
of 12 P-3C anti-submarine aircraft from the United States -- in the
last legislature because it disagreed with the items and price of the
weapons.
</P>
<P>
Because of the opposition of the PFP and the main opposition
Kuomintang, the arms purchase statute was not even put on the agenda
in the last legislature.
</P>
<P>
But Soong said Thursday that "we cannot buy nothing, but we also
cannot accept everything as it is." He added that his party will
rigorously screen the budget proposal submitted by the Executive
Yuan.

TAIWAN CONSUMER'S CONFIDENCE REGAINS GROUND: POLL
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Feb.  25 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taiwan consumers have regained their
confidence in the country's overall economic prospects over the next
six months, particularly in stock market investment, an economic
think-tank quoted the results of a recent poll as indicating Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Taiwan consumer confidence index (CCI) stood at 76.96 points
in February, up 1.11 points over the January figure, according to a
report by the Taiwan Economic Development Center under National
Central University, which authorized the poll.
</P>
<P>
All six indexes used in the CCI composite factors showed gains in
a poll of ordinary consumers conducted in mid-February, according to
the center.
</P>
<P>
The index on the question whether it is opportune to invest in
the Taiwan bourse in the next six months was up by 2.10 points to
61.30 points, marking the largest surge of all six indexes, the
pollsters said.
</P>
<P>
Second to the stock investment climate index was the index on the
economic prospects over the next six months, which rose 1.30 points
over January's level to 76.40 points.
</P>
<P>
The four other indexes of the CCI also rose, by 1.05 percent,
1.00 percent, 0.80 percent and 0.40 percent, respectively, over
questions on household economy over the next six months, the domestic
employment situation, domestic commodity prices, and whether it is
opportune to increase purchases of durable goods in the next six
months, in that order, according to the poll results.
</P>
<P>
The telephone poll of 2,029 randomly selected adults islandwide
was conducted jointly by Fujen Catholic University and the Taiwan
Research Institute Feb. 18-22. It had a margin of error of 2.2
percentage points.

PREMIER PLEDGES TO FOLLOW POLICY OF COEXISTENCE, RECONCILIATION
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Feb.  25 (CNA)
(By Y. F. Low)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Premier Frank Hsieh pledged Friday to
follow a policy of "coexistence and reconciliation" to build up a
"healthy Taiwan" and facilitate relations with mainland China.
</P>
<P>
Delivering his first policy report to the new legislature, Hsieh
said that Taiwan must hold to the principles of peace and equality in
terms of cross-Taiwan Strait relations in order to safeguard the
Taiwan identity.
</P>
<P>
According to the premier, Taiwan must resolve the "zero-sum"
partisan confrontation in domestic politics before it can stand
united to demand that the mainland remove its military threat against
the nation.
</P>
<P>
Expressing his opposition to Beijing's "one country, two systems"
proposal for unification and its proposal to use an "anti-secession
law" as the legal basis for an invasion of Taiwan should Taiwan
declare independence, Hsieh said the people of Taiwan anticipate
peace and stability across the strait and will defend the country's
sovereignty, security and dignity.
</P>
<P>
The pursuit of the Taiwan identity should be based on solidarity
rather than on confrontation and dissent, Hsieh said.
</P>
<P>
The premier said he expects coexistence and reconciliation to
start from interaction between the Executive Yuan and Legislative
Yuan, terminating the vicious struggle between the ruling and
opposition parties, renewing hope for the people and creating yet
another "Taiwan miracle."
</P>
<P>
The ideas of coexistence and reconciliation mean a balanced
development of the economy, social justice and environment to form a
"golden triangle," according to Hsieh.
</P>
<P>
To achieve this goal, the government will build up a "healthy
Taiwan" backed by a healthy people, a vital economy, sustainable
environment, peace, efficient government and trustful society, he
said.
</P>
<P>
He said the Cabinet will humbly heed the opinions of all sectors
for solutions to the various challenges, which include the magnetic
effect of the mainland's booming economy, cross-strait tension,
widening wealth discrepancies, the financial crisis of the National
Health Insurance program, environmental pollution, ethnic conflicts
and worsening law and order.

KMT TO PROMOTE FURTHER CROSS-STRAIT CHARTER FLIGHT SERVICES
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Feb. 25 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Lien
Chan said Friday that he will promote cross-Taiwan Strait charter
flights on holidays and cross-strait charter cargo flights, as well
as opening the mainland China market to Taiwan agricultural products.
</P>
<P>
Speaking during a KMT Central Standing Committee meeting, Lien
said that with the successful completion of cross-strait charter
flights during the Chinese New Year holiday, the KMT will continue
to push for similar charter flights during other holidays.
</P>
<P>
Charter cargo flights will help save costs for businesses and
will provide great opportunities for airline operators, Lien said,
adding that Taiwan farmers have also long hoped for an opening of the
mainland market to their produce.
</P>
<P>
The KMT will promote the amendment of related bills in the
legislature, Lien said.
</P>
<P>
The KMT legislative caucus will also organize a delegation to
visit the mainland, he added.
</P>
<P>
Two KMT legislators also proposed Friday a "normalization" of
cross-strait charter flights.
</P>
<P>
John Chang and Chu Fong-chi said that based on the experience of
operating charter flights during Chinese New Year in 2003 and 2005,
the KMT believes it can further promote cross-strait charter flight
services.
</P>
<P>
Dependent on the market needs, the two sides of the Taiwan Strait
can open charter flights during weekends, and passengers aboard such
flights should not be confined to mainland-based Taiwan businessmen
but should be open to Republic of China nationals with valid travel
documents to the mainland, mainland Chinese spouses who have yet to
obtain ROC IDs, and mainland Chinese people who are permitted to
visit Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Chang also said that in addition to charter cargo flights, there
should also be charter cargo shipping.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, an official of the Taipei Airlines Association (TAA)
pointed out that the demand for charter flights during the
Tombsweeping Day period are not as heavy as at Chinese New Year
holiday.

</P>
<P>
Su Hsien-jung, TAA secretary-general, made the remarks after the
Taiwan Affairs Office in mainland China called for speedy
consultations on the flights for April 5 Tombsweeping Day.
</P>
<P>
Against the background of the executives of six Taiwan airlines
recently being invited by Beijing's Civil Aviation Administration of
China to a Spring Festival party in Beijing, and since Taiwan is
promoting cross-strait cargo charter services, Su said only that the
two sides are communicating on the issue.
</P>
<P>
But he added that as long as both sides of the Taiwan Strait can
keep up the good atmosphere in the wake of the successful Jan.
29-Feb. 20 Chinese New Year holiday charter flights, it will represent
"progress" in cross-strait relations.

(By Deborah Kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Whether members of Taiwan's agricultural
sector should be allowed to invest in mainland China or relocate part
of their operations to the mainland is an issue to be decided in
accordance with national policies, officials from the Council of
Agriculture said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Council officials said that there are already established
regulations governing Taiwan businesses who wish to make investments
in the mainland, and Taiwan farmers or related companies should also
observe the regulations regarding such investments.
</P>
<P>
Those individuals or businesses that want to invest on the
mainland should do all they can to keep their roots in Taiwan as well
as protecting their technologies and intellectual property, the
council said, adding that investors should also avoid developments
that may eventually compromise their rights and interests.
</P>
<P>
The council officials made the remarks in response to a news
conference held by the Taiwan Affairs Office under Beijing's State
Council where State Council Economic Bureau Deputy Director Tang Yi
said that mainland China welcomes the Taiwan agricultural sector to
make investments on the mainland and that mainland authorities would
help Taiwanese farmers develop operations there.
</P>
<P>
The mainland authorities will also spare no effort to facilitate
agricultural cooperation across the Taiwan Strait and promote sales
of Taiwanese agricultural products on the mainland, Tang added.

TAIWAN PER-CAPITA GNP, GDP EXPECTED TO HIT NEW HIGHS FOR 2005: DGBAS
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Feb. 25 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taiwan's per-capita gross national product
(GNP) and per-capita gross domestic product (GDP) for 2005 will hit
new highs of US$15,639 and US$15,036, respectively, according to the
newest government statistics.
</P>
<P>
Statistics worked out by the advisory members of the
Cabinet-level Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and
Statistics (DGBAS) in a Thursday meeting showed that Taiwan's
consumer price index (CPI) will grow by 1.67 percent this year and
that GNP will reach NT$11.969 trillion (US$354.2 billion) -- a
translation of a per-capita GNP of US$15,639 and a per-capita GDP of
US$15,036 -- both record highs.
</P>
<P>
According to DGBAS Director-General Hsu Chang-yao, the advisory
members adjusted downward their growth forecast for Taiwan's economy
to 4.21 percent in 2005 from the previous prediction of 4.56 percent.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan's economy expanded by 5.71 percent in 2004, with its CPI
increasing by 1.62 percent and GNP hitting around NT$10.5848 trillion
-- equivalent to a per-capita GNP of US$14,032.
</P>
<P>
Hsu pointed out that Taiwan's foreign trade will slow this year
due to a less vigorous global economy. However, he is still
optimistic about continued expansion in the domestic economy, which
will be sustained by local demand spurred by increased consumer
spending and investment from the private sector.
</P>
<P>
According to the latest assessments made public by Global
Insight, Inc. in February, the global economy will contract this
year, with its expansion rate shrinking to 3.3 percent from the year
earlier level of 4.1 percent. Growth in international trade volume
will also drop to 4.2 percent from 8.9 percent year-on-year.

New York Times: Bush and Putin Mute
Differences, Latching on to the Affirmative.

U.S. President Bush and President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia
chose to stand together and emphasize the narrowing areas where
their nations could agree after their private meeting in Bratislava,
Slovakia on Thursday. The presidents focused their remarks after the
meeting on personal trust and on commitments to fight terrorism and
control the spread of weapons or materials terrorists might use.
Their private remarks remained, for the most part, private, but some
political analysts took the public comments as evidence that Bush had
ceded an opportunity to challenge Mr. Putin forcefully on his
increasingly autocratic stand.

Wall Street Journal: Ripple Effect, In Putin's Backyard Democracy
Stirs -- With U.S. Help.

Mike Stone, a former journalist from East Moline, Ill., runs a
nonpartisan print press business owned by the U.S. government in
Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan, which provides a crucial tool to the opposition
activists trying to oust the autocratic regime there. As tension
mounts ahead of key parliamentary elections this Sunday, Stone's shop
provides the only print-media outlet for opponents of longtime
President Askar Akayev.

U.S. ARMS PURCHASE SHOULDN'T BE LISTED IN ANNUAL BUDGET: DEFENSE HEAD
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Minister of National Defense Lee Jye said
Friday he is opposed to including the U.S. weaponry purchase package
in the nation's annual budget.
</P>
<P>
Lee made the remarks in a question-and-answer session in the
Legislative Yuan amid reports that the ruling and opposition parties
have clinched a deal on the arms purchase after a meeting between
President Chen Shui-bian and opposition People First Party (PFP)
Chairman James Soong Thursday,
</P>
<P>
The Cabinet proposed a special budget in mid-2004 to purchase six
Patriot PAC-3 anti-missile batteries, eight diesel-fueled submarines
and a squadron of 12 P-3C anti-submarine aircraft, but the budget was
not approved in the legislature because of opposition by the PFP and
the Kuomintang.
</P>
<P>
Lee said that he has already arranged for a meeting with Soong to
talk about the arms purchase, although when has yet to be decided.
</P>
<P>
Any request by the PFP to include the arms purchase in the
regular annual budget would be unacceptable since the result would be
that other budgets would be squeezed, Lee said.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that Taiwan should maintain an independent and
credible defense force to safeguard the security of Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
The point reached by the U.S.-Japan Security Consultative
Committee meeting last Saturday, in which both sides agreed to the
need for a peaceful solution of the Taiwan Strait issue, does not
mean that Taiwan should forego the U.S. arms purchase, Lee said.

FUTURE CROSS-STRAIT POLICY HINGES ON 'ANTI-SECESSION LAW': PREMIER
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Feb.  25 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Premier Frank Hsieh said Friday the
government's future policy regarding relations across the Taiwan
Strait will hinge on the so-called "anti-secession law" expected to
be enacted by Beijing in March.
</P>
<P>
Hsieh made the remarks during a Legislative Yuan interpellation
session where Legislator Lin Ping-kun of the opposition Non-Partisan
Solidarity Union demanded that the Cabinet work out a timetable for
opening direct cross-strait trade, postal and transportation
links, commonly known as the "three links."
</P>
<P>
Hsieh said promoting the "three links" has been the government's
long-standing policy, but their implementation must take into
consideration Taiwan people's feelings and whether mainland China can
show goodwill toward Taiwan, the premier added.
</P>
<P>
As the National People's Congress -- mainland China's
rubber-stamp parliament -- is scheduled to pass the "anti-secession
law" targeting Taiwan, Hsieh said the government will adopt a
wait-and-see attitude before deciding on its future cross-strait work
agenda.
</P>
<P>
"Taiwan has offered numerous olive branches. We must take into
account our people's feelings before we decide on whether to take
active steps to forge direct cross-strait 'three links.' We must now
pause to see whether mainland China is willing to start constructive
interactions with us or if it is going to intensify its intimidation
and suppression of us. We must at least wait and see the contents of
this 'anti-session law,'" Hsieh said.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the opening of direct cross-strait "three links"
involves many complex technical issues, Hsieh said the two sides must
negotiate first if anything is to happen. The smooth conclusion of
the special Chinese Lunar New Year charter flights for Taiwan
businessmen operating on the mainland was provisional in nature,
Hsieh said, adding that the flights marked a modest breakthrough in
long-stalled cross-strait ties.
</P>
<P>
In the future, Hsieh said, the government wants to promote
convenient cross-strait cargo transport services based on the
foundation laid out in the just-concluded lunar new year charter
flights.
</P>
<P>
As a matter of fact, Hsieh said, the government already finalized
a comprehensive evaluation of the feasibility of opening direct
cross-strait shipping and air links last August.
</P>
<P>
"We are now waiting for mainland China's goodwill response and an
opportune time to implement the policy," Hsieh said.
</P>
<P>
As to Lin's suggestion that the offshore island county of Penghu
be used as an entrepot before the opening of direct transportation
links, Hsieh said the Cabinet will not oppose such a proposal so long
as national security will not be compromised and technical problems
can be overcome.
</P>
<P>
At present, cross-strait transportation services must be
conducted via a third place, usually Hong Kong or Macau. Lin, a
lawmaker representing the Penghu constituency, suggested that Penghu
be used as a cross-strait transit stop.

KAOHSIUNG, BELIZE CITY FORGE SISTERHOOD TIES
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei, Feb. 25 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taiwan's southern port city of Kaohsiung
forged a sisterhood tie Friday with Belize City in Central America to
boost bilateral cooperation in various fields.
</P>
<P>
Acting Kaohsiung Mayor Chen Chi-mai and Belize City Mayor William
David Fonseca inked the accord.
</P>
<P>
Chen noted that as both Kaohsiung and Belize are coastal cities
and signed a fishing cooperation agreement earlier, the sisterhood
ties are expected to make bilateral relations even closer.
</P>
<P>
Chen said the cooperative relationship was made possible by the
visits to ROC diplomatic allies in Latin America last year by
President Chen Shui-bian and Premier Frank Hsieh, who was then
Kaohsiung mayor.
</P>
<P>
The acting mayor, who has been an avid scuba diver for 10 years,
said that he has dived in East Asian countries but hopes one day to
be able to dive in Latin America.
</P>
<P>
Fonseca said that Taiwan has provided assistance on agricultural
technology to Belize, and he is hoping that bilateral relations will
be even strengthened after the sisterhood ties.
</P>
<P>
He also extended an invitation to Chen Chi-mai to visit Belize
during his tenure.
</P>
<P>
Fonseca arrived in Taiwan Wednesday for a five-day visit. He
traveled to Kaohsiung on Thursday to attend Lantern Festival
activities.
</P>
<P>
Belize City is the largest city in Belize. The city has a
population of about 60,000. Some 1,500 Taiwan expatriates reside
there.
</P>
<P>
Belize City is the 22nd foreign city to establish sisterhood ties
with Kaohsiung since it first cooperated with Honolulu in 1962.

TSU TO SPEARHEAD SIGNATURE DRIVE FEB. 28 AGAINST 'ANTI-SECESSION LAW'
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Feb.  25 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The pro-independence Taiwan Solidarity
Union (TSU) will launch a petition next Monday against the so-called
"anti-secession law" expected to be enacted by Beijing in March, the
party's chairman announced Friday.
</P>
<P>
TSU Chairman Su Chin-chiang said the party will set up booths at
19 locations around Taiwan, including the Lungshan Temple in Taipei,
for people to sign the petition Feb. 28 against Beijing's
anti-secession legislation targeting Taiwan. That day is a national
holiday known as Peace Memorial Day.
</P>
<P>
Su urged people to come and support the party's campaign to show
their Taiwanese consciousness and protect Taiwanese identity, which
he said is separate from that of China.
</P>
<P>
The signature drive will be held from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m., Su said.
</P>
<P>
On that afternoon, the party will sponsor a "light up beautiful
Taiwan" activity in cooperation with five pro-independence academic
groups, including the Northern Taiwan Society, to underscore their
commitment to protecting Taiwan from annexation by China, Su said.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Su said, the TSU will organize an "anti-annexation
and protect Taiwan" parade in the southern port city of Kaohsiung
March 6 to rally public support for the party's cause.

EXPORT ORDER VALUE IN JANUARY WORTH OVER US$18 BILLION: MOEA
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Feb.  25 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The value of export orders placed for
Taiwan companies in January totaled US$18.42 billion, a jump of 32.2
percent over the previous year's level, the Ministry of Economic
Affairs (MOEA) reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
MOEA officials said that the more than 30 precent growth was
helped by a lower basis posted in January last year, when there were
fewer work days due to the Chinese New Year holidays.
</P>
<P>
According to tallies released by the MOEA's Statistics
Department, January orders for electronics products rose the most in
value, some US$820 million, or a rise of 26.9 percent, as compared to
the 2004 level. Orders for precision instruments registered the
second-highest increase in value at US$630 million, or an annual
growth rate of 118.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
The value of export orders for electronics goods was the highest
among all orders at US$3.879 billion, followed by those for
information technology and telecommunications products, which were
worth US$3.01 billion, the statistics showed.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the country's industrial index stood at 124.75
for January, an annual expansion of 13 percent but a 4.65 percent
fall from the December 2004 level.
</P>
<P>
The manufacturing index also increased by 12.69 percent year on
year to 127.06 in January, but was down by 4.5 percent as compared to
the month-earlier level, according to the same tallies.
</P>
<P>
Statistics Department Director-General Chang Yaw-tzong said that
the 12.69 percent growth rate is encouraging but added that it is
worth noting that it is unclear whether this signifies that the
manufacturing sector has effectively rebounded.
</P>
<P>
Expressing concern that the global economy will not be as brisk
this year as it was last year and partly due to last year's good
performance, Chang said that a growth rate of more than 5 percent in
domestic manufacturing output value will be hard to achieve again in
the near term.
</P>
<P>
Private sector investment and consumer spending will be needed to
underpin its future course, he added.
</P>
<P>
Despite concerns that Taiwan's outbound shipments are likely to
shrink for the whole of this year, he forecast that the value of
export orders for Taiwan companies will still increase by around 10
percent on strong demand for raw materials for steel and plastics
goods as well as for IT products and precision instruments.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, an MOEA survey showed that some 44 percent of the
Taiwan businesses expected to receive fewer orders in February than
in January, in contrast to 18.6 percent who foresaw better business.

<P>
ROC Minister of Foreign Affairs
Tan Sun Chen concluded a two-day visit to the Dominican Republic
Thursday and headed for Haiti to continue his Caribbean
diplomatic tour aimed at cementing the Republic of China's relations
with its allies in the region.
</P>
<P>
Chen met with Dominican Republic President Leonel Fernandez Reyna
shortly after his arrival on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Chen expressed the ROC government's gratitude
to the Dominican Republic for its support for Taiwan's cause in the
international arena, including Taiwan's bid to join major
international organizations. Chen also said the ROC is willing to
assist the Dominican Republic in building a science-based industrial
park and develop its high-tech industries. Chen further said the ROC
government will encourage its entrepreneurs to invest in the
Dominican Republic.
</P>
<P>
On behalf of President Chen Shui-bian, Chen invited Fernandez to
include Taiwan on the list of stops in his Asian trip in April that
will take him to Japan and Singapore. Fernandez accepted the
invitation, saying that it will be his fourth visit to Taiwan.
Fernandez assured Chen that he will continue to boost bilateral
relations and cooperation in the future.
</P>
<P>
During his stay, Chen also met with many other Dominican Republic
political heavyweights, including Vice President Rafael Albuquerque,
Minister of Foreign Affairs Carlos Morales Troncoso and congressional
leaders.
</P>
<P>
Chen and Morales signed a letter of intent expressing the two
countries' intention to sign a bilateral free trade agreement to
further expand trade and economic cooperation. On behalf of President
Fernandez, Morales conferred a medal on Chen in recognition of his
contribution to promoting bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
This is Chen's first Caribbean trip since he assumed his current
post last April.

PREMIER COULD RESHUFFLE CABINET IN AUGUST
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Feb.  25 (CNA)
(By Y.F. Low)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Premier Frank Hsieh said Friday that he
will make an examination of all members of his Cabinet, including
himself, in August in consideration of a possible reshuffle.
</P>
<P>
Hsieh told lawmakers during a legislative interpellation session
that he will step down if the examination finds that all his
colleagues are at odds with him.
</P>
<P>
However, if only a few of them do not see eye-to-eye with him,
these few members will have to leave, Hsieh said.
</P>
<P>
Hsieh assumed the premiership on Feb. 1 with most members of the
previous Cabinet led by Yu Shyi-kun being retained.
</P>
<P>
On the issue of national identity, Hsieh said the enactment of
the Referendum Law in 2003 has established the meaning of Taiwan's
identity because the law has virtually defined the nationals of the
Republic of China as comprising solely the 23 million people on
Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
This marks a clear difference from the past when the government
used to claim that "the ROC has 1.2 billion or 1.3 billion people"
including those on mainland China, Hsieh pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Hsieh said the ROC has been "Taiwanized" in reality and that the
ROC system and the Taiwan system are often interchangeable.
</P>
<P>
Hsieh agreed that the ROC Constitution that is being implemented
in Taiwan fails to reflect the reality that Taiwan and the mainland
are two separate countries, and the regulations and organizations
governing mainland affairs are also remnants of the "one China"
framework.
</P>
<P>
However, Taiwan cannot change the Constitution at will to make it
fit the status quo because of pressure from the international
community led by the United States and Japan, which believe that
Taiwan will escalate tensions with the mainland if it amends its
Constitution to change the official name of the country, Hsieh said.
</P>
<P>
In light of the international and cross-strait situations as well
as Taiwan's security, the campaign for a change to the official name
of the country should be promoted by civic groups or the opposition
parties, not by the government, he said.
</P>
<P>
Also, he continued, the name-change plan for organizations,
schools and companies bearing the word "China" and "Chinese" should
be carried out based on practical needs, such as to avoid confusion
with those on the mainland.
</P>
<P>
For example, the state-run China Steel Corp. has always been
mistaken as a mainland-based company, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Hsieh made the remarks one day after President Chen Shui-bian
reaffirmed his "five noes" commitment, which included no independence
for Taiwan, no change to the official name of the country and no
referendum on independence or unification during his term.
</P>
<P>
Chen also said that constitutional reforms will not involve
changes to national sovereignty, territory and the cross-strait
status quo.
</P>
<P>
The pro-independence Taiwan Solidarity Union, which is promoting
a campaign for a new constitution and calling the country "Taiwan, "
has criticized Chen as betraying Taiwan's identity and the founding
ideals of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) for making
such a declaration, which was released after a meeting with
opposition People First Party Chairman James Soong.
</P>
<P>
Regarding the criticism, Hsieh said the president's efforts to
seek reconciliation with the opposition parties should not be
mistaken as abandoning the ideals of the DPP.
</P>
<P>
Hsieh pointed out that the meeting between Chen and Soong has
invited attack from supporters of both the pan-green and pan-blue
camps, which he said proves that the DPP is on the right track -- the
middle way.

TAIWAN'S UNEMPLOYMENT RATE DROPS TO 44-MONTH LOW: DGBAS
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Feb. 25 (CNA)
(By Huang Kwang-chun)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taiwan's unemployment rate dropped to 4.06
percent in January, the lowest since May 2001, when the unemployment
rate was 4.22 percent, according to statistics released Friday by the
Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics (DGBAS).
</P>
<P>
The January jobless rate is equal to an unemployed workforce of
about 419,000 people, down by 3,000 from the December figure, or a
fall of 0.03 percentage points month-to-month. It also marks a
decrease rate of 0.47 percentage points from the previous year's
level, the statistics show.
</P>
<P>
Liu Pei-cheng, a DGBAS deputy bureau chief, said that the January
unemployment rate was lower than Germany's 12.1 percent, France's 9.9
percent, Canada's 7 percent, Hong Kong's 6.4 percent, the United
States' 5.2 percent and Japan's 4.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
Singapore and South Korea outperformed Taiwan with 3.7 percent
and 3.6 percent, respectively, while Great Britain had a low of 2.8
percent, he added.
</P>
<P>
In terms of educational background, workers who have a senior
high school education were the most affected, posting an average
unemployment rate of 4.62 percent in January.
</P>
<P>
Junior high school and elementary school graduates registered an
average unemployment rate of 3.78 percent for the same month,
followed by 3.68 percent recorded among those with a university
undergraduate or advanced degree.
</P>
<P>
In terms of age, the jobless rate stood at a high of 9.77 percent
among those aged between 15 and 24, the highest rate among the
various age groups, against 3.71 percent of those aged between 25 and
44 and 3.68 percent of those aged between 45 and 64.

<P>
Mainland China should offer concrete
protection for Taiwan-developed agricultural biotechnology and
patent rights, a senior mainland affairs official said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Mainland Affairs Council Vice Chairman Chiu Tai-shan made the
remarks after a mainland Chinese official said earlier in the day
that Beijing authorities welcome Taiwan farmers to invest in mainland
China.
</P>
<P>
Chiu said Taiwan has not imposed any restrictions on agricultural
exchanges across the Taiwan Strait. Judging from official tallies,
Chiu said, Taiwan has imported more agricultural goods from mainland
China than vice versa.
</P>
<P>
Stressing that Taiwan has enjoyed fame in the international
community for its agricultural biotechnology development, Chiu said
Taiwan's farmers and agriculturalists have been reluctant to invest
in mainland China mainly because the mainland has failed to give
strict protection for their patent rights and technological know-how.

<P>
An official delegation led by Minister of
Finance Lin Chuan will depart for the United States and Europe next
week to woo foreign investments in Taiwan's privatization of
state-run banks and enterprises, a spokesman for the Finance Ministry
announced Friday.
</P>
<P>
According to the spokesman, Lin is slated to hold large
investment seminars and one-on-one meetings in New York March 3-4 and
in London March 7.
</P>
<P>
Officials from the Ministry of Finance, the Council for Economic
Planning and Development, the Financial Supervisory Commission,
Taiwan Tobacco and Liquor Corporation (TTLC) and seven leading public
financial services, such as Mega Financial Holding and Hua Nan
Financial Holding, will form the mission to invite foreign capital to
Taiwan, he said.
</P>
<P>
The delegation's trips to New York and London form part of the

financial and banking institutions to increase domestic financial
services' market shares and competitiveness in Asia and the rest of
the world, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Executives of prominent international investment banks,

<P>
Lin Teng-cheng, director of the Department of the National
Treasury under the Finance Ministry, said that the privatization plan

BEIJING URGED TO CLEAR POLITICAL BARRIERS IN NEGOTIATING WITH TAIWAN
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Feb. 25 (CNA)
(By Huang Kwang-chun)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taiwan's top mainland policy planner urged
Beijing to tear down the political barriers it has erected in
negotiating with Taiwan and to facilitate the establishment of a
framework for peaceful and stable cross-strait interactions,
according to a statement issued Friday by the Mainland Affairs
Council (MAC).
</P>
<P>
MAC Chairman Joseph Wu said in an interview with Reuters Thursday
that it is necessary to establish a mechanism to regulate the conduct
of the two sides of the Taiwan Strait to avoid a crisis or conflict
in the region.
</P>
<P>
Such a mechanism would also facilitate the establishment of
mutual trust between the two sides and create a friendly environment
for bilateral cooperation, Wu stressed.
</P>
<P>
He called on Beijing to abandon its military intimidation and
diplomatic blockade against Taiwan and to enter good faith
negotiations with Taiwan on matters of mutual concern.
</P>
<P>
President Chen Shui-bian's repeated initiative to set up a
committee for cross-strait peace and development and guidelines for
the stable and peaceful development of cross-strait ties is evidence
that Taiwan has been working hard for peace and stability in the
Taiwan Strait, he went on.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the cross-strait status quo is based on the existing
Republic of China Constitution, he said that the final arrangement of
cross-strait relations should be subject to the consent of the 23
million people of Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
A proposal presented by Kenneth Lieberthal for Taipei and Beijing
to negotiate a 20- to 30-year framework for stability across the
Taiwan Strait could serve as a reference to a certain extent, he
commented.
</P>
<P>
The top mainland policy formulator also urged the international
community to help stop Beijing from enacting a proposed
"anti-secession law, " which he said will unilaterally change the
cross-strait status quo.

U.S. DEFENSE DEP'T URGED TO SELL AEGIS DESTROYERS TO TAIWAN
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Washington,  Feb.  25  (CNA)
(By Jorge Liu and P.c.tang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A member of the U.S. House of
Representatives on Friday urged the U.S. Defense Department to sell
destroyers equipped with the Aegis missile defense system to Taiwan
to counter China's proposed anti-secession law.
</P>
<P>
Rep. Robert Andrews (D-N.J.) made the appeal in a letter sent to
Douglas J. Feith, under secretary of defense responsible for
formulating defense planning guidance and force policy as well as
relations with foreign countries, to voice his support for the sale
of the Aegis destroyers and the transfer of relevant technologies to
Taiwan in light of China's recent announcement of its intention to
enact such a law.
</P>
<P>
The Standing Committee of the Chinese National People's Congress
adopted a draft of the proposed law last December. The draft will be
reviewed at the congress's annual plenary meeting set to be held next
month.
</P>
<P>
In the letter, the representative said: "The sale of Aegis to
Taiwan would send a clear and direct message to China, showing that
the United States will back the democratic nation and will not accept
any type of military action as a form of resolution between the two
countries."
</P>
<P>
"I believe this action can, and will, be seen by China as a
directive that it approach Taiwan in a civil and non-threatening
manner," he also said.
</P>
<P>
The United States has pledged in its Taiwan Relations Act to
protect the island from any military threat and support the right to
self-determination of its people, Andrews further said, adding that
selling the Aegis missile defense system to the island "is clearly in
line with this pledge and therefore, should be pursued as soon as
possible."
</P>
<P>
The congressman also asked Feith to provide information regarding
any steps that have been taken to advance the sale.

PREMIER URGES BETTER CARE FOR DISADVANTAGED, BETTER SOCIAL ORDER
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei, Feb. 26 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Premier Frank Hsieh urged local
administrative chiefs Saturday to work together with the central
government to better care for the disadvantaged and to improve social
order.
</P>
<P>
Hsieh outlined the goals for such cooperation while meeting in
Taitung, eastern Taiwan with the chiefs of the municipalities, cities
and counties around the nation.
</P>
<P>
The premier said that as a former Kaohsiung City mayor, he has
experienced first-hand the relations between the central and local
governments, adding that this is why he advocates "co-existence and
cooperation" in his new Cabinet, particularly cooperation between the
central and local governments.
</P>
<P>
Hsieh urged first and foremost that local governments take better
care of the underprivileged. Noting that every city and country
around Taiwan has had reports of impoverished school students who
cannot afford to pay their lunch fees, Hsieh said such reports have
hurt the government's image.
</P>
<P>
He urged the local governments to make early preparations to
solve the problem as the central government appropriates NT$700
million (US$22.36 million) in subsidies annually to local
governments, adding that some local governments should also make sure
that the profits from their charity lotteries are used for social
welfare programs.
</P>
<P>
The premier also urged cities and counties to step up tourism
promotion, saying that each city and county should have a major
project to promote tourism so as to be internationally competitive.
</P>
<P>
Hsieh also urged local governments to use their full authority to
enforce the law thoroughly, saying that half-measures are
meaningless. He pointed as an example to the low demolition rate for
buildings erected without license or against building code provisions
which he said has affected the look of many cities and counties.
</P>
<P>
Lastly, the premier called for an improvement in social order,
saying that the central and local government must work together to
better protect citizens and allow them to live their lives free from
fear.
</P>
<P>
On March 1, there will be a "Everyone Working Toward Better
Social Order" campaign, the premier said.
</P>
<P>
All the local chiefs except Keelung Mayor Hsu Tsai-li attended
Saturday's gathering, the first such meeting since Hsieh assumed the
premiership Feb. 1. The chiefs attending included Taipei Mayor Ma
Ying-jeou, acting Kaoshiung Mayor Chen Chi-mai, and Taichung Mayor
Jason Hu. Hsu sent his secretary-general to attend on his behalf.
</P>
<P>
In addition to Hsieh, Vice Premier Wu Rong-i, Executive Yuan
Secretary-General Lee Ying-yuan, Interior Minister Su Jia-chyuan,
Finance Minister Lin Chuan, Economic Affairs Minister Ho Mei-yueh,
Transportation and Communications Minister Lin Ling-san, and other
high-ranking officials attended the meeting.

Top figures in Haiti's provisional
government promised Friday that Haiti will do whatever it can to
support Taiwan's participation in international organizations and the
international community.
</P>
<P>
The Caribbean country's provisional President Bonniface
Alexandre, as well as Premier Gerard Latortue and Foreign Minister
Yvon Simeon made the commitment while meeting separately with Chen
Tan-sun, ROC minister of foreign affairs, who is currently in
Porte-au-Prince for an one-day visit.
</P>
<P>
Saying that the diplomatic and friendly relations between the two
countries have been established on the basis of mutual respect and
recognition, they promised that Haiti, which has maintained official
diplomatic ties with Taiwan for more than forty years, will do its
utmost to support Taiwan's bid to join the international community by
giving all the necessary assistance.
</P>
<P>
The Haitian leaders also expressed their gratitude for Taiwan's
aid over the past years, saying that the Haitians can perceive the
friendship and generosity from Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Pointing out at a press conference held after his talks with
Chen, the Haitian premier said that the meeting with the ROC minister
was a pleasant one, adding that he believes that the relationship
between the two countries will be further strengthened.
</P>
<P>
In response, Chen said that the goal of his visit is to represent
President Chen Shui-bian and the 23 million people of Taiwan to show
their gratitude for Haiti's support for Taiwan's bid to join
international organizations.
</P>
<P>
The minister further said that the purpose of his visit is also
to gain a better understanding of Haiti's democratization process and
to see what Taiwan can do to help the country.

Chen expressed the hope that cooperation between the two
countries will be further enhanced in the future. He also said while

TAIWAN PEOPLE URGED TO OPPOSE BEIJING'S ANTI-SECESSION LAW
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei, Feb. 28 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Leaders of several pro-independence groups
said Saturday that Beijing is trying to demonstrate that Taiwan is
part of China with its proposed "anti-secession law" and urged the
people of Taiwan to unite to vehemently oppose the proposed
legislation.
</P>
<P>
The pro-independence activists made the remarks at an
"Anti-Annexation, Protect Taiwan" seminar held at National Taiwan
Normal University's main campus.
</P>
<P>
The proposed "anti-secession law, " which is widely seen as an
attempt to create the legal basis for the use of force against Taiwan
should the island declare independence, is expected to be approved by
the full National People's Congress, China's rubber-stamp parliament,
in March.
</P>
<P>
Opposition Taiwan Solidarity Union Chairman Su Chin-chiang said
the Taiwan Strait status quo is "one country on each side of the
strait, " adding that there is no question that Taiwan is not part of
the People's Republic of China.
</P>
<P>
The main purpose of the anti-secession law is to bring Taiwan
under the wing of "one China, " and the Taiwan people should be on
guard against this scheme, he said.
</P>
<P>
Koo Kwang-ming, a senior adviser to President Chen Shui-bian,
noted that former U.S. State Secretary Colin Powell had said late
last year that "Taiwan does not enjoy sovereignty as a nation," which
Koo pointed out has sent the wrong message to China.
</P>
<P>
Beijing's "anti-secession law" aims to declare to the world that
Taiwan belongs to China, Koo continued, adding that if the United
States, Japan and other countries do not vehemently oppose the bill,
then it will have a great impact on Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Ng Chiau-tong, chairman of World United Formosans for
Independence, said that Taiwan is already a de facto sovereign state,
and that it must now fight for de jure statehood.
</P>
<P>
Juan Ming, an adviser to President Chen, said the Taiwan people
must unite to build their own country, adding that the government
should continue its drive to rectify the nation's official
designation and to write a new Constitution.
</P>
<P>
Professor Liao Hung-hsiang of the National Defense University
pointed out that Beijing has been observing the response of Taiwan
and the international community for reference in formulating the
anti-secession law. If Beijing decides to adopt the toughest version,
former President Lee Teng-hui could even be extradited to China for
trial should he go overseas, Liao added.
</P>
<P>
Participants in the seminar also included professors from various
colleges and universities around Taiwan as well as Reverend Kao
Chun-ming of the Presbyterian Church in Taiwan.

<P>
The ruling Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) will present next week a draft bill regulating the exercise of
the mission-oriented National Assembly's powers.
</P>
<P>
Ker Chien-ming, executive director of the DPP's policy committee,
noted that the party will consider the bill as a priority as the
Central Election Commission plans to elect some 300 National Assembly
delegates on May 14. The delegates will be assigned exclusively for
the job of reviewing a draft package of constitutional amendments
passed by the Legislative Yuan last year.
</P>
<P>
The Legislative Yuan passed several constitutional amendment
proposals in August last year, including the halving of the number of
seats in the current 225-seat legislature, the adoption of a "single
seat, two votes" legislative election system, and the abrogation of
the National Assembly.
</P>
<P>
As the ruling and opposition party lawmakers were divided on what
percentage of National Assembly delegate votes should be required to
approve a constitutional revision, the National Assembly operation
bill did not clear the previous legislature.
</P>
<P>
Ker said his party will again send the draft bill to the
legislature next week and will ask Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang
Jin-pyng to hastily call the legislators of the various parties
together to discuss the bill in order to facilitate quick passage.

<P>
The general public will recognize and
understand the efforts made by President Chen Shui-bian in promoting
inter-party reconciliation and cooperation, a Presidential Office
official said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
James Huang, vice secretary-general of the Presidential Office,
was referring to Thursday's meeting between President Chen and
opposition People First Party (PFP) James Soong.
</P>
<P>
Huang's remarks came in response to former President Lee
Teng-hui's comments ridiculing the meeting between the head of state
and the chairman of a "minor party" as "lacking legitimacy and
rationality."
</P>
<P>
Huang said that President Chen has gone out of his way to promote
inter-party reconciliation and cooperation, knowing that the public
has grown tired of the constant wrangling between the ruling and
opposition parties during his time in office.
</P>
<P>
"The president hopes to do more for Taiwan, " Huang said, adding
that he believes the public will understand the president's true
intentions of reconciliation and cooperation.
</P>
<P>
"In fact, the president's approach is in line with the
aspirations of the mainstream public," Huang continued.
</P>
<P>
Former President Lee, while attending an "anti-annexation"
seminar sponsored by local pro-independence groups Saturday, referred
to the Chen-Soong meeting as "ridiculous" and "wrong."
</P>
<P>
Lee said the problem with the Chen-Soong meeting lies in the
10-point consensus they reached, in which President Chen reaffirms
his "five noes," including "no declaration of independence, no change
of the nation's official name, no referendum to change the status quo
of the Taiwan Strait, no inclusion of the 'state-to-state' theory on
cross-strait ties into the Constitution, and no revocation of the
National Unification Guidelines or National Unification Council."
</P>
<P>
The pro-Taiwan independence former president mockingly asked
whether President Chen was representing himself or the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party, or perhaps the PFP or Soong, in the
joint statement.

VICE PRESIDENT CALLS 1947 'A TRAGIC YEAR FOR TAIWAN'
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Feb.  26 (CNA)
(By Y.F. Low)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Vice President Annette Lu on Saturday
called 1947 a tragic year for Taiwan which marked the occurence of
the 228 Incident and the declaration of martial law on the island.
</P>
<P>
Lu made the remarks while addressing a gathering to release an
investigative report by the 228 Incident Memorial Foundation on who
bore responsibility for the incident which led to the arrest and
killing of thousands of native Taiwanese by Kuomintang (KMT) troops
sent from mainland China.
</P>
<P>
The vice president claimed that although a number of large-scale
228 commemorative activities calling for ethnic harmony have been
held on the island in recent years, many young people are not aware
of the truth behind the 228 Incident, with some even mistaking it as
the bombing of Taiwan by U.S. forces.
</P>
<P>
In the past, for fear of offending the KMT government, the 228
Incident was remembered in a low-profile way through a "peace day, "
which Lu said was "not at all a peaceful day, but instead one of
national mourning."
</P>
<P>
The purpose of promoting 228 commemorative events is not to
reopen a historical wound but to seek historical truth, Lu said.
</P>
<P>
Lu expressed the hope that a complete study on the year 1947 will
be available in the future, because in addition to the occurence of
the 228 Incident on Feb. 28 of that year, martial law was declared on
the island on May 19 in the same year.
</P>
<P>
With the 60th anniversary of the declaration of martial law
coming two years from now, Lu said she hopes various sectors of
society will work together to restore the story of 1947 to let the
people of the nation understand the tragedy that took place that
year.
</P>
<P>
She noted that a round-the-island exhibition is set to start on
May 19 at the Taipei Railway Station, in which the top 10 cases of
political miscarriage of justice during the martial law era will be
publicized.
</P>
<P>
Lu clarified that the exhibition is not meant to spark ethnic
strife, saying that the victims of the KMT's authoritarian rule came
from every ethnic group.
</P>
<P>
She said that this is a human rights issue and that the
wrongdoers must be held accountable to history.
</P>
<P>
According to the investigative report, which was drafted by a
team of historians led by Chang Yen-hsien, late Republic of China
President Chiang Kai-shek, who dispatched the KMT troops to Taiwan,
should bear the largest share of responsibility for the 228 Incident.
</P>
<P>
Chen Yi, governor of Taiwan at the time, and Ko Yuan-fen, who was
the Taiwan Garrison Command chief, as well as Peng Meng-chi, the
Kaohsiung garrison commander, also bear some of the responsibility
for the incident, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
Others bearing responsibility include individual and organized
whistle-blowers, journalists and members of some civic organizations,
the report said.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan was handed over to the KMT-led ROC government by the
Japanese colonial rulers in 1945 following Japan's defeat and
surrender in World War II.
</P>
<P>
Bad administration by the KMT rulers caused widespread resentment
among native Taiwanese, which finally erupted into violence after a
tobacco seller in Taipei was beaten while resisting arrest for
selling untaxed cigarettes on Feb. 28, 1947, with a bystander being
shot.
</P>
<P>
Riots were reported around the island in the wake of the
incident, and additional troops were dispatched from the mainland to
suppress the uprisings.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of people, most of whom were elites in Taiwan society,
were arrested or killed in the months that followed.

CIVIC GROUP TO PROMOTE REFERENDUM ON ARMS PURCHASE
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Feb. 26 (CNA)
(By Elisa Kao)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Democratic Action Alliance (DAA) said
Saturday that it will promote a referendum on two major issues for
the country, namely the huge arms purchase plan and several
constitutional revisions passed by the legislature last year.
</P>
<P>
DAA convener Chang Ya-chung expressed the hope that a referendum
could be held on May 14 when local voters will go to the polls to
elect some 300 delegates of the mission-oriented National Assembly
who will be assigned exclusively for the job of reviewing a draft
package of constitutional amendments passed by the legislature last
year.
</P>
<P>
According to Chang, the promotion of the referendum is aimed at
allowing the people to have a say on issues of great importance.
</P>
<P>
Under the NT$610.8 billion arms purchase plan, Taiwan plans to
buy eight diesel-powered submarines, 12 P-3C anti-submarine aircraft
and six PAC-3 Patriot anti-missile batteries from the United States.
The budget plan is still pending approval in the
opposition-controlled legislature.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the much anticipated constitutional reform, the
Legislative Yuan passed several constitutional revision proposals
last year, including the halving of the number of lawmakers in the
225-seat legislature, the adoption of "single seat, two votes"
legislative election system, and the abrogation of the National
Assembly.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the NT$610.8 billion arms procurement project will be
a huge burden on taxpayers over the coming ten years, Chang expressed
regret that the project has been decided by only a few political
figures in closed-door meetings.
</P>
<P>
Also to express their opposition to the constitutional amendment
proposals passed in the legislature, the DAA will invite 151 elites
from around the country to vie for seats on the mission-oriented
National Assembly in order to block the constitutional revision
package.
</P>
<P>
Chang said the Legislative Yuan held four public hearings late
last year to hear the opinions of some 60 scholars and experts on the
constitutional reforms, in which more than 80 percent of the
participants expressed their disapproval with the constitutional
revisions concerning the legislature.
</P>
<P>
However, Chang added, the Legislative Yuan passed the
constitutional revision bill in a day, which he said was an insult to
the experts' knowledge.
</P>
<P>
Chang also solicited the public's support for the alliance's
suggested National Assembly candidates.

COA CALLS FOR MECHANISM TO DEAL WITH CROSS-STRAIT FISHING DISPUTES
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Feb. 26 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The two sides of the Taiwan Strait should
establish a viable mechanism to reasonably resolve bilateral fishing
disputes, the Fishery Administration of the Cabinet-level Council of
Agriculture said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The Fishery Administration made the call after a Kaohsiung-based
fishing boat was forced to sail to a mainland Chinese port a day
earlier after colliding with a mainland fishing boat while operating
in the open sea south of Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
COA officials said cross-strait fishing disputes have occurred
frequently because fishing boats from the two sides have often
operated in the same waters.
</P>
<P>
Against this backdrop, the officials said, the two sides urgently
need to forge a viable mechanism to settle cross-strait fishery
disputes and better protect the rights of fishermen on both sides.
</P>
<P>
The officials said the COA has asked the quasi-official Straits
Exchange Foundation (SEF) to assist in resolving the disputes. The
SEF has in turn asked its Beijing counterpart -- the Association for
Relations Across the Taiwan Strait -- to push mainland authorities to
protect the safety of the Taiwan fishing boat and its crew members,
the officials said.
</P>
<P>
According to the officials, the Kaohsiung-based coastal fishing
trawler "Ching Chi Feng" collided with a mainland fishing boat, the
"Yangxi 22133, " while operating in the open sea south of Hong Kong
Friday. The 19.96-ton "Ching Chi Feng" left the southern Taiwan port
of Kaohsiung Feb. 22, with six crewmen on board.
</P>
<P>
A crew member aboard the "Ching Chi Feng" was forced onto the
mainland boat after the two sides failed to reach an agreement on the
amount of compensation. Three mainland crewmen also boarded the
Taiwan fishing boat to force it to trail behind the mainland vessel
into Yangjiang port in the southern mainland province of Guangdong
for further negotiations.
</P>
<P>
"All the Taiwan crew members are safe and remain free. Both the
Taiwan and mainalnd fishing boats sustained only minor damage in the
collision. The two sides are still negotiating compensation terms, "
a COA official said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a SEF official said the quasi-official intermediary
body already sent a message to its mainland counterpart asking
Beijing to clear up the case. 
</P>
<P>
Taiwan and mainland China split at the end of a civil war more
than five decades ago, and have no official relations. The
160-kilometer-wide Taiwan Strait separating both sides is often the
scene for fishing disputes and smuggling.

LEE EXPRESSES WORRIES ABOUT TRADE AND ECONOMIC POLICIES TOWARDS CHINA
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Feb.  26 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Former President Lee Teng-hui expressed
worries about the government's trade and economic policies toward
mainland China Saturday, cautioning against an attempt by Beijing to
use its economic might to advance its goal of annexing Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
The former president made the remarks while attending an
"Anti-Annexation, Protect Taiwan" seminar held at the National Taiwan
Normal University's main campus.
</P>
<P>
Lee said that he is worried that through rapid cross-strait
"economic integration, " Taiwan could fall into Beijing's trap of
using its increasing economic clout to advance its goal of
unification with Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
If Taiwan's China policy is viewed by other countries as "moving
toward unification sooner or later, " why should they bother helping
Taiwan to beef up its national defense and to reach out to the
international community, Lee asked.
</P>
<P>
Lee noted that the present government's trade policy toward
mainland China is "active opening, effective management, " but he
questioned the "extent of the management."
</P>
<P>
He stressed that economic policy should not be separated from
politics, and that "the government should not be all ears to the
views of the businesspeople."
</P>
<P>
The government should stand on the side of all the people of
Taiwan, taking full consideration of the nation's interests, Lee
said, adding that the government's China policy should have in mind
the nation's economic security and safeguarding the people's "living
rights."
</P>
<P>
He also urged the public to speak out against China's proposed
"anti-secession law" so as not to allow China to unilaterally change
the status quo in the Taiwan Strait as well as to allow Taiwan to
become a "normal" country soon.
</P>
<P>
The "anti-secession law" is set to be approved by the full
National People's Congress, Beijing's rubber-stamp parliament, when
it meets next month.
</P>
<P>
The former president also said that the 228 Incident in 1947 and
the ensuing period of martial law rule had prevented a great majority
of the Taiwan people from "speaking their minds" for many years,
which he said had a detrimental effect on Taiwan's society.
</P>
<P>
However, he added that the 228 Incident, which refers to the
events that led to a brutal crackdown by the Kuomintang government
troops against the local population, particularly the elites, also
provided the Taiwan people with a valuable historical lesson, making
them rethink their "illusions about the motherland" and clarify what
Taiwan's relationship with China should be.
</P>
<P>
Lee said that with the enormous political, economic, social and
cultural divides that exist between Taiwan and China, forcing the two
sides together in an unnatural way would have tragic consequences. He
claimed that especially following their separate developments over
the last half century, Taiwan and China are indeed separate countries
on each side of the strait, politically and culturally.

SPIRIT OF AGREEING TO DISAGREE KEY TO TAIWAN'S UNITY: PRESIDENT
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei, Feb. 26 (CNA)
(By Y.F. Low)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President Chen Shui-bian said Saturday that
the spirit of agreeing to disagree is crucial to ending partisan
confrontation and bringing about unity and stability in Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
If viewed from this perspective, Chen said, his meeting with
opposition People First Party Chairman James Soong two days ago was
of great significance.
</P>
<P>
Chen made the remarks while addressing a luncheon between
Executive Yuan officials and local government chiefs. The comments
were apparently aimed at clarifying criticism by pro-independence
groups in the wake of the Chen-Soong meeting that the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) has betrayed its founding ideals
and Taiwan's identity.
</P>
<P>
The president said agreeing to disagree means seeking common
ground, but this is not tantamount to the abandoning of ideals and
principles.
</P>
<P>
Chen pointed out that he and Soong agreed during the meeting that
the Republic of China as stated in the ROC Constitution is the
largest area of common ground on the issue of national identity
between both sides, although different political parties differ on
their interpretations and beliefs regarding the meaning of the ROC
and the Constitution.
</P>
<P>
Such differences should be respected, reserved and put aside to
facilitate the search for common ground, which will be the basis and
starting point of reconciliation and cooperation between the ruling
and opposition parties, Chen said.
</P>
<P>
According to the president, there are only two choices for Taiwan
-- either to continue along the old path of partisan confrontation or
to seek inter-party reconciliation and cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The people have made a choice and sent a clear message that they
want unity and cooperation instead of division and confrontation,
Chen pointed out.
</P>
<P>
He said it would be impractical to expect the longstanding
differences between the ruling and opposition parties to be resolved
completely in only a few meetings, but it is necessary for them to do
their best to look for points that are acceptable to both sides.
</P>
<P>
While political parties used to interact with each other through
competition and lacked any experience in cooperation in the past, the
Chen-Soong meeting marked the beginning of a new era and a new
milestone for reconciliation and cooperation between the ruling and
opposition parties, he said.
</P>
<P>
The president said the objective of this new model of inter-party
interaction is to make the people of Taiwan the major, final winners,
because it is for the people that political parties exist.
</P>
<P>
This small island of Taiwan cannot afford continued division and
confrontation and requires solidarity in order to stand out in the
world, he added.

ONE-FIFTH OF TAIWAN ADULTS CONSIDERED OBESE: VICE PRESIDENT
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,   Feb.  26  (CNA)
(By Y.F. Low)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
One-fifth of adults in Taiwan are
considered obese owing to excessive protein and fat intake and a lack
of exercise, Vice President Annette Lu said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Lu announced the figure during an Asia-Pacific conference held in
Taipei on the problem of obesity. She based her figure on a standard
established in 2002 under which someone with a body mass index (BMI)
over 24 is considered overweight and someone with a BMI over 27 is
defined as obese.
</P>
<P>
Lu pointed out that 70 percent of diseases are related to
obesity, including diabetes, hyperlipemia and breast cancer, and that
the government has put forth some long-term programs to try to
improve the health of the Taiwan people.
</P>
<P>
According to a report released by the Taiwan Medical Association
for the Study of Obesity at the conference, not getting enough sleep
and working overtime over a long period of time could lead to
obesity.
</P>
<P>
The report was based on a survey of 3,847 workers at electronics
companies in northern Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
It was found that 37 percent of workers who work 12 hours a day
on a rotation basis for more than two-and-half years are obese, which
is higher than the figure of 31 percent among workers who do not work
on a rotation basis.
</P>
<P>
While 36 percent of workers who sleep less than six hours a day
are obese, the figure climbs to 42 percent among those who sleep less
than four hours a day, the report said.
</P>
<P>
This compared with an obesity rate of 29 percent among workers
who sleep at least eight hours a day.
</P>
<P>
Association member Hsiao Tun-jen explained that getting enough
sleep is necessary for the production of leptin in the human body to
control appetite and enhance metabolism.

CEREMONY HELD FOR VICTIMS OF 228 INCIDENT
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  Feb.  26 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Amid drizzling cold rains, nearly 100
family members of victims of the 228 Incident gathered in a park in
downtown Taipei for a religious service Saturday.
</P>
<P>
A Buddhist master read from Buddhist scriptures in the service at
Taipei 228 Memorial Park for the victims of the 228 Incident, which
refers to the series of events in 1947 that led to the brutal
crackdown by the Kuomintang government against the local population.
</P>
<P>
Before the service, Liao Teh-hsiung, president of the Taipei 228
Incident Association, presented an orchid to Taipei Mayor Ma
Ying-jeou.
</P>
<P>
The orchid from Japan is a symbol of peace. In Aug. 6, 1945, all
plants withered after the bombing of Hiroshima, and only a few
orchids only two kilometers from the bombing site survived. The
orchids were later planted in Hiroshima Peace Park. They have become
symbols of peace. This was the first time that any have been sent to
Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Mayor Ma received the orchid, which will later be planted in
front of the 228 memorial hall in the park, and observed one minute
of silence with the family members.
</P>
<P>
Ma, addressing the gathering in the Taiwanese dialect, said that
although 58 years have passed since the tragic event, his heart is
heavy for the suffering of the victims' family members over the
years.
</P>
<P>
He said that the significance of the 228 Incident is that
everyone should pursue and support peace, not just ethnic, but also
cross-strait and world peace.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Vice President Annette Lu said Saturday that she will
promote the unveiling of the truth behind the 228 Incident so that
those who bear responsibility are held accountable to history.
</P>
<P>
Lu made the remarks while attending the inauguration of the
Formosa Heart Association's Kaohsiung chapter in southern Taiwan.

INTER-PARTY RECONCILIATION SHOULD FOCUS ON POLICY ISSUES: POLL
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Feb.  26 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
More than 80 percent of respondents in a
recent public opinion poll said inter-party reconciliation should
focus on public policy issues, a spokesman for the Association of
Taiwanese of Mainland Chinese Origin said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
According to the same survey, 52 percent of the respondents said
they feel that Taiwan faces serious ethnic issues, and nearly 80
percent said they agree with the claim that ethnic issues have mainly
instigated by political figures for partisan interests.
</P>
<P>
The association conducted the survey in Taipei City and Taipei
County, or the greater Taipei area, between Jan. 28-29 to explore
different ethnic groups' views on the 228 Incident and inter-party
reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
Except for Taiwan's 400,000 or so aboriginal citizens, most of
the island's 23 million people are ethnic Chinese. However, this
latter population can be divided into two sub-ethnic groups: the
"mainlanders" whose families fled to Taiwan when the Chinese
Communists took over the mainland in 1949, and the "native Taiwanese"
whose ancestors began arriving on the island in the 17th century or
earlier. Most mainlanders live in northern Taiwan, particularly in
the greater Taipei area.
</P>
<P>
The survey results showed that 52 percent said they think ethnic
issues are serious in Taiwan, while 39 percent said they think
otherwise.
</P>
<P>
A total of 1,042 valid replies were collected in the random
telephone poll on adult residents. The survey is said to have a
margin of error of plus or minus 3.1 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 40 percent said they feel that review or reflection of the
228 Incident, which refers to the events that led to a brutal
crackdown by the Kuomintang (KMT) government troops against local
population, particularly the elites, would aggravate tension among
different ethnic groups, but 36 percent said they think rational
discussion of the tragic incident would contribute to ethnic harmony
and mutual understanding.
</P>
<P>
A cross analysis of the survey results showed that nearly 50
percent of the "mainlander" respondents think discussion of the 228
Incident would deepen ethnic tensions or rifts.
</P>
<P>
While 79.7 percent of the respondents said they agree with the
statement that political figures are to blame for ethnic tensions,
11.5 percent said they disagree with such a claim.
</P>
<P>
Asked whether "mainlanders" should be held responsible for the
228 Incident or the "White Terror" during the KMT government-imposed
martial law era, 68.3 percent said they don't think so, but nearly 20
percent gave a positive reply to the question.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, 80.1 percent said inter-party reconciliation should be
based on stances toward major public policy issues, only 5.9 percent
said reconciliation among political parties should be based on their
stances on Taiwan's future relations with China -- unification or
independence.
</P>
<P>
In addition, 68 percent said they support the proposal that the
two domestic political camps -- the "pan-green" camp of the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) and the Taiwan Solidarity Union
(TSU) and the opposition "pan-blue alliance" of the KMT and the
People First Party (PFP) -- transcend their divides and work for
reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, 72 percent said they believe that inter-party
reconciliation will help ease ethnic tensions, but about 20 percent
said they think otherwise.
</P>
<P>
About 45 percent said they feel the mainlanders' political status
has worsened since the DPP gripped the presidency in 2000; 40 percent
said they feel nothing has changed about the mainlanders' political
status; 6.2 percent said they feel mainlanders' political status has
improved.
</P>
<P>
More than 50 percent said they feel native Taiwanese's political
status has improved; 35 percent said they feel native Taiwanese's
political status remain almost the same; only 8 percent said the
status has worsened.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, 53 percent said they feel Hakka people's political
status has improved; 34 percent said they see no major change; but
2.9 percent said Hakkas' political status has declined.
</P>
<P>
About 42 percent said native Taiwanese have benefited most from
Taiwan's democratization; followed by aborigines (5.8 percent) ;
Hakkas (5.2 percent) ; and mainlanders (3.2 percent) ; while 44.3
percent said they didn't know which ethnic group has benefited most
from democratization.
</P>
<P>
Only 17.4 percent said a presidential candidate's ethnic
background matters in their voting choice, while 81.3 percent said
the candidate's ethnic origin doesn't matter. As to the mainlanders'
general image in local society, 78.5 percent said they hold a
positive view of mainlanders, while 10.5 percent said they hold a
negative impression; the remaining said they didn't have any special
feelings.

MOTC TO PUSH FOR DIRECT CROSS-STRAIT CRUISE BY FOREIGN OCEAN LINERS
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei, Feb. 26 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Ministry of Transportation and
Communications (MOTC) suggested Saturday that the government allow
foreign ocean liners to make direct cruise across the Taiwan Strait
to help boost tourist arrivals.
</P>
<P>
Lin Chih-ming, an MOTC department chief in charge of navigation
affairs, said major domestic ports, such as Keelung Harbor, Taichung
Harbor and Kaohsiung Harbor, all have passenger wharves to
accommodate ocean liners.
</P>
<P>
"Taiwan is now not a major stop for foreign ocean liners. If we
allow them to make direct cross-strait cruise, we'll be able to
attract foreign tourist liners to include Taiwan into their
itinerary," Lin said.
</P>
<P>
Should that be the case, Lin said, local travel agencies can
organize half-day or one-day tour package for passengers aboard the
foreign ocean liners.
</P>
<P>
"We believe the opening measure will help the government realize
its goal of doubling tourist arrivals by 2008," Lin said.
</P>
<P>
According to Lin, a Southeast Asia-based ocean liner once planned
to make a port call at Taiwan and then sail directly to Shanghai,
but the plan was later dropped due to Taiwan's ban on direct
cross-strait shipping links.
</P>
<P>
As the new opening measure is related with the government's
mainland policy, Lin said the MOTC will discuss the proposal with the
Mainland Affairs Council, which charts Taiwan's policy toward the
mainland.

COA HAILS SUBSTANTIAL DECREASE IN STRAY DOGS
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei, Feb. 26 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Council of Agriculture (COA) said
Saturday that the number of stray dogs in Taiwan has declined
substantially in recent years thanks to concerted efforts by the
private and public sectors.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics released by the COA's Animal and Plant
Health Inspection and Quarantine Bureau, Taiwan had 667,000 stray
dogs in 1999, but the number had dropped to 179,000 by 2004.
</P>
<P>
The quarantine bureau said that both the 1999 and 2004 figures
were based on surveys conducted by Fei Chang-yung, a professor at
National Taiwan University's veterinary medicine department, in line
with methods designated by the World Health Organization.
</P>
<P>
"The results of both surveys are objective, fair and impartial,"
a bureau official said.
</P>
<P>
Fei pointed out in his 2004 survey that the significant
decrease in the number of stray dogs can be attributed to a
combination of factors, including a change in local people's
attitude toward keeping pets as well as the government's
encouragement of pet owners to have their pets sterilized and
better management of stray dogs.

up amid a crowd of young Israelis waiting to
enter a nightclub near the Tel Aviv beachfront
Friday night, killing at least four, wounding
dozens and threatening to shatter a truce that
had largely been holding. The bombing was the
first major attack since Israel's prime
minister, Ariel Sharon, and the Palestinian
leader, Mahmoud Abbas, called for an end to
violence at a Feb. 8 summit meeting in Egypt.

Confucius' lesson of the day: "If you speak to a man in the
strict words of the law, he will probably agree with you; but the
important point is that he should so profit by what you say to him as
to change his conduct. If you speak to a man in parables, he will
probably be pleased with your story; but the important point is that
he should apply the moral to himself."

GOVERNMENT INVESTMENT POSTS FIRST POSITIVE GROWTH IN FIVE YEARS
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Feb.  27 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The government's fixed investments will
post a growth rate of 1.1 percent in real terms this year for the
first time in five years, according to a forecast made Sunday by the
Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics (DGBAS)
under the Executive Yuan.
</P>
<P>
The DGBAS said the growth, attributed largely to the "ten new
major construction projects" program launched by the government, is
especially significant when compared to the minus 4.2 percent growth
in the previous year.
</P>
<P>
The growth would be 3.2 percent in nominal terms owing to the
rise in building materials.
</P>
<P>
The state-owned enterprises, which are estimated to register a
growth of 10.9 percent in fixed investments this year, claim a major
part of the credit, mainly because of the Taiwan Power Company's
investment in the Fourth Nuclear Plant in Taipei County, its Sixth
Electricity Distribution System and its Tatan Thermoelectrical Power
Station, in Taoyuan County.
</P>
<P>
Private sector fixed investment is expected to grow by 8.9
percent this year, thanks to the start of construction of the
country's Sixth Naptha Cracker and the Taiwan High Speed Railway.
</P>
<P>
However, the DGBAS holds out a dim prospects for the country's
international trade this year owing to the slowdown in international
economic growth.
</P>
<P>
According to the forecast, the growth in the country's exports
will decrease from 20.7 percent last year to 6.7 percent this year,
while imports will decrease from 31.0 percent last year to 5.7
percent this year.

<P>
President Chen Shui-bian is expected to
make a strong case for Taiwan's bid to join the World Health
Organization (WHO) to members of the European Parliament via a
teleconference March 1, government sources said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The sources said Chen will made an appeal for the European
Parliament's help for Taiwan's bid, and will emphasize the
contributions the island, if admitted to WHO, could have made to the
world health body in combating epidemics such as severe acute
respiratory syndrome.
</P>
<P>
Chen will also try to win the support of European states in
Taiwan's disputes with mainland China.
</P>
<P>
The Presidential Office refused to confirm the teleconference
Sunday, but the country's representative office in Brussels confirmed
the teleconference by disclosing that two European parliamentarians
-- Graham Watson from Britain and George Jarzembowski from Germany --
as well as media correspondents, will talk with the president in the

KMT DELEGATION TO VISIT SUN YAT-SEN'S MAINLAND CHINA MAUSOLEUM
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Feb. 27 (CNA)

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Vice Chairman
P.K. Chiang will lead a party delegation to visit the mausoleum of
Sun Yat-sen in Nanjing, eastern mainland China next month, KMT
Chairman Lien Chan said Sunday during a ceremony held by the party in
memory of Feb. 28 Peace Day.
</P>
<P>
Sun is the founding father of the Republic of China and of the
KMT.
</P>
<P>
Lien said Chiang and his delegation will also visit the tomb in
Kwangzhou, southern China, of 72 martyrs who were killed in a KMT-led
uprising against China's last feudalistic regime, the Ching dynasty,
in 1911.
</P>
<P>
The country set aside the day of their deaths -- March 29 -- as
the nation's Youth Day.
</P>
<P>
Lien said people on both sides of the Taiwan Strait have paid
heavily for the military confrontation between Taiwan and the
mainland in the four decades between 1938 and 1987, although
reconciliation began to take place between the two sides after 1987,
when Taiwan reached out to the mainland, Lien claimed.
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, Lien went on, the "steady tendency toward detente"
was interrupted and replaced with tense military confrontation after
2000 because of Taiwan political leaders' claims of "two states on
each side of the Taiwan Strait, " and their calls for writing a new
constitution, deciding the country's future via referendum, and
changing the country's official name.
</P>
<P>
Claiming that getting rid of hostility and seeking rapport is the
common desire of most people, Lien said the reconciliation called for
by President Chen Shui-bian among political parties in Taiwan is not
enough and that his party wants also to proffer an olive branch to
Beijing, with Chiang's trip to the mainland the first step of the
process.
</P>
<P>
Before Lien announced Chiang's trip, Chen Min-chung, a victim of
the 1947 Feb. 28 incident, made the bizarre claim that the incident
was really apart of the civil war between the KMT and the Chinese
Communist Party rather than a conflict between the Taiwan people and
the KMT authorities at the time.
</P>
<P>
In that incident, Taiwanese residents rose up to protest the
KMT's brutal rule, a move that led to a bloody crackdown by the KMT
government, which killed thousands of Taiwanese.
</P>
<P>
Chen, who led a communist squadron that attacked a fort at Sun
Moon Lake in Nantou during the incident, was later arrested and
sentenced to death, but was spared eventually and released in 1987
because of his poor health.
</P>
<P>
The incident has been characterized by the island's
pro-independence groups as yet more proof of the KMT's brutality and
a justification of their political cause.

DPP WHIP URGES RECONCILIATION AT NEW LEGISLATURE
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei, Feb. 27 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A legislative whip of the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) appealed Sunday for reconciliation with the
start of the new session last Friday, saying that the DPP caucus is
poised to serve as a peace messenger in rapport with the opposition
parties.
</P>
<P>
William C.D. Lai claimed that the DPP caucus is willing to help
pass to the opposition parties the olive branch extended by President
Chen Shui-bian in a meeting last Thursday with People First Party
(PFP) Chairman James Soong.
</P>
<P>
Forging reconciliation and fostering cooperation will be the
caucus' top priority at the sixth Legislative Yuan inaugurated Feb.
1, Lai said.
</P>
<P>
Lai said that the DPP caucus will also step up its communications
with the Executive Yuan and the opposition parties to push for major
bills regarding a special budget of NT$610.8 billion (US$18.23
billion) for a major military procurement plan, national insurance
system reform, the operation of National Assembly and the
restructuring of the Executive Yuan.
</P>
<P>
The DPP caucus will also do its best to seek support from the
opposition parties and their consent to the nomination list of the
Control Yuan members forwarded by the president in the last session,
he added.
</P>
<P>
Stressing that a united Taiwan is extremely important when the
nation is facing enormous competition and pressure from other
countries, he claimed that the DPP needs tremendous courage to make
peace with the opposition.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, legislators Chen Jie and Cho Po-yuan, new caucus whips
of the main opposition Kuomintang (KMT), echoed Lai, with calls for
compromise and a "win-win" situation between the governing and
opposition camps.
</P>
<P>
Chen pledged to continue collaborating with the PFP to provide an
effective system of checks and balances in the government and
promised to negotiate with the PFP while seeking a common stance on
key issues.
</P>
<P>
Cho said that the KMT agrees with the ideas of co-existence and
reconciliation aired by Premier Frank Hsieh, who took over the post
from his predecessor Yu Shyi-kun Feb. 1.
</P>
<P>
Cho said that the KMT will respond rationally and positively in
cooperation with the PFP to policies forwarded by the Cabinet if
Hsieh is reasonable and flexible in communicating with the
Legislative Yuan with regard to bills.
</P>
<P>
He also urged the executive branch to focus its attention on
issues pertaining to the public good and people's livelihoods while
shelving sensitive political and ethnic disputes.
</P>
<P>
PFP legislative leader Li Yong-pin made it clear that the PFP
will not loosen its stance on sensitive issues in its capacity as a
responsible opposition party and will without fault stick to the
10-point joint statement made public during the Chen-Soong meeting.
</P>
<P>
Looking ahead, Li voiced her hope for smooth legislation and
called for a change to the Cabinet's "attitude" toward pushing bills
through the legislature.
</P>
<P>
Dismissing reporters' rumors that the PFP will form an alliance
with the DPP at the Legislative Yuan after the Chen-Soong meeting, Li
described that rhetoric as misleading and reiterated that the PFP
will vigorously scrutinize bills related to public welfare in
conjunction with the ruling party.
</P>
<P>
But she added that the PFP will not alter its position as regards
cooperating with the KMT on most issues, including screening the
nominations for Control Yuan members. She also pointed out that
PFP-initiated drafts devised to bolster peace across the Taiwan
Strait and to set up a national communications commission must clear
the Legislative Yuan after negotiations with other parties.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU), a one-time
ally of the ruling DPP, claimed that the TSU will seek inter-party
cooperation to promote economic and public interest bills.
</P>
<P>
TSU legislative caucus whip Lo Chih-ming said that the party will
even consider to collaborate with the KMT or the Non-Partisan
Solidarity Union in this field.
</P>
<P>
However, Lo said that the pro-independence TSU will walk its own
way regarding Taiwan's future course, insisting that Taiwan's
identity cannot be compromised under any conditions.
</P>
<P>
The TSU accused Chen of betraying the Taiwan people by signing
the 10-point joint declaration with Soong, which focuses on keeping
the Republic of China's status quo intact and boosting ethnic
harmony.
</P>
<P>
In view of the fragile cross-strait situation, President Chen
tried hard to woo the PFP after the Dec. 11, 2004 legislative
elections, in which the DPP failed to form a stable majority with the
TSU in the 225-member Legislative Yuan.
</P>
<P>
The DPP gained 89 seats at the legislature, followed by the KMT
with 79 and the PFP with 34. The TSU captured only 12 seats.

of President Chen Shui-bian and Vice President Annette Lu on the eve
of the March 20 presidential election last year.
</P>
<P>
New Party Chairman Yok Mu-ming and Legislator Joanna C. Lei led
the protest outside the venue of a speech by visiting former U. S.
President Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
Chanting slogans calling for international attention to help dig
out what they described as "the truth" behind the election-eve
shooting, which many opposition "pan-blue alliance" supporters
believe unfairly changed the result of the election, Yok said the
sit-in was only a warm up for a series of similar activities as the
shooting's anniversary approaches.
</P>
<P>
He said the New Party will stage protests every year in the
future as long as the shooting remains unsolved.
</P>
<P>
Lei issued a declaration in Chinese and English claiming that
"there is no president nor democracy if the truth is not discovered."
</P>
<P>
Chen narrowly won the March 20 presidential race after being
attacked by an unknown gunman a day earlier. No-one has been arrested
so far.

New York Times: Mubarak Pushes Egypt to
Allow Freer Elections.

Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak asked Egypt's Parliament on
Saturday to amend the Constitution to allow for direct, multiparty
presidential elections this year for the first time in the nation's
history. Some opposition politicians and analysts hailed the proposal
as heralding a new political era for Egypt, the Arab world's most
populous nation, while skeptics said they wanted to await the details
to be sure that the eventual constitutional amendment would not
create only the appearance of democracy, a common problem in the
region.

GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS URGED TO STEP DOWN ON DECIDING TO RUN ELECTIONS

<TEXT>
<P>
The politically-appointed government
officials should step down if they decide to run elections for public
offices, Premier Frank Hsieh said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
For running the year-end elections of city and county heads, the
government officials should quit not later than March 28 when the
ruling Democratic Progressive Party will start registration of
candidates, Hsieh noted.
</P>
<P>
It is a good arrangement for both the administration team and
individuals because it would not affect the government operation nor
create a unfair electoral environment for other candidates, the
premier stressed.
</P>
<P>
Hsieh told lawmakers Friday during a legislative interpellation
session that he will make an examination of all members of his
Cabinet, including himself, in August in consideration of a possible
reshuffle.
</P>
<P>
The premier said that he will step down if the review finds that
all his colleagues are at odds with him. However, if only a few of
them do not see eye-to-eye with him, these few members will have to
leave, he added.
</P>
<P>
Hsieh assumed the premiership on Feb. 1 with most members of the
previous Cabinet led by Yu Shyi-kun being retained.
</P>
<P>
Hsieh said that he did not make a large-scale Cabinet reshuffle
on assuming to the premiership given that Yu's Cabinet was in a good
operation and that he needs more time to observe all Cabinet members'
performances.
</P>
<P>
He proposed a possible Cabinet reshuffle in August last week
based on a consideration that the new Legislative Yuan will then
finish its first session, the premier explained, adding that it will
be an opportune moment for the Cabinet reshuffle, if necessary.

<P>
Former U.S. President Bill Clinton affirmed
Taiwan's democracy and prosperity in a speech in Taipei Sunday.
</P>
<P>
He also lauded the direct charter flights between Taiwan and
mainland China last month during the Chinese New Year holidays,
saying he was amazed to learn from the British weekly the Economist
that Taiwan businessmen have employed more than 10 million people on
the mainland despite the bitter political disputes between the two
sides.
</P>
<P>
The former U.S. president used this to dress home the message of
his speech about the peace and prosperity in 21th Century that the
increasing interdependence among different countries is driving them
to work together, and the challenge the world faces in this century
is to establish a stable international society wherein the people
share responsibility, benefits and basic values.
</P>
<P>
At the invitation of the government-financed Taiwan Foundation
for Democracy, Clinton flew in from Japan Sunday evening four hours
behind schedule and was whiskered to the Taipei International
Convention Center to deliver a speech to a packed auditorium.
</P>
<P>
He met with President Chen Shui-bian Sunday evening at a dinner
and was scheduled to sign copies of his autobiography "My Life" for

CLINTON SIGNS COPIES OF AUTOBIOGRAPHY FOR TAIWAN READERS
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Feb. 28 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Former U.S. President Bill Clinton, who
arrived in Taipei Sunday evening for a whirlwind 24-hour visit, met
Taiwan readers by signing copies of his autobiography at the Taipei
101 tower Monday to promote his new book.
</P>
<P>
Readers began lining up before 9 a.m. for the book signing
session slated for 11 a.m. Security was tight, inevitably making
entry into the venue time consuming.
</P>
<P>
More than 50,000 copies of the 900-page Chinese version of
Clinton's autobiography "My Life, " published by the Taipei-based
China Times Publication, have been sold so far.
</P>
<P>
Clinton's current book promotion tour to Asia has already taken
him to Hong Kong, Beijing, South Korea and Japan. He is scheduled to
depart Taipei for Singapore later Monday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday evening, the former U.S. president delivered a
30-minute speech at the Taipei International Convention Center,
during which he spoke of the dangers and benefits of living in a more
interdependent world. The appearance was sponsored by the
government-financed Taiwan Foundation for Democracy, a non-profit
organization dedicated to the promotion of democracy and human rights
in Taiwan and abroad.
</P>
<P>
Clinton met with President Chen Shui-bian over dinner later
Sunday, during which Chen presented him with a saxophone as a gift.
Clinton appeared pleasantly surprised by the gift which also had a
quote by the late Martin Luther King engraved on it.
</P>
<P>
Although Clinton is no longer president, he has been accorded
treatment befitting a head of state during his visit in Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Clinton, who has remained an internationally important figure
since his retirement, now acts as a special envoy of the United
Nations appointed by U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan.
</P>
<P>
Before starting his book tour around Asia, Clinton joined former
U.S. President George H.W. Bush on a tour of South and Southeast
Asian countries battered by December's devastating tsunami disaster.
</P>
<P>
Clinton originally planned to come to Taiwan in November 2003 but
was forced to cancel the visit due to a tight schedule. He was also
scheduled to visit Taiwan Sept. 12, 2001, but failed to make it due
to the 911 terrorist attacks.
</P>
<P>
He visited Taiwan four times during his tenure as governor of
Arkansas before being elected U.S. president in November 1991.
</P>
<P>
Officials from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said that Clinton
contributed a great deal to the promotion of substantive Taiwan-U.S.
relations during his presidency, particularly his decision to send
two aircraft carrier battle groups to patrol waters near Taiwan
during the 1996 Taiwan Strait crisis.

<P>
Former U.S. President Bill Clinton praised
President Chen Shui-bian Sunday for his courage in meeting with
opposition People First Party Chairman James Soong, saying the
meeting has promoted reconciliation between the ruling and opposition
parties and made the Taiwan people stronger and more confident.
</P>
<P>
Clinton made the remarks while meeting with Chen at a dinner
party held in his honor after he delivered a speech on global
stability and prosperity in the 21st century at the Taipei
International Convention Center earlier in the evening.
</P>
<P>
According to Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) Chairman Joseph Wu,
who also attended the dinner party, the former U.S. president said
while commending Chen for his meeting with Soong Feb. 24 that a brave
man is willing to communicate with those with whom he has differing
opinions.
</P>
<P>
Clinton also emphasized that the reconciliation demonstrated
through Chen's meeting with his political opponent will make Taiwan's
democracy stronger and more confident.
</P>
<P>
For his part, Chen equated his reconciliation with Soong to
Clinton's reconciliation with former U.S. President George H.W. Bush,
his former political adversary. The two former presidents are now
serving together as U.N. envoys for tsunami reconstruction in South
and Southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
Touching on the various similarities between himself and Clinton
regarding the background of their political careers, Chen said that

ACADEMICS WELCOME CLOSER CROSS-STRAIT FINANCIAL EXCHANGES
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,   Feb.  28  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taiwan should strengthen financial
exchanges with mainland China, a move which would benefit the island
more than the mainland, a finance professor at National Taiwan
University said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on reports that Taiwan will soon allow mainland
Chinese banking institutions to open representative offices in
Taiwan, professor Huang Ta-yeh said that it is a welcome policy even
simply from an economic perspective.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan's financial service sector -- which has lost a lot of loan
services business due to the mass exodus of Taiwan companies to the
mainland -- would enthusiastically welcome an acceleration in
cross-strait financial exchanges and cooperation, Huang noted.
</P>
<P>
Huang also expressed welcome to the recent meeting between
President Chen Shui-bian and opposition People First Party Chairman
James Soong, during which Chen vowed to push for closer business,
cultural and academic exchanges with mainland China. The professor
said President Chen's promises are conducive to improving
cross-strait relations.
</P>
<P>
Noting that an easing of cross-strait tensions will help
facilitate financial exchanges, Huang said Taiwan's financial service
sector should grasp the opportunity of bettering cross-strait
relations to make inroads into the mainland.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, professor Yeh Yin-hua from Fujen Catholic University
said that it is only normal that mainland Chinese financial
institutions be allowed to set up representative offices in Taiwan as
their Taiwan counterparts have already been allowed to do so on the
mainland for years.
</P>
<P>
Yeh noted, however, that Taiwan faces relatively greater risks
than mainland China does in the exchange of banking representative
offices, making it necessary for Taiwan to work out control measures
prior to implementation.
</P>
<P>
According to Kung Chao-sheng, chairman of the Financial
Supervisory Commission under the Executive Yuan, Taiwan will soon
open its door to mainland Chinese banking and financial service
institutions.
</P>
<P>
Accordingly, Kung said, Taiwan must accelerate its moves to
overhaul related laws and regulations to cope with the new situation.
</P>
<P>
Lu Tong-ying, vice chairman of the Financial Supervisory
Commission, said that plans on allowing mainland banks to open
representative offices in Taiwan have already been worked out. If the
government gives the green light, the plans could be put into effect
within a week, he added.

ROC REP TO U.S. URGES BEIJING TO ABANDON 'ANTI-SECESSION LAW'
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Washington, Feb. 27 (CNA)
(By Oliver Lin and Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Republic of China representative to
the United States on Sunday urged mainland China to take the
initiative and give up its plan to enact an "anti-secession law" so
as not to raise cross-strait tensions.
</P>
<P>
David Ta-wei Lee made the remarks during a commemoration ceremony
for the 228 Incident held in Washington, D.C., which was sponsored by
Taiwan civic groups such as the Presbyterian Church and the Taiwanese
Association in the D.C. area and which was attended by around 300
Taiwanese expatriates.
</P>
<P>
The "anti-secession law" will soon be put to review and is
expected to be passed by the National People's Congress, Beijing's
rubber-stamp parliament, when it meets in early March.
</P>
<P>
Lee said that President Chen Shui-bian has repeatedly extended
olive branches to mainland China, urging Beijing to resume talks for
the peaceful coexistence of the two sides of the Taiwan Strait.
</P>
<P>
But Beijing has ignored the aspiration of the 23 million people
on Taiwan and the international community for world peace and is
planning to enact the "anti-secession law, " which could be used as a
legal basis for its policy toward Taiwan, Lee said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that there is no precedent of formulating such a law in
the world, and Beijing's purpose is to unilaterally define the status
quo in the Taiwan Strait, deny the de jure existence of the ROC and
provide a legal basis for the use of force against Taiwan should the
island declare independence.
</P>
<P>
Lee pointed out that the "anti-secession law" is a law to
authorize war and is dictatorial.
</P>
<P>
He urged the international community to address Beijing's attempt
to use force against Taiwan and use its influence to prevent Beijing
from making any moves to sabotage regional peace and stability.
</P>
<P>
He said that the "anti-session law" has no substantive benefits
and will be ill-received by the people of Taiwan. It will destroy the
basis on which both sides can have further exchanges and resume
bilateral talks, he added.

MND MUM ON U.S. MILITARY SUPPLY PROCUREMENT IN TAIWAN
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Feb.  28 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Ministry of National Defense (MND)
refrained from making any comment Monday on media reports that the
U.S. military is considering procuring military supplies from Taiwan
as part of its efforts to reduce costs.
</P>
<P>
According to media reports, a delegation organized by the
Comparative Testing Office (CTO) of the U.S. Department of Defense is
scheduled to arrive in Taipei this weekend to assess Taiwan's
capability of supplying military equipment. The delegation reportedly
will meet with officials of the MND's military supply bureau and
senior executives of local high-tech companies.
</P>
<P>
Responding to media inquiries, MND spokesman Liu Chih-chien said
the MND has customarily not made any comments on reports about
military procurement deals.
</P>
<P>
Other MND officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said
the upcoming visit is part of the U.S. military's regular global
business trip aimed at negotiating terms or placing orders for
procuring military equipment components, spare parts and other
supplies, such as military boots.
</P>
<P>
With a view to cutting costs and diversifying supply sources, the
officials said the Pentagon has usually purchased military supplies
from Asian countries, including Taiwan, Vietnam and the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
According to media reports, the U.S. delegation, to be composed
of five military officers and a civilian official, would meet Taiwan
defense and economic officials and high-tech firms in a five-day
visit.
</P>
<P>
They will bring with them a shopping list of over 300 items,
ranging from aircraft components, ammunition, laptop computers to
satellite telephones and infrared equipment. The delegation is
expected to submit a report to the Pentagon in June on the outcome of
their evaluation, the report said.

CLINTON SAYS HOLIDAY DIRECT CROSS-STRAIT FLIGHTS GOOD FOR RELATIONS
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei, Feb. 28 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Visiting U.S. former President Bill Clinton
on Monday praised the landmark two-way, non-stop cross-strait charter
passenger flights during the just-concluded Chinese Lunar New Year
holiday.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said that the cross-strait charter flights were a
positive move that is conducive to enhancing symbiosis and
co-prosperity of global economies, according to Stephen Chen,
formerly top Taiwan representative in the United States who
accompanied opposition Kuomintang Chairman Lien Chan during a brief
meeting with Clinton Monday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Stressing that the world is becoming increasingly interdependent
and people around the world must join hands for co-existence and
co-prosperity, Clinton was quoted by Chen as saying that closer
exchanges across the Taiwan Strait would help enhance mutual
understanding and consolidate cooperation between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
Clinton met with Lien for a closed-door talk that lasted about 40
minutes, according to Chen. During the talk, Clinton reiterated the
importance of cross-strait issues being resolved peacefully and the
significance of the launch of the direct cross-strait charter
flights.
</P>
<P>
During the talk, Clinton offered Lien a copy of his
autobiography, titled "My Life, " as a gift, while Lien gave the
former president a blue-white china vase, Chen said.
</P>
<P>
According to Chen, it was Clinton who invited Lien to meet.
Clinton, who has become well acquainted with Lien since 1988 when he
visited Taiwan in his capacity as the governor of the state of
Arkansas while Lien was the foreign minister, addressed Lien as an
old friend.
</P>
<P>
Soon after the meeting with Lien, Clinton headed to Taipei's
Sungshan airport, wrapping up his whirlwind 24-hour visit in Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Clinton met with President Chen Shui-bian once again Monday
morning for a closed-door meeting that lasted for about an hour
following their first meeting Sunday evening over a dinner that
President Chen hosted in honor of Clinton.
</P>
<P>
Clinton met Taiwan readers and signed copies of his autobiography
at the Taipei 101 tower around noon Monday.
</P>
<P>
More than 500 people began lining up before 9 a.m. for the book
signing session slated for 11 a.m. Security was tight, inevitably
making entry into the venue time consuming.
</P>
<P>
More than 50,000 copies of the 900-page Chinese version of
Clinton's autobiography, published by the Taipei-based China Times
Publications, have been sold so far.
</P>
<P>
Clinton's current book promotion tour to Asia has already taken
him to Hong Kong, Beijing, South Korea and Japan. He departed Taipei
around 5 p.m. Monday for Singapore.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday evening, Clinton delivered a 30-minute speech at the
Taipei International Convention Center, during which he spoke of the
dangers and benefits of living in a more interdependent world. The
appearance was sponsored by the government-financed Taiwan Foundation
for Democracy, a non-profit organization dedicated to the promotion
of democracy and human rights in Taiwan and abroad.
</P>
<P>
Although Clinton is no longer president, he was accorded
treatment befitting a head of state during his visit in Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Clinton, who has remained an internationally important figure
since his retirement, now acts as a special envoy of the United
Nations appointed by U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan.
</P>
<P>
Before starting his book tour around Asia, Clinton joined former
U.S. President George H.W. Bush on a tour of South and Southeast
Asian countries battered by December's devastating tsunamis.
</P>
<P>
He visited Taiwan four times during his tenure as governor of
Arkansas before being elected U.S. president in 1991.
</P>
<P>
Officials from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said that Clinton
contributed a great deal to the promotion of substantive Taiwan-U.S.
relations during his presidency, particularly his decision to send
two aircraft carrier battle groups to patrol waters near Taiwan
during the 1996 Taiwan Strait crisis.

TSU LAUNCHES PETITION DRIVE AGAINST BEIJING'S 'ANTI-SECESSION LAW'
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Feb.  28 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The pro-independence Taiwan Solidarity
Union (TSU) launched an islandwide 10,000-person petition drive
Monday to highlight its call for the people of Taiwan to oppose
mainland China's proposed "anti-secession law."
</P>
<P>
The one-day signature drive on 228 Peace Memorial Day was held in
about 30 places around Taiwan and was called "oppose annexation,
protect Taiwan."
</P>
<P>
TSU Chairman Su Chin-chiang led party officials and legislators
to Lungshan Temple, one of the designated places in Taipei to solicit
signatures, and used a bullhorn to call for the public to join the
drive.
</P>
<P>
TSU officials said that Beijing is attempting to use the
"anti-secession law" to lay a legal basis to employ force against
Taiwan should the island declare independence.
</P>
<P>
For this reason, it is urgent to define clearly the status of
Taiwan and mainland China and laws governing the rights and
obligations of those participating in bilateral exchanges, they said.
</P>
<P>
The TSU will propose an "anti-annexation law" to counter
Beijing's "anti-secession law," they added.
</P>
<P>
The "anti-secession law" will soon be put to review and is
expected to be passed by the National People's Congress, Beijing's
rubber-stamp parliament, when it meets in early March.
</P>
<P>
Su said that Taiwan faces the threat of annexation from mainland
China, and the only way to counter this is for Taiwan to stand up
against the proposed law.
</P>
<P>
He also said that two million people took part in the
hand-in-hand campaign for peace on Feb. 28 last year, and the theme
of this year's activity was still peace, but he wondered why some
political figures who took part in last year's movement didn't come
out this year.
</P>
<P>
The TSU's Youth Department officials also performed skits to
ridicule some political figures in Taiwan as seriously tilting toward
mainland China and not standing on the same side as the people.
</P>
<P>
TSU Legislator Huang Shih-chou said that the TSU wants to make
the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) aware that the TSU will
rigorously monitor the administration and actively promote a new
constitution and the rectification of the nation's name.
</P>
<P>
TSU Secretary-General Chen Chien-ming also said that the TSU will
prove with action that it will by no means accept mainland China's
attempt to annex Taiwan.

Financial Times: Labour election tension rises.

Tony Blair and Gordon Brown were yesterday scrambling to inject

who as Labour's campaign co-ordinator is doing the job Mr Brown
performed in the party's two landslide victories, joined forces with
friends of the chancellor in a concerted attempt to dismiss reports
of a furious row over the timing of Friday's announcement of a rise

FILES CONCERNING 228 INCIDENT MUST BE OPENED: PRESIDENT
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Feb. 28 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President Chen Shui-bian said Monday that
the archives related to the 228 Incident must be made public to help
learn the complete truth about the tragic event.
</P>
<P>
Chen also said a national human rights commission should be
provided for under the Constitution in the constitutional
re-engineering project to avoid such tragedy from taking place again.
</P>
<P>
The president made the remarks when he attended the 58th
anniversary of the incident at the 228 Peace Park in downtown Taipei.
</P>
<P>
Chen noted that the incident -- civil disorder and a brutal
crackdown by the government that began Feb. 28, 1947, triggered by a
dispute between an unlicensed cigarette vendor and an anti-smuggling
officer the day before, and the ensuing period known as the "White
Terror" was a "massive and systematic encroachment on human rights by
the nation in an authoritarian period."
</P>
<P>
"Despite the fact that the victims and those involved came from
every ethnic group, " Chen said, it nevertheless sowed the seeds of
mistrust and hatred between the various ethnic groups.
</P>
<P>
Under the long period of Kuomintang martial law, no one dared to
address the issue, Chen noted, and there was no investigation of the
truth, no resolution of misunderstandings and hatred and no help for
the various groups to understand or even reconcile amongst
themselves.
</P>
<P>
For half a century, everyone in Taiwan has been affected by the
tragedy so that they cannot open up their arms and hearts to embrace
their different historical memories and cannot share common
experiences and traumas.
</P>
<P>
To ensure there is no repeat of a similar tragedy in the future,
Chen said that the two major goals at present are to open the
government's secret files related to the 228 Incident so as to
expedite the finding of the truth.
</P>
<P>
As this was a human rights incident, he said, in the
constitutional re-engineering project a national human rights
commission should be provided for and that the protection on human
rights should also be expanded in the Constitution in line with the
highest standards of international human rights.
</P>
<P>
The president reaffirmed that reconciliation must be based on
truth and said the government will work toward finding the complete
truth of the tragic event as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
The president also led Vice President Annette Lu, Premier Frank
Hsieh, Examination Yuan President Yao Chia-wen, Taipei Mayor Ma
Ying-jeou, 228 Incident Memorial Foundation Chairman Chen Chin-huang,
and family members of some of the victims in laying wreaths and
paying their respects before the 228 memorial.

PRESIDENT CALLS FOR WORLD ATTENTION TO BEIJING'S ANTI-SECESSION LAW
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,   Feb.  28  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President Chen Shui-bian urged the
international community Monday to show concern over mainland China's
proposed anti-secession legislation that would provide a legal basis
for Beijing to attack Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Chen made the appeal while attending a ceremony to mark the 58th
anniversary of the 228 Incident, which refers to the events that led
to a brutal crackdown by Kuomintang (KMT) government troops against
the local population, particularly the intelligentsia, Feb. 28, 1947.
</P>
<P>
"The people of Taiwan have deep conviction and commitment to
peace and human rights. We are willing to protect the peaceful and
stable Taiwan Strait status quo in a sincere and responsible manner,"
Chen said.
</P>
<P>
While the smooth conclusion of the recent Chinese New Year
cross-strait charter flights provided a glimmer of hope for permanent
cross-strait peace and opened up a window of opportunity for
constructive cross-strait interaction and dialogue, Chen said the
people of Taiwan still live in the shadow of the threat of the
700-plus ballistic missiles deployed by mainland China against the
island. Worse still, Chen said, the mainland's so-called
anti-secession law, expected to be enacted in March, has dropped a
time bomb into cross-strait relations and Asia-Pacific regional
peace, security and stability.
</P>
<P>
Noting that major countries around the world, including the
United States, Japan and the European Union, have traditionally been
concerned about the cross-strait situation and support Taiwan's
pursuit of democracy, Chen said he keenly hopes the international
community will pay equal heed to the mainland's planned
anti-secession legislation.
</P>
<P>
As part of the 228 Incident commemoration at the 228 Peace Park
in downtown Taipei, Chen tolled a bell to symbolize peace and called
for an end to Taiwan's ethnic divisions.
</P>
<P>
"This is a painful day for the Taiwan people, " Chen said after
ringing the large bronze bell near a monument dedicated to the
victims of the massacre. "Our people and future leaders should learn
from the incident and remember that real peace is based on full
communication, understanding, respect and reconciliation," he said.
Throughout Taiwan, people gathered at memorial parks to mourn those
killed in the 228 Incident and vigils were planned in several cities
for later that day.
</P>
<P>
The bloody crackdown took place in a turbulent period of Taiwan's
history. In 1945, the mainland China-based Kuomintang (KMT)
government reclaimed Taiwan, which had been a Japanese colony. But
the KMT's rule was brutal and corrupt, leading to a massive protest
Feb. 28, 1947, by the native Taiwanese. More troops were sent from
the mainland to crush the demonstrations and in the following months,
soldiers arrested and killed thousands of people they claimed were
communists or saboteurs trying to overthrow the government.

CLINTON'S VISIT RAISES TAIWAN'S PROFILE: MOFA

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Former U.S. President Bill Clinton is a
friend of Taiwan and his visit to Taiwan will raise Taiwan's profile
internationally, a spokesman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs
(MOFA) claimed Monday.
</P>
<P>
Michel Lu made the remarks after Clinton wrapped up a whirlwind
visit to Taiwan Monday afternoon and left for Singapore to continue
his Asian tour promoting his autobiography, titled "My Life."
</P>
<P>
During his less-than 24-hour stay in Taiwan, Clinton met with
President Chen Shui-bian twice, attended an autograph session for his
book and delivered a speech at the Taipei International Convention
Center.
</P>
<P>
Lu said that the ministry invited Clinton to visit Taiwan mainly
to express appreciation for his support of Taiwan's democracy and his
assistance in Taiwan's efforts to play a positive force of peace and
stability in the Asian region during his term.
</P>
<P>
Clinton is very concerned about the development of Taiwan and
cross-Taiwan Strait issues, Lu said, adding that remarks he made
during his stay were for the good of Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
He also noted that Clinton is an internationally renowned figure
and claimed that his visit will not only raise the profile of Taiwan
internationally but will also enhance exchanges between Taiwan and
the international community and let the world learn about Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
He reaffirmed that the MOFA will continue to promote the policy
of inviting former U.S. presidents, political figures of countries
friendly to Taiwan and the heads of state of the nation's allies to
visit.
</P>
<P>
Clinton, who has remained active in politics after stepping down
in 2001 as a two-term U.S. president, now acts as a special envoy of
the United Nations appointed by U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan.
</P>

Before starting his book tour around Asia, Clinton joined former
U.S. President George H.W. Bush on a tour of South and Southeast

Taiwanese all over the world observed the
country's Feb. 28 Peace Memorial Day with a variety of activities
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
In Washington, D.C., a ceremony jointly sponsored by the Taiwan
Presbyterian Church and the Taiwanese Association in Washington,
D.C., was held at the Twin Oak Garden, drawing a bout 300 Taiwanese
attendees.
</P>
<P>
The ceremony began with a prayer led by pastors Hsu Min-chao and
Chen Min-hsien from the Taiwan Presbyterian Church.
</P>
<P>
Chen said that the ceremony was aimed at soothing the grief of
the victims of the tragic incident and their families, encouraging
them to accept that those mainland Chinese who moved to the island
after the 1947 incident are innocent and should not be blamed for the
incident.
</P>
<P>
Huang Mei-yueh, the president of the Taiwanese Association in
Washington, D.C., echoed Chen's opinion and called for unity among
the Taiwanese to defeat the mainland's attempts to annex the island.
</P>
<P>
David Tawei Lee, Taiwan's representative to the United States,
also spoke and urged Taiwanese to draw a lesson from the 228 incident
to learn to accept ethnic variety with tolerance.
</P>
<P>
He also took the opportunity to lambaste Beijing's attempt to
define its disputes with Taiwan as an internal affair by enacting a
so-called anti-secession law.
</P>
<P>
In Los Angeles, about 300 Taiwanese gathered at the Taiwan Center
to observe the 228 Peace Memorial Day.
</P>
<P>
Braving chilly wind, they gathered in front of the center to sing
Taiwan folk songs then lit white and green candles and observed
silence in memory of the dead.
</P>
<P>
A slogan written on a big billboard on the front of the center
read: "Chinese Missiles not only target Taiwan but all of East Asia."
</P>
<P>
In Dallas, Texas, the observation was organized jointly by the
Formosan Association for Public Affairs (FAPA) and the local
Taiwanese Association.
</P>
<P>
Lin Chien-lung, a professor of Soochow University in Taipei,
known as a loafer before he determined to mend his ways and worked
his way through university, gave an account of his wild teenage days
during the ceremony.
</P>
<P>
Lin said he was invited by FAPA on a lecture tour in the United
States to raise funds and that Dallas was the last leg of his
U.S. trip.
</P>
<P>
In Ottawa, Canada, more than 200 Taiwanese gathered at the city
library to observe the 228 Peace Memorial Day.
</P>
<P>
The ceremony began with a prayer for the victims of the incident
followed by a speech by Yen Kung-chang, president of the Taiwanese
Association in Ottawa.
</P>
<P>
Yen urged the Taiwanese to "follow the 228 victims' examples" by
fighting for democracy and human rights in Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan's representative to Canada, Thomas Chen, also gave a
speech in which he called on all Taiwanese to value the island's
hard-earned democracy.
</P>
<P>
The participants issued a statement at the end of the ceremony,
decrying the mainland's attempts to take over Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
In London, Taiwanese marked the day by gathering in the freezing
square in front of Parliament to protest the mainland's
anti-secession law.
</P>
<P>
They unfurled a banner reading "Taiwan is not a part of China"
and waved posters calling on Beijing to withdraw its missiles
deployed across the Taiwan Strait from Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
In Tokyo, Taiwanese and pro-Taiwan Japanese marked the day by
taking to the streets on Monday to protest against the anti-secession
law, which is intended to prevent Taiwan from seeking independence.
</P>
<P>
During the demonstration, the protesters read a letter from
former President Lee Teng-hui, who prodded Taiwanese to remember the
228 Incident, which he claimed "woke them up to the cruelty of the
Chinese regime."
</P>
<P>
Lee also appealed to Japan to help ward off Beijing's attempts to
take over Taiwan, which will threaten the stability and peace in the
region.

TAIWAN PEOPLE WANT RULING, OPPOSITION CAMPS TO COMPROMISE: CLINTON
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei, Feb. 28 (CNA)
(By Huang Kwang-chun)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The results of last year's presidential and
legislative elections show that the people of Taiwan want the ruling
and opposition camps to compromise, former U.S. President Bill
Clinton said Monday.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with ET Television, Clinton noted that the people
of Taiwan re-elected President Chen Shui-bian in the March 20
presidential election and then gave the opposition Kuomintang (KMT) a
narrow majority in the parliamentary body in the Dec. 11 legislative
elections.
</P>
<P>
"I think what they're saying is: We put you in the same boat
together. We want you to row. We want you to work together. We want
you to move us forward together. And if both of you have to
compromise, that's good, that's what we intended," Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said he met Chen and KMT Chairman Lien Chan during his
stay in Taiwan and found them both to be "highly intelligent,
completely patriotic, devoted to the interests of the people of
Taiwan and not so far apart on some issues."
</P>
<P>
What happened in Taiwan, Clinton said, was basically what
happened to him when the American people elected him and then put the
Republicans in charge of Congress and then re-elected him.
</P>
<P>
Many elections are close, which he said is the result of the
uncertainties of the modern world and people wanting political
leaders to find the consensus that will move them forward rather than
leaving them where they are.
</P>
<P>
Politicians should be as clear as they can about their
differences but should not attack their opponents personally, Clinton
said.
</P>
<P>
He quoted Benjamin Franklin, saying: "Our political enemies are
our friends for they show us our faults."
</P>
<P>
Chen defeated Lien in last year's presidential election by a slim
margin of less than 30,000 votes out of more than 13 million ballots
cast.
</P>
<P>
However, the opposition "Pan Blue Alliance" formed by the KMT and
its political allies, the People First Party and the New Party, won
114 seats in the 225-member Legislative Yuan in December's
legislative elections, outnumbering the 101 seats obtained by the
"Pan Green Alliance" formed by the ruling Democratic Progressive
Party and the Taiwan Solidarity Union.

SON OF 228 INCIDENT VICTIM DONATES PRECIOUS SOUVENIR
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Feb. 28 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)

<TEXT>
<P>
The son of a 228 Incident victim presented
a gift from the Republic of China's founding father Dr. Sun Yat-sen
-- a bottle of scotch whisky -- to Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou Monday.
</P>
<P>
Liao Teh-hsiung, president of the Taipei 228 Incident Victims
Association, presented the precious gift to Ma during a tea party
hosted by the Taipei city government as part of the commemoration of
the 58th anniversary of the tragic 1947 incident.
</P>
<P>
Liao recalled that Sun gave the whisky to his father Liao
Chin-ping during a visit to Taiwan in the latter years of the Ching
Dynasty. Sun was making a transit stop in Taiwan on his way to Japan
after his "second revolution" to overthrow the corrupt Manchu
government failed.
</P>
<P>
"Dr. Sun gave the whisky to my father in appreciation of his
presentation of 60,000 yen in cash to support Dr. Sun's cause, " Liao
said.
</P>
<P>
According to Liao, the money was raised from wealthy families in
central Taiwan. At that time, Liao said, 1,000 yen could buy a house
in Taipei. Taiwan was then under Japanese colonial rule.
</P>
<P>
Liao's father was killed in the 228 Incident, which refers to a
series of events in 1947 that led to a brutal crackdown by the
Kuomintang (KMT) government against the local population,
particularly the intelligentsia.
</P>
<P>
Ma said the precious bottle of whisky will be displayed in a new
Taiwan cultural movement memorial hall to be built in the near
future.
</P>
<P>
During the tea party, Liao also presented Ma with a Wenshu-strain
orchid from Japan that symbolizes peace. On Aug. 6, 1945, all plants
around Hiroshima in southern Japan withered when the atom bomb was
dropped, but a few Wenshu orchids only two kilometers from ground
zero survived. The orchids were later planted in the Hiroshima Peace
Park. This special orchid strain has since become a symbol of peace.
</P>
<P>
Liao told Ma that this is the first time that Wenshu orchids have
been sent to Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Ma said historic wounds can be forgiven but can never be
forgotten.
</P>
<P>
"Tragedies like the 228 Incident should never happen again. The
228 Incident Memorial Hall has recently completed biographies of 168
of the victims. We hope the publication of these biographies can help
local people understand the truth about the incident," Ma said.
</P>
<P>
The bloody crackdown took place in a turbulent period of Taiwan's
history. In 1945, the mainland China-based Kuomintang (KMT)
government reclaimed Taiwan, which had been a Japanese colony. But
the KMT's rule was brutal and corrupt, leading to a massive protest
Feb. 28, 1947, by the native Taiwanese. More troops were sent from
the mainland to crush the demonstrations and in the following months,
soldiers arrested and killed thousands of people they claimed were
communists or saboteurs trying to overthrow the government.
</P>
<P>
President Chen Shui-bian said at a ceremony in memory of the 228
Incident victims earlier in the day that this is a painful day for
the Taiwan people.
</P>
<P>
"Our people and future leaders should learn from the incident and
remember that real peace is based on full communication,
understanding, respect and reconciliation," he said.
</P>
<P>
Throughout Taiwan, people gathered at memorial parks to mourn
those killed in the incident and vigils were also held in several
cities later in the evening.

'LIGHTING UP TAIWAN' ACTIVITY HELD AT 228 MEMORIAL PARK
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Feb. 28 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Former President Lee Teng-hui helped start
a "lighting up Taiwan" activity at the 228 Memorial Park in downtown
Taipei Monday evening.
</P>
<P>
Braving a cold rain, large crowds gathered at the square of the
228 Monument, erected to commemorate the brutal crackdown by the
Kuomintang government that began Feb. 28, 1947, to take part in a
"Taiwan's light will shine over the world" activity sponsored by
the pro-independence civic group Hand-in-hand to Protect Taiwan
Alliance.
</P>
<P>
Although relations between the pro-Taiwan independence supporters
and the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) became frosty after
President Chen Shui-bian's meeting with opposition People First Party
Chairman James Soong Thursday -- in which the president reaffirmed
his promises of no declaration of Taiwan independence and no change
of the nation's official name -- Chen, Vice President Annette Lu and
Premier Frank Hsieh all attended the activity.
</P>
<P>
Other attendees included Executive Yuan Secretary-General Lee
Ying-yuan, DPP Chairman Su Tseng-chang and Labor Affairs Council
Chairwoman Chen Chu, as well as pro-independence Examination Yuan
President Yao Chia-wen, Senior Adviser to the President Koo Kuan-min,
and World United Formosans for Independence Chairman Ng Chiau-tong.
</P>
<P>
While addressing the crowd, Lee vehemently attacked a proposed
"anti-secession law" in mainland China as a "barbaric and invasive"
act.
</P>
<P>
The law, which is aimed at laying a legal basis for using force
against Taiwan should it declare independence, will soon be put to
review and is expected to be approved by the National People's
Congress -- Beijing's rubber-stamp parliament -- when it meets in
early March.
</P>
<P>
Lee said that if the law is enacted, it will have a major impact
on Taiwan's existence and development. He said that not only the
United States and Japan are opposed to its enactment, other
peace-loving countries are also strongly condemning the proposed
legislation and that the Taiwan people should protest strongly.
</P>
<P>
The Taiwan people must not remain silent, as this would send the
wrong message to the international community and China's government
that they can accept the law, he said.
</P>
<P>
He reaffirmed that Taiwan is not part of China and that as
such, there has never been a question of it splitting from China.
</P>
<P>
After the speech, the former president and other guests lit the
light of Fukuei Cape Lighthouse, located at the northern tip of
Taiwan, by remote control.
</P>
<P>
At around 8 p.m., 19 designated places in Taiwan as well as 16
locations in other cities in the world held simultaneous lighting up
activities for 30 minutes to symbolize a prayer for Taiwan and the
passing of Taiwan's light to the world.

DPP QUESTIONS KMT'S WISDOM IN NEGOTIATING WITH BEIJING
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Feb.  28 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The legislative caucus of the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) questioned Monday the wisdom of an
opposition Kuomintang (KMT) decision to send a delegation to mainland
China to negotiate cross-Taiwan Strait air links.
</P>
<P>
The KMT legislative caucus is scheduled to organize the
delegation to visit Beijing to discuss the opening of regular charter
flights across the Taiwan Strait.
</P>
<P>
"I don't think it's a wise decision for the KMT to negotiate
terms for opening regular cross-strait charter flights with the
mainland at the moment," DPP legislative whip Lai Ching-teh said.
</P>
<P>
Cross-strait negotiations should not take place until local
people have forged a consensus on relevant issues, he said.
</P>
<P>
As an opposition party, Lai said, the KMT has neither the mandate
nor the authority to negotiate with the Beijing authorities on the
issue.
</P>
<P>
Lai also criticized former U.S. President Bill Clinton's remarks
that any solution to the cross-strait dispute requires the consent of
the people on both sides of the Taiwan Strait.
</P>
<P>
"Taiwan is an independent sovereign country. Its destiny should
be determined by its 23 million people, not anybody else. Clinton's
statement indicates his ignorance of Taiwan's sovereign status, " Lai
claimed.
</P>
<P>
Noting that Clinton's current Asian tour is mainly aimed at
promoting his autobiography "My Life, " Lai said he was not surprised
by what he described as Clinton's "pro-Beijing rhetoric." If Clinton
were to make a pro-Taiwan statement, Lai added, Beijing might ban the
sale of his book on the mainland.
</P>
<P>
Since Clinton has retired, Lai continued, his remarks in any case
do not represent U.S. policy.
</P>
<P>
Clinton arrived in Taipei Sunday evening for a barely 24-hour
whirlwind visit. During his stay, he delivered a speech on Asian
democratic development. He also held two rounds of closed-door talks
with President Chen Shui-bian on cross-strait ties and other matters
of mutual concern. He signed copies of his autobiography for local
fans before departing for Singapore Monday afternoon.

CROSS-STRAIT EXCHANGES SHOULD BE INCREASED: TAIPEI MAYOR
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Feb.  28 (CNA)
(By Huang Kwang-chun)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Cross-Taiwan Strait exchanges should be
increased, Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan should further promote cross-strait exchanges to improve
mutual understanding between the two sides and avoid possible
misunderstanding by Beijing on the Taiwan independence issue, Ma
said.
</P>
<P>
The mayor, who concurrently serves as a vice chairman of the
opposition Kuomintang, said he has found there exist many
misunderstandings between the two sides of the strait after observing
the recent development of cross-strait ties, particularly on the
Taiwan independence issue.
</P>
<P>
Beijing may not be aware of the operation of a democratic regime
in which political differences should be tolerated, Ma pointed out,
adding that tolerance of Taiwan independence rhetoric should not be
translated into support for the independence movement.
</P>
<P>
Noting that cross-strait relations are a major factor that
affects the sound development of Taiwan's politics and economics, Ma
said stability in the Taiwan Strait can be secured only when a
reconciliation between the two sides of the strait is achieved.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on former U.S. President Bill Clinton's remarks that a
peaceful resolution to the cross-strait issues should be subject to
the consent of the people on both sides of the Taiwan Strait, Ma said
that Clinton should learn more about Taiwan's situation.

MARK 228 BY GUARDING AGAINST ALIEN REGIME'S INVASION: DPP CHIEF
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Feb.  28 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
To mark the Feb. 28 Peace Memorial Day,
Taiwanese should unite together to guard against an alien regime
moving in, ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) Chairman Su
Tseng-chang said Monday.
</P>
<P>
In a ceremony at the Sun Yat-sen Hall in downtown Taipei, Su said
mistakes can be forgiven but history cannot be forgotten. The 228
Incident, he said, was a bloody Taiwanese uprising against the rule
of a corrupt alien regime.
</P>
<P>
In order to avoid a repeat of the incident, Su said, Taiwanese
should unite against mainland China's military threat.
</P>
<P>
The DPP chief said his party decided to mark the day at the Sun
Yat-sen Hall because it was once the office of the Japanese governor
when the island was ruled by Japan prior to 1945, and then become the
office of the National Assembly when the Chinese Nationalist
government, or Kuomintang, fled to Taiwan in 1949.
</P>
<P>
Fifty-eight years after the 1947 incident, Su said, Taiwanese
have eventually become their own masters and the DPP marked the day
at the building that once symbolized the authority of alien rulers to
prove that they are finally their own rulers.
</P>
<P>
He rebutted a statement attributed to opposition People First
Party Chairman James Soong that Beijing proposed a so-called
anti-secession law after being angered by the radical
pro-independence activists in Taiwan, arguing that the mainland is
not proposing the anti-secession law -- which would provide a legal
basis for an invasion of Taiwan -- because of Taiwan's provocation.
</P>
<P>
Premier Frank Hsieh also gave a speech to similar effect at the
ceremony, saying the country set aside Feb. 28 as Peace Memorial Day
with the purpose of helping the various ethnic groups in Taiwan to
get along in harmony.
</P>
<P>
"We should mark the day by raising the consciousness of Taiwan
and stressing Taiwan's political identity independent from that of
other countries," the premier said.
</P>
<P>
Claiming that the mainland is united when dealing with
foreigners, Hsieh said Taiwan is a free but splitting society and
that "the island would be secured forever if only 70 percent or 80
percent of its people could work together."
</P>
<P>
Vice President Annette Lu said at the ceremony that as the ruling
party, the DPP should view the 228 Incident in perspective. Although
the incident has done permanent injury to the country, Taiwanese
should not attempt to take revenge on those who imposed the suffering
on them," she said.
