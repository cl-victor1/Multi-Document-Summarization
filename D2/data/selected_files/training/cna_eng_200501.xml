departing from the path of duty, I would not leave them."

PRESIDENT PROMISES POLITICAL RECONCILIATION IN NEW YEAR ADDRESS
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Jan. 1 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President Chen Shui-bian promised to create
a new and stable environment for consultation and dialogue in his New
Year address Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Noting that Taiwan's political landscape has not changed much
during the last two national elections, with Chen winning the
presidency while the legislature is still under the control of the
opposition, the president said the people have sent a clear message:
the governing party must rule with humility while the opposition
parties must be rational in providing oversight.
</P>
<P>
Chen said Taiwan's society does not need bifurcation between the
blue and green camps, nor does it need ongoing confrontation between
the governing and opposition parties.
</P>
<P>
What the people expect from the political parties is fair
competition, cooperation rather than confrontation, checks and
balances, and solidarity rather than infighting, Chen said.
</P>
<P>
Although most of the people would like to see the governing and
opposition parties take an initial step toward reconciliation and
cooperation, these consultations should be conducted openly, should
be subject to scrutiny by the people, and should not be downgraded
into mere horse trading, Chen went on.
</P>
<P>
He promised to invite leaders from the governing and opposition
parties, as well as representative of the executive and legislative
branches, to meet as soon as possible to negotiate 10 priority bills
and nine major laws desired by the people.
</P>
<P>
He said his governing party will reconcile and cooperate with the
opposition parties on anything that would benefit the stability of
domestic politics, the welfare of the people, harmony among ethnic
groups and cross-strait peace.
</P>
<P>
Chen condemned Beijing's attempts to enact an anti-secession law,
calling it an effort to seek justification for a military invasion of
Taiwan, and therefore constituting a unilateral change of the status
quo in the Taiwan Strait and posing the greatest threat to regional
stability and world peace.
</P>
<P>
He warned the Chinese Communist Party not to underestimate the
will of the Taiwan people to defend the sovereignty, security and
dignity of the Republic of China.
</P>
<P>
Following is the full text of Chen's address:
</P>
<P>
President Chen's New Year's Day Address 'Creating a New and
Stable Environment for Consultation and Dialogue'
</P>
<P>
Distinguished Guests, Colleagues, and My Fellow Countrymen: Happy
New Year and greetings to you all!
</P>
<P>
Today marks the ninety-fourth anniversary of the founding of the
Republic of China and the beginning of a new year. At a little past
six o'clock this chilly morning, many people from around Taiwan
joined me in welcoming the New Year and a new dawn at the
flag-raising ceremony in front of the Presidential Office.
</P>
<P>
As our national flag rose slowly in the early morning light,
perhaps many of those present shared a sentiment that was occupying
my mind: Whether or not we were at the flag-raising ceremony, and
regardless of where on this land we might be, the 23 million people
of Taiwan share a common destiny, the same joy and sorrows. Under the
same sky, we strive along side one another, weaving dreams for
ourselves and for future generations. The collective aspirations of
the people represent the hope and future of our country.
</P>
<P>
In 2004, we worked diligently and saw our efforts bear fruit. For
this, my fellow countrymen must all feel rejoiced and gratified. At
the Athens Olympic Games, we witnessed our national representatives
win gold medals, and in this, there were tears of joy as well as the
sweat of hard work. So inspiring were the scenes that they will
forever remain imprinted in our memories. The people of Formosa share
the same heritage and uphold a common " Taiwan Spirit." We should
always cheer ourselves on and continue to forge ahead; support one
other and never give up in the face of challenges, however formidable
they may be.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to the ongoing global economic recovery, together with the
joint efforts of the government and people, Taiwan's economy is
expected to grow by 5.93 percent in 2004, the highest rate in seven
years. There is hope that the unemployment rate, too, for the year
overall will remain below 4.5 percent--the lowest since 2001. Per
capita income in Taiwan was 13,995USD last year. If the economic
growth rate in 2005 hits 4.56 percent as predicted, then per capita
income this year could reach nearly 15,000USD. If we work a little
harder, we might soon break through the 15,000USD threshold and set a
new record for national average income.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the clear improvement in macroeconomic indices,
Taiwan's national competitiveness on the whole continues to rise. In
the World Competitiveness Scoreboard compiled by the Swiss-based
Institute for Management Development (IMD) , Taiwan ranked 12th in
2004, up five places from number seventeen the previous year. This
performance put Taiwan among the world's top ten in the category of
"most improved national competitiveness." In the World Economic
Forum's (WEF) Growth Competitiveness Index (GCI)--a key indicator for
predicting economic growth potential in the medium to long- term
future--Taiwan moved up from number ten in 2000 to fourth place last
year. We have also ranked number one in Asia for three consecutive
years.
</P>
<P>
These encouraging achievements are the rewards of every citizen's
efforts; even more, they demonstrate the concrete results of the
government's pursuit of economic revitalization and comprehensive
reform over the past few years. We have already weathered the worst
of storm. Now we should have even greater confidence in the future of
Taiwan; and we must have even stronger faith in reform. As we face
the New Year before us, we cannot deny that the trend towards slower
global economic growth presents Taiwan with competitions and
challenges that will remain rigorous. Only through greater
initiative, unity and action will we be able to maintain our
advantage and avoid falling by the wayside.
</P>
<P>
In the area of democratic consolidation and reform, we carried
out the first national referendum in Taiwan's history last year. We
also succeeded with four major constitutional reforms: halving the
number of seats in the Legislature, adopting a "single-district,
two-vote" electoral system, enshrining the right to referendum in the
Constitution, and abolishing the National Assembly. Each of these
major achievements represents a pivotal step in the history of
Taiwan's democratic development. We want to thank the governing and
opposition parties for their efforts; more importantly, we must also
attribute these accomplishments in reform to the power of the people.
</P>
<P>
We can look back on Taiwan's democratization, from the lifting of
the martial law and the end of the bans on new political parties and
newspapers, to the complete re-election of our national legislature,
the direct election of the president, and the holding of national
referenda. We can even look forward to the forthcoming constitutional
reengineering project. Without the power of the people to guide and
propel us forward, none of this would have been possible. This is the
right path, and we will continue to walk on it with courage, until
our people finally have a normal, complete, progressive, beautiful
and great country.
</P>
<P>
Just recently, Freedom House unveiled its Freedom in the World
2004 report. In the "civil liberties" category, Taiwan moved up one
notch, from level two to the highest rating of one, making us one of
26 nations where freedom improved. We ought to take pride in this
accomplishment, and protect and cherish it.
</P>
<P>
Over the past year, Taiwan held two nationwide elections, one for
president and the other to elect legislators. Regardless of the
outcomes, both should be regarded as part of the regular process of
democratic development. Democracy is precious, because no matter
which party or candidate wins, in the end they should all work
towards a final victory for the people. Now that the heated campaigns
have ended, the people need calm and rest, while the nation needs
solidarity and stability.
</P>
<P>
The choice of the people sent a clear message: The governing
party must rule with humility while the opposition parties be
rational in providing oversight. Taiwan's society does not need
bifurcation between the blue and green camps, nor does it need
ongoing confrontation between the governing and opposition parties.
The governing and opposition parties each have their own roles to
play. Fair competition, cooperation rather than confrontation, checks
and balances, and solidarity rather than infighting--these are now
the ardent expectations of the people of Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
I myself identify very strongly with the voice of the people, and
fully grasp where my duties and responsibilities as president lie.
Today is the beginning of a new year; I would like to hereby advocate
openly that Taiwan must head toward a new era of consultation and
dialogue.
</P>
<P>
The two major elections last year did not result in any clear
change in the domestic political landscape. Nevertheless, the people
certainly do not wish to see a continuation and recurrence of the
political impasse, confrontation and infighting of the past four
years. Therefore, we must find a way to avoid repeating the same
mistakes again, stop the internal squabbles, and end the political
chaos. This is not just the common duty of both the governing and
opposition parties, but also the primary responsibility of every
political leader.
</P>
<P>
Politics is an art of possibilities. In the democratic and
pluralistic society of Taiwan today, it is possible to clearly
express opinions and positions through incisive confrontation and
unrelenting resistance; however, this often leads to an impasse where
no compromise or conclusion is possible. While the governing and
opposition parties must be accountable to their supporters, each
should try to take a step back, understand the others, and empathize
with them. They should exhibit tolerance of each other and sincerity
in negotiations. The vast majority of people would be pleased to see
the governing and opposition parties take an initial step toward
reconciliation and cooperation. Consultative dialogue between the
governing and opposition parties cannot be for the exchange of power
and position, but rather for social stability, the future of the
nation, and the welfare of the people. Inter-party consultations
could be conducted openly, and would be subject to scrutiny by the
people and their oversight through public opinion.
</P>
<P>
Of course, we fully understand that in order to create a new and
stable environment based on rational consultation and sincere
dialogue, the ruling and opposition parties should start with areas
on which consensus has already been formed. For instance, the
governing and the opposition parties all appealed to their
constituencies before the legislative election by pushing for ten
priority bills and legislation of nine major laws. These proposals
contain policies and bills in common that the people earnestly expect
to see realized. These include tax reforms, a balanced budget,
implementation of a national pension, sustainable management of
National Health Insurance, review of educational expenditures and the
tuition burden, military service reform, privatization of state-owned
enterprises, the budget for major arms procurements, reducing the gap
between rich and poor, and improvements in cross-strait relations. We
believe that these policy and legislative proposals would make good
starting points for the engagement of rational consultation and
sincere dialogue among political parties.
</P>
<P>
To achieve this goal, I would like to wholeheartedly invite
leaders from the governing and opposition parties, as well as
representatives of the executive and legislative branches, to meet as
soon as possible to negotiate each of the above-mentioned policies
and legislative bills of public concern. Through rational dialogue
and policy debate, proposals and positions of different parties would
be respected, with efforts being primarily devoted to seeking common
ground despite differences. Eventually, through the consensus of
political parties, policies and bills would be implemented and
enacted by the executive branch and the legislative branch, thereby
meeting national needs and public expectations.
</P>
<P>
We expect to see a win-win situation in future relations among
the governing and opposition parties as well as the interaction
between the new legislature and cabinet. Only the vigorous
development of the governing and opposition parties can ensure sound
party politics. The executive branch has to be strong, so does the
legislative branch; the governing and the opposition parties have to
be robust; and citizens of this country must be tenacious, more so
than myself, if Taiwan is to be a great country.
</P>
<P>
According to the Constitution, after the cabinet resigns, the
President should appoint a new premier and form a new cabinet. During
this process, I will listen attentively to the voice of the people
and to the opinions of the governing and opposition parties. As long
as it will benefit the stability of domestic politics, welfare of the
people, harmony among ethnic groups, and cross-strait peace, anything
can be open to reconciliation or cooperation between the governing
and opposition parties. In the future, the new cabinet should enhance
its functionality in consultation and dialogue, such as those between
the executive and the legislative branches, among the governing and
opposition parties, and with the people at the grassroots level.
Special emphasis should be placed on areas such as issues that
concern social wellbeing, the care for the disadvantaged, and the
provision of welfare. As we strive to reinvigorate the economy and
upgrade national competitiveness, we must also attend to and seek
fairness and justice in society.
</P>
<P>
Distinguished guests and colleagues, we stand here today as the
steward of the faith and trust our people have bestowed upon us.
During the election, there might have been a Pan-Green and Pan-Blue
divide; but, with the election now behind us, there should only be
"one country and a unified people" here in Taiwan. Confronted by the
capricious and ephemeral nature of international affairs and ever so
fierce global competitions, especially with the escalating
belligerent rhetoric and military intimidation from the other side of
the Strait, we must stand in solidarity to face these external
challenges, so as to ensure the welfare and happiness of our people
and the future of our country.
</P>
<P>
Over the past four years, we have, on many occasions, extended
olive branches of peace to the other side of the Strait, actively
seeking to establish new basis for the resumption of cross-strait
dialogue and consultation. Just this past year, we have repeatedly
expressed our sincerity and goodwill for the promotion and
normalization of cross-strait relations, as in my inaugural speech of
May, National Day Address, and the ten-point conclusion of November
10 at a high-level national security meeting. However, regrettably,
despite all our efforts, the other side remains reluctant in giving
up its military intimidation against Taiwan. Moreover, the other side
continues its saber rattling and suppression of Taiwan on all fronts.
Now, the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) attempts to unilaterally
arbitrate and sanction cross-strait issues, concocting a so-called
"legal basis" for its military invasion of Taiwan. Such actions will
not only unilaterally change the status quo of peace in the Taiwan
Strait, but will also pose the greatest threat to regional stability
and world peace.
</P>
<P>
We once again urge the CCP authorities not to under-estimate the
will of the Taiwan people in defending the sovereignty, security and
dignity of the Republic of China. The sustainable and peaceful
development of cross-strait relation not only echoes the collective
longing of peoples on both sides of the Strait, it also aligns with
the expectations from the international community. We will continue
to adhere to our policy of "keeping a firm stance while moving
forward pragmatically" in dealing with cross-strait issues. Even in
the face of the unilateral and aggressive actions by the CCP, we will
"take hold of the intent, and not act on impulse." In addition, we
will proceed in a manner that is "deliberate and not backward,
steadfast and not hasty," to form a "Committee for Cross-Strait Peace
and Development, " to forge an internal consensus in Taiwan, and
actively promote and establish a peace and stability framework for
cross-strait interactions.
</P>
<P>
I would like to express my appreciation for our international
allies, including the United States and Japan, for their long-term
support for the people of Taiwan and for their concern about peace
across the Taiwan Strait. The relations Taiwan has cultivated with
the international community draw strengths from not only a "value
alliance" of freedom, democracy and human rights, but also the
acquiescence and mutual understanding developed from long-term
cooperation. However, in light of tremendous pressure and suppression
in the international arena from the other side, Taiwan's foreign
diplomacy faces enormous challenges. Sometimes progress can only be
made tacitly, and not publicized. Other times, we must bear the
weight of our responsibilities along side the indignation of unfair
slanders. While constructive criticisms are always appreciated,
unfounded speculation and distortion, or the denigration of the amity
and friendship Taiwan shares with our international allies, are not.
Fundamentally, we have absolute confidence in the future expansion of
Taiwan's international space, as well as our relations with the
United States and Japan.
</P>
<P>
The severe earthquake and tsunamis in South Asia have caused a
tragic catastrophe and stirred compassion in our hearts. Our
government and people should act on the spirit of feeling other's
pain as one's own, and contribute to our utmost ability to the
international relief efforts. In addition to the urgent demand for
rescue work and medical aid, there will be an enormous need for
materials and manpower in future reconstruction. We should continue
to express our concern and bravely give ourselves to the relief
efforts so that the countries and people impacted by the disaster may
feel the compassion and kindness coming from Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
My dear colleagues and fellow countrymen: There is only one
Taiwan, and there is only one future for our nation. The
responsibilities and goals that we hold in common are to "unite
Taiwan, stabilize cross-strait relations, seek social harmony, and
reinvigorate the economy." Walking in humbleness and adopting a
pragmatic approach, I would like to take the lead in the pursuit of a
"Taiwan in unity." In the year ahead of us, let's listen carefully to
the voice of the people and work together toward a new and stable
environment of comprehensive consultation and dialogue. We should
stand together to meet new challenges and create greater
opportunities for Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
In closing, I would like to wish the Republic of China great
prosperity! May all my colleagues and compatriots at home and abroad
enjoy a Happy New Year!

LEGISLATIVE HEAD HOPES FOR 'ICE-BREAKING JOURNEY' TO MAINLAND CHINA
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei, Jan. 1 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The head of the Legislative Yuan said
Saturday that he will activate a cross-Taiwan Strait task force
mechanism in the legislature this year and engage in an "ice-breaking
journey" to mainland China.
</P>
<P>
Legislative Speaker Wang Jin-pyng made the remarks as he spoke of
his New Year wishes for 2005.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the government has been unable to adopt a substantive
and effective approach to break the present cross-strait impasse,
Wang said he is worried about the people as well as the industrial
sector.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that after he wins his re-election
bid for the legislative speakership, he will activate the
cross-strait task force mechanism in the legislature and embark on
the "ice-breaking journey" to the mainland.
</P>
<P>
The time for activating the cross-strait task force is ripe, Wang
said, adding that cross-strait relations should not continue to
stall, and that some of the things or measures that the government is
incapable of doing must not be allowed to drag on forever.
</P>
<P>
"The legislature will be on the side of the people to help
communicate so as to make up for the deficiencies of the
administrative branch," he said.
</P>
<P>
The previous legislature passed a resolution to form the
cross-strait task force, with the speaker serving as convener and the
vice speaker as vice convener, and various political parties
contributing a total of 21 representatives in proportion of the ratio
of their legislative seats.
</P>
<P>
"If the nation needs it, the people give consent, the legislature
passes a resolution, and the journey can be based on equal footing,
then I'll visit mainland China," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said the cross-strait task force will have room for
development, adding that it will promote anything that will
contribute to cross-strait peace and stability.
</P>
<P>
He also said that if the legislative caucus of the opposition
Kuomintang can coordinate with air carriers on both sides of the
Taiwan Strait to reach a consensus on promoting cross-strait charter
flights during the Chinese New Year holiday in February, then the
task force will start from there to continue to communicate and
consult with the mainland so as to promote measures that will be
beneficial to Taiwan's people and industry.
</P>
<P>
He said that the legislature is currently reviewing a draft bill
to promote cross-strait peace proposed by the opposition People First
Party and that if the bill clears the legislature and a cross-strait
peace commission is formed, it would provide a legal basis for the
legislature to promote cross-strait exchanges.

TAIWAN, MAINLAND CHINA SHOULD HOLD PEACE TALKS: MAC OFFICIAL
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Jan. 1 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taiwan and mainland China should hold talks
to mend their differences and resolve their disputes to avoid changes
to the status quo across the Taiwan Strait, a government official
urged Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Chiu Tai-san, vice chairman of the Cabinet-level Mainland Affairs
Council (MAC) , made the remarks after President Chen Shui-bian gave
his New Year message earlier the same day in which he called for
reconciliation between the ruling and opposition parties to create
political stability, benefits for the people, ethnic harmony and
cross-strait peace.
</P>
<P>
Beijing has initiated moves to draft an "anti-secession" law
apparently aimed at Taiwan, which Chiu described as a gross attempt
to unilaterally alter the status quo in the strait. He called for
bilateral negotiations to deal with rifts.
</P>
<P>
According to the MAC vice chairman, the "anti-secession" law
being established by the Beijing regime would be worse than a
"unification law" by seeking to view the two sides of the Taiwan
Strait -- two independent states under separate rule -- as an
integral entity.
</P>
<P>
Saying that the cross-strait status quo should not be
unilaterally dictated or arbitrated by either side, he urged Beijing
to resolve its disputes with Taipei through peaceful means to secure
peace and prosperity in the region, as this is the expectation and
demand of the Taiwan people and the international community.
</P>
<P>
Relations between Taiwan and the mainland have become even more
sensitive than usual since the campaign for Taiwan's Dec. 11
legislative elections, in which Chen brought up issues such as
changing the names of state-run enterprises and government offices
overseas by including the word "Taiwan" in their official titles.
</P>
<P>
The move led to the countermeasure late last month by Beijing,
which has repeatedly warned that it will not allow Taiwan to declare
de-jure independence at any cost, including the use of force.
</P>
<P>
The cross-strait rift goes back to 1949, when the Kuomintang
retreated to Taiwan after losing a civil war to the Chinese
communists in mainland China.
</P>
<P>
Despite the fact that the two sides are sovereign states ruled by
independent governments since that year, Beijing claims that Taiwan
forms an inalienable part of the mainland and makes every effort to
block the island on the international stage.

POLITICAL PARTIES GIVE MIXED REACTION TO 'ICE-BRAKING JOURNEY' PROPOSAL
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Jan.  1 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The various political parties reacted
predictably Saturday to Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng's
proposal to reactivate a cross-Taiwan Strait task force mechanism and
embark on an "ice-breaking journey" to mainland China to help break
the current cross-strait impasse.
</P>
<P>
Tsai Huang-liang, whip of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) caucus in the legislature, said that the DPP welcomes anything
that will be conducive to cross-strait peace.
</P>
<P>
However, if Wang wants to make the mainland visit on behalf of
the legislature, he should "exercise caution," Tsai said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that Beijing has always tried to downgrade Taiwan's
sovereignty and said Wang should be alert that his status as a
legislative speaker is not downgraded by Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) said it will
support Wang's proposal to activate a cross-strait task force
mechanism in the legislature and to visit the mainland.
</P>
<P>
KMT Legislator Tseng Yung-chuan claimed that Beijing has given up
hope on President Chen Shui-bian and that it is impossible that
Beijing will ever resume talks with Chen's administration.
</P>
<P>
Judging from Chen's campaign theme in the 2004 presidential
election, cross-strait relations will continue to be strained and
Wang's advocacy of a cross-strait task force "comes in the nick of
time," he said.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that cross-strait charter flights during Chinese
New Year are being organized by the KMT because Chen's government is
incapable of doing the job.
</P>
<P>
The KMT has coordinated with six air carriers in Taiwan to call
on the Mainland Affairs Council -- Taiwan's highest mainland policy
charter -- and air carriers on the mainland to help bring about the
charter services for Taiwan businessmen operating on the mainland and
their dependents who wish to return to Taiwan during the Chinese New
Year holiday.
</P>
<P>
The People First Party, an ally of the KMT, said that it will be
pleased to see Wang lead a delegation to visit the mainland.
</P>
<P>
Liu Wen-hsiung, the PFP caucus whip, said that the PFP will also
send representatives to take part in the proposed cross-strait task
force.
</P>
<P>
But the Taiwan Solidarity Union, an ally of the DPP, said it
would be "inappropriate" to reactivate the cross-strait task force,
which was first launched in 2000 but has been moribund ever since.
</P>
<P>
Huang Tzung-yuan, TSU caucus whip, said that the proposed task
force should be appointed by President Chen Shui-bian and formed by
the government rather than by the Legislative Yuan.
</P>
<P>
If the task force is formed according to the ratio of legislative
seats held by each party, he questioned whether it will represent the
nation or just the legislature itself.

<P>
Opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Lien
Chan called on supporters of the "pan-blue alliance" Saturday to
unite for the future development of the Republic of China.
</P>
<P>
Lien made the remarks after hosting a New Year flag-raising
ceremony in Taipei for a group of opposition supporters. The event
was arranged in an obvious attempt to differentiate from the official
ceremony presided over by President Chen Shui-bian in front of the
Presidential Office.
</P>
<P>
Lien said 2005 marks the 94th year of the foundation of the ROC
by Sun Yat-sen and that it is a moment of honor and pride to see the
ROC flag being raised again.
</P>
<P>
Lien pointed out that the Legislative Yuan will pass a new
milestone in the new year, with the new legislature set to be formed
Feb. 1 based on a new mandate.
</P>
<P>
He pledged that the KMT will work in the new legislature to
safeguard the sovereignty and dignity of the ROC, promote
cross-Taiwan Strait peace, deepen the democratic politics of Taiwan,
enhance social solidarity and peace and boost the country's economic
development.
</P>
<P>
In addition, he said, the KMT will push for legislation aimed at
offering education subsidies for youth, regulating education funding,
protecting the retirement benefits of teachers, upgrading health care
for farmers, enhancing social aid, starting a national pension
program, replacing compulsory military service with a volunteer one,
regulating major arms procurement items and boosting financial
discipline.

TAIWAN ECONOMY PROMISING DESPITE OBSTACLES: TAITRA HEAD
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Jan. 1 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Backed by an estimated economic growth rate
of nearly 6 percent for 2004, Taiwan's economy is expected to
continue to expand this year, despite the fact that various factors
remain in the way, a prominent trade official said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking in an exclusive interview with CNA, Hsu Chih-jen,
chairman of the semi-official Taiwan External Trade Development
Council (TAITRA) , said that international prices of oil and raw
materials and the course of the U.S. and Taiwan currencies will be
the prime factors affecting the performance of the domestic economy
in the year to come.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Hsu pointed out, the effects arising from mainland
China's economic integration with the Association of Southeast Asian
Nations (ASEAN) will also be an important issue that Taiwan must
address properly. Both the mainland and ASEAN member states are
Taiwan's key export markets.
</P>
<P>
Although the Cabinet-level Directorate General of Budget,
Accounting and Statistics and the Chung-Hua Institution for Economic
Research both forecast that the economy will grow by more than 4
percent in 2005, he failed to echo their predictions but instead
called for measures to build up consumer confidence to secure
continued economic development.
</P>
<P>
Should the mainland economy take a "hard landing" after its
currency is revalued, global economies, including Taiwan, will be
dealt a blow, he said, predicting that the renminbi will gain in
value in the second half of next year.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, a "hard landing" of the mainland economy will
not be totally bad for Taiwan, he went on, basing his argument on the
grounds that a cooler mainland economy should help bring down oil and
commodity prices in the international market.
</P>
<P>
The TAITRA chairman also warned of the impact of the free trade
agreement (FTA) clinched by the mainland with ASEAN that is slated to
take effect in July.
</P>
<P>
Convinced of the possibility that Taiwan runs the risk of being
marginalized by the mainland-ASEAN FTA, he played down, however, the
impact speculated upon by the media and encouraged Taiwan companies
to adopt flexible approaches to counter the changes through
multilateral trade mechanisms.
</P>
<P>
Many domestic businesses have already relocated to the mainland
and countries in Southeast Asia, and none of those in Taiwan are
making money out of customs duties, he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
TAITRA, formerly known as the China External Development Council,
was set up in 1970 to help Taiwan businesses explore international
trade. It is Taiwan's No. 1 non-profit trade promotion body and Hsu
has served as its chairman for more than a year.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Tu Sheng-cheng, chairman of the Cabinet-level Council
for Economic Planning and Development, acknowledged that the recent
earthquakes and tsunami that devastated many countries in Southeast
Asia and South Asia will have negative effects on Taiwan's economy.
</P>
<P>
Currently, ASEAN member states absorb some 13 percent of Taiwan's
outbound shipments and this portion will go up to 50 percent if
Taiwan's export ratio to mainland China is included.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, an economist said that the worst for Taiwan's
economy is already over, evidenced in that the country's jobless rate
has been falling with an increasingly adjusted industrial structure.
</P>
<P>
Wu Chung-shu, a researcher at the Institute of Economics under
Academia Sinica, made the comment at a year-end seminar to check the
country's economic performance over the past year and look to its
outlook for the coming year.
</P>
<P>
According to Wu, the domestic economy has come out of the shadow
cast by consumer price inflation over the past few years.
</P>
<P>
Quoting the newest statistics made public in November by the
government, he reported that Taiwan's consumer price index began to
post a positive growth rate in January year-on-year after having
registered negative growth for three years in a row. It hit a high of
3.34 percent in July and stood at 1.49 percent in November, he said.

PRESIDENT SHOULD MATCH WORDS WITH DEEDS: OPPOSITION ALLIANCE
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Jan.  1 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The opposition "pan-blue alliance" of the
Kuomintang (KMT) and its ally the People First Party (PFP) said
Saturday that President Chen Shui-bian should match his words with
deeds if he really wants harmony between the ruling and opposition
parties.
</P>
<P>
The "pan-blue alliance" was responding to an olive branch
extended by Chen in his New Year message in which he called for
reconciliation between the parties now that the two nationwide
elections in 2004, one for president and the other to elect
legislators, are over.
</P>
<P>
The president also said that during the process of appointing a
new premier, he will listen to the voice of the people and to the
opinions of the ruling and opposition parties. In the future, the new
cabinet should enhance its functionality in consultation and
dialogue, he added.
</P>
<P>
However, KMT spokesman Chang Jung-kung claimed that the
confrontation between the parties can be traced to the president
himself, especially during election times.
</P>
<P>
If the president wants to preach harmony and reconciliation, he
should start with himself, Chang added.
</P>
<P>
He said that during the Dec. 11 legislative elections, Chen
vehemently attacked KMT Chairman Lien Chan as well as PFP Chairman
James Soong. The president should apologize for attacking Lien and
Soong or vow not to do so again, Chang said.
</P>
<P>
He also said that the formation of a new cabinet should show
respect to the dual-head system stipulated in the Constitution as
well as the majority in the legislature, but claimed that the
president has no substantive ideas on either of these two aspects.
</P>
<P>
"It is empty words for the president to say that he will listen
attentively to the voice of the people," according to Chang.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the PFP officials said Chen should build up his
credibility to "regain the trust of the people" and forego his path
toward Taiwan independence.
</P>

PRESIDENT DECLARES 2005  `HEALTHY LIFE' YEAR
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Jan. 1 (CNA)

<TEXT>
<P>
President Chen Shui-bian and Vice President
Annette Lu jointly proclaimed 2005 as a "healthy life" year during a
series of activities held Saturday in Taichung, central Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
The activity drew an enthusiastic response from the private
sector, with around 600 members from 60 civic groups from Taipei and
Kaohsiung gathering at the square in front of the National Taiwan
Museum of Fine Arts in Taichung to take part in the event.
</P>
<P>
The president noted that Taiwan has the longest official working
hours in the world and said that although it represents the diligence
of the local people, the satisfaction level with life of Taiwan
people is relatively lower than other countries, showing that hard
work does not necessarily bring a happy life.
</P>
<P>
He urged a positive attitude toward life, saying that
it will help one's health and happiness.
</P>
<P>
Lu for her part said that people should be largely responsible
for their own health, saying that in addition to the pursuit of
fortune, people should also pay attention to health.
</P>
<P>
She compared the average lifespan of Taiwan people and happiness
index with its economic achievements, saying that the happiness index
lags far behind its economic performance and that the nation should
make further efforts in this respect.

TAIWAN TO PROVIDE WATER TO DROUGHT-STRICKEN MATSU

<P>
Taiwan will provide water to the outlying
island of Matsu, which has been seriously affected by a shortage,
government officials said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Currently, Matsu's Nankang area has been troubled by a grave
shortage, as local reservoirs contain only a combined 75,000 tons of
water, officials of the Water Resources Agency (WRA) under the
Ministry of Economic Affairs said, adding that Matsu residents are
provided water only two days out of every three.
</P>
<P>
The WRA has already transported a total of 8,471 tons of water to
the remote island in four shipments and will continue to do so to
help meet demand for potable water, the officials noted.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to abundant rainfall brought by typhoon Nanmadol in early
December, Taiwan proper, in particular the northern regions, is rich
in water reserves, according to the officials. They added that water
supply for civic and industrial use is secured through May, when the
annual rainy season will begin for spring seeding.

EXPORTS, IMPORTS TO REGISTER DOUBLE-DIGIT GROWTH IN 2005: BOFT

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taiwan's exports and imports will register
double-digit growth in 2005, officials of the Bureau of Foreign Trade
(BOFT) said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
According to studies carried out by the Chung-Hua Institution for
Economic Research under the commission of BOFT , the officials said
that riding on the coattails of worldwide weak performance beginning
in the third quarter in 2004, exports in 2005 will reach US$195.05
billion, while imports will reach US$182.66 billion, up 11.46 percent
and 10.35 percent over the previous year's levels, respectively.
</P>
<P>
It also said that one of the factors favorable to Taiwan's
exports in 2005 will be the maintenance of international oil prices
at about US$40 per barrel.
</P>
<P>
Unfavorable factors will include the possible raising of U.S.
interest rates in 2005, coupled with the continued sluggishness of
the U.S. dollar against the yen and the euro, which will in turn
affect the world economy.
</P>
<P>
According to the studies, Taiwan's economic growth rate for the
year is expected to increase to 5.8 percent, while the U.S. dollar
will be worth an average NT$33.

<P>
Taiwan manufacturers should develop branding
for their own products, the chairman of the Taiwan External Trade
Development Council (TAITRA) said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Hsu Chih-jen said in an interview with CNA that Taiwan has
demonstrated its excellence as an original equipment manufacturer
(OEM).
</P>
<P>
However, he suggested, Taiwan companies should develop their own
brands in the face of decreasing profits from the OEM and increasing
international competition.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan can not compete with mainland China on price but is able
to vie for market share with Japan and the United States on quality
products, he explained.
</P>
<P>
The establishment of the non-profit Taiwan Design Center in last
year was aimed at helping domestic manufacturers develop their own
brands by integrating the public and private resources in the
research and development and the designing of products, Hsu added.

The parade has been held in Pasadena in suburban Los Angeles on

An ROC medical team has begun
to help victims of the 9.0 earthquake and tsunamis on the Indonesia
island of Sumatra.
</P>
<P>
The team, which arrived in Banda Aceh, the capital of Aceh
Province Saturday, has already set up a temporary medical
station at an overseas Chinese-owned abandoned factory in Lhok, a
village located some 12 kilometers from Banda Aceh.
</P>
<P>
Several of the team's members have jointly diagnosed and treated
63 victims in the village and according to them, most suffer
psychological effects from the disaster, others have external
injuries and illnesses related to having consumed bad food and water.
</P>

Reports said that about 700 to 800 of the 1,400 inhabitants of
Lhok were killed by the devastating tsunami triggered by the strong
earthquake.

PFP STILL AGAINST U.S. ARMS PURCHASE PLAN: AIDE
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei, Jan. 2 (CNA)
(By P. C. Tang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The opposition People First Party (PFP) will
remain opposed to the plan to purchase arms from the United States as
long as the Ministry of National Defense is unwilling to give
detailed explanations of the plan and cannot ease public concerns
over the high cost, a ranking PFP member said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Chang Hsien-yao, head of the PFP's policy-planning center, who
made the comments in response to media questions, also said that the
government's arms purchase plan should be dealt with by members of
the new legislature. The new legislators elected on Dec. 11, 2004
will assume their posts Feb. 1.
</P>
<P>
The Executive Yuan has proposed a special budget of NT$610.8
billion to buy six Patriot PAC-3 anti-missiles batteries, eight
diesel-fueled submarines and a squadron of 12 anti-submarine
aircraft.
</P>
<P>
Touching on reports saying that some PFP legislators would
support a bill authorizing the arms purchase plan and that the
Ministry of National Defense would propose a new special budget for
the plan after the adoption of the bill, Chang said that this is not
the PFP's position.
</P>
<P>
PFP Chairman James Soong reiterated before departing for the
United States a few days ago to visit his family that his party would
support a reasonable and necessary arms purchase plan to protect the
nation, but would never support a plan that includes paying the
United States an exorbitant amount for the weaponry, Chang said,
adding that this stance has not changed and that the party will not
change it position.
</P>
<P>
Pointing out that the Ministry of National Defense has never
given a clear explanation to the people on its decision-making
process, the reasons for the high price and details of the
procurement items of the arms purchase plan, the PFP aide said the
party will urge the ministry to be transparent on these issues.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the PFP will oversee the arms purchase plan carefully
since it could be the island's most important weapons purchase in the
next 10 years, Chang said that as the current legislature has no time
to deliberate on the plan, the members of the new legislature will be
entrusted with dealing with the plan.

TAIWAN EXPECTED TO BE GLOBAL LEADER IN MICROCHIP FOUNDRIES BY 2006
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Jan.  2 (CNA)
(By Luis Huang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taiwan is expected to have the most
microchip foundries in the world by 2006, Minister of Economic
Affairs Ho Mei-yueh said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Ho said that currently there are four 12-inch wafer plants in
Taiwan, in addition to six under construction and two others planned
to be built soon, adding that the island will have 10 12-inch
microchip foundries by 2006, more than the United States' seven,
Japan's five, South Korea's two.
</P>
<P>
Coupled with the existing 20 eight-inch, eight six-inch and three
five-inch wafer plants, the competitiveness of Taiwan's semiconductor
industry is expected to remain strong, Ho pointed out.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics released by the Ministry of Economic
Affairs, the production value of Taiwan's IC design sector hit
NT$190.2 billion (US$5.97 billion) in 2003, with the global market
share reaching 28 percent, second only to the United States.
</P>
<P>
The outsourced production of silicon wafers amounted to NT$470.1
billion, accounting for 70.8 percent of the global market, the
world's number one, while the global market share of IC packaging and
assembly also ranked first globally, the tallies indicated, adding
that the production value for each item in 2004 was higher than the
previous year's level.
</P>
<P>
Noting that Taiwan's semiconductor industry enjoys a perfect
vertical division of labor and integration ranging from designing,
outsourcing, manufacturing to package and testing, Ho said she is
confident that the industry's global competitiveness will remain
strong.
</P>
<P>
The minister also reiterated that the government will only permit
domestic semiconductor manufacturers to set up eight-inch wafer
plants in mainland China for the moment, with only three factories to
be built by 2005. As a result, she stressed, the policy will have a
limited impact on the island's industrial development.

MERGING  TAIWAN'S BANKS WILL HELP BOOST COMPETITIVENESS: REPORT
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
New York,  Jan.  1 (CNA)
(By Lilian Lin &amp; Luis Huang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taiwan's government should speed up
mergers of domestic banks to upgrade the global competitiveness of
the island's financial sector, according to a research report quoted
by the Wall Street Journal Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The report issued by the consultancy company McKinsey &amp; Co.
pointed out that an oversupply of financial institutions in Taiwan
will adversely affect the country's long-term banking development,
although the island's financial service industry ranks fourth in Asia
in terms of business turnover.
</P>
<P>
As an island country with a population of only 23 million, Taiwan
has 49 banks and more than 300 financial institutions dealing with
loans, the report said, adding that it is difficult
for domestic banks to expand their business as supply has
outstripped demand.
</P>
<P>
In Taipei City alone, there are 3.4 bank branches offering
services to an average of 10,000 people, much higher than the 1.9
branches in Hong Kong and the 1.3 branches in New York, the
international consultancy company said.
</P>
<P>
If Taiwan wants to enhance the global competitiveness
of its financial industry, it must do everything possible to
accelerate the merger of domestic banks.
</P>
<P>
McKinsey suggested in its report that financial institutions on
the island be reduced to 15 at most, including one or two loan banks
with international competitiveness, five large-scale domestic banks
and several small-sized banks operating at a profit.
</P>
<P>
Conscious of the importance of merging domestic banks, Taiwan's
government officials in charge of financial affairs have been working
actively to push for the merger of financial institutions over the
past years, the report indicated.
</P>
<P>
However, the merger plan has not been carried out as scheduled
because of strong pressure from the opposition-controlled legislature
and trade unions, the report went on. It also called on the
government to play a more active role in pushing for bank
integration.

DPP LEGISLATIVE CAUCUS CALLS FOR SPEEDY PASSAGE OF 2005 BUDGET BILL
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>

(By Luis Huang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The legislative caucus of the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) said Sunday that rational
discussions must be held among political parties so that the 2005
general budget bill can clear the legislative floor as soon as
possible.
</P>
<P>
Legislator Tsai Huang-lang, who also serves as secretary-general
of the DPP legislative caucus, made the appeal on the eve of a
cross-party negotiation on the central government's 2005 budget
proposal to be held Monday in the Legislative Yuan.
</P>
<P>
Since the legislative caucuses of the opposition Kuomintang (KMT)
and the People First Party (PFP) are planning to review the general
budget plan in a stricter way, Tsai urged lawmakers from the two
parties to be rational when they go over the bill.
</P>
<P>
"I am hopeful that the general budget proposal will clear the
legislature before it goes into recess Jan. 21; otherwise, the
executive branch will have trouble in carrying out various
administrative affairs," Tsai told reporters.
</P>
<P>
As to a media report that the KMT and the PFP have decided to
slash the proposed government expenditures and revenues for the new
fiscal year by NT$100 billion (US$3.15 billion) , Tsai said that if
budget cuts are reasonable, the DPP caucus will accept them so that
the budget proposal will be approved by the legislature as scheduled.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Legislator Huang Teh-fu, also a secretary-general of
the KMT caucus, and Legislator Liu Wen-hsiung, who also serves as
chief convener of the PFP caucus, reiterated unanimously that the two
parties will closely cooperate in reviewing the central government's
budget bill.
</P>
<P>
"KMT and PFP lawmakers will strictly review the general budget
plan submitted by the Executive Yuan for the new fiscal year, " they
pointed out, adding that they will insist that unreasonable budget
items be removed during the deliberation process.
</P>
<P>
For his part, Chen Chien-ming, deputy convener of the legislative
caucus of the opposition Taiwan Solidarity Union, said that his party
will support the speedy passage of the general budget plan but will
push for the government to cross out those budget items which are
inadequately listed.

JOB-CREATION PROJECT HELPS LOWER 2004 UNEMPLOYMENT RATE
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Jan.  2 (CNA)
(By Luis Huang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The overall unemployment rate for 2004 is
expected to be 4.5 percent thanks to the government's program begun
two years ago to create jobs, a government official said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan followed South Korea's model and offered jobs in the
public service sector to boost employment in early 2003 to help curb
the growing jobless rate, said the official with the Cabinet-level
Council for Economic Planning and Development (CEPD).
</P>
<P>
According to official statistics, the short-term job-creation
program offered nearly 46,000 opportunities to jobless people for a
period of six months last year, which the official said will help
bring down Taiwan's jobless rate for 2004 to 4.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
As of June last year, there were about 21,000 applicants hoping
to find work under the program, with about 10,000 of them being
placed with employers, the statistics showed.

TAIWAN OFFERS US$50 MILLION IN RELIEF AID TO TSUNAMI-HIT COUNTRIES
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Jan. 2 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Republic of China government will offer
US$50 million in relief to countries stricken by a devastating
earthquake and ensuing tsunamis last week, Vice Premier Yeh Chu-lan
said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Yeh made the announcement after presiding over an
inter-departmental meeting to discuss how to help with post-disaster
relief work in a dozen tsunami-hit countries around the Indian Ocean,
including Indonesia, Sri Lanka, Thailand and India.
</P>
<P>
Yeh said the aid package will include food aid, medical supplies
and community reconstruction.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the scope of damage caused by the Dec. 26 earthquake
beneath the Indian Ocean was much more serious than originally
reported, Yeh said the government has decided to boost its aid offer
from US$5 million to US$50 million, including US$20 million worth of
rice, US$15 million worth of medical supplies and US$15 million in
community and harbor reconstruction.
</P>
<P>
Yeh also urged individual citizens to donate funds to help
quake and tsunami victims in South and Southeast Asia. A special
bank account opened by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs had
received NT$40 millio in donation from the private sector. Many local
charitable organizations have also launched fund-raising drives. If
private donations are calculated, relief aid from Taiwan will reach
US$60 million, government sources said.
</P>
<P>
According to tallies compiled by foreign wire services, Taiwan
will rank eighth in the world in terms of aid to the quake- and
tsunami-hit South and Southeast Asian countries. Taiwan's pledged
donation is equivalent to NT$1.6 billion, which is equivalent to
NT$70 for each person in Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Japan tops all countries by promising to donate US$500 million;
followed by the United States with US$350 million; Britain, US$95
million; Sweden, US$75 million; and mainland China, US$65 million.
</P>
<P>
Council of Agriculture Chairman Lee Chin-lung said the government
will donate 2,000 tons of rice and 500,000 cases of cooked rice,
which are worth US$20 million at market prices.
</P>
<P>
Department of Health (DOH) Minister Chen Chien-jen said his
department has organized a 200-member medical team and 3,000 tons of
medical supplies. Moreover, Chen said, the DOH plans to set up 50
medical service centers in disaster zones in various quake- or
tsunami-hit countries.
</P>
<P>
Kuo Yao-chi, chairwoman of the Public Construction Commission,
said that so long as host countries can provide plots of land and
infrastructure facilities, Taiwan can build three residential
communities in two months for surviving victims, with each community
accommodates 300 housing units capable of sheltering 1,500 people, a
school and a medical service station.
</P>
<P>
"We have learned a lot in post-disaster rehabilitation from the
921 earthquake that left more than 2,400 local people dead and tens
of thousands homeless in central Taiwan in 1999," Kuo said.
</P>
<P>
Cabinet spokesman Chen Chi-mai said the aid for the quake- and
tsunami-hit countries will be raised by relevant ministries. If
necessary, Chen said, the Cabinet's second reserve fund will be used
to finance the aid package.
</P>
<P>
More than 150,000 people are feared dead and about five million
were left homeless in the affected countries.

KMT OUTLINES 3 PRINCIPLES FOR PROMOTING CROSS-STRAIT CHARTER FLIGHTS
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Jan.  2 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The opposition Kuomintang reiterated its
three principles Sunday for promoting the opening of direct charter
flights across the Taiwan Strait during the upcoming Chinese New Year
holiday for Taiwan business people working in mainland China.
</P>
<P>
KMT spokesman Chang Jung-kung claimed that the KMT will mainly
play the role of communicator, not negotiator, in the proposed
cross-strait charter flight services.
</P>
<P>
The KMT's three principles are that both mainland and Taiwan
carriers should be allowed to operate cross-strait charter flights
during the period, those flights should be non-stop and three
mainland destinations -- Shanghai, Beijing and Guangzhou -- should be
include in the package.
</P>
<P>
Chang said the KMT package can be carried out without prior
cross-strait negotiations.
</P>
<P>
"With the consent of relevant government authorities, the
proposed two-way, non-stop, cross-strait charter flights can
kick-start," Chang claimed.
</P>
<P>
He urged the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) administration to
accept the KMT-proposed formula to benefit a large number of Taiwan
businesspeople working on the mainland, commonly known as "taishang,"
intending to return to spend the lunar new year holiday.
</P>
<P>
If the KMT-initiated charter flights package can be implemented,
Chang claimed, it can also help defuse cross-strait tension.
</P>
<P>
Chang said representatives from the KMT legislative caucus and
six local carriers will travel to the mainland to discuss with
mainland Chinese air carriers to pave the way for the proposed
holiday charter flights.
</P>
<P>
With Beijing's consent, six Taiwan carriers operated special
charter flights between Shanghai and Taipei/Kaohsiung via Hong
Kong/Macau during the 2003 Chinese New Year holiday. The services
were not offered the following year because Beijing insisted that
mainland carriers also be allowed to provide the same flight services
but refused to negotiate the necessary technical details with Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Huang Teh-fu, KMT legislative whip, said mainland Chinese
carriers can commission private organizations to apply with Taiwan
authorities for permission to operate the proposed cross-strait
charter flights just like what mainland news organizations have been
doing in the past few years in applying for approval to post
reporters in Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
"If the DPP administration agrees to this formula, bilateral
negotiations are not necessary for the opening of special
cross-strait charter flights during the upcoming Chinese New Year
holiday," Huang claimed.
</P>
<P>
Huang said he and his KMT colleagues will pay a visit to the
Mainalnd Affairs Council (MAC) -- Taiwan's top mainland policy
planning agency -- again on Monday to seek its support for the KMT
package.
</P>
<P>
MAC Vice Chairman Liu Teh-hsun said Friday that the proposed
cross-strait charter flights could be modeled after the 2003 formula.
</P>
<P>
Liu said that the MAC has repeatedly urged the mainland side to
negotiate the holiday charter flight issue, but to no avail. With
only a little more than one month before Chinese New Year Day, which
falls on Feb. 9, Liu suggested using the 2003 model in which only
Taiwan carriers operated the special charter flight service.
</P>
<P>
If "taishang" believe that more mainland cities should be
included in the services, Liu siad the MAC is willing to consult with
air carriers to expand the services to Guangzhou and Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Should mainland air carriers want to apply for operating similar
flight services, Liu said, the two sides must consult to come to
terms because such operations involve the exercise of public
authority and complex technical details for safety reasons.

TAIWAN TO DELIVER LARGE AMOUNT OF MEDICAL SUPPLIES TO PHUKET
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei, Jan. 2 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taiwan will send eight doctors and
epidemiologists to the Thai resort island of Phuket Tuesday to assist
in post-disaster medical aid and disinfection work, a Department of
Health (DOH) official said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
On the same day, the official said, a large amount of medical
supplies to be donated by Taiwan, including surgical gloves,
disinfection equipment, antibiotics, painkillers and
anti-inflammation drugs, will also arrive in Phuket, one of the
hardest-hit areas in the Dec. 26 tsunami catastrophe triggered by a
magnitude-9.0 earthquake off the northern Indonesia island of
Sumatra.
</P>
<P>
As of Sunday, the official said, 13 Taiwan medical professionals
have arrived in Medan, Indonesia to offer post-disaster medical aid.
The non-government organization Taiwan Roots Medical Peace Corps has
also send a 42-member medical team to work in Sri Lanka.
</P>
<P>
Chang said the DOH will organize various medical teams to take
turn in working in quake- and tsunami-hit South and Southeast Asian
nations, including Indonesia, Sri Lanka and Thailand. Each team will
work at various host countries for two weeks.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, Vice Premier Yeh Chu-lan announced that the
government will offer US$50 million in relief to countries
stricken by the devastating earthquake and ensuing tsunamis last
week.

FORMER PRESIDENT WRAPS UP JAPAN VISIT
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Jan.  2 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Former President Lee Teng-hui returned to
Taipei Sunday after a seven-day private visit to Japan, which has
drew strong protests from mainland China.
</P>
<P>
Lee told more than 1,200 supporters who turned up at Chiang
Kai-shek International Airport to greet him that his Japan visit amid
Beijing's protest indicates that relations between Taipei and Tokyo
are close.
</P>
<P>
In his view, Lee said, Taiwan-Japanese relations have been
advancing quietly.
</P>
<P>
Despite Beijing's loud protests, Lee said most Japanese people
welcomed his visit, adding that his visit indicates that
Taiwan-Japanese ties are in the best shape in history.
</P>
<P>
In the new year, Lee said all local people should redouble
efforts to reinforce Taiwan's national identity, speed up the
campaign to rectify the name of Taiwan and continue democratic reform
to make Taiwan a "normal and complete" democratic country.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Foreign Affairs Tan Sun Chen and lawmakers from the
Taiwan Solidarity Union of which Lee is the spiritual leader greeted
Lee at the airport.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday morning, Lee visited the Kiyomizu Buddhist temple and
paid his tribute to the grave of the late Ryotaro Shiba, a Japanese
author of historical novels on modern Asia. Shiba had interviewed Lee
in Taipei when he was the Republic of China president.
</P>
<P>
Before leaving the ancient Japanese capital of Kyoto for Kansai
International Airport near Osaka, western Japan to take a flight for
home, Lee issued a brief statement, expressing his gratitude for the
hospitality he had received during his visit.
</P>
<P>
"I want to thank the Japanese government and people for their
warmth and hospitality. I've learned a lot from this journey, " Lee
said.
</P>
<P>
Lee further said the trip could be viewed as successful "if I was
able to serve as a quiet yet firm link between both sides."
</P>
<P>
During his trip, Lee, 81, managed to meet with his 98-year-old
Japanese Sukekata Kashiwa who was Lee's professor when Lee studied at
the agroeconomics department of Kyoto University in the early 1940s.
Taiwan was then a Japanese colony.
</P>
<P>
It was their first reunion in nearly 60 years as they had lost
contact for decades and did not get in touch against until three
years ago with the assistance of Lee's Japanese friends.
</P>
<P>
However, Lee was denied entry to Kyoto University last Friday. He
was turned away at the door because Beijing authorities have
pressured the Japanese government and Kyoto University not to allow
Lee to visit his alma mater. As a result, 10 Kyoto University
professors and doctors had to meet with Lee at a restaurant in
downtown Kyoto.
</P>
<P>
Lee told Taiwan reporters later that day that he did not feel
regret over his inability to enter the campus of his alma mater. "I
only feel that my alma mater became very strange to me, " he said
calmly while visiting Ginkakuji Temple that afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Lee said his trip has helped him come to a better understanding
of the Japanese way of thinking. He said Japan is an advanced and
orderly country from which Taiwan can learn much. Lee was accompanied
by his wife and other family members on his rare Japan trip.
</P>
<P>
Lee riled Beijing during his 12 years in office from 1988-2000
when he campaigned to raise Taiwan's international profile. He
redefined the island's ties with the mainland in 1999 as a "special
state-to-state" relationship, causing Beijing to break off
fence-mending talks which remain suspended to this day.
</P>
<P>
Japanese officials said Lee is visiting as a private citizen and
as such, had no basis for turning down his visa application.
</P>
<P>
Lee last traveled to Japan in April 2001, when he had treatment
for a heart condition.

BEIJING UNVEILS FORMULA FOR HOLIDAY CROSS-STRAIT CHARTER FLIGHTS
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Jan.  3 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mainland China has finally agreed to work
toward the opening of direct charter flights across the Taiwan Strait
during the upcoming Chinese Lunar New Year holiday for Taiwan
business people working in mainland China.
</P>
<P>
Beijing's official Xinhua news agency's online edition quoted the
spokesman of the Taiwan Affairs Office as saying late Sunday that
mainland authorities will do their utmost to open the special
cross-strait charter flight services under the formula of "joint
participation, multiple destinations, direct flights and two-way
passenger transport services."
</P>
<P>
For various reasons, the spokesman said, cross-strait
negotiations cannot resume at the moment. Nevertheless, the spokesman
suggested that air carriers from both sides be authorized to
negotiate technical details to pave the way for the special
cross-strait flight services during the lunar new year holiday.
</P>
<P>
"We believe our suggestion is pragmatic and feasible, " the
spokesman said, adding that Taiwan's elected representatives and
airline executives are welcome to travel to the mainland to discuss
the proposed charter flight services.
</P>
<P>
With Beijing's consent, six Taiwan carriers operated special
charter flights between Shanghai and Taipei/Kaohsiung via Hong
Kong/Macau during the 2003 Chinese Lunar New Year holiday. The
services were not offered the following year because Beijing insisted
that mainland carriers also be allowed to provide the same flight
services but refused to negotiate the necessary technical details
with Taiwan.

to the United States in 2002 for treatment of pyelotic cancer, during
which his right kidney, gallbladder and pancreas were removed. Koo's
cancer relapsed this passing October, forcing him to check into Cheng
Hsin Hospital where he received dialysis and was sometimes aided to
breath by a respirator.
</P>
<P>
Koo was appointed by the government to be the chairman of the
quasi-official Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) in March 1991.
</P>
<P>
Soon afterward the Beijing-based intermediary body, the
Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait (ARATS) , was set
up. Both the SEF and ARATS, thus, were established to handle
cross-strait exchanges in the absence of official ties.
</P>
<P>
Koo met with ARATS Chairman Wang Daohan in Singapore April 27-29,
1993, marking a landmark rendezvous of government-appointed
negotiators from Taiwan and mainland China after a five-decade hiatus
of relations across the Taiwan Strait.
</P>
<P>
Although the diplomatic tug-of-war between the two sides of the
Strait continued unabated, Koo traveled to the mainland April 14-19,
1998, where he met with mainland Chinese President Jiang Zemin, Vice
Premier Qian Qichen and his Beijing counterpart, Wang Daohan, for
talks.
</P>
<P>
This trip marked an attempt to break the ice that had formed
since 1995, when then-President Lee Teng-hui made a groundbreaking
trip to the United States, which Beijing considered to be a move to
promote Taiwan independence and consequently suspended all scheduled
interchange activities.
</P>
<P>
Official exchanges across the Taiwan Strait ended completely in
July 1999 when SEF and ARATS stopped talking to each other after
President Lee said that relations across the Strait ought to be
thought of as "state-to-state" in nature.
</P>
<P>
A senior adviser to President Lee, Koo was also Taiwan's top
envoy, taking part on occasion in the Asia-Pacific Economic
Cooperation forum's informal leadership summit on behalf of the
president.

naming of a new premier and the formation of a new Cabinet will be
moved ahead, a source from the Presidential Office said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Media reports said President Chen is scheduled to leave Taiwan

KOO CHEN-FU 'IRREPLACEABLE': FORMER MAC CHAIRWOMAN TSAI ING-WEN
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Jan. 3 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) Chairman
Koo Chen-fu was an important asset to the nation and will be hard to
replace, former Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) Chairwoman Tsai
Ing-wen said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Koo died of renal failure Monday morning at the age of 87. He
would have been 88 on Jan. 6.
</P>
<P>
Expressing her sympathies to Koo's family, Tsai said that Koo,
Taiwan's top negotiator with mainland China and a man who achieved
much in developing cross-strait relations, was "unprecedented and is
irreplaceable."
</P>
<P>
Koo, a business tycoon with an enviable family background and
skilled in various cultural activities, including writing poetry and
singing Chinese opera, was appointed by the government to be the
chairman of the quasi-official Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) in
March 1991.
</P>
<P>
Soon afterward the Beijing-based intermediary body, the
Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait (ARATS) , was set
up. Both the SEF and ARATS, thus, were established to handle
cross-strait exchanges in the absence of official ties.
</P>
<P>
Koo met with ARATS Chairman Wang Daohan in Singapore April 27-29,
1993, marking a landmark rendezvous of government-appointed
negotiators from Taiwan and mainland China after a five-decade hiatus
of relations across the Taiwan Strait.
</P>
<P>
Although the diplomatic tug-of-war between the two sides of the
Strait continued unabated, Koo traveled to the mainland April 14-19,
1998, where he met with mainland Chinese President Jiang Zemin, Vice
Premier Qian Qichen and his Beijing counterpart, Wang Daohan, for
talks.
</P>
<P>
Tsai, who was on Koo's 11-member team during that trip in her
capacity as an SEF adviser, said that it was really an "eye opener"
to watch how Koo dealt with the Beijing leadership and conducted the
groundbreaking talks with them.
</P>
<P>
The former top charter of mainland policy said that the last time
she met with Koo was prior to the Dec. 11 legislative elections for a
brief talk, during which Koo expressed grave concern over the
development of cross-strait relations. Tsai is now a legislator of
the ruling Democratic Progressive Party.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Kao Huei, director of the Institute of Mainland
Studies at Chinese Culture University, said that the passing of Koo
is tantamount to the death of the symbolic significance of
cross-strait relations, given that the two sides have been at a
complete political impasse since July 1999 after then-President Lee
Teng-hui said that relations across the Strait ought to be thought of
as "state-to-state" in nature.
</P>
<P>
Against this backdrop of such icy relations, cross-strait detente
would have come to nothing were it not for Koo and his Beijing
counterpart, ARATS Chairman Wang, and their tacit understanding of
each other, Kao said.
</P>
<P>
Also memorializing Koo was former MAC Chairman Su Chi, who said
that Koo was without parallel in cross-strait history.
</P>
<P>
Koo went to the United States in 2002 for treatment of pyelotic
cancer, during which his right kidney, gallbladder and pancreas were
removed. Koo's cancer relapsed this passed October, forcing him to
check into Cheng Hsin Hospital where he received dialysis and was
sometimes aided to breath by a respirator.

incumbent President Chen Shui-bian, Koo was also Taiwan's top envoy,
taking part on occasion in the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation
forum's informal leadership summit on behalf of the president.

DPP WHIP RECOMMENDS SOONG TO SUCCEED SEF CHAIRMAN KOO
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Jan.  3 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A legislator from the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) suggested Monday that opposition People First
Party (PFP) Chairman James Soong succeed Koo Chen-fu as chairman of
the quasi-official Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF).
</P>
<P>
Lee Chun-yi, a DPP party whip at the Legislative Yuan, said that
the DPP's condolences go out to Koo's wife and family. Koo died of
renal failure Monday morning.
</P>
<P>
Lee said that it is inappropriate right now to talk about the
details of choosing a successor to Koo, but he thinks that Soong
would be a suitable candidate given his widely known efforts in
actively championing cross-strait peace.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Lee said that the opening of the SEF chairmanship
offers a chance for parties from across Taiwan's political spectrum
to come together to talk about the succession issue since the SEF is
an intermediary arm governed and overseen by the government as well
as by the legislature.
</P>
<P>
Koo, who had been Taiwan's top negotiator with mainland China as
SEF chairman since March 1991, died of complications of kidney cancer
in Taipei at the age of 87. He would have been 88 on Jan. 6.
</P>
<P>
Soong was instrumental in the writing of a cross-strait "peace
safeguarding draft bill" aimed at securing peace across the Taiwan
Strait for the next 30 to 50 years, Lee said.
</P>
<P>
The bill envisaged by Soong and PFP lawmakers would be conducive
to facilitating cross-strait peace talks and helping secure a
breakthrough in the current cross-strait political stalemate, PFP
lawmakers said. The draft bill was submitted to the Legislative Yuan
late last year for discussion.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Chiu Tai-san, vice chairman of the Cabinet-level
Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) , which supervises the operations of
the SEF, said that Johnnason Liu, SEF vice chairman and
secretary-general, has been appointed as acting chairman.
</P>
<P>
Koo's successor will be determined at an opportune time after the
MAC consults with opinion leaders from various sections of society,
Chiu added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the SEF wrote the Beijing-based Association for
Relations Across the Taiwan Strait (ARATS) Monday to inform its
mainland counterpart about the death of Koo, Liu told the media.
</P>
<P>
The SEF will continue to spare no efforts to foster good
relations across the Taiwan Strait on the solid foundation that Koo
has laid, Liu added.

AIRLINES ASSOCIATION AUTHORIZED TO NEGOTIATE CHARTERS WITH CHINA
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Jan.  3 (CNA)
(By Y.F. Low)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) has
authorized the Taipei Airlines Association (TAA) to negotiate with
mainland China on the launch of cross-Taiwan Strait charter flights
during next month's Chinese Lunar New Year holiday, MAC Vice Chairman
Chiu Tai-san said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Chiu made the announcement after a spokesman of mainland China's
Taiwan Affairs Office said in an interview with the Xinhua News
Agency on Sunday that Beijing would facilitate the charter services
in light of the transportation needs of Taiwanese business people in
mainland China.
</P>
<P>
The unnamed Chinese official proposed that airlines from both
sides consult each other directly on the technical and operational
details concerning the services.
</P>
<P>
Chiu said the TAA has been charged with the mission of
coordinating with the six Taiwanese airliners so that they can file
their applications for operating the charter services with Beijing in
a proper way and at an appropriate time.
</P>
<P>
Chiu urged Beijing authorities to finalize the flight schedules
soon to make it more convenient for Taiwanese businesses to arrange
their trips during the holiday.
</P>
<P>
Chiu said the government is sincere in promoting the charter
services and would be happy to negotiate with mainland China on its
requests for "joint participation, direct flights and two-way
passenger transport services."
</P>
<P>
With Beijing's consent, six Taiwanese airliners operated charter
flights between Shanghai and Taipei/Kaohsiung via Hong Kong/Macau
during the 2003 Chinese Lunar New Year holiday. The services were not
offered the following year because Beijing insisted that Chinese
carriers also be allowed to join the services but refused to
negotiate the necessary technical details with Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Chiu said the Ministry of Economic Affairs is
accepting applications from Taiwanese business people with operations
in mainland China to travel between the two sides during the holiday
via the ferry services between the outlying islands of Kinmen/Matsu
and mainland China's Xiamen/Fuzhou, known generally as the "mini
three-links."
</P>
<P>
Also, the Ministry of Transportation and Communications will
coordinate with related airlines to arrange for the launch of extra
flights to transport Taiwanese business people in mainland China's
Guangdong area who travel by ship to Hong Kong for a flight back to
Taiwan during the holiday, Chiu added.

DEFENSE MINISTRY CONSIDERING WHETHER TO MOTHBALL SOME JET FIGHTERS
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Jan.  3 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Ministry of National Defense has been
considering whether to mothball some of the nation's jet fighters for
assorted reasons, although the plan is still in the pipeline, Vice
Minister of National Defense Tsai Ming-hsien said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Tsai said that the defense ministry has talked with the French
aircraft manufacturer Dassault Aviation, which has sold 60
Mirage-2000s to Taiwan over the past decade, about having some of
them mothballed for a number of reasons, including Taiwan's climate
and environment, which are harmful to cutting-edge jet fighters due
to the high humidity and high concentration of salt in the air, the
high maintenance costs, and a defense budget that has been falling
yearly.
</P>
<P>
Mothballing the Mirage-2000s would help lengthen the life
expectancy of the French-made jet fighters and would help reduce
maintenance costs, Tsai said.
</P>
<P>
The mothballing would not affect Taiwan's air defense capability,
even if in the event of a military invasion, Tsai said, adding that
many countries in the world, including the United States, keep jet
fighters and war ships in storage.
</P>
<P>
Tsai made the remarks during an interpellation session at the
Legislative Yuan, where opposition legislators asked him for an
explanation about a news report saying that some of the country's jet
fighters are to be mothballed, including the Mirage-2000s and some
IDFs.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Tsai noted that the air, army and navy branches of the
ROC military are on stand-by to dispatch their personnel and supplies
to tsunami- and earthquake-affected countries in South Asia based on
humanitarian needs.
</P>
<P>
Currently, the navy is readying a 8,400-ton transport frigate,
while the air force is preparing six crews and seven C-130 transport
planes, and the army is gathering emergency and relief supplies,
including sterilization materials and equipment, as well as power
generators, Tsai noted.
</P>
<P>
He said that the military personnel and supplies will be ready to
go whenever the Ministry of Foreign Affairs reaches a consensus with
the governments of the South Asian countries on what is needed.

'MINI LINKS' BETWEEN KINMEN, XIAMEN INCREASINGLY POPULAR: NPA
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei, Jan. 3 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The direct trade and transport links between
the Taiwan-held island of Kinmen and Xiamen City in mainland China's
Fujian Province are becoming more and more popular, evidenced in the
record number of passengers who used the service to travel between
Taiwan and the mainland last year, according to government tallies.
</P>
<P>
Statistics compiled by the Bureau of Immigration under the
National Police Administration (NPA) show that a total of 404,363
people -- 203,164 outbound and 201,199 inbound -- sailed between the
two sides in 2004, a more-than 1.5-fold growth compared to the 2003
level of 160,103.
</P>
<P>
In 2002, a total of 53,681 travelers made voyages via the links,
up from 21,377 in 2001, when the "three mini links" were initiated on
the first of that year to compensate for the lack of such links
between Taiwan proper and the mainland due to political rifts between
the two sides.
</P>
<P>
Bureau officials on Kinmen attributed the increase to various
government policy openings that have allowed a broader range of
people to travel via the links.
</P>
<P>
The establishment of the links were first aimed at facilitating
homebound trips for Taiwan businessmen based in Fujian, and the links
were made available to other Taiwan businessmen operating farther
afield than Fujian since March last year, they explained
</P>
<P>
The links were also opened to Taiwan residents with household
registration on Kinmen of over six months and to family members of
retired serviceman and Taiwan citizens' spouses from Fujian, they
said, adding that more than 70 percent of the "mini links" passengers
are Taiwan businessmen.
</P>
<P>
The Fujian authorities' decision late last month to permit Fujian
residents to travel to Kinmen and Matsu islands via the links for
tourism provided a fresh boost to the links, with shippers highly
optimistic about a marked jump in traveler numbers and planning to
increase two-way voyages from the current eight per day to 12,
according to the officials.
</P>
<P>
Political relations between Taiwan and mainland China remain
deadlocked since 1949, when the Kuomintang retreated to Taiwan after
losing a civil war to the Chinese communists in the mainland.
Contacts between the governments on the two sides of the Taiwan
Strait have been absent until now.

progress of Taiwan for more than half a century and played a key role
in Taiwan's economic development, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
He also attended major diplomatic events overseas on behalf of
the head of state to help the country promote its foreign affairs,
and committed himself to promoting cross-Taiwan Strait peace,
stability and development, it added.
</P>
<P>
Chen later visited a mourning hall set up for Koo in the Taiwan
Cement Corp. building in Taipei to pay his last respects.
</P>
<P>
Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng said he regrets the loss
of a great contributor to cross-strait relations.
</P>
<P>
Praising Koo as a gentle, learned and generous man, opposition
Kuomintang Chairman Lien Chan said Koo's status in cross-strait
relations is irreplaceable.
</P>
<P>
Opposition People First Party Chairman James Soong, who is on a
visit overseas, expressed through his aides his deepest mourning and
sadness on hearing of Koo's death.
</P>
<P>
Soong said Koo should get much of the credit for the success of
the landmark talks between him and his mainland Chinese counterpart,
Wang Daohan of the Association for Relations Across the Taiwan
Strait, in Singapore in 1993.

PREMIER TIGHTLIPPED ON CABINET RESHUFFLE
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Jan. 3 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Premier Yu Shyi-kun said Monday that a date
for the resignation of the entire Cabinet has yet to be determined.
</P>
<P>
Yu was responding to media reports that the planned Cabinet
reshuffle will come ahead of schedule because of President Chen
Shui-bian's overseas travel plans.
</P>
<P>
According the reports, Chen is scheduled to leave Taipei Jan. 28
for official visits to the Republic of China's diplomatic allies in
the South Pacific, including Palau, the Marshall Islands and the
Solomon Islands. As the visit will last for 12 days, the reports said
Chen will not return until to Taipei until Chinese Lunar New Year's
Eve Feb. 8
</P>
<P>
Yu said he is still not aware of the president's travel plans but
he reiterated that he and his Cabinet will resign after the current
legislative session concludes Jan. 21.
</P>
<P>
As for the exact date, Yu said, the Central Personnel
Administration is still mulling the issue and has yet to make a final
decision.
</P>
<P>
In the past, Cabinet members have usually tendered their
resignations en masse at one of the Cabinet's weekly meetings. The
last weekly Cabinet meeting before the inauguration of the new
Legislative Yuan Feb. 1 is scheduled for Jan. 26. Cabinet sources
said the Cabinet is also likely to call a provisional meeting in
advance to facilitate its resignation.
</P>
<P>
Asked about his views on widespread speculation that Kaohsiung
Mayor Frank Hsieh is likely to succeed Yu as premier, Yu said Hsieh
is erudite, competent and experienced enough to assume any government
post.
</P>
<P>
"I would congratulate him no matter which post he is assigned to
but I'm not in a position to make any comment on the choice of a new
premier because the power to appoint the premier rests with the
president," Yu added.
</P>
<P>
In the southern port city of Kaohsiung, Hsieh said that to the
best of his understanding, Chen has so far not made a definite
choice. He added that Chen is expected to determine who the next
premier will be before Feb. 1.
</P>
<P>
Hsieh canceled his originally scheduled meeting with the
Kaohsiung and Pingtung county magistrates that morning and instead
flew to Taipei to attend a high-level meeting presided over by Chen.
</P>
<P>
Hsieh said the meeting focused on Taiwan's future political
developments. As reporters repeatedly asked Hsieh about the
possibility of him serving as the next premier, Hsieh finally said
many variables could affect the choice of premier at the moment. "To
talk about such a sensitive issue would only enhance embarrassment, "
he added.

The number of mental institutions in Taiwan
had increased to 339 as of the end of September 2004, up 45 from the
year-earlier level, according to a report released Monday by the
Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics (DGBAS).

The government has continued to funnel national resources and
offer incentives to encourage the private sector to expand mental
hospital wards in order to upgrade the medical facilities for mental

There were a total of 27,000 hospital beds for mental patients as
of the end of September 2004, up 7.5 percent over the same period of
2003, it said.

EXECUTIVE YUAN SPOKESMAN LAUDS LATE SEF CHIEF AS NATIONAL ASSET

<TEXT>
<P>
Koo Cheng-fu, the chairman of the Straits
Exchange Foundation (SEF) who died Monday, was a valuable asset for
the country and his death is an irreplaceable loss for the Taiwan
people, Executive Yuan spokesman Chen Chi-mai said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Chen Chi-mai said business tycoon Koo, who had headed the SEF in
its dealings with Beijing on behalf of the government since 1990, was
still worrying about the tension between Taiwan and mainland China
even in his final days of a long illness, which Chen said is
especially admirable.
</P>
<P>
He lauded Koo for leading Taiwan's historic ice-breaking journey
to Singapore in April, 1993 to meet with Beijing's chief negotiator
with Taiwan, Wang Daohan and concluded four agreements with him.
</P>
<P>
Chen said that trip ended half-a-century of severance of all
contacts between Taiwan and the mainland and opened a new page in
bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
Koo visited the mainland in October 1998 and met with Beijing's
then-President Jiang Zemin, as well as Wang, improving the ties
between Taiwan and the mainland, Chen said.
</P>
<P>
In addition to being a successful businessman, Koo also served as
head of the Chinese National Federation of Industries and of the
Chinese National Association of Industry &amp; Commerce, and contributed
greatly to the country's economic development, Chen went on.
</P>
<P>
He also acted as the country's envoy to the informal summit of
the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation forum from 1995 to 1997.
</P>
<P>
Koo died of renal failure in a local hospital at the age of 88,
according to his family.

REFORM PROGRAM AIMED AT GLOBALIZATION, NOT DE-SINICIZATION: PREMIER
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  Jan.  3 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)

<TEXT>
<P>
Premier Yu Shyi-kun said Monday that the
government's decision to reform the format of official documents is
aimed at facilitating globalization, not at de-sinicization.
</P>
<P>
Yu made the remarks while presiding over a ceremony marking the
launch of a new style of official documents and government gazettes.
</P>
<P>
From now on, Yu said, text in official documents will run from
left to right horizontally instead of the traditional style in which
the Chinese characters run from right to left and from top to bottom.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the new format complies with the general world
trend and said the move has nothing to do with de-sinicization.
</P>
<P>
Whether official documents should adopt the horizontal style
caused heated debate more than three decades ago. At that time, Yu
said, the then-Kuomintang administration decided to stick to the
traditional vertical right-to-left style mainly because mainland
China had adopted the horizontal left-to-right text style.
</P>
<P>
Nowadays, Yu went on, such an argument is no longer justifiable.
In the face of ever-growing global competition, he said, the
government has to implement various reform programs to upgrade
operational efficiency and overall national competitiveness.
</P>
<P>
Starting this year, all government notices have also been
integrated and posted on the Internet for local citizens to collect
first-hand information about government policies regardless of
whether they are at home or abroad.

<TEXT>
<P>
President Chen Shui-bian held a meeting with
high-level officials Monday to exchange views with them on some
points in his New Year's message, but did not talk about the lineup
of the new Cabinet, a Presidential Office spokesman said later that
day.
</P>
<P>
Chen Wen-tzung, director of the Department of Public Affairs
under the Presidential Office, made the remarks after the president
met with Vice President Annette Lu, Premier Yu Shyi-kun, Presidential
Office Secretary-General Su Tseng-chang, Kaohsiung Mayor Frank Hsieh,
ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) Secretary-General Chang
Chun-hsiung and DPP caucus whip Ker Chien-ming at the Presidential
Office.
</P>
<P>
Yu is expected to lead his Cabinet to resign before the current
legislature ends Jan. 21. According to the Constitution, the
president will appoint a premier and a new Cabinet will then be
formed.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that the president exchanged views with the
officials on how to promote cooperation and coordination between the
ruling and the opposition parties on policies and bills that the
public are concerned about, a topic he raised in his New Year's
address.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman stressed that the meeting also discussed how to
carry out the "four ifs" in his New Year's address. The president
said Jan. 1 that if something benefits the stability of domestic
politics, the welfare of the people, harmony among ethnic groups, and
cross-strait peace, it can be open to reconciliation or cooperation
between the governing and opposition parties.
</P>
<P>
Since the meeting, the president has begun to think about how to
engage in dialogue between political leaders and how to learn from
the experience of cooperation between political parties, with the
hope of promoting cooperation with the opposition and stabilizing the
domestic political situation, the spokesman added.

FORMER PRESIDENT PERSUADES HOPEFUL TO DROP OUT OF TSU CHAIRMAN RACE
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei, Jan. 3 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Lee Teng-hui, former president and so-called
"spiritual leader" of the opposition Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU) ,
has persuaded an aspirant for the TSU chairmanship to drop out of the
by-election race, acting TSU Chairman Huang Tzung-yuan said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Huang made the remarks after meeting with the former president to
report to him that three hopefuls -- Su Chin-chiang,
secretary-general of the National Cultural Association, TSU
Legislator Lo Chih-ming and at-large Legislator Kuo Lin-yung -- had
registered to vie for the party chairmanship.
</P>
<P>
The by-election became necessary after Huang Chu-wen stepped down
to take responsibility for the party's worse-than-expected
performance in the Dec. 11 legislative elections. The TSU garnered
only 12 out of the 225 legislative seats, one less than it got in the
previous elections.
</P>
<P>
The TSU had originally planned to hold a drawing for the three
aspirants Monday, but the party's central executive committee formed
a seven-member screening team that day and decided to hold a meeting
Friday. The draw will have to wait for the result of the screening
next Monday.
</P>
<P>
TSU Acting Secretary-General Chen Chien-ming said the party
will communicate with the three hopefuls individually, hoping that
there will be mutual respect and harmony during the process, although
it is still hoped that there will be only one candidate.
</P>
<P>
Huang noted that Lee had called Lo to ask him to withdraw from
the race, saying that he should support Su in consideration of
party unity.
</P>
<P>
As for Kuo, since he was nominated by the former party chairman,
the latter should resolve that question, Huang said.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that those who won the Dec. 11 legislative elections
know very well that they were elected because of the full support of
the former president.
</P>
<P>
"Since Lee is in favor of Su's taking over the chairmanship, the
legislators should accept his choice," he added.

TAIWAN MEDICAL TEAM TO WITHDRAW FROM INDONESIA OVER SAFETY FEARS
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Singapore,  Jan.  3 (CNA)
(By Charles Kang and Y.F. Low)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A medical team dispatched by Taiwan to
Indonesia in the aftermath of the Dec. 26 tsunami disaster has
decided to pull out because of Jakarta's failure to guarantee the
safety of the team members, sources said Monday.
</P>
<P>
While most of the team members have been ordered by Taipei to
leave Indonesia, a few will stay until 1.5 tonnes of medical supplies
arrive and handed over to the Taiwan-based Tzu Chi Foundation charity
group in Indonesia, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
The date of the pullout will be known Tuesday at the earliest
after the team contacts the foundation, they said.
</P>
<P>
Although Taiwan is most willing to provide Indonesia with medical
services and help with the prevention of outbreaks of infectious
diseases, Taipei has to made the decision to bring its people out as
the Indonesian government cannot assure the physical safety of Taiwan
medical workers posted in Aceh Province -- the worst-hit area -- and
cannot offer them protection from attack by rebels, they said.
</P>
<P>
According to some team members, the Tzu Chi Foundation is
currently the only organization with the ability to coordinate with
the Indonesian military to transport relief supplies to the disaster
areas in Aceh.
</P>
<P>
Experts from Taiwan's Center for Disease Control said diseases
such as typhoid, dysentery, cholera, malaria and dengue fever could
break out at any time in light of the bad sanitary conditions in Aceh
after the disaster.
</P>
<P>
More than 90,000 people in Indonesia, mostly in Aceh, have been
confirmed killed by the tsunami that were triggered by a
9.0-magnitude earthquake off the west coast of Sumatra Dec. 26.
</P>

The Taiwan medical team arrived in Indonesia last Thursday.

PROPER POLICY NEEDED TO BREAK CROSS-STRAIT DEADLOCK: LEGISLATIVE HEAD
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Jan.  3 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An adequate policy must be crafted to
improve deadlocked ties between Taiwan and mainland China, an issue
more important than the question of who might serve as the key
negotiator, Legislative Yuan President Wang Jin-pyng said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Claiming that a well forged policy is much more important then
the person chosen to deal with Taiwan's sensitive relations with the
mainland, Wang said that it would be all the same regardless of who
might head the Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) if Taiwan lacks an
adequate policy to create a favorable climate for reopening
negotiations with the other side of the Taiwan Strait.
</P>
<P>
Should it be possible to commission a legislative task force to
hold talks with the mainland, the ad hoc group, no matter who leads
it, must be capable of serving the country's needs, gaining the
people's consent, acquiring the legislature's approval and conducting
negotiations with the mainland on an equal footing, he said.
</P>
<P>
According to Wang, the Legislative Yuan is in a more flexible
position to engage with the mainland than the executive branch.
</P>
<P>
If a cross-strait peace draft proposed by the opposition People
First Party (PFP) clears the legislature and a task force is set up,
it will provide the Legislative Yuan with a legal framework to carry
out bilateral exchanges and there will be ample room for such a
legislative team to play a prominent role in cross-strait relations,
he added.
</P>
<P>
Wang made the remarks in a meeting with local reporters after SEF
Chairman C.F. Koo, Taiwan's chief negotiator with mainland China,
died of renal cancer earlier the same day.
</P>
<P>
The semi-official SEF was set up in 1991 to handle cross-strait
exchanges in the absence of contacts between the governments on the
two sides. Headed by Wang Daohan, the Beijing-based Association of
Relations Across the Taiwan Strait (ARATS) is its mainland
counterpart.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the options for the SEF chairmanship, he said that
opposition People First Party (PFP) Chairman James Soong would be the
right person as long as Soong himself is willing.
</P>
<P>
Like the ruling party, the opposition camp also has a
responsibility to help the administration stabilize the cross-strait
situation that has turned sour in recent months, he said, adding that
most of the opposition Kuomintang (KMT) members would also be happy
to see Soong take over the SEF chairmanship.
</P>
<P>
Wang is one of the six vice chairmen of the KMT. The "pan blue"
alliance of the KMT and the PFP have succeeded in retaining a
majority at the 225-member Legislative Yuan after the Dec. 11 general
elections.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the ARATS sent a message to the SEF to express its
condolences over Koo's death. It also called for an early resumption
of the systematic negotiations between the two sides based upon the
consensus reached in 1992.
</P>
<P>
Koo and Wang met for the first time in 1993 in Singapore, marking
the first contact between Taiwan and mainland China in nearly 50
years after the two sides split in 1949 following a civil war.

SENIOR SINGAPOREAN OFFICIALS MOURN SEF CHAIRMAN'S DEATH
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Jan.  3 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two former Singaporean prime ministers --
Lee Kuan Yew and Goh Chok Tong -- have sent condolence letters to
the family of Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) Chairman Koo Chen-fu,
who died of renal failure early Monday at the age of 88.
</P>
<P>
In a condolence letter to Koo's wife, Lee, who is now minister
mentor of Singapore, praised Koo for his "balanced and realistic
appraisal" of the cross-Taiwan Strait situation.
</P>
<P>
Lee further said Koo played a valuable role in helping to
stabilize cross-strait relations.
</P>
<P>
As Taiwan's top negotiator with mainland China, Koo held a
landmark meeting with his mainland counterpart, Wang Daohan,
president of the Beijing-based Association for Relations Across the
Taiwan Strait (ARATS), in Singapore in April 1993, marking the first
high-level cross-strait rendezvous since 1949.
</P>
<P>
Goh, who is now Singapore's senior minister, said in his
condolence letter to Koo's wife that he was deeply saddened to learn
of Koo's passing.
</P>
<P>
He recalled that he got to know Koo through various meetings of
the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum. Known for his
diplomatic acumen, Koo attended the annual APEC summit meeting on
behalf of former ROC President Lee Teng-hui on three occasions.
</P>
<P>
"We used to sit next to one another I know him to be upright,
sincere and thoughtful gentleman who cared for his friends. I also
know he cared deeply about cross-strait peace and stability," Goh
said in the letter.
</P>
<P>
Goh said Koo will be remembered for his contributions. For many
years, he said, Koo played a significant role in bringing both sides
of the Taiwan Strait together. "Unfortunately, circumstances did not
allow him to do more," Goh added.
</P>
<P>
Koo died at Taipei's Cheng Hsin Medical Center, where he had been
treated since October for complications from kidney cancer, doctors
at the hospital said.
</P>
<P>
In 1991, Koo became SEF chairman when the quasi-official
organization was set up to handle Taiwan's prickly relations with
Beijing. He also led a proud and prosperous extended business family,
the Koo's Group, which includes banking, cement, petrochemicals and
television.
</P>
<P>
Besides the 1993 Koo-Wang meeting in Singapore, Koo also made an
ice-breaking visit to Shanghai and Beijing in 1998. During that trip,
he met with then-mainland Chinese President Jiang Zemin and then-Vice
Premier Qian Qichen.
</P>
<P>
Since that trip, long-standing political squabbles over Taiwan's
status have blocked follow-up cross-strait discussions.
</P>
<P>
Koo was well versed in Chinese poetry, literature and arts.
Although he suffered from kidney problems and other ailments, the
diplomat, banker and industrialist kept his job as Taiwan's top
negotiator with the mainland even after Chen Shui-bian, a former
opposition leader, was elected president in 2000.

KMT TO HELP ARRANGE CROSS-TAIWAN STRAIT CHARTER SERVICE
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Jan. 3 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) will
send a delegation to mainland China this week to help the private
sector arrange direct charter flights across the Taiwan Strait for
mainland-based Taiwan businessmen wishing to spend the coming lunar
new year holiday at home, a KMT official said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Tseng Yung-chuan, executive-general of the KMT's Central Policy
Committee, made the remarks after learning that the Cabinet-level
Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) has authorized the Taipei Airlines
Association (TTA) to hold technical talks with the mainland to pave
the way for cross-strait charter services for homecoming Taiwan
businessmen during the holiday period.
</P>
<P>
The MAC move came after a Beijing official said earlier the same
day that the mainland is willing to cooperate on the issue under the
condition that the round-trip flights be conducted by carriers from
both sides without a stop in a third country or area. MAC Vice
Chairman Chiu Tai-san responded that Taiwan would be happy to talk
with the mainland under that condition.
</P>
<P>
The charter service plan would very possibly fail if the
government were to insist that negotiations must be government-level,
Tseng warned, adding that it must be held accountable should that
happen.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Taiwan carriers displayed their willingness to provide
the services in line with government policy and pointed out that
non-stop two-way flights will help reduce costs and that they will
file their applications to offer the services as soon as related
details are worked out.
</P>
<P>
However, they also expressed worry that it is already too late to
start arranging the special flights, as many Taiwan businessmen and
their families have already bought tickets for their new year
homecoming at the beginning of February.

<P>
A spokesman for the Ministry of Foreign
Affairs urged the international community Monday not to exclude
Taiwan from any international conferences organized to coordinate
relief efforts in South Asia in the wake of the Dec. 26 earthquake
and subsequent tsunami.
</P>
<P>
Michel Lu said Taiwan has promised to provide considerable aid to
countries ravaged by the 9.0-magnitude earthquake in Indonesia and
the ensuing tsunami and thereby should not be excluded from any
international relief conferences for political reasons.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks after wire services reported that a relief
meeting sponsored by the Association of Southeast Asian Nations
(ASEAN) will be held Thursday in Jakarta.
</P>
<P>
In addition to ASEAN leaders, the conference will also bring
together leaders from Japan, Australia and mainland China, as well as
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan and U.S. Secretary of State Colin
Powell.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. will hold another meeting in Geneva Jan. 11 of countries
that have donated money and provided relief to the disaster areas.
</P>
<P>
Lu said Taiwan has not yet been invited to either of the two
meetings but was trying to get the chances to take part in them
through its overseas representative offices.
</P>
<P>
The Executive Yuan decided the previous day to raise its donation
from its original promise of US$5 million to US$50 million.
Vice Foreign Minister Michael Ying-mao Kau said that figure would

</P>
<P>
Chen said the president huddled with top officials from his
administration and the ruling DPP in his office to study the way to
follow through his promises of replacing confrontation between the
DPP and the opposition parties with dialogue and reconciliation in
his second term.
</P>
<P>
The consensus that emerged from the meeting is that the dialogue
should be conducted regularly by the DPP with the opposition, Chen
Chien-ming said.
</P>
<P>
The Taiwan Solidarity Union, the DPP's political ally in the
Legislature Yuan, welcomed the decision and said they will support
the president's idea.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Chang Hsien-yao, an official from the opposition People
First Party, said his party believes party-to-party dialogue is the
right way for democracy but it seemed that the president hasn't yet
come up with any concrete plan to carry out the promises he made
in his New Year address thus far, except for empty words.

U.S. REP. CONCERN OVER STATE DEPT. REACTION TO 'ANTI-SECESSION LAW'
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Washington, Jan. 3 (CNA)
(By Oliver Lin and P. C. Tang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A member of the U.S. House of
Representatives has sent a letter to a senior official of the State
Department to express his concern over the department's weak reaction
to mainland China's proposed anti-secession law that might lead to a
unilateral change of the status quo in the Taiwan Strait.
</P>
<P>
Rep. Tom Tancredo (R-Colorado) , who sent the letter Dec. 23 to
Paul Kelly, assistant secretary for legislative affairs, has been the
first U.S. congressman to openly voice his strong opposition to the
"anti-secession law" that mainland China hopes to enact.
</P>
<P>
Expressing his concern over the State Department's failure to
adequately condemn Beijing for threatening to unilaterally change the
status quo by possibly enacting such a law, Tancredo said in his
letter: "Despite Beijing's assertions that the law is designed to
foster "peaceful reunification, " I believe it is clear to even the
most casual observer that this move is little more than a thinly
veiled attempt by Beijing to create a 'legal framework' for starting
a war with Taiwan."
</P>
<P>
Noting that Beijing's efforts to enact such a law is "a
clear-cut, belligerent, provocative and dangerous step toward a
military attack of a peaceful and democratic ally of the United
States," the representative said with great regret that the strongest
and most direct rebuke to Beijing that Richard Boucher, spokesmen of
the department, could muster in response to the move was that "...we
think it's important for both sides to focus on dialogue."
</P>
<P>
"I wonder, would the State Department response have been as timid
were the shoe on the other foot with the Legislative Yuan in Taipei
debating the enactment an 'anti-annexation' law," he further said.
</P>
<P>
Tancredo also said that he would like to know what Beijing must
do in order to draw the kind of strong public rebuke the state
department has grown accustomed to delivering to Taipei.
</P>
<P>
"Beijing's routine and public threats to use military force
against Taiwan clearly haven't drawn such a rebuke, neither has the
PRC's deployment of 600 missiles pointed directly at Taiwan's 23
million residents. "
</P>
<P>
"Is it that Mr. Boucher, Mr. Ereli [Adam Ereli, State Department
deputy spokesman] and others are waiting for the PRC to actually
attack Taiwan before they issue a stern warning," Tancredo asked.

PRESIDENT CHEN TO VISIT SOUTH PACIFIC ALLIES: FOREIGN MINISTER
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Jan.  4 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President Chen Shui-bian will visit the
Republic of China's diplomatic allies in the South Pacific later this
month if all goes smoothly, Minister of Foreign Affairs Tan Sun Chen
said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
According to media reports, President Chen is scheduled to leave
Taipei Jan. 28 to attend the new Palau president's inauguration and
visit the ROC's other allies in the region.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister said President Chen's itinerary has yet to
be finalized.
</P>
<P>
"We are still negotiating technical details with relevant
authorities and President Chen's travel schedule has yet to be set, "
the minister said, adding that if all goes well, the president is
likely to start his South Pacific journey in late January.
</P>
<P>
It will be President Chen's first trip to the South Pacific since
he assumed the presidency in May 2000.
</P>
<P>
The ROC has five diplomatic allies in the South Pacific,
namely: Palau, the Solomon Islands, the Marshall Islands, Kiribati
and Tuvalu.
</P>
<P>
Asked if President Chen would visit all of the five South Pacific
allies, the foreign minister said: "Of course, if it is feasible."
</P>
<P>
Some technical issues must be evaluated and resolved before the
president's travel itinerary can be drawn up, Minister Chen said,
adding that airport facilities in some countries may not be suitable
for landing and takeoff of large commercial aircraft.
</P>
<P>
Chen Wen-tzung, director of the Department of Public Affairs of
the Presidential Office, said a day earlier that a team from the
Presidential Office has traveled to the countries in the South
Pacific to pave the way for the president's visit. The president's
travel schedule will be announced after all preparations are
complete, he said.

'PARTY-TO-PARTY CONSULTATIONS BETTER THAN NOTHING': WANG JIN-PYNG
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Jan. 4 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng said
Tuesday that party-to-party consultation will definitely contribute
to political stability.
</P>
<P>
Wang, who concurrently serves as a Kuomintang (KMT) vice
chairman, was referring to an olive branch for party reconciliation
offered by President Chen Shui-bian in his new year's address for the
sake of political stability.
</P>
<P>
After the Dec. 11 legislative elections, the opposition "pan-blue
alliance" of the KMT and the People First Party (PFP) maintained a
majority in the 225-seat Legislative Yuan.
</P>
<P>
"Party-to-party consultations are better than nothing, " Wang
said.
</P>
<P>
However, he also said that whether the atmosphere for holding
such talks can be created will hinge on if the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) is sincere.
</P>
<P>
The DPP legislative caucus offered Tuesday to cooperate with all
other political parties, but the opposition "pan-blue alliance"
quickly dismissed it as an attempt to split the alliance.
</P>
<P>
Ker Chien-ming, acting DPP chairman and party whip in the
legislature, said that the DPP can discuss issues with any party,
including such topics as specific governmental appointments.
</P>
<P>
Ker said that for the sake of political stability, the DPP will
not only consult with the PFP, it will also consult with the KMT, the
Taiwan Solidarity Union and even the Non-Partisan Solidarity Union
because party-to-party consultations as envisaged by President Chen
are just beginning to take shape.
</P>
<P>
On the KMT's part, Huang Teh-fu, KMT caucus whip in the
legislature, said that President Chen shouldn't dictate to the party
and the administration, saying that there already exists a
consultation mechanism in the legislature and there is no need to
establish another channel.
</P>
<P>
PFP Legislator Liu Wen-hsiung said that cooperation between the
ruling and opposition parties will depend on which policies and
issues are at stake, and that there is no specific need for
party-to-party consultations.
</P>
<P>
If the DPP is unwilling to give up Taiwan independence in its
party charter, then it is out of the question for the PFP to be a part
of a DPP coalition Cabinet, Liu said.
</P>
<P>
He was referring to media reports that high-ranking officials in
the Presidential Office will let someone from the PFP serve as vice
premier to display the DPP's sincerity in seeking reconciliation
between the ruling and the opposition parties.
</P>
<P>
Liu urged the DPP to refrain from making frivolous remarks,
referring to reports Monday that at least one DPP official had
recommended PFP Chairman James Soong as being a suitable candidate to
take over as chairman of the quasi-official Straits Exchange
Foundation. The previous head of the organization that deals with
mainland China affairs died Monday.
</P>
<P>
Liu said that Soong told him that he had dismissed the idea as
"pure nonsense."

KOO-WANG TALKS CREATED VISION OF CROSS-STRAIT PEACE: VP LU
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Jan.  4 (CNA)
(By Y.F. Low)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The landmark talks between Taipei and
Beijing led by the late Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) Chairman
Koo Chen-fu and his Beijing counterpart, Wang Daohan, in 1993 gave
birth to a "vision of peace" across the Taiwan Strait, Vice President
Annette Lu said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Lu said the vision, which has yet to become a reality, will
depend on a new generation of leadership on both sides of the Strait
to come up with a new way of thinking.
</P>
<P>
The vice president made the comments while paying her last
respects to Koo, who died of renal failure a day earlier, three days
before his 88th birthday.
</P>
<P>
Saying the historic Koo-Wang talks were one of the most
remarkable achievements Koo made during his lifetime, Lu expressed
the hope that cross-strait peace can be achieved under the leadership
of President Chen Shui-bian.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, former SEF Vice Chairman and Secretary-General Chiao
Jen-ho said the Koo family is planning to hold a memorial service for
Koo in late January or early February.
</P>
<P>
Chiao said the date for his funeral has yet to be decided and
that the family hopes to have a simple ceremony.

PRESIDENT HOLDS CLOSED-DOOR MEETING WITH LEE TENG-HUI
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei, Jan. 4 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President Chen Shui-bian spoke privately for
over two hours with former President Lee Teng-hui at the Presidential
Office Tuesday in their first meeting following Lee's return from his
recent sightseeing trip to Japan.
</P>
<P>
Su Tseng-chang, the president's chief of staff, said Chen invited
Lee to the Presidential Office. Su said Lee also ate lunch with the
president.
</P>
<P>
However, Su would not divulge any details about what was said
during the meeting. Su was speaking at the headquarters of the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) during a weekly meeting of senior
party officials.
</P>
<P>
Presidential Office sources said Chen and Lee exchanged views on
the domestic political situation and Lee's just-concluded visit to
Japan.
</P>
<P>
Some have speculated that the upcoming Cabinet reshuffle was
touched upon by the two.
</P>
<P>
In line with constitutional precedent, Premier Yu Shyi-kun and
all Cabinet members are expected to resign en masse after the current
Legislative Yuan concludes its final session on Jan. 21. Rumors have
circulated for the last couple of weeks about the possibility of Chen
naming a new premier and forming a coalition Cabinet with opposition
parties. Senior government officials, including Yu himself, have been
tightlipped about the imminent Cabinet reshuffle.
</P>
<P>
It remains unclear whether Lee, who is the spiritual leader of
the Taiwan Solidarity Union -- a DPP ally - has made recommendations
regarding the makeup of the new Cabinet.
</P>
<P>
Upon his return from Japan Sunday, Lee told a large crowd of
supporters who turned up at Chiang Kai-shek International Airport to
greet him that his Japan visit, in spite of Beijing's opposition,
shows that relations between Taipei and Tokyo are close.
</P>
<P>
Despite Beijing's opposition, Lee said most Japanese people
welcomed his visit. Noting that Taiwan-Japanese relations have been
advancing quietly, Lee said bilateral ties are now in the best shape
since the two countries severed formal diplomatic relations in 1972.
</P>
<P>
Prior to his departure for home, Lee told Japanese reporters that
his trip could be viewed as successful. "I was able to serve as a
quiet yet firm link between both sides, " he said while thanking the
Japanese government and people for their warmth and hospitality.
</P>
<P>
During his seven-day visit, Lee, 81, met with 98-year-old
Sukekata Kashiwa, who was Lee's professor when Lee studied at the
agroeconomics department of Kyoto University in the early 1940s.
Taiwan was then a Japanese colony.
</P>
<P>
However, Lee was denied entry to Kyoto University last Friday. He
was turned away at the door because Beijing authorities pressured the
Japanese government and Kyoto University not to allow Lee to visit
his alma mater.

The Times: British death toll soars as Thais
call off search.

The number of Britons feared killed by the Asian tsunami
finally emerged last night as the Government disclosed that
199 people, including about 25 children, were probably dead. 

Most British victims of the enormous wave that crashed
into beach resorts nine days ago died in Thailand. 

But any lingering hopes of the bodies of those still missing
there being recovered were dashed last night when the authorities
announced that they were calling off the search for those
unaccounted for. 



Financial Times: Aid groups given freer hand to help Aceh tsunami
victims.

The Indonesian government is handing more responsibility to
international aid groups in the tsunami-stricken province of Aceh,
in a bid to speed the delivery of relief, food and medicine.

The move is a big step forward for a country that has long been
wary of aid groups in Aceh and is one of the first political repercussions
from the disaster. The province has been kept largely shut to the
outside world and is the scene of an 18-month-old military campaign
against separatist rebels that has attracted criticism from human-rights
groups.

MOST TAIWAN WOMEN UNAWARE THAT LUNG CANCER IS TOP KILLER OF WOMEN
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Jan. 4 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Most women in Taiwan are unaware that lung
cancer is the disease that kills the most women in the country each
year, a survey found Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The survey was recently conducted by the Formosa Cancer
Foundation and a food company on 1,067 Taiwan women aged 25 to 65.
</P>
<P>
The survey showed that 80 percent of Taiwan women are not aware
that lung cancer is the No. 1 killer, 59 percent did not know what
early symptoms to look for and 48 percent had no idea how the
disease could be prevented.
</P>
<P>
Lai Kee-ming, executive director of the foundation, said that
every day, six women in Taiwan die from lung cancer; moreover, many
women who don't smoke and who lead a normal life have suddenly found
themselves in the terminal stage of lung cancer.
</P>
<P>
The rate of surviving for five years after being diagnosed with
lung cancer is less than 15 percent, he said.
</P>
<P>
Lai pointed out that half of lung cancer cases have no definite
cause, leading many researcher to believe that the disease may be
genetically influenced. However, around 40 percent are affected by
second-hand smoke, and only 10 percent are smokers themselves.
</P>
<P>
Lai said that Taiwan women exposed to second-hand smoke will
increase their odds of contracting lung cancer five fold. The survey
also found that nearly half of Taiwan women live with members of
their family who smoke. Two out of every three Taiwan women don't
know the hazard posed by exposure to second-hand smoke.

NEARLY 90% OF ENTERPRISES TO GIVE YEAR-END BONUSES: SURVEY
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Jan. 4 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Nearly 90 percent of enterprises said in a
survey released Tuesday that they will give out year-end bonuses, but
only 65 percent of employees said they expect to receive one.
</P>
<P>
The survey was conducted by an online human resources company
Dec. 23-27, collecting 1,139 effective samples and having a margin
of error of 3 percent.
</P>
<P>
The survey showed that 88.6 percent of the enterprises said they
will give out year-end bonus before Chinese Lunar New Year, which
falls on Feb. 9, compared with only 6.7 percent who said they won't.
</P>
<P>
The figures were a drastic contrast to the 29.8 percent of the
employees who said they don't expect a bonus, and 64.4 percent who
said they are expecting the extra money.
</P>
<P>
Not only that, enterprises expected to give an average of
1.51-month bonus, compared with only 1.21-month bonus expected by
employees, the survey also showed.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said that employees have become more conservative after
four consecutive years of an economic slump, and they tend to lower
their expectations for year-end bonuses.
</P>
<P>
The survey found that year-end bonuses for all sectors averaged
1.51 months in 2004, up 0.08 months from the previous year.
Those who are in the financial and securities sector will receive the
most in year-end bonuses, averaging 2.19 months, followed by those in
the trading or traditional manufacturing sectors at 1.65 months, and
those in the construction and real-estate and information technology
sectors at 1.48 months.

TAIWAN-PRODUCED HEAD LETTUCE MAKING INROADS IN JAPAN

<TEXT>
<P>
Total head lettuce exports to Japan in 2005
are estimated to earn net profits of about NT$40 million (US$1.26
million), officials of the Council of Agriculture said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The officials said 770 tons of Taiwan-produced fresh head lettuce
were exported to Japan last year and existing orders from Japanese
businesses for the vegetable in 2005 has reached 3,500 tons.
</P>
<P>
In the past, Japan has imported most of its head lettuce from the
United States and Australia.
</P>
<P>
The yearly harvest of lettuce from other countries is in April
and November; however, since the growing season in Taiwan is
staggered from November to March, there is space in the Japanese
market for Taiwan lettuce.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, thanks to Taiwan's geographic position, head lettuce
from the island enjoys a reputation of freshness and high quality in
the neighboring market, the officials said, adding that the council
will continue to assist local farmers to build an efficient
production and transportation system to expand their exports.

TAIWAN RESEARCHERS ISOLATE MULTIPOTENT CELLS FROM HUMAN PLACENTA
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Jan. 4 (CNA)
(By Y.F. Low)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A group of researchers in Taiwan announced
Tuesday that they have successfully isolated a population of
multipotent cells from human placenta, which could be a new source of
stem cells other than embryonic stem cells and adult stem cells.
</P>
<P>
Adipose, bone and neuro cells were differentiated from the
placenta-derived multipotent cells after culture, the researchers
said.
</P>
<P>
The achievement was made by a team of researchers from the
National Health Research Institute (NHRI), National Taiwan University
Hospital and Cathay General Hospital.
</P>
<P>
A report on the achievement has been published in the latest
issue of the Stem Cells journal and the team is applying for a patent
for the technology.
</P>
<P>
According to Chen Yao-chang from the NHRI's Stem Cell Research
Center, although the differentiation potential of placenta-derived
multipotent cells is slightly lower than that of embryonic stem
cells, it does not involve the ethical concerns surrounding embryonic
stem cell research.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the placenta, which weighs 700 grams to 800 grams,
is a high-yield source of stem cells compared with cord blood, which
is only 80 grams to 90 grams in a newborn, Chen said.
</P>
<P>
Compared with bone marrow stem cells, placenta-derived
multipotent cells carry a higher differentiation potential, and it
does not involve an invasive procedure such as extracting bone
marrow, Chen said.
</P>
<P>
Theoretically speaking, he said, the placenta-derived multipotent
cells could be applied in the treatment of patients with neural
damage or bone fracture.
</P>
<P>
However, the research is still premature and will only enter the
human application stage in 10 years, he added.

ECONOMISTS EXPECT TAIWAN CURRENCY, INTEREST RATES TO GO UP IN 2005
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Jan.  4 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Economists are of the general expectation
that the Taiwan currency and interest rates will go on rising in
2005, citing the central bank's concern over a continued influx of
foreign capital.
</P>
<P>
Hsu Chen-ming, a professor of economics at National Taiwan
University, forecast that rate hikes by the Central Bank of China
(CBC) will be unavoidable in 2005, mainly to maintain consumer
product prices and the value of the new Taiwan dollar.
</P>
<P>
According to Hsu, the key rate increases by a quarter of a
percentage point in September last year -- the first after 14
interest rate falls initiated by the CBC -- presaged the end of a
low interest rate period.
</P>
<P>
The CBC again lifted interest rates by 0.125 percentage points
late last month, pushing up its re-discount rate to 1.75 percent, its
one-year short term rate to 4 percent and rates on accommodation with
collateral to 2.125 percent.
</P>
<P>
A persistent inflow of foreign hot money will keep increasing
inflationary pressure at home, despite the fact that a stronger local
unit will help offset part of the pressure, he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
In a bid to recover the economy, the CBC had since the second
half of 2003 adopted a low interest rate policy and had tried to keep
the new Taiwan dollar at a relatively low value by buying into large
amounts of foreign exchange, largely increasing its foreign reserves
and making it able to release its reserve currencies into the market,
resulting in continued drops in interest rates, he explained.
</P>
<P>
During the second half of 2003, inter-bank overnight interest
rates were maintained at around 1 percent, with the ratio further
declining to even lower levels in the first half of 2004, he noted.
</P>
<P>
In addition to watching economic changes in the domestic market,
he said that the central bank has also had to pay heed to
international factors, such as the monetary policy of the U.S.
Federal Reserve (Fed)
</P>
<P>
Executives of Citibank, the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking
Corporation and Standard Chartered Bank also contended that the Fed
will go on with its gradual rate increase policy this year and next
year and forecast that the CBC will follow suit but in a narrower
range and at a slower pace.
</P>
<P>
The Fed raised its key interest rates five times last year,
lifting key rates to an average of 2.25 percent.
</P>
<P>
National Chengchi University Chu Hau-ming said that the CBC will
follow in the Fed's footsteps and pointed to the course of the U.S.
dollar and mainland China's renminbi as additional key factors.
</P>
<P>
If the United States fails to improve its fiscal and trade
deficits this year, the greenback is set to continue its current
depreciation, prompting Asian currencies upward, bankers said, adding
that the local unit will also continue to strengthen should the CBC
decide not to interfere.
</P>
<P>
They predicted that the new Taiwan dollar will reach a value of
30.5 to the U.S. dollar in the first half of this year.
</P>
<P>
The local currency ended at 31.846 against the U.S. unit Tuesday
in the Taipei foreign exchange market, losing a slight NT$0.001 to
Monday's finish. It stood at 31.917 against the U.S. currency last
Friday, underpinned by a rising Japanese yen.
</P>
<P>
The new Taiwan dollar gained by about 6 percent in value aginst
the U. S. dollar over the past year.

TAIWAN WORKING ON POSITION PAPER TO SEEK U.S.  FTA SUPPORT
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Jan. 4 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) is
working on a position paper to solicit wide support from the United
States for a free trade agreement (FTA) between Taiwan and the United
States.
</P>
<P>
The Bureau of Foreign Trade (BOFT) said the position paper will
make the case that the signing of an FTA between Taiwan and the
United States would be a win-win situation for both sides and that
the U.S. would be able to make inroads into East Asia from Taiwan in
view of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) plus
mainland China, South Korea and Japan situation.
</P>
<P>
The BOFT will sponsor publicity campaigns in U.S. cities this
year in the hope that Congress, the media, think tanks, and businesses
there will understand the benefits of signing an FTA with Taiwan, and
that the United States will consider an FTA with Taiwan as a
priority.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan has in recent years been promoting the signing of FTAs
with its allies, and signed one with Panama last year. It expects to
complete others with Nicaragua and Guatemala by August this year, and
FTA consultations on with Paraguay, the Dominican Republic and
Honduras are also in progress.
</P>
<P>
BOFT Director-General Huang Chi-peng said Tuesday Taiwan is still
eyeing the United States, New Zealand, Japan and Singapore for FTAs.
</P>
<P>
Huang noted that talks on a trade and investment framework
agreement between Taiwan and the United States were resumed last
year, and that Economic Affairs Minister Ho Mei-yueh conveyed
Taiwan's wish to sign a FTA with the United States during a recent
visit.
</P>
<P>
Although Taiwan has yet to obtain any promises from the United
States, it will continue to work hard toward the goal, Huang said.

TAIWAN LOOKS FORWARD TO ATTENDING TSUNAMI RELIEF SUMMIT AS OBSERVER

<TEXT>
<P>
Taiwan looks forward to attending an
emergency meeting of world leaders to be held in Jakarta Thursday to
discuss relief operations in the wake of a massive earthquake off
Indonesia and subsequent tsunami, a senior official said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Foreign Affairs Tan Sun Chen said Taiwan should at
least be allowed to attend the disaster relief summit as an observer.
</P>
<P>
Senior leaders of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations
(ASEAN) took the initiative to organize the meeting to coordinate
relief efforts in coastal areas in Southeast and South Asia
devastated by the magnitude-9.0 earthquake and subsequent tsunamis.
</P>
<P>
U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan, U.S. Secretary of State Colin
Powell and senior leaders from Japan, Australia and mainland China
will attend the Jakarta summit. Basically, only U.N. members have
been invited to attend the meeting.
</P>
<P>
However, Chen said that although Taiwan is not a U.N. member, it
should not be shut out of the global disaster relief summit.
</P>
<P>
"Disaster relief work is borderless and shouldn't be subject to
political meddling," Chen said, adding that Taiwan has been active in
providing relief goods, cash aid and medical assistance to
tsunami-ravaged countries since the catastrophe occurred.
</P>
<P>
Noting that Taiwan's humanitarian aid has received recognition
from Indonesia, Chen said he hopes the Indonesian government can
recommend Taiwan's participation in the summit.
</P>
<P>
Because of Beijing's ubiquitous diplomatic suppression, Taiwan
has been shut out of the United Nations and many other major
international organizations.
</P>
<P>
Chen said the government is still seeking the opportunity to take
part in the Jakarta summit through various channels.
</P>
<P>
The government has promised to offer US$50 million in relief aid
to the quake- and tsunami-hit Southeast and South Asian countries,
including Indonesia, Thailand and Sri Lanka. In addition, Chen said,
cash donations from private citizens had exceeded NT$180 million
(US$5.72 million) as of Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, private organizations have also donated a large amount
of medical supplies, foodstuffs and tents. Chen said the Ministry of
Foreign Affairs will hold a meeting Thursday to discuss how to
deliver the goods to the disaster zones as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan has also sent several medical teams to the hardest-hit
disaster zones, including the Indonesian province of Aceh, Sri Lanka
and the Thai resort island of Phuket, to assist in emergency medical
treatment and disinfection operations.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, a team of 17 disease control experts left for Phuket,
carrying with them 1.5 tons of medical supplies to help curb possible
disease outbreaks there.
</P>
<P>
The team was sent by the Department of Health to the resort
island of Phuket which was among the worst-hit areas.
</P>
<P>
"We will send more people in the following three months to
collaborate with the World Health Organization in its relief
efforts," Center for Disease Control director Kuo Hsu-sung said.

</P>
<P>
In Hsinchu City, the Armed Forces Hsinchu Hospital held a charity
art sale for the cause, and Hsinchu Mayor Lin Jung-tzer spent
NT$5,00O on a calligraphic work to show his support for the sale.
</P>
<P>
The Red Cross Society of the Republic of China, Azio TV and Era
Group are set to jointly hold a fund-raising event in Taipei Saturday
that will be broadcast live on Azio TV.
</P>
<P>
A number of noted local entertainers are expected to attend the
event and the organizers said they hope to raise at least NT$100

<P>
Taiwan is planning to help countries
affected by the Dec. 26 tsunami disaster to build health centers in
addition to providing them with emergency aid, Center for Disease
Control (CDC) Director-General Kuo Hsu-sung said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Kuo said such a long-term plan is necessary because a lot of
infrastructure in the tsunami-hit areas has been destroyed.
</P>
<P>
Besides offering US$50 million in relief for the affected
countries, Taiwan has also sent medical teams to some of the
worst-hit countries.
</P>
<P>
Also Tuesday, the Department of Health announced that it will
donate 10 shipments of emergency medical supplies to the World Health
Organization for delivery to the disaster areas.

ENVIRONMENTALISTS CALL FOR HALT TO NUCLEAR PLANT OVER TSUNAMI CONCERN
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Jan.  4 (CNA)
(By  Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Local environmental activists urged the
government Tuesday to stop construction of the island's fourth
nuclear power plant because it sits on an earthquake- and tsunami-prone
location.
</P>
<P>
They made the appeal at a public hearing organized by Legislator
Chao Yung-ching of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party after a
massive earthquake off the Indonesian island of Sumatra Dec. 26 and
subsequent tsunami wreaked havoc in a dozen Southeast and South Asia
countries. The death toll from the catastrophe has approached
150,000, according to media reports.
</P>
<P>
Lee Chao-hsing, dean of the College of Natural Science of
National Oceanic University, said undersea earthquakes, explosions of
undersea volcanoes, undersea avalanches and falling meteorites can
cause devastating tsunami.
</P>
<P>
Noting that Taiwan is located in an earthquake-prone area, Lee
said Taiwan's terrain is unstable and has many faults. The site of
the fourth nuclear power plant on the island's northeastern coast is
adjacent to the connecting area of the Philippine and the Eurasia
tectonic plates, where earthquakes are common.
</P>
<P>
Lee said a powerful earthquake off the northern Taiwan port of
Keelung in 1867 triggered tsunami that resulted in serious
devastation of the region.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on the same occasion, the president of the Taiwan
Environmental Protection Union, said there are active volcanoes
beneath the waters surrounding Kueishan Island off the northeastern
Taiwan coast.
</P>
<P>
"We are worried whether the fourth nuclear power plant can
withstand thundering tsunami setting off by an undersea volcano
eruption or an undersea earthquake," Chen said.
</P>
<P>
Against this backdrop, Chen said she hopes the government will
stop construction of the controversial nuclear power plant to avoid a
deadly disaster.

SMALL ENTERPRISES TAIWAN'S BIGGEST EMPLOYERS: DGBAS
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei, Jan. 4 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taiwan's small businesses still provide most
jobs for domestic workers, with the sector hiring as much as 77.6
percent of the country's employees as of the end of 2003, the
government reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics compiled by the Cabinet-level Directorate
General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics (DGBAS), the ratio was
slightly down from previous levels due to a larger number of jobs
offered by large businesses and the government's public service
employment-boost plan.
</P>
<P>
There were 1.146 million small companies in Taiwan at the end of
December 2003, absorbing 7.43 million workers, an increase of 70,000
over the previous year's level, the tallies show. There were about
924,000 companies in the service industries and some 134,000 in
manufacturing, up by 42,000 and down by 124, respectively, from the
year-earlier level.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan's small enterprises conducted business worth a total of
NT$8.7 trillion (US$272 billion) in 2003, marking an annual growth
rate of 16.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
Some 84.7 percent of the business was digested by the domestic
market, up by 2.7 percentage points over the 2002 level, mainly due
to their role changes from exporters to parts providers for large
companies, DGBAS officials explained.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, 37.7 percent of the small companies failed to
make a profit in 2003 as a result of weaker demand in the home
market, they pointed out.

TAIPEI MAYOR REGRETS HONG KONG VISA SNUB
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Jan.  4 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou said Tuesday he
has been forced to cancel a plan to visit Hong Kong from Jan. 11-13
because the Hong Kong government would not grant him a visa.
</P>
<P>
Ma, who was born in Hong Kong in 1950, said he was bewildered
when his Hong Kong hosts informed him earlier in the day that they
had been unable to obtain a visa for him from the Hong Kong
authorities.
</P>
<P>
Given the close civilian exchanges between Taiwan and Hong Kong,
Ma said he could not understand why the Hong Kong government would
deny him a visa.
</P>
<P>
"There are 43 commercial flights between Taiwan and Hong Kong per
day and Taiwan people make 3 million to 4 million visits to Hong Kong
annually. Hong Kong is an area ruled by law. When I received an
invitation to a speaking tour of Hong Kong, it never occurred to me
that the Hong Kong authorities might snub my visa application, " Ma
said.
</P>
<P>
Ma was originally invited to deliver a speech on the rise of
Chinese urban development from Taipei's perspective at the University
of Hong Kong Jan. 11 and to attend a Taipei tourism promotion
activity and seminar at the Hong Kong University of Science and
Technology Jan. 12.
</P>
<P>
Ma said the Hong Kong government's denial of his visa application
for such a cultural journey has prompted him to think that
Taiwan-Hong Kong relations are regressing. Such a development is
counterproductive to relations across the Taiwan Strait, he added.
</P>
<P>
Ma recalled that during a visit he made to Hong Kong four years
ago, he held a 90-minute meeting with Hong Kong Chief Executive Tung
Chee Hwa. "And now I cannot even secure a permit to enter Hong Kong.
What a big change in our bilateral relations," Ma said.

IMPORTED PRODUCTS CONTAINING MEAT TO BE INSPECTED

<P>
Imported products with meat ingredients must
be declared and inspected by the Bureau of Animal and Plant Health
Inspection and Quarantine under the Council of Agriculture from the
beginning of this year, an agricultural official said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The anonymous official said the measure was taken to protect
Taiwan from epidemics prevailing in other regions.
</P>
<P>
Noting that Taiwan entered the World Trade Organization in 2002
and is opening its market wider than ever to overseas products, the
official said the island is at a greater risk of bringing in harmful
insects and other organisms.
</P>
<P>
To address the risk, the bureau began from this year to inspect
any imported products containing meat, the official said.
</P>
<P>
Under the regulations, importers of products containing meat must
show health inspection certificates issued by the relevant
authorities to prove the products come from areas that are free from
epidemics.
</P>
<P>
Manufacturers of products made of meat from areas with foot and
mouth disease or avian flu must prove with the proper documents that
the meat was heated during the manufacturing process to kill any
virus present.
</P>
<P>
Food made of ruminant-based products and originating from
countries affected by mad cow disease will be subject to more
stricter inspections before being allowed into Taiwan, the official
added.

<P>
Taiwan is seeking to join more committees
under the umbrella of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and
Development (OECD) in an effort to step up ties with the world body
and help explore foreign trade, a government official said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Huang Chih-peng, director-general of the Bureau of Foreign Trade
under the Ministry of Economic Affairs, said Taiwan will apply to
enter the OCED's financial, investment, fishery and marine committees
as an observer later this year, representing fresh efforts after the
country won status at its Competition Committee and became an ad hoc
observer of its Trade Committee.
</P>
<P>
According to Huang, Taiwan will submit applications in the second
half of the year as soon as the various committees have worked out
relevant rules in spring to broaden relations with non-member
countries -- a package agreed upon last year by OECD member nations
to enhance international links.
</P>
<P>
The Paris-based OCED now groups 30 full member states, including
Austria, Canada, Belgium, Holland, Italy, Japan, Germany,

EXECUTIVE YUAN BLAMES MAINLAND CHINA FOR DENYING VISA TO TAIPEI MAYOR

The Executive Yuan blamed mainland China
Tuesday after the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region denied a
visa to Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou.
</P>

Chen Chi-mai, a spokesman for the Executive Yuan, said the visa
snub contradicts Beijing's 1997 promise to allow Hong Kong keep its
capitalist system unchanged for 50 years.

Ma was invited to visit Hong Kong from Jan. 11-13, but was forced

AIDE DENIES PRESIDENT WOULD BUY OFF OPPOSITION WITH GOVERNMENT POSTS
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Jan.  4 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President Chen Shui-bian's promises of
consulting the opposition on major policies do not mean he would
offer government positions to opposition politicians in exchange for
their support, an aide to the president said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The anonymous aide made the statement in an apparent attempt to
put paid to speculation in Taipei that Chen might name James Soong,
chairman of the opposition People First Party (PFP) , as chairman of
the Straits Exchange Foundation to deal with Beijing on behalf of the
government.
</P>
<P>
The aide said Chen is keen to promote cooperation between the
ruling and opposition parties, stabilize the political situation and
push for his legislative agenda, but will not try to buy the
opposition off by offering government posts to their leaders.
</P>
<P>
Citing the president's promises in his New Year address that the
DPP will reconcile and cooperate with the opposition on anything as
long as it improves the political stability, the welfare of the
people, the harmony between the various ethnic groups, and the peace
with mainland China, the aide dismissed as groundless speculation the
reports about who will be named to what posts in the president's new
administration.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, DPP legislative whip Ker Chien-ming said his DPP
caucus will start negotiations with other party caucuses at the
legislature to create an amicable atmosphere for the proposed
party-to-party dialogue.
</P>
<P>
Noting that Chen met with former president Lee Teng-hui, the
so-called "spiritual leader" of the opposition Taiwan Solidarity
Union, earlier that day, Ker said the party-to-party negotiations
with the TSU have already begun.
</P>
<P>
Also Tuesday, main opposition Kuomintang spokesman Chang
Jung-kung urged Chen to seek the opposition's opinion in selecting a
new premier.
</P>
<P>
This should go before any party-to-party negotiations, given that
the Cabinet is set to resign en masse before the next legislature is
sworn in Feb. 1, Chang said, adding that the KMT has not yet been
approached by the president for any meeting of political party
leaders as promised by Chen in his New Year address.
</P>
<P>
When asked what the KMT will do if Chen starts negotiations first
with the PFP, which was a firm KMT ally but fell out because of the
two parties' competition against each other in the Dec. 11
legislative elections, the KMT spokesman said "I don't believe this
could happen."

DPP CHIEF CALLS CHARTER FLIGHTS INDICATION OF CROSS-STRAIT TIES
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei, Jan. 4 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The acting chairman of the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) said Tuesday that charter flight services
between Taiwan and mainland Chinese cities, if arranged successfully
during the Chinese New Year holiday, will bode well for a
breakthrough in the impasse between Taiwan and the mainland.
</P>
<P>
Speaking after a weekly meeting of DPP Central Standing
Committee, Ker Chien-ming urged the mainland to jump at the chance
offered by president Chen Shui-bian in a Nov. 10 statement to start
Chinese New Year charter flights.
</P>
<P>
Chen said in his statement that Taiwan would like to negotiate
with the mainland on the flight services that would not travel via a
third place and that would be open to mainland carriers as required
by Beijing.
</P>
<P>
If the charter flights can be launched successfully, Ker said it
could be the beginning of a resumption of dialogue between Taiwan and
the mainland.
</P>
<P>
Beijing severed contacts with Taiwan in 1999 after then-president
Lee Teng-hui branded the relationship between Taiwan and the mainland
as "a special state-to-state relationship."
</P>
<P>
The acting DPP chairman also condemned Beijing for "pretending to
be an arbitrator" in its dispute with Taiwan by trying to enact an
anti-secession law to apply to Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
This law, once enacted, would provide Beijing with a convenient
excuse to annex Taiwan by force and further alienate the Taiwan
people, Ker said.
</P>
<P>
Turning to Taiwan's opposition parties, Ker called on them to
reconcile with the ruling party and work together with the DPP to
stabilize the domestic political situations and bring about a
rapprochement with the mainland.

MOEA TO HELP PRIVATE SECTOR SEEK TO HOST INTERNATIONAL FAIRS

<P>
The Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) will
set up an ad hoc office to help the private sector seek to host
international conferences and exhibitions in Taiwan, a MOEA official
said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Tu Tzu-jun, director-general of the MOEA's Department of
Commerce, said that the office will offer assistance and subsidies to
private groups that want to vie for the right to host international
events in Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Given that the service industry is becoming a main driving force
of Taiwan's economy and that the organizing of international
conventions and expositions is considered the industry's locomotive,
the government will make more efforts in this field, Tu noted.
</P>
<P>
Following a target set by the Executive Yuan for 2008, the
Department of Commerce has worked out a project for promoting the
conference and exposition service industry's development that is
worth NT$180 million (US$5.625 million), he went on.
</P>
<P>
Under the project, Tu continued, his department will push forward
the creation of a friendly environment for international conventions
and expositions, help domestic firms achieve higher value-added
businesses, cultivate their ability to form a core information center
for their respective industries, develop skills of organizing
international conferences and expositions, cultivate skilled
personnel and solicit international events to be held in Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
The project sets a target of holding at least six international
conferences and expositions and at least eight conferences of
conglomerates and organizations in Taiwan in the coming four years,
he said.

BEIJING SAID BEHIND HONG KONG'S DECISION TO DENY TAIPEI MAYOR ENTRY
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Hong Kong,  Jan.  5 (CNA)
(By Lin Yu-kuo and Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Several Hong Kong newspapers said on
Wednesday that Beijing was behind the decision by Hong Kong
authorities to deny Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou a visa to visit the
former British colony.
</P>
<P>
The Ming Pao Daily, the Oriental Daily News, Sing Tao daily and
Apple Daily all reported prominently that the mayor was denied a visa
to visit Hong Kong Jan. 11-13. Reports also said that his opposition
to a proposed mainland Chinese "anti-secession law" was a factor. The
elements of the law will be reviewed at the full National People's
Congress in March.
</P>
<P>
Ma was born in Hong Kong in 1950.
</P>
<P>
The Ming Pao Daily put it bluntly by quoting a member of the
Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference versed in Hong
Kong and Taiwan affairs as saying, "Do you think that it was a
decision by the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region?" adding that
Beijing has stipulated clearly that all official contact between Hong
Kong and Taiwan needs prior approval.
</P>
<P>
The proposed "anti-secession law," which was passed by a standing
committee of the National People's Congress last month, has been
criticized by Ma. He said Beijing's approach was unnecessary and
unwise, and that it would lead Taiwan people to think that Beijing is
again attempting to intimidate Taiwan. Ma urged Beijing to back away
from the "edge of a precipice."
</P>
<P>
A senior researcher of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, in
a telephone interview with the Ming Pao Daily, said that given the
fact that Ma most likely has his sights set on running for president
in 2008, it makes sense that he would be against the passage of an
"anti-secession law."
</P>
<P>
However, the researcher continued, Beijing has now drawn a clear
line between supporters and opposers of the "anti-secession law," and
couldn't possibly allow Ma to come to Hong Kong, especially at such a
sensitive time between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait.
</P>
<P>
Ma was originally invited to deliver a speech on the rise of
Chinese urban development from Taipei's perspective at the University
of Hong Kong Jan. 11 and to attend a Taipei tourism promotion
activity and seminar at the Hong Kong University of Science and
Technology Jan. 12.
</P>
<P>
The Hong Kong government subsequently "suggested" that the
University of Hong Kong postpone the seminar to April because,
according to the newspaper reports, the controversial bill is
expected to be passed by that time.

TAIWAN TO TALK WITH 10-ODD WTO MEMBERS ON SERVICES
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Jan. 5 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taiwan is scheduled to engage in bilateral
consultations with more than 10 member countries of the World Trade
Organization (WTO) in mid-February on issues mainly in the service
sector, the Bureau of Foreign Trade (BOFT) reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The proposed bilateral consultations are part of efforts to speed
up the pace of talks pertaining to the "July Package" -- a key
segment of the Doha Round Talks agreed upon on Aug. 1, 2004 in Geneva
by all 148 WTO member countries -- said BOFT Director-General Huang
Chih-peng.
</P>
<P>
Accelerating the "July Package" talks to settle relevant issues
as much as possible will also be taking place prior to a WTO
ministerial meeting scheduled for December in Hong Kong, Huang said.
</P>
<P>
Huang, who will lead a Taiwan delegation to Geneva for the talks,
said that Taiwan is expected to submit a report in May, making
Taiwan's position known concerning further opening of its service
markets and related issues.
</P>
<P>
The "July Package" stipulates a set of rules on a broad range of
issues related to wider liberalization of the agriculture, industry
and service sectors and advocates trade facilitation. BOFT officials
said that the new measures will have a profound impact on the future
development of Taiwan's economy.
</P>
<P>
In late February, representatives of WTO member countries are
also expected to meet in Geneva for talks on the issue of
anti-dumping. BOFT officials said that some countries have raised the
issue against major exporting countries, forming another kind of
trade barrier.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan will consult shortly with other "victim countries" of the
anti-dumping accusation that share common ground on the issue to
jointly work out policies to cope with the forthcoming anti-dumping
talks, the officials added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) and Taiwan's
permanent representative corps in Geneva are scheduled to hold a
three-day Doha Round Talks meeting in Taipei Jan. 7-9 to further
exchange views among the government and the private sector on
Taiwan's stance in the world trade regulatory body as well as
strategies on related issues.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan's permanent representative to the WTO headquarters Yen
Ching-chang, Minister of Economic Affairs Ho Mei-yue and other
officials are expected to preside over various discussion panels
during the meeting.
</P>
<P>
WTO member countries initiated the talks in November 2001 in
Doha, the capital of Qatar, but the talks ground to a halt after the
collapse of negotiations held September last year in Cancun, Mexico.
</P>
<P>
MOEA statistics show that 94 percent of the world's foreign trade
in 2003 was conducted in compliance with the regulations of the world
trade regulatory body. Taiwan officially joined the WTO at the
beginning of 2002.

DPP WANTS INTER-PARTY TALKS TO START WITH TSU
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei, Jan. 5 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The acting chairman of the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) said Wednesday that inter-party talks will
begin soon with its ally Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU) as a precursor
to expanded discussions with other parties.
</P>
<P>
Ker Chien-ming made the remarks as President Chen Shui-bian met
with high-ranking officials and former President Lee Teng-hui in
closed-door meetings over the past two days to exchange views on the
current political situation.
</P>
<P>
Ker said that the basic view was that there must be an end to the
bickering between the ruling and opposition parties via some form of
reconciliation, and pointed to President Chen's new year's address to
the nation where he entreated all political parties to come together
for the benefit of Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
The president said that if something benefits the stability of
domestic politics, the welfare of the people, harmony among ethnic
groups, and cross-strait peace, then it can be discussed between
political parties for further cooperation to achieve positive
results.
</P>
<P>
Ker said the DPP will maintain a "parallel and equidistant"
relationship with the TSU, the Kuomintang (KMT) and the People First
Party (PFP) , and will begin to communicate with them as soon
as possible.
</P>
<P>
Since the DPP has cooperated with the TSU more in the past, it
will consult with it first, Ker said, adding he will contact TSU
acting-chairman Huang Tzung-yuan to set up a time to meet.
</P>
<P>
Huang replied that he was happy to begin discussions about
cooperation and said that the KMT and the PFP also need to come to
the table for the sake of political stability.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Huang Teh-fu, a KMT caucus whip in the legislature,
said Wednesday that political parties can talk among themselves and
that the president only needs to step in if there is a bottleneck in
communications.
</P>
<P>
Huang Teh-fu said that as president of all the people, Chen
should not interfere with DPP party affairs.
</P>
<P>
He also said that he hoped that the offer to better communicate
was not being used as a facade to hide the real goal of the DPP --
driving a wedge between the opposition "pan-blue alliance" of the KMT
and the PFP. Reports have said recently that the DPP will allow the
PFP to have some of its officials placed in the new Cabinet.
</P>
<P>
In line with constitutional precedent, Premier Yu Shyi-kun and
all Cabinet members are expected to resign en masse after the current
Legislative Yuan concludes its final session on Jan. 21. Rumors have
circulated for the last couple of weeks about the possibility of Chen
naming a new premier and forming a coalition Cabinet with opposition
parties. Senior government officials, including Yu himself, have been
tightlipped about the imminent Cabinet reshuffle.

DOH HEAD DENIES HEALTH INSURANCE PREMIUMS TO BE RAISED THIS MONTH
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Jan.  5 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Minister of Health Chen Chien-jen denied
news reports Wednesday that national health insurance premiums will
be raised by 5 percent or more before the end of this month.
</P>
<P>
Both Chen and Bureau of National Health Insurance (BNHI)
Director-General Liu Chien-hsiang said that changes in national
health insurance premiums is a topic that will be discussed during a
public forum on Jan. 22, after which officials will make an informed
decision.
</P>
<P>
Admitting that the national health insurance program, a mammoth
enterprise, has been operated deeply in the red, Chen said that even
if premiums are raised to help offset the mounting financial
pressure, they will not come into effect for at least three months
because of bureaucratic procedures.
</P>
<P>
Chen added that a consensus on what to do ought to be reached at
the public forum and that the BNHI will come up with a finance plan
afterward. If the plan is approved by the Department of Health (DOH),
it will then be submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval prior to
being forwarded to the Legislative Yuan. The whole process will be
completed in three months in accordance with the regulations of the
Legislative Yuan, Chen noted.
</P>
<P>
Chen claimed that the rights of and medical care for patients,
particularly those in emergency rooms or critical care wards, will
not be compromised regardless whether or not national health
insurance premiums are raised.
</P>
<P>
DOH officials quoted an actuarial assessment report as indicating
that the national health insurance program can be operated at
breakeven for two years if premiums are raised by 5.01 percent, with
in-the-black operations expected to stay healthy for five years if
premiums are raised by 5.11 percent.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, BNHI Director-General Liu said that the health
insurance bureau is assessed ways to address an expected "sink hole"
in funds this March or April due to a fall in the reserve fund.
</P>
<P>
BNHI officials are asking everyone who has used the national
health insurance scheme to support revisions to the system. They said
that the program can be maintained for two to five more years if each
person chips in an extra NT$50 to NT$100 per month.
</P>
<P>
According to the BNHI, health insurance premiums have only been
raised once during the 10 years since the program was started in
1995. Premiums were raised from 4.25 percent to 4.55 percent in
September 2002.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the legislative caucus of the Taiwan Solidarity Union
(TSU) , an ally of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party, said
Wednesday that the party will support the DOH's plan to raise
premiums.
</P>
<P>
However, TSU party whip Huang Tsung-yuan said that the TSU will
support the increase only after the BNHI reviews its expenditure
protocols and makes sure that the money is not going to be spent
inappropriately.
</P>
<P>
The opposition People First Party (PFP), on the other hand, came
out against any increase in premiums, saying that costs in various
sectors of society are rising, while the average person's income has
not kept pace.

TAIPEI MAYOR SAYS HONG KONG UNWISE TO DENY HIM ENTRY
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Jan.  5 (CNA)
(By Y.F. Low)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou said Wednesday
that if mainland China's decision to deny him a visa to visit Hong
Kong was because of his opposition to Beijing's "anti-secession law,"
the move was an unwise one.
</P>
<P>
Talking to reporters after attending a weekly Cabinet meeting, Ma
said Hong Kong is regarded as "the showcase of one country, two
systems" and is supposed to be different from mainland China, which
does not allow freedom of speech.
</P>
<P>
Ma made the comment in response to reports by Hong Kong media
that the Special Administrative Region government had denied him
entry to Hong Kong because he had spoken against Beijing's plan to
introduce the law.
</P>
<P>
Ma had previously criticized Beijing's move as unnecessary and
unwise, saying it will further alienate Taiwan from mainland China
and worsen cross-Taiwan Strait relations.
</P>
<P>
Ma had originally planned to visit Hong Kong next week, with his
itinerary including giving a speech at the University of Hong Kong,
attending a Taiwan tourism promotion event, and holding a forum with
students at Hong Kong University of Science and Technology.
</P>
<P>
The University of Hong Kong Tuesday said it planned to postpone
the speech to April since Ma was not issued a visa in time to make
the scheduled date.
</P>
<P>
However, Ma said he does not think he will be available in April
because the Taipei City Council will have opened its session by then.

PREMIER ACCEPTS DONATION FOR ASIAN TSUNAMI RELIEF PROGRAM
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Jan.  5 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Premier Yu Shyi-kun accepted on behalf of
the government a NT$16.9 million (US$531,446) donation from a private
realtor Wednesday for post-disaster relief programs in Southeast and
South Asian countries.
</P>
<P>
The gesture from the Sinyi Realty Group was the biggest private
donation received by the government since a magnitude-9.0 earthquake
off Indonesia and subsequent tsunamis wreaked havoc in a dozen
countries around the Indian Ocean less than two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
Yu said the donation shows the humanitarian concern and the
warmth of the people of Taiwan. By making the generous donation, he
added, Sinyi Realty has set a good example.
</P>
<P>
Sinyi Realty Chairman Chou Chun-chi said his company arrived at
the donation amount by multiplying the number of employees in the
company by NT$10,000.
</P>
<P>
"We hope our move can inspire other local enterprises to join the
aid campaign to help the tsunami victims," Chou said.
</P>
<P>
Premier Yu said the Republic of China government has pledged to
donate US$50 million in relief aid to earthquake- and tsunami-ravaged
countries, making Taiwan the world's 11th-largest donor.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Yu said post-disaster relief requires not only cash
but also comprehensive and circumspect planning so that each aid
package can be wisely used to help survivors.
</P>
<P>
Yu said the Cabinet has so far held two rounds of
inter-departmental emergency meetings to work out short-term relief
aid plans as well as mid- and long-term reconstruction aid programs.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Yu said, the government is actively negotiating with
tsunami-affected countries to sponsor full reconstruction programs in
a specific disaster zone.
</P>
<P>
"If the ongoing consultations can generate positive results,
we'll be able to contribute our experiences in fighting severe acute
respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreaks and in post-921 earthquake
reconstruction," Yu said.
</P>
<P>
In the future, Yu said, Taiwan will actively participate in
relevant international relief conferences and pool its resources in
the public and private sectors to facilitate relief operations in
tsunami-ravaged countries.
</P>
<P>
As of Tuesday, cash donations from private citizens to a special
account opened by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for aid to
tsunami-hit countries had exceeded NT$180 million (US$5.72 million).
</P>
<P>
Major charitable organizations have also launched fund-raising
drives for similar purposes.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan has also sent several medical teams to the hardest-hit
disaster zones, including the Indonesian province of Aceh, Sri Lanka
and the Thai resort island of Phuket, to assist in emergency medical
treatment and disinfection operations.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, a team of 17 disease control experts left for Phuket,
carrying with them 1.5 tons of medical supplies to help curb possible
disease outbreaks there.

TAIWAN RANKS 27TH IN GLOBAL ECONOMIC FREEDOM SURVEY
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Washington,  Jan.  4 (CNA)
(By Jorge Liu and Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taiwan ranks the 27th in a global
economic freedom survey, seven notches up from 34th the previous year,
according to the Heritage Foundation/Wall Street Journal 2005 index
of economic freedom, which was published Monday.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong was No. 1 for the 11th consecutive year, while mainland
China made headway to rank 112th, 16 notches up from 128th the
previous year.
</P>
<P>
Also rounding out the top 10 were Singapore, Luxembourg, Estonia,
Ireland, New Zealand, Great Britain, Denmark, Iceland and Australia,
in that order.
</P>
<P>
The 2005 Index of Economic Freedom measures 161 countries against
a list of 50 independent variables divided into 10 broad factors of
economic freedom. Low scores are more desirable. The higher the score
on a factor, the greater the level of government interference in the
economy and the less economic freedom a country enjoys.
</P>
<P>
These 50 variables are grouped into the following categories:
trade policy, fiscal burden to the government, government
intervention in the country, monetary policy, capital flows and
foreign investment, banking and finance, wages and prices, property
rights, regulations, and informal market activity.
</P>
<P>
The Heritage Foundation and Wall Street Journal have jointly
formulated the index of economic freedom since 1995. This year, they
based their assessment of 161 countries on the 10 categories.
</P>
<P>
On a scale of one to five, with one being the highest freedom,
Hong Kong scored 1.35, Taiwan 2.29, and mainland China 3.46.
</P>
<P>
The report said that Taiwan has experienced slower growth in
gross domestic product as its economy has matured. The March 20, 2004
re-election of President Chen Shui-bian gave new momentum to a
popular consensus supporting economic reforms.
</P>
<P>
Relaxed rules on foreign investment in the transportation, power
supply, financial and telecommunications sectors have attracted
capital. Laws easing financial mergers have begun to show results as
Taiwan's non-performing loan ratio has dropped to its lowest level
since the Asian financial crisis of 1997.
</P>
<P>
An economic upturn in the United States was reflected both in
annualized GDP growth of over 6.28 percent by mid-2004 and in
all-time high trade figures. By June 2004, foreign exchange reserves
had swelled to US$229 billion.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan's unemployment had fallen to a three-year low of 4.36
percent. The U.S. Trade Representative's June 2004 Special 301 report
noted that Taiwan has steadily improved its intellectual property
rights enforcement and successfully reduced the production of pirated
optical media. The government also continues to ease restrictions on
Taiwan businesses that trade and invest in mainland China.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan's fiscal burden on the government score was 0.1 point
worse this year, and its government intervention score was 0.5 point
worse; however, its capital flows and foreign investment score and
banking and finance score were 1 point better. As a result, Taiwan's
overall score is 0.14 point better this year.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan's scores in various categories were as follows: trade
policy (2.0) , fiscal burden of the government (3.4) , government
intervention in the economy (3.0), monetary policy (1.0), capital
flows and foreign investment (2.0), banking and finance (2.0), wages
and prices (2.0) property rights (2.0), regulations (3.0), and
informal market activity (2.5).

The Red Cross Society of the Republic China
launched a month-long fundraising campaign Wednesday in cooperation
with the FamilyMart convenience store chain to help countries
affected by the Dec. 26 earthquake/tsunami disaster.
</P>
<P>
The campaign asks for a fixed amount of NT$200 (US$6.25) for each
donation, which will be accepted at any FamilyMart store islandwide.

<P>
Hau said the donations will be used to support the relief

</P>
<P>
Hau said his organization aims to raise NT$300 million to provide
placement for 200,000 homeless victims for six to eight months.
</P>

MAYOR'S VISA SNUB SIGNALS DOWNTURN IN TAIWAN-HONG KONG RELATIONS
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei, Jan. 5 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Relations between Taiwan and Hong Kong would
have to be re-labeled as "regressing" if reports saying that Hong
Kong authorities have denied Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou a visa to the
former British colony are true, a Mainland Affairs Council (MAC)
spokesman said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
MAC Vice Chairman Chiu Tai-san said that the MAC has asked
officials from the Chung Hwa Travel Service -- Taiwan's de facto
liaison office in Hong Kong under the MAC's supervision established
in the absence of formal relations between Taiwan and Hong Kong -- to
verify the reports by contacting the Hong Kong authorities.
</P>
<P>
Chiu urged the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region's
authorities to handle the visa issue in an even-handed manner to
avoid having the international community question Hong Kong's
democratization and to salvage the "one country, two systems" formula
from bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
Noting that people have gone back and forth between Taiwan and
Hong frequently and in large amount over the years, Chiu stressed
that regardless of who is denied a visa, this sort of treatment is
definitely a blow to the development of bilateral ties between the
two sides of the Taiwan Strait.
</P>
<P>
Ma was originally invited to deliver a speech on the rise of
Chinese urban development from Taipei's perspective at the University
of Hong Kong Jan. 11 and to attend a Taipei tourism promotion
activity and seminar at the Hong Kong University of Science and
Technology Jan. 12.
</P>
<P>
Ma was informed by his Hong Kong activity sponsor Tuesday about
the visa snub, although other members who had planned to travel with
the mayor were given visas.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong media on Wednesday said the reason Hong Kong
authorities did not issue Ma a visa was because of his opposition to
a proposed mainland Chinese "anti-secession law." The elements of the
law will be reviewed at the full National People's Congress in March.
</P>
<P>
The Hong Kong government subsequently "suggested" that the
University of Hong Kong postpone the seminar to April because,
according to Hong Kong newspapers reports, the controversial bill is
expected to be passed by that time.

practice in major medical centers in Taipei has chosen to give up a
highly paid career to move with his family to a tiny mountainous
village in eastern Taiwan to take care of aboriginal people.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Kao Tien-tsi has been running his clinic at the Bunun tribal
village of Hongshih located in Haijui rural township of Taitung
County for more than six months, serving fewer than 50 households.
</P>
<P>
According to the locals, Kao, a pediatrician, technically charges
nothing for his treatment. He does not care whether his patients pay
his clinic's NT$10 registration or not. The minimum registration fee
is normally NT$50 for clinics in Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Kao, who is camera-shy, turned down an interview with a CNA
reporter and instead let his aide speak for him.
</P>
<P>
Kao not only treats the aboriginal villagers, he also offers
consultations to the Bunun people, most of whom, particularly the
elderly ones, suffer from chronicle diseases such as liver complaints
that are caused by their lifestyle, the aide said.
</P>
<P>
The aide said that Kao initially decided to charge the villagers
nothing for registration but later decided on NT$10 for fear of
provoking another clinic in the village.
</P>
<P>
Now the clinic is the talk of the town simply because it is a
"NT$10 hospital," the aide said.
</P>
<P>
Kao and his family, none of whom are aboriginal, have taken to
village life like ducks to water.

TAIWAN DEMANDS EXPLANATION FROM HONG KONG FOR DENYING MAYOR MA ENTRY
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  Jan. 5 (CNA)
(By Y.F. Low)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The ROC government on Wednesday demanded an
proper explanation from Hong Kong of its decision to reject a visa
application by Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou.
</P>
<P>
Executive Yuan spokesman Chen Chi-mai pointed out that government
officials from Taiwan have often had problems obtaining visas to Hong
Kong during recent years, which he said has caused relations between
Taiwan and Hong Kong to go regress.
</P>
<P>
The Special Administrative Region's government must take full
responsibility for this situation, Chen said.
</P>
<P>
He said Taipei will lodge a strong protest to Hong Kong if no
proper explanation is provided on its latest decision to turn down
Ma's visa application.
</P>
<P>
According to reports by major Hong Kong media, the Special
Administrative Region's government refused to issue Ma a visa because
he had spoken out against mainland China's plan to enact an
"anti-secession law."
</P>
<P>
Chen said Beijing is trying to change the status quo across the
Taiwan Strait unilaterally by introducing the law and that the move
is unacceptable to all people in Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
The denial of entry to Ma proves that Beijing's promise of "one
country, two systems" is nothing but impractical, wishful thinking,
he added.

OVER NT$3 BILLION IN LABOR INSURANCE PAYMENTS FOR INJURED WORKERS
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Jan.  5 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The government paid a total of NT$3.25
billion (US$100 million) in the first 10 months of 2004 in labor
insurance compensation to workers killed or injured in the workplace,
according to recent government statistics.
</P>
<P>
The figure involves some 44,000 cases and represents an annual
increase rate of 9.1 percent in value, the tallies compiled by the
Cabinet-level Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and
Statistics (DGBAS) show.
</P>
<P>
Some NT$1.47 billion of the total figure was paid to workers'
applications for government labor insurance subsidies for treatment
of occupational injuries and sickness, NT$750 million of which went
to 669 cases of death, DGBAS officials said. They noted that 5.4
workers out of every 1,000 were injured at work during the
January-October period.
</P>
<P>
To protect worker interests and boost workplace safety and
economic development, the government enacted the professional injury
protection law in April 2002, providing various types of subsides for
injured workers and their employers. Such government subsidies for
business owners totaled NT$120 million during the same 10-month
period.

FORMER AIT CHAIRWOMAN ARRIVES IN TAIPEI FOR WEEKLONG VISIT
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Jan.  5 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Former American Institute in Taiwan (AIT)
Chairwoman Therese Shaheen arrived in Taipei Wednesday for a weeklong
private visit.
</P>
<P>
Shaheen, who resigned from the post as the top U.S. liaison
officer with Taiwan in the absence formal diplomatic ties in April
2004, said after her arrival from Seoul that she is very happy to
visit Taiwan again.
</P>
<P>
This is Shaheen's second trip to Taiwan since her resignation
from the AIT chairmanship.
</P>
<P>
She is scheduled to meet with President Chen Shui-bian and
Minister of Foreign Affairs Tan Sun Chen Friday to exchange views on
the general international situation and Taiwan-U.S. relations.
</P>
<P>
"President Chen is a nice man," Shaheen said, adding that she has
prepared a "mysterious" gift for Chen's newborn grandson.
</P>
<P>
Despite her departure from public service, Shaheen continues to
maintain close contact with Taiwan's business and political
communities.
</P>
<P>
Shaheen said she will take advantage of her visit to meet with
Legislative Yuan President Wang Jin-pyng, a vice chairman of the
opposition Kuomintang that together with its ally -- the People First
Party -- controls a majority in the legislature, to exchange views on
Taiwan's long-stalled NT$610.8 billion arms procurement package.
</P>
<P>
The opposition-controlled legislature has stonewalled the passage
of the special statute and budget bill for purchasing eight
diesel-electric submarines, a squadron of 12 P-3C Orion
submarine-hunting aircraft and six PAC III Patriot anti-missile
batteries from the United States.
</P>
<P>
Shaheen said she is worried the delay in the passage of the bill
could affect the upgrading of Taiwan's defense capabilities in the
face of mainland China's ever mounting military threat.
</P>
<P>
Asked whether she has brought with her any message from the U.S.
government, Shaheen would not make a direct response but said
cryptically that she has consistently told the truth.
</P>
<P>
Praising Taiwan as a "mature democracy," Shaheen said Taiwan has
contributed much to the world and deserves more world recognition.
Shaheen further said she has been impressed by the hospitality and
warmth of the Taiwan people.
</P>
<P>
During her stay in Seoul, Shaheen said she had been informed of
the passing of Straits Exchange Foundation Chairman Koo Chen-fu,
Taiwan's top negotiator with mainland China.
</P>
<P>
Shaheen said she was saddened to learn of Koo's death. She lauded
him as a kind and thoughtful gentleman who made outstanding
contributions to Taiwan, particularly in helping promote
rapprochement across the Taiwan Strait. Koo died of renal failure
Monday at the age of 88.
</P>
<P>
During her last trip to Taipei in June 2004, President Chen
Shui-bian presented an award of thanks to Shaheen in recognition of
her contributions to promoting Taipei-Washington ties during her time
as the top AIT officer.
</P>
<P>
At the decoration ceremony, Chen lauded Shaheen as one of
Taiwan's best friends and a beautiful guardian angel of the people of
Taiwan.

Taipei-based Mandarin Airlines, a domestic
flight operator, opened Taipei-Kinmen and Taichung-Kinmen routes
Wednesday, becoming the fourth local air company to provide flight
services between Taiwan and the outlying island.
</P>
<P>
A ceremony marking the inauguration of the new flights was held
Wednesday at the Kinmen airport, which was presided over by Mandarin
Airlines President Michael Lo and attended by Civil Aeronautics
Administration Director-General Billy K.C. Chang, Kinmen Magistrate
Lee Chu-feng, New Party Legislator Wu Cheng-tien, and various tourist
industry representatives.
</P>
<P>
Far East Air Transport Corp., Trans Asia Airways and the UNI
Airways Corp. already serve Kinmen, which is considered a golden egg
for the air carriers after the number of the passengers on other
domestic routes has shrunk in recent years.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the number of the travelers between Kinmen and Xiamen,
in mainland China's Fujien Province, surged to a new high of 404,000,
with over 80 percent of those travelers Taiwanese businessmen,
according to Mandarin Airlines.
</P>

Mandarin Airlines offers three flights per day between the
northern Taiwan city of Taipei and Kinmen and three daily flights
between the central Taiwan city of Taichung and Kinmen, according to

TAIWAN TO MONITOR BEIJING-WASHINGTON TALKS ON ANTI-SECESSION LAW
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Jan.  5 (CNA)
(By Luis Huang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An official of the Cabinet-level Mainland
Affairs Council (MAC) said Wednesday that the government will closely
monitor developments in mainland China's communications with the
United States about its plan to enact an anti-secession law.
</P>
<P>
MAC Deputy Chairman Chiu Tai-shan made the remarks a day after
Chen Yunlin, director of the Taiwan Affairs Office under Beijing's
State Council, arrived in Washington to discuss with U.S. officials
the details of the planned anti-secession law targeting Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
The mainland's plan to promulgate an anti-secession law is not
only a tremendous provocation of Taiwan but also a unilateral move to
change the status quo across the Taiwan Strait, Chiu told reporters.
</P>
<P>
Chiu said that the MAC, the top agency in charge of Taiwan's
policies toward the mainland, has expressed on public occasions its
strong opposition to the legislation aimed at legalizing Beijing's
invasion of the country.
</P>
<P>
Stressing that Taiwan is not part of the People's Republic of
China as the Beijing authorities claim, Chiu said this is also the
feeling of a majority of the people of Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Michel Lu, spokesman of the Ministry of Foreign
Affairs, said that officials of the Republic of China representative
office in the United States will keep a close eye on developments.
</P>
<P>
The government will also continue to express its opposition to
the proposed anti-secession law, which, if passed, would offer a
legal basis for Beijing to use force against Taiwan, Lu went on.
</P>
<P>
The Standing Committee of the National People's Congress (NPC)
agreed in late December to submit the draft bill to a NPC plenary
session for deliberation in March this year.

CABINET, PRESIDENTIAL OFFICE AGREE ON REVISED DRAFT REFERENDUM LAW
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Jan. 5 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Premier Yu Shyi-kun said Wednesday there is
a consensus between the Presidential Office and the Executive Yuan
that a revised draft referendum law be submitted to the current
legislature before it ends Jan. 21.
</P>
<P>
The premier made the remarks as the Executive Yuan passed a
revised draft referendum law in a floor meeting.
</P>
<P>
Some media reports said the timing of the Cabinet's passing of
the revised draft law is unfavorable to a proposed reconciliation
between the ruling and opposition parties broached by President Chen
Shui-bian, adding that the Presidential Office was caught off-guard
by the move. Other reports speculated that the move was to counter
mainland China's proposed anti-secession law, which is expected to be
put to a full National People's Congress for reconsideration in
March.
</P>
<P>
Yu explained that the revised draft law would have been submitted
to the legislature in early December, but as some civic groups still
had reservations on some articles, the Executive Yuan had to continue
to communicate with them.
</P>
<P>
Minister without Portfolio Hsu Chih-hsiung said that the current
referendum law is riddled with problems and conflicting articles,
claiming that the referendum screening committee could be
unconstitutional, that there is too high a threshold for signatures
to be collected to establish a referendum issue.
</P>
<P>
The administration will have to make an overall review and
amendment and submit it before the Cabinet resigns en masse and the
new legislature is sworn in Feb. 1 according to constitutional
precedent, Hsu said.
</P>
<P>
The opposition-dominated legislature rammed through the present
Referendum Law in late November 2003.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the ruling Democratic Progressive Party said that the
revised draft law is an extension of an olive branch to the
opposition parties that it hopes will ease confrontation and bring
reconciliation to the rival parties.
</P>
<P>
Ker Chien-ming, DPP whip in the legislature, said the revised law
lowers the threshold of the number of people required to establish or
vote on a referendum issue, and deletes the public's right to
initiate a referendum on issues concerning constitutional amendments,
a section the ruling party initially wanted to include but which was
opposed by the "pan-blue alliance" of the Kuomintang and the People
First Party.
</P>
<P>
DPP Legislator Tsai Huang-liang said it does not matter that the
initiation on issues related to constitutional amendments was not
included in the revised draft law, saying that the DPP will write a
new Constitution in 2006 that will close the loophole.
</P>
<P>
Tsai said that the revised draft law also expands the coverage of
referendum to include changes of the national territory, which he
said is a"pragmatic" approach that will confirm the current territory
of Taiwan and will be in the interests of the people.
</P>
<P>
Tsai said he was baffled by Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou's remarks
that it is "unconstitutional " to put to referendum the issue
concerning the changing of the national territory, adding that the
opposition party should not look at the revised draft law in
a negative light.

TAIWAN TO PURCHASE OVER 400 HELLFIRE MISSILES
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taiwan will purchase more than 400
Hellfire missiles from the United States, worth a total of about
US$50 million, American defense industry sources said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Lockheed Martin Corp. said in a news release that the company
will produce over 600 AGM-114M and AGM-114K Hellfire missiles in line
with its contract with the U.S. Army.
</P>
<P>
According to an agreement between Taiwan and the U.S. Army, the
press statement said, 70 percent of those air-to-ground missiles will
be sold to Taiwan. The statement further said that 5 percent to 10
percent of the Hellfire missiles will be delivered to Israel and the
rest will be used by the U.S. Army.
</P>
<P>
Lockheed Martin Corp. said the company has begun producing the
missiles and is scheduled to complete production in six months.
</P>
<P>
Mark Stenger, director of Lockheed Martin Corp.'s air-to-ground
missile system planning department, said Hellfire missiles are
accurate and that their efficacy has been verified in both
Afghanistan and Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Noting that Hellfire missiles can be used to strike ships, light
armored vehicles and buildings, Stenger said what Taiwan will acquire
will be the world's best air-to-ground weaponry system.
</P>
<P>
Hellfire missiles can be installed on gunships such as Apache
helicopters. With the acquisition of Hellfire missiles, Lockheed
Martin sources said, Taiwan's armed forces can easily get in touch or
conduct joint operations with U.S. overseas ground forces, marines
and special service forces.
</P>
<P>
The Hellfire missile functions like a miniature aircraft,
complete with its own guidance computer, steering and propulsion
system. The payload is a high-explosive, copper-lined-charge powerful
enough to burn through the heaviest tank armor in existence.

SNIFFER DOG STATIONS IN KINMEN TO HELP INSPECTION WORK
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Jan.  5 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Department of Health (DOH) sent a
sniffer dog and his trainer to Kinmen Wednesday in a bid to step up
inspection and quarantine work on the outlying island that lies
closer to mainland China than to Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Yeh Ying, vice director of the Bureau of Animal and Plant
Health Inspection and Quarantine under the DOH, noted at a press
conference that mainland Chinese people made over 200,000 visits to
Kinmen last year using the direct transportation link channel.
</P>
<P>
As the mainland is reported to have rabies, avian influenza,
coddling moth and other animal and plant infectious diseases and
pests, the DOH has had to step up inspection and quarantine work on
the outlying island to ensure the health of Taiwan's agricultural
products and people.
</P>
<P>
Yeh said the sniffer dog, named Jack, will be responsible for
detecting if arriving tourists are carrying contraband fruit,
vegetables or meat.
</P>
<P>
The DOH has since October 2002 stationed four teams of sniffer
dogs at CKS International Airport in Taoyuan and at Hsiaokang
International Airport in Kaohsiung.
</P>
<P>
Jack served at Hsiaokang Airport for more than two years before
being sent to Kinmen and has a detection record of over 90 percent
accuracy. He is trained to detect more than 10 kinds of agricultural
and poultry products, including citrus, mango, apple, chicken, beef
and pork.
</P>
<P>
The dog detected one arriving passenger carrying mainland Chinese
oranges and bananas in his luggage at Kinmen's Shuitou Wharf
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Yeh told the public not to bring any agricultural or poultry
products from the mainland and warned that those who do must submit
them for inspection and quarantine. He also urged the public to
inform on any violations through the toll free phone number
0800039131.

NEARLY 70 PERCENT OF WORKERS PLANNING TO QUIT NEXT MONTH: POLL
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Jan. 5 (CNA)
(By FLor Wang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Nearly 70 percent of Taiwan's employees are
planning to change jobs after the lunar new year holiday in early
February, according to the results of a recent public opinion poll.
</P>
<P>
According to the results of the survey released Tuesday by the
headhunting Web site www.104.com.tw, 31 percent of the respondents
said that they are determined to find a new job after Chinese New
Year, which falls on Feb. 9 this year, while 38 percent said they are
still considering the issue and 15 percent said they do not plan to
quit.
</P>
<P>
About 46 percent of the people polled said that they will change
their jobs immediately if there is a good opportunity, regardless of
year-end bonus, ahead of some 39 percent that will do so only after
having got their bonus, the poll discovered. Only around 8 percent of
the respondents said they will quickly quit upon finding that the
current job does not suit them.
</P>
<P>
The roughly 66,000 people wishing to change jobs at this time of
the year is apparently about 40 percent higher than the previous
year's level, a Web site official said, ascribing the phenomenon to
strong public assumption that the booming domestic economy will
continue into this year.
</P>
<P>
He forecast that the number of job seekers will pick up after the
lunar new year.
</P>
<P>
When asked the reason for their job change plans, 48 percent of
the respondents expressed hope of finding a more promising company
and 47.5 percent pointed to the lack of development at their current
jobs, according to the survey. Low pay, no promotion opportunities
and lax company prospects are among other factors cited.
</P>
<P>
Around 18 percent said that they would stay at their present
company if they were offered a pay raise, followed by possibilities
of learning and career development opportunities.
</P>
<P>
The public opinion survey was carried out by the Web site from
Dec. 23-29, with 1,514 valid questionnaires recovered. It had a
margin of error of 2.6 percent.

TAIWAN FOREIGN RESERVES HIT RECORD US$241.73 billion
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Jan.  5 (CNA)

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taiwan's foreign reserves amounted to a
record high of US$241.73 billion as of the end of 2004, according to
statistics released Wednesday by the Taiwan-based Central Bank of
China.
</P>
<P>
The amount was the world's third-highest after Japan and mainland
China, the statistics show.
</P>
<P>
It was US$2.6 billion higher than the level registered at the end
of November 2004 and US$35.1 billion higher than that of the end of
2003.
</P>
<P>
The increase was mainly due to the rise in the value of the euro
and the British pound, which had appreciated 2.73 percent and 1.96
percent, respectively, against the U.S. dollar during the one month
until Dec. 31, Central Bank officials said.
</P>
<P>
The inflow of foreign capital and investment yield from the
foreign reserves also contributed to the increase, they said.
</P>
<P>
While the foreign reserves of Japan amounted to US$819.14 billion
as of the end of November 2004, those of the mainland came in at
US$514.53 billion as of the end of September 2004, according to the
Central Bank.
</P>
<P>
The foreign reserves of South Korea and Hong Kong totalled
US$198.17 billion and US$124.45 billion, respectively, as of the end

CONSUMER PRICE INDEX FOR DECEMBER UP 1.62 PERCENT
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Jan.  5 (CNA)
(By Luis Huang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taiwan's consumer price index (CPI) for
December stood at 101.34, representing an increase of 0.07 percent
over the previous month's level, the Cabinet-level Directorate
General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics (DGBAS) announced
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The figure also represented a rise of 1.62 percent over the
previous year's level, according to statistics compiled by the DGBAS.
</P>
<P>
For the whole year of 2004, the CPI growth rate was also 1.62
percent, lower than the originally estimated 1.8 percent, said a
DGBAS official, who attributed the result to keen competition in
commodity prices and drops in house rentals triggered by various
preferential measures adopted by the government.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the wholesale price index for December stood at
109.97, representing a monthly drop of 1.37 percent and an annual
rise of 7.06 percent, the DGBAS tallies show.
</P>
<P>
The official said that the decrease in the December CPI index was
mainly because of continued drops in prices for petrochemical
materials, computers and related peripherals, as well as for
electronic parts and components.

The president said he was very happy to meet with the chief of
the 142-year-old world veterinary organization on the eve of Taiwan's
33rd Veterinarians Day.
</P>
<P>
He told his guest that Taiwan was declared a vaccine-using
FMD-free country in May 2003. So long as no FMD cases are reported by

"In 1950, Taiwan managed to eliminate rinderpest or cattle
plague, while rabies has been eliminated since 1959, " Chen said,
adding that Taiwan has also made remarkable achievements in
prevention of avian flu outbreaks, foodstuff hygiene inspection as
well as plant and animal quarantine.

given an equally long time as the lawmakers to field questions and
explain public policies.
</P>

TSUNAMI IMPACT ON TAIWAN ECONOMY SMALL: CEPD
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei, Jan. 5 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The impact on the Taiwan economy of the Dec.
26 earthquake and tsunami that devastated countries in Southeast Asia
and South Asia will be small, a spokesman for the Cabinet-level
Council for Economic Planning and Development (CEPD) said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The CEPD official made the comment on the grounds that economic
ties between Taiwan and the member states of the Association of
Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and India -- major victims of the
appalling catastrophe -- are not very frequent or close.
</P>
<P>
As of the end of Sept. 2004, direct investment from Taiwan in
ASEAN member countries and India totaled US$44.9 billion and US$110
million, respectively.
</P>
<P>
During the first 11 months of last year, Taiwan outbound
shipments to ASEAN countries hit US$20.9 billion, while imports from
that trade bloc reached US$18.6 billion, accounting for 13.1 percent
and 12.2 percent, respectively, of the country's total volumes.
</P>
<P>
In the same 11-month period, Taiwan exports to countries in South
Asia (India and Sri Lanka) were worth US$120 million, while inbound
shipments from the two countries totaled US$800 million, making up
0.8 percent and 0.5 percent of the country's overall levels,
respectively.
</P>
<P>
In view of the relatively low trade volumes, subsequent effects
of the disaster on the domestic economy will be limited, the official
claimed, pointing out that wintering tourists may in turn even flock
to Taiwan and other countries such as Australia and New Zealand.
</P>
<P>
According to foreign wire services, the economic impact of one of
the world's worst natural disasters is expected to be minimal in the
Southeast Asia and South Asia regions in the long term. The
earthquake and killer waves caused no major damage to the
infrastructure of most of the affected countries, the reports added.
</P>
<P>
An economist was reported as saying that the overall impact would
be slight, as no major industrial or infrastructure facilities were
affected.

ROC ENVOY DEMANDS EXPLANATION FOR HONG KONG VISA SNUB
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Hong Kong,  Jan. 5 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taiwan's top representative to Hong Kong
asked the Hong Kong government Wednesday to explain why it rejected
Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou's visa application.
</P>
<P>
Pao Cheng-kang, managing director of Chung Hwa Travel Service,
said the Hong Kong authorities had yet to answer his question as of
Wednesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
As the Hong Kong government reportedly has suggested that Ma's
local sponsor, the University of Hong Kong, postpone its invitation
to Ma until April, Pao said there may still be a chance the Hong Kong
authorities might change their decision. In any case, Pao said, the
Republic of China government will make an appropriate response after
receiving an explanation from the Hong Kong authorities.
</P>
<P>
Ma was originally scheduled to visit Hong Kong Jan.11-13, but the
Hong Kong authorities declined to issue him a visa. The move drew
broadsides from the Hong Kong media.
</P>
<P>
In Taipei, Cabinet spokesman Chen Chi-mai said that if the Hong
Kong government fails to give a reasonable explanation, the ROC
government will lodge a protest.
</P>
<P>
Pao said people in both Taiwan and Hong Kong want normal
exchanges between the two sides. "We hope the Hong Kong authorities
can explain its stance on the issue," he added.
</P>
<P>
Ma was invited to deliver a speech on the rise of Chinese urban
development from Taipei's perspective at the University of Hong Kong
Jan. 11 and to attend a Taipei tourism promotion activity and seminar
at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology Jan. 12.
</P>
<P>
Ma, who was born in the former British territory, said Wednesday
that the Hong Kong government's denial of his visa application has
prompted him to think that Taiwan-Hong Kong relations are regressing.
</P>
<P>
He recalled that during a visit he made to Hong Kong four years
ago, he held a 90-minute meeting with Hong Kong Chief Executive Tung
Chee Hwa. "And now I cannot even secure a permit to enter Hong Kong.
What a big change in our bilateral relations," Ma said.
</P>
<P>
According to Hong Kong media reports, Ma was denied entry to Hong
Kong probably because of his opposition to Beijing's "anti-secession
law."

INDONESIA REJECTS TAIWAN'S REQUEST TO ATTEND RELIEF CONFERENCE
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Medan, Indonesia, Jan. 5 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Indonesia has turned down Taiwan's
request to take part in an international conference Thursday in
Jakarta to coordinate relief efforts for the tsunami-hit nations
around the Indian Ocean.
</P>
<P>
An anonymous official from Taiwan's representative office in
Jakarta told CNA Wednesday that the conference organized by the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) , is open only to the
member states of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN)
and the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
Since Taiwan is not a member of either body, Indonesia, which is
hosting the conference, has no intention of inviting Taiwan despite
the country's promise of generous aid to countries ravaged by a
magnitude-9.0 earthquake Dec. 26 in Indonesia and the subsequent
tsunami it triggered.
</P>
<P>
The Jakarta conference was initiated by Singapore Premier Lee
Hsien Loong. In addition to ASEAN leaders, Japanese Prime Minister
Junichiro Koizumi, Australian Prime Minister John Howard, mainland
Chinese Prime Minister Wen Jiabao, New Zealand Prime Minister Helen
Clark, South Korean Prime Minister Lee Hae-chan, U.S. Secretary of
State Colin Powell and E.U. Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso
will also attend the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Republic of China Foreign Minister Tan Sun Chen said in Taipei
the previous day that his country would be content with a chance to
sit in on the conference as an observer.
</P>
<P>
Noting that Taiwan, which has promised US$50 million in aid to
the disaster-hit nations, is the world's eighth-biggest single donor
thus far, Chen said Taiwan deserves a seat at the conference table,
adding that he hopes Indonesia will help Taiwan get into the
conference.

BANDA ACEH, Indonesia (AFP) -- World leaders
headed Wednesday to Indonesia to see first-hand the
massive operation to save millions of tsunami victims
as the United Nations suggested the catastrophe could
end up being one of the deadliest natural disasters
ever recorded.

The Philippine Daily Inquirer: 50 Filipinos

SOME 50 Filipinos working in a coastal
entertainment spot in Burma (Myanmar) were safe
following the deadly tsunamis that struck countries
along the Indian Ocean, Foreign Secretary Alberto
Romulo yesterday said.

U.S. REITERATES SUPPORT FOR PEACEFUL RESOLUTION OF CROSS-STRAIT ISSUES

<P>
The U.S. State Department on Wednesday
reiterated its long-standing position in support of a peaceful
resolution of differences between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait.
</P>
<P>
According to the State Department, Deputy Secretary of State
Richard Armitage met with Chen Yunlin, director of the Taiwan Affairs
Office under Beijing's State Council, the same day and had a candid,
informative and constructive discussion on various cross-strait
issues, including mainland China's proposed "anti-secession law."
</P>
<P>
"We conveyed the long-standing position of the United States that
the two sides [of the Taiwan Strait] should engage in dialogue to
peacefully resolve their differences," the State Department said.
</P>
<P>
It also said that "neither side should do anything that
unilaterally changes the status quo or complicates management of this
sensitive issue."
</P>
<P>
The purpose of Chen's visit in Washington, D.C. was to explain
Beijing's proposed "anti-secession law" to U.S. authorities, although
he did not bring the draft of the law with him.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan's ranking officials in charge of mainland affairs have
said that mainland China's plan to promulgate such a law is not only
a provocation of Taiwan but also a unilateral move to change the
status quo across the Taiwan Strait.

KMT OFFICIALS TO GO TO MAINLAND FOR TALKS ON HOLIDAY CHARTER FLIGHTS
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Jan. 6 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The opposition Kuomintang (KMT) will send a
delegation to Beijing shortly to help the private sector arrange
direct charter flights across the Taiwan Strait during the upcoming
Chinese Lunar New Year holiday for mainland-based Taiwan business
people, KMT spokesman Chang Jung-kung said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Chang said that he, KMT Central Polity Committee CEO Tseng
Yung-chuan and KMT Legislators John Chang and Chu Feng-chih will
accompany representatives from six Taiwan airlines to Beijing,
hopefully prior to Jan. 15, to meet officials from the Civil Aviation
Administration of China for talks.
</P>
<P>
Chang Jung-kung stressed that the KMT will mainly play the role
of "conduit" to accelerate the charter flight arrangements. There is
just over a month before new year's day, which falls on Feb. 9 this
year.
</P>
<P>
Mainland authorities earlier demanded that both mainland and
Taiwan carriers be allowed to operate cross-strait charter flights to
three mainland destinations -- Shanghai, Beijing and Guangzhou. Given
the time constraint and the need to make the necessary arrangements,
it is likely that not all of the mainland's demands can be met, Chang
Jung-kung said.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, he said that the most feasible way of implementing the
program would be to model it after the system used in 2003 in which
only Taiwan carriers operated the special charter flight services and
only to Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
He said that there is some hope that Beijing will assent to the
proposal and add on Beijing and Guangzhou to the flight list, adding
that making the routes truly non-stop would be a bonus.
</P>
<P>
The service that was in place in 2003 was "direct" only in name
as flights had to stop first in either Hong Kong of Macau; however,
unlike regular flights where passengers had to change planes in these
third places, the "direct" flights allowed passengers to remain on
the same plane they had boarded, the stopover being more of a
formality than a necessity.
</P>
<P>
The KMT claimed Jan. 2 that with the consent of relevant
government authorities, non-stop, two-way, three-destination
cross-strait charter flights could start "at any time."
</P>
<P>
The 2003 Chinese Lunar New Year holiday services were offered by
six carriers from Taiwan, but were discontinued the following year
because Beijing insisted that mainland carriers also be allowed to
provide the same flight services but refused to negotiate the
necessary technical details with Taiwan.

PUBLIC URGED TO DONATE BLOOD TO MAKE UP FOR SEASONAL SHORTAGE
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei, Jan. 6 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taiwan Blood Services Foundation on Thursday
appealed for the public to donate blood, saying that all six of the
island's blood banks are running low.
</P>
<P>
Foundation Chairman Lin Kuo-hsin made the appeal at a news
conference to announce the beginning of a month-long blood donation
drive starting Friday. A letter from President Chen Shui-bian urging
the public to donate blood was also read.
</P>
<P>
Lin noted that blood banks in Taipei, Hsinchu, Taichung, Tainan,
Kaohsiung and Hualien have less than a one-week safe supply each.
The blood bank in Taipei has less than a five-day stock.
</P>
<P>
Lin said the public donated 2.33 million units (one unit equals
250 cc) in 2004, which met medical needs. But he said that there is
always a seasonal supply and demand imbalance, adding that blood
shortages often occur during the Chinese Lunar New Year holiday.
</P>
<P>
Chang Ying-er, chief executive officer of the foundation, said
that with the declining birth rate, the reform of compulsory military
service and the busy schedule of students, young people are less
inclined to donate blood, a shortfall that will have to be make up by
the general public. He said that "new blood" is urgently needed.
</P>
<P>
In line with the blood donation drive, E.Sun Bank has announced
that it will give points to blood donors which they can redeem for
gifts, while Noble Family steakhouse and a dumpling restaurant also
said that they would give discounts or coupons to those who donate
blood.

WANTED MAN EXTRADITED TO TAIWAN TO FACE CHARGES OF FRAUD

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A man wanted in Taiwan for fraud since
August 2003 was escorted back to the country from Palau, sources from
the Ministry of Justice Investigation Bureau (MJIB) said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Chiang Kuang-yeh was escorted by police back to Taipei from the
South Pacific island country around noon Thursday and was immediately
taken into custody by the MJIB.
</P>
<P>
According to MJIB investigators, Chiang began to run
advertisements in major daily newspapers in Taiwan to attract
investments in the Palau Evergreen International Hotel, which the ad
claimed to be a failsafe investment with investors enjoying ownership
of units in the hotel and having guaranteed regular returns on their
investment.
</P>
<P>
An unknown number of investors around Taiwan discovered that they
had been conned after the hotel ran an ad several months later to
announce that the hotel had never authorized Chiang to raise money in
Taiwan nor contracted him to be a sales manager.
</P>
<P>
Chiang fled Taiwan and was reported to have been living mainly in
Palau.
</P>
<P>
The amount of money involved is not known.
</P>
<P>
After the Taipei District Prosecutors' Office issued a warrant
for Chiang's arrest on Aug. 23, 2003, the Palau government expressed
its willingness on Oct. 19 of the same year to help Taiwan police
round up Chiang.
</P>
<P>
The cooperative efforts in successfully having Chiang returned to
Taiwan to face justice were made by officials from the two sides in
charge of affairs of the Asia Pacific Group on Money Laundering, in
which both Taiwan and Palau are full members.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan and Palau, which have formal diplomatic relations, are
also shortly expected to sign an agreement on cooperation for the
exchange of intelligence related to money laundering and terrorist
financing, MJIB officials said.

Wang, also a KMT vice chairman, said that no one knows the true

He said that Lien had kept abreast of the situation, but has made
no decision on the matter. However, according to Wang, Lien did say
that he was amenable to the idea if the DPP was sincere.

PRESIDENT CHEN TO VISIT NATIONS IN SOUTH PACIFIC

<P>
President Chen Shui-bian will visit ROC
allies in the South Pacific later this month and attend the
inauguration ceremony of the president of Palau, officials of the
Presidential Office said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The officials said that President Chen will leave Taiwan Jan. 27,
to attend the inauguration ceremony of Tommy Remengesau, Jr. on Jan.
28, and then go to one or two allies in the South Pacific.
</P>
<P>
During his trip, the president's plane could refuel in either
Guam or Saipan.
</P>
<P>
The officials said that the president will visit all five allies
of Taiwan in the South Pacific -- Palau, the Solomon Islands, Tuvalu,
Kiribati and the Marshall Islands. If this is not possible, he will
probably visit the remaining countries in the latter half of the
year.
</P>
<P>
The officials said that the president should be able to visit one
or two other allies in addition to Palau, saying that a working team
is currently in the South Pacific to assess and arrange for the
visit, and the countries th president will visit will be finalized
after the team's return.
</P>
<P>
The team reported that Tuvalu could be difficult as it has a
small airport, and only one hotel with 30 rooms, and couldn't
possibly accommodate the large entourage of the president.
</P>
<P>
Most of the airport facilities of ROC allies in the South
Pacific cannot accommodate takeoffs and landings of large aircraft,
so China Airlines will use a 737 passenger plane for the trip.

DEATH BY OVERWORK CRITERIA LOWERED BY LABOR COUNCIL
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Jan. 6 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The criteria for deciding when a death or a
physical breakdown has come about as a result of overwork has been
lowered now that the Council of Labor Affairs (CLA) has revised
pertinent regulations.
</P>
<P>
After taking complaints from private organizations and
suggestions from specialist groups into account, the CLA amended the
existing regulations regarding occupational diseases and deaths.
</P>
<P>
An official with the CLA's Department of Labor Safety and Health
said that the standard for reaching a verdict of death by overwork,
known in Japan as "karoshi, " and serious medical conditions, such as
a stroke, will not be based solely on work hours now and that other
occupational factors will also be included when such a case is
judged.
</P>
<P>
Other occupational factors include irregular work times and work
patterns; abnormally long working hours; frequently on business
trips; work based on shifts; nighttime jobs and highly intensive work
over long periods of time, the official said.
</P>
<P>
The CLA considers a death to have been caused by overwork when
the victim had worked more than 100 hours on extra work during the
month prior to his death or if he or she died on the job.
</P>
<P>
Several private groups protested to the CLA in April last year
against the government's harsh standards for judging when death is
the result of overwork.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the Taiwan Association for Victims of
Occupational Injuries (TAVOI) said that it is unacceptably harsh that
the CLA regulates that a verdict of death by overwork can only be
applied when an employee has worked for 24 hours continuously before
dying or has worked for over 16 hours every day one week before
dying.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the Confederation of Taipei Trade Unions also
pointed out that the CLA criteria was too narrow, as they relate
largely to diseases as the cause of death, but barely mention any
reasons concerning working conditions and other social and
psychological factors that could be involved.
</P>
<P>
Many causes of death, including heart attack, stroke and suicide,
can be the result of pressure from overworking, but were excluded
from the CLA criteria, the spokesman said.

<P>
A medical team organized by the Taipei city
government is set to leave for Indonesia Friday to help victims of
the Dec. 26 earthquake and tsunami disaster.
</P>
<P>
The 16-member team led by Ko Ming-chung, head of the Taipei
Municipal Chung Hsing Hospital, will fly first to Medan on the island
of Sumatra and then go to worst-hit Aceh province.
</P>
<P>
The team plans to stay there for one week.
</P>
<P>
Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou Thursday expressed hope that the team
members will serve as Taiwan goodwill ambassadors and provide relief
to the tsunami victims.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that rescue teams from 38 countries came to Taiwan
after the disastrous earthquake of Sept. 21, 1999 and added that
Taiwan must not sit idly when a disaster has occurred in another
country.

MAINLAND CHINA CARRIERS TO BE ALLOWED TO RUN NEW YEAR CHARTER FLIGHTS
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei, Jan. 6 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
To be on par with their Taiwan counterparts,
mainland Chinese carriers are in principle allowed to offer special
lunar new year charter flight services for Taiwan businessmen wishing
to return to Taiwan for the holiday period, a government spokesman
said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Chen Chi-mai, spokesman for the Executive Yuan, said that
mainland-based aviation companies will be allowed to offer the
flights as long as the two sides can reach a final agreement in this
regard.
</P>
<P>
Chen added, however, that Taiwan has yet to receive any formal
applications by mainland airlines seeking to offer the special
flights between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait, nor has the
government been informed of the situation by the Civil Aviation
Administration of China.
</P>
<P>
Chen's remarks came after local media reported that Xiamen
Airlines has gained approval from Hong Kong to operate Xiamen-Taipei
and Xiamen-Kaohsiung charter flights for homebound and returning
Taiwan businessmen and their dependents in the new year holiday
season early next month.
</P>
<P>
According to the Cabinet spokesman, Taiwan and the mainland have
forged much common ground on the model for "non stop, round trip"
flights by carriers on both sides."
</P>
<P>
The Cabinet-level Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) has commissioned
the Taipei Airlines Association to hold technical talks with the
mainland side to clear the way for the service, he noted.
</P>
<P>
The special flights were launched for the first time in 2003
using only Taiwan carriers, but the service failed to proceed in 2004
due to the mainland's insistence on mainland carriers being allowed
to also offer flights and its refusal to hold technical talks on the
issue as a result of cross-strait tension.
</P>
<P>
There have been no direct trade, transport and postal links
between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait since 1949, when the
now-opposition Kuomintang lost a civil war to communist forces and
fled to Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
To compensate for the absence of the links, the Kinmen and Matsu
islands held by Taiwan initiated direct trade and transport services
with the Xiamen and Mamei ports in mainland China's Fujian Province
on a trial basis starting from Jan. 1, 2001 -- commonly known as the
"three mini links."

PRESIDENT TO VISIT PALAU, SOLOMON ISLANDS

Taipei,  Jan.  6 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President Chen Shui-bian will visit Palau
and the Solomon Islands -- two of the Republic of China's allies in
the South Pacific -- later this month, Foreign Affairs Minister Tan
Sun Chen said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Chen said the president will leave Jan. 27 for the visit and will
visit three other ROC allies in the South Pacific at a later date.
</P>
<P>
Chen made the remarks on the sidelines of a donation ceremony in
Taoyuan, northern Taiwan, of relief supplies by 16 non-governmental
organizations bound for the tsunami-affected areas in South Asia and
Southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
Chen said the president had originally wanted to visit all five
allies in the South Pacific -- which also include Kiribati, Tuvalu
and the Marshall Islands -- but out of consideration of the imminent
Cabinet reshuffle and various other factors, he was unable to.
</P>
<P>
This will be his second official overseas visit since he assumed
his second term as president May 20. He visited the Central American
states of Panama and Belize in early September.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister said that Chen will attend the inauguration
ceremony of President Tommy Remengesau, Jr. Jan. 28 before going on
to the Solomon Islands.
</P>
<P>
In line with constitutional precedent, the premier and Cabinet
must resign before a new Legislative Yuan is sworn in. Premier Yu
Shyi-kun said Wednesday that he and his Cabinet will bow out Jan. 24.
The new legislature will be sworn in Feb. 1.

FORMER AIT CHAIRWOMAN URGES TAIWAN TO SHOW RESOLVE TO DEFEND ITSELF
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei, Jan. 6 (CNA)
(By Y.F. Low)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Visiting former American Institute in Taiwan
(AIT) Chairwoman Therese Shaheen urged Taiwan Thursday to show the
world its resolve to defend itself by speeding up its NT$610.8
billion (US$18.23 billion) arms procurement deal with the United
States.
</P>
<P>
Shaheen said the deal is one of the crucial factors in
Taiwan-U.S. relations.
</P>
<P>
It upsets Washington to see Taipei keep issuing inflammatory
rhetoric that is likely to intensify tension across the Taiwan Strait
when the budget bill for the arms procurement is being shelved by the
Legislative Yuan, Shaheen said.
</P>
<P>
The arms procurement package includes eight diesel-electric
submarines, a squadron of 12 P-3C Orion submarine-hunting aircraft
and six Patriot PAC-3 anti-missile batteries.
</P>
<P>
In what has raised much discussion in Taiwan, U.S. Deputy
Secretary of State Richard Armitage said last month that Taiwan is
"probably the biggest landmine" in Washington-Beijing relations.
</P>
<P>
Armitage also said that the Taiwan Relations Act requires the
United States to maintain sufficient force in the Pacific to be able
to deter attack but does not require the country to defend Taiwan
should it come under attack from the mainland.
</P>
<P>
There has been speculation that Armitage's remarks were related
to the delay of the arms procurement package by Taiwan's opposition
and announcements by President Chen Shui-bian that he plans to hold a
referendum in 2006 for a new constitution and to change the names of
Republic of China overseas missions and state-run enterprises in two
years.
</P>
<P>
Shaheen, who resigned in April 2004 from the AIT post as the top
Washington liaison officer with Taipei in the absence of diplomatic
ties, arrived in Taiwan Wednesday for a weeklong private visit.
</P>
<P>
This is her second trip to Taiwan since her resignation.

FM REGRETS TAIWAN'S EXCLUSION FROM TSUNAMI RELIEF SUMMIT
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Jan.  6 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Minister of Foreign Affairs Tan San Chen
voiced his regret Thursday over Taiwan's exclusion from a world
tsunami relief summit to be held in Jakarta, saying that his ministry
will try to talk separately with each of the attending countries
afterward.
</P>
<P>
Chen made the comment after taking part in a charity activity in
northern Taoyuan County to aid tsunami refugees in South and
Southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
Strongly lamenting Taiwan's absence from the international
meeting organized by the Association of Southeast Asian Nations
(ASEAN), Chen said that the Foreign Ministry will continue to express
the country's keen desire to participate in the global relief
efforts.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the ASEAN member states, Australia, Japan,
mainland China, New Zealand, South Korea, the European Union and the
United States are also involved in the cross-border aid campaign.
</P>
<P>
According to Chen, Taiwan has asked the United States to help
seek consent from the participating countries for its participation
in the drive, but no concrete response has been given so far.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia turned down Taiwan's request to attend the meeting as
an observer prior to its start, saying reason that ASEAN includes no
observers.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan is the world's 8th-largest donor toward the disaster
relief, having promised to contribute US$50 million in aid to
countries hit by the Dec. 26 earthquake and ensuing tsunami -- one of
the world's worst natural catastrophes that has killed nearly 160,000
people so far.

ECONOMIC AFFAIRS MINISTER INSPECTS YUNLIN INDUSTRIAL PARK
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Jan.  6 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Economic Affairs Minister Ho Mei-yueh
expressed hope Thursday that Formosa Plastics Group (FPG) and the
state-run Chinese Petroleum Corp. (CPC) can engage in positive
competition as she inspected an industrial park in Yunlin County,
southern Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Ho made the remarks as both domestic giants have expressed keen
interests in the park, which is built on land reclaimed from the sea.
</P>
<P>
CPC wants to build a petrochemical science park that will require
1,800 hectares of land and an investment of NT$370 billion (US$11.56
billion), while FPG has announced that it intends to invest NT$130
billion to build a steel refinery requiring 600 hectares.
</P>
<P>
As the land eyed by both groups overlaps, the economic affairs
minister, Industrial Development Bureau (IDB) Director-General Chen
Chao-yih, and Legislators Hsu Su-po and Chiu Tsui-tseng went to the
industrial park Thursday for an inspection.
</P>
<P>
The petrochemical park planned by the CPC would have complete
upper-, middle- and down-stream sectors to naphtha cracker plants,
and the private sector is interested in the project, sources said.
</P>
<P>
Ho therefore invited representatives of both CPC and FPG for a
consultation in the hope that both projects can be carried out
through a series of land adjustments.
</P>
<P>
Ho also noted that the IDB has commissioned consultants to
analyse the possibility of both projects, hoping that both groups
will not vie for the same land. If this is impossible, the ministry
will have to resort to the timing of the applications to give
priority, or putting the land to a bid to settle the dilemma, she
added.
</P>
<P>
Reports have said that the Yunlin park has become suddenly "hot"
mainly because the Kyoto Protocol will take effect in February and the
government will have to start to monitor CO2 emissions, which will
present uncertainties to energy-consuming big investment projects.
</P>
<P>
The Yunlin industrial park has already completed its
environmental impact assessment a long time ago, which will
dramatically shorten the needed time of interested parties to build
factories there.

PRESIDENT'S TOP AIDE SOLICITS SUPPORT FOR DPP CHAIRMAN BID
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Jan.  6 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The secretary-general of the Presidential
Office started an islandwide trip in Taichung, central Taiwan,
Thursday to solicit support for his unopposed bid for the
chairmanship of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP).
</P>
<P>
The election of the party chairman will be held Jan. 30 and
although Su Tseng-chang is the sole candidate in the by-election, he
decided to travel around the island at the suggestion of the DPP
Central Standing Committee to display his sincerity by meeting with
grassroots party members, as well as to solicit their support and
increase his votes.
</P>
<P>
Su is not relying on the party machinery to assist him in the
islandwide get-out-the-vote drive but instead has adopted a low
profile and will mostly meet the members of DPP local branches at a
series of year-end banquets.
</P>
<P>
The by-election became necessary after President Chen Shui-bian,
who concurrently served as party chairman, stepped down to take
responsibility for the party's worse-than-expected performance in the
Dec. 11 legislative elections. The DPP garnered 89 seats, less than
the original estimate of more than 100 seats in the 225-member
Legislative Yuan.

POLICE CALL FOR PUBLIC AWARENESS OF SMUGGLED ANIMALS AFTER TSUNAMI
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Jan.  6 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Out of serious concern over a possible
massive breakout of contagious disease in the wake of the Dec. 26
tsunami in South Asia and Southeast Asia, police urged the Taiwan
people Thursday not to buy smuggled and unquarantined animals, in
order to secure public hygiene.
</P>
<P>
Police authorities made the call after agents of the Criminal
Investigation Bureau and the Kaohsiung Harbor Bureau broke a
smuggling case in the early hours of that day involving more than
1,000 rare birds and dogs worth millions of new Taiwan dollars.
</P>
<P>
Police launched the operation acting on a tip-off that criminal
rings were sneaking in large numbers of dogs and protected birds from
countries in Southeast Asia via fishing or cargo vessels.
</P>
<P>
Police arrested a 61-year-old man, surnamed Tong, in the raid, as
the man was preparing to leave in a small truck after having
successfully taken delivery of the animals outside a wharf at the
harbor.
</P>
<P>
A total of 40 boxes containing the birds and dogs were
intercepted by police on the spot.
</P>
<P>
Tong acknowledged in a statement to police that a man nicknamed
"A Chi" provided him with the animals. According to Tong, "A Chi" got
the animals on board his boat from an "unknown fishing boat" anchored
off Kaohsiung Harbor.
</P>
<P>
An initial police investigation shows that the animals were
smuggled in from Southeast Asian countries.
</P>
<P>
Without having been quarantined by Taiwan customs, they could be
carriers of many different contagious diseases, police said, urging
the public to refrain from purchasing smuggled pets or animals from
abroad at the current time of high alert.

As long as a consensus can be reached

the government's arms purchase budget, the passage of the budget and
a special statute for the arms purchase will cruise through the
legislature, Legislative Yuan President Wang Jin-pyng said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Wang, who met with President Chen Shui-bian for one hour earlier
that day, said Chen expressed concern about the legislature's debate

urged the Legislative Yuan to act on the issue as soon as possible.

Wang said he told the president that as long as the ruling and
opposition parties can agree upon the items and prices in the deal,
the budget is sure to be passed before the legislative session
finishes at the end of this month.
</P>
<P>
The opposition parties that control the Legislative Yuan
boycotted the budget on the grounds that it was listed as a special
budget and therefore was not governed by the law on government
budgets. The opposition also complained about the price of the deal,
branding it unreasonably high.
</P>
<P>
The proposed purchase includes Patriot missiles, submarines and

Manila Bulletin: UN to lead
tsunami relief operations

JAKARTA (Reuters and AP) -- An effort by the
United States, Japan, India, and Australia to
coordinate tsunami relief will be disbanded and folded
into the broader United Nations-led operations, US
Secretary of State Colin Powell said Thursday.

The Philippine Daily Inquirer: Gov't to sell
bonds to OFWs in US to raise P5.6B 

THE OFFICE of External Affairs (OEA), an agency
created by Malacanang just three months ago, plans to
raise more than $100 million (at least P5.6 billion)
by selling "Makabayan Investment Certificates" to
overseas Filipino workers (OFWs) in the United States,

RENEWED U.S. BEEF IMPORTS TO TAIWAN KEY: AGRICULTURE SECRETARY NOMINEE
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
U.S. Secretary of Agriculture nominee
Michael Johnns pledged Thursday that he will do all he can to get
Taiwan and Japan to lift their import bans on U.S. beef imports if
the U.S. House of Senate approves his nomination.
</P>
<P>
Johnns made the pledge in response at a hearing held by the house
to examine his nomination to a senator's question regarding whether
he is capable of urging Taiwan and Japan to reopen their markets to
U.S. beef.
</P>
<P>
According to the senator, the ban imposed by many countries,
including Taiwan and Japan, on imports of U.S. beef since the
appearance of a case of mad cow disease in the United States in
December 2003 has jeopardized the interests of the U.S. livestock
industry and related sectors.
</P>
<P>
Although the ROC and Japan governments have promised to consider
opening their market to U.S. beef imports since Washington agreed to
guarantee the quality of U.S. beef and beef products, the two
countries have done nothing about the matter, the senator said.
</P>
<P>
Johnns said that he would prioritize upgrading U.S. meat safety
standards and re-opening the international market to U.S. beef
imports.
</P>
<P>
Japan was the largest importer of U.S. beef before it imposed a
ban in 2003, with annual beef imports from the United States of more
than US$1.4 billion, or more than 30 percent of total U.S. beef
exports.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan was the sixth-largest importer of U.S. beef, with annual
imports from the United States of US$325 million in 2003.

<P>
Judicial Yuan President Weng Yueh-sheng
lauded the Republic of China Association of Women Judges Friday for
its achievements in helping boost Taiwan's relations with the world
judicial community.
</P>
<P>
Weng made the commendation at a ceremony marking the 10th
anniversary of the ROC women judges association.
</P>
<P>
Through concerted efforts of its members, Weng said, the
association has managed to join the International Association of
Women Judges (IAWJ) and made outstanding contributions to the
prestigious world organization.
</P>
<P>
IAWJ President Jane Mathews, an Australian judge, Arline Pacht, a
retired U.S. judge who was IAWJ's founding president, and several
other IAWJ executives are in Taipei to attend the ROC association's
10th anniversary.
</P>
<P>
The IAWJ is a non-governmental organization founded in 1991 to
group women judges in different judicial systems to promote social
justice and rule of law. The organization now has more than 4,000
members in 86 countries.
</P>
<P>
The ROC women judges association was founded in 1995. As its
designation bears the ROC's national title, its members have
repeatedly encountered mainland China's interference and have closed
them out of the biennial IAWJ meetings. The association later reached
an agreement with the IAWJ to change its designation to the "Taiwan
Chapter of the IAWJ" in the world organization.

TAIWANESE OPEN THEIR HEARTS TO SEND 3 SICK BOYS TO U.S. FOR TREATMENT
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Kaohsiung, southern Taiwan, Jan. 7 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Answering a father's cry
for help over the Internet to save his three sons suffering from the
rare disorder called adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD) , citizens of Taiwan
responded overwhelmingly by donating NT$64 million (US$1.98 million)
in just three days.
</P>
<P>
Astounded by what he said was "an unbelievable outpouring of
empathy and compassion" by the people of Taiwan, Chang Ming-hui, an
official with the Kaohsiung City Government in charge of laws and
regulations, wept on his knees at a news conference at his home
Thursday, saying that he owes more than a debt of gratitude to
everyone and that he hopes that one day no one in Taiwan will fall
victim to the fatal genetic disease that specifically targets boys.
</P>
<P>
Chang and his wife, schoolteacher Su Ting-chu, called for people
from around the island to stop sending them money since they now have
not only enough to allow their 13-year-old eldest son to go to the
United States for treatment, but also the other two younger sons, all
of them hoping to be cured by the so-called Lorenzo's oil.
</P>
<P>
Chang and Su previously planned to seek some NT$5 million to only
allow the 13-year-old Chien-hsuan to receive treatment, mainly a bone
marrow transplant, in the United States after the eldest son began
recently to show early symptoms, including staggering, that were
similar to those displayed by their second son, Po-chun, nearly two
years ago.
</P>
<P>
Twelve-year-old Po-chun is now believed to be in the late stage
of ALD, with his body "shrinking" quickly after suffering complete
paralysis and losing the ability to speak as a result of the disease.
</P>
<P>
ALD is still not fully understood even in the most advanced
medical centers in the United States.
</P>
<P>
Taking Chien-hsuan and the youngest son, five-year-old Sen-ning,
to the Veterans General Hospital in Taichung for examinations several
months ago, Chang and Su only found that the first and third sons
have dysadrenia, a possible precursor to progressive degenerative
myelin disorder, meaning that myelin, the "insulation" around nerves,
breaks down over time.
</P>
<P>
The five-member Chang family applied for visas Friday to travel
to the state of Minnesota in hopes that they can reach the medical
center of Minnesota State University prior to the end of January to
have all three boys treated.
</P>
<P>
Kaohsiung Mayor Frank Hsieh visited the Changs at their home
Thursday. Giving Chang an envelope containing one month of his salary
of NT$170,000 (US$5,247).
</P>
<P>
After seeking medical help around the island, Chang was told to
contact Dr. Hugo Moser of the Kennedy Krieger Institute in Baltimore,
Maryland, who was portrayed in the movie Lorenzo's Oil, for help.
</P>
<P>
The Changs were told by Moser to first have the eldest boy
receive a bone marrow transplant at the Minnesota State University
Medical Center, which would cost US$500,000. The eldest son would
have an 80 percent chance of being cured after receiving the
transplant.
</P>
<P>
Chang will give part of his marrow to Chien-hsuan for the
transplant.
</P>
<P>
Moser presented the results of a long-term study on the
preventive efficacy of Lorenzo's oil in September 2002.
</P>
<P>
While admitting that Lorenzo's oil can normalize the level of
very long chain fatty acids, the metabolite accumulating in ALD, most
doctors in the U.S. medical community have denied for many years its
therapeutic value.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Augusto Odone, one of the two inventors of Lorenzo's oil, has
forging ahead with The Myelin Project. If it is successful, it will
help not only the children with leukodystrophies, but also adults who
suffer from multiple sclerosis in whom the myelin sheath is similarly
destroyed.

WAN HAI DONATES NT$18 MILLION TO TSUNAMI CHILD SPONSORSHIP PROGRAM
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Wan Hai Lines Ltd. on Friday donated
NT$18 million (US$560,258) to a sponsorship program launched by the
Government Information Office (GIO) to help children in countries
affected by the Dec. 26 earthquake and tsunami disaster.
</P>
<P>
GIO Director-General Lin Chia-lung said the donation is the
largest amount received by the government and he hope the private
sector will continue to contribute to the cause.
</P>
<P>
The GIO plans to support 10,000 children under the program, with
each child to be provided with NT$1,000 per month over a three-year
period.
</P>
<P>
Of the total of NT$360 million that the program requires, NT$180
million will be provided by the government and the rest will be
raised from the private sector, Lin said.
</P>
<P>
He said the GIO will send workers to solicit donations in public
facilities such as railway stations and department stores in major
cities islandwide on Jan. 14 and will hold a charity bazaar and
charity concert at Taipei's Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hall on Jan. 15.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the public donations received by the Red Cross Society
of the Republic of China and World Vision Taiwan had reached NT$250
million and NT$110 million, respectively, as of Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Red Cross Society of ROC Secretary-General Hau Lung-bin said it
costs about NT$1,000 to supply clean water, food and medical services
to one tsunami victim for six to eight months and that his
organization hopes to help as many victims as possible.
</P>
<P>
World Vision Taiwan leader Tu Ming-han said World Vision
International has dispatched 3,000 workers to tsunami-hit countries,
with 200,000 families having received help.
</P>
<P>
While the relief efforts prioritize the supply of clean water,
food and medical services at present, long-term living assistance
such as reconstruction of homes and schools will be the main concern
in the next stage, Tu said.

FORMER AIT CHAIRWOMAN MEETS WITH FOREIGN MINISTER
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei, Jan. 7 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Visiting former American Institute in Taiwan
(AIT) Chairwoman Therese Shaheen met with Minister of Foreign Affairs
Tan Sun Chen Friday for wide-ranging talks.
</P>
<P>
Chen said after his hour-long talk that Shaheen is
very supportive of Taiwan and promised to bring more foreign friends
to Taiwan to help them better understand Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
"Shaheen told me that many foreign people have never been to
Taiwan and tend to perceive Taiwan as a stark and barren place where
'birds cannot lay eggs, '" Chen said, adding that he agrees with
Shaheen's views that if more foreign people visit Taiwan, they will
become more supportive of Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Asked whether they had discussed Taiwan's NT$610.8 billion arms
procurement plan and relations across the Taiwan Strait, Chen said
no.
</P>
<P>
Instead, Chen said Shaheen had told him that many foreigners do
not understand Taiwan and that frequent bickering between Taiwan's
ruling and opposition parties has inevitably affected foreign
people's views about Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Shaheen, who resigned in April 2004 from the AIT post as the top
U.S. liaison officer with Taiwan in the absence of diplomatic ties,
arrived in Taipei Wednesday for a weeklong private visit. This is her
second trip to Taiwan since her resignation.
</P>
<P>
Speculation has it that her visit might be related to lobbying
Taiwan's legislature to pass the budget bill for the huge arms
procurement.
</P>
<P>
Shaheen said Thursday that Taiwan should show the world its
resolve to defend itself by speeding up its NT$610.8 billion
(US$18.23 billion) arms procurement deal with the United States.
</P>
<P>
Shaheen said the deal is one of the crucial factors in
Taiwan-U.S. relations.
</P>
<P>
It upsets Washington to see Taipei keep issuing inflammatory
rhetoric that is likely to intensify tension across the Taiwan Strait
when the budget bill for the arms procurement is being shelved by the
Legislative Yuan, Shaheen said.
</P>
<P>
The arms procurement package includes eight diesel-electric
submarines, a squadron of 12 P-3C Orion submarine-hunting aircraft
and six Patriot PAC-3 anti-missile batteries.
</P>
<P>
Legislative Yuan President Wang Jin-pyng said after a closed-door
meeting with Shaheen Thursday that he had briefed Shaheen on the
process and progress made by the legislature on the critical arms
procurement budget bill.
</P>
<P>
"Shaheen told me that Washington will respect any decision made
by Taiwan on the arms deal and that Taiwan should judge if it has
sufficient defensive and deterrent forces," Wang said.

RULING PARTY TO COMMUNICATE WITH PFP ON CROSS-STRAIT BILL
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei, Jan. 7 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The acting chairman of the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) said Friday that the party is sincere in
wishing to cooperate with the opposition People First Party (PFP) on
a cross-strait draft bill proposed by the PFP.
</P>
<P>
Ker Chien-ming, who is also DPP caucus whip in the Legislative
Yuan, made the remarks against the backdrop of President Chen
Shui-bian working to end intra-party disagreements since the Dec. 11
legislative elections in which the DPP and its ally, the Taiwan
Solidarity Union, failed to gain a majority in the 225-seat
legislature.
</P>
<P>
Amid reports that although it is unlikely that a partnership
between the pro-independence DPP and the pro-unification PFP would
coalesce, Ker said the PFP has recently made meaningful gestures as a
sign that it could work with the DPP in the legislature on a party
assets bill proposed by the DPP.
</P>
<P>
Likewise, the DPP has no reason to block a draft bill proposed by
the PFP next Monday when it is reviewed in a legislative committee,
Ker added.
</P>
<P>
He noted that President Chen made it clear in his new year's
address that if something benefits the stability of domestic
politics, the welfare of the people, harmony among ethnic groups, and
cross-strait peace, then that notion can be open to talks between the
ruling and opposition parties.
</P>
<P>
Ker cited President Chen's meeting Thursday with Legislative Yuan
Speaker Wang Jin-pyng, who concurrently serves as a vice chairman of
the Kuomintang (KMT) , as an example. The meeting indicated that the
president also wanted to talk with the KMT to foster a stable
political environment, he added.
</P>
<P>
On whether PFP Chairman James Soong will serve as the convener of
a cross-strait peaceful development committee proposed by President
Chen, Ker said the president made it known earlier that he would
invite one of the two leaders of the opposition "pan-blue alliance"
of the KMT and the PFP to serve in that post.
</P>
<P>
Ker also flatly dismissed reports that he was sent to the United
States for a secret meeting with Soong in a bid to seek rapport with
the PFP. Soong is currently visiting the U.S. but is reportedly to
cut short his visit and return home next Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Ker said that he is "only an acting DPP chairman, and I had no
contact with Soong."
</P>
<P>
But Ker lauded Soong's statement before his departure to the U.S.
when the latter said, "The PFP will engage in healthy competition
with the KMT to see who better fosters reforms, but will not rule out
the possibility of cooperation with other parties," praising Soong as
a person who really knows the political situation.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a DPP legislator said Friday that the DPP must drop
its Taiwan independence platform and the PFP must cast away its
advocacy of an eventual unification under "one China" if the two are
to cooperate.
</P>
<P>
Lee Wen-chung said that DPP supporters can't accept the ideas of
"one China" and "a future unification with mainland China," while PFP
supporters cannot tolerate a party with Taiwan independence in its
platform.
</P>
<P>
Lee also said that the DPP must stick to its resolution passed
in May 1999 in which it said that Taiwan is a sovereign, independent
country, and changes to this status quo would require a national
referendum of the people on Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, a KMT spokesman said that DPP-PFP cooperation
is only idle talk spread by the DPP to drive a wedge between the
alliance of the KMT and PFP.
</P>
<P>
Chang Jung-kung said that the KMT still believes Soong's promise
that "KMT-PFP cooperation will remain unchanged."
</P>
<P>
Chang said the KMT has only just learned about the possibility of
cooperation between the DPP-PFP and that Soong serving as a convener
of a proposed cross-strait committee is not something that can be
commented on until the facts can be substantiated.

CROSS-STRAIT CHARTER FLIGHTS MOVING IN POSITIVE DIRECTION: MAC

Both sides of the Taiwan Strait have
displayed goodwill and sincerity in bringing about charter flights to
address the needs of Taiwan business people in mainland China during
the Chinese Lunar New Year holiday, and the matter is moving in a
positive direction, a spokesman of the Mainland Affairs Council (MAC)
said Friday.
</P>
<P>
MAC Vice Chairman Chiu Tai-san said that the flights must be
based on the principles of "joint participation, two-way services and
no-stopovers in a third place."
</P>
<P>
The government will also not rule out adding new destinations,
hoping that the "results satisfy everyone."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a representative of Taipei-based EVA Airways in
mainland China said Friday that with the fast approach of Chinese New
Year, which falls on Feb. 9, he is hoping that both sides can
complete talks on charter flights soon.

"We need a clear answer on whether the charter flight services

Taiwan airliners operated charter flights in 2003 between
Shanghai and Taipei/Kaohsiung via Hong Kong/Macau during Chinese
Lunar New Year holiday. The services were not offered the following
year because Beijing insisted that Chinese carriers also be allowed
to join the service but refused to come to the negotiating table to

TAIWAN SHOULD BE EQUIPPED WITH TSUNAMI MONITORING SYSTEMS: EXPERTS
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Jan.  7 (CNA)

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taiwan, located on a seismically active
stretch of the Pacific basin, should devise an early tsunami warning
system of its own, experts from the Central Geological Survey (CGS)
said Friday.
</P>
<P>
CGS specialists said that although some government officials said
last week that the chances of Taiwan being hit by tsunamis are low
because of the deep waters to the east of the island, there is always
the possibility that Taiwan could be affected by a major quake
originating in the Pacific Ocean, which could in turn cause a
tsunami, particularly in coastal areas in Taiwan's northeastern and
southwestern parts where the coastlines are shallow.
</P>
<P>
Looking at historical records, CGS experts said that the southern
port city of Kaohsiung was hit by a devastating tsunami in 1781, and
the Keelung-Chinshan area in northeastern Taiwan experienced another
deadly tsunami in 1867.
</P>
<P>
If an earthquake of magnitude of 9.0 and tsunamis like the ones
that occurred in South Asia Dec. 26, 2004 hit Taiwan, the island would
certainly be affected, with the eastern parts of Taiwan, where
coastal waters have a depth of several thousand feet, being
particularly susceptible, the experts said.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan is near the border of the Philippine and Eurasian plates,
which have a long history of tectonic movement. In addition, the
northeastern part of the island is within the 2,000 km area of the
Okinawa Trough where rift breaks are brisk, the experts said.
</P>
<P>
This is the reason why Taiwan should cooperate with Japan and the
Philippines to jointly monitor earthquakes and tsunamis and deepen
research, they noted.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the experts added that Taiwan should also have
earthquake monitoring systems installed underseas to check
earthquakes from offshore.
</P>
<P>
Currently, Taiwan only has similar detectors installed around
Taiwan proper.
</P>
<P>
The experts made the suggestions in the light of the massive
earthquake offshore Western Indonesia and the ensuing tsunamis that
have killed an estimated 150,000 people and caused unprecedented
damage in many countries in the region.

The Times: Blair bares his teeth.

Tony Blair told Gordon Brown to play a full part in Labour's
manifesto and election campaign as fresh evidence emerged of policy
differences between the two. A senior Downing Street source conceded
last night that the Chancellor felt excluded from the planning
process. He insisted that Mr Blair wanted Mr Brown totally involved
but added: "It clearly is not well understood and accepted by
everybody."

Financial Times: Blair in poll pledge to Brown.

Tony Blair was on Thursday night struggling to keep Gordon Brown
at the heart of Labour's strategy for this year's general election -
amid growing signs that the chancellor believes he has been excluded
from any role in devising the party's manifesto. In a gesture
designed to settle a serious outbreak of tension between the two men
ahead of polling day, Mr Blair pledged that the chancellor would be
"right at the centre" of the party's efforts to get a third term in
government.

NPSU URGES REVIEW OF PROPOSED CHANGES TO LEGISLATIVE ELECTORAL SYSTEM
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Jan.  7 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Non-partisan Solidarity Union (NPSU)
Friday urged a review of a series of constitutional amendments
concerning the halving of the number of legislative seats and changes
to its electoral system because it feels such moves would stifle the
existence of smaller parties.
</P>
<P>
The NPSU noted in a press release that the Legislative Yuan
passed the constitutional amendments last August, which will be put
to review by a 300-member "functional" National Assembly, an ad hoc
body that will be formed before May 26 for the specific mission of
approving the constitutional amendments and will then be dissolved.
</P>
<P>
The NPSU said that the chaos in the Legislative Yuan can be
traced to the quality, not the quantity, of the legislators, adding
that if the current multiple-seat in a bigger constituency is
changed into a "single seat, two votes" system and the 225 seats are
cut by half, then legislative elections will be only beneficial to
the bigger parties.
</P>
<P>
"The smaller parities will be seriously squeezed and the voice of
minor parties will not be heard in the new system," the NPSU claimed.
</P>
<P>
It also said that if the constitutional amendments are approved
by the "functional" National Assembly, then "Taiwan will be left with
the voices of the `pan-green camp' of the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party and its ally Taiwan Solidarity Union and the
opposition `pan-blue alliance' of the Kuomintang and the People First
Party.
</P>
<P>
The NTSU said it expects that the bickering between the "pan-blue
alliance" and "the pan-green camp" will worsen and that the chaos in
the legislature will be exacerbated.

MEDICAL SECTOR CALLS FOR 2ND THOUGHTS ON OVERSEAS TREATMENT
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Jan.  7 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The medical sector Friday urged a family
planning to send their three sons to the United States for treatment
of the rare disorder adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD) to have a second
thoughts on its plan, claiming that they can be treated just as well
in Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Chang Ming-hui, an official with the Kaohsiung city government in
charge of laws and regulations, and his schoolteacher wife Su
Ting-chu, are planning to accompany their three sons to the state of
Minnesota so that the boys, aged from five to 13, all of whom suffer
from ALD, can receive treatment.
</P>
<P>
The family applied for visas Friday to travel to the United
States in the hope that they can get the boys into hospital prior to
the end of January.
</P>
<P>
Their move was prompted by the successful raising of funds after
the public answered the family's cry for help over the Internet to
save the boys.
</P>
<P>
The public responded overwhelmingly, donating NT$64 million
(US$1.98 million) in just three days.
</P>
<P>
Astounded by what he said was "an unbelievable outpouring of
empathy and compassion" by the people of Taiwan, Chang wept on his
knees at a news conference at his home Thursday, saying that he owes
more than a debt of gratitude to everyone and that he hopes that one
day no-one in Taiwan will fall victim to the fatal genetic disease
that specifically targets boys.
</P>
<P>
Chang and his wife called for people from around the island to
stop sending them money since they now have not only enough to allow
their 13-year-old eldest son to go to the United States for
treatment, but also the other two younger sons, all of whom hope to
be cured with the use of Lorenzo's oil.
</P>
<P>
Chang and Su previously planned to seek some NT$5 million to only
allow the 13-year-old Chien-hsuan to receive treatment, mainly a bone
marrow transplant, in the United States after the eldest son began
recently to show early symptoms, including staggering, that are
similar to those displayed by their second son, Po-chun, nearly two
years ago.
</P>
<P>
Twelve-year-old Po-chun is now believed to be in the late stage
of ALD, with his body "shrinking" quickly after suffering complete
paralysis and losing the ability to speak as a result of the disease.
</P>
<P>
ALD is still not fully understood, even in the most advanced
medical centers in the United States.
</P>
<P>
Taking Chien-hsuan and the youngest son, five-year-old Sen-ning,
to the Veterans General Hospital in Taichung for examinations several
months ago, Chang and Su found that only the first and third sons
have dysadrenia, a possible precursor to progressive degenerative
myelin disorder, meaning that myelin, the "insulation" around nerves,
breaks down over time.
</P>
<P>
After seeking medical help around the island, Chang was told to
contact Dr. Hugo Moser of the Kennedy Krieger Institute in Baltimore,
Maryland, who was portrayed in the movie Lorenzo's Oil, for help.
</P>
<P>
The Changs were told by Moser to first have the eldest boy
receive a bone marrow transplant at the Minnesota State University
Medical Center, which would cost US$500,000. The eldest son would
have an 80 percent chance of being cured after receiving the
transplant.
</P>
<P>
Chang will give some of his marrow to Chien-hsuan for the
transplant.
</P>
<P>
In response to the plan, however, Lin Hsiu-chuan,
director-general of the Bureau of Health Promotion under the
Department of Health, said that the Chang brothers can receive
treatment at home in Taiwan given that this disease had been
successfully tackled in Taiwan and the treatment is covered by the
national health insurance program.
</P>
<P>
Lin said that with so much cash donations, the Changs can now
afford the marrow transplant and doses of the expensive Lorenzo's
oil, which costs NT$4,500 a bottle. The three brothers are expected
to need 10 bottles of the medicine per month.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Lin Kai-hsin from National Taiwan University Hospital said
that the NTUH assessed the Chang brothers' conditions about six
months ago and found that only the 13-year-old is suitable for a
marrow transplant, given that the 12-year-old is too sick to undergo
a transplant, while the five-year-old has not yet shown any early
symptoms of the disease. Some ALD patients remain non-symptomatic
throughout their lives, Lin added.
</P>
<P>
Moser presented the results of a long-term study on the
preventive efficacy of Lorenzo's oil in September 2002.
</P>
<P>
While admitting that Lorenzo's oil can normalize the level of
very long chain fatty acids -- the metabolite that accumulates in ALD
-- most doctors in the U.S. medical community have for many years
denied its therapeutic value.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Augusto Odone, one of the two inventors of Lorenzo's oil, has
forged ahead with the Myelin Project, which, if successful, will help
not only the children with leukodystrophies, but also adults who
suffer from multiple sclerosis in whom the myelin sheath is similarly
destroyed.

NEARLY 80 PERCENT OF OFFICE WORKERS TAKE PART IN 'ONE-DAY-INCOME' DRIVE
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Jan.  7 (CNA)

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Nearly 80 percent of the nation's office
workers said Friday they responded to their companies' call to donate
one-day's worth of income to help those in South Asia and Southeast
Asian affected by devastating Dec. 26 tsunami triggered by the
9.0-magnitude earthquake in Sumatra, Indonesia, according to the
results of a poll released Friday.
</P>
<P>
The poll, conducted by an online manpower company from Dec.
30-Jan. 6, collected 1,140 effective samples and had a margin of
error of 2.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
The results show that 77.89 percent responded to the call and
that they donated an average NT$1,199.32 (US$37.47) to help the
tsunami victims.
</P>
<P>
The most heartwarming result is that 77.72 percent of office
workers are also regular donors to various charity groups.
</P>
<P>
Asked how much they will donate to help the victims, those who
answered NT$501-NT$1,000 accounted for the most (35.36 percent) ,
followed by NT$101-NT$500 (29.05 percent) , and NT$1,000-NT$3,000
(20.50 percent).
</P>
<P>
In a multiple choice question, the office workers cited the
reasons for donating as: The victims need aid and assistance (68.85%)
; religious belief (44.02%); support to charity groups (29.57%) ; and
donate for aid following major natural disasters (17.83%).
</P>
<P>
Up to 78.33 percent of those polled said they donate money
irregularly, and 13.32 percent said they donate money to charity
every month.
</P>
<P>
The respondents also said in multiple choices that they most
often donate money to international aid organizations (47.18%) ,
social welfare groups (44.70%), and religious groups (33.6%).

CRIMINAL CODE UNDERGOES BIGGEST REVAMP IN 70 YEARS
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Jan. 7 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Criminal Code has undergone the biggest
revamp since it took force in 1935 after a revision covering two
thirds of its articles passed its third reading at the Legislative
Yuan Friday.
</P>
<P>
Vice Justice Minister Shih Mao-lin told a news conference that
work on the revisions code started in 1974 and was finished in
September 1989.
</P>
<P>
After being presented to the Legislative Yuan in 1990 for
enactment, however, the revision was bogged down in the legislature,
which returned it to the Ministry of Justice for review in 1996.
</P>
<P>
It took a panel under the Ministry of Justice another six years
to finish the review and present it to the Legislative Yuan in July
2002, Shih said.
</P>
<P>
The revision is aimed at reconciling the criminal law with
reality, Shih said, adding that the revised code gives prosecutors
greater leeway in deciding against prosecuting offenders of
misdemeanors, or using suspended prosecutions to cut down the number
of cases going before the court.
</P>
<P>
Citing statistics compiled by the Ministry of Justice, Shih said
the percentage of cases resulting in a prosecution against the entire
number of cases investigated by prosecutors had dropped from 25.3
percent in 1999 to 16.3 percent in the first ten months of 2004.
</P>
<P>
This reflects the fact that more offenders are being spared jail,
which eases the strain on the country's jail system, Shih said.
</P>
<P>
The revised law also gives more flexibility to the probation
program by relaxing its requirements, while raising from 15 years to
25 years the time a prisoner sentenced to life must serve before
being eligible for probation, and toughening the probation
requirements for rapists and felons for the third time, Shih went on.
</P>
<P>
The revised Criminal Code will go into effect July 1, 2006 and
will not be applied to cases tried by the court before that time,
Shih said.

MAINLAND CHINA'S TAIWAN AFFAIRS CHIEF TO MEET WITH KMT DELEGATION
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Beijing, Jan. 7 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The top mainland Chinese official in charge
of Taiwan affairs will meet with a delegation from Taiwan's main
opposition Kuomintang (KMT) next Monday to exchange views on the
launch of direct charter flights across the Taiwan Strait during the
upcoming Chinese Lunar New Year holiday, official sources said
Friday.
</P>
<P>
Chen Yunlin, director of the Taiwan Affairs Office under mainland
China's State Council, will meet with the KMT delegation at the
Diaoyutai Guest House in Beijing Jan. 10, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
Senior officials from Beijing's Civil Aviation Administration of
China (CAAC) will also meet with the KMT delegation earlier that same
day, the sources added.
</P>
<P>
Members of the KMT delegation will include Tseng Yung-chuan,
chief executive of the KMT's policy coordination department; Huang
Teh-fu, the KMT legislative whip; KMT spokesman Chang Jung-kung; and
KMT legislators John Chang and Chu Feng-chih.
</P>
<P>
The sources said the Taipei Airlines Association (TAA), which has
been authorized by the Republic of China government to negotiate
terms for direct cross-strait charter flights during the holiday
period, will also send a delegation to Beijing to discuss technical
details of the flights.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, aviation industry sources said that whether the
special holiday charter flights can be launched will depend on the
results of the negotiation between the TAA and the relevant mainland
authorities.
</P>
<P>
Media reports from Taipei said TAA President Lo Ta-hsin had
already met Friday in Macau with Pu Zhaozhou, director of the CAAC's
Taiwan affairs department, to discuss the holiday charter flight
terms.
</P>
<P>
In Taipei, Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) Vice Chairman Chiu
Tai-san said Friday that both sides of the Taiwan Strait have
displayed goodwill and sincerity to make the much-anticipated holiday
charter flights a reality for the convenience of a large number of
Taiwan business people operating on the mainland China intending to
return for family reunions.
</P>
<P>
Chiu said the flight services will be operated on the principles
of "joint participation, two-way services and no-stopovers in a third
place." He further said things are going on in a positive direction.
</P>
<P>
With Beijing's consent, six Taiwan carriers operated lunar New
Year charter flights in 2003 between Shanghai and Taipei/Kaohsiung
via Hong Kong/Macau. The services were not offered the following year
because Beijing insisted that Chinese carriers also be allowed to
join the service but refused to come to the negotiating table to
discuss the necessary technical details with Taiwan.

PRESIDENT MEETS WITH FORMER AIT CHAIRWOMAN

(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President Chen Shui-bian hosted a luncheon
at the Presidential Office Friday in honor of visiting former
American Institute in Taiwan (AIT) Chairwoman Therese Shaheen.

</P>
<P>
Shaheen, who resigned in April 2004 from the AIT post as the top
U.S. liaison officer with Taiwan in the absence of diplomatic ties,
arrived in Taipei Wednesday for a weeklong private visit. This is her
second trip to Taiwan since her resignation.
</P>
<P>
James Huang, deputy secretary-general of the Presidential Office,
who was present at the luncheon, said Chen and Shaheen are old
friends.
</P>
<P>
"They exchanged New Year greetings and had a happy conversation
on many interesting topics, " Huang said, adding that they did not
touch on Taiwan's long-stalled arms procurement plan.
</P>
<P>
Huang said Shaheen presented a beautifully designed gold necklace
to Chen as a souvenir to his newborn grandson. Chen also presented
Shaheen with a small gift.
</P>
<P>
Several senior officials were also present at the luncheon,
including Presidential Office Secretary-General Su Tseng-chang,
National Security Council Secretary-General Chiou I-jen and Minister
of Foreign Affairs Tan Sun Chen.
</P>
<P>
After the luncheon, Huang said, Shaheen had brief talks with
Chiou.
</P>
<P>
Upon her arrival at the Presidential Office, she first talked
with Vice President Annette Lu and then ate the lunch with Chen.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, Shaheen had a closed-door meeting with the
foreign affairs minister, who said afterward that Shaheen is very
supportive of Taiwan and that she promised to bring more "foreign
friends" to Taiwan to help them better understand Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
"Shaheen told me that many foreign people have never been to
Taiwan and tend to perceive Taiwan as a stark and barren place where
'birds cannot lay eggs, '" Chen said, adding that he agrees with
Shaheen's views that if more foreign people visit Taiwan, they will
become more supportive of Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Speculation has been rife that the purpose of her visit is to
lobby Taiwan's legislature to pass the budget bill for a huge arms
procurement deal. 
</P>
<P>
Shaheen said a day earlier that Taiwan should show the world its
resolve to defend itself by speeding up its NT$610.8 billion
(US$18.23 billion) arms procurement deal with the United States.
</P>
<P>
Shaheen said the deal is one of the crucial factors in
Taiwan-U.S. relations.
</P>
<P>
It upsets Washington to see Taipei keep issuing inflammatory
rhetoric that is likely to intensify tension across the Taiwan Strait
when the budget bill for the arms procurement is being shelved by the
Legislative Yuan, Shaheen said.

TAIWAN TO BENEFIT MORE FROM CROSS-STRAIT TRANSPORT LINKS: TYCOON
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Jan.  7  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Formosa Plastics Group Chairman Wang
Yung-ching said Friday that he told President Chen Shui-bian the
previous day that Taiwan would benefit more than mainland China from
the opening of direct transportation links across the Taiwan Strait.
</P>
<P>
"President Chen nodded in agreement with my views, " Wang told
journalists reporting on his Thursday talks with Chen at the
Presidential Office.
</P>
<P>
Wang said he hopes the two sides of the Taiwan Strait can reach
agreement on the opening of direct cross-strait shipping and air
links as soon as possible but added that he did not suggest any
timetable for launching the much-anticipated direct cross-strait
transport services.
</P>
<P>
"I only told the president that as more Taiwan people visit the
mainland than vice versa, direct cross-strait transportation links
would bring more benefits to Taiwan than to the mainland, " Wang
explained.
</P>
<P>
During their 30-minute talks, Wang said the economy dominated the
agenda.
</P>
<P>
"I told the president that as Taiwan has limited natural
resources, it should be pragmatic and realistic in drafting national
development plans, " Wang said, adding that he hopes the public can
work diligently to boost domestic economic development.
</P>
<P>
The Chen-Wang meeting came at a time when the Cabinet is expected
to undergo a reshuffle ahead of the opening of the new Legislative
Yuan on Feb. 1. Observers have speculated that Chen might seek Wang's
opinions about the imminent Cabinet reshuffle and feasible ways to
break the deadlocked relations between the ruling and opposition
camps. However, Wang said Chen did not bring up any political topics
such as the choice of new the premier, the new Straits Exchange
Foundation chairman and the improvement of inter-party relations.

Noting that three brothers in Kaohsiung who
suffer from a rare disease were inundated with donations totaling
NT$64 million (US$2 million) in just three days, President Chen
Shui-bian urged the public Friday to extend aid to people in
countries devastated by the Dec. 26 tsunami in South Asia and
Southeast Asia with the same passion.
</P>

The president said the story of the three brothers proves that
Taiwan people have a great deal of compassion and added that he hopes
they will show the same compassion for the people who suffered in the
tsunami disaster.

The three brothers suffer from a disease called

<TEXT>
<P>
The Ministry of the Interior has ordered a
Taipei citizen to disband his self-styled "communist organization, "
ministry officials said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The ministry issued the order after Dai Chung published an
announcement late last year in local media that he had established a
Chinese Communist Party Taiwan provincial council in Taipei to
advocate communism and recruit party members, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
The order is based on the Civic Organization Law and the National
Security Law, both of which stipulate that civic groups are
prohibited from advocating and promoting communism or secessionist
activities, they explained.
</P>
<P>
Also, Dai did not present a report on the establishment of his
group to the authorities as stipulated by law, thus further violating
the regulations, the officials went on.
</P>
<P>
Dai should dismiss his group within seven days of receiving the
ministry's order and should neither conduct operations nor organize
activities under the group's name, otherwise he will be punished with
administrative fines, the officials added.

VISA SNUB WILL NOT AFFECT FRIENDSHIP BETWEEN TAIWAN, HK: TAIPEI MAYOR
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Jan. 7 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou said Friday that
the Hong Kong government's decision not to grant him a visa will not
affect the friendship between the people of Taiwan and Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Ma made the remarks while meeting with a group of Hong Kong
volunteers dedicated to helping the mentally and physically
challenged.
</P>
<P>
Ma was forced to cancel a plan to visit Hong Kong Jan. 11-13
after the Hong Kong authorities refused to issue him a visa, a move
that has drawn broadsides from the Hong Kong media.
</P>
<P>
Ma said he is hopeful that he can visit the former British colony
in the future.
</P>
<P>
According to a report by the Yazhou Zhoukan, a Hong Kong-based
Chinese-language weekly, Hong Kong Chief Executive Tung Chee Hwa sent
a secret envoy to Taipei to try to persuade Ma to reject the speaking
invitation from the University of Hong Kong to spare the Hong Kong
government possible trouble from turning down his visa application.
</P>
<P>
Ma said two groups of Hong Kong friends have indeed been to
Taiwan in the past few weeks. They told Ma that the invitation might
be changed, probably because of his recent public criticism of
Beijing's so-called anti-secession legislation.
</P>
<P>
Ma said he was not sure whether they were Tung's secret envoys.
According to Ma, the visitors were friends that he and Tung have in
common but he declined to identify any of them.
</P>
<P>
"The Hong Kong visitors advised me to politely turn down the
invitation to make a speaking tour of Hong Kong, using my busy work
schedule as an excuse. I was surprised by the suggestion and as I had
already set up my travel itinerary with the University of Hong Kong,
I decided not to back away from my promise on the pretext of my busy
schedule," Ma said.
</P>
<P>
Ma was invited to deliver a speech on the rise of Chinese urban
development from Taipei's perspective at the University of Hong Kong
Jan. 11 and to attend a Taipei tourism promotion activity and seminar
at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology Jan. 12.
</P>
<P>
The Hong Kong government reportedly had suggested that Ma's local
sponsor, the University of Hong Kong, postpone its invitation to Ma
until April.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Taiwan's top representative in Hong Kong said Friday
that his office has lodged a protest to the Hong Kong government over
its rejection of Ma's visa application.
</P>
<P>
"We have expressed our strong dissatisfaction and protest over
the issue, " said Pao Cheng-kang, managing director of the Chung Hwa
Travel Service.
</P>
<P>
While the Hong Kong authorities reiterated their established
policy of not explaining their decisions on individual visa
applications, Pao said, Hong Kong officials have assured him that
they are willing to promote civic exchanges between Taiwan and Hong
Kong.
</P>
<P>
The Hong Kong authorities have also reaffirmed that Ma has not
been put on a "blacklist" of persona non-grata, Pao said.

MND TO HELP TRANSPORT RELIEF SUPPLIES TO TSUNAMI-AFFECTED NATIONS

<P>
The Ministry of National Defense has
assigned six cargo planes to help transport relief supplies to
tsunami-affected nations in South Asia and Southeast Asia, Premier Yu
Shyi-kun said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The government is negotiating with countries on related flight
routes to arrange the shipments and the relief supplies will be
distributed by Taiwan's overseas missions and Taiwanese businessmen
to the Dec. 26 disaster victims once they arrive at their
destinations, Yu noted.
</P>
<P>
With regard to the recent global relief summit held in Jakarta
that Taiwan was not invited to take part in, Yu said that U.S.
officials will brief the Taiwan authorities on the decisions made at
the meeting so that the country knows what part it can play in the
international relief efforts.
</P>
<P>
Also, he went on, Taiwan's overseas missions will make contact
with the governments of their host nations to collect information on
materials needed.
</P>
<P>
Both the government and private sector have launched various
campaigns to collect relief funds and materials for the victims of
the 9.0-magnitude earthquake-triggered tsunami that affected the
Indian Ocean rim nations and has so far claimed more than 160,000
lives in addition to incalculable property damage and losses.
</P>
<P>
The government has also announced that it will offer US$50
million-worth of aid to the affected nations.

GOVERNMENT PULLS OUT BIG GUNS TO LAMBASTE CHINA'S ANTI-SECESSION LAW
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Jan. 7 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Executive Yuan brought out three senior
government officials Friday to lambaste mainland China's attempt to
enact an anti-secession law.
</P>
<P>
The three officials -- Foreign Minister Tan Sun Chen, Mainland
Affairs Council Chairman Joseph Wu and Vice Minister of National
Defense Tsai Min-hsien -- fired a volley at the mainland in a news
conference called by the Government Information Office and appealed
to the international community to preempt Beijing's attempt to
unilaterally alter the status quo across the Taiwan Strait and stop
it from enacting the law.
</P>
<P>
Wu told about 40 journalists posted to Taiwan by foreign media
that the mainland is deliberately ignoring the existence of the
Republic of China by crafting a law to justify its possible invasion
of Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
The international community is virtually encouraging the mainland
to continue and intensify its military bullying of Taiwan by
remaining silent while Beijing tries to disrupt the status quo in
terms of its ties with Taiwan, Wu claimed.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan has never deviated from its policy of building up mutual
trust with the mainland through the normalization of ties, but
Beijing's enactment of the anti-secession law will inevitably block
Taiwan's efforts and raise the tension across the Taiwan Strait, Wu
went on.
</P>
<P>
Chen said Beijing's anti-secession law is founded on the false
assumption that there is only one China of which Taiwan is a part and
that the mainland's eventual taking over of Taiwan is an internal
affair in which foreign powers are not supposed to interfere.
</P>
<P>
By formulating this law, Chen claimed, the mainland is trying to
take into its hands the power to define what is right and what is
wrong regarding the cross-strait situation.
</P>
<P>
It will strip Taiwan people of their right to choose their own
future and will threaten Taiwan's democracy, said Chen.
</P>
<P>
Tsai said Beijing's anti-secession law is aimed at justifying a
possible attack on Taiwan and he added that Taiwan will strengthen
its military power to defend itself and deter the mainland from
invading.

TAIWAN BUSINESSMEN IN CHINA POSITIVE ABOUT 'MINI THREE-LINKS'
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Jan.  8 (CNA)
(By Lillian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taiwan businessmen operating in mainland
China are mostly positive about the direct trade and transportation
links between the Taiwan-held islands of Kinmen and Matsu with
mainland China, according to a poll released Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The poll, conducted by Ming Chuan University at Kinmen's Shuitou
Wharf on Taiwan businessmen plying the direct route between Kinmen
and Xiamen between Oct. 17 and 23 in 2004, collected 329 effective
questionnaires out of 400 issued.
</P>
<P>
The poll was released in tandem with the fourth anniversary of
the direct trade, postal and transportation links, or commonly known
as the "mini three-links, " between the two outlying islands with
mainland China's Fujian province.
</P>
<P>
The poll showed that Taiwan businessmen think direct links save
time and money, and gave an overall assessment of 75.7 points out of
100 points on the policy, which they think is in their interests.
</P>
<P>
The poll also found that nearly 40 percent of Taiwan businessmen
have plied the route more than 10 times, showing that the route
provides a cheap and convenient channel for Taiwan businessmen.
</P>
<P>
But Taiwan businessmen also pointed out that there is room for
improvement in the policy, citing insufficient facilities at the
Shuitou Wharf, not enough flights from Taiwan to Kinmen and too few
ferries between Kinmen and Xiamen, as well as the lack of duty free
shops.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan businessmen also said that when they shuttle between the
two sides of the Taiwan Strait via Kinmen, they most often buy Kung
Candy -- a peanut candy -- as a souvenir, spending an average of
NT$1,000 (US$31.25) . One-eighth of Taiwan businessmen also said they
spend nothing while transferring through Kinmen.
</P>
<P>
The institute also released a poll on residents of Kinmen and
Matsu to learn about their attitude toward the "mini three-links."
</P>
<P>
If 60 points is the passing grade, residents in Kinmen only gave
the "mini three-links" 51.8 points, while Matsu residents gave it
58.29 points.
</P>
<P>
The residents of the two outlying islands couldn't give a passing
grade because the policy doesn't meet the needs of the residents
there, the university explained.

TAIWAN'S INTERNATIONAL TRADE HIT RECORD HIGH IN 2004
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Jan.  8 (CNA)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taiwan's international trade set a new
record high in 2004, although its trade surplus of US$6.14 billion in
the same year was the lowest since 1999, an official of the Ministry
of Finance said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Hsu Kuo-chung, chief statistician of the ministry, attributed the
hike in the country's exports and imports to the global economic
expansion that started in late 2003.
</P>
<P>
Citing statistics compiled by his office, Hsu said Taiwan's
exports and imports experienced double-digit expansion for the whole
of 2004, with exports registering an annual growth of 20.7 percent
and imports 31.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
As imports grew more significantly than exports, Hsu said the
trade surplus shrank.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan's trade with mainland China and Hong Kong increased in
line with the country's expanding international trade and also set a
record high, with its exports to those areas rising by 28.8 percent
to US$63.84 billion and imports up by 48.8 percent to US$18.77
billion, according to Hsu.
</P>
<P>
He predicted that the growth of Taiwan's international trade will
slow in 2005 in light of the fact that U.S. economic growth is
forecast by the London-based Economist Information Unit to slide to
3.1 percent next year because of its tight monetary policy and the
wearing out of the effect of its financial stimulation policy.
</P>
<P>
The depreciation in the value of the U.S. dollar and the scaling
down of mainland China's economic growth will also make a dent in
Taiwan's economy this year, according to Hsu.

VICE DEFENSE MINISTER CALLS FOR SUPPORT FOR U.S. ARMS PROCUREMENT
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Jan.  8 (CNA)
(By Y.F. Low)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Vice Minister of National Defense Michael
Tsai on Saturday called on the people to support the government's
arms procurement from the United States, saying Taiwan must beef up
its counterattack capability in the face of mainland China's
continued military buildup.
</P>
<P>
Tsai made the remarks while giving a speech on "national defense,
trade and cross-Taiwan Strait relations" in the central city of
Taichung.
</P>
<P>
Tsai pointed out that the international community generally
agrees that there are three regions of crisis in the world: the
Middle East, the Korean Peninsula and the Taiwan Strait.
</P>
<P>
While mainland China's defense budget is enjoying double-digit
growth every year, the number of missiles deployed by the Chinese
military targeting Taiwan has risen to more than 600 and is
increasing by 60 to 70 per year, Tsai said.
</P>
<P>
With defense spending as a share of the national budget declining
year after year, the Ministry of National Defense has put forth a
special budget proposal for the NT$610.8 billion (US$18.23 billion)
arms procurement, Tsai noted.
</P>
<P>
Tsai argued that Taiwan must keep its military capability strong
to maintain cross-strait peace and that the military balance across
the Strait in the past managed to deter mainland China from invading
Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
However, mainland China is bullying Taiwan now that the island's
defense budget has decreased, barring Taipei's bids to take part in
international organizations and even planning to enact an
"anti-secession law," Tsai said.
</P>
<P>
President Chen Shui-bian has over the past year put forth various
proposals to avoid the outbreak of war across the Strait, which
include building a framework of peace and stability, establishing a
military confidence-building mechanism, setting up a military buffer
zone and establishing a cross-strait code of conduct, he noted.
</P>
<P>
He promised that Taiwan will not launch an attack but will
counterattack in case mainland China takes military action against
the island. He also urged the people to support the arms procurement.
</P>
<P>
The government plans to purchase six Patriot PAC-III anti-missile
batteries, eight diesel-electric submarines and a squadron of 12
anti-submarine aircraft, but the budget bill for the procurement has
been stonewalled in the legislature by the opposition "pan-blue
alliance" of the Kuomintang and People First Party, which believes
the spending is unnecessary and a waste of taxpayers' money.

NO WORD YET OF FATE OF  NEW YEAR CHARTER FLIGHT SERVICE: MAC
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Jan. 8 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Both Taiwan and mainland China are sincere
in quickly working out the details for the special charter flight
service prior to the coming Chinese Lunar New Year, but the
government has not yet received any response on the issue from its
negotiator, a government official said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Chiu Tai-san, vice chairman of the Cabinet-level Mainland Affairs
Council (MAC), made the comment to dismiss a media report that Taiwan
and mainland China have reached agreement on the arrangement for
mainland-based Taiwan businessmen wishing to spend the lunar new year
holidays early next month at home by taking charter flights.
</P>
<P>
According to Chiu, the MAC has not received any information from
Lo Ta-hsing, chairman of the Taipei Airlines Association commissioned
by the MAC to hold technical talks with representatives of the Civil
Aviation Administration of China (CAAC) in Macau Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Regarding the media report that Taiwan and the mainland have
reached agreement in Macau on the model for "non-stop, round-trip,
multi-destination flights by carriers on both sides, " Chang
Jung-kung, spokesman for the opposition Kuomintang (KMT), called that
only a technical detail which does not necessarily mean that the
charter flights across the Taiwan Strait are ready.
</P>
<P>
The KMT will also organize a mission to Beijing to help with the
issue due to the sensitive cross-strait situation.
</P>
<P>
The KMT delegation will depart for Beijing as scheduled on Sunday
to hold talks the next day with officials of the Taiwan Affairs
Office under the State Council and the CAAC.
</P>
<P>
The delegation will be headed by Tseng Yung-chuan, director of
the KMT's Central Policy Committee, and will include KMT lawmakers
John Chang and Chu Fong-chih, and People First Party lawmaker Li
Hong-jyun.
</P>
<P>
The special Chinese Lunar New Year charter flights were first
launched in 2003, involving only Taiwan carriers. But the service
failed to proceed in 2004 as a result of the mainland's insistence
upon mainland carriers being allowed to also offer flights.
</P>
<P>
Despite frequent and close trade and economic exchanges between
Taiwan and mainland China, direct trade, transport and postal links
have been absent between the two sides, which have been at odds since
1949, when the now-opposition KMT lost a civil war to communist
forces and retreated to Taiwan.

DPP, PFP COOPERATION GOOD FOR POLITICAL STABILITY: FORMER PRESIDENT
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Jan. 8 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Former President Lee Teng-hui said Saturday
that if the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) can cooperate
with the third-largest opposition party, the People First Party
(PFP), it will help the stability of Taiwan politics.
</P>
<P>
Lee made the remarks while golfing in Taoyuan, northern Taiwan,
with his friends and political figures, who gathered to celebrate his
upcoming 84th birthday Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Asked by reports about the DPP cooperating with the PFP, Lee
said, "That would be good and would be very helpful to stabilize the
political situation in Taiwan. After all, Taiwan has been suffering
for years." 
</P>
<P>
He did not say if President Chen Shui-bian had asked his opinion
on the impending Cabinet reshuffle during a meeting earlier this
week.
</P>
<P>
Reports about the seemingly unlikely partnership between the
pro-independence DPP and the pro-unification PFP emerged after
President Chen offered to engage in party-to-party consultations in
his New Year's Day address. The DPP garnered a worse-than-expected 89
seats in the Dec. 11 legislative elections, not enough to form a
majority in the 225-seat legislature even with its ally, the Taiwan
Solidarity Union, which won 12 seats.
</P>
<P>
Lee also said that he and his wife were concerned about the
safety of their granddaughter, Lee Kun-yi, who recently flew to Italy
to study the arts after finishing her Executive MBA degree at the
London School of Economics and Political Science.
</P>
<P>
Lee said that he encountered a great number of inconveniences due
to the interference of mainland China while he was traveling in Japan
recently, and he worried that his granddaughter might encounter
similar harassment during the long flight to Italy.

SUCCESS OF NEW YEAR CHARTERS HELPFUL TO EXPANDING FUTURE SERVICES: MAC
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
It would be helpful to the expansion of
cross-Taiwan Strait charter flight services in the future if
passenger charter flights are successfully launched during next
month's Chinese Lunar New Year holiday, Mainland Affairs Council
(MAC) Vice Chairman Chiu Tai-san said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
While cargo charters could be launched after that, passenger
charters could be provided during other holidays, such as the Dragon
Boat Festival and the Mid-autumn Festival and to other mainland
Chinese destinations besides Shanghai and Beijing, Chiu said.
</P>
<P>
Chiu said both Taiwan and mainland China have shown a high degree
of goodwill and sincerity in facilitating the new year's charter
flights to transport mainland-based Taiwanese businessmen home for
the holiday.
</P>
<P>
Everything has been developing in a positive direction so far,
Chiu said.
</P>
<P>
Local media reports said that Lo Ta-hsing, chairman of the Taipei
Airlines Association, authorized by the MAC to negotiate with Beijing
authorities on the issue, had reached an agreement in principle with
Civil Aviation Administration of China representatives in Macau
Friday to allow non-stop, two-way, multi-destination flights operated
by carriers on both sides.
</P>
<P>
But Chiu earlier said that he has yet to receive any information
from Lo.
</P>
<P>
Chiu said this time around would involve a more complicated
arrangement than in 2003 if mainland airliners are to join the
operations and that the MAC needs to consult with the Ministry of
National Defense on details such as the routes and time of the
flights for security reasons.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese Lunar New Year charter flights were first launched in
2003 between Shanghai and Taipei/Kaohsiung via Hong Kong/Macau, with
only Taiwanese carriers allowed to operate the services.
</P>
<P>
The flights were not provided last year mainly because Beijing
insisted that mainland carriers be allowed to join the services but
refused to negotiate with Taipei on the technical details involved.

ECONOMICS MINISTER CALLS FOR MULTILATERAL TRADE COOPERATION
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei, Jan. 8 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
To assuage concerns that Taiwan might become
an outcast due to mainland China's economic expansion in conjunction
with neighboring countries, Minister of Economic Affairs Ho Mei-yueh
called Saturday for multilateral trade cooperation and free trade
agreements (FTAs) with key economic partners to address the
situation.
</P>
<P>
Ho made the remarks in an exclusive interview with the Central
News Agency.
</P>
<P>
Claiming that Taiwan will confront fierce challenges if it fails
to overcome flow-on effects from the mainland's economic integration
with the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), she pointed
to the multilateral trade mechanisms under the framework of the World
Trade Organization (WTO) and the establishment of FTAs with friendly
countries as effective means to minimize the impact.
</P>
<P>
Products going between mainland China and the 10 ASEAN member
states will all be customs duty free by 2010, when the mainland-ASEAN
FTA inked in July last year is slated to come into effect. Meanwhile,
Japan and South Korea have also started FTA talks with ASEAN. East
Asia in general is moving toward setting up the world's largest
single free trade market.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan's economy will brace for much greater difficulties should
the ASEAN plus three (mainland China, Japan and South Korea) bloc be
formed, she warned, adding that Taiwan must be prepared in advance,
since Taiwan's hope of joining the current economic integration drive
in the region seems extremely slim.
</P>
<P>
To offset the losses of being left out of the world's potentially
largest market, Taiwan will do all it can to forge an FTA with the
United States and other countries, she noted.
</P>
<P>
The United States would be highly symbolic in terms of Taiwan's
FTA talks with other countries, while Taiwan would be a good option
for the United States when seeking a good supplier in the region to
the mainland Chinese and ASEAN markets, she said.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Economic Affairs is planning to draw up various
position papers to explain the benefits of the issue to U.S. think
tanks and the private sector to clear the way for Taiwan's FTA talks
with the U. S. government, she added. "The road is long, but it is
one that we must walk," she said.

volunteers continuing to put clothes, food rations, drinking water,
pharmaceuticals, batteries, toys and stationery into the container.
</P>

Hsia said that he received a call from Ackerman's office two days

Queens presided over by a Sri Lankan, received a great number of
donated materials, but had no money to transport them, and asked for
assistance.
</P>
<P>
After contacting Yang Ming Marine Transport Corp., the latter
generously gave its consent for the free transportation, Hsia said.
</P>
<P>
He added though Taiwan is not a member of the United Nations, it
is still a member of the international community, and that the
government has donated US$50 million for tsunami-relief in South and
Southeast Asia, and the private sector is also responding actively to
the donation drive. Donation drives to assist the victims of the
tsunami disaster will also continue among Taiwanese expatriates in
the U.S., he said.

<P>
Meanwhile, a relief association formed by Taiwanese expatriates
in Ottawa, Canada is urging generous donations to help the tsunami
victims. A number of donations kiosks were set up in Chinatown

60% OF WOMAN WORKERS BELIEVE BEING FAT AFFECTS JOB APPLICANTS: POLL

<P>
Being overweight and looking for work could
be a bad combination, according to about 60 percent of woman office
workers in Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
The results of a poll, conducted by the Pan-Asia Human Resource
Company between Dec. 20 and Jan. 4, found that 58.98 percent of the
respondents considered that a job applicant being overweight would
surely or probably have a negative impact on the interviewer and 41
percent believed it did not make a difference.
</P>
<P>
Of those responding to the poll, 44.68 percent said weight
affects promotions and pay raises; 41.39 percent said it was
"probably not" an issue and 13.93 percent said it was "definitely
not."
</P>
<P>
In terms of working performance, 78.5 percent said it was
"probably not" an influence.
</P>
<P>
Just over 2 percent said that being overweight affects
interpersonal relationships, 15.02 percent said "probably not" and
82.84 percent said "absolutely not."
</P>
<P>
As for interactions between supervisors and subordinates, 43.17
percent considered that supervisors treat woman office workers with a
good figure the same as others, while 56.83 percent thought that
supervisors treated them better than others.
</P>
<P>
Faced with the cruel reality brought by being overweight, 85.65
percent cherished the idea of slimming, while 14.35 percent did not.
</P>
<P>
As for self-assessing their figure, 17 percent of the respondents
said they were too thin, 43.37 percent believed they were slim or in
the middle, 30.67 percent replied that they were overweight and 8.55
percent thought they were obese.
</P>
<P>
A total of 84.08 percent responding to the poll admitted they had
tried to lose weight, while 15.92 percent said they had not.
</P>
<P>
Of those who had dieted, 28.49 percent succeeded, while 33.15
percent failed probably due to lack of persistence, with most of them
ending up gaining back the weight.
</P>
<P>
A total of 5,937 valid responses were collected in the poll of
randomly selected woman office workers islandwide. The survey had a
margin of error of plus or minus 1.27 percent.

Su made the remarks in the northern Taiwan city of Keelung, one
of many stops of his islandwide trip in a get-out-the-vote drive to
solicit support for his bid to run for DPP chairmanship in a
by-election Jan. 30.
</P>
<P>
Asked about inter-party cooperation for the formation of a new
Cabinet, Su said that President Chen Shui-bian has said clear that
the public is tired of the forever bickering between the ruling and
opposition parties, which stalled the nation's development during his
first term, and is aspiring for a national reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
The president has said the time for party-to-party consultations
has come, Su noted, echoing the president's words that anything that
is beneficial to stability in domestic politics, the welfare of the
people, harmony among ethnic groups and cross-strait relations can be
open for discussion and consultations between parties.
</P>
<P>
The DPP is a responsible party and will not trade positions for
political gains, Su said, adding that the DPP hopes to cooperate with
the PFP, and could also discuss anything that is beneficial to the
country with the KMT.
</P>
<P>
The DPP failed in its bid to gain a majority in the Dec. 11
legislative elections. It garnered a worse-than-expected 89 out of
225 seats and couldn't pass the threshold of a majority of 113 seats
even with the 12 seats of its ally, the Taiwan Solidarity Union.
</P>
<P>
Su, the sole candidate in the DPP chairman by-election, also said
the post of chairmanship is not an easy one, as there will be
elections coming in the next two years and the chairman has to
shoulder heavy campaigning responsibilities.
</P>
<P>
Su noted that there will be mayor and magistrate elections at the
end of this year, as well as city and county councilmen elections
next year. There will even be an election to select the members of a
"functional" National Assembly, whose 300 members will be elected
in proportion to various political parties. The ad hoc body will be
charged with the mission of approving a series of constitutional
amendments passed by the Legislative Yuan last August, and then
dissolve itself.
</P>
<P>
Though assured of victory in the Jan. 30 chairman election, Su
nevertheless went out of his way to travel islandwide, hoping that
party members could come out to vote so that he can get a "not too
bad" score sheet.
</P>
<P>
He citied the example of Kaohsiung Mayor Frank Hsieh, who was
also a sole candidate in a party chairman election before only
managed to attract 10 percent of voters to cast ballots.

LIEN WILL MEET PRESIDENT ONLY IF SOONG COMES ALONG: KMT OFFICIAL
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Jan. 8 (CNA)
(By Elizabeth Hsu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Lien
Chan is willing to meet President Chen Shui-bian if People First
Party (PFP) Chairman James Soong is also present, a KMT official said
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
KMT Legislator and Central Policy Committee Executive Director
Tseng Yung-chuan also noted that if the president shows enough
sincerity to ask Soong to organize a coalition Cabinet, the KMT, a
close ally of the PFP, will be happy to see Soong be the country's
next premier.
</P>
<P>
Tseng was commenting on recent reports indicating that the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) has taken steps to seek
inter-party negotiations and possible cooperation between the DPP and
PFP, part of the so-called "pan-blue alliance" of the KMT and PFP,
which won a legislative majority in elections late last year.
</P>
<P>
Tseng, however, warned Chen not to play games to try to break the
two main opposition parties apart, stressing that the KMT and PFP
enjoy the same political ideas, and that only when Chen delivers
invitations to both Soong and Lien for a joint meeting will the KMT
leader agree to take part in such a gathering.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, echoing Tseng's comments was Liu Wen-hsiung, convener
of the PFP caucus in the Legislative Yuan, who said that his party is
not opposed to a possible Chen-Soong-Lien meeting.
</P>
<P>
However, Liu said that only on the condition of the president
defending the existence of the Republic of China and that of the DPP
giving up its party plank concerning the promotion of Taiwan
independence would Soong be likely to agree to meet Chen for talks.
</P>
<P>
Also, such a meeting would have to be "public and transparent, "
Liu said.
</P>
<P>
At DPP headquarters, however, a top official blasted the KMT's
suggestion of allowing Soong to serve as premier, saying that the
KMT's move was aimed at disturbing possible DPP-PFP cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Acting DPP Chairman Ker Chien-ming said that President Chen is
willing to meet Lien and Soong first separatedly.
</P>
<P>
Following a protocol in international negotiations, Ker said,
there should be first bilateral talks and then multilateral talks,
Ker stressed.
</P>
<P>
In line with constitutional precedent, Premier Yu Shyi-kun and
all Cabinet members are expected to resign en masse after the current
Legislative Yuan concludes its final session on Jan. 21. Rumors have
circulated for the last couple of weeks about the possibility of Chen
naming a new premier and forming a coalition Cabinet with opposition
parties. Senior government officials, including Yu himself, have been
tightlipped about the imminent Cabinet reshuffle.

MOEA EYEING TO MAKE TAIWAN INDUSTRIES 'ECO-SYSTEM': HO
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Jan. 8 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taiwan must seek to transform its industry
into an "eco-system" to help maintain the country's sustainable
development, Minister of Economic Affairs Ho Mei-yueh said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking in an exclusive interview with the Central News Agency,
Ho said that the government's leading task to achieve that goal is to
create a favorable environment in which all sectors can progress
continuously.
</P>
<P>
The government should first help promising businesses keep
sustainable development and second, assist them in expanding, Ho
said. 
</P>
<P>
In her viewpoint, the government should further promote the
industries with an annual production value of more than NT$100
billion (US$3.1 billion) and help competitive small businesses to
grow to mid-scale. "Only through adequate adjustments and
replacements can Taiwan's industry survive to become an "eco-system"
amid robust foreign competition," she said.
</P>
<P>
According to the economics minister, many Taiwan industries
actually possess an advantageous position in the intensively
competitive world market.
</P>
<P>
Currently, the domestic semiconductor and panel display
industries yield an output value of about NT$1.14 trillion and NT$662
billion per year, respectively, while the biotech and digital content
industries post a production value of NT$214 billion and NT$450
billion, respectively. The four industries are the key hi-tech
industries included in the Cabinet's "two-trillion, two-star" program
to transform Taiwan into a technology-intensive island.
</P>
<P>
She said that the government plans to advocate the semiconductor,
panel display, petrochemical, steel and telecommunications industries
to have a production value worth over NT$1 trillion by 2008 and help
the textile, electronics parts, automobile, machinery equipment and
foodstuff industries create an output value of more than NT$500
billion by that time, in addition to another 14 with NT$100 billion.
</P>
<P>
To push for an overall industrial upgrading for the country, the
government is perfectly aware of the fact that "all eggs should not
be put in the same basket," she explained.
</P>
<P>
The government is fully responsible for ironing out fair and just
rules for industries in which all types of businesses are encouraged
to expand and make profits, she said, adding that once such a
competition system is set up across the board, market forces will
eventually have a say in many issues.

concerned that you are not known, but seek to do something to deserve
a reputation."

TAIWAN DISINFECTION MISSION DEPARTS FOR INDONESIA
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Jan. 9 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A three-member team from the Environmental
Protection Administration (EPA) departed Taipei Sunday for the
earthquake and tsunami-hit area of Medan, Indonesia, to help bolster
post-disaster disinfection work there.
</P>
<P>
Team leader Yuan Shao-ying, vice director-general of the EPA's
Department of Environmental Sanitation and Toxic Substance
Management, said at Chiang Kai-shek International Airport that the
team is bringing a number of automatic disinfectant dispensers to
Medan and will look into how efficiently the Indonesian authorities
have been using 100 semi-automatic sprayers and 50-kg condenser
disinfectants that Taiwan sent there last week.
</P>
<P>
An additional 200 dispensers are ready to be sent if they are
needed, Yuan said.
</P>
<P>
The EPA is also planning an additional assistance of NT$30
million (US$937,500) to provide sprayers, pesticides, disinfectants
and protective gear, he added.

</P>
<P>
Yuan's team members are Chang Chih-ying, a disinfection
professional, and Lin Hsi-chin, an official with Taipei city
government's Environmental Protection Bureau in charge of disinfection
affairs.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan has continued to send cash aid, medical supplies and
relief goods to Indonesia since Dec. 26, even though the Indonesian
government turned down Taiwan's request to take part in an
international conference held in Jakarta Jan. 6 to coordinate relief
efforts for the tsunami-hit nations around the Indian Ocean.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia was the hardest-hit nation in the Dec. 26 magnitude 9
earthquake offshore its western city of Banda Aceh and the ensuing
tsunami. More than half of the estimated 150,000 people around the
Indian Ocean that were killed in the devastation were in Indonesia.
The tsunami also caused unprecedented damage in many other countries
in the region.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan, which has promised US$50 million in aid to the
disaster-hit nations, is the world's eighth-biggest single donor thus
far.

KMT DELEGATION DEPARTS FOR BEIJING TO DISCUSS CHARTER FLIGHTS

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A delegation of the opposition Kuomintang
(KMT) left Sunday for Beijing to meet with mainland Chinese officials
responsible for Taiwan and aviation affairs to discuss issues
relating to the possible operation of Lunar New Year cross-Taiwan
Strait charter flights.
</P>
<P>
The delegation consists of four members, including KMT
legislators Tseng Yung-chuan, John Chang and Chu Feng-chih, and KMT
spokesman Chang Yung-kung.
</P>
<P>
Legislator John Chang said before departure that Taipei and
Beijing still need to discuss many details about the launch of the
charter flights.
</P>
<P>
The legislator had successfully pushed for the launch of Lunar New
Year charter flights across the Taiwan Strait for the first time in
2003.
</P>
<P>
Pointing out that launching charter flights in 2005 had
originally been seen by many as a hopeless matter, the legislator said
that the KMT hopes it can successfully push for the matter again this
year, following the 2003 method.
</P>
<P>
He claimed that the chances of success are 70 percent, with the
other 30 percent subject to talks with Beijing, adding that the
Mainland Affairs Council and President Chen Shui-bian will have to
make a decision if the delegation can reach an agreement in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Expressing the hope that the current cross-strait tension can be
eased by a successful launch of the charter flights, Chang also said
that the Taiwan government should not neglect the people's will.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, delegation chief Tseng said that the delegation, along
with Taiwan airlines representatives, will discuss with mainland
officials and airlines the specifics of the charter flights.
</P>
<P>
He said the KMT hopes that the mainland will agree to use
Beijing, Xiamen and Guanchou as departure and destination cities for
the flights.

TAITRA TO SET UP MORE FOOTHOLDS IN ASEAN COUNTRIES
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Jan.  9 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Taiwan External Trade Development
Council (TAITRA) said Sunday it will open 10 new overseas offices in
the next three years to cope with regional integration-oriented
international economic development trends.
</P>
<P>
Four of the new offices will be located in member states of the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) because emerging
markets in Asia are the focus of global competition, TAITRA officials
said.
</P>
<P>
Noting that ASEAN countries are developing import-substitute and
export-oriented industries, the officials said, Taiwan's machinery,
electronics and information-technology products and auto parts and
components are highly competitive and suitable for export to ASEAN
countries.
</P>
<P>
As ASEAN is also endeavoring to forge free trade agreements with
mainland China, Japan and South Korea, the officials said TAITRA has
stepped up efforts to help local companies make inroads into the vast
ASEAN market.
</P>
<P>
In the coming three years, the officials said, TAITRA will open
new offices in four ASEAN countries -- Thailand, Indonesia, Malaysia
and Singapore -- to strengthen services for Taiwan companies and help
them explore joint venture opportunities.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the officials said, TAITRA will also set up new offices
in Chicago, Chile, Spain, Romania, Ukraine and South Africa in the
near future to offer better services for Taiwan enterprises in their
global business expansion drives.
</P>
<P>
In 2005, the officials said, TAITRA will focus on promoting
exports to nine countries -- Vietnam, Thailand, India, Japan, South
Korea, Brazil, Argentina, Russia and Bangladesh.

DPP TO REVISE SOVEREIGNTY-DEFENDING RESOLUTION: PARTY WHIP
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Jan.  9 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The ruling Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) is willing to revise a proposed sovereignty-defending
resolution in an attempt to facilitate consensus between the DPP and
the opposition on efforts to safeguard the sovereignty of the
Republic of China, a DPP legislator said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Tsai Huang-liang, party whip of the DPP caucus at the Legislative
Yuan, said the DPP leadership will meet Monday to work out a revision
to the proposed sovereignty-defending resolution based on the
principles of seeking cross-Taiwan Strait peace, maintaining the
status quo in the strait and upholding ROC sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
The DPP will then fax copies of the revised draft bill to the
major opposition parties in the hope that the resolution will be
passed soon as an effective counterattack to Beijing's so-called
"anti-secession law," Tsai noted.
</P>
<P>
President Chen Shui-bian in his New Year address delivered Jan. 1
condemned Beijing's attempt to enact an anti-secession law, calling
it an effort to seek justification for a military invasion of Taiwan,
and therefore constituting a unilateral change of the status quo in
the Taiwan Strait and posing the biggest-ever threat to regional
stability and world peace.
</P>
<P>
The DPP submitted the proposed resolution to the Legislative Yuan
for debate last week but it was ignored by the opposition parties.
</P>
<P>
Tsai said that a revised resolution draft will be submitted again
next Tuesday to the Legislative Procedure Committee for debate and
screening.
</P>
<P>
Tsai noted that opposition lawmakers are welcome to jointly
author the content of the sovereignty-defending resolution so long as
three principles -- seeking cross-strait peace, maintaining the
status quo in the Taiwan Strait and upholding the ROC's sovereignty
-- are observed.
</P>
<P>
In the original copy, the DPP says that the ROC is a sovereign
state existing as a separate political entity to the mainland, that
this status quo should not be changed unless approved by all the
people of Taiwan via a nationwide referendum, and that the existence
of the ROC should be respected by the international community,
including the mainland.
</P>
<P>
Attempts, particularly attempts to use force, by any country in
the world to challenge the above-mentioned reality, regardless of
whether by legislation or policy-making, will be relentlessly
condemned and opposed by the people of Taiwan, the resolution says.
</P>
<P>
Responding to Tsai's call for support from the opposition parties,
Chen Chien-ming, a party whip of the legislative caucus of the Taiwan
Solidarity Union (TSU), an ally of the ruling DPP, said the TSU will
temporarily withhold its support until the DPP has clearly defined
ROC sovereignty.

'ANTI-SECESSION LAW' AIMED AT MAKING EXCUSE FOR INVADING TAIWAN
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Washington, Jan. 8 (CNA)
(By Wennie Chi and Deborah Kuo )
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Prominent mainland Chinese dissident Wei
Jingsheng, who has lived in exile overseas in recent years, said
Saturday that Beijing's proposed anti-secession law is a scheme to
seek legal justification for a military invasion of Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Wei was in Washington, D.C. Saturday to attend an anti-Chinese
communist rally staged by about 30 Chinese groups in the United
States calling for Chinese around the world to end communism.
</P>
<P>
In light of Beijing's drafting of the anti-secession law, Wei
said cross-Taiwan Strait relations are now even more jittery than
during 1996, when China test-fired live missiles and held
live-ammunition war games in the Taiwan Strait.
</P>
<P>
Wei said that some politicians in Taiwan thought that after Hu
Jintao replaced Jiang Zemin as the mainland Chinese president,
Beijing's attitude toward Taiwan would become milder. As a matter of
fact, he said, the "true colors" of the communists have surfaced once
again, demonstrated by the recent planning of the anti-secession law.
</P>
<P>
Invading Taiwan is a "big deal" and there have been many voices
opposed to the notion around the mainland in the past. However, Wei
said, it is increasingly noticeable in recent years that the mainland
leadership is attempting to "cook" the mainland people's patriotism
by taking advantage of rising pro-independence sentiment within
Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
To pave the way for the communists to teach Taiwan a lesson
militarily, the Beijing leadership has thought about enacting the
anti-secession law, Wei added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Wei said some people in Taiwan believe the mainland
will not attack Taiwan militarily based on economic considerations.
Wei urged these people not to harbor such beliefs any longer, saying
that the communists, as a whole, are basically a daring group
willing to take risks. Citing history as an example, Wei said that
some 50 years ago, the communists managed to defeat the Nationalist 
forces and take control of the whole of the mainland simply because
they "dared to."
</P>
<P>
Believing that Beijing's passing of the anti-secession law is an
irreversible trend, Wei suggested that Taiwan first adjust its
foreign policy to strengthen bilateral exchanges with the United
States and other countries so as to win their support.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, he said, Taiwan should also improve publicity
toward the mainland people. Showing goodwill to the communist rulers
is useless, Wei claimed, adding that it is more important to win the
hearts and souls of the mainland people rather than their rulers.
</P>
<P>
Wei, who once said that maintaining Taiwan's interests is
tantamount to maintaining a source of hope for democratization in
mainland China, has also claimed that the United States will not come
to Taiwan's rescue under any circumstances.
</P>
<P>
Wei was imprisoned for 18 years on the mainland for his
pro-democracy activities and criticism of the Beijing authorities.

GOVERNMENT EYES WUCHIU ISLET FOR NEW TOURISM, RELIGION HUB
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei, Jan. 9 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Executive Yuan is eyeing the Republic of
China-held tiny outlying islet of Wuchiu -- located between Matsu and
Kinmen islands -- as a new tourist attraction, as well as a religion
hub for followers of the goddess Matsu across the Taiwan Strait.
</P>
<P>
With its beautiful coastline and surrounding blue seas, Wuchiu,
which is under the acting jurisdiction of the Kinmen county
government, could be turned into a tourist attraction, especially
because of its streets of stone cabins built in unknown years by
unknown people, Chang Ching-sen, an Executive Yuan official in charge
of promoting tourism in offshore island areas, said Sunday after
making a field trip to Wuchiu Jan. 4.
</P>
<P>
Wuchiu, with its unique military bastion and related buildings,
could also be remodeled into a recreational center for young people
interested in picking up combat skills and playing war games, Chang
said.
</P>
<P>
The tiny island of just 1.2 square kilometers could also be
turned into a religion hub, given its proximity to Fujian Province's
Meizhou City, where Matsu is said to have originated, Chang said.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of Taiwan worshippers of Matsu would see their annual
pilgrimages to the mainland greatly shortened if they could proceed
to Meizhou City via Taichung and Wuchiu, Chang added.
</P>
<P>
Wuchiu's name hit the front pages of local newspapers in recent
years after it was chosen by Taiwan Power Company (Taipower) as a
dump site for Taipower's nuclear waste. The plan was aborted after
opposition by the locals as well as the central government.
</P>
<P>
Currently, about 500 soldiers and officers are posted on the
islet. Only about 50 civilians live there.

U.S. HAS BRIEFED TAIWAN ON 'ANTI-SECESSION LAW' TALKS WITH BEIJING
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Jan. 9 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
U.S. officials have briefed the Republic of
China's representative office in Washington, D.C. on their recent
talks with a senior mainland Chinese official in charge of Taiwan
affairs, a Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) official said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Chen Yunlin, director of the Taiwan Affairs Office of mainland
China's State Council, visited the United States last week. His visit
came amid reports that the mainland's rubber-stamp legislature -- the
National People's Congress -- will pass an anti-secession law in
March. As the proposed legislation will create a legal pretext for
Beijing to use military force to unify Taiwan, Chen's visit was
believed to be aimed at dissuading the Bush administration from
opposing the so-called anti-secession law.
</P>
<P>
The MOFA official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the
ROC government has come to know about the content of Chen's talks
with relevant U.S. authorities through Taiwan's representative office
in Washington.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, MOFA spokesman Michel Lu said President Chen Shui-bian
has named Academia Sinica President Lee Yuan-tseh to head a
delegation to Washington to attend the Jan. 20 second inauguration of
U.S. President George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
Lee will attend the inauguration as Chen's special envoy, Lu
said, adding that the MOFA has informed the U.S. authorities of the
roster of delegation members.
</P>
<P>
The MOFA will publicize the delegation member list when all
administrative formalities are completed, Lu said.
</P>
<P>
MOFA sources said the nation's top mainland policy planner --
Mainland Affairs Council Chairman Joseph Wu -- will be among the
mission members.
</P>
<P>
Other delegates will include legislators from the ruling and
opposition parties -- Kuo Cheng-liang of the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party, Sun Kuo-hua of the Kuomintang, Sun Ta-chien of the
People First Party and Wu Tung-sheng of the Taiwan Solidarity Union.
A research fellow from Academia Sinica, the nation's foremost
research body, will also join the delegation.
</P>
<P>
As the Legislative Yuan is busy screening several critical bills
and the central government's 2005 budget plan, the sources said, the
mission roster may still be subject to changes.
</P>
<P>
According to the sources, Lee, a co-winner of the 1986 Nobel
Prize in chemistry, will first attend an international meeting in
Santa Barbara, California before going on to Washington around Jan.
18, and is scheduled to return to Taipei two days after Bush's
inauguration.
</P>
<P>
In line with past precedent, the delegation is expected to meet
with U.S. administration officials and congressional members as well
as think tank scholars during the visit.
</P>
<P>
But Lee said a day earlier that he is going for no other purpose
but to be Chen's envoy at the inauguration. He said he will leave
discussions on Taiwan-U.S. relations and related issues to other
members of his delegation.
</P>
<P>
MOFA officials said the delegation members will have different
itineraries after attending the inauguration. While Lee and some
delegation members will return first, others will stay for talks with
American officials, scholars and experts. Topics expected to be
addressed will include Beijing's anti-secession legislation, Chen
Yun-lin's just-concluded U.S. visit, Taiwan's long-stalled NT$610.8
billion arms procurement package and President Chen's plan to form a
special commission to promote peaceful developments on both sides of
the Taiwan Strait.

TAIPEI, BEIJING REACH TACIT AGREEMENT ON HOLIDAY CHARTER FLIGHTS: DPP
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Jan. 9 (CNA)
(By Luis Huang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Cabinet-level Mainland Affairs Council
(MAC) has reached a tacit agreement with Beijing civil aviation
authorities about the basic principles for the launch of direct
charter flights across the Taiwan Strait during the Lunar New Year
holiday, a legislator of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) disclosed Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Legislator Tsai Huang-liang, who also serves as secretary-general
of the DPP's legislative caucus, made the remarks after a delegation
from the opposition Kuomintang (KMT) headed for mainland China
earlier in the day to help the aviation sector arrange direct
cross-strait charter flights to be operated during this year's
holiday period.
</P>
<P>
Tsai told reporters that the MAC, the top agency in charge of
charting Taiwan's policies toward the mainland, and Beijing's Civil
Aviation Administration of China (CAAC) have reached a tacit
agreement that the proposed cross-strait charter flight services will
be offered by carriers on both sides under the principle of "two-way,
multi-destination, non-stop flights."
</P>
<P>
Representatives from the Taipei Airlines Association (TAA) ,
authorized by the MAC to negotiate with the Beijing authorities on
the issue, have contacted the CAAC to help arrange cross-strait
holiday charter flights for Taiwanese businessmen operating on the
mainland, Tsai pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Although the planned charter flight services can be achieved
through negotiations between the civil aviation sectors of both
sides, Tsai went on, the DPP's legislative caucus is happy to see
the KMT delegation traveling to the mainland to negotiate with the
Beijing authorities on the issue.
</P>
<P>
As for the criticism by some pro-independence activists that the
proposed "no-stopover in a third place "is tantamount to direct air
links between Taiwan and the mainland, Tsai explained that this is an
expedient move aimed at making the much-anticipated holiday charter
flights a reality for the convenience of the large number of
mainland-based Taiwanese businessmen wishing to return for family
reunions.
</P>
<P>
"It is acceptable in principle for the charter flights
exclusively for the Lunar New Year holiday to fly over the aviation
information zone of a third country," Tsai said.
</P>
<P>
However, he stressed that the issue of future direct air links
involves the country's sovereignty and is different from the holiday
charters, so they must be negotiated by the Taipei-based Straits
Exchange Foundation and the Beijing-based Association for Relations
Across the Taiwan Strait.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Chen Chien-ming, convener of the legislative caucus of
the opposition Taiwan Solidarity Union, said that his party supports
the planned holiday flight services, but added that such flights
should be operated under the principles of safety, dignity, equality
and reciprocity.
</P>
<P>
With the consent of the Beijing authorities, six Taiwan carriers
operated Lunar New Year charter flights in 2003 between Shanghai and
Taipei/Kaohsiung via Hong Kong/Macau. The services were discontinued
the following year because Beijing insisted that mainland carriers
also be allowed to join the service but refused to come to the
negotiating table to discuss the issue with Taiwan.

UNIFICATION VS. INDEPENDENCE SHOULD BE SET ASIDE: PFP LAWMAKER
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei, Jan. 9 (CNA)
(By Luis Huang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A senior legislator of the opposition People
First Party (PFP) called on the ruling and opposition parties Sunday
to set aside the unification versus independence debate in order to
reach reconciliation among domestic political parties as soon as
possible.
</P>
<P>
Legislator Liu Wen-hsiung, who is also chief convener of the PFP
caucus in the Legislative Yuan, made the appeal against the backdrop
that President Chen Shui-bian has been seeking to end long-term
inter-party disagreements and bickering since the Dec. 11
legislative elections, in which the "pan-green camp" failed to gain a
majority in the 225-seat legislature.
</P>
<P>
Although it is impossible for the ruling Democratic Progressive
Party (DPP) to give up what Liu described as its pro-independence
ideology at present, he claimed that setting aside the unification
versus independence debate is the consensus of opinion of a majority
of the people of Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Only when the DPP expresses willingness to freeze its "Taiwan
independence platform" in a certain period of time and signs a formal
statement on a public occasion will the gateway to inter-party
reconciliation be opened, according to Liu.
</P>
<P>
Touching on a recent proposal by the opposition Kuomintang (KMT)
that KMT Chairman Lien Chan and his PFP counterpart, James Soong,
meet Chen to exchange views on national affairs, Liu said that Soong
has no intention of discussing with Chen issues concerning the
formation of the new Cabinet or inter-party negotiations.
</P>
<P>
The PFP will stick to its stance of defending the existence of
the Republic of China while opposing Taiwan independence, and will
not make inter-party cooperation an exchange of personal posts or
interests, he said.

A group of pro-democracy activists from
mainland China and members of local human rights groups and Taiwanese
expatriate communities in the United States staged a demonstration in
front of the Beijing Embassy in Washington, D.C. Saturday, urging the
international community to join forces to defend human rights in the
new year.
</P>
<P>
Representatives from about 40 different groups, including the
Free China Movement, gathered on the avenue in front of the mainland
Chinese embassy to participate in the demonstration staged by the

</P>
<P>
Wei Jingsheng, an exiled mainland Chinese pro-democracy activist,

communist regime has been persecuting the people on the mainland for
many years.

Nieh Sen, director of the branch office of the Epoch Times in
Washington, D.C., said that the activity was organized to echo a
joint campaign launched by more than 60 civic groups around the

PRESIDENTIAL OFFICE REBUTS 'CLOUDED LEOPARD' ARMORED VEHICLE REPORT
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Jan.  9 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Presidential Office debunked a media
report Sunday that the military has spent a huge sum of money
producing a new eight-wheel armored vehicle for emergency use by
President Chen Shui-bian and his family.
</P>
<P>
"The report is an outrageous distortion of facts, " Presidential
Office Deputy Secretary-General James Huang, said, adding that the
Presidential Office deeply regrets the report that he described as
"deliberately distorted."
</P>
<P>
Huang stressed that the military has developed the vehicle mainly
to cope with Taiwan's special terrain and to upgrade the military's
overall combat capabilities.
</P>
<P>
The so-called Clouded Leopard vehicle development project has
nothing to do with the Wanchun Plan, which refers to a program
related to vehicles to be used by the president under emergency
circumstances, Huang said.
</P>
<P>
"The new armored vehicle is not designed to meet the president's
special needs. It is designed to grapple with Taiwan's topography and
upgrade the military's combat prowess," Huang added.
</P>
<P>
An evening newspaper claimed Sunday that the military has spent
NT$60 million producing the eight-wheel armored vehicle for emergency
use by the first family.
</P>
<P>
The report said Chen will preside over the commissioning of the
vehicle at a military-run factory in the central county of Nantou
Jan. 11.
</P>
<P>
The new vehicle, which was developed under a project code-named
Clouded Leopard, will be able to carry eight people, the report said,
adding that the new vehicle is bigger than an armored vehicle in use
at present.
</P>
<P>
The report further said the locally produced vehicle is only
about one-quarter of the cost of a U.S.-built armored vehicle.

DEFENSE MINISTRY REFUTES ARMORED VEHICLE REPORT

<P>
The Ministry of National Defense (MND)
refuted a media report Sunday that the military has spent NT$60
million manufacturing a new eight-wheel armored vehicle for emergency
use by President Chen Shui-bian and his family.
</P>
<P>
"The military has just completed research and development of a
new armored vehicle style which has not been put into mass
production, " the MND's Office of Military Spokesman said in a press
statement.
</P>
<P>
Stressing that the new-style armored vehicle, which has been
developed under a project code-named Clouded Leopard, has just
undergone initial testing, the MND press statement said it is
premature to calculate the cost of each new-style armored vehicle.
</P>
<P>
The press release further said that local news media have
recently often speculated on military defense affairs without
bothering to verify their reports.
</P>
<P>
"We are hopeful that local media can exercise prudence in dealing
with defense-related affairs to avoid endangering national security
and violating existing national security regulations, " the press
statement said.
</P>
<P>
An evening newspaper claimed Sunday that the military has spent
NT$60 million producing an eight-wheel armored vehicle for emergency

1,338 PHOTOS PUBLISHED FEATURING EX-PRESIDENT'S CAREER, FAMILY LIFE
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei, Jan. 9 (CNA)
(BY Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Former President Lee Teng-hui said Sunday at
a ceremony to mark the launch of a collection of 1,338 photos
documenting his career and family life that he has never wavered on
his basic political ideal of doing things based on the stance of the
people of Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
"My opponents have branded me as a fickle politician. They
blamed me for intending to 'terminate' the Republic of China of which
I was once a president. Their critique is superficial and frivolous.
Since I joined politics, I have never changed my determination to do
things for the well-being of the people of Taiwan," Lee told his
supporters present at the ceremony.
</P>
<P>
During his 12-year presidency, Lee spared no efforts to promote
Taiwan's international profile and riled Beijing by defining
cross-Taiwan Strait relations as "state-to-state" in nature. Since he
stepped down as the ROC head of state, Lee has become even more vocal
in promoting Taiwan's identity separate from China's.
</P>
<P>
Lee said his ideology has never changed. "But now, as a
private citizen, I have more freedom to do what I think I have
to do." he added.
</P>
<P>
The photo collection was published in coincidence with Lee's 84th
birthday on the lunar calendar.
</P>
<P>
The collection contains many treasurable photos featuring Lee's
interaction with the late President Chiang Ching-kuo, including a
1975 photo showing Lee accompanying Chiang on an inspection tour
of the frontline island of Matsu in his capacity as a
minister-without-portfolio.
</P>
<P>
Although Lee's relations with two current opposition leaders --
Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Lien Chan and People First Party Chairman
James Soong have soured, the album contains a number of photos
featuring Lee's previous interactions with them. Lee used to be KMT
chairman for 12 years, but was expelled from the party over Taiwan's
identity issues.
</P>
<P>
Photos featuring Lee and his running mate Lien in the 1996
presidential election as well as those featuring Lee campaigning for
Soong in the run-up to the 1994 Taiwan provincial governor election
were documented in the collection.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the album contains a 1995 photo featuring Lee
paying a visit to then-Taipei Mayor Chen Shui-bian at the Taipei City
Hall. Chen is now ROC president.
</P>
<P>
The book also documents Lee's family life, including photos
taken during his formative years in the Japanese colonial
rule era as well as his wedding photo, those taken with his
parents and children and those featuring his recreational
activities.

<P>
Stephen Lam, director of Hong Kong's
Constitutional Affairs Bureau, hosted a dinner Friday in honor of
senior executives of a Taiwanese trade association in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
It marked the first time that a senior Hong Kong official has
ever feted Taiwan business executives in the former British colony.
</P>
<P>
Lam's rare goodwill gesture came after the Hong Kong government
rejected a visa application by Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou, a move that
has drawn a strong protest from the Republic of China government and
broadsides from the Hong Kong media.
</P>
<P>
A total of 17 board members of the Association of Taiwan Commerce
and Industry in Hong Kong attended the dinner hosted by Lam.
</P>
<P>
During the dinner, Lam was quoted as having said that the Hong
Kong government will reinforce dialogue and communications with
Taiwan through major Taiwan business groups.
</P>
<P>
Lam said Taiwan is Hong Kong's fourth largest trading partner,
with bilateral trade growing at an annual rate of 20 percent. In
2004, Taiwan companies launched 400 investment projects in Hong Kong.
Lam said HOng Kong has consistently attached great importance to
relations with Taiwan's business community.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, the association members suggested that the
Hong KOng government set up a Taiwan school for children of Taiwan
business people working here so as to attract more Taiwan investors.

<P>
A total of 1,513 new HIV carriers were
discovered in Taiwan last year, up more than 70 percent
from the 2003 level, the Department of Health (DOH) reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
DOH officials said the figure marked a five-fold growth from the

the new cases, 116 were female victims and 50 percent of them
were drug addicts.
</P>
<P>
Among the news cases, 859 involved Taiwan citizens, up 76 percent
from the number of new cases confirmed in 2003. The 2004 growth rate
was five times the average 15 percent growth recorded for the past
10 years.
</P>
<P>
DOH tallies also showed that more than 400 of the new carriers of
HIV, the virus that causes deadly AIDS, were drug addicts.
</P>
<P>
DOH officials said most drug addicted HIV carriers aged between
20 and 49.

<P>
Six high-ranking officials with the Taipei
Rapid Transit Corp. were disciplined Sunday and Monday for a New
Year's Eve escalator accident that injured five passengers at an MRT
station in Taipei.
</P>
<P>
Tsai Hui-sheng, general manager of the rapid transit corp., a
company run by the Taipei City Government, received a major demerit
by the city government's Department of Transportation for the
accident, in which one woman fell and got her hair caught in the
moving stairs, tearing off part of her scalp.
</P>
<P>
The rapid transit corporation was also fined NT$400,000 by the
department.
</P>
<P>
Five other rapid transit officials in charge of supervision,
transportation and management were given minor demerits Monday.
</P>
<P>
The transportation department made the ruling after a probe into
the escalator accident conducted by transportation department
officials, officials from the Ministry of Transportation and
Communications, and academics from three universities in Taipei.
</P>
<P>
Tsai and the rapid transit officials have been under mounting
criticism since the Jan. 1 accident despite repeatedly apologizing to
the injured and their families.
</P>
<P>
In response to the disciplinary action, Tsai said Monday that he
fully accepts the punishment and will review his and the rapid
transit corporation's ability to react to accidents on the MRT.

TAIWAN EXPORTS TO MAINLAND EXPAND GREATLY
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Jan.  10  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taiwan's exports to mainland China,
including Hong Kong and Macau, increased to 37.11 percent of the
island's overall export trade in the third quarter of 2004, making
mainland China the largest export outlet for Taiwan products,
government statistics showed Monday.
</P>
<P>
Officials from the Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and
Statistics (DGBAS) said 2003's Q3 mainland export level was 8.81
percent, marking a jump of a whopping 28.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan exports to the United States, however, declined by 2
percentage points to 16.63 percent in the same quarter, DGBAS
officials said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Taiwan's imports from Japan rose to 26.39 percent of
the island's entire import trade in Q3 2004, from 24.62 percent
posted in the corresponding quarter of 2003, making Japan the largest
import source of Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Manufactured products made up the bulk, or 98.5 percent, of
Taiwan's overall exports in Q3 2004, while the remaining 1.5 percent
were agricultural products, DGBAS officials said.
</P>
<P>
The officials attributed the increased amount and value of the
exports of industrial products mainly to the fact that Q3 is
traditionally strong for exports of electronics and
telecommunications products and because of a surge in steel prices on
the international market.
</P>
<P>
They attributed the increased amount and value of the imports of
capital equipment and agricultural as well as industrial raw
materials mainly to the fact that major investment and development
projects around Taiwan have begun and costs for most kinds of raw
materials have been raised in international markets.
</P>
<P>
By comparison, they added, the import of consumer products
declined by 1.1 percentage points to 8.05 percent of the island's
overall imports in Q3 2004.

DPP COMMUNICATING WITH PFP: KAOHSIUNG MAYOR
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Jan.  10 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Kaohsiung Mayor Frank Hsieh confirmed on
Monday that the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) is
communicating with the second-largest opposition People First Party
(PFP) on party-to-party cooperation and the DPP will announce any
breakthroughs.
</P>
<P>
Hsieh also said communicating with the PFP is for the sake of
political stability, and that PFP Chairman James Soong has not made
any demands for the party to hold any specific government positions.
</P>
<P>
The mayor spoke as the pro-independence DPP and the
pro-unification PFP -- parties at the opposite ends of the political
spectrum -- are appearing to move toward a partnership amid reports
that they could even form a coalition government.
</P>
<P>
Hsieh said that the president's effort to build bridges of trust
between parties is not limited to only the PFP and could also
include the Kuomintang (KMT).
</P>
<P>
Asked whether the new cooperative spirit will start with the
election of the next speaker of the new Legislative Yuan on Feb. 1,
Hsieh said reconciliation between parties should not be about who
gets what post so that the process does not get mired in political
horse-trading.
</P>
<P>
Instead of haggling over trading posts, Hsieh said party-to-party
cooperation is about sharing responsibility and divvying up the work.
However, he said that it is only natural that some positions be
assigned according to a deference to political affiliation.
</P>
<P>
The former DPP chairman also said that the president stated
clearly in his new year's speech that anything can be discussed
between parties that is beneficial to the stability of domestic
politics, creates harmony between ethnic groups, increases public
welfare and improves cross-strait relations.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a DPP party whip in the Legislative Yuan echoed
Hsieh's words, saying that President Chen's advocacy of
party-to-party dialogue is for the sake of domestic politics and "to
try to unify a splintered country."
</P>
<P>
It is by no means an attempt to drive a wedge between the
"pan-blue alliance" of the KMT and the PFP as reports quoting KMT
high-ranking officials have said, Lee Chun-yi said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Lee also said that the KMT is getting nervous about the
possibility of a DPP-PFP alliance and is trying to block such
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Although the "pan-blue alliance" maintained its majority in the
Dec. 11 legislative elections, the KMT, which won 79 seats in the
225-seat legislature, will find it impossible to dominate the
legislature without the support of its ally, the PFP, which now has
34 seats. The DPP is still the largest party in the legislature with
89 seats.

<TEXT>
<P>
President Chen Shui-bian said Monday he
will do his utmost to foster an atmosphere conducive to
reconciliation between the ruling and opposition parties to
facilitate political reform and national development.
</P>
<P>
Chen made the pledge while meeting with Taiwanese expatriate
community leaders from various Central American countries.
</P>
<P>
Noting that global competition has become ever more intense in
the 21st century, Chen said Taiwan should consolidate internal unity
and redouble efforts to upgrade its overall competitiveness and
retain market niches.
</P>
<P>
"At the moment, putting an end to the 'war of attrition' between
the ruling and opposition parties and streamlining the chaotic
domestic political situation are our most important tasks, " Chen
said.
</P>
<P>
As the nation's leader, Chen said he is determined to make every
possible effort to create a stable environment for rational and
sincere party-to-party dialogue and consultations.
</P>
<P>
"We'll do whatever we can to promote inter-party reconciliation
to usher in a new era of dialogue and consultations for accelerated
political reform and national development," Chen added.
</P>
<P>
During his talks with Taiwanese community leaders from Central
America, Chen also expressed his desire to attend the fifth summit
meeting between the ROC and its Central American allies to be held in
Central America later this year. The exact venue and date for the
summit meeting has not been set.
</P>
<P>
"Central America is our diplomatic stronghold, with many of our
allies located in the region. I have fond memories of each of my
trips there, " Chen said, adding that he is grateful for the
whole-hearted support of Taiwanese expatriates in those countries for
the ROC's diplomatic cause over the past years.
</P>
<P>
Later in the day, Chen received Paraguayan House of
Representatives Speaker Oscar Ruben Salomon Fernandez and conferred
him with a decoration in recognition of his contribution to the
promotion of ROC-Paraguay relations.
</P>
<P>
Chen told Salomon that he hopes he can travel to Paraguay this
year to meet with Paraguayan President Nicanor Duarte and sign a free
trade agreement (FTA) between the two countries. Taiwan-Paraguayan
FTA negotiations have been proceeding smoothly, he added.

The Times: Brown seeks truce as 'trust'
insult harms election unity.

Gordon Brown called for a truce with Tony Blair last night after
further evidence of their tortured relationship threatened to damage
the Labour Party and his own leadership prospects. After a string of
reports yesterday suggesting that relations between Mr Blair and Mr
Brown had reached a crisis, the Chancellor took the highly unusual
step of inviting in the television cameras to demand unity between
the rival camps. Labour could not go into an election campaign
seeming divided at the top, he said.

Financial Times: Blair and Brown try to paper over cracks.

Tony Blair and Gordon Brown will on Monday stage a show of unity
at a meeting of Labour MPs as they seek to move beyond the bitter
tensions that have engulfed them ahead of this year's general
election. But although the chancellor on Sunday night issued a robust
call for Labour to unite in the run up to polling day, there was no
sign that fundamental diferences with the prime minister over the
organisation of the election campaign have been resolved.

FOREIGN MINISTRY DENIES ALL RELIEF GOODS STUCK AT AIRPORT
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Jan. 10 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The spokesman for the Ministry of Foreign
Affairs denied media reports Monday that all of Taiwan's relief goods
meant to be sent to South Asian countries are stuck at Chiang
Kai-shek International Airport because of diplomatic barriers.
</P>
<P>
Michel Lu said that as of Sunday, more than 20 metric tons of
relief goods, medical supplies and disinfection materials have been
airlifted by China Airlines to Indonesia, the hardest-hit country by
the Dec. 26 earthquake-tsunamis.
</P>
<P>
Lu assured that relief goods are getting through and there has
been no political interference to interrupt Taiwan's humanitarian
aid.
</P>
<P>
The 20-odd tonnes of relief goods have been handed to members of
the Buddhist Compassionate Relief Tzu Chi Foundation, the Taiwan
Businessmen's Association and the Taiwan Alumni Society in Indonesia
for distribution, Lu added.
</P>
<P>
The foreign ministry hopes that military transport planes can be
allowed to join Taiwan's relief goods transport fleet so that the
relief goods currently stockpiled can be airlifted to South Asia in
the shortest possible time, Lu said, adding that hopefully the
countries earmarked to receive the aid will agree to this.
</P>
<P>
Lu also denied that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has told
private charitable organizations not to send relief goods to other
South Asia countries, such as Sri Lanka and the Maldives, where
Taiwan does not have liaison offices.
</P>
<P>
The private group of Taiwan Roots Medical Peace Corps has
contacted the Sri Lankan government which has agreed to take 1,000
tonnes of rice from Taiwan. However, he pointed out, the bags of rice
bear the Republic of China national flag.
</P>
<P>
If that turns out to be a problem, Lu said, the foreign ministry
will ask that the rice be repacked to facilitate delivery to Sri
Lanka.
</P>
<P>
So far, there is no plan yet to send relief goods to the Maldives
since having been asked of their needs, representatives of the
country have not replied, he said.

DPP HAS NO PLAN TO CHANGE PARTY PLATFORM: DPP SECRETARY-GENERAL
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Jan. 10 (CNA)
(By Y.F. Low)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)
Secretary-General Chang Chun-hsiung affirmed Monday that the party
has no plan to revise its platform.
</P>
<P>
Chang made the remarks in the wake of a recent proposal by DPP
Legislator Lee Wen-chung that the party revise its "pro-independence
platform" to facilitate its cooperation with the pro-unification
opposition People First Party (PFP).
</P>
<P>
Senior PFP Legislator Liu Wen-hsiung has expressed his approval
to Lee's proposal, saying that many things are negotiable between the
DPP and PFP if the DPP freezes its "pro-independence platform" for
five to 15 years.
</P>
<P>
In a statement, however, Chang said the DPP sees no need for
revising its platform because the document reflects the historical
fact of the path the DPP has taken.
</P>
<P>
The various resolutions and campaign manifestoes adopted by the
party, which include the resolutions on Taiwan's self-determination,
economic development and ethnic multiplicity, are what guide the
DPP's policies at present, Chang said.
</P>
<P>
The resolution on Taiwan's self-determination passed in 1999
outweighed the party platform that pursues the foundation of the
"Republic of Taiwan." The resolution states that Taiwan is an
independent, sovereign state whose official name is the Republic of
China and that any decision to change the status quo must be made by
the people through a national plebiscite.
</P>
<P>
Chang said all the advocacies put forth by the DPP are
pragmatically idealistic and have the potential to become the
consensus of Taiwan society.
</P>
<P>
Chang said as the ruling party, the DPP has the responsibility to
meet people's expectations for political stability, inter-party
cooperation and political reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
Despite the differences in their positions, there should be room
for cooperation between political parties as long as national
interests are prioritized over partisan interests, he suggested.
</P>
<P>
Over the past 18 years since the DPP's foundation, the party has
followed the core values of Taiwanization, democracy, justice and
sustainable development, he said.
</P>
<P>
On a report that said that the government plans to extend the
service life of the three existing nuclear power plants from 40 years
to 60 years, Chang noted that the DPP is promoting the development of
alternative sources of energy and is against building any new nuclear
power plants.
</P>
<P>
He said building a non-nuclear country to protect the sustainable
development of Taiwan is a long-standing aim of the DPP and was also
a consensus reached between the ruling and opposition parties in
2002.

KMT DELEGATION CLAIMS CROSS-STRAIT CHARTER FLIGHTS FINALIZED
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Beijing,  Jan.  10 (CNA)
(By Stanley Cheung and Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A visiting opposition Kuomintang (KMT)
delegation from Taiwan claimed Monday that Lunar New Year charter
flights for Taiwan businessmen operating in mainland China have been
finalized.
</P>
<P>
The delegation made the claim after a one-hour meeting with Chen
Yunlin, director of Beijing's Taiwan Affairs Council.
</P>
<P>
KMT Legislator Tseng Yung-chuan issued a statement after the
meeting that the mechanism for cross-strait charter flights during
the holiday period was "officially inaugurated" Monday.
</P>
<P>
"The three principles that we insisted upon, including joint
participation in the two-way, multi-point flights with no stopovers
in third countries or areas have won Chen's consent," Tseng said.
</P>
<P>
Tseng claimed the services are finalized and that other technical
issues will be left for discussion among the various carriers wishing
to offer the flights.
</P>
<P>
KMT Legislator John Chang, another delegation member, described
Monday's talks as important and said Beijing has agreed that the
mainland flight departure points be extended from Shanghai to
Beijing, Guangzhou, Shenzhen, Fuzhou and Xiamen.
</P>
<P>
Cross-strait charter flights were inaugurated on a trial basis
during the 2003 Chinese New Year holiday with Taiwan carriers
operating between Shanghai and Taipei/Kaohsiung, with transfers via
Hong Kong or Macau. Charter flights were not offered during the 2004
Chinese New Year holiday because Beijing wanted mainland carriers to
also be allowed to offer flights but refused to discuss technical
details with the Taiwan authorities.
</P>
<P>
However, a legislator from the ruling Democratic Progressive
Party said a day earlier that the Cabinet-level Mainland Affairs
Council (MAC) had already reached a tacit agreement with Beijing
civil aviation authorities about the basic principles for the launch
of direct cross-strait charter flights during the Chinese New Year
holiday.
</P>
<P>
Tsai Huang-liang, DPP whip in the Legislative Yuan, said that the
Taipei Airlines Association, which was commissioned by the MAC to
talk with Beijing in Macau, had already reached agreement on the
issue.

CABINET DENIES REPORT OF LONGER SERVICE LIFE FOR NUCLEAR POWER PLANTS
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Jan. 10 (CNA)
(By Y.F. Low)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A spokesman for the Executive Yuan denied
Monday a report that the government plans to extend the service life
of the three existing nuclear power plants to cope with the problem
of a global energy shortage.
</P>
<P>
Chen Chi-mai described the report as false after verifying the
situation with the Ministry of Economic Affairs and the state-run
Taiwan Power Company (Taipower).
</P>
<P>
In a front-page story Monday, the Liberty Times claimed that
Taipower has recently been ordered to plan on extending the service
life of the three nuclear power plants from 40 years to 60 years,
based on a proposal by Academia Sinica President Lee Yuan-tseh, who
is the top technological adviser to the Executive Yuan.
</P>
<P>
The government's goal of making the island nuclear free would
have been delayed to 2050 as a result of the extension, according to
the report.
</P>
<P>
Chen reaffirmed that the government's ultimate goal of building a
nuclear-free country, which he said is a consensus of the ruling and
opposition parties, remains unchanged.
</P>
<P>
With climate change having become the most important
environmental issue in the world, every country is obliged to do its
part to reduce the release of gases that could worsen global warming,
Chen said.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan shares a responsibility, even though it is not a member of
the United Nations, Chen said, noting that Premier Yu Shyi-kun
appointed a panel to work on measures to reduce global greenhouse
gases in October last year.
</P>
<P>
He said the Executive Yuan hopes the Legislative Yuan will pass a
law aimed at promoting the goal of a nuclear-free country as soon as
possible.

TAIWAN INVESTMENT IN MAINLAND CHINA EXCEEDS US$40 BILLION: MOEA
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Jan.  10 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taiwan's private sector channeled some
US$40.47 billion into mainland China for a total of 32,990 investment
projects over the 13 years between January 1991 and November 2004,
the Investment Commission under the Ministry of Economic Affairs
reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
From January 2002, mainland-bound investment has exceeded 50
percent of Taiwan's overall investment overseas annually, making the
mainland the top receiving country in terms of Taiwan overseas
investment, officials from the Investment Commission said.
</P>
<P>
In the first 11 months of 2004, government-approved investment
projects on the mainland totaled 1,839, worth some US$6.16 billion,
the officials added.
</P>
<P>
Jiangsu, Guangdong, Zhejiang, Fujian and Hebei are the top five
mainland provinces in terms of Taiwan investment.
</P>
<P>
The top five domestic industries involved in mainland-bound
investment were electronic and electrical goods, basic metal,
chemicals, plastics and precision instrument manufacturing, according
to the Investment Commission.
</P>
<P>
The government has been making decisions on mainland-bound
investment based on three principles -- if the proposed investment
project is conducive to sharpening Taiwan industry's competitiveness
and helpful to the island's global business operations, the project
tends to be approved immediately; those "sunset" manufacturing
industries that can be revived only if they are relocated to the
mainland will be green-lighted without problems; and those
high-technology industries for which mainland relocation might lead
to the transfer or loss of core technologies will probably not be
approved.
</P>
<P>
As far as high-technology industries are concerned, the officials
said, only Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Corp. has been approved
to invest in the mainland for low-end IC chip foundry operations,
while the TFT-LCD industry is allowed to head to the mainland for
down-stream panel manufacturing.
</P>
<P>
The Taiwan authorities have not allowed the petrochemical
industry to establish naphtha cracking plants on the mainland so far,
they added.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics released by the mainland authorities,
Taiwan investors agreed to channel some US$75.44 billion into the
mainland for a total of 62,674 investment projects during the Jan. 1,
1991-November 30, 2004 period.
</P>
<P>
Only US$38.64 billion of the agreed-upon investment has been
spent on the 62,674 investment projects, according to the mainland
statistics.

TSU WANTS TO PLAY ACTIVE ROLE IN POLITICS
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Jan. 10 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The new chairman of the opposition Taiwan
Solidarity Union (TSU) said Monday that as long as it is beneficial
to Taiwan, the party is "willing to play an active role in politics
so that President Chen Shui-bian can focus on national development."
</P>
<P>
But Su Chin-chiang also said that although the TSU is an ally of
the ruling Democratic Progressive Party, it will maintain its
independent status and will have "different operations than other
political parties." He did not elaborate.
</P>
<P>
Su made the remarks after he was unanimously approved by the TSU
Central Executive Committee to take the helm of the party. Former TSU
Chairman Huang Tzu-wen stepped down from the post to take
responsibility for the worse-than-expected performance of the party
in the Dec. 11 legislative elections. The TSU garnered just 12 of the
225 seats in the legislature.
</P>
<P>
Su said that serving as the TSU chairman was not in his career
plan, but former President Lee Teng-hui, the so-called "spiritual
leader" of the TSU, told him he should not only focus on himself but
should concentrate on the whole country.
</P>
<P>
Su, who reportedly was favored by Lee for the chairmanship
despite two other aspirants who later were persuaded to bow out of
the running, said the party will move even closer to Taiwan's land
and its people, and will defend the nation's security.
</P>
<P>
On the key posts in the party, Su said he will follow through on
the resolutions passed by the Central Standing Committee to recruit
younger talent and that he hopes to finalize the lineup within a
week.
</P>
<P>
He also said that the TSU will make an overall planning and will 
not be absent from the year-end mayoral and magistrate elections.

TSU URGES MAC TO PUNISH KMT FOR CHARTER FLIGHT TALKS WITH BEIJING
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Jan. 10 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The opposition Kuomintang (KMT) should be
punished for holding unauthorized talks with Beijing on the launch of
direct cross-Taiwan Strait charter flights during the upcoming
Chinese New Year holiday, opposition Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU)
legislative whips said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Huang Chung-yuan, convener of the TSU legislative caucus, said
that since the government has already authorized the private Taipei
Airlines Association (TAA) to negotiate with Beijing on the proposed
holiday cross-strait charter flights, the KMT is not in a position to
discuss the issue with the mainland.
</P>
<P>
Huang was referring to the KMT's sending of a delegation to
Beijing Sunday to meet with mainland officials to discuss the holiday
charter flight issue.
</P>
<P>
"The KMT is just a private political group. Without government
authorization, the party does not have any legitimate position to
negotiate charter flight issues with Beijing. Otherwise, other
private associations, such as the General Chamber of Commerce of the
ROC and the National Association of Industries could also send
delegations to negotiate the issue," Huang said, pointing out that if
the terms reached between the KMT delegation and the mainland
authorities cannot be implemented under Taiwan law, the predicament
will not be resolved.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on the same occasion, Chen Chien-ming, deputy convener
of the TSU legislative caucus, said the KMT's move violates Article 4
of the Statute Governing the Relations Between the People of the
Taiwan Area and the Mainland Area, which bans private groups from
negotiating with the Beijing authorities without the government's
authorization.
</P>
<P>
Chen urged the Cabinet-level Mainland Affairs Council to penalize
the KMT for its rule-breaking move in holding unauthorized talks with
the mainland.
</P>
<P>
Chen further said he is worried that the pro-unification KMT
might compromise Taiwan's interests in its engagements with the
mainland.
</P>
<P>
Responding to the TSU criticism, Legislative Yuan President Wang
Jin-pyng, who is also a KMT vice chairman, claimed that he did not
know the details of the KMT's contacts with Beijing. Nevertheless, he
stressed that the KMT move was mainly aimed at pushing for
realization of the holiday charter flight plan.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the ruling Democratic Progressive Party's (DPP's)
legislative caucus said it is regrettable that the KMT has failed to
respect the government's stance and has unilaterally negotiated with
Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Lee Chun-yi, a DPP legislative whip, said the government will not
recognize the KMT's negotiation results because it has not received
the MAC's authorization.
</P>
<P>
Stressing that national interests supercede any partisan
interests, Lee said the KMT should keep in mind Taiwan's overall
interests in its engagements with the mainland. "No Taiwan party
should give room for the mainland to drive wedges to hurt our
national unity and interests, " Lee said, adding that the KMT
delegation should avoid becoming a tool for the mainland to propagate
its so-called anti-secession law aimed at creating a legal pretext to
use military force to take Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Cheng Wen-tsan, director of the DPP's information and publicity
department, said that as no single political party can represent the
country, the KMT should not try to "usurp" the government's power or
authority.
</P>
<P>
"It is not bad if the KMT intends to help clear the way for the
launch of Lunar New Year charter flights for the convenience of
Taiwan businessmen working on the mainland. But the KMT should not
try to 'usurp' the government's power," Cheng said.
</P>
<P>
As a matter of fact, Cheng added, the legally authorized TAA has
already almost completed negotiations with the relevant mainland
authorities over the holiday charter flight terms, making the KMT
attempt somewhat irrelevant.

DPP OPENS ARMS TO INTER-PARTY COOPERATION: CAUCUS WHIP

<TEXT>
<P>
To achieve inter-party cooperation and
parliamentary stability, the ruling Democratic Progressive Party is
willing to compromise in the upcoming election for president and vice
president of the Legislative Yuan, a DPP legislative caucus whip said
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Tsai Huang-liang explained that his party will act on the results
of the party-to-party negotiations that the DPP has recently been
pushing for, and that it may support a nominee of the opposition
People First Party to take the post of president of the Legislative
Yuan if the talks lead to such a result.

</P>
<P>
He noted that his party would probable vote for a Kuomintang
candidate to head the new opposition-controlled legislature, or even
give the posts of president and vice president of the Legislative
Yuan to the PFP, with which the DPP has been trying to bolster party
cooperation, if such an arrangement would benefit political
stability.
</P>
<P>
The DPP official made the remarks while answering questions from
reporters on his party's recent move to promote inter-party talks and
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
He said that the DPP has no predetermined position on the matter.

PROGRESS OF CHARTER SERVICE TALKS BOOSTS CROSS-STRAIT TIES: PRESIDENT

<TEXT>
<P>
The recent breakthrough in arrangements for
Lunar New Year charter flight services between Taiwan and mainland
China is an essential foundation for the normalization of
cross-Taiwan Strait relations, President Chen Shui-bian said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Chen was referring to the negotiations underway between the two
sides on the issue, which he said is a "historic, crucial moment" for
cross-strait relations.
</P>
<P>
The president made the remarks during a meeting with a visiting
delegation of the Committee of 100, an organization of Chinese
Americans.
</P>
<P>
Unlike last year, when the mainland authorities refused to
negotiate with Taiwan on the matter, Taipei Airlines Association
Chairman Lo Ta-hsiung, with the authorization of Taiwan's Mainland
Affairs Council (MAC) , reportedly held talks with Civil Aviation
Administration of China representatives in Macau Friday.
</P>
<P>
Reports said that the two sides have agreed in principle to allow
two-way, non-stop, multi-destination flights operated by carriers on
both sides. The MAC, however, has been tightlipped on the development
of the talks.
</P>
<P>
Pointing out that he expressed hope in his Jan. 1 New Year
address for achieving stability via consultation and dialogue, Chen
said consultations and dialogue are not only required between
different political parties in Taiwan but also between the two sides
of the Taiwan Strait.
</P>
<P>
Chen said the most precarious era is also the era with the most
opportunities and that the most difficult time is also the most
hopeful.
</P>
<P>
He said he hopes there will be good developments this year in
terms of Taiwan's relations with both the United States and the
mainland.
</P>
<P>
However, he expressed regret that Hong Kong rejected a visa
application by Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou, who originally had planned
to attend the Greater China annual meeting of the Committee of 100 to
be held in the Special Administrative Region.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong reports said that Ma was denied entry because he had
spoken out against Beijing's plan to enact an "anti-secession law"
targeting Taiwan.

MAC HOPES BEIJING WILL START CHARTER FLIGHTS BASED ON AGREED MODEL
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Jan. 10 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Cabinet-level Mainland Affairs Council
(MAC) said Monday that it hopes mainland China will honor its words
and use talks between Taiwan and Hong Kong on air transport in 2002
as a model for launching cross-Taiwan Strait charter flights during
the Lunar New Year holiday.
</P>
<P>
The MAC made the remarks in a press release after a Taiwan
delegation led by opposition Kuomintang (KMT) officials met with Chen
Yunlin, director of the Taiwan Affairs Office in Beijing Monday to
discuss flight services to facilitate the return of Taiwan people on
the mainland during the holiday.
</P>
<P>
According to the KMT delegation after the meeting, Chen accepted
the principles of "joint participation in the two-way,
multiple-destination flights with no stopovers in third countries or
regions."
</P>
<P>
Chen reportedly agreed that Taiwanese with travel documents to
the mainland, and not confined to Taiwan businessmen operating on the
mainland only, will be able to board the charter flights. He also
said Taipei Airlines Association representatives and air carriers can
travel to the mainland as soon as possible to discuss related
technical details with the mainland side.
</P>
<P>
The MAC said in the press release that it is gratified that
Beijing responded positively to Taiwan's suggestion for the charter
flights, and that the MAC also noted that a spokesman for the Taiwan
Affairs Council said Oct. 27 that air transport negotiations between
Taiwan and Hong Kong in 2002 can serve as a model for talks.
</P>
<P>
The air transport talks were completed successfully because they
were conducted by the private sector, with government officials
acting as advisers.
</P>
<P>
The MAC expressed hope that the mainland will honor its words and
seize the opportunity to embark on consultations in a way acceptable
to both sides.
</P>
<P>
The MAC said in the press release that the policy of promoting
the charter flights during the Chinese New Year period has been the
long-standing policy of the government and that the government has
long expressed that both sides could make appropriate arrangements
concerning the "joint participation of two-way, non-stop flights"
principles demanded by Beijing.
</P>
<P>
The government stated last November that Taiwan is willing to
base negotiations on Taiwan-Hong Kong air transport negotiations that
took place in 2002, the MAC said.
</P>
<P>
The MAC also commissioned the Taipei Airlines Association to go
to Macau earlier this month to help discuss the matter after Beijing
responded positively to Taiwan's appeal.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Ministry of Transportation and Communications said
it has already completed the planning on technical details for the
charter flight services.

ECONOMY CONTRIBUTES TO LOW BIRTH RATE: POLL
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Jan. 10 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Economic problems and worries about social
instability are the two major causes of local people's low interest
in having children, pollsters said Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Taipei-based Mother and Baby magazine conducted a survey
between August and September last year to explore local people's
willingness to have children. A total of 3,158 valid replies were
collected.
</P>
<P>
According to the survey results, men are less likely to want
children than women, with nearly 35 percent of male respondents
saying they did not want to have children, while only some 19 percent
of female respondents said so.
</P>
<P>
The survey found that 25.8 percent of female respondents said
they intend to have only one child, 27.6 percent said they want two,
19.1 percent said they want three, 9.1 percent said they hope to have
more than three, and 18.9 percent said they do not want any children.
</P>
<P>
In comparison, 31.5 percent of the males said they intend to have
only one child, 15.6 percent said they would prefer two, 13.2 percent
said they hope to have three, 5.1 percent said they want more than
three, and 34.6 percent said they do not want any children.
</P>
<P>
Major reasons cited by male respondents for their reluctance to
have children included economic problems or inability to afford the
cost of raising children (35.4 percent) , worries about social
instability (31.8 percent) and fear of losing personal freedom.
</P>
<P>
For female respondents, worry about inability to afford children
was the top cause (45.6 percent) , followed by fears about social
instability (31.7 percent) , fears of losing personal freedom (15.6
percent) and fear of birth pain or loss of figure (11.2 percent).
</P>
<P>
Chiang Kuei-hsiang, editor-in-chief of the magazine, said the
economy and social instability were major reasons for both men and
women being reluctant to have children. And the fact that more women
than men cited fears of losing personal freedom as a cause for their
reluctance to have children indicates that child-rearing remains
mostly a woman's responsibility, Chiang said, adding that some women
have chosen late marriage and late childbirth or even no marriage and
no children so that their career development will not be affected.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan's birth rate has been on a steady decline, with one woman
giving birth to an average of 1.24 children in 2003.

KINMEN PASSENGER SERVICE CENTER INAUGURATED

<TEXT>
<P>
Part of a newly built passenger service
center at a Kinmen harbor was inaugurated Monday to meet the needs of
passengers intending to travel via the "mini three links route, "
according to Kinmen Harbor Bureau Director Chang Kuo-tu.
</P>
<P>
The links refer to direct transportation services between
Taiwan-held Kinmen and Matsu islands and mainland China's ports of
Xiamen and Mawei in the absence of direct links between the mainland
and Taiwan proper, Chang said.
</P>
<P>
To keep the center working properly, the Kinmen police
authorities have made a number of arrangements, including mapping out
the traffic lines of people and vehicles, stepping up traffic
controls and rezoning waiting areas for taxis, Chang said.
</P>
<P>
Chang also said a floating wharf and a passage connecting the
wharf and the service center are scheduled to be inaugurated in late
June to increase the convenience of the "mini three links."
</P>
<P>
From Feb. 1, 12 ferries will head for Xiamen every day, compared
with the eight plying the route at present, Chang said, adding that
during the Chinese New Year holiday period between Feb.3 and 16, the
harbor will accept applications for additional ferries to serve the
route.

economic might and the importance of securing energy resources, and
the new defense initiative promulgated by Japan.
</P>
<P>
The report says that how Bush defines Washington's Asia policy
will be crucial to both Taiwan's external relations -- especially
since Bush's political decisions will shape developments -- and how
Taiwan can regain mutual trust with the United States,
which has been undermined since President Chen Shui-bian's insistence
on holding a national referendum prior to the March 20 presidential
election, as well as his advocacy of a new constitution.
</P>
<P>
The report also says that exchanges between Washington and
Beijing have been close over the past year and that both sides think
a tilt by Taiwan toward independence could change the status quo, so
that they have both started trying to nip the Taiwan independence
movement in the bud.
</P>
<P>
The report says that an anti-secession law planned by the
mainland that will be put to the full National People's Congress
review and approval in March, has cast uncertainty on the already
strained cross-Taiwan Strait situation.
</P>
<P>
The report also says that the mainland's expanding economic might
has been translated into economic diplomacy, with officials from East
Asia, Latin America and Singapore speaking out against Taiwan
internationally.
</P>
<P>
Faced with the growing anti-Taiwan independence campaign launched
by Beijing, as well as its use of economic and diplomatic might to
isolate Taiwan, the government has to adopt new strategies on the
diplomatic and strategic fronts, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan should also increase its cooperation with the United
States and Japan, with which Taiwan shares common interests, and
develop multilateral cooperation mechanisms, the report suggests.

<TEXT>
<P>
President Chen Shui-bian met his Malawi
counterpart Bingu Wa Mutharika Monday at the Presidential Office and
said that the Republic of China will eventually become a member of
the United Nations and obtain observer status in the World Health
Assembly with Malawi's support and assistance.
</P>
<P>
Chen told his guest, who arrived in Taipei earlier that same day
for a five-day official visit, that he based his confidence on the
U.N.'s principle of universality and the idea that health has no
boundaries, while Malawi has repeatedly spoken for the ROC's
unsuccessful bids for membership in those organizations.
</P>
<P>
Chen thanked Mutharika for the support and assistance his country
has extended to the ROC in the international arena.
</P>
<P>
He also expressed appreciation for Mutharika's firm support for
Taiwan's successful bid to become a member of the World Trade
Organization in January 2002, when he served as secretary-general of
the Common Market of Southeast Africa.
</P>
<P>
Accepting an invitation extended by Mutharika during the meeting,
Chen said he was proud to become the first ROC president to visit
Malawi when he toured the African ally in July 2002 and that he is
willing to visit Malawi again at an opportune time.
</P>
<P>
For his part, Mutharika said Malawi is keen to learn about
Taiwan's experience in transforming from a developing country to a
developed one.
</P>
<P>
Malawi supports Taiwan's membership of international
organizations because it believes Taiwan's experience can be shared
by other nations only when it becomes a member of such international
groups, he said.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Foreign Affairs Tan Sun Chen and Presidential Office
Secretary-General Su Tseng-chang were also present at the meeting.

BEIJING URGED TO ENGAGE IN PRAGMATIC CONSULTATIONS ON CHARTER FLIGHTS
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Jan.  10 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The government welcomes mainland China's
positive response to Taiwan's proposal for charter flights during the
Chinese New Year holiday and has expressed the hope that both sides
can engage in pragmatic consultations in a way acceptable to both
sides, a spokesman for the Executive Yuan said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Chen Chi-mai made the remarks after the mainland's Taiwan Affairs
Office reportedly announced the inauguration of a cross-strait
charter flight service mechanism for the Lunar New Year holiday after
a meeting earlier that day with a visiting delegation of opposition
Kuomintang (KMT) officials.
</P>
<P>
Chen said most of the public would disagree with the claim by the
KMT that it was instrumental in making the cross-strait charter
flight service consultations a reality.
</P>
<P>
He noted that Beijing's Taiwan Affairs Office said as far back
as October that it would be feasible to use Taiwan-Hong Kong air
transport negotiations that took place in 2002 as model for charter
flight service talks, whereupon President Chen Shui-bian expressed
willingness to engage in pragmatic consultations based on that model.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan has repeatedly said that it will make appropriate
arrangements with regard to demands by Beijing on "joint participation
on two-way flights with no stopovers in third countries or areas."

</P>
<P>
When Beijing responded positively to Taiwan's appeal Jan.
3, the Mainland Affairs Council then commissioned the Taipei Airlines
Association to talk with the mainland authorities in Macau, showing
that Taiwan has displayed sincerity and flexibility in bringing
about the cross-strait charter flight services.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Chiu Tai-san, MAC vice chairman, said that from
Beijing's remarks on the cross-strait charter flights, the council
has confirmed that both sides have reached consensus on the
principles of "two-way, multiple destination, no stopover" charter
services.
</P>
<P>
Chiu said that the two sides will engage in a second stage of
dialogue to reach consensus on the model for bilateral consultations
and on the teams that will participate in the discussions.

VP URGES HI-TECH INDUSTRY TO SHOULDER MORE RESPONSIBILITIES
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Jan.  10 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Vice President Annette Lu called on the
country's hi-tech industry Monday to shoulder more responsibilities
for the country.
</P>
<P>
Giving a speech at the 7th National Science and Technology
Conference, Lu said the hi-tech industry should improve the people's
livelihoods, upgrade culture, strengthen national defenses and help
the country's diplomacy and economy.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the added-value produced by the hi-tech industry
decreased from NT$718.9 billion (US$22.46 billion) in 2000 to
NT$604.6in 2004, Lu said it is alarming that the figure has decreased
by 15.9 percent in the last three years.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, the vice president said, the hi-tech industry, whose
fixed investment accounts for 13.4 percent of the country's whole
fixed investment, creates about 6.4 percent of the country's jobs and
provides only 1.4 percent of the country's indirect revenues, which
are not commensurate with its huge investment.
</P>
<P>
She urged the country's hi-tech firms to realize their
responsibility for the country's safety, claiming that their
investment in mainland China will inevitably upgrade the mainland's
power to the detriment of Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
The hi-tech industry can help the country in the diplomatic field
by exercising its influence with multinational hi-tech companies and
draw the world's attention to the mainland's threat to Taiwan, which,
according to Lu, would force Beijing to mend its ways.

The Straits
Times: EDB exceeds target for investments.

Unexpectedly strong investment pledges from
foreign and local investors last year, including
$8.3 billion for Singapore's factories, look set
to produce a bumper crop of 21,800 new jobs.

New figures, which have confounded sceptics'
doubts, show that the Economic Development 
Board (EDB) lifted investment commitments to 
the key manufacturing sector by a strong 11 per 
cent from 2003, beating the EDB's own forecast.

Even more impressive was a 20 per cent
jump to $2.3 billion in total business 
spending, a yardstick for measuring investment in
service industries, such as the information 
communications and media services sectors.

The Lianhe Zaobao:S'pore's GDP will increase
S$10 billion and create 20 thousand new jobs
this year.

The Economic Development Board (EDB) expects
to see a drop in manufacturing investments this
year because of the softening in the global
electronics sector.

But the EDB says Singapore will still
attract some S$8b worth of manufacturing
investments, dipping some 3.6% from 2004.

And these investment commitments, when
realised, are expected to create 21,800 new 
jobs,and the GDP will increase S$10 billion.

<TEXT>
<P>
President Chen Shui-bian presided over the
christening ceremony for a locally developed eight-wheeled armored
vehicle Tuesday, naming the new vehicle "Yunpao" meaning "Clouded
Leopard" for its agility and mobility.
</P>
<P>
At the ceremony held at a military equipment maintenance center
in the central county of Nantou, President Chen signed his name on a
prototype armored vehicle next to a plaque showing the name "Yunpao."
</P>
<P>
Chen lauded the military research team responsible for developing
the CM-32 eight-wheeled armored vehicle as a "warrior of life" for
its ability to complete research and development of the new armored
personnel carrier in two years at a very low cost.
</P>
<P>
The president also explained that the vehicle got its name
because it could move agilely over rough terrain just as the Formosan
clouded leopard -- a species said to be endemic to Taiwan, although
the animal is almost never seen.
</P>
<P>
Chen said the military will transfer technological know-how to
private companies to produce the new armored vehicle.
</P>
<P>
"We believe that the 'Yunpao' development project will create
business opportunities worth billions of dollars for the private
sector, including production, material supplies, maintenance and
repair, " Chen said, adding that the project will help realize the
goal of creating a "win-win" scenario for both national defense and
economic development.
</P>
<P>
Chen also took advantage of the occasion to rebut a media report
that the military has spent NT$60 million manufacturing a single
"Yunpao" armored vehicle for emergency use by the president and his
family.
</P>
<P>
"The report was a ill-motivated smear, " Chen said, adding that
neither he nor his family would ever use the new armored vehicle,
which he said will only be used for defending Taiwan and all of its
people.
</P>
<P>
Military sources said the new armored vehicle can travel at a
maximum speed of over 100 kilometers per hour and will be armed with
a 25mm gun and a 7.62mm machine gun. Its fire power will surpass any
armored personnel carriers now in service in the ROC armed forces.

According to sources, each CM-32 armored vehicle will be able to
carry a crew of three and six other fully armed soldiers. Moreover,
sources said the carrier can be converted into a platform for various
kinds of weapons. The military research team began to develop the new
armored vehicle in 2002. The vehicle has completed initial testing
and mass production is scheduled to start in 2007.
</P>
<P>
Military sources said the locally produced vehicle is only about
one-quarter of the cost of a U.S.-built armored vehicle.
</P>
<P>
Tuesday's ceremony included demonstrations of the vehicle
climbing a steep hill and driving over low walls. President Chen also
embarked on the vehicle to get a ride.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of National Defense said Sunday that the new armored
vehicle was developed to cope with Taiwan's special terrain and
upgrade the military's overall combat capabilities.

PFP OFFICIAL DENIES REPORT OF DPP-PFP COOPERATION
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Jan.  11 (CNA)
(By Y.F. Low)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A senior opposition People First Party
(PFP) legislator Tuesday denied a report claiming that the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) is close to finalizing a deal to
cooperate with the PFP.
</P>
<P>
Dismissing the report as mere rumor, PFP legislative caucus
convener Liu Wen-hsiung said neither PFP Chairman James Soong nor any
PFP politicians have had any contact with the DPP.
</P>
<P>
A local daily ran a story Tuesday saying that a cooperation deal
between the DPP and PFP is nearly complete and that Soong is likely
to meet with President Chen Shui-bian soon.
</P>
<P>
The report said that the two parties are inclined to cooperate in
the race for Legislative Yuan speaker and vice speaker and that some
PFP politicians may also enter the Cabinet.
</P>
<P>
Liu said the PFP's fundamental policies of "defending the
Republic of China and opposing Taiwan independence" remain unchanged,
affirming that the party will never trade its party stance for power
or positions in the government.
</P>
<P>
Liu said a lot of political rumors are being circulated by
different people with different motives.
</P>
<P>
While some stories say acting DPP Chairman Ker Chien-ming has
recently met Soong in the United States, others say the DPP is
offering the PFP a number of different positions including Straits
Exchange Foundation chairman, premier, vice premier as well as
Legislative Yuan speaker and vice speaker, Liu pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Huang Teh-fu, head of the opposition Kuomintang (KMT) legislative
caucus, accused the DPP of using the media to spread rumors to try to
divide the alliance between the KMT and PFP.
</P>
<P>
Ker admitted that it is premature to jump to the conclusion that
a DPP-PFP cooperation deal is near before President Chen and Soong
meet each other.
</P>
<P>
Ker said he hopes Soong will hold talks with Chen on issues
concerning Taiwan's political stability, economic development and
cross-Taiwan Strait peace after he returns from the United States.
</P>
<P>
Ker said there is a need for the DPP to sit down for talks with
opposition leaders to seek reconciliation and that the talks are not
exclusively for the PFP but also include the KMT.
</P>
<P>
Also on Tuesday, a group of protesters drove 10 campaign trucks
around the Legislative Yuan in opposition to the PFP's alleged plan
to cooperate with the DPP.
</P>
<P>
The protesters urged people to participate in a demonstration set
for Jan. 15 at PFP headquarters to "rescue the PFP from turning
green," the color representing the DPP.

BEIJING INVITES TAIPEI FOR FURTHER TALKS ON CHARTER FLIGHT SERVICES
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Beijing,  Jan. 11 (CNA)
(By Stanley Cheung and Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A mainland Chinese aviation official has
sent a letter to the head of the Taipei Airlines Association (TAA) ,
inviting him to further discuss the details of charter flights during
the Chinese Lunar New Year holiday for Taiwan businessmen operating
in mainland China.
</P>
<P>
Pu Zhaozhou, executive director of the China Civil Aviation
Association, asked TAA head Michael Lo to lead a delegation of Taiwan
airlines executives to visit the mainland to talk about technical and
operational details of the cross-strait charter flights. The meeting
place has yet to be set.
</P>
<P>
Pu said that with less than one month before the Chinese Lunar
New Year, which falls on Feb. 9 this year, Taiwan needs to produce a
list of names in the delegation and suggest a possible venue for the
meeting soon so that arrangements can be made.
</P>
<P>
This will be the follow-up to a secret meeting between Pu and Lo
earlier this month. Lo, at the commission of the Cabinet-level
Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) , went to Macau where he and Pu
reportedly reached an agreement on the charter flights.
</P>
<P>
Pu, who is also the director of the Office of Taiwan, Hong Kong
and Macau Affairs under the Civil Aviation Administration of China,
sent the letter through a news release of the Taiwan Affairs Office
of the State Council.
</P>
<P>
In Taipei, an MAC official reaffirmed Tuesday that it is the
long-standing policy of the MAC to promote the charter flights for
the holiday period, and that negotiations should take into account
the existing Taiwan-Hong Kong aviation agreement.
</P>
<P>
MAC Vice Chairman Liu Teh-shun made the remarks after meeting
with a delegation from the opposition Kuomintang (KMT) , which
returned from the mainland after meeting with Chen Yunlin, director
of the Taiwan Affairs Office, in Beijing Monday. Chen agreed to the
principles of "joint participation, multiple-destinations and two-way
flights without stopovers in third countries or areas" for the
charter flights.
</P>
<P>
Liu pointed out that the Taiwan Affairs Office said in October
that following the model used to get negotiations on track to create
the existing Taiwan-Hong Kong aviation agreement would be feasible,
although the KMT delegation said that the insistence of this model
would almost certainly stop the flights before they even got off the
ground because the Taiwan-Hong Kong talks involved participation by
government officials, something that Beijing will not accept in this
situation.
</P>
<P>
TAA head Lo was also commissioned by Taiwan to head Taiwan's
delegation during the talks to create the accord on Taiwan-Hong Kong
flights in 2002, but the MAC and Civil Aeronautics Administration
officials also came to the negotiating table to act as advisers for
the TAA.
</P>
<P>
Legislator John Chang, a member of KMT delegation, said after
meeting with Liu that if the MAC insists on the Taiwan-Hong Kong
model for further talks with Beijing, then the matter "could fall
through."
</P>
<P>
He noted that Taiwan Affairs Office Director Chen had said
clearly that whether being commissioned by the government or not, the
private aviation operators must consult with each other as soon as
possible. Chen said that both sides of the Taiwan Strait are talking
about "charter flights," not about aviation rights or agreements.

</P>
<P>
 Chen also said that in view of the strained relationship
between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait, it is out of the question
to have official-to-official talks, according to Chang. 
</P>
<P>
Chang expressed the hope that the government will be more
flexible and that mainland China show some leeway so as not to
complicate a simple issue.

SEF CHIEF'S DEATH MARKS BEGINNING OF NEW ERA OF CROSS-STRAIT TIES
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Washington,  Jan.  10 (CNA)
(By Wennie Chi and Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The recent death of Taiwan's top
negotiator with mainland China has brought about a new era in
cross-Taiwan Strait relations, a noted mainland Chinese dissident
said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Wei Jinsheng recalled the significance of a historic 1993 meeting
between Koo Chen-fu, chairman of Taiwan's Straits Exchange
Foundation, and his counterpart Wang Daohan, chairman of Beijing's
Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait, marking the first
high-level contact between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait after a
five-decade hiatus.
</P>
<P>
Wei said the event was historic because the meeting would not
have been possible with Koo's efforts alone, noting that the mainland
was isolated in the international community following the Tiananmen
Square massacre of 1989 and was more willing to negotiate, while Koo
had the full authorization of Republic of China then-President Lee
Teng-hui.
</P>
<P>
But with the changing times, cross-strait relations are now
facing a new era, Wei said.
</P>
<P>
The dissident-in-exile said that the United States had hoped to
solicit support from the mainland in the war against Iraq and the
North Korea issue, a situation that seemed to be not in Taiwan's
favor.
</P>
<P>
But now that the situation has changed, Wei said, he has heard
U.S. State Department officials and friends in U.S. think tanks
complaining lately that Beijing has been dragging its feet on many
international issues, including North Korea and nuclear arms
inspections in Iran.
</P>
<P>
Wei noted that after Hu Jintao took the helm of mainland China,
the United States and many European countries were hoping for a more
moderate and friendly China, but the expectations have fallen through
as a result of Hu's recent deeds and policies.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan should make good use of the situation to strengthen its 
international relations, he said.
</P>
<P>
Wei said that Taiwan should adjust its diplomatic approach and
strengthen its relations with Western countries such as the United
States to solicit wider support. On the other hand, it should improve
its publicity drive toward the mainland people to win their hearts,
adding that it is futile to extend olive branches to the Beijing
authorities.

ARMS PROCUREMENT STATUTE AGAIN FAILS TO GET ONTO LEGISLATIVE AGENDA
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Jan.  11 (CNA)
(By Y.F. Low)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A draft statute governing major arms
procurements failed again Tuesday to be included on the Legislative
Yuan's agenda.
</P>
<P>
The bill was once again blocked by the majority "pan-blue
alliance" of the opposition Kuomintang and People First Party in the
procedures committee, which schedules the agenda of the legislature.
</P>
<P>
The "pan-blue alliance" has demanded that the Executive Yuan
withdraw its budget proposal for a NT$610.8 billion (US$18.23
billion) arms procurement package from the United States as a
condition for clearing the way for the statute.
</P>
<P>
The alliance, which thinks the United States is overcharging for
procurement package, has also demanded that the Executive Yuan cut
the amount at least by half before it submits the budget bill to the
legislature again, after the special statute is passed.
</P>
<P>
Tsai Huang-liang, a leader of the ruling Democratic Progressive
Party's legislative caucus, said there is little chance of the
statute being passed before the legislative session closes Jan. 21,
since it has not even been included on the agenda.
</P>
<P>
Also excluded from the agenda are President Chen Shui-bian's
request for the legislature to exercise its consent on Control Yuan
appointments, a proposed resolution defending the Republic of China
and a proposed amendment to the Land Taxes Act.
</P>
<P>
Priority items on the legislative agenda for next week include
the 2005 central government budget bill and a draft law governing
National Assembly elections.

The Times: Monuments to the missing in

Painting smocks belonging to those who died hang unclaimed as a
symbol of the tragedy in a classroom at Ban Bang Muang School in
southern Thailand. When, in the wake of nature's wrath, communities
try to put together some semblance of a normal life, it is suddenly
and painfully obvious which pieces of the jigsaw are missing. Nothing
could tell a sharper tale of tragedy than empty hatpegs in a school
cloakroom. The hopes for the next generation have been washed away.
The Namahal Vidyalayam School in Galle, southern Sri Lanka, is only
one among many to have been hurt to its core. Of its 313 pupils, 150
are known to have died and 11 more are still missing. Across the
Indian Ocean in the Thai village of Ban Bang Muang, the school had
687 pupils aged from three to 16 on its register. Here it is the
unclaimed smocks hanging on the pegs that tell the story.

Financial Times: NHS reform hit by new delay.

Ministers are to restrict their flagship National Health Service

TAIPEI MAYOR  HOSTS LUNCH FOR COMMITTEE OF 100 MEMBERS

<TEXT>
<P>
Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou hosted a luncheon
Tuesday at the Taipei World Trade Center for several members of the
Committee of 100, a high-profile Chinese-American organization, after
he was denied a visa by the Hong Kong authorities to attend a meeting
on urban development organized by the group.
</P>
<P>
The mayor had been scheduled to present a speech at the Committee
of 100's first Greater China Conference that will run from Jan. 12-14
in Hong Kong until his visa application was rejected. Because of
this, he met in Taipei with 19 members of the Committee, including
San Francisco-based Unison International Chairman C.B. Sung.
</P>
<P>
During the lunch, Ma expressed regret at not being able to meet
them in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Although his planned itinerary in Hong Kong did not include any
official activities, the authorities refused to open the door for
him, he said. He claimed, however, that the incident has drawn
"worldwide media attention."
</P>
<P>
He said there are about 89 press reports, including stories in
the Asia Wall Street Journal and the South China Morning Post, on the
incident, while the Hong Kong authorities have also been criticized
by the U.S. consulate in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
The non-political Committee of 100 was founded in 1990 by a group
of Americans of Chinese descent to bring an Asian-American
perspective to U.S-China relations and to address the concerns of
Chinese-Americans.
</P>
<P>
Each of its members, including renowned cellist Yo Yo Ma and
architect I.M. Pei, enjoy positions of leadership in the United
States in a broad range of professions.
</P>
<P>
A Taipei city official in charge of arranging Ma's overseas
visits said that the mayor was scheduled to leave for Hong Kong
Tuesday and to fly from there to Brisbane on Thursday before heading
to Bangkok Jan. 18.
</P>
<P>
The official said the mayor will still visit Australia and

TAIWAN GROUPS JOIN GPPAC TO PROMOTE NORTHEAST ASIAN PEACE

<TEXT>
<P>
Some 10 non-government groups from Taiwan
have joined the Global Partnership for the Prevention of Armed
Conflict (GPPAC) to help promote peace in Northeast Asia, a spokesman
for the Peacetime Foundation of Taiwan said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Chien Hsi-chieh, executive director of the Peacetime Foundation,
said his foundation and several other private groups, including the
Taiwan Security Research Center (TSRC), will join GPPAC operations to
help prevent armed conflict and maintain peace in Northeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
The groups will organize a joint delegation to attend a GPPAC
conference to be held in Japan next month to craft action guidelines
for safeguarding Northeast Asian regional security and peace, Chien
said.
</P>
<P>
Yang Yung-ming, a National Taiwan University professor who
concurrently serves as TSRC director, said GPPAC is a worldwide peace
movement aimed at averting armed confrontation. The GPPAC has 15
chapters in different parts of the world and each chapter groups
countries in its specific region to seek peaceful solutions to
disputes without resorting to military force.
</P>
<P>
Noting that GPPAC provides a forum for civic groups in the region
to conduct in-depth discussions on measures to resolve regional
disputes by peaceful means and to avert armed conflict, Yang said
GPPAC can serve as a conduit for people from both sides of the Taiwan
Strait to exchange views and forge friendship.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Chien said the upcoming GPPAC conference will bring
together delegates from Taiwan, mainland China, North and South
Korea, Hong Kong, Mongolia, Russia and Japan to discuss feasible
measures to prevent armed conflict in the region.
</P>
<P>
Akira Kawasaki, a leading member of the GPPAC Northeast Asian
Steering Group, was also present at a ceremony to mark the Taiwan
groups' participation in the GPPAC.
</P>
<P>
Kawasaki said the cross-strait and North Korea issues are the
most important security concerns in Northeast Asia. The upcoming
GPPAC meeting will enable civic delegates from North and South Korea,
Japan, the mainland and Taiwan to discuss disarmament and prevention
of armed conflict, he added.

More than 74 percent of the respondents to

ELDERLY WOMEN HEALTH ISSUES IMPORTANT AS POPULATION GRAYS: SCHOLAR
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Jan. 11 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As Taiwan's population is graying quickly,
the number of elderly women will jump rapidly due to their longer
life expectancy, a situation that the government should address,
according to a scholar.
</P>
<P>
Wu Shu-chiung, a professor at National Taiwan University, made
the suggestion while giving a keynote speech on the gender gap in the
country's demographic policy at a recent seminar.
</P>
<P>
Calling on the government to draw up an adequate policy capable
of dealing with the long-term health care needs of elderly women, she
said the country's population policy has apparently ignored the issue
and she called for a shift in attitudes toward dealing with a graying
society dominated by women. 
</P>
<P>
Citing the latest statistics compiled by the Cabinet-level
Council for Economic Planning and Development (CEPD) , Wu said that
elderly people will account for one quarter of the country's total
population by around 2031, as the elderly population is expected to
grow from 2.46 million in 2011 to 5.66 million by that time.
</P>
<P>
Currently, the number of Taiwan nationals aged over 65 years
totals around 2.14 million.
</P>
<P>
According to Wu, women will outnumber men among the elderly.
"There will be more women in the more advanced age groups," she
pointed out. 
</P>
<P>
In 2000, the number of Taiwan's male population aged over 80
years was only 90 percent that of the female population, she
reported, adding that the ratio is estimated to fall to 73 percent in
2020 and 68 percent in 2030.
</P>
<P>
The gap will further widen along with age increases, underscoring
the seriousness surrounding health care and medical treatment of
elderly women, she said.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that some 65 percent of Taiwan's disabled men
aged over 65 years have spouses, ahead of 32 percent of elderly and
disabled women.
</P>
<P>
Generally speaking, about 80 percent of Taiwan's elderly men are
taken care of by their wives or sent to nursing institutions, well
above the percentage of their female counterparts who are as
fortunate.
</P>
<P>
According to the Cabinet-level Directorate General of Budget,
Accounting and Statistics (DGBAS) , Taiwan is the only one of the
major countries around the world that has a larger percentage of men
aged over 60 years than women.
</P>
<P>
DGBAS officials ascribe the phenomenon to the large number of
male immigrants to Taiwan in 1949, when the now opposition Kuomintang
retreated to Taiwan after losing a civil war to the Chinese
communists in mainland China.
</P>
<P>
Citing CEPD tallies as evidence, they said that in 2000, the
number of Taiwan's male population aged over 65 was 1.11-fold that of
females.
</P>
<P>
In most Asian countries except Japan, parents traditionally
prefer sons to daughters, they said, adding that in Taiwan and South
Korea, there are an average 110 male newborns for every 100 females,
while the figures are 109 and 108 in mainland China and Singapore,
respectively.
</P>
<P>
However, due to the longer life expectancy of women, the numbers
of elderly female citizens in Japan, Singapore, South Korea, the
United States and European countries are usually higher than those of
elderly men, they said.
</P>
<P>
For instance, there are fewer than one man among every three
elderly citizens aged over 80 in France, Germany, Japan and South
Korea, they noted.

TAIWAN, JAPAN TO STEP UP COOPERATION IN AVIAN FLU PREVENTION
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Jan. 11 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A seminar between Taiwan and Japan on the
prevention and control of avian influenza closed Tuesday with
participants from both countries pledging to step up cooperation in
research into major contagious diseases in animals.
</P>
<P>
Around 180 experts and scholars from Taiwan and Japan took part
in the two-day seminar sponsored by the Animal Health Research
institute of the Council of Agriculture.
</P>
<P>
The participants also agreed that they will step up development
of early diagnosis of disease in land and marine livestock, research
into related contagious diseases, as well as the research and
development of vaccines for animal disease.
</P>
<P>
Participants from Taiwan reported their method of diagnosing
avian flu and Taiwan's experience in dealing with the H5N2 virus, a
milder form of avian flu that affected Taiwan chicken and duck farms,
requiring the slaughter of the affected poultry.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese experts reported on a project to combat avian flu
and the outbreak of a more lethal H5N1 virus and the decimation of
the affected fowl.
</P>
<P>
The participants will convene a similar seminar in Japan next
year to discuss avian flu and other human-animal transmitted
diseases, as well as to exchange information on migratory birds
carrying avian flu.

BUSH ADMINISTRATION URGED TO REASSESS ONE CHINA POLICY
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Washington,  Jan. 11 (CNA)
(By Oliver Lin &amp; Huang Kwang-chun)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Bush administration should conduct
a thorough review of its "one China" policy to resolve the stark
contradictions between Taiwan's democratization and mainland China's
continued repression, a U.S. think tank suggests in a recently
published book.
</P>
<P>
The Heritage Foundation claims in the book titled "Mandate for
Leadership" that any attempt by the United States to facilitate a
resolution of the mainland-Taiwan dispute must face the reality that
Taiwan is a vibrant, prosperous and friendly Asian democracy while
the mainland remains the world's largest tyranny.
</P>
<P>
President Chen Shui-bian's re-election in March 2004 demonstrated
that formal separation from the mainland has become a mainstream
sentiment in Taiwan's political debate, it claims.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, an increasing stridency in the mainland's military
threats since the election has injected an urgency into efforts to
deepen U.S.-Taiwan defense coordination, it adds.
</P>
<P>
The Bush administration has shown a new willingness to be blunt
with the Chinese communists on the Taiwan issue, according to the
foundation, which cites remarks by White House spokesman Scott
McClellan in response to a statement issued by Beijing May 17 to warn
against the emergency of a new Taiwanese national identity.
</P>
<P>
Threats to "crush" Taiwan or drown it in a "sea of fire" have no
place in civilized international discourse, McClellan said.
</P>
<P>
The Bush administration still has no idea of how to define the
"status quo" in the Taiwan Strait and only a vague idea of its
strategic objectives in the Western Pacific or how the mainland and
Taiwan fit into them, it claims.
</P>
<P>
If the existing confusion in China policy is to be cleared up,
these issues must be clarified within the bureaucracy, it says.

ITRI SIGNS COOPERATIVE PACT WITH TELCORDIA
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei, Jan. 1 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Industrial Technology Research Institute
(ITRI) and Telcordia Technologies Inc. signed a cooperative venture
Tuesday, with Telcordia agreeing to help the ITRI set up a testing
and certification center for telecom equipment and devices -- the
first of its kind anywhere in Asia.
</P>
<P>
Liu Jung-sheng, director of the ITRI's Opto-Electronics Systems
Laboratories, said that the accord helps create a mutually beneficial
situation for both sides and for the domestic telecom industry as a
whole, a boost that will enable Taiwan to play a more prominent role
in the global market.
</P>
<P>
The center will help Telcordia expand its business into Asia,
shortening the time-to-market cycle and improving customer
satisfaction, according to Liu. At the same time, Taiwan-based
telecom companies will be provided with quick technology support at
world-class levels and at reasonable cost, he added.
</P>
<P>
Under the terms of the accord, Telcordia will help train local
personnel and carry out technology transfers, he said, explaining
that the ITRI will be able to offer top-class professional consulting
and testing services for clients.
</P>
<P>
Lin Bao-shuh, director of the ITRI's Computer and Communications
Research Laboratories, which is also taking part in the cooperative
project, hailed the venture as proof of Taiwan's outstanding status
in the international telecom industry at a time when Asia has
increasingly become the world's production base and research and
development hub of telecom facilities.
</P>
<P>
Hsu Ming, head of the task force under the Industrial Development
Bureau in charge of promoting the ITRI-Telcordia deal, said that the
government is keen on helping Taiwan companies and research units
forge cooperative ventures with world-class businesses and concerns
in an effort to sharpen Taiwan's competitive edge.
</P>
<P>
The non-profit ITRI was set up in 1973 to help foster Taiwan's
high technology, while the U.S.-based Telcordia is devoted to helping
communications companies around the world expand their networks and
services.

CHINA'S ANTI-SECESSION LAW AIMED AT TAIWAN LEADERS: OFFICIAL
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Jan.  11 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The anti-secession law to be enacted by
Beijing will provide for trials of Taiwan officials and military
leaders before a special court after mainland China takes Taiwan in a
war, Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) Chairman Jaushieh Joseph Wu
warned Monday.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with local media, Wu said the anti-secession law,
which is to be deliberated by Beijing's National People's Congress in
March, would provide Beijing with the legal means to put Taiwan's
civic and military leaders on trial should they lead their country
into war with the mainland.
</P>
<P>
Citing information from unnamed sources, Wu said the law also
stipulates that Beijing leaders who unwittingly prompt Taiwan into
declaring independence through their inaction should be charged with
dereliction of duty.
</P>
<P>
Under the law, Wu said, Taiwan would be considered a part of
mainland territory and any action contributing to Taiwan independence
would be a punishable crime, which means Taiwan businessmen operating
on the mainland would run the risk of being jailed, rather than just
having their books audited by the Beijing authorities, for their
support for the Republic of China.
</P>
<P>
As the members of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party and the
opposition Taiwan Solidarity Union have been branded by the mainland
as supporters of Taiwan independence, they face the possibility of
being prosecuted and taken to the mainland should they visit
countries that do not recognize Taiwan, while international groups
who support Taiwan might be deemed as interfering in China's internal
affairs, Wu went on.
</P>
<P>
By enacting the law, Wu said, the mainland is intent on defining
its ties with Taiwan on its own terms and pre-empting other countries
support for Taiwan under the pretext that it is meddling in China's
domestic affairs. This could alter Washington's view of the dispute
across the Taiwan Strait to Taiwan's detriment and could rob the
United States of its right to interpret the dispute in its own way.
</P>
<P>
Wu will be a member of the entourage of Lee Yuan-tseh, president
of the Academia Sinica, when he visits Washington as President Chen
Shui-bian's envoy to attend the second inauguration of U.S. President
George W. Bush later this month.
</P>
<P>
He said he will make a case for Taiwan's opposition to the
mainland's attempts to enact the law during his visit to Washington
by stressing the law's disturbing effects on the stability across the
Taiwan Strait.
</P>
<P>
In order to force the mainland to give up its attempt, Wu said,
Taiwan will do all it can to bring international pressure to bear on
the situation.

<TEXT>
<P>
President Chen Shui-bian decorated his
Malawian counterpart Bingu Wa Mutharika Tuesday in recognition of
Mutharika's contribution to the promotion of Republic of China-Malawi
relations.
</P>
<P>
The conferring ceremony was held at a state banquet Chen hosted
in Mutharika's honor in Taichung, central Taiwan, in which Chen
bestowed the Order of Brilliant Jade with Grand Cordon on the
Malawian president.
</P>
<P>
Chen thanked Mutharika for the support and assistance his country
has extended to Taiwan in its bids to join the United Nations, the
Worth Health Organization and other international organizations.
</P>
<P>
Chen told his guest that Malawi is a "real friend" to Taiwan and
that "the people of Taiwan will remember forever" the friendship
between the two nations.
</P>
<P>
Chen also affirmed that Taiwan will not reduce its contribution
to the international community as a result of political interference.
</P>
<P>
The government has adopted a pragmatic idea of diplomacy through
increasing humanitarian aid and promoting the value of democracy and
the efficiency of governance, Chen explained, adding that Taiwan will
not fall short in any international assistance programs, even in
those countries that do not maintain diplomatic ties with the ROC.
</P>
<P>
From international anti-terrorism activities to the
reconstruction of Afghanistan and the relief operations for recent
tsunami victims in Southeast Asia and South Asia, Chen went on,
Taiwan has never been absent nor has reduced its offers to the
international community due to political interference.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan will eventually be recognized by the international
community because of its insistence on doing the right thing, Chen
said.
</P>
<P>
Sharing Chen's views, Mutharika said that Taiwan has every right
to join the U.N. and other international organizations. Malawi will
continue to speak for Taiwan in the international arena regardless
any adverse oppression, he pledged.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan should be allowed to enter the U.N. as soon as possible
because there is no reason to shut it out, Mutharika said.
</P>
<P>
At Chen's invitation, Mutharika arrived in Taiwan Monday for a
five-day visit.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday he toured the Tantze Export Processing Zone in
Taichung in Chen's company.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope after the visit that Taiwan's experience in
economic development will be introduced to his country and that
Taiwan businesses will invest there.

SEVEN HOSPITALS DENY ADMISSION TO BEATEN CHILD: INVESTIGATION BEGINS
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Jan.  12 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A badly beaten four-year-old girl was
refused treatment in Taipei Tuesday after seven hospital emergency
rooms reportedly would not accept her because there were no empty
beds.

</P>
<P>
The girl was finally driven by ambulance nearly 200 kilometers to
Taichung for treatment early Tuesday morning, where she remains on
the edge of death.
</P>
<P>
The girl, allegedly beaten and smashed into a wall by her drunk
father, was taken first to Jen Ai Hospital at 1: 55 a.m. Tuesday but
was not admitted because no bed was available in the neurosurgery
department.
</P>
<P>
At that point, the Taipei Emergency Operations Center tried in
vain until 4: 18 a.m. to find an emergency room in Taipei that would
take the child for treatment, finally giving up after being rejected
at six locations.
</P>
<P>
It was then decided that the girl should be driven to Tungs'
Taichung MetroHarbor Hospital in Wuchi, Taichung County in central
Taiwan. By the time the child reached Tungs' Hospital's operating
room, it was past dawn Tuesday morning.
</P>
<P>
Surgeons at Tungs' Hospital immediately preformed surgery to
remove a blood clot from the girl's brain and a second operation to
try to relieve swelling was done later at around midnight of the same
day. Doctors say they are not very optimistic about the child's
chances for survival.
</P>
<P>
The Taipei District Prosecutors' Office is questioning the Taipei
emergency center and the hospitals involved as to why they failed to
find a bed for the girl in Taipei. The prosecutors said that some
people must bear the responsibility for the negligence.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a doctor with Jen Ai Hospital's Neurosurgery
Department and a head nurse working the Monday night shift were
disciplined Wednesday for negligence, the first two people punished
in the incident.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Health Chen Chien-jen said Wednesday that it was
"extremely pitiful" that the young girl had been treated like a "hot
potato" during the emergency.
</P>
<P>
Chen said that the medical sector's coordination system failed
badly and is to blame for the situation.

CHINA MUM ON SHUTTING TAIWAN OFFICIALS OUT OF CHARTER FLIGHT TALKS
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Beijing,  Jan.  12 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An official of mainland China's Taiwan
Affairs Office on Wednesday stopped short of saying whether Taiwan's
civil aviation officials can take part in talks over cross-strait
charter flights during the Chinese Lunar New Year holiday.
</P>
<P>
He Shizhong, director of the Economics Bureau of the Taiwan
Affairs Office, made the remarks when he was asked if Billy K.C.
Chang, director-general of Civil Aeronautics Administration of
Taiwan, who is also an adviser to the Taipei Airlines Association
(TAA), will be allowed to participate in a follow-up meeting between
Beijing and Taipei on the matter.
</P>
<P>
He stopped short of saying whether Chang would be allowed to
attend the meeting, but he stressed that to avoid unnecessary
political interference, officials from mainland China's Taiwan
Affairs Office and its quasi-official Association for Relations
Across the Taiwan Strait cannot take part in the discussions between
air carriers from both sides.
</P>
<P>
It would be "inappropriate, impractical and insincere" if someone
should suggest that Taiwan's Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) and the
Straits Exchange Foundation take part in the talks, He added.
</P>
<P>
Pu Zhaozhou, executive director of the China Civil Aviation
Association, sent a letter to Taipei Airlines Association head
Michael Lo Tuesday to arrange for further talks on the technical and
operational details of the charter flights during the Chinese Lunar
New Year holiday. The two held a secret meeting in Macau earlier this
month and reportedly reached agreement on the issue.
</P>
<P>
Although Beijing and Taipei agreed to the principles of "joint
participation in two-way, multiple-destination, non-stop" charter
flights during the Chinese Lunar New Year holiday, the MAC has said
that further talks on the matter have to be based on the model of
aviation agreement negotiations between Taiwan and Hong Kong in 2002
in which TAA head Lo headed Taiwan's delegation, but officials from
the MAC and the CAA also came to the negotiating table in the
capacity of TAA advisers to work behind the scenes.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, an official from the opposition Kuomintang (KMT) said
Wednesday that the KMT has completed the finishing touches on
establishing the foundation for the service, and if the charter
flights don't get off the ground, the ruling Democratic Progressive
Party should bear full responsibility for the failure.
</P>
<P>
Legislator Tseng Yung-chuan, a member of the KMT delegation who
called on Chen Yunlin, head of the Taiwan Affairs Office in Beijing
Monday, said in the beginning, while the matter was in the hands of
the DPP-led government, no headway was made and the MAC had all but
given up on the prospects for the flights; however, the KMT promoted
the flight service for the sake of Taiwan businessmen operating on
the mainland. Tseng pointed to the fact that Chen had announced
preparations for the cross-strait flights only after the meeting with
the KMT delegation.
</P>
<P>
Legislator John Chang, another member of the KMT delegation, also
urged the government to be "swift and simple" to help the charter
flight services get underway.

FIRST QUARTER IS CRUCIAL POINT FOR CROSS-STRAIT RELATIONS: ANALYST
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei, Jan. 12 (CNA)
(By Y.F. Low)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The first quarter of this year is a crucial
point that will decide whether cross-Taiwan Strait relations will
temper, a local analyst on mainland China studies said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
According to Tamkang University Professor Andy Chang, incidents
that will guide the development of cross-strait relations include the
special cross-strait Chinese Lunar New Year charter flights, which
both sides are trying to arrange; Beijing authorities' statement to
be released in late January to mark the 10th anniversary of an
"eight-point overture" offered by former mainland President Jiang
Zemin; and an "anti-secession law" which the mainland's National
People's Congress is expected to pass in March.
</P>
<P>
Chang said the negotiations and dialogue between Taiwan and the
mainland will become more pragmatic and flexible if the charter
flight services are successfully launched this year.
</P>
<P>
However, there will be little prospect of both sides opening
talks on the launch of direct shipping and air links if the charter
flight negotiations fail, Chang said.
</P>
<P>
He proposed that Taiwan and the mainland seek to normalize the
charter flights and make the services available during other holidays
such as the Dragon Boat Festival and Mid-autumn Festival.
</P>
<P>
Chang made the remarks at a news conference held by the Peacetime
Foundation of Taiwan for the release of a report on cross-strait
peace.
</P>
<P>
Chien Hsi-chieh, executive director of the foundation, said the
"anti-secession law" will not help solve any problems in cross-strait
relations but will only cause antipathy among the Taiwanese people
towards the mainland.
</P>
<P>
By trying to solve a political problem through legal means,
Beijing will undermine the flexibility in dealing with relations with
Taiwan, Chien added.

DPP WILL RETAIN IDEALS FOR INTER-PARTY  COOPERATION: DPP LEGISLATOR
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Jan. 12 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Inter-party cooperation is the aspiration
of the public and the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) has
not turned its back on its ideals, a DPP legislator said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Tsai Huang-liang, DPP party whip in the legislature, was
responding to criticism by the Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU), an ally
of the DPP, earlier in the day.
</P>
<P>
Chen Chien-ming, deputy convener of the TSU in the Legislative
Yuan, said that the DPP, in a bid to woo the People First Party (PFP)
into its fold, has placated the PFP and suspended its call to change
the name of overseas missions and a revised referendum law. The TSU
cannon accept "such a betrayal of ideals," Chen said.
</P>
<P>
Tsai said that the public approves of inter-party cooperation and
that the DPP, as the ruling party, must show more goodwill and avoid
touching the controversial issues.
</P>
<P>
He said the name-change drive for overseas missions of the nation
cannot be successfully carried out without inter-party cooperation
and national consensus. Creating an environment conducive for
cooperation between the ruling and opposition parties will also pave
the way for realizing ideals, Tsai said, dismissing the TSU's
complaints as a "big misunderstanding."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, DPP acting chairman Ker Chien-ming said the DPP and
PFP have yet to make the first step toward cooperation despite
reports, adding that the wild speculation is not correct.
</P>
<P>
Ker said that the best time for starting cooperation would be
between Jan. 21, when this Legislative Yuan's session will end, and
Jan. 27, when President Chen Shui-bian will leave for a visit of two
allies in the South Pacific, and the timing will be more crucial
closer to February.
</P>
<P>
"Everything will hinge on talks between President Chen and PFP
Chairman James Soong, " Ker said. Soong, who is currently in the
United States, "holds the key to history" regarding whether the
DPP-PFP can cooperate.
</P>
<P>
PFP Legislator Chou Hsi-wei said that this cooperation has until
now been only seen in reports, adding that unless President Chen
gives a clear idea to the script and roles of such cooperation, the
public "need not dance to the tune of reports."
</P>
<P>
Chou's words came after a group of PFP supporters rallied at the
Legislative Yuan the previous day, urging Soong not to tilt toward
the DPP.
</P>
<P>
Huang Teh-fu, caucus whip of the Kuomintang (KMT) in the
legislature, also said that the DPP is sounding out the public
response by spreading reports about possible post-sharing with the
PFP, which he said is an attempt to drive a wedge between the
"pan-blue alliance" of the KMT and the PFP, and the KMT will no
longer respond to such reports.
</P>
<P>
Saying that the KMT and the PFP have a solid base for
cooperation, he said communications between the two parries are
close, including those between KMT Chairman Lien Chan and PFP
Chairman Soong.

PRESIDENT CHEN VOWS TO UPHOLD 'THREE INSISTENCES'
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Jan.  12 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President Chen Shui-bian said Wednesday
that he and the ruling Democratic Progressive Party have made some
changes in policies after the legislative elections in accordance
with the opposition's advice, but he said that the "three
insistences" that he has been talking about will remain firmly
unchanged.
</P>
<P>
Chen told a group of Taiwanese civil engineers from North America
at an audience at the Presidential Office that his insistence on the
progress of Taiwan's democratic reforms, on making "Taiwan first" --
mainstream concept in the nation's diplomatic efforts -- and on
shaping Taiwan into a wholesome, progressive and great country will
never change under any circumstance.
</P>
<P>
Noting that Taiwan's per capita income was US$13,995 in 2004,
Chen said that the figure hopefully will top US$15,000 this year
should economic growth reach 4.65 percent as expected.
</P>
<P>
If the country tries even harder, per capita income may exceed
US$15,000 for 2005 to mark a record all-time high, Chen added.
</P>
<P>
He told his guests that to sharpen Taiwan's international
competitiveness, the government has designated the semiconductor
manufacturing industry, image and display industry, as well as the
telecommunications industry and services as the backbone of the
country's industrial development, envisaging that all three sectors
will churn out production worth over NT$1 trillion (US$30.86 billion)
in the years ahead.
</P>
<P>
Under a national development plan, the semiconductor
manufacturing industry posted production worth NT$1.58 trillion in
2004, constituting a whopping annual growth of 28.9 percent over the
year-earlier level, Chen said.
</P>
<P>
He added that the image and display industry as well as the
telecommunications industry and services are expected to reach the
NT$1 trillion goal by the end of 2006 and 2008, respectively.
</P>
<P>
Chen reiterated that Taiwan's rising competitiveness in the
international community and better performance on international
scoreboards in recent years are the direct results of the
government's strenuous efforts to push for reforms and bolster
economic development.

PFP DEMANDS FOR CABINET POSTS SHEER SPECULATION: MAYOR HSIEH
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Jan. 12 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Kaohsiung Mayor Frank Hsieh said Wednesday
that reports about the opposition People First Party (PFP) asking the
ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) for a share of Cabinet
posts are all speculation and may wreck possible cooperation between
the two parties.
</P>
<P>
Hsieh made the remarks in Taipei where he was recording an album
of his ocarina playing.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the DPP is communicating with the PFP on inter-party
cooperation, Hseih said that the PFP has never proposed any
post-sharing in the Cabinet, and there is no horse-trading going on
between the two; all reports to that effect are wild speculation and
could even possibly wreck future cooperation, Hsieh said.
</P>
<P>
He said that the pro-independence DPP and the pro-unification PFP
have in the past attacked each other vehemently, and have no
experience of cooperation.
</P>
<P>
He believed that supporters of the PFP can't accept such a
partnership right now, and the DPP is now under tremendous pressure
to explain the current state of affairs to their supporters.
</P>
<P>
"Everything will have to depend on whether the PFP is willing to
play a key role in creating a new political landscape in Taiwan, " he
said, referring to his perception that the public has grown tired of
the continual bickering between the "pan-green camp" of the DPP and
its ally, the Taiwan Solidarity Union, and the "pan-blue alliance" of
the Kuomintang and the PFP.

U.S. EXPRESSES SERIOUS CONCERN ABOUT ANTI-SECESSION LAW TO BEIJING
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Washington,  Dec.  11 (CNA)
(By Oliver Lin and Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Senior U.S. officials have expressed
grave concern to mainland China over its proposed anti-secession
legislation, two visiting Taiwan lawmakers said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Legislators Sun Guo-hua of the opposition Kuomintang (KMT) and
Hsieh Ming-yuan of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (PFP) made
the remarks after meeting with U.S. State Department officials.
</P>
<P>
Sun and Hsieh quoted State Department officials as having told
them that Deputy Secretary of State Richard Armitage and Deputy
National Security Adviser Stephen Hadley had conveyed U.S. concern
about Beijing's so-called anti-secession law while meeting with Chen
Yunlin, director of mainland China's Taiwan Affairs Office, who
visited Washington, D.C. last week.
</P>
<P>
According to State Department officials, both Armitage and Hadley
told Chen that the proposed anti-secession law would only escalate
cross-Taiwan Strait tension and be counterproductive to cross-strait
relations. They also told Chen that Taiwan would not accept such
legislation.
</P>
<P>
Chen did not bring with him the content of Beijing's proposed
anti-secession law, the State Department officials were quoted as
having said.
</P>
<P>
"State Department officials think Beijing's reluctance to divulge
the text of its draft anti-secession law probably shows that the
content has not been finalized and that the mainland authorities
might revise certain clauses in terms of reactions from various
quarters," Sun said.
</P>
<P>
Sun said the U.S. government is not expected to explicitly
express its official stance on the anti-secession law until after the
National People's Congress, mainland China's rubber-stamp parliament,
formally passes the legislation.
</P>
<P>
"The U.S. officials also said they think the period of 2005 and
2006 is critical to cross-strait relations. They said they believe
the period is a 'window of opportunity' for cross-strait ties.
Neither side of the Taiwan Strait should miss this opportunity. They
said the two sides should conduct 'quiet diplomacy' and hold direct,
candid talks to resolve bilateral disputes," Sun said, adding that the
United States is willing to assist in pushing for cross-strait
dialogue, but the responsibility for realizing it rests with Taiwan
and the mainland.
</P>
<P>
As for Taiwan's constitutional re-engineering plan, the State
Department officials said they attach great importance to President
Chen Shui-bian's "four noes" pledge.
</P>
<P>
"If Chen's administration upholds the 'four noes' promise, they
said the U.S. government will tell Beijing that Taiwan's
constitutional reform program will not have an adverse impact on
cross-strait ties. As for Taiwan's plan to change its five-branch
central government framework to a three-branch one, the U.S.
officials said they have no opinion," Sun said.
</P>
<P>
According to Sun, the U.S. government is closely watching the
developments in ongoing cross-strait talks about the launch of
special direct cross-strait charter flights during the upcoming Lunar
New Year holiday.
</P>
<P>
"The U.S. officials have also asked us about Taiwan's possible
Cabinet reshuffle in the wake of the Dec. 11 legislative elections
and expressed their hope that the legislature can approve the stalled
budget bill for the NT$610.8 billion arms procurement package, " Sun
said.

The Times: Children face danger of mobile
phones tumours.

Children under the age of eight should not use mobile phones,
parents were advised last night after an authoritative report linked
heavy use to ear and brain tumours and concluded that the risks had
been underestimated by most scientists. Professor Sir William
Stewart, chairman of the National Radiological Protection Board
(NRPB), said that evidence of potentially harmful effects had become
more persuasive over the past five years.

Financial Times: US, EU to talk on air subsidies.

The US and the European Union on Tuesday agreed to return to the
negotiating table to curtail aid to Boeing and Airbus, calling a
truce over the biggest dispute in the history of the World Trade
Organisation. The two sides launched their trade dispute in October
in an effort to end what each said were illegal subsidies to the
world's two largest aircraft makers.

FOREIGN WORKERS CALL FOR LENIENT, PRAGMATIC LABOR POLICY
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei, Jan. 12 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A group of around 40 foreign workers lodged
a protest in front of the Council of Labor Affairs (CLA) Wednesday
demanding lenient and pragmatic labor policies to prevent them from
being deported before a management-labor dispute is settled.
</P>
<P>
The foreign workers, all of whom worked at a factory in Taipei
County and have been laid off because the management suspended the
factory's operations recently, said the CLA should revise the
existing employment service law so as to bar employers and labor
brokers from having the workers deported prior to the solution of
management-labor disputes.
</P>
<P>
According to officials from the Taiwan International Workers
Association, which accompanied the foreign workers at the protest,
125 foreign workers were put out of work with three months of salary
unpaid by Fametech Electronic Co. after the company shut down its
operations late last year.
</P>
<P>
The Fametech management agreed Jan. 3 to issue documents proving
the closure of the company and to settle the outstanding salaries
with the foreign workers.
</P>
<P>
However, the company has reneged on its promise, leaving the 125
foreign workers in limbo, with no documents to prove the company's
closure and their legal departure date, nor their due salaries.
</P>
<P>
Without such papers, the workers said, they cannot seek other
employment in Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
According to the existing employment services law, the foreign
workers will be deported if they leave their first employment but
fail to obtain a second job in 14 days.
</P>
<P>
Wu Ching-ju, director-general of the Taiwan International Workers
Association, said that the 125 workers represent only one of many
similar cases around Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
In the past, Wu said, many foreign workers who have been victims
of physical abuse by their Taiwan employers, of workplace accidents,
or have not been paid, have been deported before their disputes were
settled.
</P>
<P>
Wu suggested that Taiwan companies or labor brokers who have
illegally had foreign workers deported before disputes were solved be
dealt with under the law, including having their licenses revoked.

NEGOTIATION PROBLEM WILL NOT BLOCK CHARTER FLIGHTS: CABINET OFFICIAL
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Differences between Taiwan and mainland
China on the participants of Lunar New Year charter flight
negotiations can be resolved through consultations, Executive Yuan
spokesman Chen Chi-mai said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Chen said the problem is not going to impede the launch of the
services since both sides have reached a high degree of consensus on
the major principle of facilitating jointly operated two-way,
non-stop flights across the Taiwan Strait during the holiday period.
</P>
<P>
Chen said he believes the flights will be successfully operated
if both sides conduct the negotiations pragmatically.
</P>
<P>
In what has been hailed by Taiwan as a breakthrough in the
charter flight arrangements, Taipei Airlines Association head Michael
Lo, with the authorization of the Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) ,
held talks with China Civil Aviation Association (CCAA) Executive
Director Pu Zhaozhou in Macau last week and came to an agreement on
principle.
</P>
<P>
The MAC has proposed that follow-up talks be carried out
according to the model of the 2002 Taiwan-Hong Kong aviation talks,
in which MAC and Civil Aeronautics Administration (CAA) officials
took part in their capacities as advisers to the TAA.
</P>
<P>
However, He Shizhong, director of the Economics Bureau of the
mainland's Taiwan Affairs Office, said Wednesday that it would be
"inappropriate, impractical and insincere" to suggest that officials
from the MAC and Straits Exchange Foundation take part in the talks.
</P>
<P>
He stopped short of saying whether CAA officials can take part in
the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
He also proposed that in addition to Shanghai on the mainland and
Taipei and Kaohsiung in Taiwan, the destinations of the charter
flights be expanded to include Beijing, Guangzhou and Xiamen on the
mainland and Taichung in Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Reports said that potential CAA participants in the negotiations
include CAA Director-General Billy K.C. Chang, who is an adviser to
TAA, and Deputy Director-General Lee Chung-jung, who visited the
mainland last year for exchange activities in his capacity as an
adviser to the Air Traffic Controller's Association.
</P>
<P>
Both Chang and Lee said Wednesday they had no idea as to whether
the MAC plans to have CAA officials take part in the negotiations.

CONTROL YUAN CENSURES JUSTICE, INTERIOR MINISTRIES

<TEXT>
<P>
The Ministry of Justice and the Ministry of
the Interior were censured Wednesday by the Control Yuan, the
nation's highest watchdog body, for refusing to brief a commission
formed to look into the March 19 shooting of President Chen
Shui-bian.
</P>
<P>
Three members of the Control Yuan -- Lin Chiu-shan, Lin
Chiang-tsai, and Lai Chien-nan -- jointly proposed to censure the
Tainan Prosecutor's Office under the Ministry of Justice and the
Criminal Investigation Bureau under the Ministry of the Interior.
</P>
<P>
The trio said that the commission, which was formed based on a
"319 shooting investigation commission" statute that passed the
legislature and was promulgated by President Chen Shui-bian.
</P>
<P>
Before the Council of Grand Justices issued its ruling on a
request by the ruling Democratic Progressive Party for an
interpretation of the constitutionality of the statute last year, all
government agencies should have observed and implemented the law, and
it was inappropriate for the Criminal Investigation Bureau to refuse
to brief the commission members on its investigation of the case.
</P>
<P>
The Council of Grand Justices declared Dec. 15 that parts of
Article 8 and Article 13 of the Organic Statute for the Truth
Investigation Commission were unconstitutional and that they
therefore ceased to be effective from the day the interpretation was
handed down.
</P>
<P>
The three Control Yuan members said that prior to the ruling, the
Executive Yuan and the agencies under its jurisdiction were all bound
by the statute and that the Tainan Prosector's Office and the
Criminal Investigation Bureau should have worked in accordance with
the statute and briefed the commission.
</P>
<P>
The members also said that it was inappropriate for Interior
Affairs Minister Su Jia-chyuan to say publicly Oct. 8 and Oct. 13
in the Legislative Yuan that public functionaries should have the
right to refuse to cooperate with the commission.
</P>
<P>
The March 19 shooting took place in Tainan, southern Taiwan, when
the president was aboard an open-topped jeep during a last-minute
vote-canvassing rally. The opposition "pan-blue alliance" of the
Kuomintang and the People First Party have claimed that the incident
was a political scheme to win sympathy votes in the bitterly
contested presidential election, although they have produced no
evidence whatsoever to support their allegation.

TAIWAN CAPABLE OF TREATING 3 BROTHERS WITH RARE DISORDER: DOH
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Jan.  12 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The nation's top health official said
Wednesday that a medial team at National Taiwan University Hospital
is capable of treating three brothers suffering from a rare disorder
called adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD).
</P>
<P>
Department of Health Minister Chen Chien-jen was responding
to questions by Legislator Chiang Chi-wen of the opposition
Kuomintang about the conditions of the three brothers from Kaohsiung,
southern Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Chiang said that Chang Ming-hui, the father of the three
brothers, faced tremendous pressure about the legality of donations
and tax issues after the public gave an enthusiastic response to his
call for financial help to pay for his eldest son's treatment in the
United States and donated a staggering NT$72 million (US$2.25
million) in just a few days. Chang's decision to seek treatment in
the United States also shows a distrust of domestic medical
standards, she added.
</P>
<P>
Chen pointed out that patients and their families have every
right to choose medical treatment as they see fit, but said it is
necessary to set up a better system for regulating donations.
</P>
<P>
Chen said that he will instruct Bureau of National Health
Insurance to contact the Chang family to inform them of the latest
developments in medical care in Taiwan and to discuss the pros and
cons of the issue, but "will respect the decisions of the family."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Chang Ming-hui confirmed Wednesday that the family
will leave Taiwan Jan. 19 for the United States and is expected to
stay there for between six months and one year.
</P>
<P>
Chang, an official with the Kaohsiung City Government in charge
of laws and regulations, said that the operations and post-surgery
care will take between three and six months, with a further six
months for follow-up treatment, and that they will decide upon the
date of their return only after seeing the progress of the three
brothers.
</P>
<P>
Chang had originally hoped to take only the eldest son,
13-year-old Po-chun, to the United States for treatment, but the
phenomenal amount of donations has enabled them to also take his two
younger brothers.

<P>
President Chen Shui-bian ordered the
Government Information Office (GIO) and related authorities Wednesday
to study measures to protect the opportunities for local
entertainers.
</P>
<P>
Chen issued the directive while receiving members of the Taiwan
Culture and Performance Arts Association led by Yu Tien. GIO
Director-General Lin Chia-lung and Council of Labor Affairs
Chairwoman Chen Chu were also present at the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Chen said show business is an important part of the entertainment
industry and is also the fundamental of the country's cultural and
creative industry.
</P>
<P>
As the Taiwanese identity is being emphasized today, the voice of
every performer should be appreciated, listened to and taken
seriously because each performer represents an irreplaceable opinion
in Taiwan's diverse society, according to Chen.
</P>
<P>
He noted that Taiwan's show business has developed under a
historical background that is different to that of Hong Kong,
mainland China, Japan and South Korea.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, he said, Taiwan cannot follow the successful
experience of other countries and must tailor a favorable environment
for itself.
</P>
<P>
Yu, meanwhile, pointed out that Taiwan used to enjoy a vast
export market for its movies and music but is losing ground today,
with even the domestic market being dominated by imported work.
</P>
<P>
Yu said both the quantity and quality of Taiwan movies, for
example, have declined because of a lack of capital and he urged the
government to help revitalize Taiwan's show business.

PFP HEAD POSTPONES RETURN FROM U.S. AMID SPECULATION ABOUT DPP TIES
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
San Francisco,  Jan. 11 (CNA)
(By Chiang Ying and Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Opposition People First Party (PFP)
Chairman James Soong has decided to stay in the United States for one
more week for "soul searching" amid speculation about the possibility
of the PFP cooperating with the ruling Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP), one of his friends said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Soong was originally scheduled to leave San Francisco for home
Tuesday, but his friend said Soong had postponed his departure until
Jan. 18.
</P>
<P>
Speculation about the formation of a seemingly unlikely PFP-DPP
partnership has been rife since last December's legislative elections
in which the DPP and its traditional "pan-green" ally, the Taiwan
Solidarity Union (TSU) , failed to win a majority in the new
Legislative Yuan to be inaugurated Feb. 1. Speculation about the PFP
cooperating with the DPP in the Feb. 1 elections for legislative
speaker and deputy speaker, or that Soong might serve as next
premier, has been flying for days.
</P>
<P>
Soong has kept his distance from San Francisco Chinese-language
news media and has ordered the PFP headquarters in Taipei to clarify
the rumors instead.
</P>
<P>
His friend, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the
proposal of Soong serving as premier might offer him an opportunity
to stage a political comeback. Nevertheless, such an offer could also
make Soong the target of broadsides from core supporters of the
"pan-blue alliance" of the PFP and the Kuomintang (KMT).
</P>
<P>
In Taiwan's political spectrum, the DPP and the PFP are at
opposite ends, with the DPP leaning toward Taiwan independence and
the PFP looking forward to eventual unification of the two sides of
the Taiwan Strait.
</P>
<P>
Even though no concrete DPP-PFP cooperative projects have ever
been confirmed, many "pan-blue alliance" supporters residing on the
U.S. west coast have voiced strong opposition to any DPP-PFP ties in
local call-in TV talk shows. They have almost unanimously urged the
PFP -- originally a splinter group from the KMT -- to merge with the
KMT as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
Soong, a former Taiwan provincial governor who also once served
as KMT secretary-general, narrowly lost a presidential bid in 2000
when he ran as an independent. He served as running mate of KMT
Chairman Lien Chan in the 2004 presidential election and lost again.
His ties with Lien and the KMT soured in the run-up to the Dec. 11
legislative elections over a combination of issues.
</P>
<P>
As the PFP will have 34 seats in the new legislature, DPP
heavyweights, including acting DPP Chairman Ker Chien-ming and
Kaohsiung Mayor Frank Hsieh, have reportedly been seeking to forge a
partnership with the PFP to facilitate its reform agenda. The DPP and
the TSU will jointly control 101 seats in the new legislature. Should
the DPP manage to forge a coalition, it would control a working
majority in the 225-seat legislature.
</P>
<P>
To the best of his knowledge, Soong's friend said, Soong is still
contemplating his own political future as well as the PFP's
development prospects. Against this backdrop, he said, Soong has
decided to postpone his return to Taipei for a week or so.
</P>
<P>
In Taipei, Presidential Office Secretary-General Su Tseng-chang,
who will soon become the new DPP chairman, noted that President Chen
Shui-bian pledged in his New Year Day address to promote inter-party
reconciliation and unify the "fractured country."
</P>
<P>
In line with the president's declaration, Su said, the DPP has
been striving to forge rapprochement with the opposition parties, not
only the PFP but also the KMT, which will have 79 seats in the new
legislature.
</P>
<P>
Noting that politics is the "art of possibility, " Su said he
hopes the DPP will be able to develop a viable working partnership
with the opposition camp to kick-start many long-stalled reform
projects and policy initiatives.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, acting Ker said that whether a DPP-PFP
partnership will become reality will hinge on Soong's decision.
"Soong holds the key to the prospect of inter-party reconciliation
and social harmony," Ker said, adding that a majority of local people
are fed up with the inter-party wrangling and bickering.
</P>
<P>
Menawhile, Kaohsiung Mayor Frank Hsieh said he is worried
that wild speculation about power-sharing or horse-trading
could wreck possible DPP-PFP cooperation.
</P>
<P>
While the two parties are fostering communciation
channels, Hsieh said neither side has ever proposed any
power-sharing deals. Hsieh echoed Ker's view, saying that whether
the two parties can succeed in forging a partnership will pin
on the PFP's willingness to assist in creating a new political
horizon in Taiwan.

The issue of allowing Taiwan petrochemical

NEARLY 500 FOREST FIRES, INCIDENTS FOR 2003: DGBAS
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Jan.  12 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A total of 491 forest fires, cases of
illegal logging and excessive cultivation in mountainous areas were
reported in 2003 across the country, according to recent government
statistics.
</P>
<P>
Tallies compiled by the Cabinet-level Directorate General of
Budget, Accounting and Statistics (DGBAS) show that the figure
represents a new high in nearly five years, with 291 cases of illegal
logging and excessive cultivation in soil conservation areas making
up the bulk.
</P>
<P>
In terms of the sizes of damaged areas, fires caused the largest
amount of damage to forestry areas, DGBAS officials pointed out,
adding that 2,440 and 4,352 hectares of forest was destroyed in 1999
and 2000, respectively.
</P>
<P>
In an effort to protect the country's natural environment,
slope land and mountainous areas, the government has since 1996
advocated forestation by the private sector, the officials said,
adding that from 2001, about 33,000 hectares of forest has been
restored.
</P>
<P>
Although some 60 percent of Taiwan's territory is covered by
forest, the officials said the scale of the country's forestry
industry remains some way short of commercial production and that
illegal logging must be stopped to guarantee a sustainable growth of
nature and varied ecosystems.
</P>
<P>
As revenue generated by the forestry industry has been decreasing
each year, the government is seeking to promote recreational
businesses in forestal areas, they said, adding that the annual
income from such establishments run by the Taiwan Forestry Bureau
under the Cabinet-level Council of Agriculture grew to a new high of
NT$580 million (US$18 million) in 2003 -- double the 1991 level.
</P>
<P>
The Cabinet-level Council for Economic Planning and Development
(CEPD) said that in the wake of the Dec. 26 earthquake and tsunami
that hit countries in South Asia and Southeast Asia that it will
swiftly put forth a draft bill governing the protection and
restoration of national territory to the Legislative Yuan.
</P>
<P>
The bill calls for adequate measures to protect slope land, river
systems, coastal and sinkage areas, a CEPD official said, citing the
great importance of protecting the natural environment as the key for
the country's sustainable development.

Mainland China's rise as an economic

People First Party Legislator Liu Yi-ju claimed Wednesday.

<P>
Liu said many Taiwan people have become pessimistic about

<P>
"Such doomsday thinking is not correct. China's economic success

its people, who are known for their diligence and entrepreneurship.

Liu said she is convinced that so long as Taiwan's people
maintain their confidence, Taiwan will definitely have a bright
future regardless of whether the mainland is an economic powerhouse
or not.

Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou announced
Wednesday that Chang Hang, director of the city's Department of
Health and concurrently the superintendent of Taipei City Hospital,
will lose his health department post, effective Feb. 1.
</P>
<P>
Ma made the remarks amid public uproar over an incident a day
earlier in which an unconscious four-year-old girl who
had been badly beaten by her drunk father was refused admittance to
Taipei City Hospital's Jen Ai branch and no other city hospital would
admit her because of no beds or necessary facilities. She was
eventually taken by ambulance nearly 200 km to Taichung for
treatment early Tuesday, where emergency surgery was performed. The
child was later reported to be close to death.
</P>
<P>
Ma said that Chang's vacancy will be temporarily filled by his
deputy, Teng Su-wen.
</P>
<P>
According to Ma, Chang is not stepping down, but is only
undergoing an "adjustment of work" that will allow him to target the
deficiencies in the 12 branches of Taipei City hospital and make the
necessary reforms.
</P>
<P>
Ma said that Chang had reported to him that the incident was due
mainly to a neurosurgeon who was supposed to have been on duty but
who did not return to the hospital to see the patient, which Ma said
is an issue involving discipline and medical ethics and is not a
result of the Taipei emergency medical care system going wrong.
</P>
<P>
Ma expressed hope that reforms can be made in the medical care
system, especially the number of beds available, which is frequently
the butt of public criticism.
</P>
<P>
Doctors at the emergency room of the Jen Ai hospital reported
that because there were no available beds at the hospital, while the
23 other hospitals in Taipei they contacted had either no beds or
lacked the necessary facilities, they had to transfer the patient to
a major hospital in Wuchi, Taichung County, which they claimed was in
the best interests of the patient. Jen Ai Hospital also called Taipei
Emergency Operations Center for assistance.

<TEXT>
<P>
The Cabinet-level Department of Health
(DOH) will invest NT$6 billion in developing and producing influenza
vaccines, a DOH official said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a Legislative Yuan science and technology committee
meeting, Hsu Hsu-mei, a DOH official in charge of scientific
development affairs, said that according a World Health Organization
assessment, about 1.2 billion people around the world are highly
susceptible to influenza, but the global flu vaccine supply was only
263 million doses in 2002.
</P>
<P>
In view of a possible flu vaccine shortage, Hsu said, the DOH has
come up with a self-sufficiency plan to address the situation.
</P>
<P>
According to the plan, the government will invest NT$6 billion in
developing new vaccine production know-how and building a production
facility to ensure a full supply of flu vaccine to meet domestic
demand.
</P>
<P>
Initially, Hsu said, the DOH will spend NT$600 million developing
new flu vaccine production technology over a three-year period. The
production facility will be able to produce 20 million doses of flu
vaccine.
</P>
<P>
The project has received the approval of the Council for Economic
PLanning and Development, Hsu said, adding that an inter-department
13-member flu vaccine promotion task force will hold its first
meeting Jan. 17 to work out strategies for realizing the plan as soon
as possible. Kuo Hsu-sung, director of the DOH's Center for Disease
Control, will serve as the task force's convener and the task force
members will include six medical experts and scholars.

<P>
Premier Yu Shyi-kun instructed the
Cabinet-level Council of Agriculture (COA) Wednesday to earmark
NT$100 million (US$3.1 million) to help investors set up standardized
production facilities in the Pingtung Agricultural Biotechnology Park
(PABP).
</P>
<P>
Yu issued the instruction after hearing a report concerning the
establishment of agricultural biotechnology parks in the country
delivered by a COA official during a financial and economic meeting.
</P>
<P>
The premier also asked the COA to assist local governments in
developing the country's four other agricultural biotechnology parks
so that the annual production value of Taiwan's agricultural
biotechnology sector can hit the targeted NT$29 billion as soon as
possible.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the PABP was the first agricultural technology park

inauguration of the park's preparatory office in October 2003, many
manufacturers have expressed willingness to set up production
facilities there.
</P>
<P>
If everything goes smoothly, several investors will be given the
green light to start their plant construction projects in the park in

FREE TRADE ZONE AT KAOHSIUNG PORT SEEKING GREATER INVESTMENT
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Kaohsiung, Jan. 12 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The free trade zone at the southern port
of Kaohsiung began operations on the first of this year and its
administrator is keen on luring more investment to expand the port's
role, officials said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Kaohsiung Harbor Bureau has been courting more investment
after the port gained approval from the Ministry of Transportation
and Communications to run a distribution center, according to bureau
officials.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Yangming Marine Transport Corp. has leased a
three-hectare lot behind the port's third container center, with
plans to make it into a distribution hub, they said.
</P>
<P>
As 14 shipping and various warehousing companies are already
operating in the port, the bureau hopes to help them turn into
businesses exclusively compatible with the free trade zone in its
initial development stage, they said, adding that three of them have
already applied to join the plan.
</P>
<P>
Some other bureau officials have already forecast that Kaohsiung
Port -- Taiwan's largest -- will enjoy more lucrative business with
the start of its free trade zone operations.
</P>
<P>
Shipping firms using the Kaohsiung Port Free Trade Zone, in which
goods, personnel and capital are allowed to move freely, will see
their operating costs and tax rates go down, while they will also
enjoy more speedy customs clearance, they said.
</P>
<P>
They estimated that more than NT$60 million (US$1.8 million)
worth of red tape will be cut each year and that an extra 5 million
tons of cargo can be handled by the harbor, bringing in business
worth over NT$150 million and creating more than 400 jobs.
</P>
<P>
Kaohsiung Harbor dealt with 9.7 million containers in 2004 and it
is expected to break the 10 million mark for this year.
</P>
<P>
Kaohsiung Harbor, along with northern Taiwan's Keelung Harbor,
are the country's first two ports authorized by the central
government to run free trade zones.

</P>
<P>
Kaohsiung Harbor is designated as a transshipment center between
Taiwan and mainland China before full direct trade, transport and
postal links are set up between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait.
</P>
<P>
Keelung Harbor -- Taiwan's second-largest port -- began free
trade business in September last year.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Taichung Harbor in central Taiwan and various economic
processing and industrial zones across the country are waiting for
government final permission to set up free trade zones, part of the
government's drive to make Taiwan into a business operations hub in
the Asia-Pacific region.

TAIWAN RAISES NT$600 MILLION FOR TSUNAMI VICTIMS
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Jan.  11 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The public and private sectors in Taiwan
have raised NT$600 million (US$18.82 million) in cash and 169 tons of
relief materials for victims of the Dec. 26 tsunami in the Indian
Ocean so far, a spokesman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Michel Lu said the Foreign Ministry will ask related government
agencies to ship the materials, especially food that must be consumed
before its expiration date, to the disaster zones as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
He made the comment after the media expressed concern that
medicine and food donated to the tsunami victims could be spoiled
before they can be delivered unless the government speeds up its pace
of shipping them to the victims.
</P>
<P>
Lu said the 169 tons of materials stored in a warehouse in
Taoyuan include 60 tons of food, 30 tons of medical supplies, eight
tons of sterilization equipment and 60 tons of daily necessities.
</P>
<P>
He said China Airlines will deliver two batches of materials
weighing 20 tons and 15 tons, respectively to Indonesia Thursday and
Saturday, with the food being given the top priority.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Lu said, Sri Lanka has appealed to Taiwan for aid in
the form of rice and the Foreign Ministry has asked the Taiwan Root
Medical Peace Corps to ship 24 containers of rice to the country Jan.
20.
</P>
<P>
Of the 24 containers, 20 will contain uncooked rice and four will
contain cooked rice stored in airtight bags.
</P>
<P>
Thailand has asked for 4,000 prefabricated housing units, Lu
said, and the Foreign Ministry is contemplating providing 300 to 500
units.
</P>
<P>
In addition to relief materials, Lu said, Taiwan has sent 376
medical workers to the disaster areas.
</P>
<P>
In a related development Wednesday, more than 10 firms in the
Taoyuan Industrial Zone in Taoyuan County donated NT$1.37 million in
cash to the tsunami victims. Many of the donations came from foreign
laborers who come from the tsunami-stricken countries.
</P>
<P>
National Taipei University in Taipei City held a charity bazaar
Wednesday for the tsunami victims. A total of about 10 tons of
oranges produced in Yunlin, central Taiwan were sold out in half an
hour with a turnover of NT$106,000.
</P>
<P>
The charity bazaar was welcomed by orange growers because it
helped dispose of some of their oranges, the price of which has been
driven to a record low because of overproduction.

FORMER PRESIDENT CALLS FOR FORMATION OF TAIWANESE CULTURE
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Jan. 12 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taiwan should form a unique culture based
on the culture of the indigenous people combined with those of the
Hoklo, Hakka, the Japanese who ruled the island between 1895 and 1945
and the Chinese who moved to Taiwan after the Second World War,
former President Lee Teng-hui said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Giving a speech at a seminar on the future of Taiwan's cultural
development against the backdrop of globalization, the former
president said Taiwan should shed its Chinese culture "which is
nothing but a reincarnation" and is therefore "terrible."
</P>
<P>
Citing the words of Taiwanese centenarian calligrapher Chen
Yun-cheng that "every place in Taiwan is beautiful during the spring
and Taiwan's culture is refreshing every day," Lee said Taiwan should
draw on the international community rather than China for nourishment
of its culture.
</P>
<P>
Some people in Taiwan stress the importance of Chinese culture,
but "we don't know what Chinese culture they are talking about, " Lee
claimed, adding that Chinese culture has no new ingredients despite
its long history.
</P>
<P>
Lee said the opposition Kuomintang (KMT), which ruled the island
for five decades before losing power to the Democratic Progressive
Party (DPP), tried to implant Chinese culture into Taiwan, a move he
described as dangerous because, he claimed, it makes Taiwanese
identify with Chinese culture and more ready to embrace the culture
shaped by the Chinese communists.
</P>
<P>
Now that the KMT has been deposed, it is very clear that the DPP
administration should instill a Taiwanese mentality, including the
history and geography of the country, into the Taiwan people, Lee
went on.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan, which has been ruled by outsiders for the last 400 years,
has never established its own identity. Now, Lee said, it is time for
the island to form a culture of its own that is a vital part of its
identity.

CAA CHIEF CANCELS EUROPE TRIP AHEAD OF CHARTER FLIGHT TALKS

<P>
Civil Aeronautics Administration (CAA)
Director-General Billy K.C. Chang canceled a trip to Europe Wednesday
amid reports that he might be asked to participate in forthcoming
cross-Taiwan Strait negotiations over the launch of special charter
flights during the Lunar New Year holiday.
</P>
<P>
Chang was originally scheduled to head for Holland via a China
Airlines flight Wednesday to start a European market-survey tour.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) Vice Chairman Chiu
Tai-san said the government had yet to decide on who will join the
delegation to negotiate terms with mainland China for the holiday
charter flights.
</P>
<P>
Noting that relevant government agencies must be allowed to
participate in negotiations on issues regarding the exercise of
public authority, Chiu said the makeup of the delegation cannot be
determined until after Beijing comes up with a list of topics to be
discussed.
</P>
<P>
Chiu said the Taipei Airlines Association (TAA) , a private
organization authorized to negotiate holiday charter flights with the
mainland, has not yet received any Beijing-proposed agenda.
</P>
<P>
Beijing officials said earlier in the day that officials from the
MAC, which charts Taiwan's policy toward the mainland, and Taiwan's
quasi-official Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF), should not be part
of the delegation. In response, Chiu said the selection of members of
the delegation will depend on the topics to be discussed. "We hope
the mainland can determine the agenda as soon as possible to
facilitate follow-up arrangements," Chiu said.
</P>
<P>
He also urged the mainland to uphold its previous promise and
conduct charter flight talks in line with the principles of mutual
respect and pragmatism.
</P>
<P>
Cabinet spokesman Chen Chi-mai also said that differences between
Taiwan and the mainland on the participants in the talks can be
resolved through consultations.
</P>
<P>
He said the problem is not going to impede the launch of the
charter flight services, since both sides have reached a high degree
of consensus on the major principles regarding the flights.
</P>
<P>
Chen said he believes the flights will be successfully operated
if both sides conduct the negotiations pragmatically.
</P>
<P>
In what has been hailed by Taiwan as a breakthrough in the
charter flight arrangements, Taipei Airlines Association head Michael
Lo, with the MAC authorization, held talks with China Civil Aviation 
Association (CCAA) Executive Director Pu Zhaozhou in Macau
last week and came to an initial agreement in principle.
</P>
<P>
The MAC has proposed that follow-up talks be carried out
according to the model of the 2002 Taiwan-Hong Kong aviation talks,
in which MAC and CAA officials took part in their capacities as
TAA advisers.
</P>
<P>
However, He Shizhong, director of the Economics Bureau of the
mainland's Taiwan Affairs Office, said Wednesday that it would be
"inappropriate, impractical and insincere" to suggest that officials
from the MAC and SEF take part in the talks. He stopped short of
saying whether CAA officials can take part in the negotiations.

Taiwan might have to stop bringing in
laborers from Vietnam if the Vietnamese government cannot help bring
down the number of Vietnamese workers who abscond from their Taiwan
posts, Council of Labor Affairs Chairwoman Chen Chu said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Noting that a Vietnamese labor official who visited Taiwan in
December pledged to track down and send back to Vietnam at least
2,000 absconded Vietnamese workers by the end of December, Chen said
that if the number of workers actually repatriated is too far from
what was promised, further imports of Vietnamese workers might have
to be suspended.
</P>

Chen said the Vietnamese authorities have asked for more time to
track down the unaccounted for workers and have been given three
extra months to meet their promise, but she added that Taiwan's

PFP CHAIRMAN NOT IN WASHINGTON, D.C.: PAN-BLUE OFFICE IN U.S.
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Washington,  Jan. 12 (CNA)
(By Oliver Lin and Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The representative office of Taiwan's
opposition "pan-blue alliance" of the Kuomintang (KMT) and the People
First Party (PFP) in the United States said Wednesday that PFP
Chairman James Soong is not in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
The representative office was responding to media reports that
said that Soong is scheduled to meet with U.S. Deputy Assistant
Secretary of State Randall C. Schriver Friday in Washington, D.C.
along with the "pan-blue alliance" representative office director,
Yuan Chien-sheng.
</P>
<P>
The report said that Soong was to talk with Schriver about the
possible cooperation between the ruling Democratic Progressive Party
and the PFP, a bill on the peaceful development between the two sides
of the Taiwan Strait proposed by the PFP, and Taiwan's proposed arms
procurement from the United States, which is still pending in the
"pan-blue"-controlled legislature.
</P>
<P>
The report cited sources as saying that Schriver will explain to
Soong that the military balance in the Taiwan Strait is tilting
toward Beijing, hoping to solicit the support of the PFP to secure
the speedy approval of the proposed arms procurement deal.
</P>
<P>
The representative office said that Soong was not in Washington,
D.C. and it had no information indicating that he would come.
</P>
<P>
In Taipei, Liu Wen-hsiung, PFP caucus whip in the Legislative
Yuan, could not confirm whether Soong would meet with Schriver.
However, he said that Soong, having a doctorate in politics from
Georgetown University, has many friends and teachers involved with
U.S. politics, and "it is only natural that he might meet some
political figures."

DOCTORS MUST BE CHARGED IN CASE OF BEATEN GIRL: JUSTICE MINISTER
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Jan. 13 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The emergency room doctors at Taipei City
Hospital's Jen Ai branch who had not treated an unconscious
four-year-old girl who had been badly beaten should be charged with
negligence, Minister of Justice Chen Ding-nan said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Taipei District Prosecutors Office began investigations into
the case Tuesday while demanding the arrest of the girl's divorced
and unemployed father, surnamed Chiu, who is alleged to have beaten
the girl while under the influence of alcohol late Monday night, Chen
said at the Legislative Yuan.
</P>
<P>
The four-year-old was sent to the Jen Ai Hospital's emergency
room at 1: 55 a.m. Tuesday but was not treated due to a lack of beds
in the neurosurgery section. The hospital then called the Taipei
Emergency Operations Center for assistance.
</P>
<P>
At that point, the Taipei Emergency Operations Center tried in
vain until 4: 18 a.m. to find an emergency room in Taipei that would
take the child, finally giving up after being rejected at six
locations.
</P>
<P>
It was then decided that the girl should be driven to Tungs'
Taichung MetroHarbor Hospital in Wuchi, Taichung County in central
Taiwan. By the time the child reached Tungs' Hospital's operating
room, it was past dawn Tuesday morning.
</P>
<P>
Surgeons at Tungs' Hospital immediately preformed surgery to
remove a blood clot from the girl's brain and a second operation to
try to relieve swelling was done later at around midnight of the same
day. Doctors say they are not very optimistic about the child's
chances for survival.
</P>
<P>
The surgeons said that the situation ought to be clearer Thursday
or Friday as to whether the child will survive.
</P>
<P>
Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou said Wednesday that he had been briefed
by Chang Heng, director of the city's Department of Health and
concurrently the superintendent of Taipei City Hospital. Chang told
the mayor that the incident was due mainly to a neurosurgeon who was
supposed to have been on duty but who was not at the hospital. Ma
said the incident is an issue involving discipline and medical
ethics, not a failure of the Taipei emergency medical care system.
</P>
<P>
Ma subsequently announced Wednesday that Chang Heng will be
removed from his health department post effective Feb. 1, calling the
move an "adjustment of work" that will allow Chang Heng to target the
deficiencies in the 12 branches of Taipei City Hospital and make
necessary changes. Chang's vacancy will be temporarily filled by his
deputy, Teng Su-wen.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Ma said, the neurosurgeon at the Jen Ai emergency room
should have been on duty and performed an emergency operation on the
girl immediately upon her arrival and left the issue of finding a bed
for later.
</P>
<P>
Although not blaming the medical care system, Ma said
improvements could be made, such as addressing the number of beds in
facilities, an issue that many patients have complained about in the
past.
</P>
<P>
The Taipei District Prosecutors' Office has questioned employees
at the Taipei Emergency Operations Center and the hospitals involved
as to why they failed to find a bed for the girl in Taipei. The
prosecutors said that those found blameworthy will be dealt with
accordingly.
</P>
<P>
Doctors from Jen Ai Hospital released a statement Thursday saying
that the hospital had acted according to protocol and that one of the
main issues was that the emergency room was not equipped to perform
the kind of surgery that the girl needed, in addition to the issue of
a lack of bed space in the intensive care unit.

<P>
If opposition People First Party (PFP)
Chairman James Soong meets with U.S. officials in Washington, D.C.,
it will help the political development in Taiwan, the acting chairman
of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Ker Chien-ming, also DPP caucus whip in the Legislative Yuan,
made the remarks after media reports said that Soong will meet with
U.S. Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Randall C. Schriver Friday.
</P>
<P>
The report said that Soong was to talk with Schriver about the
possible cooperation between the DPP and the PFP on a bill on the
peaceful development between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait
proposed by the PFP, and Taiwan's proposed arms procurement from the
United States, which is still pending in the opposition-controlled
legislature.
</P>
<P>
"Soong's exchange of views with U.S. officials on cross-strait
issues and the political situation in Taiwan indicates that he is
pondering the nation's future political situation and is
preparing his next move," Ker said, adding that "this is positive for
Taiwan's political development."
</P>
<P>
Ker said that he does not know what Soong might say, but the fact
remains that the United States has always been concerned about the
pending arms procurement and Taiwan's political development.
</P>
<P>
The DPP is currently trying to woo the PFP to form a working
majority in the 225-member Legislative Yuan after the DPP garnered
fewer than expected seats in the Dec. 11 legislative elections.
Speculation has been rife about the PFP possibly being given posts in
the upcoming reshuffled Cabinet and cooperating in the election of
the speaker and vice speaker of the legislature.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, Lien Chan, chairman of the Kuomintang (KMT),
dismissed media reports that Soong had called him recently over the
PFP's possible cooperation with the DPP.
</P>
<P>
Lien made the remarks after he led several KMT vice chairmen to
pay their respects to former President Chiang Ching-kuo at his
temporary mausoleum in Touliao, Taoyuan, on the 17th anniversary of
his death.
</P>
<P>
"There was no call from Soong from the United States," Lien said.
</P>
<P>
As for the reported meeting between Soong and U.S. officials,
Lien said that the KMT's representative to the U.S. has said nothing
to him on the matter.

Former Mainland Affairs Council
Chairwoman Tsai Ing-wen told a group of U.S. think tank scholars in
Washington, D.C. Wednesday that Taiwan's constitutional
re-engineering plan will not touch on sensitive sovereignty issues.
</P>
<P>
Tsai, who will become a ruling Democratic Progressive Party
legislator-at-large Feb. 1, has kept a low profile during her current
U.S. visit. She would not talked to 10-plus Taiwan and Hong Kong
reporters waiting outside the Brookings Institution after attending a
closed-door symposium organized by the noted think tank.
</P>
<P>
Richard Bush, a former American Institute in Taiwan (AIT)
chairman, who is now director of the Brookings Institution's Center
for Northeast Asian Policy Studies, briefed the media on the
symposium.
</P>
<P>
Bush said Tsai had delivered a report on Taiwan's major political
developments over the past few months and its possible future policy
directions during the seminar attended by some 40 U.S. scholars and
experts.
</P>
<P>
Bush quoted Tsai as having said she supports President Chen
Shui-bian's declaration in his May 20 second inauguration speech that
his constitutional reform program will not address any sensitive
sovereignty and territory issues.
</P>
<P>
During the seminar, Bush said topics regarding Beijing's proposed
"anti-secession law" were also discussed, but he would not elaborate
on the details. Bush said his personal view was that public comments
on the proposed law should not be made until after the text of the
legislation is unveiled.
</P>
<P>
Bush said two other former AIT chairmen, Nat Bellocchi and David
Dean, as well as Prof. Harry Harding of George Washington University,
and several research fellows with the Center for Strategic
and International Studies, including Bates Gill, were among the
participants. Also present was Rupert Hammond-Chambers, president of
the U.S.-Taiwan Business Council.
</P>
<P>
Tsai arrived in Washington, D.C. Tuesday and is scheduled to head
for New York Friday to attend a seminar on Taiwan's constitutional
re-engineering plan.

<P>
A group of hospital representatives
demanded Thursday that the Department of Health (DOH) set up a
committee in one week to monitor National Health Insurance reform and
address the deficiencies in the medical system and its emergency care
services.
</P>
<P>
Also, the representatives resolved to reform the medical sector
and will publicize the financial reports of their hospitals to
rebuild public confidence in Taiwan's medical services.
</P>
<P>
Hsieh Wen-hui, president of the Taiwan Community Hospital
Association, said the recent incident in which a severely abused
four-year-old girl was refused treatment in Taipei City and sent away
to Taichung County is a blemish on the medical sector and has exposed
the indifference and the lack of devotion and a sense of mission
among medical workers.
</P>

Hsieh said the way the girl was kicked around like a hot potato
reflected only the tip of the iceberg of deficiencies involving the

TAIPEI MAYOR MAY DELAY AUSTRALIA TRIP OUT OF CONCERN FOR ABUSED GIRL

Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou said Thursday
that he might delay his planned trip to Australia for a day or two to
deal with the fallout after a four-year-old girl who was beaten
nearly to death was turned away from a number of hospitals in Taipei.
She is barely clinging to life in a hospital in Taichung.
</P>
<P>
Ma was originally scheduled to leave Thursday night for Melbourne
to take part in the closing ceremony of the Deaflympics on Sunday as
the representative of the host city of Taipei for the 2009
Deaflympics.
</P>
<P>
He said that as mayor of the host city, he must go to Melbourne
to accept the event flag in line with international protocol, but
considering the condition of the battered girl, he is now contacting
Australia to try to change the schedule.
</P>
<P>
Ma noted that according to newspaper reports, the girl led a
miserable life before she was allegedly beaten by her drunken father.
Her condition has deteriorated since having to be moved by ambulance
to a hospital in Taichung before getting a needed surgery for her
severe head injuries in Taipei.
</P>
<P>

Mayor Ma tried to visit the child in the Taichung hospital, but

EXPORT CONTROLs ON STRATEGIC HI-TECH COMMODITIES TIGHTENED

Taipei,  Jan.  13 (CNA)

<TEXT>
<P>
The Bureau of Foreign Trade (BOFT) has
stepped up export controls on strategic hi-tech commodities from this
month in line with international efforts against terrorism and the
proliferation of nuclear and biological weapons, BOFT officials said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The measures will not undermine the competitiveness of Taiwan
exporters because similar measures are being implemented by Asian
competitors including Japan and South Korea, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
While export controls on these commodities has been enforced
internationally for years, U.S.-led international export control
organizations have expressed concern over the export of Taiwan-made
precision instruments to Iran, Iraq, North Korea, Liberia and
mainland China after the 911 terrorist attacks on the United States,
they pointed out.
</P>
<P>
The BOFT will now punish any exporters who fail to make customs
declarations as required and will put such exporters on a blacklist
that will make all their exports subject to strict inspection, they
said.

TAIPEI CITY LOSES LITIGATION OVER PREMIUM SUBSIDY DISPUTE
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Jan.  13 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Taipei High Administrative Court
announced Thursday that the Taipei city government has lost a suit
over how city government subsidies to national health insurance
premiums should be charged.
</P>
<P>
It means that the city will have to repay the NT$10.84 billion
(US$324.55 million) that it did not pay to the Bureau of National
Health Insurance between 1999 and 2002 in city governmental
subsidies, and NT$9.95 billion (US$298 million) that it did not pay
to the Labor Insurance Bureau between 1992 and 2000 in city
governmental subsidies, judges from the Taipei High Administrative
Court said.
</P>
<P>
The money, according to the Bureau of National Health Insurance
and Labor Insurance Bureau, represents subsidies the city government
should pay for the insurance premiums.
</P>
<P>
The city government filed a lawsuit with the Taipei High
Administrative Court against the Bureau of National Health Insurance
as well as the Labor Insurance Bureau several years ago, arguing that
its subsidies for the insurance premium should be calculated
according to the number of residents in the city, which is 2.63
million, rather than according to the number of employees hired by
companies and firms headquartered in Taipei, which is 3.58 million.
</P>
<P>
This argument failed to convince the court, which said in its
judgment that since none of the articles in the existing labor
insurance statute and the national health insurance law stipulates
that the city government should make the governmental subsidy
payments based on individual insurance holders.
</P>
<P>
In response to the judgment, Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou said that
the city government will discuss the matter with its lawyers and if
necessary, the city government will file an appeal with the Supreme
Administrative Court.
</P>
<P>
Chang Chiung-wen, a spokesperson for the Taipei High
Administrative Court said that even if the city government files for
an appeal with the Supreme Administrative Court, it will not bar the
Labor Insurance Bureau nor the Bureau of National Health Insurance
from executing their right to demand that the city government repay
the money.
</P>
<P>
Welcoming the Taipei High Administration Court's rejection of the
suit, Shih Chieh, director-general of the Labor Insurance Bureau,
said that the judgment will serve as a strong legal arm to forcibly
demand the city government to repay what it should have paid.
</P>
<P>
Lai Chin-hsiang, vice president of the Bureau of National Health
Insurance, said that the bureau will not only recover the outstanding
NT$10.84 billion for the period before 2002, the bureau will also
seek that the city government repay the NT$11 billion for 2003 and
2004.

NO WATER SHORTAGE FOR TAIWAN IN FIRST HALF OF 2005: WRA
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei, Jan. 13 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Water supplies for civic and industrial use
in the first half of this year have been assured, as have supplies
for irrigation for the first crop of the season, officials of the
Water Resources Agency (WRA) under the Ministry of Economic Affairs
said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Major reservoirs and rivers across the country now contain large
amounts of water and the weather in the coming three months is
forecast to be largely normal, which means water supplies are ensured
for both the general public and factories in Taiwan proper, WRA
officials said.
</P>
<P>
They said a water shortage is not expected to occur in the first
six months of this year, dousing public concerns over the drought
that has afflicted parts of the country in the past few years.
</P>
<P>
At present, major reservoirs in northern Taiwan are nearly at
full capacity, with the highest levels in recent years, while those
in central and southern regions are at about 80 percent of capacity.
</P>
<P>
However, the officials were reserved about the situation in
northern Taoyuan County beyond April, where water demand is
particularly high due to heavy industrial consumption.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, there will be no water problems on the offshore
islands of Kinmen and Matsu through the first six months, they said,
although they pointed out that Matsu is an exception.
</P>
<P>
Matsu's Nankang area has been troubled by a water shortage, as
local reservoirs contain only a combined 68,700 tons of water. Local
residents are now provided with water on only two out of every three
days.
</P>
<P>
The WRA is planning to ship a total of 190,000 tons of water to
the remote island, some 8,500 tons of which has already been
transported to meet demand.

FORENSIC MEDICINE PERSONNEL DRAFT LAW PASSES FIRST READING
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Jan. 13 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Judicial Committee of the Legislative
Yuan passed Thursday the first reading of a draft law on forensic
medicine personnel.
</P>
<P>
According to the draft, only people from graduate schools of
forensic medicine of colleges and universities will be eligible to
take the forensic medicine personnel examination.
</P>
<P>
The draft law stipulates that the examination and the licensing
of forensic medicine personnel must be an independent system, drawing
a clear line between them and physicians in the hope that it will help
solve the problem of a shortage of forensic medicine personnel and
upgrade the quality and standard of such personnel.
</P>
<P>
A forensic medicine specialist cannot work as a physician, while
a physician wishing to specialize in forensic medicine will have to
pass the necessary examination, unlike current practice, which has no
such restrictions.
</P>
<P>
However, Legislator Chou Hsi-wei of the opposition People First
Party said that even if the draft law is passed into law, it will not
entice enough people to serve as forensic medicine personnel.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Justice Chen Ding-nan said that at present, a
forensic medicine specialist can only earn around NT$100,000
(US$3,125) per month as a prosecutor, and added that he is mulling
whether an adjustment is needed to entice talented people to do
forensic work.

PFP CONFIRMS CHAIRMAN WILL  MEET WITH U.S. POLITICIANS IN WASHINGTON
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Opposition People First Party (PFP)
Chairman James Soong will head for Washington, D.C. in the coming
days to meet with U.S. officials and think tank scholars, a PFP
official said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Chang Hsien-yao, director of the PFP policy research center and
also a legislator-elect, was responding to media reports that Soong,
who has been in San Francisco for some time, will meet with
U.S. Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Randall C. Schriver in
Washington Friday.
</P>
<P>
Out of respect for "U.S. friends, " Chang said he could not
divulge any specific U.S. politician with whom Soong will meet during
his visit.
</P>
<P>
Chang said Soong will exchange views with U.S. political figures
on the cross-Taiwan Strait situation and the PFP-proposed bill on
promotion of cross-strait peace because these issues are related to
U.S. interests.
</P>
<P>
Asked whether U.S. politicians will bring up issues regarding a
proposed U.S. arms sale to Taiwan worth NT$610.8 billion (about US$18
billion), Chang did not rule out the possibility.
</P>
<P>
"Soong is an opposition leader. I think that U.S. officials will
grasp the opportunity to communicate with him about the proposed arms
deal," Chang said.
</P>
<P>
The special budget bill for the massive arms procurement package,
which includes eight diesel-electric submarines, a squadron of 12
submarine-hunting P-3C Orion aircraft and six Patriot PAC-III
anti-missile batteries, has been pending in the Legislative Yuan,
which which is controlled by the PFP and its "pan-blue" ally, the
Kuomintang (KMT).
</P>
<P>
Chang said that even if U.S. officials discuss the arms package
with Soong, the PFP is not expected to soften its stance on the deal.
He stressed that the special budget bill is unlikely to clear the
legislative floor before the current legislative session closes Jan.
21.
</P>
<P>
Chang further said that Soong will definitely hold a news
conference to explain the content of his talks with U.S.
political figures. "There won't be any secret deal," he added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, PFP legislative whip Liu Wen-hsiung said that as the
leader of an opposition party, Soong has a certain level of
influence, "so it's normal that foreign friends want to see him, " he
added.
</P>
<P>
Soong reportedly is angry at the premature exposure of his
planned meeting with Schriver. Party sources said only a few
"pan-blue alliance" core members, including the alliance's
representative in the United States Huang Chien-sheng, was aware of
the planned meeting. PFP headquarters said it will investigate into
how the information was leaked to the local media.
</P>
<P>
News of the planned Soong-Schriver meeting came amid reports that
the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) is seeking to forge a
seemingly unlikely partnership with the PFP.
</P>
<P>
DPP legislative whip Ker Chien-ming, who concurrently serves as
acting DPP chairman, said he takes a positive view of Soong's
upcoming meeting with Schriver. In his view, Ker said, such a meeting
implies that Soong is contemplating Taiwan's future and his next
move.
</P>
<P>
Ker said the DPP truly looks forward to forming a working
partnership with the PFP. But he admitted that no DPP heavyweights,
including himself, are clear on Soong's true intentions.
</P>
<P>
Ker said he is hopeful that Soong can return to Taipei soon and
meet with President Chen Shui-bian to talk about inter-party
reconciliation and cooperation to facilitate national unity, social
harmony and economic development.

PRESIDENT'S SOUTH PACIFIC TRIP SCHEDULE YET TO BE SET: OFFICIAL

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President Chen Shui-bian's upcoming
overseas travel itinerary has yet to be decided and will be announced
by the Presidential Office when it is finalized, a spokesman for the
Ministry of Foreign Affairs said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Michel Lu made the remarks in response to media speculation that
Chen is likely to make a stopover in Guam on his way back from a trip
to the South Pacific later this month.
</P>
<P>
Asked whether Chen will meet with U.S. officials to exchange
views on issues of mutual concern in Guam if he decides to make a
stopover there, Lu said that judging from pragmatic viewpoints, it
would be feasible for the president to do so.
</P>
<P>
A team from the Presidential Office is currently in a South
Pacific country discussing the technical details concerning the
president's visit.
</P>
<P>
Chen is scheduled to leave Taipei Jan. 27 to attend the
inauguration of Palau's president followed by a visit to one or two
other allies in the South Pacific.
</P>
<P>
Chen had originally wanted to visit all five allies of the
Republic of China in the South Pacific -- which also include
Kiribati, Tuvalu and the Marshall Islands -- but out of consideration
of the imminent Cabinet reshuffle and various other factors, he was
unable to.
</P>
<P>
This will be Chen's first trip to the South Pacific since he
assumed the presidency in May 2000, and his second official overseas
visit since he assumed his second term as president May 20. He
visited the Central American states of Panama and Belize in early
September.

The best state schools have overtaken their fee-paying

published today. 

Financial Times: Sharp rise in US tade deficit hits the dollar.

The US trade deficit widened sharply in November to a record
$60.3bn ( £32.1bn), renewing pressure on the ailing dollar and
causing economists to scale back their forecasts for economic
growth. 

The gap between imports and exports grew by $4.3bn over
the month and has now risen by almost $10bn since September.

The main culprits were a surge in the volume of imports of
oil products and a decline in demand for US capital goods.

CROSS-STRAIT FREEWAY IS BEIJING'S POLITICAL PROPAGANDA: OFFICIAL
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Jan.  13 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mainland China's proposal to build a
Beijing-Taipei freeway is merely "political propaganda" and has no
significance, a government spokesman said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Executive Yuan spokesman Chen Chi-mai was responding to media
reports that mainland China's Minister of Communications Zhang
Chunxian said earlier in the day that a freeway network plan just
unveiled also includes a Beijing-Taipei freeway.
Although it might seem like an impossible mission at present, the
mainland hopes to accomplish it by 2030, Zhang added.
</P>
<P>
Chen noted that tunnel engineers from both sides of the Taiwan
Strait broached the idea of a cross-strait freeway several years ago
and have even suggested several possible routes, although many
scholars have said that with the existing technology, it will be
impossible to overcome the problem resulting from the "Black Tide"
and the marine trench in the Taiwan Strait.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, a long-distance tunnel would have to have safety as its
top priority and would have to take into consideration possible
incidents or major casualties, Chen added.
</P>
<P>
Other issues such as ventilation, maintenance and economic
efficiency would also have to be assessed, he said.
</P>
<P>
Chen said that because of these insurmountable technical problems
and the high risk factor, the mainland communications minister's
promotion of a freeway is no more than a far-fetched exercise in
political propaganda.
</P>
<P>
"If China wants to contribute to cross-strait development, we
hope that it will address cross-strait issues in a pragmatic manner,"
Chen said.
</P>
<P>
The mainland could start with removing the obstacles marring the
launch of cross-strait charter flights during the Chinese New Year
holiday, facilitate cross-strait cargo transportation and bring about
direct cross-strait trade, postal and transportation links, he added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Taiwan Area National Expressway Engineering Bureau
under the Ministry of Transportation and Communications said that
cross-strait section of any Taiwan-Beijing freeway would pose a major
challenge because there are no bridges or tunnels in the world that
are as long as the Taiwan Strait is wide.
</P>
<P>
If political factors are not taken into consideration, building a
tunnel on that section would be more feasible than a bridge based on
pragmatic technical assessments, bureau officials said, although
tunneling would also present the problem of geological changes.
</P>
<P>
The officials noted that there are two undersea tunnels -- the
English Channel Tunnel linking Britain and France and Japan's Seikan
Tunnel linking its main island of Honshu and the northern
neighboring island of Hokkaido -- both of which are only about 50 km
long and are railway tunnels -- compared with the Taiwan Strait,
which is more than 100 km wide at its narrowest point.
</P>
<P>
If the bridge option were to be adopted, there would be massive
difficulties in both construction and operation.

MAC PROPOSES CROSS-STRAIT CHARTER FLIGHT TALKS IN MACAU SATURDAY
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Jan. 13 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Cabinet-level Mainland Affairs Council
(MAC) said Thursday it has commissioned Michael Lo, president of the
Taipei Airlines Association (TAA) , to negotiate terms with mainland
China in Macau Saturday for special charter flights during the
upcoming Chinese New Year holiday.
</P>
<P>
The nation's top mainland policy planning agency said in a press
statement that with a view to realizing the special charter flight
plan, Taiwan has demonstrated the maximum of sincerity in proposing
the negotiation delegates, the time and the venue.

</P>
<P>
"We have taken into account mainland China's difficulties and
inconveniences, " the MAC said in the press release, adding that it
hopes the mainland will honor its promise to facilitate the
realization of the much-anticipated charter flight plan.
</P>
<P>
With less than a month before the Lunar New Year, the MAC urged
the mainland to confirm the proposed schedule and venue and inform
the TAA of the delegates it plans to send as soon as possible so that
the negotiations can get underway.
</P>
<P>
According to the MAC press statement, Billy K.C. Chang,
director-general of Taiwan's Civil Aeronautics Administration, will
take part in the charter flight negotiations in his capacity as a TAA
adviser.
</P>
<P>
Beijing officials said the previous day that officials from the
MAC, which charts Taiwan's policy toward the mainland, and Taiwan's
quasi-official Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF), should not be part
of the delegation, but they stopped short of saying whether Taiwan's
CAA officials can take part in talks in their capacities as TAA
advisers.
</P>
<P>
Lo said Thursday that he has informed Pu Zhaozhou, vice president
of the Cross-Strait Air Transport Exchange Commission under the
Beijing-based China Civil Aviation Association, of the MAC-proposed
schedule, venue and negotiation delegates.

</P>
<P>
Pu, who is also director the Civil Aviation Administration of
China's Taiwan Affairs Office, met with Lo in Macau last week and
came to an initial agreement in principle on the special charter
flight services.
</P>
<P>
The two sides has basically agreed that the charter flights will
be operated on the principle of "joint participation, two-way
services and no stopovers in a third place."
</P>
<P>
With Beijing's consent, six Taiwan carriers operated Chinese New
Year charter flights in 2003 between Shanghai and Taipei/Kaohsiung
via Hong Kong/Macau. The services were not offered the following year
because Beijing insisted that mainland carriers also be allowed to
offer the service but refused to come to the negotiating table to
discuss the necessary technical details with Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
This time around, the destinations on the mainland side may
increase to include Beijing and Guangzhou. Beijing has also proposed
that Taichung be included in the destinations on the Taiwan side, but
Taiwan officials basically insist that only Taipei and Kaohsiung be
included.

The Executive Yuan gave a green light
Thursday to a plan to set up a free trade zone at Taichung Harbor in

</P>
<P>
The free trade zone is expected to start services at the end of

</P>
<P>
It will be the country's third free trade zone including one at

earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
The zone will cover an area of 536 hectares, which will make it
the largest of the three, according to officials from the Council for
Economic Planning and Development (CEPD).
</P>
<P>
Situated near the Changpin Industrial Zone and the Tantzu and
Chungkang export processing zones, as well as a planned international
airport, the free trade zone is expected to become the hub for
imports and exports in central Taiwan, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
The plan was approved during a meeting of the free trade zone
coordination committee hosted by Vice Premier Yeh Chu-lan.
</P>
<P>
Also during the meeting, Yeh ordered the Council of Labor Affairs
to study the feasibility of allowing the employment of foreign
workers in the service sector in free trade zones and to submit a
report on the issue in four months.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, CEPD officials said the government is planning to set
a quota to control the number of foreign workers hired in free trade
zones at 40 percent of the total new hires.

BLIND PEOPLE CAN `CLEARLY SEE WORLD BY HEART': PRESIDENT

<DATELINE>
Taipei, Jan 13 (CNA)
(By Luis Huang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President Chen Shui-bian encouraged visually
impaired people Tuesday to "see the world by heart," claiming that in
this way they will see it more clearly than sighted people.
</P>
<P>
Chen made the remarks while receiving John Lan, a visually
impaired and otherwise physically challenged artist, at the
Presidential Office. It was their ninth meeting since 1998, when Chen
suffered a setback in his re-election bid for the Taipei mayorship.
</P>
<P>
Lan, 41, has overcome his disability to organize a band and has
become a successful jazz drummer.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Lan presented a book titled "John Lan," which
he dictated to Sung Fang-chi, while Chen repaid him with five words
-- "a successful fighter for life."
</P>
<P>
Lan told the president that he will donate the royalties from 200
copies of his book to help three brothers from Kaohsiung who are
suffering from a rare disorder called adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD).
</P>
<P>
Chen noted that the public have already donated NT$72 million
(US$2.25 million) to the family in just a few days to help pay for
the eldest son's medical treatment in the United States, showing the
great love of the people of Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the public and private sectors in Taiwan have also
shown their great love to the victims of the Dec. 26 tsunami in the
Indian Ocean by raising millions of dollars to help them, Chen went
on.
</P>
<P>
The president also invited Lan's band to perform during a state
banquet he will host in honor of a friendly nation's president in the
near future.

TAICHUNG HOPES TO BE INCLUDED IN LUNAR NEW YEAR CHARTER FLIGHTS
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Jan.  13 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taichung Mayor Jason Hu and Taichung
Magistrate Huang Chung-sheng jointly urged the central government
Thursday to include Chingchuankang (CCK) Airport in the Lunar New
Year charter flight services between Taiwan and mainland China.
</P>
<P>
They issued the call after reports that the Cabinet-level
Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) might reject a proposal to include the
central Taiwan airport in the special program designed to transport
mainland-based Taiwan businessmen wishing to spend the Chinese New
Year holiday early next month at home.
</P>
<P>
Claiming that national security issues cited by the MAC as a
reason for excluding CCK Airport from the program can be overcome
"technically, " Hu called on the central government to rethink its
decision.
</P>
<P>
Taichung is located close to Xiamen in Fujian Province, where
there is a large number of Taiwan businessmen from Taichung, Hu
claimed, adding that the interests of citizens from central Taiwan
must be heeded.
</P>
<P>
Passenger and cargo air transport services between the two sides,
Huang said, are very important for both sides amid frequent and close
trade and economic relations across the Taiwan Strait.
</P>
<P>
Air travel between Taichung and Xiamen would be time and cost
effective for the many businessmen in Xiamen who come from central
Taiwan regions, Huang said.
</P>
<P>
Should the central government include CCK Airport in the charter
flight services, it would help boost the airport's aim of becoming an
international airport, Huang said.
</P>
<P>
Both Hu and Huang claimed that the national security concerns
highlighted by the MAC can be resolved by imposing a quota mechanism,
setting a limit on the number of mainland carriers coming to
Taichung.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan and the mainland have in principle agreed that carriers
from both sides will take part in the charter flight services under
the principle of "non-stop, round-trip, multi-destinations, " but
concrete details have yet to be worked out.
</P>
<P>
Chinese New Year charter flights for Taiwan businessmen took off
for the first time in 2003, involving Taiwan carriers only. The
special service failed to take place in 2004 due to the mainland's
demand that mainland carriers be allowed to take part and its refusal
to discuss the issue with the Taiwan authorities.
</P>
<P>
Direct transport, trade and postal links between Taiwan and
mainland China have been absent due to long-standing political
feuding since 1949, when the two sides split after a civil war.

South Asia and Southeast Asia, CAL has carried out five relief
missions, transporting 65 medical personnel, rescuers and a total of
40 tons of aid materials to victims in the affected countries, as

U.N. REPORT SENDS WARNING SIGNAL ABOUT TAIWAN'S CORAL REEFS
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Jan.  13 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A recent United Nations report on the
status of the world's coral reefs sent a warning signal to the Taiwan
authorities with the news that nearly 75 percent of them have been
damaged or are seriously threatened.
</P>
<P>
The global report, titled Status of Coral Reefs of the World:
2004, attributed bleaching of coral reefs off Taiwan's coasts to a
combination of factors, including overfishing, waste-water
pollution, damage by recreational divers and nuclear power plant
operations.
</P>
<P>
The report, issued by UNESCO, analyzes the coral reef status in
96 countries around the world, including Taiwan. According to the
report, coral reefs exist in the waters surrounding Taiwan, except
for the west coast.
</P>
<P>
Of the 32 Taiwan coral reef areas subject to the UNESCO study, 18
of them have lost up to 70 percent of their live coral colonies due
to bleaching, the report said.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, aquaculture ponds, highway construction,
recreational parks and farming in Taiwan's coastal regions, coupled
with soil degradation and mudslides, have all hurt Taiwan's coral
reef health.
</P>
<P>
In response to the UNESCO report, local scholars and
environmentalists urged the government Thursday to address the
problems and adopt effective measures to safeguard coral reefs. They
also urged the government to revise its economy-oriented
environmental development policy and strategies.

<P>
The number of real estate shops in Taiwan
totaled 1,217 as of the end of 2004 -- the largest number in six
years -- Evertrust Rehouse Co., Ltd. reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The figure represents a 41 percent increase over the 2003 level,
statistics compiled by the company show.
</P>
<P>
A total of 378 new shops -- including 325 in northern Taipei
County -- were opened last year around the country by the leading
eight companies in the trade, double the previous year's level.
</P>
<P>
Taipei County -- Taiwan's largest county in terms of populations
-- also had the largest number of real estate shops last year,
followed by Taipei City, Kaohsiung City, Taichung City and Taoyuan
County. Some 86,000 deals were made in Taipei County alone in the
first 11 months of the year, or 23 percent of the country's total.
</P>
<P>
Evertrust Rehouse analysts attributed the marked growth to the
improved traffic infrastructure and the government's preferential
loan policy and other incentives to buyers.

Premier Yu Shyi-kun divulged for the first

resigns en masse Jan. 24.
</P>
<P>
Yu told reporters while making an inspection tour in central
Taiwan that he has been at his current post for three years.
</P>
<P>
"It's long enough for me. I will be very pleased when somebody
takes over my job in the upcoming Cabinet reshuffle. I want to take a

STATE-OWNED ENTERPRISES REVIEWING NAME-CHANGE PLAN: OFFICIAL
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Jan.  14 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Vice Minister of Economic Affairs Chen
Ruey-long said Friday that state-owned enterprises are currently
reviewing the plan to change designations to avoid confusion with
mainland China, but no assessments have yet been received from
companies overseen by the ministry.
</P>
<P>
Chen said he doesn't think that changing the names of the Chinese
Petroleum Corp. (CPC) and the China Shipbuilding Corp. (CSBC) will
negatively affect their operations.
</P>
<P>
Chen was responding to media reports that said the Executive Yuan
had asked the CPC and the CSBC to submit their name-change plan by
the end of January and implement the changes by the end of June.
</P>
<P>
"If the Executive Yuan sets a deadline for the enterprises to
complete the name changes, the Ministry of Economic Affairs will meet
it," Chen said.
</P>
<P>
President Chen Shui-bian first broached the idea of changing the
names of overseas missions and state-owned enterprises in the run-up
to the Dec. 11 legislative elections. The idea is to drop the words
"China, " " Chinese" or "Chunghwa" (Chinese) to underscore Taiwan's
identity and avoid confusion with mainland China.
</P>
<P>
Premier Yu Shui-kun said recently that the name-change idea is
still being actively pursued, with the CPC, the CSBC, Chunghwa
Telecom, the International Commercial Bank of China, Chunghwa Post,
and the Central Trust of China being the top priorities.
</P>
<P>
"It is necessary to make a name-change of state-owned
enterprises, " the vice economic affairs minister said, adding that
the CPC and the CSBC are now working on the matter, hoping to find
the best way to mitigate the impact on their operations.
</P>
<P>
"As the two companies have yet to submit their reports to the
ministry, I have no way of predicting the actual expenses, but as
long as the name changes are helpful to future operations, the
expense will be bearable, " he said.
</P>
<P>
Asked whether the name changes will cause losses to hard-earned
reputations and brand competitive edges, Chen said the CPC is mainly
geared toward the domestic market, and its cooperation with foreign
companies in exploration will not be affected by the name change.
</P>
<P>
The exports of oil products will hinge on quality and price, Chen
added.
</P>
<P>
The technology and the quality of the CSBC have also won
recognition, Chen said, and its operations have been good in recent
years with customers lining up to place orders, he said.
</P>
<P>
"The Ministry of Economic Affairs is confident that the
operations of the CSBC will not be affected by the name change," Chen
said.

OVER 70 PERCENT OF TAIWAN PEOPLE AGAINST TEACHERS GOING ON STRIKE
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Jan.  14 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
More than 70 percent of Taiwan people,
including teachers, think teachers should not be able to go on strike
and are against legislation that would allow them to do so, the
results of an opinion poll conducted recently by the Ministry of
Education showed Friday.
</P>
<P>
Less than 10 percent of Taiwan people agreed that teachers should
be thought of as belonging to "labor groups, " which would be
entitled to establish their own union, the poll conducted several
weeks ago found.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Education polled ordinary adult citizens by
telephone who were chosen randomly islandwide Dec. 24-29 and received
2,025 valid responses. During the same period, the ministry surveyed
the country's teachers from elementary schools as well as junior high
schools via mailed questionnaires and received 1,424 valid replies.
Both groups were asked the same questions.
</P>
<P>
The poll found that 87 percent of the public and 78 percent of
teachers surveyed agreed that existing teachers' groups as being
transformed into professional academic associations that are devoted
to upgrading Taiwan's education and improving teaching quality.
</P>
<P>
A total of 76.8 percent of the public do not agree that teachers
should be allowed to go on strike or suspend their teaching work en
masse, compared with 46.6 percent of the teachers who also were
disinclined to allow teachers to strike. About 32 percent of the
teachers responding agreed with the strike notion.
</P>
<P>
Only 8.2 percent of the public and 5.8 percent of the teachers
agreed that teachers' groups ought to be classified as "labor groups"
instead of "professional groups."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the poll found that more than 90 percent of the
respondents think that teachers should be under regular professional
monitoring and assessment.
</P>
<P>
About 60 percent said that school authorities or educational
supervisory bodies have been "too lenient" toward teaching staff who
have either abused their rights as teachers or who have been teaching
improperly, the poll found.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Education conducted the poll prior to the
Legislative Yuan debate over a draft bill that includes an article
allowing teachers to form their own labor unions.

National Cheng Kung
University's (NCKU) IMBA school has given two Indonesian students
full scholarships as part of tsunami relief efforts.
</P>
<P>
Ely Susanto and Sun Kuang-hsiung (Badri) were each awarded the
scholarships by the NCKU Institute of Business Management, enabling
them to continue their graduate studies free of charge, plus have the
opportunity to work at the university to earn a monthly allowance.
</P>
<P>
A relief drive for the two was begun Jan. 11 and originally only
solicited donations of clothing or other daily necessities.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, NCKU students and teaching staff responded to the
activity so overwhelmingly that thousands of articles of clothing and
other items were donated - far more than the two could use.
</P>
<P>
NCKU authorities then decided to transport the donated goods to
the Indonesian province of Aceh, one of the closest population
centers to the Dec. 26 magnitude 9.0 earthquake's epicenter. The

BILL PUSHED TO ALLOW INDIVIDUALS TO POSSESS LAND OWNED BY GODS

<P>
Looking to buy that prime piece of real
estate in Taiwan? Better check first that it has not already been
"deeded" to one of the many gods revered by Chinese.
</P>
<P>
Many lands around Taiwan, particularly off main streets and
roads, are "owned" by gods and goddesses, including the god of the
land, Emperor Guan Yu and Matsu, Goddess of Sea. After a long history
of religious freedom in Taiwan since the island was under the
Japanese colonial rules before 1945, Buddhist or other religion
followers around Taiwan during the Japanese-occupied era tended to
get together annually for ceremonies to worship their gods and bought
property where the god icons were located and registered the lands
under the ownership of "god societies."
</P>
<P>
Since "god societies" are not institutions or owned by anybody,
the shrines as well as the surrounding lands were disowned, at least
legally, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
Officials from the Department of Land Administration under the
Ministry of the Interior said Friday that such issues can be solved
if the cadaster streamlining draft bill is passed into law by the
Legislative Yuan.
</P>
<P>
The cadaster streamlining draft bill, authored by the land
administration department, stipulates that institutional
organizations established by religious followers or a group of
individual followers who have been taking care of the gods and their
shrines can claim ownership of the land where the icons are located.
</P>
<P>
If the draft bill is passed into law, institutional groups or
follower groups who have been taking care of the icons can apply to
claim ownership, the officials said.

KMT, PFP COOPERATION ON LEGISLATIVE LEADERSHIP ELECTION ON HOLD
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei, Jan. 14 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Cooperation between the "pan-blue alliance"
of the Kuomintang (KMT) and the People First Party (PFP) on the
election of the speaker and vice speaker of the Legislative Yuan and
other issues will only be finalized after a meeting between the
leaders of the two parties, a KMT official said Friday.
</P>
<P>
KMT Legislator and Executive Director of the KMT Policy Committee
Tseng Yung-chuan made the remarks amid media reports that the KMT has
reversed its original plan of a "KMT-KMT" ticket to a "KMT-PFP"
ticket in the legislative leadership election on Feb. 1, and that PFP
legislators will conduct a straw poll to choose a candidate for the
vice speakership.
</P>
<P>
Reports said that although the ruling Democratic Progressive
Party (DPP) is actively courting the PFP, and has reportedly sounded
out the possibility of cooperation in various major posts, including
Cabinet positions and the legislative leadership, most PFP
legislators have reservations over the cooperation of the two
parties, given that they are at opposite ends of the political
spectrum with the PFP being pro-unification and the DPP
pro-independence.
</P>
<P>
The suggestion of DPP-PFP cooperation is only still alive because
the United States wants PFP Chairman James Soong to get involved in
cross-strait affairs, the reports also said.
</P>
<P>
Tseng said that the KMT will throw its full support behind
current Legislative Speaker Wang Jin-pyng for re-election, but has
yet to decide who to support for vice speaker.
</P>
<P>
"Everything will have to wait until a meeting between KMT
Chairman Lien Chan and Soong for a final determination to be made, "
Tseng added. Soong is currently on a visit in the United States.
</P>
<P>
Asked about a reported KMT-PFP ticket for the legislative
leadership, Wang said that he was not aware of the KMT and the PFP
talking on the issue, but did say that media reports could have some
"reference value."
</P>
<P>
Regarding which PFP legislator would be most suitable to serve as
vice speaker, the incumbent speaker said that "as long as he or she
is a candidate recommended jointly by the KMT and the PFP, that
person will be the best choice."
</P>
<P>
Asked about the fate of the current vice speaker, Chiang
Ping-kun, like Wang, a KMT vice chairman, Wang said that he is sure
the KMT will make an "overall consideration."
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, Liu Wen-hsiung, PFP caucus whip in the
legislature, said that the jury is still out on the reported KMT-PFP
ticket, saying that the PFP caucus will meet next Monday to decide on
the mechanism of electing the leadership of the legislature.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a DPP legislator said that whether DPP-PFP cooperation
can get off the ground will depend on Soong.
</P>
<P>
Tsai Huang-liang, DPP caucus whip in the legislature, was
responding to other DPP legislators' questions about the progress of
DPP-PFP cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Tsai said that what other PFP legislators say is irrelevant and
only Soong can make the "right historic decision " for the sake of
political stability.
</P>
<P>
Relations between the KMT and the PFP soured after the Dec. 11
legislative elections despite the alliance maintaining a majority in
the 225-seat legislature, with the KMT garnering 79 seats, and the
PFP 34 seats. The KMT added 11 seats, but mostly came at the expense
of the PFP, which lost 12 seats.
</P>
<P>
The PFP was miffed because the KMT's "voter-allocation "
mechanism failed to include the PFP legislative candidates and
because it was displeased about the distribution of election
subsidies over the "Lien-Soong" ticket in the 2004 presidential
election.

President Chen Shui-bian and Malawi
President Bingu Wa Mutharika signed a joint communique Friday
reaffirming their commitment to further promoting bilateral
cooperation in various fields.
</P>

Chen and Mutharika expressed their sympathy for all those who
were affected by the devastating Dec. 26 earthquake and subsequent
tsunami in a dozen Asian and African countries around the Indian
Ocean.
</P>
<P>
The two presidents also said in their joint communique that all
countries around the world should resolve their disputes through
dialogue based on the principles of sovereignty, independence and
equality. They also called on world leaders to work for democracy,
rule of law, human rights and global peace.
</P>

LUNAR NEW YEAR CHARTER FLIGHTS PRELUDE CROSS-STRAIT LINKS: ANALYSIS
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Jan. 14 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Charter flights for mainland-based Taiwan
businessmen during the upcoming Lunar New Year holiday will be a
prelude to direct transport links across the Taiwan Strait, according
to an analysis by the international ratings agency Standard and
Poor's (SP).
</P>
<P>
SP predicted that the special services will presage the opening
of direct transport links between Taiwan and mainland China should
the two sides reach agreement on the issue.
</P>
<P>
According to SP, there is little possibility of armed conflict
across the strait and the most likely outcome in the region is
"continued peace" despite rising tension between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
"Tighter economic links will continue to provide incentives to
leaders on both sides to avoid any destabilizing military moves,
while the very nature of deepening economic ties provides China with
a newer, more subtle lever to influence Taiwan politics," it said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, representatives from Taiwan and the mainland were
slated to meet again Saturday in Macau to iron out technical issues
related to the special charter services for homecoming Taiwan
businessmen from the mainland during the holiday period in early
February.
</P>
<P>
Share prices of aviation companies such as China Airlines, EVA
Airways Corp. and Far East Air Transport Corp. surged Friday on the
Taiwan Stock Exchange on the back of the new development.
</P>
<P>
Market watchers said the charter services issue will provide
short-term leads for the market, but warned that this does not
guarantee profits over the long term, because the entry of mainland
carriers on cross-strait routes will not be overwhelmingly profitable
for Taiwan competitors.

FORMOSA PLASTICS ANNOUNCES BUILDING OF 1ST 12-INCH WAFER PLANT
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei, Jan. 14 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Formosa Plastics Corp. announced
Friday that Formosa Komatsu Silicon Corp. will invest NT$7 billion
(US$220 million) in its industrial park in Mailiao, Yunlin County, to
build the nation's first 12-inch silicon wafer plant.
</P>
<P>
Officials of the FPC, which holds a 24 percent share of Formosa
Komatsu Silicon Corp., said the plant will produce 50,000 wafers per
month in the initial stage, eventually increasing production to
100,000 wafers per month.
</P>
<P>
The production will supply the needs of Taiwan Semiconductor
Manufacturing Co., United Microelectronics Corp. and other
semiconductor manufacturers in Taiwan, as well as companies in
mainland China, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
"In the future, the production capacity will continue to expand
depending on the needs of the market," the officials added.
</P>
<P>
They noted that Formosa Komatsu Silicon Corp. is currently the
largest eight-inch wafer producer and maintains the largest market
share in Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
The officials estimated that Taiwan's demand for 12-inch wafers
was around 100,000 units last year and they predicted that it will
increase to 300,000 units monthly by 2006, or 20 percent of the
global demand of around 1.5 million wafers per month.
</P>
<P>
They said the investment project falls into the category of a new
strategic industry, enabling it to enjoy five-year tax-free incentive
treatment, and that the industrial park also has other investment
incentives, while its water and electricity are cheaper compared with
other facilities in the same sector, making the project a highly
competitive one.

A planned visit by Vice President Annette
Lu to the Republic of China's diplomatic allies in Central America in
mid-February will be postponed for a month or two, Deputy
Presidential Secretary-General James Huang said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Lu was originally to head a delegation of local industry and
commerce executives to visit Central American allies in mid-February
to attend a regional development forum and survey the industrial
development demands in those countries to serve as reference for the
government in drafting technological cooperative programs.
</P>
<P>
Huang said Lu's travel plan has received enthusiastic response
from the ROC's Central American allies.
</P>
<P>
"Many of our allies in the region have come up with new visions
and new proposals for cooperation with Taiwan in developing their
industries and economies," Huang said.
</P>
<P>
Against this backdrop, Huang said, preparatory work has to be
adjusted. With a view to enhancing the visit's efficacy, Huang said,
the government needs more time to prepare and will invite more
suitable industrial leaders to join Lu's mission based on
Central American allies' suggestions.

Huang said Lu's trip will be conducted at some point in the first

ECONOMICS MINISTRY CALLS FOR PRIVATE PARTICIPATION IN TRADE TALKS
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>

(By Y.F. Low)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Vice Minister of Economic Affairs Chen
Ruey-long urged the private sector Friday to take a positive part in
government-led international trade talks.
</P>
<P>
While the opinions of commercial and industrial groups and
non-governmental organizations (NGOs) have proved influential in the
progress of World Trade Organization (WTO) talks, the government also
needs the support of the commercial and industrial sectors when
negotiating on free trade agreements with other countries, Chen said.
</P>
<P>
Chen made the remarks while addressing the opening of a seminar
on the role of commercial and industrial organizations in
international trade and economic affairs.
</P>
<P>
Representatives of foreign business groups including the American
Chamber of Commerce, the British Chamber of Commerce and the
Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry were invited to the event
to share their experience in taking part in international trade talks
with members of the local business community.
</P>
<P>
Local groups attending the seminar included the Chinese National
Federation of Industries, the General Chamber of Commerce of the ROC
and the National Association of Small- and Medium-Sized Enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Chen pointed out that the importance of participation by
commercial and industrial organizations and NGOs has been shown in
the development of the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC)
forum, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development
(OECD) and the WTO.
</P>
<P>
For example, Chen said, anti-globalization demonstrations were
staged by NGOs during the 1999 WTO ministerial meeting in Seattle and
the 2003 meeting in Cancun, which successfully postponed the WTO
timetable for globalization.
</P>
<P>
In the past, businessmen in Taiwan have generally thought that
international trade talks are the government's business and have
seldom participated in such talks, Chen noted.
</P>
<P>
However, Chen went on, the participation of the business
community is very important to ensure that international trade
regulations and measures adopted by the government are practicable.

TAIWAN'S 1ST INTERNATIONAL-LEVEL CRASH TEST LAB INAUGURATED
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Jan.  14 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The first international-level car crash
test lab in Taiwan and Southeast Asia was officially inaugurated
Friday in Changhua, central Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Premier Yu Shyi-kun presided over the inauguration ceremony of
the lab, set up by the Automotive Research and Training Center (ARTC)
. Also present were Minister of Economic Affairs Ho Mei-yueh, Kenneth
K.T. Yen, chairman of the Taiwan Transportation Vehicle Manufacturers
Association and Lin Hsin-i, chairman of the Industrial Technology
Research Institute.
</P>
<P>
Yu noted that if Taiwan wants to compete with other countries, it
must upgrade its industry by making up for its deficiency in research
and development, as well as marketing. He added that the inauguration
of the crash test lab marks a giant step forward in the nation's
automotive industry.
</P>
<P>
Ho, noting that Taiwan has a big opportunity of development in
the Asian automotive industry, expressed the hope that with the
inauguration of the lab, Taiwan will not only develop car parts and
components but complete cars and make inroads into the OEM market, as
well as integrate the steel, machinery and module sectors related to
the automotive industry.
</P>
<P>
ARTC Chairman Wu Hai admitted that the setup of the lab is a
little late compared to American and European counterparts, but said
Taiwan has had many technology exchanges with laboratories in
America, Europe and Japan during its establishment period and has
invited foreign collision experts to Taiwan for their onsite
guidance.
</P>
<P>
The ARTC will pursue test standard comparisons with overseas
laboratories of the same nature and will seek mutual certification
with other countries, he said.
</P>
<P>
Yu then witnessed the first crash test in the lab and was briefed
by the ARTC staff.
</P>
<P>
The ARTC, established by the Ministry of Economic Affairs in
accordance with the Automotive Industry Development Policy in October
1990, aims at assisting the development and upgrading of automobile
and related industries, as well as protection of driving safety and
consumer rights by offering internationally credible services of
inspection and testing of cars and related components and parts.

TAIWAN DIVORCE RATE REACHES RECORD HIGH IN 2004: COUNSELOR
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei, Jan. 14 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A spokesman for a private organization
dedicated to helping broken families claimed Friday that "one out of
every 2.09 local married couples" divorced in 2004, an all-time high
in Taiwan's history.
</P>
<P>
Liu Ko-ming, chief executive of the Taiwan True Love Family
Association, quoted statistics compiled by the Ministry of the
Interior (MOI) as saying that 131,453 couples married in 2004, while
62,796 couples divorced.

</P>
<P>
"The figures mean that one out of every 2.09 married couples
ended up in divorce or that 172 couples divorced each day last year,"
Liu claimed, although as he made no mention of the actual number of
married couples in Taiwan during the period, it was unclear as to how
he arrived at his figure.
</P>
<P>
The 2004 divorce rate was much higher than the year-earlier
level, Liu went on. In 2003, one out of every 2.66 couples divorced
for a 37.59 percent divorce rate. In 2004, according to Liu, the
divorce rate surged to 47.84 percent.
</P>
<P>
Quoting the MOI's 2003 tallies, Liu said 54 percent of local
divorced men and 17.9 percent of divorced women remarried. The
figures indicate that about 20 percent of couples who married in 2003
were divorcees, he claimed.
</P>
<P>
Noting that a high divorce rate usually means that the number of
reorganized families will increase, Liu claimed that Taiwan has the
world's fourth-largest number of reorganized families.
</P>
<P>
According to Liu, the United States ranks first in terms of the
number of reorganized families. Quoting the results of U.S. surveys,
only 40 percent of divorcees enjoy successful second marriages, while
more than half of second marriages end in divorce.
</P>
<P>
"The high failure rate indicates that maintaining a second
marriage may not be easy, " Liu said, adding that children from
previous marriages can add difficulties to reorganized families.
</P>
<P>
With a view to helping divorcees intending to marry again adapt
to their new families, Liu said his organization has decided to open
a new service center to provide counseling for members of reorganized
families.

The Legislative Yuan passed a Framework
Convention on Tobacco Control Friday ahead of the scheduled
implementation of an international convention by the World Health
Organization (WHO) that will go into force Feb. 27.
</P>
<P>
Lawmakers said the passage of the convention is a step forward in
tobacco control which signifies Taiwan is keeping pace with
international norms and standards. They claimed the move will be
favorable to the island's bid to join the WHO.
</P>
<P>
Lin Ching-li, head of the tobacco control section of the John

TAIWAN MUST BE COMPETITIVE: AMCHAM
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Jan.  14 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taiwan must crystallize its potential
competitiveness into concrete action while confronting heated
competition if it wants to prevent itself from being marginalized, an
official of the American Chamber of Commerce (AmCham) in Taipei urged
Friday.
</P>
<P>
Richard Vuylsteke, chief executive officer of AmCham in Taipei,
made the call while giving a speech in a seminar sponsored by the
Bureau of Foreign Trade (BOFT) to exchange experiences and viewpoints
on international trade with domestic and foreign trade and economic
groups.
</P>
<P>
As Taiwan moves toward becoming a mature economy, the country
must realize that it should be able to challenge strong rivals to
avoid turning into an outcast, rather than competing against weak
players, Vuylsteke advised, adding that Taiwan is doomed to fail
should it set its sights only on mediocre competitors.
</P>
<P>
Although Taiwan ranks high on world competitiveness surveys by
international ratings agencies, he said that the country must seek to
transform its potential advantages into concrete moves to maintain
sustainable growth.
</P>
<P>
Future challenges lie in the service sector, and the transitional
pain of the industrial upgrading process from a
manufacturing-intensive economy -- rising unemployment -- is an
inevitable accompanying phenomenon, he said.
</P>
<P>
The AmCham representative called for the government and
enterprises to heed the issue and urged them to craft a clear-cut
development strategy.
</P>
<P>
Citing WTO reports, he said that Taiwan should do its best to
promote service-oriented businesses in the coming 18 months on the
grounds that Taiwan lacks large-scale companies in that sector.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan has a pro-active government and its people are diligent
and outstanding, he said, expressing his belief that the country will
certainly succeed as long as both the government and the private
sector do what they need to do to make money.
</P>
<P>
As long as Taiwan stands firm to keep its economic strength and
create sound and updated law enforcement, foreign investment will
flock in, regardless of whatever mainland China or other countries
might do, he suggested.
</P>
<P>
AmCham in Taipei strongly supports Taiwan's globalization drive
and is happy to offer creative and constructive information while
seeking cooperation with local businesses, he said.

MOFA HAILS EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT RESOLUTION TO KEEP CHINA ARMS BAN
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA)
expressed a hearty welcome Friday to the latest European Parliament
resolution asking the 25-member European Union (E.U.) to keep its ban
on arms sales to mainland China.
</P>
<P>
The European Parliament, the E.U.'s legislative arm, passed a
resolution on human rights conditions in Tibet Thursday in which it
urged the European Commission -- the E.U.'s administrative body --
and all E.U. member states not to lift the ban on arms sales to the
mainland.
</P>
<P>
The resolution said the arms ban should be maintained until after
the E.U. legislates a binding code of conduct regarding arms exports
and until the mainland adopts concrete measures to improve its
domestic human rights conditions and fully respects the rights and
interests of its minority ethnic groups.
</P>
<P>
It marked the fourth time that the European Parliament has passed
a resolution to call for keeping the mainland arms sales ban. The
parliament passed similar resolutions Dec. 18, 2003, Feb. 10, 2004
and Nov. 17, 2004.
</P>
<P>
The MOFA said in a news release that it welcomes the latest
resolution and hopes that the European Commission the and E.U. member
states will respect it.
</P>
<P>
The E.U. imposed the arms sales ban after the 1989 Tiananmen
Square massacre in which a student-led pro-democracy demonstration
was crushed by military forces.

Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou will travel to
Australia Saturday to take part in the closing ceremony of the 2005
Deaf Olympics in Melbourne.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters at his office, Ma said that he will only
participate in the event Sunday and will pay a visit to Melbourne
Mayor John So the next day before flying back to Taiwan later that
same day.
</P>
<P>
Ma said he had decided to cancel planned visits to Sydney and
Bangkok, originally slated for Jan. 17 and Jan. 18-19, respectively.
</P>
<P>
The mayor's decision to shorten his visit came following news
that a four-year-old Taipei girl remained seriously ill and in a coma
over the past few days in a hospital in central Taichung County.
</P>
<P>
The girl, who had been beaten up by her drunk father, was forced
to be transferred to Taichung for treatment after many hospitals in
Taipei refused to treat her under the excuse of no available hospital
beds.
</P>
<P>
The incident aroused outrage among the public, who are furious
and blame the various municipal hospitals who were contacted by the
Emergency Operations Center for the fiasco. The head of the municipal
health bureau apologized and resigned.
</P>
<P>
Ma acknowledged that the incident has brought shame to Taipei
City, which prides itself on its medical facilities and personnel.
Meanwhile, The mayor's approval rate has dropped to 67 percent -- the
lowest level since he assumed his second four-year term in 2002.

<TEXT>
<P>
A law governing the country's intelligence
work was approved by the Legislative Yuan Friday.
</P>
<P>
The National Intelligence Work Law puts the country's secret
intelligence agencies under the supervision of the legislature and
obliges intelligence workers to stay out of politics.
</P>
<P>
Among the intelligence agencies covered by the law are the
National Security Bureau, the Military Intelligence Bureau and the
Political Warfare Bureau under the Ministry of National Defense, the
Investigation Bureau under the Ministry of Justice and the National
Police Administration under the Ministry of the Interior.

The law obliges workers of these intelligence agencies to be
politically neutral and prohibits them for working for any political
parties, political groups or candidates for public office.
</P>
<P>
They should not abuse their office to persuade others to join or
not join any political parties, should not provide aid to any
political parties, should not set up cells of any political parties
and should not spread the ideology of any political parties in their
agencies.

MAINLAND CHINA MISSES CHANCE TO ENGAGE WITH TAIWAN: OFFICIAL
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Jan. 14 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mainland China has missed a good chance to
engage with Taiwan more positively by refusing to allow Taiwan
officials to take part in talks on charter flight services between
Taiwan and the mainland during the Chinese New Year holiday, an
official from the Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) said Friday.
</P>
<P>
MAC Vice Chairman and Spokesman Chiu Tai-shan claimed that the
charter flight services, even if launched successfully, will not be
better than the similar services provided in 2003 because of the
absence of Taiwan's policy-making officials at the talks.
</P>
<P>
The mainland, which has refused contact with Taiwan since 1999
over political differences, rejected the participation of MAC
officials or officials from the Straits Exchange Foundation at the
charter flight talks poised to open in Macau Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Chiu said four Taiwan delegates, headed by Chang Kuo-cheng,
director-general of the Civil Aeronautics Administration, will take
part in the talks.
</P>
<P>
In order to bring about the charter flight services that will
allow Taiwan businessmen residing on the mainland to come directly to
Taiwan for the Chinese New Year and to return directly to the
mainland after the holiday, Chiu said the government has gone to
great lengths to accommodate Beijing's requirements about the venue
and timing of the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
He said the Taiwan authorities have show maximum flexibility
without compromising security to lure the mainland into the talks,
and has worked out several options that will provide the most
convenient flight services for the Taiwan businessmen.
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, Chiu went on, the mainland insisted on downgrading
the negotiations into business talks between air carriers from both
sides of the strait and denying the appearance of any Taiwan
officials at the talks.
</P>
<P>
However, he added, the charter flight negotiations prove that the
mainland and Taiwan can shelve their political disputes and work
together for the benefit of people on both sides of the strait.

MORE AID FOR TSUNAMI VICTIMS

<TEXT>
<P>
More than two weeks after the Dec. 26
catastrophe caused by tsunami in the Indian Ocean, donations for the
victims continues to stream into local charity groups, according to a
statement issued by the Ministry of the Interior Friday.
</P>
<P>
Citing statistics compiled by the ministry, the statement said a
total of NT$1.4 billion (US$44.4 million) has been raised by 27
charity groups that registered with the ministry to raise funds for
the victims in countries struck by the tsunami.
</P>
<P>
The ministry said these charity groups should follow the
ministry's regulations in raising and using the donations and should
present a report to the ministry after completing the fund-raising
activities and disposing of the funds.
</P>
<P>
According to the ministry's records, the three groups that have
raised the most funds are the Tzu Chi Foundation, which has raised
NT$450 million, the Red Cross Society of the Republic of China, which
has raised NT$420 million and World Vision Taiwan, which has raised
NT$250 million.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile Minister of Foreign Affairs Tan Sun Chen said the
warehouse designated by the government as the depot for relief
materials for the tsunami victims has already been filled to
capacity.
</P>
<P>
He promised that all the supplies will be transported to the
disaster regions by Jan. 28, adding that the focus of the relief
operation has now turned from urgent action to reconstruction, in
which Taiwan will play an active role.
</P>
<P>
Also Friday, the leader of a 17-member medial team that had just
returned from the tsunami-hit island of Phuket in Thailand Thursday
said his team has helped with the prevention of contagious diseases
on that island since its arrival Jan. 4.
</P>
<P>
Lin Tin, vice director-general of the Center for Disease Control
and the leader of the team, said their work has been taken over by
six Taiwan medical workers who arrived on Phuket Wednesday to replace
them.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the Thai authorities have conducted a well-organized
relief operation and that the relief teams from other countries have
some good practices that are unknown to Taiwan, Lin said the Taiwan
medical workers have learned many valuable lessons from their
experience on Phuket.
</P>
<P>
Just as Lin shared his experiences with journalists in Taipei,
around 30 medical workers in Kaohsiung were given a briefing about
Indonesia by a health expert from that country.
</P>
<P>
The medial workers, brought together by the Health Department of
the Kaohsiung city government from hospitals in the metropolitan
Kaohsiung area, are expected to head for Indonesia Jan. 28 to help
with the relief operation there.

SIGNIFICANT IMPACT EXPECTED IF TAIWAN EXCLUDED FROM ASEAN TRADE BLOC
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Jan. 15 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A significant impact is expected if Taiwan
is excluded from the free trade bloc consisting of the member stats
of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) , mainland
China, Japan and South Korea, according to an assessment made by the
Chung Hua Institution for Economic Research.
</P>
<P>
In the assessment made for the Ministry of Economic Affairs, the
institution predicts that such a trade bloc will cause a 0.98 percent
drop in Taiwan's gross domestic product (GDP) and will cut down the
volume of Taiwan's international trade by 1.14 percent, drive down
Taiwan's social welfare spending by US$4.33 billion and decrease
Taiwan's industrial output by US$6.97 billion.
</P>
<P>
The textile industry will bear the brunt of the impact, suffering
losses of US$1.95 billion, followed by the plastic and chemical
industry, which will lose US$940 million and the electronics
industry, which will lose US$710 million.
</P>
<P>
It will lead to a decrease of US$2.36 billion in the country's
exports, including US$1.46 billion in the textile industry and
US$630 million in the electronics industry.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the assessment is made according to 1997 data, which
are the latest figures available, the institution said it has allowed
for some margin of error but will not be far from the actual figures.
</P>
<P>
The impact would be much less if the ASEAN-centered trade bloc
were to include only ASEAN states and the mainland, according to the
assessment.
</P>
<P>
The institution predicts that in this scenario, Taiwan's GDP will
be cut by 0.2 percent, international trade by 0.19 percent and social
welfare spending by US$790 million.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan's combined industrial output will plunge by US$1.4
billion, with the textile industry suffering the most, losing US$325
million. Exports will shrink by US$446 million, with the electronics
industry suffering the most, losing US$259 million. Employment will
also suffer, with 14,154 jobs lost, mainly in the semiconductor
industry, textiles and wholesale.
</P>
<P>
If the ASEAN trade bloc includes no countries other than its
member states, the impact on Taiwan would be insignificant, according
to the assessment.
</P>
<P>
It predicts that in such a case, the GDP will decrease by 0.1
percent, international trade by 0.08 percent, social welfare spending
by US$360 million and industrial output by US$720 million, with the
electronics industry bearing the brunt, giving up US$243 million, and
a decrease of US$234 million in exports.

DPP REAFFIRMS INTENTION OF COOPERATING WITH PFP
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Jan. 15 (CNA)
(By Y.F. Low)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Acting ruling Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) Chairman Ker Chien-ming reaffirmed Saturday his party's
intention to cooperate with the opposition People First Party (PFP)
for the sake of political stability.
</P>
<P>
Ker said, however, that it is not suitable to disclose details of
the cooperation plan between the two parties and that the situation
will become clearer after PFP Chairman James Soong returns from the
United States.
</P>
<P>
Addressing local media speculation that Kaohsiung Mayor Frank
Hsieh will be appointed the next premier, while Soong will head the
Committee for Cross-Strait Peace and Development, Ker said these are
mere wild guesses and that it is still premature to speculate on the
new Cabinet lineup.
</P>
<P>
The current Cabinet led by Premier Yu Shyi-kun is set to resign
Jan. 24 in preparation for a reshuffle in line with the formation of
a new legislature Feb. 1.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, PFP legislative caucus convener Liu Wen-hsiung said
Soong will never accept an offer for him to head the Committee for
Cross-Strait Peace and Development.
</P>
<P>
Although Soong has always been concerned about cross-Taiwan
Strait issues, he can contribute his part as PFP chairman and does
not need to become the head of the committee, Liu said.
</P>
<P>
Dismissing the media speculation as unfounded, Liu said the PFP
has never received any information about any of its members being
recruited to join the new Cabinet.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated that it is the PFP's policy to defend the Republic
of China and oppose independence for Taiwan, and that it will not
cooperate with other parties in exchange for power and position.

DPP MUST STAY WITH PEOPLE, STRENGTHEN POLITICAL STATEMENT: OFFICIAL
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Jan.  15 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The ruling Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) must keep in touch with the grassroots and strengthen its
political statement with "grand prospects that will touch the hearts
of the people," a DPP official said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
DPP Secretary-General Chang Chun-hsiung made the remarks when he
attended a two-day policy seminar for DPP legislators-elect that
opened that day.

</P>
<P>
In addition to Chang, President Chen Shui-bian, Vice President
Annette Lu, Premier Yu Shyi-kun, Presidential Office
Secretary-General Su Tseng-chang and Kaohsiung Mayor Frank Hsieh
either spoke or attended the group meetings at the seminar,
underscoring the importance the DPP attaches to the seminar.
</P>
<P>
Chang noted that in the Dec. 11 legislative elections, the DPP
fared worse than expected, garnering only 89 of the 225 seats.
Although it is still the largest party in the Legislative Yuan, it
cannot form a stable majority with its ally, the Taiwan Solidarity
Union.
</P>
<P>
The DPP failed because it is not fully in touch with the people,
Chang said, noting that although the public has grown tired of the
endless petty bickering and rivalry between the parties, it has not
translated into solid support for his party.
</P>
<P>
The turnout rate for the legislative elections was just 59.16
percent, 6 percent down compared with the previous legislative
election turnout. In a breakdown, votes for the opposition Kuomintang
were down by more than 8,000 from the previous election, ballots for
the TSU were down by 40,000 votes and those for the People First
Party were down by 560,000 votes. In comparison, the votes for the
DPP increased by 2.34 percent, or more than 20,000 ballots more than
in the previous legislative elections.
</P>
<P>
This shows that although the people are apathetic to politics,
they have nevertheless been positive in some degree to the DPP,
according to Chang.
</P>
<P>
He urged the newly elected legislators to "listen to the voice of
the people." As legislators of the ruling party, they should always
be humble and broad-minded to help bring about reconciliation of the
polarized ethnic groups and various parties.
</P>
<P>
He also stated that "if there is no cooperation, there will be no
future, no stability and no harmony for Taiwan."
</P>
<P>
Ker Chien-ming, acting DPP chairman, also spoke to the
legislators-elect about the operations of the legislature.
He will serve his fifth term in the new legislature
that will be sworn in Feb. 1.
</P>
<P>
Ker, a dentist-turned-politician, also expressed the hope that
the new legislators will find their own roles to play and ways to
survive so that they can contribute to the DPP team.

Democratic Progressive Party's (DPP's) promotion of inter-party
cooperation, a party official said Saturday during a two-day seminar
for the orientation of the DPP's legislators-elect.
</P>
<P>
DPP Secretary-General Chang Chun-hsiung was responding to media
speculation that Kaohsiung Mayor Frank Hsieh is set to form a new
Cabinet, while James Soong, chairman of the opposition People First
Party (PFP), will serve as the chairman of a proposed committee for 
cross-strait peace and development under the Presidential Office.
</P>
<P>
To promote a DPP-PFP reconciliation, the DPP will also reserve at
least two Cabinet-level posts for the PFP, the reports also claimed.
</P>
<P>
Chang refused to comment on the speculation, saying that he would
respect President Chen Shui-bian's right to nominate a premier and
the new premier's right to form the Cabinet.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the DPP will pull out all the stops in promoting
inter-party cooperation in the wake of the Dec. 11 legislative
elections in which the DPP failed to reach its goal of forming a
stable majority with its ally, the Taiwan Solidarity Union.
</P>
<P>
The DPP is hoping to cooperate with the PFP and other political
parties to promote harmony between the legislature and the Cabinet.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Hsieh also dismissed the media speculation, pointing
out only that the media makes groundless speculation about possible
candidates every day and prints it as "news."
</P>
<P>
He also said he is one possible candidate among "perhaps 100"
that the president is mulling.
</P>
<P>
On whether the decision on the premiership could be linked to
Soong with some reports claiming that the DPP could offer him the
post to show its sincerity in pursuing inter-party reconciliation,
Hsieh said only that the political situation changes every minute.
</P>
<P>
He said that there are still a lot of bills pending in the
legislature, and the legislature is yet to confirm the members of the
Control Yuan, the nation's highest watchdog body, nominated by the 
President. There are still "uncertainties," and President Chen is
yet to decide on the new premier, he added.
</P>
<P>
The Cabinet will resign Jan. 24 to make way for the new Cabinet
that will be formed after the new legislature is sworn in Feb. 1.

TAIPEI, BEIJING OPTIMISTIC ABOUT CROSS-STRAIT CHARTER FLIGHT TALKS

<P>
Representatives from both sides of the
Taiwan Strait in negotiations on cross-strait charter flights during
Chinese New Year holiday said Saturday they were optimistic about the
talks and expressed hope that an agreement can be reached quickly.
</P>
<P>
Pu Zhaozhou, Beijing's representative and executive director of
the China Civil Aviation Association, said that both sides have so
far displayed sincerity in bringing about the launch of the charter
flight services.
</P>
<P>
He shied away from saying whether the talks will adopt the model
of Taiwan-Hong Kong aviation agreement negotiations in 2002 in which
Taipei Airlines Association (TAA) President Michael Lo headed a
Taipei delegation made up of officials of the Mainland Affairs
Council and the Ministry of Transportation and Communications (MOTC),
who came as TAA advisers to work behind the scenes to realize the
signing of the agreement.
</P>
<P>
" Any model that will solve problems will be good model," Pu
said.
</P>
<P>
Taipei's representative, Billy K.C. Chang, director-general of
the Civil Aeronautics Administration, said there should be no hitches
in the talks and that he hoped to "have a result in the shortest
possible time."
</P>
<P>
Chang, who was attending the talks in his capacity as a TAA
adviser, said the talks will mainly be to confirm the multiple flight
destinations and the licensing of the flight routes, and will be
confined to the holiday charter flights.
</P>
<P>
Both sides of the Taiwan Strait have set the principles of
"joint-participation, multiple-destination, and non-stop" charter
flights for the holiday period.
</P>
<P>
Also on Taipei's delegation were Fang Chi-wen, an official of the
MOTC's Department of Navigation and Aviation, TAA head Lo and TAA
Secretary-General Su Hsien-jung.

1,000 MOUNTAIN GUARDIANS TO START SERVICE MAY 20: VICE PRESIDENT
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
A team of 1,000 mountain guardians
currently undergoing training are set to start service May 20 to help
with rescue operations and ecological conservation in mountainous
areas, Vice President Annette Lu said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Of the 1,000 trainees, 500 are doing alternative military
service, while the other 500 are residents of mountainous aboriginal
communities, according to Lu.
</P>
<P>
The mountain guardians are expected to improve the government's
response to natural disasters such as flooding and mudflows triggered
by typhoons, Lu said.
</P>
<P>
In light of the fact that up to three-quarters of Taiwan are
mountainous, Lu proposed that the country's administrative regions be
re-mapped to set up a special mountainous administrative region
directly under the control of the central government.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, she reaffirmed the government's plan to draw on its
success in developing science-based industrial parks to help its
diplomatic allies in Central America set up similar facilities.
</P>
<P>
Lu made the remarks while giving a keynote speech at a luncheon
with legislators-elect of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party.
</P>
<P>
In response to questions from the press on the candidate for the
next premier, Lu said President Chen Shui-bian is carefully
considering the new Cabinet lineup and is accepting public
suggestions on personnel arrangements.
</P>
<P>
The local media has speculated that Kaohsiung Mayor Frank Hsieh
might replace Yu Shyi-kun as the next premier.

LUNAR NEW YEAR CHARTER SERVICES HELP BREAK TABOO: AVIATION COMPANY
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Jan.  15 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The realization of charter flights for
mainland China-based Taiwan businessmen wishing to spend the coming
Lunar New Year holiday at home will help break political taboos
between the two sides and have a far-reaching impact on bilateral
ties, a source from the domestic aviation industry said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Should representatives from Taiwan and the mainland succeed in
reaching a final agreement over the issue, it will help break
longstanding political taboos between the two sides, the sources
said, adding that the charter flight services planned for the Chinese
New Year holiday are much more complex than the previous such flights
in 2003, when six Taiwan carriers were involved.
</P>
<P>
The charter services failed to take off in 2004 due to mainland
China's refusal to negotiate its demand that mainland carriers also
be allowed to take part in the services.
</P>
<P>
If carriers from both sides can conduct the special charter
services negotiations this time under the "non-stop,
round-trip,multi-destinations" principle as the mainland has insisted
upon, it will be a significant breakthrough in cross-strait ties,
they claimed.
</P>
<P>
However, they were reserved about the expected success of the
charter flight services, although representatives from Taiwan and the
mainland were holding technical talks over the issue in Macau with
only about 20 days left until the Feb. 9 Chinese New Year.
</P>
<P>
With the holidays so close, many Taiwan businessmen and their
families have already booked tickets for their homecoming and return
trips during the festival season through regular channels, making it
unlikely that there will be much demand for the highly-touted
flights.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Joseph Wu, chairman of the Cabinet-level Mainland
Affairs Council (MAC), told the Voice of Germany radio a day earlier
in an exclusive interview that Taiwan and the mainland have agreed
upon the model for the flights.
</P>
<P>
In an attempt to douse the concern of many international observers
who are skeptical of the possibility of the charter flights, Wu
claimed that those who bet on the issue are sure to win.
</P>
<P>
In a meeting with a visiting group of U.S.
congressional assistants, Wu said Taiwan will
continue to push for opening direct cargo service across the Taiwan
Strait and hold talks over economic issues such as the establishment
of a currency settlement and an investment guarantee pact, with the
mainland.
</P>
<P>
The top mainland policy planner said Taiwan is willing to work
out a framework under which the two sides can interact and conduct
exchanges before peace is eventually built across the strait.
</P>
<P>
According to Lin Ling-san, minister of transportation and
communication, many cross-strait technical matters need to be
resolved through negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Touching on a request by Taichung Mayor Jason Hu and Taichung
Magistrate Lin Chung-sheng that Chinchuankang (CCK) Airport also be
included in the charter plan, Lin made it clear that the facility
will not be part of the services on the grounds that it is also a
military airport.
</P>
<P>
When talking about adding more destinations to the service,
passenger numbers must also be considered, he said, noting that for
the time being, Taiwan has agreed in principle to open Taipei and
Kaohsiung for the charter services, connecting with the mainland
cities of Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou.

Negotiators from Taiwan and mainland China
reached an agreement in Macau Saturday to launch special charter
flights from Jan. 29 to Feb. 20 to carry mainland-based Taiwanese
businessmen and their families home for the Lunar New Year holiday.
</P>
<P>
The services will be jointly operated by six air carriers from
each side between Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou on the mainland and
Taipei and Kaohsiung in Taiwan, according to the agreement.
</P>
<P>
The details of the agreement were jointly announced after the
first stage of the negotiations by China Civil Aviation Association
Executive Director Pu Zhaozhou and Taipei Airlines Association
President Michael Lo, the leading negotiators representing the two
sides.
</P>
<P>
Pu described the atmosphere of the talks as "peaceful and highly
efficient."
</P>
<P>
He said air carriers from Taiwan and the mainland will each
operate 24 round-trip flights during the period and that both sides
have reached consensus on details concerning the licensing and
qualifications of flight crew.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Lo said, the two sides agreed that the charter planes
will not be required to land in a third area en route but will have
to fly in a detour over Hong Kong's aviation zone.
</P>
<P>
Negotiators from both sides are engaging in another round of
talks on other technical details.

SEMINAR ON SOUTHEAST ASIAN CULTURE HELD IN KAOHSIUNG
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  Jan.  15 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A seminar on Southeast Asian culture was
held in Fengshan, Kaohsiung County Saturday to deepen local people's
understanding of the people of the region.
</P>
<P>
A worker from the Eden Social Welfare Foundation, which organized
the forum, noted that Taiwanese need to know more about Southeast
Asia in light of the fact that more and more Taiwanese are marrying
women from the region and that the children growing up in
cross-cultural marriages pose special challenges for schoolteachers.
</P>
<P>
Wu Hui-ling, an Indonesian woman who married a man from Tungkang,
Pingtung County five years ago, told the forum that she used to live
with her sister-in-law in Tungkang until differences with her
sister-in-law about how to educate her only daughter forced her and
her husband to move to Kaohsiung six months ago.
</P>
<P>
Wu said she had studied at an Indonesia university for two years
before marrying and moving to Taiwan but said she had difficulty
accustoming herself to Taiwan culture, which is quite different to
that of her homeland.
</P>
<P>
The differences are especially pronounced when it comes to
children's education, she said, noting that her Indonesian cultural
background predisposes her to be tougher with her child, which led to
interfering by her sister-in-law, who spoils her children.
</P>
<P>
Wu's daughter, who was brought to the forum by her mother, can
recite the multiplication table and the Three-Character Book, an
ancient Chinese book for small children, which is a remarkable
achievement for a four-year-old.
</P>
<P>
Wu complained that in Tungkang, many foreign women married to
Taiwanese are forbidden by their Taiwanese in-laws to attend literary
classes or enroll in adult education programs.
</P>
<P>
Kindergarten teacher Ke Chin-mei said a five-year-old boy in her
kindergarten has difficulty speaking with his classmates because his
Vietnamese mother can speak only a little Mandarin and Taiwanese.
</P>
<P>
Tseng Hung-chih, president of the Haiko Community Development
Association, warned that a large number of children raised by foreign
wives will begin to enter junior high school next year, when their
difficulty in assimilating into local society will be brought to
light more vividly.

CHARTER FLIGHTS HELP EASE CROSS-STRAIT TENSIONS: PRESIDENTIAL ADVISOR

<TEXT>
<P>
A Presidential Office advisor said Saturday
that the agreement reached between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait
on charter flights during the Chinese New Year holiday will
contribute to the easing of the strained cross-strait situation.
</P>
<P>
Byron S.J. Weng, who is also a professor at National Chi Nan
University, noted that the two sides of the Taiwan Strait have had no
direct contact with each other since the meeting between the two top
negotiators -- Koo Chen-fu, the late chairman of Taipei's Straits
Exchange Foundation and his counterpart Wang Daohan, chairman of the
Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait -- in Shanghai in
1998.
</P>
<P>
Cross-strait relations soured after former President Lee Teng-hui
described the situation between the two sides as a "special
state-to-state relationship" in 1999.
</P>
<P>
Although the consultation between the two sides on Saturday
in Macau was about charter flights during the Chinese New Year, Weng 
claimed that it was a "major breakthrough" in cross-strait
relations.
</P>
<P>
Aviation representatives from Taipei and Beijing reached an
agreement that six air carriers each from both sides will engage in
24 charter flights each between Beijing/Shanghai/Guangzhou and
Taipei/Kaohsiung between Jan. 29 and Feb. 20.

The Taiwan High Speed Rail (THSR) will be
inaugurated on schedule in October, according to THSR Bureau Director
Ho Hsuan-hsuan.
</P>
<P>
Ho made the remark Friday while braving the rain to examine a
THSR construction site in Yangmei Township in the northern county of
Taoyuan. So far, a total of 22 official examinations of the high
speed railway have been carried out to ensure that it will be safe,
Ho said.
</P>
<P>
Fifty-four percent of the overall construction and 99.69 percent
of civil engineering projects have been completed, Ho went on, adding
that although it is a bit behind schedule, the lag has been brought
under control.
</P>
<P>
The 345-km, high-speed railway linking Taipei in the north and
Kaohsiung in the south is Taiwan's first infrastructure project built
under a build-operate-transfer (BOT) formula. At the cost of US$16.06
billion, the railway is designed to accommodate train speeds of up to
300 kilometers per hour, and the direct service between Taipei and
Kaohsiung will take only 80 minutes.

GOVERNMENT ENCOURAGES TAIWAN PARENTS TO HAVE MORE CHILDREN
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Jan.  15 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taiwan's falling birth rate is provoking
grave concern in the government, which has been working on measures
to encourage parents to have more children.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a recent public hearing jointly organized by
representatives from the government and the private sector, attendees
unanimously called on the government to build a favorable and healthy
environment to make the younger generation willing to have more
children.
</P>
<P>
To achieve that goal, the government should do its utmost to take
pressure off people's lives by creating more jobs, stepping up the
rule of law and providing better day-care and education for children,
they said.
</P>
<P>
Chien Tai-lang, vice minister of the interior, said that the
government is gravely concerned about negative growth in Taiwan's
population, estimated to start by around 2022.
</P>
<P>
In an effort to help reverse the trend, the Ministry of the
Interior will organize public hearings around the country to gauge
public opinion to use as references in a "white paper" on
countermeasures to be published in March, Chien said, adding that
persuading parents to have more children is also a responsibility and
a set policy of the government.
</P>
<P>
Citing academic studies, Chien reported that the number of
citizens aged over 65 will account for 39 percent of Taiwan's total
population by 2051 if the country's birth rate continues at the
current low level. "By that time, all you will see in the streets are
silver-haired old men and women," he said.

</P>
<P>
Statistics compiled by the Interior Ministry show that Taiwan's
birth rate is one of the world's lowest. In 2003, Taiwan parents gave
birth to an average of 1.24 newborns. The average in Italy and Sweden
was 1.2 and 1.5, respectively, for the same year, while France and
the United States recorded 1.9 and 2, respectively.

CROSS-STRAIT CHARTER FLIGHTS HISTORICALLY SIGNIFICANT: ACADEMIC
</HEADLINE>

(By Stanley Cheung and Y.F. Low)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The latest agreement between Taiwan and
mainland China on the launch of special Lunar New Year charter
flights this year will make possible the first legal landing in
Taiwan by a mainland civilian plane in more than 50 years, which will
be a historically significant event, a Beijing academic said
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Xu Bodong, a professor of Taiwan studies at the Beijing Union
University, said in an interview with the Central News Agency that
this is a "win-win" agreement that will help temper the tension
across the Taiwan Strait.
</P>
<P>
However, Xu said the effect of the charter flight agreement,
which he said is a special, isolated case, must not be overestimated
and that the launch of the services does not mean that direct
cross-strait shipping and air links will be realized any time soon.
</P>
<P>
He said there is still a long way to go before direct
cross-strait transport links can be opened, due to the political
confrontation between Beijing and Taipei.
</P>
<P>
Negotiators from Taiwan and the mainland reached an agreement in
Macau Saturday to launch special charter flights from Jan. 29 to Feb.
20 to carry mainland-based Taiwanese businessmen and their families
home for the Lunar New Year holiday.
</P>
<P>
Unlike the last cross-strait Lunar New Year charter services in
2003, which were operated solely by Taiwanese airliners between
Shanghai and Taipei/Kaohsiung, this year's services will be jointly
operated by six air carriers from each side between
Beijing/Shanghai/Guangzhou on the mainland and Taipei/Kaohsiung in
Taiwan.

TAIWAN BUSINESS LEADERS IN CHINA WELCOME  CHARTER FLIGHT SERVICES
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Beijing,   Jan.   15  (CNA)
(By Stanley Cheung and Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The leaders of several Taiwan
businessmen's associations in mainland China welcomed Saturday an
agreement reached between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait on the
launch of charter flights for the Chinese New Year holiday period,
although it came "a bit late."
</P>
<P>
Chen Kuo-yuan, secretary-general of the Taiwan Businessmen
Association in Beijing, said that it is historically significant to
have mainland civilian planes land legally on Taiwan soil for the
first time in five decades.
</P>
<P>
Chen made the remarks after aviation representatives from Taipei
and Beijing reached an agreement earlier that day in Macau that six
air carriers each from both sides will operate 24 charter flights
between Beijing/Shanghai/Guangzhou and Taipei/Kaohsiung between Jan.
29 and Feb. 20.
</P>
<P>
Chen said that his association will coordinate with related
associations in Heibei and Tianjin to help Taiwan businessmen book
tickets on the charter flights during the Chinese New Year holiday.
</P>
<P>
But he also said that "it was a pity that the agreement came a
bit late, as most Taiwan businessmen have already booked their
tickets" through existing channels.
</P>
<P>
Kuo Shan-huei, president of Taiwan Businessmen Association in
Tungguan, said that with air carriers from both sides of the Taiwan
strait offering the services, it will be an ice-breaking move and
historically significant.
</P>
<P>
The agreement will be especially useful as one of the
destinations is Guangzhou, where there is a heavy concentration of
Taiwan businessmen.
</P>
<P>
Chang Han-wen, another association official, said that Taiwan
businessmen in Guangzhou are in great need of charter flights, as a
lot of them are in the manufacturing industry and the only time they
can make a trip home is during the long Chinese New Year holiday. The
direct charter flights will save them time and money as they will not
have to route their journey via a third place such as Hong Kong or
Macau.

CHARTER FLIGHTS A STEP FURTHER IN CROSS-STRAIT EXCHANGES: KMT

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The agreement reached between the two sides
of the Taiwan Strait on the launch of cross-strait charter flights
during the Chinese New Year holiday period marks a step further in
exchanges across the Taiwan Strait, an opposition Kuomintang (KMT)
official said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Tseng Yung-chuan, a KMT legislator and executive director of the
KMT Policy Committee, claimed that it was the KMT that first promoted
the idea, earning an enthusiastic response from the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party.
</P>
<P>
Tseng said that the opposition parties still have a lot of room
for participation in issues related to cross-strait relations and the
general public, adding that the KMT likes to see positive
developments in cross-strait relations. He said the launch of charter
flights for the holiday is a model of cooperation between the ruling
and opposition parties in pushing through major issues.
</P>
<P>
Tseng recently led a KMT delegation to the mainland to meet with
Chen Yun-lin, director of the Taiwan Affairs Office of the State
Council, on the issue. Chen announced after the Jan. 10 meeting that
they had officially agreed that the charter flights would take place.
</P>
<P>
However, the Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) said that Taipei and
Beijing had already reached agreement in a secret meeting in Macau in
early January.
</P>
<P>
"Even if the KMT seems to have been too nosey in the matter, it
did help bring about a good result," Tseng claimed.
</P>
<P>
Aviation representatives from Taipei and Beijing reached an
agreement earlier in the day that six air carriers from each side
will operate 24 charter flights each between
Beijing/Shanghai/Guangzhou and Taipei/Kaohsiung between Jan. 29 and
Feb. 20, marking the first time Chinese civil aircraft will have
landed on Taiwan soil in five decades.
</P>

The first cross-strait charter flights were inaugurated during

SCHOLARS WARN OF SERIOUS ENVIRONMENTAL DETERIORATION
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Jan.  15 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Serious environmental deterioration in
Taiwan was the prime concern for many scholars and environmentalists
in a public hearing held Saturday, who urged the government to
quickly tackle the problem.
</P>
<P>
They issued the warning at the hearing sponsored by the
Cabinet-level Council for Economic Planning and Development, pointing
out that the problem is worsening at an alarming rate that will
eventually take its toll on the people of Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Chen Hung-yu, a geology professor from National Taiwan
University, said that the number of Taiwan rivers prone to mudslides
and rockslides has surged to an astonishing 1,420 since the
devastating Sept. 21, 1999 earthquake hit Taiwan, in particular
central regions. Today, he noted, 655 of the country's dangerous
rivers are in central Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
There were only 485 such rivers around the country prior to 1996,
with 134 in central regions, he added.
</P>
<P>
The worst quake to hit Taiwan in a century severely changed the
country's topography, he said, pointing out that now only a third of
the rainfall of the past average amounts before the 921 earthquake
can easily trigger catastrophes anywhere in the country.
</P>
<P>
For instance, he explained, the more than 250,000 tons of debris
brought down in just a few days by typhoon Mindulle in September last
year was equal to a quarter of the total amount accumulated in the
whole of the previous year.
</P>
<P>
Hsieh Cheng-lun, a marine science professor at National Chengkung
University, suggested that the government spend its money on
environmental protection rather than just dumping budget money into
repairing the rivers.
</P>
<P>
That would be much more cost-effective because it is a mission
impossible to have the government spend at least NT$140 billion
(US$4.3 billion) to clean up the roughly 1,400 streams and rivers
around Taiwan, he said.

TAIWANESE MAN CLAIMS TO BE ILLEGALLY DETAINED, MALTREATED IN MALAYSIA
</HEADLINE>

<P>
A local businessman who returned from
Malaysia Friday claimed in Taichung Saturday that he was illegally
detained for 43 days and maltreated by Malaysian police in Kuala
Lumpur.
</P>
<P>
Chen Pao-chao, a businessman who sells oil used in religious
worship, said he arrived in Kuala Lumpur Dec. 1 and was escorted by a
Malaysian friend to a local hotel where he was to stay before going
on to Penang the next day as he did in 10 previous business trips to
Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
When he and his friend went out for dinner at a local restaurant
that evening, they were arrested in the hotel's parking lot by eight
police officers, who accused them of being drug dealers, threw them
to the ground and beat them ruthlessly during the ensuing
interrogation.
</P>
<P>
In order to force him into admitting his alleged crime, Chen
claimed that he was badly beaten, tortured and denied a lawyer.
</P>
<P>
Although the police claimed they had been watching his friend for
a while and knew all about their deals, they did not show any
evidence that he was involved in anything illegal and refused to let
him go, claiming that they can legally hold a suspect for up to two
years without filing charges.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to the help of a secretary at the Taiwan representative
office in Kuala Lumpur, Chen said he was released eventually and
allowed to return to Taichung.
</P>
<P>
Waving a medical certificate issued by a hospital in Taichung, Wu
claimed that his 43-day ordeal in Malaysian police custody has badly
damaged his health.
</P>
<P>
He condemned the Malaysian police for trampling on his human
rights. Meanwhile, Foreign Ministry spokesman Michel Lu said in
Taipei that his ministry is looking into the case and will express
its serious concern to the Malaysian authorities, despite the absence
of diplomatic ties between Taipei and Kuala Lumpur.
</P>
<P>
Lu said his ministry helped members of Chen's family to visit him
in Kuala Lumpur during his detention and helped him return to Taiwan
after his release.

TAIPEI MAYOR CANCELS TRIP TO AUSTRALIA

<P>
Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou has canceled a
planned visit to Australia for the closing ceremony of the 2005 Deaf
Olympics in Melbourne, a city government official said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Vice Mayor Pai Hsiu-hsiung was assigned to make the trip in his
place, according to Taipei city government spokesman Yu Tzu-hsiang.
</P>
<P>
Ma had previously canceled a planned visit to Thailand in order
to oversee damage control over a catalogue of errors by a municipal
hospital earlier in the week that delayed the emergency treatment of
aseverely abused four-year-old girl.
</P>
<P>
The Taipei City Hospital's Jen Ai branch refused to perform
surgery on the girl, who had suffered serious brain injuries after
being beaten up by her drunken father, and tried to transfer her to
another hospital as it had no beds available. Another 23 Taipei
hospitals offered the same excuse and the girl finally had to be
taken almost 200 km to a hospital in Taichung County, where she
remains in a coma.
</P>
<P>
Ma canceled the Australian trip following the city government's
decision to renew an investigation into the responsibility of medical
workers at the Jen Ai hospital.
</P>
<P>
Several hospital officials have been punished for their parts in
the incident, while Chang Hang, head of the city's Department of
Health, has also been removed from his post.

the country to "a new dawn." He shot down talk of a
destabilization plot and branded the administration of
President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo corrupt and an
international pariah.

PRESIDENT CHEN SATISFIED WITH CROSS-STRAIT CHARTER FLIGHTS: MAC

<TEXT>
<P>
President Chen Shui-bian is satisfied with
the agreement reached by both sides of the Taiwan Strait on direct
charter flights for the coming Chinese Lunar New Year holiday,
according to Joseph Wu, chairman of the Mainland Affairs Council
(MAC).
</P>
<P>
Wu said he briefed the president immediately after
representatives of Taipei and Beijing agreed to landmark direct
cross-strait charter flights after negotiations in Macau Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The agreement allows Chinese and Taiwanese airlines to fly into
each other's territory from Jan. 29 to Feb. 20 to serve Taiwanese
business people and their families based in mainland China.
</P>
<P>
The MAC head expressed the hope that the agreement will also
serve as a foundation for further negotiations and an opportunity for
positive interactions between Taiwan and the mainland in the future.
</P>
<P>
Wu said that the agreement is not perfect, but it is acceptable.
He added that the success of the talks demonstrates that both sides
of the Taiwan Strait can shelve their differences and can talk
without preconditions, which bodes well for the future.
</P>
<P>
Both sides can jointly promote exchanges and activities that are
mutually beneficial to create an atmosphere of shared trust, he said.
</P>
<P>
The MAC head also said that following the model used to establish
these temporary flights, Taiwan and the mainland will gradually hold
talks on other matters, including cargo charter flights, trade, legal
issues, repatriation of stowaways and cooperation in fighting
cross-strait crime.
</P>
<P>
MAC Vice Chairman Chiu Tai-san agreed that the manner in which
the talks were conducted in Macau has set a good precedence for
further negotiations between the two sides.

PERMANENT DIRECT CROSS-STRAIT FLIGHTS COULD AFFECT HK AND MACAU
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Hong  Kong,   Jan.  16  (CNA)
(By Lin Yu-kuo and Deborah Kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Chinese Lunar New Year direct
cross-strait holiday flights will have little impact on Hong Kong and
Macau because they will be temporary, but should direct flights
become the norm, the two mainland enclaves could be adversely
affected, travel and media sources said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"Direct" cross-strait holiday charter flights in 2003 were not
direct at all; the only difference from regular commercial flights
was that passengers, instead of having to change planes in Hong Kong
or Macau to carry on into mainland China, were allowed to stay on the
same plane they departed on as it touched down in one of the third
places and then took off again. This year, both sides agreed that no
landing in a third place will be required, but the charter planes
must detour and fly over Hong Kong's air space en route to their
final destinations.
</P>
<P>
The flights will be jointly operated by six air carriers from
each side plying routes between Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou on
the mainland and Taipei and Kaohsiung in Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the Hong Kong-Macau Shuttle Bus Association
estimated that bus transportation business during this year's flights
is expected to decline 6 percent to 7 percent during the Chinese
Lunar New Year period.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that about 100,000 Taiwan people travel via
Hong Kong to the mainland to visit relatives or for family reunions
during the Chinese Lunar New Year holiday every year. Of these, about
30,000 headed to Guangdong province by bus.
</P>
<P>
The impact is limited since the charter flights will only operate
for 23 days, from Jan. 29 to Feb. 20; however, the spokesman said
that the shuttle bus association will have to study its business
strategies if the new agreement is extended to allow air carriers to
operate direct flights in the long term.
</P>
<P>
Chiang Su-hui, a Hong Kong-based political observer and opinion
leader, said that the landmark agreement between Taiwan and mainland
China Saturday is a forerunner of overall direct transportation links
across the Taiwan Strait. Hong Kong's entrepot role will be
completely phased out once across- the-board direct air and shipping
links across the Taiwan Strait are fully implemented, Chiang said.
</P>
<P>
Against this backdrop, Chiang said, Hong Kong should think about
how to reposition itself in the triangular relationship among Taiwan,
mainland China and Hong Kong. For example, she said, Hong Kong could
strive to become the new center for cultural exchanges between Taiwan
and mainland China.
</P>
<P>
However, Liu Yue-shao, a Hong Kong-based news commentator, said
that Hong Kong's role as an entrepot will not be affected noticeably
if the exchanges of direct charter flights between Taiwan and
mainland China become a reality because Hong Kong is an international
port city that already sees large numbers of international flights,
cross-continent shipping and is a key transshipment center, among
many other business aspects of the former British colony.
</P>
<P>
By comparison, Liu said, Macau stands to be much harder hit if
direct links are to be opened as some 70 percent of the former
Portuguese colony's daily flights are for transshipments.
</P>
<P>
The details of Saturday's agreement were jointly announced after
the first stage of negotiations by China Civil Aviation Association
Executive Director Pu Zhaozhou and Taipei Airlines Association
President Michael Lo, the lead negotiators representing the two
sides.
</P>
<P>
According to the agreement, the air carriers from Taiwan and the
mainland will each operate 24 round-trip flights during the period
with both sides having agreed on details concerning the licensing and
qualifications of flight crews.

TRANSPARENT MECHANISM NEEDED FOR INTER-PARTY TALKS: FRANK HSIEH
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Jan.  16 (CNA)
(By Luis Huang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An open and transparent mechanism for
inter-party negotiations for reconciliation and cooperation among
political parties would be welcomed, Kaohsiung Mayor Frank Hsieh said
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Hsieh, who many consider the likely top candidate to take over
the reins as premier, made the remarks at a policy seminar for the
ruling Democratic Progressive Party's legislators-elect held at the
Grand Hotel in Taipei.
</P>
<P>
He was responding to opposition People First Party (PFP) Chairman
James Soong's claims that the PFP is willing to closely cooperate
with political parties on all economic issues while sticking to its
stance of defending the existence of the Republic of China and
opposing Taiwan independence.
</P>
<P>
Any inter-party cooperation should be transparent and reached
through party-to-party negotiations lest it should be linked to
tricks or political rewards because the public currently has little
confidence in the government and political parties, Hsieh stressed.
</P>
<P>
Noting that an open and transparent mechanism for inter-party
negotiations is essential to promote cooperation among political
parties, Hsieh said that in addition to the PFP, the DPP will not
rule out the possibility of seeking cooperation with other parties.
</P>
<P>
President Chen Shui-bian has been seeking to end long-term
inter-party disagreements and bickering since the Dec. 11 legislative
elections, in which the "pan-green camp" of the DPP and its ally,
Taiwan Solidarity Union, failed to gain a majority in the 225-seat
legislature.
</P>
<P>
According to media reports, Hsieh is likely to be appointed the
new premier to face a new legislature, while Soong will serve as the
chairman of a proposed committee for cross-strait peace and
development under the Presidential Office.
</P>
<P>
However, Hsieh declined to confirm the report, saying that it is
not he who appoints a new premier and that as Kaohsiung mayor, he
will do his utmost to perform his duties well.

Republic of China Minister of Economic
Affairs Ho Mei-yueh encouraged Taiwanese manufacturers operating in
foreign countries Saturday to use Taiwan as their business hubs in
exploring Asian markets.
</P>
<P>
Ho made the appeal in Los Angeles while delivering a speech at a
board meeting of the Taiwanese Chamber of Commerce of North America
attended by more than 140 board members and representatives from
overseas Taiwanese manufacturers associations.
</P>
<P>
Expounded Taiwan's economic developments during the three-day
meeting, Ho said that the country's economic growth rate hit 5.93
percent in 2004, with imports and exports posting remarkable growth.
</P>
<P>
All sectors in Taiwan, such as computers and information
technology, are expected to enjoy an impressive growth this year, Ho
noted, adding that Asia's economy is forecast to grow rapidly in the
next 10 years.
</P>
<P>
Claiming that Taiwan is especially suitable for overseas
Taiwanese business people to investment in, Ho voiced the hope that
they will set up production facilities in Taiwan and use it as a
springboard to make inroads into Asian markets.
</P>
<P>
After concluding her visit to the United States, Ho will proceed
to Japan Jan. 17 to explore more opportunities for cooperation
between the two countries, particularly in the field of information
technology. During her stay in Japan, Ho is scheduled to visit

HOLIDAY CHARTER FLIGHTS OPERATION RULES TO BE FINALIZED SOON: CAA
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  Jan.  16 (CNA)
(By Luis Huang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Operational procedures for the special
direct charter flights across the Taiwan Strait during the Chinese
Lunar New Year holiday will be finalized Tuesday at the earliest,
Civil Aeronautics Administration (CAA) Director-General Billy
K.C. Chang said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The CAA will submit a draft of the procedures Monday to the
Cabinet-level Mainland Affairs Council for deliberation and approval,
Chang said.
</P>
<P>
As soon as the CAA receives an approval letter from the Executive
Yuan, it will begin to accept applications by domestic air carriers
intending to offer the much-anticipated direct cross-strait charter
flight services, Chang added.
</P>
<P>
Chang went on to say that regulations governing the flights
should be announced Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Negotiators from Taiwan and mainland China reached an agreement
in Macau Saturday to launch direct charter flights from Jan. 29 to
Feb. 20 to carry mainland-based Taiwanese business people and their
families home for the holiday.
</P>
<P>
According to the agreement, the services will be jointly operated
by six air carriers from each side between Beijing, Shanghai and
Guangzhou on the mainland and Taipei and Kaohsiung in Taiwan, with
the flights having to detour over Hong Kong's air space.
</P>
<P>
With the consent of the Beijing authorities, six Taiwan carriers
operated Lunar New Year charter flights in 2003 between Shanghai and
Taipei/Kaohsiung via Hong Kong/Macau. The services were discontinued
the following year because Beijing insisted that mainland carriers
also be allowed to join the service but refused to come to the
negotiating table to discuss the issue with Taiwan.

DPP STILL HOPES FOR INTER-PARTY COOPERATION: DPP SECRETARY-GENERAL
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Jan.  16 (CNA)
(by Deborah Kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The ruling Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) is still looking forward to collaborating with opposition
parties to promote harmony between the legislature and the Cabinet,
DPP Secretary-General Chang Chun-hsiung said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
There will be no bottom line in the ruling party's promotion of
inter-party cooperation, Chang said during a two-day orientation
course for the DPP's legislators-elect. The new legislature is
scheduled to be sworn in Feb. 1.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the DPP will pull out all the stops in promoting
inter-party cooperation in the wake of the Dec. 11 legislative
elections in which the DPP failed to reach its goal of forming a
stable majority with its ally, the Taiwan Solidarity Union.
</P>
<P>
The scope and scale of the inter-party cooperation, including
cooperation over the passage of certain bills in the Legislative
Yuan, will be finalized after President Chen Shui-bian meets with
leaders of major opposition parties, regardless of the fact that
President Chen recently stepped down from the DPP chairmanship, Chang
added.
</P>
<P>
Chang said that the main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) is no longer
insisting on appointing a KMT member as the new premier, while
opposition People First Party (PFP) Chairman James Soong also said
that he would not seek to hold any post in the government, clearing
the way for President Chen to nominate a premier, who will in turn
form the Cabinet.
</P>
<P>
Chang added that Soong's remarks made in the United States
Saturday -- namely that he will push to seek reconciliation across
the Taiwan Strait, reconciliation among political parties in Taiwan
and reconciliation among different ethnic groups -- are commendable.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, acting DPP Chairman Ke Chien-ming said that there is
still ample room for DPP-PFP cooperation despite the fact that Soong
has said that he will not seek the premiership and that he has no
interest in chairing a presidential Committee for Cross-Strait Peace
and Development and no PFP figures will be recruited to work in the
DPP-run Cabinet.
</P>
<P>
Ke said that the DPP will continue to facilitate a meeting
between President Chen and Soong.
</P>
<P>
The Cabinet will resign Jan. 24 to make way for the new Cabinet
that will be formed after the new legislature is sworn in Feb. 1.

DPP MAY VIE FOR SPEAKERSHIP IF NO COOPERATION REACHED WITH  PFP
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Jan.  16 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)

<TEXT>
<P>
The ruling Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) will not rule out the possibility of naming its own candidate
to vie for the legislative speakership if it fails to strike a
cooperative deal with the second-largest opposition party, an
influential DPP lawmaker said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The DPP has been seeking to forge a working partnership with the
opposition People First Party (PFP) since the "pan-green camp" of the
DPP and the Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU) failed to win a majority in
the Dec. 11 legislative elections.
</P>
<P>
However, PFP Chairman James Soong said in Washington, D.C.
Saturday that his party will support incumbent Legislative Yuan
President Wang Jin-pyng for re-election, the vote for which will be
held Feb. 1 along with that for deputy speaker.
</P>
<P>
Wang is a vice chairman of the largest opposition party -- the
Kuomintang (KMT) . As some PFP lawmakers have expressed interest in
running for deputy speaker, Soong said he will listen to their
opinions before making a decision on the party's stance toward that
post. Soong will return to Taipei around Jan. 20.
</P>
<P>
Responding to Soong's remarks, Tsai Huang-liang, a DPP
legislative whip, said the DPP will continue to woo the PFP to forge a
partnership. If this goal cannot be realized, Tsai said the DPP may
field a candidate to run for speaker.
</P>
<P>
As to who its candidate might be, Tsai said the DPP has yet to
discuss this issue. Nevertheless, Tsai said he thinks incumbent DPP
Secretary-General Chang Chun-hsiung, who will become a DPP
legislator-at-large Feb. 1, is the top choice. Unless Chang
explicitly declines to join the race for speaker, Tsai said, the DPP
will not consider any other person. He further said the DPP will not
field its own candidate for deputy speaker to retain leverage to make
cooperative deals with other parties.
</P>
<P>
If the DPP can reach a cooperative deal with the PFP, Tsai said
the DPP will not rule out the possibility of supporting a PFP
candidate for speaker.
</P>
<P>
In related news developments, PFP legislative whip Liu Wen-hsiung
dismissed as sheer speculation a media report that some PFP lawmakers
may support a DPP candidate in the upcoming speaker election.
</P>
<P>
Liu said the PFP's top goal is to secure the legislative deputy
speaker post. 
</P>
<P>
The KMT reportedly will agree to support a PFP candidate in
the election for deputy speaker if the PFP supports Wang in the
speakership election.
</P>
<P>
Liu said when Soong return to Taipei, the PFP's candidate for
deputy spekaer election will become clear.
</P>
<P>
In the new 225-seat legislature to be inaugurated Feb.1, the
ruling DPP will remain the largest party with 89 seats, followed by
the KMT with 79 seats, the PFP with 34 seats and the TSU with 12
seats. The remaining seats will be controlled by the Non-Partisan
Solidarity Union and independents.

PFP'S ANTI-TAIWAN INDEPENDENCE STANCE REMAINS UNCHANGED: SOONG
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Washington,  Jan.  15 (CNA)
(By Oliver Lin and P.C. Tang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Opposition People First Party (PFP)
Chairman James Soong said Saturday that he has never wavered in his
stance of opposing the independence of Taiwan and supporting the
Republic of China.
</P>
<P>
Soong, who is currently visiting Washington, D.C., reiterated his
long-standing stance while meeting with media at the PFP and
Kuomintang representative office in the U.S. capital.
</P>
<P>
Pointing out that his party will push for cross-strait and
political reconciliation and harmony among the people of Taiwan, the
PFP head said that some people have questioned the PFP's idea of
reconciling political parties and have worried about the stance of
the party.
</P>
<P>
Noting that pushing for reconciliation does not represent a
change in the PFP's position, Soong said: "The PFP's stance is stable
and concerning issues regarding cross-strait relations, the
independence of Taiwan is absolutely not an option."
</P>
<P>
Taiwan's independence would bring disastrous results to the
island and opposition to independence is the PFP's firm and basic
policy, he further said, adding that this policy and his party's
stance supporting the Republic of China have never changed.
</P>
<P>
Saying that the results of last December's legislative elections
demonstrated the failure of extremists of pro-Taiwan independence
groups, Soong, however, said that this does not mean that the island
needs to press for unification with mainland China, adding that
maintaining the status quo has been the consensus of most people on
the island.
</P>
<P>
He also said that Taiwan needs to have wisdom to prevent hardline
mainland Chinese from making excuses for using force against the
island and to allow moderate factions to have a reason for
maintaining peace with Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
During his visit, Soong also met with U.S. political figures and
local think tanks and exchanged views with them on the legislative
election results and the enactment of a cross-strait peace-promotion
law proposed by the PFP.
</P>
<P>
Emphasizing that the purpose of his visit is to exchange
first-hand opinions with U.S. officials and scholars, Soong said that
the lowest vote-casting rate registered in the legislative elections
has demonstrated the dislike of the people for the desperate fight
among political parties. According to Soong, a survey released
recently in Taiwan showed that 68.7 percent of Taiwanese support a
truce among the parties and are concerned only about issues relating
to their well-being.
</P>
<P>
Touching on the PFP's proposal of enacting a law to promote
cross-strait peace, Soong said that he had told U.S. officials and
scholars that without stable cross-strait relations, Taiwan will be
unable to stabilize its political and economic situation and mount
effective competition with mainland China.
</P>
<P>
None of Taiwan's political parties can unilaterally take the
initiative to handle cross-strait relations, and such relations must
be dealt with in a transparent manner, Soong added.

<P>
The world census of
endangered black-faced spoonbills for 2004 is scheduled to be
finalized Jan. 23 when all the survey data on the rare migratory
birds are collected from around Asia, the Taiwan-based Happy Wild
Bird Association said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Census data of black-faced spoonbills will be mailed from South
Korea, mainland China, Macau, Hong Kong, Japan, Taiwan, Vietnam and
the Philippines to the Hong Kong Bird Watching Society in the next
few days so that the total number of the rare migratory birds around
the globe will be recorded for 2004.
</P>
<P>
The Hong Kong-based bird-watching group has conducted the annual
census for years.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan's total figure of the visiting black-faced spoonbills as
of Jan. 22 -- being compiled by four Tainan-based wild bird and
wildlife conservation groups, including the Happy Wild Bird
Association -- will also be mailed to the Hong Kong group Jan. 23, a
spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The 2003 world black-faced spoonbills census was finalized Jan.
17, 2004 with a total of 1,206 birds, 628 of them in Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
This year, the figure in Taiwan is expected to be a record high,
since the number of black-faced spoonbills overwintering in Taiwan,
particularly in the southern county of Tainan, surpassed 780 as of
Jan. 9, 2005, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The Chiku Wetlands sanctuary near the estuary of the Tsengwen
River in Tainan County has been the world's major habitat for
black-faced spoonbills and other Asian migratory species for years.

to instruct Taiwan's representative offices in Indonesia and
Singapore to offer needed assistance.

DOH TO STEP UP MONITORING OF RU486 ABORTION PILL USE
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,   Jan. 16  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Department of Health (DOH) will
intensify auditing of the use of RU486 early abortion pills in the
face of allegations of rampant abuse of the controversial drug, an
official in charge of controlled drugs said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
According to DOH tallies, local women took an average of 7,711
RU486 pills, also known as Mifepristone, per month in 2002, which
could be translated into 30,847 RU486-induced abortion cases for the
whole year. The number of the average monthly RU486 use increased to
10,753 tablets in 2003 for an estimated 43,011 abortion cases during
the year.
</P>
<P>
"The figures marked a 39 percent year-on-year growth in terms of
the consumption of RU486 tablets," said Lee Jih-heng, director of the
DOH's National Bureau of Controlled Drugs.
</P>
<P>
Worse still, Lee said, some local medical institutions or clinics
have allegedly used smuggled RU486 pills from mainland China or other
countries to save costs and dodge DOH supervision.
</P>
<P>
Noting that only those women less than seven weeks pregnant and
confirmed to be free of ectopic pregnancy can use RU486, Lee said
abuse of smuggled or unsanctioned RU486 could be very dangerous.
</P>
<P>
With a view to better protecting local women's health, Lee said
the DOH will tighten monitoring of the use of RU486, step up safe sex
publicity and revise relevant abortion regulations to cope with the
changing social situation.

The campaign to raise funds to sponsor
10,000 children affected by the Dec. 26 tsunami catastrophe in South
and Southeast Asia has been a big success, a senior official said
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"As of Sunday, more than NT$400 million (US$12.5 million) in cash
has been raised, " Government Information Office (GIO)
Director-General Lin Chia-lung said. The GIO launched the
fundraising campaign, titled "The Day after Tomorrow, 10,000 Hopes"
two weeks ago to sponsor 10,000 tsunami-affected
children for one year.
</P>
<P>
The campaign came to a finale at an evening party Saturday, with
many celebrities donating personal effects for auction to raise
money. Lin said the fundraising campaign has come to a successful
end, with donations exceeding the original target of NT$360 million.
</P>
<P>
Lin said the GIO will join with local news media in forming a
trust fund to manage the money and ensure that the donations are used
correctly and wisely.
</P>
<P>
According to the GIO's plan, Lin said local non-governmental
organizations will be commissioned to plan how to use the funds. The
donations will be taken to Indonesia and Sri Lanka, the two
hardest-hit countries, after the Chinese Lunar New Year holiday, Lin
said, adding that formal donation ceremonies will be held in those

PRESIDENT CHEN GIVES PEP TALKS TO DPP LEGISLATORS-ELECT
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Dec. 16 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President Chen Shui-bian said Sunday that
diligence, justice and professionalism are key elements for an
elected representative to become a successful and influential
legislator.
</P>
<P>
Chen, a lawyer-turned politician who once served as a legislator
for five years, made the remarks while addressing the closing
ceremony for an orientation workshop for legislators-elect of the
ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP).
</P>
<P>
Chen exhorted all DPP legislators-elect to put overall national
interests above anything else and use broader perspective in dealing
with public policy affairs.
</P>
<P>
"To be successful, respected lawmaker, you must be diligent and
justice-minded. Professionalism is equally important. You must do
research by yourself. You cannot just rely on your aides or read
newspapers. You must conduct in-depth study by yourself if you want
to be a trend-setter or inspire discussion or debate on major policy
issues," Chen said.
</P>
<P>
Noting that politics is not a one-man show, Chen also encouraged
all DPP legislators-elect to stand united in order to realize the
party's major policy goals and reform agenda.
</P>
<P>
"You can have different views and opinions during internal
discussions. But you should have only 'one voice' outside the
legislative caucus," Chen added.
</P>
<P>
In his pep talks, Chen also stressed the importance of upholding
the party's ideals of promoting democratic reform, boosting awareness
of Taiwan's distinctive identity and making Taiwan a "normal,
complete, progressive, beautiful and great" country.
</P>
<P>
"Even though our party fails to reach its goal of winning a
majority in the Dec. 11 legislative election, we should not be
daunted by the setback. We should not turn back on our party's ideals
and missions simply because of the setback. We should instead make
self-examination using the highest standards and redouble our efforts
to overcome difficulties and achieve our ultimate goal," he added.

MAC CALLS FOR MORE CROSS-STRAIT TALKS
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  Jan.  16 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taiwan is ready to hold more talks with
mainland China on a range of economic and legal issues after the two
sides reached a landmark deal on non-stop charter flights during the
Chinese Lunar New Year holiday, a senior official said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) Chairman Joseph Wu made the
remarks a day after the two sides of the Taiwan Strait struck a
one-off deal in Macau to allow for two-way, no-stopover charter
flights during the upcoming Lunar New Year holiday to facilitate the
return of a large number of Taiwan business people operating on the
mainland and their family members for festival celebrations.
</P>
<P>
"We welcome the deal which has laid a very important base for
future cross-strait engagements, " Wu said, adding that the Macau
meeting marked the first time since 1998 that officials from both
sides have sit down to talk.
</P>
<P>
"We believe that the success of the holiday charter flight talks
will contribute much to future negotiations on many other substantial
issues," Wu said.
</P>
<P>
The nation's top mainland policy planner further said the ROC
government is hopeful that the smooth negotiations on New Year
charter flights will be a turning point for positive interaction.
</P>
<P>
"The successful outcome of the discussions guided by the
government and assisted by the private sector, had formed a basis for
mutual trust between the two sides, " Wu said, adding that the MAC
has prepared a list of topics to be negotiated with Beijing,
including direct cross-strait cargo charter flights, various trade
and economic issues, legal problems, repatriation of illegal
immigrants and cooperation in fighting crime.
</P>
<P>
Wu said he hopes mainland China can interact with Taiwan in line
with the spirit and principles prevailing in the just-concluded Macau
talks to ease cross-strait tension and improve bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
In a very short time, negotiators from both sides came to an
agreement on the special holiday passenger charter flights. However,
while the flights will be non-stop, they will still have to go
through Hong Kong or Macau airspace.
</P>
<P>
Wu said the MAC will continue trying to persuade mainland China
to agree to the use of other air routes, such as detouring through
the South Korean or Japanese airspaces to save time and fuel costs.
Beijing opposed the use of South Korean and Japanese airspaces to
avoid giving the impression that the charter flights are
international in nature. Beijing claims sovereignty over Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Forty-eight flights will be allowed under the agreement,
beginning on Jan. 29 and ending on Feb. 20.
</P>
<P>
The new agreement will permit flights from Beijing, Shanghai and
Guangzhou on the mainland and Taipei and Kaohsiung in Taiwan, with
each side allowed to select six airlines for the routes.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan carriers will include China Airlines (CAL) , EVA Airways
Corp., Trans Asia Airways, Far East Air Transport Corp., Mandarin
Airlines and UNI Airways Corp.
</P>
<P>
CAL will operate Taipei-Beijing-Taipei flight Jan. 29;
Taipei-Shanghai-Taipei and Taipei-Guangzhou-Taipei flights Feb. 5 and
Taipei-Beijing-Taipei Feb. 14. Flight schedules of other carriers
will be announced later.
</P>
<P>
From the mainland, airline executives have listed Air China Ltd.,
China Southern Airlines Co. Ltd., Xiamen Airlines and China Eastern
Air as possible candidates.

JEN AI HOSPITAL DOCTOR CONFESSED TO LYING

<TEXT>
<P>
A Taipei Municipal Jen Ai
Hospital neurosurgeon had confessed to lying in the previous
investigations into a critically injured girl's hospital odysseys,
Deputy Taipei Mayor Yeh Chin-chuan said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Yeh said Lin Chih-nan had confessed that he didn't bother to
examine the CAT scans of the four-year-old girl, surnamed Chiu,
while insisting on transferring the brain-injured child to other
hospital.
</P>
<P>
In the previous probes into the outrageous handling of the case,
Lin claimed that he had examined Chiu's CAT scans on computer screens
on the third floor of the hospital while Chiu was waiting for
a brain surgery in the hospital's emergency room, Yeh said.
</P>
<P>
Latest investigations showed that Lin even didn't stay in the
hospital's intensive care units (ICU) on the third floor between 2:05
a.m. and 4:27 a.m. Jan. 10 as he claimed previously, Yeh said.
</P>
<P>
Lin claimed previously that he was on-duty at the ICU ward in
the third floor and had examined Chiu's CAT scans on computer before
insisting that the girl be transferred to other hospitals for a
surgery because Jen Ai's ICU ward was already fully occupied.
</P>
<P>
The girl ended up being transported to a hospital more than 100
kilometers away in the central county of Taichung for surgery. She is
still in a critical condition.
</P>
<P>
Yeh said Jen Ai's another neurosurgeon Liu Chi-hua had assisted
Lin in making false statement on the girl's medical records.
</P>
<P>
Yeh said the city government will come up with a complete
investigative report and decide on how to discipline the two
doctors Monday.

The Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) ,
Taiwan's top mainland policy planner, is closely monitoring the
situation in mainland China to see whether the death of former
Chinese Communist Party chief Zhao Ziyang leads to social or
political unrest, MAC Chairman Joseph Wu said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Zhao, ousted from his post in 1989 for opposing the use of force
against the Tiananmen Square democracy protestors, died in a Beijing
hospital at around 7 a.m. Monday. He was 85.
</P>
<P>
Zhao had been suffering from respiratory and cardiovascular
problems in recent weeks, and rumors abounded that he was near death,
although Beijing officials denied these rumors, claiming that Zhao's
condition was stable.
</P>
<P>
Wu made the remarks after Beijing's official Xinhua News Agency
confirmed Zhao's death in a brief report Monday morning.
</P>
<P>
A human rights society from Hong Kong speculated Monday that
Beijing will tighten up security controls in the next few days out of
concerns that Zhao's death could spark widespread demonstrations by
students and supporters similar to those that followed the death of
former Chinese Communist Party chief Hu Yaobang in 1989.
</P>
<P>
Hu was removed from his post in 1987 for allowing pro-democracy

<P>
Following Zhao's ouster in the Tiananmen Square crackdown in
1989, he was placed under house arrest where he remained until his
death Monday. The media had in recent weeks remained silent about the

KMT, PFP WILL COOPERATE IN THE END: PFP VICE CHAIRMAN

<TEXT>
<P>
Opposition People First Party (PFP)
Vice Chairman Chang Chau-hsiung said Sunday that the PFP and the
Kuomintang (KMT) will cooperate with each other in the end.
</P>
<P>
Chang, who is in San Francisco visiting his family, made the
remarks while touching on recent media reports relating to various
interactions among the ruling Democratic Progressive Party, the PFP
and the KMT.
</P>
<P>
According to a report in the local Sing Tao Daily, Chang said the
rumors that PFP Chairman James Soong would take the post as Taiwan's
next premier or chairman of a commission for cross-strait peace and
development are "absolutely nonsense."
</P>
<P>
Soong had said during his recent visit to Washington, D.C., that
he and other politicians of his party will not join the DPP's
government and will instead continue their cooperation with the KMT.
</P>
<P>
However, Chang reiterated the PFP's principle in dealing with
cross-strait relations, saying that although the two opposition
parties will eventually cooperate with each other, the PFP's
long-standing position on cross-strait relations is still "to
maintain the status quo and shelve differences."
</P>
<P>
Therefore, the PFP is really concerned about the remarks made by
KMT Vice Chairman Wang Jin-pyng during the campaign for last
December's legislative elections that "Taiwan independence is an
option, " Chang noted, adding that the KMT should give an explanation
for the remarks as well as its stance on the issue of party assets.

CHINA URGED TO ACCELERATE POLITICAL REFORMS
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei, Jan. 17 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taiwan's top official in charge of mainland
affairs on Monday urged the Beijing leadership to accelerate
political reforms in mainland China so as to live up to international
expectations of the modern Chinese society.
</P>
<P>
Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) Chairman Joseph Wu called for the
Beijing leadership to be enlightened by former Chinese Communist
Party chief Zhao Ziyang who daringly showed leniency and
understanding toward democracy-seeking student protesters in
Tiananmen Square in 1989.
</P>
<P>
Wu made the remarks after learning about Zhao's death Monday
morning.
</P>
<P>
Wu said that Zhao's leniency and understanding toward the
protesters in 1989 has been highly recognized by the international
community, which considers Zhao a pioneer of China's burgeoning
democratization. Zhao was ousted from his post by the mainland
leadership during the Tiananmen Square crackdown.
</P>
<P>
Wu said that China has vigorously pushed for liberalization and
globalization in the economic sector over the past decade but has
lacked concrete action in political and social reform.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, Wu said the MAC is closely monitoring the
situation in mainland China to see whether the death of Zhao leads to
social or political unrest.
</P>
<P>
Zhao, ousted from his post in 1989 for opposing the use of force
against the Tiananmen Square democracy protestors, died in a Beijing
hospital at around 7 a.m. Monday. He was 85.
</P>
<P>
Zhao had been suffering from respiratory and cardiovascular

TRANSPORT MINISTER AGREES TO CONSIDER EXTENDING MINI LINKS TO SKIES
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Kinmen,  Jan. 17 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Transportation and Communications Minister
Lin Ling-san agreed on Monday to study the feasibility of extending
the "mini three links" from the sea to the skies to make cross-strait
travel speedier.
</P>
<P>
The "mini three links" refers to direct trade, postal and
transportation links between the outlying Taiwan-held islands of
Kinmen and Matsu and the mainland Chinese ports of Fuzhou and Xiamen
in Fujian Province.
</P>
<P>
Lin traveled to Kinmen Monday for a fact-finding tour mainly to
inspect the "mini three links" operations there four years after they
were implemented Jan. 2, 2001.
</P>
<P>
Lin was accompanied by Legislator Lee Sen-zong, convener of the
Legislative Yuan Transportation Committee, and Legislator Wu
Cheng-dian, elected from Kinmen, who suggested that the Ministry of
Transportation and Communications consider opening the "air mini
three links."
</P>
<P>
Prior to opening direct trade, postal and transportation links
between Taiwan proper and mainland China, or the "direct three
links, " the government should consider expanding the "mini three
links" from the sea to the air, allowing passenger aircraft from
Beijing and Shanghai to fly to Kinmen before heading to Taiwan, Wu
noted.
</P>
<P>
Lin promised to consider Wu's suggestion but added that the "air
mini three links" issue involves not only matters related to airports
and facilities, but also other economic and political factors.
</P>
<P>
Besides, Lin argued, the "mini three links" have been operating
smoothly and have lived up to the public's expectations by helping
bolster transportation exchanges across the Taiwan Strait.
</P>
<P>
The "mini three links, " originally designed to serve only
residents from Kinmen and Matsu and residents of Fujian Province,
have also been used over the past two years for mainland-based
Taiwanese businesspeople and their families heading home to Taiwan
for family reunions during special holidays, Lin said.

BEIJING SHOULD LEARN FROM ZHAO'S MAGNANIMITY: EXECUTIVE YUAN
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Jan. 17 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mainland China's current leadership should
learn from the magnanimity of the purged Chinese Communist Party
(CCP) chief Zhao Ziyang, Executive Yuan spokesman Chen Chi-mai said
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Chen made the appeal after former CCP General Secretary Zhao, who
was ousted in 1989 for opposing an army crackdown on the Tiananmen
Square pro-democracy demonstrations, died in a Beijing hospital
earlier in the day at the age of 85. Zhao spent the last 15 years of
his life under house arrest.
</P>
<P>
Chen said most mainland Chinese people have given positive
recognition to Zhao's contributions during his tenure as premier and
CCP general secretary, particularly for his assisting the late
mainland patriarch Deng Xiaoping in promoting market reform to allow
mainland China to be integrated into the global economic system.
</P>
<P>
Noting that Zhao's showing of understanding and sympathy for
pro-democracy students was impressive, Chen said mainland China's
current leaders should learn from Zhao's lenience and magnanimity and
step up pluralistic democratic reform.
</P>
<P>
Despite its fast economic growth over the past 15 years, Chen
said, mainland China has failed to make similar progress in the
political field.
</P>
<P>
"Mainland China has not only failed to promote freedom,
democracy, human rights and the rule of law, but has even suppressed
religious freedom and demonstrated a poor human rights record, " Chen
said.
</P>
<P>
Zhao has remained a politically sensitive figure up to the
present because his attitude toward the 1989 Tiananmen pro-democracy
demonstrations differed from those of some other mainland leaders.
Against this backdrop, Chen said, Zhao's death could spark a
groundswell of protest and unrest on the mainland over how to define
Zhao's historical status.
</P>
<P>
"We'll keep a close watch for any political impact in China from
Zhao's death," Chen said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he urged Beijing to squarely face up to the Tiananmen
crackdown in which mainland troops brutally crushed the student-led
pro-democracy demonstrations on June 4, 1989, and clear the name of
persecuted demonstrators.

VIOLENCE ERUPTS OVER ISSUE OF TEACHERS FORMING UNIONS
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei, Jan. 17 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Opponents and proponents of the notion that
teachers being allowed to form their own labor unions and go on
strike met violently at the Legislative Yuan Monday, with both sides
swearing to fight to the end.
</P>
<P>
The Legislative Yuan began to debate, screen and negotiate over
three amendment draft bills related to labor affairs Monday. An
article in an amendment draft bill to the Labor Union Law calls for
legislation allowing teachers to form labor unions and go on strike.
</P>
<P>
People on both sides of the issue began shouting and then
fistfights broke out. Legislators had to call the police to calm the
situation.
</P>
<P>
Sidelining the legislative debate, members of many labor unions
jointly held a news conference at the Legislative Yuan to support the
removal of sections of Article Four of the Labor Union Law
prohibiting teachers from organizing labor unions. They said the
section needed eliminated so that teachers can legally form unions to
uphold teachers' human rights.
</P>
<P>
Chang Hsu-chung, chairman of the Chunghua Telecom Labor Union,
said that allowing teachers to organize their own unions is a
irreversible world trend. As a father of children attending
elementary and junior high schools, Chang said that he supports
teachers' rights to unionize.
</P>
<P>
Chang added that members of his union are monitoring which
lawmakers are genuinely on the side of the working class.
</P>
<P>
Lu Hsiu-chu, chairwoman of the National Teachers' Association,
said that should the legislators across the political spectrum fail
to reach a consensus to allow teachers access to unions, her
association will move to instigate a protest by teachers from around
the island against the Legislative Yuan Jan. 20.
</P>
<P>
Lu said that the administration has tried every scheme to
undermine the teachers' will, but teachers are people too who should
be afforded human rights. If teachers are denied human rights, how
could they teach the students about human rights, Lu said.
</P>
<P>
Ke Yi-hsien, chairman of the Taipei City Teachers Association,
said that protecting workers' basic human rights is a pluralistic
value, even a plank in the platform of the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party.
</P>
<P>
Saying that Taiwan is a country that protects human rights, Ke
appealed to all the lawmakers from different parties to support the
amendment that allows teachers to organize their own labor unions.
</P>
<P>
Huang Yu-tech, executive director of the Federation of Industrial
Association in Tainan County, said that teachers are professionals as
well as employees. As such, all employees should have the right to
unionize, Huang said, adding that teachers creating unions are not
only doing so for the purpose of ensuring their rights and interests,
but also for the wholesome development of the entire teaching sector.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a group of students from the graduate schools of the
prestigious National Taiwan University and National Cheng Chi
University staged a rally in front of the Ministry of Education,
calling for the ministry to face impartially the issue of teachers'
rights to organize labor unions.
</P>
<P>
Chen Po-chien, a student from National Cheng Chi University's
Institute of Labor Studies, said that President Chen Shui-bian
promised during a Teachers' Day rally in 2003 to see to it that
teachers be allowed to form their own labor unions.
</P>
<P>
However, Chen Po-chien said, the Ministry of Education
"intentionally" made public results of a recent poll of public
opinions to point out that less then 10 percent of people in Taiwan
support the notion of allowing teachers to form unions and more than
70 percent of the people in Taiwan are against the idea.
</P>
<P>
Chen argued that if teachers are employees, they should have the
same rights as those in any labor organization.
</P>
<P>
He added that the issue of teachers' organizing their own unions
is not tantamount to teachers going on strike or ceasing teaching en
masse. "They are two different issues that should not be mingled
wrongly," he said.
</P>
<P>
On the opposite side, members of the National League of Parents'
Associations also held a press conference at the Legislative Yuan to
voice opposition to teachers' rights to form unions.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the league said that students' right to receive
an education will inevitably be compromised if teachers are allowed
to go on strike and unionize.

The Times: £6bn tax cuts expected as Tories
aim to halt poll slide.

Michael Howard will unveil a multibillion-pound tax cut promise
today as he tries to revive Conservative election fortunes after the
party suffered a double blow yesterday. The Tory leader put a brave
face on the defection of a former minister to Labour and a poll
suggesting that his party faces its worst election result since 1906.
Mr Howard said that he had identified £35 billion in savings on
Labour's spending plans, of which he would use £12 billion for tax
cuts and reducing government borrowing. He is expected to say today
that around £6 billion would be available for tax cuts. The remaining
£23 billion would be reinvested in education, health, defence and
international aid.

Financial Times: BoE boosts intelligence to spot market threats.

The Bank of England is strengthening its intelligence on
financial markets by recruiting more staff to encourage
whistle-blowers and pick up City gossip, in order to prevent another
Barings-style collapse. The move is part of a "root and branch"
review of the Bank ordered by Mervyn King, its governor, as he looks
to stamp his mark on the institution by ridding it of the last
vestiges of its gentlemen's club image and turning it into a premier
professional monetary authority.

<P>
The success of recent cross-strait charter
flight talks in Macau between Taiwan and mainland China mark the
beginning of normalization of bilateral ties, President Chen
Shui-bian said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Chen made the remarks in a meeting with United States Congressman
Tom Lantos at the Presidential Office.
</P>
<P>
Negotiators from Taiwan and mainland China reached an agreement
in Macau Saturday to launch special charter flights from Jan. 29 to
Feb. 20 to carry mainland-based Taiwanese businessmen and their
families home for the Lunar New Year holiday.
</P>
<P>
The president said that there is nothing the two sides of the
Taiwan Strait cannot achieve if their differences are put aside and
goodwill is used to reach a consensus.
</P>
<P>
There now exists a good opportunity for resuming the long-stalled
cross-strait talks this year, he emphasized.
</P>
<P>
The president reminded Lantos that his new year's day address,
called " creating a new and stable environment for consultations and
dialogue, " was aimed at encouraging not only domestic political
forces but also those across the Taiwan Strait.
</P>
<P>
Chen also said that Taiwan would strive to protect human rights
in line with international standards.
</P>
<P>
The Legislative Yuan should approve as soon as possible organic
laws for the proposed National Human Rights Commission and a National
Human Rights Memorial Hall, while making the International Human
Rights Code a domestic one, he said.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Chen also decorated Lantos in recognition of
his contributions to the promotion of Taiwan-U.S. relations.

Ten young people were honored Monday in
Taipei by the CNA as 10 of Taiwan's rising stars.
</P>
<P>
They were chosen by a jury of 10 university heads for their
significant contributions to Taiwan's image on the international
stage.
</P>
<P>
Following is a list of the 10 people and their remarkable
achievements:

</P>
<P>
Ching-chun Lee, assistant artistic director of the Cloud Gate
Dance Theatre of Taiwan, reached the pinnacle of her career when she
became the first dancer ever to receive the National Award for Arts
in 2004.
</P>
<P>
Rueibin Chen is a young pianist who won Taiwan's 2004 Golden
Melody Award for best performer and best classical music album, and
was a winner of the 10 Distinguished Young People awards in 2004
sponsored by the Taiwan Junior chamber.
</P>
<P>
Liu Jui-chi, an associate professor at the Institute of Art
Studies, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, is one of two
university lecturers whose courses on general education were rated by
the Ministry of Education as "excellent" in 2004 for the second
consecutive year.

<P>
Liu also won the 2004 Academia Sinica Prize for Young Scholars
and Researchers with her book "Feminine Masquerade, " which compiles
essays she has written on female photographers over the last five
years.
</P>
<P>
Solomon Chih-cheng Chen, a trained pediatrician, traveled halfway
around the world to work in the remote African state of Malawi. He
was inspired to help the underprivileged when he joined a volunteer
medical service tour to Mozambique, Malawi and South Africa more than
10 years ago as a sixth-year student at National Taiwan University's
Department of Medicine.
</P>
<P>
Brian Hsieh who majored in Environmental Engineering and
Sanitation, is trained as a protector of the environment. He founded
the Yen-Lan Environmental Protection Service Co., Ltd. which disposes
of about 400,000 tons of waste a year, with revenue of NT$350
million.
</P>
<P>
Far from being complacent about his achievement, 28-year-old
Hsieh has vowed to expand his firm into the country's biggest waste
disposal company and the first of its kind to list its stocks on the
local bourse.
</P>
<P>
Chung-chih Wu earned his doctorate in electrical engineering from
Princeton in 1997 and returned to Taiwan to work as a researcher at
the Industry Technology Research Institute in Hsinchu before joining
the faculty of the NTU Electrical Engineering Department.
</P>
<P>
His research focuses on organic semiconductors for optoelectronic
and electronic devices, as well as flat panel displays.
</P>
<P>
Jungkai Chen, an associate professor of mathematics at the
National Taiwan University and a winner of the 2004 Academia Sinica
Prize for Young Scholars and Researchers, has set his sights on
becoming a world-recognized mathematician.
</P>
<P>
Tu Jia-jin started the System Integrated Pioneer Semiconductor
Co., Ltd. (SIPS) with capital of just NT$1 million, producing
systems-on-a-chip and soon captured the attention of world-renowned
IC designers who have placed orders with SIPS, creating a thriving
business that had bolstered the company's capital to NT$680 million
as of the end of 2004.
</P>
<P>
A Ph.D. from Cambridge University, Wun-shaing Wayne Chang takes
great interest and enjoyment in his work at the National Health
Research Institute in Taiwan as a postal-doctorate researcher. He
works 16-18 hours a day in his laboratory.
</P>
<P>
Wang Cheng-pang helped the ROC national team win a silver medal
in the group archery division in the Busan Asian Games when he was
just 15 and helped the ROC team bag a silver medal in the male group
event in the 2004 Athens Olympics at the age of 17.
</P>
<P>
Wang, now a senior at the Hualien Physical Education High School,
says he once planned to give up archery because of the tough and
tedious training. "But I became determined to continue after thinking
that I have been in this sport for so many years. I must redouble my
efforts because my dream of winning a gold medal at the 2008 Beijing
Olympic Games has yet to come true," he adds.

<TEXT>
<P>
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has
demanded an explanation from the Malaysian representative to Taiwan
over a recent incident in which a Taiwanese businessman was allegedly
detained by Malaysian police for 43 days without any evidence of his
having committed a crime in Malaysia, Foreign Minister Tan Sun Chen
said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Chen made the remarks while answering reporters' questions on the
incident at MOFA headquarters. He noted that according to preliminary
information the ministry has collected, the businessman has returned
to his home in Taichung County, central Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
The Malaysian police must have good reason for arresting any
Taiwanese citizen doing business in their country, Chen stressed, and
indicated that if the Malaysian police have made a mistake in
arresting the man, his ministry will demand an apology and
compensation.
</P>
<P>
The victim, identified as Chen Pao-chao, 48, spoke of his ordeal
Saturday at a news conference in Taichung, which he held along with
Taichung County Magistrate Huang Chung-shen and several legislators.
</P>
<P>
During the news conference, Chen, who deals in oil used for
religious purposes, claimed that he was arrested for alleged
drug-dealing Dec. 1 soon after his arrival in Kuala Lumpur on a
business trip.
</P>
<P>
He was detained for 43 days, during which period he was badly
mistreated by the police during a series of interrogations, Chen told
reporters.
</P>
<P>
Doctor Chen Kuo-tung of the Tung's General Hospital in Taichung,
who examined the businessman Jan. 15, said at the news conference
that the patient had lost 11 kilograms and had many bruises on his
chest, as well as serious injuries to his genitals.
</P>
<P>
Chen returned to Taiwan on Jan. 14 upon his release when the
Malaysian police could produce no evidence to show his involvement in
criminal activity.

U.S. CONGRESSMAN CONCERNED ABOUT TAIWAN'S DECLINING DEFENSE SPENDING
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Jan.  17  (CNA)
(By Huang Kwang-chun)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A visiting United States congressman
expressed concern Monday about Taiwan's declining defense
expenditure, saying that it is contrary to the country's national
interest.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a roundtable meeting held at the American Institute
in Taiwan's Taipei Office, Tom Lantos, who arrived in Taiwan Saturday
for a four-day visit, cited the current issue of the London-based
"Economist" showing that mainland China has continued to increase its
percentage of gross domestic product (GDP) devoted to defense while
Taiwan is decreasing its percentage. "I think this is inexcusable, "
he said.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan is a wealthy society and has US$250 billion in foreign
exchange reserves, Lantos went on, adding that despite this, it is
apparently incapable of deciding whether to spend US$18 billion
on its own defense.
</P>
<P>
Lantos was referring to a special arms procurement budget of
NT$610.8 billion (US$18.23 billion) presented by the Executive Yuan
to buy eight diesel-electric submarines, 12 PC-3 submarine-hunting
aircraft and six Patriot PAC-3 anti-missile batteries from the U.S.
over 15 years. The bill has been pending screening by the Legislative
Yuan for several months.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. congressman said that a recent Zogby poll shows that the
percentage of American citizens who would be prepared to defend
Taiwan by military means should it become necessary is declining.
</P>
<P>
"It is declining because the American people feel that the U.S.
is heavily engaged in both Afghanistan and Iraq," he explained.
</P>
<P>
He said, however, that "the American people are anxious and eager
to help people to help themselves."
</P>
<P>
To have the country spend a diminishing proportion of its GDP on
defense is a counter-productive policy, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
"I'm convinced the best way to secure peace is to have a capable
defense establishment," he said.

PROSECUTORS END PROBE OF PFP CHAIRMAN OVER EMBEZZLEMENT ALLEGATIONS
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Jan. 17 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The prosecutors in charge of a probe into
People First Party (PFP) Chairman James Soong over allegations that
he embezzled Kuomintang (KMT) funds during his term as KMT
secretary-general from 1989 to 1993, decided to close the case
without filing charges Monday.
</P>
<P>
Lin Pang-liang, a deputy chief prosecutor of the Prosecutors'
Office at the Taipei District Court said the three-year probe has
failed to turn up any new evidence that would reverse the office's
previous decision not to charge Soong.
</P>
<P>
Evidence presented by a lawyer who once worked for the KMT as
grounds for re-opening the investigation was either evidence already
examined or facts that would not justify charges being laid.
</P>
<P>
The decision, which was announced amid reports that the PFP will
cooperate with the ruling Democratic Progressive Party in the
Legislative Yuan gave rise to speculation that it is an olive branch
offered by the ruling party to Soong.
</P>
<P>
Ker Chien-min, the DPP convener at the Legislative Yuan, denied
that the decision has any political overtones and claimed that no-one
can pull the strings behind the prosecutors' investigation.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile PFP Legislator Liu Wen-hsiung said the decision has
vindicated Soong's claim that he did not do anything wrong and
although late, it is better late than never.
</P>
<P>
Lawyer Chuang Po-ling, who asked the Prosecutor's Office to
re-open the investigation in 2001 despite a KMT decision to respect
the prosecutors' decision not to pursue it further, called the
prosecutors' decision not to proceed with the probe "incredible."
</P>
<P>
He said it is regrettable that the Prosecutor's Office, which is
part of the administration, has decided to drop the case as an olive
branch to the opposition in step with the ruling DPP's efforts to
reconcile with the opposition parties.
</P>
<P>
He warned the opposition parties to wake up and resign themselves
to the general public's desire for political harmony and threatened
to come up with further new evidence to seek another re-opening of
the case.
</P>
<P>
The case dated back to Dec. 30, 1999 during the leadup to the
2000 presidential race in which Soong competed against KMT candidate
Lien Chan and President Chen Shui-bian, who ran on the DPP ticket.
</P>
<P>
KMT Legislator Chen Chao-nan filed a complaint that day with the
Prosecutor's Office at the Taipei District Court claiming that Soong
took NT$360 million (US$10.55 million at the time) from the KMT
coffers and stashed it in bank accounts opened under the names of
some of his relatives.
</P>
<P>
Soong argued that the funds were put in his charge by then-KMT
Chairman Lee Teng-hui for political purposes and offered to return
the funds to the KMT.
</P>
<P>
The case, which provided ammunition for Soong's rivals during the
heat of the presidential election, died down after Chen won the
election and the prosecutors decided not to pursue it Jan. 20,
2001. The KMT, led by Lien Chan at that time, decided not to appeal
against the decision.
</P>
<P>
However, Chuang, claiming that he had new evidence
against Soong, asked the prosecutors to re-open the investigation in
March 2001.
</P>
<P>
His appeal was approved and the probe was reopened April 3,
2001.

'319 REPORT' DISMISSED AS POLITICALLY MOTIVATED ABSURDITY
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Jan. 17 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Presidential Office dismissed Monday a
report on the March 19 shooting of President Chen Shui-bian, prepared
by an unconstitutional investigative commission, as an absurd
politically motivated assumption.
</P>
<P>
Chen Wen-chung, director of the Presidential Office's Public
Affairs Department, made the remarks after the opposition-dominated
"319 shooting investigation commission" issued its initial
investigative report that claimed Chen's abdominal wounds were not
caused by bullets discovered at the scene in the southern city of
Tainan March 19 and that the incident was staged to "manipulate" the
March 20 presidential election result. The report also suggests that
the Legislative Yuan come up with a proposal to recall the president
according to the law.
</P>
<P>
Chen said that as it stands, the "319 truth commission" is an
unconstitutional body according to a Dec. 15 interpretation by the
Council of Grand Justices.
</P>
<P>
Even before the constitutional interpretation was issued, Chen
said, all administrative agencies had rejected the controversial
commission's requests for access to official documents or evidence
over fears that the commission was unconstitutional and illegal.
</P>
<P>
"This indicates that the commission arrived at its assumption
without the support of any concrete documents or evidence. Its report
is outrageous and completely unacceptable," Chen said.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the commission was formed by only nine or 10
representatives named by the opposition "pan-blue alliance" of the
Kuomintang and the People First Party, Chen said its report was
politically motivated and no more than an unfounded assumption by a
few people.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the report, Lee Chun-yi, a ruling Democratic
Progressive Party legislative whip, said that if the
opposition-controlled legislature accepts the controversial
commission's suggestion to initiate a proposal to recall the
president, he believes that more than one million local people will
besiege the legislature to protest such an outrageous move.
</P>
<P>
Lee further said the 319 commission should stop operations
immediately since the grand justices have already declared it as an
unconstitutional body.
</P>
<P>
The March 19 shooting took place in Tainan, southern Taiwan, when
the president was aboard an open-topped jeep during a last-minute
vote-canvassing rally. The opposition "pan-blue alliance" claimed
that the incident was a political scheme to win sympathy votes in the
bitterly contested presidential election, although they have produced
no evidence whatsoever to support their allegation. Chen narrowly
wone re-election a day after the shooting.

`319 TRUTH COMMISSION' RECOMMENDS RECALL OF  PRESIDENT
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Jan.  17 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A commission conducting an investigation
into the March 19 shooting of President Chen Shui-bian and Vice
President Annette Lu recommended Monday that the Legislative Yuan
recall the president for "manipulating the presidential election."
</P>
<P>
At a news conference called by the "319 Truth Investigation
Commission, " commission spokeswoman Wang Ching-feng claimed that the
wound Chen suffered in the shooting was not caused by the bullet
found by the police at the shooting scene in Tainan City and that it
is "reasonable to conclude" that the incident was a campaign scheme
cooked up to influence the election.
</P>
<P>
Wang claimed the temperature of the lead-made bullets fired by
an unknown gunman in the shooting were not hot enough to melt the
jacket worn by the president and produce burning on the president's
belly.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, Wang said the commission also found there were no
bullet holes in the president's jacket and no blood stains on his
underwear, although the bullet was reported to have ended up between
the president's clothes and his body.
</P>
<P>
Based on this finding, Wang said the commission determined that
Chen's wound was not caused by the bullet alleged to have been used
in the shooting.
</P>
<P>
As to the motive for the shooting, Wang claimed that the "only
reasonable cause" was a campaign scheme.
</P>
<P>
She condemned the president, claiming that he ignored the
Constitution and the law by instigating his administration to boycott
the commission's investigation, resulting in a ridiculous case of
government versus the law, and she urged the legislature to initiate
a recall of the president and refer the government officials who
blocked the commission's investigation to the Control Yuan for
possible disciplining.
</P>
<P>
The mysterious shooting that took place on the eve of the March 20
presidential election has been at the center of a bitter political
struggle between the Demoractic Progressive Party (DPP) and the two
main opposition parties, the Kuomintang and People First Party, whose
candidates on a joint ticket were beaten by DPP Chairman Chen
Shui-bian by a narrow margin.
</P>
<P>
The two opposition parties, which control the Legislative Yuan,
insisted on setting up the commission to look into the shooting by
railroading a special statute through the legislature, but was
stonewalled by the DPP administration, which refused to give the time
of day to the commission after the Council of Grand Justices ruled
that it was unconstitutional.

<TEXT>
<P>
The Government Information Office (GIO)
denied Monday a rumor circulating via the Internet that President
Chen Shui-bian has a large sum of money deposited in overseas banks.
</P>
<P>
The GIO issued a statement after receiving reports from the
public that according to the rumor, three U.S. television networks --
CNN, ABC and FOX -- quoted Nov. 26 a report posted on the Web site of
the Washington Post that Chen has large deposits in overseas banks.
</P>
<P>
The GIO statement said that neither the three American TV
networks nor any other mass media have ever made such reports or
anything like them.
</P>
<P>
It is regrettable that someone would use such a fictional rumor
to smear and insult the country's head of state, the GIO noted,
warning that anyone caught committing libel will be brought to
justice.

MOFA SPEAKS ON DELIVERING RELIEF ABROAD USING MILITARY AIRCRAFT
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Jan.  18 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Delivering relief goods to tsunami-hit
countries by military aircraft is only one of the government's
options in its overseas aid work, a Ministry of Foreign Affairs
(MOFA) official said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
MOFA spokesman Michel Lu was responding to media reports that
Taiwan's military aircraft flew two sorties to Indonesia last week to
deliver relief supplies by covering up the Republic of China's
national emblem on the plane's fuselage and wing to avoid possible
protests from mainland China.
</P>
<P>
Noting that delivery of relief goods is mainly aimed at
demonstrating Taiwan's love and concern for tsunami victims, Lu said
MOFA is only responsible for negotiating administrative measures with
relevant foreign countries while actual delivery has to be carried
out by the Ministry of National Defense (MND).
</P>
<P>
Lu said he is not in a position to comment on technical details
regarding the relief supply delivery.
</P>
<P>
MOFA sources said the ministry has reached agreement with
Indonesian authorities to allow ROC military aircraft to transport
relief supplies to Indonesia, one of the hardest-hit countries from
the Dec. 26 earthquake and tsunamis.
</P>
<P>
As Taiwan doesn't maintain formal diplomatic ties with Indonesia,
the sources said, the government must adopt a pragmatic and flexible
strategy to allow for speedy delivery of relief goods to disaster
zones.
</P>
<P>
According to media reports, an ROC Air Force C-130H transport
flew two sorties to Indonesia Jan. 14 to deliver relief goods donated
by the ROC government and private groups. The plane reportedly made a
stopover at Singapore's Changi Airport for refueling. A military
aircraft spotter there reportedly took a picture of the plane. Media
reports said although the ROC's national symbol on the transport's
wing and fuselage had been covered up, it still could easily be
recognized as a military aircraft from Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Media reports said the military aircraft will also fly two
sorties this week to transport relief goods to Indonesia. MND
officials declined to make any comments on the reports.

OFFICIAL CALLS FOR EQUAL EMPHASIS ON BIRTH AND IMMIGRATION
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Jan.  18 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The government must equally encourage
childbirth and the formulation of constructive immigration policies
to ensure that Taiwan is prepared to face changing population
demographics, a senior official said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Yeh Jiuun-rong, chairman of the Cabinet-level Research,
Development and Evaluation Commission, made the remarks at a seminar
on Taiwan's new immigration policy for the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the steady decline in the birth rate in Taiwan and
the influx of migrant workers has given rise to very complicated
social problems, Yeh said Taiwan must tackle these challenges because
of their close relation to social, economic, environmental, medical
and educational developments and resources distribution.
</P>
<P>
Quoting the latest official tallies, Yeh said that one local
couple now gives birth to an average of 1.2 children, falling below
the ideal number of two children per couple.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Yeh said that one out of every eight babies were born
to a couple with one spouse being a foreigner (including people from
mainland China) ; one out of every three married couples involves a
foreign spouse and one out of every three foreign spouses hails from
mainland China.
</P>
<P>
In the 1950s, Yeh said, each local couple gave birth to an
average of seven children. The number dropped to five in the 1960s
and plunged to 2.1 in the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
If this rapid downward trend continues, Yeh said, Taiwan is
expected to register negative population growth by 2025. Against this
backdrop, he said, the government must adopt new strategies to cope
with population issues if Taiwan wants to sustain its GDP (gross
domestic product) growth.
</P>
<P>
In the past, Yeh said, the government's population policy focused
on birth and death rates and upgrading of education quality while
adopting a passive attitude toward immigration issues. The public has
also tended to hold negative views on immigration, paying attention
only to illegal immigrants and human smuggling operations.
</P>
<P>
From now on, Yeh said, the government must address the population
issue with new vision and approaches. In addition to encouraging
childbirth, he said, the government should simultaneously formulate
constructive, forward-looking immigration policies.
</P>
<P>
In the future, Yeh said, the government must also spend more on
research of major administrative issues, such as immigration and
anti-drug trafficking, to upgrade the quality of public policies.

MOFA SIGNS COOPERATIVE PACT WITH MERCY CORPS FOR TSUNAMI RELIEF
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  Jan.  18 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA)
signed a memorandum of understanding with Mercy Corps Tuesday on
cooperation in relief work in South Asian and Southeast Asian
countries affected by the Dec. 26 earthquake and tsunami.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was signed by Chiang Kuo-chiang, vice chairman of
the MOFA's NGO Affairs Committee, and Diana Tsui, chairwoman of Mercy
Corps' Asia-Pacific chapter, on behalf of the two sides.
</P>
<P>
Under the terms of the agreement, MOFA will donate US$250,000 to
the Indian Ocean Tsunami Emergency Relief Fund, which was set up by
Mercy Corps to help tsunami victims in Indonesia, India, Sri Lanka
and other tsunami-affected areas.
</P>
<P>
Mercy Corps is a noted U.S.-based non-government and
not-for-profit organization dedicated to humanitarian aid and
development activities. Taiwan previously cooperated with it in 2003
to help displaced war refugees in Iraq, Chiang said, adding that the
Iraq cooperative program has achieved satisfactory results.
</P>
<P>
This time around, Chiang said, Mercy Corps has agreed to
distribute relief goods donated by the Republic of China government
and private groups for delivery to the hardest-hit disaster zones.
</P>
<P>
"By cooperating with Mercy Corps, we hope our humanitarian aid
campaign can be integrated into the global tsunami relief programs, "
Chiang said.
</P>
<P>
For her part, Tsui said Mercy Corps will use the Taiwan-donated
fund wisely to help the tsunami survivors. Taiwan volunteers are also
welcome to take part in future relief work, she added.
</P>
<P>
The Mercy Corps' Indian Ocean Tsunami Emergency Relief Fund will
mainly finance middle- and long-term humanitarian aid programs in
tsunami-affected regions, with 80 percent used for health and medical
care, nutrition, drinking water, cleanup and sheltering programs, and
the remaining 20 percent used for service and assistance to
survivors' career-rebuilding, Tsui said, adding that in the next two
to three years, Mercy Corps will launch 20 aid programs, including
community reconstruction.
</P>
<P>
According to Tsui, major international relief organizations, such
as the Red Cross Society, have all stopped accepting relief goods
donation and now accept only cash donations to finance various aid
projects.
</P>
<P>
As of Jan. 17, Chiang said, MOFA had received more than NT$158
million and US$100,000 in cash donations and 220 tons of relief goods
for tsunami aid drives. Of the relief supplies, 180 tons have been
delivered to disaster zones in Indonesia and Sri Lanka.
</P>
<P>
"MOFA is grateful for local individuals and non-government
organizations for their enthusiastic response to the MOFA's
fund-raising moves," he added.

OPPOSITION  BLOCKS APPROVAL OF CONTROL YUAN MEMBERS
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Jan. 18 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The opposition in the legislature blocked
the ruling party's attempts Tuesday to put President Chen
Shui-bian's request to approve his nominees for members of the
Control Yuan on the agenda of its last sitting of this session.
</P>
<P>
The opposition-controlled Rules Committee also voted against
debating a bill on a controversial U.S. arms purchase bill at its
last sitting, which is set for Thursday.
</P>
<P>
That means the legislature won't exercise its power of approval
or act on the arms purchase bill until newly elect lawmakers are
sworn in on Feb. 1.
</P>
<P>
Since the terms of the incumbent members of the Control Yuan
expire at the end of January, the Control Yuan will have no members
after Feb. 1, the first time such a situation will have arisen since
the country's Constitution was adopted in 1946.
</P>
<P>
Lawmaker Tseng Yung-chuan, director of the opposition
Kuomintang's (KMT) Policy Coordination Committee, blamed the
president for nominating people who are so beneath the expectations
of the public that lawmakers could not in good conscience vote for
them.
</P>
<P>
As for the arms procurement bill, which will provide the legal
framework for the country's NT$610.8 billion (US$18.23 billion)
weaponry purchase from the United States, Tseng said his party
doesn't take issue with the arms purchase, as such, but it can't
agree with paying such an exorbitant price. The issue, Tseng added,
is best tackled by the new legislature.
</P>
<P>
Lawmaker Tsai Huang-liang, the whip of the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party Caucus at the Legislative Yuan, castigated the
opposition for triggering a constitutional crisis by failing to
approve the president's nominees before the deadline.
</P>
<P>
He also criticized the opposition for placing the country at risk
by repeatedly obstructing the bill for the arms purchase, saying that
Taiwan needs the weapons to protect itself should mainland China's
military attack, and the chance to acquiring these arms is too
valuable to miss.

</P>
<P>
Addressing the ceremony, Chen said the new Web site was built by

tapestry and national development.
</P>
<P>
Chen said the "Taipedia" will offer an efficient search engine
service for Web users to study all aspects of Taiwan, ranging from
major historical events, folk customs, culture, lifestyle and natural
ecology to resources and developments.
</P>
<P>
"Local people are welcome to provide entries concerning Taiwan to
help enrich the online encyclopedia," Chen said, adding that the Web
site will serve as a forum for new cultural discourse and public
debate to help foster new civic consciousness and shape a distinct
identity for Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Chen said the ambitious project is also aimed at showing the
world Taiwan's knowledge power and cultural strength.
</P>
<P>
The online version of the Taiwan Encyclopedia is scheduled to be
finalized in 2008 along with the opening of a planned world
exposition on the island, CCA officials said, adding that the
Internet encyclopedia is expected to collect 30,000 to 40,000 entries
concerning Taiwan, with a total of 24 million words.
</P>
<P>
The online encyclopedia will also be published in a printed
version of 20 volumes, the officials said, adding that there will
also be a condensed version catering to the need of teenagers and
young adults as well as an online English edition.

VICE FOREIGN MINISTER VISITS GERMANY

<TEXT>
<P>
Republic of China Vice Minister of Foreign
Affairs Michael Ying-mao Kau is visiting Germany to explain Taiwan's
stance on mainland China's proposed anti-secession law and a proposal
to lift an arms embargo against Beijing by the European Union, an
anonymous diplomatic source said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Kao, traveling at the head of a ROC delegation comprising
Mainland Affairs Council Vice Chairman Huang Wei-fong and Liu
Shih-fang, a former secretary-general of the Executive Yuan, met
figures from various German quarters Monday on a tight itinerary, the
source said.
</P>
<P>
In a news conference, Huang told German journalists that the
status quo of the Taiwan Strait is that there are two political
entities, one on either side of the strait.
</P>
<P>
Mainland China's proposed anti-secession law, however, would
unilaterally change the status quo because it defines the two sides
as a unified nation, he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Many polls have shown that an overwhelming majority of the people
of Taiwan are opposed to the anti-secession law, Huang went on,
warning that tension will increase in the Taiwan Strait if Beijing
enacts the legislation in March. Taiwan might enact a countermeasure
law if that happens, he explained.
</P>
<P>
Also, he continued, Beijing's hardliners may use the law to press
mainland Chinese President Hu Jintao's regime to legalize the use of
force to invade Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
With regard to the proposal to lift the arms embargo against the
mainland, Huang said the E.U. would seem to endorse Beijing's
Taiwan-targeting anti-secession law if it approves the proposal. It
would be harmful to regional peace and stability, the deputy chief of
the ROC's top mainland policy planning agency added.
</P>
<P>
Kao and his delegation visited Finland, Norway and the Czech
Republic before arriving in Germany, the source said, adding that
they will proceed to Luxemburg, France and Belgium in the coming
days.

two years of preparation.
</P>
<P>
The National Health Command Center (NHCC) will integrate

relief, Department of Health (DOH) officials said.
</P>
<P>
Kuo Hsu-sung, director of the DOH's Center for Disease Control,

that the Cabinet might name a provisional commander in the event of a
major natural disaster such as a serious typhoon or flood that could

CRITICS CONTINUE TO FIRE BROADSIDES AT 319 COMMISSION REPORT
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Jan.  18  (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Critics continued Tuesday to deliver
broadsides at the report released the previous day by a commission
formed to look into the March 19 shooting of President Chen
Shui-bian.
</P>
<P>
Both the administration of President Chen Shui-bian and the
ruling Democratic Progressive Party castigated the report of the 319
Truth Investigation Commission, which claimed that the shooting,
which took place on the eve of the presidential election, was a
scheme concocted to manipulate the election results.
</P>
<P>
The report also recommended that the Legislative Yuan initiate a
recall of the president for what it described as the president's
trampling of the Constitution and the law and for the Control Yuan to
discipline officials who refused to help with the commission's
investigation.
</P>
<P>
Huang Chih-fang, deputy secretary-general of the Presidential
Office, said the conclusions reached in the report are so far-fetched
and reckless that it gives rise to suspicion that the report could
have been swayed by politics.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the Council of Grand Justices has ruled that part of
the statute on which the commission was organized is
unconstitutional, Huang said the administration refused to provide
documents to the commission out of fear that doing so might also run
against the Constitution, so it is understandable that the report is
not well-based on fact.
</P>
<P>
He claimed that some of the report's conclusions are so
outlandish that only political bias can account for them.
</P>
<P>
He denied that the president was upset by the report, claiming
that the president has insisted on following the Constitution in
terms of the commission's formation and function and will not concern
himself with whatever conclusions the report might have reached.
</P>
<P>
Chen Chih-mai, the spokesman for the Executive Yuan, said that
any reasonable man would have difficulty agreeing with the
commission's report.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the commission has already been ruled as
unconstitutional by the Council of Grand Justices, and pointing out
that its conclusion contradicts the findings of the police and of
U.S. forensic expert Henry Lee, Chen said it allows for only one
explanation -- that the report is a politically charged move.
</P>
<P>
Citing the rule of the Council of the Grand Justices, Chen said
the commission members should have been appointed by the speaker of
the legislature after a resolution passed by the legislature.
However, it was not set up through this procedure
and is thereby unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
As for the commission's recommendation that the president be
ousted through a recall vote, Chen noted that the law forbids the
recall of the president or vice president until one year after they
have been sworn in, which means the president is immune from any
recall attempts before May 20 of this year.
</P>
<P>
DPP heavyweights joined the two officials in lambasting the
report Tuesday after a weekly meeting of the party's Central Standing
Committee.
</P>
<P>
Frank Hsieh, the mayor of Kaohsiung City, said the commission's
report is a deduction rather than a conclusion.
</P>
<P>
Su Tseng-chang, the secretary-general of the Presidential Office,
dismissed the report as "absurd, " saying it only proves that the
commission members have been blinded by their political bias and
their anger toward the president.
</P>
<P>
Yang Si-ching, a lawyer who once served as chief of the country's
bar association, said on a separate occasion Tuesday that the
commission's report carries no legal force at all, as the commission
has been ruled as unconstitutional.

REPORT OF INVESTIGATION COMMISSION TO BE DISCUSSED AT LEGISLATURE
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Jan. 18 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The opposition-controlled Rules Committee
of the Legislative Yuan decided Tuesday to put a report compiled by
an unconstitutional commission formed to investigate the March 19
shooting of President Chen shui-bian on the agenda of Thursday's
legislative sitting, to an outcry from the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP).
</P>
<P>
Acting DPP Chairman Ker Chien-ming said the decision is improper
because the report was delivered to the Secretariat of the
Legislative Yuan after the midday deadline for receiving possible
items on the agenda for Thursday's sitting.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the Rules Committee has ruled out many urgent bills
from the agenda of the session's last sitting while including the
report from an unconstitutional commission, Ker said the decision is
unacceptable.
</P>
<P>
He blamed Legislative Yuan President Wang Jin-pyng, who is a vice
chairman of the opposition Kuomintang (KMT) , for setting a bad
precedent by allowing the commission's report to jump the queue and
be squeezed into Thursday's agenda ahead of other more important
bills.
</P>
<P>
Dismissing as "absurd" the commission's recommendation to recall
the president, Ker said no political party would ever endorse the
idea and that the legislature should reject the report and put an end
to what has become a "political farce."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Legislator Liu Wen-hsiung, the convener of the
opposition People First Party (PFP) , which helped the KMT to set up
the commission, reserved his party's opinion on the commission's
report, saying that the PFP will consult public opinion before
responding.
</P>
<P>
However, he lauded the commission for soldiering on in defiance
of the Council of the Grand Justices, which ruled the commission
unconstitutional, and coming forward with its report.
</P>
<P>
"We will let the legal procedure run its course and let the next
legislature address the problem of the commission's
unconstitutionality, " Liu said, referring to the fact that the
current legislative session is set to close before the end of this
month.

<P>
The Presidential Office is hoping that the
Legislative Yuan will extend its current session and exercise its
right to approve the president's nominees for members of the Control
Yuan, Presidential Office Secretary-General Su Tseng-chang said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the legislature's failure to exercise its approval
right will mean that the country will have no Control Yuan members
after the incumbent members' terms fall due by the end of this month,
Su said this will prompt a constitutional crisis.
</P>
<P>
The opposition-controlled Legislative Yuan, which will expire by
the end of the month, refused to act on the president's nominees
during its last sitting, claiming that they are so far beneath the
expectations of the public that the lawmakers could not in good
conscience approve their nominations.

TAIWAN REMOVED FROM USTR'S SPECIAL 301 PRIORITY WATCH LIST

The Office of the U.S. Trade
Representative (USTR) removed Taiwan from its "Special 301 priority
watch list" Tuesday in recognition of the island's efforts and
progress in intellectual property rights (IPR) protection.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Trade Representative Robert Zoellick said that Taiwan's
efforts in cracking down on commercial piracy and counterfeit
products over the past year have been commendable.
</P>
<P>
Zoellick noted, however, that Taiwan can do a better job in
protection of patent and innovation rights on pharmaceutical products
and agrochemical products since the United States thinks that IPR
threats still exist in those areas.
</P>
<P>
He said that IPR protection is one of the prime elements behind
efforts to gear up the world's economic growth and that the United
States strongly requires that its trade partners strengthen their
laws to help maintain innovation in science and technology products.
</P>
<P>
The USTR announced the removal of Taiwan from the list in its
out-of-cycle Special 301 report Tuesday. Taiwan had been on the
"priority watch list" for four consecutive years dating back to 2001.
</P>
<P>
In the report, the USTR noted that Taiwan has made "significant
progress" in cracking down on commercial piracy and passing IPR
protection legislation over the past year.
</P>
<P>
The report pointed out that Taiwan authorities need to step up
efforts in protection of patent and innovation rights on
pharmaceutical products, further strengthen IPR laws pertaining to
agrochemical products, and intensify the crackdown on Internet MP3
downloading and other commercial piracy.

KMT PUTS FORWARD INITIATIVE TO WELCOME FORMER MEMBERS BACK INTO PARTY
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Jan.  19 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Central
Standing Committee met Wednesday and reached a consensus on welcoming
former members who left the party due to political differences back
into the KMT.
</P>
<P>
The initiative, to be implemented by the KMT Organization
Development Committee, has been interpreted as a move to welcome
opposition People First Party (PFP) Chairman James Soong back into
the KMT fold.
</P>
<P>
Soong was expelled from the KMT in 2000 after a fallout with the
party leadership and then ran for the Republic of China presidency
the same year. Chin Chin-sheng, Soong's top aide at the time, was
also ousted from the party.
</P>
<P>
In a statement, the KMT Organization Development Committee said
that over the past several years, many KMT members have left the
party due to opposition to moves made by former KMT Chairman Lee
Teng-hui. It's time for them to return to the KMT now that Lee has
not been associated with the party for a long period of time, the
committee officials said.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the initiative, Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou, who is a
vice chairman of the KMT, said that it could serve as "belated
justice" for Soong, to whom the KMT at least owes an apology.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, PFP spokesman Hsieh Kung-ping called the initiative
"appropriate and reasonable."
</P>
<P>
Liu Wen-hsiung, a PFP party whip at the Legislative Yuan, said
the initiative is a "goodwill" gesture, but he added that the KMT
must abandon "the Lee path" it has been following if it is serious
about closer collaboration with the PFP.

</P>
<P>
The officials said that Taiwan's lack of protection of
pharmaceutical data exclusivity is to blame for the island's not
having been removed from the Special 301 watch list once and for all.
</P>
<P>
They said that the Department of Health completed a draft bill on
the issue last year but the bill has remained on the Legislative Yuan
shelf awaiting screening and passage.
</P>
<P>
The officials said that Taiwan's efforts in IPR protection will
not relent, even though legislation has not yet been passed.
</P>
<P>
It is hoped that Taiwan will be removed from the Special 301
watch list altogether in April this year when the USTR conducts its
annual review, the officials added.

TAIWAN TO TEMPORARILY SUSPEND IMPORT OF VIETNAMESE CAREGIVERS
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Jan.  19  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Council of Labor Affairs (CLA)
announced Wednesday that imports of Vietnamese caregivers will be
temporarily suspended from Thursday because of the high absconding
rate of this category of Vietnamese workers.
</P>
<P>
However, CLA officials said, the temporary import ban will not
affect directly hired Vietnamese whose local employers agree to
rehire them after their three-year work contracts expire.
</P>
<P>
The officials said the CLA was forced to impose the temporary ban
because the number of runaway Vietnamese caregivers remains high.
Although the Vietnamese representative office in Taipei has been
assisting in tracking down absconded Vietnamese workers, the number
of people captured has fallen short of the target.
</P>
<P>
According to the officials, Vietnamese authorities originally
promised to track down 2,000 Vietnamese runaways by the end of last
year. However, only some 900 had been seized as of the end of
December.
</P>
<P>
In recognition of Vietnamese authorities' efforts, the officials
said, the CLA will just close Taiwan's door to Vietnamese caregivers
for the time being.

</P>
<P>
"We have avoided using the term 'freeze' to minimize the impact
of the measure," a CLA official said, adding that the use of the term
"temporary suspension" also marks the CLA's recognition of Vietnam's
cooperation in tracking down runaways.
</P>
<P>
The official said Vietnam has come up with new plans for tracking
down runaways and curtailing a further increase in absconding. The
intensified search for absconders will continue through the end of
March and if they generate satisfactory results, the official said,
the temporary import ban can be lifted.

The Times: The Army's shame.

Bound, blindfolded and tied in a net, an Iraqi prisoner lies
helpless on bare concrete at a British base near Basra. Crouching
with a pool of water at his feet, he is powerless as a British
soldier stands on him. Lance Corporal Darren Larkin appears to be
pretending to surf on his victim, seemingly unaware that he is in a
country where even the slightest contact with the soles of the feet
is regarded as a grave insult. At least three comrades from the 1st
Battalion The Royal Regiment of Fusiliers look on, two taking
photographs. The image will cause outrage across the Arab world and
severely undermine the reputation of the British Army. General Sir
Mike Jackson, Chief of the General Staff, took the extraordinary step
of issuing a personal statement to condemn any abuse by British
soldiers. The photograph was one of 22 presented yesterday at the

PACIFIC-RIM OUTRIGGER CANOE VOYAGE TO KICK OFF IN MAY
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Jan. 19 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An experimental voyage by outrigger canoe
around the Pacific Rim is scheduled to begin from Indonesia in May in
an attempt to revive the spirit of the Austronesian people who have
plied the Pacific Ocean over the past several thousand years.
</P>
<P>
The Civilization Explorer Association of the Republic of China,
in collaboration with a Japanese adventurer, launched the Navigation
Plan to Rebuild Pacific Rim Communications Wednesday at a press
conference in Taipei. They hope to complete the ambitious voyage over
an 18-month period.
</P>
<P>
Outrigger canoes have been used for thousands of years by the
Austronesian people all over the Pacific. A wooden structure fixed to
the side of a small boat makes the craft sturdy enough to allow it to
be navigated even in stormy conditions.
</P>
<P>
The voyage, considered to be a move toward a Pacific cultural
renaissance, will be completed by six sailors from Taiwan, Japan, the
Philippines, Indonesia, Malaysia and Tahiti, said Chen Chin-kuo, head
of the association.
</P>
<P>
The project is also designed to verify the possibility of whether
early Austronesians sailed eastward from Easter Island to South
America, said Chen.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan is part of the huge Austronesian-language group, which
probably underwent the widest physical dispersion of a single
language family prior to the European colonial expansion following
Columbus, from the island of Madagascar off the east coast of Africa
all the way to the tiny, isolated Easter Island (Rapa Nui) and
extending to Taiwan, Vietnam, Northern Australia, New Zealand and
most of the Melanesian and Polynesian islands.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 300 million people are currently living in these areas.
</P>
<P>
According to a genome analysis, genes of the Japanese people
during the prehistoric Jomon Era, the ancient Taiwanese aboriginal
people and the ancient Incan people from South Africa and Peru are
genetically identical. But so far, no historical archive have been
found to prove that the Austronesian people ever sailed east all the
way from Easter Island to South America, according to the Japanese
maritime adventurer Yoshiyuki Yamamoto.
</P>
<P>
In addition to adding to the body of knowledge of Asian maritime
history, the project is also aimed at consolidating an esprit de
corps among the people around the Pacific Rim and heightening
environmental protection awareness, particularly in the wake of the
Dec. 26 magnitude 9 earthquake and ensuing tsunami that have killed
at least 160,000 people in South Asia and Southeast Asia, Yamamoto
said.
</P>
<P>
He said the most dangerous part of the voyage will be the sail
from Tahiti via Easter Island to Peru and that the most challenging
task could be forging teamwork among the six prospective crew
members, who all speak different languages.
</P>
<P>
Tsang Chen-hua, director of the Taitung-based National Museum of
Prehistory, said that Taiwan-based Austronesians began to cruise
toward the south some 5,000 years ago, marking one of the largest
exoduses in human history.
</P>
<P>
The Navigation Plan to Rebuild Pacific Rim Communication, Tsang
said, will have four major perspectives -- verifying that the
Austronesians moved south from Taiwan, reviving the Austronesians'
navigation skills, re-living the early Austronesians' dreams of
home-building, and demonstrating the Austronesian people's ability to
live peacefully with the ocean.
</P>
<P>
An outrigger canoe about eight meters long designed in accordance
with ancient designs is being built by a group of native shipbuilders
on Sulawesi Island in Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
The plan is scheduled to be completed in August 2006 when the
outrigger canoe returns to Taitung, eastern Taiwan, Tsang added.
</P>
<P>
In related news, the National Museum of Prehistory in Taitung
acquired in December 2004 a new outrigger canoe built in Palau in an
effort to enrich the museum's collections.
</P>
<P>
The seven-seat outrigger was built by shipbuilders appointed in
person by Palau President Tommy Remengesau, said Tsang.

<TEXT>
<P>
Academia Sinica President Lee Yuan-tseh
arrived in Washington, D.C. Tuesday to attend the Jan. 20
inauguration of U.S. President George W. Bush on behalf of President
Chen Shui-bian.
</P>
<P>
Lee, a co-winner of the 1986 Nobel Prize in chemistry, said his
main mission is to convey Chen's congratulations on Bush's
re-election.
</P>
<P>
As for Taiwan-U.S. relations, Lee said he is not versed in
relevant issues but he added that he thinks regular dialogue and
communications are needed to boost bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
Lee said he has met with Bush on several previous occasions and
feels Bush to be an affable and charismatic person. Lee has attended
the annual informal leadership meeting of the Asia-Pacific Economic
Cooperation forum on behalf of Chen for the past few years, where he
has invariably held talks with Bush.
</P>
<P>
The Taiwan delegation to Bush's inauguration also includes
Mainland Affairs Council Chairman Joseph Wu, Yang-Huang Mei-hsin,
director of the Research and Planning Board of the Ministry of
Foreign Affairs, Hsu Su-chien, an Academia Sinica assistant
researcher and Lo Chih-cheng, executive director of the National
Policy Research Institute. The four delegates arrived in the U.S.
capital Monday.
</P>
<P>
Unlike Lee, the four delegates have other missions besides
attending Bush's inauguration ceremony. They will meet with U.S.
congressional members and think tank scholars to exchange views on
mainland China's proposed anti-secession legislation targeting Taiwan
and other matters of mutual concern.

INBOUND VISITORS UP 31.2 PERCENT IN 2004
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei, Jan. 19 (CNA)

<TEXT>
<P>
The number of inbound visitors reached 2.95
million in 2004, marking a whopping 31.2 percent increase from the
year-earlier level, the Directorate-General of Budget, Accounting and
Statistics (DGBAS) said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The steep rise could be attributed to the general economic
recovery last year and a relatively low number of foreign visitors in
2003 due to outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome
(SARS) between March and June that year, DGBAS officials said.
</P>
<P>
Japan remained the largest source of inbound visitors, with
887,000 Japanese citizens visiting Taiwan in 2003.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Taiwan people made 7.78 million overseas visits in
2003, up 35 percent from the year-earlier level. Hong Kong was the
most popular travel destination, with Taiwan people making 2.56
million visits to the former British colony for a robust 37 percent
year-on-year growth.

ARMS PROCUREMENT BUDGET TO BE ADJUSTED DOWNWARD: MINISTER
</HEADLINE>

<P>
The Ministry of National Defense will come
up with a revised budget bill to be submitted by the new Legislative
Yuan to be inaugurated Feb. 1, Minister of National Defense Lee Jye
said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Lee made the remarks a day after the opposition-controlled
outgoing legislature failed to put the defense ministry-proposed arms
procurement budget bill on the agenda of its last plenary session
scheduled for Friday.
</P>
<P>
"We have come to understand that the special arms procurement
bill cannot clear the legislature during the current session. The
defense ministry will adjust downward the amount required for the
purchase of three advanced weapons from the United States and will
refer the revised version to the new legislature for approval, " Lee
said.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to changes in the currency exchange rate and the decision
that the eight diesel-electric submarines will not be built in
Taiwan, Lee said the budget required for the long-stalled arms
procurement package will fall below previous estimates.
</P>
<P>
"We hope new legislators can support the amended arms procurement
budget bill as early as possible to facilitate the military's arsenal
renovation plan in the face of mainland China's ever-mounting
military threat," Lee said.
</P>
<P>
Some opposition lawmakers have called for NT$150 billion to
NT$200 billion to be cut from the defense ministry-proposed budget
for the procurement package. Lee declined to make any comments on the
proposal, saying that the time is not right to talk about any
concrete figure.
</P>
<P>
The package includes the purchase of eight diesel-electric
submarines, a squadron of 12 submarine-hunting P-3C Orion aircraft
and six Patriot PAC-III anti-missile batteries.

TAIWAN WILL KEEP LOW PROFILE IN POST-TSUNAMI RELIEF: PRESIDENT
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Jan.  19 (CNA)
(By Luis Huang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President Chen Shui-bian said Wednesday
that since Taiwan is in a very difficult diplomatic situation, the
nation will keep a low-profile while delivering relief materials to
South and Southeast Asian countries affected by the Dec. 26 earthquake
and resulting tsunamis.
</P>
<P>
Chen made the remarks while addressing an award presentation
ceremony at the Tainan County Cultural Center, during which he
presented "Phoenix Awards" to 30 outstanding fire fighters.
</P>
<P>
According to media reports, Taiwan's military aircraft flew two
sorties to Indonesia last week to deliver relief supplies and covered
up the Republic of China's national emblem on the plane's fuselage
and wing to avoid possible protests from mainland China.
</P>
<P>
As the Beijing authorities spare no efforts to deter Taiwan from
participating in international affairs, Chen pointed out that the
government should keep a low profile in offering humanitarian aid to
tsunami-hit countries.
</P>
<P>
Noting that love and humanitarian aid have no boundaries, Chen
said that the government will try any feasible approach to deliver
all relief goods donated by the public and private sectors to
disaster zones to demonstrate Taiwan's love and concern for tsunami
victims.
</P>
<P>
Chen voiced the hope that all 170 metric tons of relief material
donated by the government and private groups will be transported to
tsunami-affected countries by Jan. 28. 

</P>
<P>
The president further said that Taiwan has promised to donate
US$50.25 million to assist in post-tsunami reconstruction work in
disaster regions and has dispatched about 400 relief workers to
disaster zones since the Dec. 26 catastrophe. In addition, the nation
will also sponsor 10,000 tsunami-affected children for one year, he
said.
</P>
<P>
In related news, 20 groups of young students from domestic
Buddhist institutions, led by Fokuangshan masters, will travel on
foot in various parts of Taiwan starting from Thursday to raise money
to help tsunami-affected children in South and Southeast Asian
countries.
</P>
<P>
All duty free shops at the Chiang Kai-shek International Airport
began a series of charity sales, which will run through Jan. 31,
while Tungshih Senior High School in Chiayi County delivered all
donations from its teachers and students for tsunami victims to World
Vision Taiwan.

GOVERNMENT AIMS TO CREATE EXTENSIVE MOBILE COMMUNICATIONS BY 2008
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Jan.  19 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The government plans to make mobile
communications networks ubiquitous in the country by 2008 under a
project called "Mobile Taiwan, " according to officials of the
Science and Technology Advisory Group (STAG) of the Executive Yuan.
</P>
<P>
The "Mobile Taiwan" project forms part of the "10 new major
construction programs" initiated by the Executive Yuan to make Taiwan
into a "green silicon island" within six years, the STAG officials
said.
</P>
<P>
Lin Feng-ching, deputy convener of the STAG, said that the
government hopes to transform the country by setting up the basic
infrastructure needed to create a system whereby cellular phone
network services, information technology computer platforms and
broadband Internet links would be combined.
</P>
<P>
So far, the government has earmarked NT$7 billion (US$219
million) for the establishment of public WLAN (wireless local area
networking) and application services, NT$30 billion for local
authorities to build a total of 6,000 kilometers of broadband fixed
Internet links and "10 mobile cities" plus "15 special mobile
districts" around Taiwan by 2008.
</P>
<P>
The "10 mobile cities" plan will provide 8 million subscribers
across Taiwan with easy access to the Internet through WLAN and their
mobile phones anywhere in Taiwan, turning the nation into the world's
fifth most competitive country in terms of e-business applications.
This in turn, it is hoped, will boost tourism, help maintain public
order and better manage traffic.
</P>
<P>
According to Lin, the result will be a "triple win" -- for
consumers, the government and businesses -- and will help the
government develop the telecommunications industry into a key sector,
along with the semiconductor and panel display sectors, capable of
yielding an annual production value of more than NT$1 trillion.

THREE BROTHERS WITH ALD DISEASE HEAD FOR U.S. FOR TREATMENT
</HEADLINE>

Kaohsiung,  Jan.19  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Three brothers suffering from a rare
degenerative disease known as adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD) left for the
United States Wednesday for treatment after local people donated
millions of dollars to cover their medical expenses.
</P>
<P>
Their parents, who accompanied their sons on the medical journey,
posted a "thank you" letter on the Kaohsiung City Government's Web
site prior to their departure, expressing their heartfelt gratitude
for the more than 25,000 local people who have donated money to the
family.
</P>
<P>
"Without your generous donations, this medical trip would have
remained just a pipedream," the couple said in their online letter.
</P>
<P>
Chang Ming-hui, the three brothers' father who is a Kaohsiung
City Government staff member, said he will regularly post his sons'
medical expense receipts on the Internet to allow those who are
concerned about his sons' situation to get the latest information.
</P>
<P>
Chang said previously the family would keep US$1 million to cover
the medical expenses and use the remaining donations to set up a
foundation to help other local ALD sufferers.
</P>
<P>
The three brothers will receive bone marrow transplants at
Minnesota State University's medical center, Chang said, adding that
his eldest son, Chien-hsuan, will receive the transplant first and
then the youngest son. As to the timing for bone marrow transplant
for his second son, who is already paralyzed, Chang said it will
depend on the doctor's decision.
</P>
<P>
The Chang family is scheduled to stay in Minnesota for six
months to a year depending on the progress of the treatment.
</P>
<P>
China Airlines sent staff members to assist the family in packing
their luggage early in the morning. The Changs' relatives and friends
as well as Chien-hsuan's teacher and classmates visited their home in
Kaohsiung's Tsoying district to bid farewell and give their best
wishes.
</P>
<P>
ALD is a rare genetic disorder, in which the fatty myelin
"insulation" around nerves breaks down. The disease was brought to
public attention largely thanks to the 1992 film "Lorenzo's Oil, "
which was based on the true story of an American couple's search for
a cure for their ALD-afflicted son.

One day after Chen urged the legislature to extend the session,
Huang Teh-fu, secretary of the KMT caucus at the Legislative Yuan,
said that even an extraordinary legislative session would not be able
to approve the nominees before Jan. 31, when the terms of the
incumbent Control Yuan members expire.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the Legislative Yuan is set to go into recess Jan.
22 before the terms of the lawmakers expire at the end of January,
Huang said any extra session has to be crammed in between Jan. 22 and
Jan. 30, so that the time is too short to finish the approval
process.
</P>
<P>
Huang said the opposition parties refuse to exercise their
approval rights, claiming that the president has disappointed the
public and has raised the eyebrows of almost every political party by
naming some unpopular politicians as candidates.
</P>
<P>
Huang said the president has only himself to blame, adding that
while the opposition asked the president to withdraw the nominees
before Jan. 10 and come up with a new list but, he brushed aside the
request.
</P>
<P>
Huang urged the president to redraw his list and present it to
the legislature when the new lawmakers gather for their first session
in February.
</P>
<P>
Legislator Lu Hsuei-chang, PFP deputy caucus convener at the
Legislative Yuan, said it is unnecessary to call an extraordinary
legislative session for approving the nominees of the Control Yuan.
</P>
<P>
He rebutted the DPP's claims that the lack of new members of the
Control Yuan after the current term expires will give rise to a
Constitutional crisis, saying the national examination, which used to
be supervised by the Control Yuan, can be put back for a while
without compromising anyone's interests.
</P>
<P>
Only the DPP's political ally, the Taiwan Solidarity Union,
supported the idea of an extraordinary session.
</P>
<P>
TSU caucus convener at the Legislative Yuan Huang Tsung-yuan said
the lawmakers might vote against the president's specific nominees,
whom they consider unfit for the Control Yuan, but should not shirk
their duty of saying yes or no to his choices.

PRESIDENT ENCOURAGES ORCHID GROWERS TO INNOVATE

<TEXT>
<P>
President Chen Shui-bian called on domestic
orchid growers Wednesday to intensify innovation, research and
development, and international marketing to make Taiwan a "kingdom of
orchids."
</P>
<P>
Chen made the appeal while visiting an orchid exposition that
opened at the Taiwan Orchid Biotechnology Park in the southern county
of Tainan.
</P>
<P>
Innovation, research and development as well as international
marketing are essential to increasing the global market share of
Taiwan-cultivated flowers, especially after the nation's entry into
the World Trade Organization, Chen said.
</P>
<P>
"Only by creating our own brands can we achieve the goal of
building Taiwan into a 'kingdom of orchids, '" Chen stressed, adding
that organizing expositions is one of the best marketing approaches.
</P>
<P>
Chen also thanked the Cabinet-level Council of Agriculture, the
Tainan County Government and the private sector for their concerted
efforts to push for the establishment of the orchid park.
</P>
<P>
Inspired by Taiwan's successful hosting of an Asia-Pacific orchid
show last year, Chen voiced the hope that agriculture officials will
do their utmost to bid for hosting the 2011 International Orchid
Exposition in Tainan County.

HOLIDAY CHARTER FLIGHTS CONDUCIVE TO CROSS-STRAIT EXCHANGES: MAC

<P>
The successful negotiation for the special
cross-Taiwan Strait charter flights during the upcoming Chinese Lunar
New Year holiday has laid a good foundation for future cross-strait
engagements, a senior mainland affairs official said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"The spirit of shelving disputes and demonstrating pragmatism and
flexibility shown in the recent holiday charter flight negotiation
is conducive to future cross-strait exchanges," Mainland Affairs
Council Vice Chairman Chiu Tai-san said while addressing a meeting
organized by a local business club.
</P>
<P>
If mainland China can uphold this spirit in interacting with
Taiwan, Chiu said, cross-strait relations will improve greatly in the
future.
</P>
<P>
According to a landmark deal reached in Macau last Saturday by
Taiwan and mainland negotiators, six carriers from each side will
jointly operate 48 direct, non-stop charter flights during the
period from Jan. 29 and Feb. 20 between Taipei/Kaohsiung in Taiwan
and Shanghai/Beijing/Guangzhou in mainland China for the convenience
of Taiwan businessmen operating on the mainland who wish to return
for the Lunar New Year celebrations.

SHANGHAI AIRLINES APPLIES FOR CHARTER FLIGHTS WITH TAIWAN

<TEXT>
<P>
Shanghai Airlines has applied for Taiwan's
permission to participate in the special charter flights for
mainland-based Taiwan businessmen between destinations on the two
sides during the coming Chinese New Year holidays, a government
official said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
According to Minister of Transportation and Communications Lin
Ling-san, Shanghai Airlines has contacted the Civil Aeronautics
Administration (CAA) through the Taipei-based EVA Airways Corporation
(EVA Air) in regard to the charter flights on the Shanghai-Taipei
route on Jan. 29, Feb. 5 and Feb. 17.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the mainland's Air China, China Southern
Airlines, China Eastern Airlines, Hainan Airlines and Xiamen Airlines
will also take part in the services.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the leading Taiwan carriers, China Airlines and EVA
Air, are expected to be the first ones based in Taiwan to file
applications with the CAA and the General Administration of Civil
Aviation of China for the special charter services designated to
operate from Jan. 29 to Feb. 20.
</P>
<P>
The service will be confined only to Taiwan business people and
their families, a move that has upset many Taiwan students studying
in the mainland.
</P>
<P>
Negotiators from the two sides of the Taiwan Strait reached a
final agreement last Saturday in Macau, stipulating that six carriers
from either side may fly to accommodate returning business people for
the Feb. 9 Chinese New Year holiday on the model of "non-stop,
round-trip and multi-destinations."
</P>
<P>
The carriers of each side will be permitted to offer 24 round
trips between Taiwan's Taipei and Kaohsiung and the mainland's
Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou via Hong Kong's airspace.
</P>
<P>
The ground-breaking agreement will see mainland carriers land on
Taiwan soil for the first time in more than 50 years since the two
sides of the Taiwan Strait split in 1949 after a civil war.
</P>
<P>
The cross-strait Chinese New Year charter flights took off for
the first time in 2003, involving only six Taiwan aviation companies.
But the service was not continued the next year as a result of
Beijing's refusal to negotiate its demand that mainland carriers also
be allowed to take part in the service.

'319 COMMISSION' DISSOLVES ITSELF CLAIMING MISSION ACCOMPLISHED
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Jan.  19 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The "319 Truth Investigation Commission"
decided Wednesday to dissolve itself after a meeting of its members,
claiming that it has completed its mission.
</P>
<P>
The commission said in a news release that it is now up to the
Legislative Yuan to decide whether or how to continue the
investigation of the March 19 shooting of President Chen Shui-bian.
</P>
<P>
The commission said it is regrettable that the only Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) member on the commission, Tsai Wen-ping, was
stripped of his DPP membership for serving on the commission,
claiming it proves that the DPP will do anything to scuttle the
investigation.
</P>
<P>
Tsai had his DPP membership suspended by the party at the end of
last year for joining the commission in defiance of the party's ban
on its members doing so.
</P>
<P>
The DPP has warned Tsai that he would be kicked out of the party
if he didn't quit after the commission was declared unconstitutional
by the Council of Grand Justices.
</P>
<P>
The Council of Grand Justices ruled on Dec. 15, and the DPP
followed through on its threat by expelling Tsai.
</P>
<P>
Tsai brushed aside the DPP's decision Wednesday, saying he
wouldn't bother to appeal the decision as is his right according to
DPP regulations.
</P>
<P>
The commission was formed on Oct. 4, 2004 according to a
controversial statute crafted on the opposition's terms to look into
the March 19 shooting, which the opposition strongly suspects was a
political scheme concocted to help Chen win the March 20 presidential
election.
</P>
<P>
The DPP not only forbade its members to serve on the commission,
it also boycotted the commission's work by ordering its
administration not to help with the investigation.
</P>
<P>
The commission, however, issued a report Monday, claiming that
the shooting was a campaign scheme aimed to influence the result of
the presidential election and the president should be recalled for
"trampling on the Constitution and the law."

TAIWAN HOPES TO MINIMIZE IMPACT OF CLAIMS OF DUMPING VIA WTO

<P>
To restrict the damage to Taiwan business
interests arising from anti-dumping regulations by other countries,
Taiwan will pay extra heed to anti-dumping issues in the coming
rounds of Doha talks overseen by the World Trade Organization (WTO) ,
a government official said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Wu Shing-hua, deputy director-general of the Bureau of Foreign
Trade (BOFT) under the Ministry of Economic Affairs, said that the
government is poised to protect the interests of Taiwan's
export-oriented economy.
</P>
<P>
According to WTO statistics, Taiwan was subject to anti-dumping
measures by other countries in 138 cases over the past 10 years --
the fourth-most cited nation. India complained the most at 27 times
against Taiwan, followed by the United States with 17.
</P>
<P>
Yen Ching-chang, Taiwan's permanent representative to the WTO,
said that it will undoubtedly greatly benefit the country should
relevant anti-dumping rules set by the world trade regulatory body be
modified. He promised to do his best to promote Taiwan's trade
interests in this field under the WTO framework.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Taiwan and India are slated to hold talks in February
in New Delhi to settle their anti-dumping disputes through WTO
mechanisms.

TAIPEI 101 OBSERVATION DECK OPENS NEW VISTAS FOR VISITORS

<TEXT>
<P>
They say that on a clear day you can see
forever, and 2,256 people got the chance to test that old saw
Wednesday as the first people to visit the newly opened observation
deck on the 89th floor of the world's tallest building, Taipei 101.
</P>
<P>
The deck is 382.2 meters above the ground and riding the world's
fastest elevator that goes up at nearly 60 kph, it takes only 38
seconds to get to the observation deck.
</P>
<P>
The air pressure in the high-speed elevator is
computer-controlled to ensure that there is no ear-popping due to
pressure changes.
</P>
<P>
Although the deck was open after 1 p.m., a line of visitors
formed at the entrance of the building at 5 a.m., and a local visitor
waited for about seven hours to buy the first ticket.
</P>
<P>
Through binoculars mounted on the deck, vistiors can see the
coastline of Tanshui, a small town about 20 kilometers away at the
estuary of the Tanshui River.
</P>
<P>
In the beginning, the deck will only be open between 1 p.m. and
7 p.m., and the number of visitors will be limited to ensure an
uncrowded and laid-back atmosphere. Because of this, many visitors
were turned away at the entrance Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The visitors Wednesday spent an average of an hour and a half on
the deck, with about a third of them foreigners.
</P>
<P>
Managers of the building predicted that more visitors will get
the chance to use the deck after its opening time is extended to 10
a.m. to 10 p.m. on March 1.

The Control Yuan asked the Executive Yuan
Wednesday to fix what it calls the flaws in the direct shipping and
trade links between the country's two frontline islands of Kinmen,
Matsu and mainland China, the so-called "mini three links". 
</P>
<P>
In a resolution, the Control Yuan said the Executive Yuan failed
to inspect the quality of mainland foods and herbs funnelled into
Taiwan via Kinmen and Matsu, putting the health of the public
at risk.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, the resolution said the products allowed by the
Ministry of Economic Affairs to be imported from the mainland didn't
meet the needs of the residents of Kinmen and Matsu, which has led to
a booming contraband business.
</P>
<P>
The ministry's ban on transportation of materials needed by
Taiwan businessmen residing on the mainland through the mini-links
has resulted in a thriving underground transportation business
across the Taiwan Strait, said the Control Yuan.

FO GUANG GROUP LAUNCHES FUND-RAISING WALK FOR TSUNAMI ORPHANS

<TEXT>
<P>
Several educational
institutes and groups under the Buddhist Foguangshan Monastery
launched a one-day fund-raiser islandwide Thursday for South Asian
children orphaned in the tsunami disaster in late December.
</P>
<P>
A total of 20 Fo Guang teams embarked on the fund-raising walk
from 17 locations around the island at 9 a.m. Thursday, with the aim
of raising at least US$50,000 by nightfall.
</P>
<P>
The Foguangshan Monastery will use the money to establish a
foundation for the building of orphanages in areas affected by the
tsunami tragedy.
</P>
<P>
In Chiayi City, a group of students and faculty members from
Nanhua University, headed by university president Chen Miao-sheng,
embarked on the fund-raising walk from a temple located in the
downtown area. They plan to walk at least eight kilometers around the
city during the day.
</P>
<P>
Chen said that although relief aid has poured into countries
affected by the tsunami disaster, children orphaned in the tragedy
need special care. He added that Taiwan should not be absent from
this kind of relief effort.
</P>
<P>
The Fu Guang Group will build orphanages around the region to
directly care for the children who were orphaned or displaced, he
said.
</P>
<P>
According to Chen, the Fo Guang Monastery maintains affiliates in
Thailand, Malaysia and India, so the funds that it raises in Taiwan
can be directly channeled into these tsunami affected Asian countries
without the help of any governmental organization.

THREE CARRIERS APPLY FOR NEW YEAR CROSS-STRAIT CHARTER FLIGHTS
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei, Jan. 20 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Three airlines have applied to offer direct
cross-strait charter flights for mainland-based Taiwan businesspeople
during the upcoming Chinese New Year holidays, the Civil Aeronautics
Administration (CAA) reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Mainland China's Shanghai Airlines and Taiwan's two leading
carriers, China Airlines and EVA Airways, are the first three
airlines to file applications with the CAA to offer special charter
services for the Jan. 29-Feb. 20 period, CAA officials said.
</P>
<P>
Negotiators from the two sides of the Taiwan Strait reached an
agreement Dec. 8 in Macau to allow a total of six carriers from
either side to offer flight services to accommodate returning Taiwan
business people for the Feb. 9 Chinese New Year holiday on the
"non-stop, round-trip, multi-destinations" model.
</P>
<P>
The carriers will be permitted to offer a total of 24 roundtrip
flights between Taipei or Kaohsiung in Taiwan and Beijing, Shanghai
or Guangzhou in mainland China via the Hong Kong flight information
zone.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai Airlines has applied through Taipei-based EVA Airways to
operate four round-trip charter flights between Jan. 29 and Feb. 17
-- with three on the Shanghai-Taipei route and one on the
Shanghai-Kaohsiung route, the CAA officials said.
</P>
<P>
China Airlines has also applied to operate four round-trip
charter flights between Jan. 29 and Feb. 5 -- two on the
Taipei-Beijing route, and one each on the Taipei-Shanghai and the
Taipei-Guangzhou routes.
</P>
<P>
EVA Airways has applied to offer two round-trip charter flights
connecting Taipei and Beijing and two connecting Taipei and Shanghai,
between Jan. 29 and Feb. 7.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the mainland's Air China, China Southern
Airlines, China Eastern Airlines, Hainan Airlines and Xiamen Airlines
will also apply to offer flight services.
</P>
<P>
The ground-breaking agreement will see mainland carriers land on
Taiwan soil for the first time in more than 50 years since the two
sides of the Taiwan Strait split in 1949 after a civil war.
</P>
<P>
The cross-strait Chinese New Year charter flights took off for
the first time in 2003, involving only six Taiwan air carriers.
However, the service was not continued the next year due to Beijing's
insistence that mainland carriers be allowed to take part in the
program.

MOFA WELCOMES EP RESOLUTION AGAINST LIFTING OF ARMS EMBARGO
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA)
expressed welcome Thursday for the European Parliament's fourth
resolution in just over a year opposing a lifting of the European
Union's arms embargo against mainland China.
</P>
<P>
The European Parliament -- the legislative arm of the European
Union -- passed the resolution in Strasburg, France last week, said
Wang Yu-yuan, director of the MOFA's Department of European Affairs.
It was the fourth such resolution since Dec. 18, 2003.
</P>
<P>
The latest resolution stipulates that the European Union should
maintain its ban on arms sales to China until there is a satisfactory
improvement in the country's human rights record.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Wang said that the possibility of the European
Union lifting its arms embargo against China is increasing given
various developments.
</P>
<P>
Wang noted that British Secretary of State for Foreign and
Commonwealth Affairs Jack Straw said in the House of Commons Jan. 12
that despite the United States' opposition, it is believed that the
European Union will lift its 15-year arms embargo against China
within six months.
</P>
<P>
Noting that Taiwan and the United States would be affected the
most by a lifting of the embargo, Wang said the MOFA is closely
monitoring related developments.

TAIWAN'S SUCCESS IS AN ASSET TO THE U.S.: PRESIDENT CHEN
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei, Jan. 20 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President Chen Shui-bian said Thursday that
Taiwan's success is absolutely an asset to the United States and
Taiwan will never become a liability for America.
</P>
<P>
Chen made the remarks while meeting with a delegation of the
National Committee on American Foreign Policy (NCAFP) , a noted U.S.
think tank. The delegation, headed NCAFP President George D. Schwab,
is currently on a fact-finding visit in Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
As one of the best allies of U.S. values, Chen said Taiwan will
not become a liability to the U.S. in the coming four years. Instead,
he said, Taiwan's success story will always be an asset for the U.S.
</P>
<P>
"Myself and the Republic of China government and people will do
whatever we can to safeguard our hard-won democratic achievements and
economic prosperity as well as to defend the peace and status quo
across the Taiwan Strait, " Chen said, adding that Taiwan will not
only refrain from making any unilateral move to change the peaceful
cross-strait status quo but will also do its utmost to prevent this
status quo from being unilaterally altered.
</P>
<P>
As for what he said in his new year's day address that this is an
era for dialogue and consultations, Chen said he is working to foster
national healing and inter-party reconciliation after last year's
bitterly divisive presidential election on the domestic front and
simultaneously to push for resumption of the long-stalled
cross-strait dialogue.
</P>
<P>
Chen said he was pleased to see the two sides of the Taiwan
Strait get together to consult and finally succeed in striking a
landmark deal last weekend on the launch of direct, non-stop
cross-strait charter flights during the upcoming Chinese Lunar New
Year holiday to accommodate returning mainland China-based Taiwan
businessmen.
</P>
<P>
"I'm convinced that the successful charter flight negotiations
mark a good start and opportunity for normalization of cross-strait
relations," Chen said.
</P>
<P>
Chen also took advantage of the meeting to offer his
congratulations on the Jan. 20 inauguration of U.S. President George
W. Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney for a second term.
</P>
<P>
"I wish to offer congratulations on behalf of the ROC government
and the 23 million Taiwan people on the Bush-Cheney ticket's second
inauguration. God bless America, " Chen said, adding that he believes
that the United States, under Bush's leadership, will bring permanent
peace to the world and the Taiwan Strait.

LAWMAKER THREATENS MAC BUDGET IF STUDENTS EXCLUDED FROM FLIGHTS
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei, Jan. 20 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Legislator John
Chang threatened Thursday to cut the budget for the Mainland Affairs
Council (MAC) if Taiwanese students studying in mainland China are
not allowed to take the direct cross-strait charter flights during
the upcoming Chinese Lunar New Year holiday.
</P>
<P>
Negotiators from the two sides of the Taiwan Strait reached an
agreement Dec. 8 in Macau to allow six carriers from either side to
offer flight services to accommodate returning Taiwan business people
for the Feb. 9 Chinese New Year holiday on a "non-stop, round-trip,
multi-destinations" model.
</P>
<P>
This landmark service, however, is to be confined only to Taiwan
business people and their families, a move that has upset many Taiwan
students studying on the mainland. Chang, a key figure in reaching
the charter flights agreement, spoke at a news conference held at the
Legislative Yuan, asking, "Aren't these students also Taiwanese
people who need to take airplanes home?"
</P>
<P>
A former KMT secretary-general and a foreign minister during the
time of KMT rule, Chang said that mainland authorities were not
opposed to the notion of allowing Taiwanese students studying on the
mainland to take the charter flights.
</P>
<P>
On the contrary, he said, it has been the MAC who is against
allowing students on the flights because of the possibility that some
students who are studying illegally in the mainland might try to use
the service.
</P>
<P>
Chang said that there would be no problem in identifying these
individuals. All it would take is a check of a person's "taibaozheng"
-- the certificate for people from Taiwan issued by the mainland
Chinese authorities -- and their student cards when they book their
flights, he added.
</P>
<P>
This has nothing to do with whether or not Taiwan recognizes the
academic degrees obtained in mainland China, Chang argued.
</P>
<P>
He urged MAC authorities not to confuse the two different issues.
</P>
<P>
Chang also said that if these Taiwanese students are not allowed
to take the charter flights this year, he will push to reduce the
NT$75 million budget for the MAC's Chunghua Fund for the new fiscal
year in the next legislative session that begins Feb. 1.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the booking rate for the 2003 cross-strait Chinese
Lunar New Year charter flights was only 69 percent, Chang said that
if the students are allowed to participate, it will not only benefit
the students, but will also help increase the air carriers' ticket
bookings.
</P>
<P>
In response to Chang's remarks, MAC Vice Chairman Chiu Tai-san
urged Chang later in the day not to complicate the hard-earned direct
cross-strait flights by adding new problems.
</P>
<P>
The 2003 flights involved only six Taiwan air carriers. However,
the service was not continued the next year due to Beijing's
insistence that mainland carriers be allowed to take part in the
program.
</P>
<P>
As of Thursday, three airlines have applied to operate the direct
cross-strait charter flights, the Civil Aeronautics Administration
(CAA) reported.
</P>
<P>
Mainland China's Shanghai Airlines and Taiwan's two leading
carriers, China Airlines and EVA Airways, were the first three
companies to file applications with the CAA for the Jan. 29 to Feb.
20 service, CAA officials said.
</P>
<P>
The carriers will be permitted to offer a total of 48 round-trip
flights between Taipei or Kaohsiung in Taiwan and Beijing, Shanghai
or Guangzhou in mainland China via Hong Kong's airspace.

15 PEOPLE SINCE 1988 HIV-POSITIVE FROM TAINTED TRANSFUSIONS

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Fifteen people in Taiwan have tested
HIV-positive after receiving tainted blood transfusions since 1988,
with three cases being identified in the last year, the Center for
Disease Control (CDC) under the Department of Health reported
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The CDC identified the 15th HIV-positive person Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The 15 people were believed to have received tainted blood from
12 or 13 anonymous blood donors who may or may not have been aware
that they were HIV-positive, said Lin Ding, deputy director-general
of the CDC.
</P>
<P>
Three people receiving tainted blood over the past year marks one
of the worst years in terms of HIV infection among blood recipients,
Lin said.
</P>
<P>
The Department of Health (DOH) will take legal action against
HIV-positive blood donors, Lin said.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, the DOH has managed to sue only one of these
HIV-positive blood donors because of the lack of hard evidence.
</P>
<P>
The man in question was found to have donated blood twice since
July 2004. The blood that he donated the second time, last November,
was identified to be HIV-positive.
</P>
<P>
Noting that individuals who knowingly donate HIV-positive blood
face a jail term of up to seven years, Lin said that all future blood
donors ought to think twice before deciding to give blood.

constitutional re-engineering plan has nothing to do with promoting
Taiwan independence.
</P>
<P>
In the interview with the Mainichi Shimbun daily Wednesday, Chen
also said Beijing's proposed anti-secession legislation is
detrimental to bilateral ties and would hurt Taiwan people's
feelings.
</P>
<P>
Chen gave the exclusive interview during an inspection tour of
the southern Taiwan county of Tainan. The Mainichi Shimbun published
the interview in its Thursday edition.
</P>
<P>
The president told Mainichi Shimbun reporters that the people of
Taiwan have yet to reach a consensus on such sensitive issues as to
whether Taiwan should eventually unify with mainland China or declare
independence.
</P>
<P>
Against this backdrop, Chen said, his administration is unlikely
to address sovereignty and territory issues in its constitutional
re-engineering plan.
</P>
<P>
Stressing that Taiwan is a pluralistic, democratic country, Chen
said any constitutional reforms must be subject to public debates and
cannot take effect without the approval of three-quarters of its
people.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, Chen said, the scenario of Taiwan provoking a war in
the Taiwan Strait will absolutely not happen during his tenure as the
Republic of China president. Beijing has threatened to attack Taiwan
if the island declares independence.
</P>
<P>
Through candid and extensive communications, Chen said the United
States has come to a full understanding of his administration's
constitutional reform stance.
</P>
<P>
During U.S. President George W. Bush's second term, Chen said his
administration will continue to strengthen exchanges and cooperation
with the United States.
</P>
<P>
Chen also panned Beijing's anti-secession legislation plan,
saying that the move is aimed at suppressing Taiwan and legalizing
its use of force against Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Such a move would only hurt Taiwan people's feelings and be a
disservice to cross-strait rapprochement, Chen said.
</P>
<P>
According to the Mainichi Shimbun report, Chen said in the
interview that some Taiwan people have called for the enactment of an
anti-annexation law to counter Beijing's anti-secession law. Some
critics have even proposed the holding of a referendum to express
Taiwan people's strong opposition to Beijing's anti-secession
legislation, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The paper also quoted Chen as having said in the interview that
the landmark deal reached by the two sides of the Taiwan Strait last
week on the launch of direct, non-stop cross-strait charter flights
during the upcoming Chinese Lunar New Year holiday to accommodate
returning mainland China-based Taiwan businessmen is conducive to
future development of cross-strait ties
</P>
<P>
The report said Chen hopes that the new year charter flights can
lead to the resumption of the long-stalled regular cross-strait
dialogue.

LABOR GROUPS PROTEST AGAINST AMENDMENTS TO LABOR-RELATED LAWS
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  Jan. 20 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Several labor groups demonstrated in front
of the Legislative Yuan Thursday requesting the withdrawal of
government-proposed amendments to three labor-related laws.
</P>
<P>
Arguing that the amendments initiated by the Council of Labor
Affairs to the Trade Union Law, Collective Bargaining Law and the Law
for the Settling of Industrial Disputes would seriously limit
laborers' rights to take industrial action in case of their being
laid off or if the employer failed to pay their salaries on time.
</P>
<P>
The revised laws would also prohibit laborers from resorting to
industrial action in disputes over their severance, they claimed.
</P>
<P>
The legislature is set to discuss the revision on Thursday, but
the ruling Democratic Progressive Party and the opposition can't see
eye to eye on whether the country's teachers should be allowed to
form a trade union or whether the employees of telecommunications
companies should go through a 30-day cooling down period before going
on strike.

SCHOLARS DIVIDED ON PROPOSAL FOR UNIVERSITY CLASSIFICATION
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,   Jan.  20  (CNA)
(By Luis Huang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A proposal for universities to be
classified into various categories that was put forward by the Higher
Education Department (HED) under the Ministry of Education was
debated heatedly Thursday at a panel discussion of the ongoing
national conference of university heads.
</P>
<P>
The participants in the panel discussion, which was presided over
by Mou Tsung-tsan, chairman of the Association of Private
Universities and Colleges, were divided on the proposal, under which
domestic universities would be classified into four categories --
teaching universities, research universities, professional
universities and community universities.
</P>
<P>
Due to a great increase in the number of universities, Taiwan's
university education has shifted from elite education to universal
education, which has resulted in financial pressure, poor quality of
higher education and low competitiveness, an HED official pointed
out.
</P>
<P>
To iron out these problems, the HED proposed that universities be
classified into the four categories in line with their
characteristics and functions and that the government offer them
funds based upon the categories into which they fall, the official
said.

TAIWAN INVESTMENT IN MAINLAND CHINA INCREASES
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Jan.  20  (CNA)
(By Huang Kwang-chun)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Investment Commission under the
Ministry of Economic Affairs approved last year more than 2,000
investment projects worth nearly US$7 billion to be made in mainland
China by Taiwan businesses, an increase of 51.05 percent in terms of
value over the previous year's level, commission officials said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The officials said the commission gave the green light to a total
of 2,004 such investment projects last year, up 9.09 percent
year-on-year. The projects had a combined value of US$6.94 billion,
they added.
</P>
<P>
In December alone, they went on, the commission approved 165
Taiwan businesses' mainland investment projects with a combined value
of US$777.4 million.
</P>
<P>
The officials ascribed the increase to the value of mainland
China's currency, the renminbi, which has not yet appreciated as the
international market has long expected.
</P>
<P>
The investors might believe they will get profits from the
difference of the renminbi's exchange rate by investing in the
mainland prior to its appreciation, the officials explained.
</P>
<P>
They warned Taiwan investors of the risks they could encounter on
the mainland, including Beijing's continual efforts to cool its
overheated economy, a lack of power and water supplies and the impact
of the renminbi's appreciation on the mainland's economic
development.

DIPLOMATIC LINKS WITH GRENADA STILL EXIST: FOREIGN MINISTRY

<P>
Grenada has not yet severed diplomatic
links with Taiwan, despite Grenadan Prime Minister Keith Mitchell
announcing in Beijing earlier in the day that his country has resumed
diplomatic ties with mainland China, a spokesman for the Ministry of
Foreign Affairs said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan will break off ties with Grenada only after it has been
officially informed of the switch by the Grenadan authorities, the
spokesman added.
</P>
<P>
Noting that Mitchell will leave for home at 12: 30 a.m. Friday
Taipei time, Lu said the critical time will be early Friday morning.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said Mitchell tried to play Beijing against Taipei
in attempt to get the most mileage from the competition between
Taiwan and the mainland.
</P>
<P>
He visited Beijing in mid-December last year in spite of Taiwan's
protest and demanded unreasonably high amounts of aid from Taipei
after that trip, Lu said.
</P>
<P>
Refusing to play into his hand, Lu said, Taipei snubbed
Mitchell's "extortion" and withdrew its ambassador to Saint George in
protest.
</P>
<P>
Lu said Taiwan would like to aid Grenada in accordance with a
cooperation plan that exists between them, but will not engage in a
bidding war with the mainland for diplomatic allies.

TWO LATE PRESIDENTS SET TO BE INTERRED IN JULY
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Jan. 20 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The embalmed bodies of the late President
Chiang Kai-shek and his son and successor Chiang Ching-kuo are
scheduled to be interred at a military cemetery in Taipei County in
July, a spokesman for the Ministry of the Interior (MOI) said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman made the remarks after an MOI-organized
inter-department meeting to discuss the preparatory work for the
move.
</P>
<P>
According to the spokesman, the MOI will come up with a detailed
draft plan for the Executive Yuan's review and approval in February.
</P>
<P>
Officials from the Presidential Office, the Executive Yuan, the
Ministry of National Defense (MND), the Ministry of Foreign Affairs,
the Ministry of Transportation and Communications and the Central
Personnel Administration attended the meeting.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said the MND has commissioned contractors to build
tombs for the two late presidents and the graves are scheduled for
completion in June.
</P>
<P>
If all goes well, the spokesman said, the interment ceremony will
be held in July.
</P>
<P>
The Chiang family sent a letter to the MND last year asking it to
help with the relocation of the two Chiangs -- who have been embalmed
in interim mausoleums in Taoyuan, northern Taiwan -- to the Wutzushan
military cemetery in Hsichih, Taipei County, for permanent interment.
</P>
<P>
With the consent of President Chen Shui-bian, the MND, the MOI
and various other government agencies began to plan for the
relocation and burial in line with the state funeral law.
</P>
<P>
The MOI spokesman said an ad hoc office will be set up to
coordinate preparatory and interment work. The office is scheduled to
become operational in March. The Presidential Office will announce
relocation and interment procedures and rituals in April in
accordance with the state funeral law.
</P>
<P>
Chiang Kai-shek fled to Taiwan in 1949 after losing the Chinese
mainland to the Mao Zedong-led communist party in a bloody civil war.
He died in 1975 and his remains were embalmed in a temporary
mausoleum at Tzuhu in Taoyuan, awaiting a proper burial on the
mainland.
</P>
<P>
Chiang Kai-shek ruled Taiwan with an iron fist, using martial law
to suppress democracy. However, some view him as a hero for keeping
the island out of reach of the Chinese communists and claim that it
was he who fostered Taiwan's freewheeling market economy.
</P>
<P>
Chiang Ching-kuo is respected for ending martial law in 1987,
shortly before his death, thus unleashing the democratic forces that
broke his family's vice-grip on power and eventually ended the
Kuomintang's half-century of rule over Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Chiang Ching-kuo died in 1988 and his remains also lie embalmed
in an interim mausoleum at Touliao in Taoyuan. His Russian-born wife
died Dec. 15, 2004 and her cremated ashes, which are being kept at
Chiang's mausoleum, will be buried along with her husband.

Combined investments by overseas Chinese

The MOEA Investment Commission approved a total of 1,149
investment projects filed by overseas Chinese and foreign firms last

NO PLAN FOR ANTI-ANNEXATION LAW: MAINLAND AFFAIRS OFFICIAL
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) has no
plans to propose an anti-annexation law to counter Beijing's proposed
anti-succession law, a MAC official said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
MAC Vice Chairman and spokesman Chiu Tai-san made the statement
after being asked to comment on a wire service report that President
Chen Shui-bian told Japanese daily the Mainichi Shimbun the previous
day that Beijing's attempt to enact an anti-secession law to justify
its possible absorption of Taiwan might force Taiwan to enact an
anti-annexation law in response.
</P>
<P>
According to his understanding, Chiu said, the president is
worried that Beijing's move might prompt a reaction from the Taiwan
people, which could include a call for an anti-annexation law to
repel Beijing's attempts.
</P>
<P>
The MAC has not contemplated enacting an anti-annexation law, but
Chiu said Beijing's anti-secession legislation will serve no purpose
other than to estrange the Taiwan people and further aggravate the
cross-Taiwan Strait tension.

PRESIDENT THREATENS TO COUNTERACT BEIJING LAW WITH TAIWAN LAW

<TEXT>
<P>
Taiwan might be forced to respond to
Beijing's attempts to enact an anti-secession law with an
anti-annexation law or to organize a May 26 referendum to seek the
country's permanent separation from China, President Chen Shui-bian
was quoted as saying Thursday.
</P>
<P>
According to a press release issued by Chen's office, the
president told the Japanese daily Mainichi Shimbun in an interview
the previous day that his administration might be forced to take the
above actions by public opinion angered by Beijing's anti-secession
law, which purports to pre-empt Taiwan's attempts to pursue
independence.
</P>
<P>
As the country is set to elect a national assembly May 26 to
amend the Constitution, the president said there are already calls in
Taiwan for a referendum in conjunction with the election.
</P>
<P>
"That would be the last thing I want to see, but it is up to
Beijing," Chen was quoted in the press release as saying.
</P>
<P>
Branding Beijing's anti-secession law, which has yet to be
enacted by the National People's Congress, as warlike move against
Taiwan, Chen said it is an attempt to lay the legal groundwork for
Beijing's possible invasion of Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
By this legislation, Beijing is trying to impose its view of
Taiwan on the island and to dictate to Taiwan its solution of the
cross-Taiwan Strait dispute, Chen said.
</P>
<P>
It is tantamount to an attempt to change the cross-strait status
quo unilaterally, which will jeopardize the whole region, Chen said.
</P>
<P>
Although Beijing has snubbed the olive branch he said he had
proffered to Beijing more than 30 times in the last four years, the
president said he will wait patiently for Beijing to reciprocate his
goodwill.
</P>
<P>
He lauded the charter flights to be launched between Taiwan and
the mainland during the Chinese New Year holiday as a good start for
positive engagement with the mainland that was unimaginable only a
few months ago because of the tension between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
Chen said it proves that exchanges between Taiwan and the
mainland can be improved as long as both sides pass over their
political disputes.
</P>
<P>
He also vowed to deal with Beijing "following a firm and
pragmatic line" and with "a slow pace without retrogression and a
steady attitude without haste."

<P>
President Chen Shui-bian called for the
nation Friday to seriously face Beijing's proposed anti-secession law
which he said would undermine stability across the Taiwan Strait if
enacted.
</P>
<P>
The president made the remarks while reviewing the operations and
capability of an army unit in Pingtung, southern Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Chen said that Beijing has been actively engaging in
"psychological, legal and media warfare" in pushing to enact the
anti-secession law, which he said is aimed at establishing a legal
justification for a military invasion of Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
The National People's Congress (NPC) Standing Committee late last
year placed the anti-secession bill on the agenda for the annual
session of the NPC set for this March.
</P>
<P>
The president reiterated remarks he made in his New Year's
address in which he condemned Beijing's plans to enact an
anti-secession law as a unilateral attempt to change the status quo
in the Taiwan Strait. Chen called the proposed law the biggest threat
to regional stability and peace in the world.

TAIWAN VISITORS TO MAINLAND SHOULD STAY ALERT: MAC
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Jan. 21 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) called
for Taiwan people Friday to carefully assess the risks before heading
to mainland China and to stay alert while visiting there to reduce
the risks to their personal safety.
</P>
<P>
Chiu Tai-san, vice chairman of the MAC -- the top government
agency in charge of mainland China policy planning -- made the call
at a time when large numbers of Taiwan tourists are planning to take
sightseeing tours to mainland China during the Chinese New Year
holidays.
</P>
<P>
More Taiwan people are expected to head to mainland China during
this upcoming holiday than in previous years following the
devastation to the tourism industry in South Asia and Southeast Asia
caused by the Dec. 26 tsunami tragedy.
</P>
<P>
According to Chiu, Taiwan people make about 3 million trips to
the mainland each year for tourism or for business activities, making
mainland China one of the top destinations for Taiwan people
traveling abroad. Despite this, Taiwan visitors have not been
afforded due protection in mainland China, Chiu claimed.
</P>
<P>
He quoted a study conducted recently by an academic group as
indicating that Taiwan tourists face 10 major problems in visiting
China, including the lack of a tourism safety and security protection
mechanism; overbooking of transport tickets; rampant circulation of
counterfeit goods; widespread epidemic diseases; unauthorized
changing of itineraries; forced visits to shops; unregulated tipping
systems; and reneging on accommodation contracts.
</P>
<P>
The academics who sponsored the study suggested that authorities
from across the Taiwan Strait join hands in efforts to regulate
unlawful travel and tourism operators and exchange related
information so that consumers' rights and interests can be better
protected.
</P>
<P>
The academics reminded Taiwan holidaymakers not to be slack in
their vigilance while touring the mainland just because the language
is the same and the lifestyle is similar.
</P>
<P>
They also called for Taiwan tourists to be well prepared
regarding travel information, to be aware of where to turn to in case
of accidents and to buy insurance before setting foot on the
mainland.
</P>
<P>
Chiu added that any Taiwan residents who need assistance while
traveling in China can call the Straits Exchange Foundation at
8862-27129292, Chung Hwa Travel Service at 852-25258642, or the
Taipei Economic and Cultural Center in Macau at 853-306282.

KMT SUSPENDS NEGOTIATIONS WITH RULING DPP AFTER LEGISLATIVE BOYCOTT
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Jan.  21  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The legislative caucus of the main
opposition Kuomintang (KMT) suspended negotiations with the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) Friday in retaliation for the
DPP's filibuster at the last session of the Fifth Legislative Yuan.
</P>
<P>
Huang Teh-fu, a KMT party whip at the Legislative Yuan, said that
in the face of the DPP's "irrational" boycott, the KMT will not
humble itself any longer and added that the party will in turn
boycott all the bills authored and submitted by the Executive Yuan or
the DPP caucus and close all negotiation channels with them.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng, who is also a
KMT vice chairman, said in an uncharacteristically stern voice that
he was bitterly disappointed that the ruling DPP lawmakers obstructed
the legislative process in a manner as if they were still the
opposition party.
</P>
<P>
The DPP legislators were mainly trying to obstruct a national
communications commission (NCC) organization draft bill from being
passed into law. The draft bill was jointly submitted by the KMT and
its ally, the People First Party (PFP).
</P>
<P>
DPP legislative party whip Tsai Huang-liang said that the DPP
legislators were forced to adopt a "scorched earth policy" to bar the
bill from being passed, saying that if what he describes as an
"anti-reform, pork-barrel bill" is passed into law, it will seriously
infringe on the administration's rights and directly take the
painstaking efforts to simplify broadband channel systems right back
to the starting point.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Government Information Office Director-General Lin
Chia-lung said that the KMT-PFP version of the NCC draft bill is
absolutely unacceptable as it stipulates that NCC members should be
party representatives whose numbers should be decided based on party
proportional representation.
</P>
<P>
Lin ridiculed the opposition's justification of the NCC bill --
the centerpiece bill of the opposition camp in this final legislative
session -- saying that the proposed establishment of a national
communications commission is aimed primarily at streamlining Taiwan's
major media regime and getting rid of political and military
influences from the media.
</P>
<P>
This being the case, it would be absurd if the future NCC members
are named in accordance with party proportional representation as the
KMT wants, Lin claimed.
</P>
<P>
The DPP failed to reach its goal of forming a stable majority
with its ally, the Taiwan Solidarity Union, in the Dec. 11
legislative elections, while the opposition "pan-blue alliance" of
the KMT, PFP and the New Party, remains the majority.
</P>
<P>
No country in the world has an NCC whose members are composed in
the way the opposition seeks, Lin said.

OUTCRY AS ADMINISTRATION LAMBASTES BUDGET CUTS
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,   Jan.   21  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Executive Yuan lambasted the
Legislative Yuan Friday for making major cuts in the 2005 general
budget of the central government and the legislature, calling the
result a major threat that will impede national development.
</P>
<P>
The Fifth Legislative Yuan wrapped up its final session Friday
after passing many bills into law, including the 2005 general budget
plan, which underwent the deepest cuts in three years.
</P>
<P>
Executive Yuan spokesman Chen Chi-mai said that the record budget
cut not only threatens to drag down overall national development but
will also seriously undermine operations in the administrative
branch.
</P>
<P>
He said that the cuts in authorized revenues to be generated from
the privatization of state-run enterprises will impede the
enterprises' privatization process.
</P>
<P>
The budget cuts for special high technology development projects
will definitely slow the upgrading of Taiwan's industrial structure,
which will in turn adversely impact national development, Chen said.
</P>
<P>
In addition, he went on, the across-the-board axing of year-end
performance bonuses for the 200,000 public functionaries threatens to
sap morale in the civil service, which will in turn undermine
administrative efficiency.
</P>
<P>
A 30 percent cut in budget for entrust and consignment plans to
be conducted by various governmental offices and agencies will
seriously obstruct administrative operations, he added.
</P>
<P>
The entire axing of subsidies for professional research and
development for grand justices is obviously just political
retaliation, Chen continued, adding that the motive behind the cut is
an attempt to interfere politically in the independence of the
judiciary.
</P>
<P>
Chen termed the entire axing of special allowances for Minister
of Education Tu Cheng-sheng and Government Information Office
Director-General Lin Chia-lung as taking public policy to the
personal level.
</P>
<P>
In response to the swingeing cuts, Hsu Chang-yao,
director-general of the Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and
Statistics, said that under these circumstances, the government will
have to issue public bonds worth NT$255 billion in addition to using
a balance of NT$81 billion accumulated from the previous fiscal year
to fill up the budgetary sink-hole.
</P>
<P>
Even if this is the case, Hsu added, the government will still
see a budgetary shortfall of about NT$1.2 billion for the following
year, which can probably be filled by support from the Central Bank.

RENMINBI APPRECIATION A TIME BOMB FOR TAIWAN: ECONOMIST
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Jan.  21 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A widely expected revaluation of the
mainland Chinese currency will be a time bomb for Taiwan's economy,
although it remains unknown exactly when the renminbi will go up in
value, a noted economist said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Lee Kao-chao, an ex-vice chairman and now an advisor to the
Cabinet-level Council for Economic Planning and Development (CEPD) ,
said that a sharp renminbi appreciation will have a profound negative
impact on the Taiwan's economic growth rate and consumer product
prices.
</P>
<P>
Despite the fact that nobody knows when and to what extent the
mainland authorities will loosen the renminbi's strict peg to the U.
S. dollar, the move will unavoidably hinder the domestic economy in
2005, he predicted.
</P>
<P>
According to the former CEPD vice chairman, elements that might
affect Taiwan's economy this year include fluctuating international
oil prices, a rising interest rate and the mainland's measures to
cool its high flying economy.
</P>
<P>
Judging from the country's major economic indexes, domestic
economic expansion will slow in the coming months, he said, adding
that most forecasting agencies have set their growth rate estimates
for Taiwan from 4 percent to 4.6 percent for the whole of the year.
</P>
<P>
Regarding private sector investment, the machinery industry and
real estate businesses will be most affected, he claimed.
</P>
<P>
The limitations on greenhouse gas emissions set by the Kyoto
Protocol might dampen investment willingness in the machinery
industry, while the property market is particularly sensitive to
interest rates at a time when supply exceeds demand, he explained,
noting that there were 130,000 houses built last year, outpacing the
normal demand level of 100,000.

TAIWAN TO COOPERATE WITH U.S. IN PROMOTING DEMOCRACY: MAC CHIEF
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Taiwan's Mainland Affairs Council (MAC)
Chairman Joseph Wu said Friday that Taiwan is willing to cooperate
with the United States in promoting democracy and freedom around the
world.
</P>
<P>
Wu, a member of the Taiwan delegation to the Jan. 20 inauguration
of U.S. President George W. Bush for his second term, made the
remarks after hearing Bush's inaugural address.
</P>
<P>
Noting that Bush's speech focused on U.S. efforts to promote
democracy and freedom, Wu said he was deeply impressed by Bush's
remark that peace hinges on the expansion of democracy and freedom.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan has shifted from long-term authoritarian rule to democracy
and during the transition, the country received great inspiration and
support from the U.S. government and people, Wu pointed out.
</P>
<P>
"While cherishing its hard-earned freedom and democracy, " Wu
said, "Taiwan, like the United States, should also take the
responsibility of promoting freedom and democracy so that they may
take root in many countries."
</P>
<P>
Wu further said that while testifying before the U.S.
Congress last April, Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian
and Pacific Affairs James Kelly suggested that Taiwan join hands with
the United States to lead the cause of freedom and democracy, adding
that officials from the two countries could meet to study how to
carry out the plan. 
</P>
<P>
Later in the day, the Taiwan delegation attended a cocktail party
and other events to celebrate Bush's inauguration. The group is
scheduled to hold a press conference and meet with representatives
from the Taiwanese expatriate community.
</P>
<P>
The delegation, led by Academia Sinica President Lee Yuan-tseh,
includes Yang-Huang Mei-hsin, director of the Research and Planning
Board under the Ministry of Foreign Affairs; Hsu Su-chien, an
Academia Sinica assistant researcher; Lo Chih-cheng, executive
director of the National Policy Research Institute; and David Tawei
Lee, Taiwan's representative to the United States.

The arrival in Minnesota Thursday of
three Taiwanese youths suffering from a rare degenerative disease

Wang Pao-hsing, deputy representative of the Taipei Economic and

Wang said that he, along with dozens of Taiwanese expatriates in

The Star Tribune published Thursday a report on the Changs'

ALD is a rare genetic disorder in which the fatty myelin
"insulation" around the nerves breaks down. The disease was brought

a cure for their ALD-afflicted son.

TRANSPORT MINISTER WISHES BEST FOR TAIWAN-MAINLAND CHARTER FLIGHTS

<TEXT>
<P>
Transport and Communications Minister Lin
Ling-san offered his best wishes Friday for the special Chinese New
Year charter flights between Taiwan and mainland China and wished all
returning Taiwan businessmen a happy new year.
</P>
<P>
Lin made the remarks while taking part in a ceremony to mark the
inauguration of a passenger waiting area at Chiang Kai-shek
International Airport.
</P>
<P>
Stating that he is happy that all arrangements and preparations
for the charter flights have proceeded smoothly on both sides, Lin
said that he is confident that the service will kick off Jan. 29 as
scheduled and run through Feb. 20.
</P>
<P>
Six airlines on either side of the Taiwan Strait will offer the
service designed especially for Taiwan businessmen and their families
operating on the mainland who wish to return for the Chinese New Year
holiday on Feb. 9.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the mainland-based Air China, China Southern
Airlines, China Eastern Airlines, Hainan Airlines and Xiamen Airlines
will take part in the flight service.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on the same occasion, Civil Aeronautics Administration
Director General Chang Kuo-cheng said that he will call a meeting
with representatives from the six carriers on the Taiwan side --
China Airlines, EVA Airways Corporation, Trans Asia Airways, Far East
Air Transport Corp., UNI Airways Corp. and Mandarin Airlines -- to
iron out relevant details.
</P>
<P>
As the service will be confined to Taiwan businessmen and their
families, the Cabinet-level Mainland Affairs Council and
mainland-based Taiwan businessmen's groups will take charge of
verifying the status of the passengers, Chang noted.
</P>
<P>
The Taiwan-mainland China lunar new year charter flights took off
for the first time in 2003, involving only the six Taiwan aviation
companies. But the service failed to proceed in 2004 owning to
Beijing's refusal to negotiate its demand that mainland carriers also
be permitted to offer the service.

BASIC LAW PROVIDES AUTONOMY FOR INDIGENOUS PEOPLE
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Jan. 21 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Basic Law for Indigenous People, which
passed through the Legislative Yuan Friday, gives Taiwan's indigenous
people the right to autonomy and protects their rights to their
traditional land.
</P>
<P>
Under the law, indigenous people have the right of autonomy in
their traditional territory and on land that is reserved for them.
</P>
<P>
The government must provide funds every year for the autonomy of
the indigenous people and the local governments that govern the areas
of indigenous people should have a special unit for indigenous
affairs.
</P>
<P>
These local governments should also have special units to study
and develop the languages of the indigenous people and should
establish a system to test and certify the indigenous people's
ability to speak their mother tongues.
</P>
<P>
These governments should also recruit government employees from
among the indigenous people through public examinations in which the
indigenous peoples' language ability must be tested. Within their
areas, the indigenous people may hunt wild animals, gather wild
plants and fungus, mine, dig and gather earth and rocks, and utilize
water resources. The government should seek the indigenous people's
consent before developing the land or exploiting natural resources in
these areas and should allow them to take part in any such
activities.
</P>
<P>
The government should seek the indigenous people's consent before
establishing national parks or national scenic areas in the areas of
indigenous people and should administer these parks and scenic areas
together with the indigenous people.
</P>
<P>
The law also prohibits the storage of toxic materials in the area
of indigenous people, and forbids the removal of indigenous people
from their areas unless there are clear and immediate dangers.

TAIWAN SHOULD HAVE RELIABLE DEFENSE FORCE: PRESIDENT
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Jan. 21 (CNA)
(By Huang Kwang-chun)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It is important to have a reliable defense
force while continuing to seek to resume cross-Taiwan Strait talks,
President Chen Shui-bian said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The president made the remarks while reviewing the operations and
capability of an army unit in Pingtung, southern Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Given that mainland China has not yet abandoned the option of
using force to settle disputes with Taiwan, it is necessary for
Taiwan to have a reliable defense force, while continuing to seek the
resumption of cross-strait dialogue, to deter possible military
adventurism on the part of Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan is a peace-loving and democratic country and its people
assert that disputes should be settled through dialogue, Chen said,
adding that this is the reason why he concentrated his 2005 New
Year's Day address on creating a new and stable environment for
consultations and dialogue, which would also serve as a basic concept
in promoting cross-strait talks.
</P>
<P>
"We will continue to actively seek the resumption of cross-strait
talks, which we have tried to re-open over the last four years, "
Chen said.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out, however, that Beijing has been sharply increasing
its military buildup in recent years with a double-digit annual
growth rate of military expenditures along with its economic
expansion.
</P>
<P>
Mainland China's rapid military expansion poses a serious threat
to regional stability and peace, he warned.
</P>
<P>
Beijing has been actively engaging in "psychological, legal and
media warfare" in pushing to enact an "anti-secession law, " which he
said is aimed at establishing a mainland-based legal justification
for a military invasion of Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
He condemned Beijing's move as an attempt to unilaterally change
the status quo in the Taiwan Strait.
</P>
<P>
The National People's Congress (NPC) Standing Committee late last
year placed the "anti-secession law" bill on the agenda for the
annual session of the NPC set for this March.

VP CONDEMNS BEIJING'S DIPLOMATIC BLOCKADE AGAINST TAIWAN
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Jan. 21 (CNA)
(By Luis Huang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Vice President Annette Lu blasted mainland
China Friday for going to extremes in every instance to isolate
Taiwan from the international community, saying that its actions are
unacceptable to the international community.
</P>
<P>
Lu was responding to foreign wire reports that Taiwan's
diplomatic ally -- Grenada -- has signed a joint comunique with
Beijing to resume diplomatic ties with mainland China.
</P>
<P>
While meeting with Victor Manuel Sanchez Pena, the new Dominican
Republic ambassador to the Republic of China, Lu said that Beijing
authorities always try to tempt political leaders of Taiwan's
diplomatic allies with large sums of money to forge diplomatic ties
with China.
</P>
<P>
Lu said that the diplomatic policy of the new government led by
President Chen Shui-bian is different from that of the former
government, adding that Chen's administration attaches great
importance to the principles of equality and national dignity while
the former government paid much attention to the number of the
nation's diplomatic allies and always made great concessions for the
purpose of maintaining bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
Stressing that Chen's administration cherishes the traditional
friendship that is maintained with all its diplomatic allies, Lu
called on the leaders of these ROC allies not to play Beijing against
Taipei in a bid to make a profit out of the competition between Taiwan
and the mainland.
</P>
<P>
Touching on Taiwan's relations with Central and South American
states, Lu said that the government has worked out a set of projects
aimed at promoting bilateral cooperation and substantive exchanges
with Taiwan's diplomatic allies in that region.
</P>
<P>
The vice president also disclosed that she is working actively to
push for a "new town-building program," under which Taiwan will help
its Latin American diplomatic allies carry out various development
projects in the fields of agriculture, fishery, energy and
infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the government has launched the Taiwan Scholarship
Program for students from the nation's diplomatic allies to study in
Taiwan, Lu went on.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Lu also said that Taiwan is willing to
cooperate with the Dominican Republic in carrying out a farm
development plan in that Caribbean state.
</P>
<P>
For his part, Sanchez said that Lu is welcome to make an official
visit to his country to discuss details of the cooperation plan with
relevant authorities.

2004 JOBLESS RATE BEATS GOVERNMENT EXPECTATIONS AT 4.44 PERCENT
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Jan.  21 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taiwan's unemployment rate for 2004 was
4.44 percent, lower than the government's forecast of 4.5 percent
thanks to December's figure of 4.09 percent -- the lowest single
monthly level since May 2001, government statistics released Friday
showed.
</P>
<P>
The Cabinet-level Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and
Statistics (DGBAS) reported that the December 2004 jobless rate was
down by 0.05 percentage points compared to the previous month's level
and lower by 0.49 percentage points from the year-earlier level.
</P>
<P>
The 4.44 percent unemployment rate was lower than Hong Kong's 6.5
percent and Japan's 4.5 percent, but lackluster compared to
Singapore's 3.4 percent and South Korea's 3.6 percent, according to
DGBAS tallies.
</P>
<P>
In December, 422,000 workers remained jobless, 4,000 fewer than
the November figure, or a fall of 0.05 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
An average of 9.786 million people were employed across the
country in 2004, up by 213,000 over the 2003 level, the largest
annual growth since 1993, thanks to a fast recovering industrial
sector which absorbed the highest number of about 112,000 workers and
lifted the total number of workers in the sector to more than 3.44
million.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, there were some 454. 000 jobless people for the
whole of last year, down by 49,000 from the number a year ago -- a
drop of 0.55 percentage points from the 2003 figure.
</P>
<P>
Liu Pei-chen, a deputy bureau chief at the DGBAS, said that
senior high school graduates posted the largest unemployment rate of
4.59 percent for December, followed by junior high and elementary
schoolers with 4.06 percent and college graduates and post-graduates
at 3.57 percent.
</P>
<P>
In terms of age, 10.02 percent of those aged between 15 and 24
were without a job in December, sliding by 0.34 percentage points
from November. The 25 to 44 age group recorded an unemployment of
3.72 percent, a slight rise of 0.07 percentage points month-to-month.
Some 2.9 percent of the people aged between 45 and 64 were
unemployed, down by 0.15 percentage points compared to the November
level.
</P>
<P>
In December, jobless people were out of work for an average 30.7
weeks, 0.9 weeks longer than the November average. It took 32.9 weeks
for first-time job seekers to find a job, an increase of 5.2 weeks.
</P>
<P>
Non first-time job seekers spent an average of 30.2 weeks to
enter the workplace again in that same month, 0.1 weeks less than in
November. They were jobless an average of 29.4 weeks last year, an
improvement of 1.1 weeks.

LEGISLATURE ENDS TERM BY PULLING THE PLUG ON BUDGET ITEMS
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,   Jan.  21  (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The general budget of the central
government passed through the Legislative Yuan hours before the
legislature went into recess Friday.
</P>
<P>
According to the approved budget, the government's revenue was
set at NT$1.33 trillion (US$41.77 billion) , and the spending at
NT$1.6 trillion (US$50.25 billion) which is NT$71.6 billion less than
the original budget.
</P>
<P>
Notable among the agencies whose budget was cut was the
organizing committee for a National Human Rights Memorial Hall under
the Presidential Office. The entire NT$26 million was scotched.
</P>
<P>
The Government Information Office (GIO), which has tried to take
away a channel used by a broadcast corporation of the opposition
Kuomintang, saw its budget slashed by the opposition-controlled
legislature by more than NT$400 million, including NT1.6 million in
special funds for the use of the GIO chief and deputy chief.
</P>
<P>
The Grand Justices, who ruled against the opposition in a dispute
about the constitutionality of the "319 Truth Investigation
Committee" have seen their professional allowance, which was budgeted
at NT$18 million or NT$89,000 per capita per month, as well as the
subsidy for overseas trips, which was budgeted at NT$1.8 million, was
completely eliminated.
</P>
<P>
The justices will retain their fixed salaries.
</P>
<P>
The Control Yuan's budget was cut by NT$12 million, which was
intended for investigations and research costs for its members.
</P>
<P>
The NT$7 million budget for the Corruption Investigation Center
under the Prosecutors' Office at the Taiwan High Court remained
intact, although the opposition has threatened to do away with it on
the grounds that the center was not formed on the basis of law.
</P>
<P>
The center's budget came to public attention the previous day
after prosecutors from the center claimed that several opposition
lawmakers, who were probed by the center in connection with
corruption, threatened to kill the center's budget in revenge.
</P>
<P>
The examination of the general budgetary bill is the climax of
the last day of this legislative session, which is the last sitting
of the current lawmakers whose three-year terms are due to end at the
end of this month.
</P>
<P>
Wang Jin-pyng, president of the Legislative Yuan, rounded off the
sitting by saying that this legislature has approved 611 statutory
and budgetary bills during its three-year term, a performance which
is average for the law-making body.
</P>
<P>
He condemned the lawmakers of the ruling Democratic Progressive
Party (DPP) for occupying the president's podium to obstruct the
deliberation of an opposition-proposed bill about a national
communications commission during the sitting, calling it a dirty
tactic unbecoming a ruling party.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, DPP Secretary-General Chang Chun-hsiung
decried the now ended legislature for being out of control and
fragmented with partisan struggling the likes of which has never
before been seen in the history of the country.
</P>
<P>
Chang said the opposition-controlled legislature had no respect
for the Constitution as made clear by the way it railroaded through a
statute to set up the "319 Truth Investigation Commission, " which
was ruled unconstitutional by the Council of Grand Justices, its
refusal to exercise its right to confirm the president's nominees for
members of the Control Yuan, and for axing the government's budget
arbitrarily to the detriment of the whole country.
</P>
<P>
He said he hopes different political parties will reconcile their
differences and subordinate their partisan interests for the general
benefit of the country in the next legislature, which will be sworn
in on Feb. 1.

RECENT RISE IN OIL PRICES NOT A CAUSE FOR CONCERN: CEPD

(By Flor Wang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Officials from Taiwan's top economic
planning agency said Saturday that there is no cause for concern
about the surge in oil prices in recent days.
</P>
<P>
Hu Sheng-cheng, chairman of the Cabinet-level Council for
Economic Planning and Development (CEPD) , said that the rise in oil
prices will only be short term and that the price of oil is very
likely to drop to US$35 a barrel this year. He added that this will
help stabilize the growth rate in consumer product prices at home at
below 2 percent for 2005.
</P>
<P>
Foreign wire services reported that in early trading Friday on
the New York Stock Exchange, light sweet crude for delivery in March
jumped by US$1.39 to US$48.7 per barrel.
</P>
<P>
CEPD Vice Chairman Yeh Ming-feng said that rising oil prices
won't last long, predicting that prices will drop after March when
the weather begins to warm up. World oil prices have slid by some 20
percent from the peak in October last year.
</P>
<P>
Analysts at the Chung-Hua Institution for Economic Research,
however, contended that oil prices are very likely to rise above
US$50 a barrel in the near term, citing international concerns that
oil production might be disrupted by terrorist attacks as the Jan. 31
elections in Iraq approach.

CONFERENCE REJECTS IDEA OF HEALTH INSURANCE PREMIUM HIKE
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Jan. 22 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A conference held to get public input into
how to remedy the debt-ridden national health insurance program on
Saturday rejected the idea of hiking premiums.
</P>
<P>
The 20 participants in the three-day conference agreed
unanimously that action should be taken to save the program from
bankruptcy, but not through an increase in insurance premiums.
</P>
<P>
The conference was organized by National Taiwan University's
Sociology Department at the request of the National Health Insurance
Bureau.
</P>
<P>
The participants reached consensus that the health categories
covered by the program should not be reduced to deal with the
program's financial difficulties.
</P>
<P>
They suggested a change in how premiums are calculated, from a
percentage of an insured's salary to a percentage of their total
personal income, saying this would be a fairer system.
</P>
<P>
In order to raise funds to finance the program, they suggested
levying a health tax on cigarettes and aggressively pursuing claims
for damage on behalf of motor vehicle accident victims and against
employers negligent in occupational safety.
</P>
<P>
Abuse and waste in the health insurance program should be curbed
to decrease the program's costs, according to the conclusions reached
by the conference participants.
</P>
<P>
Liu Chien-hsiang, general manager of the National Health
Insurance Bureau, said the conclusions will be taken into account
when the bureau works out its proposal for improving the financial
health of the insurance program.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the bureaus' proposal will have to be approved by the
Department of Health and the Executive Yuan before it can take effect
and that the Legislative Yuan has passed a resolution forbidding the
Executive Yuan from raising national health insurance premiums before
the new legislature opens, Liu said his bureau will not cut corners
in working out its proposal for revamping the program.

The Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU) will not

Chen said that his party has decided in principle to nominate
incumbent or former legislators as TSU candidates to run in the
mayoral and county magistrate elections to be held around Taiwan in
December. A total of 23 city and county government heads will be
elected in the polls set for the final month of 2005.

The party will coordinate with the ruling Democratic Progressive
Party (DPP) on the nomination of candidates for the elections, Chen
promised, adding however that the TSU will absolutely not be absent
in the elections.

Liu Yi-teh, director of the TSU Organization Department, said
that participating in the elections is for the party's survival. The

<DATELINE>
Tainan, southern Taiwan,  Jan. 22 (CNA)
(By Nick Hunag)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The two-day annual global
census of black-faced spoonbills kicked off Saturday in Asia, with
preliminary counts showing 580 of the endangered birds in Tainan
County, according to officials from the Taiwan-based Wild Bird
Society (WBS).
</P>
<P>
The Hong Kong Bird Watching Society (HKBWS) , organizer of the
annual event, will collect the survey data on the rare migratory
birds from around Asia, including South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong,
Japan, Vietnam, the Philippines and Macau, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
In Taiwan, the census is being conducted by the WBS, the
Black-faced Spoonbill Conservation Society and the Happy Wild Bird
Association, the officials said, adding that currently, the number of
black-faced spoonbills counted in the Chiku Wetlands sanctuary near
the estuary of the Tsengwen River stands at 430, with a further 55 by
the Pachang brook, 43 in Tungyuwen, 35 at Peiyuwen, and 17 in
Tingshan, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
In last year's census, a total of 1,206 black-faced spoonbills
were counted worldwide, with about half wintering in Taiwan. This
year, the number of the rare birds wintering in Taiwan surpassed 780
as of Jan. 9, the officials said.

PRESIDENT CALLS FOR BETTER CHILDREN'S CARE
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Jan.  22 (CNA)
(By Huang Kwang-chun)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President Chen Shui-bian urged relevant
government agencies Saturday to thoroughly enforce laws and
regulations on children's welfare and to provide youngsters with
better health care and treatment.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a garden party held in the compound of the
Presidential Office to entertain physically challenged children,
aboriginal children, orphans, and kids from poor families, Chen said
that the relevant government agencies should formulate ways and means
to offer subsidies to families who are not able to pay the premiums
for their children's health insurance.
</P>
<P>
Some children have not enjoyed due medical care since the
government implemented a medical treatment assistance program for
children younger than three years old several years ago, because
their parents cannot pay their health insurance premiums, he pointed
out.
</P>
<P>
It is painful and regrettable to hear recent reports on the
maltreatment of children and even cases of children being forced to
commit suicide together with their parents, Chen lamented, adding
that these tragedies are mainly due to poverty.
</P>
<P>
There still exist poor people in Taiwan even though the country's
per capita income has surpassed US$14,000, the president noted.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the government's efforts, Chen promised that he
will do his best to work together with domestic enterprises, mass
media and social welfare organizations to raise charity funds for
needy children to improve their health care and treatment.

KINMEN, MATSU RESIDENTS KEENLY HOPE FOR AIR SERVICES VIA 'MINI LINKS'
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Jan.  22 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With the special cross-strait charter
flights for the upcoming Chinese New Year holiday set to take off,
the hopes of residents on the outlying islands of Kinmen and Matsu
for the establishment of the air links seems to be fading again,
local government officials said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Although the two islands have maintained direct trade, postal and
shipping links with Xiamen and Mawei ports in mainland China's Fujian
Province since the start of 2001, the officials said that local
residents have high expectations that air travel services could be
added to the so-called "mini three links" to further boost economic
and tourism development.
</P>
<P>
But the possibility seems extremely slim now that the direct
cross-strait charter flights to serve mainland-based Taiwan business
people returning home for the holiday are set to take off, the
officials said, adding that all the local people can do now is to
pray that the services will have a minimal impact on the "mini three
links."
</P>
<P>
Despite the fact that the "mini three links" have been in place
for over four years, Kinmen and Matsu residents are not satisfied
with the operations because of the many restrictions and lack of air
links.
</P>
<P>
Several recent polls have shown that most of the residents of the
islands give a failing grade to the services, and the Control Yuan
even asked the Executive Yuan earlier this month to remedy several
major shortcomings of the links and enhance their functions.
</P>
<P>
Kinmen and Matsu residents have repeatedly called on the central
government to set up air services via the "mini three links" to allow
the islands to effectively serve as a transshipment hub between
Taiwan and mainland China, but the government has repeatedly turned a
deaf ear to their calls, the officials claimed.
</P>
<P>
The residents are deeply concerned that they will be even more
negatively impacted if full links are set up between Taiwan and
mainland China in the future, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
Due to the longstanding political feud between Taiwan and
mainland China dating back to 1949 when the two sides split following
the Chinese civil war, direct trade, transport and postal links have
been absent across the strait.
</P>
<P>
The Taiwan authorities initiated the "mini three links" four
years ago to help boost development on the two islands

PROSPECTS GOOD FOR BETTER CROSS-STRAIT RELATIONS: MAC HEAD
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Washington,  Jan.  22 (CNA)
(By Oliver Lin and P.C. Tang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taiwan's top official for mainland
affairs said Saturday that he hopes that cross-Taiwan Strait
relations will have a better development in the near future.
</P>
<P>
Joseph Wu, chairman of the Mainland Affairs Council (MAC), made
the remarks while briefing media and local Taiwanese expatriates in
Washington about his meetings with members of the United States
Congress and think tank scholars.
</P>
<P>
Wu said he spoke on mainland China's proposed "anti-secession
law" targeting Taiwan and other matters after attending the Jan. 20
inauguration of U.S. President George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
Wu said that how to improve cross-strait relations concerns both
the United States and Taiwan, and that the United States has been
encouraged by the success of talks regarding direct cross-strait
charter flights for next month's Chinese Lunar New Year holidays.
</P>
<P>
In negotiations held Jan. 15 in Macau, representatives from
Taipei and Beijing reached an agreement to allow airlines from both
sides to fly into each other's territory from Jan. 29 to Feb. 20 to
serve China-based Taiwanese business people and their families.
</P>
<P>
Saying that Beijing intends to enact an "anti-secession law" at a
time when the United States has its hands full with events in Iraq
and other issues relating to Iran and North Korea, the MAC head noted
that if enacted, the proposed law will not only destroy the status
quo, but also endanger the security and stability in the Taiwan
Strait as well as the interests of the United States and Japan.
"Taiwan will not tolerate an 'anti-secession law,'" Wu added.
</P>
<P>
Pointing out that China has actively developed new weapons,
including middle and long-range missiles, cruise missiles and nuclear
submarines, Wu said that he told those in the United States that
China intents to expand its sphere of influence in the world.
</P>
<P>
Wu said that the people he spoke with were aware of the situation
and would speak up at an appropriate time.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Wu is still optimistic about the future development
of cross-strait relations, saying that he hopes things will improve
with the new year holidays.
</P>
<P>
Accompanied by David Lee, Taiwan's representative to the United
States, Wu, along with Academia Sinica President Lee Yuan-tseh, head
of the island's delegation to President Bush's inauguration, and
other members of the delegation, met with some 400 local Taiwanese
expatriates at a dinner gathering.

KMT-PFP TICKET EXPECTED FOR LEGISLATIVE LEADERSHIP ELECTION
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei, Jan. 23 (CNA)
(By Luis Huang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The opposition Kuomintang (KMT) and the
People First Party (PFP) are inclined to form a "KMT-PFP" ticket in
the election of Legislative Yuan speaker and vice speaker scheduled
for Feb. 1, a KMT legislator disclosed during an interview with CNA 
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
However, the cooperation of the "pan-blue alliance" in the race
for the legislative speakership and vice speakership and other
related issues will not be finalized until after a meeting between
the leaders of the two parties, said Tseng Yung-chuan, who also
serves as executive director of the KMT's Policy Committee.
</P>
<P>
Tseng said that Chang Hsien-yao, director of the PFP's policy
research center, telephoned him Sunday morning and asked for an early
determination of the KMT-PFP ticket so that a joint task force can be
formed to campaign for the KMT-PFP ticket in the upcoming legislative
speaker and vice speaker elections.
</P>
<P>
Noting that KMT officials also shared Chang's opinion, Tseng said
that KMT Chairman Lien Chan will meet with his PFP counterpart James
Soong to make a final determination for the issue immediately after
he returns from the United States.
</P>
<P>
Once the KMT-PFP ticket is determined, the KMT will closely
cooperate with the PFP under the principles of mutual respect and
trust in order to win the legislative speaker and vice speaker
elections, Tseng stressed.
</P>
<P>
He further said judging from recent close cooperation between the
two parties in the deliberation of 2005 general budget plan and
various draft bills, the KMT and the PFP still remain firm on their
partnership although the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) is
actively courting the PFP and has reportedly sounded out the
possibility of PFP-DPP cooperation in various major issues.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the PFP legislative caucus is scheduled to conduct a
straw poll Monday afternoon to decide which legislator would be most
suitable for running for the legislative vice speakership.
</P>
<P>
Three PFP legislators -- Chung Jung-chi, who has served as the
party's secretary-general, Lee Ching-hua and Shen Chih-hui -- have
expressed strong interest in vying for the vice speakership,
according to sources close to the party.
</P>
<P>
The sources said that PFP Vice Chairman Chang Chao-hsiung, acting
Secretary-General Chin Chin-sheng and even Soong himself will not get
involved in the fierce competition, adding that everything will be up
to the PFP legislative caucus.
</P>
<P>
In other related news, Huang Tsung-yuan, the chief convener of
the legislative caucus of the opposition Taiwan Solidarity Union
(TSU) , said that so far the party has not decided which ticket its
lawmakers will vote for in the legislative speaker and vice speaker
elections.
</P>
<P>
After the outgoing TSU chairman hands over his post to the newly
elected chairman Jan. 27, the party's Central Executive Committee
will call a meeting that day to decide which ticket to vote for,
Huang pointed out.
</P>
<P>
For his part, Yen Ching-piao, the chief convener of the
Non-Partisan Solidarity Union (NPSU) legislative caucus, said that it
is too early to talk about which ticket the party will support as
candidates of the ruling and opposition parties for the speakership
and vice speakership have yet to be determined.
</P>
<P>
The fifth legislature formally went into recess Jan. 21, and
legislators-elect from the ruling and opposition parties will elect
new speaker and vice speaker of the sixth legislature to be
inaugurated Feb. 1.

</P>
<P>
Incumbent Speaker Wang Jin-pyng, who is the KMT's No. 1
legislator-at-large, is actively seeking support from lawmakers from
across the political spectrum for re-election.
</P>
<P>
In the new 225-seat legislature, the ruling DPP will remain the
largest party with 89 seats, followed by the KMT with 79 seats, the
PFP with 34 seats and the TSU with 12 seats. The remaining seats
belong to the NPSU and independents.

ROC WATCHFUL OF PRC DELEGATION'S VISITS TO HAITI, DOMINICAN REPUBLIC
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Panama City, Jan. 22 (CNA)
(By M.H. Huang and P.C. Tang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Personnel from the Republic of China's
embassies in Haiti and the Dominican Republic are closely watching
the activities of a visiting delegation from Beijing to these two
Caribbean countries.
</P>
<P>
Headed by Cai Wu, deputy head of the Chinese Communist Party's
International Liaison Department, the delegation, which is in
Port-au-Prince for a two-day visit, has met with Premier Gerard
Latortue and Minister of Foreign Affairs Yvon Simeon of the Haitian
provisional government.
</P>
<P>
According to a political attache of the ROC Embassy in Haiti, the
main purpose of the Chinese delegation in this part of the world is
to attend an annual international socialist conference held in
various Caribbean and Central and South American countries.
</P>
<P>
The official also said that Haitian provisional President
Bonniface Alexandre has refused to receive the delegation and that
his embassy is trying to get a better understanding of the details of
the meetings held between the delegation and high-ranking Haitian
officials.
</P>
<P>
As to Xinhua News Agency's report on Simeon's comments that
"lacking the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and
Haiti will not last long, " the attache said that he does not believe
that the Haitian foreign minister made the remarks, adding that
basically, the Haitian provisional government has no power to
establish or to severe diplomatic relations with other countries.
</P>
<P>
He also admitted that the ROC Embassy in Haiti could not prevent
China from sending delegations to inspect its peacekeeping troops
stationed in the Caribbean country, adding that Beijing Ambassador to
the United Nations Wang Quang-yi also visited Haiti in mid-December
last year.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the ROC's new ambassador to Haiti is expected to
arrive in the country Sunday and will probably present his
credentials to the Haitian provisional president Jan. 27 or 28.
</P>
<P>
The delegation is scheduled to leave for the Dominican Republic
Jan. 24 and during the visit will meet with leading members of main
Dominican Republic political parties. According to the ROC Embassy in
Santo Domingo, Beijing sent two delegations and a cultural group to
visit the country earlier this month.

DPP TO DECIDE ON SPEAKER, DEPUTY SPEAKER CANDIDATES WEDNESDAY
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Jan.  23 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The legislative caucus of the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) will hold a meeting Wednesday to
discuss its ticket for the new Legislative Yuan's speaker and deputy
speaker elections, acting DPP Chairman Ker Chien-ming said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The new legislature will begin Feb. 1 when all the 225 newly
sworn-in lawmakers will also elect among themselves a speaker and
deputy speaker.
</P>
<P>
Ker said he is consulting leading figures of various DPP factions
to seek their opinions about the party's candidates for the two top
legislative posts.
</P>
<P>
"We hope to reach an intraparty consensus on the ticket through
consultations. Otherwise, the DPP caucus will hold a primary vote to
decide on the ticket," Ker said.
</P>
<P>
Theoretically, Ker said, incumbent DPP Secretary-General Chang
Chun-hsiung, who will be a legislator-at large in the new
legislature, is the party's top choice for the speaker post.
Nevertheless, he said, Chang's candidacy is still pending the caucus'
final discussion.
</P>
<P>
As to the candidate for deputy speaker, Ker said a primary vote
by all caucus members may have to be held.
</P>
<P>
The DPP, which will have 89 seats in the new legislature,
originally hoped to forge a working partnership with the opposition
People First Party (PFP), which controls 34 seats, to facilitate the
implementation of its reform agenda. Some DPP lawmakers previously
proposed a DPP-PFP ticket for the speaker and deputy speaker
elections. However, the hope for a DPP-PFP coalition has dimmed after
the PFP caucus announced that it will cooperate with its traditional
"pan-blue" ally of the Kuomintang (KMT), who has 79 seats in the new
legislature in the speaker and deputy speaker elections.
</P>
<P>
The PFP caucus has thrown support behind the re-election bid of
incumbent Legislative Yuan President Wang Jin-pyng, who is also a KMT
vice chairman, but it has yet to decide on its candidate for deputy
speaker.
</P>
<P>
DPP sources claimed that some KMT members are still hopeful that
incumbent Legislative Yuan Vice President P. K. Chiang can remain at
his post. If the "pan-blue alliance" cannot consolidate its internal
unity, the sources said, the DPP still stands a chance of winning the
deputy speaker post.
</P>
<P>
Tsai Huang-liang, a DPP caucus whip, said the DPP is continuing
to woo the PFP to cooperate in the speaker and deputy speaker
elections.
</P>
<P>
"We'll not give up our efforts until Jan. 31. We are even willing
to support a PFP-DPP ticket, " Tsai said, adding that if the PFP is
willing to cooperate, the DPP doesn't rule out supporting a PFP
candidate for speaker.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Tsai said the DPP is also seeking to cooperate with the
Taiwan Solidarity Union and the Non-Partisan Solidarity Union in the
deputy speaker election.

ANOTHER SECTION OF KEELUNG RIVER DREDGING WORK COMPLETED
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei, Jan. 23 (CNA)
(By Luis Huang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Improvements along a stretch of the Keelung
River in Sichi township in Taipei County have been completed to
prevent flooding, with Premier Yu Shyi-kun presided over a completion
ceremony Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Yu sang the praises of President Chen Shui-bian's ruling team,
saying that this, the 11th stage of an ambitious program to prevent
flooding along the Keelung River, highlights the effectiveness of
Chen's administration.
</P>
<P>
The nation's sound civil service system has made it possible for
the government to carry out various construction projects after the
power transition from the Kuomintang (KMT) to the Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) , Yu pointed out. Yu said if the ruling and
opposition parties can cooperate on major projects such as this one,
Taiwan's overall competitive edge will be enhanced.
</P>
<P>
The former KMT government failed to solve the flooding problems

DPP TO NOMINATE BEST CANDIDATES FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENT HEAD ELECTIONS
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Jan.  23 (CNA)
(By Luis Huang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The ruling Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) will nominate the best candidates to vie for local government
heads as the year-end mayoral and magistrate elections are quite
important for the party, Presidential Office Secretary-General Su
Tseng-chang said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Su's remarks came in response to media reports that President
Chen Shui-bian is planning to invite several outgoing government
officials in charge of administrative affairs to run in the elections
for mayors and county magistrates after the Cabinet resign en masse
Monday.
</P>
<P>
According to Su, nominating DPP candidates to participate in the
upcoming mayoral and county magistrate elections will be one of his
most important tasks after he takes up the DPP chairmanship. Su is
the sole candidate in the by-election for DPP chairman to be held
Jan. 30 after President Chen resigned from the post to assume
responsibility for the party's worse-than-expected performance in the
Dec. 11 legislative elections.
</P>
<P>
As for Chen's plan to encourage outgoing Cabinet members to run,
Su said this will be up to whether these officials are accepted by
local voters or not.
</P>
<P>
If the DPP's local chapters can recommend prominent candidates to
run in the year-end elections, the party will respect their
decisions, Su noted. For the constituencies where DPP candidates are
relatively weak, the DPP will consider recruiting outgoing Cabinet
members to join the year-end elections, he added.

TAIWAN LOOKS FORWARD TO CLOSER OIL COOPERATION WITH CHAD: PRESIDENT

<TEXT>
<P>
President Chen Shui-bian said Sunday the
Republic of China looks forward to expanding petroleum exploration
cooperation with Chad.
</P>
<P>
Chen made the remarks while holding talks with visiting Chadian
President Idriss Deby at the Presidential Office.
</P>
<P>
Chad formally became an oil exporting country in October 2003 and
has signed a memorandum of understanding with Taiwan on cooperation
in oil exploration and petrochemical development.
</P>
<P>
Chen said he is hopeful that Deby can assist in furthering
Taiwan-Chadian cooperation in petroleum exploration.
</P>
<P>
Deby arrived in Taipei earlier in the day for a three-day state
visit. This is his third visit to Taiwan since assuming the Chadian
presidency.
</P>
<P>
Before their meeting at the Presidential Office, Chen presided
over a welcoming ceremony at the Chiang Kai-shek Memorial Hall
complex in downtown Taipei in honor of Deby. The Chadian leader was
accorded full military honors in the ceremony, including a 21-gun
salute.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the ceremony, Chen said that Sunday happened to be
Freedom Day in Taiwan. Deby's arrival on Freedom Day symbolizes that
the cordial relationship between Taiwan and Chad is based on their
shared values in freedom and democracy.
</P>
<P>
Chen also lauded Deby for his contributions to helping resolve
armed conflicts in the Darfur region in Sudan to promote stability in
Africa.
</P>
<P>
During his current visit, Deby will travel to Kaoshiung to visit
a marine base and Chinese Petroleum Corp.'s refinery in southern
Taiwan. He will also visit major cultural and economic institutions
in northern Taiwan and meet with local business and industry leaders.
</P>
<P>
Relations between Taiwan and Chad have been cordial since the two
countries resumed full diplomatic ties in 1997. President Chen headed
a large entourage to visit the central African ally in August 2000.
</P>
<P>
Deby has on many occasions spoken out in support of Taiwan's bid
to join the United Nations, the World Health Organization and other
major international organizations.

STUDY BIGGEST SOURCE OF STRESS FOR YOUNG STUDENTS: ANALYSIS
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Jan.  23 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Having to study is the biggest source of
stress for school children on both sides of the Taiwan Strait
according to children's paintings analyzed by the John Jung
Foundation.
</P>
<P>
"This is the finding of a painting contest participated in by
elementary school children in Taiwan's greater Taipei area and Ningpo
City in mainland China's Zhejiang province, " said Huang Chen-tai,
executive director of the John Tung Foundation, a non-profit group
dedicated to promoting public health.
</P>
<P>
The foundation held the painting contest between July and October
2004, with entrants required to depict their mood and ways to ease
their depression or ill feelings. The foundation collected 1,582
paintings by school children in Taipei City and Taipei County as well
as 564 by their Ningpo counterparts.
</P>
<P>
It marked the first time that the foundation has held a
cross-strait cooperative program to promote mental health education.
</P>
<P>
Analyzing the works, Huang said the entries demonstrated
interesting cultural diversities resulting from different living
environments, languages and lifestyles.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, he said, all the works indicated that academic
study is the top source of stress for young students; followed by
worries about being scolded by parents due to poor exam scores or
having to learn various skills.
</P>
<P>
The contest also found that Taiwan students' paintings were more
colorful and more imaginative, while mainland students' works were
mostly in monotone and dull colors and more realistic in their
expression.

OUTGOING JUSTICE MINISTER FORMALLY ANNOUNCES BID FOR TOP ILAN POST
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Ilan,  Taiwan,  Jan.  23 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Minister of Justice Chen Ding-nan
formally announced his bid Sunday to run for the magistrate post in
his home county of Ilan in the year-end election.
</P>
<P>
Chen made the announcement at a news conference held at the Ilan
County Hall in the company of incumbent Ilan Magistrate Liu
Shou-cheng whose second term will expire late this year.
</P>
<P>
The clean-image minister said he is determined to return to Ilan
to prepare for the year-end election after he joins with Prime
Minister Yu Shyi-kun and other Cabinet members in tendering
resignations en masse Monday.
</P>
<P>
Chen said his decision is a response to calls from his
supporters to run again for the post he served in from 1981 to 1989.
</P>
<P>
"I couldn't ignore the repeated appeals from my supporters at
home for me to lead them in developing Ilan," Chen said, adding that
Ilan will face great challenges with the inauguration of the Peiyi
Expressway at the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the expressway, which will shorten the driving time
between Taipei and Ilan to about 40 minutes from the current more
than two hours, will bring both opportunities and challenges to Ilan,
Chen said he feels compelled to run for the county's top post again
to lead it to a brighter future.
</P>
<P>
Chen has been in his current post for four years and eight
months. As the general public do not fully understand the power and
functions of the Ministry of Justice (MOJ) , Chen said some people
have mistakenly taken him to task for many judicial and social
problems.
</P>
<P>
In Taiwan, Chen said, the MOJ is just responsible for
investigation of official corruption, vote-buying and criminal cases.
The ministry is not empowered to try criminal suspects or maintain
public order, Chen said, adding that he hopes his successor will no
longer face the similar broadsides heaped on him.

U.S. SCHOLARS CALL FOR WORLD ATTENTION TO TAIWAN PEOPLE'S ASPIRATION

<TEXT>
<P>
A group of U.S. scholars said Saturday
that the international community should not ignore Taiwan's
nationalism simply because of the so-called "one China" policy.
</P>
<P>
The academics made the call at a "Taiwanese nationalism
vs. Chinese nationalism" seminar, co-sponsored by the Taipei Economic
and Cultural Office in Los Angeles and the Center for Chinese Studies
at the University of California - Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
It marked the first time that an American academic institution
has ever organized a seminar to address the cross-Taiwan Strait
issues in light of their people's feelings, sentiments, historical
developments and contemporary national and social
situations.
</P>
<P>
Richard Baum, director of Center for Chinese Studies, presided
over the seminar held at the UCLA's Bunche Hall. The
participants included Prof. Stanley Rosen of the University of
Southern California, Prof. Edward Friedman of the University of
Wisconsin and Prof. Peter Gries of the University of Colorado. Chang
Mao-kuei, a research fellow at Academia Sinica, Taiwan's top research
body, also traveled from Taipei to Los Angeles to attend the
symposium.
</P>
<P>
The participants agreed that the international community should
pay heed to Taiwan people's opinion and aspiration for freedom
and democracy as well as their sense of Taiwanese identity separate
from China's.
</P>
<P>
In the face of mainland China's plan to enact a
so-called anti-secession law targeting Taiwan, Rosen said Taiwan
should step up international publicity to let the world understand
that Beijing's move could lead to regional instability.

ABUSED GIRL DONATES ORGANS AFTER BEING PRONOUNCED 'BRAIN DEAD'
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei, Jan. 23 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The 4-year-old girl who was refused
admission to a series of Taipei hospitals after being
critically injured by her abusive father two weeks ago died at a
Taichung County hospital in central Taiwan Sunday.
</P>
<P>
With the consent of her family, the girl, surnamed Chiu, donated
her organs after being pronounced "brain dead" earlier in the day.
Her kidneys were transplanted to a 55-year-old woman at Taichung
Veterans Hospital, while her liver has been sent to Kaohsiung Chang
Gung Memorial Hospital in southern Taiwan for transplant to
any suitable patient.
</P>
<P>
The girl's body was transported back to Taipei under the escort
of Chang Hang, director of the Taipei municipal health department,
and Hsueh Cheng-tai, director of the municipal bureau of social
affairs.
</P>
<P>
Chang said Chiu's ordeal highlighted many flaws and deficiencies
in Taiwan's medical system and alerted the central and local
governments to take necessary steps to plug the holes.
</P>
<P>
"We'll not let the girl die in vain. We have worked out 10
measures, including strengthening the hospital transfer network in
the emergency medical system to prevent recurrence of a
similar tragedy," Chang said.
</P>
<P>
The girl was first rushed to the Taipei Municipal Jen Ai
Hospital Jan. 10, but a neurosurgeon didn't bother to
examine her brain injuries while insisting on having the girl
transferred to other hospitals for a surgery on the excuse that Jen 
Ai's ICU ward was already fully occupied.
</P>
<P>
The girl ended up being transported to a hospital more than 100
kilometers away in the central county of Taichung for surgery.
After 14 days of intensive care, the condition of the comatose girl
didn't improve and she was declared "brain dead" through a
complicated medical procedures.
</P>
<P>
Chiu's ordeal had triggered an uproar which led to an
investigation into why the 4-year-old was refused treatment when
there were sufficient bed in Taipei hospitals.
</P>
<P>
The Cabinet-level Department of Health announced Friday that it
would make changes to the existing system for patient transfers. The
new system will take effect in June.

The Times: Election is lost already, top adviser
tells Howard.

Michael Howard's election guru has told him that the Conservatives
have no hope of winning the next general election. 

The crushing blow from Lynton Crosby, the Australian campaign expert
hired by Mr Howard at great expense to bring about a surprise Tory victory,
came as Mr Howard attempted yesterday to put immigration and asylum at
the heart of the party's election campaign. 

The opposition leader was accused of desperation for his personal pledge
to restrict immigration to Britain, to be presented in a speech today as a Tory
vote-winner. 



Financial Times: Centreal Banks shift funds away from US.

Central banks are shifting reserves away from the US and
towards the eurozone in a move that looks set to deepen the
Bush administration's difficulties in financing its ballooning
current account deficit. 

In actions likely to undermine the dollar's value on currency
markets, 70 percent of central bank reserve managers said they
had increased their exposure to the euro over the past two years.
The majority thought eurozone money and debt markets were as
attractive a destination for investment as the US.

MAC HEAD EXPLAINS TAIWAN'S MAINLAND POLICY ON C-SPAN PROGRAM
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Washington,  Jan.  23 (CNA)
(By Oliver Lin and P.C.Tang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taiwan's top official for mainland
affairs said Sunday that the agreement on direct cross-strait flights
for the Lunar New Year holidays is significant, expressing the hope
that Beijing would show similar flexibility to engage in cross-strait
dialogue and to reduce tensions between the two sides of the Taiwan
Strait.
</P>
<P>
Joseph Wu, chairman of Mainland Affairs Council (MAC), made the
comments while explaining Taiwan's mainland policy in a call-in
program that was broadcast live on C-Span, a public television
channel with about 60 million viewers.
</P>
<P>
Wu, who is the first Taiwanese official to appear on the program
in recent years, said that the Lunar New Year holiday cross-strait
flights will represent the first time since 1949 for airlines from
both sides of the Taiwan Strait to launch direct charter flight
services across the strait.
</P>
<P>
In negotiations held Jan. 15 in Macau, representatives from
Taipei and Beijing reached an agreement to allow airlines from Taiwan
and the mainland to fly into each other's territory from Jan. 29 to
Feb. 20 to serve China-based Taiwanese businesspeople and their
families.
</P>
<P>
Asked why Beijing agreed to the launching of direct cross-strait
flights, the MAC head said that Taiwan had invited the mainland
several times since last October to hold negotiations on the
launching of direct charter flights and that Beijing had eventually
realized that such services would help reduce cross-strait tensions.
</P>
<P>
The requests by China-based Taiwanese businesspeople and their
families who want to return to Taiwan during the Lunar New Year
holidays and the encouragement by the United States to engage in a
cross-strait dialogue were also factors that led Beijing to sign the
agreement, Wu further said.
</P>
<P>
Touching on issues relating to the mainland's retaining of the
option of the use of force against Taiwan, the MAC chairman said that
Beijing has continued to try to intimidate Taiwan, including raising
a proposal to enact an anti-secession.
</P>
<P>
Beijing also recently released a national defense white paper
threatening to crush Taiwan, Wu continued, adding that therefore,
cross-strait tensions remain high and that the best way to reduce
such tensions is for the two sides to engage in dialogue and to
increase mutual understanding.

MANDATORY MILITARY SERVICE TO BE SHORTENED TO 18 MONTHS
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Jan.  24 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Executive Yuan announced Monday that
the period of mandatory military service will be shortened from the
current 22 months to 18 months, effective July 1.
</P>
<P>
This was one of the new policies announced by the Executive Yuan
at its last meeting before Premier Yu Shyi-kun led the Cabinet to
resign en masse Monday ahead of the start of the new legislature Feb.
1.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Vice Minister of National Defense Tsai
Ming-hsien announced that under a conscription system reform program,
the mandatory military service period will be shortened and salaries
for conscripts will be increased while recruitment of volunteer
soldiers will be accelerated in the years to come.
</P>
<P>
Tsai said that under the program, the period of mandatory
military service is expected to be further shortened to 12 months by
2008.
</P>
<P>
Under the program, he added, it is hoped that a ratio of three
volunteer soldiers to two conscripts will be achieved in three years.
</P>
<P>
The minister said the Ministry of National Defense has been
studying the feasibility of shortening the mandatory military service
period in two stages in tandem with the gradual implementation of an
all-volunteer military service system.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Tsai said, the monthly salary for those doing their
military service will be raised to an average of NT$35,000 (US$1,094)
as the program is being implemented, Tsai said.
</P>
<P>
Currently, the monthly salary for those joining the trial
voluntary military service program, which began to be implemented in
2003, is about NT$27,000, or about the same as that for any civilian
beginning their first job, and therefore offers no incentive to young
men to join the military. This is probably one of the reasons why the
trial voluntary military service program has not been as popular as
was expected.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of National Defense will also assist these people to
acquire professional training and obtain related certificates during
the military service period so as to allow them to be well-prepared
to enter the civilian job market when they leave the military, Tsai
added.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, Tsai said, the maximum age for mandatory military
service will also be lowered from the current 40 to 35.
</P>
<P>
Tsai said that the planned shortening of the period of mandatory
service will not undermine the military's overall combat capabilities
as modern warfare stresses "beyond-vision" and "no-contact" combat
strategies, adding that the military needs to recruit more
professional or career soldiers instead of conscripts.

PRESIDENT CHEN PUSHES FOR TAIWAN, PARAGUAY FREE TRADE PACT
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Jan.  24  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President Chen Shui-bian once again
expressed his eagerness Monday to see Taiwan and Paraguay sign a free
trade agreement (FTA) to further bolster bilateral business ties
between the two diplomatic allies.
</P>
<P>
Chen said that if necessary, he would travel to the Paraguayan
capital of Asuncion in person to sign the FTA with Paraguayan
President Nicanor Duarte Frutos.
</P>
<P>
The president made the remarks when he was meeting with visiting
Paraguayan Vice President Luis Alberto Castiglioni Soria and his
wife at the Presidential Office.
</P>
<P>
Chen expressed appreciation for President Duarte's support voiced
at the United Nations last September for Taiwan's bid to join the
organization and other world bodies.
</P>
<P>
Chen also expressed his admiration for President Duarte's
attending his second-term inauguration May 20 last year, saying that
Duarte was the first leader of a Republic of China ally to visit
after he won re-election.
</P>
<P>
He and Duarte pledged at that time to promote the signing of an
FTA between the two countries, the president said.
</P>
<P>
Chen expressed the hope earlier this month that he could travel
to Paraguay this year to sign the FTA. The president voiced his hope
when he bestowed the Order of Brilliant Star with Special Grand
Cordon upon visiting speaker of the Paraguayan House of
Representatives Oscar Ruben Salomon Fernandez.

<P>
Cho Jung-tai, deputy secretary-general to
the Presidential Office, is expected to serve as the
secretary-general of the Executive Yuan, an unidentified source close
to the situation said Monday.
</P>
<P>
The source made the remarks after Premier Yu Shyi-kun led the
Cabinet to resign en masse Monday with Kaohsiung Mayor Frank Hsieh
expected to head the new Cabinet.
</P>
<P>
Cho's appointment came as no surprise as he is a protege of Hsieh
and has experience as the deputy secretary-general of the
Presidential Office.
</P>
<P>
It has yet to be decided who will take over the posts of vice
premier and spokesman of the Executive Yuan.
</P>
<P>
The Cabinet reshuffle is not expected to be extensive, especially
for those in the Cabinet who have been tapped as candidates of the
ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) for the year-end magistrate
and mayoral elections. They will remain in the Cabinet to stay in the
public eye.
</P>
<P>
It is expected that only after the DPP completes nominating
candidates for the year-end magistrate and mayoral elections in May
that the political appointees will then resign to focus on
campaigning. There will be a second reshuffle then and the scale is
expected to be bigger.

PREMIER YU TO TAKE UP PREVIOUS POST AS PRESIDENT'S CHIEF OF STAFF
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Jan. 24 (CNA)

<TEXT>
<P>
Outgoing Premier Yu Shyi-kun will serve as
President Chen Shui-bian's chief of staff, a post that Yu once held
before assuming the premiership Feb. 1, 2002, reliable political
sources said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Yu and all Cabinet members resigned en masse Monday after holding
the Cabinet's last meeting. The resignation paves the way for the
formation of a new Cabinet ahead of the inauguration of a new
Legislative Yuan Feb. 1.
</P>
<P>
The Presidential Office is scheduled to hold a news conference
Tuesday to announce who will succeed Yu as premier. It is almost
definite that Kaohsiung Mayor Frank Hsieh will get the nod.
</P>
<P>
Since Yu has been one of President Chen's confidants, political
sources said Yu will return to the post as Chen's chief of staff,
also known as the Presidential Office secretary-general, after
stepping down from the premiership.
</P>
<P>
Yu won't be the first presidential chief of staff to return to
the post after having served as premier, the sources said. During
Taiwan's martial law era, Chang Chun served as then-President Chiang
Kai-shek's chief of staff before becoming premier.
</P>
<P>
After leaving the premiership, Chang again served as Chiang's
chief of staff, the sources said. To accommodate Chang, Chiang
upgraded the post of the presidential secretary-general to the level
of the premier and chiefs of the four other central government
branches -- the Legislative Yuan, the Judicial Yuan, the Control Yuan
and the Examination Yuan.

<TEXT>
<P>
Premier Yu Shyi-kun led his Cabinet in
resigning en masse Monday, paving the way for a reshuffle in line
with the formation of a new legislature on Feb. 1.
</P>
<P>
On tendering the resignation en masse in a special Cabinet
meeting, Yu said this day marks the perfect conclusion for his
three-year term and that it is his great honor to have had the chance
to lead the Cabinet team in contributing to the country.
</P>
<P>
Yu noted that the efforts made by the Cabinet team helped the
ruling Democratic Progressive Party and President Chen Shui-bian win
last year's presidential election, saying the contribution of his
Cabinet will be remembered in history.
</P>
<P>
Yu said Taiwan has survived a global economic recession and also
endured an unprecedented period of political turmoil under the
leadership of his Cabinet.
</P>
<P>
While the country's economic growth rate, foreign reserves and
budget execution rate have been rising over the past three years, the
unemployment rate, overdue loans of local banks and workplace
fatalities have been declining, Yu pointed out.
</P>
<P>
For example, Yu said, the economic growth rate jumped from minus
2.22 percent in 2001 to the projected 5.93 percent in 2004, the
highest level in seven years.
</P>
<P>
The unemployment rate, meanwhile, fell to 4.44 percent in 2004,
the lowest since 2001, and the average working population also hit a
10-year high, Yu added.
</P>
<P>
Also, the country's overall competitiveness has continued to rise
and this achievement has been recognized in various international
assessments, he said.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Yu noted, his Cabinet has put forth a series of
innovative plans such as the "challenge 2008" national development
project and "10 major construction projects."
</P>
<P>
The meeting was attended by all Cabinet members with the
exception of Minister of Foreign Affairs Tan Sun Chen and Mainland
Affairs Council Chairman Joseph Wu.
</P>
<P>
After the meeting, a group photo was taken of the attending
Cabinet members at the gate of the Executive Yuan and Yu gave a brief
farewell speech in which he thanked his colleagues and the public for
their support over the past three years.

<TEXT>
<P>
A Kaohsiung-based tuna fishing boat that
was reported missing Jan. 12, is believed to have been commandeered
by Chinese deckhands who mutinied.
</P>
<P>
A representative for Tongsong Fishing Company -- owner of the
"Tongyi No. 668" -- who flew to Malaysia to look into the incident
said Monday that the tuna fishing boat was intercepted by a Malaysian
navy frigate Sunday because the ship was sailing erratically near
Malaysian territorial waters.
</P>
<P>
The officers and crew of the "Tongyi No. 668" are currently being
interrogated in Malaysia and further information is not known, the
representative said.
</P>
<P>
According to the representative, "Tongyi No. 668" Captain Chen
Kuo-ching telephoned the company and his family in Kaohsiung to tell
them that he is safe, except for some minor injuries sustained during
a struggle with the mutineers.
</P>
<P>
The representative said that his company is grateful to the
Malaysian navy for intercepting the vessel before things got out of
control.
</P>
<P>
He quoted Chen as saying that three other officers on board also
sustained minor injuries during the incident, but they are all fine.
</P>
<P>
Twenty-four other deckhands on the tuna fishing boat are either
mainland Chinese or Filipino nationals.
</P>
<P>
The 493-ton tuna fishing vessel with 28 crew members aboard lost
communications Jan. 12 while fishing about 700 nautical miles off the
west coast of the Maldives.

<TEXT>
<P>
The Bureau of Foreign Trade (BOFT) under
the Ministry of Economic Affairs is slated to host a seminar Jan. 31
to help Taiwan companies explore the mainland's retail market, a
bureau spokesman said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Legal experts will be invited to explain mainland China's
relevant laws and regulations and to elaborate on the risks and
details involved in the retail and distribution sectors. The seminar
is open to domestic businesses interested in expanding into the
promising market.
</P>
<P>
The BOFT move came after the mainland authorities allowed the
establishment of foreign-owned enterprises in the two sectors and
some specially authorized businesses since December of last year, an
opening that is expected to yield many business opportunities for
Taiwan companies, he said.
</P>
<P>
Backed by a high flying economy, mainland China surged to become
the world's third-largest economy last year, with foreign trade of
US$1.1 trillion, he added.
</P>
<P>
Two-way trade between Taiwan and the mainland is estimated to
have been more than US$60 billion in 2004, with about 90 percent of
the businesses centering on industrial goods and raw materials, he
said, noting that Taiwan's shipment of daily consumer products to
mainland China accounted for a very small percentage.

Ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)
Legislator Trong Chai announced Monday his decision to run for the
speakership of the Legislative Yuan.
</P>
<P>
Chai made public his bid after DPP Secretary-General Chang
Chun-hsiung said earlier that day that he would not run for the post.
</P>
<P>
Chang, who has been a legislator for 17 years, will return to the
Legislative Yuan on Feb. 1 when he will be sworn in as a legislator
at-large in the new legislature.
</P>
<P>
Chai said as the largest party in the legislature, the DPP must
vie for the speakership and that he will try to win the support of
the DPP legislative caucus.
</P>
<P>
According to Chai, President Chen Shui-bian is aware of his plan
to run for the speakership and did not stop him from going ahead.
</P>
<P>
Chai said he has started to lobby the support of legislators from
the opposition Kuomintang (KMT) and People First Party (PFP) but he
would not disclose further details.
</P>
<P>
With the support of the KMT and its ally, the PFP, which together
enjoy a slim majority in the legislature, two-term Speaker Wang

DPP SECRETARY-GENERAL NOT TO RUN FOR SPEAKER OF LEGISLATURE
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei, Jan. 24 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Chang Chun-hsiung, secretary-general of the
ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) , announced Monday that he
will not run for speaker of the Legislative Yuan.
</P>
<P>
Chang said that since cooperation between the DPP and the
opposition People First Party (PFP) for the race has fallen short of
expectations, the premise for him to run for the post no longer
exists.
</P>
<P>
Chang said that he will now devote himself to the good of the
nation as an at-large legislator in the legislature, and will not run
for any posts in the DPP legislative caucus.
</P>
<P>
Noting that after the Dec. 11 legislative elections, the
opposition "pan-blue alliance" of the Kuomintang (KMT) and the PFP
maintained its majority in the legislature, and pointing out how
President Chen Shui-bian responded to public calls for party-to-party
cooperation, Chang stressed that his candidacy for speaker would have
been for "inter-party cooperation and political stability."
</P>
<P>
He said that the DPP had originally sought cooperation from the
PFP, and even suggested a "PFP-DPP" ticket after PFP Chairman James
Soong said in the United States that he would support the present
speaker, Wang Jin-pyng, who is also a KMT vice chairman, for
re-election.
</P>
<P>
Chang said that the party will respect the decision of the DPP
legislative caucus on the speaker and vice speaker elections in the
legislature, adding that once the DPP decides on party candidates or
cooperation with other parties, all DPP legislators will toe the
party line.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Tsai Huang-liang, DPP caucus whip in the legislature,
stressed that the DPP will not be absent from the speaker and vice
speaker elections Feb. 1, and will have its own candidates, but will
also not rule out the possibility of cooperating with other parties.
</P>
<P>
Tsai said that the DPP could cooperate with the Non-Partisan
Solidarity Union, the Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU), or a "PFP-DPP"
ticket.
</P>
<P>
The legislative caucus will meet Wednesday to decide on how
inter-party cooperation could work and then consider nominating
candidates.
</P>
<P>
Tsai said that although the DPP is now in an inferior position,
it will not give up till the last moment, adding that "everything
could still change."
</P>
<P>
Tsai also dismissed the allegation by the KMT that the DPP is
trying to buy votes with NT$100 million (US$3.15 million) , adding
that KMT Secretary-General Lin Feng-cheng is "talking nonsense."
</P>
<P>
The DPP is currently the largest party in the legislature with 89
seats, while the KMT trails with 79 seats. The PFP has 34 seats and
the TSU 12.

TAIWAN RANKS FIFTH IN WEALTH OF DEVELOPING COUNTRIES RATINGS
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taiwan ranks fifth in a national wealth
rating of developing countries compiled by the World Paper and Money
Matters Institute, up a notch from a year ago.
</P>
<P>
The Wealth of Nations Triangle Index has been issued annually
since 1996. It measures the balanced development potential of 70
developing countries around the world in terms of three subindexes --
economic environment, social environment and information exchanges --
on the premise that sustainable growth is dependent on balance. With
a total of 63 variables, 21 variables in each of the three subindexes
are gauged. 
</P>
<P>
In the newly released 2004 Wealth of Nations Triangle
Index, Taiwan ranked fifth with a total score of 1,816, marking a
notch up from the 2003 rating.
</P>
<P>
South Korea ranked top in the 2003 survey, but dropped two
notches to third place in the 2004 rating. South Korea and Taiwan
were the only two Asian developing countries to make the top 10 list
for 2004.

</P>
<P>
Slovenia topped the 2004 rating followed by Israel, South
Korea, the Czech Republic, Taiwan, Estonia, Hungary, the Slovak
Republic, Lithuania, and Latvia, in that order. Seven of the top 10
nations were East European countries.
</P>
<P>
Mainland China ranked 27th, up seven notches from the 2003
rating. In terms of the economic environment index, mainland China
ranked sixth, higher than Slovenia's and Taiwan's rankings, but its
social environment rating was very low.

TSU TO PUSH FOR AMENDMENT TO DOMESTIC VIOLENCE LAW
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Jan. 24 (CNA)
(By Elizabeth Hsu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Amending the Anti-Domestic Violence Law to
better protect the citizens of Taiwan is a priority for the Taiwan
Solidarity Union (TSU) in the upcoming legislature, a TSU official
said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Citing Ministry of the Interior statistics, Chiang Yue-chin, who
heads the TSU's department of women's affairs, said at a news
conference at TSU headquarters that there have been over 30,000 cases
of domestic violence each year in recent years.
</P>
<P>
Of these, the number of those concerning child abuse accounted
for 6.3 percent, Chiang said. Moreover, she also cited other
statistics released by private organizations concerning women's and
children's welfare, saying that each year more than 18,000 children
in Taiwan are victims of domestic violence.
</P>
<P>
The figures showed domestic violence has expanded into a serious
social problem, to which the entire Taiwan community should pay close
attention and seek resolutions, the TSU official said.
</P>
<P>
Chiang said that there is insufficient recourse for victims; for
example, there is currently no special unit in most law enforcement
agencies specifically tasked with dealing with the issue.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, Chiang said, the TSU will push to amend the existing
Anti-Domestic Violence Law in the Legislative Yuan. The law was
enacted on June 24, 1998.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, a four-year-old girl, who was refused admission to a
series of Taipei hospitals after being critically injured by her
abusive father two weeks ago, died at a Taichung County hospital in
central Taiwan. The tragedy raised a public outcry against domestic
violence.

COMPULSORY LANGUAGE TRAINING CALLED FOR FOREIGN SPOUSES
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Jan.  24 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Chinese language teachers in northern
Taoyuan County have come to an agreement that the central government
should impose compulsory language training on foreign spouses to help
them better blend in with local society.
</P>
<P>
The teachers made the call last weekend at a meeting with
education officials of Taoyuan County, suggesting that the central
government take the step to help foreign husbands and wives
strengthen their Chinese language abilities as a requirement for them
to get Taiwan ID cards and get accustomed to their domestic
lifestyles more quickly.
</P>
<P>
They claimed that doing so will help reduce waste of educational
resources and would be good for foreign spouses to better deal with
their children.
</P>
<P>
Statistics compiled this month by the Ministry of Education show
that around 46,000 children born to mixed couples are receiving
elementary and secondary education in Taiwan -- more than 40,000 in
elementary schools and about 5,500 in junior high schools.
</P>
<P>
In Taoyuan County, there have been more than 35,000 foreign
spouses, with over 2,000 children born to marriages of Taiwan
nationals and foreigners per year.
</P>
<P>
Starting this year, the county authorities will offer more
intensive language-learning classes and courses in history,
geography, religion and folk customs for foreign husbands and wives.
</P>
<P>
The industrial-intensive Taoyuan is Taiwan's second-largest
county in terms of population, only after neighboring Taipei County.

ROC MINISTERS EXPRESS CONCERN ABOUT SOCIAL ORDER IN SOUTH AFRICA

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Republic of China Foreign Affairs
Minister Tan Sun Chen and Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission
Minister Chang Fu-mei have expressed concern over the worsening
social order in South Africa.
</P>
<P>
The two ministers expressed their concern in messages sent to a
two-day seminar sponsored by ROC missions in South Africa over the
weekend on the safety of Taiwan expatriates in South Africa.
</P>
<P>
They urged Taiwan expatriates to work closely with the South
African government and police to work out measures to better protect
their own safety.
</P>
<P>
According to Chang, due to the widening gap between the rich and
the poor, rising unemployment, the abolition of the death penalty and
various other factors, the crime rate in South Africa in recent years
has risen rapidly.
</P>
<P>
Chang said she feels sorry that Taiwan expatriates, while working
hard overseas, have to worry about safety of their lives and
property, adding that her commission convened a meeting last December
to exchange views on the matter.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Affairs Minister Chen urged Taiwan expatriates to
establish a regional safeguard network and an emergency notification
system so as to provide support in the shortest possible time in case
of incidents.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 150 Taiwan expatriates took part in the seminar, five of
whom spoke about their own experiences as victims of crime.
South African parliamentarians, police chiefs and criminology
professors and counselling experts were also invited to give
their views on the prevention of crime, as well as on how to deal
with being victimized.
</P>
<P>
ROC Representative to South Africa Richard Shih said that his
office will compile the views of the participants and pass the
information to Taiwan expatriates for reference.

VICE PRESIDENT CRITICIZES LEGISLATURE FOR DISDAINING CONSTITUTION
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Jan.  24 (CNA)
(By Y.F. Low)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Vice President Annette Lu criticized the
opposition-controlled legislature Monday for holding the Constitution
in contempt over its refusal to exercise its consent on Control Yuan
nominations during the just-concluded legislative session.
</P>
<P>
The nominations put forth by President Chen Shui-bian were
shelved by the legislature owing to objections from the opposition
Kuomintang and People First Party. The move will delay the scheduled
inauguration of the ombudsmen, originally set for Feb. 1.
</P>
<P>
Lu told reporters it is distressing that the legislature has
ignored its constitutional duty to consider the Control Yuan
nominations, thereby caused a serious hiatus in the constitutional
operation of the nation's top watchdog body.
</P>
<P>
Lu further blamed the legislature for delaying the passage of
major legislation until the final two days of a session, saying the
legislature should keep a monthly schedule on which bills it plans to
review.
</P>
<P>
Lu said she hopes the administrative and legislative branches
will observe their respective duties after the new Cabinet and
legislature are sworn in Feb. 1.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Lu expressed her regret and grief over the death of a
severely abused four-year-old girl two weeks after she went into a
coma after being refused admission to various Taipei hospitals and
sent nearly 200 km away to Taichung for treatment.
</P>
<P>
Lu said people should learn from the tragedy and try to put a
stop to domestic and marital violence.
</P>
<P>
She said the incident also exposed problems in the emergency
operations of the medical sector, which require a detailed review for
improvement.

PFP NOMINATES CHUNG JUNG-CHI TO RUN FOR DEPUTY SPEAKERSHIP
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Jan.  24 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A legislator at large-elect representing
the opposition People First Party (PFP) will run for the new
Legislative Yuan's deputy speaker post, the PFP legislative caucus
announced Monday.
</P>
<P>
PFP legislators-elect held an intraparty primary earlier in the
day to decide on who should represent the party to vie for the deputy
speaker post. Three hopefuls -- Chung Jung-chi, Shen Chih-hwei and
Lee Ching-hua -- joined the race and Chung emerged as the winner.
</P>
<P>
The PFP, originally a splinter group from the main opposition
Kuomintang (KMT) , will have 34 seats in the new legislature to be
inaugurated Feb. 1. The PFP will cooperate with the KMT, which
controls 79 seats in the new legislature, in running for the deputy
speakership.
</P>
<P>
Immediately after winning the PFP nomination, Chung paid a visit
to KMT headquarters to meet with incumbent Legislative Yuan President
Wang Jin-pyng, who is also a KMT vice chairman, and KMT
Secretary-General Lin Fong-cheng, to discuss winning strategies.
</P>
<P>
Wang has been campaigning to retain his speaker post in the past
few weeks, traveling around the island to court the support of
re-elected and newly-elected legislators.
</P>
<P>
Wang said he is hopeful that KMT Chairman Lien Chan and PFP
Chairman James Soong will meet as soon as possible to work out joint
campaign strategies to ensure a double victory in the speaker and
deputy speaker elections. Soong is expected to return from a visit to
the United States in the coming days.
</P>
<P>
Wang suggested that Chung visit legislators-elect of the KMT and
the Non-Partisan Solidarity Union as soon as possible to seek their
support.
</P>
<P>
Party sources said Wang is almost certain to win re-election as
the KMT and the PFP jointly control a majority in the new
legislature. As for Chung's deputy speakership bid, the sources said,
it will depend on whether the two parties can consolidate unity
within the alliance.
</P>
<P>
There have been reports that some KMT legislators-elect would
prefer to support the re-election of incumbent Legislative Yuan Vice
President P.K. Chiang, who is also a KMT vice chairman and who once
served as minister of economic affairs and chairman for the Council
for Economic Planning and Development.
</P>
<P>
The "pan-green camp" of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) and the Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU) , which controls a total
of 101 seats, has yet to unveil its ticket for the upcoming speaker
and deputy speaker elections.
</P>
<P>
While DPP Secretary-General Chang Chun-hsiung, who will be a
legislator-at large in the new legislature, ruled out running for
speakership earlier in the day, veteran DPP Legislator Trong Chai
later announced his intention to run for the top legislative post.
</P>
<P>
The DPP legislative caucus is scheduled to decide on its ticket
for the speaker and deputy speaker elections Wednesday. Some media
reports said Chai may team up with acting DPP Chairman Ker Chien-ming
for the upcoming speaker and deputy speaker elections.

2004 EXPORT ORDER VALUE AT ALL-TIME HIGH OF OVER US$200 BILLION
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Jan. 24 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Export orders placed for Taiwan companies
last year hit an all-time high of US$215.09 billion in value, the
first time the figure has broken the US$200 billion mark, the
Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The figure represents an annual increase of 26.5 percent -- a
record growth rate since 1988 -- according to tallies released by the
Statistics Department under the MOEA.
</P>
<P>
In December, export orders totaled US$19.8 billion in value, the
second highest single-month level in history and a 25.97 percent rise
compared to the previous year's level.
</P>
<P>
Telecommunications and electronics products were the top two
items in outbound shipments, worth US$40.295 billion and US$47.028
billion and setting growth rates of 15.12 percent and 38.76 percent,
respectively, year-on-year.
</P>
<P>
Export orders for basic metal products exceeded the US$20 billion
level in value for the first time, while figures for outbound
shipments of plastics, textiles, machinery and precision instruments
also surpassed US$10 billion.
</P>
<P>
Department Director-General Chang Yaw-tzong attributed the good
performance to a strong demand from the international market fueled
by a recovering world economy, pointing out that export orders from
Taiwan's major trade partners all registered more than double-digit
increases in value.
</P>
<P>
The United States remained one of Taiwan's major export outlets
last year, with total order value growing by US$13.08 billion over
the 2003 level. Bolstered by robust demand from mainland China,
meanwhile, the value of orders from Hong Kong jumped by US$10.8
billion.
</P>
<P>
Looking at the prospects for this year, Chang predicted that
growth will slow. While a double-digit expansion for the whole of the
year may be difficult, double-digit growth for single month periods
is still possible, he said.
</P>
<P>
The courses of the international economy and the U.S. dollar, the
world oil and raw material prices and the mainland's drive to cool
off its high flying economy will be the major factors in the
performance of the domestic economy, he added.

JAPAN REAFFIRMS NO CHANGE IN 'VISA-FREE' DECISION FOR TAIWAN
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Japan's decision to grant visa-free
privileges for Taiwan tourists between March 25 and Sept. 25 will not
be subject to any change despite protests from the mainland Chinese
authorities, a Japanese diplomatic official said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Akira Chiba, assistant press secretary at Japan's Foreign
Ministry, made the remarks after the Japanese Yomiuri Shimbun daily
reported that Beijing has protested Japan's visa-free decision for
Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Chiba told journalists that it is already established that Japan
will offer visa-free privileges to Taiwan tourists during the
March-September period to coincide with an eco-friendly world
exposition to be held in the central Japanese prefecture of Aichi.
</P>
<P>
"This will not be subject to any change simply because of
Beijing's protests," Chiba said.
</P>
<P>
With a view to attracting more foreign visitors to the Aichi
World Expo, the Japanese government has decided to offer visa-free
privileges to Taiwan and South Korean tourists during the six-month
period. Japan has also decided to issue visas for prospective
visitors from all mainland areas during the period. At present, Japan
only accepts visa applications from residents in three major mainland
cities and five coastal mainland provinces.
</P>
<P>
The Yomiuri Shimbun reported that a senior mainland tourist
official protested the new Japanese policy last week when Japan's
Land, Infrastructure and Transportation Minister Kazuo Kitagawa
visited Beijing.
</P>
<P>
The mainland official was quoted as having told Kitagawa that it
was unacceptable for Japan to require visas for mainland nationals
while exempting Taiwanese tourists from visa requirements.
</P>
<P>
As Japan does not maintain formal diplomatic ties with Taiwan,
it will have to revise its existing law to offer visa-free privileges
for Taiwan tourists.
</P>
<P>
Lawmakers from Japan's ruling coalition of the Liberal Democratic
Party and the New Komeito Party are expected to come up with a bill
in mid-February to allow visas for Taiwan tourists to be waived
during the Aichi Expo.
</P>
<P>
Sources close to Japan's Foreign Ministry said ruling coalition
lawmakers will submit the bill as scheduled despite Beijing's
protest.
</P>
<P>
According to the Yomiuri report, the Japanese government has
decided to offer visa-free privileges for Taiwan tourists mainly
because Taiwan is Japan's second-largest source of foreign tourists
after South Korea and because few Taiwan tourists overstay their
visas.
</P>
<P>
Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi informed Lee Yuan-tseh,
Taiwan's representative to the 2004 informal leadership meeting of
the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum, of the visa-free
decision last November.

2004 INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTION INDEX SHOWS GROWTH OF OVER 9 PERCENT: MOEA
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Jan.  24 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taiwan's industrial production index for
the whole of 2004 was up by 9.8 percent year-on-year, at 126.91, a
spokesman for the Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) reported
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Chang Yaw-tzong, director-general of the MOEA's Statistics
Department, said that the country's manufacturing production index
also rose last year by 10.48 percent over the 2003 record -- the
largest growth since 1988.
</P>
<P>
Chang ascribed the increase to fierce demand from both the
international and domestic markets, and predicted that the two growth
rates for 2005 will both fall due to a less brisk export sector as a
result of a global economy that is set to lose some of its steam due
to weaker demand expected by most of the world's forecasting
agencies.
</P>
<P>
Prices of raw materials and crude oil, interest rate hikes and
the fallout of mainland China's efforts to deal with its overheated
economy will be the leading elements affecting the Taiwan economy
this year, he added.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan's industrial output index in December last year stood at
130.37, a slide of 0.95 percent compared to the previous year's
level, while its manufacturing production index for that month also
dropped by 1.99 percent on an annual basis -- the first monthly
negative growth since June 2003.
</P>
<P>
The housing sector showed a jump of 31.88 percent in output in
2004 over the previous year's level, while the mining sector and the
gas industry marked annual increases of 2.99 percent and 0.65 percent
in production, respectively.

TAIWAN LAWMAKERS URGE BEIJING TO SIGN CROSS-STRAIT INVESTMENT PACT
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Beijing,  Jan. 24 (CNA)
(By Stanley Chang and Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A visiting Taiwan delegation, composed of
opposition lawmakers and private business executives, urged mainland
Chinese authorities Monday to sign a cross-strait investment
protection agreement to better protect investors from Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
The delegation made the appeal while meeting with Tang Jiaxuan, a
mainland state councilor.
</P>
<P>
Opposition Kuomintang Legislator Chu Feng-chih, a member of the
delegation, said after the meeting that the delegation has also asked
mainland authorities to open mainland China's doors to Taiwan's
agricultural products, support Taiwan's bid to join the World Health
Organization (WHO) and allow for regular direct passenger and cargo
charter flights across the Taiwan Strait.
</P>
<P>
According to Chu, Tang said Beijing is unlikely to support
Taiwan's WHO bid because if it does, Taiwan would ask for entry to
other major international organizations.
</P>
<P>
Chu said the delegation made similar appeals during a meeting
with Chen Yulin, director of the Taiwan Affairs Office of the
State Council, a day earlier.
</P>
<P>
The delegation, organized by a Taipei-based private trade
association dedicated to promoting cross-strait economic exchanges,
arrived in Beijing Saturday. More than 20 opposition lawmakers
are among the delegation members. The delegation will travel to
Shanghai after the Beijing visit.

BEIJING'S PROPOSED ANTI-SECESSION LAW HARMFUL TO CROSS-STRAIT TIES
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Jan.  24 (CNA)

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The enacting of an anti-secession law by
Beijing will diminish cross-Taiwan Strait exchanges and thus will be
harmful to the development of bilateral ties, a scholar said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Shu Yung-ming, an assistant researcher with Academia Sinica,
Taiwan's highest research institute, said in a seminar that the
people of Taiwan will be afraid of visiting the mainland after the
legislation is approved due to its ambiguous definition of
secessionist activities.
</P>
<P>
The people of Taiwan could be arrested when visiting the mainland
because of remarks they might make in Taiwan and other areas that are
considered by the Beijing authorities as violations of the proposed
law, he explained.
</P>
<P>
Besides, he went on, none of the candidates running for public
office in Taiwan can avoid expressing their opposition to the
proposed law during their campaigns under the country's current
political circumstances.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, he continued, the enacting of the anti-secession law
will squeeze the political space of those who actually support
Taiwan's reunification with the mainland.

THINK TANK FORECASTS 4.67% GDP GROWTH FOR 2005

<P>
Taiwan will register gross domestic product
(GDP) growth of 4.67 percent in real terms for this year, a private
think tank predicted Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Wu Rong-i, president of the Taiwan Institute of Economic
Research, said the nation's 2005 GDP growth rate is expected to be
lower than last year's 6.17 percent growth because of an anticipated
slowdown in global economic growth and mainland China's measures to
coll its overheated economy.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Wu said that if the United States fails to properly
address its swelling trade and budget deficits, the greenback will
continue to weaken.
</P>

Against this backdrop, Wu said, the New Taiwan dollar will hover

NEWLY APPOINTED PREMIER PLEDGES TO FORM STABLE CABINET
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Jan.  25 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Premier-designate Frank Hsieh pledged
Tuesday to form a stable Cabinet that will pursue political and
cross-strait stability.
</P>
<P>
Hsieh made the remarks after President Chen Shui-bian announced
his appointment at the Presidential Office as the new premier.
</P>
<P>
The Kaohsiung mayor will succeed Yu Shyi-kun who resigned along
with the rest of the Cabinet Monday. It was later announced that Yu
will serve as the Presidential Office secretary-general, or the
president's chief of staff.
</P>
<P>
The president, who said Hsieh's appointment was based on his
outstanding performance as mayor of the southern port city as well as
considerations of creating a regional balance in the makeup of the
administration, stressed that the new Cabinet will be one that
promotes consultations, dialogue and stability.
</P>
<P>
Hsieh said that he was thrilled to hear the president's call for
consultations and stability, pointing out that he is strongly
committed to moving in that direction.
</P>
<P>
The premier-designate said that his basic ideals are co-existence
and reconciliation, as well as pursuing political, cross-strait and
social stability for the people.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that he has been promoting a new culture movement
over the past 20 years by writing books and sponsoring activities to
promote the ideas of co-existence and cooperation in the belief that
this will create a "win-win situation" for the ruling and opposition
parties.
</P>
<P>
Hsieh also said political stability must come from the top down,
adding that he would like to take the lead in this respect by
spending more time on resolving the partisan conflicts and rivalry
within Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Hsieh, 59, holds a master's degree in law from Kyoto University
in Japan. He served as a defense lawyer for those involved in the
"Kaohsiung Incident" -- a human rights rally in December 1979 that 
turned violent. The incident is considered a milestone in Taiwan's
democratic movement.
</P>
<P>
Hsieh also served two terms as a Taipei city councilor and three
terms as a member of Legislative Yuan. He was the Democratic
Progressive Party's (DPP's) vice presidential candidate in Taiwan's
first direct presidential election in 1996 and later served as the
DPP chairman. His popularity has increased steadily during his six
years as Kaohsiung mayor, even surpassing that of Taipei Mayor Ma
Ying-jeou according to some public opinion polls.

<TEXT>
<P>
President Chen Shui-bian reaffirmed Tuesday
his resolve to seek reconciliation and cooperation with the
opposition, stressing that the next Cabinet will be one built on
consultations, dialogue and stability.
</P>
<P>
The president made the remarks at a news conference where he
announced his decision to appoint Kaohsiung Mayor Frank Hsieh to
replace Yu Shyi-kun as the next premier. The new Cabinet is set to be
formed on Feb. 1 simultaneous with the inauguration of a new
legislature.
</P>
<P>
Renewing his overture made in his Jan. 1 New Year's address, Chen
said nothing should prevent reconciliation and cooperation between
the ruling and opposition parties as long as it benefits political
stability, people's well-being, ethnic amity and cross-Taiwan Strait
peace.
</P>
<P>
For this very purpose, Chen noted, the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) and himself have displayed the highest level
of goodwill and sincerity over the past month by making contact with
all opposition parties.
</P>
<P>
Chen said he fully understands that ruling and opposition parties
must put aside their selfishness, partisan interests and ideological
confrontation in order to reconcile and cooperate with each other.
</P>

Chen asserted that he will never be discouraged by the fact that
a mature environment for inter-party cooperation is still lacking in
Taiwan but will continue to stick to this pursuit.
</P>
<P>
Chen expressed the hope that the next Cabinet and legislature
will facilitate the development of win-win relations between the
ruling and opposition camps.
</P>
<P>
According to Chen, Hsieh's successful experience in interacting
with the opposition-dominated Kaohsiung City Council makes him the
best candidate for premier. He will help pry open the doors to
consultations and dialogue with the opposition and stabilize the
political scene, Chen said.
</P>
<P>
The appointment of Hsieh -- the first politician to jump directly
from mayor to premier -- also symbolizes the upgrading of the status
of counties and cities, Chen said.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the appointment will mean the instillation of a
southern Taiwan perspective into the central government, which is
expected to help balance regional development and shrink the gap in
rural-urban development, he added.

MISSION-ORIENTED NATIONAL ASSEMBLY MAY BE ELECTED MAY 14
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Jan.  25 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The nation's first-ever mission-oriented
National Assembly may be elected May 14 to endorse a package of
constitutional amendments passed by the outgoing Legislative Yuan
last August, the Central Election Commission (CEC) said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
CEC Deputy Secretary-General Teng Tien-you made the remarks after
a CEC-organized meeting of representatives from city and county
election commissions to discuss the timing for the National Assembly
election.
</P>
<P>
Teng said the CEC proposed three dates -- April 30, May 7 and May
14 -- for the National Assembly election.
</P>
<P>
"Most people at the conference felt that April 30 would be too
soon while May 7 happens to be the date for national civil service
examinations. As a result, the participants generally agreed that
May 14 would be the most suitable for the National Assembly
election," Teng said, adding that a final decision on the timing will
be made Feb. 2 when all CEC commissioners will meet to discuss the
issue.
</P>
<P>
The fifth Legislative Yuan, which will finish its term Jan. 31,
passed a landmark constitutional amendment package Aug. 23, 2004 to
pave the way for sweeping legislative reforms, including reducing the
number of legislative seats from the present 225 to 113 and adopting
a "single seat, two votes" legislative electoral system starting with
the seventh Legislative Yuan to be elected in 2007, as well as
phasing out the mission-oriented National Assembly to allow for
popular referendum on future constitutional amendments.
</P>
<P>
Under the current constitutional provisions, the legislature must
publicly display its Constitutional amendment bill for six months
before a mission-oriented or "functional" National Assembly meets to
endorse the bill. The public display period will expire Feb. 26.
</P>
<P>
The present Constitution also stipulates that 300 National
Assembly members should be elected by proportional representation
within three months of the expiration of the six-month public display
period. Therefore, the CEC must hold a National Assembly election
before May 26.
</P>
<P>
The mission-oriented National Assembly is required to convene
within 10 days after the election and complete screening and
endorsement of the legislature-proposed amendments to the
Constitution within a month.
</P>
<P>
Against this backdrop, the first-ever mission-oriented National
Assembly, which will also be the last of its kind, must complete
endorsement of the legislature-proposed amendments by early July.

HSIEH'S APPOINTMENT AS PREMIER MET WITH PARTISAN REACTIONS
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Jan. 25 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The announcement of Kaohsiung Mayor Frank
Hsieh's appointment as the next premier was met with reaction along
party lines Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) welcomed the move,
saying that it has "every confidence in him, " and lauded his ideal
of "co-existence and cooperation" and his belief in creating a
"win-win situation" for the ruling and opposition parties.
</P>
<P>
The DPP also said that whatever the result of the elections for
speaker and vice speaker in the opposition-dominated Legislative Yuan
on Feb. 1, it is inevitable that the ruling and opposition parties
must move toward "consultation and communication."
</P>
<P>
Ker Chien-ming, DPP caucus whip in the legislature, said that
Hsieh has been a key figure in Taiwan's democratic movement over the
past three decades, and his political acumen has led the party
forward in every way.
</P>
<P>
During his six years as Kaohsiung mayor, Hsieh has significantly
upgraded the city's image and achieved a south-north regional balance
that had never existed before, Ker added.
</P>
<P>
Another DPP legislator, Tsai Huang-liang, also said that Hsieh is
wise and well-rounded, adding that he has created a "Kaohsiung
miracle" with his popularity even surpassing that of Taipei Mayor Ma
Ying-jeou.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the opposition "pan-blue alliance" of the Kuomintang
(KMT) and the People First Party (PFP) still dominates the 225-seat
legislature, Tsai said that Hsieh will face daunting challenges
ahead, but he hoped that Hsieh will avoid highly controversial
issues, and enter into dialogue with the opposition to end the
confrontation between the ruling and opposition parties.
</P>
<P>
The Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU), an ally of the DPP, was also
positive about Hsieh's appointment and expressed the hope that he
will push for inter-party reconciliation in response to the public
aspiration for political stability.
</P>
<P>
Chen Chien-ming, TSU caucus whip in the legislature, also urged
Hsieh's new Cabinet to pay attention to laborers, farmers and
fishermen, women, the elderly and other underprivileged groups to
better social welfare.
</P>
<P>
On the political front, Chen also hoped that Hsieh could respond
to the TSU's campaign to "call Taiwan, Taiwan" and to write a new
Constitution so that the sovereignty of the nation can be firmly
established.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, the largest opposition party, the KMT,
"regretted" President Chen Shui-bian's appointment of Hsieh, saying
that the president will have to bear the full responsibility for
naming a minority government.
</P>
<P>
Tseng Yung-chuan, legislator and executive director of the KMT's
Policy Committee, said that according to the spirit of the
Constitution, the majority in the legislature should form the
Cabinet, and the president has violated that spirit by forming a
minority Cabinet.
</P>
<P>
"If the new Cabinet does not function well and a stable political
situation cannot be achieved, the DPP and President Chen must bear
the full responsibility," he said.
</P>
<P>
Liu Wen-hsiung, PFP caucus whip in the legislature, said that
whether trust between the ruling and opposition parties can be
rebuilt will hinge on President Chen, and not on whether the new
premier is well-rounded or not.
</P>
<P>
Liu said that if the DPP does not abandon its advocacy of Taiwan
independence then the spectre of political confrontation will never
go away.
</P>
<P>
He also questioned the minor reshuffle of the Cabinet, saying
that it has "failed to give it a new look."

DOH TO IMPLEMENT AUSTERITY PROGRAM TO SAVE HEALTH INSURANCE PROGRAM
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Jan. 25 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Department of Health (DOH) will adopt
austerity measures to save the shaky national health insurance
program from bankruptcy without raising premiums for a year or so, a
senior official said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
DOH Minister Chen Chien-jen said that since participants to last
week's civic meeting on the health insurance program unanimously
disagreed with a proposed hike in health insurance premiums, the DOH
will respect this conclusion and refrain from raising premiums this
year.
</P>
<P>
Acknowledging that there is room for the annual health care
expenditures to be cut by 5 percent to 10 percent, Chen said if waste
can be curbed and cost-saving measures can be implemented, the health
insurance program should be able to continue operations without the
need to raise premiums for another year or so.
</P>
<P>
Chen urged local people not to use outpatient resources for minor
ailments. Each Taiwan citizen makes an average of 14.5 hospital
outpatient visits per year, far higher than the average of seven or
eight visits in the United States and major European countries.
</P>
<P>
"If we can minimize unnecessary hospital outpatient visits and
medical examinations, we'll be able to save medical resources for
those who are suffering from acute, serious or rare diseases, " Chen
said.
</P>
<P>
Other feasible cost-cutting measures will include ceasing
payments for epidemic prevention and public health promotion programs
as well as subsidies for teaching hospitals, Chen said, adding that
those spendings can hereafter be paid from government budgets instead
of funds from the health insurance program.
</P>
<P>
According to Chen, the health insurance program's reserve funds
will be used up by the end of March. After March, Chen said the
Cabinet has set aside NT$11 billion in its 2005 budget plan to help
support the health insurance program.
</P>
<P>
Chen said the DOH has begun designing a second-generation health
insurance program under which the premiums will be collected in terms
of total household incomes.
</P>
<P>
The 20 participants in the Jan. 20-22 conference, organized by
National Taiwan University's Sociology Department at the request of
the DOH's National Health Insurance Bureau, unanimously agreed that
action should be taken to save the program from bankruptcy, but not
through an increase in insurance premiums. The participants reached
consensus that the health categories covered by the program should
not be reduced to deal with the program's financial difficulties.
</P>
<P>
They suggested a change in how premiums are calculated, from a
percentage of an insured's salary to a percentage of their total
personal income, saying this would be a fairer system.
</P>
<P>
In order to raise funds to finance the program, they also
recommended levying a health tax on cigarettes and aggressively
pursuing claims for damage on behalf of motor vehicle accident
victims and against employers negligence in occupational safety.
</P>
<P>
Abuse and waste in the health insurance program should be curbed
to decrease the program's costs, according to the conclusions reached
by the conference participants.

ANALYSTS HAVE HIGH EXPECTATIONS FOR  FRANK HSIEH AS PREMIER
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei, Jan. 25 (CNA)
(By Y.F. Low)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Local analysts on Tuesday expected that the
next Cabinet led by Frank Hsieh will help improve cross-Taiwan Strait
relations, temper confrontation between the ruling and opposition
camps and balance regional development.
</P>
<P>
Lin De-chang, director of the Institute of Mainland China Studies
at National Sun Yat-sen University (NSYSU), said Hsieh has displayed
pragmatism in dealing with the mainland during his term as Kaohsiung
mayor and that this attitude is expected to help better cross-strait
relations.
</P>
<P>
For example, Lin said, Hsieh succeeded in breaking through the
mainland's suppression, winning Kaohsiung the right to host the World
Games 2009.
</P>
<P>
Also, Hsieh managed to avoid cross-strait political influence
while actively promoting the establishment of a free trade zone at
Kaohsiung Harbor and the development of the city's tourism and
service industries, Lin said.
</P>
<P>
Lin said an "anti-secession law" that Beijing is expected to
enact in March or April will bring cross-strait relations to a state
of uncertainty and that the situation will be an immediate test for
the new Cabinet.
</P>
<P>
Instead of trying to retaliate by pushing for the passage of a
law against being "swallowed up" by the mainland, Hsieh should lower
his profile and extend some gesture of goodwill to Beijing, Lin
suggested.
</P>
<P>
Lee Chin-tarn, director of NSYSU's Department of Business
Administration, said Hsieh must pay close attention to the challenges
posed by the vast mainland market and its economic power to Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
In terms of financial and economic policies, Lee proposed that
Hsieh work to enhance Taiwan's global competitiveness and strengthen
its appeal to international investors, which according to Lee will
require the recruitment of more economic talent into the Cabinet.
</P>
<P>
Liao Da-chi, director of NSYSU's Graduate Institute of Political
Science, said Hsieh's flexible and well-rounded style, which she said
has helped him overcome a number of difficulties in interacting with
the opposition-dominated Kaohsiung City Council, will be very useful
in improving cross-strait relations and relations between the ruling
and opposition parties.
</P>
<P>
Also, Liao said she believes Hsieh's appointment as the next
premier will benefit the development of Kaohsiung in light of his
connection with the port city.
</P>
<P>
Disagreeing with Liao, Bob Kuo, director of NSYSU's Department of
Information Management, said he does not think Hsieh will enjoy much
personal maneuverability in the premier position.
</P>
<P>
Kuo predicted that Hsieh's "Kaohsiung experience" will be
overwhelmed by the strong Taipei-oriented perspective in the central
government in six month after he assumes the premiership.

<P>
The Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) is
planning to offer easier entry facilities to foreigners and mainland
Chinese coming to Taiwan to take part in international meetings and
exhibitions, MOEA officials said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
A task force to promote tourism under the Executive Yuan reached
the conclusion in a meeting in which it agreed that the government
will subsidize the private sector in sponsoring large
international meetings or exhibitions.

</P>
<P>
The ultimate goal is for all agencies under the Executive Yuan to
hold at least one international convention with attendance of more
than 200 people by 2008, task force officials said.
</P>
<P>
However, the Taiwan Convention and Exhibition Association said
that simplifying entry procedures is more important than just
providing government subsidies, pointing out that a lot of buyers
from South Asia and Africa need guarantors in order to secure a
Taiwan visa or have to go to third countries to apply for visas.
</P>
<P>
MOEA officials said that if foreigners account for a certain
level of participation in a convention or exhibition held in Taiwan,
they can apply to a MOEA task force to be established after Chinese
New Year, which falls on Feb. 9, for selective landing visas.
</P>
<P>
In addition, mainland Chinese applying to come to Taiwan to
attend international conventions or exhibitions will also have their
screening time shortened from the present 21 days.

The December index represents the fifth consecutive fall and the
lowest level since June 2003 in the TIER monthly survey.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, of the companies polled month-to-month, 19.4 percent
were optimistic about business conditions at home over the next six
months, a slide from 20.2 percent. Some 65.3 percent, a rise from
61.7 percent, were of the view that their business would maintain
stable, while 18.1 percent, an increase over 15.3 percent, were
pessimistic about their business prospects, the survey found.
</P>
<P>
According to the survey results, the respondents thought that
business in the textile, garment, retail and cement industries will
be regular in the first half of this year, with the car accessory
trade the only exception.
</P>
<P>
The business climate index is a widely observed indicator to
assess current economic conditions and future expectations of the
business community.
</P>
<P>
TIER President Wu Rong-i also pointed out that private investment
will cool this year despite various major government public
construction plans due to a slowing domestic economy. The private
sector investment growth rate is estimated to dwindle to just 9.67
percent for 2005, a noticeable decline from the 25.08 percent of
2004, he said.
</P>
<P>
Affected by a less vigorous world economy, the relatively high
prices of raw materials and crude oil, a rising interest rate and
mainland China's drive to stem its overheated economy, the Taiwan
economy is forecast to grow by 4.67 percent this year, which is
lackluster compared to the 6.17 percent for 2004, Wu said.
</P>
<P>
However, Wu claimed that Taiwan should feel comfortable with an
annual economic growth rate of above 4 percent for a nearly mature
economy. It would have been unusual to see a rate of more than 7
percent in the old days, he added.
</P>
<P>
Private consumption, as well as export and import trade, will
also post a decrease this year, with expected growth rates of 2.58
percent, 12.1 percent and 14.08 percent, respectively, below last
year's 3.06 percent, 20.71 percent and 31.94 percent, he pointed out.
The country's whole-year trade surplus is assessed to shrink to
NT$3.6 billion from US$6.2 billion, according to Wu.

TAIWAN URGES JAPAN  TO PLAY LEADING ROLE TO ENSURE REGIONAL PEACE
</HEADLINE>

Tokyo,  Jan.  25 (CNA)

<TEXT>
<P>
Japan should play a more leading role in
Asian affairs to help prevent mainland China from treading a policy
line of adventurism, a Taiwan official said in Tokyo Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Lo Fu-chuan, president of the quasi-official Association of East
Asian Relations (AEAR) , who also once served as Taiwan's
representative to Japan, made the call at a pre-departure news
conference at the end of a weeklong visit to Japan.
</P>
<P>
Lo led a group of Taiwan scholars to meet with Japanese
politicians and academics in the past week to brief them on the
possible adverse impact on regional stability and peace of mainland
China's proposed "anti-secession law."
</P>
<P>
Lo told Japanese politicians that Beijing has refused to talk
with Taiwan while unilaterally planning to enact the "anti-secession
law" targeting Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Stressing that the move reflects Beijing's ignorance of human
rights and attempts to unilaterally alter the status quo in the
Taiwan Strait, Lo said that if the proposed "anti-secession law"
becomes a reality, it will strain cross-strait relations and could
eventually affect all of Asia.
</P>
<P>
Since mainland China is not a democratic country, Lo said it can
interpret its law from the aspect of self-interest. Should the
"anti-secession law" be enacted, Lo said its target could include not
only Taiwan but also the disputed Tiaoyutai Islands, which are known
as the Senkakus in Japan. The island group is now under Japan's
control, but both sides of the Taiwan Strait claim sovereignty over
the island group.
</P>
<P>
After briefing Japanese lawmakers from across the political
spectrum on Beijing's legislative plan Monday, Lo said Japanese
lawmakers have come to a better understanding of the legislation's
potential pitfalls.
</P>
<P>
"They are all concerned about Beijing's proposed law, " Lo said,
adding that most Japanese politicians are now adopting a wait-and-see
attitude and are not prepared to make any public comments until after
Beijing reveals the full text of the law.

RISE OF TAIWANESE IDENTITY DIFFERS FROM PRO-INDEPENDENCE: PRESIDENT
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Jan. 25 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President Chen Shui-bian said Tuesday that
the increasing sense of Taiwanese identity in the country should not
be equated to a rise in pro-independence sentiment.
</P>
<P>
Chen made the remarks while meeting with a visiting delegation
from the National Committee on U.S.-China Relations, a private U.S.
think tank. The delegation is headed by former U.S. Defense Secretary
William J. Perry.
</P>
<P>
With the progress in Taiwan's democratic development, Chen said,
there is developing among the people of Taiwan a growing sense of
Taiwanese identity distinct from that of mainland China.
</P>
<P>
This tendency should not be interpreted as a growing
pro-independence sentiment, Chen said, adding that the international
community should not "hand over free Taiwan to not-free China simply
because of worries about the rise of Taiwanese identity."
</P>
<P>
He stressed that his administration's constitutional
re-engineering program has nothing to do with the "unification vs.
independence" debate regarding Taiwan's future.
</P>
<P>
"We'll faithfully follow our constitutional procedures in
constitutional amendments and won't go beyond constitutional
provisions, " Chen said, adding that holding a referendum to endorse
future constitutional amendment proposals is a consensus reached by
opposition and ruling parties last year.
</P>
<P>
He also told his guests that he has appointed Frank Hsieh, mayor
of Taiwan's second-largest city of Kaohsiung, to serve as the new
premier from Feb. 1.
</P>
<P>
Noting that Hsieh, a skillful negotiator, is known for his
political philosophy of "co-existence and cooperation, " Chen said he
believes that this thinking can be applied to address not only
Taiwan's inter-party relations but also Taiwan-U.S. relations and
Taiwan-mainland ties.
</P>
<P>
Citing his New Year's Day message, Chen said he is determined to
"open a new era of negotiation and dialogue" with both Taiwan's
opposition camp and the mainland.
</P>
<P>
Acknowledging that being free of preconceived ideals, partisan
calculation and ideological divides is the cardinal principle for
promoting inter-party reconciliation and cooperation, Chen said his
administration will stick to this principle to boost national unity.
</P>
<P>
"We'll search all possibilities for reconciliation with the
opposition alliance. We must give up partisan interests and
ideological divides, " Chen said, adding that "only with a united
Taiwan... shall we achieve cross-Taiwan Strait peace."
</P>
<P>
He further said the recent landmark cross-strait deal on the
launch of direct, non-stop charter flights during the upcoming
Chinese New Year holiday to accommodate homebound Taiwan businessmen
from the mainland is a good example of these principles.
</P>
<P>
"The charter flight deal can serve as a good start for a thaw in
the long-deadlocked cross-strait ties, " Chen said, adding that his
administration will continue pushing for normalization of
cross-strait relations.
</P>
<P>
Touching on worries expressed by some American scholars that the
long absence of cross-strait dialogue could escalate tension, Chen
said Taiwan is pragmatic and flexible in dealing with cross-strait
affairs.
</P>
<P>
"Although the United States is Taiwan's best ally, Taiwan will
never be so naive as to rely on the U.S. for its security. We fully
understand our conditions and constraints. We are fully aware that
our survival hinges on self-reliance and a pragmatic approach in
pursuing national development," Chen added.

<TEXT>
<P>
Deputy Taipei County Magistrate Tseng
Sen-bao is scheduled to become the new director-general of the Export
Processing Zone Administration (EPZA) under the Ministry of Economic
Affairs (MOEA), ministry officials said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Tseng will take over from the retiring Chou Yen Jan. 28 in a
ceremony held at the Nantzu Export Processing Zone in the southern
port city of Kaohsiung.
</P>
<P>
Tseng, 51, holds a doctorate in land economics from National
Chengchi University. He worked as a member of the Cabinet-level
Council of Economic Planning and Development and was a secretary of
the East Coast National Scenic Area Administration under the Ministry
of Transportation and Communications. He has also served as a deputy
division director of the MOEA Industrial Development Bureau and as
secretary-general of the Taipei county government.
</P>
<P>
The EPZA, which administers five export processing zones and a
warehousing and transportation service center, was formed in the
1960s, a time when the central government's finances were short and
unemployment high. To lure foreign investment, the central government
enacted several favorable statutes for foreign investors to set up
factories to provide jobs for Taiwan people.
</P>
<P>
Today, the EPZA has successfully solicited enormous capital and
state-of-the-art manufacturing techniques so that the country's
processing industries have become world famous.

Commission (FSC) reported Tuesday that as of the end of December last
year, 53 banking institutions in Taiwan had issued a combined total
of 44.18 million credit cards.

<P>
According to the FSC official, 24.59 million cards of the total

<TEXT>
<P>
The ruling Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) established a task force Tuesday to nominate the party's
candidates in upcoming elections of a mission-oriented ad hoc
National Assembly, a DPP official said.
</P>
<P>
Liang Wen-jye, deputy executive director of the DPP Policy
Committee, said the task force is headed by Presidential Office
Secretary-General Su Tseng-chang, who is expected to be elected as
DPP chairman by the end of this month, and that its members include
Vice President Annette Lu, Premier Yu Shyi-kun, Kaohsiung Mayor Frank
Hsieh, Acting DPP Chairman Ker Chien-ming, National Security
Committee Secretary-General Chiou Yi-jen and Central Personnel
Administration Director-General Lee Yi-yang.
</P>
<P>
The task force will nominate more than 150 candidates who will
register with the Central Election Commission (CEC) after their
nominations are approved by the DPP Central Executive Committee,
Liang revealed.
</P>
<P>
Given that the DPP has not yet provided any rules and regulations
for the nomination of candidates for National Assembly elections, the
party's Central Executive Committee will hold a meeting Jan. 31 to
draw up a draft that will be discussed and approved by the party
congress slated for March 12, he added.
</P>
<P>
The task force will then nominate the candidates in accordance
with the rules and regulations to seek the approval of the party's
Central Executive Committee by March 26, Liang went on.
</P>
<P>
The CEC is planning to hold the National Assembly elections May 7
or May 14 to elect 300 members for the ad hoc assembly that will
endorse a package of constitutional amendments passed by the
Legislative Yuan last August.
</P>
<P>
The Fifth Legislative Yuan, which will finish its term Jan. 31,
passed the landmark constitutional amendment package Aug. 23 to pave
the way for sweeping legislative reforms, including reducing the
number of legislative seats from the present 225 to 113 and adopting
a "single seat, two votes" legislative electoral system starting with
the Seventh Legislative Yuan to be elected in 2007, as well as
phasing out the ad hoc National Assembly to allow for popular
referendum on future constitutional amendments.
</P>
<P>
The National Assembly members will be elected proportionally
based on the number of ballots garnered by the various political
parties or electoral alliances that take part in the elections.

INDIA OFFERS EASIER VISA ENTRY FOR TAIWAN BUSINESSMEN
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  Jan. 25 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
To help boost trade and economic exchanges
between Taiwan and India, the Taiwan External Trade Development
Council (TAITRA) and the India-Taipei Association have teamed up to
offer better visa treatment for Taiwan businessmen, a TAITRA
spokesman said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Starting immediately, the India-Taipei Association will issue
one-year multiple entry business visas to Taiwan businessmen who are
able to show a recommendation letter issued by TAITRA, the spokesman
said.
</P>
<P>
The move marks a prolongation of six months for Taiwan
businessmen wishing to visit India, India-Taipei Association Chairman
Vijay Gokhale said, adding that it takes only half a working day for
applicants to get the visa.
</P>
<P>
In the past, Taiwan businessmen, even when recommended by TAITRA,
could only receive a six-month multiple entry visa, he said.
</P>
<P>
Trade between the two countries has expanded rapidly in recent
years, with two-way trade expected to have reached US$17 billion for
2004. There is ample room for bilateral trade to further flourish in
view of India's large territory and population.
</P>
<P>
The semi-official TAITRA, formerly known as CETRA (China External
Trade Development Council) , was set up in 1970 to help Taiwan
companies explore foreign trade.

CHINA SOUTHERN AIRLINES TO BE 1ST MAINLAND CARRIER TO LAND IN TAIWAN

<TEXT>
<P>
China Southern Airlines will be the first
mainland Chinese carrier to ever make a landing at Chiang Kai-shek
(CKS) International Airport, Taiwan's main gateway, officials of the
Civil Aeronautic Administration (CAA) said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
According to applications received by the CAA, five charter
planes will simultaneously take off from airports on both sides of
the Taiwan Strait at 8 a.m. Jan. 29 to mark the launch of
cross-strait charter flights during the Chinese New Year holiday.
</P>
<P>
At that time, CAA officials said, a plane belonging to Taiwan's
China Airlines will take off from CKS bound for Beijing and four
planes belonging to three mainland carriers -- China Southern
Airlines, Air China and Hainan Airlines -- will take off
simultaneously from Guangzhou and Beijing, respectively, to Taipei or
Kaohsiung.
</P>
<P>
As the China Southern Airlines plane will fly from Guangzhou to
CKS, it will be first to arrive due to geographical proximity.
</P>
<P>
CAA officials said all six mainland carriers authorized to
operate cross-strait charter flights have filed applications with the
CCA and two of them, Shanghai Airlines and Xiamen Airlines, have
already received CAA approval.
</P>
<P>
Five of Taiwan's carriers have also presented their applications
to the CAA and TranAsia Airways is the only carrier that has not yet
furnished its flight schedule for approval. The CAA approved
China Airlines and EVA Airways applications a day earlier.
</P>
<P>
According to a landmark deal reached in Macau Jan. 15 by
negotiators from both sides of the Taiwan Strait, six carriers from
each side will operate a combined 48 direct, non-stop charter flights
during the Jan. 29-Feb. 20 period between Taipei/Kaohsiung in Taiwan
and Shanghai/Beijing/Guangzhou in mainland China for the convenience
of Taiwan businessmen operating on the mainland who wish to return

According to FSC statistics, the amount of overdue loans had

TAIWAN MANAGEMENT SETTLES AFTER M'LANDERS COMMANDEER FISHING VESSEL
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Kaohsiung,  Jan. 26 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Eighteen mainland Chinese deckhands who
commandeered a Kaohsiung-based tuna fishing boat in mid-January took
control of the vessel again Tuesday after negotiations over severance
pay with the Taiwan company that owns the boat were broken off.
</P>
<P>
A settlement was then reached Tuesday night when the management
of the Tongsong Fishing Co. -- which owns the "Tongyi 668" tuna
fishing vessel -- agreed to increase the severance pay from US$50 per
head to US$500.
</P>
<P>
The 18 mainlanders are scheduled to fly back to China Wednesday,
ending a half-month mutiny incident dating back to Jan. 12 when the
"Tongyi 668" was reported missing at sea.
</P>
<P>
The 493-ton tuna fishing vessel, with 28 crew members aboard,
lost communications Jan. 12 while fishing about 700 nautical miles
off the west coast of the Maldives.
</P>
<P>
The "Tongyi 668" was spotted sailing by the British Chagos
Islands Jan. 15 towards Indonesia and Singapore, according to a
spokesman for the fishing company.
</P>
<P>
A representative for the Tongsong Fishing Co. flew to Malaysia
Jan. 24 to look into the incident after the tuna fishing vessel was
intercepted by a Malaysian navy frigate Jan. 23 after being spotted
sailing erratically near Malaysian territorial waters.
</P>
<P>
The officers and crew of the "Tongyi 668" were then interrogated
by Malaysian authorities, who learned that the vessel had been
commandeered Jan. 11 by the Chinese deckhands because of
dissatisfaction with low wages and unfair treatment working aboard
the vessel, according to the representative.
</P>
<P>
The representative said that Chen Kuo-ching, captain of the
"Tongyi 668, " phoned the company and his family in Kaohsiung from
Malaysia to tell them that he was safe and had only sustained some
minor injuries during the struggle with the mutineers.
</P>
<P>
The representative said that his company is grateful to the
Malaysian navy for intercepting the vessel before things got out of
control.
</P>
<P>
He quoted Chen as saying that three other officers on board also
sustained minor injuries during the struggle but that they were fine.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the 18 mainlanders, six Filipino nationals were
working as deckhands aboard the vessel.

<P>
The sixth relief mission from the
Taiwan-based Buddhist Compassionate Relief Tzu Chi Foundation to Sri
Lanka following the Dec. 26 tsunami tragedy has left North America
for the South Asian country to continue aid efforts there.
</P>
<P>
A total of 40 Tzu Chi volunteers from Canada and the United
States are expected to reach Colombo, Sri Lanka Thursday, mainly to
provide medical care and interview locals to gain a deeper
understanding of their specific needs. The volunteers are expected to
stay there until Feb. 5.
</P>
<P>
Tzu Chi has been in Sri Lanka's southern city of Hambantota, one
of the hardest-hit areas, since Dec. 31, with Taiwanese medical
personnel taking turns serving there. The Tzu Chi medical workers
have treated an average of 700 people per day in the city over the
past 55 days, said Ko Chi-she, a Los Angeles-based doctor who is
heading Tzu Chi's sixth relief mission.
</P>
<P>
According to Ko, the mission's major tasks will be providing
medical care and distributing rice to the locals of Hambantota, where
the number of surviving tsunami victims is about 83,000.
</P>
<P>
About 2,500 tons of rice will be distributed over two months to
the locals, Ko said, adding that 2,000 cooking utensil sets will be
distributed to locals in Tangalla, another southern Sri Lankan city
that was hit hard by the tsunami.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Ko said, Tzu Chi has also begun to build 1,000
prefabricated houses in the most battered areas in Sri Lanka to help
accommodate people displaced by the tsunami disaster.

SOME 350,000 STUDENTS HAVE CLASSES IN 'DANGEROUS' CLASSROOMS: LAWMAKER

<TEXT>
<P>
Nearly 350,000 students at junior high
schools and elementary schools around Taiwan have classes in
dangerous classrooms, a legislator from the opposition Taiwan
Solidarity Union (TSU) said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
TSU Legislator Cheng Cheng-lung said that his finding is based on
the results of an investigation of the age and maintenance of
classrooms at junior high schools and elementary schools around the
island.
</P>
<P>
Cheng said that 20 out of the 25 cities and counties took part in
the study which found that a total of 6,322 classrooms pose safety
hazards but are still in use. He estimated that there are a total of
about 8,720 such classrooms in all 25 cities and counties.
</P>
<P>
Based on the figure of an average of 40 students per class, Cheng
calculated that about 348,970 students currently have classes in one
of these "dangerous" classrooms.
</P>
<P>
According to the study, Taichung County has the largest number of
dangerous classrooms, at 917, followed by Tainan County at 862, and
Pingtung County at 770. The three counties account for nearly half of
the total number of dangerous classrooms tallied in the survey.
</P>
<P>
The cities of Chiayi and Tainan, and the counties of Nantou,
Penghu and Kinmen did not take part in the study.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Ministry of Education pledged that it will pitch
in NT$20 billion (US$630.91 million) over the next five years to
renovate the dilapidated classrooms.
</P>
<P>
Education ministry officials said that the dilapidated classrooms
are not necessarily dangerous and that the classrooms will
regular undergo safety checks so as not to put any students in danger.

In an effort to protect the safety of

Administration (EPA) has enacted a new regulation requiring that all
toxic material containers carry labels in both English and Chinese.

EPA officials said the new regulation requires that the labels on

not understand Chinese, they added.
</P>
<P>
The EPA began monitoring implementation of the new regulation
islandwide Wednesday, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the EPA has made available on its official Web site

facilitate the toxicity control efforts by the private business and
industrial sectors. The Web site, at www.epa.gov.tw, also has

Chairman Joseph Wu departed Los Angeles Tuesday for Taiwan after
concluding a week-long visit in the United States.
</P>
<P>
Wu told reporters before his departure that the government has a
consistent policy towards mainland China and that the MAC will
continue to work to promote cooperation across the Taiwan Strait

For example, Wu said, the launch of the special cross-strait
Lunar New Year charter flights this year is the result of efforts by
Taiwan over a long period of time and represents a major
breakthrough.

However, Wu said Beijing's plan to enact an "anti-secession law"

PRESIDENT HAS NOT ASKED OFFICIALS TO RUN IN LOCAL ELECTIONS: TOP AIDE

<P>
President Chen Shui-bian has not asked
politically appointed officials to return to the local level to take
part in the year-end mayoral and magistrate elections, the
president's top aide clarified Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Su Tseng-chang, secretary-general of the Presidential Office,
made the remarks in response to media reports that there has been
discontent within the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) about
the reported policy of encouraging politically appointed officials to
return to the local level to run in the elections.
</P>
<P>
The reports said that Minister of Justice Chen Ding-nan, who
served two terms as Ilan magistrate between 1981 and 1989, will soon
return to his hometown to run for his old post again, resulting in
discontent among other DPP aspirants.
</P>
<P>
Su pointed out that there has been "misunderstanding" about the
existence of such a policy.
</P>
<P>
Premier-designate Frank Hsieh dismissed Tuesday reports that
President Chen has asked the politically appointed officials to take
part in local chief elections, saying that "this is not the
president's policy."
</P>
<P>
Echoing Hsieh's words, Su said that the president has no such
intention. The DPP is in charge of the nomination of the party
candidates for the elections, he said, adding that there will be
consultations with DPP aspirants and that primaries will then be held
to select the candidates.
</P>
<P>
Su said that the party will give its utmost consideration to each
city and county and try to enlist the best talent to serve at the
local level.
</P>
<P>
"Those who come forward for the elections will have to meet local
expectations, " Su said, adding that "the DPP has no such culture of
designating anyone for posts."
</P>
<P>
Su, who will soon assume the post of DPP chair0an, also said that
as the ruling party, the DPP will assist the new Cabinet to do its
job well.

NTU PRESIDENT TO CONFER HONORARY DEGREE ON NOBEL LAUREATE IN PARIS

<TEXT>
<P>
National Taiwan University (NTU) President
Chen Wei-chao has flown to Paris to confer an honorary doctorate on
Gao Xingjian, winner of the 2000 Nobel Prize in literature, an NTU
spokesman said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Chen headed for Paris a day earlier in the company of Peng
Ching-hsi, dean of the NTU College of Literature, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The nation's top university announced its decision last November
to confer the honorary academic degree on Gao, the first Nobel
literature laureate of Chinese origin, as part of its 76th
anniversary celebrations.
</P>
<P>
Gao did not travel to Taipei to receive the honor at the
university's Nov. 15 celebration ceremony because of poor health, but
he addressed the event via a 10-minute pre-recorded video in which he
expressed his gratitude for the NTU's recognition of his literary
career.
</P>
<P>
As NTU is closed for the winter vacation, the spokesman said,
Chen decided to fly to Paris to confer the honorary degree on Gao in
person.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the spokesman said, Chen will take advantage of the
occasion to discuss technical details regarding Gao's previous
promise to give lectures at NTU if his health improves.
</P>
<P>
As an alternative arrangement in case that Gao cannot make a
lecture tour to Taiwan, the spokesman said, NTU may send a literature
professor to Paris and have their dialogue recorded as a video for
teaching purposes.
</P>
<P>
The theme of the lectures may focus on "literature and life" and
"literature and art," the spokesman added. Gao is both a novelist and
painter.
</P>
<P>
Gao, who was born in mainland China's Jiangxi Province in 1940,
left the mainland in 1987 and settled a year later in France as a
political refugee. He has been to Taiwan on several occasions. In
2002, an opera written by him in collaboration with mainland composer
Xu Shuya, "Snow in August," was premiered in Taipei to rave reviews.

FEMALE FOREIGN WORKERS SAID FORCED TO DO MEN'S JOBS
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei, Jan. 26 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A labor group Wednesday claimed that female
foreign laborers being forced to do men's jobs is "anti-human
rights."
</P>
<P>
The Taiwan International Workers Association (TIWA) held a press
conference at the Legislative Yuan Wednesday to publicize the fact
that female foreign workers have been forced to do men's jobs as a
result of secret arrangements or opaque operations by labor brokers
and labor affairs authorities.
</P>
<P>
For example, said TIWA Secretary-General Ku Yu-ling, 112 women
workers who lost their jobs when the electronics company they worked
for in Taipei County closed without notice were forced to work at
steel mills, furnace plants, cement plants or heavy machinery
factories.
</P>
<P>
At the press meeting, one Filipino worker said that she and three
other women workers from Southeast Asia were assigned to a furnace
plant in Linkuo, Taipei County, in mid January.
The four of them, she said, felt so deprived and disappointed that
they cried all night and could not sleep.
</P>
<P>
Many of the women workers were repatriated back to their home
countries when they either could not do men's jobs or their new
employers refused to have them, Ku said.
</P>
<P>
Ku added that this was probably done to make room for male
foreign workers to come to Taiwan to work.
</P>
<P>
Ku demanded that the government make transparent the data on
foreign workers changing jobs and that it allow foreign workers
access to choice and the right to refuse jobs.
</P>
<P>
TIWA officials said that in accordance with existing labor laws,
there should be open coordination meetings on individuals when
they are changing their place of employment. The so-called
coordination meetings, however, have been just a simple supply of
basic information about the individuals without interpreters on hand
and without allowing the individuals involved to speak their
minds, a situation they claimed is tantamount to "an uncontrolled
flesh market."

<P>
CEPD officials said that due to Taiwan's difficult situation in
the international community and the fact that it is not a member of
the United Nations, Taiwan lacks scores in regard to international
treaties and participation in international activities, resulting in
low scoring in the ESI rankings.
</P>
<P>
The 2005 ESI rankings of 146 countries and areas around the world
was jointly produced by the Global Leaders for Tomorrow Environment
Task Force under the World Economic Forum, the Yale Center for
Environmental Law and Policy and the Center for International Earth
Science Information Network at Columbia University. The rankings are
expected to be formally announced at the end of January or early
February.
</P>
<P>
The last time the three organizations published a similar index
was in 2002.
</P>
<P>
CEPD officials claimed that it is unfair to Taiwan, as the three
organizations judged Taiwan without obtaining sufficient information
about the country.
</P>
<P>
Environmental sustainability is actually an effort tailor-made by
individual countries in accordance with the needs and situations of
that country, CEPD officials claimed, adding that they feel it is
weird to adopt an international ranking based on a universal set of
criteria.
</P>
<P>
They said that Taiwan was ranked low on the 2005 ESI, which is
based on 2003 data, mainly because social pressure on the island was
unprecedentedly high immediately after the onslaught of severe acute
respiratory syndrome, the resulting decline of people using the MRT,
as well as the drought in the latter half of the year, which
deteriorated the water quality.

KMT, PFP NEED TO SECURE SUPPORT FOR LEGISLATIVE TICKET
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei, Jan. 26 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jyn-ping said
Wednesday that the opposition Kuomintang (KMT) and People First Party
(PFP) will try to solidify support for a ticket of himself and PFP
Legislator at large-elect Chung Jung-chi in the legislative speaker
and vice speaker elections scheduled for Feb. 1.
</P>
<P>
Wang said that he had contacted Chung about the elections and
said the two parties are discussing campaign strategies, adding that
there will be a unity meeting Jan. 31 to try to secure votes for a
"Wang-Chung" ticket.
</P>
<P>
He also said that he was "unaware" of whether KMT Chairman Lien
Chan had discussed the issue with PFP Chairman James Soong, who is
currently visiting the United States.
</P>
<P>
But he stressed that once the "Wang-Chung ticket" is formed, both
men will have to pull out all the stops to achieve victory.
</P>
<P>
Wang made the remarks after attending the funeral for Lien's
mother-in-law in Taipei.
</P>
<P>
Wang has been campaigning hard to retain his speaker post in the
past few weeks, traveling around the island to court the support of
re-elected and newly elected legislators.
</P>
<P>
Party sources said that Wang is almost certain to win
re-election, as the "pan-blue alliance" of the KMT and the PFP
jointly command a majority of 114 seats in the new 225-member
legislature. As for Chung's deputy speakership bid, the sources said,
it will depend on whether the two parties can consolidate unity
within the alliance.
</P>
<P>
There have been reports that some KMT legislators-elect would
prefer to support the re-election of incumbent Legislative Yuan Vice
President P.K. Chiang, who is also a KMT vice chairman and who has
also served as minister of economic affairs and chairman of the
Council for Economic Planning and Development.
</P>
<P>
The "pan-green camp" of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party
and the Taiwan Solidarity Union, which control a total of 101
legislative seats, has yet to unveil its ticket for the elections.
</P>
<P>
While DPP Secretary-General Chang Chun-hsiung, who will be a
legislator-at-large in the new legislature, has ruled out running for
the speakership, veteran DPP Legislator Trong Chai has announced his
intention to vie for the top legislative post.
</P>
<P>
Some reports have speculated that Chai might team up with acting
DPP Chairman Ker Chien-ming.

<TEXT>
<P>
Vice President Annette Lu inspected the
Leseng Sanatorium for leprosy patients in Hsinchuang, Taipei County
Wednesday as part of efforts to review a controversial plan to
relocate the institution.
</P>
<P>
Lu was accompanied by Department of Health Minister Chen
Chien-jen and members of the Presidential Office Human Rights
Advisory Committee.
</P>
<P>
Authorities plan to demolish and relocate the sanatorium to make
way for a mass rapid transit (MRT) project in Hsinchuang. Opposing
the plan, a group of civic activists and patients at the sanatorium
have launched a campaign asking that the 74-year-old establishment be
preserved and designated a historic site.
</P>
<P>
Lin Po-yu, head of Taipei County's Cultural Affairs Bureau, said
that any change to the MRT project will affect its cost and
construction schedule and he asked the Cabinet to step in to help the
county government solve the problem.
</P>
<P>
Lu pledged that the government will provide proper care for the
338 patients at the sanatorium and do its best to preserve cultural
assets.
</P>
<P>
Lu said she hopes the Cabinet will work out a plan that provides
proper placement for the patients while not affecting the MRT project
after Frank Hsieh is sworn in as the next premier Feb. 1.
</P>
<P>
She later visited a community for the elderly that was
established by the Chang Gung Memorial Hospital in Kueishan township,
Taoyuan County.
</P>
<P>
The community, which provides more than 4,000 housing units on 43
hectares, was built to cope with the need of an aging society,
according to Chang Gung officials.
</P>
<P>
Inspired by the idea, Lu proposed that a community for
disadvantaged groups such as the poor and single parents be set up to
facilitate care by social welfare authorities.

<P>
Executive Yuan spokesman and acting
Kaohsiung Mayor-designate Chen Chi-mai said Wednesday that he will
push for city development of Taiwan's second-largest city based on
the principles of "stability, consultation and progress."
</P>
<P>
Chen will take up the mayorship left vacant by Frank Hsieh, whose
appointment by President Chen Shui-bian as the new premier was
confirmed Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
He expressed appreciation to Chen and Hsieh for their trust in
his ability to serve the southern port city.
</P>
<P>
In the initial stage, he said, the city government will focus on
stability and all heads of city departments will remain unchanged.
The lineup will only undergo adjustment in July "on a contingency
basis," he added.
</P>
<P>
He also pledged to seek cooperation between the Kaohsiung city
government and city council to solicit support across the party
spectrum.
</P>
<P>
Saying that the DPP is the guarantee of quality, he cited the
examples of Premier Yu Shyi-kun, who created "the Ilan experience"
while serving as Ilan magistrate, as well as President Chen Shui-bian
and his "Taipei experience" during his term as Taipei mayor.
</P>
<P>
Chen said that public polls have found that Hsieh's approval
rating was over 80 percent and that he feels it will be a daunting
challenge for him to maintain such a high rating.
</P>
<P>
He pledged to do his best to turn Kaohsiung into a "marine
capital and a friendly city."

CEPD, OCAC TO HELP OVERSEAS CHINESE SET UP FIRMS IN TAIWAN

<P>
A government plan aimed at inspiring
overseas Chinese to start their own businesses in Taiwan to help
create more jobs will be launched prior to the Lunar New Year
holiday, an official of the Cabinet-level Council for Economic
Planning and Development (CEPD) said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
In order to encourage overseas Chinese to set up businesses in
Taiwan, the Cabinet-level Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission (OCAC)
will join hands with the CEPD to launch the NT$200 million (US$6.25
million) business creation project, the official said.
</P>
<P>
The Executive Yuan's Sino-American Fund for Economic and Social
Development will contribute NT$100 million to finance the project,
while the remaining NT$100 million will be provided by Bank of
Overseas Chinese, Bank of Taiwan and Cathay United Bank, the official
went on.
</P>
<P>
Those who possess overseas Chinese identification cards issued by
the OCAC will be entitled to apply for soft loans under the plan, the
official said, adding that the plan is expected to offer funds to 50
applicants, creating 200 jobs.
</P>
<P>
According to the official, annual turnover from the newly created
businesses under the plan is forecast to reach NT$1 billion.

OCAC and CEPD officials are scheduled to expound on the details

TAIWAN RELATIVELY ADVANCED IN ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY: CEPD
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Jan.  26 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taiwan is relatively advanced in the
research of environmental sustainability and has assisted various
neighboring countries in setting up criteria and methodology to
examine their environments, government officials claimed Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
According to officials at the Cabinet-level Council for Economic
Planning and Development (CEPD) , Taiwan is actually strong in this
field and has helped Vietnam, Thailand, the Philippines, Indonesia
and Malaysia construct a set of "pressure, state, response (PSR) "
mechanisms to measure and quantify environmental performance, the
findings of which have been periodically disclosed every year since
2003.
</P>
<P>
Claiming that Taiwan has made noticeable progress in
environmental sustainability in recent years, especially on the
fronts of pollution control and improving urban environments, the
officials also acknowledged that there is ample room for the country
to make improvements in environmental conservation, law enforcement
and policy.
</P>
<P>
They ascribed the country's poor performance in a just-released
Environmental Sustainability Index (ESI) survey mainly to the lack of
reliable data and sufficient information about Taiwan available to
the studying agencies.
</P>
<P>
Due to Taiwan's absence from most world bodies, including the
United Nations, the country got low scores in many categories as a
result of its inability to take part in international activities and
global pacts, they pointed out, arguing that the poll result is
extremely unfair to Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Their comments came after that the World Economic Forum prepared
to publish the results of an ESI survey in which Taiwan, together
with Haiti, Iraq and Kuwait, was ranked at the bottom, with North
Korea being the very bottom of the list. Finland, Norway and Uruguay
were the top three.
</P>
<P>
The 146-nation poll was jointly carried out by the World Economic
Forum, the Yale Center for Environmental Law and Policy, the Global
Leaders for Tomorrow Environment Task Force and the Center for
International Earth Science Information Network.
</P>
<P>
It examined 22 key factors that contribute to environmental
performance and results, such as urban air quality, overall public
health and environmental regulations.

ROC DONATES FUNDS TO U.S. MUSEUM TO BOOST CULTURAL EXCHANGES

The Republic of China government
donated NT$30,000 to the National Museum of Natural History in
Washington, D.C. Tuesday to promote cultural exchanges between Taiwan
and the U.S. museum.
</P>
<P>
David Ta-wei Lee, the ROC representative to the United States,
donated the money to the museum's Taiwan Heritage Fund on behalf of
the government. Paul Taylor, the museum's Asian culture and history
program director, received the donation on behalf of the museum.
</P>
<P>
The National Museum of Natural History is part of the Smithsonian
Institution. A group of Taiwanese-Americans began pushing for the
establishment of the Taiwan Heritage Fund last year as part of their
efforts to boost Taiwan-U.S. cultural exchanges.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the Smithsonian Institution is the largest U.S.
museum group, Lee said the establishment of the Taiwan Heritage
Fund will contribute a great deal to bilateral cultural exchanges in
the future and that the US$30,000 was part of this effort.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the natural history museum sponsored a special program
Tuesday to introduce traditional Taiwanese festivities and folk arts,
including paper-cutting and making traditional figurines out of
colored dough.
</P>
<P>
A film produced by the Government Information Office to introduce
Taiwan's major museums, including the world-famous National Palace
Museum, the National Museum of Natural Science and the National
Museum of Marine Biology and Aquarium, was also shown as part of the
program, while a collection of photos featuring Taiwan's natural
scenery and beauty also went on display.
</P>

Taylor said the Taiwan-focused program is just the start of
bilateral cooperation. In the future, he said, the Smithsonian
Institution will cooperate with major Taiwan museums in organizing
various exhibitions featuring Taiwanese folk music, traditional

U.S. OPPOSES EUROPE LIFTING ARMS BAN ON CHINA DUE TO HUMAN RIGHTS
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Washington,  Jan.  25 (CNA)
(By Oliver Lin and Y.F. Low)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The United States opposes Europe
lifting its arms embargo against mainland China mainly because of the
mainland's human rights record, although regional stability,
especially that across the Taiwan Strait, remains one of Washington's
long-standing concerns, a U.S. State Department official said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
State Department Spokesman Richard Boucher made the remarks at a
daily news briefing.
</P>
<P>
Boucher said it is not the right policy decision and the right
time to expand arms sales to the mainland and that such a move sends
the wrong signal given the lack of improvement and the negative
developments in the mainland's human rights record.
</P>
<P>
"We would, of course, have particular concerns about particular
kinds of weapons systems that might be sold that could alter or
change the military situation in the region, particularly vis-a-vis
Taiwan. And as you know, in various cases we've expressed those
concerns before, but at this point I think it's based on the human
rights signal that it would send," Boucher said.
</P>
<P>
While Washington welcomes the mainland, which is emerging as a
power in many areas and growing in importance, to participate more in
world affairs, it also expects China to adopt international standards
in various aspects such as its roles in the World Trade Organization
and the United Nations and human rights protection, he said.
</P>
<P>
On the European Union's plan to adopt a code of conduct to govern
arms sales to the mainland after the embargo is lifted, Boucher said
he cannot reject it until he has seen it.
</P>
<P>
"We would have to look at whatever they come up with to see if it
satisfied some of our other concerns," he said.

The Taiwan External Trade Development
Council (TAITRA) will set up an online system to help promote
Taiwan's tourism in cooperation with domestic travel agents, a TAITRA
official disclosed Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Considering that more and more foreign businessmen take advantage
of their business trips to Taiwan to visit domestic scenic spots and

the official said.
</P>
<P>
According to the official, the main purpose of the Web site is to

In addition, the official said, TAITRA has set up a tourism
division which will cooperate with the Tourism Bureau, domestic air
carriers and travel agents to boost the nation's tourism by inspiring
foreign business people to tour the island after concluding their
business activities.
</P>
<P>
The official voiced the hope that the planned online system will
serve as an effective platform to help attract more foreign
businessmen to stay an extra day and a half in Taiwan to tour the
island after their business activities, creating US$3 million-worth
of economic benefits for the nation.

According to the sources, Wu's colleagues immediately performed
emergency rescue measures and informed their superiors of the
incident.
</P>
<P>
After receiving the information from the U.S. naval base, the
sources said, the Naval Fleet Command also immediately notified Wu's
family in Taiwan of the tragedy and sent staff members to assist in
handling the aftermath.
</P>
<P>
Wu was a member of the ROC Navy staff working at a U.S. naval
base in preparation for taking delivery of four Kidd-class destroyers
that Taiwan purchased from the United States in 2001. The four
destroyers were originally built for the Shah of Iran in 1979, but
was later mothballed after Iran canceled the deal. The four warships
are being refurbished and undergoing maintenance on the U.S. east
coast before being delivered to Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
In the past, Taiwan sent special naval teams to the United States
to receive training and take delivery of U.S.-built warships. As the
work was very complicated and stressful, military sources said, some
mishaps involving naval staff have been reported in the past.
</P>
<P>
According to a recent report, the first of the four Kidd- class
destroyers will be delivered ahead of schedule and commissioned into
service by the ROC's Oct. 10 National Day this year.
</P>
<P>
Military sources said the Kidd-class destroyers -- to be equipped
with a new missile package -- have superb naval and air defense
capabilities and will provide Taiwan with an effective deterrent
against mainland Chinese attacks up to around the year 2010 ahead of
China further beefing up its navy with advanced weapon systems.

UNAUTHORIZED PASSENGERS ON CHARTER FLIGHTS WILL BE PROSECUTED
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Jan.  26 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Passengers in mainland China who are
ineligible to take the inaugural Chinese Lunar New Year charter
flights between Taiwan and the mainland but do so anyway will be
prosecuted under the document forgery law, government officials said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
According to officials with the Bureau of Immigration under the
National Police Administration, the charter flights arranged for the
Jan. 29 to Feb. 20 holiday period are for the exclusive use of
mainland-based Taiwan business people and their families. Taiwan
students in the mainland are also excluded from the service.
</P>
<P>
Anyone who poses as being qualified to take the flights but is
not will be punished according to law, the officials said, adding
that domestic tourist agencies infringing on relevant regulations
will also be dealt with by the Ministry of Transportation and
Communications.
</P>
<P>
They urged the Travel Agents Association of the ROC and Taiwan
businessmen's groups in mainland China to clearly verify the status
of passengers in advance.
</P>
<P>
As of noon the same day, about 4,000 Taiwan business people and
their dependents in the mainland -- 2,400 in Shanghai, 1,050 in
Guangzhou and 480 in Beijing -- have applied to use the direct
charter flights to Taiwan. On the other side, only nine people from
Taiwan have applied to fly to mainland China during the period.
</P>
<P>
The historic charter flight deal will allow mainland carriers to
land on Taiwan soil for the first time in 55 years under an agreement
that six aviation companies from either side can provide the non-stop
service.
</P>
<P>
Only six Taiwan carriers operated the charter flights in 2003,
the first time the service was offered. The flights were not direct
as is the case this year since the planes had to land in Hong Kong or
Macau first before continuing on to their mainland destinations and
returning from the mainland to Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
The charter flights were aborted the next year due to the
mainland's refusal to talk with Taiwan over its demand that mainland
airlines also be included in the charter flights.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan and mainland China split in 1949 after a Chinese civil war
in the mainland. Direct trade, transport and postal links have been
absent between the two sides since that time.

TAIWAN UNIVERSITIES GEAR UP TO ATTRACT FOREIGN STUDENTS

Taipei, Jan. 26 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)

<TEXT>
<P>
About 30 Taiwan universities will take part
in an education exhibition in South Korea in March as part of their
efforts to attract more foreign students to study in Taiwan, the
Ministry of Education (MOE) said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Major local universities will also organize delegations to stage
Taiwan higher education exhibitions in Eastern European and Southeast
Asian countries as well as in India later this year to introduce
their special features and attract talented students in those
countries to do advanced studies in Taiwan, MOE officials said.
</P>
<P>
According to the officials, luring foreign students to Taiwan is
one of the MOE's present priorities. In 2002, 1,283 foreign students
pursued advanced academic degrees in Taiwan. The ministry hopes to
increase the number to 12,830 in 10 years.
</P>
<P>
Latest MOE tallies showed that 1,568 foreign students were
pursuing advanced degrees in Taiwan in 2003 and the number registered
a 26 percent year-on-year growth to reach 1,969 in 2004. Among them,
314 hailed from Japan; 272 from South Korea; 262 from Malaysia; 238
from the United States; and 111 from Vietnam.

PRESIDENT'S '4 NOES PLUS ONE' PLEDGE REMAINS IN PLACE: DPP OFFICIAL
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,   Jan.  26  (CNA)
(By Luis Huang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ruling Democratic Progressive Party
Secretary-General Chang Chun-hsiung said Wednesday that the "four
noes plus one" pledge made by President Chen Shui-bian in his two
inaugural addresses remains in place.
</P>
<P>
Chang made the remarks after Premier-designate Frank Hsieh said
during an exclusive interview with a cable TV station Tuesday that
the government should refrain from forcing state-owned enterprises
and other institutions to change their names that include the word
"China."
</P>
<P>
As for the constitutional re-engineering plan, Hsieh, who serves
now as Kaohsiung mayor, said that several obsolete provisions of the
existing Constitution should be revised, but that the government
should respect relevant viewpoints from different sectors before
revision.
</P>
<P>
In response, Chang stressed that President Chen has repeatedly
pledged to follow his "four noes plus one" policy -- no declaration
of Taiwan independence if Beijing does not use military force against
Taiwan, no alteration of the national official title, no inclusion of
the "state-to-state" description in the Constitution, no referendum
to change the status quo in regard to independence or unification and
no abolition of the National Reunification Council or the National
Reunification Guidelines.
</P>
<P>
Chang further said that Chen has also reiterated on many
occasions that controversial issues will not be treated in the
constitutional re-engineering process, adding that Hsieh's advocacy
is consistent with the president's long-term policy and stance.
</P>
<P>
Last December President Chen proposed including "Taiwan" in the
names of overseas missions and state-owned enterprises to highlight a
separate national identity from mainland China, although the United
States does not support such a plan, believing that it would
unilaterally change Taiwan's status.

TAIWAN COOPERATION WITH JAPANESE FIRMS ON TRACK: ECONOMICS MINISTER

Taipei,  Jan.  26 (CNA)

<TEXT>
<P>
Cooperative ventures between Taiwan and
various top Japanese hi-tech companies are on track, an encouraging
development that may see promising projects crystallize, Minister of
Economic Affairs Ho Mei-yueh said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
According to Ho, Taiwan's strong semiconductor and
telecommunications industries have helped clear the way for bilateral
cooperation during her recent meetings in Tokyo with representatives
from top Japanese companies such as NEC, Sony, Access, Namco, CMMI
and SCEI.
</P>
<P>
All these firms agreed to further work with Taiwan's industry and
help their Taiwan counterparts in upgrading production processes and
promote green businesses, such as the video game industry, she noted.
</P>
<P>
Access suggested that Taiwan set its sights on devising software
and chips capable of serving at least 100 million mobile phones and
the semi-official Institute for Information Industry (III) will help
toward that aim, she said.
</P>
<P>
NEC is assessing setting up a glass furnace in Taiwan and
outsourcing its software designing business to Taiwan companies under
the auspices of the III, while CMMI is planning to seek cooperative
partners in Taiwan, she added.
</P>
<P>
Namco and SCEI are in particular interested in fostering local
talent with creative abilities for video game designs, while Olympus
and Hitachi are focusing their attention on precision instruments. In
addition, NEC and Sony have promised to assist Taiwan in setting up a
set of green manufacturing processes in line with the European
Union's high standards.
</P>
<P>
The economics minister visited Japan Jan. 17-22 to woo investment
and to thank those that have done business with Taiwan.

DPP TO BE FLEXIBLE TOWARD SPEAKER, DEPUTY SPEAKER ELECTIONS: WHIP
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Jan.  26 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The ruling Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) will exercise a maximum degree of flexibility toward the Feb. 1
elections for Legislative Yuan speaker and deputy speaker, a party
whip said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Tsai Huang-liang, a DPP legislative caucus whip, said the DPP's
top goal in participating in the speaker and deputy speaker elections
is to contribute to inter-party reconciliation and smooth Legislative
Yuan operations. "Our top goal is to end the more than four years of
inter-party wrangling inside the legislature and inject a new spirit
of reconciliation into the new legislature. Therefore, the DPP will
refrain from horsetrading strategies in the upcoming elections," Tsai
said.
</P>
<P>
He further said the DPP legislative caucus will not take the
initiative to contact opposition People First Party (PFP) Legislator
Shen Chih-hwei to seek any possibility of cooperation in the speaker
and deputy speaker elections. Shen narrowly lost to PFP
Legislator-elect Chung Jung-chi for the party's nomination to run for
deputy speaker. Shen reportedly has already gone abroad and will not
return to vote in the elections. According to an inter-party deal,
the two "pan-blue" parties -- the Kuomintang and the PFP -- will
cooperate with incumbent Legislative Yuan President Wang Jin-pyng,
who is running for re-election, and Chung running for the deputy
speakership. The two parties jointly control a slim majority in the
225-seat legislature to be inaugurated Feb. 1.
</P>
<P>
Tsai said if those newly elected or re-elected KMT and PFP
legislators who are not supportive of the Wang-Chung ticket are
willing to cooperate with the DPP caucus, the DPP would be willing to
support any makeup of the ticket, such as a PFP-DPP ticket, or a
KMT-DPP ticket.
</P>
<P>
"So long as we can form a majority alliance in the new
legislature, we can even not field our own candidates to run for the
two posts and instead support 'allies' in the elections," Tsai said.
</P>
<P>
The DPP caucus will hold a meeting Friday to discuss "winning"
strategies and decide on whether to field its own candidates or who
should represent the party in the elections.
</P>
<P>
After DPP Secretary-General Chang Chun-hsiung, who will be a
legislator-at large in the new legislature, ruled out running for
speaker Monday, veteran DPP Legislator Trong Chai later announced his
intention to run for the top legislative post. Acting DPP Chairman
Ker Chien-ming has also expressed interest in running for speaker.

TAIWAN'S ECONOMIC GROWTH MAY TOP 5 PERCENT THIS YEAR: OFFICIAL

<P>
Taiwan's economic growth may top the target
of 5 percent set by the Council for Economic Planning and Development
Council (CEPD), a CEPD official said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Yeh Ming-feng, a CEPD vice chairman, said that integrating
resources by creative ways and means, expanding domestic demand,
speeding up structural adjustment and obtaining sustainable growth
are the four basic strategies taken by the CEPD for achieving the
target.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on a forecast by the United Nations that predicts
Taiwan's economic growth rate will be 4.25 percent this year, less
than Hong Kong's 6 percent, Singapore's 5.5 percent and South Korea's
4.5 percent, Yeh said that the U.N. may have miscalculated Taiwan's
dynamism due to a lack of updated information, given that Taiwan is
not a U.N. member.
</P>
<P>
The new 10 major construction projects will inject a shot in the
arm to Taiwan's economic expansion by increasing domestic demand and
job opportunities and improving the country's overall investment
environment, he explained.
</P>
<P>
Also, he said, private participation in public construction
projects increased to NT$130.7 billion (US$4.08 billion) in 2004 from
NT$109.8 billion posted in the previous year and it is expected to
jump to NT$186.9 billion this year, which is estimated to move up the
country's economic growth an additional 0.5 percent.

'MINI THREE-LINKS' HAS INCREASED CROSS-STRAIT EXCHANGES

<TEXT>
<P>
Shipping and personnel exchanges between
the two sides of the Taiwan Strait have been increasing thanks to the
implementation of the "mini three-links" in 2001, an official of the
Cabinet-level Directorate-General of Budget, Accounting and
Statistics (DGBAS) said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan took the initiative to open its two offshore defense
outposts -- Kinmen and Matsu -- for direct trade, mail and shipping
links with mainland China's Xiamen and Mawei in Fujian province at
the beginning of 2001.
</P>
<P>
According to DGBAS-compiled statistics, travelers made 215,000
cross-strait trips via Kinmen and Matsu in 2004, up 1.5 times from
the previous year's level.
</P>
<P>
A total of 3,029 voyages were made by ships from both sides, up
1,686 voyages year-on-year, with Taiwan- and mainland-registered
vessels increasing 445 and 1,241 voyages, respectively, the
statistics show.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, people across the Taiwan Strait made 470 million phone
calls for a total of 1.75 billion minutes in the first 11 months of
2004, representing an increase of 18.2 percent and 27.5 percent from
the previous year's level, respectively.

HIGH-SPEED RAIL TO BE INAUGURATED AS SCHEDULED: THSRC CHAIRWOMAN
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Tainan County,  southern Taiwan,  Jan. 27 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taiwan High Speed
Rail Corp. (THSRC) Chairwoman Nita Ing reassured the country Thursday
that the goal of inaugurating the high-speed railway in October this
year remains firm and must be achieved.
</P>
<P>
Ing presided over a ceremony held at the Yanchao depot in
Kaohsiung County marking an official trial run of 12 Shinkansen-built
high-speed rail train carriages from Yanchao to the Tainan station at
a speed of 30 kilometers per hour.
</P>
<P>
The trial run was carried out without a hitch.
</P>
<P>
Ing assured that Taiwan's first high-speed railway system will be
inaugurated Oct. 31 as originally scheduled despite some technical
and financial difficulties.
</P>
<P>
Vice Premier Yeh Chu-lan, Minister of Transportation and
Communications Lin Ling-san, and local government officials from
Tainan and Kaohsiung were on hand to witness the historic moment.
</P>
<P>
In preparation for Thursday's test run, engineers from Taiwan and
Japan spent more than six hours Wednesday testing various functions
of the high-speed train to ensure that it would operate properly and
safely.
</P>
<P>
When the new 345-kilometer railway is inaugurated, a trip from
Taipei in the north to Kaohsiung in the south will take less than 90
minutes.
</P>
<P>
The high-speed rail, which will form the backbone of western
Taiwan's mass rapid transportation network, will connect eight
metropolitan areas between Taiwan's two largest cities. It will be
able to transport at least 300,000 passengers daily when it becomes
fully operational.
</P>
<P>
Infrastructure, including broadband communication systems, is
being built in special zones in the vicinity of the high speed
railway stations at Taoyuan, Hsinchu, Taichung, Chiayi and Tainan to
facilitate the formation of special business complexes in the five
cities.
</P>
<P>
The THSRC has had a bumpy performance in its fund-raising
efforts. It was also hit hard when an international arbitration body
ruled that it had to pay a massive amount in damages to its former
partner.
</P>
<P>
Ing declined to answer reporters' questions about whether she has
contacted Formosa Plastics Group Chairman Wang Yung-ching for help in
raising funds. Ing said that the matter is one of professional
planning and that she is not supposed to disclose details during the
process.
</P>
<P>
The multibillion-dollar railway system is Taiwan's first
infrastructure project being built under the build-operate-transfer
(BOT) model.

TAIWAN CITIZENS TO BE ISSUED NEW 'FORGERY-PROOF' ID CARDS IN JULY
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Jan.  27 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROC ID cards will be more difficult to
counterfeit after July when the Ministry of the Interior begins
issuing new ID cards with 21 anti-forgery features, Minister of the
Interior Su Jia-chyuan said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The last time that Taiwan citizens were issued new ID cards
nationwide was 19 years ago.
</P>
<P>
The new ROC ID cards will also have horizontal left-to-right
Chinese writing, Su said, adding that the cards will be
pinkish-purple and the color will be the same for both men and women.
</P>
<P>
Su said that it is still unclear whether the new ROC ID cards
will contain a space reserved for the owner's fingerprint. "It will
be decided near the circulation date based on the household
registration law in effect at that time," he added.
</P>
<P>
Some human rights groups have decried this, saying that mandatory
fingerprinting is a human rights violation.
</P>
<P>
As with the existing ones, the new ID cards will carry the
cardholder's name, gender, date of birth, ID card number and issuance
date, as well as a photo of the cardholder, Su noted as he showed the
media a sample ID card.
</P>
<P>
The new ID cards will carry the names of the cardholder's
parents, the name of his or her spouse, military service category,
place of birth and the cardholder's address, as well as an
anti-forgery bar code on the back of the card.
</P>
<P>
Probably the biggest difference from the old ones is that the new
ID cards will be designed using horizontal left-to-right Chinese
writing to follow legislation passed last year mandating that all
official documents and related paperwork in Taiwan be changed to that
format from the current vertical right-to-left format.
</P>
<P>
The vertical, top-to-bottom characters and right-to-left columns
writing format has been the main style used by the Chinese for
thousands of years.

<TEXT>
<P>
President Chen Shui-bian's deputy chief of
staff, Cho Jung-tai, and Vice Minister of Justice Shih Mao-lin will
be promoted, according to Premier-designate Frank Hsieh Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Cho will be a minister-without-portfolio and a spokesman for the
Executive Yuan. He will replace current Executive Yuan spokesman Chen
Chi-mai, who has been named acting mayor of the southern port city of
Kaohsiung, Hsieh said.
</P>
<P>
Chen Chi-mai will fill the post left vacant as a result of
Hsieh's promotion to premier, which was confirmed Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Current Vice Minister of Justice Shih Mao-lin will be promoted to
justice minister to succeed Chen Ding-nan, who recently has announced
he will run for magistrate of his home county of Ilan, Hsieh said.
</P>
<P>
Hsieh also said that he has sounded out Legislative Yuan Deputy
Speaker P. K. Chiang about his being vice premier, but Chiang turned
down the offer. Chiang is currently a vice chairman of the opposition
Kuomintang.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the lineup of his Cabinet is expected to be finalized
within several days, Hsieh said that he has been actively seeking
President Chen's input on who should serve as his deputy and that the
president could announce the name of the new vice premier during his
current South Pacific trip.
</P>
<P>
President Chen departed Thursday on a five-day state visit to
Palau and the Solomon Islands.
</P>
<P>
Cho and Shih's appointments marked the second wave of the Cabinet
reshuffle since Hsieh became premier-designate Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Premier Yu Shyi-kun led the Cabinet to resign en masse Monday
ahead of the start of the new legislature Feb. 1.

<P>
The plan between the opposition Kuomintang
(KMT) and People First Party (PFP) to cooperate in the Feb. 1
elections for legislative speaker and vice speaker remains unchanged
despite the postponement of PFP Chairman James Soong's return from
the United States, KMT Vice Chairman and Legislative Yuan Speaker
Wang Jin-pyng said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
While the KMT's Central Standing Committee is scheduled to meet
Friday to officially nominate Wang to run for the next speakership,
the PFP has decided to name Chung Jung-chi for the post of vice
speaker.
</P>
<P>
Previous reports said that Soong would return to Taiwan Friday to
campaign for the joint KMT-PFP candidates and consult with the KMT
leadership on details concerning the two parties' campaign strategy.
</P>
<P>
However, Chung said Thursday Soong has postponed his return until
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Wang said the change in Soong's schedule will not affect the two
parties' cooperation plan and that Soong can still act as a
facilitator while in the United States.
</P>
<P>
During the remaining few days before the elections, Chung will
visit KMT and independent legislators to lobby for his bid for vice
speaker, and Chung's nephew, Legislator Chung Shao-ho, will visit PFP
legislators on his behalf, sources said.

Also, the legislative caucuses of the KMT and PFP are expected to

<TEXT>
<P>
President Chen Shui-bian left Taipei
Thursday for a five-day visit to Palau and the Solomon Islands -- two
of the Republic of China's allies in the South Pacific.
</P>
<P>
Chen will be the first ROC president ever to visit the nation's
diplomatic allies in the South Pacific.
</P>
<P>
The president will attend the inauguration of Tommy Remengesau
for a second term on Jan. 28 before heading to the Solomon Islands
Jan. 29. He is scheduled to return to Taipei Jan. 31.
</P>
<P>
Prior to his departure, Chen said regardless whether the ROC's
allies are big or small, as long as Taiwan reaches out, it will be
able to make friends and promote maneuvering space for the nation in
the international community.
</P>
<P>
Chen noted that Taiwan, just as Palau and the Solomon Islands,
are oceanic countries and share the Austronesian culture. It has for
years assisted the two allies develop their agriculture, fishery,
tourism, and has strengthened infrastructure and upgraded the
education of local people.
</P>
<P>
Saying that love knows no borders, Chen said that the love of
Taiwan people has been shown in relief efforts for victims of
tsunamis in South Asia, in overwhelming donations to help a trio of
brothers in Taiwan suffering from a rare degenerative disease known
as adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD) to seek medical treatment in the United
States, and in the outpouring of sympathy for an abused four-year-old
girl in Taiwan, whose parents later donated her organs after her
death.
</P>
<P>
The more important thing is that Taiwan has sown the seeds of
love through the long-term work of overseas volunteers, agricultural
mission, and medical mission, he said.
</P>
<P>
His state visit aims at cementing diplomatic relations as well as
letting Taiwan people know how Taiwan's love and friendship has borne
fruit with the allies in the South Pacific, the president said.
</P>
<P>
Chen also said that the new Cabinet under outgoing Kaohsiung
Mayor Frank Hsieh will be based on "consultations, dialogue and
stability, " adding that he hopes to bring about political stability,
ethnic harmony, and cross-strait peace.
</P>
<P>
On hand at CKS International Airport to see off the president
were first lady Wu Shu-jen, Vice President Annette Lu, outgoing
Premier Yu Shyi-kun, Premier-designate Hsieh, Presidential Office

OFFICIALS TO WELCOME CHARTER PLANES FROM MAINLAND TO TAIWAN
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Jan.  27 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Government officials will greet historic
charter flights from mainland China at domestic airports on Jan. 29,
the day when the special service begins to carry Taiwan businessmen
home for the lunar new year holiday in early February, an official at
the Cabinet-level Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
According to the MAC official, MAC Vice Chairman Chiu Tai-san,
Civil Aeronautics Administration Director-General Chang Kuo-cheng and
officials from the Ministry of Transportation and Communications and
the quasi-official Straits Exchange Foundation will get together that
day at Chiang Kai-shek International Airport (CKS) in northern Taiwan
to welcome the planes coming from the mainland.
</P>
<P>
Celebrations will also be held at Kaohsiung International Airport
in southern Taiwan -- two destinations connecting mainland China's
Shanghai, Beijing and Guangzhou in the special service for homecoming
Taiwan businessmen and their families during the holiday period
through Feb. 20.
</P>
<P>
Nine flights will be offered on the first day of the direct
service, to be provided by six aviation companies from either side.
</P>
<P>
At present, about 4,000 Taiwan business people and their
dependents in the mainland -- 2,400 in Shanghai, 1,050 in Guangzhou
and 480 in Beijing -- have applied to take the direct charter flights
to Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Officials from Taiwan and mainland China agreed on the flight
model in the middle of this month in Macau, under which mainland
carriers are also included in the service. 
</P>
<P>
The ground-breaking deal will allow mainland carriers to land on
Taiwan soil for the first time in 55 years since 1949, when the two
sides split after a civil war and banned direct trade, transport and
postal links across the Taiwan Strait.
</P>
<P>
It marks a departure from 2003, when the first such
Taiwan-mainland charter flights took off -- operated solely by Taiwan
airlines which had to fly via Hong Kong or Macau.

The Times: Haunted by my father, the
camp commandant.

THE voice of Monika Goeth quavers when she remembers her father
Amon, one of Nazi Germany's most savage camp commandants: "I have
never in my life known of someone so loved, so hated and so feared."
Before breakfast he would stride on to the balcony of his villa
overlooking Plaszow camp and shoot Jewish workers at random with his
hunting rifle. Then he would return to bed to join his mistress -- Frau
Goeth's mother. Plaszow is just a short drive from Auschwitz. Some of
the Jews there were murdered or worked to death. Some were sent to
Auschwitz to die. Some were saved by Oskar Schindler, who wheeled and
dealed with Goeth to buy the freedom of many hundreds of Plaszow
inmates. Goeth personally killed 500 Jews, and the prosecutor at his
trial in Cracow in 1946 called him "a modern incarnation of the
biblical Satan ". He was executed. On the 60th anniversary of the
liberation of the concentration camps, Monika Goeth faces the dilemma
common to all children of Nazi guards and SS torturers: "How far do
you separate the murderer from the father? How much of the murderer
is in me?"

Financial Times: Doubt cast on Brown's figures.

Taxes need to rise by £11bn a year if Gordon Brown is not to
break both of his self-imposed rules on public borrowing and public
debt, according to the most authoritative independent analysis of the
public finances. In its annual Green Budget, the Institute for Fiscal
Studies cast doubt on the chancellor's tax revenue forecasts and
calculated that he was likely to fall £6.5bn short of meeting his
golden rule - only to borrow to invest over an economic cycle.

<P>
Most Taiwan companies feel that it will be
business as usual during the first quarter of this year, with
pessimistic and optimistic views accounting for only about 15 percent
each, according to government poll released Thursday.
</P>
<P>
According to the survey results made public by the Cabinet-level
Council for Economic Planning and Development (CEPD) , 72 percent of
companies questioned in December were neutral about their business
outlook in the first quarter of this year, while 11 percent and 17
percent were positive and negative, respectively.
</P>
<P>
The 72 percent reflected an increase of 4 percent over the
November level, while the ratios for pessimists and optimists were
down by 3 percent and 1 percent, respectively.
</P>
<P>
In December, sales in Taiwan's manufacturing sector declined by
1.9 percent in value month-to-month but grew by 13.5 percent
year-to-year. Total export order value dropped by 1.9 percent as
compared to the November figure but rose by 15.1 percent on an annual
basis.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the December industry capacity utilization rate
averaged 80.3 percent, up by 0.2 percent from the previous month but
down by 0.1 percent from a year ago. Average business return rates
stood at 4.8 percent, a fall of 0.1 percent and 0.3 percent,
respectively, as compared to the ratios for November and a year
earlier.

NEW TSU CHAIRMAN TO COUNTER PROPOSED ANTI-SECESSION LAW
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Jan.  27 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU) will
promote a law to counter a proposed "anti-secession law" by mainland 
China, TSU Chairman Su Chin-chiang said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Su made the remarks during his inauguration in Taipei. On hand
for the ceremony were Vice President Annette Lu, former President Lee
Teng-hui, outgoing Premier Yu Shyi-kun, Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang
Jin-pyng, acting chairman of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) Ker Chien-ming, and DPP Vice Secretary-General Lee Ying-yuan.
</P>
<P>
Su, 52, a graduate of Armed Forces University (the predecessor of
the National Defense University) and formerly TSU secretary-general,
said that mainland China is fixated on swallowing Taiwan, and has
proposed an "anti-secession law " which will be reviewed by the full
National People's Congress in March.
</P>
<P>
The TSU will not be weak, but will "speak up" for Taiwan people
by promoting counter legislation, an "anti-containment" bill, Su
said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that it was not part of his career plan to serve as the
head of the TSU, but he was inspired by former President Lee.
</P>
<P>
"The TSU will always be on the side of the people of Taiwan, " Su
said, adding that the party will work toward changing the designation
of the nation, promote "Taiwanization and democratization" to move
toward the goals of a stable political situation, a revitalized
economy, a mature democracy and a strong Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
He also said that the TSU is concerned about underprivileged
groups, and is scheduled to formulate agricultural and fishery laws
for the benefit of grassroots people.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, former President Lee, who is considered as the TSU
spiritual leader, speaking on the same occasion, said that after the
Dec. 11 legislative elections, the political machinery faced a new
alignment.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the "pan-green camp" of the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party and the TSU fared worse than expectation in the
elections and the opposition "pan-blue alliance" still commands a
majority of 114 seats in the 225-member legislature.
</P>
<P>
For the sake of national development, the ruling and opposition
parties need to cooperate as long as this cooperation will not
deviate from the core values of Taiwan, and the TSU has no reason to
oppose such cooperation or become jealous of how others may
participate.
</P>
<P>
The formation of the TSU was not to gain benefits through playing
the ruling and opposition parties off each other, but to stabilize
the political situation, he reiterated.
</P>
<P>
The TSU must base itself on the principles of safeguarding the
nation's sovereignty and retaining sufficient self-defense
capabilities to help the government stabilize the political
situation. It must also actively take part in affairs promoting
cross-strait peaceful development to allow Taiwan to become a normal
country, Lee said.
</P>
<P>
The TSU needs to do some serious soul-searching for the
weaker-than-expected performance in the legislative elections, in
which the TSU gained 12 seats, he said, adding that the party needs
to reach out to grassroots people and offer attractive platforms
to turn crisis into opportunity, he added.
</P>
<P>
Former TSU Chairman Huang Chu-wen offered to resign after the
worse-than- expected performance in the elections.
</P>
<P>
Vice President Lu said that the TSU and former President Lee had
contributed to President Chen Shui-bian and her re-election bid in
2004, saying that the relations between the TSU and the DPP will
become even closer.
</P>
<P>
Premier Yu was positive about the TSU's contribution to the
nation's democratization and Taiwanization, saying also that it is
the staunch partner of the DPP and without its support many important
pieces of legislation, such as the budget, wouldn't have been passed
in the legislature.

TAIWAN ECONOMY RATED GREEN LIGHT FOR DECEMBER: CEPD
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Jan.  27 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A green light was recorded for Taiwan's
economy in December for the third consecutive month, meaning that the
domestic economy has gone from "brisk" to "stable, " the government
reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
According to the five-color rating system devised by the
Cabinet-level Council for Economic Planning and Development (CEPD) to
gauge Taiwan's economy, red means an overheated economy, yellow-red
presents a heating-up economy, green reflects stability, yellow-blue
stands for sluggishness and blue points to recession.
</P>
<P>
Hu Chung-ying, director of the CEPD's Economic Research
Department, pointed out that the domestic economy began to slow in
the fourth quarter of last year due to a less vigorous world economy,
rising oil prices and interest rates and the fallout from mainland
China's drive to restrict its overheated economy.

</P>
<P>
At the same time, the composite index for December fell to 25
points from 28 points in November in response to a slowed economy,
CEPD officials said, explaining that should the score drop below the
22-point level, a yellow-blue color will be shown to reflect a
lackluster economy.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, both the current index and the leading index slid to
108 and 104.2 in the same month, respectively, down by 2.4 percent
and 1.1 percent, respectively, compared to November.
</P>
<P>
The 2.4 percent fall was the largest in six months, with the
monthly industry production index and the manufacturing output index
both setting the first negative growth in the same six-month period.

FREEDOM, DEMOCRACY CONTRIBUTE TO WORLD PEACE: PRESIDENT

<TEXT>
<P>
Freedom and democracy contribute to world
peace, President Chen Shui-bian said in a speech delivered at the
Palau parliament Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Echoing United States President George W. Bush's promise to
spread freedom and democracy to the "darkest corners" of the world in
his Jan. 20 inaugural speech, Chen said that he believes a more free
and democratic international community will better contribute to
world peace.
</P>
<P>
In his speech, Chen explained to Palau lawmakers Taiwan's
democratization experience, which he said is recognized
internationally as a "success story."
</P>
<P>
He also praised the people of Palau for their efforts to pursue
independence and democratization.
</P>
<P>
Both Taiwan and Palau are oceanic nations and share common values
of freedom and democracy as well as the same Austronesian culture,
which, he said, constitutes a solid foundation for bilateral
relations.
</P>
<P>
He also thanked Palau for the support and assistance it has
extended to Taiwan in its bids to join the United Nations, the World
Health Organization and other international organizations. "Palau is
a real friend of Taiwan," he said.
</P>
<P>
Chen arrived in Palau from Taipei earlier that day on the first
leg of his two-nation, five-day state visit to two Republic of China
diplomatic allies in the South Pacific. He will also go to the
Solomon Islands.

PREMIER-DESIGNATE UNVEILS IDEAL OF COOPERATION, COEXISTENCE
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Jan.  27 (CNA)
(By Y.F. Low)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Premier-designate Frank Hsieh unveiled
Thursday his philosophy of creating a political environment based on
cooperation and coexistence to make Taiwan a normal, complete and
progressive country.
</P>
<P>
In an article expounding this philosophy, Hsieh pointed out that
the confrontation and struggle between political parties over the
past few years has made many people feel pessimistic about the future
of the country.
</P>
<P>
However, he said he does not feel this way because he believes
the unrest only heralds the advent of an new era in Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
"The disorderly situation in the political arena will not
continue for long. The situation of chaos is telling us that the old
rules of the game are no longer sufficient to guide the situation we
are facing. It's time to create a more sophisticated system using a
new way of thinking to react to this challenge," Hsieh said.
</P>
<P>
Politically, Hsieh said, a "non-zero" model of cooperation and
coexistence must be adopted to replace the old "zero-sum" format.
</P>
<P>
For example, two of the most important political issues in Taiwan
-- domestic party politics and cross-Taiwan Strait relations -- have
both been trapped in a "zero-sum" predicament and require the new
model to break out of the deadlock, Hsieh said.
</P>
<P>
He said the ethnic estrangement and inter-party confrontation
resulting from elections must be put to an end because all 23 million
people of Taiwan share a common destiny, no matter how bitterly they
disagree with each other during elections.
</P>
<P>
It is for this purpose that President Chen Shui-bian proposed in
his Jan. 1 New Year address to create a new situation of stability in
Taiwan through consultation and dialogue, Hsieh noted.
</P>
<P>
Inter-party cooperation, which is unprecedented in Taiwan, must
be based on social trust and conducted in a transparent and open
environment, he went on.
</P>
<P>
Such cooperation should not just be political horsetrading, nor
should any party be asked to renounce its principle platforms as a
condition for cooperation, he said.
</P>
<P>
"I believe political parties can keep their basic platforms and
have no need to give up their basic principles while cooperating with
each other on other aspects, " Hsieh said. "Each party can announce
what they are reserving and what they have agreed upon with each
other, which may include the priority order of policies and
legislation," he added.
</P>
<P>
For the sake of political stability, Hsieh said, the new Cabinet
to be formed Feb. 1 must be one that embraces the philosophy of
cooperation and coexistence and emphasizes the mechanism of
consultation and dialogue.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that non-economic factors such as political
unrest, a lack of social trust and cross-strait tension, are
responsible for most of the problems faced by Taiwan today.
</P>
<P>
To tackle these problems requires a "Cabinet of stability" with
vision, popular support, courage and wisdom, Hsieh said.
</P>
<P>
"'Restoring confidence' will be the approach to be adopted by the
new administrative team to revitalize the economy. As long as the
people's confidence in politics can be restored, investors will have
a positive impression of Taiwan's economic outlook," he said.
</P>
<P>
Hsieh said that as the leader of the administrative team, he will
bear the responsibility to build up the confidence of the people.

SEMICONDUCTOR GIANT FORESEES SLIGHT INDUSTRY DECLINE IN 2005
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Jan. 27 (CNA)

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The world semiconductor industry will post
a slight negative growth this year, but it will noticeably jump again
in 2006, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Corp. (TSMC) Chairman
Morris Chang predicted Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Citing the views of some TSMC customers, Chang estimated that the
global semiconductor industry will shrink by 2 percent in output
value in 2005 after having seen a 28 percent expansion the previous
year.
</P>
<P>
However, Chang forecast that the industry will surge again in
2006 with 10 percent growth in view of a rising appetite for
electronic consumer goods over the long term around the world.
</P>
<P>
According to the TSMC chairman, the industry will fall by 3
percent in the first quarter compared to the Q4 level of last year.
But the market for manufacturing equipment will in turn increase by 3
percent, he added.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on TSMC's strategy to ward off a fierce price war in
the international market, he pointed to "technology, capacity and
custom services" as the company's approach.
</P>
<P>
TSMC spokeswoman Ho Lee-mei reported the same day that the
company will show business decreases in various fields. But she said
that its average sale price (ASP) will maintain stable thanks to an
increase in output of high-end products, and added that the ratio
will continue to increase.
</P>
<P>
According to Ho, the company's capacity utilization rate in the
first quarter will dwindle to 78 percent from 88 percent for the
previous quarter, while its gross revenue rate will contract to 38
percent from 40 percent quarter to quarter.
</P>
<P>
However, she said the company is poised to funnel greater
investment this year into capital spending, which is likely to reach
US$2.5 billion or US$2.7 billion, a rise over last year's US$2.418
billion.
</P>
<P>
TSMC is the world's largest contract chip manufacturer. It was
set up in 1987 and now plays a leading role in the world
semiconductor foundry industry.

TAIWAN SEVERS FORMAL DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS WITH GRENADA
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Jan.  28 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Republic of China on Taiwan severed
formal diplomatic relations with Grenada Friday, the Ministry of
Foreign Affairs (MOFA) reported.
</P>
<P>
The ROC government regrets that the government of Grenada, lured
by financial incentives from the People's Republic of China, has
decided to establish diplomatic ties with mainland China, the MOFA
said in a statement released late Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
"In order to uphold our national interests and dignity, the ROC
government has decided to sever diplomatic relations with Grenada and
cease all aid programs as of today," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
MOFA spokesman Michel Lu said that the ministry has informed
President Chen Shui-bian and Foreign Affairs Minister Tan Sun Chen,
who are now on a state visit to the South Pacific island nation of
Palau, about the latest diplomatic development.
</P>
<P>
Lu said that Taiwan has actively assisted Grenada in various
infrastructure and development projects which have benefited the
general welfare of the country since the two countries established
diplomatic relations July 20, 1989.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Foreign Affairs Tan Sun Chen led in person a Taiwan
relief aid mission to Grenada immediately after the West Indies
country was devastated by Hurricane Ivan last September, Lu noted.
</P>
<P>
During that visit, Minister Chen not only provided US$200,000 in
supplies to Grenada, he also turned a US$1.5 million fund for
infrastructure projects into a disaster-relief fund without any
preconditions. Furthermore, the MOFA granted a substantial part of a
US$8 million package for damage reconstruction work in Grenada, he
added.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, incumbent Prime Minister Keith Mitchell, lacking
foresight, incorrectly believes that by his leaning toward the PRC,
Taiwan can be pressured into significantly increasing its financial
assistance to Grenada, paying that country's national debt on its
behalf, and increasing the Five-Year Cooperation Plan to as high as
US$245 million, Lu quoted the statement as indicating.
</P>
<P>
"Despite the fact that the ROC government considered Grenada's
requests to be insatiable and beyond our capacity, we still made our
best efforts to assist the government of Grenada by way of the
Financial Bail-out Package, the Stadium Expansion Project, and other
major projects. Regrettably, Prime Minister Mitchell still found our
assistance unsatisfactory," Lu said.
</P>
<P>
"The ministry is fully aware that Mitchell has been in contact
with China and has been lured by Beijing, " he said, adding that "we
have done everything possible to dissuade Mitchell from such
behavior, but he has continued to act against our advice."
</P>
<P>
According to the statement, Mitchell visited Beijing to negotiate
issues concerning the establishment of diplomatic ties with China and
even sent a letter to Taipei stating that Grenada intended only to
retain informal relations with Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the MOFA recalled Taiwan's ambassador to Grenada
Dec. 22, 2004, and expressed its most serious protest against
Mitchell.
</P>
<P>
Lu said that Grenada's Foreign Minister Elvin Nimrod and his PRC
counterpart, Li Zhaoxing, signed a joint communique on formal
establishment of diplomatic relations in Beijing Jan. 20.
</P>
<P>
The Grenadan government formally notified the ROC Embassy of the
decision to withdraw its diplomatic recognition of the ROC Jan. 23,
Lu recounted.
</P>
<P>
Lu said that the ROC government regrets Mitchell's lack of
foresight and states sincerely that Taiwan has no intention of
participating in a meaningless game of "dollar diplomacy" with China
and will never let Grenada waver between the two sides of the Taiwan
Strait in order to seek profit.
</P>
<P>
Grenada is the fifth diplomatic ally with which Taiwan has
severed formal relations within the last four years. The other four
countries are Macedonia, Nauru, Liberia and Dominica. According to
official tallies, the number of countries maintaining formal
diplomatic relations with the ROC on Taiwan stands at 26 at present.

LIEN URGES SUPPORT FOR KMT-PFP SPEAKER, VICE SPEAKER CANDIDATES
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Jan. 28 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Lien
Chan on Friday urged all KMT legislators to throw their support
behind the candidates of the KMT and its ally, the People First Party
(PFP), for the Legislative Yuan speakership and vice speakership.
</P>
<P>
Lien made the request after the KMT Central Standing Committee
decided in a meeting earlier in the day to nominate Legislative Yuan
Speaker Wang Jyn-pyng for re-election and to support PFP
legislator-at-large-elect David J. C. Chung in the elections
scheduled for Feb. 1.
</P>
<P>
Lien noted that Wang has served two terms as legislative speaker
and has maintained good relations with all the political parties.
Versed in legislative proceedings, Wang has often coordinated between
the ruling and the opposition parties, contributing to the passage of
various major pieces of legislation, Lien added.
</P>
<P>
As for Chung, Lien said that the candidate for vice speaker has
served as a legislator and as a member of the Control Yuan, the top
watchdog body in Taiwan, making him a broad-based political figure.
</P>
<P>
In addition, as Chung was nominated by the PFP, the KMT has to
give him its support based on cooperation between the two parties.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the speaker and vice speaker elections in the
Legislative Yuan are crucial to the future cooperation between the
two parties in the legislature.
</P>
<P>
To show sincerity in KMT-PFP cooperation, ensure political
stability and live up to the expectations of the KMT and PFP
supporters, Lien said that "all KMT legislators have to toe the party
line and support Wang and Chung."
</P>
<P>
KMT spokesman Chang Jung-kung echoed Lien's words by urging all
legislators to toe the party line, or face the steepest party
discipline.
</P>
<P>
Chang said the KMT and PFP caucuses in the legislature will each
hold meetings Jan. 31, and then the parties will jointly convene a
solidarity meeting with both Lien and PFP Chairman James Soong
attending.
</P>
<P>
Soong is scheduled to return to Taiwan from the United States
Saturday to help cement support for Chung, the PFP said Friday.

<P>
There are no plans to have Ma Yung-chen, a
key aide to President Chen Shui-bian, serve as Presidential Office
deputy secretary-general, sources at the Presidential Office said
Friday.
</P>
<P>
The sources noted that a deputy secretary-general must regularly
answer questions at the Legislative Yuan, and for this reason, the
possibility of Ma serving in that post is minimal.
</P>
<P>
Jo Jung-tai, deputy secretary-general to the president, has been
tapped to serve as a minister without porfolio and Executive
Yuan spokesman.
</P>
<P>
The sources also said President Chen Shui-bian, who is currently
on a state visit to Palau, has only exchanged views with
Premier-designate Frank Hsieh on who should take over as Kaohsiuing
mayor after Hsieh assumes the premiership.
</P>
<P>
Incumbent Executive Yuan spokesman Chen Chi-mai will be acting
Kaohsiung mayor.
</P>
<P>
The sources said the president fully respects Hsieh's right to
form the new Cabinet.
</P>
<P>
Lin Chia-lung, director-general of the Government Information
Office and a member of the president's entourage in Palau, said that
Hsieh will announce the new members of the Cabinet soon. He added 
that Hsieh has been meeting with those members of the previous
Cabinet who will continue to serve in the new Cabinet.
</P>
<P>
Hsieh has said that most of the members of the outgoing Cabinet
will stay on and that there will only be a few changes, according to
Lin.

DPP NAMES KER CHIEN-MING TO RUN FOR LEGISLATIVE SPEAKER
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  Jan.  28 (CNA)

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The legislative caucus of the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) on Friday nominated Legislator Ker
Chien-ming, who is also the party's acting chairman, to run for the
post of legislative speaker.
</P>
<P>
The decision was made in a vote by DPP legislators in which Ker
beat another candidate, Trong Chai, 54 to 16. The caucus also decided
to authorize Ker to select the candidate for vice speaker to make way
for cooperation with other parties.
</P>
<P>
Ker said he will not rule out any possibilities, including giving
up on the bid for the speakership and running for vice speaker
instead. In such a scenario, he continued, the DPP would support a
speaker candidate of another party in exchange for its support for
the DPP's bid for vice speakership.
</P>
<P>
The elections for speaker and vice speaker will be held Feb. 1
after the new legislature is inaugurated.
</P>
<P>
The opposition Kuomintang (KMT) and People First Party (PFP) ,
which together enjoy a slim majority in the legislature, have decided
to jointly support two-term speaker Wang Jin-pyng from the KMT and
PFP Legislator-elect David J.C. Chung for the posts of speaker and
vice speaker, respectively.
</P>
<P>
Ker admitted that his bid for speaker will be an impossible
campaign. He said he hopes that by joining the elections, he can help
change the political environment in the opposition-controlled
Legislative Yuan.
</P>
<P>
Ker said he will seek the support of the opposition Taiwan
Solidarity Union and other individual legislators.
</P>
<P>
DPP Secretary-General Chang Chun-hsiung said the party will make
an all-out effort in campaigning for Ker.
</P>
<P>
Chang said President Chen Shui-bian fully respects the
independent operation of the DPP legislative caucus and will continue
to seek reconciliation with the opposition and promote inter-party
cooperation after the speaker and vice speaker elections.

TWO DOCTORS IMPEACHED FOR NEGLIGENCE IN CHIU CASE
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Jan. 28 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two doctors were impeached under the Civil
Service Law by the Control Yuan Friday for medical negligence in the
case of a 4-year-old patient who was denied treatment at several
Taipei hospitals after sustaining serious brain injuries when she was
brutally beaten by her drunk father.
</P>
<P>
Wu Chen-lung, vice superintendent of Taipei City Hospital (TCH)
and director of the TCH Jen Ai branch, was impeached for negligence
in supervision, said Hsieh Ching-hui, a member of the Control Yuan,
the top watchdog body in Taiwan, at a press conference.
</P>
<P>
Liu Chi-hua, a neurosurgeon with the TCH Jen Ai branch, was
impeached for medical negligence and lying, Hsieh added.
</P>
<P>
The Control Yuan began an investigation into the case Monday
after the 4-year-old patient, surnamed Chiu, was declared brain dead
in a Taichung hospital in central Taiwan Sunday after being in a coma
for two weeks.
</P>
<P>
The ill-fated child fell unconscious after being beaten by her
father on the night of Jan. 10. She was refused admittance to Taipei
City Hospital's Jen Ai branch, and no other city hospital would admit
her during the first crucial hours because there were no beds or
necessary facilities available.
</P>
<P>
The child was eventually taken by ambulance more than 100
kilometers to Taichung for treatment in the early morning hours of
Jan. 11, where she underwent two emergency surgeries. She never awoke
from her coma.
</P>
<P>
Hsieh quoted a Control Yuan investigation report as indicating
that Dr. Liu Chi-hua lied to medical authorities that another
neurosurgeon at the Jen Ai branch, Lin Chih-nan, who was supposed to
be on duty at the time when the child was rushed to Jen Ai Jan. 10,
was in the emergency ward and decided that the child should be
transferred to another hospital because Jen Ai's intensive care unit
ward was already full.
</P>
<P>
Lin Chih-nan later confessed that he had not examined the CAT
scans of the critically-injured child when he insisted on
transferring her to another hospital on the grounds that Jen Ai was
unable to treat the child.
</P>
<P>
Later police investigations showed that Lin wasn't even in the
hospital's ICU ward on the third floor between 2: 05 a.m. and 4: 27
a.m. on Jan. 10 while Chiu was awaiting treatment in the hospital's
emergency ward.
</P>
<P>
Investigators also found that Liu had assisted Lin in making
false statements on the girl's medical records.
</P>
<P>
Liu was impeached while Lin was not because Lin is not a
government employee, Hsieh pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Chiu's father has been arrested on charges of child abuse, while
a number of medical professionals and officials in Taipei have been
disciplined for negligence.
</P>
<P>
Chang Hang, director of the Taipei City Department of Health and
superintendent of Taipei City Hospital, resigned as a result of the
public outcry over the abused child being denied admission to several
hospitals in Taipei in the first crucial hours.
</P>
<P>
The tragedy triggered an uproar which led to judicial
investigations into why the child was refused treatment when there
were sufficient beds in the Taipei hospitals.
</P>
<P>
Chang was not impeached because he had only been serving as
superintendent of Taipei City Hospital for 10 days when the tragedy
occurred, Hsieh said.
</P>
<P>
Chiu's ordeal highlighted the flaws and deficiencies in Taiwan's
medical system and alerted the central and local governments to take
necessary steps to plug the holes, Hsieh added.
</P>
<P>
"We won't let the girl's death be in vain, " Chang said. "We have
worked out 10 measures, including strengthening the hospital transfer
network in the emergency medical system, to prevent a recurrence of
this tragedy."
</P>
<P>
The Cabinet-level Department of Health announced last Friday that
it would make changes to the existing system for patient transfers.
The new system will take effect in June.

PARTIES TO BE HELD AT CKS AIRPORT TO WELCOME MAINLAND CHINA CARRIERS

<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Jan. 28 (CNA)

<TEXT>
<P>
Three cocktail receptions will be held at
Chiang Kai-shek (CKS) International Airport Saturday to welcome the
arrivals of six direct cross-Taiwan Strait charter flights operated
by mainland Chinese carriers, aviation sources said Friday.
</P>
<P>
According to a landmark cross-strait deal reached in Macau Jan.
15, six carriers from each side will operate a total of 48
round-trip, non-stop charter flights during the Jan. 29-Feb. 20
period between Taipei/Kaohsiung in Taiwan and
Shanghai/Beijing/Guangzhou in mainland China to accommodate
home-bound Taiwan businessmen operating on the mainland for the
upcoming Lunar New Year celebrations.
</P>
<P>
China Southern Airlines will be the first mainland carrier to
ever make a landing at CKS Airport, Taiwan's main gateway. Its maiden
charter flight from Guangzhou is scheduled to land at around 10 a.m.
Ten minutes later, a Xiamen Airlines charter plane from Guangzhou
will arrive.
</P>
<P>
China Airlines (CAL) , Taiwan's largest carrier, which has been
commissioned to handle ground services for four mainland carriers,
will host a cocktail reception at the D6 district of the airport's
second terminal to welcome the arrival of the two mainland charter
planes.
</P>
<P>
Han Liang-chung, CAL's public relations division chief, said that
Billy K.C. Chang, director-general of the Civil Aeronautic
Administration (CAA), will be the only government official invited to
attend the welcoming party. The Beijing authorities have been
extremely sensitive about any official contact with Taiwan due to its
"one China" policy. Han said Chang is invited mainly because the CAA
is charge of civil aviation affairs.
</P>
<P>
CAL Chairman Chiang Yao-chung and Chairman Fan Chih-chiang of
TransAsia Airways, which is Xiamen Airlines' ground service agent,
will also attend the reception, Han added.
</P>
<P>
A TransAsia spokesman said the Xiamen Airlines charter flight has
been fully booked by Taiwan businessmen from the Guangzhou and Xiamen
areas. Xiamen Airlines General Manager Wu Rongnan had invited the
presidents of Taiwanese trade associations in Xiamen, Quanzhou and
Zhangzhou cities in the southeastern mainland province of Fujian to
take the airline's maiden charter flight to Taiwan, the spokesman
added.
</P>
<P>
A second cocktail reception is scheduled to take place later to
welcome the arrival of the maiden charter flights of China Eastern
Airlines and Shanghai Airlines from Shanghai. The third welcoming
party will take place shortly afterwards for the arrival of the
maiden flights of Air China and Hainan Airlines from Beijing.

DEVELOPMENT OF OPPOSITION ALLIANCE STILL WORRIES KMT CHAIRMAN
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Jan. 28 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Lien
Chan said Friday that although the "pan-blue alliance" of the KMT and
the People First Party won the legislative elections late last year,
the development of the alliance is still worrying him.
</P>
<P>
Lien made the remarks while hosting a luncheon for more than 80
retired generals, including Hau Pei-tsun, Ho Chi-hao, Wang Ching-hsu,
Liu Ho-chien, Chiang Chung-lin and Hsu Li-nung, prior to Chinese New
Year, which falls on Feb. 9, to express his appreciation for their
years of service.
</P>
<P>
Lien said that 2004 marked a crucial year for the nation,
claiming that the March 20 presidential election, in which President
Chen Shui- bian won re-election by a slim margin, resulted in "grave
consequences" whose reverberations are still being acutely felt.
</P>
<P>
The "pan-blue alliance" filed two separate lawsuits over the
result of the election and the election itself, both of which were
thrown out. The alliance has continued to appeal the cases, despite
having no evidence whatsoever to back their allegations.
</P>
<P>
Lien said that in the Dec. 11, 2004 legislative elections,
although the "pan-blue alliance" was not favored, it managed to keep
a majority of 114 seats in the 225-member legislature. Looking ahead,
however, a lot of people are still disappointed and worried about the
development of the alliance, Lien said.
</P>
<P>
He also said that the KMT must renew itself "to keep in time with
the changing environment and meet the needs of the people," but added
that the party will continue to insist on its fundamental beliefs "to
safeguard the dignity" of the Constitution.
</P>
<P>
Hau, who served as premier under then-President Lee Teng-hui,
said that only Lien can accomplish the integration of the "pan-blue
alliance, " adding that a merger of the opposition force of the KMT,
the PFP and the New Party is the only road for all three parties.

DPP CHAIRMAN BY-ELECTION TO BE HELD SUNDAY

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A by-election for the chairman of the
ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) will be held Sunday and
party officials have been urging DPP members to come out in droves to
vote.
</P>
<P>
Su Tseng-chang, secretary-general of the Presidential Office, is
the sole candidate in the race and has been traveling around the
country over the past few weeks trying to secure votes.

</P>
<P>
He is hoping for a high turnout, noting that Frank Hsieh,
Kaohsiung mayor and premier-designate, registered only around 10
percent of the turnout when he was also a sole candidate in previous
DPP chairman elections.
</P>
<P>
There are 347,000 eligible DPP voters for the chairman election,
sources said.
</P>
<P>
The by-election was made necessary after President Chen Shui-bian
stepped down from his concurrent post as DPP chairman to take
responsibility for the worse-than-expected performance of the party
in the Dec. 11 legislative elections. The DPP garnered 89 seats, far
less than its target of more than 100 seats in the 225-member
legislature.

ACADEMIA SINICA PRODUCES DIGITAL TIME/SPACE ENVIRONMENTS
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Jan. 28 (CNA)

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
History readers have often felt something
is missing or inconsistent when they try to connect historical
characters with their time and space backgrounds, according to
Academia Sinica researchers.
</P>
<P>
Two newly developed digital systems on mainland China and
Taiwan's historical and cultural maps may help address that problem
and will definitely be valuable references for historical and
cultural research, an Academia Sinica researcher said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Academia Sinica's Institute of History and Philology has just
completed the Time/Space Infrastructure of the Chinese Civilization
and the Taiwan Historical and Cultural Map System based on the
knowledge and technology provided by the cutting-edge Geographic
Information System (GIS), said Fan Yi-chun, a deputy researcher with
the institute.
</P>
<P>
The Time/Space Infrastructure of the Chinese Civilization
contains more than 2,000 years of Chinese history expanding from
pre-history to the Ching dynasty, compiled based on the mammoth
electronic archive on Chinese civilization compiled by Academic
Sinica, data on food price structures in the Ching dynasty, a
chorography of the Ming and Ching dynasties, and other historical
data, according to Fan.
</P>
<P>
The Taiwan Historical and Cultural Map System contains basic maps
of Taiwan during the Portuguese, Spanish-colonial era; the era under
the occupation of warlord Cheng Cheng-kung during the Ming dynasty;
the era under Ching imperial governance; the Japanese-colonial era;
and the era after Taiwan was retroceded after 1945, said Fan.
</P>
<P>
The system was compiled based on a Taiwan historical and cultural
map; a digital archive on Taiwan studies; data on maritime and
aerospace navigation in the Taiwan area; a map of Taiwan's fortresses
and military structures; a Taiwan topography and a collection of
place names in Taiwan, Fan added.

ACADEMIA SINICA PRESIDENT CALLS PUBLIC ATTENTION TO POLLUTION PROBLEM
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>

(By Y.F. Low)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Academia Sinica President Lee Yuan-tseh
called public attention Friday to the pollution problem in Taiwan,
which he attributed to urbanization.
</P>
<P>
Lee said tongue-in-cheek that this pollution has contributed to
the successful control of malaria in Taiwan, because the oily
ditchwater in urban areas has made it impossible for mosquito larvae
to survive.
</P>
<P>
Lee made the comments during the presentation of an Academia
Sinica report on the hygiene history of ethnic Chinese societies.
</P>
<P>
According to Academia Sinica historian Liang Chi-tzu, the
Japanese colonial government failed in its attempts to eliminate
malaria in farm villages in eastern Taiwan from 1920 to 1930, but its
subsequent anti-malaria efforts in urban areas along the west coast
were successful.
</P>
<P>
Lee recalled that ditchwater was clear when he was a child, but
has become oily since urbanization began in the late 1960s, leaving
no room for the survival of aquatic life.
</P>
<P>
Liu Shih-yung, another Academia Sinica historian, said
technological improvements and ecological surveys done by the
Japanese colonial government were of great help in the control of
malaria.
</P>
<P>
The Republic of China government followed the anti-malaria
measures in the 1950s after taking power in Taiwan, and malaria was
no longer one of Taiwan's top 10 killers by 1956, Liu said.

ROC, GRENADA SEVER TIES DUE TO INSATIABLE DEMANDS FROM GRENADA: VP
</HEADLINE>

(By Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Vice President Annette Lu said Friday that
Taiwan has been unable to meet the "insatiable demands" of Grenada
Prime Minister Keith Mitchell, which she said led to the severance of
diplomatic relations with the Caribbean country.
</P>
<P>
Lu made the remarks on the sidelines of a trip to a factory
belonging to the I-mei Food Company in Taoyuan, northern Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) announced earlier in the
day that the government had severed formal diplomatic relations with
Grenada Friday as it had decided to establish diplomatic ties with the
People's Republic of China, lured by Beijing's offers of cash and
aid.
</P>
<P>
Lu said that the severance of diplomatic relations highlights the
fact that the mainland is using every possible means to try to
squeeze Taiwan's living space internationally and is using "dollar
diplomacy" to lure allies from Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
She said that Beijing was able to scuttle ROC-Grenada relations
because Taiwan could not meet the "insatiable demands" from Mitchell
and that she felt Beijing's efforts were "shameful."
</P>
<P>
She expressed the hope that Taiwan will increase substantive
exchanges in technology, industry, culture, academia and women's
issues with other nations and not focus simply on counting the number
of its diplomatic allies.
</P>
<P>
However, Taiwan will still try to safeguard its relations with
its allies with the maximum sincerity and goodwill, the vice
president added.
</P>
<P>
Grenada is the fifth diplomatic ally with which Taiwan has
severed formal relations within the last four years. The other four
countries are Macedonia, Nauru, Liberia and Dominica.
</P>
<P>
According to official tallies, the number of countries
maintaining formal diplomatic relations with Taiwan stands at 26.

OVER 600 TO FLY FROM BEIJING TO TAIWAN ON FIRST DAY OF CHARTER FLIGHTS
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
More than 600 Taiwan businessmen and their
dependents have been verified as eligible by the Taiwan Businessmen's
Association in Beijing to take Jan. 29 charter flights home for the
Lunar New Year holiday, a spokesman for the association said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman told CNA that a total of 673 Taiwan businessmen and
their dependents in Beijing have been approved by the association to
board the direct charter flights on the first day of the service,
arranged by Taiwan and mainland China during the holiday period.
</P>
<P>
Some 193 and 185 of them will make the flight on Taiwan-based
China Airlines and EVA Airways, while mainland-based Air China and
Hainan Airlines will carry 141 and 154 passengers, respectively, on
that day, he said.
</P>
<P>
According to aviation companies, the ground-breaking
Taipei-Beijing flight agreement means a lot to them owing to the two
cities' special status, despite the fact that Beijing is not home to
the largest number of Taiwan businessmen operating on the mainland.
</P>
<P>
It would be the very first step toward the opening of full air
links between Taiwan and the mainland, they claimed, adding that
celebrations will be held Jan. 29 at both the Taiwan and Beijing
airports to mark the maiden flights. A total of nine flights will be
provided on the first day of the service.
</P>
<P>
Six aviation companies on either side will provide the service
from Jan. 29-Feb. 20 on a "non-stop, round-trip, multi-destination"
model that was agreed upon in mid-January in Macau by representatives
from the two sides of the Taiwan Strait.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan's Kaohsiung and mainland China's Beijing and Guangzhou are
new additions to the direct services, marking a difference from the
first time the flights were offered in 2003, when they were operated
only by Taiwan airlines on the Taipei-Shanghai route via Hong Kong or
Macau.
</P>
<P>
The landmark deal will allow mainland airlines to land in Taiwan
for the first time in more than 55 years since 1949, when direct
transport, trade and postal links were severed in the wake of a civil
war.
</P>
<P>
The service was aborted in 2004 as a result of Beijing's
reluctance to talk with Taiwan over its demand that mainland carriers
also be permitted to take part.

death camp, President Vladimir Putin acknowledged Thursday that
anti-Semitism and xenophobia had surfaced in Russia, tackling an
issue that the Kremlin had long failed to confront directly.

ACID RAIN STILL PRESENT IN NORTHERN TAIWAN
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Jan. 28 (CNA)
(By Y.F. Low)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Up to 70 percent of the rain that falls in
northern Taiwan is acidic, with its acidity equaling that of soda
water or tomato juice, according to a report released recently by the
Environmental Protection Administration (EPA).
</P>
<P>
The survey was conducted by the National Central University (NCU)
at the EPA's commission. It is based on data gathered since 1990
through a national acid-rain monitoring network.
</P>
<P>
The survey found that the acid content of rain falling in major
urban areas such as Taipei, Kaohsiung and Chungli fell after
surcharges were imposed on the purchase of materials that contributed
to pollution, such as gasoline and coal. However, the rain is still
somewhat acidic.
</P>
<P>
Ho Shun-chin, chief of the EPA's Department of Air Quality
Protection and Noise Control, said sulfur oxide and nitrogen oxide in
urban rainwater have dropped only slightly, with the pH level of
rainwater standing at 4.91 in Taipei, 4.61 in Chungli and 4.86 in
Kaohsiung.
</P>
<P>
Acids have pH values under 7, and alkalis have pH values over 7.
If a substance has a pH value of 7, it is neutral -- neither acidic
nor alkaline. The pH scale is logarithmic so a one digit change
represents a 10-times difference.
</P>
<P>
Normal rain has a pH of about 5.6. This is because naturally
present carbon dioxide from the Earth's atmosphere dissolves in the
rain to form carbonic acid.
</P>
<P>
It was found that more than 50 percent of the pollutants that
caused acid rain were from mainland China, and the content of sulfur
oxide in rainwater in autumn and winter -- the season of northeast
winds -- is double that of rainwater in summer.
</P>
<P>
Lin Neng-huei, head of NCU's Department of Atmospheric Sciences,
said Taiwan's efforts to reduce sulfur oxide emissions, such as the
use of surcharges and requiring the use of low-sulfur fuel oil, have
not lead to significant improvement in the acid rain problem mainly
because the pollutants come from the mainland.
</P>
<P>
Lin pointed out that sulfur oxide emissions on the mainland are
increasing year after year owing to its rapid economic development,
and he proposed that Taiwan and the mainland set up a platform for
sharing data to tackle the problem.
</P>
<P>
Although acid rain does no immediate harm to humans and the
environment, it can erode metals and cause sickness in trees over a
long period of time, Lin said.
</P>
<P>
People with allergies should also limit their exposure to rain,
which may cause allergic skin reactions and loss of hair, he added.

TAIWAN PAID US$36 PER BARREL OF OIL ON AVERAGE IN 2004: DGBAS
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Jan. 28 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taiwan paid US$36 a barrel on average for
imported crude oil last year, a jump of 28.1 percent over the 2003
average, according to the newest government statistics.
</P>
<P>
The international price of oil peaked in October last year, with
per-barrel prices averaging an historic high of US$45.4 before
falling back to US$35.9 in December, the tallies compiled by the
Cabinet-level Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and
Statistics (DGBAS) showed.
</P>
<P>
Fanned by tensions in the Middle East and a political crisis in
Nigeria, as well as strong demand from Brazil, India, mainland China
and Russia and a cooler than expected winter, high oil prices have
showed no signs of abating in the world market, DGBAS officials said.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, prices for raw and industrial materials also
surged in 2004, the third consecutive year of increases, putting
heavy pressure on government finances, they said.
</P>
<P>
On average, prices of import products increased by 11.8 percent
in U.S. dollar terms for Taiwan last year, they pointed out, noting
that the country relied heavily on imports for prime materials and
farm goods -- 70 percent of all such inbound shipments.

PREMIER-DESIGNATE GATHERS NEW CABINET FOR PEP TALK
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Jan.  29 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Premier-designate Frank Hsieh hosted an
informal meeting Friday with members of his Cabinet to be inaugurated
Feb. 1.
</P>
<P>
Except for those who will definitely leave their current posts or
are on official duties abroad, nearly all incumbent Cabinet members
attended the tea party hosted by Hsieh at the Civil Service
Development Institute in Taipei.
</P>
<P>
Hsieh said the incoming Cabinet's top priority for now is to see
to it that the people have a happy and safe Chinese New Year holiday.
The Lunar New Year Day falls on Feb. 9.
</P>
<P>
"I hope all Cabinet members can present concrete measures at the
Feb. 1 provisional Cabinet meeting to make local people feel that the
government has new initiatives and a new vision," the popular
mayor of the southern port city of Kaohsiung said.
</P>
<P>
In the future, Hsieh said, the government will set a new theme
for each year to guide national development; for example, a "year for
health."
</P>
<P>
"Designating a development theme each year will focus our
energies in a set direction," Hsieh explained.
</P>
<P>
Hsieh further said that all central government departments should
never distance themselves from the common people and should instead
strengthen communications to help them understand the nature of major
public policies.
</P>
<P>
"Various governmental agencies should also reinforce
inter-department coordination and boost dialogue with the Legislative
Yuan and the public so that the Cabinet's policy initiatives will
have sufficient backing," said Hsieh, himself a skillful negotiator
and communicator.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Hsieh said, all Cabinet members must attach great
importance to the sentiments of the people.
</P>
<P>
"The way people feel should be a critical index in weighing
policy goals. Whenever a policy or measure gets a bad response from
the public, we should immediately review the plan and make necessary
improvements," he added.
</P>
<P>
Noting that many incumbent Cabinet members took office only last
May, Hsieh said he will give them at least six more months to
implement their ideals and initiatives.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, Hsieh said, the Cabinet will undergo only minor
adjustments. "I know every individual has his or her own character
and taste. I want to give all of you at least six more months for us
to adapt to each other and to see if we have shared values and
opinions, " Hsieh said, adding that he hopes all of his Cabinet
members will speak freely with each other, work as a team and take
pride in their jobs.
</P>
<P>
Incumbent Vice Minister of Justice Shih Mao-lin, who has been
tapped as the new minister of justice, was the only would-be Cabinet
newcomer to be present at the tea party, while
Minister-without-Portfolio Lin Yi-fu was the only incumbent member
who didn't receive an invitation because he reportedly would be
assigned to another post.
</P>
<P>
Also absent were outgoing Minister of Justice Chen Ding-nan, who
will return to his home county of Ilan to run for magistrate late
this year; Central Personnel Administration Director-General Lee
Yi-yang, who will soon become secretary-general of the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP); and Department of Health Minister
Chen Chien-jen who will return to his teaching post at National
Taiwan University.
</P>
<P>
Three officials who didn't attend Hsieh's tea party due to
official duties were Mainland Affairs Council Chairman Joseph Wu, who
was busy drawing up a response as mainland China marks the 10th
anniversary of Jiang Zemin's "Eight Points" speech on cross-Taiwan
Strait relations Jan. 31; as well as Minister of Foreign Affairs Tan
Sun Chen and Government Information Office Director-General Lin
Chia-lung, both of whom are accompanying President Chen Shui-bian on
a visit to the South Pacific island nation of Palau. The three
officials will remain at their current posts.
</P>
<P>
Notably present was Council of Labor Affairs Chairwoman Chen Chu
who was once regarded as a candidate for vice premier, but she told
the media earlier in the day that she will stay at her present post.
</P>
<P>
Who will be the new vice premier, Executive Yuan
secretary-general, personnel chief and health chief remains
uncertain.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, DPP Secretary-General Lee Ying-yuan said
Hsieh has invited him to join the new Cabinet to serve as Executive
Yuan secretary-general, a post that Lee held before he was drafted by
the DPP to run for Taipei City mayor in 2002. As Lee is now busy with
the DPP's Jan. 30 party chairman by-election, Hsieh will not announce
Lee's return to the Executive Yuan secretary-general post until Jan.
31.

EPA HEAD MIFFED AT TAIWAN'S DISMAL RATING IN ENVIRONMENT, PASSES BLAME
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,   Jan.   28  (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taiwan's Environmental Protection
Administration (EPA) chief Friday blamed the nation's inability to
participate in international activities for the poor showing in
environmental sustainability as rated by several organizations
working for the World Economic Forum (WEF).
</P>
<P>
Taiwan ranked 145th out of 146 nations, only ahead of North Korea
on the 2005 Environmental Sustainability Index (ESI) survey, which
was unveiled by the WEF earlier the same day. Finland, Norway and
Uruguay were the top three performers. The United States was in 45th
place, ahead of Britain in 66th and Japan in 78th.
</P>
<P>
While acknowledging that many serious problems have arisen from
Taiwan's large population, Chang Juu-en, head of the Cabinet-level
EPA, blamed Taiwan's absence in most international organizations and
global pacts for its low ranking.
</P>
<P>
Chang claimed that the rating organizations did not have access
to up-to-date information on Taiwan and if they had, the island would
have rated better.
</P>
<P>
However, he promised to do his best to improve Taiwan's
environment and said that Taiwan's rating in the survey will serve as
a valuable reference.
</P>
<P>
EPA officials also complained that the poll result was extremely
unfair to Taiwan and said that the country is relatively strong in
environmental sustainability compared to neighboring countries.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan helped Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Thailand and
Vietnam in devising criteria and methodology to examine and measure
their environments based on a set of "pressure, state and response"
mechanisms, they said.
</P>
<P>
The 146-nation poll was jointed worked out by the WEF, the Yale
Center for Environmental Law and Policy, the Global Leaders for
Tomorrow Environment Task Force and the Center for International
Earth Science Information Network.
</P>
<P>
It examined 22 major factors that contribute to environmental
performance and results, such as urban air quality, overall public
health and pollution control.

PRESIDENT CHEN HAILS LAUNCH OF CROSS-STRAIT HOLIDAY CHARTER FLIGHTS
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Palau, Jan.  28 (CNA)
(By S. J. Tsai and Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President Chen Shui-bian in Palau Friday
hailed the imminent launch of special two-way, non-stop charter
flights across the Taiwan Strait, saying that the flights mark a step
forward in cross-strait reconciliation and rapprochement.
</P>
<P>
Chen, who is currently on a state visit to the South Pacific
island nation, made the remarks in an interview with Japan's Fuji TV
and Kyodo News Agency.
</P>
<P>
His statements came a day before six direct cross-strait charter
flights operated by mainland Chinese carriers are scheduled to land
at Chiang Kai-shek International Airport, Taiwan's main gateway.
</P>
<P>
According to a landmark cross-strait deal reached in Macau Jan.
15, six carriers from each side will operate a total of 48
round-trip, non-stop charter flights during the Jan. 29 to Feb. 20
period between Taipei/Kaohsiung in Taiwan and
Shanghai/Beijing/Guangzhou in mainland China to accommodate homeward
bound Taiwan businessmen operating on the mainland for the upcoming
Chinese New Year celebrations.
</P>
<P>
Chen said the special holiday charter flight deal indicates that
so long as the two sides of the Taiwan Strait are sincere and are
willing to sit down to talk, they can certainly break some of the
obstacles standing in their way.
</P>
<P>
Even though the holiday charter flights do not necessarily signal
the establishment of full-fledged cross-strait air links, Chen said
they at least mark a good start for a thaw in the long-deadlocked
bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
The takeoff of the special holiday charter flights also indicates
that the two sides can definitely find ways around their differences
so long as they can shelve political disputes and ideological
differences, Chen said.
</P>
<P>
This time around, charter planes from both sides must detour and
fly over Hong Kong airspace because of Beijing's political
considerations that the flights not be regarded as international
ones.
</P>
<P>
In the future, Chen said, he hopes that regular cross-strait
cargo charter flights and passenger charter flights can be launched
and can be allowed to fly over Seoul and Okinawa airspace to save
fuel costs and time. For instance, he said, Taiwan-Beijing charter
flights could fly through Seoul airspace and Taiwan-Shanghai charter
flights through Okinawa airspace.
</P>
<P>
Chen is the first Republic of China president ever to visit any
South Pacific ally. He will also visit the Solomon Islands after his
two-day Palau state visit.

National Taiwan University (NTU) President
Chen Wei-chao conferred an honorary doctorate on Gao Xingjian, winner
of the 2000 Nobel Prize in literature, at the University of Provence
in southern France Friday.
</P>
<P>
The presentation ceremony took place before an international
seminar on Gao's literary achievements at the university.
</P>
<P>
Gao said it was a great honor to receive the honorary degree from
Taiwan's top-notch university.
</P>
<P>
Gao, who was born in mainland China's Jiangxi Province in 1940,
left the mainland in 1987 and settled a year later in France as a
political refugee. He has been to Taiwan on several occasions. In
2002, an opera written by him in collaboration with mainland composer
Xu Shuya, "Snow in August," was premiered in Taipei to rave reviews.
</P>
<P>
Gao said his books have been banned in mainland China. "I didn't
have motherland. But I'm fortunate to have many friends in Taiwan
and France. Their support and assistance have help had my books
published in many countries in many languages. I'm very grateful for
this true friendship," an emotional Gao said at the ceremony.

BEIJING URGED TO DEAL WITH CROSS-STRAIT TIES WITH NEW CONCEPT
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Jan.  28 (CNA)
(By Huang Kwang-chun)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Beijing should deal with cross-Taiwan
Strait relations with a new concept and set aside fetters imposed by
former mainland Chinese President Jiang Zemin's eight-point proposal,
Taiwan's top mainland policy planner suggested Friday.
</P>
<P>
Joseph Wu, chairman of the Cabinet-level Mainland Affairs
Council, said that this year will be crucial to the development of
cross-strait ties, given that the internal situations of the United
States, mainland China and Taiwan have been relatively stable in
comparison with those of last year where there were presidential
elections and legislative elections in Taiwan and the U.S. and a
transfer of power in the mainland.
</P>
<P>
Wu blamed poor understanding or negligence of Taiwan for the
criticisms made by Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference
Chairman Jia Qinglin earlier that day on Taiwan's constitutional
reforms, although he declined to comment on Jia's remarks marking the
10th anniversary of Jiang's policy proposal on unification with
Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
It is an error and a misunderstanding to see Taiwan's
constitutional reforms as activities to seek Taiwan's independence,
he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Beijing should do more to learn of Taiwan's democratic
development and what the people of Taiwan want, Wu suggested, adding
that Beijing should seriously consider a proposal he initiated for
sending scholars from either side to be stationed on each side.
</P>
<P>
No responsible government or political party in Taiwan will
accept the "one China" principle authored by Beijing, he added.
</P>
<P>
Wu said, however, the government of Taiwan will continue to seek
acceptable ways and means by which the two sides of the Taiwan Strait
can lay the a foundation for resuming the long-stalled cross-strait
dialogue.

: The Straits Times: Bird flu alert
stepped up.

Singapore is on bird flu alert. New cases of poultry infections
in the region have prompted food safety authorities here this week to
intensify their checks on farms and poultry imports at border
checkpoints.

They have also heightened the alert level up a notch to Code
Orange, just below full-danger Code Red when all birds will be culled
and a ban imposed on imports from risky countries.

But even their best efforts are no match once the H5N1 virus
makes the jump and transmits easily from human to human, a mutation
that can unleash an attack more forceful than even Sars.

</P>
<P>
While building positive relations between the two sides of the

CROSS-STRAIT LUNAR NEW YEAR CHARTER FLIGHTS KICK OFF
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei, Jan. 29 (CNA)
(By Y.F. Low)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Special cross-strait Lunar New Year charter
flights were launched Saturday to carry mainland China-based
Taiwanese businesspeople and their families home for the holidays,
marking the first time in 56 years that civilian aircraft from the
mainland have been allowed to land in Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Unlike the previous Lunar New Year charter flight services in
2003, which were operated solely by Taiwanese airlines between
Shanghai and Taipei/Kaohsiung via Hong Kong/Macau, this year's
services are being jointly operated by a total of 12 air carriers
from Taiwan and China, with flights between
Beijing/Shanghai/Guangzhou and Taipei/Kaohsiung.
</P>
<P>
The flights, arranged for the Jan. 29-Feb. 20 period, are not
required to land in a third location en route this time around,
although they still need to detour over Hong Kong's air space.
</P>
<P>
On the first day of the charter services, a total of nine flights
were offered by eight air carriers from the two sides of the Taiwan
Strait for more than 2,000 passengers.
</P>
<P>
The six mainland airlines joining the landmark services Saturday
included China Southern Airlines, Xiamen Airlines, Air China,
Shanghai Airlines, Hainan Airlines and China Eastern Airlines. The
Taiwanese carriers involved were China Airlines and EVA Airways.
</P>
<P>
The first flight operated by China Southern Airlines from
Guangzhou arrived at Taoyuan's Chiang Kai-shek International Airport
at around 9: 25 a.m. with 234 passengers. It was followed by another
by Xiamen Airlines, also from Guangzhou, which arrived 15 minutes
later with 189 passengers.
</P>
<P>
At a welcome ceremony held at the airport, Civil Aeronautics
Administration Director-General Billy K.C. Chang said he feels very
excited to be able to witness this historic moment.
</P>
<P>
Chang said that the launch of this year's charter services has
laid a solid foundation for cross-strait civil aviation exchanges and
that he believes regular passenger services will open across the
strait very soon.
</P>
<P>
Also attending the ceremony were Mainland Affairs Council Vice
Chairman Chiu Tai-san, Vice Minister of Transportation and
Communications Tsai Duei and Vice Minister of Economic Affairs Chen
Ruey-long.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, two flights operated by Taiwan's China Airlines and
EVA Airways arrived at Beijing from Taipei at 12: 20 p.m. and 12: 50
p.m., respectively, carrying a total of 451 passengers.
</P>
<P>
According to the airlines, the flight from Taipei to Beijing
takes only four hours and 20 minutes, which is at least two hours
faster than a flight with a stopover in Hong Kong or Macau.
</P>
<P>
Direct cross-strait transportation links were suspended since
1949 after a civil war in China.

of attracting major investment projects totalling NT$849 billion
(US$26.69 billion) for 2005, Chen Chao-yih, the bureau director, said

<P>
The third round of talks between Taiwan and
Nicaragua on a proposed free trade agreement (FTA) is slated to kick
off Jan. 30 in Miami, Florida, Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA)
officials said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The Taiwan delegation will be headed by Deputy Minister of
Economic Affairs Chen Ruey-long and will include officials from the
Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Justice, Council of Agriculture,
MOEA Industrial Development Bureau, and MOEA Bureau of Foreign Trade.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, which will run through Feb. 4, will center on the
topics of market access regulations and procedures, investment, and
the service industry, according to the MOEA.
</P>
<P>
The two sides are expected to reach consensus on the formation of
detailed articles of the proposed agreement during the Miami talks, a
MOEA official suggested, adding that they are expected to begin the
legal review of the planned accord.
</P>
<P>
The two sides are also expected to focus more on issues
concerning tariff reductions for agricultural and industrial
products, a list of products to benefit from market opening, and
regulations on product designations, the official said.
</P>
<P>
In light of the fact that bilateral trade between Taiwan and
Panama grew by 112 percent for the year after the Taiwan-Panama FTA
came into effect Jan. 1, 2004, it has believed that an FTA between
Taiwan and Nicaragua will significantly boost bilateral trade between
the two countries, MOEA officials said. They added that the ministry
also hopes the signing of an FTA will increase economic and
investment relations between the two countries.

TAIWAN SHOULD NOT LET DOWN GUARD AGAINST MAINLAND CHINA: VP

<TEXT>
<P>
Taiwan should not let down its guard
against mainland China despite the inauguration of special
cross-strait Chinese New Year charter flights, Vice President Annette
Lu said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Lu made the remarks while answering questions from reporters
after attending the opening of a special Chinese New Year bazaar at
the Pinchiang Market in Taipei City.
</P>
<P>
Stressing that Taiwan must not let down its guard against
mainland China, Lu called Beijing the biggest obstacle in Taiwan's
efforts to enter international organizations. She urged the public to
be fully aware of Beijing's plots.
</P>
<P>
The vice president said Beijing is apparently using the "carrot
and stick" approach by to try to entice the Taiwan people with the
special charter flights while at the same time seeking to obstruct
Taiwan on the diplomatic front, as evidenced by the fact that Grenada
shifted its diplomatic recognition from Taipei to Beijing Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Grenada had maintained formal diplomatic relations with Taiwan
since 1988.
</P>
<P>
If Beijing were truly friendly toward Taiwan, it would not block
Taiwan's bid to join the United Nations and would help Taiwan join
the World Health Organization, Lu said.
</P>
<P>
Should Beijing take the initiative by dismantling its missiles
aimed at Taiwan, then the Taiwan government will also be willing to
review many policies related to mainland China, she added.

PASSENGER NUMBERS UP ON XIAMEN-KINMEN FERRY SERVICE
</HEADLINE>

(By Maubo Chang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Passenger numbers on the ferry service
between Taiwan's frontline island of Kinmen and the mainland Chinese
port of Xiamen were up Saturday despite the kick off of special
cross-strait Lunar New Year charter flights the same day, according
to a Kinmen County Government official.
</P>
<P>
Lin Cheng-cha, director of Kinmen's Transportation and Tourism
Bureau, said a total of 462 mainland-based Taiwanese businesspeople
arrived in Kinmen aboard two ferries Saturday before flying on to
Taiwan, marking a single day high for the year.
</P>
<P>
With the approach of the Chinese New Year, Lin predicted that
passenger numbers will continue to increase as more and more
Taiwanese businesspeople head back home for the holidays via Kinmen.
</P>
<P>
The ferry service was inaugurated four years ago to facilitate
Taiwan businesspeople traveling between Taiwan and the mainland in
the absence of direct cross-strait flight services. The service
seemed unaffected by the launch of the special cross-strait charter
flights Saturday.
</P>
<P>
A Taiwan businessman, surnamed Liu, told CNA at the pier at
Shuitou, Kinmen that the charter flights don't extend to Xiamen where
some 300,000 Taiwan businesspeople are based. For these individuals,
traveling via Kinmen is still the most convenient way to return to
Taiwan, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Liu, who comes from Taichung, central Taiwan, said the Kinmen
route is quicker than flying from Fuzhou, Fujian Province to
Guangzhou in Guangdong Province before boarding one of the special
charter flights to Taoyuan or Kaohsiung in Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
"The Xiamen-Kinmen route is irreplaceable for Taiwanese operating
in Fujian." he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Lin said there are currently four round trips offered
per day on the ferry route between Kinmen and Xiamen, with the number
to increase to six round trips Feb. 1, with a total capacity of 3,216
passengers per day.
</P>
<P>
He estimated that more than 30,000 passengers will use the ferry
service before the Chinese New Year holidays end Feb. 18.

<P>
Mainland Chinese pilots who flew landmark
Lunar New Year charter flights to Taiwan on Saturday could hardly
contain their excitement and joy at being able to take part in the
services.
</P>
<P>
Seven charter flights operated by six mainland carriers arrived
in Taipei/Kaohsiung from Beijing/Shanghai/Guangzhou on the first day
of the charter services, carrying about 1,700 Taiwanese passengers
home for the holidays. They were the first mainland civilian aircraft
to be allowed to land in Taiwan in 56 years.
</P>
<P>
Hao Jianhua, captain of the China Southern Airlines flight from
Guangzhou to Taipei -- the earliest among the seven flights to arrive
in Taiwan -- waved excitedly from the cockpit to reporters waiting at
Taoyuan's Chiang Kai-shek International Airport soon after landing.
</P>
<P>
Hao said he is very happy about his first trip to Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Song Chengren, captain of the Xiamen Airlines flight, also from
Gaungzhou, which arrived at the airport second, said the flight to
Taiwan has fulfilled his long-time dream in his 44-year career as a
pilot.
</P>
<P>
However, Song said he feels some regret for not being able to
enjoy the view over Taipei because of poor visibility during the
flight.
</P>
<P>
Xiamen Airlines general manager Wu Rongnan, who had visited
Taiwan twice in the past, joined the Taiwanese passengers on the
flight to Taipei.
</P>
<P>
Wu said that he had hoped to do something to promote the opening
of direct transportation links across the Taiwan Strait 20 years ago
and that the launch of this year's charter services is a good start
that will be helpful in pushing for a launch of regular cross-strait
passenger services in the future.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the mainland-based Taiwanese businesspeople who took
the first-day flights home also expressed their hope that direct
cross-strait air and shipping links will be opened soon to facilitate
their transportation needs.
</P>
<P>
In Shanghai, Vice Mayor Tang Dengjie agreed that the availability
of a convenient means of transportation is very important in light of
the frequent exchanges between people from the two sides.
</P>
<P>
While more than 300,000 Taiwanese now live in Shanghai and its
neighboring areas, Taiwanese made more than 1.32 million trips to
Shanghai in 2004 alone, according to Tang.
</P>
<P>
The number of investment projects made by Taiwanese in Shanghai
totals 5,440 to date, he said.

Opposition People First Party (PFP)
Chairman James Soong returned to Taiwan Saturday from the United
States ahead of the Feb. 1 elections for legislative speaker and vice
speaker.
</P>
<P>
On behalf of opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Lien Chan,
Legislative Yuan speaker Wang Jin-pyng and Taipei Mayor Ying-jeou,
who are both vice chairmen of the party, welcomed Soong at Chiang
Kai-shek International Airport upon his arrival.
</P>
<P>
Wang said the gesture was aimed at displaying the KMT's sincerity
in cooperating with the PFP in the speaker and vice speaker
elections.
</P>
<P>
Wang added that he hopes Lien and Soong will jointly campaign for
the two parties' candidates to boost their chances of victory, but he
denied any knowledge of when the two leaders will meet to discuss
details about the elections.
</P>
<P>
The KMT and PFP, which together enjoy a slim majority in the
legislature, have decided to jointly support Wang and PFP
Legislator-elect David J.C. Chung to run for speaker and vice
speaker, respectively.
</P>
<P>
In an effort to secure support for Wang and Chung, the KMT has
also decided to discipline any of its legislators who don't toe the
party line and vote for other candidates.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Soong denied reports suggesting that he had met with
some ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) politicians during his
stay in the United States and had reached a deal with the DPP on
inter-party cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Soong said he did not meet with any KMT representatives, either,
and that he only met some U.S. officials and members of major think
tanks.
</P>
<P>
The PFP chairman said that after some serious contemplation, he
has come to realize that reconciliation is needed in Taiwan in terms
of its relations with mainland China as well as among different
ethnic groups and political parties.
</P>
<P>
Soong said the PFP will play the role of balancer to push the DPP
to change its pro-independence position and in order to assist the
KMT in reforming itself, adding that the PFP rejects any form of
inter-party cooperation that is based on horse trading.

CHINA NEEDS NEW APPROACH TO BREAK CROSS-STRAIT IMPASSE: MAC

<TEXT>
<P>
Mainland China can hardly expect any
progress in its relations with Taiwan if it continues to adhere to
its out-of-date approach and political ideas without heeding public
opinion in Taiwan, according to a statement issued by the Mainland
Affairs Council.
</P>
<P>
In a response to remarks made by Jia Qinglin, chairman of the
Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, in Beijing the
previous day, the statement said Beijing has not revamped its Taiwan
policy which is based on its "one country, two systems" formula for
reuniting with Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Although Taiwan has persistently pursued peace and stability in
its relations with China, these goals are unattainable unless Beijing
gives Taiwan its due respect and does not deny its existence, the
statement said.
</P>
<P>
The "one Country, two systems" formula has never won the
endorsement of Taiwan people, and the policy based on this formula is
doomed to fail, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, the statement said, Beijing's attempts to bring
Taiwan back into its fold by enacting an anti-secession law has
seriously worsened its ties with Taiwan and has caused considerable
concern in the international community despite its efforts to play
down the bill's significance.
</P>
<P>
China's attempts to justify a possible invasion of Taiwan with
this anti-secession bill will only aggravate the confrontation
between Taiwan and China, alter the status quo across the Taiwan
Strait, threaten the stability of the region and make any improvement
in bilateral ties impossible, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The statement rebutted Jia's claims that Taiwan's efforts to
amend its Constitution is a bid to seek de jure independence for the
island, saying that Taiwan's political reform is aimed at sharpening
the country's competitiveness and that it has won the international
community's admiration.
</P>
<P>
Beijing has only exposed its ignorance of democracy by it's
criticism, the statement claimed.

CHARTER FLIGHTS HELPFUL TO CROSS-STRAIT RELATIONS: MAC OFFICIAL
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Jan.  29  (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) Vice
Chairman Chiu Tai-san on Saturday hailed the special Lunar New Year
charter flights between Taiwan and mainland China which kicked off
the same day, voicing the hope that the services will help pave the
way for improvement in cross-strait ties in other areas.
</P>
<P>
Chiu made the remarks while giving a speech in a ceremony at
Chiang Kai-shek International Airport to welcome arriving Taiwan
business people and their families on board the homebound flights
from the mainland on the first day of the service that will run
through Feb. 20.
</P>
<P>
Legislators and government officials, including Vice Minister of
Transportation and Communications Tsai Duei and Vice Minister of
Economic Affairs Chen Ruey-long, were also present on the occasion to
witness the historic first landings on Taiwan soil of mainland
aircraft in more than 55 years.
</P>
<P>
Chiu said that the government keenly hopes that the flight
services will help set a precedence for bilateral talks in other
areas in the future.
</P>
<P>
The successful launch of the flights means that Taiwan and
mainland China could brush aside their political disputes and engage
in mutually beneficial negotiations based on parity and respect, he
said.
</P>
<P>
The MAC vice chairman said that the government hopes to see major
breakthroughs in Taiwan-mainland relations this year and that it is
looking forward to promoting broader cross-strait exchanges.
</P>
<P>
He voiced his expectation that the charter flight services will
not turn out to be an isolated case of cooperation and called for
concrete measures by the two sides to build on this success.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, more than 2,000 Taiwan business people and their
families took the charter flights on the first day of the service,
with Taiwan-bound passengers well outnumbering those bound for the
mainland.
</P>
<P>
The flight services are only being provided for Taiwan business
people and their dependents, whose status must first be verified by
Taiwan businessmen's associations in mainland China.
</P>
<P>
Returning Taiwan business people and their families expressed
satisfaction with the implementation of the charter flights in terms
of enabling them to save time and money. They urged the government to
implement charter flight services for other major holidays, such as
the Dragon Boat Festival and the Mid-Autumn Festival.
</P>
<P>
Representatives from Taiwan and the mainland reached the
ground-breaking agreement on the Lunar New Year holiday flights
earlier this month in Macau, allowing six airlines from each side to
participate in offering the services between the Taiwan cities of
Taipei and Kaohsiung and the mainland cities of Beijing, Shanghai and
Guangzhou.
</P>
<P>
It marks a sharp departure from the charter service in 2003, when
the flights were run only by Taiwan aviation companies which had to
fly via Hong Kong or Macau.
</P>
<P>
The charter flights were aborted the next year due to the
mainland's refusal to talk with Taiwan over its demand that mainland
carriers also be included in the service.

ACTIVISTS URGE GOVERNMENT TO LEARN FROM LOW RANKING IN ESI SURVEY

Taipei, Jan. 29 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)

<TEXT>
<P>
Taiwan should learn something positive from
its low ranking in a recent Environmental Sustainability Index (ESI)
survey, and the government should call a meeting to review its
policy, eco-friendly activists said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Chen Shu-hua, head of the Taiwan Environment Protection Alliance,
called on the government to call a meeting as soon as possible to
revamp its policies regarding recycling, nuclear power and
alternative energies.
</P>
<P>
Although Taiwan is not able to take part in international
activities and global pacts affiliated with the United Nations, the
country can still contribute to environmental protection and
conservation through non-governmental organizations, Chen said.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan's poor showing in the poll may be discouraging, but the
government should use outside criticism as a valuable reference to
make concrete improvements, she said.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan ranked 145th out of 146 nations in the ESI survey carried
out jointly by the World Economic Forum and other agencies. The
survey results were made public on Friday, with Finland ranking at
the top of the list and North Korea at the bottom.
</P>
<P>
Environmental Protection Administration officials ascribed
Taiwan's poor performance to the country's inability to participate
in international affairs, though they also acknowledged that many
serious problems have arisen from Taiwan's large population and that
there is an urgent need to make improvements.

World peace and
prosperity should be based on freedom, democracy, and respect for
human rights and pluralism, Republic of China President Chen
Shui-bian said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a state banquet hosted by Governor General of the
Solomon Islands Nathaniel Waena in his honor, Chen said that the ROC

development with the Solomon Islands and to play an active and
constructive role in the South Pacific nation's development.
</P>
<P>
Chen said that he is proud to be the first ROC president to visit
the Solomon Islands, adding that his visit marks the beginning of a
new era in the development of ties between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The ROC-Solomon Islands relationship is based on the principles
of equality, reciprocity, mutual respect, freedom and peace, for
which the two nations have established a lasting friendship, Chen
noted.
</P>
<P>
In response, Waena praised the ROC's achievements in economic and
political development.
</P>
<P>
He said that Taiwan has every right to join international
organizations and that the Solomon Islands will continue to support
Taiwan's bids.
</P>
<P>
He also thanked Chen for the assistance the ROC has extended to
the Solomon Islands and expressed the hope that the bilateral ties
will be further strengthened.
</P>
<P>
Chen arrived in Honiara, the capital of the Solomon Islands,
earlier in the day for a three-day state visit.
</P>
<P>
Chen was warmly greeted at the airport by Waena, Prime Minister
Allan Kemakeza and other top officials of the South Pacific nation.
</P>
<P>
The Solomon Islands is the final leg of Chen's official visit to
two ROC diplomatic allies in the South Pacific region which has also
taken him to Palau.

TAIWAN WILL CONTINUE TO AMEND TIES WITH PRC: PRESIDENT
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Honiara,  the Solomon Islands,  Jan.  30 (CNA)
(By S.J. Tsai and Deborah Kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Republic of China
President Chen Shui-bian said here Sunday that Taiwan will continue
to hold out olive branches to mainland China even though Beijing has
made no effort to improve cross-Taiwan Strait relations over the past
decade.
</P>
<P>
Chen said that the Beijing leadership has not tried to resolve
cross-strait differences over the past 10 years but has rather
widened the distance between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
He said Beijing's behavior has been inconsistent with its
rhetoric, citing the mainland's live-fire missile tests in the Taiwan
Strait in 1996 and various intimidation and containment measures that
Beijing adopted toward Taiwan prior to the island's presidential
election in 2000.
</P>
<P>
Despite this, Chen went on, Taiwan will continue to demonstrate
goodwill toward the mainland in an effort to amend the fragile
cross-strait ties.
</P>
<P>
Chen made the remarks at a time when the mainland is marking the
Jan. 30 10th anniversary of former Chinese President Jiang Zemin's
eight-point proposal on unification with Taiwan and the
ground-breaking inauguration of special cross-strait Chinese New Year
holiday charter flights offered by airlines on both sides of the
strait.
</P>
<P>
He was referring to a speech delivered by People's Political
Consultative Conference Chairman Jia Qinglin Jan. 28 in which Jia
reiterated Beijing's insistence on the "one China" principle and
claimed that Beijing remains open to cross-strait negotiations.
</P>
<P>
According to Jia, Beijing will continue to promote peaceful
unification and the "one country, two systems" formula toward Taiwan
based on Jiang's proposal.
</P>
<P>
Jia also claimed that so long as Taiwan gives up its
constitutional reform plans, which he described as an attempt to
realize de jure independence for the island, Beijing is willing to
engage Taiwan in dialogue and interaction.
</P>
<P>
"Beijing holds no prerequisite for resuming cross-strait
dialogue, nor for who will represent Taiwan in the talks, " Jia was
quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Chen is currently on a state visit to the Solomon Islands after
wrapping up a three-day official visit to Palau, another ROC
diplomatic ally in the South Pacific.
</P>
<P>
Chen, in the company of Solomon Islands Prime Minister Allan
Kemakesa, inspected the Taiwan Agrotech Mission to the Solomon
Islands Sunday and the two leaders rolled up their sleeves and
trouser legs to transplant rice seedlings in a paddy.
</P>
<P>
Chen and Kemakesa also visited a hog-raising farm operated by the
Taiwan Agrotech mission.
</P>
<P>
The Taiwan Agrotech Mission, which became operational in the
Solomon Islands in 1983, has been offering guidance to the Solomon
Islands people in the farming of vegetables, fruit and grain, as well
as in chicken and hog raising.
</P>
<P>
The mission has also help agricultural schools to run their own
farms and orchards.
</P>
<P>
Later in the day, Chen and Kemakesa attended a ceremony to mark
the inauguration of the Taiwan-built Central Hospital and visited a
children's ward and a dentist, where Taiwan dentists have been
offering free dentistry.
</P>
<P>
Chen will also meet the Solomon Islands Cabinet at a luncheon to
be hosted by Kemakesa.
</P>
<P>
He is scheduled to deliver a speech at the Solomon Islands
parliament Monday and he and Kemakesa will sign a joint communique on
bilateral ties before departing for home.

PREMIER-DESIGNATE REITERATES HOPE FOR INTER-PARTY COOPERATION
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Kaohsiung, Jan. 30 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Premier-designate Frank Hsieh reiterated
his hope Sunday for achieving inter-party reconciliation and
cooperation after assuming the premiership.
</P>
<P>
Hsieh, who will take over as premier Feb. 1, made the remarks
while presiding over a "National Cleanup Week" program in his
capacity as mayor of the southern port city of Kaohsiung.
</P>
<P>
The incoming premier clarified media reports that Legislative
Yuan Vice President P.K. Chiang, who is a vice chairman of the
opposition Kuomintang, is his "dream choice" for vice premier.
</P>
<P>
In fact, Hsieh said, he has no specific target to court for the
post at the moment.
</P>
<P>
"I prefer to leave the post vacant for the time being so that the
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) will have leverage to promote
reconciliation and cooperation with the opposition, " Hsieh
explained.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the DPP and its traditional "pan-green" ally of the
Taiwan Solidarity Union do not control a majority in the legislature,
Hsieh said the DPP must continue striving to forge reconciliation and
a working partnership with the opposition to ensure domestic
political stability.
</P>
<P>
As the major political parties are busy with the Feb. 1
legislative speaker and deputy speaker elections, Hsieh said, the
atmosphere at present is not favorable for inter-party reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Hsieh said, the political climate for inter-party
reconciliation will mature after the speaker and deputy speaker
elections.
</P>
<P>
"Once the speaker and deputy speaker are elected, we'll make
all-out efforts to activate consultations among various legislative
party caucuses and among top party leaders," Hsieh said.
</P>
<P>
Against this backdrop, Hsieh said, he will keep the vice premier
post open for the time being in order to facilitate inter-party
reconciliation and cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Hsieh also took advantage of the occasion to reaffirm his
commitment to allowing the people to enjoy a happy Chinese New Year
holiday, which will begin Feb. 8, the eve of the Lunar New Year.
</P>
<P>
After assuming the premiership, Hsieh went on, he will give
priority to ensuring smooth traffic flow ahead of and during the
holiday.
</P>
<P>
"Equally important are maintaining good public order, cracking
down on crime, ensuring food hygiene and cleaning up the
environment, " Hsieh said, adding that he hopes the public will
support the Feb. 1-7 National Cleanup Week program to create a clean
living environment and prevent any possible epidemic outbreaks, such
as dengue fever.
</P>
<P>
Accompanied by Environmental Protection Administration
Administrator Chang Juu-en, senior Kaohsiung city government
officials, municipal cleaning workers and volunteers, Hsieh inspected
several residential communities to drum up support for the National
Cleanup Week.

DPP MEMBERS GO TO POLLS FOR CHAIRMAN BY-ELECTION
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,   Jan.   30  (CNA)
(By Luis Huang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Members of the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) headed to the polls Sunday to cast their
ballots in a by-election for the party chairman.
</P>
<P>
A total of 167 polling stations were set up around the island
from 9 a.m through 4 p.m., with vote counting to begin immediately
after the polls close. There are around 347,000 eligible DPP voters
for the chairman by-election.
</P>
<P>
Although President Chen Shui-bian is currently on a state visit
to the South Pacific country of Palau, first lady Wu Shu-jen,
accompanied by DPP Secretary-General Chang Chun-hsiung, cast her
ballot at a polling station in Wanhua District to show the first
family's support for Presidential Office Secretary-General Su
Tseng-chang, who is the sole candidate for the chairmanship.
</P>
<P>
Noting that casting ballots is an obligation for every party
member, the first lady called for a high turnout to support Su.
</P>
<P>
For his part, Chang said after casting his ballot that the DPP
will continue to seek cooperation among the various political parties
for the sake of political stability after the new legislature is
inaugurated Feb. 1, which is why, he said, he will not vie for the
legislative speakership. Chang is a DPP legislator-at-large-elect.
</P>
<P>
Premier-designate Frank Hsieh and his wife, accompanied by
Kaohsiung Mayor-designate Chen Chi-mai, also went to the polls.
After casting his ballot, Hsieh said he supports Su's bid for
the chairmanship because a strong DPP will favor the promotion of
administrative affairs.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Presidential Office Secretary-General Su Tseng-chang
also voted for himself.
</P>
<P>
Su, who has been traveling around the country over the past few
weeks to secure votes, said the turnout rate for the previous DPP
chairman election in which there was also a sole candidate stood at
only around 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
He said he expected the turnout for the by-election to also be 10
percent, but added that it will be difficult to reach the target
because DPP members have increased by 200,000 over the past four
years and the by-election is being held close to the Lunar New Year
holiday.
</P>
<P>
According to a DPP official, the party is scheduled to announce
Su's election as new DPP chairman at a press conference to be held at
6 p.m. The outgoing chairman will hand over his post at a ceremony
slated for Feb. 15.
</P>
<P>
Quoting a report from the DPP chapter on the U.S. east coast, the
official said that Su obtained support from 40.53 percent of the
overseas members who cast their ballots.
</P>
<P>
The by-election was made necessary after President Chen Shui-bian
stepped down from his concurrent post as DPP chairman to take
responsibility for the worse-than-expected performance of the party
in the Dec. 11 legislative elections. The DPP garnered 89 seats, far
less than its target of more than 100 seats in the 225-member
legislature.

U.S., TAIWAN SCHOLARS AIR VIEWS ON CROSS-TAIWAN STRAIT RELATIONS
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Washington,  Jan. 29 (CNA)
(By Oliver Lin and P.C. Tang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Several Taiwan and U.S. scholars aired
their views in Washington, D.C. Saturday on cross-Taiwan Strait
relations, the day special Lunar New Year direct charter flights
between Taiwan and mainland China were launched.
</P>
<P>
The Taiwan Foundation for Democracy and the American University
jointly held a seminar Jan. 28-29 in the U.S. capital in which
scholars from the United States, mainland China, Taiwan, Hong Kong
and Japan discussed issues relating to U.S.-mainland-Taiwan
relations. Joanne J.L. Chang, Taiwan's deputy representative to the
United States, also attended the event.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan and the mainland agreed earlier in January to launch
direct cross-strait charter flights between Jan. 29 and Feb. 20 to
serve mainland-based Taiwanese businessmen and their dependents
wishing to return home for the Chinese New Year holiday.
</P>
<P>
Saying that the launching of the flights for the first time since
1949 is a significant breakthrough, Chang expressed the hope that
Taiwan and the mainland can engage in further dialogue. She also
urged Beijing to put aside its proposed anti-secession law targeting
Taiwan and to seek a mutually beneficial situation with the country.
</P>
<P>
Claiming that although the special direct cross-strait charter
flights will help reduce the tensions between Taiwan and mainland,
Alan Romberg, research fellow of the Henry Stimsen Research Center,
said, however, that the exclusion of Taiwanese students studying in
the mainland from being allowed to board the flights will harm
Taiwan's public relations.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Lai I-Chung, director of the International Affairs
Department of Taiwan Thinktank, said that he is not optimistic about
the development of cross-strait relations.
</P>
<P>
He said that despite the fact that the mainland has agreed to the
flights, it has also threatened to get tougher with Taiwan by
proposing the enactment of an anti-secession law.
</P>
<P>
A professor from National Chengchi University also said at the
seminar that he hopes Washington can work on promoting cross-strait
dialogue and other consultations.

cross-Taiwan Strait charter flights for the Lunar New Year period is
an important matter of "the two countries" across the strait.
</P>
<P>
According to the Echo Radio Station broadcasting out of Moscow,
the Republic of China has been a sovereign and independent state
since former President Chiang Kai-shek fled to Taiwan from the
communists with his defeated troops in 1949.
</P>
<P>
The private radio station contradicted Russian policy, which
recognizes mainland China as the sole ruler of China and does nor
recognize the ROC.
</P>
<P>
Saying that there have been no direct flight services offered by
both sides between Taiwan and the mainland in nearly 60 years, the
report added that the flights, which kicked off Saturday, will help
economic development on the both sides of the strait.
</P>
<P>
In fact, the charter flights were operated successfully in 2003,
although only Taiwan carriers were involved and they had to transit
through a third country or area.
</P>
<P>
Representatives from Taiwan and the mainland reached an agreement
Jan. 15 in Macau to allow carriers from both sides to operate the
charter flights from Jan. 29 to Feb. 20 to serve Taiwanese
businessmen and their families operating on the mainland wishing to
return home for the holiday.

KMT CHAIRMAN WILL VISIT HONG KONG IF INVITED

Hong Kong,  Jan.  30 (CNA)
(By Mandy Wong and Deborah Kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taiwan's opposition Kuomintang (KMT)
Chairman Lien Chan has said he would be glad to visit Hong Kong at
the invitation of academic institutes, a Hong Kong-based Taiwan
business executive said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Chen Zi-chuang, a British-trained law specialist and a managing
director of the Taiwan Industrial and Business Association in Hong
Kong, said he conveyed a Hong Kong university's invitation to Lien
during a recent visit to Taipei.
</P>
<P>
Lien said that if he can obtain a visa from the Hong Kong
authorities this year, he will accept an invitation from the
university to visit Hong Kong to deliver a speech, according to Chen.
</P>
<P>
Lien last visited Hong Kong Oct. 11, 2003, but only for a transit
stay of several hours before heading for another country.
</P>
<P>
Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou was denied a visa to visit Hong Kong
Jan. 11-13 by the Hong Kong authorities, reportedly because of his
opposition to a proposed mainland Chinese "anti-secession law"
targeting Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Ma, who is also a vice chairman of the KMT, was born in Hong Kong
in 1950.
</P>
<P>
He was originally invited to deliver a speech on the rise of
Chinese urban development from Taipei's perspective at the University
of Hong Kong Jan. 11 and to attend a Taipei tourism promotion
activity and seminar at the Hong Kong University of Science and
Technology Jan. 12.
</P>
<P>
The Hong Kong government subsequently "suggested" that the
University of Hong Kong postpone the seminar until April because,
according to the newspaper reports, the controversial "anti-secession
law" is expected to have been passed by that time.

KMT-PFP UNITY MEETING PLANNED TO SUPPORT LEGISLATIVE TICKET
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Jan.  30 (CNA)
(By Luis Huang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With only two days to go until the
elections for the Legislative Yuan speaker and vice speaker, the
legislative caucuses of the opposition Kuomintang (KMT) and the
People First Party (PFP) are scheduled to hold a unity meeting Monday
in an effort to secure votes for a KMT-PFP ticket in the race.
</P>
<P>
KMT Chairman Lien Chan and his PFP counterpart, James Soong, will
attend the bi-partisan meeting to help consolidate support for
incumbent Speaker Wang Jin-pyng's re-election bid and PFP
Legislator-at-large Chung Jung-chi for the vice speakership, Huang
Teh-fu, secretary-general of the KMT legislative caucus, told
reporters.
</P>
<P>
Huang said the solidarity meeting, to be jointly presided over by
the secretaries-general of the two party caucuses in the legislature,
is aimed at showing both parties' determination to support the
Wang-Chung ticket and to win the speaker and vice speaker election
scheduled for Feb. 1.
</P>
<P>
The attendance of both Lien and Soong at the meeting will boost
the morale of KMT and PFP lawmakers, according to Huang. In order to
ensure victory for Wang and Chung, the KMT Central Standing Committee
decided at an extraordinary meeting to impose the strictest
punishment on any of its legislators who don't toe the party line in
the voting.
</P>
<P>
Soong, who returned from the United States Saturday, refuted
media reports that PFP legislators are still divided on the
Wang-Chung ticket and that five of them might vote in favor of other
tickets.
</P>
<P>
The reports are incorrect, Soong said after attending the funeral
of PFP Legislador Cheng Chin-ling's father-in-law in Taoyuan County.
He added that he will meet newly elected and re-elected lawmakers to
lobby for their support for the Wang-Chung ticket.
</P>
<P>
For his part, PFP Secretary-General Chin Chin-sheng claimed that
KMT-PFP cooperation in the election is not only an important
political mission for the two parties but also a pivotal commitment
to society. He further said that the party will do its utmost to
cement support for the ticket.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Liu Wen-hsiung, chief convener of the PFP legislative
caucus, said that the opposition expect Wang and Chung to be elected
despite strong pressure from the "pan-green camp" of the ruling
Democratic Party (DPP) and the opposition Taiwan Solidarity Union
(TSU).
</P>
<P>
Liu noted that Soong is seeking to address several lawmakers'
opposition to Chung's running for the speakership
</P>
<P>
Wang has been campaigning hard to retain his speaker post in the
past few weeks, traveling around the island to court the support of
re-elected and newly elected legislators from the ruling and
opposition parties.
</P>
<P>
Party sources said that Wang is almost certain to win
re-election, as the "pan-blue alliance" of the KMT and the PFP
jointly command a majority of 114 seats in the new 225-member
legislature. As for Chung's vice speakership bid, the sources said,
it will depend on whether the two parties can consolidate unity
within the alliance.
</P>
<P>
According to media reports, several KMT legislators-elect have
said they support the re-election of incumbent Legislative Yuan Vice
Speaker P.K. Chiang, who is also a KMT vice chairman and who has also
served as minister of economic affairs and chairman of the Council
for Economic Planning and Development.

TWO ARATS OFFICIALS TO VISIT TAIPEI TO PAY TRIBUTE TO LATE SEF CHIEF
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Beijing,   Jan.   30  (CNA)
(By Stanley Cheung and Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two senior officials from the
Beijing-based Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait
(ARATS) will travel to Taipei Feb. 1 to pay their last respects to
Koo Chen-fu, the late top Taiwan negotiator with mainland China, a
mainland official said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Chen Yunlin, director of the Taiwan Affairs Office (TAO) of the
mainland's State Council, said his deputy, Sun Yafu, who concurrently
serves as ARATS vice president, and ARATS Secretary-General Li Yafei,
will pay tribute to Koo, the late chairman of the Taipei-based
Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF), on behalf of ARATS President Wang
Daohan.
</P>
<P>
Chen said the trip is not only aimed at expressing the mainland's
esteem for Koo's contributions to the promotion of cross-strait
relations but also at symbolizing the mainland's respect for the
people of Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
"We hope Sun and Li will convey our remembrance and condolences
during their trip to Taipei," Chen said.
</P>
<P>
Koo, a respected business tycoon known for his diplomatic acumen,
held a groundbreaking meeting with Wang in Singapore in 1993 in the
first formal cross-strait contact in more than four decades. He died
Jan. 3 at the age of 88.
</P>
<P>
The historic Koo-Wang meeting laid the framework for the
quasi-official SEF and ARATS to handle cross-strait exchanges in the
absence of official ties. In 1998, the two envoys met again when Koo
traveled to Shanghai and Beijing to boost further rapprochement.
However, Beijing unilaterally suspended regular SEF-ARATS
dialogue in July 1999, when then-ROC President Lee Teng-hui defined
cross-strait ties as state-to-state in nature.
</P>
<P>
Wang sent his condolences to Koo's family immediately after
learning of Koo's death by issuing a press statement via the
mainland's official Xinhua News Agency.
</P>
<P>
According to a Sunday news release posted on Xinhua's Web site,
Sun and Li are scheduled to leave Shanghai for Taiwan Feb. 1 and
return to the mainland the following day. Koo's funeral will take
place Feb. 2.

Tickets for Beijing-Taipei Lunar New Year
charter flights scheduled for Feb. 5 have been hotly sought after,
with many people failing to get one.
</P>
<P>
All tickets for the 125-seat charter flight scheduled to depart
Beijing for Taiwan's Chiang Kai-shek International Airport Feb. 5
have been booked, according to Chen Kuo-yuan, secretary-general of
the Taiwan Business Association in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
There will be three more flights until Feb 20 for the convenience
of Beijing-based Taiwan businessmen and their relatives during the
Lunar New Year period, Chen said.
</P>
<P>
Bookings are much more heavily sought-after than had been
estimated, Chen added.
</P>
<P>
Seven charter flights operated by six mainland carriers arrived
in either Taipei or Kaohsiung from Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou
Saturday, the first day of the charter services, carrying about 1,700
Taiwanese passengers home for the holidays. They were the first
mainland civilian aircraft to arrive legally in Taiwan in 56 years.
</P>
<P>
The authorities, as well as private airline operators from the
two sides of the Taiwan Strait, reached a consensus Jan. 15 on the
long-awaited direct air links, although the charter flight services
will last only for 23 days over the holiday period.
</P>
<P>
The two sides agreed that during the Jan. 29-Feb. 20 period, six
air carriers from each side will operate a total of 48 charter
flights to serve Taiwanese businessmen and their dependents.

PRESIDENT VOWS TO PICK HEAVYWEIGHT TO LEAD SEF

Honiara,  the  Solomon  Islands,  Jan.  30 (CNA)

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President Chen
Shui-bian said Sunday he will pick a heavyweight figure to head the
quasi-official Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) to underscore the
importance his administration attaches to relations across the Taiwan
Strait.
</P>
<P>
Chen made the remarks during an informal meeting in the Solomon
Islands with Taiwan reporters covering his current two-nation South
Pacific visit that already took him to Palau.
</P>
<P>
After late SEF Chairman Koo Chen-fu's Feb. 2 funeral, Chen said,
he will choose a person of similar stature to head the SEF, which is
authorized by the government to handle exchanges with mainland China
in the absence of official ties.
</P>
<P>
"I want to pick a heavyweight figure versed in cross-strait
affairs to succeed Koo, " Chen said, adding that he will not name a
lightweight successor to downgrade the SEF's status, as some
critics have speculated.
</P>
<P>
During a visit to Palau before coming to the Solomon Islands,
Chen recalled that he gained inspiration from seeing lush trees
growing on barren rocks on a small islet of the Palau island group.
</P>
<P>
"Since trees can sprout out of hard and rugged rocks, I believe
that with goodwill, sincerity, patience and wise new thinking, we
will be able to open Beijing's doors no matter how recalcitrant the
mainland Chinese leaders are," Chen said.
</P>
<P>
Chen also took advantage of the occasion to urge mainland China
to abort its proposed anti-secession legislation.
</P>
<P>
"The so-called anti-secession law is an unilateral move to alter
the Taiwan Strait status quo and poses a challenge to the Taiwan
Relations Act and the U.S.-Japan defense treaty," Chen warned, adding
that Beijing's legislative plan would only anger and further alienate
Taiwan people.
</P>
<P>
If the anti-secession law becomes a reality, Chen said, the two
sides of the Taiwan Strait would definitely become farther apart
rather than get closer.
</P>
<P>
During his stay in Palau, Chen, a non-swimmer, went snorkeling.
The amazing underwater experience also gave him new inspiration, Chen
said.
</P>
<P>
"When snorkeling, you must bow your head in order to see the
beautiful underwater world. In daily life, we must be modest. My
administrative team must be modest enough to listen to public opinion
and opposition critique," he added.
</P>
<P>
Accompanied by a small entourage, Chen arrived in the Solomon
Islands capital of Honiara Saturday for a two-day official visit.
Chen is the first Republic of China president ever to visit the
nation's South Pacific allies.
</P>
<P>
Chen said the journey to the two scenic island nations of Palau
and the Solomon Islands has hardened his determination to promote
balanced and sustainable development in Taiwan. Both Palau and the
Solomon Islands have given priority to protecting their natural
ecologies and marine resources.
</P>
<P>
"Sustainability is more important than anything else. The top
concern of the 23 million Taiwan people is Taiwan's sustainable
development, not any single political party's partisan interests, "
Chen added.
</P>
<P>
With a view to speeding up Taiwan's development, Chen said he
will spare no effort to promote inter-party reconciliation and
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Chen said he was impressed by opposition People First Party (PFP)
Chairman James Soong's appeal in Taipei a day earlier for
cross-strait reconciliation as well as domestic inter-party
reconciliation and ethnic reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
"I'm more than willing to cooperate with him. I hope he will
honor his promise to assist in forging inter-party reconciliation and
cooperation, " Chen said, adding he believes that there should be
ample room for ruling and opposition parties to sit down to talk and
cooperate.
</P>
<P>
Stressing that inter-party reconciliation and cooperation differ
from political horse trading, Chen said inter-party engagements are
subject to public supervision in a democratic country like Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, Chen made an inspection tour of farms
established with the assistance of the Taiwan agricultural mission
stationed in the Solomon Islands. Chen will address the country's
parliament Monday before leaving for home. On his way back to Taipei,
Chen will make a five-hour transit stop on the U.S. territory of Guam
where he will meet with local administrators and Taiwanese
expatriates.

Two container wharfs newly expanded for
Taiwan's Evergreen Marine Corp. in Tacoma, Washington, were
inaugurated Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The Tacoma Port Authority spent less than two years
completing the container wharf expansion work and transferred its use
to Evergreen Marine for a 20-year lease period at a ceremony attended
by Evergreen Group Vice Chairman Kuo Hsuan-yu and port officials.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the ceremony, Kuo said that the inauguration of the
new wharfs with advanced equipment will help Evergreen Marine upgrade
its shipping efficiency, while a managing director of the harbor
authority said the project will further boost the economic
development in the Tacoma area.
</P>
<P>
According to the director, the port authority invested US$210 in
the first-stage expansion project alone, which includes two
51-foot-deep wharfs with a total area of 171 acres and modern
infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
The completion of the first-stage expansion project will help the
marine transport company increase its container handling volume to
840,000 TEUS (20-foot equivalent units) annually, the director said,
adding that if Evergreen decides to carry out further expansion, its
annual container handling volume will go up to 1.2 million TEUs.
</P>

Tacoma is the sixth-largest container port in North America.

The Republic of China will offer
financial aid for a highway construction project in the northern
Costa Rican city of San Carlos, the ROC Embassy in Costa Rica said in
a telephone interview Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Embassy staff said the project calls for an outlay of US$62
million. The ROC government will donate US$15 million for the project
and offer an additional US$35 million in soft loan. The remaining
US$12 million will be raised by the Costa Rican government. Taiwan's
Ret-Ser Engineering Agency will be responsible for building the new
highway.

ROC Ambassador to Costa Rica Wu Tzu-dan said the Costa Rican
government attaches great importance to the highway construction
project. 
</P>
<P>
Noting that San Carlos is Costa Rica's dairy industry center
which provides 68 percent of the country's demand for milk and
other dairy products, Wu said the 30-km highway will contribute to
the city's transportation and tourist industry.
</P>
<P>
Wu visited San Carlos Friday at the invitation of the San Carlos
city government and council. Wu said he took advantage of the visit
to brief San Carlos city councilors, civilian groups representatives
and business executives on Taiwan's economic development, progress in
various ongoing ROC-Costa Rica cooperative projects and the
blueprint of the new San Carlos highway project.
</P>

The family of the late Straits
Exchange Foundation (SEF) Koo Chen-fu has expressed welcome to Koo's
mainland counterpart's decision to send three deputies to Taipei to
attend Koo's funeral on his behalf, a SEF official said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
SEF Secretary-General Liu Teh-hsun told a news conference that
Wang Daohan, president of the Beijing-based Association for Relations
Across the Taiwan Strait (ARATS), has named three deputies -- ARATS
Vice President Sun Yafu, who concurrently deputy director of the
Taiwan Affairs Office of the mainland's State Council, ARATS

"Koo's family is grateful for Wang's decision and welcomes
Wang's three deputies' attendance at Koo's funeral," Liu said.

</P>
<P>
The three ARATS officials are scheduled to arrive in Taipei Feb.
1 and return to mainland China the following day, Liu said, adding
that their entry applications will be handled in accordance
with a SEF-ARATS agreement on convenient personnel exchanges between
the two quasi-official intermediary bodies.

The two organizations have no public contact since mid-1999. Liu

Yi-hsiung and Frank Hsieh. The by-election was held after President
Chen Shui-bian quit the party chairmanship to take responsibility for
the party's disappointing showing in last December's legislative
elections.
</P>
<P>
Su, a lawyer-turned-politician who was also a DPP founding
member, said after winning the by-election that only a democratic
party can defend democratic values.
</P>
<P>
"The by-election has once again consolidated the DPP's democratic
mechanism, " Su said, adding that he will do his utmost to lead the
DPP in "building the widest avenue to reflect the broad will of the
people, allowing more people to support the DPP."
</P>
<P>
The 58-year-old Su came to prominence as magistrate of Taipei
county, making him a natural competitor with opposition Kuomintang's
most popular politician, Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou, for the 2008
presidential race.
</P>
<P>
Another possible DPP contender for the 2008 race is
Premier-designate Frank Hsieh, who enjoyed high popularity ratings as
mayor of Taiwan's second largest city, Kaohsiung. Hsieh will formally
take over as premier Feb. 1.

SPEAKERSHIP BID AIMED AT CHANGING LEGISLATIVE CULTURE: DPP CANDIDATE
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei, Jan. 30 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Acting ruling Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) Chairman Ker Chien-ming, who is also a veteran legislator, said
Sunday his decision to run for the legislative speaker post is mainly
aimed at changing the legislative culture.
</P>
<P>
Ker said the Legislative Yuan speaker post has been controlled by
the Kuomintang (KMT) for the past 55 years.
</P>
<P>
"It's time for us to change the legislature's landscape and
culture," Ker said, adding that the legislature needs a new
culture and an end to zero-sum inter-party political wrangling.
</P>
<P>
Ker said if he manages to win the election, he will show
magnanimity and modesty in promoting inter-party
reconciliation and cooperation to maintain domestic political
stability and speed up Taiwan's economic development.
</P>
<P>
Noting that incumbent Legislative Yuan President Wang Jin-pyng,
also a KMT vice chairman, is an old-fashioned politician, Ker claimed
that if Wang is re-elected as speaker, the legislature will continue
its confrontational work style. The political wrangling on the
legislative floor over the past three years has left a shameful page
in the legislature's history and the chamber's approval rating has
also sunk to an all-time low.
</P>
<P>
As the DPP and its ally -- the Taiwan Solidarity Union --
jointly control only 101 seats in the 225-member new legislature to
be sworn in Feb. 1, Ker is facing an uphill battle to defeat Wang.
The KMT and its ally -- the People First Party (PFP) -- jointly
control a slim majority in the legislature.

PRESIDENT CHEN TO MAKE TRANSIT STOP IN GUAM EN ROUTE HOME
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Honiara,  the Solomon Islands,  Jan.  31 (CNA)

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Republic of China
President Chen Shui-bian and his entourage are expected to arrive in
the U.S. territory of Guam Monday for a transit stop en route back to
Taiwan after concluding a diplomatic tour to Palau and the Solomon
Islands.
</P>
<P>
President Chen and his entourage will depart the Solomon Islands
shortly before noon Monday. They are scheduled to arrive in Guam at
around 3 p.m. local time for a five-hour stopover.
</P>
<P>
David Brown, a board director of the American Institute in Taiwan
(AIT) ; Guam Governor Carl Gutierrez; and a U.S. congressman are
expected to meet President Chen at the Guam airport. The AIT is a
quasi-official organization authorized to handle U.S. exchanges with
Taiwan in the absence of formal diplomatic relations between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
During his stay in Guam, President Chen is once again expected to
echo U.S. President George W. Bush's call for expanding freedom and
democracy outlined in his second-term inaugural speech. He will also
reaffirm his commitment to promoting reconciliation among Taiwan's
ruling and opposition parties.
</P>
<P>
Chen is scheduled to lay a wreath at the Asan Beach war memorial
and meet with Taiwanese expatriates in Guam for a luncheon.
</P>
<P>
According to Chen's aides accompanying him on his tour, Taiwan
experienced no difficulties in arranging for the president's transit
stop in Guam, with U.S. officials agreeing to the request.
</P>
<P>
In the Solomon Islands Monday, President Chen addressed the South
Pacific nation's parliament before concluding his state visit.
</P>
<P>
He praised the people, lawmakers and government of the Solomon
Islands for their concerted efforts in resolving differences among
themselves and reaching reconciliation after the country was divided
over ethnic problems.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the Solomon Islands' national flag -- which has a
yellow diagonal line separating a field of blue with five white stars
and a field of green -- provides great inspiration to Taiwan's people
and political leaders, saying that the yellow line tells Taiwan that
it can serve as a bridge between the "pan-blue" and "pan-green" camps
instead of as a dividing line.
</P>
<P>
"Dialogue is the best way to resolve differences and seek
consensus, while reconciliation forms the bedrock of consolidation
and sustainable development of a country," he asserted.
</P>
<P>
President Chen kicked off his five-day visit to Palau and the
Solomon Islands -- two Republic of China diplomatic allies in the
South Pacific -- on Jan. 27. He plans to visit the ROC's other allies
in the region, including the Marshall Islands and Kiribati, in May
this year.

PROSECUTORS SEEKING LIFE SENTENCE FOR BOMBER SUSPECT
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei, Jan. 31 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Prosecutors are seeking a life sentence for
Kao Pao-chung, who has been charged with setting off canisters of
liquefied natural gas in a huge fire ball at a parking lot outside
the Taipei Railway Station in early December.
</P>
<P>
After more than a month of investigations, prosecutors from the
Taipei District Prosecutor's Office recommended in court Monday that
Kao be handed a life sentence for violating the arms control statute,
attempted murder, and posing a terrorist threat to the public.
</P>
<P>
The prosecutors said that Kao used an extremely dangerous method
to express his personal indignation with Taiwan's political situation
and society and should be locked up for life.
</P>
<P>
Kao, 46, was nabbed by police in Taichung, central Taiwan, in mid
January. He confessed to the crime during preliminary inquiries by
police.
</P>
<P>
After a pickup truck loaded with canisters of liquefied natural
gas exploded at the Taipei Railway Station Dec. 9, 2004 -- two days
before the nationwide legislative elections -- police found a note at
the site of the explosion indicating that more bombs had been placed
inside the train station. The police then searched the station and
found four fake explosive devices with anti-Taiwan independence
slogans attached to them.
</P>
<P>
Prior to Dec. 9, several local television stations also received
similar bomb threats which turned out to be hoaxes.

Ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)
Secretary-General Chang Chun-hsiung on Monday denied accusations that
the party is trying to buy votes in the upcoming legislative speaker
and vice speaker elections.
</P>
<P>
Chang said the DPP will not interfere in the elections with
money, and he dared the accusers to present evidence, if any, to
authorities for investigation.
</P>
<P>
Chang said it is the DPP's hope to reform the Legislative Yuan
and engage in clean elections.
</P>
<P>
Some opposition Kuomintang (KMT) politicians have alleged that
the DPP is offering NT$70 million (US$2.2 million) per vote in
exchange for legislators' support in the elections, set to be held
Tuesday after the legislators-elect are sworn in.
</P>
<P>
KMT Chairman Lien Chan said earlier in the day that the DPP must
be held accountable if the allegations are true.
</P>
<P>
Lien said it would represent the most serious contempt for the
legislature and the greatest humiliation to the lawmakers if money
were used to influence the elections.

enjoy a slim majority in the legislature, are jointly fielding

PROCESS OF U.S. BEEF REENTERING TAIWAN IN FINAL STAGE: U.S. OFFICIAL
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Washington, Jan. 30 (CNA)
(By Wennie Chi and Deborah Kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taiwan is expected to announce in about
a month the results of its inspections that mark the final stage in
allowing U.S. beef back on the local market following the suspension
of imports in 2003 due to the discovery of a case of mad cow disease,
an official with the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) said
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan suspended beef imports from the United States in December
2003 due to safety concerns over bovine spongiform encephalopathy
(BSE), also known as mad cow disease, after the discovery in the U.S.
state of Washington of a single BSE-infected case at a cattle ranch.
</P>
<P>
According to the USDA official, who asked not to be identified,
Taiwan health and agriculture officials have traveled to the United
States to conduct on-site inspections of the implementation of the
U.S. safeguards against mad cow disease.
</P>
<P>
The Taiwan officials have completed the reviews necessary for
resuming the beef trade, the USDA official said, adding that
officials from the American Institute in Taiwan (AIT) have also been
contacting relevant Taiwan officials in an effort to speed up the
paperwork so that U.S. beef can reenter the Taiwan market at an
earlier date.
</P>
<P>
AIT is a quasi-official organization authorized by Washington to
handle U.S. exchanges with Taiwan in the absence of formal diplomatic
relations between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
USDA officials are now more reserved and low-key over the reentry
issue than before after Taiwan lodged a protest against the USDA for
its unilateral announcement late October last year concerning
Taiwan's reopening of its market to U.S. beef.
</P>
<P>
The USDA announced on Oct. 26 that Taiwan has agreed in principle
to resume imports of U.S. beef and beef products. Taiwan officials
told them that they were close to completing the reviews necessary
for resuming the beef trade, with on-site inspections being at the
final step in the process, the USDA news release indicated.
</P>
<P>
If everything went smoothly, it was expected that Taiwan would
reopen its doors to U.S. beef and beef products before the end of
2004, the USDA news release said.
</P>
<P>
At that time, most of the Taiwan officials who were assigned to
travel to the United States for inspection missions had not yet gone
to the United States.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan purchased US$325 million worth of U.S. beef and beef
products in 2003 and was the sixth-largest importer of U.S. beef
before it imposed the ban in December 2003. Since then, Australian
beef has replaced U.S. beef in the Taiwan market.
</P>
<P>
More than 40 countries, including Japan, the largest importer,
have imposed embargoes against U.S. beef, seriously affecting the
U.S. beef export trade, which is worth at least US$3.8 billion a
year. Big names in the beef export trade, including Tyson Foods, Inc.
and Cargill, Inc., have exerted great pressure on the USDA for the
early resumption of exports to these former importing countries.

Opposition People First Party (PFP)
Chairman James Soong reaffirmed Monday his support for the opposition
Kuomintang's (KMT) candidate for legislative speaker, incumbent Wang
Jin-pyng.
</P>
<P>
Soong also expressed his gratitude for the KMT's support for the
PFP's candidate for vice speaker, David J.C. Chung.
</P>
<P>
Soong made the remarks on arriving at KMT headquarters for a
meeting with KMT Chairman Lien Chan to exchange views on Tuesday's
elections for speaker and vice speaker. He told reporters he will
also share with Lien details of his talks with U.S. officials during
his just-concluded visit in the United States.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that a number of rumors were being circulated in
Taiwan while he was away, which included stories suggesting that the
ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) had sent representatives to
meet him in the U.S. and that the PFP was prepared to cooperate with
the DPP despite the DPP's pro-independence position.
</P>
<P>
Dismissing these stories as unfounded, Soong said both the PFP
and the KMT are defenders of the Republic of China and opposed to
independence for Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
On reports that President Chen Shui-bian plans to appoint Soong
as chairman of the Straits Exchange Foundation, Soong said he has not
received any such information.

Also on Monday, PFP Legislator Shen Chih-hwei visited Wang and
Chung to express her support for their bids for speaker and vice
speaker.

PREMIER-DESIGNATE NAMES MORE NEW ADMINISTRATIVE TEAM MEMBERS
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Kaohsiung,  Jan.  31 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Premier-designate Frank Hsieh named
several new members Monday to join his administrative team, with Lee
Ying-yuan, incumbent secretary-general of the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP), serving as his chief of staff.
</P>
<P>
On the last day of his tenure as Kaohsiung mayor, Hsieh, who will
take over as premier Tuesday, said he is very pleased that Lee has
agreed to serve as the Executive Yuan or Cabinet secretary-general
once again.
</P>
<P>
Lee, who has a doctoral degree in medical economics from the
University of North Carolina, had been a legislator, Taiwan's deputy
representative to the United States and Cabinet secretary-general
before becoming the DPP chief of staff.
</P>
<P>
"Lee is the best choice for the Cabinet chief of staff post. He
has been known for his skill in communications and coordination and
is versed in legislative operations. His rich career experiences will
well support the Cabinet's smooth interaction with major political
parties and the opposition-controlled Legislative Yuan, " Hsieh said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Hsieh said, Chang Chun-yen, secretary-general of the
Kaohsiung City Government, will serve as director-general of the
Central Personnel Administration (CPA) in his Cabinet.
</P>
<P>
Chang once served as the Kaohsiung City Government's personnel
department chief for six years, Hsieh said, adding that Chang had
also been the Tainan City Government's financial affairs bureau chief
and Kaohsiung Bank chairman before assuming his current post.
</P>
<P>
Chang will fill the post vacated by Lee Yi-yang, who will become
DPP secretary-general.
</P>
<P>
As to incumbent Kaohsiung Deputy Mayor Lin Yung-chien, Hsieh said
he has decided to name Lin as vice minister of the interior. Hsieh
said he recognizes Lin's performance as deputy mayor of Taiwan's
second-largest city for the past few years. As the vice minister of
the interior, Hsieh said, Lin will be able to assist the Cabinet in
handling local affairs.
</P>
<P>
Incumbent Vice Minister of the Interior Lin Chin-yung will
replace Cheng Wen-lung as vice chairman of the Public Construction
Commission (PCC) . Hsieh said Lee is a lawyer-turned-politician and
will be able to more professionally supervise the PCC's procurement
and BOT projects in the future. Cheng will serve as Kaohsiung deputy
mayor.
</P>
<P>
As for the vice premier post, Hsieh said the post will be left
vacant for the time being to give the DPP leverage to forge
reconciliation and cooperation with the opposition. Hsieh said he is
very grateful for incumbent Vice Premier Yeh Chu-lan's generosity and
magnanimity to voluntarily tender the post.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the DPP and its traditional "pan-green" ally, the
Taiwan Solidarity Union, do not control a majority in the
legislature, Hsieh said the DPP must continue striving to forge
reconciliation and a working partnership with the opposition to
ensure domestic political stability.
</P>
<P>
As all major political parties are busy with the Feb. 1
legislative speaker and deputy speaker elections, Hsieh said, the
atmosphere at present is not favorable for inter-party
reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
Hsieh said last week that as many incumbent Cabinet members took
office only last May, he will give them at least six more
months to implement their ideals and initiatives.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, Hsieh said, the Cabinet will undergo only minor
adjustments. "I know every individual has his or her own character
and taste. I want to give all of you at least six more months for us
to adapt to each other and to see if we have shared values and
opinions, " Hsieh said, adding that he hopes all of his Cabinet
members will speak freely with each other, work as a team and take
pride in their jobs.

OUTPUT OF OPTOELECTRONICS SECTOR TO HIT NT$1.5 TRILLION IN 2005

<TEXT>
<P>
The production value of Taiwan's
optoelectronics industry is expected to rise 34 percent year-on-year
to NT$1.5 trillion (US$47.17 billion) in 2005 owing to increased
global demand for optical display and optical storage products,
according to the Industrial Technology Research Institute (ITRI) on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
The production value of the optoelectronics industry was NT$1.1
trillion in 2004, up 43 percent from the 2003 level, an ITRI report
said.
</P>
<P>
Of the NT$1.1 trillion, NT$933.3 billion, or 83 percent, was
contributed by optical display and optical storage products, the
report said, adding that the combined output of these two kinds of
optical products is expected to continue to grow to NT$1.3 trillion
in 2005.
</P>
<P>
While the newly launched production lines for liquid crystal flat
panels of Au Optronics and Chi Mei Optoelectronics will raise the
output of optical display products, the popularity of DVD players,
recorders and burners will boost the demand for optical storage
products, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the optical input sector is expected to benefit from
the strong global demand for digital cameras, and the development of
broadband networking in various countries around the world will also
bolster the optical communications sector, the report said.

The Buddhist Compassion Relief Tzu Chi

tsunami victims in Sri Lanka, members of the charitable organization
based in Hualien County, eastern Taiwan, said Monday.
</P>
<P>
The large distribution operation, begun Jan. 29, was the first of
its kind prepared by the Tzu Chi group to help aid the South Asian
country, one of the regional countries hit hard by tsunamis triggered
by a 9.0-magnitude earthquake off Indonesian island of Sumatra
December 26.
</P>
<P>
Tzi Chi members from the United States, Canada, Singapore,
Malaysia and local volunteers joined in the operation to hand out
daily necessities, including rice, sugar, oil for cooking and
powdered milk, according to the Tzu Chi organization.

<P>
The amount of the relief supplies should cover the needs of 1,490
households, or 5,788 people, Tzu Chi members said.

CROSS-STRAIT TIES STILL DELICATE DESPITE CHARTER FLIGHTS: KMT AIDE
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei, Jan. 31 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Relations between Taiwan and mainland China
remain fragile despite the successful launch of the Chinese New Year
holiday charter flights between the two sides, according to
Kuomintang (KMT) spokesman Chang Jong-kung.
</P>
<P>
Chang reminded the government led by the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) of the fact that bilateral ties are still at
stake and urged the government to build on this success to carefully
promote fresh two-way exchanges because "the flights do not mean that
cross-Taiwan Strait friction has been reduced."
</P>
<P>
Ascribing the beginning of the historic direct charter flights to
high expectations from the United States and to compromises made by
the government, Chang claimed that the service would not have begun
were it not for the help of the KMT.
</P>
<P>
He said that in the future, the service should be provided in a
more convenient and efficient fashion to cover a broader range of
Taiwan people. Taiwan students in mainland China are excluded from
the service this time, which was designed solely to carry homecoming
Taiwan businessmen and their families based in the mainland.
</P>
<P>
He suggested that the government learn something from the
negotiation model this time and urged it to do its best to push for
the opening of full trade, transport and postal links across the
strait.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, representatives of Taiwan's aviation industry,
including China Airlines and EVA Airways Corp. -- Taiwan's two
largest carriers -- said that they strongly hope that the direct
charter service would help set a precedence for future reconciliation
and negotiations.
</P>

Cross-strait links have been banned since 1949 after Taiwan and
the mainland separated in the wake of a civil war.

INNOVATION IS TAIWAN'S COMPETITIVE EDGE: ECONOMICS MINISTER
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taiwan will make use of its advantage in
innovation as well as research and development (R&amp;D) to compete with
other countries economically, Minister of Economic Affairs Ho
Mei-yueh said Monday.
</P>
<P>
With Asia having replaced North America and Europe to become
Taiwan's major export market over the past decade, the regional
economic integration of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations
(ASEAN) is posing a challenge to the island, Ho said.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan must enhance its capability in innovation and R&amp;D,
diversify its industries and investment, and encourage businesses to
set up R&amp;D centers or operational headquarters in Taiwan to cope with
the challenges, Ho said.
</P>
<P>
A total of 80 Taiwanese enterprises and 25 multinational
enterprises have established R&amp;D centers in Taiwan to date, with 252
new products being developed in 2004, Ho noted.
</P>
<P>
Ho predicted that Taiwan will be able to develop 600 new products
per year by 2006, which she said will give the island a
competitiveness edge.
</P>
<P>
Ho said Taiwan will continue to compete with other countries with
its high value-added and innovative products in the future and will
transfer production to mainland China after the products become
universal and production costs fall.
</P>
<P>
Ho made the remarks during a seminar on Taiwan's economic status
and outlook.
</P>
<P>
According to the minister, Taiwan's economic growth stood at 5.93
percent in 2004, and its private investment and industrial output
also rose by 24.9 percent and 9.8 percent, respectively.
</P>
<P>
Also, the unemployment rate dropped to 4.44 percent in 2004, Ho
said.
</P>
<P>
While foreign trade volume amounted to US$342 billion in 2004,
the figure is expected to rise 11.03 percent to US$379.6 billion in
2005, she said.

<P>
The Republic of China's representative
office in South Korea opened a branch in Busan Monday to better serve
South Korean citizens and ROC expatriates residing in the country's
southern provinces and cities.
</P>
<P>
The ROC closed its Busan Consulate General in August 1992 when
South Korea switched its diplomatic recognition from Taipei to
Beijing.
</P>
<P>
After a nearly 13-year hiatus, the ROC has opened a new
representative office in Busan, South Korea's second-largest city
after Seoul.
</P>
<P>
The new office is named the "Taipei Mission in Korea, Busan
Office." The Taipei Mission in Korea, headquartered in Seoul,
represents Taiwan's interests in South Korea in the absence of formal
diplomatic ties.
</P>
<P>
Lee Tsai-fang, the de facto ROC ambassador to South Korea,
traveled from Seoul to Busan to preside over the Busan branch's
inaugural ceremony.
</P>
<P>
Lee said the opening of the Busan office marks yet another step
forward in the substantive Taiwan-South Korean relations following
the resumption of direct air links last September after a 12-year
hiatus.
</P>
<P>
Once the Busan office begins formal operations in March, Lee
said, South Korean residents and Taiwan expatriates in southern South
Korea will no longer need to travel to Seoul for visas or document
notary services.

JANUARY CONSUMER CONFIDENCE INDEX FALLS: NCU POLL

<P>
Taiwan's consumer confidence index (CCI)
fell by 1.28 points to 75.85 points for January from the previous
month's level, with the confidence indicator in the local job market
posting the largest drop, according to a report released Monday.
</P>
<P>
According to Chu Yun-peng, director of the economic development
center under the National Central University (NCU), which carried out
the survey, public confidence in the country's job market for the
coming six-month period was eroded in particular, representing a drop
of 5.65 points month to month to stand at 84.05 points.
</P>
<P>
The decline marks a contrast to statistics made public recently
by the Cabinet-level Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and
Statistics that show that Taiwan's jobless rate has improved, Chu
noted.
</P>
<P>
Indicators in three other areas -- consumer product prices,
family economic situations and the country's economy -- also
decreased over the prospects for the next six months by 4.05 points,
2.75 points and 0.05 points, respectively, to 56.15 points, 72.9
points and 75.1 points, the poll found.
</P>
<P>
However, indicators regarding the timing for purchasing stocks
and durable goods in the February-July period rose to 59.2 points and
107.7 points, respectively, up by 4.7 points and 0.15 percent over
the December levels.
</P>
<P>
A score of between 100 and 200 points indicates an optimistic
sentiment, while a level lower than 100 points reflects a pessimistic
atmosphere, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
The random telephone survey was conducted from Jan. 18-23,
questioning 2,058 residents aged over 20 in Taiwan. It had a margin

LEGAL AID FOUNDATION HELPS ONE FAMILY EVERY 67 MINUTES: SPOKESMAN

<P>
The Legal Aid Foundation (LAF) has helped
defend one low-income family's legal rights every 67 minutes since
its inception July 1, 2004, a spokesman for the non-profit
organization said Monday.
</P>
<P>
As of the end of last year, LAF Secretary-General Cheng Wen-lung
said, the foundation had assisted in 3,843 legal cases involving
low-income families.
</P>
<P>
"The figure can be translated into 21 cases a day, or one family
receiving legal aid every 67 minutes," Cheng said.
</P>
<P>
The foundation received 8,283 applications for legal aid in the
six-month period from July 1, 2004 through the end of last year,
Cheng went on, adding that if the applications involving only legal
counseling were excluded, the number of applications for assistance
in lawsuit proceedings was 7,250, of which 61 percent were approved.
</P>
<P>
Over the past six months, Cheng said, the foundation has also
issued NT$41 million-worth of guaranty papers for disadvantaged
applicants to seek injunctions on their debtors' property.
</P>
<P>
The foundation now has five branches in Taipei, Taichung, Tainan,
Kaohsiung and Hualien, Cheng said, adding that five additional
branches will open this year to serve more low-income families who
need legal aid to defend their legitimate rights to fight or
institute lawsuits. The five new branches will be located in Taoyuan,
Hsinchu, Changhua, Ilan and Taitung cities.
</P>
<P>
The foundation was established in line with the Legal Aid Law
that took effect early last year. The establishment of the foundation
made Taiwan one of the few countries in the world to create
institutionalized mechanisms to protect low-income earners' legal
rights. The foundation is supported by an annual NT$500 million
budget from the Judicial Yuan.

TAIWAN'S IDENTITY TO BE SHAPED BY ACTS NOT WORDS: PREMIER-DESIGNATE

<P>
Kaohsiung Mayor Frank Hsieh pledged in
Kaohsiung Monday on the eve of his swearing-in as premier to build a
"healthy Taiwan, " saying that the identity of the country should be
shaped by acts rather than words.
</P>
<P>
Chatting with journalists, the premier-designate said he takes
pride in the fact that his experience in governing Kaohsiung City for
the last six years has been mentioned in reports recently as
something of value for his new job as premier.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the country has spent a lot of time discussing
Taiwan's identity, Hsieh said he prefers to shape the country's
identity through action such as the just-launched charter flights
between Taiwan and mainland China. He did not elaborate on how this
might relate to the Taiwan identity issue.
</P>
<P>
He admitted the necessity of the legislature's supervision of the
Executive Yuan but said the supervision should not be just
fault-finding for political purposes.
</P>
<P>
In the working relationship between the Executive Yuan and the
Legislative Yuan, Hsieh said, mutual trust is very important. He
promised to build up the legislature's trust in the Executive Yuan
after he takes office.
</P>
<P>
As for Chen Chih-mai, the Executive Yuan spokesman who has been
named as acting Kaohsiung mayor, Hsieh said Chen is well qualified
for the post and is also popular in Kaohsiung in light of the fact he
was elected legislator in Kaohsiung in 1998 with more ballots than
anyone else.

ARATS HEAD SENDS CONDOLENCES TO SEF CHIEF'S FAMILY
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei, Jan. 31 (CNA)

<TEXT>
<P>
Mainland China's top negotiator with Taiwan
has asked his personal deputies to convey a letter of condolence to
the widow of the late Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) Chairman Koo
Chen-fu, reports from Shanghai said Monday.
</P>
<P>
According to mainland media reports, Wang Daohan, president of
the Beijing-based Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait
(ARATS) , handed the letter to his two deputies -- ARATS Vice
President Sun Yafu, who is concurrently deputy director of the Taiwan
Affairs Office of the mainland's State Council, and ARATS
Secretary-General Li Yafei -- during a meeting in Shanghai earlier in
the day.
</P>
<P>
Wang, who is in his 80s, personally signed the condolence letter
to Cecilia Koo during a brief meeting with his two deputies, the
reports said.
</P>
<P>
Wang was quoted as having said he felt nostalgic about his old
friend Koo, very much wanted to pay his last respects at Koo's
memorial, but was prevented from doing so by ill-health.
</P>
<P>
Sun and Li will attend Koo's funeral, which is scheduled for
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
SEF officials said Ma Xiaoguang, ARATS' research department
chief, will also pay tribute to Koo in Taipei.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Vice Chairman Chiu Tai-san of the Cabinet-level
Mainland Affairs Council, which oversees SEF operations and charts
Taiwan's policy toward the mainland, said the three mainland
visitors' Taipei itinerary will be arranged by the ad hoc commission
handling Koo's funeral, with the SEF offering all necessary
assistance.
</P>
<P>
Koo, a respected business tycoon known for his diplomatic acumen,
held a groundbreaking meeting with Wang in Singapore in 1993 in the
first formal cross-strait contact in more than four decades. He died
Jan. 3 at the age of 88.
</P>
<P>
The historic Koo-Wang meeting laid the framework for the
quasi-official SEF and ARATS to handle cross-strait exchanges in the
absence of official ties. In 1998, the two envoys met again when Koo
traveled to Shanghai and Beijing to boost further rapprochement.
However, Beijing unilaterally suspended regular SEF-ARATS dialogue in
July 1999, when then-ROC President Lee Teng-hui defined cross-strait
ties as state-to-state in nature.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, Chen Yunlin, director of the Taiwan Affairs Office
(TAO) of the State Council, said in Beijing that the three ARATS
officials' Taipei trip is not only aimed at expressing the mainland's
esteem for Koo's contributions to the promotion of cross-strait
relations but also at symbolizing the mainland's respect for the
people of Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
"We hope the trio will convey our remembrance and condolences
during their trip to Taipei," Chen said.
</P>
<P>
Local media reports said three former SEF secretaries-general --
Chen Chang-wen, Chiu chin-yi and Chiao Jen-ho -- plan to jointly host
a dinner in honor of the three ARATS officials Tuesday, but they are
not sure whether the mainland visitors would accept their invitation.

Taipei, Jan. 31 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The 225 newly elected lawmakers of the
Legislative Yuan will meet Tuesday and elect the president and vice
president of the legislature in a fierce race between candidates of
the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) and the opposition
Kuomintang (KMT) and People First Party (PFP).
</P>
<P>
According to the Secretariat of the Legislative Yuan, the
lawmakers should report at between 8:30 a.m. and 9:30 a.m.
</P>
<P>
They must produce a photocopy of their certificates of election
as lawmakers in return for their legislature certificates before being
sworn in en masse.
</P>
<P>
After posing for a group photo, they will vote for the president
at 10:30 a.m.
</P>
<P>
Wang Jin-pyng, who has held the post since 1999, is running for
re-election with the support of the KMT and PFP, which command 114
seats between them.
</P>
<P>
Wang's rival in the race is DPP lawmaker Ker Chien-ming, who has
the support of the 89 DPP lawmakers in addition to the 12 lawmakers
of the DPP's political ally, the Taiwan Solidarity Union.
</P>
<P>
In order to win, Ker and his party are doing their best to win
over the eight lawmakers from the Non Partisan Solidarity Union and
two independents.
</P>
<P>
If no one wins a simple majority in the first round of voting, a
second round should be held immediately, according to the
Secretariat.
</P>
<P>
Another vote will be held in the afternoon for the vice president
position. PFP lawmaker David J. C. Chung is running on the KMT-PFP
ticket, while the DPP has not yet fielded a candidate. In order to
ensure that their lawmakers show up and vote, the KMT, PFP and DPP
have threatened to punish lawmakers who fail to toe the party line in
the voting.

<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Jan.  31 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President Chen Shui-bian is slated to
receive two winners of the first national agriculture awards Friday
at the Presidential Office in recognition of their outstanding
performances, the Council of Agriculture (COA) announced Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Cabinet-level COA, which is in charge of awarding the
country's top national honor for remarkable individuals or groups in
promoting agriculture, said that the two winners, Hsieh Ching-shun
and Hsu Chin-si, will each receive NT$1 million (US$31,450) from the
government.
</P>
<P>
According to COA Vice Chairman Lee Chien-chuan, Hsieh, a
professor from the National Pingtung University of Science and
Technology, won the "agriculture peace prize" for his long-term
efforts to help strengthen Taiwan's relations with friendly countries
such as Burkina Faso, Gambia, Senegal, Swaziland and Malawi with his
rich experience in rice cultivation.
</P>
<P>
Hsieh's expertise not only helped Taiwan agricultural missions in
Africa and Latin America further upgrade their technological levels
but also helped local people in those regions to increase their rice
production, Lee said, adding that this "rice diplomacy" has made
great contributions to bolstering bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
For his part, Hsu, chairman of the Chianan Farm and Irrigation
Association since 1993, who was granted the "agriculture excellent
service prize, " is an exceptional specialist from the grassroots,
Lee said.
</P>
<P>
Hsu has worked at the association for more than 40 years,
devoting most of his life to the improvement of infrastructure and
living standards in rural areas of southern Chiayi and Tainan
counties, Lee said. He added that his winning the prize also
underscores the association's achievements in public service.
</P>
<P>
According to COA officials, the national agriculture awards are
designed to reward each winner in five categories.
</P>
<P>
A total of 51 competitors took part in the selection, but only 10
were screened out of 47 qualified contestants. Hsieh and Hsu got the
two prizes, with three others in the fields of food security,
innovation and eco-friendly conservation not awarded.

NEW CONSTITUTION KEY TO MAKING TAIWAN NORMAL COUNTRY: EX-PRESIDENT
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Jan.  31 (CNA)
(By Huang Kwang-chun)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The writing of a new constitution and
"rectifying" the official designation of the country is key to making
Taiwan a normal country, former President Lee Teng-hui said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a meeting of co-conveners of the pro-Taiwan
independence group "Hand-in-Hand to Protect Taiwan Alliance, " Lee
said that engineering a new constitution and changing the country's
name can be done by the people.
</P>
<P>
The government will follow the people's opinion when 75 percent
of the population reach a consensus on the matters, while foreigners
will have no way to intervene, Lee claimed.
</P>
<P>
Many domestic groups who advocate a Taiwan-centric identity have
a common goal of writing a new constitution for the country and
changing the country's official designation, Lee noted, adding that
the alliance will integrate these resources to continue to fight for
Taiwan's future.
</P>
<P>
He said his victory in Taiwan's first direct presidential
election in 1996 in the face of Beijing's missile intimidation, and
President Chen Shui-bian's triumph in the following two presidential
elections in 2000 and 2004, prove that the people of Taiwan can
choose their own lifestyle.
</P>
<P>
The most important thing for the people of Taiwan this year is to
unite themselves to oppose mainland China's proposed anti-secession
law, the former president said.

CONSTITUTIONAL REFORM IS CONSISTENT WITH U.S. ADVOCACY: PRESIDENT
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Agana,  Guam,  Jan.  31 (CNA)

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Republic of China President Chen
Shui-bian said here Monday that his country's efforts to amend its
Constitution are consistent with U.S. President George W. Bush's
advocacy of the expansion of freedom and democracy.
</P>
<P>
Chen, who made a transit stop in Guam on his way back to Taiwan
after a tour of Palau and the Solomon Islands, told a dinner party
given in his honor by a group of Taiwanese expatriates that Taiwan's
constitutional reforms will not touch on the controversial issues
regarding ROC territory, statehood and whether it will seek permanent
separation from mainland China or not.
</P>
<P>
He said democracy is a universal value that is the basis of the
friendship and cooperation between Taiwan and the United States.
</P>
<P>
Noting that Bush vowed in his second inauguration address to
expand freedom and democracy around the world, Chen said his
country's efforts to reform the Constitution are virtually an echo of
Bush's call.
</P>
<P>
Although the democracy campaign faces challenges around the
world, Chen said, democracy and freedom will prevail eventually.
</P>
<P>
Touting his country as a vital link in the U.S. defense line in
the Western Pacific, which also includes Guam, Chen promised to lead
his country to devote itself to maintaining peace, stability and
prosperity in the region.
</P>
<P>
Chen was expected to leave Guam for Taipei later in the day.
