Food recalls continue to affect thousands of tons of food distributed throughout the U.S. partly because it is now possible to fingerprint the DNA of various bacteria.
Products have been recalled because they fail to meet USDA quality standards or because their production areas were unsanitary; meat products because of listeria monocytogenes and E. coli bacteria; taco shells because they were made with genetically engineered corn that had not been approved for human consumption; and other foods because their labels have failed to identify allergens such as buttermilk or whey as possible ingredients.
