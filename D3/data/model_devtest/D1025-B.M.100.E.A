Arguments for and against delisting grizzly bears continued into 2006.
The New York Times opposed delisting because it would allow the resumption of hunting.
The National Wildlife Federation declared delisting would be a huge success story.
In Canada, in February 2006, an assemblage of leaders from the British Columbia government, Native Canadian Nations, logging companies, and environmental groups announced that 16 million acres along the Pacific Coastline would be protected, 4.4 million acres which teem with grizzlies managed as parkland, and 11.6 million acres under ecosystem management to ensure sustainable forestry with minimal impact on the environment.
