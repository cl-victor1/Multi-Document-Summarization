The trial of the four officers charged in the Diallo case was changed from the minority heavy Bronx to Albany by a State Apeals Court due to media treatment of the case and was to begin 3 January 2000.
The officers, who it was claimed showed a depraved indifference to life, wanted to have the trial decided by a judge vice jury.
Opposition to the venue change came from the New York Times, Al Sharpton, and Winnie Mandella.
New York lawmakers called for the Justice Department to insure no violations of civil rights.
