Postmortems after the Indian Ocean tsunami emphasized the importance of mangroves.
A Paris conference in January 2005 stressed that areas having dense mangrove forests suffered less than those without.
Such countries included India, Malaysia, Sri Lanka, and Indonesia.
However, most countries were still attempting to improve their mangrove defenses.
Malaysia made additional efforts for protection, Sri Lanka enacted laws for protection, Bangladesh sought unsuccessfully to obtain loans for forest protection, and Indonesia gave first priority to forest conservation.
Myanmar took no improvement actions, indicating their unspoiled mangroves had provided them great protection.
