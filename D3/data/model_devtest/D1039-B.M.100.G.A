Amsterdam police arrested six additional Muslims, allegedly conspirators in the killing of Theo van Gogh, whose body was pinned with a note reportedly criticizing a Somalian female member of Parliament for turning away from Islam and the Jewish mayor of Amsterdam for pitting Jews against non-Jews.
Dutch prosecutors stated the killer, now identified anonymously as Mohammed B., who was born and raised locally and apparently underwent a radicalization that pushed him to the attack, would be tried under a new terrorist law.
The killing brought the threat of jihad, holy Islamic war, close to home in the Netherlands.
