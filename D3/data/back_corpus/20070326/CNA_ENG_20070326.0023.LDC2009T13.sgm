PE COLLEGE BUILDING GENOME BANK TO HELP FIND SPORTS STARS

Taipei,  March  26 (CNA) 03/26/07  18:46:39 (By Deborah Kuo)

A research team with Taipei Physical Education College (TPEC) is
building a genome bank of gene samples of talented athletes aimed
at helping identify natural athletes who could be trained into
sports stars.
</P>
<P>
Prof. Hsu Tai-ke, who leads the TPEC research team, said by
collecting saliva of ace athletes, his team can obtain genome
samples of those people who have given extraordinary athletic
performances and find out whether their genes are different from
those of other people.
</P>
<P>
Hsu claimed that by looking at the saliva of New York Yankees
pitcher Wang Chien-ming, the reseachers can find out why Wang
plays so well and whether other children who like to play
baseball could one day become a second Wang Chien- ming.
</P>
<P>
Currently, the TPEC Ace Athlete Genome Bank has collected genetic
samples from several top Taiwan athletes who have won Olympic
medals, including taekwondo fighters Chen Shih-hsin, Chu Mu-yen
and Huang Chih-hsiung.
</P>
<P>
After analyzing the three Olympic medalists' saliva, Hsu said,
the researchers have found that Chen not only have "deletion (D)
" polymorphism in the Angiotensin Converting Enzyme (ACE) gene of
her 17th chromosome, the "insertion (I) " polymorphism -- usually
only found in ace male athletes' genes -- also exists in the ACE
gene of her 17th chromosome.
</P>
<P>
"The researchers thus found the clues to her tremendously
successful performances, " Hsu said. Chen won a gold medal in
taekwondo at the 2004 Athens Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
Her perseverance and training, of couse, also played critical
roles in her success, Hsu admitted.
</P>
<P>
The researchers  also found that both Chu and Huang have
""insertion (I) " polymorphism in the ACE gene of their 17th
chromosome, according to Hsu.
</P>
<P>
Hsu said Taiwan is the trailblazer in terms of using saliva as a
vehicle to examine a talented athlete's genome formation, which
could serve as references when potential athletes are being
selected for professional training.
</P>
<P>
"Asking for 20 c.c. of saliva from an established sports star
like Wang Chien- ming is much easier than asking for 20 c.c. of
blood," Hsu noted.
