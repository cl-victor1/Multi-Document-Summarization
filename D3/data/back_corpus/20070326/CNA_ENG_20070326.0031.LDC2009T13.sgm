The Council of Agriculture (COA) said in a news conference Monday
that it will sponsor 10 promotional activities between now and
April to raise public awareness of pork safety and promote local
pork products.

COA Chairman Su Jia-quan also showed off his "special dish" with
local pork as the main ingredient, while a local chef
demonstrated how to cook an easy pork dish.

Meanwhile, Taiwan Sugar Corp. (Taisugar), the largest hog
producer in Taiwan, said it will comply with demands from an
independent legislator that it cut its hog production by 30
percent by 2008 to help prop up sagging pork prices.
