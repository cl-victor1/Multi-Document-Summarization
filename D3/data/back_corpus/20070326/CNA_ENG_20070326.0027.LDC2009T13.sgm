The Ministry of Education (MOE) will spend NT$44.55 million
(US$1.34 million) this year to subsidize 100 elementary and
junior high schools in developing special features, an MOE
spokesman said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Pan Wen-chung, director of the MOE's Department of Elementary
Education, said the subsidy project is to encourage schools to
develop features that make each one stand out from others by
utilizing community resources and idle school facilities.
</P>
<P>
The MOE selected 100 recipients for the subsidies from among 238
elementary and junior high schools according to their submitted
proposals. The selected schools will develop their own features,
with each one receiving a subsidy ranging from NT$300,000 to
NT$800,000.
</P>
<P>
Pan said the proposals submitted by the selected schools showed
creativity in presenting each school's features.  Some schools
proposed developing features based on the tea or oyster
industries in their locales,  while others proposed making use of
community resources such as experimental farms or art workshops
to build related learning environments for students.
</P>
<P>
The schools will create space to allow parents to learn along
with their children, as well as attracting visitors to experience
the different learning environments, said Pan.
