ECONOMIC MINISTER DENIES LOBBYING OVER TV SHARES
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  March 26 (CNA) 03/26/07  18:20:32 (By Y.C. Jou)

<P>
Minister of Economic Affairs Steve Chen denied Monday an
accusation by an official of Japan's Fuji Television Network that
he lobbied the TV station to sell its holdings in Taiwan
Television Enterprise (TTV) to the Liberty Times Group, claiming
that he was "only making polite small talk."
</P>
<P>
Sumio Hasegawa, an assistant to the chairman of Fuji TV, claimed
a day earlier in a news conference that Government Information
Office (GIO) Minister Cheng Wen-tsang invited him to lunch Jan.
17 and recommended the sale idea.
</P>
<P>
According to Hasegawa, Chen also told him that the government had
expressed the same wish to two other Japanese companies that hold
TTV shares and that it hoped Fuji TV would act in line with this
wish.
</P>
<P>
"The Ministry of Economic Affairs has no intention, position or
clout to intervene in the transaction of TTV shares, " Chen said,
adding that the ministry made no contact with Fuji TV either
before or after that lunch meeting.
</P>
<P>
"The fact that Fuji TV eventually sold its TTV shares to Lai Kuo-
chou proves that the deal was not influenced by the lunch
meeting," according to Chen.
</P>
<P>
Lai was chairman of the state-controlled TTV before being
replaced last week for setting up a company to purchase TTV
shares from its Japanese investors.
</P>
<P>
The National Communications Commission (NCC) in November 2006
decided that foreign companies should release their shareholdings
in Taiwan's terrestrial TV stations.
</P>
<P>
Chen said his ministry is willing to pass on requests on behalf
of domestic enterprises but will not intervene in actual
discussions, "which are left to the parties involved."
