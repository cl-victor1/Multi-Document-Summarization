An upgraded indigenous defense fighter (IDF), known locally as
the Ching-kuo jet fighter in memory of the late President Chiang
Ching-kuo, will make its debut at an Aerospace Industrial
Development Corp. (AIDC) plant in central Taiwan Tuesday.

<P>
President Chen Shui-bian will preside over the inaugural ceremony
at the AIDC factory complex in Taichung County's Shalu township,
during which the Ching-kuo fighter will be renamed the Chingkuo
Imposing Eagle.

The locally developed and manufactured IDFs have been in service
for more than 10 years. The Ministry of National Defense (MND)
has budgeted NT$7 billion for a mid-life upgrade of the 130 IDFs
in the Air Force's combat wings.

The state-run AIDC was commissioned to carry out the IDF's mid-
life upgrade project in cooperation  with the military-run
Chungshan Institute of Science and Technology.

As part of the upgrade, the IDF has been fit with additional
tanks to increase its ability to stay in the air, defense
officials said, adding that the plane's avionics has also been
upgraded through the installation of a new flight control
computer system.

Moreover, the officials said, the plane's structure has been
strengthened to enhance its weaponry capacity, with the number of
Tienchien (Skysword) II air- to-air missiles mounted rising from
two to four.

Both the single-seater and twin-seater IDFs have undergone mid-
life upgrade, defense officials said.
