<P>
Taiwan will probably need more than 100,000 additional employees
in six major high-tech sectors over the next three years, the
Science and Technology Advisory Group under the Executive Yuan
predicted Monday.
</P>
<P>
The six sectors refer to semiconductor, image display, digital
content, biotechnology, telecommunications, and information
service, which will need 107,000 new workers over the next three
years.
</P>
<P>
Among them, the demand for IC talent will be 35,800, followed by
19,500 in the digital content sector.
</P>
<P>
The group made the prediction in a meeting with the Industrial
Technology Research Institute of Taiwan, the Institute for
Information Industry and the Development Center for Biotechnology
to review the supply and demand of Taiwan high-tech talent
between 2007 and 2009.
</P>
<P>
They said the outlook of Taiwan's industry will continue to grow
in the period and estimated that the demand for new high-tech
talent will be 107,000 over the period, although the supply from
the higher education institutions will only be around 101,000.
