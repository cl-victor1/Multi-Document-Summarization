A charity organization in Taiwan has launched a drive to
encourage the public to hug every day, an act they claimed makes
people healthier, a spokesman for the charity said Monday.
</P>
<P>
The drive was announced Sunday at a ceremony that the Eden Social
Welfare Foundation held to mark its 25th anniversary.
</P>
<P>
The charity urged the public to give handicapped people warmth
and confidence by hugging them.
</P>
<P>
The charity quoted the late U.S. psychotherapist Virginia Satir
as saying that people need four hugs per day merely to survive,
eight hugs per day to maintain oneself at a strong emotional
level, and 12 hugs per day to grow and become a better person.
</P>
<P>
On the 25th day of every month this year, the charity's staff
will raise "hugs" on the street from the public, the spokesman
added.
