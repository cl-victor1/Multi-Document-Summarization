TAIWAN STANDS GOOD CHANCE OF JOINING IHR THIS YEAR: DOH HEAD
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  March 26 (CNA) 03/26/07  13:13:34 (By Deborah Kuo)
</P>
<P>
Taiwan stands a good chance of joining World Health Organization
(WHO) activities this year under the "Principle  of Universality"
stipulated  in the revised  WHO International Health Regulations
(IHR) expected to go into effect later this year, Taiwan's top
health official said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Fielding questions at the Legislative Yuan, Department of Health
(DOH) Minister Hou Sheng-mao said Taiwan has a "90-percent
chance" of being included in WHO activities after the revised IHR
takes effect this year.
</P>
<P>
Hou said Taiwan has tried for 10 consecutive years to join the
World Health Assembly (WHA), the highest decision-making body of
the WHO, as an observer, but the efforts have been in vain due to
China's obstruction.
</P>
<P>
The adverse situation, however, is likely to change this year,
after the revised IHR takes effect, Hou noted. The WHA agreed in
May 2005 to include the "Principle of Universality" in its
revised IHR, so that all countries, regions and organizations can
work together for the improvement of health conditions for all of
humankind.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan believes that the IHR will provide a legal basis for the
country to participate in WHO activities beginning this year when
the regulations go into effect, Hou said, adding that Taiwan is
also hoping to establish a cooperation and exchange framework
with the WHO under the "Principle of Universality" and other
related regulations.
</P>
<P>
"The picture is expected to become clearer by mid-May, " Hou
added.
</P>
<P>
Opposition Kuomintang Legislator Lai Shyh-bao asked Hou why he
doesn't travel to China to negotiate in person with Beijing
officials to facilitate the application of the IHR to Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Hou said he would not spare any efforts or pass up any
opportunities to communicate with Chinese officials in terms of
Taiwan's WHO membership bid, adding that he had made his position
clearly known to China's Health Minister Gao Qiang during an
international health meeting held in Geneva last year. As to his
traveling to China, Hou said, this is a matter that should be
decided by officials from other Cabinet agencies, particularly
the Mainland Affairs Council.
