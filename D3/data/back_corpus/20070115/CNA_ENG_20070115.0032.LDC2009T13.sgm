Bad debts totalling around NT$375 billion (US$11.44 billion) have
been written off in the past 10 years, lawmakers  who
participated  in a closed-door  meeting of the legislature's
Finance Committee said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Officials of the Financial Supervisory Commission (FSC), which is
busy smoothing over the financial disturbances caused by a run
that started Jan. 5 at the Chinese Bank, took part in the meeting
and reported on how banking institutes around the country manage
non-performing loans and bad debts.
</P>
<P>
Citing data offered by the FSC, the legislators said that a total
of 1,471 bad loan delinquents, each of whom owed banks at least
NT$100 million, defaulted repayment of their debts during the
period from 1997 to November 2006.
</P>
<P>
In 2006, bad loans of NT$172.3 billion were written off, marking
a gradual decline in terms of the amount of bad loans over the
years, they said, citing Chung Huei-chen, deputy director of the
FSC's banking affairs bureau.
</P>
<P>
The run on the Chinese Bank was triggered by the announcement of
insolvency petitions lodged by two companies affiliated to the
Rebar Group, which also owns the bank.
</P>
<P>
Rebar Group Chairman Wang You-theng and his wife went on the run
in China before the insolvency petition was announced Jan. 4 --
an incident that shook public confidence in the domestic
financial market and pushed the Central Insurance Deposit
Corporation to take over the troubled bank and reimburse
customers' deposits. The Wangs later escaped from China to the
United States.
