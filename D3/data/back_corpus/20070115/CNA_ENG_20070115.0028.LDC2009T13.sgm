<P>
The main opposition Kuomintang's (KMT's) candidate for the 2008
presidential election will probably be announced in late April or
early May, according to the party's initial plan Monday.
</P>
<P>
The initial plan will be sent to a team of the KMT Central
Standing Committee for discussion before its finalization at a
committee meeting Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
According to the plan, the KMT will announce its primary March 1.
Public opinion polls will then be held between April 11-13, and
party members will vote April 15.
</P>
<P>
Public polls will account for 70 percent of the primary results,
while the party vote will account for the other 30 percent. It is
estimated that the final result will come out in 15 days.
</P>
<P>
After a presidential candidate is announced, the candidate will
propose a candidate for the vice presidency. The ticket will then
be sent to the national party congress for approval.
</P>
<P>
KMT Chairman Ma Ying-jeou is the party's most likely bet for
presidential candidate, although National Taiwan University
Professor Huang Kuang-kuo is the only person so far to have
openly bid for the nomination. But since Huang only had his party
membership reinstated Jan. 2, his chances of being nominated are
minimal.
</P>
<P>
KMT regulations state that only who have resumed membership for
more than four months are eligible for party nomination.
