Taiwan young people's enthusiasm for donating blood appears to
have been fading over the past five years, with the percentage of
first-time donors dropping from 29.16 percent in 2001 to 17.81
percent in 2005, according to statistics released Monday by the
Taipei-based Chinese Blood Services Foundation (CBSF).
</P>
<P>
People aged between 17 and 30 have been the country's largest
group of first- time blood donors, according to the statistics,
which also show that more than 1.57 million people in Taiwan
donated blood in 2006, accounting for 6.91 percent of Taiwan's
population.
</P>
<P>
The blood donation rate in Taiwan in 2006 was at a low level
compared to previous years but was still higher than the average
of 5 percent to 6 percent in the international community, CBSF
chief executive Chang Ying-er said.
</P>
<P>
Chang said the foundation has been holding campaigns regularly in
high schools, colleges and universities as part of efforts to
boost young people's willingness to donate blood for those in
urgent need.
</P>
<P>
If enthusiasm continues to decline, then the country could suffer
from a shortage of blood, Chang warned, noting that the
foundation is planning to kick off a nationwide "Blood Donation
Month" campaign Tuesday in the hopes of boosting the number of
blood donors.
