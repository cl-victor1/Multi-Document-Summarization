WANTED NOTICES ISSUED FOR REBAR FOUNDER, WIFE
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  Jan.  15 (CNA) 01/15/07  16:05:56 (By Deborah Kuo)
</P>
<P>
The Taipei District Prosecutor's Office formally issued wanted
notices for the arrest of the founder of financially troubled
Rebar Asia Pacific Group and his fourth wife Monday on charges of
embezzlement, insider trading and fraud.
</P>
<P>
Presiding Prosecutor Lin Chin-tsun said the orders for the arrest
of Rebar group founder Wang You-theng and his wife, Chin Shih-
ying, will be effective until May 2031.
</P>
<P>
Two subsidiaries of the Rebar Group, which consists of 120-odd
subsidiaries, applied for insolvency protection Dec. 29, and Wang
and his wife reportedly fled to China Dec. 30.
</P>
<P>
The insolvency reorganization announcement of the two Rebar
subsidiaries -- China Rebar Co. and Chia Hsin Food &amp;
Synthetic Fiber Co. -- prompted a run on the Chinese Bank,
another Rebar affiliate, which lost NT$32 billion (US$977.3
million) in deposits in three days.
</P>
<P>
The bank run led to the exposure of the Rebar financial flop,
which has in turn triggered a financial storm in Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
The investigators searched Chin Shih-ying's office at the Chinese
Bank last week and seized more than 10 boxes of documents as
evidence unfavorable to the Wang couple and those who stand
accused in the Rebar scandals.
</P>
<P>
Ensuing investigation results also prompted a decision by the
Taipei Prosecutor's Office last Friday to prohibit a total of 48
Rebar group executives and Wang family members from leaving
Taiwan. The charges include breach of trust, forgery, fraud,
insider trading, embezzlement of corporate funds, and violations
of the banking law and accounting regulations.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Lin declined to confirm Monday whether Gary Wang, one
of the founder's sons who heads Eastern Multimedia Group, is
included on the list of executives prohibited from leaving the
country. Gary Wang has said his group is a separate company and
denied involvement in any Rebar-related scandals.
</P>
<P>
Unconfirmed sources said Sunday that the Rebar founder and his
wife had left China Saturday for the United States.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, according to Zhang Xiaoqiang, vice minister of China's
State Development and Reform Commission, who is currently
visiting in Taipei, the Chinese authorities are unlikely to allow
"unworthy businessmen" to sneak into China to hide out there.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan's chief financial regulator, Shih Jun-ji, who is chairman
of the Financial Supervisory Commission (FSC), resigned Saturday
over the Rebar financial scandals.
</P>
<P>
The Rebar group employs more than 5,000 people, and many of them
have joined forces to organize a self-help association aimed at
protecting their legitimate rights, an association spokesman
said, adding that judicial authorities' decision to freeze the
assets of the two affiliates under bankrupt restructuring
proceedings are forcing them out of work.
