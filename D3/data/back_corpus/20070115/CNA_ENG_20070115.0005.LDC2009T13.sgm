Taipei,  Jan.  14 (CNA) 01/15/07  10:37:36 (By Sofia Wu)

<P>
Premier Su Tseng-chang has directed the Mainland Affairs Council
(MAC)  and the quasi-official Straits Exchange  Foundation  (SEF)
to negotiate  with China for the repatriation of Rebar Asia
Pacific Group founder Wang You-theng, Cabinet spokesman Cheng
Wen-tsang said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Cheng made the remarks after Su called a meeting of senior
officials to discuss the Rebar financial fiasco issue. Among
those present at the meeting were Vice Premier Tsai Ing-wen,
ministers of finance, economics, interior and justice as well as
heads of the central bank, the Financial Supervisory Commission
(FSC) and the Council for Economic Planning and Development.
</P>
<P>
According to Cheng, the Taiwan High Prosecutor's Office has
formed a special task force to investigate the a spate of
corporate crimes allegedly involving many of the Rebar's 120-odd
subsidiaries after two affiliates -- China Rebar Co. and Chia
Hsin Food &amp; Synthetic Fiber Co., applied for insolvency
protection late last year which triggered a run on the Chinese
Bank, also a Rebar offshoot.
</P>
<P>
During Sunday's meeting, Cheng said, Premier Su ordered the
Ministry of Justice, the National Immigration Agency and the
FSC's bureau of inspection and banking affairs to assist in
judicial probes into Rebar operations and its suspected
irregularities.
</P>
<P>
The group's 82-year-old founder, Wang You-theng, had fled to
China with his fourth wife before prosecutors issued a warrant
banning the couple and many of their family members and Rebar
executives from leaving the country pending investigations.
</P>
<P>
The crimes allegedly committed by Rebar affiliates included
insider trading, phony accounting practices, fraud, forgery and
violations of the banking law and accounting regulations.
</P>
<P>
Noting that many of the Rebar group's suspected irregularities
could be tracked to the previous Kuomintang administration era,
Cheng said the Rebar incident should be defined as a case
involving "transitional justice" that should be pursued to the
full extent of law to quell public discontent over the
government's failure to prevent occurrence of all those corporate
scandals.
</P>
<P>
If necessary, Cheng said, Premier Su will publicly urge Beijign
to repatriate Wang You-theng to facilitate investigations.
