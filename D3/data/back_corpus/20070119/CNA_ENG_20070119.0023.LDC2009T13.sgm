The Council of Indigenous People (CIP) will move forward a six-
year  program for the revitalization  and development of Taiwan's
indigenous languages this year, a CIP official said Friday.
</P>
<P>
CIP Education and Culture Section Chief Wang Chiou-i said that to
maintain an indigenous tribal language, the language must be
spoken by at least 75 percent of the tribe.

<P>
He noted that many aboriginal tribes in Taiwan are facing a
language endangerment  crisis,  such as the Thao,  Saaroa and
Kanakanabu,  with only senior citizens  speaking  their tribal
languages, adding that the government needs to speed up measures
to save these languages.
</P>
<P>
He said the program covers several measures to regenerate
indigenous languages, including enacting relevant statues,
setting up a promotion organization to compile dictionaries  and
language teaching materials, training teachers, creating language
immersion environments,  using high-tech teaching tools,
establishing  a certification system for language proficiency and
encouraging the learning of traditional and contemporary folk
songs.
