The U.S. and Japanese militaries are scheduled to conduct joint
exercises Jan. 29 to Feb. 8 to practice dealing with any crises
that might break out on the Korean Peninsula or in the Taiwan
Strait, Japan's Defense Agency reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The joint drills are aimed at thrashing out procedures of
cooperation between Japan's self-defense forces and the U.S.
military stationed in Japan in the event of a conflict on the
Korean Peninsula or in the Taiwan Strait, JDA officials said.
</P>
<P>
A total of 1,350 members of the Defense Agency and the Japan
Self-Defense Forces are expected to be joined by 3,100 U.S.
troops for the exercises -- the second of their kind since
February 2006.
</P>
<P>
Any Japanese military contribution would be limited under Japan's
Constitution, but the United States and Japan have agreed to have
Japanese troops provide rear-area  support,  including  supply,
transport and medical services, if conflict breaks out in the
region, the JDA officials said.
