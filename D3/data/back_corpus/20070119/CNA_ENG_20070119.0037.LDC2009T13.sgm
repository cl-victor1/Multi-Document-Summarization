The National Palace Museum (NPM) will reopen its San Hsi Tang
Tearoom Saturday as a prelude to its long-expected reopening
scheduled for February after a three-year renovation project on
the main building.
</P>
<P>
NPM Director Lin Mun-lee said she hopes the renovated tearoom,
originally built based on the furnishings of Ching Emperor Chien
Lung's study, will serve as a space for the public to "experience
a new living aestheticism."
</P>
<P>
San Hsi Tang was the name for the Chien Lung study and means in
Chinese "a room keeping three pieces of unusual cultural
treasure, " which are all calligraphic works.
</P>
<P>
Chen Ruey-hsien, a designer in charge of the tearoom renovation,
said he expects the old tearoom with a new face will become a
place for leisure or business activities.
