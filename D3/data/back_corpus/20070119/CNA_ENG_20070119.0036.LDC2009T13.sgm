GOVERNMENT TO SPEND NT$950 MILLION ON OUTLYING ISLANDS: CEPD
</HEADLINE>

The nation's top economic planning agency passed a proposal
Friday for the second-stage development of several outlying
islands between 2007 and 2010 with the budget for this year set
at around NT$950 million (US$2.89 million).
</P>
<P>
The Council for Economic Planning and Development (CEPD) said the
proposal, part of a sustainable development program for the
outlying islands approved by the Executive Yuan, will be sent to
a committee under the Executive Yuan for approval Feb. 12.
</P>
<P>
The proposal calls for moving Kinmen toward the goal of becoming
an international tourism and leisure island, hoping to make use
of battle relics on the island, a former frontline outpost of the
1950s, as well as its close economic interactions with Taiwan
proper and China's Fujian Province across the Taiwan Strait.
</P>
<P>
The Penghu will be developed into a "pearl of the sea" under the
proposal, CEPD officials said. The government will step up
preservation of natural resources and culture, promote a
pollution-free living environment and develop specific industries
on the island, they said.
</P>
<P>
Residents of Matsu island, now that troop strength has been
decreased there, can use the former military bases to grow
organic vegetables and fruit. In addition, because of its
proximity to Fuzhou, Fujian Province, it can also serve as a
destination for Fuzhou people.
</P>
<P>
Development of Green Island, Orchid Island and Liuchiu Island
will also progress with emphasis on their marine features.
