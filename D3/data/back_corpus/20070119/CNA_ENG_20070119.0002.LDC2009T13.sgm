DPP TO PROPOSE EXTRAORDINARY LEGISLATIVE SESSION

The ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) will bring forward
a motion to convene an extraordinary legislature session if the
Central Government General Budget Bill 2007 fails to pass Friday,
the last day of this session, DPP caucus leader Ker Chien-ming
said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Ker said a failure of the General  Budget Bill would be
unprecedented in the country's history, but this seems likely as
the opposition Kuomintang (KMT) has adopted a"scorched earth
policy".
</P>
<P>
The KMT insists on legislating into law the Organic Act of the
Central Election Commission prior to passing the General Budget
Bill. In the election commission bill, the KMT introduces a
system of proportional representation by party to the nomination
of commission members, a system with which the DPP disagrees.
</P>
<P>
Party caucuses are scheduled to negotiate over the election
commission bill Friday. Ker said the DPP will definitely propose
an extraordinary session if the General Budget Bill remains
blocked and it will be KMT Chairman Ma Ying-jeou who will face
the public's anger.
</P>
<P>
However, Tseng Yung-Chuan, Executive Director of KMT's Central
Policy Committee, said this was merely a DPP trick to block the
election commission bill at the expense of the General Budget
Bill and to shift blame to the KMT.
