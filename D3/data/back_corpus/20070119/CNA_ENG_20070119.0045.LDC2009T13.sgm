KMT URGED NOT TO MEDDLE WITH ELECTION COMMISSION

After a physical conflict between lawmakers of the ruling and
opposition parties in the Legislative Yuan over a draft  bill
over  the organization  of the Central  Election Commission(CEC)
Friday, Executive Yuan spokesman, Cheng Wen- tsang asked KMT
Chairman Ma Ying-jeou not try to undermine the independence and
impartiality of the supreme election organization.
</P>
<P>
Cheng said in an interview that the opposition party, in an
attempt to control the CEC, had insisted on adopting a
proportional representation system in naming CEC members. Such a
system would make the CEC another National Communications
Commission, which had already been ruled as unconstitutionally by
the Council of Grand Justices because its members are named
basically by various parties.
</P>
<P>
Cheng asked Ma not to force through the unconstitutional CEC
organic bill for partisan purposes of preempting a DPP-initiated
referendum on KMT's "ill-gotten" assets and seeking unfair favor
in the next presidential election.
</P>
<P>
During an interview in Hualien, Ma said the existing structure of
CEC organization is unreasonable as the ruling party controls 15
of a total 17 seats, which makes any electoral reform not serving
DPP's interests impossible. He expressed his hope that the ruling
party would not block the bill.
