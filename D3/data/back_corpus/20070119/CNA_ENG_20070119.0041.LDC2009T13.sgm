An extraordinary board session of the financially troubled Asia
Pacific Broadband Telecom (APBT) Friday elected  company  Vice
Chairman,  Wang  Lin- tai,  to act  as Interim-Chairperson.
</P>
<P>
APBT Managing Director Chen Feng-nan said at an after-meeting
news conference that such an arrangement was designed to maintain
stable operations and to protect the rights of customers,
employees and shareholders. Chen is Director- General of the
Taiwan Rail Administration, the largest public sector shareholder
of the APBT. The government controls around 15 percent of APBT
shareholdings.

Chen said other resolutions adopted in the board meeting included
a resolution that the APBT should cooperate with the prosecutors'
investigation into suspected economic crimes, and that the
company should provide all necessary financial information to the
Small Business Integrated Assistance Foundation, an affiliate
with the Ministry of Economic Affairs, and designated
accountants.

Asked about the APBT's net value per share, Chen said it will
take one and a half to two months of audits for a clarifying
report to come out.

The APBT, an unlisted company with capitalization of NT$65.68
billion, suffered financial difficulties associated with the
Rebar Asia Pacific Group crisis. Former Chairperson Wang Chin
Shih-ying is now on the run in the United States on insider
trading and embezzlement charges. The government had been invited
by Wang Lin-tai to intervene and assist.
