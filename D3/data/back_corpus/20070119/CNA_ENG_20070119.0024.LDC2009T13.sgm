FORMAL KMT-PFP ALLIANCE UNDER WAY
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  Jan. 19 (CNA) 01/19/07  18:09:57 (By Flor Wang)

Amid speculation that a formal alliance of the main opposition
Kuomintang (KMT) and the People First Party (PFP) will soon
begin, a KMT official said Friday that the proposal must be
approved by the chairmen of the two parties.
</P>
<P>
KMT spokesman Su Chun-pin made the remarks while answering
questions from reporters during a trip accompanying KMT Chairman
Ma Ying-jeou to eastern Hualien County. Ma was reluctant to field
political questions.
</P>
<P>
Noting that communication between the two parties is smooth and
faring well, Su said that the creation of a formal KMT-PFP
alliance, no matter which form such an alliance would take, must
be clinched by Ma and PFP Chairman James Soong, who is on
vacation in the United States after his defeat in last year's
Dec. 9 Taipei mayoral election.

In response to a question on whether the two parties are likely
to ink an accord through video conferencing, Su said that all
means are possible but not yet decided. The two parties are
poised to step up cooperation on a wide range of issues,
including future elections, he added.
</P>
<P>
PFP lawmaker and spokesman Lee Hung-chun said that it is
important that the proposed KMT-PFP alliance kicks off operations
as soon as possible. Collaboration between the two parties will
be a major force stabilizing Taiwan's politics, he claimed.
</P>
<P>
Lee said that a formal alliance is expected to begin operations
in the near future, now that the secretaries-general of the two
parties have been negotiating on the issue.
</P>
<P>
According to Soong's aides, the top priority of the proposed
alliance is to field qualified candidates to run in December's
legislative elections through negotiations.
</P>
<P>
It would be more feasible for the opposition "pan-blue alliance"
of the KMT, the PFP and the small New Party to win the 2008
presidential election if the KMT and the PFP are able to control
more than half of the seats in the next Legislative Yuan
following the year-end elections, the aides said.
