An Indonesian wood-hulled vessel that was grounded off the
Kending National Pakk last July was removed recently after more
than a month of work, park administration officials reported
Friday.

<P>
The 40-ton Anak Nusantara was grounded near Olunpi after being
caught in a typhoon. The hull was seriously damaged and the
vessel was unable to continue its voyage to Hong Kong.

<P>
The officials said that although the Indonesian  ship was
completely removed, the wreckage of grounded Greek freighter the
Amorgos has sunk into the sea off nearby Lungkeng, posing a
threat to the marine ecology in the area.
</P>
<P>
The officials said they will continue to work with scholars to
monitor the ecology around Lungkeng and to remove more wreckage,
despite a limited budget.

The 35,000-ton freighter, carrying mineral ore from India, was on
its way to China when it lost ground and ran onto a reef in
January 2001.
