Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Ma Ying-jeou believes that allowing
Chinese students to study in Taiwan is a creative way to reduce
cross-Taiwan Strait tensions, so long as the policy does not
affect Taiwan's security and interests.
</P>
<P>
Ma made the remarks in response to questions during a meeting
with grass-roots KMT members in Taichung County Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman quoted Ma as saying that implementing the policy
would help Taiwan colleges and universities which are competing
with one other to recruit an ever shrinking supply of local
students.
</P>
<P>
It would also promote exchanges between students in China and
Taiwan and give Taiwan leverage in its dealings with Beijing
through China's students educated in Taiwan, Ma said.
</P>
<P>
Noting that Chinese students studying abroad spend a total of
about 15 billion yuan (US$1.92 billion) a year, the KMT chief
said it will be aplus for Taiwan's economy if the island can get
a fraction of that amount by attracting Chinese students to study
here.
</P>
<P>
The exchanges would improve bilateral ties in the long term, Ma
said, pointing to the possible scenario of China's chief Taiwan
affairs official having been educated in Taiwan or Taiwan's top
Chinese affairs official having studied in China.
