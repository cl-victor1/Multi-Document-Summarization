to move to the county and local residents to have more children
in an effort to increase the population to over 1.25 million.

According to the county's Personnel Office, once the population
reaches 1.25 million, the number of deputy magistrates will be
increased from one to two, the number of county advisers will be
increased from seven to eight, the number of bureaus will be
increased from 18 to 19, and the number of county government
staff will also be boosted.

3,000 per year since 2002. The county government has offered
incentives to women to have more children. Pregnant women from
low income homes are entitled to a subsidy of NT$10,200, while 15
townships in the county also offer subsidies of between NT$2,000
