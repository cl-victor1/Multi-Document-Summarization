KMT CHAIRMAN RULES OUT TAIWAN INDEPENDENCE
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  Jan. 27 (CNA) 01/27/07  16:03:05 (By Flor Wang)

Main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Ma Ying-jeou ruled out
Taiwan independence Saturday, saying that the KMT stands firm on
maintaining the Republic of China's current constitutional system
and its official designation.
</P>
<P>
Ma made the comments at a seminar sponsored by the KMT's Taichung
County committee in central Taiwan in response to a party
member's question regarding the party's stance on the country's
future -- formal independence or unification with China.
</P>
<P>
Stressing that the KMT will not pursue formal independence to
avoid conflict in the Taiwan Strait and internal confrontation in
Taiwan, Ma said that the country also has to take into account
concerns from the United States and Japan involving these issues.
</P>
<P>
Ma also reiterated his resolve to reform the party and insisted
that there is no need for the KMT to change its name now or in
the future.
</P>
<P>
Pointing out that he has no plan at all to change the party's
name for the time being, Ma pledged that there will also be no
need for the KMT to alter its official designation in the future.
</P>
<P>
"The KMT must prioritize its reform tasks now instead of devoting
its energy to controversial issues such as a name change," Ma
said.
</P>
<P>
The KMT chairman has been viewed by many as the opposition "pan-
blue alliance's" best bet for the 2008 presidential election, and
some have suggested that he take "China" out of the party's name
in a bid to win greater support from median voters.
