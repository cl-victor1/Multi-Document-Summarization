Taipei,  Jan. 27 (CNA) 01/27/07  20:52:37 (By Lilian Wu)
</P>
<P>
The Council of Agriculture (COA) announced a new planned
production mechanism Saturday to ensure that the supply and
demand of major agricultural products is in balance.
</P>
<P>
COA officials said that they have chosen seven major agricultural
products -- namely bananas, oranges, papayas, pineapples, garlic,
onions and peanuts -- to be covered by the new mechanism.
</P>
<P>
The officials expressed the hope that the new mechanism will help
establish a planned production and a pre-warning system so as to
avoid repeating the same mistakes of overproduction seen in past
years.
</P>
<P>
Under the new mechanism, growers of the seven agricultural
products will file production reports, and in return, they will
receive production and marketing assistance from the COA, the
officials said.
</P>
<P>
The COA will gauge the average consumption levels in the nation
as well as the data on the exports and imports of specific
agricultural products in setting annual production targets for
major agricultural products.
</P>
<P>
The COA will make adjustments in the growing areas of the major
agricultural products every year and estimate the production
three months prior to the harvest for reference in adjusting
growing areas.
</P>
<P>
If the reported production comes close to the production target,
or if the COA estimates that there will a supply and demand
imbalance, the council will immediately disseminate the
information and make contingency plans.
</P>
<P>
If the COA estimates that there could be a glut, then it will
advise farmers to grow other crops or take other steps.
</P>
<P>
During the harvest period, if the selling price of the produce is
close to the production cost, the COA will also initiate such
measures as promotion, storage as well as processing to stabilize
prices.
