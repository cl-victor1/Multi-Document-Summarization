<P>
The existing limitations on the amount that private universities
can charge in tuition and other relevant fees should be relaxed,
a former president of National Taiwan University (NTU) suggested
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Chen Wei-jao said he doubts Taiwan will have an excellent
academic institute like Harvard University in the United States
if the government continues to refuse to raise tuition ceilings.
</P>
<P>
Chen made the suggestion at a farewell party that NTU held for
him ahead of his retirement on Feb. 1.
</P>
<P>
The respected university president and professor of medicine said
private universities should be allowed to charge higher tuitions
in order to have more money to improve their education quality.
</P>
<P>
Chen, who is the first NTU president elected through a democratic
process, has held the post since 1993. In 1979, he became the
first surgeon in Taiwan to successfully separate conjoined twins.
