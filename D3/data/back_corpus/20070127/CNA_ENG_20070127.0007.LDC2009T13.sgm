A special exhibition of more than 500 original drafts and objects
left by three Russian literary icons opened Friday at the
National Taiwan Museum in Taipei and will continue until March
25.

The event, sponsored by the Council for Cultural Affairs, with
support from Russia's State Museum and Exhibition Center and
three other museums, was moved to Taipei from southern Taiwan
after an exhibition at the National Museum of Taiwan Literature
in Tainan from Nov. 12 last year until Jan. 12.

Altogether, 504 original drafts and objects from three of
Russia's greatest writers -- Aleksandr S. Pushkin (1799-1837),
Leo Tolstoy (1828-1910) and Mikhail Sholokov (1905-1984) -- are
on display.

Premier Su Tseng-chang, Examination Yuan President Yao Chia-wen,
Council of Cultural Affairs Chairman Chiu Kun-liang and Valadimir
Tolstoy, curator of the Leo Tolstoy Museum in Moscow, were among
other invited guests who attended the opening ceremony of the
exhibition.

telling by scholars and the showing of feature films, including
"War and Peace," "Onegin," "And Quiet Flows the Don," and "Anna
Karenina."

greatest Russian poet and the founder of modern Russian
literature, while Tolstoy, widely regarded as one of the greatest
of all novelists, is particularly noted for his masterpieces War
and Peace and Anna Karenina.
