Taipei, Jan. 27 (CNA) 01/27/07  18:05:01 (By Flor Wang)

President Chen Shui-bian said Saturday that only those candidates
who insist on Taiwan identity have a chance of winning the 2008
presidential election because by that time, a majority of the
people will identify themselves as Taiwanese rather than as
Chinese.
</P>
<P>
Chen made the remarks in an interview on the "Talk Asia" program
on the CNNI channel.

Expressing his belief that more than 60 percent of Taiwan's
people will identify themselves as "Taiwanese" by the time of the
next presidential election, Chen said that only the candidate
upholding Taiwan identity will be able to garner a majority of
the votes, adding that he was basing his supposition on the fact
that he garnered about 1.5 million more votes in the 2004
presidential election than he did in the 2000 race.
</P>
<P>
Chen also brushed aside rampant allegations that he orchestrated
the March 19 election-eve shooting in 2004 to win sympathy votes
and get re-elected, calling the main opposition Kuomintang a
"sore loser" for trying to ascribe its election failure "to the
two bullets."
</P>
<P>
Chen said he hopes to serve as a volunteer dedicated to
reinforcing Taiwan's democracy and raising the public's "Taiwan
first" awareness after his term as president ends in May 2008.
</P>
<P>
Voicing his desire to be remembered by the Taiwan people as a
president fully devoted to safeguarding Taiwan's sovereignty and
democratic practices during his eight years in office, Chen said
that he strongly believes that his name will be cleared after the
current political storm settles.
