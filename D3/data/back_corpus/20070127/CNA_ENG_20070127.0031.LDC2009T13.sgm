Chan Yung-jan and Chuang Chia-jung, the two woman tennis players
returned to the island Saturday evening after winning the second
place in the women's double at the Australian Open tennis
championships in Melbourne Friday.

They were mobbed by their family members, friends and fans as
soon as they appeared  in the lobby  of the Taiwan  Taoyuan
International Airport's terminal in Taoyuan, northern Taiwan.

<P>
Both women received a huge bouquet and a warm hug from their
mother.

Asked about their feelings of becoming the country's first pair
of tennis players ever make it to the final of any grand slam
tournament, Chuang Chia-jung said it was a pleasant surprise,
while Chan Yung-jan said it was a great pressure to learn that a
lot of people at home will pin their hope on them to win the
title.

Both of them said the experience to compete against the world's
first class players in Melbourne will help them sharp their skill
further.

Their mothers said they were satisfied with their daughters'
performance at the Aussie Open although they lost the final to
Zimbabwe's Cara Black and South Africa's Liezel Huber.

The two women's mothers also said they appreciated local people's
encouragement and support when their daughters defeated a Chinese
pair to gain a berth in the final.

before returning to their homes in Kaohsiung.
