Taiwan's economic monitoring indicator for Dec. 2006 showed
a"blue light""-- which indicates a recession -- for the first
time since Jun. 2003, but economic officials said Friday it was a
result of a comparison with more positive performance in the same
month a year earlier and they remain optimistic on the economic
outlook.

The Council for Economic Planning and Development (CEPD) Friday
published December's monitoring indicator. The total score for
the month dropped five points to 16, triggering a blue light
after six consecutive months yellow-blue. It was also the first
blue light, which occurs in the range between nine and 16 points,
since the outbreak of SARS in 2003, CEPD officials said.

Specifically, the exports index dropped two points while the
share price index, bank clearings and remittance, and industrial
production index each fell a single point.

Minister of Economic Affairs Chen Ruey-lung said the year of 2007
is expected to see good performance in both private investment
and private consumption. He predicted that the economy this year
will do pretty well if exports can maintain a few degrees of
growth.
