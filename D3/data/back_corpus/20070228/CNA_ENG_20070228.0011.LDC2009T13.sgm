China poses a threat to the United States, and the threat will
grow over time due to Beijing's rapid military buildup, a U.S.
intelligence officer said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Lt. Gen. Michael Maples, director of U.S. Defense Intelligence
Agency, told a U.S. Senate hearing that Beijing began its
military modernization in 1999 and that its rapid military
buildup will not cease even if the Taiwan problem is resolved
because of China's aspirations for great power status.
</P>
<P>
Maples said the Chinese are developing more capable long-range
ballistic missiles with terminally guided maneuverable warheads
able to hit U.S. aircraft carriers at sea and targets in the
continental United States.
</P>
<P>
Chinese military modernization has been coupled with its notable
success in improving relations with Japan and its active
engagement with multilateral organizations, including ASEAN,
Maples continued.
</P>
<P>
However, Maples said he sees a diminished possibility of China
engaging in conflict with Taiwan and a low risk of China
undergoing a severe financial crisis over the next five years
despite its banks' huge amount of bad loans.
