Air carriers must continue providing flights to southern Pingtung
county despite the fact that these are money-losing operations,
Civil Aeronautics Administration (CAA) officials said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The officials' remarks came amid widespread rumors that Mandarin
Airlines is planning to stop plying its Taipei-Taichung route and
that carriers offering flights to Pintung county and Hengchun
Peninsula in southern Taiwan may also follow the suit.
</P>
<P>
"Air travel is indispensable for passengers from Pingtung and the
many tourists hoping to visit the county's scenic Hengchun area,
" a CAA official said, adding "it is necessary that flight
services to the southern area be maintained."
</P>
<P>
To encourage aviation companies to continue their flight services
to Pingtung County and Hengchun Peninsula, where the Kending
National Park is located, the CAA is working on diversified
incentives to help carriers overcome current operating
difficulties, the official said.
</P>
<P>
"Carriers flying to the Pingtung and Hengchun airports have been
operating in red," the CAA official admitted.
</P>
<P>
Trans  Asia Airways,  the sole carrier  operating  on the Taipei-
Pingtung county route, recorded an average 53.7 percent passenger
load for 2006, the official cited CAA statistics as saying.
</P>
<P>
Mandarin Airlines, Trans Asia Airways and UNI Airways, which
provide flights from Taipei to Hengchun, registered an average
passenger load that reached only 48 percent of capacity for the
whole of last year.
