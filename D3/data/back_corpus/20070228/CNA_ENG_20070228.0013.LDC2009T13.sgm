TAIWAN OFFICIALS, LAWMAKERS MEET WITH BRITISH COUNTERPARTS IN
LONDON

London, Feb. 27 (CNA) 02/28/07  15:54:38 (By Jennifer Huang and

<P>
A visiting delegation of Taiwan legislators and government
officials have met with their British counterparts and exchanged
views over the past two days on issues regarding global climate
change and renewable energy.
</P>
<P>
Legislators Lee Chun-yi, Luo Shih-hsiung, Wang Tu-fa, Chen Ming-
chen, representing the Legislative Yuan's discipline, economic,
and energy and science-technology committees, respectively, as
well as Yeh Hui-ching, chairman of the Bureau of Energy under the
Ministry of Economic Affairs, have paid visits to the United
Kingdom's Foreign and Commonwealth Office and the Department of
Trade and Industry, marking the first Taiwan official delegation
to visit U.K. government offices in 35 years since London
switched its diplomatic recognition from Taipei to Beijing.
</P>
<P>
At a news conference held at the Taipei Representative Office in
the United Kingdom Tuesday, Lee said his delegation has engaged
in intensive discussions on climate change and renewable energy
issues with the British officials and has suggested to the
officials that Taiwan and the United Kingdom can cement bilateral
ties via cooperation in voluntary carbon offset transactions.
</P>
<P>
The delegation has also paid visits to relevant committees under
the British House of Commons, Lee said.
</P>
<P>
Lee further said that Taiwan will take part in a global wind
power conference to be hosted by the United Kingdom in September
at the earliest.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan hopes to invite British officials and experts to the
country next year for discussions on systems,  mechanisms and
technologies concerning sustainable renewable energies, Lee
added.
</P>
<P>
During their visit, Lee said, the members of the delegation have
asked for the United Kingdom's help to facilitate Taiwan's
joining the Kyoto Protocol. Taiwan has continued to be excluded
from the Kyoto Protocol -- aimed at reducing carbon dioxide
emissions -- as the protocol is an agreement formed under an
organization of the United Nations,  and statehood is therefore a
requirement for participation.
</P>
<P>
The legislators have also stressed to the British officials that
Taiwan's success in reducing carbon dioxide emissions should
never be listed under the efforts of China and should instead be
recognized as Taiwan's achievement, Lee added.
</P>
<P>
In response, the British officials have expressed that they
"understand" the Taiwan lawmakers' position, but they have not
made any promises on the issue, Lee noted.
</P>
<P>
Lee further said that a draft bill governing renewable energy
development has already been screened by the legislature's
Economic and Energy Committee, and it is expected to be passed
into law before the end of June this year.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, an energy taxation draft bill has already been signed
by 134 legislators from across the political spectrum, and its
passage into law is only a matter of time, said Legislator Chen
Ming-chen, who initiated the bill.
