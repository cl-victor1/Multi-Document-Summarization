CHIANG KAI-SHEK'S DESCENDANTS URGED TO DECIDE ON HIS REMAINS

Taipei,  Feb. 27 (CNA) 02/28/07  10:22:23 (By Maubo Chang)
</P>

The Executive Yuan will work out a plan to handle the remains of
the late President Chiang Kai-shek if his descendants refuse to
have them interred in a tomb prepared for him by the Ministry of
National Defense (MND), Government Information Office Minister
Cheng Wen-tsang said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The MND will ask Chiang's descendants to decide where they want
to inter the remains of Chiang Kai-shek and his son Chiang Ching-
kuo -- who served as president three years after his father died
in 1975.
</P>
<P>
Their remains have been stored separately in temporary mausoleums
in Tahsi, Taoyuan County, since their deaths in 1975 and 1988,
respectively, and their mausoleums are under the charge of the
MND, which assigns a squadron of military honor guards to protect
the Chiang Kai-shek mausoleum.
</P>
<P>
Cheng said Chiang's descendants agreed in 2004 to lay them to
rest permanently in a military cemetery in Taipei, but told the
authorities in 2005 when the construction of their graveyards was
completed that there were different opinions in the family about
whether the interring should proceed.
</P>
<P>
Cheng said that if the remains of the two Chiangs are transferred
to the military cemetery, the guards posted at Chiang Kai-shek's
mausoleum will be withdrawn and if the family refuses to allow
the bodies to be removed, the Executive Yuan will ask the MND to
come up with anew plan about the management of the mausoleum.
</P>
<P>
He made the statement after Yu Shyi-kun, chairman of the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party, urged the Executive Yuan Tuesday to
remove the military guards.
</P>
<P>
Citing a statement by President Chen Shui-bian earlier that day
that Chiang is responsible for the brutal crushing of a Taiwanese
revolt in 1947, Yu argued that there is no reason for the country
to pay any respects to the late dictator by allowing an honor
guard to protect his mausoleum.
</P>
<P>
He urged the MND to give up management of the two Chiang
mausoleums and turn them over to the Chiang family.
