From March 1, passengers departing on international flights are
advised to check in three hours prior to their departure times to
cope with new security measures, the Civil Aeronautic
Administration (CAA) said Wednesday.

CAA officials said that from March 1, passengers will be
forbidden from carrying containers of more than 100ml of liquid,
gel or spray on international flights and that liquids of less
than 100ml must be sealed in a see-through plastic bag and
checked by security officials before boarding.
</P>
<P>
The plastic bags -- sized 24 cm x 17 cm -- will be provided by
the aviation police and no more than one plastic bag will be
allowed per passenger, CAA officials said, adding that the bags
are similar to those already being used at international airports
in the United States, Japan, South Korea, Hong Kong and Macau.

Denying criticism by some airline companies that the "three hours
earlier" requirement is irrational and trouble-causing, CAA
officials said the requirement is in line with U.S. air transport
security measures.
