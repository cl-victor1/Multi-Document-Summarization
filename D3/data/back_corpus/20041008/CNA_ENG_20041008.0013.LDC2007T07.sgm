CABINET TO COMMUNICATE WITH 'TRUTH' COMMISSION: PREMIER
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taipei,  Oct.  8 (CNA) (By Lilian Wu)
</P>
<P>
Premier Yu Shyi-kun said Friday that the government will communicate
with a commission set up under a special statute to investigate the
March 19 election-eve shooting of President Chen Shui-bian.
</P>
<P>
Yu made the remarks after five officials sent by the Cabinet to call
on the March 19 truth investigation commission ended in a row the
previous day in which both sides traded accusations, with one side
questioning the constitutionality of the body and the other side
asking the point of the visit if they regard it as "unlawful" as
President Chen has described it.
</P>
<P>
The premier said that he felt sorry for the five officials, but
stressed that the Executive Yuan is sincere and that communication
must continue before a revision of the "truth" bill and a ruling on
the constitutionality of the bill by the Council of Grand Justices has
been issued.
</P>
<P>
"As long as there is consensus, the Executive Yuan will work with the
commission," Yu said.
</P>
<P>
The premier said that Shih Chi-yang, convener of the 10-member so-
called "truth" commission, advocates an amendment of the controversial
bill, which the Executive Yuan considers a vindication of its earlier
request for a legislative reconsideration of the bill.
</P>
<P>
He called for continued communication so as to avoid damage to society
and a dilemma for civil servants.
</P>
<P>
The premier's words came as the commission suffered another blow
Friday when a second official failed to respond to its request to give
a briefing to the commission.
</P>
<P>
Wang Ching-feng, spokeswoman of the commission and a former member of
the Control Yuan, said the failure of Hou You-yi, commissioner of the
Criminal Investigation Bureau (CIB) , to show up was "regrettable,
although expected."
</P>
<P>
Wang said that since the inauguration of the commission, it has
continued to request various personnel to present themselves for
interviews over the shooting.
</P>
<P>
The commission asked the Tainan Prosecutor's Office to send officials
Thursday, but waited in vain. Shih Chi-yang, convener of the 10-member
commission, went to Tainan, southern Taiwan, to call on them Friday.
</P>
<P>
She claimed that the commission was set up under the law and must work
with the administrative and prosecutorial agencies to probe the
shooting in Tainan, southern Taiwan, which the defeated opposition
claims helped Chen edge out his rival in the election the following
day.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the commission has yet to receive funds from the
government and that an independent legislator had suggested that it
should solicit donations to facilitate its operation, Wang said that
as a government body established under the law the commission cannot
accept donations.
</P>
<P>
The commission estimates that it will need NT$10 million (US$295,850)
for basic expenses and is hopeful that the comptroller-general will
allocate an appropriate budget, Wang said.
</P>
<P>
The commission has so far spent around NT$250,000, all provided by the
members themselves, she said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Kao Cheng-sheng, deputy CIB commissioner, said that as the
Executive Yuan believes the legality of the commission is
"questionable" and as the implementation of the bill is difficult, the
CIB hopes that the legislature will revise the bill soon so that it
can work with the commission.
</P>
<P>
Kao also said that CIB, at the request of the Tainan Prosecutor's
Office, has turned over forensic and investigation reports to the
office and will await instructions from the Prosecutor's Office to
work with the commission.
