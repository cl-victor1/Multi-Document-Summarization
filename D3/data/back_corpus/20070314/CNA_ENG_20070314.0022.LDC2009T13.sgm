Main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) acting Chairman Wu Poh-hsiung
quit his party job Wednesday to run for the KMT chairmanship in
full force ahead of in a by- election slated for April 7.
</P>
<P>
According to Wu, he offered to step down from the post during the
decision- making Central Standing Committee's weekly meeting
earlier in the day and P.K. Chiang, another KMT deputy chairman,
agreed to serve as KMT acting chairman during the transition
period.
</P>
<P>
"I would like to contest the KMT's by-election for chairman as an
individual party member to underscore  the party's democratic
mechanism," Wu said, adding that vying for the KMT chairmanship
would be the last political task of his career and that he will
do his utmost to maintain neutrality to boost harmony and unity
in the party if elected chairman.

<P>
Former KMT Chairman Ma Ying-jeou resigned from the party's top
post in mid- February after being indicted by Taipei prosecutors
on charges of embezzling from a special municipal monthly
allowance during his two terms as mayor of Taipei from 1998-2006.
</P>
<P>
Ma immediately announced his presidential bid on the same day
that he was indicted.
</P>
<P>
The top priority for Wu after becoming KMT chief would be to
forge cooperation or help push the formation of a ticket for the
2008 presidential election between Ma and Legislative Yuan
Speaker Wang Jin-pyng, also of the KMT.
