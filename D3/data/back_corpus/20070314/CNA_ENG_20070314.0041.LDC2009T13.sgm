Activists for the preservation of the Losheng Sanatorium
Wednesday called for the Cabinet-level Council for Cultural
Affairs (CCA) to designate the 77-year- old compound as an
historical heritage site and thus prevent its imminent demolition
to make way for a Taipei Metro depot.
</P>
<P>
Several architectural scholars and urban planners held a news
conference that day to seek a revival of a CCA proposal that
suggested a ninety-percent preservation of the sanatorium which
has been treating patients with Hansen's disease since 1930.
</P>
<P>
The government conceals the fact that the ninety-percent proposal
is technically feasible and deliberately misleads local people to
believe that the preservation of Losheng conflicts with their
right to better traffic, said Yu Chao-ching, Chairman of the
Department  of Landscape  Architecture,  Chung  Yuan  Christian
University.
</P>
<P>
The Taipei City Department of Rapid Transit Systems last year
rejected the CCA proposal, crafted by an engineering consultancy
firm, saying it could endanger the trains because it shortens and
bends the tracks in and out of the maintenance depot.
</P>
<P>
But Yu said such a statement is pointless: The tracks are for
train maintenance rather than normal operations and under such
circumstances the trains do not need to run at high speeds.
</P>
<P>
The CCA submitted the proposal to the Executive Yuan in February
and was again rebuffed. Preservationists have lately been
pressing Premier Su Tseng-chang to reconsider the issue, but Su
said that such a "rejection" was only a formality, and that the
decision to pursue a project that would retain around 41 percent
of the sanatorium fell under the jurisdiction  of the Taipei City
and Taipei County governments.
</P>
<P>
A forceful relocation of the sanatorium patients and demolition
of the buildings is expected in late April, as some of the 40-odd
patients still living there refuse to move.
</P>
<P>
Citing the sanatorium's cultural and historical values as a rare
living testimony to the past segregation endured by "lepers", as
well as the patients' right to stay in familiar settings, Kang
Min-jay, Associate  Professor  at Tamkang  University's
Department  of Architecture, said the government should be more
humane in facing the issue.
</P>
<P>
With administrative procedures of local authorities over the case
about to be finalized, the preservationists now hope that the CCA
will take an extraordinary measure and step in.
</P>
<P>
An article of the Cultural Heritage Preservation Act allows the
CCA to intervene if responsible government agencies fail to take
necessary  actions to preserve the nation's cultural heritage.
Preservationist groups have started a signature campaign and will
present a petition to the CCA Thursday, asking the CCA to
designate Losheng Sanatorium as historical site.
</P>
<P>
We hope the CCA to do the right thing and the Executive Yuan at
least not to oppress it,Chuang Yu-lin of the Losheng Youth
Alliance said.
