V.P. SAYS SHE'S `MOST INVINCIBLE' RIVAL TO EX-KMT CHIEF
</HEADLINE>

Taipei, March 14 (CNA) 03/14/07  16:49:27 (By Deborah Kuo)

Vice President Annette Lu said Wednesday that she is the best
rival to Ma Ying- jeou, the former opposition Kuomintang (KMT)
chairman who is widely viewed as the KMT's best bet in the 2008
presidential race.
</P>
<P>
In an exclusive interview with the Hong Kong-based Apple Daily,
Lu, who is among four contenders vying for the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) nomination to run in the 2008
presidential election, said Ma could turn out to be the only
challenger to the DPP and that she believes she is the DPP's best
choice to challenge Ma in terms of appearance, eloquence,
learning and language ability.
</P>
<P>
Lu said that having failed in none of six major elections in the
past -- including legislative and magistrate elections -- she
believes she will not lose the 2008 race if nominated, as she
will be more diligent and well-prepared than anybody else.
</P>
<P>
Lu told the Apple Daily that although all three of the other DPP
aspirants -- Premier Su Tseng-chang, former Premier Frank Hsieh
and DPP Chairman Yu Shyi-kun -- have their edges, she has
advantages that they lack.
</P>
<P>
She said that like Ma, she is a Harvard alumni and that she
envies Ma for his "handsomeness." Ma was an English secretary to
the late President Chiang Ching- kuo soon after his graduation
from Harvard law school, she said, adding that Ma has always been
known as a "perfect man" for he has climbed the ladder of success
smoothly until recently.
</P>
<P>
Recently, she said, people have questioned his integrity after he
was indicted on corruption charges in early February, as well as
his crisis-handling abilities.
</P>
<P>
Lu said Ma's wavering stance on Taiwan's status and its future is
his Achilles' heel, adding that Ma has never spoken clearly about
where exactly he intends to lead Taiwan if he is elected.
</P>
<P>
According to Lu, the ruling DPP still has a great chance of
winning the 2008 race, given that the KMT has huge and
fundamental issues to tackle even before finalizing a
presidential candidate.
