A set of contingency measures will be put in place in April to
deal with a worsening shortage of gravel that has hit Taiwan's
booming construction sector hard, the Ministry of Economic
Affairs (MOEA) reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
According to the MOEA, a task force and an ad hoc group under the
Executive Yuan have met and decided to kick off measures to meet
the growing demand in Taiwan by beginning next month to import
gravel from the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that Taiwan will need to find as much as 12
million cubic meters of gravel by the end of this year if China
continues banning exports to Taiwan, MOEA said. China halted its
gravel shipments to Taiwan earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
A total of some 16.5 million cubic meters of gravel is expected
to be available by December if a local supply is secured, the
MOEA said, adding that it is offering incentives to encourage
greater and more diversified imports from countries other than
China and the Philippines.
