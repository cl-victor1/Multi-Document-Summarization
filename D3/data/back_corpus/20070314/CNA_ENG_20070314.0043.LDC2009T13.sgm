The United States hopes that Taiwan and China can find a peaceful
way to resolve the cross-Taiwan Strait issue and dissolve the
tension between them, Thomas Hodges, spokesman for the American
Institute in Taiwan (AIT), said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a meeting with reporters at the AIT's Taipei Office,
Hodges, who assumed his new post as spokesman and Public Affairs
Section chief for the AIT two weeks ago, said the United States
has maintained a special relationship with Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
He added that under the Taiwan Relations Act, the United States
is committed to providing Taiwan with sufficient defensive
weapons for its own defense.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Hodges said, the United States is opposed to
any attempt by either side of the Taiwan Strait to change the
status quo unilaterally or any moves that might heighten the
tension in the Taiwan Strait.
</P>
<P>
The new AIT spokesman also said he admires Taiwan's dynamic
democracy, its commitment to civil rights and people's well-
being, economic achievements, rich culture and Taiwan's active
media workers who are constantly on the move.
</P>
<P>
Hodges compared the relationship between a spokesman and the
media to that between a couple doing a tango, saying that their
jobs, though different, are mutually beneficial.
</P>
<P>
Prior to taking up his duties at the AIT, Hodges served as a
professional U.S. diplomat for over 19 years, including
assignments in China, India, the Hague and the Netherlands.
