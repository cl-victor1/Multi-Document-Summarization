Taipei,  March 14 (CNA) 03/14/07  11:56:00 (By Sofia Wu)

<P>
The four contenders vying for the ruling Democratic Progressive
Party (DPP) nomination to run in the 2008 presidential election
have agreed to conduct a policy debate before accepting President
Chen Shui-bian's mediation for picking a single candidate to
avoid a split in the party.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was reached in a two-hour meeting between Chen and
the four DPP aspirants -- Vice President Annette Lu, Premier Su
Tseng-chang, DPP Chairman Yu Shyi-kun and former Premier Frank
Hsieh -- at the president's official residence Tuesday to seek a
mutually acceptable solution to the party's nomination fray.
</P>
<P>
It was the second such meeting following a fruitless one a week
ago. In an effort to prevent confusing media reports that could
stir up suspicions or misunderstandings among the four DPP
bigwigs as seen in the wake of the first meeting, Presidential
Office Deputy Secretary-General Chen Chi-mai gave a news briefing
at the end of the second round of negotiations.
</P>
<P>
President Chen was quoted as having conceded at the start of the
meeting that there indeed are divisions within the DPP over
certain basic policy lines. He therefore suggested that a debate
be held for the four contenders to clarify their stances and
convictions on certain critical issues.
</P>
<P>
The four contenders unanimously agreed to accept President Chen's
mediation. As to how many rounds should be held and what format
should be used for the debate, they agreed to authorize the DPP's
Central Standing Committee to make the decision.
</P>
<P>
According to Chen Chi-mai, the four hopefuls also agreed to sign
a written commitment pledging to accept the final result of the
president's mediation and coordination in the selection of a
single candidate to represent the party in the 2008 presidential
election.
</P>
<P>
The commitment also reads that those who fail to win the
nomination will not leave the DPP or continue to press ahead with
their presidential bids and will throw their unreserved support
behind the party's presidential nominee and candidates in the
year-end legislative elections.
</P>
<P>
It was also decided at Tuesday's meeting that negotiations will
be held after the debate to determine whether the follow-up
candidate selection will be based on a vote by party members or a
series of public opinion polls, Chen Chi-mai said.
</P>
<P>
Asked whether the four contenders will take part in a debate to
be organized by the Taiwan Society, a pro-independence advocacy
group, Chen Chi-mai said the DPP's Central Standing committee
will discuss at its weekly meeting to be held later in the day
whether the party will organize a debate for the four contenders
on its own or in cooperation with the Taiwan Society.
</P>
<P>
As to when the president and the four contenders will meet again
for nomination mediation, he said, a schedule has yet to be set.
</P>
<P>
According to the DPP's presidential nomination mechanism, a
primary election will be held only after the mediation  and
coordination approach fails to produce a single candidate. If the
primary approach has to be adopted, the candidate will be
selected based on the results of a party member vote, which
accounts for 30 percent of their score, and a series of public
opinion polls, which accounts for 70 percent.
