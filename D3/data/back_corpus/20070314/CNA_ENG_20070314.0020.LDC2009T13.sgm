Taipei,  March 14 (CNA) 03/14/07  17:18:30 (By Lilian Wu)
</P>
<P>
The Executive Yuan will invest NT$81.73 billion (US$2.47 billion)
over the next 10 years in care of the elderly, according to a
program proposal passed at an Executive Yuan meeting Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Premier Su Tseng-chang said the program, which has been listed as
the flagship plan of the Executive Yuan's "Mega Investment, Mega
Warmth" economic stimulus project, will provide 12,000 jobs this
year and 83,000 jobs by 2015.
</P>
<P>
In view of the dawning of the age of the gray society in Taiwan,
Su said it is the largest social welfare program ever to be
implemented in Taiwan in addition to the national pension
program.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the number of the elderly in Taiwan is expected to
reach 2.32 million by the end of this year and estimated that one
out of every 10 elderly people will become debilitated and a
tremendous burden to their households.
</P>
<P>
The program will serve those who are debilitated and cannot take
care of themselves, including the elderly over 65, aborigines
over 55, physically and mentally challenged people over 50 and
elderly people living alone whose instrumental activities of
daily living (IADLs) are debilitated.
</P>
<P>
With a declining birth rate, Taiwan's graying speed has
accelerated, the Executive Yuan said.
</P>
<P>
The ratio of the elderly accounts for 10 percent in early 2007,
with the number needing various degrees of care totaling more
than 200,000. By 2016, the number will surpass 13 percent of the
total population and the percentage of those aged under 14 will
be lower than that of the elderly.
