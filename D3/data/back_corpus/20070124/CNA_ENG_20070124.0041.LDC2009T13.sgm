The government is to amend the Company Act
</P>
<P>
and set up cross-ministry mechanisms to prevent future incidents
like that at the Rebar Group, Economic Minister Chen Ruey-long
said Wednesday.

According to the Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA), the amended
Company Act will prohibit legal persons from serving as both a
director and supervisor of a company at the same time. It will
also require stricter government review of proposed corporate
charters.

Other clauses address the private placement of corporate bonds
and the compulsory resignation of directors,  supervisors  and
managers, MOEA officials said.

Chen said the MOEA will invite academic and business persons to
give their opinions during the bill drafting processes.

In addition to amending the law, Chen said the government will
also reinforce supervision and management of business
conglomerates, which he said have developed special operating
patterns in Taiwan. The MOEA, the Council for Economic Planning
and Development and the Financial Supervisory Commission will
form a joint panel to deal with conglomerate issues, he said.
