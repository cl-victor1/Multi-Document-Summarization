President Chen Shui-bian will meet with five former national
leaders from Europe, Asia, Africa and Central and Southern
America in an assembly Friday to share the experience of an
emerging democracy, the Taiwan Foundation for Democracy (TFD)
said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Chen also hopes to bring about a "global forum on emerging
democracies" that will serve as a platform for dialogue and
exchange for new democracies in the assembly, TFD officials said.
The president first broached the creation of the forum in his New
Year message.
</P>
<P>
The officials said that TFD Chairman and Legislative Speaker Wang
Jin-pyng will deliver the opening speech and that Chen will
exchange views with other national leaders on the joy and pain of
a democracy.
</P>
<P>
They will discuss such topics as the transitional justice of
democracy, the options for a constitutional system, splitting
national and ethnic identities, the mass media and democratic
development.
</P>
<P>
The officials noted that to promote the exchanges of emerging
democracy, the TFD has planned a series of activities, starting
with an international seminar Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Domestic and foreign experts and scholars will be invited to
attend the seminar to discuss issues of emerging democracies from
every perspective, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
It is hoped that the seminar will help Taiwan society pay closer
attention to related issues, deepen Taiwan's democracy and raise
its international profile, they said.
</P>
<P>
The officials said there will be group discussions in the
seminar, with Yu Shyi- kun, chairman of the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party, delivering the opening speech.

Experts and scholars from the United States, Mongolia, South
Africa, Chile, Romania, Pakistan and the Philippines will also
attend, the officials said.
