KMT TO SETTLE PARTY ASSETS IN JUNE: `PAN-BLUE' REPRESENTATIVE
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Washington,  Jan.  24 (CNA) 01/24/07  19:29:11 (By Jorge Liu and
Flor Wang)
</P>
<P>
Taiwan's main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) is determined to settle
its party assets issue by the end of June and will do its best to
act as a capable and rational opposition party, Jason Yuan,
Washington representative of the opposition "pan-blue alliance"
said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Yuan made the remarks at a seminar on KMT reform with "pan-blue"
supporters of the KMT, the People First Party (PFP) and the New
Party in the greater Washington, D. C. area.
</P>
<P>
Citing comments made by KMT Chairman Ma Ying-jeou, Yuan outlined
the KMT's four reform directions:
</P>
<P>
1. Dealing with the KMT's assets by the end of June. It will not
</P>
<P>
run any business in the future and will sustain its future
</P>
<P>
election campaigns through fund-raising.
</P>
<P>
2. The KMT and the PFP are determined to develop a closer and
</P>
<P>
firmer partnership based on their existing cooperative ties.
</P>
<P>
3. The KMT will ask its lawmakers to step up their interpellation
</P>
<P>
to effectively and rationally check the administration at the
</P>
<P>
Legislative Yuan.
</P>
<P>
4. The KMT is committed to transforming itself into a "slim but
</P>
<P>
capable" political party by trimming its structure  and
</P>
<P>
workforce, in addition to handling its assets.
</P>
<P>
According to Yuan, Ma is poised to promote six major goals if the
KMT regains power in the 2008 presidential election -- ethnic and
social harmony and stability,  mitigating political infighting,
removing all political interference in economic activities with
China, cross-Taiwan Strait peace and prosperity, clean politics,
respecting the checks and balances of opposition parties and
wiping out official corruption.
