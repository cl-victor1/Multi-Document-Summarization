A guitarist and a golf ace in their teens, a rare disease
patient-turned- volunteer, an enterprising economist and an
innovative medical researcher rank among the Central News
Agency's (CNA) 2007 list of Top 10 Rising Stars in Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
They will be commended at a ceremony to be held Thursday at a
Taipei hotel, with Vice President Annette Lu presenting the
awards.
</P>
<P>
This is the third consecutive year that CNA has celebrated the
inspiring power of potential by honoring those who have achieved
something remarkable or shown great promise for future
development before reaching the age of 40.
</P>
<P>
Rounding out the 2007 Top 10 Rising Stars list are Huang Mo-hsin
in the law and politics category; Sun Chih-li in economics,
finance and business management; Lee Kuo-pin and Cheng Shao-wei,
both in science and technology; Lin Chia-wei in culture and arts;
Tu Wen-ling in social improvement and environmental protection;
Tseng Ya-ni in sports; Mayuei Pihou in social harmony; Hsu Chu-an
in medicine and public health; and Yang Yu-hsin in social
service.
</P>
<P>
The annual celebration is aimed at encouraging young people to
strive to make a difference with innovation and originality while
dedicating themselves to careers in the public interest, setting
guidelines for values and providing a new vision for Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
CNA strictly observes the principles of openness and objectivity
throughout the recommendation, initial screening and final
selection processes. Ten university presidents from northern,
central and southern Taiwan were invited to form a panel of
judges to pick the most representative in 10 professional fields.
</P>
<P>
Members of the jury were National Taiwan Normal University
President Kuo Yi- hsiung, National Taipei University of
Technology President Lee Chu-tien, National Chengchi University
President Wu Su-hua, Taipei Physical Education College President
Yang Chung-ho, National Tainan University President Huang Cheng-
chieh, National Pingtung  University  of Science and Technology
President Ku Yuan-kuang, Tzu Chi University President Wang Pen-
jung, National Taiwan Ocean University President Lee Kuo-tien,
National Chi Nan University President Chang Chin-fu and Taipei
National University of the Arts President Chu Chung-ching.
</P>
<P>
In line with the Top 10 Rising Stars selection regulations, the
inspirational figures were chosen from the following categories
-- law and politics; economics, finance and business management;
science and  technology;  culture and arts;  social  improvement
and environmental protection;  sports; news media;  ethnic
harmony; medicine  and public  health;  and social  service.  No
media representative made the list this year.
</P>
<P>
All of the winners are "a new generation of Taiwan-born unsung
heroes who are down-to-earth and diligent and who show vitality,
perseverance and a strong will to serve and sacrifice in their
pursuit of professional excellence and making Taiwan a better
place in which to work and live," according to the award
organizers.
</P>
<P>
The stories of the 10 Rising Stars and their visions for the
future have also been compiled in the Chinese-language 2006 World
Almanac published by CNA.
</P>
<P>
It has been 18 years since CNA began compiling an annual Chinese
World Almanac. The reference book has won acclaim in both
academic and business circles. The 20076 World Almanac and the
2007 Who's Who in Taiwan came off the presses last month.
