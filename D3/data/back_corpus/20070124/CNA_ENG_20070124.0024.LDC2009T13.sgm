World Vision Taiwan, a Christian relief organization dedicated to
helping underprivileged  children and families, is calling on
donors to allow some 1,500 poverty-stricken families on its list
to enjoy a feast on Lunar New Year's Eve -- a time for family
reunions.

<P>
A spokesman for World Vision Taiwan said the organization has
obtained a promise from the owners of the 7-11 convenience store
chain that for every NT$10,000 received by World Vision Taiwan,
the chain will donate a New Year's Eve feast to one of the needy
families.

<P>
The spokesman  explained  that the 1,500 families  on the
organization's list are all so poor that they cannot even afford
a decent meal, let alone a feast.
</P>
<P>
The next Lunar New Year's Day -- the first day of the first moon,
according to the lunar calendar -- falls on Feb. 18.
</P>

The Lunar New Year is celebrated by Chinese and other people in
East Asia. The main meal on New Year's Eve is called weilu, or
"surrounding the stove," in which the whole family sits around a
hot pot, eating, drinking and chatting to usher in the new year.
</P>
<P>
On World Vision Taiwan's goal for 2007, the spokesman said the
organization hopes to muster NT$50 million to help 2,000 less
fortunate families.
