PREMIER ORDERS PETITION FOR CONSTITUTIONAL INTERPRETATION OF
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taipei, Jan. 24 (CNA) 01/24/07  20:05:54 (By Y.C. Jou)

Premier Su Tseng-chang Wednesday instructed the Ministry of
Justice (MOJ) to petition the grand justices for a constitution
interpretation reaffirming the president's immunity from criminal
prosecution, amid the trial of thespecial state affairs fundcase
in which President Chen Shui-bian is implicated.
</P>
<P>
In an Executive Yuan news release, Su said that he was worried
about developments  in the 'special  state affairs fund' case
negatively  impacting constitutionally  mandated  presidential
operations, particularly in the sphere of secret diplomatic
missions.
</P>
<P>
He said the prosecution's current practice in investigating
President Chen is inconsistent both with a MOJ internal
resolution dating back to 1996 and practices established during
former president Lee Teng-hui's term.
</P>
<P>
Su said the 1996 resolution  stipulated  that as criminal
investigations into the actions of an incumbent head of state are
unable to proceed during the term of office, such cases should be
temporarily shelved until the president leaves office.  Citing
Minister of Justice Morley Shih, Su said cases related to the
former president Lee Teng-hui's cases, during Lee's term, were
dealt with according to this resolution.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Justice cannot instruct prosecutors regarding
specific  cases, but  is responsible  for overseeing  general
prosecutorial affairs, Su said. He therefore asked the ministry
to petition for an interpretation of Constitution Article 52,
which stipulates criminal immunity for the president, in order to
sort out contradictions in prosecutorial practices.
</P>
<P>
Article 52 says: The President shall not, without having been
recalled, or having been relieved of his functions, be liable to
criminal prosecution unless he is charged with having committed
an act of rebellion or treason.
</P>
<P>
Lawmakers of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party in December
had filed a petition with the Council of Grand Justices for an
interpretation of the same article. They argued that questioning
an incumbent president was unconstitutional in the first place.
</P>
<P>
President Chen last August accepted questioning by Prosecutor
Chen Jui-jen during his investigation of the case. The prosecutor
in November indicted the first lady, along with three aides close
to the president, for forgery and embezzlement and indicated that
the president himself was an accomplice who can be prosecuted
after the protection granted to him by the Constitution ends with
his term.
</P>
<P>
The Taipei District Court recently ruled that six diplomatic
missions cited by the president as having drawn on the
controversial state affairs funds were not secret as the
president claimed, and should be disclosed in court proceedings.
</P>
<P>
Su said the pursuit for a constitution interpretation was not to
protect President Chen but for the sake of the constitutional
operations of presidency.
