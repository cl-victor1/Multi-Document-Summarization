The Cabinet is to set up anews monitoring unitin March to prevent
financial crises of confidence caused by mistaken press reports,
Council for Economic Planning and Development (CEPD) Vice
Chairman Thomas Yeh said Wednesday.

Yeh said the unit would refer cases of false reporting to the
National Communications Commission (NCC) for the later to decide
on penalties.This  is not about media control but about crisis
management,Yeh said.

<P>
He said that in the recent Chinese Bank run some media have
released mistaken information, including inflated numbers of
people who withdrew money from the bank,  further undermining
public confidence.
</P>
<P>
Insolvency petitions by two Rebar Group subsidiaries triggered a
Jan. 5 run on the Chinese Bank, another Rebar affiliate. The bank
lost NT$32 billion (US$977.3 million) in deposits in three days.

Yeh added that the monitoring unit will be operated jointly by
the Financial Supervisory Commission, the NCC and the Government
Information Office. Monitoring news reports real time will enable
government departments to respond quickly or issue corrections,
