PREMIER RENEWS CALL FOR EXTRA LEGISLATIVE SESSION
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  Jan.  24 (CNA) 01/24/07  16:06:33 (By Y.F. Low)

Premier Su Tseng-chang renewed his call Wednesday for the
Legislative Yuan to hold an extra session to review a long list
of important bills, at the top of which is the government's 2007
budget proposal.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the issue during a weekly Cabinet meeting, Su noted
that 146 bills submitted by the Cabinet to the legislature
remained unresolved when the legislature went into recess in
chaos last Saturday.
</P>
<P>
They include a draft law on the organization of a commission in
charge of supervising and managing a worker's retirement pension
fund that has been stalled for more than a year, Su said.
</P>
<P>
Without the law, the fund cannot be invested for profit-making,
which seriously undermines the interests of workers, Su said.
</P>
<P>
On the final day of the last legislative session last Friday,
ruling and opposition legislators  spent almost the whole day
squabbling over an opposition-initiated draft law on the
organization of the Central Election Commission (CEC) , resulting
in a number of bills being stonewalled.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the same issue Wednesday, Legislative Yuan Speaker
Wang Jin-pyng said the legislature is expected to hold a talk
session Jan. 29 to allow legislators to discuss whether to call
an extra legislative session.
</P>
<P>
If they agree to holding an extra session, they will negotiate to
decide its agenda on that day, Wang said.
</P>
<P>
The ruling and opposition camps have remained divided on the
matter.
</P>
<P>
While the ruling  Democratic  Progressive  Party wants the
legislature to prioritize the passage of the government's 2007
budget bill, the main opposition Kuomintang insists that the CEC
bill must be the first item on the agenda if the extra session is
to be held.
