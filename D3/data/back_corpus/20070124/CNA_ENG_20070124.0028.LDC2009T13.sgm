The semi-official Taiwan External Trade Development Council
(TAITRA) is planning to organize a workshop next week on Taiwan's
banana exports to Japan, Taiwan's most important market for the
fruit, TAITRA officials said Wednesday.

<P>
Taiwan sold 16,000 tons of bananas to Japan in 2006, representing
a 46.98 precent year-on-year growth. Despite the big amount,
there is still ample room for Taiwan to expand banana exports to
Japan, the officials said.

According to statistics, the total value of Taiwan's fresh fruit
exports reached NT$34.32 million (US$1.04 million) in 2006, with
54 percent shipped to Japan, TAITRA officials said, noting that
bananas made up the bulk.

<P>
The planned workshop is scheduled to open Feb. 1 at the TAITRA
office in Kaohsiung, southern Taiwan, and Japanese importers have
been invited to attend. The officials said they hope the
importers will offer suggestions for local businesses in terms of
banana exports.
