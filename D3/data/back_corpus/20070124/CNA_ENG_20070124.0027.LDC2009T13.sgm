A children's "English language village" operated by the King Car
Education Foundation is set to open in September in Taoyuan
County, foundation officials said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The village has been planned by the foundation in cooperation
with the Taoyuan County Government and National Taipei University
of Technology and will be located at the county's Kuai Le
Elementary School, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
They said the village will provide immersion teaching to allow
children  to learn and practice real-life  English in various
situational settings, including airport customs, a hotel, bank,
supermarket and clinic.
</P>
<P>
There will also be cultural and festive classrooms that are
designed to let children learn about Western culture and customs
through games, they said.
</P>
<P>
According to Morgan Sun, executive director of the foundation,
although many children in Taiwan start learning English early in
their lives, few speak the language well.
</P>
<P>
The foundation hopes that through the immersion teaching provided
by the village, the children can blend English into their lives
and learn to speak the language naturally, Sun said.
</P>
<P>
Sun said  most teachers  at the village  will  be native English-
speaking volunteers recruited by the foundation, adding that the
foundation is also planning to recruit students studying in
English departments in Taiwan universities to serve as teaching
assistants.
</P>
<P>
He said the village can accommodate up to 150 students per day,
with 10 percent of the openings reserved for children from low-
income families.
