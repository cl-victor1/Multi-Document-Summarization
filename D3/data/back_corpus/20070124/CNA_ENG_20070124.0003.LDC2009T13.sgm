MOFA GRATIFIED WITH U.S. COURT CLARIFICATION IN 'KEYSER' CASE
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  Jan. 23 (CNA) 01/24/07  10:23:41 (By Sofia Wu)

The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) is pleased with a U.S.
court clarification that an FBI case against a former U.S. State
Department official allegedly involving a Taiwanese intelligence
official, known as the "Keyser" case, was unrelated to espionage,
a MOFA official said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
MOFA spokesman Wang Chien-yeh made the remarks after a U.S.
federal court sentenced Donald W. Keyser, a former deputy
assistant secretary of state for East Asian and Pacific affairs,
to one year and a day in prison plus a two-year supervised
release and a fine of US$25,000 Monday on three counts --
secretly downloading classified documents and concealing his
affair with a Taiwanese intelligence officer and a trip to
Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
While the MOFA and the country's representative office in the
United States had closely monitored developments in the case,
Wang said the ministry is not in a position to make any comment
on the U.S. court judgment.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, he said, the ministry is happy with the U.S.
court's clarification that the case has nothing to do with
espionage.
</P>
<P>
Keyser was arrested by the FBI in September 2004 after having
lunch at a suburban Washington restaurant with Isabella Cheng, an
official from Taiwan's National Security Bureau formerly
stationed in Washington, D.C., and her boss, Huang Kuang-hsun.
</P>
<P>
In the course of judicial proceedings, the FBI once released a
43-page memo claiming that Cheng received numerous cables and
e-mail messages from Keyser containing confidential details of
U.S. policy toward Taiwan.
