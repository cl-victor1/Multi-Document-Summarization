The Legislative Yuan formally opened its new branch office in the
central Taiwan region Wednesday, with a ceremony marking the
inauguration of the new institution held the same day at the old
Taiwan Provincial Assembly building in Taichung County.
</P>
<P>
Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng and his deputy, Chung
Jung-chi, presided over the ceremony, which was also attended by
many lawmakers elected from the region, including independent
Legislator Yen Chin-piao, Yang Chiung-ying of the opposition
Kuomintang, and Feng Ting-kuo of the opposition People First
Party.
</P>
<P>
In his speech at the ceremony, Wang said that the branch office,
equipped with similar facilities as those found in the
Legislative Yuan's headquarters in Taipei City, will do the
utmost to offer the best services to lawmakers and people living
in central and southern Taiwan.

<P>
The Central Taiwan Office of the Legislative Yaun was established
in the building where the former Taiwan Provincial Assembly had
been situated. The assembly was transformed into a provincial
consultative council in 1999 when the Taiwan Provincial
Government was downsized during a structural adjustment.
</P>
<P>
The new office is equipped with two service units, namely a
central and southern Taiwan service center and a museum featuring
the legislature's operations.
