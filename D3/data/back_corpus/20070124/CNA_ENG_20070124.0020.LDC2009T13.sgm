Taiwan's Chan Yung-jan and Chuang Chia-jung made history
Wednesday by advancing into the semifinals of the women's doubles
in the US$15.68 million Australian Open tennis tournament in
Melbourne.
</P>
<P>
Chan and Chuang, who joined the major tournament as wild cards,
beat unseeded pair Ashley Harkleroad of the United States and
Galina Voskoboeva from Russia 6-0, 6-0 in a quick 26-minute
contest, qualifying them for the women's doubles last four -- an
incredible performance that no Taiwan women tennis players have
achieved before.
</P>
<P>
Chan and Chuang are expected to meet Yan Zi and Zheng Jie of
China, who were gold medalists in last year's Doha Asian Games,
at the semifinal to be held Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The pair, dubbed the "Hope of Taiwan" by the local press and who
won a silver medal in the women's doubles in Doha last November,
finished of Harkleroad and Voskoboeva with nearly perfect play
and no unforced errors.
