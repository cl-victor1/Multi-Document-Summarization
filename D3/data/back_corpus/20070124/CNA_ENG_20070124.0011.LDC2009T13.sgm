The Chinese Bank, one of several victims of a financial storm
triggered by the troubled Rebar Asia Pacific Group, has disclosed
that it may not be able to retrieve the NT$329 million (US$10
million) owed by one of its biggest debtors, the An Feng business
group.
</P>
<P>
The crisis-ridden bank published a name list of bad loan
delinquents Tuesday, with An Feng among the names listed.
According to bank sources, the bank may have to accept the loss
as An Feng's founder, Chu An-hsiung, who is a former speaker of
the Kaohsiung City Council, fled overseas three years ago after
being charged with embezzlement and vote-buying violations.
</P>
<P>
The An Feng group controlled more than four affiliates, including
the An Feng Steel Co., which had run the largest hot strip
rolling mill in the country, with an annual output of 2 million
tons of steel.
</P>
<P>
Under a serious financial crisis, the steel producer was forced
by a bank consortium to auction off its factory last year, while
Feng Chin Metal Industrial Co., another An Feng affiliate, was
also sold off.
</P>
<P>
The Central Deposit Insurance Corp. (CDIC) operated by the
Cabinet-level Financial Supervisory Commission published Tuesday
data featuring non-performing loans of at least NT$1 million each
at three ill-managed banks, namely the Chinese Bank, the Taitung
Business Bank and the Enterprise Bank of Hualien.
</P>
<P>
According to the online data, the banks, having all been taken
over by the CDIC, hold a total of 2,818 non-performing loans
amounting to NT$14 billion in all.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese Bank has 1,274 non-performing loans amounting to
around NT$7 billion, while the Taitung bank holds 893 bad loans
amounting to more than NT$3.6 billion, and the Hualien bank has
678 bad debts totalling about NT$3.3 billion.
</P>
<P>
This marked  the first time that the CDIC has publicized
information on large debt delinquents.
