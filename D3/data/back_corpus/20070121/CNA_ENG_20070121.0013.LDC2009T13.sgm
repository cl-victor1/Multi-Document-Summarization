DPP REFORMIST PUSHES FOR 'THIRD REPUBLIC' CONSTITUTIONAL REFORM
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  Jan. 21 (CNA) 01/21/07  16:51:06 (By Deborah Kuo)

<P>
A reform-minded elite group in the ruling Democratic Progressive
Party (DPP) advocated the launch of a supra-party constitutional
reform movement Sunday in a bid to tackle Taiwan's political
chaos "once and for all."
</P>
<P>
The group, known as the "Generations Forum," put forth a position
paper at a colloquium on the launch of the country's "eighth
constitutional reform" -- or the "third republic" constitutional
reform --  calling for a parliamentary system of government;
single-member constituency and two-vote electoral system; the
holding of a nationwide referendum on the content of a new
Constitution; and lowering the threshold to initiating
constitutional reforms.
</P>
<P>
Generations Forum Convener Jou Yi-cheng,  who was formerly
director of the DPP Department of Youth Development, said it is
hoped that the country will discuss the launch of the "third
republic" constitutional reform and reach a consensus so that the
plan can be referred to the Legislative Yuan for further debate,
paving the way for a nationwide referendum held in tandem with
the legislative election at the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
According to Generations Forum's definition, the Republic of
China's first republic era began in 1912 when the state was
established and ended in 1991, after the Temporary Provisions
Effective During the Period of National Mobilization for
Suppression of the Communist Rebellion was abolished.
</P>
<P>
The second republic era began in 1996 when a popular presidential
election was held in Taiwan for the first time. The second
republic era, also known as the "Taiwan republic" era,
degenerated into a "democratic civil war" -- as former President
Lee Teng-hui put it -- following Taiwan's first peaceful power
transition in decades when opposition candidate Chen Shui-bian
was elected the president in 2000, according to Jou.
</P>
<P>
It is now time for the legislative caucuses of the ruling and
opposition parties to begin brainstorming on constitutional
reforms to pave the way for Taiwan's "third republic" era, Jou
claimed.
</P>
<P>
Participants to the colloquium included former Central Election
Commission Chairman Huang Shi-cheng, former DPP Legislators Lin
Cho-shui and Shen Fu- hsiung, as well as Peacetime Foundation of
Taiwan Chairman Chien Hsi-chieh. Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang
Jin-pyng, who promised to attend, did not show up.
