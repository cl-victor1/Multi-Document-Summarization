The centerpiece in the 2007 Taiwan Lantern Festival -- a lantern
in the shape of the Taiwan mountain boar -- was installed Sunday
at the exhibition site in the plaza in front of the Chiayi County
government.
</P>
<P>
Tourism Bureau Director-General Janice Seh-Jen Lai and Chiayi
County Magistrate Chen Ming-wen will jointly light the 18-meter-
tall theme lantern and hundreds of other lanterns, including
award-winning pieces, at 7 p.m. March 4 at a ceremony to
inaugurate this year's festival, which will last one week until
March 11.
</P>
<P>
The centerpiece, weighing two metric tons and standing on a
20-ton metal base, is the focus of the exhibition because the
next lunar new year, beginning Feb. 18, is the Year of the Pig,
which on the basis of the Chinese zodiac is believed to be a
prosperous year.
</P>
<P>
The Taiwan Lantern Festival became an annual event in 1990 when
the Tourism Bureau under the Ministry  of Transportation  and
Communication put forward the idea of staging a national lantern
show to coincide with the traditional custom of carrying hand
lanterns on the 15th day of the first lunar month.
</P>
<P>
The Chiayi County government indicated that between Lunar New
Year's Day, which falls on Feb. 18, and the end of the lantern
festival, it will present 23 firework displays.
