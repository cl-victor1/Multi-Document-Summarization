TAIWAN LOBBYIST LEAVES BRUSSEL

Brussel, Jan. 20 (CNA) 01/21/07  10:34:05 (By P.C. Tang and Maubo

A medical leader from Taiwan left here for Taipei Saturday after
pitching for Taiwan's membership in the World Health Organization
(WHO) to leaders of European Union (EU) for the last two days.
</P>
<P>
Wu Shu-min, president of the Foundation of Medical Professionals
Alliance in Taiwan, told journalists post here by Taiwan media
before his departure that his lobbying is bearing fruit although
it has not yet resulted in any specific promise.
</P>
<P>
He said, European leaders he met in the last two days were
lending ears to his pitch and were trying to understand the
reasons behind Taiwan's bid and this is quiet a progress.
</P>
<P>
The Taiwan lobbyist said he took comfort from the fact that some
EU leaders agreed with him that Taiwan's membership in WHO is
more a moral and health issue than a political issue.
</P>
<P>
He took issue with a consensus among EU states that the issue of
Taiwan's WHO access could be addressed by allowing it for
meaningful participation in the health body rather than giving it
full membership.
</P>
<P>
"Meaningful participation won't plug the loophole in the line of
global defense against epidemics incurred by Taiwan's exclusion
from the WHO." Wu argued.
</P>
<P>
Wu had met with European Parliament members, EU officials,
European medical leaders, and executives of think tanks during
his two-day stay in Brussel, trying to win their support for
Taiwan's WHO bid.
