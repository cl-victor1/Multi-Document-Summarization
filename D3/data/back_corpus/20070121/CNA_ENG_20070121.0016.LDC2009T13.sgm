DPP, TSU MIGHT CO-INITIATE EXTRA LEGISLATIVE SESSION
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  Jan.  21 (CNA) 01/21/07  18:10:28 (By Luis Huang)

The legislative caucus of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) will meet with its counterpart from the allied Taiwan
Solidarity Union (TSU) Monday to discuss whether to co-initiate a
motion for an extraordinary legislative session, a DPP legislator
said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Ker Chien-ming, chief convener of the DPP legislative caucus,
told CNA reporters that lawmakers from the two parties will
discuss what bills should be placed on the priority list if the
Legislative Yuan convenes an extra session.
</P>
<P>
If the DPP caucus and its TSU counterpart reach a consensus on
the issue, both parties will jointly put forward a motion asking
the legislature to call an extraordinary session to deal with
several major bills, Ker said.
</P>
<P>
Ker stated the DPP caucus insists that a central government
budget plan for 2007 be dealt with first during the extra
session, followed by a draft amendment to the Organizational
Rules for the Labor Retirement Fund Supervisory Committee and a
draft revision to the Banking Law that would allow the government
to publish the names of major bank loan defaulters in a bid to
clamp down on financial irregularities.
</P>
<P>
The Executive Yuan-submitted budget plan for 2007 failed to pass
in the legislative session that ended Jan. 19 due to incessant
bickering  between the ruling and opposition  parties over an
opposition-proposed draft law on the organization of the Central
Election Commission (CEC) , according to which CEC members would
be recommended by political parties in proportion to the number
of their legislative seats.
</P>
<P>
According to Ker, the DPP caucus will also push for the
legislation of various "sunshine" bills, including a lobbying
bill, a draft amendment to the Political Donations Law, a bill on
party assets management, and a draft revision to the Public
Functionary Assets Disclosure Law, which are aimed at ensuring
clean politics.
</P>
<P>
For his part, Wu Tun-yi, secretary-general of the main opposition
Kuomintang (KMT), said that the KMT caucus would agree to the
holding of an extra legislative session only if its draft CEC
organizational law would be put at the top of the agenda.
</P>
<P>
When the legislature's Procedure Committee listed the draft
amendment Jan. 16 as the top bill to be discussed during the
final two plenary sessions, the DPP caucus did not express
opposition to such an arrangement, Wu noted, adding he has no
clue as to why DPP lawmakers adopted an obstruction approach on
the final day of the just-concluded legislative session.
</P>
<P>
Describing the CEC as a "black agency" whose establishment lacks
a legal basis, Wu stressed that CEC members should be recommended
by political parties in proportion to the number of seats they
hold in the legislature and live up to the people's expectations.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Huang Yi-chiao, executive director of the opposition
People First Party's Central Policy Committee, reiterated his
party's firm opposition to holding an extra legislative session,
which he said would not be necessary if the DPP caucus had
respected the agenda approved by the legislature's Procedure
Committee.
