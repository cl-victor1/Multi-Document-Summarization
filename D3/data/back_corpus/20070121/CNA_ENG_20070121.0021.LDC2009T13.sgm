Taipei,  Jan. 21 (CNA) 01/21/07  19:09:21 (By Y.L.Kao)

<P>
Visually impaired people need to exercise regularly  to  stay
healthy, according  to  Weng  Lin-chung, superintendent of the
Renai branch of Taipei City Hospital.
</P>
<P>
Weng said that he found a higher rate of obesity and health
issues among the visually impaired after Renai hospital launched
a free physical check-up event for them.
</P>
<P>
The physical examination includes physical measurements, a blood
pressure check, urine tests, bone density tests and cancer
screening.
</P>
<P>
During the check-up procedures, one man required 10 glasses of
water before it was possible to provide a urine sample, while
another entirely blind man who works as a masseur was told that
he is overweight, and admitted that he hardly does any exercise
due to a loss of strength and time constraints.
</P>
<P>
Weng noted that most visually impaired people do not make a habit
of undertaking regular exercise, except for walking, and do not
have balanced diets.
</P>
<P>
He added that it can be difficult for the visually impaired to
access health information, in part because of safety concerns
when they travel about on the street.
</P>
<P>
As a result, they are incline towards obesity, are at a higher
risk for cardiovascular disease, and tend to delay urination
because it is difficult to find or use public facilities.
</P>
<P>
Weng advised the visually impaired to undertake  30-minute
exercises at least three times each week and encouraged them to
avail themselves of the free physical examination to be offered
at the hospital Saturday.
