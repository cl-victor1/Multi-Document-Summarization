The government should communicate with the industrial sector
before formulating its policies on drafting a basic law for
Taiwan's production industries, an industry leader said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Chen Wu-shyon, chairman of the Taipei-based Chinese National
Federation of Industries, noted that the basic law being drafted
by the Ministry of Economic Affairs is aimed at helping Taiwan's
industries further upgrade their competitiveness through
industrial renovation and the development of industrial parks.
</P>
<P>
Chen suggested that the new legislation should provide greater
support for Taiwan's industries than the Statute for Upgrading
Industry, which is scheduled to expire in 2009, or at least
incorporate the existing law into the new act.
</P>
<P>
He said industry leaders will be willing to cooperate with the
government as long as the draft law is beneficial to the long-
term development of Taiwan's industries as a whole.
</P>
<P>
However, Chen added, there should be full communication between
the government and the industrial  sector before a policy is
formulated on the matter.
