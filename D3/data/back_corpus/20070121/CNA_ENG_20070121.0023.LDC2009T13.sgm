CDC URGES CHINA TO MAKE PUBLIC INFORMATION ABOUT LATEST EPIDEMIC

Taipei,  Jan. 21 (CNA) 01/21/07  19:36:27 (By Deborah Kuo)

<P>
The Center for Disease Control (CDC) urged China Sunday to
ascertain the truth regarding reports of the latest outbreak of
disease in Guangdong Province and make public the information
soon.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on reports that an unknown number of patients at the
Guangdong Eighth  People's  Hospital  have been isolated  for
unidentified reasons, CDC Deputy Director Shih Wen-yi urged the
Chinese health authorities to disclose whether these people were
suspected of contracting avian influenza or had been afflicted
with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), and urged Taiwan
and other neighboring countries to remain alert against the
possible outbreak of epidemic disease.
</P>
<P>
Shih said the Chinese health authorities have not yet informed
Taiwan of any suspected bird flu or SARS cases reported in
Guangdong.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that it took about one month for Chinese health
authorities to inform the World Health Organization after a human
infection of bird flu virus was confirmed in China's central
province of Anhui late last year.
</P>
<P>
Shih also called for Taiwan passengers who travel back and forth
between Taiwan and Guangdong Province to pay extra attention to
their temperature on daily basis and report to Taiwan's health
authorities if they develop fever for unknown reasons.
</P>
<P>
Shih made the calls following the Hong Kong-based Sing Tao Daily
quoted online reports Sunday that an unknown number of patients
at the Guangdong  Eighth People's Hospital have been quarantined,
probably as a result of an avian flu outbreak.
</P>
<P>
Sing Tao Daily said another source asserted that those patients
had contracted SARS and that the number affected was dozens.
</P>
<P>
The daily,  however,  quoted authorities of the Hong Kong
Department of Health as saying that they had not received any
information concerning the latest reports of an epidemic as of
Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
According to Shih, Vietnam, Hong Kong and Japan have reported
bird flu outbreaks this month, while Indonesian officials said
four people died recently from the virulent H5N1 virus. Myanmar
reported its first H5N1 outbreak in chickens and quail last March
at farms in central Myanmar. Bird flu killed 42 of the 93 people
infected in Vietnam in 2003-2005.
</P>
<P>
Bird flu, which does not easily infect humans, has so far killed
161 people globally since 2003, a relatively small number
compared to other diseases, according to the World Health
Organization. But epidemiologists fear H5N1 virus could trigger a
global pandemic if it were to mutate and become easily
transmitted among humans.
