Taipei,  April  6 (CNA) 04/06/07  20:08:53 (By Lilian Wu)

Premier Su Tseng-chang will set up a campaign office next Tuesday
as the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) primary to
choose its candidate for the 2008 presidential election gradually
shifts into high gear.
</P>
<P>
As the premier must attend the Legislative Yuan for a question-
and-answer session that day, he will not be able to attend its
opening.
</P>
<P>
Former Taipei City Councilman Lan Shih-tsung will serve as the
director of the office, located at the intersection of Xinyi Road
and Jinshan South Road, while DPP Legislator Lin Yu-sheng will
serve as office spokesman.
</P>
<P>
Lan said that the office will initially be divided into two
divisions: campaign literature and organization. Time permitting,
he hopes to include divisions on women's issues and social
welfare.
</P>
<P>
Su is the third of four DPP presidential hopefuls to announce the
launch of a campaign office, following former Premier Frank Hsieh
and DPP Chairman Yu Shyi- kun. Vice President Annette Lu is the
only one who has yet to announce the launch of a campaign office.
</P>
<P>
According to the DPP's primary mechanism, party members will vote
in early May, which will account for 30 percent of the final
tally, after which a series of public opinion polls accounting
for the remaining 70 percent will be held. The winner of the
combined polls will be announced as the party's presidential
candidate May 30.
