DPP TO DRUM UP SUPPORT FOR REFERENDUM ON KMT'S ILL-GOTTEN ASSETS
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  April 6 (CNA) 04/06/07  18:50:09 (By Lilian Wu)

Ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) Chairman Yu Shyi-kun
said Friday that the party will sponsor 100 speeches around the
island to drum up support for its campaign to retrieve the ill-
gotten assets of the Kuomintang through a national referendum.
</P>
<P>
Yu said at a news conference that the speeches will kick off in
Kaohsiung Saturday, on the 18th anniversary of pro-democracy
activist Cheng Nan-jung's death.
</P>
<P>
In 1989, Cheng was charged with insurrection for reprinting a
draft constitution for the Republic of Taiwan. Cheng refused to
appear in court, and when police arrived to arrest him on April
7, he committed suicide by self-immolation.
</P>
<P>
Yu criticized the KMT for refusing to return its ill-gotten
assets to the nation, saying that a proposed bill to retrieve
ill-gotten assets of the political party has been blocked by the
opposition-controlled legislature, and that is why the DPP has to
resort to retrieval through a national referendum.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the first-stage of signature-collection to make
this a valid proposal had been successful, but the campaign will
need at least 830,000 signatures in the second-stage to make it
to a national referendum.
</P>
<P>
The DPP has set a goal of collecting one million signatures by
July, but Yu acknowledged that it is falling behind in reaching
that goal.
</P>
<P>
The party hopes to drum up support through the worldwide
speeches, he said.
</P>
<P>
As party chairmen, Yu should be responsible for soliciting 5,000
signatures, but he said that he is willing to raise the quota by
10 times to 50,000 signatures, urging all party members to step
up their efforts and to make this their top priority.
</P>
<P>
Yu said that the DPP administration has ruled the nation for
seven years, but that public trust in the party has been
compromised because a number of the party's promises have fallen
through.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that the party will stick to its guns on
this matter at least, saying that the matter depends on "will and
determination."
