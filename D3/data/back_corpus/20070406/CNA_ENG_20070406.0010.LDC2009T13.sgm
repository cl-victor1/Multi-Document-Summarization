Taipei,  April  6 (CNA) 04/06/07  16:26:30 (By Lilian Wu)

<P>
President Chen Shui-bian dismissed as "fabricated" reports that
he has favored a specific individual from among the four
presidential aspirants of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP).
</P>
<P>
The president was responding to reports by the Apple Daily, a
local tabloid, during his visit to his hometown in Tainan County.
</P>
<P>
The reports said that Chen has met with DPP heavyweights over the
past several days during which he expressed the hope that they
will help Premier Su more. The reports said that this showed his
formal endorsement of Su.
</P>
<P>
But the president didn't say if he will continue to mediate among
the four hopefuls -- Vice President Annette Lu, Premier Su,
former Premier Frank Hsieh and DPP Chairman Yu Shyi-kun.
</P>
<P>
The Presidential Office earlier termed the reports as "purely
speculation." The office said in a press release that the
president has always wanted the four to engage in a "fair"
competition so as to produce a candidate that has the best chance
of winning the 2008 presidential election.
</P>
<P>
"The president will by no means have preset stance on who should
represent the DPP to run for president," the press release said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile,  Vice President  Lu said that the reports  are
"misinformation, " adding that she believes Chen's recent
meetings with legislators were aimed at learning about the
situation regarding the year-end legislative elections so as to
facilitate coordination among the legislative hopefuls.
</P>
<P>
DPP Chairman Yu said that he has never heard that President Chen
endorses Su and that he couldn't comment on the reports.
