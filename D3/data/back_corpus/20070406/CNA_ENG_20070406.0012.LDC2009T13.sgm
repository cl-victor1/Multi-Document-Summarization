TAIWAN TERMINATES CONTRACT WITH U.S. PR FIRM BGR
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Washington,  April  5 (CNA) 04/06/07  17:07:39 (By Chiehyu Lin
and Deborah Kuo)
</P>
<P>
Taiwan's top representative in the United States, David Tawei
Lee, confirmed Thursday that the Republic of China government has
terminated a contract with U.S. public relations firm Barbour
Griffith &amp; Rogers (BGR) , a year before the three-year
contract expires.
</P>
<P>
Lee,  nevertheless,  stressed  that the reasons behind the
earlier-than-planned rescinding of the BGR hiring contract are
not those claimed by the China Times in a report Friday in
Taipei.
</P>
<P>
Lee said the report was untrue particularly in its claim that his
office, the Taipei Economic and Cultural Representative Office in
Washington, D.C., has rescinded the contract with BGR under
pressure exerted by officials from the U.S. State Department.
</P>
<P>
As to what were the real "reasons, " the outgoing envoy said it's
inconvenient for him to disclose them.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Taiwan Vice President Annette Lu said Friday in Taipei
that it is essential now for the government to launch an overall
review of Taiwan's hiring U.S. PR firms to smooth U.S.-Taiwan
connections.
</P>
<P>
Several PR firms have been hired as part of the communications
channels between Taiwan and the United States. The PR firms major
tasks include smoothing communications between Taiwan and the
U.S. Congress and government and enabling the United States to
better understand Taiwan's interest in promoting democracy, human
rights and peace at home and internationally.
</P>
<P>
Tacitly referring to BGR, Lu said some U.S. PR firms are
prohibitively and unreasonably expensive to hire, adding that she
has expressed her opinions on this concern to President Chen
Shui-bian as well.
</P>
<P>
Lu said that U.S.-Taiwan relations have been up and down over the
past several years, although it is true that "diplomacy is an
extension of a country's domestic affairs, " adding that
diplomatic work will become smoother once domestic issues are
successfully handled.
</P>
<P>
Lu said the government should let the people be the government's
diplomatic backup, adding that a fully-fledged democracy with a
developed and flourishing economy is the best diplomatic weapon
that a country can have, instead of spending a fortune to hire
certain individuals to lobby for Taiwan. Unconfirmed sources have
said that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs signed a three-year
contract with BGR in March 2005, under which the ministry was to
pay US$4.5 million to the Washington-based PR firm from 2005 to
2008 for its lobbying efforts.
