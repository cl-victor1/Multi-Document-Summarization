The Netherlands-Taiwan Association, together with Rotary clubs in
Holland and Taiwan, will donate an ambulance to Keelung City's
volunteer fire fighting team, Taiwan's representative to the
Netherlands Wang Yu-yuan told CNA correspondent in Brussels
Friday.

The association's president Peter Pex and vice president Ruud
Hoorweg initiated the donation drive with US$5,000, Wang said,
adding that the Rotary clubs of South Holland, Taipei, Taipei
Tienmu, and the Rotary Foundation all contributed to the purchase
of an ambulance for the volunteer fire fighting team, which
receives no government subsidies.

The ambulance is to be delivered this week, and the association
has also promised to donate NT$50,000 (US$1,500) to St. Annes'
Home for Seriously Retarded Children in Tienmu, Taipei City.
