Taipei,  April 6 (CNA) 04/06/07  19:25:39 (By Y.L. Kao)

<P>
The Intelligent Property Office (IPO) has launched an online
forum at its Web site, inviting the public to submit their
opinions on proposed revisions to Intellectual Property Laws, an
IPO official said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The IPO plans to have legislation related to patent, trademark
right and copyright revised in response to the development of new
technologies and changes in the global environment surrounding
intelligent property rights, according to the official.
</P>
<P>
The official said that the current Patent Law, promulgated in
July, 2004, does not allow for patents on animal or plant
inventions, but a resolution passed by the Executive Yuan's
Biotechnology Industry Guidance Task force requires the IPO to
change it.
</P>
<P>
While considering new developments touching on enforcement of
compulsory licenses for pharmaceutical and medical device
patents, the IPO decided to revise the Patent Law.
</P>
<P>
As for the Trademark Law, although it has undergone several
revisions, room remains for improvements in the implementation of
the law, and the IPO is set to make adjustments consistent with
the Trademark Law Treaty adopted by the World Intellectual
Property Organization, the official said.
</P>
<P>
He added that since problems arose in November 1997 concerning
Copyright provisions in dealing with copyright agencies, the law
has also been in need of revision.
</P>
<P>
The official said that to ensure that amendments to relevant laws
are made more comprehensive, the IPO will hold public hearings,
forums and make relevant documents and materials available to the
general public, all in order to gather valuable information on
public opinions for the Office's reference.
