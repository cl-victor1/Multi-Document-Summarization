CHINA'S MILITARY DEPLOYMENTS FACTOR IN CROSS-STRAIT INSTABILITY:
U.S.
</HEADLINE>

Washington,  Feb. 24 (CNA) 02/24/07  18:32:11 (By Chiehyu Lin and
Y.F. Low)
</P>
<P>
The U.S. government needs to take into account all factors
affecting stability across the Taiwan Strait in dealing with
cross-strait issues, which include China's military deployments
against Taiwan and the lack of high-level political contact
between the two sides, a U.S. official said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, the United States has encouraged Beijing to make
contact with the Taiwan government, said Thomas Christensen,
deputy assistant secretary of state for East Asian and Pacific
affairs with responsibility for China, Taiwan and Mongolia.
</P>
<P>
Christensen made the remarks during a Hong Kong TV interview when
asked to comment on Beijing's criticism that the United States
has failed to take any substantial steps to try to stop the trend
toward independence in Taiwan, with the exception of making some
strongly worded statements.
</P>
<P>
Christensen reiterated that the United States does not support
Taiwan independence and is opposed to any unilateral action by
either Taiwan or China to change the status quo.
</P>
<P>
While people have often focused their attention on action taken
by Taiwan, the United States needs to also take into
consideration other factors that cause cross-strait instability,
Christensen said.
</P>
<P>
He said the United States aims to maintain peace and stability
across the Taiwan Strait and hopes Taiwan and China will find a
peaceful, mutually acceptable resolution to their differences.
</P>
<P>
On Taiwan's recent move to change the names of state-owned
enterprises that contain references to China, Christensen noted
that the United States has taken a clear and consistent stand on
this issue, namely that Washington expects President Chen Shui-
bian to honor the commitments he has made publicly, including
those made in his 2000 inaugural address.
</P>
<P>
He said the United States takes Chen's pledges seriously and that
the statement released recently by the State Department has
addressed the issue in a very appropriate manner.
</P>
<P>
In the statement issued Feb. 9, the State Department said the
United States does not support administrative steps by Taiwan
that would appear to change Taiwan's status unilaterally or move
toward independence,  including  changes  in terminology  for
entities administered by the Taiwan authorities.
</P>
<P>
The State Department also called on Chen to fulfill his "four
noes" commitments, namely not to declare independence, not to
change Taiwan's national title, not to push for inclusion of
sovereignty themes in the Constitution, and not to promote a
referendum to change the status quo regarding independence or
unification.
