In light of a significant increase in the amount of leftovers
during the one- week Chinese New Year holiday, the Environment
Protection Administration (EPA) urged the public in a news
release Saturday to adopt an environmentally friendly "green
diet."
</P>
<P>
Leftovers account for around a quarter of the garbage generated
by the average household per day on average, according to the
EPA. Based on this calculation, the whole country produces 4,500
tons of leftovers every normal day.
</P>
<P>
During the Chinese New Year festival -- one of the most important
traditional festivals in Chinese society -- extra leftovers are
generated, the EPA news release said.
</P>
<P>
The EPA called for the public to follow its "green diet, " in
which followers "cook only the dishes they can finish" and "order
only the dishes they can finish when dining out."
</P>
<P>
They should also "classify" any leftovers, the EPA said.
</P>
<P>
Taipei County, Taipei City, Taichung City, Changhua County, Yilan
County and Taitung County are the best at recycling leftovers,
according to the press release, which added that the EPA has
invited 16 experts in the field of waste management to visit all
25 cities and counties in the country to examine and review their
efforts to recycle kitchen waste and old furniture.
