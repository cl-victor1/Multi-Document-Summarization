President Chen Shui-bian might begin mediating presidential
hopefuls in the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) after
the registration deadline for its primary ends March 9, a ranking
government official said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
According to the Executive Yuan official, Chen will mediate to
help the DPP field the most "winnable" candidate to run in the
March 2008 presidential election during the period from March 9
until late April.
</P>
<P>
DPP aspirants can register to run in the party's presidential
primary from March 5 to March 9, and the party is slated to make
public its official presidential candidate May 30.
</P>
<P>
Should Chen's mediation fail to produce a presidential candidate,
the party will then have to resort to its primary mechanism -- a
composite of public opinion polls and a direct vote among party
members -- to screen a hopeful to run in the presidential race,
the official said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Premier Su Tseng-chang was expected to announce his
participation in the DPP's presidential primary Sunday, following
in the footsteps of former Premier Frank Hsieh and DPP Chairman
Yu Shyi-kun, who made public their intentions to seek the party's
nomination Feb. 16 and Feb. 22, respectively.
</P>
<P>
Vice President Annette Lu is the only one of the DPP's four top
heavyweights who had yet to announce her presidential ambition
and she continued to refuse to discuss the issue Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Hsieh, also a former Kaohsiung mayor, called for a "democratic
demeanor" in the DPP's mediation process, because "the DPP is a
democratic and institutional political party" and because "it is
vital to restore public confidence in the party."
