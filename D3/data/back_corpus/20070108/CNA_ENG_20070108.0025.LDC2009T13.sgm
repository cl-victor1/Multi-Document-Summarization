President Chen Shui-bian voiced the hope Monday that his upcoming
visit to Nicaragua to attend President-elect Daniel Ortega's
inauguration slated for Jan. 10 will be a success.

Chen, who is scheduled to head for Nicaragua via San Francisco
later Monday, made the remarks while receiving Junior Chamber
International  (JCI)  World President  Scott Greenlee  at the
Presidential Office.

On behalf of the government and people of Taiwan, as well as in
his capacity of member No. 1228 of the Taiwan Junior Chamber
(TJC) , Chen warmly welcomed Greenlee, who is visiting Taiwan to
take part in the inauguration of TJC President Hsu Yu-ming.

Chen told his guest that shortly after he assumed office in 2000,
he attended a JCI Asia-Pacific congress held in late May of that
year in Kaohsiung.

<P>
He further said he will also take part in the 2007 JCI Asia-
Pacific Congress slated for May in Chungli City, Taoyuan County.

The head of state claimed that it is rare for a nation's
president to attend the event twice during his term, which he
said demonstrates his full support for the organization.
