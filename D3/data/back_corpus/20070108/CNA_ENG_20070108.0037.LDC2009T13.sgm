degree Celsius, including distributing blankets and sleeping bags
as well as arranging for them to get into a center for the
homeless.

International.

Hsu Chuang-sheng, director of the Department of Social Affairs of
the Kaohsiung city government, said the department has registered

come in during the cooler weather. Reports said that several
