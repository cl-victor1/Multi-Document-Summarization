Taiwan Railway Administration (TRA) and Taiwan High-Speed Rail
Corp. (THSRC) promised Monday to make improvements following
complaints by physically challenged people about restrictions on
using guide dogs on these two systems.
</P>
<P>
In a news conference held at the Legislative Yuan, opposition
Kuomintang Legislator Joanna Lei and Hui Kuang Guide Dog Centre
pointed out that a law protecting the physically and mentally
challenged stipulates that guide dogs and their users and
trainers can have access to any public place without extra charge
or other strings attached.

<P>
Violators will be fined between NT$10,000 (US$305) and NT$30,000,
they said. However, TRA and THSRC have both continued to demand
that the users and trainers of guide dogs must apply for access
beforehand, they pointed out.

Chi Wen-cheng, a visually impaired person who uses a guide dog,
said that most users of guide dogs cannot see at all and that get
advance permits before going any places is extremely difficult.
She asked for understanding for those who are visually impaired.

<P>
Trainer Kao Yi-Hsueh noted that the more thorny question lies
with young guide dogs, saying that they have yet to complete
training and are less stable than adult guide dogs. However, she
added, taking the young guide dogs to public places, such as
malls, restaurants or bus stations, is part of their training.
</P>
<P>
Officials of the two rail systems promised that they will deal
with the issue according to the law. A TRA official also said
that the system has since 1996 notified all stations about the
free access that guide dogs enjoy under the law and that the
staff probably have mistaken guide dogs as regular pets on
occasion. He promised that the system will step up its campaign
to facilitate the movement of physically challenged people.
