KMT COLLECTS ENOUGH SIGNATURES IN BID TO RECALL KEELUNG MAYOR

Taipei,   Jan.  8  (CNA) 01/08/07  16:01:41 (By Elizabeth Hsu)

The opposition Kuomintang (KMT) has completed the first of three
challenging tasks in its attempt to recall Keelung Mayor Hsu
Tsai-li,  who has been convicted on corruption charges,
soliciting the required number of signatures from voters in the
northern port city to formally submit a recall proposal.
</P>
<P>
The KMT Keelung chapter has collected a total of 6,803 signatures
since launching its campaign to oust Hsu nearly two weeks ago,
chapter chief Chiang Shih-liang said Monday, adding that his
chapter has been faced with "great pressure" to push for the
removal of the mayor, whom the KMT had made all-out efforts to
help get re-elected in 2005.
</P>
<P>
Under the Election and Recall Law, a proposal aimed at recalling
the Keelung mayor requires the endorsement of 5,847 voters to be
formally submitted. In the second phase, another 38,003
signatures are required for the Central Election Commission (CEC)
to hold a vote.
</P>
<P>
After the KMT submits the proposal to the CEC, it will have 60
days to solicit the required number of signatures to support the
proposal, Chang Wang-hau, a KMT executive member in charge of the
recall campaign, said at a press conference that he held along
with Chiang and KMT Culture and Communications Committee acting
Director Huang Yu-chen.
</P>
<P>
According to the law, if half of the 292,330 eligible voters in
the 2005 Keelung mayoral elections -- or 146,165 -- turn out to
vote and a majority of the valid ballots agree to kick Hsu out,
then the recall will succeed.
</P>
<P>
Hsu was re-elected on the KMT's ticket in November 2005 but was
kicked out of the party after he was handed a seven-year prison
sentence Sept. 19 last year after being found guilty of trying to
use his position to sell land to the city government.
</P>
<P>
As Hsu is protected by law from recall attempts within the first
year of his term, the KMT, which has been criticized for
nominating Hsu in 2005 when he was being investigated by
prosecutors on corruption charges, decided to wait until the
second year of his term, which began on Dec. 25 last year, to
push for his removal.
