Opposition Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU) Acting Chairman Lin
Chih-chia voiced the hope Monday that Huang Kun-huei, secretary-
general of the Taiwan Advocates think tank will agree to serve as
TSU chairman, but Huang is still considering whether to assume
the post.
</P>
<P>
Lin said that TSU legislators will continue to push for Huang to
succeed Su Chin-ching as the party's leader. Su quit the
chairmanship due to TSU's setback in the Dec. 9 mayoral and
councilor elections in Taipei and Kaohsiung.
</P>
<P>
According to Lin, all members of the TSU legislative caucus, led
by Chief Convener Liao Pen-yen, visited Taiwan Advocates last
week to persuade Huang to act as the party's chairman.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Ho Min-hao, executive director of the TSU's Central
Policy Committee, said the TSU Central Executive Committee (CEC)
will set a timetable for electing the party's chairman during a
meeting to be held next week.
</P>
<P>
Ho further said the CEC has adopted a resolution in favor of
relocating the nation's capital from Taipei to southern Taiwan,
but that the destination for the proposed capital relocation has
yet to be discussed.
</P>
<P>
He also disclosed that the TSU will start planning the nomination
of candidates for legislative elections slated for late next year
after the party's new chairman assumes office.
