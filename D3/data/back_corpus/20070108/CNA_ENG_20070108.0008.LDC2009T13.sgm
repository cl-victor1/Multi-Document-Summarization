<P>
President Chen Shui-bian is scheduled to head for Taiwan's
Central American diplomatic ally Nicaragua later Monday  to
attend  Nicaraguan  Presiden-elect Daniel  Ortega's inauguration
at the head of a Taiwan delegation.
</P>
<P>
Chen and his entourage are scheduled to make a one-night transit
stop in San Francisco en route to Nicaragua and a three-hour
stopover in Los Angeles on their way back to Taiwan Jan. 12, the
Presidential Office reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
It will mark the second time that President Chen sets his foot on
the U.S. soil following his stopover in Miami, Florida in October
2005 en route to Guatemala for a state visit.
</P>
<P>
During his two-day visit in Nicaragua Jan. 10-11, Chen is
scheduled to meet with Taiwan expatriate leaders, Taiwan
volunteers and Taiwan military conscripts working in Nicaragua.
He will also hold two news conferences, Presidential Office
officials said.
</P>
<P>
Vice President Annette Lu, Premier Su Tseng-chang and other
ranking government officials will be on hand to bid farewell to
the president at the airport at around 7:00 p.m..
</P>
<P>
Chen's entourage will include ruling Democratic Progressive Party
Chairman Yu Shyi-kun, Taoyuan Magistrate Chu Li-lun, Tainan Mayor
Hsu Tien-tsai, Kaohsiung Magistrate Yang Chiu-hsing and six
business leaders,  including Taiwan Power Co. President Chen
Kuei-ming, according to the Presidential Office.
</P>
<P>
Shortly after Ortega's electoral victory in November last year,
Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Hou Ching-shan visited Nicaragua
at the head of a working-level delegation  to hold talks  with
ministers-designate of the incoming Ortega administration.
</P>
<P>
As Ortega said during the presidential campaign that if elected,
he would switch diplomatic recognition from Taipei to Beijing,
Chen's upcoming visit to Nicaragua is considered a fence-mending
effort to warm up bilateral exchanges between the two countries.
