LEGISLATIVE SPEAKER RESERVED ABOUT PRESIDENTIAL BID
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Hong Kong,  March 16 (CNA) 03/16/07  17:30:56 (By Y. K. Lin and
Flor Wang)
</P>
<P>
Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng has told the Hong Kong-
based Apple Daily in an exclusive interview that he will not
rashly announce his presidential bid and that he will do so only
when having found workable solutions to Taiwan's crises.
</P>
<P>
According  to Wang,  a member of Taiwan's main opposition
Kuomintang (KMT) , it is too early to talk about his presidential
ambitions now as the KMT has yet to elect a new chairman.
</P>
<P>
"I have been thinking of feasible ways to help Taiwan's people
lead a good life and effectively overcome the four crises facing
the country -- financial hollowing, economic marginalization,
wealth gap and cross-Taiwan Strait confrontation,"  Wang said in
the interview that was carried in the daily's Friday edition.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, he pointed out, Taiwan has also been dragged by
three major problems centering on how to stabilize cross-strait
relations, bolster ethnic harmony and build mutual trust between
opposition and ruling parties.
</P>
<P>
"I will not rush to announce my presidential aspiration for the
time being, and I have fully left related matters to be dealt
with by KMT Honorary Chairman Lien Chan," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The KMT stands a good chance of gaining back power in 2008 as
long as it fields a qualified ticket and does something that
really touches the hearts of the people," he said.
</P>
<P>
But before scoring victory in the next presidential race, the KMT
needs to win more than half of the seats at the Legislative Yuan
in December's election to solidify its power base, Wang said.
</P>
<P>
Wang and former KMT Chairman Ma Ying-jeou have been widely viewed
as the party's most likely candidates to pair up a presidential
ticket against rivals of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party.
</P>
<P>
However, Wang was reserved to talk about the formation of a Ma-
Wang ticket or Wang-Ma ticket representing the KMT in the 2008
presidential race, criticizing that "all of that is sheer
speculation by aides" and refusing to make any comment on the
issue by saying that "my term as legislative speaker will expire
in next January."
