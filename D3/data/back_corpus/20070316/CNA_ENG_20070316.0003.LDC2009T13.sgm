President Chen Shui-bian said Thursday he looks forward to seeing
the Central Taiwan Science Park in central Taichung County become
the world's most competitive industrial hub.
</P>
<P>
Chen made the remarks while attending a name plaque unveiling
ceremony for the Central Taiwan Science Park Administration
(CTSPA) office. Also present at the occasion were Premier Su
Tseng-chang, Taichung County Magistrate Huang Chung- sheng and
the CTSPA Director Yang Wen-ko.

<P>
Noting that the establishment of the science park was one of his
2000 presidential campaign promise, Chen said he takes pleasure
in seeing the park's phenomenal growth in the past few years.
</P>
<P>
"When the park's preparatory office began operations slightly
more than three years ago, the site was a sugarcane farm. With
concerted efforts of central and county governments, the park has
soon blossomed into one of the most attractive domestic
investment destinations," Chen touted.
</P>
<P>
The CTSPA now accommodates 85 high-tech companies, with more than
NT$1.7 trillion in accumulated capital investment, Chen said,
adding that the park has so far created over 17,000 jobs.
</P>
<P>
"The park's from rags to riches success story is now widely known
as the Tatushan Legend, " Chen said. Tatushan is a major mountain
in central Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Chen said the central government will continue cooperating with
the local government in pushing for further development of the
science park to bolster overall economic development in the
grater Taichung area.
