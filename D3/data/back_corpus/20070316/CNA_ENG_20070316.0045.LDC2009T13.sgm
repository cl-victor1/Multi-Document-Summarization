<P>
President Chen Shui-bian said Friday the abundance of versions
for Taiwan's constitutional reengineering indicates that the road
to enacting a new constitution for the country would be bumpy.
</P>
<P>
Chen made the remarks while meeting with scholars from the United
States, Japan and Germany who are here to attend an international
seminar on constitutional evolution and reengineering to be held
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Noting that one of the "four wants" highlighted in his recent
policy declaration refers to write a new constitution that is
timely and relevant to Taiwan, Chen said at least 15 different
versions for the country's ambitious constitutional reform have
been initiated by verious social and academic groups.
</P>
<P>
The diversity and abundance  of the constitutional  reform
proposals envision risks, challenges and tribulations that may
lie ahead in the pursuit of the ambitious goal.
</P>
<P>
For all real or potential obstacles that may stand in the way,
Chen said his administration is determined to carry out the
difficult project.
</P>
<P>
As the U.S., Germany and Japan all have rich experience in
constitutional amendments and reform, Chen said he hopes the
schoalrs from the three countries can provide useful tips during
the seminar for Taiwan's reference.
