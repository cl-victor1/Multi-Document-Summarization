The Bureau of High Speed Rail is studying a plan to allow the
number of daily high speed rail runs to be increased from March
31, bureau Director-General Pang Chia-hua said Friday, hinting
that the plan might be approved next week.

The remarks came after the Taiwan High Speed Rail Corp. (THSRC)
submitted a first-phase plan to the bureau to increase the number
of daily runs on the line.

According to the plan, the company wishes to add an additional
six round trips per day. At present, there are 19 round trips per
day departing every hour.

Meanwhile, the THSRC will increase the scope of its telephone
ticket booking system from March 20, from 25 phone lines to 60,
as requested by the bureau, Pang noted.

As of March 12, the bureau had issued driving licenses to a total
of 46 train drivers, Pang said, adding that by the end of June,
38 Taiwanese drivers are expected to have completed training and
entered service.
