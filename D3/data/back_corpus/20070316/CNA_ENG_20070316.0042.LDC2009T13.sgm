Taipei, March 16 (CNA) 03/16/07  23:00:59 (By Y.C. Jou)

Former Legislator Lin Cheng-chieh faces 50 days in jail for his
televised attack against political commentator Chin Heng-wei
seven months ago, the Taiwan High Court ruled Friday.
</P>
<P>
The case is finalized but the penalty can be commuted into a fine
of NT$1,000 (US$30) per day of detention, the court said.
</P>
<P>
The incident occurred Aug. 24, 2006 when Lin and Chin, along with
various other people, took part in a Formosa TV (FTV) live talk
show debating the then-heated issue of toppling President Chen
Shui-bian.
</P>
<P>
The quarrel between Lin, a critic of Chen, and Chin, who backed
the president, turned into a shocking scene of thuggishness when
Lin punched Chin in the face and continued to kick him after he
fell from his chair, breaking Chin's nose.
</P>
<P>
The show continued after Chin was hospitalized. Lin apologized to
the host Hu Wan-ling, FTV and its audience but showed no signs of
repentance in his hatred of Chin, claiming he would in the future
"beat up Chin every single time I see him." Chin afterward sued
Lin for assault and intimidation.
</P>
<P>
The Taipei District Court last December ruled Lin guilty of
assault but not guilty of intimidation. The High Court Friday
turned down Lin's appeal and reaffirmed the previous judgment.
