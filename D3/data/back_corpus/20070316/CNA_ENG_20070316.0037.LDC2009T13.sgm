TAIWAN SHOULD BE FREE FROM CHINA THREATS: PREMIER
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  March  16  (CNA) 03/16/07  21:13:12 (By Flor Wang)

<P>
As an independent and peace-loving country, Taiwan's existence
must be free from China's threats, Premier Su Tseng-chang said
Friday.
</P>
<P>
Su made the remarks during an interpellation session at the
Legislative Yuan while responding to a proposal by main
opposition Kuomintang (KMT) lawmaker Lin Chien-jung, who
suggested that the government consider making Taiwan a permanent
neutral country instead of seeking to join the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
Lin suggested that the government temporarily slow its pace of
pursuing Taiwan's U.N. membership and instead declare Taiwan a
permanent neutral country, as KMT Honorary Chairman Lien Chan is
slated to visit China in April and may sign a so- called "peace
accord" with Chinese officials.
</P>
<P>
Reiterating that Taiwan hopes for perpetual peace across the
Taiwan Strait and that it has never and will never invade or
provoke any other country, Su said it is most important that
Taiwan can peacefully exist and survive without threats from
other countries.
</P>
<P>
Su called for international backing for Taiwan's desire for peace
and to continue existing as a sovereign state independent from
China.
</P>
<P>
But in contrast to Taiwan's hope for perpetual peace, China
constantly has its missiles pointing at Taiwan and has never
forsworn its ambition to take Taiwan by force, Su said, adding
that it would be too good to be true if Lien's coming China visit
could help Taiwan get rid of China's military intimidation and
become a neutral country.
</P>
<P>
If Lien could help push China implement democracy and turn Taiwan
into a neutral nation, the government could make efforts toward
that goal, Su said.
</P>
<P>
However, he pointed out that only the government is entitled to
negotiate with China on issues regarding national sovereignty and
powers and that Lien has absolutely no authority in this regard.
</P>
<P>
The premier called on Lien not to yield to Beijing's "one China"
condition and urged him to refrain from any negotiation that
requires government consent.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on the same occasion, Minister of Foreign Affairs James
Huang said Taiwan's top priority at the present stage is to
safeguard its international status and fully protect its national
sovereignty and that the government will carefully assess all
feasible means that can serve that end.
