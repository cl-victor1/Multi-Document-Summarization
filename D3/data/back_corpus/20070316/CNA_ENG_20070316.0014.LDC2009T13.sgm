The number of students enrolled at National Cheng Kung University
in Tainan City, southern Taiwan who are classified as overweight
has increased over the past several years, with more than 20
percent of the freshmen in 2006 being overweight, according to
the results of a survey released Friday.

<P>
In comparison, only 15.9 percent of Cheng Kung freshmen in 2002
had a body mass index (BMI) of over 24 -- the threshold set by
the university in defining an overweight student. The figure rose
to 18.7 percent in 2003, 19.6 percent in 2004 and 18.6 percent in
2005.

The BMI, a statistical measure of the weight of a person scaled
according to height, is defined as an individual's body weight
divided by the square of their height. The World Health
Organization has defined a BMI of 18-24 as the optimal weight for
an individual.
</P>
<P>
The BMIs of Cheng Kung freshmen in 2006 categorized as overweight
were mostly at a level between 25 and 29.9, with only a few
having BMIs above 35.
</P>
<P>
In response to the growing number of overweight students, the
university has decided to open a "healthy body weight formation
camp" March 19 for all of its students and teachers, providing
the participants with well-designed weight control courses
including aerobics and healthy diet programs.
