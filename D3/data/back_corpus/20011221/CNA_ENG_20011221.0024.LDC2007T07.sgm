Banjul,  Gambia,  Dec.  20 (CNA) (By Tzou Ming-jhie and Maubo Chang)
</P>
<P>
Republic of China Vice President Annette Lu presented the newly re-
elected president of Gambia, Yahya Jammeh, with 1.5 million marbles as
an inauguration gift Thursday in the capital city of Banjul.
</P>
<P>
The marbles are used as ballots in Gambia, with each candidate having
his own box. Voters drop marbles into the boxes of the candidates they
favor.
</P>
<P>
The marbles, with special colors and sizes, are difficult to fake, and
can be used in the next elections, Jammeh explained.
</P>
<P>
There are no invalid votes when marbles are used in place of ballots,
and the possibility of election irregularities is minimized, Jammeh
said, adding that this is the system that was used when he was re-
elected president Oct. 22.
</P>
<P>
Lu lauded the ingenuity of the Gambian people in making the marble --
which is used by children in games, or as weapons by some adults --
into ballots for use in democratic elections.
</P>
<P>
She exchanged views on a broad range of issues with Jammeh and
presented him with a letter from ROC Presdient Chen Shui-bian.
</P>
<P>
According to a news release issued by Lu's entourage, Presdient Chen
sent his personal greetings to Jammeh, and looks forward to much close
ties with the west African country under Jammeh's leadership.
</P>
<P>
After an evening reception, Lu attended a dinner party hosted by ROC
ambassador Lin Chun-yi.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the party, Lu said her first day in the country has shown
her that the country deserves its nickname of "the smiling coast,"
because all the people she met, no matter whether they were government
officials or ordinary people, were all smiling -- a sign of the
nation's energy and vision.
</P>
<P>
Lu said the close ties between Taiwan and Gambia make their peoples
feel like family despite the geographical distance between them.
</P>
<P>
Lu left Taipei Wednesday night for the Gambian capital of Banjul via
Paris and arrived Thursday.
</P>
<P>
She will attend President Yahya Jammeh's Dec. 21 inauguration.
</P>
<P>
During her stay in Gambia, Lu is expected to hold talks with Gambian
leaders as well as inspect the ROC Embassy and agricultural projects
being implemented under cooperation agreements between the two
countries, according to Lu's entourage.
