CABINET RESIGNS EN MASSE
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taipei,  May 16 (CNA) 05/16/07  18:39:18 (By Flor Wang)
</P>
<P>
Premier Su Tseng-chang and his Cabinet tendered their
resignations en masse Wednesday to pave the way for Premier-
designate Chang Chun-hsiung to take over as head of the Executive
Yuan May 21.
</P>
<P>
Su presided over the weekly Executive Yuan meeting earlier in the
day -- the last of his nearly 16-month tenure, and the Cabinet
has become a caretaker one that usually would refrain from making
any major policy decisions.
</P>
<P>
Su thanked  President  Chen Shui-bian  for giving him the
opportunity to serve the country and the people but voiced regret
over the failure of the 2007 central government budget bill,
which has  been  held  up  for  more  than  six months  in  the
opposition-controlled Legislative Yuan.
</P>
<P>
He called for swift passage of the budget bill to serve the
national interest and expressed hope that he can serve the
country again.
</P>
<P>
Chang, a ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) lawmaker and
chairman of the Straits Exchanges Foundation until recently, will
assume the premiership next Monday.
</P>
<P>
It will be the second time Chang has taken over the premiership
-- he served as premier from October 2000 until January 2002,
during which he announced the halting of the construction of the
fourth nuclear power plant, precipitating a slump in the domestic
stock market.
</P>
<P>
Chang's new term will be the sixth since the DPP came to power in
2000.
</P>
<P>
In view of what they described as Chang's "poor performance"
during his first premiership, lawmakers of the main opposition
Kuomintang  (KMT)  labeled him "unqualified"  to serve as the
administrative chief.
</P>
<P>
Speaking in a Legislative Yuan news conference, KMT lawmaker Kuo
Su-chun said that Chang must provide the public with a good
explanation for why he quit the premiership last time and what
measures he will adopt to improve the economy.
</P>
<P>
Although  Chen encouraged  Chang to seek breakthroughs  in
Taiwan-China ties upon appointing him Monday, Kuo said that the
key to improving bilateral relations lies in Chen's attitude and
that Chang serves only as a tool of Chen.
</P>
<P>
Pointing out that the Cabinet to be formed by Chang will be just
a caretaker Cabinet on the grounds that there is only one year
left of Chen's presidency, Kuo claimed that Chang cannot do a
good job and said that the KMT is only looking forward to a
second transfer of power in 2008.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on a proposal by the opposition People First Party to
topple the Cabinet to be formed by Chang, KMT lawmaker Alex Fai
said that the KMT is not opposed to raising a no-confidence vote
against Chang but that the people's feelings must be taken into
account before the party decides to do so.
</P>
<P>
Fai suggested that Chang first seek to break the impasse in the
Legislative Yuan over the draft Central Election Commission
Organic Law if he wants to give a report on his policies to the
lawmakers.
