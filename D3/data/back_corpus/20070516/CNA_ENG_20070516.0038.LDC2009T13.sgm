The Investigation Bureau announced Wednesday that its agents have
busted two drug rings, seizing 87 kg of ketamine and amphetamine
with a street value of NT$300 million (US$9.09 million).
</P>
<P>
Following a tip-off, the agents learned that a drug ring headed
by Lee Po-chien was to import ketamine from Hong Kong via air
express under the cover of importing IC materials.
</P>
<P>
The agents arrested Lee in Taoyuan, northern Taiwan early this
month, seizing 85 kg of ketamine.
</P>
<P>
The agents said Lee's ring did not even bother to hide the drugs,
leading them to suspect the ring might have used the method to
smuggle the drug for years. The agents added that they were
checking if customs brokers and warehousing personnel had been
collaborating with the ring.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, they raided an amphetamine factory operated by Lee
Chun-hsien beneath a villa in Hukou, Hsinchu County, seizing 2 kg
of amphetamine.
</P>
<P>
The agents noted that since a large-scale crackdown on
amphetamine factories in Taichung, central Taiwan last year, the
supply of amphetamine has decreased significantly and its price
has surged.
</P>
<P>
Lee Chun-hsien's ring therefore shifted its factory from a remote
mountainous region in southern Taiwan to the more densely
populated region in northern Taiwan.
