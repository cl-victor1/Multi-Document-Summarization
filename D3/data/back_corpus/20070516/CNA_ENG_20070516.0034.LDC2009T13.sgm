ALLOWING CHINESE TO STUDY IN TAIWAN `UNITED FRONT' MOVE: ACADEMIC

China's decision to allow Taiwanese universities to recruit
Chinese students is part of its "united front" work, a local
scholar said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Professor Chen Chun-shan,  former director of the Graduate
Institute of National Development of National Taiwan University,
made the remarks during a seminar sponsored by the Taiwan
Advocates, a pro-Taiwan independence group founded in 2001 with
the aim of deepening Taiwan's democracy as well as Taiwan-centric
consciousness.
</P>
<P>
Chen said the Chinese Education Ministry's announcement in a
recent cross-Taiwan Strait forum that it will allow Taiwanese
universities to recruit in China is part of its strategy to annex
Taiwan through a "soft" approach.
</P>
<P>
He further said that allowing Chinese students to come to Taiwan
would "confuse the national identity of Taiwan's youth."
</P>
<P>
If the government allows Chinese students to come to Taiwan or
accredits diplomas issued by China, it will become the "public
enemy," he added.
</P>
<P>
Hsueh Hua-yuan, director of the Graduate Institute of Taiwan
History of National Chengchi University, said those in favor of
opening up to Chinese students might think it will help lure
elite students from China, upgrade Taiwan's technological and
academic competitiveness and help ease the pressure on local
universities to recruit sufficient students to keep their schools
afloat financially.
</P>
<P>
But he said that if Chinese students are to come, Taiwan will
have to accredit diplomas issued by China, which will also
involve the question of whether to accredit diplomas issued by
China to Taiwan students.
</P>
<P>
The Taiwan government does not recognize diplomas issued by
China, although many private companies have no such reservations
and in fact, the only jobs officially closed to such graduates
are public sector ones.
</P>
<P>
Hsueh also said that if Chinese students come in droves, it could
create security problems and that overstayers could also be a
social burden.
