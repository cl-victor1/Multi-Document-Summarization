TAIWAN TO APPLY TO JOIN U.N. UNDER NAME OF `TAIWAN': PRESIDENT
</HEADLINE>

Taipei, May 16 (CNA) 05/16/07  18:53:40 (By Deborah Kuo)

<P>
President Chen Shui-bian announced Wednesday that Taiwan will for
the first time apply to join the United Nations as a full member
in September under the name of "Taiwan."
</P>
<P>
Speaking to visiting Solomon Islands Prime Minister Manasseh
Sogavare during a decoration ceremony at the Presidential Office,
Chen said Taiwan unsuccessfully attempted to apply for accession
into the World Health Organization (WHO) as a full member under
the name of "Taiwan" this year, although he added that the action
drew international attention and invited constructive discussion.
</P>
<P>
Despite the setback, Chen said, the action was a milestone,
making Taiwan's attempt to enter the U.N. as a full member under
the name of "Taiwan" in September equally significant.
</P>
<P>
Chen conferred the Order of Brilliant Star with Special Grand
Cordon on Sogavare in recognition of his contribution to efforts
to consolidate bilateral ties between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The two then signed a joint communique to further bolster
bilateral relations between Taiwan and the Solomon Islands.
</P>
<P>
Chen offered his appreciation again to Sogavare for having spoken
up for Taiwan during the U.N. General Assembly last September,
written a letter to WHO Director-General Margaret Chan in April
this year supporting Taiwan's membership in the world health
regulatory body, and voted for Taiwan during the World Health
Assembly annual conference that opened in Geneva May 14.
</P>
<P>
The president also asked Sogavare to support Taiwan in its new
bid to enter the U.N.
</P>
<P>
For his part, Sogavare reiterated Solomon Islands' firm stance on
supporting Taiwan's moves to integrate into the international
community, saying that as a sovereign state, Taiwan should not be
boycotted by the world unjustly.
</P>
<P>
Sogavare  said he believes  that so long as Taiwan tries
relentlessly and does not give up, the country will be accepted
by the international community someday.
</P>
<P>
He also vowed to ensure that ties between the two countries will
be further strengthened in years to come.
</P>
<P>
The Republic of China has been shut out of the United Nations
since 1971, when U.N. Resolution No. 2758 gave the China seat to
Beijing at Taiwan's expense. While Resolution No. 2758 resolved
the issue regarding China's U.N. representation, it did not
address the representation of Taiwan's people.
</P>
<P>
Last September marked Taiwan's 14th setback in its bid to enter
the U.N., using "the ROC on Taiwan" as its formal name.
