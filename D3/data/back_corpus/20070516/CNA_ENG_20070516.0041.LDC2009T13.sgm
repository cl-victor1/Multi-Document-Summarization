With a clear and firm objective and the help of its international
allies, Taiwan's failed bid for full membership of the World
Health Organization (WHO) received a thorough and fruitful three-
hour discussion at the annual World Health Assembly (WHA)
meeting, government officials said Wednesday upon return to
Taiwan from Geneva.
</P>
<P>
"We had a very clear strategy this year and that allowed us to
focus on the points of order. We were able to focus more on the
meeting instead of promotion outside the assembly hall, " said
Deputy Foreign Minister Yang Tzu-pao.
</P>
<P>
As the representative of Belize, one of Taiwan's 25 diplomatic
allies, submitted  a proposal for voting on whether Taiwan's
membership bid should be listed on the agenda, the issue received
thorough discussion of three hours, which was just what Taiwan
had hoped for, according to Yang.

<P>
The representative from Nauru, another of Taiwan's diplomatic
allies, also spoke up for Taiwan when several representatives
complained about the lengthy discussion, saying that "time is
precious for everyone, but the lives of the 23 million Taiwanese
people are even more important," Yang said.
</P>
<P>
"This year we focused on doing the right thing -- bidding for the
membership under the name of 'Taiwan' -- and forgot about China
temporarily, " said Deputy Health Minister Chen Tzay-jinn.
</P>
<P>
Chen added that Taiwan opposes any illegal procedure in the
handling of Taiwan's WHO bid issue within the WHA and WHO.
</P>
<P>
"Taiwan has received overwhelming support in its bid for a WHO
membership from international media such as the Economist,
Reuters, the Washington Post and Japan's Sankei Shimbun. A total
of 956 articles to date from various news outlets all over the
world have supported Taiwan's bid, compared to 715 from last
year, " said Government Information Office acting Minister
William Yih.
</P>
<P>
"Taiwan lost its bid once again, but the biggest losers this year
are China and Margaret Chan, the WHO director-general, because
they did not dare to speak up for their improper handling of the
case, " according to Chang Fu-mei, chairwoman of the Overseas
Compatriot Affairs Commission (OCAC).
</P>
<P>
As for a memorandum of understanding (MOU) China signed with the
WHO Secretariat in 2005, Yang said the signing of MOUs is allowed
under WHO regulations. However, a MOU should not involve a third
party and infringe upon anyone's interests and rights, he added.
