ACADEMIA SLAMS WHO, PONDERS TAIWAN'S NEXT MOVE

Taipei,   May  15  (CNA) 05/16/07  12:06:42 (By Chris Wang)

Scholars  accused the World Health Organization (WHO) of being
blinded by politics, reviewed Taiwan's bidding strategy to enter
the WHO as a full member and entertained the thought of giving
Taiwan an image of a "bad boy" in a forum Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Lamenting Taiwan's setback in its WHO membership bid, scholars
who attended the forum organized by Taiwan Thinktank to review
Taiwan's failed membership bid strategy said the WHO has become a
political  organization  instead of an organization  "providing
leadership on global health matters."
</P>
<P>
"The WHO yielded to China's political pressure in ignoring
Taiwan's bid once again and put global health in jeopardy by
leaving Taiwan out of the global health system, " said Lo Chi-
cheng, a professor at Soochow University.
</P>
<P>
"Taiwan is not poor enough, not sick enough and not bad enough.
And Taiwan has no courage to violate the WHO regulations, " said
Chiu Ya-wen, a researcher at the National Health Research
Institute, who half-jokingly described Taiwan's current situation
as "Three Nots and one No."
</P>
<P>
"As the old saying goes, 'noisy children get the candy.' Maybe we
should be like North Korea, creating trouble and being a bad boy
so the international community will raise its eyebrows, " said
political commentator Paul Lin, tongue in cheek.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan should ask for its international allies to try to
invalidate a memorandum of understanding (MOU) that was signed by
the WHO Secretariat and China in 2005, under which Taiwan's
medical experts have to file applications five weeks in advance
for attending WHO technical meetings and have them approved by
China's health department, and Taiwan medical personnel must
attend WHO activities in private capacities and should be
identified as "coming from Taiwan, China, " said David Huang, an
associate research fellow at Academia Sinica's Institute of
European and American Studies (IEAS).
</P>
<P>
Taiwan should also ask its allies to condemn the WHO secretariat
for not complying with the rules of procedure by rejecting
Taiwan's membership bid, Huang said.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan should also ask for an explanation from the WHO on the MOU
and the improper handling of Taiwan's bid by the Secretariat, Lo
Chi-cheng added.
</P>
<P>
In the future, Taiwan should develop a new scheme on how to
accommodate three proposals -- the bid for WHA observer status,
the bid for full WHO membership, and "meaningful participation"
in WHO activities -- on the table, said Lin Cheng-yi, a research
fellow at Academia Sinica's IEAS.
</P>
<P>
"The strategy for Taiwan's United Nations bid in September should
also be included in the consideration, " Lin said.
