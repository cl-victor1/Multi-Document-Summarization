The China Medical University hospital is inviting more stroke
victims to take advantage of its rehabilitation therapy program,
which uses acupuncture and scientifically made Chinese medicine,
a hospital official said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Li Yu-chen, director of the hospital's acupuncture department,
said that under the program that began April 1 last year and will
last until Dec. 31 this year, a patient can have three
acupuncture treatments a week and take the specially prepared
Chinese medicine.
</P>
<P>
He said his department has been treating about 60 stroke victims
with acupuncture each day, and that as a result, many of them
have regained language fluency and the ability to hold
chopsticks, while others have become emotionally more stable,
less dizzy and less prone to headaches, or have seen improvements
in limb strength.

<P>
Stroke is brought on by bleeding in the brain or by lack of blood
flow to the brain, known as ischemia. It can cause death or
permanent disability, such as paralysis on one or both sides of
the body.
</P>
<P>
Li said the hospital plans to establish a cerebral palsy center
by the end of this year to integrate  Western medicine with
acupuncture and Chinese medicine for treating stroke victims.
