Taiwan's  expertise  in  the telecommunications  industry  and
its  experience in  digital infrastructure development can help
the European Union "to bridge the broadband gap, " a Taiwan
official invited to attend an EU conference on the broadband gap
said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Wang Ting-an, executive secretary of the National Information and
Communications Initiative  Committee,  said Taiwan's successful
experience in bridging the digital gap between cities and rural
areas can be offered to the EU for reference in its efforts to
bridge the broadband gap between Europe's big cities and remote,
underdeveloped and rural regions and areas.
</P>
<P>
Wang, who was invited to deliver a speech on Taiwan's experience
in bridging the digital gap on the first day of the conference,
dubbed Bridging the Broadband Gap 2007 Monday, said that private
Taiwan companies, which have taken part in broadband
infrastructure development and efforts to bridge the digital gaps
in Taiwan, can also be of great help to the EU by lending their
experiences or selling their know-how and systems to EU
countries.

Broadband is the backbone of the knowledge society, providing
access to advanced public services and richer multimedia content
for entertainment,  training  and work,  he said.  With broadband
connections, new forms of business innovation can transform the
lives of individuals, increase social cohesion and contribute to
economic growth, according to officials from the European
Commission, the top decision-making EU body, which is sponsoring
the conference being held May 14-15.
</P>
<P>
Joining the commissioners are around 600 delegates, including
expert speakers who have explored which strategies can be used to
boost regional and local development and infrastructure, overcome
geographical obstacles, and make these European areas more
attractive to businesses and individuals alike.
</P>
<P>
The EU is determined to bridge the broadband gap, mobilizing all
relevant policy instruments, programs and stakeholders, according
to EU officials.
</P>
<P>
Participants  in  the  conference  agreed  that  broadband
infrastructure will not only benefit EU economies, it will also
help improve the quality of life for people in less-developed
regions and rural and remote areas who have suffered from a lack
of connectivity and other socio-economic problems.
</P>
<P>
The conference has also identified the exchange of best practices
and the strengthening of synergy among relevant EU policies as
the main avenues for action for the delivery of broadband to
rural, remote and less developed regions in the European Union.
</P>
<P>
On these points, Wang said that strengthening synergy among EU
countries for action for broadband system delivery is extremely
important, pointing out that Taiwan has rich experience in this
regard and can lend its know-how to EU countries.
