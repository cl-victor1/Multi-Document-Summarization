The ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)  will  back  the
Executive  Yuan in  pushing  the opposition-controlled
legislature to reconsider two controversial bills that cleared
legislative floor last Friday, a DPP official said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
According  to  DPP  Chairman  Yu  Shyi-kun,  the  party's
decision-making Central Standing Committee passed a resolution at
its weekly meeting earlier in the day throwing support behind the
Executive Yuan's plan to ask the legislature to reconsider
packages of amendments  to the Farmers  Association  Law and
Fishermen Association Law which critics said would pave the way
for "return of black gold politics."
</P>
<P>
The amendments initiated by the opposition "pan-blue alliance" of
the Kuomintang (KMT) and the People First Party (PFP) canceled
the three-term caps for secretaries-general with farmers and
fishermen associations and lowered requirements for them to renew
their employment.
</P>
<P>
The revised laws also stipulate that association staff standing
trial would not be relieved of their jobs until a final verdict
is delivered in their cases.
</P>
<P>
Under the existing laws, indicted staff members from farmers and
fishermen associations would be fired from their posts following
conviction in their second trials for criminal activities.
</P>
<P>
Yu said the revisions are an attempt by the "pan-blue" alliance
to cement  ties with  the grassroots  farmers  and fishermen
associations.
</P>
<P>
With  the  amendments,  Yu  said,  95 percent  of current
secretaries-general whose loyalty traditionally lie with the KMT,
will be able to dominate the organizations indefinitely despite
the fact that many of them have criminal records.
</P>
<P>
According to Yu, more than 20 executives or staff members of
farmers and fishermen associations across the country were
convicted of crimes, inclduing corruption, vote-buying, bribery,
violence and even drug trafficking at their first trials as of
this month.
</P>
<P>
Against this backdrop, Yu said the DPP's legislative caucus must
do its utmost to assist the Execuitve Yuan in pushing the
legislature to reconsider the controversial amendment bills
before they are referred to the president by the legislature for
promulgation.
</P>
<P>
Yu said the party's Central Standing committee has authorize DPP
Secretary- General Lin Chia-lung to organize a special task force
to pool wisdom and resources to ensure the overturn of these two
controversial bills.
