Customs officials have seized 50 metric tons of smuggled
mushrooms with a street value of NT$30 million (US$898,200) from
two containers at Taichung harbor, the Taichung Customs Office
revealed Wednesday.

A spokesman for the office said customs officials inspected two
40-foot containers offloaded from the Huahang 1, a Chinese
container ship, after being tipped off about possible smuggling.

The officials found the mushrooms concealed in 60 rolls of
corrugated paper, each weighing nearly 700 kilograms.

The goods belonged to a newly established trading company in
Kaohsiung, the spokesman said, adding that in addition to having
the smuggled mushrooms confiscated, the owner of the company will
be subjected to a heavy fine and prosecuted under anti-smuggling
laws.
