PEDIGREE CERTIFICATES NO GUARANTEE OF PURE BREEDING: STUDY
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  May 16 (CNA) 05/16/07  20:09:55 (By Han Nai-kuo)

An animal rights group warned dog lovers Wednesday that so-called
"pedigree certificates" issued by dog breeders associations in
Taiwan provide no guarantee that the dogs identified in the
papers are healthy and purebred.
</P>
<P>
Chen Yu-min, director of the Environment and Animal Society of
Taiwan (EAST), told a press conference at the Legislative Yuan
that results of a month-long study conducted by her organization
show that papers claimed to be "pedigree certificates" can be
bought for as little as NT$100 from dog breeders associations
throughout Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
She said EAST workers made telephone inquiries with national and
local dog breeders associations throughout Taiwan, including
Taiwan Kennel Association, Chunghua Kennel Club, and Hsinchu Dog
Breeders Association, about how they could obtain a pedigree
certificate for a dog.
</P>
<P>
According to Chen, almost all the EAST workers were told that
there was no need so see the dog and that they could get a
pedigree certificate by simply paying a fee.
</P>
<P>
Some associations even offered extra service by helping a dog
owner "trace the dog's lineage" in order to hike the price of the
dog, Chen pointed out.
</P>
<P>
She said such behavior is not only forgery and fraud but could
lead to inbreeding, producing dogs with hereditary diseases and
poor health.
</P>
<P>
Chen urged the Council of Agriculture under the Cabinet to push
for a revision of the Animal Protection Act and to set up a
system to regulate the registration of stud dogs.
