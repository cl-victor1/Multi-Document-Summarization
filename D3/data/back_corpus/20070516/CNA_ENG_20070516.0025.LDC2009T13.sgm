Part of the lineup of the new Cabinet to be led by Premier-
designate Chang Chun- hsiung has been set as of Wednesday, after
outgoing Premier Su Tseng-chang led the current Cabinet to resign
en masse earlier the same day, according to political sources.
</P>
<P>
The sources said Minister-without-Portfolio Lin Hsi-yao, who
served as acting Taipei magistrate between 2004-2005, will be
named as the new Executive Yuan secretary-general, replacing Liu
Yu-shan, who will be transferred to serve as a minister-without-
portfolio.
</P>
<P>
Lin, 46, is a technocrat whose first job in public office was as
director of the Environmental Protection Bureau of the Yilan
County government from 1991-1992.
</P>
<P>
Chang, 69, chairman of the Straits Exchange Foundation, who was
appointed by President Chen Shui-bian Monday to succeed Su, has
been in close contact with Chen's chief of staff Chiou I-jen, who
has been tapped to serve as vice premier, in recent days to
exchange views on the shaping of the new Cabinet, the sources
said.
</P>
<P>
Su stunned the nation with his resignation Saturday, less than a
week after he lost the DPP primary for the 2008 presidential
election to his predecessor, Frank Hsieh.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, according to the sources, Shieh Jhy-wey, Taiwan's
representative to Germany, is set to serve as the new minister of
the Government Information Office, succeeding Cheng Wen-tsang,
who resigned earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
Shieh, 52, a renowned German language and literature professor,
had also been an eloquent social activist before being assigned
by the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) administration as
Taiwan's top liaison officer in Germany.
</P>
<P>
DPP Legislator Lu Tien-lin is tapped to head the Council of Labor
Affairs, replacing Lee Ying-yuan, who resigned from the post May
1.
</P>
<P>
Lu, 48, was a commissioner of the Council of Labor Affairs before
being elected a DPP legislator-at-large in late 2004.
</P>
<P>
Wong Chin-chu, a former Changhua County magistrate, is tipped to
serve as chairwoman of the Council for Cultural Affairs,
replacing Chiu Kun-liang.
</P>
<P>
Wong, 60, had served as a DPP legislator for three terms before
being elected magistrate of the central county of Changhua in
2001.
</P>
<P>
Ho Mei-yueh, chairwoman of the Council for Economic Planning and
Development and Ministers-without-Portfolio Hsu Chih-hsiung and
Lin Feng-ching are expected to be retained, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
Chang and his new Cabinet are scheduled to take office May 21.
