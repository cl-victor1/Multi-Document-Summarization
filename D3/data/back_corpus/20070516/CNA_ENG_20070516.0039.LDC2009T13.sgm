TAIPEI MAYOR VOWS PUNISHMENT FOR CKS HALL OFFENDERS

Taipei,  May  16  (CNA) 05/16/07  20:27:58 (By Flor Wang)

Taipei Mayor Hau Long-bin reiterated Wednesday that anyone caught
damaging the Chiang Kai-shek (CKS) Memorial Hall in downtown
Taipei will be punished in accordance with the law.
</P>
<P>
Hau made the comments while answering questions from reporters
after posing for a photo session with Premier Su Tseng-chang and
other Cabinet members who tendered their resignations en masse
that day.
</P>
<P>
Stressing that any individual who damages the hall or its
compound will definitely be subject to punishment because the
building has been proclaimed a "historic relic" by the Taipei
city government, Hau said that he does not believe "the Ministry
of Education will do anything against the law."
</P>
<P>
The Executive Yuan promulgated an administrative decree to rename
the CKS Memorial Hall as "Taiwan Democracy Hall" early this month
and the Ministry of Education is slated to announce the opening
of the hall by putting a plaque on its main gate Saturday -- a
move that is expected to set off confrontation between the
municipal and central authorities.
</P>
<P>
The name change of the CKS Memorial Hall came after the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) and President Chen Shui-bian
rekindled a name changing campaign in January to purge the
country of the late President Chiang Kai-shek's legacy and the
words "China" or "Chinese."
</P>
<P>
As a result, the names of several state-run companies, such as
the nation's postal service and petroleum providers, have been
changed in recent months.
