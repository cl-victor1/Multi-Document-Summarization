KMT, PFP CONSIDERING MOTION IN LEGISLATURE TO TOPPLE NEXT CABINET
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

Taipei, May 16 (CNA) 05/16/07  22:57:44 (By Han Nai-kuo)
</P>
<P>
The main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) and its "pan-blue alliance"
partner, the People First Party, are considering introducing a
motion in the Legislative Yuan to topple the next Cabinet.
</P>
<P>
Lin Feng-cheng, a vice chairman of the KMT, proposed at a meeting
of the KMT Central Standing Committee Wednesday that such a
motion should be considered after premier-designate  Chang Chun-
hsiung assumes his new post.
</P>
<P>
Chang was appointed by President Chen Shui-bian last week to fill
the vacancy left by outgoing Premier Su Tseng-chang, who resigned
after his defeat in the ruling Democratic Party's primary
election for the 2008 Presidential election.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the KMT's weekly meeting, KMT Chairman Wu Poh-hsiung
pointed out that Chang painted a "negative image" of himself when
he served as premier from October 2000 to February 2002 because
of his decision to halt the construction of the fourth nuclear
power plant, a move that seriously impacted Taiwan's economy.
</P>
<P>
Wu said the KMT will try to refresh the people's memory of
Chang's performance and force him to "show some sincerity."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the PFP's legislative caucus leaders bluntly described
Chang as "unfit for the job," saying that his decision to stop
the construction of the fourth nuclear power plant caused severe
damage to Taiwan's business reputation in the international
community.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the Legislative Yuan declared Chang "persona non
grata" at that time, the PFP caucus whips vowed that they will
work with the KMT legislative caucus to introduce the motion to
topple Chang and his Cabinet.
