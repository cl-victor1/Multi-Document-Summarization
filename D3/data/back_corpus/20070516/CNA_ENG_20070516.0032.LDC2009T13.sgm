Carrefour, the largest hypermarket chain in Taiwan, expressed
Wednesday that it can only ensure that the prices of instant
noodles and edible oil products sold in its stores around the
island will not be raised before the end of May.
</P>
<P>
The retail group made the declaration after news reports claiming
that prices of the two kinds of food products were surging in
local hypermarkets, with edible oil prices to move up by 20
percent to 30 percent overall by the end of the month.
</P>
<P>
Carrefour executives said that so far, only the price of one
cooking oil brand in their stores has been hiked. As for instant
noodles, they noted that only the prices of two popular flavors
made by the Uni-President Enterprises Corp., one of the leading
foodstuff manufacturers in Taiwan, have been raised this year.

<P>
Meanwhile, RT-Mart International, the second largest hypermarket
operator in Taiwan, said that none of its cooking oil prices in
its stores have been hiked since last year despite the fact that
the company has been facing great pressure due to price hikes by
its suppliers.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the Uni-President's move of hiking its instant noodle
prices, RT-Mart executives said that none of the products for
which prices have been hiked are being sold in their stores any
longer as the supplier refused to answer their demand that prices
not be raised.

<P>
The Chinese-language daily China Times quoted officials of the
Commerce Department of the Ministry of Economic Affairs Wednesday
as saying that many commodity prices were raised "quietly" in
May.
</P>
<P>
A price investigation launched by the department in May revealed
that the prices of many products like instant noodles, noodles,
cooking oils, soft drinks, detergents and canned foods were
higher than they were in April, according to the daily's report.
</P>
<P>
The officials said that at some hypermarkets, some products are
even sold in smaller packages but at the same prices as in the
past, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
The Cabinet-level Fair Trade Commission has launched an inquiry
into the reported price hikes in an effort to crack down on
possible market order offenses.
