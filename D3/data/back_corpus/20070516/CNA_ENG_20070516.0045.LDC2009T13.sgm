DPP SETS UP TASK FORCE TO DRAFT `NORMAL COUNTRY' RESOLUTION
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taipei,  May 16 (CNA) 05/16/07  21:41:13 (By Flor Wang)
</P>
<P>
The ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) approved Wednesday
the creation of a task force to take charge of drafting a
resolution on making Taiwan a "normal" country.
</P>
<P>
The DPP made the decision during the weekly meeting of its
powerful Central Standing Committee (CSC).
</P>
<P>
Although President Chen Shui-bian has expressed support for
drafting such a resolution and has made it clear that the DPP's
resolution on Taiwan's future is still of great significance to
the party, DPP Chairman Yu Shyi-kun said that "the new and better
resolution can replace the old one due to changing times."
</P>
<P>
However, Yu also agreed to discuss relevant issues after the new
"normal country resolution" has been hammered out, as the
resolution on Taiwan's future is still valid and because the new
resolution can absorb some key points of the old one.
</P>
<P>
The new resolution must be adopted by the party on a consensus
vote through a democratic and open process in an effort to fully
reflect the DPP's basic values and achieve its goal of winning
December's legislative elections and the 2008 presidential poll
so as to cement the party's power base, Yu said.
</P>
<P>
Pointing to the country's most recent setback in applying to
enter the World Health Organization (WHO) under the name of
"Taiwan" as an example, Yu said the defeat underscores the
importance of making Taiwan a "normal" country.
</P>
<P>
In addition to writing a new constitution, Yu said, the planned
resolution will also call for Taiwan's participation in the
United Nations and touch on issues on a broad front ranging from
economics to social justice.
</P>
<P>
Yu first proposed drafting a resolution on making Taiwan a
"normal" country during a campaign prior to the DPP's May 6
presidential primary, in which he finished a distant third in a
vote by party members.
</P>
<P>
The task force lineup includes members from the DPP CSC, the
Presidential Office and the Executive Yuan, such as CSC member
and former Vice Premier Yeh Chu-lan, DPP Secretary-General Lin
Chia-lung, Academia Sinica researcher Hsu Yung-ming and political
critic Lin Jyan-lung.
