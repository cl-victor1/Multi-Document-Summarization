LEGISLATIVE YUAN SPEAKER CALLS FOR KMT REFORM
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taipei,  Jan. 18 (CNA) 01/18/07  19:48:11 (By Flor Wang)

Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng was reluctant Thursday to
comment on the main opposition Kuomintang's (KMT's) decision to
put off the date of its presidential primary, but urged the party
to engage in reform if it hopes to regain power.
</P>
<P>
Wang, a KMT stalwart, was unwilling to comment on the party's
decision to postpone the date of its primary from the originally
slated April 15 to May 25 in response to KMT lawmakers' and some
Central Standing Committee (CSC) members' discontent that the
decision was too rash and the date too early.
</P>
<P>
The KMT must fully engage in reform if it hopes to win back power
in 2008, Wang said, suggesting that the CSC thoroughly study
electoral affairs, as the party has yet to further cement its
development base and transform itself in depth to win back public
support.
</P>
<P>
KMT Chairman Ma Ying-jeou gave the final say on the primary issue
a day earlier in the party's weekly CSC meeting, agreeing to put
off the event to May 25 -- a development which means that the KMT
will not produce its candidate for the 2008 presidential election
until a May 30 CSC meeting.
</P>
<P>
KMT lawmaker Hou Tsai-feng, who is also a CSC member, said that
the original date of April 15 is too early to hold primaries to
select its candidates for both legislators and president.
</P>
<P>
Hou hailed the change of date, claiming that the public will have
a better feeling toward the KMT if it decides to conduct the
primaries  to select  its legislative  before the presidential
candidate.
