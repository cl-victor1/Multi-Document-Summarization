<P>
The first red yeast rice museum in the world will be completed in
Yilan County in March or April, Yilan Distillery Director Wang
Wu-hsien said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Wang has been promoting the county as the "homeland" of red yeast
rice, a kind of fermented rice often used in making Chinese
wines. Wang said the distillery will also host a red yeast rice
cultural festival after the completion of the museum.
</P>
<P>
Very few people know that Yilan was the place in Taiwan where red
yeast rice was first brought in from China, but its history
started to become better known after the county's popular red
cordial was selected as the county's "official liquor."
</P>
<P>
Wang said he hopes to stimulate Yilan's economy and boost tourism
by using  the experience  he gained  in pushing  a brewery's
transformation, developing by- products and opening to
sightseeing during an earlier stint as director of the Puli
Brewery in central Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Wang designated red yeast rice as the core characteristic of the
Yilan Distillery, transforming the inexpensive red cordial to the
higher-end "old red rice wine." He also made red yeast rice a
synonym for Yilan County through the selection of red cordial as
the county's official liquor.
</P>
<P>
He added that local restaurants will be encouraged to make
special dishes using the old red rice wine to attract tourists.
