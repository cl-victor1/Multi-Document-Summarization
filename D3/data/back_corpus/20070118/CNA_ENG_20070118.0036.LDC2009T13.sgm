Chief Prosecutor of the Kaohsiung Branch of the Taiwan High
Prosecutors Office, Chen Tsung-ming, who was given the green
light by the Legislature Thursday to be the next State Public
Prosecutor-General, says that he looks forward eagerly to seeing
a special investigation task force formed in the near future.

<P>
Chen, nominated recently by President Chen Shui-bian for the top
prosecutorial post and confirmed by the votes of 126 lawmakers,
said he will be prudent in selecting proper candidates to join
the special investigation task force soon to be established under
the Supreme Court's State Public Prosecutor General's Office.
That task force will have the authority to deal with crimes
committed by top government officials or their relatives.
</P>
<P>
In Thursday's legislative voting, a total of 126 lawmakers voted
for the appointment of Chen, while two voted against the
nomination, with 87 votes being invalid.

Chen went to visit Minister of Justice Shih Mao-lin hours after
he won the legislature's endorsement. During the meeting, Shih
offered his congratulations to Chen and expressed hopes that Chen
will usher in a new era in Taiwan's prosecutorial history and
enhance the people's trust in the country's prosecution system.

<P>
The president used to have full authority to appoint a state
public prosecutor- general, however, under the newly revised
Court Organic  Law,  the  president's nomination  now requires
the legislature's approval. According to the law, an appointment
must be approved by half of the legislators present at a session,
with at least one-third of lawmakers in the legislature in
attendance for the vote.
</P>
<P>
Under the new law, the State Public Prosecutor-General serves
only a single four-year term. The new measures are designed to
enhance  the  democratic legitimacy  and independence  of the
prosecutorial system.
