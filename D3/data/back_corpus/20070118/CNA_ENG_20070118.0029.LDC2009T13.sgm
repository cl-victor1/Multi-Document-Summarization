Taipei,  Jan.  18 (CNA) 01/18/07  18:41:10 (By Deborah Kuo)

Taiwan's labor force participation rate stood at an average of
57.90 percent in the first 11 months of 2006, a nearly seven-year
high since 2000, Cabinet-level Council for Economic Planning and
Development (CEPD) officials said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The rate was the highest since 2000, when the figure stood at
57.68 percent before gradually declining in the interceding
years, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
This indicates that the country's unemployment problem has been
alleviated and that Taiwan citizens' willingness to work has
picked up, they claimed.
</P>
<P>
CEPD officials also found that the unemployment rate declined to
an average of 3.91 percent in the January-November period of
2006, a significant fall since 2002, when the figure stood at
5.17 percent.
</P>
<P>
On the average number of weeks without work, the figure was 24.3
weeks during the 11-month period, down from the average of 30.2
weeks posted in the same period of 2002, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
The officials also said that output from the service sector
constituted 73.3 percent of Taiwan's gross domestic product (GDP)
in 2005, a level almost on a par with those posted in
industrially advanced countries.
</P>
<P>
However, they pointed out, the service sector provided only 58.3
percent of the country's employment opportunities in 2005,
indicating that there is still ample room for the service
industry as a whole to improve its contribution to Taiwan's
employment.
