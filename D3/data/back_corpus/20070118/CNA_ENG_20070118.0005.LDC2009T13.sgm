Austria can serve as Taiwan's bridgehead to the European Union
market, Austria's Economics and Labor Vice Minister Josef Mayer
said at the fourth Taiwan-Austria Economic Cooperation Conference
and the Austrian High Tech Forum held Tuesday in Taipei.
</P>
<P>
Also present at the forum included an 11-member delegation led by
the Austrian Federal Economic Chamber's Foreign Trade Department
Director-General Walter Koren, Vice Economic Affairs Minister Hou
Ho-shong, and Tong Lung Metal Industry Co. Chairman Wang Chung-
yu.
</P>
<P>
Mayer said at the forum that the Austrian government supports
bilateral economic and trade cooperation with Taiwan and that
Austria can serve not only as one of Taiwan's trade partners but
also as Taiwan's bridgehead to the E.U. market.
</P>
<P>
Koren, for his part, said Taiwan's high tech industry is world
famous and that Austria imports many Taiwan-made products.
</P>
<P>
However, it is rarely known that these quality products are often
made using Austrian expertise and machinery, he went on, giving
examples of computer screens, cell phone components, a tunnel
construction project on the east coast of Taiwan, as well as
communications  facilities that Taiwan airports use to control
aircraft takeoffs and landings.
</P>
<P>
Koren pointed out that in the past, Austria collaborated with
Taiwan in the area of machinery and plastic components. Austria
is Taiwan's largest buyer of communications equipment in Europe.
</P>
<P>
Ho said both governments are discussing the signing of a
bilateral investment agreement in an effort to lower business
costs and facilitate investment.
</P>
<P>
He described Austria as an ideal location for Taiwan businesses
to invest in the E.U. market as it has a well-developed high tech
industry and sound infrastructure, while Taiwan also can serve as
Austria's regional operation center in the Far East and a
springboard into China and Southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the trade exchanges between Taiwan and Austria have
been on the rise in recent years, Wang cited customs statistics
showing that the total trade amount last year posted a 31.9
percent increase to reach US$770 billion.
</P>
<P>
Compared with the previous year, Taiwan's exports to Austria
jumped 12.9 percent to US$314 million in 2006, Wang said, while
Taiwan's imports from Austria rose 48.9 percent to US$463
million.
</P>
<P>
He said Austrian investors are attracted by Taiwan's high quality
manpower, geographic location and trade network, while Austria
enjoys competitiveness in transportation management, the
machinery industry and the service industry.
