Taipei,  March 24 (CNA) 03/24/07  18:55:29 (By Elizabeth Hsu)

A controversial television show host and his fiancee both
admitted Saturday to having smoked marijuana in the past after
investigators found marijuana and a pipe while searching his
residence in downtown Taipei for evidence related to a bribery
probe.
</P>
<P>
The Taipei District Prosecutors' Office launched the search
Friday evening in an effort to find out whether Hu Gua, a stage
name for Hu Tzih-hsiung, had as an anonymous tip claimed bribed a
district judge for his acquittance in a gambling fraud case.
</P>
<P>
During the search, investigators from the Investigation Bureau
found a bottle containing around 30 grams of marijuana.
</P>
<P>
Forensic tests on urine and hair samples from Hu and his fiancee,
Ting Ro-an, are now underway.
</P>
<P>
Hu and Ting were both released on bail of NT$100,000 (US$3,026)
each after overnight questioning over their alleged bribery.
</P>
<P>
The entertainer was acquitted in January by Taipei District Judge
Wu Meng-liang on charges that he had associated with his brother
Hu Chih-heng in a scheme aimed at cheating fellow gamblers during
high-stakes mahjong games at his residence.
</P>
<P>
Hu Chih-heng was found guilty of fraud and illegal gambling and
sentenced to 28 months in prison.
</P>
<P>
Hu Gua's acquittance drew protests from the plaintiff, Cho Chin-
tai, who claimed she was cheated out of more than NT$10 million
by the celebrity while gambling on mahjong. Cho then appealed to
the Taiwan High Court for "justice."
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, local Chinese-language newspapers reported on their
front pages that Wu was accused by an anonymous individual of
having accepted a bribe of NT$10 million for Hu Gua's
acquittance. The Judicial Yuan has kicked off an investigation
into the allegation.
</P>
<P>
Friday's search also covered the residences of Lee Chin-liang,
boyfriend of Hu Gua's daughter, as well as Lee's friend, Liang
Chia-yao, who is alleged to have made the arrangements for paying
off the judge.
