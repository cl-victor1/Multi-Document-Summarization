The Japanese encephalitis virus will strike Taiwan within two or
three weeks -- about one month earlier than in previous years --
the Centers for Disease Control under the Department of Health
warned Friday.
</P>
<P>
Health officials said the season in which Japanese encephalitis
cases occurred used to begin in May each year.
</P>
<P>
They suspected that global warming is probably the cause of why
the disease is expected to strike Taiwan early this year.
</P>
<P>
The officials said monitoring stations in seven of Taiwan's
cities and counties, including the counties of Yilan, Taoyuan and
Pingtung, have reported an antibody positive rate of 50 percent
after conducting susceptibility tests on pigs.
</P>
<P>
A total of 25 suspected Japanese encephalitis cases have been
reported this year, but none have been confirmed, the officials
said, adding that last year the first confirmed case occurred in
May.
</P>
<P>
They pointed out that the Japanese encephalitis virus, spread by
mosquitos, can remain dormant for five to 15 years after entering
the human body.
</P>
<P>
While mild infection might not lead to any apparent symptoms
other than fever with headache, severe infection can cause high
fever, stupor, disorientation, coma, tremors, convulsions,
spastic paralysis and even death.
