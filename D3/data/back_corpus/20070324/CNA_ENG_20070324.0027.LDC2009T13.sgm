Taipei, March 24 (CNA) 03/24/07  21:52:46 (By Sofia Wu)
</P>
<P>
Chou Chun-hsun, fresh from winning a world go championship held
in South Korea a couple of days ago, returned to Taipei Saturday
to a heroic welcome.
</P>
<P>
Chou said upon his return to Taoyuan International Airport that
he hopes his victory can inspire more talented Taiwan go players
to pursue excellence and win more honors in the international go
community.
</P>
<P>
Chou, 27, emerged victorious from the final match of the 11th LG
Cup Go Championship in Seoul Thursday, becoming the first-ever go
player representing Taiwan to win the world championship.
</P>
<P>
The victory is just one of a series of firsts by Chou, who was
also the first Taiwan-nurtured go player to rise to the
professional game's top tier -- ninth dan or level nine.
</P>
<P>
Chou received a trophy and 250 million Korean won (NT$8.83
million) in prize money at an award-presentation ceremony held
Friday at the headquarters of the Chosun Ilbo daily, one of the
game's sponsor.
</P>
<P>
Asked how he will use his prize money, Chou said it is hoped that
he will have the opportunity to help nurture more outstanding
Taiwanese go players.
</P>
<P>
Unlike other talented Taiwanese go players who have moved abroad
to play tougher competition in Japan, Chou has stayed in Taiwan
and represented  his country  in major  international
competitions throughout his professional career.
</P>
<P>
Noting that Taiwan has a limited go population, Chou said he
hopes to galvanize more youngsters to dedicate to the strategic
sport by winning more international titles in the future.
</P>
<P>
Chou defeated  his Chinese  opponent  Hu Yaoyu  2-1 in a best-of-
three final to claim the LG Cup title and a place in Taiwan's go
history.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Education (MOE) will commend Chou in recognition
of his career achievements and persevering spirit.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Education Tu Cheng-sheng said earlier in the day that
Chou deserves public commendation not just for his professional
brilliance but also for his patience and mental fortitude shown
in his quest for career success.
</P>
<P>
In his elementary  school years,  Chou had to endure his
classmates' mockery because of a large scarlet birthmark that
covers half of his face. Chou has learned to find comfort in
playing go and to ignore comments about his "facial defect" while
cultivating a habitual concentration and precocious calm, which
have become his valuable personal assets in the highly
competitive game of go.
</P>
<P>
Chou's life story has been written into an elementary school
textbook.
