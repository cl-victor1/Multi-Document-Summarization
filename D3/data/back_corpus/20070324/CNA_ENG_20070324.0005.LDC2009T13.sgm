PROSECUTORS SUMMON KMT LAWMAKER TO PRISON APRIL 3
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  March 23 (CNA) 03/24/07  11:12:32 (By Sofia Wu)

<P>
The Kaohsiung (KMT) Prosecutor's Office served a subpoena on
opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Legislator Chiu Yi Friday demanding
that he begin serving a 14-month prison term April 3.
</P>
<P>
The prosecutor's office in the southern port city also prohibited
Chiu from leaving Taiwan before the April 3 deadline.
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors said that if Chiu has sufficient reason, he can apply
for a postponement of the starting day of his prison sentence. If
he fails to report to the prison that day without producing any
reason, law enforcement officers will seize him and throw him in
jail.
</P>
<P>
The prosecutor's office issued the subpoena a day after the
Supreme Court rejected Chiu's appeal seeking to overturn the
sentence leveled on him by a lower court for his role in a
violent protest at the Kaohsiung District Court shortly after the
presidential election in 2004.
</P>
<P>
Chiu led a group of his supporters in an attack on the main
entrance of the court in an attempt to force it to impound ballot
boxes after the KMT's candidate, Lien Chan, lost to President
Chen Shui-bian by a razor-thin margin in the March 20, 2004
presidential election.
</P>
<P>
The violent attack resulted in injuries to eight police officers.
Chiu was indicted on charges of obstructing officials in the
discharge of their duties and the district court sentenced him to
18 months in February 2006.
</P>
<P>
Chiu appealed to the Taiwan High Court, which reduced his
sentence to 14 months last August on the grounds that Chiu had
settled with the eight injured policemen out of court and
compensated each of them to the tune of NT$10,000.
</P>
<P>
Appealing the high court ruling, Chiu brought his case to the
Supreme Court last September. After several months of careful
scrutiny of the relevant documents, the Supreme Court rejected
his appeal.
</P>
<P>
A Supreme Court spokesman said Thursday that the court decided to
uphold the Taiwan High Court verdict because the case against
Chiu is iron-clad,  with sufficient evidence of his criminal
activity. Television footage and security monitoring videos
clearly show Chiu heading a group of people in the attack on the
district court's main entrance in Kaohsiung in the wee hours of
March 21, 2004.
