MAKING FRIENDS IS TAIWAN'S DIPLOMATIC PRINCIPLE: MOFA SPOKESMAN
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  March 24 (CNA) 03/24/07  14:53:10 (By Elizabeth Hsu)

Making as many friends as possible in the international
community  has been Taiwan's standing diplomatic principle,
Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) spokesman Wang Chien-yeh said
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Wang made the remarks in response to a media inquiry about an
earlier foreign wire report which said that the government of St.
Lucia irritated its diplomatic ally China Friday by engaging in
talks with a visiting Taiwan delegation headed by Minister of
Foreign Affairs James Huang.
</P>
<P>
The talks reportedly focused on how the two sides can enhance
their bilateral relations. The report also mentioned that China
has recently pledged more money and technical assistance to St.
Lucia amid speculation  that its rival Taiwan has been seeking
to re-establish diplomatic ties with the small island state in
the south Caribbean.
</P>
<P>
Asked whether the report implied China and Taiwan are in a
contest of "money wrestling" for St. Lucia's diplomatic alliance,
Wang said foreign media outlets often reduce Taiwan's foreign aid
to "dollar diplomacy."
</P>
<P>
"It is unfair to make such an abrupt criticism of Taiwan, " he
said, pointing out that many Western countries also offer similar
kinds of diplomatic aid.
</P>
<P>
St. Lucian Prime Minister John Compton is friendly toward Taiwan.
The veteran politician, leading the United Workers Party, had
governed the country for 29 years. The country maintained
diplomatic ties with Taiwan for 13 years until Compton's party
lost the 1996 general elections to the Labor Party, which then
established ties with China. Compton became prime minister again
after his party won the general elections last December.
</P>
<P>
Wang declined to comment on the details concerning planned
efforts to reinforce bilateral relations between Taiwan and St.
Lucia. But he added the foreign minister's visit of significance.
