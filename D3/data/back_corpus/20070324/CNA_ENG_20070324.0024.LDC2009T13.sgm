The 2007 Taipei International Cycle Show -- the largest of its
kind in Asia and the second largest in the world -- kicked off
Saturday, with an opening ceremony presided over by Economic
Affairs Minister Steve R.L. Chen at the Taipei World Trade
Center.

The cycle show's growing scale means that the promotional slogan
of  "Think Bicycle,  Think  Taiwan"  has  been  popularized
internationally, Chen said, adding that Taiwan's brand-name
bicycles now rank among the country's top 10 product brands in
terms of international renown.

He also noted that the Executive Yuan has decided to designate
the first Saturday of May each year as Taiwan Bicycle Day to
better promote cycling in Taiwan, adding that it also plans to
build a bicycle museum to exhibit the development of Taiwan's
bicycle industry.

<P>
On May 5, mayors and magistrates around the island will take part
in bike riding activities to mark the first ever Taiwan Bicycle
Day, Chen said.

Also speaking at the opening ceremony, Yang Yin-ming, director
general of the Taiwan Bicycle Exporters  Association, said the
average export price of a Taiwan-made bicycle rose 3.34 percent
year-on-year to US$206.61 in 2006, marking the highest level in
Taiwan's history. He added that Taiwan has become a research and
development center for producing high-end bicycles and
components.
