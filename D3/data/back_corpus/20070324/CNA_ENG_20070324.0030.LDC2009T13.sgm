TAIWAN TO RESPECT ST. LUCIA'S DECISION ON BILATERAL TIES: MOFA
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

Taipei,  March 24 (CNA) 03/24/07  23:29:46 (By Sofia Wu)

<P>
Taiwan will respect whatever decision St. Lucia will make on the
form of relations between the two countries, Ministry of Foreign
Affairs (MOFA) spokesman Wang Chien-yeh said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Wang made the remarks while confirming that a Taiwan delegation
headed by Minister of Foreign Affairs James Huang has arrived in
the southern Caribbean nation and held extensive talks with St.
Lucia senior officials, including Prime Minister John Compton.
</P>
<P>
According  to Wang,  both sides have expressed desires to
strengthen bilateral cooperation in various fields.
</P>
<P>
As to the extent of development of bilateral relations, Wang said
Taiwan will respect St. Lucia's determination. "We'll let nature
run its course," he added.
</P>
<P>
Foreign wire service reports said St. Lucia irritated China
Friday by welcoming a high-level delegation from Taiwan, headed
by Foreign Minister Huang.
</P>
<P>
According to the reports, St. Lucia's Foreign Ministry announced
Friday it has begun talks with a delegation headed by Taiwan's
foreign minister to discuss "cooperation and mutual interests, "
prompting a formal protest from the Chinese Embassy in Castries,
St. Lucia's capital.
</P>
<P>
The reports also quoted Huang as having told reporters that he
intended to discuss relations between Taiwan and St. Lucia with
Compton, describing the 82 -year-old as "our dear old friend."
</P>
<P>
"I'm here to exchange views with the prime minister and his
ministers on how we can enhance our bilateral relations and work
together for the mutual benefit of our two governments and
peoples," Huang said.
</P>
<P>
Compton, speaking from his official residence where he feted the
Taiwanese visitors, also said he wished to discuss areas of
"mutual cooperation," but did not disclose further details.
</P>
<P>
Compton, who previously governed St. Lucia for 29 years, leads
the United Workers Party, which maintained ties with Taiwan for
13 years until it was defeated by the Labor Party in 1996
elections. The Labor Party established ties with China shortly
after it gained power.
</P>
<P>
Compton staged a comeback last December. He said shortly after
the electoral victory that his government would maintain ties
with China and St. Lucia's External Affairs Minister Rufus
Bousquet has also reiterated  this intention  in a letter  to his
Chinese counterpart, Li Zhaoxing.
