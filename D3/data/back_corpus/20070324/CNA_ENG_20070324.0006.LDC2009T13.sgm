The Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) slammed Hong Kong authorities
Friday after they shut door to one of its staff member earlier in
the day, saying that the unfriendly move was a disservice to
bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong is scheduled to elect its third chief executive March
25. As it marks the first time that two rivals are vying for the
post, the election process has drawn wide attention and concern
in the free world community.
</P>
<P>
The MAC sent one of its advisers, Chang Chih-yu, to accompany a
group of Taiwan journalists to travel to Hong Kong to observe the
Hong Kong electoral process and get first-hand information about
the democratic development in the former British colony.
</P>
<P>
Even though Chang held a Hong Kong visa that remains valid until
May, he was denied entry at the Hong Kong international airport
and had to fly back to Taipei.
</P>
<P>
The MAC issued a press statement in the evening expressing its
deep regret over Hong Kong's snub. "The incident reflects Hong
Kong's excessively  conservative attitude toward its engagements
with Taiwan, " the statement said, adding that the Hong Kong
government should review its stance toward Taiwan and refrain
from adopting any more move that is detrimental to bilateral
relationship.
