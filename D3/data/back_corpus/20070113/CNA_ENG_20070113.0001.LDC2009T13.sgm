POLICE CHIEF WANTS QUICK REPATRIATION OF BANK HEIST SUSPECT

Kinmen,  Jan. 12 (CNA) 01/13/07  02:15:29 (By Sofia Wu)

Police have contacted Chinese authorities for repatriation of a
key suspect in a bank heist in Taiwan earlier this month who have
been apprehended by Chinese police after escaping to Yunnan
Province, a senior police officer said Friday.
</P>
<P>
National Police Agency (NPA) Director-General Hou Yu-ih made the
remarks during an inspection tour of the outlying island of
Kinmen, which lies closer to China's southeastern Fujian Province
than to Taiwan.

<P>
According to Hou, NPA officials have come into contact with their
Chinese counterparts after learning that Lee Han-yang, the driver
of an armored cash van for Group 4 Securicor, a private security
company in Taipei, has been nabbed in Kunming, Yunnan Province
after he drugged his colleague and made away with NT$56 million
(US$1.7 million) Jan. 2 in Taipei.
</P>
<P>
Lee, 45, fled to Hong Kong immediately after the heist and
reportedly sneaked to Kunming Jan. 6 to join his younger brother,
identified as Lee Chin-tsan, who reportedly once did business in
Kunming. According to media reports Lee Chin- tsan has also been
detained by Chinese public security authorities.

Noting that the two sides of the Taiwan Strait has had a
mechanism in place for repartiation of criminal suspects or
convicted fugitives, Hou said he hopes the Lee brothers can be
repatriated as soon as possible in terms of the principles and
spirit of the Kinmen Agreement signed by the Red Cross societies
on both sides in 1991.
</P>
<P>
In the past, China conventionally repatriated seized Taiwanese
fugitives via the "mini three links" direct shipping services
between another Taiwan-held outlying island of Matsu and Mawei in
Fujian Province.
</P>
<P>
Asked whether the Lee brothers would be repatriated via Matsu or
via a flight from Kunmin to Hong Kong or Macau before they are
taken back to Taipei, Hou said the exact repatriation mode has
yet to be decided. Kuming is more adjacent to Hong Kong and Macau
than to Mawei. "Anyway, we hope the repatriation can take place
the sooner the better," he added.

It was Hou's first visit to Kinmen since he was promoted to the
top police post last year. After Kinmen County Magistrate Lee
Chu-feng briefed him on Kinmen's crime situation, Hou said he is
pleased to learn that the frontline island county's crime rate
has declined, despite a steady increase in its population and the
"mini three links" traffic volume. the "mini three links" refer
to direct shipping services between Kinmen/Matsu and Fujian's
Xiamen and Mawei.
