Taipei,  Jan. 13 (CNA) 01/13/07  20:54:30 (By Elizabeth Hsu)

The legislative caucuses of the ruling and opposition parties
have said they will decide next week whether or not to give the
green light to the nomination of Chen Tsung-ming for the
country's top prosecutorial post before a Jan. 18 legislative
vote on the case.
</P>
<P>
In May, President Chen Shui-bian nominated Chen Tsung-ming,
public prosecutor- general of the Taiwan High Court's Kaohsiung
branch, to take over the post that has been vacant for months,
after his first nominee,  Taiwan High Court Prosecutor-General
Hsieh Wen-ting failed to obtain the endorsement of the
Legislative Yuan.
</P>
<P>
Tsai Chin-lung, chief executive of the legislative caucus of the
main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) , said Saturday that the caucus
has no particular view concerning Chen Tsung-ming's competence
and will convene a meeting one day before the vote to decide
whether or not to agree with the nomination.
</P>
<P>
The legislative committees in charge of the judiciary, organic
laws and statutes, as well as home and nations affairs, held two
joint meetings last week to review Chen's qualification for the
significant post and are scheduled to organize a third before the
final vote.
</P>
<P>
Tsai said the KMT caucus hopes only that a complete review system
can be established in the Legislative Yuan for its right of
consent on the nominees for posts like Control Yuan members and
grand justices.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Ko Chien-min, convener of the legislative caucus of
the ruling Democratic Progressive Party, said the caucus respects
the president's nomination and will issue a first-degree
mobilization order, which means that all the party's lawmakers
must attend the confirmation of Chen Tsung-ming's nomination.
</P>
<P>
As for the opposition People First Party (PFP) and the Taiwan
Solidarity Union (TSU) , the PFP said it will discuss the issue
Jan. 16, while the TSU said it has no plan to convene a caucus
meeting on the nomination, but party lawmakers have decided to
exchange views privately to obtain common agreement.
</P>
<P>
The legislature rejected Hsieh with 101 yes votes, 19 no votes,
and 88 invalid votes. Endorsement requires half of the
legislators present at the vote to pass the nomination.
