Fruit traders in Yunlin County in central Taiwan began Saturday
to purchase locally grown oranges for export to China in an
effort to relieve a glut of the fruit in local markets.
</P>
<P>
The exports were decided upon after China agreed to buy 1,200
tons of Taiwanese oranges. The agreement was made a day earlier
during a meeting in Beijing between Chinese fruit purchasing
units and Taiwanese farmer's associations and fruit trading
companies.
</P>
<P>
The opposition Kuomintang (KMT) arranged the meeting through its
party-to-party communication channel with the Communist Party of
China,  according to a news release from the National Policy
Foundation, a KMT think tank.
</P>
<P>
KMT Chairman Ma Ying-jeou visited Yunlin last week and local
fruit farmers asked him to help resolve the problem of poor
orange prices due to an unexpected glut, the news release said.
</P>
<P>
The KMT think tank said the Chinese units promising to buy Taiwan
oranges include big business groups and trading companies, which
operate over 220,000 trading outlets in total around China.
</P>
<P>
To promote Taiwan's high-quality oranges in the Chinese market,
Taiwan's fruit suppliers have also promised to sell premium
products to China, according to the press release.
</P>
<P>
The first shipment of three containers of the oranges was sent to
Shanghai Jan. 16.
