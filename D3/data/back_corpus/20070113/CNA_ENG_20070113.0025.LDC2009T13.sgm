In an attempt to prevent the Rebar Group fiasco from worsening,
the Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) is to investigate Rebar
Group subsidiaries one by one and offer assistance accordingly to
help them return to normal operations, a ministry spokesman said
Saturday.

According to Deputy Economics Minister Shih Yen-hsiang, windows
of communication have been established and probes will continue,
with the Department of Commerce in charge of investigating the
Idee Department Store and the Industrial Development Bureau
responsible for checking corporations involved in the synthetic
fiber business.

Wang You-theng, founder and chairman of the Rebar Group, fled to
China with his wife December 30, one day after his group
declaring insolvency, leaving behind a financial mess of insider
trading, embezzlement and fraud and leaving the group's 3,500
employees in limbo.
