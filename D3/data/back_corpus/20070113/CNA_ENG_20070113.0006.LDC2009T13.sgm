Shih tendered his resignation to assume political responsibility
for a run on the Chinese Bank, an affiliate of the Rebar group.

China Rebar Co. and Chia Hsin Food &amp; Synthetic Fiber Co. --
filed for insolvency reorganization a day earlier.

advisory post and FSC Chairwoman Susan Chang will concurrently
head the Bureau of Banking affairs for the time being," Tsai
