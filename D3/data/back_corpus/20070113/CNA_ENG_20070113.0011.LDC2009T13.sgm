Although the total number of elementary and junior high school
students has been declining in the country, the number of those
from mixed marriages has increased 1.8 times over the past four
years, according to a report released this month by the Ministry
of Education (MOE).
</P>
<P>
For the 2006-2007 academic year, a total of 80,166 children from
mixed marriages are enrolled in elementary and junior high
schools, up 33 percent from 60,258 in the previous year, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
Of these children, 17,463 are enrolled in elementary schools and
9,369 are enrolled in junior high schools.
</P>
<P>
The number of elementary and junior high school students has
decreased from 2.87 million in the 2003-2004 academic year to
2.75 million in the 2006-2007 academic year, according to the
report.
</P>
<P>
In contrast, the number of those from mixed marriages has jumped
from 30,040 in the 2003-2004 academic year to more than 80,000 in
the 2006-2007 academic year.
</P>
<P>
MOE officials noted that the number of students admitted to
elementary schools has been dropping since 2004 as the country's
birth rate has seen a sharp fall since 1998.
</P>
<P>
However, the relatively high fertility rate among Southeast Asian
women married to Taiwanese men has helped slow the rate of
decrease of students, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
They said that although the performance of mixed-race children
tends to be "inferior" to others when they first enter school
because of their weaker Chinese  language  ability  and their
lower socio-economic status, they gradually catch up as they
advance to higher grades.
