'BANK RUN BOMB EXPLODES IN MY HAND:' PREMIER
</HEADLINE>

Taipei, Jan. 13 (CNA) 01/13/07  18:47:48 (By Lilian Wu)
</P>
<P>
Premier Su Tseng-chang said Saturday that a recent bank run
triggered by a financially troubled business group had been in
the making for more than a decade, but it was only in his hand
that "the bomb" exploded.
</P>
<P>
The premier made the remarks while attending a seminar presided
over by Chen Wu- hsiung, chairman of the Chinese National
Federation of Industries.
</P>
<P>
He was commenting on the Jan. 5 run on the Chinese Bank, an
affiliate of the Rebar Asia Pacific Group, one day after two
other affiliates of the group -- China Rebar Co. and Chia Hsin
Food and Synthetic Fiber Co. -- filed for insolvency
restructuring. The run eased only after the government stepped
in, but panicked depositors had already withdrawn NT$32 billion
(US$975.6 million) from the bank in just three days.
</P>
<P>
Wang You-theng, founder of the Rebar Group, which reportedly
controls  more than  120  companies  spanning  manufacturing,
communications, media, banking, financial and other services,
fled to China with his wife late last month. Prosecutors raided
the group headquarters, questioned more than 40 executives and
barred them from leaving the country in a probe of the
snowballing financial scandal.
</P>
<P>
Not only has President Chen Shui-bian demanded that Su be more
vigilant to the situation, but the premier has also been under
heavy fire for his slow response to the worst run since 2000 when
the Democratic Progressive Party took power.
</P>
<P>
The premier said the Central Deposit Insurance Corp. had not
planned to take over the bank -- on a government watch list for
the last five years -- hoping that it could find a way to save
itself.
</P>
<P>
The bank did manage to cut its loans to clients related to the
Rebar Group to NT$5 billion from NT$30 billion, the premier said.
</P>
<P>
"But the bomb was still there and this time it exploded, " the
premier said, adding that the government finally had to step in.
</P>
<P>
He also rebutted criticism  that the government  is using
taxpayers' money to reimburse the depositors.
</P>
<P>
According to the regulations of the Financial Reconstruction
Fund, the government will not only take over the troubled bank
but will ensure that all depositors can withdraw their money.
</P>
<P>
After selling off the bank in the wake of an assessment of its
assets and liabilities, if there are still losses, then they will
be footed by the people, he said.
</P>
<P>
The urgent task facing the government is to stabilize financial
order, assist relevant industries and the innocent employees of
the affected companies, the premier said.
</P>
<P>
He claimed that financial reforms promoted by the government have
borne fruit, citing as examples the cutting of the bad loan ratio
of the banks to 2.3 percent from 14 percent on average, and the
writing off of more than NT$1.6 trillion of bad loans.
</P>
<P>
The premier also said he has instructed the Ministry of Economic
Affairs to be more open and transparent in the notification
mechanism of companies filing for insolvency restructuring.
</P>
<P>
Communication between the various government agencies should also
be stepped up, the premier said, adding that there is ample room
for improvement in this regard.
