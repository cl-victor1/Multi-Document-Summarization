An event titled the "1824 Health Walk" hosted by the Kaohsiung
County Cancer Society and the Kaohsiung County Health Bureau took
place Saturday at Fengshang reservoir in the county's Linyuan
township.

<P>
Local sports legend Chi Cheng, nicknamed the "flying antelope, "
and Deputy County Magistrate Wu Yu-wen walked the path around the
reservoir along with thousands of people after a warm-up led by
students from Fooying University.

<P>
Wu noted that the importance of exercise increases with age, and
said "10,000 steps per day can keep cancer away." Taiwanese
people these days spend their time indoors singing karaoke, which
is not good for the health. People should take more exercise,
said Wu.

<P>
Chi encouraged people to take more exercise to improve their
immune systems. Both Chi and Cho Chuen-Ying, Vice Chairman of the
Kaohsiung County Department of Public Affairs, emphasized that
health is more important than wealth.
</P>
<P>
The Kaohsiung County Health Bureau had set up stands along the
route  promoting health  events  providing  various  kinds of
health-related information.
