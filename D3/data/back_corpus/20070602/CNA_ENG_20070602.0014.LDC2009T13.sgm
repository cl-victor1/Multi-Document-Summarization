'PAN-GREEN CAMP' YET TO DECIDE ON COMBINING ELECTIONS
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taipei,  June  2 (CNA) 06/02/07  17:28:40 (By Lilian Wu)
</P>
<P>
The 'pan-green camp" led by the ruling Democratic Progressive
Party (DPP) has yet to forge a consensus on whether to hold the
next legislative and presidential elections simultaneously.
</P>
<P>
Wang Tuoh, a major whip in the party's legislative caucus, said
Saturday that although he expects the DPP to support a combining
of the elections, the party has yet to reach a consensus on the
matter.
</P>
<P>
Wang's remarks came one day after the Central Election Commission
(CEC) decided that the next legislative elections will be held
Jan. 12, 2008.
</P>
<P>
As the term of the present CEC commissioners will expire June 16,
they left the question of whether to hold the legislative
elections alongside the 2008 presidential election to the next
CEC.
</P>
<P>
Wang said the DPP should approve the combining of the elections,
otherwise the party will face difficulties in the legislative
elections, especially because the party's legislative candidates
produced through a controversial primary may not have a broad
base of support and will have to rely on the presidential
election to build up the momentum of support for the party.
</P>
<P>
If the two elections are held separately, the DPP will have
difficulty winning more than half of the seats in the streamlined
legislative elections, which in turn will be detrimental to the
party's chances in the presidential election, according to Wang.
</P>
<P>
Kuo Lin-yung, a major party whip of the Taiwan Solidarity Union,
said that the legislative elections are traditionally held in
December, and the CEC's decision to hold the legislative
elections later than usual is probably due to the fact that it is
working in tune with the wishes of the DPP.
</P>
<P>
Kuo urged the DPP to coordinate with his party, saying that
holding the elections simultaneously will be favorable to the
major political parties fielding presidential candidates.
</P>
<P>
The major opposition Kuomintang should also coordinate with its
ally, the People First Party, on the matter, Kuo added.
</P>
<P>
However, DPP Legislator Jao Yung-ching said that for caution's
sake, it is better to discuss the matter thoroughly.
</P>
<P>
Jao said that if a new president is elected in January, he will
have to wait for four months to assume the presidency in May,
which the legislator noted will pose problems for the current
president as well as cause difficulties in the transferring of
power.
