Taipei,  June 2 (CNA) 06/02/07  18:23:28 (By Y.F. Low)

A Chinese-language smoking cessation Web site set up by the John
Tung Foundation will officially open Sunday, foundation officials
said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Foundation CEO Chou Yi-heng said the group came up with the idea
of establishing the Web site to help smokers quit the habit after
seeing that many anti-smoking organizations in Canada, Australia,
Britain and the United States have made similar moves.
</P>
<P>
However, as most of the existing smoking cessation Web sites are
in English, they are of little help to ethnic Chinese
communities, Chou said.
</P>
<P>
He said the Web site to be launched by the foundation targets the
350 million smokers in China, 5 million in Taiwan and 800,000 in
Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
In the initial stage, the Web site can only be viewed in
traditional Chinese characters, and the simplified Chinese
character version will be available in October, Chou said.
</P>
<P>
In one of the services to be provided, the Web site has prepared
a total 56 letters written by smoking cessation experts for
delivery to smokers planning to quit smoking, he said.
</P>
<P>
With each smoker expected to receive one letter a day, the
service is aimed at helping smokers overcome the physical or
mental discomfort experienced in the process of quitting the
habit, Chou said.
</P>
<P>
Kuo fei-jang, a family physician at National Taiwan University
Hospital, pointed out that the assistance of experts is essential
for smokers to persist in their efforts to quit the habit.
</P>
<P>
While less than 5 percent of smokers can succeed in quitting
smoking on their own within six months, the success rate
increases to 10 percent for those that have consulted with
doctors, and further to 20 percent for those who participate in a
smoking cessation program provided as part of the outpatient
service at certain hospitals, Kuo said.
