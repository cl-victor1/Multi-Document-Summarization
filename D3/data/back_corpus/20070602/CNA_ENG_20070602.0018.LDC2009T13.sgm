'CAR-FREE' TOUR LAUNCHED TO RAISE ENVIRONMENTAL AWARENESS

Taipei, June 2 (CNA) 06/02/07  19:45:34 (By Chris Wang)

To promote the idea of a "Car-free Asia" and environmental
awareness, 20 people from around the world, including eight from
Taiwan, will launch a four-month "car-free" tour from Beijing to
Paris, traveling on bicycle most of the way, on June 10 at
Beijing's Tiananman Square.
</P>
<P>
The "Beijing to Paris (B2P) Car-free" tour is about "celebrating
better mobility, " said Wu Yi-ting, one of the participants in
the event, along with New Zealander Olly Powell, at a press
conference. As the first group of participants have already
started their tour, in April, Wu said, the second group will
start the 100,000-kilometer expedition June 10, adding that they
expect to arrive in Paris in October.
</P>
<P>
In 1907, three Italians completed the first Beijing-Paris trip by
automobile. Wu and Powell came up with the idea of traveling the
same route because "automobile transportation has changed the
world in many ways and changed people's way of life, led to over-
consumption of energy, and destroyed the environment, " said Wu,
who has been living a carefree life and who has cycled across
South America.
</P>
<P>
"This event will draw attention to one of the most important
issues today. Nothing is more important than the issue of global
warming. If we don't change the way we live, we'll have to build
a memorial hall for the life we lost, " said Canadian composer
Matthew Lien, who has been vocal on environmental issues and who
has voiced support for the event.
</P>
<P>
The goal of this activity is to travel without cars or "support
vehicles, " but it's up to the individual participants to make
their travel plans and choose their routes.  Most participants
have indicated they will cycle all the way. Others will take
trains and ferries on some sections of the journey.
</P>
<P>
Thus far, there are three likely three routes that will be
traveled. Some participants are planning to go via the "middle
route" -- through China, Kyrgystan, Kazakhstan, Russia and
Poland. Wu and the other participants from Taiwan will take a
more northern route to avoid visa complications in Eastern Europe
and will enter Europe via Finland. Some participants have
suggested that they will take the classic Silk Road route, via
Central Asia, Iran and Turkey.
</P>
<P>
"This event gives me the opportunity to fulfill my lifelong dream
of cycling from Asia to Europe and to raise environmental
awareness among Taiwanese, " said 32-year-old Aaron Huang, who
quit his job of 15 years as an Air Force mechanic to take part in
the activity.
</P>
<P>
"Hopefully, I can arrive in Paris on September 22 -- which is
World Car-free Day, " Huang said.
</P>
<P>
A number of representatives of environmental groups, as well as
the chairman of Mongolia's Green Party Erdenechuluun Zorigt, also
attended the press conference to show their support for the
event.
</P>
<P>
"This initiative by a Taiwanese girl gives us a perfect example
of Taiwan's meaningful participation in international affairs, "
said Pan Hen-sheng, secretary-general of the Green Party Taiwan.
