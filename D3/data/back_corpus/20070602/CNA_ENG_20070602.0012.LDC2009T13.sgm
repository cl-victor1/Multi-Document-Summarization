DRUG-RELATED CRIME SERIOUS IN TAIWAN: INVESTIGATION BUREAU
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

Taipei,  June 2 (CNA) 06/02/07  16:50:54 (By Y.F. Low)

<P>
The rampant drug trafficking activities and rising repeat rate of
drug-related crime in Taiwan remain major challenges for law
enforcement authorities in the country, an Investigation Bureau
official said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking during the 2007 International Drug Control Symposium
held in Taipei, Wang Hua-fu, director of the bureau's narcotics
control center, noted that heroin, amphetamine and ketamine
accounted for the largest amount among all the kinds of illicit
drugs seized by Taiwan police over the past four years.
</P>
<P>
In the most recent two years, the amount of ketamine seized by
police has been increasing rapidly, making it the most common
abused substance in the country, Wang said.
</P>
<P>
According  to Wang,  since China stepped up its crackdown
operations against amphetamine abuse in 2000, many amphetamine
producers have moved back to Taiwan or to Southeast Asian
countries.
</P>
<P>
The fact that the Investigation  Bureau has arrested many
amphetamine makers over the past several years in Taiwan
indicates that amphetamine production is still very prevalent
here, Wang said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, new kinds of abused substances, such as ecstasy pills,
flunitrazepam, nimetazepam,  zolpidem and surazepam, have been
discovered by police during their raids on bubble tea houses, KTV
parlors, bars and night clubs, Wang said, adding that there is a
rising trend among drug users to take several kinds of illicit
drugs at one time to enhance the intoxicating effect.
</P>
<P>
Compared with traditional drugs, the emerging synthetic drugs are
cheaper and more lucrative because of their low production costs,
which increases their potential of being abused by a greater
number of people in the future, he warned.
</P>
<P>
Over the last five years, the ratio of repeat or serial drug-
related crime has averaged more than 65 percent, and it is rising
every year, with the ratio registering more than 70 percent for
2005, he said.
</P>
<P>
The symposium was organized by the Ministry of Justice, the
Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of Education and the
Department of Health, with the participants including drug-
fighting officers and experts from the United States, Canada,
France, Australia, Japan and major Southeast Asian countries.
