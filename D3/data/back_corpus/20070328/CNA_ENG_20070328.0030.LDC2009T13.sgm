Taipei,  March 28 (CNA) 03/28/07  19:09:45 (By Elizabeth Hsu)

The contributions of the late President Chiang Kai-shek to Taiwan
are greater than the doubts about his authoritarian
administration of the country,  Taipei Mayor Hau Lung-bin claimed
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The issue concerning a recent trend to eliminate the existence of
the image and name of Chiang around Taiwan triggered a debate at
a session of the Taipei City Council in which Councilor Lee
Ching-yuan of the opposition New Party described the anti-Chiang
campaign activists as "ungrateful."
</P>
<P>
If the late leader had not relocated the Republic of China
government from China to Taiwan in 1949 after the communists
seized power and had not led a military force in efforts to
safeguard Taiwan from Chinese attack, the island would have been
occupied by the communist regime in Beijing, Lee claimed.
</P>
<P>
Echoing Lee's remarks, Hau recognized the contribution of Chinese
immigrants who followed Chiang to Taiwan. He also mentioned that
other ethnic groups have greatly contributed to Taiwan's economic
and social development.
</P>
<P>
Asked how the city government will deal with the issue, City
Director of Education Wu Ching-chi said Chiang will have his
position in history despite the disputes over his authoritarian
regime.
</P>
<P>
Wu said the statues of Chiang on campuses should not be torn down
but he added that his department will not install more similar
statues. "The campus should never be a place for ideological
disputes," he noted.
