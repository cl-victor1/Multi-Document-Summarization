Former opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Ma Ying-jeou would be
happy to see Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng visit China,
a spokesman for his office said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman made the remarks after the China Times, a local
newspaper, speculated that Wang will visit Beijing sometime in
April and that his itinerary will include a meeting with Chinese
President Hu Jingtao and talks with Chinese officials on the
opening of cross-strait cargo charter flight services and the
opening of various operations of cross-strait financial
exchanges.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that Ma's views on cross-Taiwan Strait
relations have been consistent, which are to promote cross-strait
peace and prosperity, and that he is happy to see any policy or
measures that will be conducive to that purpose, whether it is a
visit by Wang to China, the opening of cross-strait direct
transport links, or allowing Taiwan's financial institutions to
invest in China.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, acting KMT Chairman Chiang Ping-kun speculated that if
Wang makes a visit and breaks some ground, then it will be good
for the nation.
</P>
<P>
However, he admitted that talks with any real meaning will
involve a lot of "technical issues" that Wang will be unable to
deal with. Instead, the bodies designated by the respective
governments across the Taiwan Strait are the only bodies
authorized to conduct such talks.
</P>
<P>
Chiang noted that a number of financial institutions such as
banks and securities companies have made inroads into China, but
said they are hindered from further development because related
operations are prohibited by the Ministry of Economic Affairs.
