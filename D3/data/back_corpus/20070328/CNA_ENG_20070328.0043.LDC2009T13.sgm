<P>
The Tzu Chi Bone Marrow and Stem Cell Center -- the largest bone
marrow registry in Asia -- has again succeeded in finding a
donor, this time for a 4-year-old boy in China suffering from
thalassemia -- an inherited form of anemia.
</P>
<P>
Shih Ming-huang, acting president of the Buddhist Tzu Chi General
Hospital in Hualien, presented on Wednesday the stem cells from a
donor to Wang Peipei, a doctor of Shanghai Children's Medical
Center who will rush back to Shanghai to save the child's life.
</P>
<P>
The boy surnamed Chiu, who lives in Suzhou in China's Jiangsu
province, was recently diagnosed as having thalassemia, which
occurs chiefly among people of Mediterranean descent.
</P>
<P>
The disease is a complex series of disorders characterized by
underproduction of hemoglobin, the oxygen-carrying protein inside
the red blood cells.
</P>
<P>
Doctors in China predicted that without a bone marrow transplant.
the child will not live beyond 12.
</P>
<P>
Members of the Buddhist Compassion Relief Tzu Chi Foundation
sprang to action when they learned that the boy needed a bone
marrow transplant. They requested assistance from staff in charge
of the bone marrow registry and succeeded in matching the child
with a donor.
</P>
<P>
The Tzu Chi Bone Marrow and Stem Cell Center has built a data
bank with nearly 300,000 bone marrow samples since its inception
in 1993. It has helped more than 300 victims of blood diseases to
find donors.
</P>
<P>
The center now has access to more than 10 million donors' data
worldwide after linking with two bone marrow data banks in the
United States and Germany late last year.
