Taipei,    March   28   (CNA) 03/28/07  22:12:38 (By Sofia Wu)

Taiwan's  fourth-to-sixth-grade schoolchildren would most like to
possess a magic "dokodemo door," an imaginary gadget that allows
travel to anywhere simply by going through it, according to the
results of an opinion poll released Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The survey,  conducted  by the Common Health Magazine  in
celebrations of the upcoming Children's Day,  also found that
schoolchildren most dislike being compared to peers or classmates
by their parents.
</P>
<P>
Asked how they would like their parents to treat them, five out
of 10 respondents said they wished their parents would not
compare them with others; 33.83 percent said they would like
their parents to not always demand high scores on academic tests.
</P>
<P>
The magazine conducted telephone interviews from Jan. 1-29 with
randomly chosen fourth-to-sixth grade students from around Taiwan
and collected 789 valid replies. The survey has a margin of error
of 3.5 percent, 19 out of 20 times.
</P>
<P>
Analyzing the survey findings, Hei Yu-lung, president of Carnegie
Consultancy Taiwan, said local schoolchildren yearn for a
carefree life, which is why they look forward to possessing a
"dokodemo door" gadget such as that depicted in the famous
Japanese comic series about a robotic cat, "Doraemon".
</P>
<P>
Noting that every child is special, Hei reminded local parents of
school-age children never to compare their children with others
but rather show more care attention to them.
</P>
<P>
According to the survey, nearly 70 percent of schoolchildren said
they don't like to use school toilets because they are afraid
that such places are not clean or hide "bad guys".
</P>
<P>
More than half of those surveyed said they usually don't go to
bed until after 10 p.m., with 40 percent citing an "inability to
fall asleep" as the main reason for staying up late at night.
Other reasons cited for falling asleep late included watching
television, having too much homework, too many reading
assignments, staying up with other family members who are night
owls, or being preoccupied with Internet surfing and video games.
</P>
<P>
Asked who they turn to for advice when they have troubles or
difficulties, 31.45 percent said they would first talk with their
classmates or friends; 27.67 percent said they would talk with
their mothers; only 5.37 percent said they would talk with their
fathers.
</P>
<P>
As to activities that schoolchildren undertake during breaks
between classes, 71.54 percent said they chat with classmates;
64.93 percent said they go outdoors to play or exercise; and
15.59 percent said they prefer to read.
</P>
<P>
Another noteworthy finding was that 68 percent of the respondents
said they had been mocked by schoolmates because of their
appearance; nearly 90 percent said they have either heard or seen
classmates being mocked because of their appearance.
</P>
<P>
The findings indicate that parents should take care not just of
whether or not their school-age children have fallen victim to
school yard violence, but also whether or not they are verbally
abused, Hei said.
</P>
<P>
Noting that verbal abuse tends to scar a child's psyche, Hei said
parents should ensure the balanced development of their children
with respect to both intellectual and emotional development.
