Taipei, March 28 (CNA) 03/28/07  19:04:35 (By Y.C. Jou)

<P>
A polling format for the ruling Democratic Progressive Party's
(DPP) presidential primary is expected to pass the party's
Central Executive Committee Wednesday but is not welcomed by Vice
President Annette Lu and DPP Chairman Yu Shyi-kun.
</P>
<P>
In a radio interview, Lu said the move by the president's aide to
put forward the case was "rough" and will discredit the
president.
</P>
<P>
Presidential Office Secretary-General Chiou I-jen initiated the
format aimed at excluding 30 percent of voters who are strong
supporters of the opposition "pan blue alliance" from the DPP's
public opinion surveys that account for 70 percent of the primary
process.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that Lu and Yu would prefer stricter measures to
keep out even more people who might not be pro-DPP, while Premier
Su Tseng-chang and former premier Frank Hsieh are among 28 of the
35-seat Central Executive Committee who have signed Chiou's
proposal.
</P>
<P>
Lu said she was not consulted by Chiou when he initiated the
format, adding that she does not believe it is what the president
intended.
</P>
<P>
Yu, responding to the media before attending the committee
meeting, also complained about not having been consulted over the
new polling format.
</P>
<P>
He said he was unable to reverse the development but will accept
the polling format adopted through democratic processes.
