Deputy Minister of Justice Wang Tien-sheng said Wednesday that
the ministry has no set stance on whether serious sex offenders
should be chemically castrated or caned and will listen to public
views on the issue.
</P>
<P>
Wang made the remarks during a seminar sponsored by the ministry
to discuss whether to cane sex criminals after three legislators
of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) recently floated
this form of punishment for serial rapists. Those attending the
seminar also included legislative caucuses of various parties,
women's groups, scholars and experts.
</P>
<P>
Wang said that to add another form of punishment to the judicial
system is a big question and the ministry will have to listen to
views from all quarters and publish the ministry's views within
one month.
</P>
<P>
DPP Legislator Cheng Yun-peng said that before carrying out the
punishment of caning, alternatives should be discussed to let the
victims feel that the perpetrators are getting punishment that
fits the crime.
</P>
<P>
Cheng noted that more than 5,800 compensation cases for wrongful
imprisonment were recorded over the past decade in Taiwan. Since
caning is an irreversible punishment, those who receive it might
get no justice if they later prove to be innocent.
</P>
<P>
Cheng reiterated his stance on abolishing capital punishment as
well as his opposition to caning.
</P>
<P>
DPP Legislator Hsueh Ling, one of the three lawmakers who floated
the caning proposal, said she was speaking up for the victims.
</P>
<P>
She noted that 17 countries practice caning and said her main
intent is to deter serious sex offenders from repeating their
crimes.
