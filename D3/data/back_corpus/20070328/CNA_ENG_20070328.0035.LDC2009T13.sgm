TAICHUNG MAYOR CALLS FOR WAR AGAINST ORGANIZED CRIME
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taichung,  March 28 (CNA) 03/28/07  20:52:02 (By Han Nai-kuo)
</P>
<P>
Taichung Mayor Jason Hu Wednesday urged the central government to
lead all local governments in Taiwan in declaring war on
organized crime.
</P>
<P>
Returning from Japan after a five-day visit, Hu immediately went
to the Taichung city police bureau to hear a briefing on the
police investigation into a case in which members of a crime
syndicate adopted an unusually high profile in announcing their
intentions to shoot one another.
</P>
<P>
In self-produced video tapes sent separately to TV networks
earlier this week, an underworld kingpin and his estranged former
follower each demonstrated an array of firearms and threatened to
kill each other.
</P>
<P>
The video footage -- televised by nearly all TV networks -- has
not only bruised the pride of Taichung police, but also signaled
a regression in the city's public safety record.
</P>
<P>
Hu said he was kept well-informed about the case while in Japan
and felt that police could never tolerate criminals settling
scores in such a "flagrant, audacious" manner and totally
ignoring the existence of law enforcement agencies.
</P>
<P>
Noting that Taichung's public safety rating moved up seven
notches last year in comparison to other cities and counties in
Taiwan, Hu acknowledged that despite the improvement, a series of
criminal cases involving the use of firearms this month has left
the impression that Taichung's public safety has deteriorated.
</P>
<P>
The mayor urged the central government and all local governments
to work together in fighting organized crime.
</P>
<P>
Hu admitted that in previous efforts to improve Taichung's public
safety, he did not pay particular attention to preventing
organized crime.
</P>
<P>
He expressed confidence in the ability of the Taichung police
force to bring the criminals to justice.
</P>
<P>
Taichung used to receive the lowest satisfaction ranking in terms
of public safety among all Taiwan's cities, but managed to cut
crime in 2006 and recorded fewer than 4,000 criminal cases per
100,000 residents -- the lowest crime rate in 10 years.
</P>
<P>
Methods used by the mayor included cash rewards to meritorious
police officers, setting up closed-circuit cameras on every
street within the city to discourage crime, and recruiting an
additional 500 police officers every year over four years to
supplement the city's existing force of 2,500 officers.
