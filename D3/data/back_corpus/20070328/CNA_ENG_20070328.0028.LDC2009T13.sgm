A stroke victim who was paralyzed down one side of his body has
recovered after doctors at a central Taiwan hospital treated him
with a combination therapy, including brain surgery, hyperbaric
oxygenation, acupuncture and rehabilitation.
</P>
<P>
Hsia Te-chun, director of China Medical University's Hyperbaric
Oxygen Therapy Center, disclosed Wednesday that the 50-year-old
patient surnamed Lin was virtually in a state similar to that of
an infant after doctors performed surgery on him following a
stroke.
</P>
<P>
Stroke is brought on by bleeding in the brain or by lack of blood
flow to the brain, known as ischemia. It can cause death or
permanent disability, such as paralysis on one or both sides of
the body.
</P>
<P>
According to Hsia, when the patient's condition stabilized after
the surgery, neurologists  recommended  the use of pressurized
oxygenation to revive his damaged brain cells and increase the
blood flow to his brain.
</P>
<P>
The patient was treated in a hyperbaric chamber 20 times during a
45-day period, each time followed  by additional  therapy  of
acupuncture and rehabilitation.
</P>
<P>
A hyperbaric chamber is an enclosed environment that can dispense
pure oxygen under pressure slightly above normal in order to
dissolve extra oxygen into the patient's blood plasma. Its
effects have been recognized as useful in the treatment of
anemia, ischemia, poisoning, edema, burns, crush injuries, acute
brain and spinal cord injuries.
</P>
<P>
Hsia recalled that his patient was able to walk into the
Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy Center in the latter stage of his
treatment -- a sharp contract to his previous trips to the
hospital in a wheelchair.
</P>
<P>
Staff at the center said they had monitored the patient for
nearly two years and can now safely conclude that the combination
therapy has helped the patient recover.
