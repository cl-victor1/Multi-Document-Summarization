Kaohsiung,  June 8 (CNA) (By Deborah Kuo)
</P>
<P>
President Chen Shui-bian said Wednesday that procrastination in the
legislature might jeopardize Taiwan's chances of purchasing important
U.S. weapon systems and consequently cause the armed forces to miss an
opportunity to upgrade its defensive capabilities.
</P>
<P>
Speaking during a lunch at the headquarters of the 564th Armored
Brigade based in the A-lien rural township in the southern county of
</P>
<P>
Kaohsiung, Chen said the opposition lawmakers' continued blockage of
the passage of a bill on major arms procurements initiated by the
Democratic Progressive Party administration has worried him
tremendously, as it will further aggravate the military imbalance
across the Taiwan Strait.
</P>
<P>
Chen stressed that the procurement plan, including eight diesel-
electric submarines, six Patriot PAC-3 anti-missile batteries and a
squadron of 12 P-3C anti-submarine aircraft, will neither crowd out
the overall government budget plans nor affect spending related to the
people's wellbeing.

The president reviewed a tank drill at the 564th Armored Brigade
before lunching with officers and soldiers of the brigade as part of
celebrations for the Dragon Boat Festival, which falls on June 11 this
year.

Chen was accompanied by Vice President Annette Lu, Defense Minister
Lee Jye, Chief of the General Staff Gen. Lee Tien-yu and Army
Commander-in-Chief Chu Kai-sheng on the inspection tour.

The window of opportunity is closing for the Republic of China to
purchase a squadron of 12 P-3C anti-submarine aircraft from the United
States, Minister of National Defense Lee Jye said at the Legislative
Yuan May 24, adding that the U.S. has given Taiwan till the end of May
to buy the planes, otherwise they will be sold elsewhere.
