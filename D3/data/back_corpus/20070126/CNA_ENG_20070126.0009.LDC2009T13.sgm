<HEADLINE>
AGENDA FOR PLANNED EXTRA LEGISLATIVE SESSION TO BE SET MONDAY
</HEADLINE>

Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng said Friday he will invite
lawmakers from the ruling and opposition camps to meet next
Monday to work out an agenda for a proposed extra legislative
session.
</P>
<P>
The opposition-controlled legislature is scheduled to hold a talk
session Monday to discuss  whether  to hold an extraordinary
legislative session to deal with several key bills, including the
government's 2007 budget plan.
</P>
<P>
Before the opening of the talk session, Wang said, he will invite
caucus whips from across the political spectrum to forge a
consensus on topics to be put on the agenda for the planned extra
legislative session as well as discuss some controversial clauses
in the main opposition Kuomintang-initiated draft bill on
amending the Central Election Commission (CEC) Organic Law.
</P>
<P>
Whether the proposed extra legislative session can take place
will hinge on whether the ruling and opposition camps can mend
their differences on the agenda.
</P>
<P>
While the ruling Democratic Progressive Party-initiated motion
for convening an extra session listed a long-stalled draft bill
on the organizational rules for a labor pension fund management
and supervisory commission as the second most urgent piece of
legislation to be addressed at the proposed extra session after
the 2007 budget bill, the KMT-initiated extra session convening
motion didn't include the labor pension bill at all.
</P>
<P>
For the KMT, the most urgent bill is the CEC bill, which, if
enacted, would allow political parties to recommend CEC
commissioners in proportion to the number of legislative seats
each of them controls, an arrangement that the DPP strongly
opposes.
</P>
<P>
Bickering over the CEC bill led to a chaotic end to the
Legislative Yuan's winter session last Friday. The fruitless
session also marked the first time in the nation's history that
the central government budget bill had failed to pass the
legislature before the beginning of the fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said squabbling over partisan bills has prompted the
just-concluded legislative session to end with a string of broken
promises, including failure to pass a package of "sunshine bills"
aimed at creating a clean political environment via legislation.
</P>
<P>
Quantitatively, the winter session only passed 39 bills, a new
low, even though the statutory four-month session was extended
another 19 days from its legal end date of Dec. 31, 2006.
