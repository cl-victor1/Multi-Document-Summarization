Taipei,  Jan. 26 (CNA) 01/26/07  18:52:24 (By Lilian Wu)

<P>
New Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU) Chairman Huang Kung-huei said
Friday that his first task will be to engage in party reform so
as to win public trust.
</P>
<P>
Huang said he is also considering whether to change the name of
the party to project a clear set of values to "rekindle the
passion of the people."
</P>
<P>
Huang made the remarks at a swearing-in ceremony in Taipei. Also
on hand were former President Lee Teng-hui, Premier Su Tseng-
chang, Vice Premier Tsai Ing- wen, Vice Legislative Speaker Chung
Jung-chi, ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) Chairman Yu
Shyi-kun, opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Vice Chairman Wu Po-hsiung,
World United Formosans for Independence Chairman Ng Chiau-tong
and former senior adviser to the Presidential Office Koo Kuan-
min.
</P>
<P>
Huang touted his party as the only opposition party that
enshrines Taiwan's separate identity with China and that speaks
for the middle-class and underprivileged.
</P>
<P>
The party will be firm on its stance of Taiwan's separate
identity and will monitor the government closely to make sure it
does not deviate from this path and tilt toward China, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said Taiwan's development in the aspects of politics, economy
and social justice has been worrisome in recent years.
</P>
<P>
The public have high hopes for political reforms, but they are
disappointed, he said, adding that the democratic progress that
Taiwan used to be proud of has suffered a serious setback.
</P>
<P>
The government's erratic policy has resulted in the hollowing out
of industry, rising unemployment, widening gap between the rich
and poor, chaotic politics and a declining economy, he claimed.
</P>
<P>
Two major political parties -- the DPP and the KMT -- are mired
in political bickering without any regard for the public welfare,
he said.
</P>
<P>
To break the political stalemate, the public needs the party to
speak up for them, he said, vowing to implement reforms to
deliver this promise to the people.
</P>
<P>
On cross-strait issues, Huang advocated a cross-strait status
quo, adding that Lee's "special state-to-state" theory should
apply to cross-strait relations.
</P>
<P>
The TSU was founded by former Interior Minister Huang Chu-wen in
July 2001 with former President Lee serving as its "spiritual
leader."
