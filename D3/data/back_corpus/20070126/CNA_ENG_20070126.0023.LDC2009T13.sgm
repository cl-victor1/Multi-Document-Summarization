Taipei,  Jan. 26 (CNA) 01/26/07  17:34:15 (By Elizabeth Hsu)

President Chen Shui-bian said Friday that it is "time for Taiwan
to create a new constitution that is well-timed, properly
designed and usable for the country."
</P>
<P>
Chen made the remarks at a seminar held to enlist global support
for his global forum on new democracies, claiming that Taiwan
will "regret it in the future if it does not act now" in writing
a new constitution.
</P>
<P>
"Taiwan can't be called a normal, complete and progressive new
democracy unless it has a new constitution, " Chen told five
former foreign government leaders -- former South African
President Frederik Willem de Klerk, former South Korean President
Kim Young Sam, former El Salvador President Francisco Flores,
former Polish President Lech Walesa and former Mongolian
President Punsalmaagiyn Ochirbat -- who participated in the
Taipei event to demonstrate their support for Chen's forum.
</P>
<P>
In the seminar on topics including "choices in the constitutional
politic mechanism" and "justice in the democratic transformation
period, " Chen said the act of forming a new constitution is the
most significant symbol of the emergence of a democracy, marking
"the end of an old age, and the beginning of a new era."
</P>
<P>
No country in the world can achieve democratization without
creating and enacting a new constitution, Chen claimed, adding
that it is a "common trend" among emerging democracies.
</P>
<P>
Noting that Taiwan has amended its constitution seven times in
the past 15 years, the president said they were only partial
revisions or slight adjustments to old laws left by an autocratic
regime.
