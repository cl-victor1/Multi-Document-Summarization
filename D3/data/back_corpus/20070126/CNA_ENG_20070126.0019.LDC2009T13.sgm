Seven men suspected of involvement in a Jan. 2 bank heist were
referred by police to the Taipei District Prosecutor's Office
Friday for further interrogation.
</P>
<P>
Two key suspects -- Lee Han-yang, the driver of an armored van
for Group 4 Securicor, a private security company in Taipei, who
allegedly drugged his colleague and made off with NT$56 million
(US$1.7 million) and his younger brother,  Lee Chin-tsan,  an
accomplice in the case who once did business in China's Yunnan
Province -- were repatriated back to Taiwan from China Thursday
in accordance with the Kinmen Agreement signed by the Red Cross
societies from both sides of the Taiwan Strait in 1990.
</P>
<P>
Lee Han-yang, who fled to China after the heist, claimed that he
was the only one who committed the crime, although officers of
the Criminal Investigation Bureau (CIB) said that Lee Chin-tsan
is suspected of masterminding the heist plan.
</P>
<P>
The other five suspects were identified as Chiu Wei-sheng, who
allegedly came to Lee Han-yang's aid after Lee made off the huge
sum of cash; Lin Shih-teh, who allegedly provided a place for Lee
and the other accomplices to hide out after the heist; Liu Chien-
ho and Wu Kun-mu, who allegedly channeled some of the cash into
China via underground money exchange channels; and Lee Hsun-ming,
who knew of the plot beforehand, CIB officers said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, CIB investigators found out that Lee Chin-tsan had
another accomplice in China -- identified as Liu Wen-lung, a
Taiwanese businessman who allegedly traveled to Taiwan before
Jan. 2 to give Lee Han-yang a hand after the heist.
</P>
<P>
The investigators believe that at least NT$10 million of the
stolen money was taken to China via underground money exchange
channels.
