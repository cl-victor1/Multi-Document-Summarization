MOI TO ACT ON LEGISLATION TO BETTER PROTECT CHILDREN FROM ABUSE
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taipei, Jan. 26 (CNA) 01/26/07  12:19:10 (By Sofia Wu)
</P>
<P>
The government will act on legislation to better protect the
country's children from being victims of violent child abusers,
Interior Minister Lee Yi-yang said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Lee made the remarks in the wake of recent reports of several
shocking and horrifying child abuse cases, including the tragic
death of a 6-year-old girl in Mailiao, Yunlin County who was
beaten to death by her step father earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
The spate of brutal, senseless child abuse cases prompted the
opposition Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU) to announce Thursday its
plan to draft amendments to the Criminal Code during the next
legislative session set to open next month to increase penalties
for child abusers, particularly those who murder children.
</P>
<P>
Responding to the TSU's plan, Lee said consultations with the
Ministry of Justice (MOJ) are needed in drafting any criminal law
revisions, adding that the Ministry of the Interior (MOI) will
coordinate with the MOJ in exploring the feasibility of giving
harsher sentences for those who commit abusive acts that result
in a child's death.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Lee said, the MOI will collaborate with the Ministry
of Education in pushing for legislation of an act on child care
and education to further protect children from abusers.
</P>
<P>
Quoting an MOI study report, Lee said most of the perpetrators in
reported child abuse cases in the past two years were the parents
of the victims. Of the 13 fatalities in child abuse cases
reported in 2006, six were committed by the children's natural
parents; three by their natural parents' live-in lovers; and two
by babysitters or someone entrusted with taking care of the
child.
</P>
<P>
To eradicate child abuse and domestic violence in local society,
Lee said, the MOI has offered systematic counseling services and
special financial subsidies for high-risk families or those that
have experienced domestic violence.
</P>
<P>
Besides offering mental health services, he said, the MOI has
since last summer offered emergency living subsidies for children
from high-risk or disadvantaged families.
</P>
<P>
Noting that child protection requires extensive participation at
the grass-roots level, Lee urged apartment building management
and security personnel, community volunteers and ordinary
citizens to join surveillance and reporting of child abuse and
neglect cases.
</P>
<P>
Lee further said that those who have children under 12 years of
age in the custody of their divorced spouses should not hesitate
to report to the "113" hotline if they discover evidence of abuse
or have a hard time tracking their children's whereabouts.
</P>
<P>
To reduce incidence of babysitters abusing children entrusted to
their care, Lee said the proposed child care and education law
will stipulate that only those who have obtained proper licenses
can engage in babysitting or child care services. Before the law
is enacted,  Lee said,  the MOI will actively  assist unlicensed
babysitters in getting proper certification.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, the TSU legislative caucus held a news conference to
push the government to devote more funds and manpower resources
to child protection and child welfare services.
</P>
<P>
Tseng Tsan-teng, a TSU legislative whip, quoted MOI tallies as
saying that the number of child abuse cases jumped from 6,059 in
2000 to 9,897 in 2005.
</P>
<P>
"The sharp increase during the period indicates  that the
government has not done enough in child protection, " Tseng said,
adding that the upward spiral also underscores the need to
enhance penalties for child abusers.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan now has only 1,071 social workers, far short of demand,
which is estimated at more than 5,000 social workers, Tseng said,
adding that the Mega- Warmth Project unveiled by Premier Su
Tseng-chang late last year has only appropriated NT$10.6 billion
for prevention of domestic violence and child abuse.
</P>
<P>
"All these figures point to the sad fact that both our government
funds and workforce for child protection are less than
sufficient, " he added.
</P>
<P>
In the new legislative session, Tseng said, the TSU will push all
relevant government agencies to set aside funds for establishing
an efficient community online reporting system that will enable
members of the public to report child abuse or domestic violence
cases as soon as they spot evidence or witness one.
</P>
<P>
Wang Mei-en, deputy executive director of the Child Welfare
League, said at the news conference that the government should do
its utmost to increase the number of caseworkers. In Taiwan. each
social worker has to handle an average of 50 domestic violence
cases, compared to less than 25 in the United States and Canada.
</P>
<P>
She also pitched for the establishment of a round-the-clock
"frontline"  service system specializing  in handling emergency
domestic violence or child abuse cases and a "second-line"
service system focusing on mental health or therapeutic parenting
services to prevent child abuse and domestic violence.
