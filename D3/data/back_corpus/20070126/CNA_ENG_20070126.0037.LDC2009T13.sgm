MOJ UNDECIDED OVER PETITION REAFFIRMING PRESIDENT'S IMMUNITY
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taipei,  Jan.  26 (CNA) 01/26/07  20:21:26 (By Y.C. Jou)

<P>
The Ministry of Justice (MOJ) was still contemplating Friday an
instruction from Premier Su Tseng-chang issued two days earlier
to file a petition with the Council of Grand Justices for a
constitutional interpretation aimed at reaffirming the
president's immunity from prosecution.
</P>
<P>
"My colleagues in the ministry are continuing their research, "
Minister of Justice Morley Shih said while answering press
queries as to whether the ministry is an eligible petitioner and
whether it will make the legal move. On Wednesday he had
indicated that his ministry may only give legal advice to the
Executive Yuan and let the latter decide whether to push forward
the case.
</P>
<P>
Doubts were raised in an MOJ internal meeting Thursday over the
ministry's eligibility for filing the petition, which concerns
the "special state affairs fund" case in which President Chen
Shui-bian is involved. The media reported that most officials
attending the meeting opposed the idea of the MOJ filing the
petition. Shih later denied the report.
</P>
<P>
Su said Wednesday that the prosecution's practice in probing the
case was inconsistent with an MOJ internal resolution dating back
to 1996 that says that as criminal investigations into the
actions of an incumbent head of state are unable to proceed
during his term in office, such cases should be shelved until the
president leaves office.
</P>
<P>
He therefore asked the ministry to petition for an interpretation
of Article 52 of the Constitution -- which stipulates criminal
immunity for the president -- in order to sort out contradictions
in prosecutorial practices. The MOJ oversees general
prosecutorial affairs.
</P>
<P>
According to Article 5 of the Constitutional Interpretation
Procedure Act, a government agency can petition for a
constitutional interpretation  when  it has doubts  over  the
meaning  of a constitutional provision or the constitutionality
of a law or regulation while carrying out its functions or
duties.
</P>
<P>
Opponents  of an MOJ petition  said,  however,  that  the
investigation or trial of the state affairs fund case is not the
ministry's function and duty and thus the ministry has no legal
grounds for filing a petition.
</P>
<P>
Both Prosecutor Chen Jui-jen, who indicted the first lady and
three close aides to the president for corruption and forgery,
and Prosecutor Chang Hsi-huai, who now represents the prosecution
in the case's court proceedings, told the media Thursday about
their objections to a MOJ petition.
</P>
<P>
Chen said the existence of several co-offenders in the case
related to the president merited an investigation and that the
president himself was not among those indicted. Therefore, he
said, his practice did not contradict the 1996 MOJ resolution.
Chang said the MOJ should not "pull the rug out from under" the
prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
The Council of Grand Justices rejected that day a petition filed
by 84 ruling party lawmakers for an interpretation of Article 52
of the Constitution, saying that the legal conditions required
for initiating a constitutional review were not met. That same
day, the Presidential Office filed another petition over the same
article. If filed, the case now being studied by the MOJ would
become the third in the "special state affairs fund" controversy.
