President Chen Shui-bian expressed his concern Thursday about a
recent South Korean move to punch the words "China Taiwan" on the
nationality column of the passports of Taiwan students doing
research in South Korea.
</P>
<P>
Chen said Taiwan is Taiwan which is unrelated to China. South
Korea's move would mislead the world into believe that Taiwan is
part of the People's Republic of China.
</P>
<P>
"We hope South Korea can correct this grave mistake as soon as
possible," Chen said.
</P>
<P>
Chen made the remarks while meeting with former South Korean
President Kim Young Sam who is in Taipei to attend a meeting
advocating the formation of a global forum on emerging democracy.
