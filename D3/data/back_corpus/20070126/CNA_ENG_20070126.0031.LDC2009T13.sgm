OFFICIAL

Taipei,  Jan.  26  (CNA) 01/26/07  19:14:42 (By Luis Huang)

<P>
The appointment of domestic business leaders as diplomatic
allies' honorary consuls or consuls-general to Taiwan has nothing
to do with the president, Huang Jung-kuo, deputy director-general
of the Protocol Department under the Ministry of Foreign Affairs
(MOFA) said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Huang said name lists of consuls or consuls-general submitted by
Taiwan's diplomatic allies must be strictly reviewed by the
Foreign Ministry in accordance with relevant regulations before
both the minister of foreign relations and the director-general
of protocol sign their names in credentials.
</P>
<P>
Huang made the remarks after opposition Kuomintang Legislator
Lien Chiang-fu said several financial scandal-ridden
entrepreneurs who maintain good relations with President Chen
Shui-bian have fled Taiwan to foreign countries because of their
appointment as consuls or consuls-general.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a news conference held at the Legislative Yuan, Lien
pointed out that among Taiwan's current 24 diplomatic allies, 13
have appointed a total of 16 consuls or consuls-general while two
non-diplomatic allies have also made such appointments.
</P>
<P>
Lien further said several of the Taiwanese entrepreneurs assuming
such posts have been implicated in financial scandals. For
example, he went on, former U.S.-based Omni Bank Vice Chairman
Chin Shih-ying, who served as honorary consul-general of the
Solomon Islands and St. Kitts and Nevis, fled to the United
States due to her implication in the snowballing Rebar Group
financial scandal.
</P>
<P>
Chin fled to the U.S. with her husband Wang You-theng, founder of
the Rebar Group, before two Rebar subsidiary companies applied
for insolvency protection late last year. They have been placed
on Taiwan's most-wanted list and stand accused of embezzlement,
insider trading, fraud and breach of trust.
</P>
<P>
Noting that many domestic entrepreneurs who have been appointed
consuls or consuls-general are also members of "the National
Cultural Association headed by Chen Shui-bian", Lien said that if
necessary, they can be granted privilege to escape from the
country.
</P>
<P>
In response, Huang, who was also present at the news conference,
said that such appointments "have no relation to presidential
power", adding that the Solomon government has revoked Chin's
appointment.
</P>
<P>
Although Chin still serves as consul-general of Saint Kitts and
Nevis, she neither holds a passport issued by that Caribbean
nation nor enjoys any diplomatic privilege, Huang said.
