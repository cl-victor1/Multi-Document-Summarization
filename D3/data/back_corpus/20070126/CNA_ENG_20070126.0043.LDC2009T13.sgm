PRESIDENT PROPOSES MAKING U.N. BID UNDER THE NAME 'TAIWAN'

President Chen Shui-bian said Friday that pushing for Taiwan's
entry into the United Nations under the name of "Taiwan" neither
violates his "four noes" commitment nor involves a change in the
nation's official title.
</P>
<P>
Chen made the remarks at the "Towards a Global Forum on New
Democracies" event. Also present at the discussion were former
presidents from El Salvador, South Korea, Mongolia, Poland and
South Africa.
</P>
<P>
Since around 40 percent of U.N. member states are represented
under titles that differ from their respective official titles,
the nation can seek to promote its U.N. bid under the name of
"Taiwan," said Chen.
</P>
<P>
Chen explained that seeking to gain U.N. membership under the
name of "Taiwan" will not only enjoy the support of 70 percent to
80 percent of Taiwan's people but also sidestep the unification
versus independence debate.
</P>
<P>
Saying that Resolution No.  2758--adopted by the U.N.  in 1971--
only resolved the issue regarding China's U.N. representation not
the representation of the 23 million people of Taiwan, the
president stressed that joining the U.N. is not only Taiwan's
obligation but it is also the country's right.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan has used the title "the Republic of China" in its U.N.
bids for the past 13 years and all attempts at gaining entry have
failed due to the intervention and opposition of Beijing.
</P>
<P>
In his 2000 and 2004 inaugural speeches, Chen promised that if
China displayed no intention of using force against Taiwan, he
would not declare independence, change nation's  name,  include
the "two-state  theory"  regarding  cross-strait relations  in
the Constitution, nor hold an "independence vs. unification"
referendum on Taiwan's future.
