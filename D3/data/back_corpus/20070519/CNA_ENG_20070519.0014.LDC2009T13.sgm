KMT LEGISLATIVE CAUCUS HAS SECOND THOUGHTS ON CONTROVERSIAL BILLS
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,   May  19  (CNA) 05/19/07  15:32:19 (By Sofia Wu)

<P>
The legislative caucus of the main opposition Kuomintang (KMT)
will study the feasibility of overturning two controversial bills
that the caucus itself initiated and pushed for passage last
week, party sources said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
According to the sources, KMT Secretary-General Wu Den-yi,
himself a legislator, ordered the formation of a seven-member
task force to study the issue Friday after a heated debate among
caucus members over whether the party should take the initiative
to invalidate two newly passed amendments to the Farmers
Association Law and the Fishermen Association Law that critics
said would pave the way for the "return of black gold politics."
</P>
<P>
The amendments not only cancel three-term limits for secretaries
general of farmers and fishermen associations and lower
requirements for them to renew their employment  but also
stipulate  that association staff standing trial are not to be
relieved of their jobs until a final verdict is delivered in
their cases.
</P>
<P>
Under the existing laws, indicted staff members from farmers and
fishermen associations are to be fired from their posts following
conviction in their second trials for criminal activities.
</P>
<P>
The passage of the two amendment packages with the blessing of
the KMT-led "pan- blue alliance" which controls a slim majority
in the legislature  has drawn criticism  from the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) and many political
commentators as well.
</P>
<P>
The DPP party central and its legislative caucus have thrown
support behind the Executive Yuan's plan to ask the Legislative
Yuan to reconsider the two controversial bills on the grounds
that 95 percent of current secretaries general whose loyalties
traditionally lie with the KMT will be able to dominate the
organizations indefinitely despite the fact that many of them
have criminal records.
</P>
<P>
During Friday's KMT caucus meeting, two members -- Legislators
Hsu Chung-hsiung and Wu Yu-sheng, both of whom maintain close
ties to the party's presidential candidate Ma Ying-jeou -- took
the party authority to task for backing such controversial
amendments to the laws governing farmers and fishermen
associations across the county.
</P>
<P>
The two KMT lawmakers said the passage of the controversial
amendments have tarnished the party's image and could even hurt
Ma's presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
"At a time when the public is fed up with official corruption and
holds high expectations of political integrity, we should not
hesitate to make an about- face in this matter," Hsu said.
</P>
<P>
Wu Yu-sheng echoed Hsu's view, saying that the party should not
break its promise to promote clean politics. "If we fail to
correct our mistakes in this case, the public could lose faith in
our promise and withdraw their support for our candidates  in the
coming legislative and presidential elections," he warned.
</P>
<P>
Hsu said that if the party caucus fails to come up with a
"reconsideration" motion before the May 22 deadline, he will show
up when the legislature deals with the Executive Yuan's request
for reconsideration of the two amendment packages to protest the
KMT central and legislative caucus' "cowardice."
</P>
<P>
However, some caucus members, including Legislator Pai Tien-chih,
who concurrently  serves as managing supervisor of the Taiwan
Provincial Farmers Association, voiced different views, saying
that since other public office holders, from the president down,
are not forced to quit until after being convicted in the third
or final trial, it's unreasonable to demand that farmers and
fishermen association executives step down after being convicted
in the second trial.
</P>
<P>
In response, Secretary-General Wu Den-yi said he will invite
seven lawmakers with differing views to discuss the issue May 21
and make a final decision on the party's stance.
</P>
<P>
Under the current regulations, the Executive Yuan and the
legislative caucuses of various political parties can ask the
legislature to reconsider a controversial bill that has already
cleared the legislature within a specified period of time after
the bill's passage. If the bill is backed by more than half of
the lawmakers in a second vote, it will take effect; otherwise,
it will be invalidated.
</P>
<P>
After Premier-designate Chang Chun-hsiung formally takes the helm
at the Executive Yuan next Monday, he is expected to determine
soon whether to ask the opposition-controlled legislature to
reconsider the two amendment packages.
