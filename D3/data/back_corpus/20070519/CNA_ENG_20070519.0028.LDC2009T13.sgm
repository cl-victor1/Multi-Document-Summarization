IMPROPER TO COMMEMORATE DICTATOR WITH MEMORIAL HALL: PRESIDENT
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  May 19 (CNA) 05/19/07  21:29:18 (By Elizabeth Hsu)

<P>
President Chen Shui-bian blasted the notion of commemorating "a
dictator and executioner" who suppressed human rights with a
memorial hall, referring to the Chiang Kai-shek Memorial Hall,
one of the defining landmarks in Taipei City.
</P>
<P>
"It is an improper memorial, " Chen said Saturday in his address
at a ceremony held at the memorial complex to mark the renaming
of the facility as the "National Taiwan Democracy Memorial Hall."
</P>
<P>
A new plaque was unveiled in the ceremony, which was also
attended by outgoing Premier Su Tseng-chang and other Cabinet
officials.
</P>
<P>
Describing the CKS Memorial Hall as a "family temple" of the late
President Chiang Kai-shek whom he called a dictator, Chen said
the redesignation of the memorial can help remind people of the
many unjust practices during Chiang's authoritarian rule.
</P>
<P>
Chen suggested that people can choose to forgive but should never
forget the authoritarian past of the country.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the opposition of Taipei City government to the name
change out of concerns that the move might damage the protected
historic monument, Chen stressed that changes to protected
heritage sites, like the Presidential Office, are allowed if the
management of the sites agree.
</P>
<P>
Showing pictures of the front door of the Office of the
President, Chen said that as the name of the building -- a first-
degree national historic site -- had been changed from "Chienshou
Hall" in celebration of the late President Chiang's birthday, the
name of the CKS Memorial Hall, which is only a provisionally-
designated heritage site, could also be changed.
</P>
<P>
Chen stated  that he could not agree with the opposition
Kuomintang-controlled city government's attempt to defy the name
change by wielding the Cultural Heritage Preservation Law as part
of its "cover for certain political purposes."
</P>
<P>
Chen said the move to change the name of the CKS hall to the
Taiwan Democracy Memorial Hall represents a farewell to an old
era, as well as the Taiwan people's solid faith in the universal
principles of freedom, democracy and human rights.
</P>
<P>
The president  dedicated the "name rectification"  and the
plaque-unveiling ceremony to all the people who sacrificed their
lives for Taiwan's democratic movement. ENDTIEM/Li
