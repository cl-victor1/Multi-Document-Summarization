NTU PRESENTS COMPACT DISCS WITH 150GB-200GB STORAGE CAPACITY

Researchers at National Taiwan University (NTU) have made a
breakthrough in optical storage technology that can boost the
capacity of a single compact disc to 150 gigabytes to 200
gigabytes, university officials reported during a press
conference Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The press conference is part of the "12-University  Joint
Presentation" conducted by the Ministry of Education to present
the research results of top local universities and institutes.
Thursday's presentation was attended by NTU and National Cheng-
kung University, while the other 10 universities will have their
own press conferences in the coming days.

The new CDs, using nano-class super-resolution optical near-
field structure (Super-RENS) , can record data with a write-in
interval as small as 90 nanometers, compared to an 800nm interval
of the conventional CD and 400nm of the digital versatile disc,
said Tsai Din-ping, a professor at NTU's Department of Physics.

<P>
"It is the key to much greater capacity, " said Tsai. "A CD with
Super-RENS can easily beat hundreds of CDs or tens of DVDs in
terms of data stored."
</P>
<P>
A CD usually has a capacity of 650 megabytes to 700 megabytes,
while a mass- production DVD can provide 4.7GB to 17GB storage
capacity. The DVDs with up to 27GB capacity has just been
developed recently.
</P>
<P>
Tsai noted that even though Taiwan is the biggest production base
for CDs and DVDs, local manufacturers have not earned as much as
expected in years of operation due to huge amount of royalty paid
to CD/DVD patent holders. "But NTU's technology might make
change, " he added.
