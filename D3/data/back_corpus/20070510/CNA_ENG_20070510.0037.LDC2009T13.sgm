ENFORCEMENT RULES LEGITIMIZES COMPENSATIONS TO EGG, SPERM DONORS
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  May  10 (CNA) 05/10/07  21:22:55 (By Deborah Kuo)

<P>
Four sub-statutes to the newly-enacted Artificial Reproductive
Act are expected to be finalized by the Department of Health
(DOH) in June to pave the way for the implementation of the act,
a medical source said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The sub-statutes outlaw commercial trading of reproductive cells,
but allow "nutritional compensations, " said Lee Mao-sheng,
former chairman of the Taiwan Association of Obstetrics and
Gynecology and one of the authors of the sub- statutes.
</P>
<P>
The sub-statutes, if approved by the Executive Yuan in June, will
provide a legal basis for the establishment of commercial banks
of human eggs and sperm, according to Lee.
</P>
<P>
They would allow egg donors to receive nutritional compensation,
ranging from NT$50,000 to NT$100,000, given that egg donation
takes about two months to complete and donors suffer unavoidable
physical hardship and inconvenience, Lee said.
</P>
<P>
A sperm donor could ask for nutritional compensation ranging from
NT$4,000 to NT$8,000, Lee said.
</P>
<P>
The Artificial Reproduction Act stipulates that after making one
successful donation resulting in the birth of a child, an egg
donor is prohibited from making further donations for the rest of
her life.
</P>
<P>
After a birth, left over donated eggs or sperm from an in vitro
procedure should be destroyed, the act stipulates.
</P>
<P>
Egg or sperm donors are prohibited from appointing recipients,
thereby automatically disallowing siblings from providing eggs or
sperm for one another's reproductive ends.
</P>
<P>
The age of donors is restricted to 20-50 for men and 20-40 for
women because medical research has found that the egg fertility
rate of women over 40 is six times less than those harvested when
they are 20, according to the act.
</P>
<P>
According to the DOH, there are only about 300 cases of egg or
sperm donations a year in Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
The country's first test tube baby is now 20 years old, according
to DOH statistics, and in total 20,000-odd children have been
conceived through artificial means in Taiwan. Of these, about 10
percent were conceived using donated eggs or sperm.
</P>
<P>
According to Lee, the sub-statutes also demand the establishment
of an investigative mechanism to look into egg and sperm donors'
family trees, to prevent relatives from unwittingly donating eggs
or sperm to one another.
