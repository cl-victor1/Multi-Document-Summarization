Taipei,  May 10 (CNA) 05/10/07  19:52:33 (By Ruth Wang)

April revenue of the Taiwan High Speed Rail Corp. (THSR) reached
NT$1.1 billion (US$33 million) , the first time the THSR has made
more than NT$1 billion in revenues in a single month, according
to a report submitted by the company to the Ministry of
Transportation and Communications (MOTC).
</P>
<P>
The report showed that the THSR's monthly revenue increased by an
average amount ranging between NT$100 million and NT$200 million
since it started operations Jan. 5, with NT$598 million of
revenue in January, NT$670 million in February and NT$870 million
in March.
</P>
<P>
MOTC's High Speed Rail Bureau Director-general Pang Chia-lin said
that while the revenue of April was higher than that of March, a
lower passenger load factor of 51.87 percent in April compared to
55.82 percent in March was reported due to an increase of trains
in late March and a slower growth rate in the number of
passengers.
</P>
<P>
The THSR needs to increase its passenger load factor in May
before another increase of trains takes place June 1, Pang said,
adding that the THSR also needs to provide a more convenient
ticket system including online booking.
