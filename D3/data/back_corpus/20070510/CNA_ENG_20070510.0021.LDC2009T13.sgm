<P>
A large haul of suspected ivory was seized by aviation police at
the Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Police found the suspected ivory in the check-in luggage of a 52
-year-old man.
</P>
<P>
The man admitted that he bought it more than a decade ago when
the government had yet to promulgate the Wildlife Conservation
Law. As a friend in Beijing was interested in purchasing it, he
had planned to deliver it in person, he claimed.
</P>
<P>
The pair of suspected tusks had been cut into four pieces of
about 100 cm with a total weigh of around 60 kg, which would make
it the largest ivory haul in years if proved genuine.
</P>
<P>
Customs officials pointed out that exports and imports of any
items listed under the Convention  on International  Trade in
Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora require permits, but
the man was unable to produce any documents or papers.
</P>
<P>
Aviation police said they turned the material over to the
authorities for further examination and if it is proved to be
genuine, the man will be prosecuted.
