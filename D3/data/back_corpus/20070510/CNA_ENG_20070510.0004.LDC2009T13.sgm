ATJ PROTESTS U.N.'S REFUSAL OF PRESS CARDS FOR WHA COVERAGE
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  May 9 (CNA) 05/10/07  11:03:11 (By Luis Huang)

The Association of Taiwan Journalists (ATJ) issued a declaration
Wednesday, protesting the United Nations' refusal to issue press
cards to Taiwanese reporters wishing to cover an upcoming annual
meeting of the World Health Assembly (WHA) , the decision-making
arm of the World Health Organization (WHO).
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Secretariat's move not only violates Article XIX of the
world body's Universal Declaration of Human Rights governing
freedom of speech and press freedom, but has also shown that the
U.N. is a basically  "hypocritical" organization,  the ATJ said
in its declaration.
</P>
<P>
Noting that Taiwan's 31 media organizations have lodged a joint
protest to the United Nations and the World Health Organization
(WHO) against blocking them from covering the WHA conference, the
ATJ said journalists should be viewed as independent individuals,
and that their rights to cover the event should not be ignored
due to political disputes.
</P>
<P>
The ATJ said it will drum up support of the world's 140-odd
journalistic organizations, such as the International Federation
of Journalists (IFJ) and Reporters sans Frontieres, for its
protest against the U.N. and the WHO, and that during the IFJ
annual meeting slated for late May in Moscow the association will
come up with a motion asking for the IFJ's help to protect
Taiwanese reporters' right to cover the WHA.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the ATJ will launch a nationwide campaign calling
for all citizens of Taiwan to write letters to U.N. Secretary-
General Ban Ki-moon to protest the international organization's
ignorance of the 23 million Taiwanese people's health and right
to "know the truth." The campaign will run through Sept. 18 when
an annual meeting of the U.N. General Assembly opens.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. has banned Taiwan's reporters from covering the annual
WHA meeting held in May in Geneva by refusing to issue press
cards to Taiwanese reporters since 2004.
