Opposition Kuomintang (KMT) presidential nominee Ma Ying-jeou
officially invited Legislative Yuan speaker Wang Jin-pyng
Wednesday to become his running mate for the 2008 election.
</P>
<P>
Wang, however, did not accept the invitation immediately and said
he needs to think over the matter carefully.
</P>
<P>
Wang told reporters that he will make a decision before the KMT's
national congress, slated for June 24.
</P>
<P>
The KMT's Central Standing Committee named Ma as the party's
candidate for the 2008 presidential election May 2. The
nomination is expected to pass the upcoming national congress in
formality.
</P>
<P>
Extending  the invitation  during dinner at Wang's  Taipei
residence, Ma said he has been targeting Wang to be his running
mate since March but that he did not bring up the issue to Wang
because he wanted to wait for his nomination by the party.
</P>
<P>
Wang said in deciding on whether to accept the offer, he needs to
evaluate his own abilities and consider if the combination is
helpful to boosting the party's chance of victory.
</P>
<P>
Wang suggested that Ma try to expand his search for potential
running mates to the academic and business sectors.
</P>
<P>
Wang said he will have a second meeting with Ma before announcing
his decision, with honorary KMT Chairman Lien Chan and KMT
Chairman Wu Poh-hsiung to be invited to participate in the
discussion.
