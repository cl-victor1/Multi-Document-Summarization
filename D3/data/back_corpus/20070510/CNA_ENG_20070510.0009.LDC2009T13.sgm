PRESIDENT TO HOLD SATELLITE VIDEO NEWS CONFERENCE FOR WHO BID
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Geneva,  May  9 (CNA) 05/10/07  14:00:07 (By Neil Lu and Sofia
Wu)
</P>
<P>
President Chen Shui-bian will hold an international news
conference via satellite video Friday to tell the world why
Taiwan wants to become a member of the World Health Organization
(WHO) , Taiwan officials stationed in Geneva said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
To enhance the efficacy of the video conference, the officials
said the event will be conducted in the form of a news
conference, with President Chen taking questions from reporters
in Taipei and Geneva and actively interacting with them.
Moreover, they added, simultaneous interpretation will be
available throughout the whole event.
</P>
<P>
Chen had held many rounds of international videoconferences for
Taiwan's WHO bid. In the past, the videoconferences all proceeded
in the form of a seminar without simultaneous interpretation
services.
</P>
<P>
"This time around, President Chen will only deliver brief opening
remarks while focusing on interaction with reporters from around
the world, " a Geneva-based Government Information Office (GIO)
official said.
</P>
<P>
According to the official, the news conference to be broadcast
live via satellite will start at 4: 30 p.m. May 11 (Taipei time)
at two locations -- the Presidential Office in Taipei and the
Bristol Hotel in Geneva. Invitations have been sent to all media
outlets in Geneva, the official said, adding that foreign
correspondents in Taipei have also been invited to join the
event.
</P>
<P>
The annual  World  Health  Assembly  (WHA)  --  the WHO's
decision-making arm -- is set to open next Monday at the United
Nations office in Geneva. The WHA opening session is expected to
deal with issues regarding Taiwan's application for WHO
membership under the name of "Taiwan."
</P>
<P>
Since 1997, Taiwan has sought to become a WHA observer, but the
bid has invariably been dashed by China's obstruction. This year
marks the first time that Taiwan has applied for full WHO
membership. Without any fundamental changes in the international
situation over the past year, prospects for Taiwan's new WHO bid
remain bleak.
</P>
<P>
But Taiwan's public and private sectors have not been daunted by
the tough challenges that may lie ahead and have continued going
all out to seek the maximum possible international support for
its goal and to upgrade its international profile and visibility.
</P>
<P>
Wu Shu-min, president of the Foundation of Medical Professionals
Alliance in Taiwan, will travel to Geneva to serve as moderator
at the video conference.
</P>
<P>
Sources said a Taiwanese married couple who came down with the
sometimes deadly severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) four
years ago will appear at the Geneva news conference to highlight
the need for Taiwan to be included in the global epidemic
prevention network.
</P>
<P>
Taiwanese ultramarathoner Lin Yi-chieh,  who made headlines
earlier this year by completing a three-month crossing of the
Sahara Desert, will also be present at the Geneva video
conference.
</P>
<P>
Although the WHO Secretariat has rejected Taiwan's membership
application conveyed in a letter from President Chen to WHO
Director-General Margaret Chan on the basis that Taiwan is not
qualified for a WHO seat due to its lack of statehood and U.N.
membership, more than 10 of Taiwan's diplomatic allies have
written to Chan asking her to deal with the case prudently and
put it onto the WHA agenda.
</P>
<P>
It has been learned that on the opening day, the WHA General
Committee  will discuss whether to include Taiwan's membership
application on the WHA agenda as proposed by Taiwan's allies.
Major WHO member countries reportedly are mediating with relevant
parties in the hopes of preventing political disputes between the
two sides of the Taiwan Strait from impeding the annual WHA
conference's proceedings.
