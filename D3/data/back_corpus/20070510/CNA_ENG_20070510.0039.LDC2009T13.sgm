BUDGET BILL DELAY SETS TAIWAN'S DEMOCRACY BACK: EX-PRESIDENT
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taipei,  May  10 (CNA) 05/10/07  21:50:33 (By Flor Wang)
</P>
<P>
Taiwan's democracy is bogged down, as evidenced in that the 2007
central government budget bill has been stonewalled for more than
five months in the Legislative Yuan, former President Lee Teng-
hui said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Lee made the comments while extending moral support to a group of
sit-in protesters  led by lawmakers of the opposition  Taiwan
Solidarity Union (TSU) who have been demonstrating since May 3
before the Legislative Yuan over the failure of the critical
bill.
</P>
<P>
Calling the bill's impasse an irony to Taiwan's democratization
that began more than a decade ago when he served as head of
state, Lee said that the serious stalemate by lawmakers in
approving such a key bill marks a setback in Taiwan's democracy.
</P>
<P>
The lawmakers' dereliction of duty to review bills has made the
legislature's existence "meaningless," he said.
</P>
<P>
Lee asked Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng to call a
meeting with legislative caucus whips of both ruling and
opposition parties for negotiations on the passage of the bill by
the end of this month.
</P>
<P>
Lawmakers of the main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) and the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) clashed and exchanged blows
Tuesday in the Procedure Committee meeting over two key bills --
the 2007 central government budget bill and a bill regarding the
formation of the Central Election Commission (CEC).
</P>
<P>
The "pan-blue alliance" led by the KMT insists that the budget
bill must not pass the Legislative Yuan before the draft CEC
Organic Law has been settled among the various parties, while the
DPP-led "pan-green camp" wants the budget bill addressed first.
