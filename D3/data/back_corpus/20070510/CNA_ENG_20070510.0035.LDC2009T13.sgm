American Institute in Taiwan (AIT) Taipei Office Director Stephen
M. Young said Thursday that the United States has long been
supportive of Taiwan's participation in various international
activities  and its bid for observer status of international
organizations, including the World Health Organization (WHO).
</P>
<P>
Under this principle,  the U.S.  has maintained  long-term
cooperation ties with Taiwan, Young said during an interview with
reporters after signing an agreement with Taichung Mayor Jason Hu
on a bookmobile cooperation project. He added that Hu, a former
foreign minister, understands the U.S. government's stance.
</P>
<P>
Young made the remarks  amid media reports that the U.S.
government has refused to receive a mission led by Joanne J.L.
Chang, deputy secretary-general of the National Security Council,
who was sent by the government to lobby for U.S. support for the
country's effort to apply for WHO membership under the name of
"Taiwan."
</P>
<P>
For his part, Hu said the U.S. has a deep understanding of
Taiwan's aspiration to join the WHO and has always extended a
helping hand to the country in this regard, adding that Young's
remarks imply that whether to lobby for U.S. support or not is of
no importance.
</P>
<P>
According to the reports, the U.S. government rejected the
mission on the grounds that there are already normalized channels
of communication between the two sides and therefore no need for
discussions via other channels.
