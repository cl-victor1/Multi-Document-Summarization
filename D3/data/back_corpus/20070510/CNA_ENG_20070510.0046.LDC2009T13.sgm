Taiwan's venerable Buddhist Master Cheng Yen was awarded the 24th
Niwano Peace Prize Thursday for her lifelong dedication to
humanitarian relief, charity, medical service and public
education.
</P>
<P>
Cheng Yen, founder of the Buddhist Compassion Relief Tzu Chi
Foundation which has emerged as Taiwan's largest charity after 41
years of development,  is the first Taiwanese to receive the
prestigious Niwano Peace Prize since the Niwano Peace Foundation
established the award in 1983.

<P>
Tzu Chi Foundation spokesman Ho Jih-sheng received the trophy on
behalf of Cheng Yen in a grand ceremony held at the Tokyo office
of the Foreign Correspondents' Club of Japan.

<P>
Ho said Cheng Yen takes great pride and joy in receiving the
award. "She regards it as a great honor and a recognition of the
work in Taiwan and around the globe of the large army of Tzu Chi
volunteers," Ho said.
</P>
<P>
As Cheng Yen has never traveled abroad, she aksed Ho to receive
the award on her behalf. According to Ho, Cheng Yen has decided
to donate the 20 million yen (US$167,000) in prize money to the
Tzu Chi Foundation for various charity programs. Thursday also
happened to be Cheng Yen's 70th birthday.

Many Japanese religious leaders and foreign representatives were
present at the presentation ceremony presided over by Nichiko
Niwano, president of the Niwano Peace Foundation. A large group
of media professionals covered the event.

<P>
The venerable nun founded Tzu Chi in 1966, with "instructing the
rich and saving the poor" as its motto in carrying out four great
missions -- in the areas of charity, medicine, education and
culture. Under Cheng Yen's leadership, the Tzu Chi Foundation has
been involved in international disaster relief, bone marrow
donation, environmental protection and community volunteerism.

<P>
Cheng Yen was previously awarded the Eisenhower Medallion for her
contribution to world peace and was once nominated for the Nobel
Peace Prize.

<P>
The Niwano Peace Foundation was established by the Japanese lay-
Buddhist organization Rissho Kosei-kai in 1978 to contribute to
the realization of world peace and the enhancement of a culture
of peace. It began to present an annual Niwano Peace Prize in
1983. To date, 24 individuals and groups of the Catholic,
Christian, Islamic, Jewish and Buddhist faiths from more than 10
countries have received the prize.
