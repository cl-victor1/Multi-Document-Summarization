DPP ADOPTS EXCLUSIVE POLLING FORMAT FOR LAWMAKER PRIMARY
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  April 4 (CNA) 04/04/07  21:30:22 (By Y.C. Jou)

<P>
The ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) adopted Wednesday a
polling format designed to exclude voters at the other half of
the political spectrum from its primary poll for district-elected
legislators.
</P>
<P>
The polling reform program initiated by the DPP's Acting Chairman
Trong R. Chai was slightly modified before passing the party's
Central Standing Committee.
</P>
<P>
The DPP's primary system takes into account both telephone polls
involving general citizens and voting by party members. Chai's
original proposal suggested that the questionnaire first ask the
surveyed about their party inclinations.
</P>
<P>
To that question, those answering that they share political
beliefs with the DPP, Taiwan Solidarity Union or pan-green camp
will be included, while those identifying with the Kuomintang,
People First Party, New Party or the pan-blue camp will not,
according to DPP sources.
</P>
<P>
Chai suggested that those who identify with no any political
party in the first question be asked the second question: "Would
you consider supporting the DPP's representative if he or she is
a good candidate? "and that those who answer in the affirmative
will be included.
</P>
<P>
During the committee meeting, Kaohsiung County Magistrate Yang
Chiu-hsing said that those who choose to identify with "others"
in the first question should have a second chance to have their
opinions included.
</P>
<P>
According to sources that attended the meeting, committee members
reached a consensus and agreed on the change after the party's
Public Opinion Survey Center Director Chang Yu-feng said Yang's
proposal would result in the inclusion of less than another one
percent of interviewees in the district-elected primary poll.
</P>
<P>
A similar format for the DPP's presidential primary poll, aiming
at excluding 30 percent of voters, was also confirmed by the
committee after it passed the party's Central Executive Committee
a week earlier.
