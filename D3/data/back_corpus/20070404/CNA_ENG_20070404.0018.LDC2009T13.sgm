TAIWAN SCHOOLCHILDREN NOT EATING ENOUGH VEGGIES: CANCER
FOUNDATION

Most schoolchildren in Taiwan do not eat sufficient amounts of
fruits and vegetables for lunch, the Formosa Cancer Foundation
(FCF) said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
While the Department of Health suggests that children should eat
at least three servings of vegetables and two servings of fruit
per day, an FCF survey conducted in March found that 70 percent
of elementary schools provide only 0.5 servings or less of
vegetables in their prepared lunches for students.
</P>
<P>
Worse still, the survey found, 75 percent of students at these
elementary schools do not eat the full portion of vegetables
served to them, said Lai Chi- ming, executive director of the
FCF.
</P>
<P>
The FCF conducted the poll from March 1-16, interviewing teachers
and nutritionists from 301 elementary schools randomly chosen
around the island.
</P>
<P>
The poll found that less than 10 percent of the surveyed schools
provide their students with fruit in every lunch meal, while
nearly 70 percent of the schools provide fruit in only one or two
lunch meals per week.
</P>
<P>
The poll also found that many schoolchildren seldom finish the
school lunches served to them, with the reasons mentioned
including "not having time to eat fruit," "the lunches are not
tasty," and "the servings are too large."
</P>
<P>
About half of the students at the surveyed schools were found to
have grown fond of packed lunches sold outside the school,
according to Lai.
</P>
<P>
Lai attributed this to the fact that boxed lunches sold by
vendors or restaurants outside the school are higher in fat
content and usually very spicy, which he said students find
attractive.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 60 percent of the teachers at the surveyed schools said
they think that most students make unhealthy choices for lunch,
which Lai said could be one of the reasons behind the growing
obesity problem among schoolchildren.
