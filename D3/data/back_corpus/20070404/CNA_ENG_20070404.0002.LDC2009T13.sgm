GIO HEAD'S DEPARTURE USELESS IN CLARIFYING TTV CONTROVERSY: PFP

Taipei,  April  3 (CNA) 04/04/07  10:40:10 (By Flor Wang)

The resignation of Cheng Wen-tsang as Government Information
Office (GIO) minister cannot help clarify his role in a
controversy regarding the sale of shares in Taiwan Television
Enterprise (TTV), opposition lawmakers claimed Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Lee Hung-chun, spokesman for the opposition People First Party
(PFP) , made the comments after Premier Su Tseng-chang approved
Cheng's resignation. Lee voiced the PFP's doubts as to why the
Executive Yuan failed to quickly punish Cheng after the
contentious case was brought to light late last month.
</P>
<P>
Sumio Hasegawa, a representative of Japan's Fuji TV network,
accused Cheng, in a news conference held March 25, of trying to
persuade him to sell the TTV shares that his company held to the
local Liberty Times during a Jan. 17 dinner banquet in Taipei.
Minister of Economic Affairs Steven R. L. Chen and Liberty Times
executives were also present in the gathering, he said.
</P>
<P>
Sumio expressed his surprise that a Taiwanese government official
could meddle in such a commercial  matter  and said Cheng's
interference would be called a "scandal" if this were to occur in
Japan.
</P>
<P>
Arguing that Cheng's voluntary resignation did not clarify nor
bring an end to the matter, Lee demanded that Cheng provide a
full explanation of why he feted a person involved in the
proposed sale at the banquet.
</P>
<P>
Despite Su's approval of Cheng's resignation earlier in the same
day, Lee said, it remains difficult to explain the controversial
case to the public. He also accused Su of being forced to dismiss
Cheng out of mounting public pressure.
</P>
<P>
Should the Executive Yuan fail to clear up the matter, the PFP
will thoroughly oppose the release of government-owned TTV
shares, Lee said.
</P>
<P>
Hsu Shao-ping, legislative caucus whip of the main opposition
Kuomintang (KMT), and KMT Legislator Joanna C. Lei, insisted that
Su remove Cheng and that the government halt its planned release
of TTV shares until all suspicious aspects of the case have been
clarified.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on Su's approval of Cheng's departure, Hsu said that
such a development was expected by the KMT's legislative caucus,
but they questioned why Minister Chen has not also been
disciplined.
</P>
<P>
Although Cheng has to assume most of the fault for the case, Hsu
said that Minister Chen also must assume responsibility for his
share of the wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
Hsu concluded that the party will wait and weigh its next move as
a group of KMT legislative caucus members have filed suit against
Su and Cheng for neglect of duty, and the party wants to see what
punishment Su will mete out to Chen.
