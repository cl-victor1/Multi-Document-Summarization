Former Premier Frank Hsieh helped market locally-produced, so-
called "betel nut coffee" in the southern city of Kaohsiung
Wednesday as a means of promoting interactions between coffee
traders and local growers.
</P>
<P>
Hsieh said during a promotional event for the agricultural
product from Neiwuan, Pingtung County in southern Taiwan, that he
volunteered to serve as a spokesman for "betel nut coffee" last
month during a visit to Neiwuan, where he drank the local coffee
for the first time, and learned that the coffee is grown under
betel nut trees -- a method of cultivation consistent with the
idea of "co- existence" in nature.
</P>
<P>
Given that the coffee, named because it is grown under betel nut
trees, is as sweet as the popular Kukeng Coffee from Yulin
County, Hsieh said he wishes to attract more local coffee lovers
to buy the Neiwuan product to help increase income of betel nut
farmers in the township.
</P>
<P>
In Taiwan, there are tens of thousands of people producing and
trading betel nut, Hsieh said, noting that as the government no
longer encourages betel nut production after the tropical trees
were found to be the prime culprit responsible for frequent
landslides on the island, so growers are not entitled to any
governmental assistant programs.
</P>
<P>
Due to financial concerns, some of the farmers began to grow
coffee under their betel nut trees. "Now they are all happy to
produce high-quality coffee, " said the former premier who is
running to become the ruling Democratic Progressive Party's
candidate in the 2008 presidential election.
</P>
<P>
Saying that Taiwan imports NT$1.7 billion (US$51 million) worth
of coffee on average each year, Hsieh said that if one-third of
that coffee came from local sources it would bring an additional
NT$600 million in annual revenue.
</P>
<P>
Coffee plantations cover more than 217 hectares of land in
southern Taiwan, generating an annual revenue of some NT$8.59
million.
