The family members of each of the eight military officers killed
in a helicopter crash in the southern county of Kaohsiung Tuesday
will receive around NT$15 million (US$452,900) as compensation
for the death of their loved ones, the defense minister said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Lee Jye informed the bereaved of the compensation while extending
his condolences to them at the Kaohsiung Military General
Hospital where the bodies have been sent. He also promised to
ground all UH-1H helicopters until thorough safety checks are
conducted.

<P>
A UH-1H helicopter hit a transmission tower in the mountainous
region of the county Tuesday afternoon, killing all eight elite
members of an Army airborne cavalry brigade on board. Lee
admitted that the helicopter was old and poorly equipped, but he
also suggested that bad weather may have been probably the cause
of the accident.
</P>
<P>
Lee said that it is difficult to pilot the UH-1H helicopter in
conditions of low visibility because the chopper is not equipped
with an automatic pilot system.
