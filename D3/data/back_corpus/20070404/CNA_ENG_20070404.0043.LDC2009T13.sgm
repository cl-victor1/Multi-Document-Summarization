The Kaohsiung office of the Taiwan External Trade Development
Council (TAITRA) plans to invite more Japanese banana importers
to Taiwan as a part of efforts to promote local banana exports,
TAITRA officials said Wednesday.

Japan is one of the major overseas  markets for Taiwan's
agricultural products, the officials said, adding that bananas
are particularly welcomed by Japanese.

The Kaohsiung office has invited several Japanese companies to
visit Taiwanese banana plantations in early February and
organized a meeting for them to increase bilateral understandings
and mutual trust, the officials noted.

Having received positive responses from Japanese companies, the
TAITRA plans to organize more meetings to further promote
Taiwan's bananas, the officials said.

In 2006, the export value of Taiwan's fruits was greater than
US$34.3 million, the officials said, adding that the Japanese
market accounted for the half of that total.
