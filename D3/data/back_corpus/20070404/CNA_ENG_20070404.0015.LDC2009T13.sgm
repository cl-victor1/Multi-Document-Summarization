Premier Su Tseng-chang praised the country's new representative
to the United States, Joseph Wu, for his devotion to and
abilities in handling international and Chinese affairs, saying
he believes that Wu will be able to convey the Taiwan people's
will swiftly and precisely to the U.S. government and people.
</P>
<P>
Su praised Wu as a seasoned technocrat with commendable cultural
literacy who has been a deputy chief of staff to President Chen
Shui-bian and the head of Taiwan's top cross-strait policy-
planning body.
</P>
<P>
The premier said that China has been the main obstacle in the
development of Taiwan' foreign relations. As chairman of the
Mainland Affairs Council, Su said, Wu has performed exceptionally
well in the face of Beijing's suppression and containment schemes
against Taiwan on the political, diplomatic and military fronts.
</P>
<P>
Wu should be lauded for his efforts in safeguarding Taiwan's
overall interests, faithfully reflecting the Taiwan people's
will, pushing for cross-strait negotiations, and laying the
country's cross-strait economic and trade policies, as well as
helping stabilize the cross-strait situation, Su said.
</P>
<P>
Wu is scheduled to arrive in Washington, D.C. April 14 to assume
his new post.
