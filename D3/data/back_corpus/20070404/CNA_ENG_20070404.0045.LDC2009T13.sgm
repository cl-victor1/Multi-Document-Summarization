Former Premier Frank Hsieh departed for the United States
Wednesday evening to attend his mother's funeral.

Sources close to Hsieh said Hsieh's mother died at his brother's
home in Los Angeles at the age of 87. According to the sources,
Hsieh's family will arrange a simple funeral for his mother in
line with her wishes.

Hsieh's mother was known to be a modest, self-effacing woman who
raised five children on limited family resources. Thanks to her
wisdom and tenacity, Hsieh once recalled, she had managed to
provide a warm and stable environment in which her children grew
up healthy, receiving good educations.

President Chen Shui-bian has issued a posthumous commendation in
honor of Hsieh's mother.

Hsieh, a human rights lawyer-turned politician who once served as
premier, lawmaker and mayor of the southern port city of
Kaohsiung, is currently competing for the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party's nomination to run in the 2008 presidential
election.
