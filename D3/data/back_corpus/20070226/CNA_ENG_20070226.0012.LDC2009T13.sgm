Taipei,  Feb.  26 (CNA) 02/26/07  17:01:03 (By Elizabeth Hsu)

Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng claimed Monday that it is
only possible for the opposition Kuomintang (KMT) to take power
if "pan-blue alliance" candidates in the year-end Legislative
Yuan elections win overwhelmingly.
</P>
<P>
Wang made the remarks while visiting a temple in Banciao City,
Taipei County, accompanied by Taipei County Magistrate Chou Hsi-
wei and several legislators of the "pan-blue alliance" of the KMT
and the People First Party.
</P>
<P>
Wang claimed to be unconcerned about the problem of how the KMT
selects its candidate for the 2008 presidential election, and
said he was thinking more about how to assist KMT candidates
running for seats in the Legislative Yuan.
</P>
<P>
The first thing to do is campaign for the "pan-blue" candidates
to win legislative seats, said the KMT heavyweight who is widely
seen as a potential candidate in the 2008 presidential election.
</P>
<P>
In reply to media inquiries about Chou's proposal for the KMT to
decide its candidates running for the presidency and vice
presidency based on the results of party polls, Wang said that a
common consensus reached by KMT Honorary Chairman Lien Chan,
former Chairman Ma Ying-jeou and himself has paved the way for
the integration of the "pan blue alliance" while all three agree
that the most important thing is a "pan-blue" legislative
victory.
</P>
<P>
He refused to answer the question of when he will announce his
bid for the presidency.
