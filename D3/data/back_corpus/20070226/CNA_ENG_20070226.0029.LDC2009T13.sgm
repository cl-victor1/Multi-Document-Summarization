DPP LAWMAKER URGES ESTABLISHMENT OF 'WHITE TERROR' TRUTH
COMMISSION
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  Feb. 26 (CNA) 02/26/07  21:05:30 (By Lilian Wu)
</P>
<P>
One incumbent and one former legislator of the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) called Monday for the establishment of a
"white terror" truth investigative commission.
</P>
<P>
DPP Legislator Shen Fa-huei and former Legislator Duan Yi-kang
made the appeal during a press conference as the 6oth anniversary
of the 228 Incident draws near.
</P>
<P>
The incident refers to an uprising against the corrupt Kuomintang
administration under the late President Chiang Kai-shek that
began Feb. 28, 1947 and was followed by a bloody crackdown that
resulted in the deaths of tens of thousands of civilians.
</P>
<P>
The ensuing "White Terror" -- involving the suppression of
political dissents and of public discussion of the massacre --
was conducted under martial law declared following the incident;
the martial period only ended in 1987.
</P>
<P>
During the White Terror, around 140,000 Taiwanese were imprisoned
or executed for their real or perceived opposition to the
Kuomintang government led by Chiang Kai-shek, according to a
report by the Executive Yuan. Some prosecuted Taiwanese were
labeled by the Kuomintang as "bandit spies", meaning spies for
Chinese communists, and punished as such. The "White Terror" left
many native Taiwanese with a deep-seated bitterness towards the
Kuomintang, Chiang Kai-shek, and sometimes mainlanders.
</P>
<P>
Shen and Duan said that according to statistics published by a
foundation dealing with compensation for the "bandit spy" cases
during the martial law years, some 8,488 applications have been
filed with the foundation as of Feb. 9.
</P>
<P>
The number of those who were compensated for totaled 6,341, among
whom 58 percent of are of Taiwanese origin and 43 percent are
mainlanders.
</P>
<P>
Judging from the figures, Shen said the gap of Taiwanese and
mainlander victims is not significant.
</P>
<P>
Those responsible for the imposition of suffering were a few led
by the late Chiang, although blame was shifted to the mainlanders
as a whole.
</P>
<P>
The duo spoke positively of Wu Nai-teh, a researcher of Academia
Sinica, the highest research institute in Taiwan, who is
promoting a private version of a "Truth &amp; Reconciliation
Commission, " but urged the government to take the lead in
forming a "white terror" commission to investigate the truth so
as to uphold the "transitional justice" advocated by the DPP.
