MND OFFICIAL WEBSITE WILL REMAIN UNCHANGED, CARRYING NO 'TAIWAN'

Taipei,  March  15 (CNA) 03/15/07  20:47:10 (By Deborah Kuo)

A Ministry of National Defense (MND) spokesman denied Thursday
that the ministry had decided to change its official website to
include "Taiwan" in the ministry's official title.
</P>
<P>
Wu Chi-fang said it was an accidental mistake that the ministry's
official title -- "the Republic of China Ministry of National
Defense" -- had been changed to "the Republic of China (Taiwan)
Ministry of National Defense" by a private company authorized to
design a new MND website.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the MND has not planned to change its official title
by including "Taiwan" in the new website, Wu said the ministry
has already notified the designing  company to resume use of the
ministry's official title, which does not contain "Taiwan."
</P>
<P>
Wu suggested that the company might have unwittingly made the
unwanted inclusion because all Cabinet-level agencies, except for
the MND and Veterans Affairs Commission,  have changed the titles
displayed on their official websites to include "Taiwan."
</P>
<P>
Wu said the designing company made the inclusion without first
consulting with the MND in belief that it would be only natural
that the MND's official title also contain "Taiwan" as so many
other Cabinet agencies now do.
