The Fair Trade Commission (FTC) under the Executive Yuan signed a
Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) on cooperation with the Unfair
Competition Regulatory Authority of Mongolia Thursday to boost
technological and personnel exchanges.
</P>
<P>
An FTC spokesman said Taiwan has more complete fair trade laws
thanks to their long establishment, so it is well-placed to offer
assistance to other countries in this regard.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan will offer technical aid and training in fair trade law to
Mongolia, according to the terms of the MOU, which it is hoped
will strengthen bilateral relations, the spokesman said.
