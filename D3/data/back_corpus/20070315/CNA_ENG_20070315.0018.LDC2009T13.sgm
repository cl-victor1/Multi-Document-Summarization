TAISUGAR TO CUT NUMBER OF PIGS BY 10 PERCENT

Taipei, March 15 (CNA) 03/15/07  15:11:14 (By Lilian Wu)

<P>
State-owned Taiwan Sugar Corp. (Taisugar) announced Thursday that
it will cut the number of its pigs by 10 percent to 380,000 from
the current 420,000.
</P>
<P>
Taisugar, Taiwan's largest pig producer, made the decision
against the backdrop of the recent plunge in pork prices.
</P>
<P>
Taisugar officials noted that pork prices dipped after the
Chinese New Year in 2006 and that they had hoped in vain that
prices would rebound by around the time of the Dragon Boat
Festival, which fell on May 30 last year.
</P>
<P>
Pork prices did rebound before this Chinese New Year, which fell
on Feb. 18, before slumping again, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
They noted that Taisugar pork products have established a good
reputation and that if the price drop is moderate, the company
will not be affected.
</P>
<P>
However, with the recent surge in the price of feed for pigs
coupled with the more than 30 percent decline in the price of
pork, Taisugar has no choice but to reduce the number of its pigs
to cut losses, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
They expressed the hope that domestic pig farmers will follow
suit to help prop up pork prices.
