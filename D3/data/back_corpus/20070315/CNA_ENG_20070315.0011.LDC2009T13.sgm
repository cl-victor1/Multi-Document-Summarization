BRITISH EXPERT RATES TAIWAN AS WELL-PREPARED TO FIGHT FLU
PANDEMIC
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  March 15 (CNA) 03/15/07  15:00:53 (By Sofia Wu)

<P>
Taiwan has been rated as well-prepared to fight a potential flu
pandemic that may be caused by the highly pathogenic H5N1 avian
influenza virus, National Science Council Chairman Chen Chien-jen
said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Chen, an epidemiologist-turned-technocrat who concurrently serves
as convener of a supraministerial flu prevention task force, made
the remarks after presiding over a review meeting a day earlier
on various precautionary measures.
</P>
<P>
According to Chen, the Cabinet-level Department of Health (DOH)
invited Dr. Richard Coker, a noted British bird flu expert who is
also an adviser to the World Health Organization (WHO) , to
Taipei earlier this month to evaluate Taiwan's flu prevention
mechanism and strategies.
</P>
<P>
"We get a score of 70 points, higher than the median score of 57
among the 28 countries around the world that Coker has reviewed
and assessed," Chen said.
</P>
<P>
Among the assorted measures that Taiwan has adopted to prevent an
invasion of bird flu virus is setting up nets around all pig and
poultry farms islandwide to prevent wild birds from passing the
flu virus to hogs and poultry, Chen said, adding that nets will
have been set up at nearly 85 percent of all the farms by the end
of this month.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Chen said feces samples collected from throngs of
great cormorants converging on the outlying island ahead of their
return to the north after having wintered in Taiwan were found
not to contain the H5N1 virus, indicating that Taiwan remains an
H5N1-free area.
</P>
<P>
In terms of an evaluation by local health authorities of Taiwan's
preparedness against a possible flu pandemic based on WHO-set
criteria, Taiwan gets a score of 80 to 85 points, Chen said,
adding that Taiwan needs to further study how many volunteers and
retirees can be recruited in the event of a flu pandemic and
whether government funds will be needed in post-pandemic
rehabilitation.
</P>
<P>
Shih Wen-yi, deputy director of the DOH's Center for Disease
Control, said a large-scale flu pandemic control drill will be
held in the middle of this year, with the participation of public
health agencies, private corporations and farming households, to
test various response measures and strategies.
</P>
<P>
To date, the virulent H5N1 remains primarily a bird disease with
only limited bird-to-human transmission. But medical experts do
not rule out the possibility of the virus mutating into a new
strain that could possibly lead to a pandemic among humans.
</P>
<P>
Against this backdrop, the government has stockpiled 2.3 million
doses of Tamiflu capsules and powder -- an amount sufficient for
10 percent of Taiwan's population, a level suggested by the WHO
-- provided that a H5N1-triggered flu pandemic breaks out.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the National Health Research Institute (NHRI) has been
carrying out a bird flu vaccine development project since August
2005 and has collected H5N1 culture samples from patients in
Vietnam for the development of flu vaccine.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 2006,  NHRI researchers  had completed the
preparation of the H5N1 vaccine and found in experiments on small
animals that the NHRI-developed H5N1 vaccine can effectively
induce protective antibodies.
</P>
<P>
According to the NHRI's bird flu vaccine research program, the
top goal for 2007 is filing for approval for clinical tests on
humans in the last quarter of the year and launching clinical
tests on humans in 2008.
