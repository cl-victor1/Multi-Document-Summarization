<P>
Nearly 80 percent of the country's schoolchildren feel happy,
according to the results of an opinion poll conducted by monthly
magazine Happiness Republic.
</P>
<P>
The poll of Grade 3 to Grade 6 students in 44 elementary schools
around Taiwan found that 79.9 percent of the respondents said
they feel happy. A total of 2,269 valid samples were collected in
the survey.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless,  the poll found,  only 76.1 percent  of the
respondents said they are happy to go to school -- a figure that
was 88.8 percent in a similar poll by the magazine in 2005 -- and
the lowest of its kind in seven years since the magazine first
launched the poll in 2001.
</P>
<P>
A total of 62.4 percent of the respondents said they are happier
this year than last year.
</P>
<P>
Reasons cited by the schoolchildren for their happiness included
"having a warm family" and "parents taking them out for fun."
Only 9.8 percent cited "not having to worry about food or
clothing" as a factor contributing to their happiness, the poll
found.
</P>
<P>
By comparison, 6.7 percent of the respondents expressed obvious
unhappiness about themselves and their lives.
</P>
<P>
Among this group, nearly 60 percent cited a heavy school workload
as a source of unhappiness, followed by those who cited
punishment by their parents and financial difficulties in their
homes as reasons for their unhappiness.
</P>
<P>
The poll also found that the issue of "ethnic conflict" bothered
some schoolchildren. Chai Sung-lin, a psychiatrist and
sociologist who was formerly a national policy adviser to
President Chen Shui-bian, said it sends out an alarming message,
as one-fourth of the respondents who said they "suffered from
ethnic problems" were children of foreign women married to
Taiwanese men.
</P>
<P>
By region, northern Taiwan showed the highest percentage of happy
schoolchildren, while those in central, southern and eastern
parts of the country were less happy than their northern
counterparts.
</P>
<P>
The relatively unhappy respondents cited their families' economic
conditions, heavy school workload and tense mother-child
relations, in that order, as reasons for their unhappiness, the
poll found.
