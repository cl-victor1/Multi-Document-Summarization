PREMIER VOWS TO QUIT PRESIDENTIAL RACE IF INDICTED ON GRAFT
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taipei,  March 15 (CNA) 03/15/07  12:48:36 (By Sofia Wu)
</P>
<P>
Premier Su Tseng-chang has said he would quit the 2008
presidential race if he were to be indicted over alleged misuse
of the special allowance fund set aside for his discretionary use
during his tenure as a local government head.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on a TV talk show Wednesday, Su said he faithfully
followed the rules and laws in handling his special allowance
fund while serving as Taipei and Pingtung county magistrate.
</P>
<P>
"I did not misappropriate the special allowance funds, let alone
line my own pockets with public funds, " Su said, adding that he
is confident that he can withstand stringent investigations.
</P>
<P>
Su is vying with three other ruling Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) heavyweights -- Vice President Annette Lu, DPP Chairman Yu
Shyi-kun and former Premier Frank Hsieh -- for the party's
nomination to run in the 2008 presidential election.
</P>
<P>
During their appearance on the same TV programs earlier this
month, both Yu and Hsieh promised to pull out of the race if they
were to be indicted on charges of embezzling funds from the
special allowance during their stints in various government
posts. Su said he would follow the same rules of the game if he
were to be indicted.
</P>
<P>
Asked whether his remarks in a recent interview  with an
international media outlet that the DPP will field only one
candidate or a single ticket for the 2008 presidential/vice
presidential election means that the top two contenders in the
opinion polls will pair up to form the DPP's presidential ticket,
Su said that mediation is an integral part of the DPP's
nomination mechanism.
</P>
<P>
He also said that President Chen Shui-bian has stepped in to
mediate a solution but that the four contenders have yet to come
to terms on technical details to be applied in the mediation
process.
</P>
<P>
"Therefore, it remains unclear who will emerge as our party's
presidential candidate, " Su said, adding that he keenly hopes
the president's mediation will yield an outcome acceptable to all
those involved.
</P>
<P>
Su also took advantage of the occasion to clarify that he has
never proposed a revisionist policy line for the DPP. "The so-
called 'Su's revisionist policy line' is non-existent. It's a
sheer rumor that I intend to revise or dump our party's platform.
President Chen has thrown his weight behind my stance," he
explained.
</P>
<P>
Su's political rivals have accused him of attempting to drop the
DPP's independence-leaning policy line in an effort to woo swing
voters or moderate supporters of the pro-unification opposition
"pan-blue alliance" to boost his presidential bid.
</P>
<P>
As one of the DPP's founding members, Su said his attachment to
the party and his faith in the party's ultimate goals are beyond
doubt.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Presidential Office sources said President Chen's
involvement in mediating on the issue of selecting the DPP's
presidential ticket is solely aimed at avoiding a split in the
party to facilitate its victory in the election.
</P>
<P>
With party unity and cohesion as the mediation goal, the sources
said, the president has no preset stance or preferences in the
process. The president is unlikely to talk about a Su-Hsieh
pairing or a Hsieh-Su ticket at the moment since the mediation
process has just begun, the sources added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the DPP's Central Standing Committee decided at its
weekly meeting Wednesday to organize forums for the party's four
presidential aspirants to expound on their political convictions
and debate various policy options.
</P>
<P>
DPP Secretary-General Lin Chia-lung said he will invite the four
contenders to discuss relevant technical details, including how
many rounds of the forum should be conducted and what format
should be adopted. The first such coordination meeting is
scheduled for March 19, he added.
</P>
<P>
According to party sources, the four bigwigs have yet to reach a
consensus on whether the policy forum should be complemented by a
vote by party members or opinion polls exclusively on party
members or opinion polls on randomly chosen members of the public
before entering mediation  by the president  in selecting the
final presidential candidate.
