<P>
Taipei City will represent Taiwan in a bid to host the 2013 East
Asian Games, Taipei city government officials said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The remarks came after the Cabinet-level National Council on
Physical Fitness and Sports (NCPFS) approved the capital city's
application to launch the bid.
</P>
<P>
Taipei Mayor Hau Lung-bin said that his city government will
mobilize all of its resources to ensure the success of the bid.
</P>
<P>
Taipei city was the only city in Taiwan to file an application,
and the council spoke highly of the northern city's facilities
and environment, said Wu Ching- chi, the head of the city's
Department of Education.
</P>
<P>
Liang Yong-fei, director of Taipei Sports Office, explained that
the East Asian Games take place every four years,  with the
participation of China, Hong Kong, Japan, South Korea, Mongolia,
North Korea, Macao, and Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong will serve as the host for the event in 2009, Liang
said, adding that Taipei city might face a contender from China.
</P>
<P>
Noting that Taipei city will host the 2009 Deaflympics, Liang
said the sports facilities for that event could also be used for
the 2013 East Asian Games.
</P>
<P>
If the facilities were insufficient, the capital city would
collaborate with other cities or counties to address the
shortfall, according to Liang.
