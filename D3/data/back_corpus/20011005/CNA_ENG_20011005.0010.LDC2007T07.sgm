Taipei,  Oct.  5  (CNA) (By Deborah Kuo)
</P>
<P>
Taiwan will not be absent from the  international fruits and
vegetables exposition to be held in mainland China next month,
Legislator Lin Feng-hsi from the ruling Democratic Progressive Party
said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Actually, Lin will lead a 100-strong Taiwan delegation of farmers,
traders and food processors to the international fruits and vegetables
expo scheduled to be held Oct. 11-14 in Xiamen, Fujian Province.
</P>
<P>
Lin said the international expo, co-sponsored by UNESCAP (the United
Nations Economic and Social Council in Asian-Pacific), will serve as a
bridgehead for Taiwan-produced fruits and vegetables at a time when
Taiwan products will soon face fiercer competition when the island
accedes to the World Trade Organization (WTO).
</P>
<P>
Under the banner of "Subtropics, Taiwan Fresh," Taiwan-produced fruits
and vegetables will be displayed in 50 booths at the four-day expo, in
which more than 1,000 companies from 22 countries as well as the host
mainland China will take part, Lin noted.
</P>
<P>
He added that the expo provides a golden opportunity for Taiwan in its
self-promotion efforts under the globally-fair trading environment
provided by the WTO program.
</P>
<P>
It is hoped that Taiwan's delicious fresh fruits and vegetables will
become world-brand products enjoying fame equal to that of salmon from
Norway, tulips from the Netherlands and kiwi fruit from New Zealand,
Lin said.
