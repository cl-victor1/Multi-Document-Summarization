Taiwan's first national Bike Day will kick off Saturday across
the country, and the Cabinet-level National Council on Physical
Fitness and Sports announced Thursday that the first Saturday of
May will be the day to mark the activity in the future.

<P>
According to council chief Yang Chung-ho, Saturday's Bike Day
will be observed in 25 cities and counties around Taiwan. In
Taipei County, two carnivals with large numbers of cyclists will
be held to add fanfare to the day.

<P>
The sports chief also called on the public to ride bicycles to
maintain health and lose weight. A regime of a 50-minute ride per
day five days a week will help build health, he recommended.

Compared with many other developed countries, Taiwan still lags
in the popularity of cycling, council officials said, adding that
at present, only Taipei, Taichung and Pingtung counties have laid
out comprehensive bike paths, which total more than 500 km.
</P>
<P>
Amid a growing  love for cycling,  each of the remaining
administrative regions across the country are expected to build
their own cycling paths within a year that will link up to create
a trail of at least 1,000 km, the officials said.
