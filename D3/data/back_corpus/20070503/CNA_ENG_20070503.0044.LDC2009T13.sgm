AIT HEAD AGAIN CALLS FOR PASSAGE OF APPROPRIATE DEFENSE BUDGET
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  May 3 (CNA) 05/03/07  21:15:57 (By Chris Wang)

<P>
American Institute in Taiwan (AIT) Taipei Office Director Stephen
Young Thursday again called for the passage of an appropriate
defense budget for arms procurement to help Taiwan shore up its
national defenses against China's military buildup.
</P>
<P>
In his second press conference in six months, Young, who recently
returned from Washington for consultations, also made clear that
the U.S. has "no favorites" in Taiwan's 2008 presidential
election and "will cooperate with whoever elected, like we did in
2000."
</P>
<P>
In a press conference last October, Young sent one of the
strongest and clearest messages the AIT has publicly expressed in
years urging Taiwan's legislature to pass the defense budget and
various arms procurement packages. His statement drew criticism
within Taiwan's politically polarized climate.
</P>
<P>
Young said he has spoken with leaders of the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) and the opposition, and received promises
to push for the passage of the bill.
</P>
<P>
"Yet there's been no action," he said, adding that the U.S. would
speak out "humbly, respectfully and clearly" when it felt that
either side of the Taiwan Strait is unilaterally changing the
status quo and threatening stability in the Strait.
</P>
<P>
One of the toughest questions he had to answer, Young said,
during his consultation with officials in the Pentagon, White
House, State Department and Capitol Hill, was "Why hasn't Taiwan
passed an appropriate  defense budget which provides for funding
of the defensive system President [George] Bush offered six years
ago?"
</P>
<P>
The latest  explanation  from Taiwan centered  around  the
controversial issue of Central Election Committee, but that still
could not explain why the Legislative Yuan hasn't taken any
action in moving the bill, Young said.
</P>
<P>
He went on to denounce a false local report which claimed that
the U.S. government approved the use of long range offensive
missiles in the Han Kwang exercise.
</P>
<P>
Quoting U.S. National Security Council senior Asian Director
Dennis Wilder, Young said the U.S. does not encourage the
development of offensive weapons on either side of the Strait.
</P>
<P>
Ask about the absence of any mention of the cross-strait issue in
the just- concluded security dialogue between the U.S. and Japan,
Young said it was not the first time that the issue was not
mentioned in the meeting, but the U.S. maintains a longstanding
and consistent policy on the cross-strait issue.
