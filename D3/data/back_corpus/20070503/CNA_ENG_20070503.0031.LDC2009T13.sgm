EX-KMT HEAD WANTS MEETING WITH LEGISLATIVE SPEAKER OVER
PRESIDENCY
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taipei,  May 3 (CNA) 05/03/07  18:29:27 (By Flor Wang)
</P>
<P>
Main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) former Chairman Ma Ying-jeou
said Thursday that he needs to meet with Legislative Yuan Speaker
Wang Jin-pyng next week to discuss creating a ticket for the 2008
presidential election.
</P>
<P>
Ma made the remarks while answering questions from reporters
prior to an exclusive interview with the TVBS cable television
channel.
</P>
<P>
According to Ma, he must meet Wang in the coming days now that
the KMT has nominated him as its candidate for the next
presidential race. Ma won the KMT's nomination a day earlier in
the weekly meeting of its decision-making Central Standing
Committee.
</P>
<P>
He had promised to arrange a meeting with Wang for talks over
forming a presidential ticket as soon as he was nominated, Ma
noted, calling for an early settlement of the matter.
</P>
<P>
Ma stepped down from KMT chairmanship Feb. 13 after being
indicted by Taipei prosecutors over allegedly embezzling some
NT$11 million in funds from a monthly municipal allowance
designated for his discretionary use during his two terms as
mayor of Taipei from 1998-2006.
</P>
<P>
Ma immediately proclaimed his desire to pursue the presidency
following his indictment.
</P>
<P>
Speaking during the TVBS interview, Ma maintained his innocence
and said that he is fully entitled to run in the presidential
polls in accordance with the law, which only bans citizens
convicted at a third and final trial from doing so.
</P>
<P>
Ma argued that he did not commit a crime, defended his name and
expressed confidence in Taiwan's judiciary, saying that "the
people have their own judgment" and pointing out that his public
approval ratings in turn rose by 10 percent after the
embezzlement charges against him.
</P>
<P>
As for a KMT plan to modify its charter restricting party members
convicted at the first trial from seeking the presidency, Ma said
that the plan is to "counteract the ruling Democratic Progressive
Party's (DPP) election tactics."
</P>
<P>
In response to accusations from outside the party that the KMT
will have its moral image eroded if it implements the rule
change, Ma said that the issue is open for party delegates to
discuss in the June 24 national party congress. "Any proposed
revision to the party's regulations must be approved by the party
congress," he noted.
</P>
<P>
Ma also voiced confidence in his chances of outgunning his would-
be DPP opponent in the coming presidential election, given his
character, his morals, his integrity and his performance while
serving as mayor of Taipei.
