A just-concluded security dialogue between the United States and
Japan is consistent with Taiwan's national interests, although
cross-Taiwan Strait issues were not highlighted during the talks,
a Ministry of Foreign Affairs official said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
MOFA spokesman Wang Chien-yeh noted that the joint statement
released at the conclusion  of the May 1 U.S.-Japan Security
Consultative Committee meeting indicates that peace, stability
and prosperity in East Asia remain common concerns of the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was coherent in spirit with the committee's 2005
meeting,  Wang said,  adding  that  the  public  should  not
"over-interpret" the absence of any mention of cross-strait
issues in the meeting.
</P>
<P>
"Encourage the peaceful resolution of issues concerning the
Taiwan Strait through dialogue" was outlined by the United States
and Japan as one of their common strategic objectives during the
2005 meeting. The two countries reconfirmed their commitment to
the 2005 common strategic objectives during this year's meeting,
without repeating them.
</P>
<P>
According to the joint statement, the United States and Japan are
committed to promoting fundamental values such as basic human
rights, democracy and rule of law in the international community.
</P>
<P>
In one of the common strategic objectives identified in the
statement, the two countries recognize the importance of China's
contributions to regional and global security and encourage China
to conduct itself as a responsible international stakeholder,
improve transparency in its military affairs and maintain
consistency between its stated policies and its actions.
