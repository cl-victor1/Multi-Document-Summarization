Taipei,  May 3 (CNA) 05/03/07  18:03:46 (By Y.F. Low)

<P>
President Chen Shui-bian urged the public Thursday to promote the
designation of May 15 as national Child Safety Day to mark the
15th anniversary of a tragic tour bus fire that killed 20
kindergarten children.
</P>
<P>
"We must not only learn a lesson from the accident and prevent
the occurrence of more tragedies, but also keep in mind that
child safety is a responsibility shared by everyone, " Chen said
in the latest issue of his online newsletter, responding to a
proposal by the Jing Chuan Child Safety Foundation.
</P>
<P>
The foundation was set up by relatives of the accident victims
and was named after a teacher, Lin Jing-chuan, who also died in
the May 15, 1995 accident as she attempted to rescue the
children. In addition to the 20 children and Lin, two parents
were also killed.
</P>
<P>
As well as promoting the designation of May 15 Child Safety Day,
the foundation invited the public to contribute pieces of cloth
from April 4-30 to be pieced together to make quilts for
traumatized children.
</P>
<P>
Chen said he contributed a piece of light green cloth, on which
he wrote "embrace happiness, be in company with peace and joy, "
as soon as he received the invitation a week ago.
