TAIWAN'S PRESS FREEDOM RANKS FIRST IN ASIA: REPORT
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  May 2 (CNA) 05/03/07  11:45:32 (By T.C. Jiang)
</P>
<P>
Taiwan's press freedom ranks first in Asia, the nation's best
ever record, officials from the Cabinet-level Government
Information Office (GIO) said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The remarks came after Freedom House recently released an annual
report on press freedom in 195 countries and areas in the world.
</P>
<P>
This year,  Taiwan surpassed Japan for the first time to
outperform all other Asian countries, GIO officials noted.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan is in 33rd place in the world, up two notches from last
year, the officials said, adding that Taiwan is deemed to be a
"free" country on an equal scale with Finland, Germany, and the
United States.
</P>
<P>
In contrast, China ranks 181st in the world, down four notches
from last year, the officials pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Quoting the report, the officials said that China, Laos, and
Vietnam are listed as "not free" countries due to the exercise of
national or political control over the media.
</P>
<P>
The report also shows that press freedom in China is not
improving, but worsening, the officials went on.
</P>
<P>
Freedom House scored the countries on the level of judicial
independence, political rights, and economic deregulation. The
report indicates a trend that the global press freedom is on the
decline, the officials explained.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan rose from last year's 35th place to 33rd place this year,
far ahead of Japan (39th place), South Korea (66th place), Hong
Kong (66th place), and Singapore (154th place), the officials
pointed out.
</P>
<P>
The report says that Taiwan has an independent judicial system, a
free economy, and the most free media environment in East Asia,
the officials stated.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Taiwan's constitution explicitly protects freedom of
speech and freedom of the press, the report notes, adding that
the government also respects the exercise of free rights, the
officials said.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan has over 360 private newspapers, 169 radio stations, and
around 100 cable TV channels, indicating that the government has
little influence over the media, the report says.
</P>
<P>
Freedom House was founded by Eleanor Roosevelt, wife of U.S.
President Franklin D.  Roosevelt,  in 1941.  The non-partisan,
non-profit organization has published its press freedom report
every year since 1980.
