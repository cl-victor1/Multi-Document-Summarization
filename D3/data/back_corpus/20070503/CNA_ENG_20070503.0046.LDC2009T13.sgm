<P>
The first case of German measles in Taiwan this year has been
confirmed to involve a recent immigrant from Vietnam, the
Department of Health (DOH) reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The patient is a 25-year-old Vietnamese woman, the wife of a
Taiwanese man, who returned to Vietnam for a visit between Feb.
21 and March 9 this year.
</P>
<P>
According to officials from the DOH's Center for Disease Control
(CDC), the patient developed a fever, cough, fatigue, sore
throat, headache and red spots all over her skin around March 23.
The hospital where she checked in for examination reported the
case to the CDC March 27.
</P>
<P>
Based on German measles' incubation period -- 14-21 days -- CDC
officials believe that she was infected during her most recent
visit to Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
CDC officials urged new immigrants to Taiwan, particularly those
from China and Southeast Asian countries, to receive free German
measles vaccination at local health offices to prevent them from
contracting the disease.
</P>
<P>
CDC officials also called for people who are planning to marry
foreign nationals to ensure that prior to their marriage, or
pregnancy if the wife is foreign- born, that their spouse has
received a measles vaccine as German measles can seriously affect
infants born to women who are infected soon after becoming
pregnant.
</P>
<P>
According to Lin Ting, deputy director-general of the CDC, Taiwan
reported no cases of German measles between 1994 and 2000. Three
cases were reported in 2001, all involving new immigrants.
