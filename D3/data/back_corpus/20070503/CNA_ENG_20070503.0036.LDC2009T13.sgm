TSU STARTS SIT-IN TO PUSH FOR EARLY PASSAGE OF 2007 BUDGET PLAN

Taipei,  May 3 (CNA) 05/03/07  19:54:59 (By Luis Huang)

The opposition Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU) started a relay sit-
in in front of the Legislative Yuan Thursday to push for early
passage of the central government's 2007 budget plan, which
should have been passed by the Legislative Yuan during its
previous session.
</P>
<P>
TSU Chairman Huang Kun-hui, who led all party lawmakers and
members of the TSU Central Executive Committee in the sit-in,
said that under the nation's Budget Law, the Executive Yuan's
budget plan for 2007 should have cleared the legislature Nov. 31,
2006.
</P>
<P>
However, the budget has been delayed for more than five months
due to incessant bickering between the ruling and opposition
parties, marking the first time in the nation's history of
democratic development that the central government's budget bill
has failed to clear the legislature before the beginning of the
fiscal year, Huang pointed out.
</P>
<P>
The five-month delay has triggered a decline in Taiwan's economic
growth rate by 0.64 percent, Huang claimed, adding that this has
not only hindered  the implementation  of several  major
national development projects but has also made it impossible for
the central government to subsidize cash-strapped local
governments to carry out various grassroots construction
projects.
</P>
<P>
The budget plan for 2007 failed to pass in the legislative
session that ended Jan. 19 due to incessant partisan bickering
over an opposition Kuomintang (KMT) -drafted amendment bill on
the organization of the Central Election Commission (CEC) ,
according to which CEC members would be recommended by political
parties in proportion to the number of their legislative seats.
</P>
<P>
The KMT legislative caucus insisted that the draft amendment to
the CEC Organic Law should be dealt with ahead of the central
government's 2007 budget plan during a proposed extra legislative
session,  while the ruling Democratic Progressive Party caucus
disagreed.
