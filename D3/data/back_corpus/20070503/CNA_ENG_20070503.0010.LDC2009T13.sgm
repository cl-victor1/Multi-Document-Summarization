</HEADLINE>

New  York,   May  2  (CNA) 05/03/07  14:02:08 (By Hwang Jaw-pyng
and Y.F. Low)

<P>
Representatives of major Taiwanese expatriate groups in New York
urged the World Health Organization (WHO) Wednesday to stop
denying Taiwan's right for membership.
</P>
<P>
While calling on WHO members to move to support Taiwan's bid to
join the organization in a joint statement, the representatives
asked China not to suppress  Taiwan's efforts to take part in the
international community, especially non-political agencies such
as the WHO.
</P>
<P>
Andrew Hsia, director of the Taipei Economic and Cultural Office
in New York, said that although Taiwan's bid to enter the WHO has
obtained the support and sympathy of many countries, the country
still has a long way to go to achieve the goal.
</P>
<P>
Hsia stressed that Taiwan is willing to engage in medical
cooperation with both its allies and non-allies to fulfill its
obligation as a member of the international community.
</P>
<P>
According to Hsia, the SARS outbreaks of 2003 showed the urgency
for the WHO to include Taiwan, and China cannot continue to lie
to the international community that there is not any health
problems in Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
The representatives also expressed their approval for Taiwan's
move to apply to become a full member of the WHO under the name
of "Taiwan" this year, after failure of its bid to take part as
an observer  in the World Health Assembly -- the WHO's highest
decision-making body -- over the past 10 years.
</P>
<P>
Lai Hung-tien, representing the New York chapter of the North
American Taiwanese Medical Association, said that while the WHO
bid has seen little progress over the past decade, Taiwan must
continue to uphold its right and dignity to participate in the
WHO.
</P>
<P>
Wang Ai-lan, a member of a Taiwanese Christian group in North
America, invited the people of Taiwan to join a one-letter-per-
person campaign and write to WHO member nations to lobby for the
country's WHO bid.
</P>
<P>
Fang Hsiu-jung, head of the Taiwanese Association of America's
Greater New York Chapter, said the international community should
resist any political interference and allow Taiwan to gain access
to the global disease control and prevention network based on
human rights and humanitarian concerns.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Chang Ching-nan, director of the Culture Center of
Taipei Economic and Cultural Office in New York, called on
Taiwanese expatriates in New York to take part in a May 5 walk
around the rim of Manhattan Island organized by Shorewalkers -- a
non-profit walking and environmental group -- and use the
opportunity to promote Taiwan's bid to join the WHO.
