</HEADLINE>

Taipei, May 3 (CNA) 05/03/07  14:59:39 (By Lilian Wu)
</P>
<P>
Taiwan's film industry has come out of the doldrums over the past
three years, and it is estimated that more than 35 local movies
will be shot and then screened in theaters this year, the acting
Government Information Office (GIO) minister said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
William J. T. Yih made the remarks while giving a report at a
meeting of a Legislative Yuan committee reviewing draft revisions
to the Motion Picture Law.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting,  Legislator Lee Chin-an of the opposition
Kuomintang asked Yi about his views on the local film industry's
prospects.
</P>
<P>
"Taiwan's film industry has shown a strong rebound over the past
three years, with box office revenue registering seven-fold
growth, " he said.
</P>
<P>
The rebound is evidenced by the fact that 35 Taiwan films were
screened in theaters last year, compared with only 13 in 2003, he
added.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan movies grossed NT$86.78 million at the box office last
year, or more than seven times the figure of NT$11.93 million in
2003, Yi said.
</P>
<P>
However, he admitted that "there is ample room for growth for
local movies, " especially when one compares them with foreign
movies which have continued to dominate at Taiwan's theaters in
recent years.
