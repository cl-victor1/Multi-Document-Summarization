Sen. John McCain, a Republican presidential contender from
Arizona, expressed his staunch support for Taiwan Wednesday on
the campaign trail in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
McCain, who fought in the Vietnam War as a U.S. Air Force pilot
and who is known for his anti-communist stance, said the U.S.
administration should pay more attention to the situations in
Asia.
</P>
<P>
Answering questions from Chinese-language media members during a
visit to a southern L.A. community known as "Little Saigon, "
McCain reiterated his support for "free and democratic" Taiwan
and said he firmly opposes China's military buildup.
</P>
<P>
He added that cross-Taiwan Strait issues must be addressed via
peaceful negotiations and that China's intimidation of Taiwan and
its military threats should never be tolerated.
</P>
<P>
McCain's support ratings currently lag behind those of Rudy
Giuliani, another Republican presidential contender vying for the
party's nomination to represent it in the 2008 presidential
election, but his experience  in diplomacy and defense affairs
are his competitive edges over the other contenders.
