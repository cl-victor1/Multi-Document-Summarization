Police smashed a fraud ring Wednesday and arrested 11 of its
members who had swindled over NT$100 million (US$3 million) from
more than 1,000 credulous victims, a spokesman for the Tainan
City Police Bureau said.

The spokesman said that ring leader Fan Cheng-dah and his
accomplices collaborated with several other fraud rings in China
and asked their members to cheat money from people in Taiwan over
the telephone.

<P>
These criminals would use different methods to find their
victims, including disguising themselves as prosecutors or police
officers handling a case, saying that they are doing a market
survey, or claiming that the targeted person has won a
sweepstake.
</P>
<P>
In one of the fraud cases, the ring managed to swindle NT$8.4
million from a victim.
</P>
<P>
According to the spokesman, police officers from the criminal
investigation division in Tainan had kept the fraud ring under
surveillance for almost six months before sweeping up the 11
criminals at different locations in Taichung and Hsinchu areas.
