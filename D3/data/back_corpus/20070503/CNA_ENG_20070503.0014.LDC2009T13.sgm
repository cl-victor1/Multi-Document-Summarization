U.N. URGED TO ALLOW TAIWANESE REPORTERS TO COVER WHA MEETING
</HEADLINE>

Berlin,  May  2 (CNA) 05/03/07  15:46:55 (By Lin Yu-lin and Luis

The Germany-based Society for Threatened Peoples (STP) sent a
letter Wednesday to U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon calling
for the United Nations not to ban Taiwan's reporters from
covering the upcoming annual meeting of the World Health Assembly
(WHA).
</P>
<P>
The letter, signed by STP Chairman Tilman Zuelch, states that the
United Nations should protect the universal value of press
freedom, adding that the organization's having rejected the
issuance of news coverage cards to Taiwanese reporters for three
consecutive years has not only violated a clause governing press
freedom in the world body's Universal Declaration of Human Rights
but has also ignored the right of the 23 million people of Taiwan
to "know the truth."
</P>
<P>
Noting that several international journalistic organizations,
such as Reporters sans Frontieres, the International Federation
of Journalists and the United Nations Correspondents Association,
have expressed their sympathy for Taiwanese reporters, the STP
voiced the hope that the U.N. Secretariat will allow them to
cover the WHA meeting slated for mid-May in Geneva.
</P>
<P>
Founded in Gottingen, Germany in 1970, the STP is the second
largest  human rights  organization  in Europe  after Amnesty
International and has issued declarations in favor of Taiwan's
bid to join the World Health Organization over the past several
years.
