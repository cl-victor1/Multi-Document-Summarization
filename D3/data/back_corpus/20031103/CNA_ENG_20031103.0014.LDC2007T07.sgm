DOH PREDICTS SARS IN 2ND HALF OF YEAR NOT AS SERIOUS AS 1ST HALF

Taipei,  Nov.  3 (CNA) (By Lilian Wu)

<P>
Even if there is a resurgence of severe acute respiratory syndrome
(SARS) in the remainder of the second half of the year, it will not be
as serious as in the first half of the year, an official of the
Department of Health (DOH) predicted Monday.
</P>
<P>
Lin Ting, deputy director-general of the DOH's Center for Disease
Control (CDC), made the remarks when he attended a SARS prevention
campaign activity in Miaoli, northern Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Lin said the CDC has predicted that any resurfacing of SARS at the end
of the year will not be as serious as the outbreaks that began in
March. In addition, most of the public now have experience of fighting
against infection and as long as preventative measures are taken,
there is no reason to fear its comeback.
</P>
<P>
Lin pointed out that the atypical pneumonia is transmitted through
close contact with an infected person, unlike smallpox or influenza,
which are transmitted through saliva.
</P>
<P>
As long as hospitals can isolate patients and medical staff have the
equipment to guard against SARS, the disease can be effectively
contained and there is no need for panic, Lin said.
</P>
<P>
He also said that Taiwan quarantined a total of 160,000 people between
March and June, when the outbreaks were at their peak, which he said
was a tremendous social price to pay.
</P>
<P>
If the disease hits Taiwan again, the authorities will change the
quarantine policy so that those who have close contact with SARS
patients or those who return from SARS-affected regions to Taiwan must
monitor their temperatures at home. If there are no symptoms after 10
days, they will be free to go out in public.
