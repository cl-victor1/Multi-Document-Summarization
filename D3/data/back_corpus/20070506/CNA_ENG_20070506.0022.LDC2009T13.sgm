Taipei,  May 6 (CNA) 05/06/07  20:07:00 (By Deborah Kuo)

<P>
An 80-year-old veteran living in Tainan has been cited as a
"self-reliant mother" Sunday in recognition of his long-term
devotion and care of his wife and son, both of them were genetic
cerebral palsy patients.
</P>
<P>
Ching Tien-chun was the only male among the 23 "self-reliant
mothers" cited by the Taiwan Fund for Children and Families
(TFCF) at a ceremony held in Taipei Sunday.
</P>
<P>
In addition to having carer for his spastic wife since they
married 21 years ago, Ching has also single-handedly brought up
their son, Jui-tze.
</P>
<P>
Ching retired from the military as a coastal guard soldier in
1978 before seeking a job as a theater janitor in Tainan County,
southern Taiwan. He quit that job in 1994 so that he could care
for Jui-tze whole-heartedly, including carrying the son on his
back to the school.
</P>
<P>
Ching took Jui-tze to school and waited for him outside of the
classroom until sundown every day until the boy graduated from
high school.
</P>
<P>
Jui-tze is now a freshman at a foreign language college in
Kaohsiung, while Ching's wife stays at a Tainan nursing home.
</P>
<P>
Upon receiving the TFCF award, Ching said that he built the
family and it's his mission to prop up the home whatever happens.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on a recent news story that a youth in Pingtung with
cerebral palsy was considering euthanasia as a means of
terminating his life, Ching exhorted the youth to strive to
remain alive, saying that "any life is better than no life."
</P>
<P>
The TFCF selected 23 individuals  from among hundreds  of
candidates this year to be cited as "self-reliant mothers" on the
eve of Mother's Day.
</P>
<P>
These candidates were chosen from among thousands of the most
impoverished local families nationwide that receive regular aid
from the non-profit foundation.
