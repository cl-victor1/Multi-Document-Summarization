A total of 23 great mothers selected from 16,000 disadvantaged
families were commended Sunday in a ceremony organized by the
Chinese Fund for Children and Families/Taiwan (CFCF/Taiwan) in
celebration of Mother's Day, which falls on May 13 this year.
</P>
<P>
Those mothers were selected from families sponsored by the
CFCF/Taiwan, a spokesman for the charity organization said.
</P>
<P>
Among the winners is an 80-year-old veteran from the southern
county of Tainan, Ching Tien-chun, who has done a good job in
long-term care for his wife and son, both of whom are cerebral
palsy patients.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said most of the mothers honored are from single
parent families, including four foreign spouses of local
citizens, four mentally or physically challenged mothers, and
three aboriginal women.
</P>
<P>
All of these mothers have not only assumed most of the family
financial burden but have also taken care of family members with
serious illness, and yet remain optimistic, the spokesman said.
