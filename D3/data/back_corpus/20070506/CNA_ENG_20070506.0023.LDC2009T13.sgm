A community library in the Panamanian township of La Conga,
constructed using donations from the Republic of China (ROC)
government, was formally inaugurated Saturday to upgrade
Panamanian school children's educational quality.

<P>
Speaking at the inauguration ceremony, Taiwanese Ambassador to
Panama Hou Ping- fu said that as there are no libraries at
Panama's remote schools, the Taiwan government decided to make
donations to help build the library at the request of FUNDACUNA,
a local non-profit organization.

<P>
Taiwan is also planning, in the near future, to donate computers
to Panama's elementary schools in remote areas as part of its
efforts to help improve the quality of education in the Central
American country, Hou said.

Coinciding with the inauguration of the library, FUNDACUNA also
distributed a shipment of clothing and footwear donated by Taiwan
to the disadvantaged in La Conga. Taiwan donated a total of 76
containers of clothing and footwear to Panama last year.
</P>
<P>
FUNDACUNA Chairman Edith Roqueber told CNA that the organization
has received funds from the ROC government to help build six
community libraries, and that so far three libraries have been
inaugurated.
