The Pingtung Agricultural Biotechnology Park (PABP) in southern
Taiwan is scheduled to go into operation in July following the
completion of first-stage factory construction work, a park
executive said Sunday.

According to PABP Preparatory Office Director Chen Chien-pin, the
first stage of standard factory construction at the Faifeng Base,
with an area of 233 hectares, was completed May 1.

Chen said that given the enthusiastic response of local and
foreign manufacturers, the park administration is working towards
a second-stage factory project at the Taiyuan Base, with an area
of 107 hectares, which is expected to begin in February 2008 and
to be completed in April 2009.

The Haifeng Base, located in the township of Changchih, will see
the development of nine key industries, while the Taiyuan Base,
located in the township of Fangliao, will be a fish breeding
zone, Chen said, adding that the park's annual output is expected
to hit NT$9 billion (US$274.39 million).

Since unveiling a name plaque of the agricultural biotechnology
park under the Cabinet-level Council of Agriculture in October
2003, 100 biotechnology firms have applied to set up production
lines in the facility, with 48 companies granted permission to
invest around NT$1.98 billion in the park, according to the
official.
