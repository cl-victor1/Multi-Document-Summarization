The four ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) presidential
hopefuls were urged Sunday to deliver on promises made before the
presidential primary to unite and jointly fight the opposition
parties in the 2008 presidential election.
</P>
<P>
DPP Secretary-General Lin Chia-lung said each of the four DPP
presidential aspirants -- Vice President Annette Lu, Premier Su
Tseng-chang, DPP Chairman Yu Shyi-kun and former Premier Frank
Hsieh -- have given their word that they will not violate party
norms regarding the presidential primary, that they will not quit
the DPP to enter the 2008 presidential race as an independent and
that they will unite and help drum up support for the one and
only DPP presidential candidate, whoever that may be, when
eventually nominated.

<P>
Speaking at a polling station in Taichung, central Taiwan on the
day of the DPP held primaries for the upcoming legislative and
presidential elections, Lin said no DPP supporters will support
any division of the party.

<P>
Meanwhile, Lin also called for DPP members, loosely numbering
254,000 nationwide, to sign up Sunday at polling stations to
support the holding of two national referendums on retrieving the
main opposition Kuomintang's  "ill- gotten"  assets and the
country's application to join the United Nations under the name
of "Taiwan."
</P>
<P>
About 60 percent or 150,000 of the DPP members are expected to
turn out Sunday for the legislative and presidential primaries.
