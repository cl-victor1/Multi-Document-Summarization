Taipei,  May 6 (CNA) 05/06/07  20:04:45 (By Sofia Wu)

Ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) Chairman Yu Shyi-kun
said Sunday he has decided to immediately stop all campaign
activities for the party's primary for the 2008 presidential
election now that his performance in a vote by party members
earlier in the day has fallen short of expectations.
</P>
<P>
Asked whether his announcement means that he has decided to
withdraw from the race for the party's nomination for the 2008
election, a spokesman for Yu's campaign said the two moves are
almost the same.
</P>
<P>
Whether Yu withdraws from the race or not, the spokesman said,
the subsequent series of public opinion polls will be held as
scheduled.
</P>
<P>
"Yu's decision to stop campaign activities represents his respect
for  the party's  primary  mechanism  and  demonstrates  his
sportsmanship," the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Under the DPP primary system, the result of vote by party members
accounts for 30 percent of a hopeful's final score while the
results of a series of public opinion polls to be held after the
vote account for the remaining 70 percent.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, another presidential aspirant, Premier Su
Tseng-chang announced his decision to withdraw from the primary
as he lagged behind former Premier Frank Hsieh in the vote by DPP
members.
</P>
<P>
The final vote count has not yet been formally announced as of
the press time.
</P>
<P>
Now that party members have expressed their choice, Su said he
decided to withdraw from the fray and throw his full support
behind the top winner of the primary.
