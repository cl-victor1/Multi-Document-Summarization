Former Premier Frank Hsieh, who emerged Sunday as a surprise
winner in the first phase of the ruling Democratic Progressive
Party's (DPP's) presidential primary, said he keenly hopes the
momentum of the party primary can from now on be turned into the
capacity for party unity.
</P>
<P>
Hsieh made the call after initial returns of a vote by DPP
members to choose the party's candidate for the 2008 presidential
election showed that he beat the three other hopefuls to become
the top vote-getter.
</P>
<P>
Hsieh said he already informed President Chen Shui-bian and his
three rivals -- Vice President Annette Lu, Premier Su Tseng-chang
and DPP Chairman Yu Shyi-kun -- of the voting results.
</P>
<P>
All of his rivals agreed that all the bickering and rivalry in
the run-up to the primary vote should now be put aside and give
the top priority to promoting intraparty unity, Hsieh said.
</P>
<P>
He also said the party should first focus pull out all the stops
to win the two impending by-elections -- Keelung City mayor and
Shenkang township chief -- as well as pushing for referendums on
forcing the main opposition Kuomintang to return is ill-gotten
party assets to the national coffers and on joining the United
Nations under the name of Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
The final vote count has not yet been formally announced as of
the press time.
</P>
<P>
Although the initial returns showed that Lu was at the bottom in
terms of vote number, she said she will persevere in going into
the second phase of the primary, in which a series of public
opinion polls will be held to explore the hopefuls' approval
rating or support rate among ordinary voters or non-DPP members.
</P>
<P>
Under the DPP primary system, the result of vote by party members
accounts for 30 percent of a hopeful's final score while the
results of a series of public opinion polls to be held after the
vote account for the remaining 70 percent.
</P>
<P>
Lu said she is confident that she can perform better in the
second phase of the primary.
</P>
<P>
In contrast, Premier Su announced his withdrawal from the race
for the party's mandate for the next presidential election
shortly after learning that he lagged behind Hsieh in the primary
vote.
</P>
<P>
Another aspirant, DPP Chairman Yu, also said he will immediately
stop all campaign activities now that his performance in the vote
fell short of his expectations.
