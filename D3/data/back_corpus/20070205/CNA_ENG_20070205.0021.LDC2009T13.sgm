The Consumer's Foundation urged the government Monday to require
manufacturers of bathroom and toilet cleaners to label the pH
value of their products and to issue related warnings for
consumers in the wake of survey results showing that 75 percent
of these products are either strong acids or alkalis.
</P>
<P>
The survey was conducted among 20 bathroom and toilet cleaners
purchased  by the foundation  from various department  stores,
supermarkets, hypermarkets and household item stores in Taipei
between Dec. 15, 2006 and Jan. 5, 2007.
</P>
<P>
Of the 20 products, 13 were strong acids and two were strong
alkalis, foundation officials said.
</P>
<P>
While only seven of the 20 products had the pH value listed,
three were wrongly labeled and only four advised consumers to
wear gloves while using the cleaners, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
They called on consumers to select bathroom and toilet cleaners
with complete labeling to ensure their own safety.
</P>
<P>
While using the cleaners, consumers should avoid direct skin
contact with the cleaners and should only use them in well-
ventilated areas, they said.
</P>
<P>
If their skin comes in contact with the toxic substances, they
should rinse the affected area with plenty of water and seek
medical treatment, the officials added.
