The Taipei International Book Exhibition 2007 lowered the curtain
Sunday after drawing more than 400,000 visitors in six days, the
event's leading organizer said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Rex How, chief of the Taipei Book Fair Foundation, which
organized the annual event, dismissed the decline in the number
of visitors this year as insignificant, attributing it to the
fact that this year's exhibition took place in the leadup to
Chinese New Year when local people are busy preparing for the
holiday and during the national academic performance examinations
for senior high school graduates.
</P>
<P>
However, How claimed, the exhibition has developed into a
regional event which distinguishes it from book fairs in Beijing,
which cater mainly to publishers, and book fairs in Hong Kong,
which aim to sell books.
</P>
<P>
In addition to publishing companies in Japan and South Korea that
debuted at the exhibition last year, How said, publishing firms
from Southeast Asia were also invited to display their books at
the exhibition this year, a move aimed at reflecting the
country's increasing number of immigrants from that region.
</P>
<P>
How, whose term as chief of the Taipei Book Fair Foundation ended
with the close of the 2007 exhibition, said he is glad the book
fair has put the island on the map of the international
publishing business.
