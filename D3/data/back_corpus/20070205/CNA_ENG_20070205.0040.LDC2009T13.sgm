COURT APPOINTS TEMPORARY MANAGERS FOR CHINA REBAR
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Taipei,  Feb. 5 (CNA) 02/05/07  20:37:38 (By Y.C. Jou)
</P>
<P>
The Taipei District Court Monday appointed three temporary
managers for the financially troubled China Rebar Co. while it
continues to review the company's insolvency reorganization
petition, filed last December.
</P>
<P>
The court appointed a deputy manager of the Mega International
Commercial Bank, which is a major creditor of Rebar, a lawyer
from the KPMG accounting firm and an accountant as temporary
managers.
</P>
<P>
The court selected the three after consulting with the Ministry
of Economic Affairs and decided that they are professional and
skilled in company organizational affairs, a court spokesman said
Monday.
</P>
<P>
A self-help association formed by suppliers to the Idee Fashion
Stores, a sister company to the China Rebar, had proposed that
Wang Lin-mei, general manager of both Idee and China Rebar, be
appointed as China Rebar's temporary manager on the basis that
she best knows what is needed, and is most able to stabilize the
company's operations.
</P>
<P>
But the court rejected the association's proposal as Wang herself
is suspected of diverting Rebar's funds and is free only due to a
NT$8-million bail release, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The Company Act stipulates that when a company's board of
directors is unable to function and such a situation is likely to
cause damage to the company, the court can appoint temporary
managers at the petition of interested parties, or the
prosecution, to exercise the functions of the chairman and the
board.
</P>
<P>
The court's ruling came as a response to a petition by the
district prosecutor's office, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
China Rebar and the Chia Hsin Food and Synthetic Fiber Co., both
subsidiaries of the Rebar Asia Pacific Group, applied for
insolvency protection Dec. 29. The disclosure of the
conglomerate's financial troubles kicked off intensive
investigations into a series of economic  crimes affecting  many
of the group's several dozen affiliates.
</P>
<P>
The primary fugitive Wang You-theng, founder of the Rebar Group,
is now being held by the U.S. immigration in Los Angeles. His
attempt to fly to Myanmar from the United States failed last
Saturday when the authorities of Singapore, his planned transit
stop, sent him back to the U.S. and Taiwan authorities then
invalidated his travel documents.
