LARGEST YET HAUL OF CONTRABAND DRUG SEIZED ON KINMEN
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  Feb.  5 (CNA) 02/05/07  21:59:26

Agents of the Bureau of Investigation seized, last month, 32,000
tablets of Nimetazepam on the outlying island of Kinmen, the
largest haul yet intercepted in the mail from Taiwan proper, a
bureau spokesman said Monday.

A 48 year-old man, identified as Lu Hsing-huan, who is alleged to
have tried smuggling the contraband third-grade drug to Xiamen,
in China's Fujian province, through direct trade and shipping
links between the two sides. Lu was arrested Jan. 22 by
investigating agents upon his arrival from Xiamen at the Taoyuan
International Airport near Taipei, the spokesman said.

It was the first time that a drug courier sought to export
contraband narcotics from Taiwan to China using the mini three
links, the spokesman said, adding that the illegal drugs have a
street value of up to NT$6 million.
</P>
<P>
Nimetazepam has reportedly become increasingly popular among
Chinese youth -- in addition to marijuana and ketamine --
prompting Taiwan drug dealers to seek to smuggle the drugs into
China to tap the strong demand there.
</P>
<P>
According to the spokesman, Kinmen's prosecutor was tipped off
some six months ago that Lu was planning to smuggle a large haul
of Nimetazepam from Kinmen to Xiaman by the Feb. 18 Chinese New
Year, using direct transport  links between the two sides.
Citing investigators stationed on Kinmen, the spokesman said that
Lu mailed the 32,000 tablets of Nimetazepam in three parcels from
Taiwan to Kinmen Jan. 3, from where he attempted to have the
illicit drug smuggled into Xiamen through the mini three links.
</P>
<P>
Investigation shows that Lu flew from Taiwan to Kinmen the same
day to arrange smuggling channels to take the contraband
substance to Xiamen. He flew back to Taiwan later the same day
and immediately transferred to Macau en route to Xiamen, where he
planned to take delivery of the three parcels himself.
</P>
<P>
However, Lu was forced to fly back to Taiwan and was detained by
agents Jan. 22 upon his arrival at the Taoyuan airport, after
having waited in vain in Xiamen for the arrival of the three
parcels of Nimetazepam, which had been intercepted by relevant
authorities on Kinmen Island.
</P>
<P>
Although Lu argued that he had no any idea that an unlawful drug
was concealed in the three parcels, the spokesman said, he was
nonetheless sent to the Kinmen Prosecutor's Office for further
investigation.
