Eleven doctors from Mongolia received certificates Monday marking
the completion of a six-month training course they undertook in
Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
The 11 doctors received training  in emergency  rooms and
departments  of internal  medicine,  surgery,  rehabilitation,
ophthalmology, pharmaceuticals and traditional Chinese medicine
of Taipei Hospital  under the Department  of Health,  located in
Hsinchuang, Taipei County.
</P>
<P>
Addressing  a  commencement  ceremony,  Huang  Kun-chang,
superintendent of the Taipei Hospital, said Taiwan has helped
train a total of 22 Mongolian doctors since Taiwan's
International Medical Training Center was established at the
hospital in late 2002.
</P>
<P>
The center provided training for one Mongolian doctor in 2003,
following by four in 2004, six in 2005 and 11 in 2006, Huang
said.
</P>
<P>
Of the 11 Mongolian doctors who received training in Taiwan prior
to 2005, one has been promoted to be a deputy superintendent of
Mongolia's major Central Hospital, Huang said, adding that two
others have also been promoted as department chiefs of state-
level hospitals in Mongolia.
</P>
<P>
The training program has not only helped raise the professional
standards of Mongolia's doctors but has also led Mongolia, which
maintains no formal diplomatic relations with Taiwan, into
supporting Taiwan in the country's bid to enter the World Health
Assembly, the decision-making body of the World Health
Organization,  as an observer, Huang claimed.
</P>
<P>
G. Enkhtsetseg, one of the doctors who received their graduate
certificates Monday, said she feels blessed and privileged to
have had an opportunity to receive training in Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Having learned about neurological  diagnosis and treatment,
Enkhtsetseg said that although much of the equipment she saw and
used in Taipei Hospital are still not available in Mongolia's
hospitals, the training she has received will benefit her career.
</P>
<P>
According to Huang, Taipei Hospital has helped train 50 medical
professionals from six countries  since the inception of the
International Medical Training Center. The center has also
conducted exchange programs with medical organizations from 31
countries over the past four years.
