ARSENIC CONTENT IN GUANDU PLAIN RICE NEGLIGIBLE: ACADEMIC
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  Feb.  5 (CNA) 02/05/07  15:40:19 (By Deborah Kuo)

The arsenic content in rice harvested on Taipei's Guandu Plain is
negligible, and the rice poses no threat to human health, an
academic at National Taiwan University (NTU) claimed Monday.
</P>
<P>
Chang  Tsun-kuo,  a  professor  in  NTU's  Department  of
Bioenvironmental Systems Engineering, said the average amount of
arsenic in Guandu Plain rice has been discovered to be just 0.2
ppm, even lower than the German standard of 1 ppm for allowable
arsenic content for grains.
</P>
<P>
Under a contract with the Taipei City Environmental Protection
Bureau, Chang has led an NTU research team to conduct field
research on the Guandu Plain, where the team has discovered that
of the 800 hectares of farmland, 123 hectares were detected to
contain arsenic levels above the national standard of 60 ppm for
farmland.
</P>
<P>
Chang attributed the high arsenic content in the soil on the
Guandu Plain to the fact that the farmland is irrigated by water
from a hotspring valley located in the plain's northern Beitou
suburb.
</P>
<P>
Arsenic content in earth or rocks found in the Beitou hotspring
valley has been discovered to be as high as 10,000 ppm, although
the arsenic content in the water is only 0.5 ppm, Chang said.
</P>
<P>
Chang said the arsenic "pollution" on the Guandu Plain is a
natural phenomenon resulting from geothermal  activity in the
hotspring area.
</P>
<P>
Noting that farmers in the Guandu Plain area have been using
hotspring water from Beitou to irrigate their farmlands for more
than 200 years, Chang said that no cases of black-foot disease
resulting from arsenic-polluted water have been reported in the
Guandu Plain area in that time and that rice grown in the area is
not harmful to human health.
