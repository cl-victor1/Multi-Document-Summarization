A Chinese equivalent of the TOEFL (Test of English as a Foreign
Language) will be officially launched in March overseas, the
Ministry of Education (MOE) announced Monday.
</P>
<P>
MOE officials said the Test of Proficiency-Hanyu (TOP), devised
by National Taiwan Normal University and a Chinese language test
promotion committee at the commission of the ministry, began
tests for basic-level Chinese in Thailand, South Korea, Japan,
Britain and the United States on a trial basis last year.
</P>
<P>
Chang Chin-sheng, director of the ministry's Bureau of
International Cultural and Educational Relations, said the first
test of all-level Chinese language will be launched in Japan,
South Korea, Vietnam, Thailand, New York and Los Angeles. The
basic-level test will be held in Britain and France, tentatively
set for March or April.
</P>
<P>
Chang said that as it will be on a trial basis in Britain and
France, there will be no registration fees charged, although
registration fees will be needed in other areas.
</P>
<P>
Those who pass the tests -- available in either traditional or
simplified characters -- will be issued a score sheet and
conferred a language proficiency certificate, and will be given
priority should they seek scholarships in Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
TOP performance will also be used as a reference by colleges and
universities when  screening  foreign  students'  enrollment
applications, he said.
</P>
<P>
The government will also encourage Taiwan businessmen to give
hiring priority to those who have passed the TOP.
