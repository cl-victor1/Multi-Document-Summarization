The Ministry of National Defense has agreed to remove all statues
of the late President Chiang Kai-shek from barracks around the
country before Feb. 28, which will be the 60th anniversary of the
so-called 228 Incident, three lawmakers of the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) said Saturday.

<P>
Citing a report issued last year by the 228 Memorial Foundation,
DPP lawmakers Chai Trong-rong, Sandy Yen and Hsueh Ling said in a
statement the Chiang Kai- shek was the main culprit behind the
228 Incident in 1947 when troops of the Chinese Nationalist
government crushed a revolt in Taiwan, killing thousands of
people.

<P>
In memory of the incident, the lawmakers said that they asked the
Ministry of National Defense to remove the statues before Feb. 28
and that the ministry agreed to their request.
</P>
<P>
The statement also called for the renaming of the National Chiang
Kai-shek Memorial Hall in Taipei as the Taiwan Democracy Memorial
Hall.
