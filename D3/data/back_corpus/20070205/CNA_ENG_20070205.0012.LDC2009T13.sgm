An international symposium on Sung Dynasty culture and artifacts
opened at the National Palace Museum Monday with more than 40
scholars and art researchers from home and abroad participating.
</P>
<P>
The four-day international symposium is part of the ongoing high-
profile exhibition "Grand View: Painting, Calligraphy, Ju Ware
and Rare Books from the Northern Sung Dynasty" which the National
Palace Museum has organized to mark its official reopening on
Feb. 8 after almost two years of remodeling.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the opening of the symposium, National Palace Museum
Director Lin Mun-lee said that arts, culture and the cultural
development models from the Sung Dynasty (960-1279) have
tremendously influenced the world's cultural development and that
the collections of Sung Dynasty artifacts happen to be among the
most pivotal collections of the National Palace Museum, which is
considered the world's leading Chinese artifact museum.
</P>
<P>
The scholars and experts from the United Kingdom, Germany, the
United States, Japan, South Korea, China and Taiwan are expected
to exchange views during the symposium on Sung Dynasty artifacts
and the trends of cultural development during that period, Lin
said.
</P>
<P>
The three-month Grand View exhibition, which is scheduled to end
March 25, showcases a total of 42 paintings and 29 pieces of
calligraphy dating from the Northern Sung period (960-1127), as
well as five Northern Sung paintings and calligraphy works on
loan from the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York and the
Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art in Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
Also on display are Ju ceramic wares of the Northern Sung period,
fired in the early 12th century, which are renowned for the
classical beauty of their warm and glossy sky-blue glaze.
Surviving pieces of Ju ware are extremely rare, with less than 70
found in collections around the world today. The National Palace
Museum is fortunate to have 21, the most of any collection.
</P>
<P>
Renowned for its impressive collection of art works of the Sung
Dynasty, the museum is putting its collection of Sung Dynasty
artifacts in its entirety on display for the first and possibly
the last time due to the fragility of the art works. The museum
is known for its unique collection of some 654,500 imperial art
treasures brought to Taiwan at the end of the Chinese civil war
in 1949 to keep them out of the hands of the communists.
