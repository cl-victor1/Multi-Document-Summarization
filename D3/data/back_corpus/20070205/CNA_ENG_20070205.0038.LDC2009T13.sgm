RELOCATING CKS MEMORIAL HALL NEEDS NO LAW REVISION: DPP LAWMAKER
</HEADLINE>

Taipei, Feb. 5 (CNA) 02/05/07  19:30:35 (By Lilian Wu)

<P>
A lawmaker of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)
claimed Monday that a relocation of the Chiang Kai-shek Memorial
Hall at the heart of Taipei City would require no revision of the
law.
</P>
<P>
DPP Legislator Gao Jyh-peng noted that the organic law of the
Chiang Kai-shek Memorial Hall administration does not stipulate
the exact location of the hall.
</P>
<P>
As such, the Executive Yuan need only reach a formal resolution
on the relocation at its floor meeting. The memorial hall could
then be relocated to Taoyuan County in northern Taiwan, the
location of the temporary mausoleums of Chiang Kai-shek, who died
in 1975, and his son Chiang Ching-kuo, who died in 1988, Gao
said.
</P>
<P>
The current site of the CKS Memorial Hall could then be renamed
the Taiwan Democracy Memorial Hall, he added.
</P>
<P>
He said the DPP Central Standing Committee invited Minister of
Education Tu Cheng-sheng to report at its weekly meeting last
Wednesday,  in which Tu suggested  the change and Premier Su
Cheng-chang said the matter could be studied.
</P>
<P>
"The Executive Yuan should pass a relocation of the Chiang Kai-
shek Memorial Hall as soon as possible," Gao urged.
</P>
<P>
He said that with the coming of 60th anniversary of the 2-28
Incident of 1947, when troops of the Chinese Nationalist
government crushed a revolt in Taiwan, killing thousands of
people, the government should form an investigation committee to
get to the bottom of the tragedy that continues to split society
today.
</P>
<P>
If Chiang Kai-shek is confirmed to have been the perpetrator of
the suppression, there is no way the next generation should be
educated to pay respects to the killer, he said.
</P>
<P>
The call for memorial hall relocation came after reports that the
Ministry of National Defense had agreed to remove all statues of
the late president from barracks around the country before Feb.
28.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Economic Affairs also announced last week a plan
to change the name of the Chinese Petroleum Corp. (CPC) to "CPC,
Taiwan," and that of the Chinese Shipbuilding Corp. (CSBC) to
"CSBC, Taiwan" as part of the government's efforts to avoid
confusing the state-run companies with Chinese ones.
</P>
<P>
The opposition parties have accused the DPP of "ruling the nation
with ideology" in a bid to blot out the last vestiges of China's
influence from the country.
