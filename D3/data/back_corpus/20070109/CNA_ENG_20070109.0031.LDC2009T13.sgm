Tourism Bureau chief Lai Ser-jen said Tuesday that although
Taiwan is still targeting "traditional markets" for tourists, she
is happy to learn that some European countries have listed Taiwan
in Asian package tours for the first time.
</P>
<P>
Lai noted that Japan, South Korea, Hong Kong, Singapore and
Malaysia are still the priority countries the bureau targets,
even though Britain and Germany have also listed Taiwan in their
package tours, such as islandwide tours and birdwatching tours in
Asia.
</P>
<P>
Lai noted that foreign tourists made more than 3.51 million
visits to Taiwan last year, up 4.19 percent from the previous
year. In December, the number of tourists was 320,000, setting a
single-month record.
</P>
<P>
Officials estimate that the production value of tourism last year
amounted to NT$372.5 billion (US$11.35 billion), up 4.6 percent
from 2005, showing that the nation's tourism image has become
more salient over the years. Lai said the bureau will continue to
use the catchphrase "Taiwan, touch your heart" in promoting
Taiwan tourism this year.
</P>
<P>
Lai said she was glad to learn that large travel operators in
Britain and Germany have listed Taiwan in package tours in Asia.
</P>
<P>
German travel operators offer a five-day tour at around NT$40,000
not including airfare, while British operators offer a 14-day
islandwide tour at around NT$100,000, along with a 14-day,
NT$150,000 birdwatching package tour.
</P>
<P>
Lai said the effects of promoting Taiwan in Japan, South Korea,
Hong Kong, Singapore and Malaysia can be seen quickly, but added
that promoting tourism in Europe and the United States requires
long-term efforts and making good use of public relations
companies to make inroads into the mainstream travel agencies.
</P>
<P>
Although such package tours usually target small groups, Lai said
tourists from Europe and the United States usually spend more
during their stays in Taiwan.
