<P>
The Civil Aeronautics Administration (CAA) said Tuesday that
starting March 1, it will require passengers on international
flights to pack their liquid containers in clear plastic bags.
</P>
<P>
CAA officials said the move will come at the suggestion of the
International Civil Aviation Organization, noting that the United
States and Britain have required passengers to place all cans or
containers with liquid, jelly, or spray into plastic bags after
British authorities foiled a terrorist attempt to attack a
U.S.-bound plane using liquid explosives last August.
</P>
<P>
Canada and the European Union have already enacted the security
measure, while Japan and Hong Kong will soon follow suit, the
officials said.
</P>
<P>
The officials said they have coordinated with the Aviation Police
Bureau on the matter. Starting March 1st, passengers departing
from Taiwan or making transit stops at Taiwan airports will
follow the stricter measures, as practiced in other countries.
</P>
<P>
They said passengers must not carry onboard liquid, jelly or
spray containers weighing over 100 mm.
</P>
<P>
All liquid containers should be placed in clear plastic bags that
can be sealed and resealed. Every passenger will be restricted to
one carry-on plastic bag that will be subject to inspection at
airports.
</P>
<P>
Passengers departing from Taiwan or making transit stops are
allowed to take aboard liquid, gels or spray items purchased at
duty-free shops or onboard the plane, but they should be sealed
to avoid tampering.
</P>
<P>
Baby formula, baby food, medicines or liquid, jelly or sprays
that diabetic patients need or other medicines should file
reports with security inspectors and get prior approval.
</P>
<P>
According to new security regulations, plastic bags of such items
will have to be separated from other carry-on luggage, overcoats,
or personal computers for inspection.
</P>
<P>
The officials also said they have coordinated with domestic and
foreign airlines to provide clear plastic bags in the beginning
days of the new measure.
</P>
<P>
As more stringent security checks will take time, CAA officials
highly recommend passengers check in at airports three hours
prior to departure time.
