Researchers at Academia Sinica -- Taiwan's top research
institution -- have completed refining an ion-trap mass
spectrometer that allows much higher accuracy in measuring the
mass of viruses, academy sources said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Research fellows at Academia Sinica's Institute of Atomic and
Molecular Sciences said that although their new model of mass
spectrometer -- "Laser-Induced Acoustic Desorption Mass
Spectrometer" -- was already capable of measuring the mass of
cells, bacteria, and viruses in the first stage of refinement in
2005, the accuracy in measuring viruses is still below
requirements.
</P>
<P>
After the second stage of refinement in 2006, they narrowed the
margin of error down to one percent, a great leap compared to
previous 15-percent error margins, they said, adding that the
next step in the project is to lower the margin to one-thousandth
or one-tenth of a thousandth.
</P>
<P>
The results were published in December 2006 by Germany-based
science journal Angewandte Chemie in its international edition
under the title of "Microscopy- Based Mass Measurement of a
Single Whole Virus in a Cylindrical Ion Trap."
</P>
<P>
Chang Huan-cheng, the head of the research team, said the two
major applications for developing and refining such a technique
are in the rapid determination of diseases and improving accuracy
in selecting therapy.
</P>
<P>
Chang explained that by calculating the mass of viruses, it will
be more easy for clinical doctors to determine the true pathogens
of epidemics -- by isolating the suspected subject, weighing it,
and comparing the data collected to the germ/virus mass database
for confirmation.
</P>
<P>
The team has already weighed many viruses, such as the mass of
vaccinia virus, which is 5.4 grams times 10 to the power of minus
15, iridovirus is 7.5 grams times 10 to the power of minus 16,
and the human adenovirus -- 2.9 grams times 10 to the power of
minus 16.
</P>
<P>
Mapping the "normal" weight of viruses could be helpful in
scientific research, Chang noted, adding that the variation in
mass of a certain virus could be an indication of mutation,
facilitating further cross-examination to spot the changes in
characteristics.
