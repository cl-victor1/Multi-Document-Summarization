<P>
The Cabinet-level Council for Economic Planning and Development
(CEPD) will earmark NT$8 billion over the next six years to
replace 2,800 garbage trucks that are over six years old,
officials said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The move is part of a NT$16.1 billion plan proposed by the
Environmental Protection Administration (EPA) in order to reach a
goal of "zero waste."
</P>
<P>
The CEPD approved the plan at a commissioners' meeting convened a
day earlier.
</P>
<P>
The plan will be in effect from 2007 to 2012, said Ho Soong-chin,
director- general of the EPA's Solid Waste Control Bureau.
</P>
<P>
Ho pointed out that in 2005, the daily amount of garbage
collected averaged 15,318 tons. As of September 2006, the amount
had fallen to 14,140 tons.
</P>
<P>
He estimated that under the plan, the amount can be further cut
this year to 14,000 tons.
</P>
<P>
The plan includes the promotion of compulsory garbage separation,
the reuse of kitchen waste, the reuse of bulky waste, the reuse
of decoration and renovation waste, zero waste, the establishment
of human waste treatment facilities and the replacement of old
garbage trucks.
