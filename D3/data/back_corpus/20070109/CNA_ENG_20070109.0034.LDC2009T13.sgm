POPE ASKED TO PUSH CHINA TO DISMANTLE MISSILES TARGETING TAIWAN
</HEADLINE>

Taipei, Jan. 9 (CNA) 01/09/07  21:27:20 (By Elizabeth Hsu)
</P>
<P>
President Chen Shui-bian has recently sent a letter to Pope
Benedict XVI, asking the pontiff to continue paying attention to
human rights in China and to push Beijing to give up the idea of
using military force against Taiwan, according to a Tuesday news
release from the Presidential Office.
</P>
<P>
Chen wrote the letter to express his agreement with the pope's
idea revealed in his Jan. 1 message for the 2007 World Day of
Peace, which states that humans are "the heart of peace, "
according to the news release.
</P>
<P>
In the annual message, the pontiff called for the international
community to set ethical limits on what can be done to protect
their citizens from terrorism and to halt the growing threat of a
new nuclear arms race.
</P>
<P>
Chen told the pope that Taiwan has been suppressed by China in
its bid for U.N. membership, which has deprived the Taiwan people
of the right to join international activities under the same
conditions enjoyed by other people.
</P>
<P>
Casting Taiwan aside, the organization has violated the principle
of universality listed in the Charter of the United Nations,
according to Chen, who noted that despite being treated unfairly,
Taiwan has still never been reluctant to promote world peace and
improve welfare for all.
</P>
<P>
Over the past half-century, Taiwan has been in the shadow of
China's military threat. Taiwan's desire for peace has increased,
while China's military budget has seen double-digit  increases
annually for the past two decades.
</P>
<P>
Such an increase in military spending has far surpassed the need
to maintain national defense ability, Chen said, adding that
Beijing has deployed more than 800 missiles along its
southeastern coast, casting a shadow of war over the Taiwan
Strait and the whole of Southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
To seek peace and stability in the strait, Chen said he has never
stopped efforts to try to resolve cross-strait disputes through
dialogue in an equal and peaceful manner since he took power six
years ago. However, he has not received a goodwill response from
Beijing, Chen said in the letter.
