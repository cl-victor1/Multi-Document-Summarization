People are most frequently exposed to the hazard of passive
smoking at home or in the workplace, according to an annual
survey on adult smoking behavior released Tuesday by the Bureau
of Health Promotion (BHP) under the Department of Health.
</P>
<P>
In the latest survey -- based on telephone interviews with 16,749
people over 18 years old around the country between June and
September 2006 -- 34.8 percent of respondents said they do not
refrain from smoking at home even while family members are
present, while 38.62 percent said they smoke in the presence of
colleagues at work.
</P>
<P>
The survey also showed one in every three respondents was exposed
to passive smoking either at home or in the workplace during the
one-week period before responding to the poll.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, 17.74 percent of respondents indicated they are
exposed to passive smoking every day at home, while 13.66 percent
said they are forced to breathe second-hand smoke every day at
work.
</P>
<P>
Deputy BHP Director Chao Kun-yu said the survey shows most homes
around the country do not prohibit smoking, while 37 percent of
work environments have never imposed a ban against smoking in
public indoor areas.
</P>
<P>
Although the percentage of passive smoking hazards at home or in
the workplace decreased in 2006 from the previous two years'
level, the drop was not significant enough to reflect the fact
that non-smokers' rights are becoming widely protected, Chao
said, noting efforts to advertise smoking hazards need to be
reinforced.
</P>
<P>
Chao also suggested promoting an amendment to the Tabacco Hazards
Prevention Act to enact a ban against smoking in indoor
workplaces.
