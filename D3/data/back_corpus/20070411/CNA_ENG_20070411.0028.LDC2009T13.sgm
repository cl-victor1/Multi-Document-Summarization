CIVIC GROUP SUES CITY GOV'T OVER OLD TREES FELLING
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  April  11 (CNA) 04/11/07  20:59:27 (By Elisa Kao)

An alliance of civic groups in Taipei dedicated to the protection
of forests said Wednesday that it is suing officials of the
Taipei City Government for not protecting decades-old trees at
the Songshan Tobacco Factory, where the city government will
build a large sports stadium.
</P>
<P>
Members of the Taipei Tobacco Factory Public Park Promotion
Alliance staged a skit in front of the Taipei District
Prosecutors' Office, hinting that Taipei Mayor Hau Lung-bin is
planting young trees with left hand while cutting older trees
with his right.
</P>
<P>
Pan Han-shen, secretary-general of the Green Party Taiwan, which
joined with other like-minded groups to form the alliance, noted
that the Taipei City Government failed to protect the 353 trees
around the factory, which were planted during the period of
Japanese colonial rule in Taiwan and are supposed to be protected
by the government.
</P>
<P>
With the city government failing to list the 353 trees as
protected, and instead listing only 136, Pan said the alliance
had grounds to sue officials for forgery and dereliction of duty,
and asked that all of the transplanting task be stopped.
</P>
<P>
As the site for the "big Dome" sports stadium is one of the few
forested areas left in Taipei and has long been considered the
"lungs of the city, " the alliance has staged many protests
against the city government in order to protect the few oasis in
this metropolitan city.
</P>
<P>
Pan said they are not opposed to a sports stadium, however, a
survey conducted by the city government in 2002 did not mention
that the development project would include department stores,
shopping malls, office buildings and several five-star hotels
outside the stadium.
</P>
<P>
Noting that this project is now far from public expectations of a
sports stadium, Pan said the alliance has won the endorsement of
many villagers near the Sungshan Tobacco Factory for their
campaign dubbed: "We want forests, and not commercial complexes,
" and the campaign is still underway.
