LAWMAKERS DISSATISFIED WITH PERFORMANCE OF STATE-RUN ENTERPRISES

Taipei,  April  11 (CNA) 04/11/07  21:36:14 (By Lilian Wu)
</P>
<P>
Lawmakers called for the Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) to
step up monitoring of several state-owned enterprises to improve
their lackluster performance.
</P>
<P>
The legislators made the appeal at a legislative committee while
listening to the MOEA and its affiliated agencies report on the
execution of its budgets in 2006 and the first three months in
2007.
</P>
<P>
The legislators were concerned that six state-owned enterprises
under the MOEA -- CPC Corp., Taiwan, Taiwan Power Co., Taiwan
Sugar Co., Taiwan Water Corp., CSBC, Taiwan, and Aerospace
Industrial Development Corp. (AIDC) -- reported revenues of
NT$1.29 trillion and expenditures of NT$1.3 trillion with pre-tax
losses of NT$12.55 billion, which was a far cry from its original
estimate of NT$8 billion surplus, mainly because of the surging
cost of purchasing crude oil by the CPC.
</P>
<P>
The six state-owned enterprises recorded revenues of NT$291.04
billion and expenditures of NT$289.13 billion with a pre-tax
surplus of NT$1.91 billion in the first three months this year,
mainly because of the implementation of a floating oil price
mechanism which was put into practice early this year.
</P>
<P>
Legislator Lin Cheng-feng of the opposition Kuomintang said that
although Taisugar, the largest land owner in Taiwan, showed a
surplus, it was due mainly to land sales as its businesses have
continued to lose money.
</P>
<P>
Since the sugar industry is no longer a government monopoly
enterprise, he suggested that it close doors and turn over its
land to the National Property Administration under the Ministry
of Finance.
</P>
<P>
Taisugar President Lin Chung-hung said that the company has been
losing money because its operations are constrained by government
policy, although it has done a good job in land management.
</P>
<P>
Legislator Chang Hwa-kuan of the ruling Democratic Progressive
Party said that the AIDC has lost NT$5.2 billion, or more than
half of its capitalization, since 1995.
</P>
<P>
Except for products sold to the Ministry of National Defense,
Chang said, the AIDC has lost money on all other product lines,
and therefore the MOEA should replace the company's chairman Feng
Shih-kuan, or she will push to have the AIDC's budget cut.
