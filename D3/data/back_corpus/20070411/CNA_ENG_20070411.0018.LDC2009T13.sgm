Taiwan's Industrial Technology Research Institute (ITRI) has
developed a new security robot, called "SeQ-1," in collaboration
with the Shin Kong Security Co., an ITRI spokesman said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The SeQ-1 robot will soon join the national security system, the
spokesman said, adding that the name "SeQ-1" refers to the
robot's "security" role as well as its "Q&amp;A" function and
cute appearance.
</P>
<P>
According to the spokesman, the SeQ-1 robot has a futuristic
external form, an agile head which can turn easily, and large LED
eyes that turn on automatically in the dark.
</P>
<P>
ITRI integrated an "environment security system" into SeQ-1's
robot platform system which enables the robot to have immediate
interaction  with security monitoring systems and marks a big
difference between the SeQ-1 and foreign security robots, the
spokesman said.
