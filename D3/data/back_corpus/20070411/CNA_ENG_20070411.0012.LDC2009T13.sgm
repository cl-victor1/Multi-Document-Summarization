Veteran Taiwan female athlete Chi Cheng launched a new "walk to
stay healthy" campaign Wednesday, calling for all residents in
Taiwan to walk 10,000 steps each day to stay fit and healthy.
</P>
<P>
Chi, who earned the nickname "the flying antelope" for breaking
records at world track and field events several decades ago, said
at a news conference that she now walks to stay fit and that
rapid walking even helped cure her urinary tract infection.
</P>
<P>
Chi broke the 100-meter and 200-meter sprint world records in the
1970s.
</P>
<P>
In her first "walk to live longer" campaign launched five years
ago, Chi urged people to walk 5,000 steps a day to stay fit and
healthy. Chi also suggested that interested people buy pedometers
to keep track of the number of steps they take each day.

<P>
According to Lien Chin-chien, executive director of the Hope
Foundation established by Chi five years ago, more than 20,000
pedometers were sold around Taiwan last year, indicating that an
increasing number of people have grown fond of walking and
keeping track of how many steps they take.
</P>
<P>
Lien quoted  a Hope Foundation  member  who is a medical
professional as saying that walking 10,000 steps a day can surely
help prevent many chronic diseases.
</P>
<P>
Chi, who launched the Taiwan Walk Day on Nov. 11, 2006, said she
will again lead people from 25 cities and counties around the
country to "walk to stay healthy" on Nov. 11 this year.
