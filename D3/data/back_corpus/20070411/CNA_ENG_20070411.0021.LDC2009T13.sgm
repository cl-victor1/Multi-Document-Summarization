TAIWAN

Legislators from across the political spectrum had mixed opinions
Wednesday about whether the government should open Chinese yuan
exchange services on Taiwan proper.
</P>
<P>
In light of the fact that Taiwan may soon fully open its doors to
Chinese tourists, the legislative caucus of the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) proposed that before a cross-strait cash
settlement agreement is signed, certain selected Taiwan banking
institutions be authorized by the Taipei-based Central Bank of
China and the Financial Supervisory Commission to offer Chinese
yuan exchange services on a trial basis.
</P>
<P>
Disagreeing with the proposal, opposition People First Party
Legislator Liu Yi- ju said it would be prohibitively inconvenient
for Chinese tourists visiting Taiwan to exchange Chinese currency
at "selected" banks in appointed places, adding that the
restrictive measure would only contribute to increasing the
amount of counterfeit Chinese currency in circulation in Taiwan,
which would in turn jeopardize Taiwan's financial order.
</P>
<P>
Liu suggested that Taiwan seek to build a cross-strait cash
settlement mechanism by cooperating with the Bank of China (Hong
Kong) Co., which was authorized by Beijing three-and-a-half years
ago to conduct free conversions between the Chinese yuan and
foreign currencies.
</P>
<P>
After the ruling and opposition lawmakers failed to reach any
consensus on the issue, DPP Legislator Chang Ching-hui, who
presided over Wednesday's session, ruled that the issue should be
debated again after negotiations between the ruling and
opposition camps are completed.
</P>
<P>
Unconfirmed reports have said that Taiwan residents may have
amassed a total of more than 100 billion Chinese yuan (US$3.03
billion) over the past several years.
</P>
<P>
The accumulation of Chinese currency in Taiwan can be attributed
to a combination of factors, including China's chronic trade
deficit with Taiwan and the inclination of Taiwan businesspeople
operating in China to bring home Chinese yuan, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
In March 2004, the central bank began to allow each local citizen
to bring in up to 6,000 yuan per homecoming visit, and the amount
was raised to 20,000 yuan in October 2005. According to an
estimate by the Cabinet-level Mainland Affairs Council, local
people have made a total of more than 12 million visits to China
over the past three years.
