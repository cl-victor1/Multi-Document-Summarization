Taipei,  April 11 (CNA) 04/11/07  16:10:49 (By Deborah Kuo)

Vice President Annette Lu said Wednesday that she delivers on her
promises with action and that she is certain that some 100,000
"good housekeepers" will be produced before the end of her term
to help boost the women's labor force participation rate and to
help share household chores as well.
</P>
<P>
Lu said that so far, some 70,000 housekeepers -- including
workers specializing in senior care and care for the physically
or mentally challenged, child care workers, and workers
specializing in home management -- have been trained under a
three-pronged project that she has seen to be carried out since
April 2006.
</P>
<P>
She said she is confident that the goal of having 100,000 "good
housekeepers" trained will be achieved before her term expires in
May 2008.
</P>
<P>
Lu made the remarks while addressing a ceremony marking the
commencement of a home manager training workshop in a junior high
school in Taipei County.
</P>
<P>
She said that of Taiwan's female population of 11.28 million,
about 4.3 million are working women. Of the 4.3 million working
women, some 70 percent have been working in the service sector.
</P>
<P>
There are about 400,000 double-income households islandwide,
which will need the help of housekeepers, she added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, she said, there are some 400,000 women who no longer
work because they got married or had children, and there are some
560,000 single-parent families, most of which consist of a mother
and child.
</P>
<P>
Members  of these groups may need to seek employment  as
housekeepers, she speculated.
</P>
<P>
The "Good Housekeeping Project" -- put forward by Lu in 2005 and
introduced by the Council for Economic Planning and Developent in
April 2006 -- is aimed at providing women with training in senior
care, child care and home management to enhance their employment
opportunities,  with the goal of training 100,000 professional
housekeepers over a two-year period.
</P>
<P>
So far, under the "Good Housekeeping Project, " more than 18,000
people have completed training as care givers for seniors or
physically or mentally- challenged people, while some 42,000
child care workers and 8,000 workers specializing in home
management have completed training, Lu said.
