Taipei,  April  11 (CNA) 04/11/07  19:56:55 (By Lilian Wu)

Unique International Technology Inc. became the largest
shareholder of the Taiwan Television Enterprise Ltd. (TTV), one
of the four terrestrial networks on the island, after it bought
25.77 percent of the government's stakes in the TTV in an open
bidding Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Unique International Technology offered NT$1.74 billion (US$53.73
million), or NT$24.1 per share, beating three possible rivals in
bidding held at the headquarters of the Taiwan Cooperative Bank.
The three other aspirants were ERA Communications, Hungpan
Construction and snack giant Want Want, which offered NT$23.02,
NT$22.68 and NT$22.31 per share respectively.
</P>
<P>
Another potential buyer, Dafeng TV Ltd., withdrew from the
bidding at the last minute Tuesday because it is partially owned
by foreigners who are not allowed to operate a terrestrial
television station like TTV.
</P>
<P>
During a report to a government qualification screening panel
recently, Unique said that it already possesses 14.4 percent of
the TTV shares. In addition, it shares the same ideals as Lai
Kuo-chou, former TTV chairman and son-in-law of former President
Lee Teng-hui, who has obtained 4.84 percent of TTV shares from
TTV's former Japanese shareholder.
</P>
<P>
At the time, Unique officials said that if it wins the open
bidding, it would become TTV's dominating shareholder, avoiding a
possible ownership battle that would risk undermining the
company's competitive edge.
</P>
<P>
Teng Mei-hua, vice president of Unique International Technology,
said Wednesday that the company will make the best of TTV's brand
name and resources.
</P>
<P>
She noted that Unique TV started with capitalization of only
NT$300,000, but the company made it big by targeting specific
viewing groups, and that it will continue applying this approach
after it becomes the biggest shareholder in the 45-year old
terrestrial network.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Cabinet spokeswoman Chen Mei-lin said that the bidding
was held in a "transparent and smooth" manner. The media kept
abreast of the bidding process through a video hookup to the
conference room where the bidding took place.
</P>
<P>
On whether the Executive Yuan was satisfied with the Unique's
offer, Chen said that it is not appropriate for her to comment on
whether the offer is up to market value.
</P>
<P>
Chen noted that it will take about one month for the Unique
International Technology to obtain the shares, saying that it
will sign an agreement with Taiwan Cooperative Bank Friday and
post a deposit of NT$70 million to demonstrate that it will not
renege on the deal after winning the bid. The company will then
have to file a request with the National Communications
Commission before it can obtain the TTV shares.
</P>
<P>
Chen said that the second-stage share release of TTV targeting
the public and staff of TTV is expected to be completed this
November.
</P>
<P>
A number of state-controlled banks own around 47 percent of the
TTV shares. They have recently begun selling the shares under a
government privatization plan.
</P>
<P>
The government's plan to sell off the TTV shares drew public
attention after the Ministry of Finance, which manages the
government's stocks in the company, decided on March 21 to
replace Lai Kuo-chou, who was appointed by the ministry to act as
the government's representative at the TTV, on the grounds that
he was purchasing TTV stocks from several private investors in an
attempt to take over the company.
</P>
<P>
However, Lai accused the Executive Yuan of pulling strings in an
attempt to help the private Liberty Times group win control of
the TTV because of the close association between Liberty Times'
founder and Democratic Progressive Party government leaders.
</P>
<P>
His accusation was backed up by TTV's former Japanese stock
investor Fuji Television Network, whose representative in Taiwan
claimed at a March 25 news conference that Cheng Wen-tsang, then-
minister of the Government Information Office, tried to persuade
him to sell Fuji's stocks to Liberty Times at a dinner party in
January when a new policy forbidding foreign ownership in
terrestrial television entered into force.
</P>
<P>
Cheng, who was also a member of the government panel in charge of
examining  the potential  bidders'  qualifications,  denied the
accusation but nonetheless withdrew from the panel and resigned
from his GIO post on April 3.
