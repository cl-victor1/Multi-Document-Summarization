President Chen Shui-bian said Wednesday that for more than 2,600
days, he has daily urged himself to set the national
administration in motion, and that he was satisfied with certain
accomplishments made during his term.
</P>
<P>
In answer to questions concerning his own assessment posed by
more and more guests, Chen spoke of his impressions of his term
while receiving executives of the Taiwan chapter of the Lions
Club International at the Presidential Office.
</P>
<P>
Chen said that he and his team have achieved many of their goals
thanks to public support. There surely are a number of things in
need of improvement and reflection, but he is more than satisfied
with three important accomplishments realized during his term.
</P>
<P>
The first, Chen said, is the peaceful transfer of power, making
Taiwan  a genuinely  democratic  country;  the second  is the
nationalization of armed forces to prevent national defense from
being used by a certain political party or individual, and
thereby securing Taiwan from the threat of a military coup; and
third, holding a successful referendum to deepen Taiwan's
democracy.
