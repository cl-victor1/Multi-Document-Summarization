Chunghwa Telecom Co. strongly denied an accusation that
management has been "inhumanely" laying off its workers to
downsize the company, according to a statement issued by the
company Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The statement came after the company's labor union staged a
demonstration against the layoffs earlier that day in front of
the Legislative Yuan.
</P>
<P>
The workers also called for the replacement of the chairman, Ho
Chen-tan, who was designated by the Ministry of Transportation
and Communications (MOTC).
</P>
<P>
Chunghwa Telecom stated that it did not refuse to negotiate with
the union as accused. In fact, the two sides reached a consensus
on employee performance measurements in two meetings convened
Dec. 8 and Dec. 12 last year, the statement noted.
</P>
<P>
The actions the company has taken to adjust its organizational
structure are aimed at improving service quality, the statement
said, adding that they have not violated any laws.
</P>
<P>
Following privatization the company needs to streamline its
operations to enhance competitiveness, the statement said. The
company has adopted a preferential layoff policy that the
statement claims meets the expectations of its employees.
</P>
<P>
The statement also complained that some union members have
frequently tried to interfere in the company's operations in the
lead up to national elections.
