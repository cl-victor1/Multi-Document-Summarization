PRO-INDEPENDENCE ACTIVISTS CALL FOR REDESIGNATION OF MEMORIAL
HALL

Taipei,  April  1 (CNA) 04/01/07  22:31:27 (By Sofia Wu)

<P>
A group of pro-independence activists erected a new signboard at
a memorial park dedicated to the late President Chiang Kai-shek
in downtown Taipei Sunday to push the government to rename the
complex as the "Taiwan Democracy Memorial Park."
</P>
<P>
The activists, led by Peter Wang, convener of the 908 Taiwan
Republic Campaign, urged the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)
administration to respond positively to their call for
dismantling the stone walls of the Chiang Kai-shek Memorial Hall
complex and redesignating it as the "Taiwan Democracy Memorial
Park" before the end of this month.
</P>
<P>
Otherwise, Wang said his organization will demolish the wall on
its own in May.
</P>
<P>
Wang and his followers held a ceremonial ritual at the main
entrance to the complex to symbolize their determination to
topple the "feudalistic walls" and push for the opening of the
location as a "democracy plaza." At the end of the ritual, they
erected a wooden signboard near the gate that reads "Taiwan
Democracy Memorial Park." The signboard was removed by security
guards shortly afterwards.
</P>
<P>
The ceremonial ritual took place a day after the main opposition
Kuomintang (KMT) staged a protest march through Taipei to defend
Chiang whom the DPP administration has begun harshly criticizing
-- 32 years after his death.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, President Chen Shui-bian said at an occasion
marking the 60th anniversary of the tragic 228 Incident that
Chiang was responsible for the suppression of the mass uprising
on the island in 1947 against his government's rule that claimed
as many as 30,000 lives.
</P>
<P>
The KMT-organized protest came as the DPP administration has
stepped up its efforts to remove Chiang's statues from public
places throughout Taiwan and remove references to China from
state-run companies and institutions.
</P>
<P>
Chanting "Love Taiwan, defend the Republic of China," the largely
elderly crowd circled around the large square that surround the
Chiang Kai-shek Memorial Hall, housing a massive bronze statue of
the former leader, who once ruled China.
</P>
<P>
Chiang, who died in 1975, has been a controversial figure in
Taiwan since fleeing here in 1949 with his KMT government after
losing a civil war to Mao Zedong's Communists on the Chinese
mainland.
</P>
<P>
The DPP administration plans to rename the landmark hall in
central Taipei and has pushed for the island to use Taiwan as its
title for membership in international organizations.
