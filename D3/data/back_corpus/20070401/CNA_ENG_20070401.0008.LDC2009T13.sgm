A new typhoon formed Sunday morning, dubbed "Kong-Rey", but as of
Sunday does not pose an immediate threat to Taiwan given its
distance from the island, according to the Central Weather Bureau
(CWB).
</P>
<P>
The depression  system-turned  typhoon,  located  about 880
kilometers east southeast to Guam, was moving in a northwestern
direction toward Taiwan at a speed of 17 kilometers per hour as
of 2 p.m. Sunday, CWB meteorologists said.
</P>
<P>
Owing to the typhoon's distance from Taiwan, the weather bureau
said it remains to be seen how it will develop and its possible
impact on Taiwan in the following several days.
</P>
<P>
It is the first typhoon reported in the western Pacific this
year.
