A researcher at the National Tsing Hua University in Hsinchu,
northern Taiwan has won the Hiwin Science Award Saturday for
developing a method to help detect blood vessel tumors, called
hemangiomas, in brain.
</P>
<P>
Tsai Tsung-han,  who has just won his master's degree in
mechanical engineering from Tsing Hua, will receive a gold medal
in addition to NT$800,000 (US$24,177) cash award, according to an
executive of the Hiwin Technologies Corp. which sponsors the
prize.
</P>
<P>
Tsai developed the method to predict the rupture location of
hemangiomas in the brain based on the theory that the development
of tumors on blood vessel will inevitably change the blood flow
in the vessel, and thereby betray their existence.
</P>
<P>
With the help of the Veterans General Hospital in Taipei, Tsai
analyzed the brain images, made by magnetic resonance imaging
angiography, of patients who suffered from the burst of
hemangiomas , and found regular subtle changes in blood flow of
these patients.
</P>
<P>
Based on his analyses, Tsai can predict with an accuracy of
between 60 percent and 80 percent, the rupture place of the blood
vessel tumors and thereby help with their diagnosis.
