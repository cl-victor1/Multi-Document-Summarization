ANTI-CONSTIPATION DRUG SALES HALTED DUE TO SIDE EFFECTS

Taipei,  April 1 (CNA) 04/01/07  18:25:12 (By Y.L. Kao)

The Department of Health (DOH) has revoked the commercial license
for Zelmac, a drug for women to relieve constipation, and
demanded an immediate recall of the drug from store shelves
because it may cause angina and raise the chances of stroke and
heart diseases, an official said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The DOH imposed the sales ban after the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) revoked import licenses of the drug and
requested that the Swiss pharmaceutical maker Novartis, which
makes Zelmac, suspended sales of the drug due to side effects it
may cause, the official added.
</P>
<P>
Zelmac, which is currently available in more than 30 countries,
gained regulatory approval for sale in Taiwan's market in 2003,
according to the official.
</P>
<P>
Since the use of Zelmac is not covered in the National Health
Insurance Program and the number of users is limited, the DOH
estimates that not many people will be affected by the suspension
of the sales of the drug, which is used mainly for short-term
treatment of women under the age of 65 with constipation-
predominant irritable bowel syndrome, the official said.
</P>
<P>
The DOH official urged those taking the drug to consult with
their doctors to see whether they should find alternative drugs,
while calling on those taking Zelmac and seeing the symptoms of
angina and other heart diseases to inform the DOH via the
National Reporting System of Adverse Drug Reactions in Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the Novartis in Taiwan said that his company
decided to pull the drug off of shelves in Taiwan's market in
response to the DOH demand. According to a U.S. study, 13 out of
11,600 patients treated with Zelmac suffered potentially ischemia
heart disease and angina as compared to one out of 7,000 people
treated with placebos.
</P>
<P>
The Novartis said the statistically significant imbalance of
cardiovascular events between patients taking Zelmac and those
taking a placebo prompted the FDA to take the action.
