<P>
The screening process will soon begin to select the winners of
the 2007 eminence and excellence awards for elementary and junior
high schools with the best energy education programs, Bureau of
Energy officials under the Ministry of Economic Affairs said
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The bureau's annual selection of award winners is now in its
ninth year. The deadline for submitting entries for this year is
set for April 2.
</P>
<P>
National Taiwan Normal University, organizer of the event, will
invite experts from different sectors to screen applicants in
three stages.
</P>
<P>
One school each from Taiwan's northern, central, southern and
eastern regions will emerge as an eminence award winner. The four
winners will each receive a citation and a NT$100,000 cash prize.
</P>
<P>
Four additional winners of the excellence awards will be selected
from the four regions. They will each get NT$50,000 plus a
citation.
</P>
<P>
The Bureau of Energy initiated the school energy education awards
program in 1999 as part of Taiwan's support for international
efforts -- represented by the Kyoto Protocol -- to slow global
warming.
</P>
<P>
To date, 169 countries have joined the protocol, which became
effective in February 2006, with the notable exceptions of the
United States and Australia.
</P>
<P>
Although Taiwan is not a signatory to the protocol,  the
government in Taipei has taken a series of positive steps,
including drawing up a plan to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to
the 2000 levels by 2020.
