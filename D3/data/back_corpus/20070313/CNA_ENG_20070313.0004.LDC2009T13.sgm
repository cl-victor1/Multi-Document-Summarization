A total of 15 hopefuls registered their candidacy for the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party's (DPP's) legislative primary Monday
on the first of registration.
</P>
<P>
Three of them -- former Legislator Shen Fu-hsiung, incumbent
Legislator-at large Hsueh Ling and former Changhua County
Magistrate Wong Chin-chu -- threw their hats into the ring for
the party nomination for at-large legislative seats.
</P>
<P>
The remaining 12 registered their candidacy for the nomination
race for regional seats. Among them were Chen Ching-chun, Tsao
Lai-wang and Wu Ping-jui who will run in Taipei County's fourth
constituency and 12th constituency, respectively.
</P>
<P>
According to the DPP's work schedule, registration for the
legislative primary will run until March 16, and a party member
vote on the presidential and legislative candidates will be held
May 6 simultaneously, to be followed by a series of public
opinion polls from May 11 through June 17. The party's
legislative nomination list will be unveiled June 20.
</P>
<P>
Under the DPP's primary mechanism, the party's presidential and
legislative candidates are selected based on the results of a
party member vote, which accounts for 30 percent of their score,
and in a series of public opinion polls, which accounts for 70
percent.
</P>
<P>
The year-end legislative election will adopt a "single-member
constituency, two votes" electoral system for the first time,
under which the number of legislative seats will be almost halved
to 113 from the current 225.
