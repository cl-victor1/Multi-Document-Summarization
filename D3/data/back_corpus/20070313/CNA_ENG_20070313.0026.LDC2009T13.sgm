The quasi-official Taiwan External Trade Development Council
(TAITRA) is inviting local manufacturers to take part in trade
consultations with a South Korean delegation that will visit the
nation late this month to procure Taiwan- made products, a TAITRA
official said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
According to the official, the 68-member delegation, organized by
the Korea International Trade Association (KITA) is scheduled to
arrive in Taiwan March 27 at the invitation of TAITRA and the
Bureau of Foreign Trade (BOFT) under the Ministry of Economic
Affairs.

<P>
Among those products the delegation are planning to procure will
be farm produce, foods, chemical raw materials and related
products, cosmetics,  textile products, metal and hardware,  hand
tools, machinery, consumer electronics, electric apparatus,
electronic parts and components, computers and peripheral
equipment, the official said.

<P>
KITA, founded in 1946, is one of South Korea's five major
industrial and business organizations and has more than 85,000
member manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
The official said both TAITRA and BOFT have invited South Korean
manufacturers to purchase Taiwan-made products over the past year
in an effort to help reduce Taiwan's trade deficit with that
country.

According to official statistics, two-way trade volume for the
January-November period of 2006 amounted to US$19.91 billion, up
15.7 percent year-on-year. Taiwan exported US$6.22 billion worth
of products to South Korea, up 22.9 percent, while imports from
that country rose by 12.7 percent to US$13.69 billion, leaving a
trade surplus of US$7.47 billion in South Korea's favor.
