Taiwan's cosmetics market has grown in recent years with more and
more Taiwanese young ladies, especially those born in the 1980s,
preferring to leave home wearing make-up, a representative of the
industry said Tuesday.

<P>
According to the representative, the annual revenue of Taiwan's
cosmetics and skin care industry is estimated to be roughly NT$60
billion. Some 70-80 percent of that is captured by the sale of
skin care products, while 20-30 percent goes to growing sales of
make-up products.

<P>
To increase their competitiveness in the growing make-up sector,
famous cosmetics brands have developed their spring/summer
products with new designs and new marketing to make their
products more attractive.

<P>
Department stores' brands like MAC presented its Barbie-style
make-up with daring colors to meet the needs of young ladies who
admire European and American fashion trends. Another brand,
Guerlain, invited Taiwan's leading make-up artist Wang Wei-hsiang
to promote its various new products.

<P>
Open-shelf brand, Revlon presented new make-up with a shiny
texture preferred by Asian women, while Shiseido launched its own
open-shelf brand, INTEGRATE, modeled by international superstar
Angelina Jolie.

<P>
These brands, and many more, local or international, all hope to
increase the reliance of women on cosmetics to expand their
revenues in Taiwan's promising cosmetics industry, the
representative said.
