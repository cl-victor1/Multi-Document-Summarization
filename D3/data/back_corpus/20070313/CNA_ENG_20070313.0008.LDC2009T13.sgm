NO DIFFERENCE IN LEGAL STANCES ON TWO MAYORAL FUND CASES:
PROSECUTOR
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taipei,  March 13 (CNA) 03/13/07  12:16:38 (By Sofia Wu)
</P>
<P>
A senior prosecutor said Tuesday he sees no inconsistencies in
the legal stances adopted by Taipei and Tainan district
prosecutors in dealing with two mayors' alleged misuse of their
special allowance funds.
</P>
<P>
Chen Jui-jen, a prosecutor with the Anti-Corruption Center under
the Taiwan High Prosecutors Office, made the remarks after the
Tainan Prosecutors Office decided Monday not to file any charges
against Tainan Mayor Hsu Tien-tsai over allegations that he had
misused a special allowance fund budgeted for his discretionary
use.
</P>
<P>
The decision immediately drew "legal incoherence" criticism
against prosecution authorities as the Taipei Prosecutors Office
had indicted former Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou last month on
charges of lining his own pockets with NT$11.17 million
(US$337,650) from a special allowance fund set aside for his
discretionary use during his two mayoral terms from 1998 to 2006.
</P>
<P>
Arguing that the criticism was indefensible, Chen said there are
no discrepancies or inconsistencies between the legal viewpoints
and judgment standards applied in the two cases.
</P>
<P>
In the Hsu case, Chen said, prosecutors found that the total
amount that Hsu had spent on rewarding Tainan City government
staff and volunteers as well as on giveaways for official
purposes and charity donations far exceeded the accumulated
reimbursements from the mayor's special allowance fund. It was
based on this finding that the prosecutors determined that Hsu
had not lined his pockets with public funds, he explained.
</P>
<P>
As to the Ma case, Chen said, prosecutors discovered that a large
part of his special allowance fund was not spent and instead
deposited in his personal bank account. Ma was therefore indicted
on embezzlement charges, he explained, adding that there were not
any divergences in the legal stands of the respective prosecutors
in the two cases.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on a description presented by the prosecutor in charge
of the Hsu case in a written document that the special mayoral
allowance fund is basically a "substantial subsidy" for the
mayor, Chen said he would respect the prosecutor's view.
</P>
<P>
However, Chen also said that if the discretionary allowance fund
for mayors and other senior officials is truly a personal
"subsidy, " the same prosecutor should not have charged Hsu Tien-
tsai's former deputy, Hsu Yang-ming, with embezzlement over his
supposed use of false receipts to claim reimbursements from the
special allowance fund budgeted for his discretionary use during
his tenure as deputy mayor of the southern city.
</P>
<P>
"If the special allowance fund is a personal subsidy for senior
officials as mentioned by the prosecutor in the Hsu Tien-tsai
case, Hsu Yang-ming should have been charged with document
forgery instead of embezzlement, " Chen contended, adding that
this discrepancy serves to indicate that the prosecutor saw the
special allowance fund as designated for "official purposes"
only.
</P>
<P>
On the Tainan prosecutor's claim that treating senior officials'
special allowance funds as a personal "subsidy" is a longstanding
"administrative precedent," Chen said that this is not true.
</P>
<P>
"Not all senior officials deal with their discretionary special
allowance funds as a personal 'subsidy' that can be used to line
their own pockets. For instance, Yen Ta-ho, chief prosecutor of
the Taipei Prosecutors Office, has consistently reimbursed any
spending from his special allowance fund with corresponding sales
invoices or receipts," Chen said.
</P>
<P>
To the best of his understanding, Chen further said, many other
senior officials have done likewise. "Therefore, the
'administrative precedent' doctrine is unjustifiable," he added.
</P>
<P>
For years, senior officials, including department heads and
elected officials, have been offered special allowance funds to
cover spending on rewards for aides or entertainment for official
purposes. Chen said whether the Legislative Yuan should enact a
law to more strictly regulate the use of the special funds is a
political issue that is not a concern of judicial authorities.
</P>
<P>
"We prosecutors deal with all relevant cases only in terms of
existing laws and statutes," Chen pointed out.
</P>
<P>
The use of senior officials' special allowance funds has become a
focus of public concern since the indictment of first lady Wu
Shu-jen last November on charges of forgery and corruption for
allegedly using other people's invoices to claim reimbursements
from President Chen Shui-bian's special "state affairs fund" as
well as the indictment of Ma on the charge of corruption in
February for allegedly misusing his mayoral special allowance
fund.
</P>
<P>
The Anti-Corruption Center of the Taiwan High Prosecutors Office
is still investigating  similar cases involving many prominent
political figures, including Vice President Annette Lu, Premier
Su Tseng-chang and Judicial Yuan President Weng Yueh-sheng.
