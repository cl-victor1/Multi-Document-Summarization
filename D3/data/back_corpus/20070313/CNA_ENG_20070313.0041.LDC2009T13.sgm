The golden duo of world-renowned violist Kim Kashkashian and
pianist Robert Levin will perform at Taipei City's National
Concert Hall and Hsinchu City's Municipal Auditorium March 14 and
15 respectively, a spokesman for Taiwan's Philharmonia Moment
Musical (PMM) said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The two musicians' performance in Taipei will feature the
violist's performance,  with Levin's piano accompaniment.  The
repertoire will include Clarke's Sonata for Viola and Piano,
Brahms' Sonata for Viola and Piano in E Flat Major. They will
work with PMM in Hsinchu to present concertos including Mozart's
Piano Concerto No. 25 in C Major.
</P>
<P>
Kashkashian and Levin started their partnership while playing
Shumann 20 years ago. Their inclination in performance is to be
faithful to composers' original compositions and not to flavor a
musical work with personal preferences.

<P>
According to the spokesman, Kashkashian is extraordinarily
praised for expressing a sharp intellect, brilliant musical
rhetoric, and exquisite aesthetics while performing the 20th-
century repertoire at which she excels.
</P>
<P>
Levin is a specialist in performance practice and a professor at
Harvard University. He is renowned and embraced by innumerable
fans for his restoration of the Classical period performance
practice, improvised embellishments and cadenzas.
</P>
<P>
Kashkashian and Levin's long-term dual combination has won music
lovers' heart, the spokesman said, adding that music critiques
praised on their tacit understanding in performance, and
described their performance "as beautiful as singing."
