PREMIER DENIES MENTIONING 'RELOCATING' CAPITAL
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  March 13 (CNA) 03/13/07  21:55:56 (By Flor Wang)

Premier Su Tseng-chang denied Tuesday using the expression
"relocating the capital" and promised that he will not pronounce
such words in future campaigning for the next presidency or
stumping for ruling party's legislative candidates.
</P>
<P>
Su made the remarks during a question-and-answer session at the
Legislative Yuan while responding to main opposition Kuomintang
(KMT) Legislator Kao Szu-po on the relocation issue, which has
stirred up debate in society after President Chen Shui-bian said
early this year that some central government agencies, rather
than the capital itself, are well suited for relocation to
central or southern regions. Kao apparently understood this to be
a reference to relocating the capital.

<P>
According to Su, relocating the capital or government agencies
outside of Taipei are two totally different matters. Relocating
the capital would be a very big deal, while moving certain
government agencies or state-run enterprises to central or
southern Taiwan should be weighed according to their functions,
he explained.

<P>
"Either task needs to be carefully gauged over time and cannot be
decided upon overnight," he said.
</P>
<P>
However, Su said, it would also be good in some ways to move some
central government agencies to central or southern Taiwan in view
of the high land and housing prices in Taipei.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the question of which central government agencies
should be relocated, Su said only that it is a topic worthy of
in-depth exploration and rational assessment.
</P>
<P>
The president and the ruling Democratic Progressive Party have
recently renewed a name change drive for state-run enterprises
and facilities and have rekindled the government agencies
relocation issue.
</P>
<P>
Several state-owned companies, including the nation's petroleum
company, shipbuilding corporation and postal service provider,
have changed their official designations over the past few
months, while a few state-run concerns, such as Taiwan Power
Company and CPC Corp. Taiwan, have been pushed to relocate to
southern Taiwan, including Kaohsiung City.
</P>
<P>
Thus far, Taiwan Sugar Co. is the sole state-owned business to
have moved its headquarters from Taipei to southern Tainan in
line with the central government's policy.
