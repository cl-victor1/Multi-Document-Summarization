A task force consisting of Coast Guard Administration (CGA)
officials and Kaohsiung city police seized 8.64 kg of smuggled
heroin, with an estimated street value of NT$100 million (US$3.03
million), at a house in Kaohsiung Tuesday.

<P>
The CGA's Kaohsiung  mobile  unit disclosed  that the law
enforcement agents raided a residence in Kaohsiung's Chienchin
District and found 23 heroin bricks belonging to a man surnamed
Yeh, who owns a company that imports pottery items from Thailand.

<P>
Officials of the unit said the CGA received tip-offs that Yeh,
whose electrical engineering company had collapsed, used his
import business as a cover for his heroin smuggling operation.

A task force was then formed to place Yen under surveillance
after he went to Bangkok in early March to import pottery, the
officials said.

<P>
Yeh was referred to the Kaohsiung Public Prosecutors Office on
charges of violating the Narcotics Endangerment Prevention Act.
