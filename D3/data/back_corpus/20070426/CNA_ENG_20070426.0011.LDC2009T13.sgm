</HEADLINE>

<P>
Taipei,  April  26 (CNA) 04/26/07  15:57:19 (By Deborah Kuo)

<P>
Minister of the Interior Lee Yi-yang refused to say Thursday
whether  the plan to grant sentence commutations to prison
inmates will be implemented May 20, saying only that all matters
in this regard will be conducted in accordance with the law.
</P>
<P>
After President Chen Shui-bian instructed the Executive Yuan
Tuesday to work out a plan for a national amnesty, the Ministry
of Justice (MOJ) produced a preliminary draft of a national
sentence commutation bill that same day, Lee said, adding that
the MOJ will consult the Interior Ministry before referring the
draft bill to the Executive Yuan May 2 for approval.
</P>
<P>
If the draft bill is approved by the Executive Yuan, it will then
be submitted for deliberation by the Legislative Yuan, paving the
way for its implementation, Lee said.
</P>
<P>
Lee noted that the draft bill will only commute sentences for
criminals serving time for minor offenses, adding that it will
not commute capital sentences to life sentences nor include those
convicted of serious crimes and crimes that endanger society.
Crimes against the Prevention and Punishment of Sex-Trade Act and
special financial crimes will also be excluded, he added.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks during an interpellation session at the
Legislative Home and Nations Committee.
</P>
<P>
The previous commutation was meted out in Taiwan 16 years ago to
celebrate the 80th anniversary of the founding of the Republic of
China.
</P>
<P>
Chen said recently that another commutation is appropriate for
this year, as it is the 20th anniversary of the lifting of
martial law and the 60th anniversary of the 228 Incident.
</P>
<P>
More than 10,000 prison inmates are expected to benefit if the
bill is passed.
