Taipei,  April  26 (CNA) 04/26/07  22:04:03 (By Ruth Wang)

<P>
Taiwan has been ranked the 6th most favorable investment market
among 50 countries, according to an evaluation report released
Thursday by the Business Environment Risk Intelligence (BERI).
</P>
<P>
Ranked after Switzerland, Singapore, the Netherlands, Japan and
Norway, Taiwan received 72 points from the BERI for its
investment environment, and rated as a Grade A1 environment --
the highest grade available -- indicating a country with low
risks and a positive investment environment.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan's ranking in this, the first evaluation of 2007, is
consistent with the previous evaluation from the latter part of
2006.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan's operational risk index was only lower than that of
Switzerland and Singapore, its remittance and repatriation factor
ranked 5th, while its political risk index was ranked 15th,
moving down one point due to the upcoming year-end legislative
election.
</P>
<P>
The BERI expects continuous improvement in Taiwan's general
investment environment, with ranking remaining unchanged but
growing to 73 point within one year, and 74 points in five years.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the BERI forecasts that Taiwan's operational risk index
will be stable or improve during 2007-2008, and that the Gross
Domestic Product (GDP) will increase thanks to a vigorous supply
and demand market.
