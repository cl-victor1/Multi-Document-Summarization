President Chen Shui-bian made an inspection tour in Kaohsiung
County in southern Taiwan Thursday to hear the opinions of local
entrepreneurs regarding their businesses.
</P>
<P>
Accompanied by Presidential Office Deputy Secretary-General Cho
Jung-tai and Kaohsiung County Magistrate Yang Chiu-hsing, Chen
first visited Paokai Electronic  Enterprise  Co.,  which
manufactures electronic gaming machines and vending machines.
</P>
<P>
Paokai, which originally produced condom machines, diversified
into electronic gaming machines by designing its own chips. Now
the company has orders from countries around the world, mainly
Japan.
</P>
<P>
Chen later visited the Dafa Industrial Park, where he hailed the
enterprises established  in the  industrial  park  for  their
contributions to the country's economic development.
</P>
<P>
During a meeting,  some entrepreneurs  suggested  that the
government should not increase the minimum wage to a level that
is unbearable for entrepreneurs, a suggestion Chen said he would
pass on to the relevant agencies.
</P>
<P>
In Tashu village,  producer of high-quality pineapples and
lychees, Chen promised to serve as spokesman of Tashu village's
Yu Her Pao lychees at a pineapple and lychee festival scheduled
to open May 26.

<P>
Tsai Fu-ching, director of the Kaohsiung county government's
Agricultural Department, said that around 2,200 hectares around
the country is dedicated to the cultivation of Yu Her Pao
lychees, with Kaohsiung County accounting for 1,870 hectares, 65
percent of which is located in Tashu village.
</P>
<P>
After leaving Tashu village, Chen and his entourage visited a
famous eco- friendly park near Kaohsiung County's old bridge.
</P>
<P>
According to Yang, the park, occupying 120 hectares, includes 13
wetland areas, can manage the county's household and industrial
waste water by purifying it and them dumping it into rivers. It
is also the habitat of more than 100 species of birds.
</P>
<P>
With the help of volunteer bird-watchers, Chen watched some of
the birds and praised the park for combining ecological, economic
and tourism functions.
