CHINA PANNED OVER OPPOSITION TO TAIWAN'S WHO BID
</HEADLINE>

Taipei, April 26 (CNA) 04/26/07  14:15:10 (By Sofia Wu)

The Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) slammed China Thursday over
its opposition to Taiwan's bid to join the World Health
Organization (WHO) , saying China's hidebound intolerance toward
Taiwan people's desire for inclusion into the global health care
system signifies its contempt for human rights.
</P>
<P>
The MAC, a Cabinet-level body in charge of Taiwan's China policy
planning, issued the press statement after China unleashed ugly
invective the day before against Taiwan's WHO membership bid.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for China's Taiwan Affairs Office said Wednesday that
Beijing strongly opposes Taiwan's new bid to join the WHO under
the name of "Taiwan" because Taiwan, as part of China, is not
eligible to join the WHO as a member or quasi-member.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman also claimed that Taiwan is not qualified to join
the World Health Assembly (WHA) , the WHO's highest decision-
making body, as an observer. The statement further accused Taiwan
of using the WHO bid as a ploy aimed at elevating its pro-
independence secessionist activities to an international forum.
</P>
<P>
In response, the MAC deplored in the press statement China's
obstinate bigotry against the reality that the two sides of the
Taiwan Strait do not belong to each other.
</P>
<P>
Noting that health care is a basic human right, the MAC statement
said epidemics prevention and control know no borders or
political doctrines and stances.
</P>
<P>
With an overwhelming majority of the 23 million Taiwan people
keenly yearning for their country's participation in the WHO, the
MAC statement warned China that its indifference to their health
rights as shown in its persistent obstruction of Taiwan's WHO
membership bid will only enrage them and drive the two sides of
the Taiwan strait further apart.
</P>
<P>
Since 1997, Taiwan's annual drives to become an observer at the
WHA as a "health entity" have invariably been thwarted by
Beijing. This year, Taiwan adopted a new strategy, with President
Chen Shui-bian writing to the WHO Secretariat to express Taiwan's
intention to join the WHO as a full member under the name of
"Taiwan." Due to China's opposition, the bid failed again.
</P>
<P>
In the press statement, the MAC also condemned China for denying
a visa to Kaohsiung City Deputy Mayor Cheng Wen-lung to attend an
annual meeting of the General Association of International Sports
Federations (GAISF) which opened in Beijing Wednesday. Cheng
originally planned to take advantage of the event to brief the
participants on progress in preparations for the 2009 World Games
to be hosted by Taiwan's southern port city.
</P>
<P>
The MAC urged the international sports community to pay heed to
China's perennial obstruction of Taiwan's attempts to participate
in international activities, even such non-political ones as the
GAISF.
</P>
<P>
On the April 28-29 economic and cultural forum to be held in
Beijing under the auspices of Taiwan's main opposition Kuomintang
and the Communist Party of China, the MAC said the event is just
another example of China's "divide and conquer" tactics against
Taiwan. The MAC reminded Beijing that its scheme to debase
Taiwan's popularly elected government by collaborating with
Taiwan's opposition party will never succeed and will turn out to
be a disservice to cross-strait relations.
</P>
<P>
For the well-being of both sides of the Taiwan Strait, the MAC
statement said, Beijing should resume dialogue with Taiwan's
legally elected government on a range of issues of mutual
concern, including opening Taiwan to Chinese tourists and
launching of more cross-strait charter flights, so that bilateral
relations can move in a positive, peaceful and stable direction.
