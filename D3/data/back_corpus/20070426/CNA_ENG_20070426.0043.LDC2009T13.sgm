Taipei,  April 26 (CNA) 04/26/07  21:21:42 (By Elizabeth Hsu)

<P>
The Taipei county government signed a cooperation agreement with
National Taiwan University (NTU) Wednesday aimed at instilling
science and technology into disaster prevention and post-disaster
rehabilitation.
</P>
<P>
County Magistrate Chou Hsih-wei signed the agreement with NTU
President Lee Si- chen on the cooperative ties, which involve the
two sides jointly working out plans to train local communities in
skills and know-how needed in disaster prevention and rescue
operations.
</P>
<P>
The two parties will also collaborate with each other in
integrating data banks on disaster control and prevention,
mapping out a plan to evacuate personnel in case of massive
landslides, and develop a flood warning system, according to the
county fire department.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the event, Chou said it's the county government's duty
to safeguard the lives of residents and their property, and
natural disasters such as typhoons, earthquakes and landslide
have been occurring more frequently in the past few years.
</P>
<P>
Against that backdrop, Chou said his government budgeted NT$9
million this year to continue its work with NTU in upgrading
disaster prevention  operations through  the  application  of
advanced technologies. The work was undertaken as a part of the
central government-initiated national technology program on
disaster control and prevention, which ended last year.
