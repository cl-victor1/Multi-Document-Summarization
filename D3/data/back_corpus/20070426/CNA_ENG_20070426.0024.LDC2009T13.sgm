The proposed national commutation of sentences will apply only to
prisoners serving sentences of less than one year, Democratic
Progressive Party caucus whip Ker Chien-ming said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Ker said the planned amnesty will reduce sentences for prisoners
who "unintentionally" committed minor crimes, but will not affect
sentences of those convicted of serious crimes that endanger
society, such as murder, corruption, sexual assault or economic
crime.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Justice is drafting a commutation statute in line
with President Chen Shui-bian's directive to implement a
reduction of sentences to acknowledge the 20th anniversary of the
lifting of martial law and the 60th anniversary of the 228
incident.
</P>
<P>
The reduction of sentences will ease prison overcrowding and give
petty criminals the chance to start anew, Ker said, adding that
64,000 inmates are imprisoned in Taiwan's jails, which are
designed to hold only 53,000 prisoners.
</P>
<P>
Criminals who committed crimes or received verdicts or
indictments before a certain date might be eligible for the
amnesty, although exact dates have not yet been decided, Ker
said.
</P>
<P>
The MOJ will submit the draft of the National Commutation Bill of
2007 to the Executive Yuan session May 2 for approval, after
which it will be sent to the Legislative Yuan for deliberation.
