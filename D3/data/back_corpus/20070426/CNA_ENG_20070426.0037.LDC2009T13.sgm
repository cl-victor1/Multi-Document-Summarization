POLICE CHIEF AGAINST AMNESTY FOR VIOLENT CRIMINALS
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,   April   26   (CNA) 04/26/07  20:20:59 (By Flor Wang)

National  Police  Agency  (NPA) Director-General Hou Yu-ih said
Thursday that he is against granting amnesty or reducing jail
terms to those convicted of violent crimes or under a sentence of
death.
</P>
<P>
Hou made the comments during a question-and-answer session in the
Legislative Yuan in response to questions from a group of the
main opposition Kuomintang lawmakers who are concerned that
demonstrating leniency would deal a blow to public order and
assert that most of the rank-and-file policemen are opposed to
the idea.
</P>
<P>
Under instructions from President Chen Shui-bian,  relevant
government agencies recently proposed an act to reduce prison
terms or a partial amnesty for criminals. One of the authorities'
arguments in support of the idea is that "all the prisons are
packed."
</P>
<P>
Hou replied that the NPA has not conducted polls to gauge the
opinions of grass- roots policemen and said that he would not
oppose reduced terms for those convicted of minor offenses
carrying a sentence of less than one year.
</P>
<P>
But Hou added that in his capacity as the highest police officer
charged with maintaining the rule of law and public order across
the country, he would "object" to the proposed amnesty if it were
to include those convicted of violent offenses.
</P>
<P>
"Granting amnesty must not hinder public order or social morals,"
he said, adding that "we would clarify our position and offer
recommendations if the there were a chance that the proposed
amnesty might affect public order."
