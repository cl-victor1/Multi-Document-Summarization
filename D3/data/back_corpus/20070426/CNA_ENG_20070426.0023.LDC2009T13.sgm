<P>
Only 11 percent of recent graduates in Taiwan consider themselves
to enjoy an advantage because of their foreign language ability,
although many agree the ability is crucial to their
competitiveness in the job market, according to the results of a
survey released Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The survey was conducted by the Council of Labor Affairs' Bureau
of Employment and Vocational Training from March 5-27 among 3,287
job-seekers and 492 employers.
</P>
<P>
The survey found that 85 percent of new graduates had begun to
look for jobs before graduating and the electronics, information
technology and service industries are the most popular employment
fields.
</P>
<P>
However, 13 percent of the employers said they are not hiring new
graduates because they lack experience and because there are few
positions suitable for them.
</P>
<P>
The survey shows that in addition to academic background and
proficiency on the part of job applicants, the major criteria
used by employers in hiring workers also include sales ability,
professional skills, computer skills and foreign language
ability.
</P>
<P>
While 58 percent of the new graduates surveyed said they believe
a higher education background will facilitate their job searches,
46 percent of the employers said the educational background of
job applicants will affect their hiring decisions.
</P>
<P>
However, most of the employers surveyed do not care whether job
applicants are graduates of famous universities or not, with 52
percent saying there is no direct connection between their hiring
decision and the universities  from which the applicants have
graduated.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, 33 percent of the employers said they will not hire
job applicants who are self-righteous and arrogant, 27 percent
will reject applicants who are unable to express themselves
clearly and 20 percent will say no to those who lack manners.
