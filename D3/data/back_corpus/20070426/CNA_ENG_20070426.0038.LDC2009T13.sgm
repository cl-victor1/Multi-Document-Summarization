Exports of Taiwan's pharmaceutical products increased NT$620
million (US$18.6 million) during the last year for a year-on-year
growth of 4 percent, according to the statistics released by the
Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Officials  of MOEA's Industrial  Development  Bureau  (IDB)
attributed the growth in exports to the 2005 establishment of
three alliances for pharmaceutical product exports targeting
markets in United States, Europe and Japan, which collectively
account for more than 80 percent of the global pharmaceutical
market.
</P>
<P>
Officials noted that the establishment of the three alliances,
under the coordination  of Pharmaceutical  Industry  Technology
Development Center (PITDC), have helped local pharmaceutical
products manufacturers set up their own brands and strengthen
their marketing in global markets.
</P>
<P>
In addition to helping local companies better understand American
pharmaceutical enterprises' preferences, the alliances are also
assisting domestic firms to develop a presence in the European
market as early as possible, the officials added.
</P>
<P>
The efforts of the export alliances have encouraged some domestic
groups to invest more than NT$200 million in biotechnology
industry and several others are negotiating business with British
firms, which is expected to result in new orders worth NT$300
million, according to the officials.
