In view of the growing eating-out market, convenience store
chains have developed new practices to grab a larger share of the
market, which is estimated to be worth NT$140 billion (US$4.2
billion) a year, market sources said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Billions of dollars are now being spent on eating outside the
home, the market sources said, adding that in addition to
convenience stores, hypermarket chains and restaurants are also
eyeing the market.
</P>
<P>
However, based on their distribution channels, convenience store
chains take the lion's share, offering millions of boxed meals
annually.
</P>
<P>
Among them, the 7-Eleven chain supplied 60 million boxed meals
last year, while the Hi-Life chain, with over 1,000 affiliated
stores, sells an average of 7 million annually, according to the
sources.

<P>
The revenue stream from 7-Eleven's fresh food amounts to NT$14
billion, representing a 10 percent share of the eating-out
market. To extend its market share, 7-Eleven has recently
launched new and diversified boxed meals.
</P>
<P>
A 7-Eleven spokesman added that the chain hopes to reach the goal
of selling 70 million boxes in 2007 and expand to 100 million
boxes annually in the near future.
</P>
<P>
The stores will continue to widen their appeal by developing
diversified menus and offering fresh products, the spokesman
said.
