NT$20 BILLION TO BE SPENT OVER TWO YEARS ON WASTEWATER TREATMENT
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  May 2 (CNA) 05/02/07  21:04:18 (By Han Nai-kuo)
</P>
<P>
The government will spend NT$20 billion (US$601.05 million) over
the next two years to increase the rate of the nation's urban
wastewater treatment from the current 34 percent to 40 percent,
officials from the Ministry of the Interior said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The officials at the ministry's Construction and Planning Agency
noted that Taichung made the greatest progress among all cities
last year, with a household sewer connection rate of 13.56
percent and a wastewater treatment rate of 24.47 percent.
</P>
<P>
They admitted that Taichung still has a long way to go to catch
up with other cities, as it lags far behind the two largest
cities in Taiwan -- Taipei and Kaohsiung -- whose household sewer
connections reached 85 percent and 70 percent respectively by the
end of last year.
</P>
<P>
In 2008, the Taichung city government will spend NT$900 million,
including NT$700 million funded by the central government, to
increase the central city's sewer connection rate to 19 percent
-- higher than the national average at 15.58 percent -- and
contribute significantly in enhancing the nation's urban
wastewater treatment rate from 34 percent to 40 percent, the
officials said.
</P>
<P>
They admitted that Taiwan had not paid enough attention to the
construction of sewer systems in the past years, and that was why
in terms of wastewater treatment, Taiwan ranked 52nd among 59
countries with populations exceeding 20 million in a 2003 survey
by the International Institute for Management Development in
Lausanne, Switzerland.
