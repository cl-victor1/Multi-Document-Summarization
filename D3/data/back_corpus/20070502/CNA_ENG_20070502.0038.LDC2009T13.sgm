DPP PRESIDENTIAL HOPEFUL TALKS ON RE-POSITIONING A GLOBAL TAIWAN
</HEADLINE>

Taipei, May 2 (CNA) 05/02/07  18:57:22 (By Chris Wang)
</P>
<P>
Vice President Annette Lu, who is seeking the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party's (DPP's) nomination to run for the next
presidency, told CNA Wednesday in an extensive interview that it
is important for Taiwan to re-position itself and that she looks
forward to leading Taiwan onto a global stage.
</P>
<P>
"Taiwan needs to define and re-position itself in a historical
context, as well as in its relationship with the People's
Republic of China and the Republic of China. Taiwan will never be
able to walk out of the mire of independence versus unification
with China without re-positioning itself accurately, " she said.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan became de jure independent March 23, 1996, the day of
Taiwan's first direct presidential election, she claimed, saying
that she will push for normalization of the country, which
includes the campaign to change the names of companies with the
word China in the title and to replace the Constitution, instead
of being trapped in the debate of independence versus
unification.
</P>
<P>
Lu, who attended Harvard Law School and devoted herself to
constitutional study, said that it would be very difficult to
amend the Constitution under current regulations.
</P>
<P>
"In the long term, we need to launch a comprehensive and complete
constitutional education for Taiwan citizens. The second step
would be drafting the framework of a new constitution with help
from professional scholars, " she said, adding that the
constitutional system of Japan and the U.S. might not be suitable
for Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Instead, Taiwan can learn from a number of welfare countries in
Northern Europe, such as the Netherlands,  whose backgrounds,
territorial sizes and populations are similar to Taiwan, Lu said.
</P>
<P>
With her experience in participating in international affairs, Lu
went on, she will be able to march with Taiwan onto the global
stage.
</P>
<P>
"I am determined to make Taiwan a 'global Taiwan', instead of
'China's Taiwan' or 'Taiwan's Taiwan', " she said, reiterating
her vision for Taiwan while referring the perspectives of her DPP
counterparts and Ma Ying-jeou, who is expected to be the
nomination of the opposition Kuomintang (KMT) for the 2008
presidential election.
</P>
<P>
In terms of relations with China, Lu advocated a "3CO" policy
that Taiwan will seek co-existence, co-operation and co-
prosperity with China.
</P>
<P>
She said Taiwan should keep cultivating its high-tech and develop
a cultural creative industry to embrace the "new economy" in the
age of globalization.
</P>
<P>
As the DPP presidential primary drew to a close, Lu also lamented
the lack of fair competition in the campaign. Lu is the only
female in the four-man field, which also includes Premier Su
Tseng-chang, former DPP Chairman Yu Shyi-kun and former Premier
Frank Hsieh.
</P>
<P>
The DPP will by May 12 at the earliest determine its candidate
for the election. The presidential primary's public opinion poll
will take place from May 9-11 and will account for 70 percent of
the score in determining who will represent the party, with the
other 30 percent accounted through a vote by party members May 6.
