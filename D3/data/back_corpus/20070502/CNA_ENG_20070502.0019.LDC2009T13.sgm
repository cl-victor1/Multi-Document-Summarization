PRESIDEN TO REITERATE TAIWAN'S WHO BID: DIPLOMAT
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Washington,  May 2 (CNA) 05/02/07  16:11:03 (By Jorge Liu and
Flor Wang)
</P>
<P>
President Chen Shui-bian will write a letter to World Health
Organization (WHO) Director-General Margret Chan to reiterate
Taiwan's bid to join the world body as  "Taiwan," Republic of
China Representative to the United States Joseph Wu told
reporters in Washington, D.C. Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
According to Wu, Chen will write again to Chan after his April 11
letter containing the same idea to the new WHO director-general
was rejected due to strong pressure from Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Wu said that Taiwan's diplomatic allies will also speak out for
the country's WHO bid in the organization's May 17 annual
conference.
</P>
<P>
Apart from full WHO membership in the name of Taiwan, Wu said,
the country will seek to take part in some technical meetings
affiliated to the world body based on its "universal principles,
" such as becoming a member in the WHO response and monitoring
network of global epidemic outbreaks.
</P>
<P>
Stating that Taiwan's desire to enter the WHO has repeatedly been
blocked by China, Wu called on the international community to
back Taiwan's WHO bid for the sake of its 23 million people.
