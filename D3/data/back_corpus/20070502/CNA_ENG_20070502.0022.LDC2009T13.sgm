U.S. Deputy Secretary of State John Negroponte called Tuesday for
increased dialogue across the Taiwan Strait while expressing
concern about China's military deployment targeting Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
In particular, Negroponte urged Beijing to conduct direct talks
with Taiwan's democratically elected leaders.
</P>
<P>
"We are especially concerned about the growing arsenal of
missiles and other military systems arrayed against Taiwan, as
well as Beijing's refusal to renounce the use of force against
Taiwan, " Negroponte said while speaking before the Senate
Committee on Foreign Relations.
</P>
<P>
Noting that China's neighbors share U.S. questions about the lack
of transparency in China's military modernization, Negroponte
said China should be more open about its military budget,
doctrine and intentions.
</P>
<P>
He said there are six broad objectives for the U.S.-China
interactions, including maintaining peace and stability in East
Asia, sustaining economic growth in China and globally in
conformity with international rules of trade and investment while
ensuring energy security and protecting the environment, as well
as stemming the proliferation  of dangerous weapons and related
technology and combating terrorism and transnational crime.
</P>
<P>
The other objectives are safeguarding against the spread of
infectious  disease, including  pandemic influenza,  developing
effective international  responses to humanitarian crises,  and
promoting human rights and religious freedom, he said.
</P>
<P>
"The United States' policy is to encourage China to act as a
responsible and stabilizing influence in international affairs, "
he said.
</P>
<P>
On the human rights situation in China, Negroponte urged the
Chinese government to respect its citizens' right to speak, to
assemble and to publish, to worship freely and to plan their
families as they choose, and allow the Chinese people to have a
meaningful say in how they are governed.
</P>
<P>
According to Negroponte, the situation in Tibet remains an
important human rights and religious freedom concern for the
United States, as does the treatment of other minority
communities such as the Uighur Muslims in Xinjiang Province.
