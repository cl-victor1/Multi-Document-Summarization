Taipei, May 2 (CNA) 05/02/07  18:36:00 (By Lilian Wu)
</P>
<P>
Around 9,000 inmates will be released from prison on the first
day under a sentence commutation program which was passed by the
Executive Yuan Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The draft statute, which will be sent to the Legislative Yuan for
screening, set the date of planned implementation as June 30.
</P>
<P>
Chiang Huei-ming, director-general of the Department of
Prosecutorial Affairs under the Ministry of Justice, said that
judging from the number of inmates as of the end of March this
year, the number of those who were serving sentences of under one
year and who meet the conditions of commutation was around
10,072, while the number of those serving terms of more than one
year and who meet the conditions of sentence commutation was
15,130.
</P>
<P>
He said that 24 inmates who have been convicted and sentenced to
death will be excluded from the commutation, mainly because they
committed murder after raping, abducting or robbing their
victims.
</P>
<P>
Chiang also said the sentence commutation will apply to those who
committed crimes prior to April 24, when President Chen Shui-bian
instructed the Executive Yuan to study sentence commutation to
mark the 20th anniversary of the lifting of martial law and the
60th anniversary of the 228 Incident, which refers to a civilian
revolt that was met with bloody crackdown by the government.
</P>
<P>
Premier Su Tseng-chang noted that the sentence commutation
excludes those serving sentences for sexual assault, homicide,
drug dealing and trafficking, as well as major financial  crimes,
corruption and vote-buying.
</P>
<P>
The premier said the recidivism ratio of inmates released earlier
than their due time after commutation is between 16-19 percent,
while the recidivism ratio of those inmates who serve their full
sentences or who are released on parole is more than 40 percent
according to past surveys.
