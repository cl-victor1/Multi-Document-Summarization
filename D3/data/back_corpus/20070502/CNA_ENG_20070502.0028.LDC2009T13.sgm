HEALTH CHIEF REITERATES WHO BID EFFORTS

Taipei, May 2 (CNA) 05/02/07  17:25:44 (By Flor Wang)

Taiwan harbors strong aspirations to join the World Health
Organization (WHO) and the government is willing to give it
another try despite major obstacles, Department of Health (DOH)
Minister Hou Sheng-mou said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Hou made the remarks during a legislative committee while
answering questions from main opposition Kuomintang (KMT)
lawmaker Lai Shyh-bao,  who questioned whether it is feasible to
seek membership as "Chinese Taipei,"  now that the country has
succeeded in joining 16 world bodies in that name.
</P>
<P>
According to Lai, "Chinese Taipei" is far more feasible than
"Taiwan" in gaining membership of international organizations.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the idea, Hou said that the issue goes beyond his
power to elaborate on. In line with WHO regulations, membership
applications must be submitted to the World Health Assembly (WHA)
, the WHO's decision-making unit, one month prior to its annual
conference -- slated to open May 14 in Geneva this year.
</P>
<P>
Despite Taiwan's application having been repeatedly rejected by
the WHO due to pressure from Beijing, the health chief said that
the government will relentlessly continue moving toward the goal
for the sake of Taiwan's 23 million people.
