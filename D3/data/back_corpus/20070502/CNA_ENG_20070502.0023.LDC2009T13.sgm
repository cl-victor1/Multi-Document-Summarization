The government has decided to expand the scale of soft loans
provided to the domestic creative industry -- especially those
specializing in digital content and culture -- to foster local
companies' competitive advantage, Ministry of Economic Affairs
(MOEA) officials announced Wednesday.

<P>
According to the ministry, the target sectors include digital
entertainment, film-making, mass media, publishing, visual arts,
performing arts, advertising and design.
</P>
<P>
The maximum is NT$100 million (about US$3 million) per project,
with a grace period of one to three years and a payment period of
five to 15 years, they reported, adding that the floating
interest rate equals the sum of the mid-long term loan interest
rate plus up to 2 percent set by individual banks.
</P>
<P>
The current interest rate is set at no more than 4.2 percent,
they added.

<P>
According to the MOEA tallies, some NT$554 million in loans had
been granted up until the end of 2006.
