Taipei,  May  2 (CNA) 05/02/07  16:50:11 (By Deborah Kuo)

The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) expressed welcome
Wednesday to a U.S. congressional resolution introduced the day
before calling for the cancellation of all restrictions on visits
by high-ranking Taiwan officials to the United States.
</P>
<P>
MOFA spokesman Wang Chien-yeh said Taiwan is grateful and
welcomes the bipartisan resolution introduced by 16 members of
the U.S. House of Representatives calling for the end to the
restrictions.
</P>
<P>
The issue was raised by Rep. Steve Chabot, co-chair of the
Congressional Taiwan Caucus, in a hearing focusing on China
affairs in the House Foreign Affairs Committee.
</P>
<P>
In the bill, the congressmen suggested that the administration
comply with its obligations under the Immigration and Nationality
Technical Corrections Act of 1994, which stipulates that Taiwan's
president and other high-level officials shall be allowed to
visit the United States.
</P>
<P>
The proposed resolution pinpoints the Taiwan Strait as "one of
the world's flashpoints" and indicated that it is essential for
U.S. policy makers to directly communicate with Taiwan's leaders.
</P>
<P>
Despite close connections maintained between the two countries,
Wang said, the country's president, vice present, premier and
minister of foreign affairs and national defense are prohibited
from visiting Washington, D.C. under current U.S. administrative
regulations.
