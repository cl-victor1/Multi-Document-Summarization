KMT Chairman Wu Poh-hsiung announced the decision at a news

Flanked by the party's six vice chairmen and 15 city mayors and
county magistrates, Ma said at the news conference that he will
invite Legislative Speaker Wang Jin-pyng to be his running mate.

He also spelled out his vision for the country, topped by a
promise to improve the lives of the people.
