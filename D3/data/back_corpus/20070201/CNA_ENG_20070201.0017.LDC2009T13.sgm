The government has made developing renewable energy an important
policy and set a target of increasing the installed capacity of
renewable energy in the country to 12 percent of total production
by 2020, Minister of Economic Affairs Chen Ruey-long said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Chen said that although the development of renewable energy faces
various challenges, such as high production costs and
technological difficulties, the new policy will help Taiwan
realize its goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions and
increasing the ratio of domestically-produced energy.
</P>
<P>
The policy could also revitalize unplanted farmland and boost the
development of the biomass energy industry, Chen said.
</P>
<P>
Public buses in southern Kaohsiung City have started using
biodiesel, and the government will select two more counties or
cities in June to expand and promote the use of biodiesel, he
said.
</P>
<P>
By 2008, all diesel sold on the market will be a blend containing
1 percent of biomass diesel, with the content of biomass diesel
expected to increase to 3 percent by 2010, he said.
</P>
<P>
The minister made the remarks during a conference on the
development of renewable energy held by National Central
University's Research Center for Taiwan's Economic Development,
the Grace T.H.W Group, and an economics association.
</P>
<P>
Sharing the experience of Brazil during the conference, Brazilian
parliamentarian Luiss Piauhylino de Mello Monteiro said Brazil
started to experiment with blending gasoline and ethanol in 1925,
with the government offering incentives such as tax cuts and
production loans.
</P>
<P>
According to Piauhylino, Brazil is now the world's largest
producer and exporter of cane-based ethanol, the world's largest
consumer of fuel ethanol and the world's third largest consumer
of cane sugar.
</P>
<P>
Every year, Brazil produces 15 billion liters of ethanol, exports
19.6 million tons of cane sugar and 3.1 billion liters of
ethanol, which generates 12 billion reais (US$5.66 billion) in
annual revenue for the country, he said.
