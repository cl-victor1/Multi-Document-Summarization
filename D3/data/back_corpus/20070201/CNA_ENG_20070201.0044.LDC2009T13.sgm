Taipei, Feb. 1 (CNA) 02/01/07  21:33:08 (By Elisa Kao)

<P>
The National Communications Commission (NCC) decided at its
regular meeting Thursday to tell Jaw Shau-kong, former chairman
of UFO Radio, to explain where he got the capital for his recent
purchase of the Broadcasting Corporation of China (BCC)
</P>
<P>
The NCC members made the decision after listening to a report by
BCC executives on the transfer of the company's shares and the
change of its superintendent.
</P>
<P>
According to Broadcasting and Television Law, any change of
superintendents of broadcasting or television stations should be
approved by the NCC
</P>
<P>
As Jaw's purchase of the BCC -- worth billions of Taiwan dollars
-- through his four small companies, with capital of each
totalling only NT$20 million, has drawn strong criticism from the
public and many ruling Democratic Progressive Party legislators,
the NCC decided to demand an explanation from Jaw as to the
source of his capital in the deal with the opposition Kuomintang
(KMT) , the former owner of the BCC.
</P>
<P>
NCC Vice Chairman Shih Shih-hau said the commission has also
asked the National Security  Bureau and Financial  Supervisory
Commission for help by providing related information about Jaw's
capital.
