DPP, TSU STILL ALLIES: DPP HEAD
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  Feb.  1 (CNA) 02/01/07  21:44:51 (By Flor Wang)

Despite former President Lee Teng-hui's recent remarks about
Taiwan independence, the ruling Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) still views the opposition Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU) as
an ally, DPP Chairman Yu Shyi-kun said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Yu made the comments at a news conference after the Next Magazine
claimed that Lee, the so-called "spiritual leader" of the TSU in
the "pan-green camp" along with the DPP against the opposition
"pan-blue alliance" of the Kuomintang (KMT) and the People First
Party (PFP), has said in an interview that he hopes to visit
China, that he had abandoned the idea of Taiwan independence and
that he wants Taiwan to open up to Chinese tourists and capital.
</P>
<P>
Saying that he respects Lee very much, Yu pointed out, however,
that Lee' s performance must be judged by history and the Taiwan
people.
</P>
<P>
Lee's political career can be divided into two stages -- one in
Taiwan's democratic era and one in the preceding KMT era,
according to Yu.
</P>
<P>
Lee in the democratic era shared the same aspirations as the DPP
for Taiwan's formal independence, to be backed up by a new and
tailor-made constitution and a change of the country's official
designation, while Lee in the KMT's authoritarian era had nothing
in common with the DPP, he said.
</P>
<P>
"To date, I still believe in Lee, who remains devoted to Taiwan's
cause, " Yu said, claiming that the Taiwan people "will not
accept a politician or a political party that forswears Taiwan's
core values."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the TSU headquarters telephone switchboard was jammed
with callers wishing to voice their opinions of Lee's remarks,
TSU Secretary-General Lin Chih-chia said.
</P>
<P>
The TSU will also keep collaborating with the DPP if the ruling
party continues sticking to its principles  regarding Taiwan's
sovereignty, Lin added.
