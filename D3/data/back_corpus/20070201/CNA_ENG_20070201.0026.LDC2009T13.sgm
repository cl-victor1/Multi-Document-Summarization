TOP TAIPEI HEALTH OFFICIAL RESIGNS
</HEADLINE>

Taipei, Feb. 1 (CNA) 02/01/07  18:14:27 (By Deborah Kuo)

<P>
Taipei City Commissioner of Health Mark Sung quit his post as
Taipei's top health official Thursday, citing "disagreements with
Mayor Hau Lung-bin over public health policies" as the reason.
</P>
<P>
In a rather surprising move, Sung, who took up the health
commissioner post on Feb. 1, 2005, offered his resignation at a
news conference called around noon Thursday, saying that he
"feels saddened" over Hau's punishing intervention in the city's
public health policies and "sees no turning point at which his
ideals can be realized under Hau's leadership."
</P>
<P>
Sung, who holds a Ph.D. in immunology from Cornell University,
New York, said Hau's "arbitrary" decisions not to retain Taipei
City Hospital (TCH) Director Sun Jui-sheng and the firing of TCH
Hoping Branch Superintendent Chu Da-cheng in the wake of a
diagnosis dispute that occurred at the Hoping branch late last
year, were completely unacceptable.
</P>
<P>
Hau's strongly-worded criticism of the Taipei Department of
Health (TDH), at a city government meeting Wednesday for
"negligence" over the allegedly  illegal operation  of an after-
childbirth confinement and convalescence center in Taipei, and
his demand for a "name list" of TDH officials in charge of
related affairs, were moves tantamount to measures adopted during
Taiwan's "white terror" era, Sung said.
</P>
<P>
Sung, who was a professor with National Yang Ming University's
Institute of Anatomy and Cell Biology before joining the Taipei
city government, asked Hau to "find somebody smarter" to replace
him.
</P>
<P>
Later in the day, responding to Sung's surprising resignation,
Hau said Sung's move has indeed taken him by surprise. Hau said
he respects Sung's decision.
</P>
<P>
Hau, who assumed his mayorship just a month ago, added that
maintaining quality medical services is one of the priorities of
his city administration and there is still room for improvement
in this area.
