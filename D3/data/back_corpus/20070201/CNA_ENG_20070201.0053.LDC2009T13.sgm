Washington,  Feb.  1 (CNA) 02/01/07  23:54:32 (By Cheihyu Lin and

Disgraced Rebar Asia Pacific Group founder Wang You-theng left
the United States Wednesday along with his wife for Myanmar,
reliable sources said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
David Ta-wei Lee, the Republic of China's representative to the
United  States, confirmed  the information,  saying that U.S.
authorities twice informed his office of the couple's departure
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Quoting U.S. authorities, Lee said the Wangs departed Los Angeles
11 p.m. Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The sources said the disgraced couple are heading for Myanmar.
The sources, however, would not elaborate on whether the couple
left the U.S. out of their own decision or under pressure from
U.S. judicial authorities.
</P>
<P>
As to whether the Wangs were leaving under the escort of U.S. law
enforcement officers, Lee said he is not in a position to comment
or confirm any relevant details.
</P>
<P>
According to the informed sources, the U.S. authorities couldn't
expel or repatriate the Wangs because Taiwan's judicial
authorities had failed to present concrete criminal evidence
involving the couple.
</P>
<P>
The Wangs fled to China late last year after two of the group's
120-odd member companies applied for insolvency restructuring.
The fallout triggered a run on the Chinese Bank, another of the
group's affiliates. Subsequent judicial investigations found that
the couple and other family members and corporate executives were
involved in many suspected irregularities, including fraud,
embezzlement, breach of trust and insider trading.
