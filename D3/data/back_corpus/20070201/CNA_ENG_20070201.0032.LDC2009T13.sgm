The government will be guarding against market manipulation in
the run-up to the Lunar New Year, so to keep prices stable for
goods and services most popular during the period, a senior
official said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Concerted price raising, price fixing and hoarding of New Year
necessities are prohibited, said Tang Jinn-chuan, newly appointed
Fair Trade Commission Chairman, who just assumed office that day,
adding that the commission is joining efforts with agricultural
affairs and police agencies to address irregularities.
</P>
<P>
He made particular mention of barber shops and beauty parlors,
which should keep in place their usual pricing, or adjust the
prices in accordance with the market mechanism, saying that "they
cannot reset prices in a concerted action.
</P>
<P>
The beauty industry has a tradition of doubling prices during the
week or so prior to the Lunar New Year's Eve.
</P>
<P>
In order to ensure an adequate supply of goods and prevent
manipulation during the New Year period, the commission is
keeping in contact with several semi- government wholesale
corporations so as to keep itself well-informed of market
conditions, Tang said, adding that inspections have been carried
out at major New Year commodity fairs.
