CHINA FLEXES MUSCLES TOWARD U.S., JAPAN BY DESTROYING SATELLITE

China's recent destruction of a satellite with an
intercontinental ballistic missile was aimed at flexing its
military muscles to the world and warning Japan and the United
States against tampering in the Taiwan issue, Deputy Defense
Minister Ko Cheng-en was quoted as saying Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Ko was quoted in an interview with the Chinese-language Yazhou
Zhoukan as saying he considers China's development of anti-
satellite weapons and its recent demonstration of J10 fighters
were targeted on the situation after a planned meeting between
the U.S. defense secretary and his Japanese counterpart and a
meeting between the U.S. state department secretary and her
Japanese counterpart -- the so-called "two plus two meeting."
</P>
<P>
Ko said China's latest military actions were partly aimed at
warning the U.S. and Japan that should they intervene in a cross-
Taiwan Strait conflict, they will suffer the consequences.
</P>
<P>
He noted that it was unusual for China's air force to conduct two
large-scale exercises near Shanghai in December, with even the
airports in Shanghai closed at certain points during the
maneuvers.
</P>
<P>
Although having expressed concern over the destruction of the
satellite by a Chinese ICBM, Washington was somewhat quieter than
other major powers around the world over the matter, Ko said,
adding that it was probably because the United States still needs
Beijing's support over issues regarding the Iraq war, North
Korea's nuclear program and the Iran issue.
</P>
<P>
Ko said China might intimidate Taiwan by firing anti-satellite
missiles as a result of Taiwan's political situation,
particularly President  Chen Shui-bian's reiteration  of his
desire for a constitutional re-engineering plan, but added that
intimidating Taiwan was not the sole purpose of the recent
missile demonstration.
</P>
<P>
He said Beijing has used many means to intimidate Taiwan in the
past, including conducting live-ammunition war games in the
Taiwan Strait,  moving its guided missile deployment and
intensifying deployment of jet fighters in coastal areas.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, on a question of why the Republic of China military
has not demonstrated its strength over the past decade, Ko said
the military has restrained from flexing its muscles for fear of
provoking Beijing or having its actions misunderstood as efforts
to seek independence.
</P>
<P>
The military has also kept a low profile out of consideration for
the stance of the United States, upon which Taiwan relies for its
weapons procurement, Ko said.
