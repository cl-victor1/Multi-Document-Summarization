The Cultural Division of the Taipei Economic and Cultural Office
(TECO) in New York will hold the 2007 Test of Proficiency-Huayu
(TOP) assessment of Chinese proficiency, for beginner and basic
levels in New York on April 15.
</P>
<P>
Ethan Kuo, director of TECO Cultural Division, said Wednesday
that non-native Chinese speakers over 16 years-old are encouraged
to take the beginner or basic level test.
</P>
<P>
The Test of Proficiency-Huayu is a standardized test developed by
the Steering Committee for the Test of Proficiency-Huayu,
affiliated with National Taiwan Normal University. Given that
learning Chinese is becoming ever more popular, and that Chinese
learners may appreciate the opportunity to assess their
proficiency and receive credentials for the reference of
educational authorities or employers, the Republic of China's
Ministry of Education has promoted the assessment system overseas
since December 2003.
</P>
<P>
The TOP test is designed for Chinese learners at the beginner,
basic, intermediate, and advanced levels. As the test in New York
will be the first of its kind in the United States, TECO will
start by offering tests only at the beginner and basic levels.
</P>
<P>
In general, non-native Chinese speakers familiar with at least
800 Chinese characters, or having taken between 240 hours and 360
hours of Chinese language lessons can try the beginner's test and
those familiar with at least 1,500 Chinese characters or having
taken between 360 hours and 480 hours of Chinese language lessons
can try the basic test.
</P>
<P>
The test is open to people aged 16 years or older. TECO Cultural
Division expects 200 applicants each for the tests of beginner
and basic levels. Application forms can be downloaded from the
website, found at www.edutwny.org. All applications must be
submitted by mail or in person to the Cultural Division, Taipei
Economic and Cultural Office in New York, 1 East 42nd Street, 6th
Floor, New York, NY 10017 before March 15, 2007. In addition to
the application form, three photos, a copy of a valid passport or
ID, and payment of US$28 (for the basic level text only) should
be included.

<P>
Encouraging Chinese learners to take the opportunity to measure
their Chinese language proficiency, Kuo said that the Ministry of
Education issued credentials for basic, intermediate as well as
advanced levels, which can be used as job qualification
references. For international students seeking Taiwanese
scholarships or applying for academic programs at colleges or
universities in Taiwan, the credentials  are accepted by
increasing numbers of educational establishments requiring
Chinese proficiency.
