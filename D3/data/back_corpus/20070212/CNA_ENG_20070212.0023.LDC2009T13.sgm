Taiwan is inviting ethnic Chinese youths residing in the United
States or Canada to take part in a volunteer English teaching
program this summer, Overseas Compatriot Affairs Commission
(OCAC) officials posted in the U.S. capital said Monday.

The program, which is organized by the OCAC and the Ministry of
Education, aims to recruit 250 participants who will serve as
volunteer English teachers in schools in remote areas of Taiwan
this summer vacation, the officials said.

Registration is being accepted until Feb. 21 at OCAC service
offices around the United States or through the OCAC Web site at

The program, scheduled to run from July 16-Aug. 13, will include
an English teaching training course in the first week, teaching
