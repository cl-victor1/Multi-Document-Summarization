Taichung Mayor Jason Hu said Monday that he will have 100 roses
ready to welcome his wife Shirley Shaw's first return home since
being admitted to hospital following a serious traffic accident
in late November.

<P>
With Shaw's steady recuperation over the last three months and
with the recent removal of the steel brace on her partially
amputated left arm, Hu said he asked doctors to grant his wife "a
three-day leave" from hospital to spend the Chinese New Year
holiday at home with him.
</P>
<P>
Doctors at the China Medical University Hospital agreed to his
request but also urged that Shaw spend most of her time in bed
while at home as "her bones are still as fragile as sugar cane, "
according to Hu.
</P>
<P>
The traffic accident occurred on the evening of Nov. 18 when Hu
and his wife were heading home to Taichung from a campaign rally
in Kaohsiung along the north-bound section of the Formosa
Freeway. Their car rolled over after it was hit by a vehicle that
was trying to pass a truck. Shaw sustained serious injuries in
the accident and was unconscious when she arrived at Chimei
Hospital in Tainan. Hu also sustained minor injuries in the
accident.
