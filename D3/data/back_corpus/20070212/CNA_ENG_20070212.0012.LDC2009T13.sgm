Taiwan's Government Information Office (GIO) has for the first
time set up a booth at the Berlin International Film Festival as
part of its efforts to help local filmmakers expand into overseas
markets.
</P>
<P>
At the film festival, being held Feb. 8-18, the GIO is promoting
seven Taiwan- produced films, including director Leste Chen's
"Eternal Summer", Zero Chou's "Spider Lilies" and Arvin Chen's
"Mei".
</P>
<P>
Simon Hsieh, an offical in the GIO's Motion Pictures Department
said that the GIO has in the past assisted local filmmakers in
taking part in major international film festivals in Cannes,
Pusan and the United States.
</P>
<P>
To help Taiwan filmmakers break into international markets, Hsieh
said, the GIO is also interested in working with the Taiwan
External Trade Development Council (TAITRA), adding that the two
organizations have been engaged in consultations over the matter.
</P>
<P>
Hsieh said that the GIO hopes to use the TAITRA's marketing
experience and strong overseas presence to help in efforts to
have Taiwan filmmakers participate in even more international
film festivals, including those in Hong Kong, Beijing and
Singapore.
</P>
<P>
Also during the 57th Berlin Film Festival, the GIO will hold a
"Taiwan Night" cocktail party at Berlin's Hotel Marriott on Feb.
12, with Taiwan's representative to Germany, Shieh Jhy-wey, to
host the event.
