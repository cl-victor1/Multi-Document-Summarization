Taipei, Feb. 12 (CNA) 02/12/07  19:02:13 (By Lilian Wu)
</P>
<P>
The government will respond to the issue of transitional justice
around Feb. 28, the 60th anniversary of the tragic 2 28 Incident,
Executive Yuan spokesman Cheng Wen-tsang said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Cheng made the remarks amid reports that Wu Nai-teh, a researcher
at Academia Sinica, the nation's highest research institute, was
preparing  to form a private  sector truth and reconciliation
commission.
</P>
<P>
Wu expressed hope that the historical facts about the 2 28
Incident of 1947 and the ensuing "white terror" imposed by the
former Kuomintang administration will come to light in full to
serve as part of democracy education and avoid any repetition of
the tragedy, according to the reports.
</P>
<P>
Cheng said it would be more suitable for the government to
conduct some of the probes but added that some could be done by
the private sector and that the government would support such
efforts.
</P>
<P>
He noted that transitional justice is an issue for all emerging
democratic countries seeking to resolve the legacy of
authoritarian rule.
</P>
<P>
"Through reflection on transitional justice, Taiwan will be able
to deepen and cement its democratic system, " Cheng said, adding
that the methods used by other countries, including probes into
truth and accounting for responsibility, can provide a good
reference.
</P>
<P>
Noting that 2007 is the 60th anniversary of the 2 28 Incident,
when Kuomintang forces crushed a revolt in Taiwan, Cheng said
that "it is an appropriate time to discuss transitional justice."
</P>
<P>
He added that the transitional justice issue will not only cover
the 2 28 Incident but will also include the ensuing white terror
and all other controversial incidents that took place during the
previous authoritarian era.
