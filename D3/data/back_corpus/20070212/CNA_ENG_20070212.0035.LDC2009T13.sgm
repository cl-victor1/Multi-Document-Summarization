TAIWAN COULD BECOME NORMAL COUNTRY IN 10 YEARS: DPP HEAD
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  Feb. 12 (CNA) 02/12/07  21:19:56 (By Flor Wang)

Taiwan could become a normal country in 10 years if backed by a
tailor-made constitution and a Legislative Yuan dominated by the
ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), DPP Chairman Yu Shyi-
kun said Monday.
</P>
<P>
The DPP could make Taiwan a normal and competitive country in a
decade if the party is fully committed to the goal and backed by
full support from the rank and file, Yu said, adding that Taiwan
still dreams of joining the United Nations under the name of
"Taiwan" and of acquiring sufficient defensive weapons to
safeguard the nation's security.
</P>
<P>
In response to criticism from main opposition Kuomintang (KMT)
Chairman Ma Ying- jeou that the name change campaign for the
state-run enterprises,  being promoted  by the  DPP
administration,  is "unaccountable, " Yu clarified that he began
broaching the idea to underscore Taiwan identity as early as in
January 2005 while serving as premier.
</P>
<P>
The current name change drive was by no means a hasty move or
campaign ploy aimed solely at solidifying grass-roots support for
the DPP ahead of the December legislative elections, he argued,
adding that the redesignation of state-owned companies is part of
the DPP administration's goal of making Taiwan a normal and
complete country.
</P>
<P>
Since Yu rekindled the name change campaign earlier this month
during a DPP's Central Standing Committee meeting, several state-
owned enterprises have been renamed, including the nation's
shipbuilding and postal companies, as well as the petroleum
provider.
