A total of 40 junior high students had the privilege Monday to
learn from chefs from a five-star restaurant how to prepare
dishes for Chinese New Year feasts that are also nourishing and
supposedly prevent cancer.
</P>
<P>
The students, selected from families with cancer sufferers around
Taipei, Taoyuan and Hsinchu, attended a cooking session at the
Formosa Regent Taipei, where top-notch chef Chen Chao-teng led a
team of five cooks who demonstrated the preparation of six
Chinese New Year dishes that are nutritious and particularly good
for cancer sufferers.
</P>
<P>
The  six  dishes  were  a  healthy  hors  d'oeuvre,  a Buddha-
Leaps-Over-the- Wall pot, steamed baby abalone with garlic,
rainbow fresh scallops, a garden vegetable assortment and mashed
taro with dried nuts.
</P>
<P>
Dietician Chiang Hsiao-min, who also attended the session, said
almost all the materials and ingredients used in the six dishes
are good for the health and that the vegetables, with their
antioxidant elements, are especially good for cancer sufferers.
</P>
<P>
Fifteen-year-old  Wu Po-tseng  said  his mother  has  been
cancer-afflicted since his childhood and that he had no idea how
to help with his mom. He said cooking the garden vegetable
assortment was difficult, but he learned how to do it
nevertheless and will prepare the dish for his mother during the
Chinese New Year holidays.

<P>
Thirteen-year-old Chang Ting-yao from Taoyuan -- who came under
the spotlight a week ago when his story of taking care of his
colorectal cancer-afflicted father alone since he was an
elementary school student -- also attended the session.
