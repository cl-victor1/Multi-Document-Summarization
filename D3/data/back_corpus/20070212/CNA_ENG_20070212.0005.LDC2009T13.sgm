The Council of Labor Affairs (CLA) is set to convene a meeting
after the Chinese New Year holidays to discuss adjusting the
country's minimum wage, which has remained unchanged at NT$15,840
(US$481) per month for the last nine years, CLA Chairman Lee
Ying-yuan said Monday.

Lee said that whether to adjust the minimum wage and by how much
is a matter for a CLA basic wage screening committee to decide,
although he added that he personally feels the minimum wage
should be raised to better reflect current realities.
</P>
<P>
Lee said he sees an upward adjustment of the NT$15,840 minimum
wage as necessary given the fact that over 90 percent of Taiwan's
laborers earn over NT$20,000 a month, that the country's
unemployment rate fell to a new six-year low of 3.91 percent in
2006, and that many local companies have reported a shortage of
labor.
</P>
<P>
The top labor affairs official also noted that some firms have
suggested that the minimum wage for foreign laborers be de-linked
from that for Taiwan citizens so that they can continue to employ
foreign laborers at low costs. Lee said that he does not think
this is something that the CLA will do anytime soon.
