Taipei,  Feb.  12  (CNA) 02/12/07  19:49:18 (By Lilian Wu)

The government has commissioned the semi-official Taiwan External
Trade Development Council (TETRA) to make initial contact with
related agencies in China on its ban on gravel exports slated to
take effect March 1, a Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) official
said Monday.
</P>
<P>
MAC Chief Secretary Jan Jyh-horng said gravel imported from China
accounts for one-fifth of Taiwan's total demand, showing that
gravel from China is very important to Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Jan said he hopes cross-strait consultations will have good
results and that the measure will not be detrimental to Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Asked about the government's contingency plans in the event of a
Chinese ban, Jan said only that the Ministry of Economic Affairs
has made efforts to help expand its resources, including
increasing the amount of domestic dredging and imports from other
countries.
</P>
<P>
But he also said the measures will require a period of adjustment
and expressed hope that China's gravel exports will not undergo
dramatic changes in the short term.
</P>
<P>
China originally announced that its gravel export ban would start
May 1 last year but later put it on hold. It announced last month
that the ban would start March 1.
