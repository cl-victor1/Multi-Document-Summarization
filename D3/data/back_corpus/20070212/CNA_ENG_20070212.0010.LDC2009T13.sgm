Taiwan Post Co. is expected to issue the first set of "Taiwan
stamps" Feb. 28 featuring the Taipei 228 Memorial Museum as the
theme of their design, officials said Monday.
</P>
<P>
The issuance will be the first carrying the mark "Taiwan stamp"
after the company changed its name from "Chunghwa Post Co." to
"Taiwan Post Co."
</P>
<P>
However, other stamps issued by the company in the first quarter
of this year will still be printed with the mark "Republic of
China stamp, " as the issuance of stamps requires preparation in
advance, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Transportation and Communications ordered the
company to prepare for the issuance of the set of "Taiwan stamps"
last year, long before the company was renamed, to make it in
time for its issuance on Feb. 28, they said, adding that the
issuance of "Republic of China stamps" will stop completely in
April at the earliest.

<P>
The board of Chunghwa Post Co. approved a proposal to rename the
company Taiwan Post Co. Friday amid the government's efforts to
change the names of state-owned enterprises that contain
references to China. "Chunghwa" means "Chinese" or "China" in the
Chinese language.
</P>
<P>
Also Friday, Chinese Petroleum Corp. decided to change its name
to "CPC Corp., Taiwan, " while China Shipbuilding Corp. decided
to change its name to "CSBC Corp., Taiwan."
</P>
<P>
The Cabinet claims the name rectification campaign will help
avoid confusion resulting from Taiwan-based organizations
carrying similar names to organizations in China.
</P>
<P>
President Chen Shui-bian said last week that similar changes will
also be made to the names of the country's overseas embassies and
representative offices in the future.
