</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  May 6 (CNA) (By Lilian Wu)

<P>
Seven cases of acute enterovirus infections have been reported in
Taiwan so far this year, all of them in central and southern Taiwan,
an official of the Department of Health said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Wu Ping-huei, from health department's Center for Disease Control,
said that the first six cases occurred in central Taiwan, while the
latest one was in Tainan County in southern Taiwan at the end of April
-- afour-year-old boy who suffered from fever, ulcers at the corners
of his mouth, and vomiting and rashes. He has since recovered and has
been released from hospital.
</P>
<P>
Wu said that compared with the same period last year, which saw 41
serious enterovirus cases in Taiwan, the number this year is low. The
reason that northern Taiwan has no enterovirus cases might be because
this year the weather has been cool so far.

<P>
Tseng Shu-hui, director of the health department's Center for Disease
Control branch in southern Taiwan, said that health officials still
don't know why the serious cases of enterovirus converged in central
Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Tseng said, however, that it appears that there is a trend of a slow
increase in cases and he urged the public to pay attention to their
personal health to prevent infection.
</P>
<P>
Everyone is at risk of enterovirus infection, although infants,
children, and adolescents are more likely to be susceptible to
infection and illness.
