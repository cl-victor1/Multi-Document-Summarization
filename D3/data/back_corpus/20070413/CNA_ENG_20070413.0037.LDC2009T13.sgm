Taipei,  April  13  (CNA) 04/13/07  21:14:57 (By T.C. Jiang)

<P>
The inauguration of Taiwan's first high-speed rail system has
resulted in a lower number of passengers using the other means of
transportation to travel the western part of Taiwan, according to
officials from the Council for Economic Planning and Development
(CEPD).
</P>
<P>
The airliners have been the hardest hit, the officials said,
adding that the Civil Aeronautics Administration (CAA) has
announced that all domestic flight services will soon cease
operations at Taichung Airport in central Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
The announcement came after the CAA approved Wednesday a Mandarin
Airlines plan to cease servicing the Taipei-Taichung route May 1.
</P>
<P>
The airline company reported losses totaling NT$45 million
(US$1.36 million) in 2006 on the route.
</P>
<P>
Mandarin Airlines, the only aviation company currently operating
the Taipei- Taichung route, follows in the footstep of UNI
Airways Corp., which ceased servicing the route in July 2004 due
to falling passenger numbers.
</P>
<P>
The average passenger occupancy rate for all flight services on
the Taipei- Taichung route slid to 24.8 percent in February from
last December's 37.4 percent, while that on the Taipei-Chiayi
route dropped from 63.4 percent to 46 percent during the same
period, officials said.
</P>
<P>
These two routes have suffered most following the opening of the
high-speed rail, the officials continued.
</P>
<P>
A total of 2.08 million people took the high-speed train between
Jan. 5 and early March, officials noted, adding that the daily
passenger volume averages at 33,161.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the number of passengers taking the traditional
railway shrank from 14.57 million in last December to 13.57
million in February, a drop of 6.9 percent, the officials stated.
</P>
<P>
Freeway bus services saw a very small decline in the number of
passengers at 0.75 percent, according to officials.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Transportation and Communications (MOTC) will
continue to monitor the situation and formulate policies to
minimize the impact, the officials said.
