WATER SUPPLIES IN CENTRAL TAIWAN SUFFICIENT FOR FIRST PART OF
2007

<P>
Water supplies in central Taiwan will be sufficient in the first
part of this year, the Water Resources Agency of the Ministry of
Economic Affairs said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Agency officials noted that central Taiwan will need around 2.6
million tons of water per day, but this amount will be available
thanks to plentiful rainfall during the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
Officials said that Taichung can supply 1.3 million tons of water
daily, which is enough to meet demands, but noted that the Tachia
River, the main source of water, often becomes turbid after
downpours since the devastating Sept. 21, 1999 earthquake, and
that turbidity could affect water quality, and thus supply.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the launch of the Central Taiwan Science Park has
made demands for water soar and heightened the risk of water
shortages.
</P>
<P>
The Central Taiwan Science Park needs 282,000 tons of water
daily, but when the first-stage work of the Holi water
purification plant is completed at the end of 2009, water supply
should no longer pose a problem.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the development of the Changpin Industrial Zone has
not been as rapid as expected, with only one third of the
estimated manufacturers entering the zone, resulting in a lesser
amount of daily water use at around 8,000 tons.
</P>
<P>
To effectively use water sources in the region, officials have
reviewed and adjusted the water supply. But overall, the
household and industrial use of water in Changhua are gradually
exceeding available supplies.
</P>
<P>
In the Yunlin Technology Industrial park, the daily water needs
is around 300,000 tons, which is supplied by Chichi River, but as
there is no reservoir the industrial park has to rely on water
from irrigation systems during the dry season.
</P>
<P>
To deal with the future need for massive water inputs at the
industrial  park, the agency is actively tapping other water
resources.
