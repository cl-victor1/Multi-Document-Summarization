The Council of Agriculture (COA) reported Friday that they have
for the first time detected colding moth in a batch of imported
apples from New Zealand.
</P>
<P>
Officials from the COA's Bureau of Animal and Plant Health
Inspection and Quarantine said that they detected a live colding
moth larvae when inspecting a batch of New Zealand apples at
Taichung Harbor, central Taiwan Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The larvae was sent to the Department of Entomology of National
Chung Hsing University for examination and confirmed as colding
moth.
</P>
<P>
The 1,029 cartons of Fuji apples from New Zealand were determined
to have failed the quarantine inspection.
</P>
<P>
According to regulations concerning the handling of apples
imported from countries and regions with colding moths, this
batch of apples will be either returned or destroyed.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan will also temporarily suspend imports of New Zealand
apples until Wellington looks into reasons for the pest's
presence, adopts measures to improve inspections, and notifies
Taiwan that it is now free of colding moth. Until such steps are
taken, its apples will not be allowed to enter Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Officials said Taiwan has notified New Zealand to suspend its
apple export operations and that the bureau will step up
inspection and quarantine measures of imported apples.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that in 2006 apples from New Zealand accounted
for 12.3 percent of all apples imported into Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan has imported New Zealand apples for more than a decade,
and this is the first time that colding moth was found, officials
said. Taiwan has not found this pest in apples from other
countries this year, they added.
</P>
<P>
Officials said that apples with quarantine certification issued
by New Zealand before April 13 should be shipped before April 17
and that no more apples should be shipped after that day.
