Taipei, April 13 (CNA) 04/13/07  19:49:19 (By Elizabeth Hsu)

If political power changes hands in Taiwan following the 2008
presidential election, the country could expect an annual
economic growth rates of 6 percent from the following year on,
and the national per capita income will increase to US$20,000 by
the year 2011, said Ma Ying-jeou, a former opposition Kuomintang
(KMT) chairman, Friday.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan's economic growth has slowed significantly since the
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) took the power in 2000, Ma
claimed, attributing the economic slowdown to "political unrest"
caused by an "unstable government" implementing "uncertain
policies."
</P>
<P>
Ma made the remarks during his address at a ceremony marking the
establishment of a non-profit association for Chinese regional
economic and strategic development, composed of members from the
industrial, political and academic sectors of the island,
including KMT Legislators Lee Chi-chu and Chu Feng-chi, and
scholars from National Taiwan University and National Chengchi
University.

<P>
According  to Wang Tiao-chun,  director of the preparatory
committee of the association, the new organization is based on
the idea of pushing for economic exchanges in the "greater
Chinese economic zone" comprised of China, Hong Kong, Macau, and
Taiwan, as well as promoting global cooperation and development.
</P>
<P>
With that goal in mind, Wang said they hope key industrial and
commercial groups from the four main parties, and Singapore and
the United States as well, will all cross political barriers to
join the organization in an effort to boost regional development.
</P>
<P>
Addressing Taiwan's economic development, Ma said that there were
too many Cabinet shuffles over the past seven years to allow most
of the government's policies to be carried out, pointing out that
in the seven-year period, five different persons have held the
premier's post, there have been six ministers of finance, six
ministers of economic affairs, and seven chiefs of the government
information office.
</P>
<P>
The frequent personnel shuffles have resulted in uncertainty in
the implementation of key governmental policies,  such as the on-
again-off-again construction of the fourth nuclear-power plant,
the former Taipei mayor said.
