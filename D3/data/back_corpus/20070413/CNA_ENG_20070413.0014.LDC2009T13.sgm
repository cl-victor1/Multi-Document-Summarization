Seoul, South Korea, April 13 (CNA) 04/13/07  15:46:33 (By Chiang

<P>
Taiwan bananas, with their delightful flavor and aroma, have
returned to the South Korean market after a 10-year hiatus.
</P>
<P>
Kang Yi-chih, director of the Taiwan Trade Center in Seoul, held
a news conference in the South Korean capital Friday to promote
the first batch of Taiwan bananas arriving in the country in a
decade.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan bananas and pineapples were served to the reporters and
other guests at the news conference.
</P>
<P>
Kan noted that taste and aroma are what make Taiwan bananas stand
out among products from other countries, adding that with South
Korea's economic rebound since the Asian financial crisis in the
late 1990s, South Koreans are now willing to pay more for high-
quality agriculture produce.
</P>
<P>
A decade ago, Taiwan bananas couldn't compete in the South Korean
market with cheaper bananas from the Philippines and Ecuador and
had to bow out of the market.
