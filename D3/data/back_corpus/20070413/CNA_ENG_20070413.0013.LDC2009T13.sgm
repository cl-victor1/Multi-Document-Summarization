Taipei,  April  13  (CNA) 04/13/07  15:20:54 (By Deborah Kuo)
</P>
<P>
Officials from the National Police Administration (NPA) and the
Department of Health (DOH) reached a consensus Friday on the
establishment of "health police" to help stem the rampant flow of
illicit, counterfeit and bogus medications in the country.
</P>
<P>
The officials reached the consensus after engaging in a debate at
a news conference at the Legislative Yuan sponsored by opposition
Kuomintang Legislator Lai Shyh-bao on which governmental agency
should be responsible for cracking down on the flow and
production of illicit drugs as well as counterfeit and bogus
medications.
</P>
<P>
At the news conference, Lai said that there is only an average of
one investigator for every 40,000 people in Taiwan in terms of
finding and cracking down on illicit drugs and counterfeit or
bogus medications, while penalties for violations are too light
and cases of prosecution of such crimes too few.
</P>
<P>
Lai said the number of cases involving counterfeit or bogus
medications in Taiwan has increased about 50 percent over the
past three years, with the number of uncovered cases probably
being much higher.
</P>
<P>
He lamented  that although  it is stipulated  in the DOH
organizational law that a health police force should be
established, such a force has never been set up.
</P>
<P>
Lai said he will propose that the legislature request a health
police force be established within a specific period of time,
that a counterfeit medication task force be set up, and that
police forces' performance in cracking down on counterfeit
medications be included in their annual performance reports.
</P>
<P>
Liao Chi-chou, director of the DOH Bureau of Pharmaceutical
Affairs, said that transactions in Taiwan's pharmaceutical market
total about NT$80 billion (US$2.42 billion) annually and that the
DOH has had a hard time stamping out the trade in counterfeit or
bogus medications because the profits to be made are even higher
than in illicit drug trafficking and because the punishments
under the law are too light.
</P>
<P>
Liao said the DOH would be pleased to cooperate with the NPA to
jointly establish a health police force as long as there is a
sufficient budget.
</P>
<P>
Chen Po-hsun, a section chief of the NPA Department of Economic
Affairs,  said the NPA has agreed to have "liaison  windows"
established to help crack down on the flow and production of
illicit drugs as well as counterfeit and bogus medications.
</P>
<P>
Despite their differences on the issue, the NPA and DOH officials
came to a consensus that it is imperative that a health police
force be established  in the near future to tackle the problem of
counterfeit and bogus medications.
</P>
<P>
The two sides, however, remained divided on how the health police
force should be set up and under which governmental agency.
