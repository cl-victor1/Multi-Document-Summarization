The prosecutor who has been tapped to lead a special
investigation task force under the Supreme Prosecutor's Office,
vowed to seek collaboration among his team Wednesday, saying that
the group will work together to live up to the expectations of
the country.
</P>
<P>
Chen Yun-nan, who presently serves as a Ministry of Justice (MOJ)
counselor, was approved Tuesday by the MOJ Prosecutors' Personnel
Review Committee to head up the task force established to deal
with crimes committed by top government officials and their
relatives. He said he will work with the other nine members of
the task force to make sure that it will give a good account of
itself once it starts operating in early April.
</P>
<P>
Chen said the task force will also emulate the performance of the
Anti- Corruption Center under the High Court Prosecutor's Office
by championing government efforts to eliminate corruption. The
center will be disbanded after the special investigation task
force becomes operational.
</P>
<P>
The top investigation task force -- whose members include another
MOJ counselor and eight prosecutors from different high and
district prosecutor's offices -- will operate directly under the
leadership of the state public prosecutor- general.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the legislative caucus of the opposition Kuomintang
expressed approval of the name list of the task force and
expressed hope that it will go for broke to win back the people's
confidence in the country's judicial system.
