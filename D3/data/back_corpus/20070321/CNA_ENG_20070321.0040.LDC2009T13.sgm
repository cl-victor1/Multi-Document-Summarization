FOUNDATION SEEKS PUBLIC BACKING TO IMPROVE WOMEN'S SAFETY

The Modern Women's Foundation Wednesday called for greater public
attention to and backing of women's personal safety,
particularly with regards to victims' mental recovery in the
aftermath of sexual offenses.
</P>
<P>
According to the foundation's statistics, more than 6,000 cases
of sexual violations were reported to police and relevant
authorities last year. But the actual number of cases might be
ten times that, meaning that the number brought to light might
represent only the "tip of an iceberg," foundation officials
said.
</P>
<P>
Stressing the need for greater law enforcement, they pointed out
that of all attacks, perhaps only 10 percent are reported to
police each year, and of all those reports, perhaps only one in
ten will result in a suspect being indicted, convicted and put
behind bars.
</P>
<P>
Additionally, officials said that helping victims rebuild their
own sound mental health is a very difficult task. Some may
belittle and give up on themselves, or become self-destructive,
and require more than 10 years to get back to their normal lives.
</P>
<P>
Calling for comprehensive legislation to provide a supportive
environment to victims of sexual crimes, for both their
psychological and physical recovery, the officials also urged the
public to extend long-term moral and financial support to the
foundation to help them serve that goal.
