The Chinese National Federation of Industries (CNFI) would not
oppose an upward minimum wage adjustment if the range is kept
within 10 percent and carried out in a gradual manner, a senior
federation executive said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
CNFI Chairman Chen Wu-hsiung made the remarks after Council of
Labor Affairs Chairman Lee Ying-yuan said earlier in the day that
the Cabinet-level council will push for a minimum wage hike, with
the adjustment range reaching 40 percent of the country's wage
average, or an 11 percent rise from the current level at
NT$15,840 per month.
</P>
<P>
Chen said if the government can adopt well-devised complementary
measures, the federation, which groups senior managers of major
industrial companies in Taiwan, would not oppose a minimum wage
hike.
