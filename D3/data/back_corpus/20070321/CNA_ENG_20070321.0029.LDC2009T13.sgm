An Academia Sinica research fellow has been awarded the post of
honorary fellow by the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma and
Immunology (AAAAI) for his contributions in developing the first
biomedical medication for asthma, academic sources said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Chang Tse-wen, a member of the institution's Genomics Research
Center, has been researching allergy remedies for around 20
years. In the process, he first determined that immunoglobulin E
(IgE) is the genetic pathogen for allergic diseases. In 1987, he
started developing an anti-IgE medication that was named Xolair.
</P>
<P>
Xolair underwent three stages of human testing in 1991, 1994 and
1997 for its effect against some 30 immune diseases, including
asthma, allergic rhinitis and food allergies. It was approved by
the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in 2003.
</P>
<P>
Chang has begun development of a second-generation anti-allergic
biomedical medication.
</P>
<P>
He explained that conventional corticosteroids and antihistamine
therapies can only relieve allergic syndromes and come with
distinct side effects. Xolair is the first to address the
pathogen without negative side effects.
</P>
<P>
However, due to the extremely high cost -- US$400 for 150
milliliters of Xolair powder, the medication has only been used
for moderate to severe cases in the United States.
