A local women's group has called on the government to increase
criminal penalties for sex offenders amid a recent spate of sex
crimes, a spokeswoman for the group said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Modern Women's Foundation pointed out that the reoffending
rate for sexual crimes is high, which poses a great threat to
social order and human rights.

<P>
The foundation  urged the government  to introduce  severe
punishments and to isolate repeated sex criminals from the rest
of the society for good by refusing to grant parole, the
spokeswoman said.

<P>
The foundation also asked authorities to strictly enforce the
Sexual Assault Crime Prevention Act, to establish a sound
community monitoring system, and to review related penalties
under the criminal code, the spokeswoman noted.
