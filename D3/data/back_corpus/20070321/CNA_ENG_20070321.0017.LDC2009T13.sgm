Taipei,  March 21 (CNA) 03/21/07  16:31:52 (By Luis Huang)

Wu Poh-hsiung, former acting chairman of the opposition
Kuomintang (KMT) , pledged Wednesday that if elected chairman of
the party, he will continue to promote cooperation between the
KMT and the People First Party (PFP).
</P>
<P>
Wu, who is running in the KMT's chairmanship by-election, made
the promise while drumming up support for his bid among the
party's grass-roots members in the eastern county of Hualien.
</P>
<P>
Stressing the importance of unity and cooperation between the two
parties, Wu said that if he is elected chairman, he will abide by
all the regulations concerning  the KMT-PFP  alliance,  which was
established  in late January to further consolidate  bilateral
cooperation in the year-end legislative elections.
</P>
<P>
As for the other candidate Hung Hsiu-chu's request that public
debates between the two contenders for the KMT's top post be held
to boost party members' enthusiasm for the chairmanship by-
election slated for April 7, Wu said it is unnecessary for the
party to organize such debates, adding that the two contenders
should assume "a harmonious attitude" in facing the by-election.
</P>
<P>
The by-election was made necessary by Ma Ying-jeou's resignation
as KMT chairman Feb.  13 immediately after being indicted on
corruption charges for his alleged misuse of a special
discretionary allowance fund during his two terms as Taipei mayor
from 1998 to 2006. Ma simultaneously announced that he will run
in the 2008 presidential election.
