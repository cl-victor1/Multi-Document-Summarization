Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) Chairman Joseph Wu said Wednesday
that it is not possible at present to determine when Taiwan will
open its doors to Chinese tourists for sightseeing visits as the
technical details still have to be worked out between the two
sides.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan has conducted five rounds of negotiations on the technical
details with Chinese authorities since it decided last year to
open its doors to Chinese tourists, Wu told reporters at the
Legislative Yuan before attending a meeting of the legislative
committee on interior affairs to give a briefing on the MAC's
operations.
</P>
<P>
The two sides are preparing to hold another round of talks, Wu
said, adding that it is not possible to speculate on when the
opening will be implemented until the negotiations are completed.
</P>
<P>
Asked whether the negotiations will be completed before he steps
down to take up his new post as Taiwan's top representative to
the United States, Wu expressed the hope that the talks can be
concluded as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
Wu stressed that the policy of opening Taiwan to Chinese tourists
will not change after he steps down as the country's top China
policy planner.
</P>
<P>
Wu has been tapped to replace David Ta-wei Lee as Taiwan's top
envoy to the United States. Lee will take over as the nation's
representative to Canada.
