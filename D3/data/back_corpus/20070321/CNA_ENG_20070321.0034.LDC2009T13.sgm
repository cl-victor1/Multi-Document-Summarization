The famous writer Kuo Yi-tung, better known by his pen name of Bo
Yang has donated his manuscripts to the National University of
Tainan (NUTN) in Tainan City, an NUTN spokesman said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Bo Yang's wife Chang Hsiang-hua attended the donation ceremony
Wednesday on behalf of the writer to donate his manuscripts,
including important certificates, writing drafts and journals to
NTUN President Huang Cheng-chieh. Chang said at the ceremony that
Bo Yang is very grateful to see his manuscripts become part of
the NUTN collection.

Bo Yang moved from China to Taiwan in 1949 and was imprisoned as
a political prisoner on Green Island for nine years for
criticising the late President Chiang Kai-shek during Taiwan's
infamous martial-law era. He wrote a number of best-sellers such
as his renowned works "The Ugly Chinaman" and "Alien Lands."

NUTN conferred its first honorary doctoral degree on Bo Yang on
his 88th birthday earlier this month in recognition of his
literary achievements and his fight for human rights. The school
acquired Bo Yang's manuscripts with help from Su Chin-chiang,
former chairman of the Taiwan Solidarity Union.

<P>
Wang Jung-wen, president of Yuan-Liou Publishing Co. Ltd., said
the National Museum of Modern Chinese Literature in Beijing and
the National Museum of Taiwan Literature in southern Tainan City
also have collections of Bo Yang's manuscripts.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said NUTN will establish a Bo Yang museum to
exhibit the writer's manuscripts and will also build replicas of
six rooms imitating Bo Yang's residence and prison cell that will
be open to visitors.
