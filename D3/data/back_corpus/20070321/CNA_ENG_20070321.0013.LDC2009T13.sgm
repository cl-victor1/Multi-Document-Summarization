professional baseball manager of Chinese descent, to the central
Taiwan city to serve as a spokesman for an international baseball
tournament.

Hu, who is scheduled to leave for Japan Friday for a six-day
visit, said that Oh has tentatively agreed to come to Taichung
and that he hopes to finalize the matter during his trip. Oh, a
former baseball star, is currently managing the Fukuoka Softbank
Hawks.

Hu said that he will also visit the Japanese Dome and other
baseball facilities for reference on how to improve the Taichung
baseball stadium to become on par with other top international
baseball stadiums.

He will also call on the top brass of Japan's professional
baseball leagues to sound out the possibility of teams from the
leagues coming to Taichung for training at the field.

In addition, Hu is also scheduled to call on Japanese architect
Toyo Ito, who has been commissioned to build the Taichung opera
house, to learn about his progress in this regard.
