NO LINK BETWEEN DISEASES WITH SIMILAR NAMES

San  Francisco,  July  11 (CNA) (By Neil Lu &amp; Lin Wen-fen)
</P>
<P>
The US Center for Disease Control (CDC) announced Saturday that the
hand-foot-and-mouth disease that is affecting children in Taiwan has
no connection with the foot-and-mouth disease epidemic that decimated
the island's hog population last year.
</P>
<P>
The CDC said that although similar in name, the two diseases are
caused by totally different viruses.
</P>
<P>
The CDC said it has notified the health and travel agencies in the
United States to warn Taiwan-bound visitors to be on guard against the
viral epidemic.
</P>
<P>
More than 30,000 children have been affected by hand-foot-and-mouth
disease with some 60 deaths since the epidemic broke out on the island
in April, according to the CDC. Typical symptoms of the disease are
blisters in the oral cavity and ulcers on the palms and soles.
</P>
<P>
In addition to closely monitoring the disease's development in Taiwan,
the CDC said that three of its epidemiologists have been on the island
for one month to help identify the cause of the outbreak.
</P>
<P>
The CDC said that the deaths resulting from the disease were caused by
complications such as pulmonary edema, meningitis and encephalitis.
Though enterovirus type 71 was the most frequently detected virus in a
number of autopsies, it has not yet been determined whether
enterovirus type 71 triggered the hand-foot-and-mouth disease
epidemic.
</P>
<P>
The prestigious disease control agency said that enterovirus type CA16
also causes the disease. So far, there is no preferred treatment for
diseases caused by either enterovirus type 71 or type CA16.
</P>
<P>
Enteroviruses are not spread by air and are not usually spread through
food or water, either. People are generally infected by direct contact
or from discharges from the nose and mouth of an infected person.
</P>
<P>
Although travelers to Taiwan run a high risk of contracting the
disease, its mortality rate is very low. Visitors are advised to
practice good personal hygiene and wash their hands frequently.
