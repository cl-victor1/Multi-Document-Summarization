The number of reported HIV virus carriers in Taichung increased
to 540 by the end of March, Taichung County Deputy Magistrate
Chang Chuang-hsi said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Chang told a press conference that statistics compiled by the
county government's Public Health Bureau show that seven pregnant
women in the county tested positive for HIV last year and that of
the seven newborns, three were certified to be free of the HIV
virus, while the other four were still being monitored.
</P>
<P>
According to Chang, statistics also show that 74 percent of the
HIV carriers contracted the virus through sexual transmission,
while another 23.3 percent were infected due to shared needle use
while injecting drugs.
</P>
<P>
Chang urged Taichung County's residents to keep in mind the
importance of safe sex.

He added that both men and women should face the issue squarely,
instead of treating the subject as taboo.
</P>
<P>
The magistrate encouraged the use of condoms to avoid both
unwanted pregnancies and HIV transmission.
