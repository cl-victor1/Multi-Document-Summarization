LAW AMENDMENT PROPOSAL AIMS TO CLEAN-UP POLITICS: DPP
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taipei,  April  18 (CNA) 04/18/07  21:44:05 (By Flor Wang)
</P>
<P>
The legislative caucus of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) urged Wednesday the public not to politicize a DPP-
initiated draft amendment to prevent suspected criminals from
taking part in presidential elections, saying that it will help
to clean-up politics in Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
DPP legislative caucus whip Wang Hsing-nan made the comments in a
Legislative Yuan news conference after a proposed revision to the
Presidential and Vice Presidential Election and Recall Law,
submitted by DPP lawmaker Chen Chin-der, was included a day
earlier on the agenda of the Procedure Committee.
</P>
<P>
Lawmakers of the opposition People First Party (PFP) and the Non-
Partisan Solidarity Union all were absent from the Tuesday
meeting, making it possible to railroad the proposed revision
through the committee.
</P>
<P>
Main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) lawmakers have vowed to block
the proposed amendment -- widely believed to target former KMT
Chairman Ma Ying-jeou, who is pursuing a presidential bid despite
being charged with corruption -- in the upcoming Friday meeting.
</P>
<P>
According to Wang, DPP lawmakers will be fully mobilized to
secure the passage of the draft bill in the Friday meeting, but
they will respect whatever decision PFP lawmakers make regarding
this matter. The PFP and the KMT set up a new and closer
partnership in January, and the two parties have long cooperated
in the Legislative Yuan.
</P>
<P>
Chen called for widespread support from legislative peers for the
passage of the proposed amendment, and argued that the KMT has
been "hijacked" by Ma as the party currently is seeking to modify
its internal regulations banning party members convicted in the
first trial from taking part in any elections to keep alive Ma's
hopes of running in the next presidential election.
</P>
<P>
Chen also denied widespread criticism that his proposed amendment
to ban candidates convicted in the first trial in presidential
elections is intended to target any particular individual.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, it is widely assumed that PFP lawmakers were absent
from the Tuesday Procedure Committee meeting due to disputes
arising from the May 12 by-election for the Keelung mayorship and
December's legislative election despite the fact that the two
parties set up a KMT-PFP alliance in January to step up
collaboration in the upcoming elections.
</P>
<P>
Later the same day, KMT Chairman Wu Poh-hsiung promised that he
will do his best to "mediate" with the PFP to ensure that PFP
legislators are aligned with their KMT counterparts and prepared
to reject the draft law amendment Friday in the Legislative Yuan.
</P>
<P>
Wu questioned whether such "a clause targeting Ma" really serves
social justice, and called it a DPP "plot" to squeeze Ma out of
the next presidential contest.
</P>
<P>
In response to speculation that the KMT is planning to relax its
regulations excluding convicted party members from taking part in
any elections, Wu said that such a change must be approved by
party delegates in a national congress, but made it clear that
"even if the KMT implements the rule change, it will be for the
good of the entire party, and not only for Ma."
</P>
<P>
According to KMT Secretary-General Wu Duen-yih, the KMT party
central will not push through a change in the party charter as
any revision must be decided by a two-third majority of party
delegates in a national congress.
</P>
<P>
The KMT is slated to hold its 17th plenary session June 24, a KMT
spokesman said.
