</HEADLINE>

Washington Feb. 16 (CNA) 02/17/07  15:49:44 (By Chiehyu Lin and
Y.C. Jou)

<P>
Taiwan's official representative office and civil groups in the
United States expressed gratitude Friday for a bipartisan U.S.
House of Representatives proposal led by Rep. Tom Tancredo
(R-Colo.) calling for the United States to resume normal
diplomatic relations with Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Tancredo, along with Reps. Mark Souder (R-Ind.), Dana Rohrabacher
(R-Calif.) , Edolphus Towns (D-N.Y.) and Dan Burton (R-Ind.) ,
introduced earlier the same day the resolution urging the Bush
administration to recognize Taiwan as a sovereign and independent
state in demonstration of concrete support for the democracy.
</P>
<P>
The resolution calls on the U.S. president to abandon the
fundamentally flawed "one China policy" in favor of a more
realistic "one China, one Taiwan policy" and begin the process of
resuming normal diplomatic relations with Taiwan. It also urges
the United States to aggressively support Taiwan's bid for full
participation in the United Nations and other international
organizations that require statehood for membership.
</P>
<P>
Tancredo said that "the 'one China' policy is a fiction - a relic
of time that has long since passed, " arguing that it is time for
the United States to "stop living this lie."
</P>
<P>
Formosan Association for Public Affairs (FAPA) President C.T. Lee
applauded the resolution, saying "the policy of dual recognition
will be the most effective way for the United States to manifest
its support for democratic countries around the world and to
counter China's ambition of invading Taiwan."
</P>
<P>
FAPA is a Washington-based private non-profit organization aiming
to promote Taiwan's international status.
</P>
<P>
The Taipei Economic and Cultural Representative Office in the
United States also expressed its appreciation to Tancredo and his
colleagues for introducing the resolution.
