The increased level of consumer spending in Taiwan, which totaled
NT$7.07 trillion (US$214.89 billion) in 2006, reflects
improvements in the quality of life of local people, the
Cabinet's statistics agency reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
According to the results of a recent survey by the Directorate
General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics (DGBAS) , Taiwan's
consumer spending -- meaning the purchase of goods and services
by individual citizens -- increased 2.2 percent year-on-year in
2006.
</P>
<P>
An in-depth analysis of consumer spending in Taiwan over the past
decade shows that the percentage of spending on basic
necessities, such as food, water, shelter and clothing, has
declined steadily, while spending on entertainment and education
has been on an upward spiral, a trend that points to progress in
the pursuit of higher quality of life following increases in the
nation's per-capita income, DGBAS officials said.
</P>
<P>
In 2006, spending on food continued to represent the lion's share
of overall consumer spending at 23.6 percent, but the figure
marked a decline of 0.5 percentage points over that of a decade
earlier.
</P>
<P>
Rent and water bills accounted for 14.6 percent of total consumer
spending, down 2.8 percentage points from the level registered a
decade ago, DGBAS officials said, adding that the percentage of
spending on clothing also dropped 0.9 percentage points to a mere
3.7 percent of total spending.
</P>
<P>
In contrast, the ratio of spending on travel, entertainment,
recreation, education  and cultural services increased by 1.9
percentage points to reach 18.7 percent of total spending, the
officials said.
</P>
<P>
As local people's average life expectancy has risen steadily over
the past decade, medical and health care bills have also spiked,
with the ratio surging 1.5 percentage points to reach 9.1 percent
of total household spending in 2006.
</P>
<P>
The prevalence of mobile phone and Internet service has driven up
the ratio of spending on transportation and communications to
11.9 percent, or 0.8 percentage points higher than the figure a
decade ago, the officials said.
