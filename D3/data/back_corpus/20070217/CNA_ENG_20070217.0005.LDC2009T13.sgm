HOLIDAY

Taipei,  Feb. 17 (CNA) 02/17/07  16:35:59 (By Y.C. Jou)

A special ferry hired by the Kinmen County Government to help
Kinmen people living on Taiwan proper return home for the Lunar
New Year holidays arrived at the outlying island's Liaoluo Harbor
Saturday morning after a nine-hour journey from Taichung Harbor.
</P>
<P>
A total of 355 people took advantage of the special ferry service
set up by the county government for the first time as a solution
to the problem of limited availability of air tickets during the
holiday period due to high demand.
</P>
<P>
Passengers aboard the "Kinmen Express" received a warm welcome as
well as red envelopes from Kinmen County Commissioner Lee Chu-
feng upon their arrival at Liaoluo Harbor.
</P>
<P>
Most of the passengers interviewed expressed satisfaction with
the ferry service. Some of them said they took the ferry because
there were no plane tickets available, while others said they
decided to return home by sea as the cost was much lower than
flying.
</P>
<P>
As the county government bore most of the cost of providing the
ferry service, passengers only needed to pay NT$500 (US$15) for
an adult one-way ticket.
</P>
<P>
Lunar New Year traffic has been a nightmare for Kinmen people who
live on Taiwan proper and wish to return home to reunite with
family during the holidays, as there are only a limited number of
flights and no regular passenger ferry service linking Taiwan to
the outlying island.
</P>
<P>
The Kinmen Express will depart on its return trip to Taichung
Harbor at 10:00 p.m. on Feb. 24, the county government said.
