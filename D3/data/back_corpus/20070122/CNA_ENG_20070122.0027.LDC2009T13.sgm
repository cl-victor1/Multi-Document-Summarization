U.S. WOMAN REUNITES WITH BIOLOGICAL FATHER IN TAIWAN AFTER 40
YEARS
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taipei, Jan. 22 (CNA) 01/22/07  18:54:29 (By Maubo Chang)
</P>
<P>
With only two blurred photos and vague hints from her mother,
Emily Yan, a Taiwan-born American, met with her biological father
in Tainan, southern Taiwan Saturday after a hiatus of 40 years,
thanks to an accommodating police officer in Banciao, Taipei
County.
</P>
<P>
Yang, who is a bank clerk in a "middle U.S. state, " told
journalists at the Tainan home of her father, Tu Lung-yi, that
her mother left Tu, moved to the United States when she was only
three years old and told her he was dead.
</P>
<P>
Her mother changed her name after she remarried and the little
girl's only impression of her biological father was two family
photos.
</P>
<P>
However, the girl knew that her father was a photographer for the
late President Chiang Kai-shek.
</P>
<P>
With a strong desire to find her real father, Yang asked Bob
Feng, a bank customer who often travels between the United States
and Taiwan, to help her find her father.
</P>
<P>
Feng asked Wang Min-nan, a police officer at the Banciao
Household Registration Office, for help after learning from
newspapers that he had helped other people find missing family
members through searches of past household registration data.
</P>
<P>
Wang  delved  into  the  country's  computerized  household
registration databank and found a dozen people who could be
Yang's father, who he contacted one by one to verify their
identities.
</P>
<P>
His efforts bore fruit late last year and during their final
reunion Saturday, Yang and Tu kept a low profile, with Yang
saying she did not to embarrass her mother while Tu said tongue-
in-cheek that he was afraid his "many other unknown children"
might come out if they knew how to find him.
