The jobless rate for 2006 was 3.91 percent, a six-year low, the
Directorate General of the Budget, Accounting and Statistics
(DGBAS) announced Monday.
</P>
<P>
Huang Chien-chung, a deputy director of DGBAS' fourth bureau,
noted that the number of unemployed was 405,000, or 3.81 percent
in December, down 0.05 percentage points from November.
</P>
<P>
The 2006 level shows that the goal set by the Council for
Economic Planning and Development of less than 4 percent had been
achieved, Huang said.
</P>
<P>
He attributed the reason to an economic growth of 4.3 percent for
2006 and the steady growth of labor market demand.
</P>
<P>
The number of employed for the whole year increased by 169,000 to
an average  of 10.11  million  from the previous  year,  the
second-highest growth in nearly 12 years, he said. Among them,
the number of people employed in the traditional manufacturing
sector was cut by 23,000, but the number of those employed in the
service and high-tech sectors increased by 121,000 and 73,000
respectively.
</P>
<P>
The average labor participation rate was 57.9 percent in 2006, a
new high for the past seven years. The female labor participation
rate also showed an annual increase, mainly because of the higher
education received by women and the continued development of the
service sector, as well as government policies to promote female
participation in the workforce.
