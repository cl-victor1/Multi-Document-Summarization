An international seminar on urban innovation organized by the

Chinese Architecture and Building Center is scheduled to open
Tuesday in Taipei, a BTCO official said Monday.

According to the official, Birmingham City Council Director of
Planning and Regeneration Clive Dutton will attend the workshop,
to be attended by local government officials, architects and
academics, to share his experience in transforming the U.K. city
into an "international, modern and creative city."

The official said the city council has wide experience in
carrying out urban planning and regeneration projects for
continued and accelerated citywide revitalization and prosperity.

For example, Birmingham invested around 79.2 million pounds to
develop the Bullring Shopping Center, which created 6,000 jobs
and is expected to drive up the number of tourist arrivals by 30
percent, the official went on.

The official further said Arup Chairman Terry Hill will also lead
a delegation of British architecture and building experts taking
part in the seminar, during which he will deliver a speech titled
