PRESIDENTIAL OFFICE TO SEEK CONSTITUTIONAL INTERPRETATION OF
"STATE SECRETS
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taipei. Jan. 22 (CNA) 01/22/07  21:00:29 (By Y.C. Jou)
</P>
<P>
The Presidential Office Monday objected to a Taipei District
Court decision that six diplomatic missions connected with
thespecial state affairs fundcase were not deemed secret, saying
it will seek a Constitutional interpretation.
</P>
<P>
What the court requested are state secrets and shall not be
disclosed so as to not cause harm to the country's image,
security and interests, Presidential Office Deputy-General Cho
Jung-tai said at a news conference held for the issue Monday
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
"Any disagreement over the 'state secrets privilege' conferred on
the President to facilitate the exercise of his authority
according to the Constitution  shall be resolved  through
constitutional interpretation," he said.
</P>
<P>
Cho, however, did not elaborate on the feasibility of pursuing
legal procedures in filing a constitutional interpretation
petition to the Council of Grand Justices or whether such a move
will prevent the court from disclosing documents the Presidential
Office called state secrets the next day.
</P>
<P>
The court later decided to maintain its Jan. 19 "no secret"
decision and will Tuesday open to attorneys and prosecutors three
sets of documents containing information  about the diplomatic
missions, after finding that the Presidential Office's response
failed to provide adequate reasons for the documents to be
protected, a court spokesman said Monday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The three sets of documents in question include partial records
of the president being questioned by Prosecutor Chen Jui-jen last
August, as well as documents submitted by the president to the
prosecutor at that time. The documents said to contain the six
secret diplomatic missions were classified at the president's
request, and whether they should be unsealed became a key debate
between the prosecution and the defense after the court procedure
began in December.
</P>
<P>
The prosecution has been arguing that the Presidential Office
should provide enough information to explain whether the six
files are truly state secrets as the law defines - that is,
whether all the procedures involved conformed to the Classified
National Security Information Protection Act.
</P>
<P>
At Monday's news conference Cho Jung-tai said the president's
state secret privilege is of Constitutional level, and thus its
range is not defined by the Classified National Security
Information Protection Act.
</P>
<P>
Cho said that the state secret privilege - part of theexecutive
privilegeacknowledged at a constitutional level in grand
justices' interpretation No. 585 - is a privilege with which the
president can refuse to provide information  concerning secrets
dealing with military, diplomatic or other sensitive national
security affairs. The privilege receives absolute protection, he
said.
