NO RENAMING OF KMT: CHAIRMAN
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  Jan. 22 (CNA) 01/22/07  19:01:57 (By Lilian Wu)

Main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Ma Ying-jeou dismissed
reports about a possible change of the party's name, saying that
while the party has a reform problem, there are no plans for a
new name.
</P>
<P>
Ma said the KMT, also known as the Chinese National Party, does
not intend to change its name and that he personally does not
approve of a change.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks after a local newspaper reported that during
his meeting with rank-and-filed party members Ma said it is "not
appropriate" to change the name of the party at present as it
would be too controversial, but "the matter might be considered
if the KMT regains ruling power."
</P>
<P>
He said the party has a glorious tradition and is proud of it. It
is the party that helped build the Republic of China and restore
Taiwan after Japanese colonial rule and it also contributed to
the country's economic and democratic development, he added.
</P>
<P>
He said the priority task for the party is to pursue policies or
approaches that can touch the hearts of the people and to reflect
upon itself. Failing that, a change of name would be pointless,
he added.
</P>
<P>
Ma admitted that since the KMT lost power in 2000, some party
members have suggested a name change, but he pointed out that
there can be diverse views within the party.
</P>
<P>
He said the name originated in China, which he claimed is not in
conflict with the fact of its development in Taiwan. The KMT will
also not act like the DPP by trying to sever Taiwan's connection
with China, he added.
</P>
<P>
KMT Central Standing Committee member Hung Yu-chin proposed in
2003 changing the party's name to Taiwanese Nationalist Party so
as to highlight the image of the party's affinity to Taiwan.
Then-KMT Chairman Lien Chan asked the party's policy committee to
study the proposal but no conclusion was reached.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Legislator Tsai Chin-lung, caucus whip of the KMT in
the Legislative Yuan, said that a name-change is certainly not
the way to move the people.
</P>
<P>
Legislative Speaker Wang Jin-pyng also expressed opposition to
the idea.
