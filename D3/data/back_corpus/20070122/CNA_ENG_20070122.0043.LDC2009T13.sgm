LEGISLATIVE YUAN SPEAKER OPPOSED TO PROPOSED CHANGE OF KMT'S NAME
</HEADLINE>

Taipei, Jan. 22 (CNA) 01/22/07  22:50:07 (By Han Nai-kuo)

Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng said Monday that he is
firmly opposed to any proposal to change the name of the
Kuomintang (KMT) -- Taiwan's largest opposition party.
</P>
<P>
Wang made clear his position when commenting on news reports that
KMT Chairman Ma Ying-jeou had told a meeting of party workers in
Taichung  Sunday that the party might consider reviewing  the
name-change issue after the KMT again becomes the ruling party in
2008, although he added that now is not the time to do so because
it could create controversy in the party.
</P>
<P>
Wang said that although some people have classified him as a
member of the "indigenous faction," he has always taken the
position that the KMT's name should never be changed.
</P>
<P>
Stressing that there is no need for the KMT to change its name,
Wang said Ma should not have responded to calls for a name change
simply to be polite.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, there have been proposals from both KMT members
and supporters urging the party to consider changing its name
because they believe that the KMT, which means literally the
Chinese Nationalist Party, denotes the party's close connection
with China.
</P>
<P>
Suggested new names for the party include "Taiwanese Nationalist
Party" and simply "Nationalist Party."
</P>
<P>
In response, the KMT chairman clarified that there is no question
of a name change for the KMT, and that the only serious question
for the party is to implement reform.
</P>
<P>
Ma said that he does not plan to change the party's name because
personally he is opposed to such an idea.
</P>
<P>
The KMT, founded by Dr. Sun Yat-sen in China in 1912, is
currently Taiwan's largest political party in terms of the number
of legislative seats it holds. It favors eventual unification
with China and opposes  Taiwan independence, as advocated  by the
ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP).
</P>
<P>
The KMT lost its ruling party status in 2000 when it was defeated
in the presidential election by the DPP. It lost the presidential
election again in 2004.
