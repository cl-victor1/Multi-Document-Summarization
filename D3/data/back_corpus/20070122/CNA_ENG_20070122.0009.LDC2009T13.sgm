Thanks to the military's faithful implementation of a gender
equality policy, the Army has managed to form an all-women
company that will undertake support missions in electronic
warfare, military sources said Monday.
</P>
<P>
According to the sources, the special Army unit is composed of
more than 100 women officers,  non-commissioned  officers  and
rank-and-file members.
</P>
<P>
The unit has been trained in electronic warfare skills and
relevant job specialties, the sources said, adding that the all-
women Army company will be entrusted with important missions in
the Han Kwang No. 23 combined services exercise to be held later
this year.
</P>
<P>
The military is expected to introduce the all-women Army company
to the press Tuesday for the first time, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
Military analysts said the organization of an all-women Army unit
became possible only after the military began to recruit
volunteer women soldiers over the past couple of years.
</P>
<P>
With more women interested in pursuing a military career, the
sources said, the military has continued to raise the percentage
of women volunteer soldiers. Nearly 1,000 volunteer women
soldiers have joined the military ranks so far, and the military
is planning to recruit an additional 3,000 this year, the sources
said.
</P>
<P>
Besides the increase in the number of volunteer female soldiers,
the sources said, women have also been playing an increasingly
important role in the country's armed forces.
</P>
<P>
Army Col. Ting Liang-chien, 45, was the latest to join the
expanding rank of female officers who have taken up leadership
posts in various military units, including "front line" combat
units.
</P>
<P>
Ting, a mother of two young children, was promoted to political
warfare chief of the Army's No. 601 airborne cavalry brigade last
November, making her the country's first women officer ever to
assume a management position in a combat unit.
</P>
<P>
In the Army tradition, the post is an important stepping stone
toward the rank of major general. Military authorities reportedly
expect Ting to become the country's first female general from a
combat unit in the future.
</P>
<P>
The military now has two female major generals -- Pan Ai-chu, 51,
dean of education at the National Defense University's Political
Warfare College, and Tsai Hui-chen, 51, director of the Ministry
of National Defense's Communications and Electronics Department.
But neither of them had ever served in a combat unit.
