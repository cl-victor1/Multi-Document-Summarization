Taipei, Jan.  22 (CNA) 01/22/07  19:19:55 (By Han Nai-kuo)

Health authorities in Taipei announced Monday that they have
banned six brands of coffee mixed with an extract from tongkat
ali -- a plant grown in Southeast Asia that is claimed to have
aphrodisiac properties.
</P>
<P>
Jiang Yu-mei, chief of the Food and Drug Division of the Taipei
city government's Department of Health, told reporters that the
stores selling tongkat ali coffee have been ordered to destroy
such products in addition to paying fines of between NT$30,000
and NT$150,000.
</P>
<P>
She said health officials conducted a market examination in
November last year after receiving tip-offs that some of the
instant coffee brands sold in Taipei contain tongkat ali
additives.
</P>
<P>
After searching 31 supermarkets, coffee shops and drugstores, the
officials found six coffee brands whose descriptions say they
contain tongkat ali extract.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said tongkat ali is not permitted by the Cabinet-level
Department of Health for use in food products and that there is
insufficient literature to evaluate whether the herbal extract
can produce side effects in humans.
</P>
<P>
Tongkat ali, called Eurycoma Longifolia Jack, is a small tree
found in Southeast Asian jungles. The bitter extract from the
root of the plant is widely used in Malaysia to enhance male
libido. In Indonesia, it is known as pasak bumi, while in Vietnam
it is called cay ba binh, or "the tree that cures hundreds of
diseases."
</P>
<P>
Market experts say tongkat ali coffee is a modern marketing ploy
of some companies in Singapore and Malaysia whose aim is to turn
tongkat ali's reputation into corporate earnings.
</P>
<P>
According to the experts, coffee with Tongkat ali additive would
be an awkward combination and is nothing but gimmickry because
caffeine is not conducive to male virility.
