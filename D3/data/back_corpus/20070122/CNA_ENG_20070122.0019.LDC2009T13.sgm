TAINAN STEPS UP AVIAN FLU PREVENTION

Southern Tainan City has stepped up avian flu preventive measures
in a bid to keep the disease at bay during the season when
migratory birds are active, officials from the Tainan City Animal
Disease Control Center said Monday.
</P>
<P>
In light of recent outbreaks of avian flu at poultry farms in
Japan and South Korea, the Tainan center is paying extra
attention to the arrival of migratory birds from the north, said
Director Lee Chao-chuan.
</P>
<P>
Owing to the increased greenhouse effect, Lee said, the normal
schedule of migratory birds flocking south to spend the winter
has been disrupted, with some "winter birds" still traveling
south to Taiwan late while some "summer birds" have already
started migrating north before spring has even begun.
</P>
<P>
During this period, he said, problem birds could become "fish
escaping from the net" and cannot be monitored if the preventive
measures have loopholes.
</P>
<P>
News reports have also said that South Korea has culled nearly
250,000 chickens recently to try to prevent the spread of bird
flu.
</P>
<P>
Noting that as Taiwan and South Korea are on the same migration
routes for many migratory birds, Tainan -- a haven for wintering
migratory birds every year -- has spared no efforts in poultry
disease prevention, Lee said.
</P>
<P>
Noting that preventing contact between wild birds and domestic
animals is very important in avian flu prevention, all local
chicken and poultry farmers in Tainan City have finished erecting
wire fences in an attempt to keep their stock separated from wild
birds.
</P>
<P>
The Tainan City Animal Disease Control Center has also demanded
that poultry raisers sterilize their farms and carry out
collection and examination of wild bird droppings five times a
week.
</P>
<P>
Under these stringent measures, Lee said, no avian flu virus has
been discovered in Tainan since late last year.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam, Hong Kong and Japan have reported bird flu outbreaks
this month, while Indonesian officials said four people died
recently from the virulent H5N1 virus. Myanmar reported its first
H5N1 outbreak in chickens and quail last March at farms in
central Myanmar. Bird flu killed 42 of the 93 people infected in
Vietnam in 2003-2005.
</P>
<P>
Bird flu, which does not easily infect humans, has so far killed
161 people globally since 2003, a relatively small number
compared to other diseases, according to the World Health
Organization. But epidemiologists fear the H5N1 virus could
trigger a global pandemic if it were to mutate and become easily
transmitted among humans.
