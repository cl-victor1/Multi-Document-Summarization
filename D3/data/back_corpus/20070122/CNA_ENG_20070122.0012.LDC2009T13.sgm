PEOPLE WILL EXAMINE REASONS BEHIND KMT-PFP ALLIANCE: DPP CAUCUS
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  Jan.  22 (CNA) 01/22/07  14:11:49 (By Lilian Wu)
</P>
<P>
The legislative caucus of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) said Monday that the people will examine why the two
largest opposition parties rushed to forge an alliance.
</P>
<P>
Legislator Chen Chun-jun, caucus whip of the DPP, was responding
to the signing of an agreement between Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman
Ma Ying-jeou and People First Party (PFP) Chairman James Soong,
who is currently visiting the United States, in a videoconference
earlier the same day to cement bilateral cooperation on elections
and policies in the Legislative Yuan.
</P>
<P>
Chen said the timing of the signing of the alliance between the
KMT and PFP has raised suspicions in him.
</P>
<P>
Noting that Soong, after suffering a humiliating defeat in the
Taipei mayoral election in December, had said he wanted to bow
out of politics, Chen asked why he decided to sign an agreement
with the KMT at this time.
</P>
<P>
"Was it for the interests of their parties or for the public? "
Chen asked. He added that the people will examine whether the
alliance is aimed at working for the public's interests.
</P>
<P>
He also said he wonders whether the PFP will stop pursuing the
issue of the KMT's "ill-gotten" assets now that the two parties
have signed the agreement.
</P>
<P>
DPP Legislator Huang Wei-cher said that the tie-up of the two
parties represents the smaller PFP "being swallowed up" by the
larger KMT, adding that he does not view the alliance favorably.
</P>
<P>
He also said that for the DPP, the most urgent task is to
"coordinate the best candidates of the party in the runup to the
year-end legislative elections and presidential election in
2008."
