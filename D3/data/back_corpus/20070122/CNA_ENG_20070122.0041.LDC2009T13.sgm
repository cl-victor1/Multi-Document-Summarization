Senior defense officials will expound on the military response to
China's anti- satellite test and deployment of its advanced
Jian-10 jet fighters at an air base approximately 500 kilometers
from Taiwan, military sources said Monday.
</P>
<P>
According to the sources, the Ministry of National Defense (MND)
will hold a pre-Chinese New Year news conference in which
officials from the ministry's intelligence,  operations and
training and standard development departments will elaborate on
military response measures in face of China's intensified
military buildup.

<P>
U.S. authorities said last Friday that China conducted an anti-
satellite test earlier this month in which an old Chinese weather
satellite was destroyed by a missile.
</P>
<P>
The report has raised concerns in Asia and the United States
about the rising militarization  of space and prompted  their
governments to demand explanations from Beijing. Analysts said
China's weather satellites would travel at about the same
altitude as U.S. spy satellites, so the test represented an
indirect threat to U.S. defense systems.
</P>
<P>
MND spokesman Wu Chi-fang said the military has full knowledge of
China's  anti- satellite  test  and has collected  all relevant
intelligence. He said China's development of anti-satellite
missiles will not only aggravate its threat to Taiwan but will
also pose a threat to the whole world.
</P>
<P>
At to China's deployment of Jian-10 (or J-10) fighters, Wu said
the military will soon release information concerning the impact
of China's deployment of J-10 fighters.
</P>
<P>
China's state-controlled TV station aired videos last month
showing that batches of the J-10 fighters -- both single-seat
J-10A and two-seat J-10B -- had entered operational service.
Unconfirmed reports said the J-10 fighters are deployed in
Zhejiang Province, one of the three Chinese coastal provinces
along the Taiwan Strait.
