Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng said Monday that a motion
for the legislature to hold an extraordinary session must be
initiated before Wednesday to provide time for inter-party
discussions on the issue.
</P>
<P>
"It has to be before Jan. 24, otherwise there won't be enough
time to prepare a meeting of whips of ruling and opposition
parties at the legislature for talks on whether or not to convene
an extra session, " Wang explained, noting such talks have been
tentatively set for Jan. 29.
</P>
<P>
"It is part of the consensus between ruling and opposition
parties," Wang said.
</P>
<P>
The ruling  Democratic  Progressive  Party (DPP)  has been
considering jointly initiating the motion with its ally, the
Taiwan Solidarity Union, after the legislative session ended Jan.
19 without passage of the 2007 central government budget and
several other significant bills.
</P>
<P>
The session ended in clashes between lawmakers of the ruling and
opposition parties over an opposition-proposed draft bill on the
organization of the Central Election Commission after the speaker
of the Legislative Yuan was blocked by DPP legislators from
reaching the podium to launch a vote on the bill.
</P>
<P>
Asked whether he will push for the disciplining of the lawmakers
who obstructed the legislative proceedings, Wang said he has not
yet decided what to do.
