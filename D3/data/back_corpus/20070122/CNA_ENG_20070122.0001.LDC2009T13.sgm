U.S. CONGRESSMAN CONDEMNS MEXICAN SNUB AGAINST PRESIDENT CHEN
</HEADLINE>

Washington,  Jan. 20 (CNA) 01/22/07  01:42:24 (By Jorge Liu and
Sofia Wu)
</P>
<P>
Rep. Tom Tancredo (R-Colo) , a senior member of the House
Committee on International Relations, inserted an extension of
remarks into the Congressional Record on Jan. 19 criticizing the
Mexican government for not allowing Republic of China President
Chen Shui-bian to fly over Mexican air space on his way to Los
Angeles from Nicaragua earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
Tancredo, a fervent Taiwan supporter who introduced a resolution
calling for U.S.-Taiwan diplomatic relations in the last
Congress, has officially announced his presidential bid.
</P>
<P>
The Congressman also blamed China for having pressured the
Mexicans into refusing President Chen's plane to fly over Mexican
airspace.
</P>
<P>
Tancredo writes: "In all likelihood, Mexico 's sudden change of
heart is attributable to pressure exerted by the People's
Republic of China. Beijing has been relentless in its efforts to
isolate our democratic friends on Taiwan, and this shameless move
by the mainland is just the latest in a long series of
indignities that the Beijing authorities have visited on the
Taiwanese people."
</P>
<P>
The Congressman  adds:  "By outsourcing  their campaign of
intimidation to other countries like Mexico - who seem more than
willing to subcontract their foreign policy to Beijing - China
continues to drive the people of Taiwan further and further
away."
</P>
<P>
He concludes: "I hope that the next time Taiwan 's democratically
elected president visits the United States; we can host him here
in Washington."
</P>
<P>
Mexico abruptly rescinded its permission for President Chen's
plane to fly through its flight information region under pressure
from China, forcing the plane to make a detour around Mexican
airspace on its way from Nicaragua to Los Angeles for a brief
transit stop. Chen visited Nicaragua Jan. 9-11 to attend the
inauguration of Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega. Because of
Mexico's unexpected about-face, Chen delayed his arrival in Los
Angeles by five hours.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, members of the Formosan Association for
Public Affairs (FAPA) are sending letters to Mexican Ambassador
to the United States Carlos de Icaza Gonzalez, protesting the
cowardly behavior by the Mexican government.
</P>
<P>
They write: "This denial of fly-over has indelibly hurt the
Taiwanese feelings toward the people of Mexico who, after all,
are being perceived worldwide as open-minded and friendly.
Furthermore, President Chen came to Los Angeles as a guest of the
United States. It is clearly not up to your government to
sabotage such an effort."
</P>
<P>
FAPA President C.T. Lee states: " Mexico's behavior last week was
not only unacceptable but cowardly and shameful as well. With
forcing Mexico to treat President Chen this way, Beijing hit a
new low. With these dastardly deeds, Beijing not only harassed
and offended Taiwan, but everybody else who cares about Taiwan
such as Congressman Tancredo."
</P>
<P>
FAPA is a Washington-based non-profit organization that seeks to
build up international support for Taiwan's cause.
