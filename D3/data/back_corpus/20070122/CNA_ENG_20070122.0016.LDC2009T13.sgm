MONTH
</HEADLINE>

Taipei, Jan. 22 (CNA) 01/22/07  15:38:42 (By Lilian Wu)
</P>
<P>
The Taipei-Banciao section of the nation's first bullet train
system is expected to open between early February and Chinese New
Year, which falls on Feb. 18 this year.
</P>
<P>
After the inauguration of the section, the 19 northbound and 19
southbound trains each day between Zuoying, Kaohsiung and
Banciao, Taipei County will be extended to Taipei City.
</P>
<P>
As Banciao Station will no longer serve as the northern terminus
of the high- speed railway, the period of time each train remains
at the station will be shortened to between two and three
minutes, or the same length of time as at other stations along
the railway.
</P>
<P>
The Taipei-Banciao section will be the shortest distance of the
345-km high speed railway, with the standard fare being NT$40
(US$1.22). The Taipei-Taoyuan fare will be NT$160, the Taipei-
Hsinchu fare will be NT$290, the Taipei-Taichung fare will be
NT$700, the Taipei-Chiayi fare will be NT$1,080, the Taipei-
Tainan fare will be NT$1,350, and the Taipei-Kaohsiung will be
NT$1,490.
</P>
<P>
Nine engineering experts inspected the system's 5-kilometer
section linking Banciao with Taipei City over the weekend. The
experts will point out any flaws or deficiencies that need to be
dealt with when they deliver their report to the Ministry of
Transportation and Communications (MOTC) later Monday.
</P>
<P>
The MOTC will approve the inauguration of the final section only
after it is assured that the Taiwan High Speed Rail Corp. (THSR)
has dealt with all safety concerns.
</P>
<P>
The THSR began its bullet train service between Banciao and
Zuoying Jan. 5. The offering of discount fares was originally
scheduled to end Jan. 14 but was later extended to Jan. 31 due to
some embarrassing technical glitches, particularly with the
ticketing system.
</P>
<P>
The Bureau of High Speed Rail under the MOTC said that if there
are any major deficiencies discovered before the Jan. 31, the
bureau will fine the THSR any time.
</P>
<P>
After Feb. 1, if the THSR's ticketing system still has glitches,
then there will be continuous fines, bureau officials said,
adding that the THSR will start selling tickets for the Chinese
New Year holidays on Feb. 3, which they pointed out will provide
an opportunity for closer observation of the railway's ticketing
system.
