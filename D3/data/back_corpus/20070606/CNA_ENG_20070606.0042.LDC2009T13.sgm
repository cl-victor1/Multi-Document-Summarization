TAIWAN ASKS CHINA TO RESUME TALKS ON CROSS-STRAIT ISSUES: MAC
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taipei,   June  6  (CNA) 06/06/07  22:52:03 (By T.C. Jiang)
</P>
<P>
Taiwan  has asked China to resume negotiations on three bilateral
issues and is awaiting Beijing's reply, according to the Mainland
Affairs Council (MAC) Chairman Chen Ming-tong.
</P>
<P>
Whether the issues can be resolved will serve as an indicator of
the possibility of opening discussions on other cross-Taiwan
Strait issues, Chen stressed.
</P>
<P>
Chen made the remarks Monday during an interview with Hong Kong
China News Agency.
</P>
<P>
Chen said that soon after assuming his position he twice used
existing channels to ask China to return to the stalled
negotiations on allowing Chinese tourists to visit Taiwan, as
well as on cargo and passenger chartered flights.
</P>
<P>
Before assuming his chairmanship, Chen said that the MAC had
engaged in seven rounds of negotiation on cargo and passenger
chartered flights, and five rounds on allowing visitors from
China to Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Basic technical problems have been resolved, according to Chen,
however, the two sides cannot reach an agreement on the wording
of the agreement.
</P>
<P>
During the fourth round of talks, Beijing included a statement
saying that "residents in mainland China visit Taiwan, China" in
their version of agreement, Chen noted.
</P>
<P>
Also, Jia Qinglin, chairman of the National Committee of the
Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), said
late April that private visits between Taiwan and China are not
journeys between two countries, Chen continued.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan regarded the statement and Jia's remarks as unacceptable
"political framework," Chen stressed.
</P>
<P>
Taipei proposed its own version of the agreement in the wake of
the fourth round held early February, and has yet to receive any
response from Beijing, Chen said, adding that the Taipei version
uses neutral, non-contentious wording.
</P>
<P>
Chen also responded to China's Taiwan Affairs Office spokesman Li
Weiyi's May 16 remarks by reiterating that Taiwan has made two
requests to resume the talks with China and is awaiting a reply.
</P>
<P>
Li said that Taiwan has not yet replied to Chinese proposals made
during the fifth round of talks.
</P>
<P>
Describing the three issues as "very important, " Chen said that
allowing Chinese tourists to visit Taiwan will increase the
mutual understanding of peoples on both sides of the strait and
that the opening of the chartered flights could act as a prelude
to cross-strait direct transport.
