INDUSTRIAL, BUSINESS SECTORS FRET OVER WAGE HIKE

Taipei,   June  6  (CNA) 06/06/07  17:12:30 (By Deborah Kuo)

Members of the country's trade and industrial sectors were at
loggerheads with the administration Wednesday over the issue of a
9.09 percent minimum wage hike, fretting that the increase might
trigger an industrial exodus.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on Premier Chang Chun-hsiung's announcement earlier in
the day that the country's minimum wage is to be hiked to
NT$17,280 (US$523.64) per month and the hourly wage raised to
NT$95 July 1, Ho Yu, a standing board member of the Taipei-based
Chinese National Federation of Industries (CNFI) , said the
business sector will bear the brunt of the wage hike but the
impact will in turn send shockwaves through the industrial
manufacturing sector, which could eventually cause an industrial
exodus.
</P>
<P>
Ho said that although the minimum wage is poised to be raised by
9.09 percent, business and industrial operators are expected to
witness an increase of 11 percent in their salary and benefit
payments to their workers as premiums for labor insurance and
health insurance will be hiked and contributions to employees'
retirement pensions will also be raised.
</P>
<P>
This incur upon them an extra financial burden to the tune of
NT$36 billion nationwide each year, Ho estimated.
</P>
<P>
He added that the 9.09 percent hike is not expected to affect the
industrial manufacturing sector too seriously, with only about
70,000 people impacted.
</P>
<P>
However, operators of retail businesses, including department
stores, restaurants, chain stores and supermarkets, are expected
to be affected the most, because most of them employ part-time or
hourly paid workers.
</P>
<P>
Ho said members of the CNFI groups will not organize street
protests over the issue but warned that they will simply lay off
workers and change their business strategies in order to lower
their operational overheads.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Huang Mao-hsiung, chairman of the Taipei-based Chinese
National Association of Industry and Commerce, also expressed
worry over the imminent wage hike.
</P>
<P>
Huang said the Council of Labor Affairs (CLA) should make more
careful studies when trying to put forward coping measures to
help alleviate the impact of the hike on small-  and medium-sized
enterprises.
</P>
<P>
CLA Chairman Lu Tien-lin said that same day that about 1.41
million "marginal" members of the country's workforce --
including foreign laborers, part-time workers,  senior citizens
who have returned to the employment arena after retirement and
female workers -- are expected to benefit from the wage hike.
