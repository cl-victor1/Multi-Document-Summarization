Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) Chairman Chen Ming-tong voiced
reservations Wednesday about proposals to shorten the time needed
to allow Chinese spouses and citizens to gain residence permits
and partake in state examinations, saying that it would do no
good to make the change precipitously.
</P>
<P>
Chen made the comments while answering inquiries from reporters
after two proposed amendments to the Statute Regarding the
Relations Between the People of the Taiwan Area and the People of
the Mainland Area, put forward respectively by main opposition
Kuomintang (KMT) lawmakers Wu Chih-yang and Lee Chiang-an to
serve that end, failed to pass a legislative meeting for
substantial screening.
</P>
<P>
One of the amendments called for a shortening of the existing
requirement of eight-year residence in Taiwan to four years for
Chinese spouses to gain Republic of China ID cards, while the
other proposed that Chinese immigrants be given the right to take
part in state examinations  so long as they have had their
household registered in Taiwan for more than 10 years.
</P>
<P>
According to Chen, it is not prudent to rashly push for policy
shifts at the current time as the existing rules have been in
place for years, and a sudden change may bring additional
complications due to the special and delicate relations between
Taiwan and China.
</P>
<P>
The two amendments were boycotted by "pan-green" lawmakers of the
ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) and its ally, the
Taiwan Solidarity Union, and the meeting was dismissed following
a vote by the "pan-green" camp to adjourn the session.
