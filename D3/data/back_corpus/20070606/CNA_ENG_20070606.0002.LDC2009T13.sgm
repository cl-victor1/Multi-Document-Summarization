A new political party is scheduled to be launched in the southern
county of Kaohsiung June 15 to push for the establishment of an
agriculture ministry, organizers said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The new party, to be named the Taiwan Farmers Party, will not
install a chairman and will instead opt for collective
leadership, organizers said.
</P>
<P>
In the initial stage, a 20-to-30-member group will be formed to
lead the party. The group will be composed of scholars, experts,
representatives of grassroots farmers and disadvantaged people,
organizers said.

<P>
Claiming that the Cabinet-level Council of Agriculture is not
powerful enough to protect and boost farmers' interests and
rights, Chang Yung-cheng, secretary- general of the Taiwan
Provincial Farmers Association, said the new party will give
priority to pushing for the creation of a ministry of agriculture
to map out sustainable agricultural development policies and
better protect farmers' rights and interests.
