A senior defense official said Wednesday that it is not
optimistic that China will remove its missiles targeting Taiwan
to pave the way for cross-strait talks.
</P>
<P>
Vice Chief of the General Staff Peng Sheng-chu made the remarks
while giving a report on how to cope with high-tech development
of the military at a meeting of the Legislative Yuan's National
Defense Committee.
</P>
<P>
Legislator Lin Yu-feng of the opposition Kuomintang (KMT) noted
that KMT presidential candidate Ma Ying-jeou said recently that
China removing the missiles is a prerequisite for the holding of
cross-strait talks, asking Peng to give his comment on Ma's
remarks.
</P>
<P>
Peng said that he cannot give his personal opinion but that the
Ministry of National Defense (MND) is not optimistic that China
will easily remove the missiles.
</P>
<P>
Lin also noted that China has 11 guided missile bases at which
missiles aimed at Taiwan have been deployed, asking Peng which of
the bases poses the greatest threat to Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Peng said that the point is not which base poses the greatest
threat, noting that any missiles that can reach Taiwan proper
represent a threat.
</P>
<P>
President Chen Shui-bian recently called for China to honor the
Olympic spirit of fostering world peace by removing all the
nearly 1,000 missiles it has deployed against Taiwan. Beijing
will host the 2008 Olympic Games.
