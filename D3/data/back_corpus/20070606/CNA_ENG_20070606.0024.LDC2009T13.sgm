National Chiao Tung University (NCTU) in Hsinchu City is to
establish a new research center for intelligent prosthetics,
specializing in assisting the physically impaired with advanced
bionic devices or biomedical technology, NCTU President Wu Chung-
yu announced Wednesday at a press conference in Taipei.
</P>
<P>
Wu also noted that the center will be headed by Liu Wen-tai, a
professor at the University of California, Santa Cruz. Liu, who
has been devoted to the research and development of electronic
eyes for years, said that with the help of the center, the
improvement project on the existing generation of electronic eyes
should provide fruitful results.
</P>
<P>
The first generation of electronic eye -- developed and tested in
the United States -- employs a 16-pixel chip as an artificial
light receptor. When implanted into the eye, the device can
replace a dysfunctional retina, providing partial vision to the
patient.
</P>
<P>
For the second-generation work, the light-sensing matrix will be
expanded to 8x8 pixels to provide wider vision and the power will
be provided by wireless transmission to allow greater head
movements. The improved version will soon enter human testing
both in the U.S. and Taiwan, according to Liu.
</P>
<P>
Besides visual enhancement devices, Liu noted that the center
will also focus on non-medical electronic devices, such as ones
that can help paralyzed patients regain body control by
invigorating body parts with electric currents, or ones that can
alleviate syndromes related to depression by stimulating certain
areas of the brain.
