Sydney,  June 6 (CNA) 06/06/07  23:22:12 (By Chen Ming-lung and
Sofia Wu)

<P>
Health Minister Hou Sheng-mou arrived in Sydney Wednesday at the
head of a delegation of health officials and medical
professionals to attend a ministerial-level meeting of the Asia-
Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum.
</P>
<P>
Hou said Taiwan delegates will share Taiwan's experience in fight
against contagious diseases and promote cooperation with other
APEC members in epidemic control during the two-day APEC health
ministers meeting scheduled for Thursday through Friday.
</P>
<P>
"We'll  speak  on three  topics,  namely  interdisciplinary
cooperation, regional and global cooperation in avian flu
prevention, and socio-economic impact of AIDS in the Asia-Pacific
area, " Hou said,  adding that the Taiwan delegation  will share
Taiwan's successful experience in stemming spread of AIDS in
addition to expressing its hope for further cooperation with
other countries in avian flu prevention.
</P>
<P>
According to Hou, Taiwan has succeeded in driving down the number
of new AIDS infections through intensified efforts in containing
spread of the deadly virus among drug addicts by providing them
with clean syringes.
</P>
<P>
Over the past few years, Hou said, the Department of Health has
cooperated closely with the Narcotics Hazard Control Center and
Drug Control Center in curtailing AIDS spread among drug addicts.
"We feel compelled to provide our experience in this regard for
other APEC countries to emulate," he added proudly.
</P>
<P>
Hou said he will also suggest other countries to step up
inspection of carry-on luggage to avert spread of communicable
diseases.
</P>
<P>
As Taiwan's cooperation with Australia and several other APEC
member states in avian flu prevention drill last year was a great
success, Hou said he will suggest that similar exercise be held
again this year to hone emergency or disaster response skills.
