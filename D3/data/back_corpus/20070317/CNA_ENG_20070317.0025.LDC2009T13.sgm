Vice President Annette Lu said in the northern Hsinchu City
Saturday that Taiwan manufacturers should focus on research and
development and create their own brands.
</P>
<P>
The vice president floated her "3B" theory -- brain, brand and
bridge -- saying that Taiwan manufacturers should make their
brands shine in the international community and that Taiwan
should serve as a bridge for world businesses wanting to make
inroads into China.
</P>
<P>
Lu made the remarks while attending the inauguration of the
Science Park Exploration Museum at the Hsinchu Science Park in
northern Taiwan, which will mainly display exhibits related to
the development of Taiwan's high-tech sector and its science
parks.
</P>
<P>
Lu noted that the high-tech industry in Taiwan is booming and
that the production value of its semiconductor industry ranks
second-highest in the world, while the production value of its
wafers on an OEM basis tops the world.
</P>
<P>
The production value of large-size TFT and LCD monitors also
ranks top in the world, she noted.

<P>
Huang Der-ray, director of Hsinchu Science Park Administration,
said the inauguration of the museum marks the result of efforts
of the park and the city to attract visitors, noting that park
visitors can visit the museum, picturesque Chingshin lake in the
park, and the old Chinshan Temple nearby.
