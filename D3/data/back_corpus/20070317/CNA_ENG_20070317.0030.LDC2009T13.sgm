The opposition Kuomintang (KMT) and People First Party (PFP) has
reached a tentative agreement to jointly field acandidate through
public poll results to run in a by-election for Keelung mayor,
PFP spokesman Lee Hung-chun said Saturday.

<P>
According  to Lee,  KMT Secretary-General  Wu Duen-yih has
telephoned the PFP to express the party's willingness to select a
common candidate to represent the two parties which constitue the
'pan-blue alliance' to vie for the Keelung mayoral post, which
has been left vacant by former Mayor Hsu Tsai-li, who died of a
stroke last month.
</P>
<P>
However, Lee pointed out that the tentative agreement requires
that the potential candidate must enjoy at least a 3 percent lead
over his rivals in poll results before he or she can be jointly
fielded by the new KMT-PFP alliance.

PFP lawmaker Liu Wen-hsiung, who has announced his bid to contest
the Keelung mayoral by-election, slated for April 12, said the
most important thing is that there can only be a single "pan-
blue" candidate to avoid a "pan-blue" split in the race.

KMT legislative caucus whip Hsu Shao-ping and Chang Tung-jung, a
KMT member who serves as Keelung city council speaker, have also
displayed their desire to take part in the race.
