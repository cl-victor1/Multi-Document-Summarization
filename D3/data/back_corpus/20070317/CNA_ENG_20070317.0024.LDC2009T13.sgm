A tourism promotion mission from Taiwan is taking part in travel
fairs in Singapore and Malaysia in order to help attract tourists
to the country, a group member said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
According to the member, the group, composed of officials from
the Taipei city government, the Tourism Bureau under the Ministry
of Transportation  and Communications and the semi-official
Taiwan Visitors Association,  as well as those from local
government officials from eastern Hualien County and the
Singapore Trade Office in Taipei, began attending a three-day
international travel fair Friday in the Malaysian capital of
Kuala Lumpur.
</P>
<P>
The group is slated to proceed to Singapore next week, where they
will exhibit in a travel fair from March 23-25.

To help the Singaporean and Malaysian people gain a better
understanding of Taiwan's folk culture, a troupe of performers is
also traveling with the group to perform Taiwanese religious
rituals at the world-class travel exhibitions.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan is keen on courting foreign tourists, as the government
has set a goal of doubling the number of foreign tourist arrivals
by 2008.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the number of tourists from Singapore and Malaysia to
Taiwan grew by 10.8 percent and 7.1 percent, respectively, year
on year, relevant statistics showed.
