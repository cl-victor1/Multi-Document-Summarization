TAIWAN ENVOY DISPUTES `SLOW-BOILED FROG' ALLUSION

London, March 16 (CNA) 03/17/07  13:25:21 (By Jennifer Huang and

Taiwan rejects the Hong Kong model of "one country, two systems"
unification with China, Taiwan's representative to Britain has
reiterated in a "letter to the editor" of The Economist weekly.
</P>
<P>
Edgar Lin wrote in the letter posted in the weekly's March 16 Web
edition that the Hong Kong formula is nothing but proof of how a
totalitarian system like Beijing's is incompatible with a working
democracy.
</P>
<P>
To the Taiwanese people, Lin wrote, it is imperative that their
condition of preserving the Taiwanese democratic system and
dignity of its people is met -- only then can Taiwan openly
engage China at the negotiating table.
</P>
<P>
Lin's letter was a response to an article carried in The
Economist's March 7 Asian edition that likened Taiwan's
increasing trade dependence on China as being on a par with the
"subtle, slow-boiling of a frog" and predicted that Taiwan could
be peacefully unified with China in 20 years.
</P>
<P>
Rebutting the allusion as falling short of the truth through its
"suggestion of ignorance and passivity," Lin wrote that Taiwan is
fully aware of the potential pitfalls of its economic embracing
of China and has taken care to see that the process remains under
control.
</P>
<P>
"Indeed, there is a strong awareness, particularly within the
circles of power, of the dangers of succumbing to China's
dangling of economic carrots. While the carrots are too big to
ignore completely, the Taiwanese government and people take care
to see that the process remains under control, " Lin wrote,
adding that this is partly the reasoning behind President Chen
Shui-bian's recent "four wants" rhetoric, a reminder to all of
the threat that China could pose to Taiwan's freedom and
democracy if the situation were to spiral out of control.
</P>
<P>
The "four wants" refer to Chen's yearning for independence, a new
constitution, development and a change of the country's official
name from the Republic of China to Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Lin wrote, Taiwan has no intention of provoking
China and that as an independent actor, is willing to work toward
a peaceful resolution through rational negotiation.
