DEMOCRACY FADING IN TAIWAN: KMT LAWMAKERS
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  March 17 (CNA) 03/17/07  17:54:06 (By Flor Wang)

Amid a series of moves launched by the ruling party to purge
Taiwan of the lingering influence of the late President Chiang
Kai-shek, main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) lawmakers accused the
government of eroding Taiwan's international image because of the
moves.
</P>
<P>
KMT lawmakers, including party legislative whips Hsu Shao-ping
and Kuo Su-chun, blasted the ruling Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) and the government after the United Daily News reported
earlier that day that The Economist magazine alleges in its
latest issue that the DPP's recent string of name changes is
comparable to China's Cultural Revolution from 1966-1976.
</P>
<P>
"How can Taiwan's human rights and democracy be fully protected
if the DPP devotes its energy to tasks like pulling down Chiang
statues and changing street names?" Hsu asked.
</P>
<P>
Kuo voiced her grave concern that the DPP's approach has further
worsened ethnic rifts and undermined Taiwan's international image
and could lead Taiwan to a catastrophe. "The DPP government has
lost its bearings," she claimed.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, DPP legislativee caucus whip Wang To expressed his
dissatisfaction with The Economist report that Taiwan is
launching another Cultural Revolution.
</P>
<P>
Arguing that the government's name change campaign is far beyond
compare with the Cultural Revolution, Wang said the report
indicates that Europeans lack a profound understanding of the
tragedy.
</P>
<P>
According to Wang, Chiang is not so great as the KMT has touted
and the facts behind the injustice and resentment that he caused
in Taiwan must be unearthed, including the 228 Incident of 1947
in which thousands of Taiwanese elite were massacred by KMT
troops.
