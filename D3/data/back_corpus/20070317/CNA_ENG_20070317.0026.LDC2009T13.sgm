Major manufacturers in the Hsinchu Science Park voiced their
concerns to Vice President Annette Lu when she inspected the park
Saturday, complaining that there is not enough high-tech research
and development talent and saying that they hope the government
can allow more foreign laborers to work in the park.

<P>
They also said they still want to set up plants in the park or in
its peripheral regions, despite Lu's suggestion that they
relocate to science parks in central and southern Taiwan as the
development of land and human resources at the Hsinchu Science
Park has almost hit saturation.
</P>
<P>
On cross-Taiwan Strait policy, the manufacturers expressed hope
that the government will not think investment in China is bad for
Taiwan, as it is part of their strategy of going global for the
sake of enhancing competitiveness.
