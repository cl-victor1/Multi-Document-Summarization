<P>
Premier Su Tseng-chang dismissed Saturday media reports that
there will be salary hikes for military personnel, civil
servants, teachers and laborers.
</P>
<P>
The premier said the reports are incorrect, noting that salary
hikes require an overall assessment and that he has "no set
proposals, nor has he received related reports."
</P>
<P>
He was responding to reports by the United Daily News, a mass-
circulation local newspaper, that he has continued to deliver
pork barrel announcements now that he has announced his bid to
represent the ruling Democratic Progressive Party in the 2008
presidential election. The paper quoted the premier as telling a
legislature Friday that the central government finances show the
first balance in eight years in 2006 and that if they continue to
improve, the salaries of military personnel, civil servants and
teachers should be raised.

<P>
After attending a seminar on Taiwan's democratic rise under the
shadow of China's hegemony, Su said that although 2006 recorded a
rare financial balance, a salary hike requires an overall
assessment.
</P>
<P>
"The Cabinet has not conducted any such assessment, " he pointed
out.
</P>
<P>
As for a reasonable minimum monthly wage for laborers, which was
set at NT$15,840 in 1997 and has remained unchanged for a decade,
he said this will have to take into consideration national
economic development.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Council for Economic Planning and Development (CEPD)
Chairwoman Ho Mei-yueh said the CEPD has not discussed salary
hikes.
</P>
<P>
The head of the nation's top economic charter reiterated that the
finance or economic ministries have yet to reach conclusion on
salary hikes or upward adjustments of the minimum wage.
