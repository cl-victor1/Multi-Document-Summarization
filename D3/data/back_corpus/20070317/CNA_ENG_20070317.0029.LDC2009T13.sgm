NEW MPS II MEDICINE TO BENEFIT TAIWANESE PATIENTS

A newly developed medicine to treat Mucopolysaccharidosis II (MPS
II) disease -- also called Hunter Syndrome -- will benefit nine
patients in Taiwan, Tsai Chiung-wei, founder of the Taiwan
Mucopolysaccharidosis Association said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Tsai said the new medicine, named Elaprase, is the first product
to treat the rare inherited disease caused by deficiency of a
specific enzyme to metabolize mucopolysaccharide in human body,
which leaves the patient with severe organ damage.
</P>
<P>
MPS II has more patients than other types of MPS disease. Taiwan
has 49 patients who have MPS II, but only nine of them -- aged
from 5-22 -- are able to be treated with Elaprase. The other
patients are either too young or have brain damage that is too
advanced to be treated by the medicine.
</P>
<P>
Medicines for MPS I and VI developed several years ago have
helped five and seven Taiwanese patients, respectively, Tsai
added.
</P>
<P>
Lo Yan, a thirteen- year-old student with MPS II, is the first
patient to receive Elaprase treatment in Taiwan. His father said
they have been waiting for three years for the medicine since
Japan announced the start of clinical tests.
</P>
<P>
Tsai said Taiwan is the first country in Asia to cover the cost
of the medicine with national health insurance. A patient like Lo
would have to pay NT$1.6 million (US$48,341) per month if it were
not covered by health insurance.
</P>
<P>
Lin Hsuan-pei, director of pediatric genetics at Mackay Memorial
Hospital, said the medicine is a synthetic enzyme that stops
accumulation of mucopolysaccharide in the body and helps extend
the patient's life.
