Taipei,  March 17 (CNA) 03/17/07  13:04:08 (By Sofia Wu)
</P>
<P>
A series of public opinion polls have underlined a growing sense
of Taiwanese consciousness in local society, with those
perceiving themselves as Taiwanese outnumbering those identifying
themselves as Chinese, officials said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The officials from the Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) made the
remarks in terms of the council's latest working report that
collated and analyzed the results of 49 public opinion polls
conducted by various institutions last year, including four
commissioned by the MAC itself, about local people's notions and
viewpoints on relations across the Taiwan Strait.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, 39 percent to 60 percent of the
respondents to the 49 opinion surveys identified themselves as
Taiwanese, while those considering themselves Chinese ranged
between less than 10 percent and 17 percent.
</P>
<P>
Regarding the development of cross-strait relations, maintaining
the broadly defined status quo remained mainstream opinion, with
the percentage reaching 71 percent to 92 percent in all the
surveys.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, 78 percent to 89 percent of those interviewed said
only Taiwan's people are entitled to determine Taiwan's future or
its relationship with China.
</P>
<P>
A majority of 60 percent to 77 percent of the respondents said
they have sensed China's hostility toward Taiwan's democratically
elected government, while 41 percent to 46 percent said they felt
Chinese ill-will toward individual Taiwanese people.
</P>
<P>
On the possibility of a Chinese invasion of Taiwan, 49 percent to
60 percent said they feel that China's military expansion poses a
threat to Taiwan and other Asian countries.
</P>
<P>
As to the speed of cross-strait exchanges, 31 percent to 36
percent said the pace is "exactly right;" 54 percent to 77
percent said they feel that too much Taiwanese investment in
China will have a negative impact on Taiwan; and more than half
in all the surveys support stricter management and control of
cross- strait commercial exchanges.
</P>
<P>
In contrast, nearly 70 percent support opening to Chinese
tourists and 48 percent to 62 percent said they believe that the
new "open-door" policy will have positive effects on cross-strait
ties.
</P>
<P>
As for cross-strait transport links, 70 percent to 76 percent
said national security should be a concern or an element in all
feasibility studies on opening direct shipping and flight
services, while 76 percent said the direct links policy should be
promoted in a gradual manner with certain strings attached.
</P>
<P>
Up to 53 percent said convenient transport services would
increase local people's desire to visit China, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Also, a majority of 64 percent to 68 percent said the government
should continue to promote pragmatic diplomacy and 71 percent to
79 percent said they support a proposal that the government apply
for U.N. membership under the name of Taiwan.
