Taiwan has succeeded in reducing entry of illegal Chinese
immigrants, with the number of Chinese citizens pending
repatriation dropping to 400 from thousands just two years ago,
the country's top China policy planner said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"Our efforts to crack down on illegal Chinese immigrants in the
past year have paid off as Chinese citizens held at our detention
centers pending repatriation has slid to a new low of 400, "
Mainland Affairs Council Chairman Joseph Wu said in an interview.

Amid rampant human trafficking across the Taiwan Strait a few
years ago, the government revised the statute governing cross-
strait exchanges in 2003 to allow for confiscation of vessels
used in smuggling Chinese citizens into Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Since then, the situation has gradually improved, Wu said, adding
that in 2006 alone, five boats used for smuggling Chinese
citizens to Taiwan were confiscated.
</P>
<P>
In the new year, Wu said, the government will continue its
clampdown on human trafficking. Moreover, he said, the MAC will
continue pushing for cross-strait cooperation in fighting crimes
across borders.
