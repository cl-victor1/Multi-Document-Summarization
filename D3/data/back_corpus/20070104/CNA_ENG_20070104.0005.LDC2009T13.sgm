U.S. TO PROCESS ROC PRESIDENT'S TRANSIT REQUESTS WITH STANDARD
POLICY

Washington,  Jan.  3 (CNA) 01/04/07  11:23:42 (By Chiehyu Lin and
Y.F. Low)

<P>
The U.S. government will process any requests from Taiwan for its
president to stop over in the United States based on the standard
principles of safety, convenience and dignity of the traveler, a
U.S. State Department official said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Sean McCormack, spokesman of the department, made the remarks
when asked during a daily press briefing how Washington will
handle a possible request from Taipei for President Chen Shui-
bian to make transit stops in the United States for his possible
visit to Nicaragua later this month.
</P>
<P>
"In terms of the transit, it's the standard policy that we have
consistent with our obligations and our 'one China' policy and
the Taiwan Relations Act and the three communiques," McCormack
said.
</P>
<P>
"We look at requests for transit consistent with the safety,
convenience and dignity of the traveler," he added.
</P>
<P>
On whether the United States has decided the city for Chen's
transit stop, McCormack said his department will inform the press
if there is any decision on the matter.
</P>
<P>
Media reports in Taipei have suggested that President Chen will
visit Nicaragua later this month to attend the Jan. 10
inauguration of President-elect Daniel Ortega and that Chen is
planning to stop over in major U.S. cities on his way to and back
from the Central American country.
</P>
<P>
However, ROC Minister of Foreign Affairs James Huang said
Wednesday that it remains uncertain whether the president will
attend Ortega's inauguration in person and that the ministry is
making the necessary arrangements.
</P>
<P>
Huang said the media speculation has caused many troubles and a
lot of confusion.
