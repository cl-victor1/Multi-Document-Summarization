KAOHSIUNG COUNTY PLANS SPECIAL ZONE FOR FLAMINGO FLOWER
PRODUCTION

Kaohsiung,   Jan.  4  (CNA) 01/04/07  21:27:15 (By Sofia Wu)

Kaohsiung County Magistrate Yang Chiu-hsiung promised Thursday to
designate a special zone in the southern county for production of
the flamingo flower, which has become one of the county's major
cash crops.
</P>
<P>
Yang made the offer while inspecting a horticulture and marketing
cooperative in Kaohsiung County's Neimen village, which accounts
for 16 hectares of the county's 20 hectares of flamingo flower
farms.
</P>
<P>
Lin Ching-shan, head of the Green Flower Cooperative, an umbrella
group for 40 horticulturists in Neimen responsible for domestic
and overseas marketing affairs, told Yang that Neimen is the only
Taiwan township that manages to export flamingo flowers to Japan
via sea.
</P>
<P>
"With advanced farming technology and stringent quality control,
we are very competitive in the flamingo flower market, " Lin
said, adding that Neimen exports an average of 2 million stems of
flamingo flower each year, with Japan accounting for 1.5 million
stems. The cooperative also began to export the gorgeous flower
to the European Union last year.
</P>
<P>
At present, Lin went on, the cooperative sells about 30,000 stems
of flamingo flower to Japan, the United States and the European
Union per week, with an annual turnover of about NT$100 million.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, he complained that the cooperative faces some
growth bottlenecks, including  unstable sources of supply and
inadequate production facilities.
</P>
<P>
"We keenly hope the county government will assist in setting up
an exclusive production zone and improving production facilities
so that we can further expand output and ensure a stable supply,"
Lin said.
</P>
<P>
In response,  Yang said the county government  will begin
preparations for creating a special flamingo flower production
zone.
</P>
<P>
Neimen used to be a stronghold of hog farming, but farmers were
forced to transform their businesses in 1997 when a foot-and-
mouth disease epidemic wiped out the local hog farming industry.
With the promotion of Lin and other horticulturists, many Neimen
farmers went into the flamingo flower business.
</P>
<P>
Apart from Neimen, several other southern Taiwan rural townships
have also focused on flamingo flower production. With their
dazzling beautiful colors and long blooming period, flamingo
flowers are popular with consumers and Taiwan exported more than
8 million stems last year, with Japan, the European Union, the
United States, China, Hong Kong and the United Arab Emirates as
its main sales outlets.
