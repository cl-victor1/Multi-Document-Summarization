WORKER LOYALTY ON THE WANE IN TAIWAN: POLL
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taipei,  Jan. 4 (CNA) 01/04/07  14:49:07 (By Y.F. Low)

The majority of workers in Taiwan stay for less than three years
on average in each job, a sign indicating worker loyalty is
decreasing in the country, according to the results of survey
released Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The survey, conducted by the magazine Career on 1,643 workers
from Dec. 7-16, found that with the exception of civil servants,
teachers and military personnel, few workers in Taiwan have not
changed jobs during their career.
</P>
<P>
While 59.4 percent of the workers change jobs at an average
frequency of less than three years, those in the 16-25 age group
have changed jobs more frequently than other age groups.
</P>
<P>
The survey shows that 31.5 percent of workers in the 16-25 age
group have stayed for less than one year on average at each job,
compared with 11 percent among workers in the 26-35 age group and
2 percent among those in the 36-45 age group.
</P>
<P>
A total of 43.5 percent of the workers have changed jobs two to
three times since entering the workforce, and 29.9 percent have
changed jobs four times or more, according to the survey.
</P>
<P>
A total of 11 percent of the workers said that in retrospect,
they discovered that they had given up a good job for a bad one,
while 41 percent found that there was no difference between their
new and old jobs.
</P>
<P>
While three-quarters of the respondents said they are thinking
about changing jobs after the Lunar New Year holiday, less than
40 percent said they will actually do so, with 18.2 percent
saying they "want very much to change jobs but there is no
opportunity" and 18.1 percent saying they "want very much to but
dare not try."
</P>
<P>
In addition to their increasing age, other reasons mentioned by
the respondents for their inaction include a lack of professional
skills and their inferior educational background.
