International call capacity between Taiwan and Japan, China, the
United States and Canada had been restored by 99 percent as of
Thursday after a major earthquake Dec. 26 that damaged a critical
hub of undersea cables off southern Taiwan, officials from
Chunghwa Telecom Corp. said.
</P>
<P>
Chunghwa Telecom has been renting transmission capacity from
private  cable operators  to  facilitate  the  return  of
telecommunications services over the past week, while preparing
for emergency repair work on four of six undersea cables that
were seriously damaged by the earthquake, the strongest recorded
in Taiwan's southernmost county of Pingtung in 100 years, the
officials said.
</P>
<P>
They said international call capacity between Taiwan and the
Philippines, Indonesia and Malaysia, meanwhile, had been restored
to 40 percent as of Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, five repair ships arrived in the affected area
Thursday to begin repair on four of the damaged cables.
</P>
<P>
The repairmen on the ships -- representing KOL, Retriever,
Segero, KPL and Restorer -- said that call capacity between
Taiwan and the Philippines, Singapore and Malaysia is expected to
be fully restored by Jan. 20, while all damaged points are
expected to be completely repaired by Jan. 30.
</P>
<P>
Chunghwa Telecom estimated that because of the quake damage, the
company's revenues will be slashed by around NT$100 million
(US$3.03 million) , while the repair of the damaged cables will
cost around NT$50 million.
</P>
<P>
The magnitude 6.7 earthquake struck at 8: 26 p.m. Dec. 26, with
the epicenter located 22.8 km southwest of Hengchun in Pingtung
County at a depth of 21.9 km. Two people died and some 40 others
were injured in the quake.
