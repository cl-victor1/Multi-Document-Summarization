Academics  at  a  seminar  on Taiwan-Japan-China ties said
Saturday that Taiwan should show more concern toward
democratization in other countries while strengthening democratic
alliances with the United States and Japan.
</P>
<P>
They made the remarks at a seminar held in Taipei the day after
Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao concluded a three-day "ice-melting"
trip to Japan, in which Wen and his Japanese counterpart Shinzo
Abe pledged to strengthen bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
Lo Fu-chuan, chairman of the Association of East Asia Relations,
a quasi- official organization established to deal with Japan on
behalf of Republic of China government in the absence of
diplomatic ties, noted that relations among Taiwan, Japan and
China are an important part of Asia's interaction.
</P>
<P>
Recently, Japan has put more effort into getting involved in
Asian affairs and has established closer ties with the United
States, India and the countries of the Association of Southeast
Asian Nations,  focusing  especially  on  their common  values
in democratization.
</P>
<P>
Lee Ming-chun, deputy secretary-general of the Taiwanese Society
of International Law, claimed there is no more hegemony in Asia,
where China, Japan, India and Australia all play important roles.
</P>
<P>
China and Japan need to ponder a new policy in the face of the
changing Asian situation, while Taiwan should not focus foreign
ties only with Japan, the U.S. and China, but should instead
develop diverse relations.
</P>
<P>
Lin Cheng-yi, a researcher of the Institute of European and
American Studies under the Academia Sinica, said ties between
Taiwan and Japan have been well maintained since the Democratic
Progressive Party took power and he called on the government to
continue strengthening relations with Japan.
</P>
<P>
Tamkang University Associate Professor Chang Wu-yueh said Taiwan
should consider how to keep its economic advantage amid the
growing call for Asian integration.
</P>
<P>
He suggested that Taiwan show more concern to other countries'
democratic development, especially China, adding that only when
the two countries reach consensus in democracy can peaceful
relations between the two be assured.
</P>
<P>
Saying that Japan-China and Taiwan-Japan relations are not a
zero-sum game, Loh Chih-cheng, a professor at Soochow University,
said he sees no need for Japan to sacrifice Taiwan's interests in
exchange for an improvement of its ties with China.
</P>
<P>
According to a recent survey, the people of both Taiwan and Japan
see each other as friendly countries, which Loh described as an
important fundamental for Taiwan-Japan relations.
