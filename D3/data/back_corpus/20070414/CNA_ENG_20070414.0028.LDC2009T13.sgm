LOSHENG SANATORIUM ACTIVISTS LOBBY INTERNATIONAL SUPPORT

Taipei,  April 14 (CNA) 04/14/07  19:49:28 (By Elisa Kao)

Activists dedicated to saving the Losheng leprosarium said
Saturday that officials of the United Nations and the U.S. State
Department have promised to lobby support for the survival of the
sanatorium.
</P>
<P>
Members of the patients' self-help organization made the remarks
at a press conference held at the Legislative Yuan after
concluding a trip to the U.N. headquarters and the U.S. State
Department in the last two weeks.
</P>
<P>
The activists said they were soliciting support to preserve 90
percent of the 4-hectare Losheng leprosarium as previously
promised by the Cabinet, which is at odds with the Taipei county
government on the matter. The county government plans to demolish
the sanatorium, which was built during Japanese colonial rule of
Taiwan, to make way for a metro construction project.
</P>
<P>
Yang You-jen, leader of the lobbying delegation, noted that the
government has been expressing its hope of entering the U.N. and
the World Health Organization (WHO) during the last decade.
However, Yang claimed that it has been violating U.N. and WHO
practice regarding the settlement of lepers.
</P>
<P>
The government's move not only runs counter to the world trend of
protecting patients' rights, but also goes against the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party's promise to protect human rights,
Yang claimed.
</P>
<P>
Other members of the lobbying group said the preservation of the
Losheng leprosarium is now not only a matter for Taiwan, but has
attracted much attention from around the world due to the
historical and cultural value of the sanatorium. They urged
Taipei County Magistrate Chou Hsi-wei not to continue "bullying"
less-privileged citizens in exchange for commercial development.
</P>
<P>
Chou claimed that the decision to tear down the sanatorium was
made by Premier Su Tseng-chang during his tenure as Taipei county
magistrate and that Su decided to change his past policy simply
because he is planning to run in the 2008 presidential election.
