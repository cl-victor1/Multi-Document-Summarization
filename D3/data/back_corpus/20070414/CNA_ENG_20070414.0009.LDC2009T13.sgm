Two-way trading volume at the Taichung Free Trade Zone (FTZ) in
2006 totalled 672,000 tons, with the value of the imports and
exports amounting to NT$8.41 billion (US$254.04 million) ,
according to statistics released by the Ministry of
Transportation and Communications (MOTC) Saturday.

<P>
MOTC tallies showed that Taichung FTZ was the most remarkable
among the country's five free trade zones in terms of trade
volume in 2006.
</P>
<P>
In line with a statute governing FTZ establishment and management
unveiled in 2003, five free trade zones have been opened at the
country's four major sea ports -- Keelung, Kaohsiung, Taipei
(Bali) and Taichung -- and at Taoyuan International Airport.

<P>
MOTC statistics indicated that the combined export and import
trade at the five FTZs increased significantly both in terms of
volume and value in 2006 from the year-earlier levels.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that the combined import and export volume at the
five zones can reach 802,000 tons, with a value totaling NT$112.2
billion, MOTC officials said.
</P>
<P>
At present, there are nine companies at Keelung FTZ, 15 at
Kaohsiung FTZ, 11 at Taichung FTZ, one at Taipei FTZ and 20 at
Taoyuan Aviation FTZ.
