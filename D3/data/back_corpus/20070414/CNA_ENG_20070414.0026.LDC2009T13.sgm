The ruling Democratic Progressive Party lawmakers suggested
Saturday that the central government decide location of gambling
district according to results of referendum suggested to hold in
each county and city.
</P>
<P>
Charles C. Chiang and Hsueh Ling came up with the suggestion to
let people decide if they want their residence to have a gambling
district, and allow the central government to consider in
priority the places that win more approvals in referendum
results.
</P>
<P>
The suggested idea was brought up after Premier Su Tseng-chang
said that he was "not against" the idea of having a referendum
about ban lifting of gambling industry in response to lawmaker
Kuo Chun-ming's questions.
