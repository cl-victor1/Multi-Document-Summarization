TAIWAN SHOULD KEEP DEMOCRACY GOING: EX-U.S. CONGRESSMAN
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  April 14 (CNA) 04/14/07  22:27:43 (By Y.C. Jou)

As long as Taiwan's democracy and trade continue to grow,
"problems will solve themselves," a visiting former U.S.
congressional leader said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Henry Hyde, a former chairman of the U.S. House International
Relations Committee, made the remarks while talking with a number
of reporters at his hotel room in Taipei, where he was to attend
a Sunday  conference  to be organized  by the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party on Taiwan's democratization.
</P>
<P>
Asked for comments on Taiwan's constitutional re-engineering
plan, Hyde said that rewriting a new constitution will "present
serious problems" as it will increase the tension across Taiwan
Strait. He suggested that amendments that bear no military or
geopolitical consequences and are highly domestic may be easier
accepted as not being a challenge to the status quo.

<P>
An active supporter of Taiwan's bid to negotiate a free trade
agreement (FTA) with the U.S. during his congressional term, Hyde
said a U.S.-Taiwan FTA is inevitable though he did not know how
soon will that be in place.
</P>
<P>
He said things are changing and there needs no hurry. "Just be
patient and keep things in balance."
</P>
<P>
Hyde praised Taiwan's democratic and economic achievement, saying
that in Asia "Taiwan is a shining example of progress and
stability within the context of a vigorous democracy."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he reminded Taiwan that China's military buildup is
worrisome and has the potential to change the status quo. He
urged Taiwan to strengthen its self- defense.
