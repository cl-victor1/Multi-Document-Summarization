<P>
First quarter revenues for major department stores in Taipei City
decreased compared with the same period of last year, according
to statistics made public Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The statistics showed that the revenues of SOGO Department
Store's business turnover decreased by 4 percent, while both Shin
Kong Mitsukoshi and Dayeh Takashimaya department stores
registered a 5 percent drop in their first quarter turnover.
</P>
<P>
Dayeh Takashimaya executives attributed the decrease mainly to an
abundance of department stores in the city and a reluctance on
the part of consumers to make purchases over the past few months.
