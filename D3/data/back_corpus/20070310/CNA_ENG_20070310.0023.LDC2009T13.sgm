The current ferry services between the two sides of the Taiwan
Strait will be adjusted in the near future, with a planned
opening for visits by Taiwan people to the Fujian Provincial area
in southeastern China for academic or business meetings, the
chairman of the Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) said Saturday.

Joseph Wu made the revelation on a radio talk show of the Taipei-
based Broadcasting Corporation of China. He explained that there
is still ample room to make adjustments to the ferry services
which link Chinese mainland with Taiwan-held outlying islands of
Kinmen and Matsu. Taiwan's government implemented the links in
2001.

Besides the planned opening for visitors to Fujian for academic
or business meetings, the government also plans to open Penghu
Island to Chinese tourists, Wu said, noting that administrative
authorities managing the opening are expected to implement the
measure soon.
