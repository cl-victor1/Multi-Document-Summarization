Taipei,  March 10 (CNA) 03/10/07  17:15:04 (By Elizabeth Hsu)
</P>
<P>
Taiwan has finally obtained permission to export Taiwan-grown
mangoes to Australia after three years of negotiations.
</P>
<P>
The Taipei Economic and Cultural Office (TECO) in Australia
reported the good news Friday, announcing in a press release that
Taiwan mangoes are expected to enter the Australian market later
this year following quarantine procedures.
</P>
<P>
According to TECO, the Taiwan mangoes will never affect the sales
of local mangoes in Australia because of the different harvest
seasons.
</P>
<P>
Encouraged by the success, Taiwan has begun efforts to gain
access to the Australian market for its other locally-grown
fruits, including lychees and star fruit, according to TECO.
