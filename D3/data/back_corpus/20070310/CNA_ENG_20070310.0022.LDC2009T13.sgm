</HEADLINE>

Kaohsiung,  March 10 (CNA) 03/10/07  20:52:03 (By Maubo Chang)

<P>
Opposition Kuomintang Legislator Chiu Yi announced his decision
Saturday to seek re-election in the year-end legislative
elections.
</P>
<P>
Calling himself one of the KMT's favorites in the legislative
elections, Chiu told his supporters at a public rally in the
southern port city that he prefers to enter the legislature again
via the ballot box,  rather  than by appointment by his party as
a legislator-at-large.
</P>
<P>
Chiu, who was cast into the limelight in 2004 for leading KMT
supporters in charging against the Kaohsiung Prosecutors' Office
on March 20 in an attempt to force prosecutors to seize the
ballot boxes after the KMT's presidential candidate, Lien Chan,
lost to President Chen Shui-bian by a razor margin in the
presidential election.
</P>
<P>
Chiu was thereby indicted on charges of obstructing official's
discharge of duties, and the case is still pending in the courts.
He told his supporters Saturday that even if he were to be
convicted, there is no question that he would be able to serve as
a legislator, claiming that he would still be able to carry out
his duties from his prison cell.
</P>
<P>
Well-known for his efforts to expose the administration's alleged
political scandals, Chiu has been indicted many times on slander
charges for airing ungrounded accusations against senior
officials.
</P>
<P>
He excused many of his own accusations that later turned out to
be false by saying Saturday that "beating the bush is necessary
to drive out the snakes."
