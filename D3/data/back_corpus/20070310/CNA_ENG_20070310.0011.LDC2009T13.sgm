DPP CHAIRMAN STICKS TO GUNS, REFUSES TO COMPROMISE ON PRIMARY

Taipei,  March 10 (CNA) 03/10/07  13:09:52 (By Sofia Wu)

<P>
Ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) Chairman Yu Shyi-kun
has reportedly refused to make any compromise on his stance that
a primary be held to determine the party's candidate for the 2008
presidential election, political sources said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
According to the sources, President Chen Shui-bian invited Vice
President Annette Lu, Premier Su Tseng-chang, former Premier
Frank Hsieh and Yu to a meeting at his official residence Friday
night to seek a way out of the DPP nomination fray.
</P>
<P>
It was the first such meeting since all of the four aspirants
completed their registration earlier this week for the party's
presidential primary.
</P>
<P>
During the hour-long meeting, Lu, Su and Hsieh all agreed that
President Chen should help mediate a solution to the nomination
fray, with the party's presidential  candidate  to be named
through negotiations, rather than a primary election, the sources
said, adding that Yu was the only one who disagreed.
</P>
<P>
Yu was quoted as having said he sees no feasibility of adopting a
mediation or negotiation approach to pick the party's
presidential candidate.
</P>
<P>
"What and how will we mediate? Given the differences between my
basic policy line and those of the three other contenders, how
can we determine our standardbearer for the coming presidential
election through negotiations or mediation? " Yu was quoted as
having asked at the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Yu reportedly asked the president why he had previously suggested
that the party's presidential ticket be decided via only a series
of public opinion polls, with the top two pairing up to form the
DPP ticket. In response, Chen said it was not his personal view.
</P>
<P>
Yu, a former premier who had also twice served as President
Chen's chief of staff, is widely seen as the most vocal advocate
of the DPP's core values of making Taiwan a normal, complete and
great country.
</P>
<P>
He reportedly said at the meeting that he will pick former Vice
Premier Yeh Chu- lan as his running mate if he wins the party's
nomination. He also explicitly ruled out the possibility of
choosing any of the three other contenders as his running mate.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that Lu reiterated during the meeting that she
will not withdraw from the DPP even if she fails to win the
party's nomination for the presidential race and that it is
unlikely she will team up with any other politician to form a
non-DPP ticket.
</P>
<P>
Premier Su was quoted as having said at the meeting that his
support for mediation or negotiation was not aimed at winning
political power but rather at promoting party unity and
coherence.
</P>
<P>
Presidential Office Secretary-General Chiou I-jen said if the
"mediation or negotiation" approach cannot be used in producing
the party's presidential ticket, a primary will be held to settle
the issue.
</P>
<P>
With no results achieved at Friday's meeting,  Chiou said
President Chen will invite the four bigwigs to a new round of
talks Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
According to the DPP's charter, a party primary should be held
after the negotiation approach fails.
</P>
<P>
Registration for the DPP's presidential primary ended Friday.
Party members will vote May 6, after which a series of public
opinion polls will be conducted. The vote by party members is
weighted to comprise 30 percent of a would-be candidate's score,
while the public opinion polls count for 70 percent. The
presidential aspirant who receives the highest approval rating
will be named as the party's presidential candidate May 30.
