Visiting Republic of China representative to the World Trade
Organization (WTO) Lin Yi-fu called Sunday for Taiwanese
entrepreneurs operating in the United States to help drum up U.S.
support for a free trade agreement (FTA) between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
Lin made the appeal while delivering a speech on the WTO current
situation and the ROC government's role in the Geneva-based world
trade regulatory body at a board meeting of the Taiwanese
Chambers of Commerce of North America.
</P>
<P>
Lin, who arrived in Dallas the day before to attend the meeting
being held March 16-18, said Taiwan is engaging in negotiations
with the United States about signing an FTA, adding that if
inked, the agreement will favor Taiwanese companies' business
expansion.
</P>
<P>
He voiced hope that all U.S.-based Taiwanese corporations will
join forces with the government in lobbying efforts so that a
free trade agreement between the two nations can be signed as
soon as possible to boost bilateral trade and economic relations.
