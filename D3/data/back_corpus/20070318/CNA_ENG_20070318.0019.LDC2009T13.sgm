Three women legislators of the ruling Democratic Progressive
Party (DPP) said Sunday that they will introduce an amendment to
the 1997 Sexual Assault Prevention Act to allow the caning of
serious sex offenders.
</P>
<P>
Hsueh Ling, Chang Ching-hui and Chen Shui-hui -- who are all DPP
legislators-at- large -- said they will try to persuade their DPP
colleagues and lawmakers of the opposition Kuomintang and People
First Party to support the proposed amendment.
</P>
<P>
Acknowledging that some people may see the caning of sex
offenders as an inhumane act, the DPP legislators said they are
willing to debate the issue with those who oppose such an
proposal.
</P>
<P>
Hsueh said that in addition to caning, she would also ask that
chemical castration be considered as a means of dealing with
serious sex offenders.

<P>
The three women lawmakers floated the proposals after police
arrested two criminals who abducted a medical student last week
from a motorbike parking lot near a mass rapid transit station in
Taipei and then drove to a riverside park where both raped her.

Lin Shih-chie, 38, was arrested Saturday while his accomplice
Hung Chie-hung, 30, was arrested the previous day. Police found
that while he was on the run, Lin also raped a female taxi driver
in her sixties.
