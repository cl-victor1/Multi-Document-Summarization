The new Keelung city council speaker was sworn in Friday soon
after winning a by-election by a razor-thin margin of 16-15 over
her rival.

Chang Fang-li beat former Keelung Council Vice Speaker Tseng
Shui-yuan to become the city council's first female speaker.

Following the victory, Chang immediately announced that she had
decided to give up her opposition Kuomintang (KMT) membership to
serve as a non-partisan speaker.

The by-election was held after former Speaker Chang Tong-rong won
the Keelung mayoral by-election last month.
