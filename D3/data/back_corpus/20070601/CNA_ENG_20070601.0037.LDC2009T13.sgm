Agricultural officials, rice farmers and traders held a ceremony
Friday in Pitou rural township in Changhua County, central
Taiwan, to kick off the year's first harvest Japanese "Dream
Beauty" rice.
</P>
<P>
In the ceremony, Changhua Magistrate Chuo Puo-yuan and other
local officials reaped rice from the middle of a paddy as part of
a symbolic harvest.
</P>
<P>
The county's director of agricultural affairs, Chiu Shi-ping,
said half of the total production from the 70-hectare contracted
rice fields growing "Dream Beauty" will be sold to Japan after a
series of strict pesticides tests.
</P>
<P>
The plantation is a cooperative program between a local rice
marketing company and a Japanese enterprise to grow the premium
strain of Japanese rice in Taiwan. Chiu explained that rice
production in Japan often fails to meet domestic demand because
there is only one harvest per year in that country.
</P>
<P>
Japanese businesses therefore seek other countries in which they
can grow their own rice, Chiu said, noting that the contract for
Pitou to grow "Dream Beauty" has provisions that the soil, water
and farmers' agricultural techniques are as good as those in
Japan.
</P>
<P>
While 250 tons, or 50 percent of the rice will be marketed in
Japan in the form of small packages, consumers in Taiwan are
expected to be able to purchase the rice by July in local
markets.
