Kaohsiung-based China Steel Corp. (CSC) signed a four-year
contract Friday with Samarco, a Brazilian mining company, under
the terms of which the Brazilian firm will sell CSC 1.9 million
tons of iron ore pellets from 2008 to 2011.
</P>
<P>
CSC officials said the contract will ensure 25 per cent of CSC's
annual iron ore pellet demand.
</P>
<P>
The two companies have maintained good commercial relations since
1998, when CSC first contracted Samarco to buy iron ore pellets,
according to CSC, a state- operated company that produces 11
million tons of raw steel per year.
</P>
<P>
Samarco is the world's second-largest iron ore pellet exporter,
selling the product to 15 countries around the world.
