DPP LAWMAKERS RESPOND WARMLY TO PROPOSED NO-CONFIDENCE VOTE

Taipei, June 1 (CNA) 06/01/07  18:00:32 (By Flor Wang)

<P>
A no-confidence vote called by Chen Chin-de, a ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) lawmaker, had gained positive responses
from his DPP peers as of Friday, with over half of the party's
lawmakers endorsing the proposal.
</P>
<P>
The no-confidence vote proposed earlier this week by Chen was
endorsed by 46 lawmakers, all of the DPP -- only 27 short of the
one-third legal threshold required to allow it to become a
motion. The DPP controls 84 seats in the Legislative Yuan.
</P>
<P>
Speaking in a news conference, Chen urged lawmakers of the main
opposition Kuomintang (KMT) and the People First Party (PFP) to
honor their previous pledges by joining the move to topple the
Cabinet led by Premier Chang Chun- hsiung so as to permit
President Chen Shui-bian to dissolve the parliament and elect new
legislators who could vote on several key bills stonewalled in
the legislature.
</P>
<P>
The long-term disorder in the "pan-blue alliance"-dominated
Legislative Yuan has seriously hobbled administrative operations
and now is the time to put an end to the farce, Chen said, adding
that he has strong confidence that his no- confidence proposal
will pass the legal threshold and be put on the legislative
agenda next Tuesday for a vote within five days.
</P>
<P>
Despite Chen's explanation as to why he wants the legislature
dissolved, PFP spokesman Lee Hung-chun questioned why the DPP
does not instead propose a motion to recall the president instead
of taking aim at the premier, as Chang was appointed by the
president.
