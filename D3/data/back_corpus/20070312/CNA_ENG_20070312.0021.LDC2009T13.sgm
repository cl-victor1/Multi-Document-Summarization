Taiwan consumers were urged Monday to be on alert against so-
called "health foods" that could actually be unhealthy or even
dangerous to the health.
</P>
<P>
At a news conference called at the Legislative Yuan by the non-
profit John Tung Foundation and ruling Democratic Progressive
Party Legislator Huang Shu-ying, Huang said that unscrupulous
traders, taking advantage of incomplete laws and insufficient
definitions and descriptions of health foods, have filled the
domestic markets with fake or substandard-quality foods that
claim to be health foods.
</P>
<P>
Huang said some bottled soft drinks are sold as being capable of
"curing influenza" simply because they contain Vitamin C. These
drinks, however, do not identify their caffeine or sugar content
on their labels.
</P>
<P>
Huang said she will make discussions on a law amendment and
revision to improve health food definition one of the core issues
of her interpellation efforts at the legislature during this
coming session.
</P>
<P>
Chu Nien-feng, director of the Outpatient Service for Obesity in
Tri-Service General Hospital, who also spoke at the news
conference, said that health foods that are natural with balanced
nutritional content will be of benefit only when consumed
properly.
</P>
<P>
Excessive intake of supposed health foods will not benefit the
health and could seriously jeopardize the health, particularly if
they are of substandard quality, Chu noted.
