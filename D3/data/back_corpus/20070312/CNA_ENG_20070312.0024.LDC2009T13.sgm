1,500 MAJOR LOAN DEFAULTERS TO BE NAMED: FINANCIAL REGULATOR

The Financial Supervisory Commission (FSC) will go ahead with its
plan to publish the names of major loan defaulters this week,
even though the Bank Act makes such a move illegal, FSC Chairman
Hu Sheng-cheng said Monday.
</P>
<P>
In a response to lawmakers' questions at the Legislative Yuan, Hu
said about 1,500 borrowers who have defaulted on repayment of
bank loans of more than NT$100 million (US$3.02 million) will
publicly named to serve the public interest.
</P>
<P>
The criteria will include borrowers who have run up bad loans at
different banks with a combined sum of more than NT$100 million
even their each individual loan may not exceed that amount.
</P>
<P>
Hu said the FSC has ordered local banks to make the disclosure
March 15 in an administrative decree, which can be challenged by
borrowers as it is against the law that obliges banks to protect
the privacy of their borrowers.
</P>
<P>
Although Hu said he will personally bear any responsibility for
the decision, he suggested an amendment to the law to make the
practice legitimate.
</P>
<P>
The FSC issued the order of disclosure at the request of the
Executive Yuan after China Rebar Co. and Chia Hsin Food and
Synthetic Fiber Co., two public listed companies owned by
business tycoon Wang You-theng, applied for bankruptcy protection
Dec. 29 last year, which caused a financial storm for the two
companies' many private shareholders.
