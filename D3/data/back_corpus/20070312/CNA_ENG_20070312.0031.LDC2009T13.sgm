The Department of Health (DOH) confirmed Monday the first
fatality from epidemic cerebrospinal meningitis in Taiwan this
year.

Shih Wen-yi, deputy director of the DOH Center for Disease
Control (CDC), said the victim was a 55-year-old man who fell ill
March 11 and died the following day.

Shih said the center has identified 62 people who had recent
contact with the deceased.

Apart from four family members of the man who have coughs and
fevers, and another one being treated for acute nasopharyngitis,
the others are all being given preventive medicine and asked to
conduct self health-management, Shih said.

"Things are under control, and there is no risk of the disease
being spread," said Shih.

Statistics released by the CDC show that there have been 11
suspected cases of epidemic cerebrospinal meningitis this year,
eight of which are confirmed cases and one fatality. This
compares with one confirmed case and one death in the same period
of last year.

The disease is often transmitted through contact with respiratory
