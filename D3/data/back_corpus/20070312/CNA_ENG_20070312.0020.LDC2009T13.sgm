Taipei,  March 12 (CNA) 03/12/07  17:54:59 (By Elizabeth Hsu)

President Chen Shui-bian announced Monday that the government has
decided to develop Taiwan's machine tool industry into a
"megasector" able to generate a production value of NT$1.1
trillion (US$33.27 billion) per year by 2009.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan also wishes to become one of the world's three largest
manufacturers and sources of advanced and high-precision machine
tools by that year, Chen said in an address to the opening
ceremony of the 2007 Taipei International Machine Tool Show
(TIMTOS) at the World Trade Center.
</P>
<P>
Chen revealed that the Executive Yuan has set a goal of
developing the machinery industry into a "trillion-dollar
industry" in its "Mega Investment, Mega Warmth" national economic
development stimulus project that Premier Su Tseng-chang
initiated last October to boost investment in Taiwan, create
employment,  narrow the urban-rural gap and narrow the wealth
gap.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan is currently the world's fourth-largest source of machine
tools, exporting products worth NT$96.3 billion in 2006 with an
annual growth of 11.5 percent, according to Chen.
</P>
<P>
The machine tool sector has earned a good reputation on the
international market, thanks to its longstanding efforts to
upgrade precision and control production costs, Chen said, noting
that the production of machine tools, parts and components is
expected to surge to NT$400 billion by 2010, according to a
prediction by the Industrial Development Bureau.
</P>
<P>
While  Taiwan  has successfully  built two "trillion-dollar
industries" --  the semiconductor  and the flat-screen monitor
manufacturing sectors -- in 2006, it is now time for the country
to find other rising stars to develop other "megaindustries, "
Chen said.
</P>
<P>
He also mentioned planned efforts to develop the exhibition,
convention and relevant services.
</P>
<P>
TIMTOS, held every two years, will run through March 17.
