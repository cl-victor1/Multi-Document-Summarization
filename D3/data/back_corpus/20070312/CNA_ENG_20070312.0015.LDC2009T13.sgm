Taipei,  March 12 (CNA) 03/12/07  16:27:31 (By Luis Huang)

Vice President Annette Lu and Premier Su Tseng-chang called
Monday for unity and harmony among the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party's (DPP's) presidential hopefuls in the process
of selecting the party's candidate for the 2008 presidential
election.
</P>
<P>
Lu and Su, who are DPP presidential primary contenders, made the
remarks after taking part in a tree-planting activity to
celebrate Arbor Day. In addition to Lu and Su, DPP Chairman Yu
Shyi-kun and former Premier Frank Hsieh have also thrown their
hats into the ring.
</P>
<P>
Claiming that DPP members have "always been united," Lu said that
harmony and unity will boost the party's chances of winning the
presidential election.
</P>
<P>
As for a media report that Yu sees no need for President Chen
Shui-bian to mediate in the party's selection of a presidential
candidate due to differences in basic policy lines of the four
presidential primary contenders, Lu said that since the DPP is
the most democratic, progressive party, every party member is
entitled to express his viewpoints.
</P>
<P>
After the March 9 deadline for the registration of candidacies
for the primary, Chen invited the four presidential aspirants to
his official residence to gain a better understanding of their
views on how best the party can nominate its candidate to win the
presidential race. They failed to reach a consensus on the issue.
</P>
<P>
Lu said the four aspirants exchanged their views in a very good
atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
Echoing the vice president's remarks, Su said the president had
clearly outlined the party's basic policy line. The premier also
voiced the hope that a second meeting of the four presidential
hopefuls slated for Tuesday will pay off.
</P>
<P>
If the party's presidential ticket cannot be selected through the
"mediation or negotiation" approach, a primary will be held to
settle the issue. Under a DPP timetable for the presidential
primary, party members will vote on presidential and legislative
hopefuls May 6, to be followed by a series of public opinion
polls.
</P>
<P>
The votes of party members will account for 30 percent of a
would-be candidate's score, while public opinion poll results
will account for 70 percent. The presidential aspirant who
receives the highest approval rating will be named the party's
presidential candidate May 30.
