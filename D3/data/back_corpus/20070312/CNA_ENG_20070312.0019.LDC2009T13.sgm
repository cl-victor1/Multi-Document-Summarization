HARD WORK NEEDED TO REACH US$20,000 PER CAPITA INCOME: CEPD
</HEADLINE>

The government will have to work very hard if it wants to achieve
the goal of per capita income of US$20,000 in 2009, the nation's
top economic planner said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Ho Mei-yueh, chairwoman of the Council for Economic Planning and
Development (CEPD), made the remarks while fielding questions at
a legislative committee meeting.
</P>
<P>
Legislator Lee Jih-chu of the opposition Kuomintang questioned if
Premier Su Tseng-chang's goal is realistic and demanded that the
CEPD re-examine the objective, part of Su's "Mega investment,
Mega warmth" economic stimulus project.
</P>
<P>
According to Lee, the goal will be "very difficult" to achieve,
saying that economic growth would have to be as high as 11.6
percent in 2008 and 2009, and that the growth of the service
sector would have to reach 7 percent to make it possible. She
claimed that economic growth in recent years has registered only
3 percent.
</P>
<P>
She said the government  has often touted the decline in
unemployment but she pointed out that while the jobless rate has
declined, average salaries have not climbed, showing that the low
jobless rate is mainly because of the government's "employment
boost" program,  which provides  a great number  of short-term
work opportunities to the jobless.
</P>
<P>
She said this means that the number of low-wage jobs has
increased but average salaries have actually fallen, which she
said is not good for the nation's economy.
</P>
<P>
Ho said that Taiwan's "substantial" salary growth registered at
0.7 percent in 2006, the same as Japan. "Substantial" wage
increases in the last five years averaged 1.1 percent, which was
also identical to the figure for Japan and Hong Kong. The decline
of the jobless rate is helpful to economic growth, she added.
</P>
<P>
However, asked whether it is possible to reach the goal of
US$20,000, Ho only said that "we have to work very hard to
achieve the goal."
