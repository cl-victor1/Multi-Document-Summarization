Taipei, March  12 (CNA) 03/12/07  18:54:24 (By Han Nai-kuo)

The nation's top police officer told a Legislative Yuan committee
Monday that police will make all-out efforts to catch two
criminals who raped a medical school co-ed early Sunday after
abducting her near a Taipei mass rapid transit (MRT) station.
</P>
<P>
Answering questions from members of the legislature's Home and
Nations Committee, National Police Agency Director-General Hou
You-yi said a task force formed to investigate the case had
already obtained samples of the semen left by the two rapists and
will do everything possible to bring them to justice.
</P>
<P>
According to a report in Monday's Apple Daily, the victim was
walking in the rain from the Shihlin Night Market toward a
motorbike parking lot opposite the No. 2 exit of the MRT's
Chientan Station shortly after midnight Sunday when a man forced
her into a car. Another man then drove the car to the Tachia
Riverside Park beside the Keelung River.
</P>
<P>
Both men raped her in the park and then drove off, leaving behind
the young woman, naked and helpless in the dark.
</P>
<P>
A couple driving through the park discovered the victim and
offered a helping hand, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
The Apple Daily claimed there are "at least six" rapists lurking
in the greater Taipei area who might sexually assault women at
any time.
</P>
<P>
However, Hou told the lawmakers that some of these repeat
offenders have already been caught.
</P>
<P>
Quoting statistics compiled by the National Police Agency, Hou
said violent crime in Taiwan dropped 15 percent last year
compared with the previous year and that the police were able to
crack 90 percent of the major criminal cases.
</P>
<P>
He added that statistics aside, police are attentive to the
public's feelings about serious crime and will do their best to
provide them with a safe living environment.
