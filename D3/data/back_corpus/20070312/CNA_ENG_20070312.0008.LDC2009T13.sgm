Taipei, March 12 (CNA) 03/12/07  15:02:31 (By Deborah Kuo)

<P>
President Chen Shui-bian planted a sapling of endemic Formosan
nato tree on the campus of the Taipei National University of the
Arts Monday to celebrate Arbor Day.
</P>
<P>
Chen was flanked by Vice President Annette Lu, Premier Su Tseng-
chang  and several other government officials during the planting
ceremony.
</P>
<P>
He urged the public to be supporters of the "cherish the forests"
drive that has been launched by the Council of Agriculture to
observe "Arbor Month."
</P>
<P>
He also exhorted the public to become "tree huggers" so that
Taiwan can be developed into a "green silicon island" where the
environment preserved as the high-technology industry is
fostered.
</P>
<P>
Citing the messages that put forward in the motion picture "Day
After Tomorrow" as well as Al Gore's Oscar-winning documentary
"An Inconvenient Truth, " Chen urged the Taiwan public to make
efforts before it's too late to help form the basis for
ecologically sustainable development in Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Chen said that although Taiwan is not a signatory to the
U.N.-initiated Kyoto Protocol -- an agreement aimed at reducing
global carbon dioxide emissions -- the Executive Yuan passed a
draft bill last September to push for the reduction of greenhouse
gas emissions in Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
In addition to efforts to reduce carbon dioxide emissions, Chen
said, planting trees and nurturing forests are also good ways to
conserve the environment.
</P>
<P>
The Republic of China government designated the anniversary of
ROC founding father Dr. Sun Yat-sen's passing as Arbor Day four
years after his death in 1925. Today, trees are planted each
March 12 in remembrance  of Sun's encouragement  of afforestation
and his contributions to the nation.
</P>
<P>
In 2003, the Cabinet designated the Feb. 4-March 12 period as
"Arbor Month" for the first time.
</P>
<P>
Similar tree-planting events were held in other cities and
counties around the country Monday.
