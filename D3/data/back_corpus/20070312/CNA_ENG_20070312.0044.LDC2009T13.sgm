Taipei, March 12 (CNA) 03/12/07  21:58:22 (By T.C. Jiang)

Hong Kong branches of local banks reported significant profits
last year,  with the annual increase rate surpassing 30 percent,
bank sources said Monday.
</P>
<P>
That growth can be attributed to the fact that these H.K.
branches have many clients who are Taiwanese businessmen with
operations in China, the sources noted.
</P>
<P>
Last year, Bank SinoPac reported US$60 million (NT$1.92 billion)
in overseas profits, which made up nearly 70 percent of the banks
total earnings, the banks CEO Paul Lo said.
</P>
<P>
Of total overseas' profits, the bank's branch in H.K. contributed
US$45 million, up 30 percent on a year-on-year basis, Lo
stressed.
</P>
<P>
Bank SinoPac is the only bank in Taiwan that has opened two
branches in H.K. and another two in Macao, Lo boasted.
</P>
<P>
Lo expected the overseas profits this year will continue to grow
by at least 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
Fubon Financial Holding Co.s H.K. branch posted an annual
increase rate of 35.5 percent to reach HK$327 million in 2006,
which accounted for 11.4 percent of the banks total earnings,
President Victor Kung said.
</P>
<P>
Kung pointed out that as of the end of last year, the branch
managed the wealth of 3,600 clients who are Taiwanese businessmen
operating in China with the total assets recording HK$4.2
billion.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the private banks, the H.K. branches of the state-
backed banks reported big gains as well, the bank resources said,
giving the example of Hua Nan Commercial Banks H.K. branch which
generated NT$1 billion last year.
</P>
<P>
Bank sources explained that price competition in Taiwan has
shrunk local banksprofits. As a result, the banks began to turn
to the overseas markets as the lending loan rates are higher,
they said.
