Taichung Mayor Jason Hu plans to fly to Japan March 23 for a
five-day visit aimed at inviting Sadaharu Oh, a Japan-based
baseball guru of Chinese descent, to serve as the spokesman for
the upcoming 2007 Baseball World Cup games, city officials
revealed Monday.
</P>
<P>
The World Cup, held every two years, is scheduled to open in
November at the new Taichung Intercontinental Baseball Stadium,
which was inaugurated last November.
</P>
<P>
Hu is expected to have a busy trip in Japan where he is scheduled
to call at two Japanese famous baseball stadiums -- the Fukuoka
Dome and the Tokyo Dome -- to inspect the physical and managerial
infrastructure associated with their baseball facilities,
according to the city government.
</P>
<P>
The mayor will also tour Roppongi and Omotessando, two exclusive
commercial and fashion districts in Tokyo that draw tourists from
around the world. Hu has expressed hope that the planned city
tour will inspire him to develop good ideas to apply in his
efforts to modernize the central Taiwan city and introduce it to
the world.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Hu said he will advertise the new Taichung baseball
stadium during his stay in Japan in hope that Japanese
professional baseball teams will conduct their spring training at
the field.
</P>
<P>
He hopes the new facility, which will also serve as the venue for
the 2007 Asian Baseball Championship to be opened on Nov. 26,
will be used to its full advantage, Hu said.
