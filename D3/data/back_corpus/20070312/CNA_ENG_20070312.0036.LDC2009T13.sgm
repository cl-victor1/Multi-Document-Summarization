'FOUR WANTS' NOT DECLARATION OF TAIWAN INDEPENDENCE: FOREIGN
MINISTER
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

Taipei, March 12 (CNA) 03/12/07  20:33:07 (By Luis Huang)

<P>
The "four wants and one without" statement delivered by President
Chen Shui-bian recently is by no means a declaration of Taiwan
independence, Ministry of Foreign Affairs James Huang reiterated
Monday at a session of the Legislative Yuan's Foreign Affairs
Committee.
</P>
<P>
While posing their questions during the session, several
lawmakers referred to Chen's recent declaration that Taiwan wants
independence, rectification of its official name, a new
constitution and further development, but Taiwan is not, and will
not be polarized into left or right wing factions.
</P>
<P>
In response, Huang explained that when the president said "Taiwan
wants independence, " it is a reflection that " China has spared
no efforts to debase the Taiwanese government and to infringe on
Taiwan's sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
Huang said the president's remarks are not aimed at declaring
Taiwan independence or building a "Republic of Taiwan" and that
Taiwan's official title remains the Republic of China.
</P>
<P>
Quoting a recent explanation by the Presidential Official of
Chen's "four wants and one without" doctrine, the minister said
that the doctrine is unrelated to the "four noes plus one"
commitment made by the president in his 2000 and 2004 inaugural
speeches.
</P>
<P>
In his inaugural address, Chen pledged that so long as China has
no intention to use force against Taiwan, during his term in
office he would not declare independence, not change the national
title, not push for the inclusion of the so-called "state-to-
state" description in the Constitution, nor promote a referendum
to change the status quo with regards to the question of
independence or unification; furthermore, he said, the abolition
of the National Unification Council (NUC) or the National
Unification Guidelines would not be an issue.
