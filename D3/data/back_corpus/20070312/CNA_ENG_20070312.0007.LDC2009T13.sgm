'PARTICIPATION EXPLOSION' TO HIGHLIGHT DPP LEGISLATIVE PRIMARY
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taipei,  March  12 (CNA) 03/12/07  13:41:48 (By Sofia Wu)
</P>
<P>
Candidacy registration for the ruling Democratic Progressive
Party's (DPP's) legislative primary kicked off Monday, with many
single-seat regional constituencies seeing red-hot competition.
</P>
<P>
The "participation explosion" will be even greater in the
national constituency, or legislators-at-large nomination race,
party sources said.
</P>
<P>
So far, several prominent DPP politicians, including outspoken
former Legislator Shen Fu-hsiung and Mainland Affairs Council
Vice Chairman You Ying-lung, have announced their bids for
nomination by the DPP for at-large legislative seats.
</P>
<P>
You, also secretary-general of the Straits Exchange Foundation --
a quasi- official intermediary body authorized to handle
exchanges with China in the absence of official  ties --  is the
DPP administration's first political appointee to throw his hat
into the ring for the year-end legislative elections.
</P>
<P>
You, who twice lost bids for the magistrateship of the eastern
county of Hualien, said Sunday he will register for the DPP
primary for at-large legislative seats Wednesday, on the second
anniversary of China's enactment of the so-called Anti-Secession
Law against Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Luo Wen-jia, a former DPP legislator who lost the election for
Taipei County magistrate in 2005, also announced his bid for
nomination for an at-large legislative seat Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Luo, who used to be one of President Chen Shui-bian's most
trusted aides and the youngest Cabinet member as head of the
Hakka Affairs Council, said he understands he will face an uphill
battle in seeking the party's nomination given the sad fact that
some party heavyweights and rank-and-file  members have
misunderstood  his political convictions.
</P>
<P>
Luo drew the ire of some of President Chen's staunch supporters
last autumn when some of his remarks were interpreted as echoing
former DPP Chairman Shih Ming- teh-led "red-clad" protesters'
calls for Chen to step down over alleged misuse of the special
"state affairs fund" budgeted for the president's discretionary
use.
</P>
<P>
Luo faces another disadvantage as the DPP Central Standing
Committee has passed a resolution to use an "exclusionary"
polling system in which only loyalists or core supporters of the
DPP-led pro-independence "pan-green camp" will be polled for the
party's primary for legislator-at-large candidates.
</P>
<P>
Under the "exclusionary" polling system,  swing voters and
moderate  supporters of  the  main  opposition  Kuomintang-led
pro-unification "pan-blue alliance" will be excluded from the
opinion polls in selecting the DPP's at-large legislative
candidates.
</P>
<P>
Undaunted by these unfavorable factors, Luo said he will take
advantage of the primary race to expound his political
convictions and his visions for party and legislative reform as
well as the country's future development course to win back the
hearts and souls of his former supporters. Luo was the top vote-
getter in Taipei City's north constituency in the 2002
legislative elections.
</P>
<P>
According  to the DPP's  primary  mechanism,  the  party's
presidential and legislative candidates are selected based on the
results of a party member vote, which accounts for 30 percent of
their score, and in a series of public opinion polls, which
accounts for 70 percent.
</P>
<P>
A "single-member constituency, two votes" electoral system will
be adopted for the year-end legislative elections for the first
time. Under the system, the number of seats will be nearly halved
to 113 from the current 225.
</P>
<P>
Out of the 113 seats, 73 will be filled via direct elections in
single-seat constituencies, with each city and county electing at
least one legislator. Three seats will be filled by legislators
representing "Plains Aborigines, " and three will be filled by
representatives of "mountain Aborigines."
</P>
<P>
The remaining 34 seats will be filled by legislators-at-large and
legislators representing overseas expatriate communities. The
seats will be allotted to the various parties based on the
proportion of total "party" votes they obtain in the elections.
Only those parties that win at least 5 percent of the total vote
will be given at-large and expatriate seats, and at least 50
percent of these seats will be reserved for women.
</P>
<P>
Senior DPP officials said "party identification" is particularly
important in selecting candidates for legislators-at-large seats
because the seats will be filled based on the proportion of votes
each party gets under the new "two votes" electoral system.
</P>
<P>
The officials further said the DPP's decision-making Central
Standing Committee has not yet come to a decision on whether the
"exclusionary" polling system will apply to candidates running
for nomination for regional seats or for the presidential
election.
</P>
<P>
On regional seats race front, former Government Information
Office Minister Pasuya Yao announced Sunday that he will run in
the party primary in the fourth constituency of southern
Kaohsiung City.
</P>
<P>
Touting his reform-mindedness, Yao said the DPP needs someone
like him to run in that constituency where "pan-blue" supporters
slightly outnumber "pan-green" followers as shown in last
December's mayoral election. Yao said he is determined to use new
thinking and new strategies to expand the DPP's support base by
presenting innovative policy initiatives.
</P>
<P>
According to party sources, several constituencies will see three
incumbent DPP lawmakers compete for the party's nomination for a
single legislative seat up for grabs, including Taipei City's
second constituency and Taoyuan County's second electoral
district.
</P>
<P>
Many other districts will have two incumbent DPP legislators vie
for nomination for a single seat, including Tainan County's first
and second constituencies as well as some districts in Taipei
County, Taichung County, Changhua County and Nantou County.
