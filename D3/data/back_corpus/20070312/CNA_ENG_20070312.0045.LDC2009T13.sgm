Law enforcement agents seized 2,900 boxes of untaxed cigarettes,
worth approximately NT$10 million -- apparently smuggled from
abroad -- in a warehouse in Kaohsiung County, the Coast Guard
Administration (CGA) announced Monday.

A CGA spokesman said that a CGA mobile unit in southern Taiwan
had kept a smuggling ring's operations under surveillance for
some time and requested the formation of a task force consisting
of CGA officers, customs officials and officers from the
Kaohsiung County's police office in Fengshan.

The task force obtained a search warrant from the Kaohsiung
District Court Sunday and raided the warehouse in Chishan
township, where the agents found 2,900 boxes of the Japanese
Seven Stars brand cigarettes, with a market value of nearly NT$10
million.

According to the spokesman, the task force is still trying to
find a man nicknamed "Ah Hung, " who is believed to be the
mastermind behind the smuggling operation.
