The Republic of China government has donated US$200,000 to the
Solomon Islands as part of its humanitarian relief efforts to aid
its South Pacific ally's earthquake victims, Ministry of Foreign
Affairs (MOFA) spokesman Wang Chien-yeh said Tuesday.

The donation came after a tsunami spawned by a 8.0-magnitude
undersea earthquake hit the western Solomon Islands Monday,
leaving at least 15 people dead.

Taiwan's ambassador to the Solomon Islands has visited the
country's prime minister office and expressed condolences on
behalf of President Chen Shui-bian, Premier Su Tseng-chang, and
Minister of Foreign Affairs James Huang, the spokesman noted.

The MOFA also urged prospective Taiwanese visitors to the Solomon
Islands to avoid traveling in the disaster areas, remain alert,
and to be aware of locally issued earthquake or tsunami warnings,
the spokesman pointed out.
