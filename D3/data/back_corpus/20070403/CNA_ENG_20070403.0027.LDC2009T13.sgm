The state-owned CPC Corp, Taiwan and Libyan National Oil Corp.
(NOC) has signed an exploration and production sharing agreement
to tap an oil field in the North African nation, CPC officials
announced Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Officials said that CPC Chairman Pan Wen-yen signed the agreement
in Libya Monday, which they said will help the company's bid to
set up a bridgehead for oil exploration in North Africa.
</P>
<P>
The officials noted that Libya is a major oil-producing country
in North Africa and the CPC in recent years has been actively
soliciting chances to explore the Libyan oil fields. It won the
bid to explore Murzug 162 in southern Libya last December.
</P>
<P>
Officials noted that the CPC is planning to invest US$34 million
over the next three years to drill three exploratory wells and
conduct explorations. If this proves successful, it is estimated
that the oil reserves could yield 500 million oil barrels.
</P>
<P>
According to the agreement, the first-stage will require five
years for exploration and if no oil is found during that period,
then the CPC will have to forfeit exploration right of the oil
field, but if oil is found, then the development and production
period will continue 25 years.
