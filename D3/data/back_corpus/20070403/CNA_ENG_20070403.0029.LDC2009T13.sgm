The Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) has vowed to help the
local automobile industry integrate information technology to
boost the industry's added value and expand its global market
share.
</P>
<P>
Economic Affairs Minister Steve R.L. Chen made the pledge at the
opening ceremony Monday for the 2007 International Auto Parts
&amp; Accessories Show (TAIPEI AMPA) and the 2007 Taipei
International Automobile Electronics Show (AutoTronics Taipei
2007) at the Taipei International Convention Center.
</P>
<P>
A total of 2,301 booths have been set up at the two shows, which
have drawn 995 companies from 15 countries to participate and
will run until April 5.
</P>
<P>
The auto parts industry plays an important role in Taiwan's
economy, with the sector's exports totalling US$4.15 billion for
2006, up 3.8 percent over the previous year, Chen said.
</P>
<P>
Chen noted that according to data compiled by IC Insight, a
U.S.-based market research organization,  automobile electronics
accounts for 20 percent of production costs in the automotive
industry, with the figure expected to rise to 40 percent by 2010
and 50 percent in 2015, adding that by that time, global
production of automobile electronics is forecast to reach US$400
billion.
</P>
<P>
The Industrial Development Bureau under the MOEA is working on
improving the auto parts industry's research and development,
while the Small and Medium Enterprise Administration is working
on an assistance project concerning automobile electronics
technology, and the Bureau of Foreign Trade is helping auto parts
companies expand their market share, Chen added.
