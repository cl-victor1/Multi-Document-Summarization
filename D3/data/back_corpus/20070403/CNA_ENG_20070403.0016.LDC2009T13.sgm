AFTER-SCHOOL CARE EXPECTED TO BE EXTENDED IN TAIPEI

Taipei,  April 3 (CNA) 04/03/07  16:48:32 (By Elizabeth Hsu)

<P>
Elementary schools in Taipei City will be permitted to extend
their after-school care for one hour to 7:00 p.m. under a new
measure that is expected to be implemented soon, the city
director of education said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
However, Wu Ching-ji added that while the city government
supports the idea to prolong the current child care courses at
public elementary schools for the need of working parents who are
unable to look after their children after the school day ends, it
will respect each school administrations' decision on whether to
extend their after-school care.
</P>
<P>
The department is informing all concerned schools around the city
of the new measure, Wu added.
</P>
<P>
Wu made the announcement at a press conference held by the
Federation of Parents Associations in Taipei City at the city
hall. The group suggested that as the number of double-income
families and single-parent families has been on a rise in the
city, the municipal government should work to create a safe
environment for children from such families to wait for their
parents to get off work.
</P>
<P>
Many working parents are forced to send their children to private
after-school classes or cram schools to provide them with
supervision until the work day ends, according to the federation.
