Old NT$500 and old NT$1,000 banknotes lacking aholographic foil
membrane will be pulled from circulation Aug. 1, a spokesman of
the Central Bank said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman reminded people to exchange old NT$500 and old
NT$1,000 banknotes for new ones at financial institutes before
July 31. After that date, the Bank of Taiwan will be the only
financial institute where people will be able to exchange old
notes.
</P>
<P>
Most NT$500 and NT$1,000 bills that people have now are of the
new variety, the spokesman said, adding that the new bills were
printed with dark brown as the dominant color, while one
thousand-dollar notes remained blue, albeit with additional
counterfeit detection measures.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said there is a holographic foil membrane on right
side of the new note's front side, while the original color-
changing security thread has been replaced with a wider security
holographic thread on the back, right of the note.
</P>
<P>
Additionally, the Arabic numerals on the back of the new notes
are printed with light changing oil-based ink that changes from
gold to green, the spokesman added.
