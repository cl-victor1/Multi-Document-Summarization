The Cabinet-level Council of Agriculture (COA) said Tuesday it
will expand its "Gardener Program" this year to attract more
young people to pursue careers in the agricultural sector.

The "Gardener Program, " which was launched last August for the
firms time, is designed with the aim of encouraging people --
especially those aged between 35 and 55 -- to enter the
agricultural sector in an attempt to inject new blood into the
ageing rural population, COA officials said.

<P>
Encouraged by public warm response to the project last year, the
officials said, more training classes will be opened this time
around.
</P>
<P>
This year, the council will open additional classes on the
country's agricultural policies, agriculture-related industries,
crop planting know-houw and developmental potential, the
officials said, adding that during the classes, outstanding
farmers will be invited to share their experience in growing
crops with trainees.

People interested in taking part in the program can visit the
council's Web site at agredu.coa.gov.tw to obtain registration
forms, the officials said.
