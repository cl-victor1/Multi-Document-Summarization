The Taipei-based Taiwan Association of University Professors
(TAUP) urged Tuesday the ruling Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) to produce its candidate for the presidency in a democratic
way and refrain from "designating a successor" to President Chen
Shui-bian.
</P>
<P>
TAUP Chairman Tsai Ting-kuei made a call at the TAUP-held press
conference while expressing the association's concern over the
outcome of the 2008 presidential election, which Tsai said will
decide Taiwan's future development.
</P>
<P>
Four aspirants are vying for the DPP candidacy for the next
presidency: Vice President Annette Lu, Premier Su Tseng-chang,
DPP Chairman Yu Shyi-kun, and former Premier Frank Hsieh.
</P>
<P>
Tsai expressed hope that President Chen would not designate a
successor, and suggested the DPP redesign its primary system. He
suggested that the party put forward a policy issue for national
debate and push for a referendum on such policy issue whenever it
is seeking a candidate for a major election.
</P>
<P>
Tsai further suggested that the DPP invite those who endorse its
referendum proposals to join the party primary vote.
</P>
<P>
Tsai said he believes that this candidate selection approach can
also help the DPP realize its goal of holding referendum on
certain critical issues, such as forcing the main opposition
Kuomintang to return its ill-gotten assets to national coffers.
