TAIPEI CITY GOVERNMENT REMOVES BANNERS AT MEMORIAL HALL
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  May 22 (CNA) 05/22/07  15:20:10 (By Elizabeth Hsu)

The Taipei City government acted Tuesday to remove two gigantic
banners hanging on the outer walls of the "Chiang Kai-shek
Memorial Hall" on the grounds that the installation violates the
law concerning protection of the country's cultural assets.
</P>
<P>
Taipei City Director of Cultural Affairs Lee Yung-ping and City
Law and Regulation Commission Director Yeh Ching-yuan, heading a
team of workers, guided the work of pulling down the banners and
dismantling scaffolding erected in front of the memorial's main
gate.
</P>
<P>
During the process, they did not face any attempts to obstruct
their work, Lee said, noting that the city government decided to
act because the hall's administration, which is under the
jurisdiction of the Ministry of Education (MOE) , appeared to be
ignoring the city government's ruling.
</P>
<P>
The administration of the memorial, which was renamed the
"National Taiwan Democracy Memorial Hall" Saturday, did not take
any steps to follow the city government's demand to remove the
gigantic objects blocking the "heritage site" from view after it
was fined twice over the past two days for violating provisions
of the Cultural Assets Preservation Law.
</P>
<P>
The MOE is obliged to follow regulations of the local government
in terms of changes to a heritage site or practices that block
visitors from seeing or entering a historic monument, according
to the city government.
</P>
<P>
Since the Executive Yuan approved the name change proposal
presented by the MOE in mid-April, the memorial redesignation
plan has been the focal point of disputes between the ministry,
which oversees  the  memorial  management,  and the  opposition
Kuomintang-controlled Taipei City government.
</P>
<P>
At one point, Taipei Mayor Hau Lung-bin threatened to have police
arrest anyone who dared to remove the memorial's name plate or
put up a new one at the hall. But the two sides finally reached a
compromise on the eve of the plaque- unveiling ceremony for the
renamed hall, with the MOE assuring city officials that no damage
would be done to the memorial hall.
</P>
<P>
However, the dispute was pushed to a climax Saturday when the
plaque-unveiling ceremony took place. The city government was
furious at being "cheated" as the memorial hall administration
covered the name plate of the hall with a canvas, hung banners
and erected scaffolding in what the municipal government called
an attempt to block from view the magnificent building dedicated
to the late President Chiang Kai-shek. During the ceremony,
President Chen Shui-bian called Chiang a "dictator" and
"executioner." The main gate was also closed for what the hall
administration called repair work.
</P>
<P>
As no workers have been seen carrying out the so-called repair
work, City Deputy Director of Cultural Affairs Lee Ping said the
city government is working on what steps to take to re-open the
gate.
