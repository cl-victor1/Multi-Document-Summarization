OLYMPIC TORCH ISSUE PUT ON LEGISLATIVE SESSION AGENDA
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taipei, May 22 (CNA) 05/22/07  18:23:36 (By Deborah Kuo)
</P>
<P>
A proposal to launch a nationwide referendum on whether and how
Taiwan should allow the 2008 Olympic Games torch relay to come to
Taiwan has been put on the agenda of a legislative session slated
for May 25, a Legislative Yuan source said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The proposal, submitted by opposition Kuomintang Legislator Huang
Chih-hsiung, was passed by the Legislative Yuan Committee of
Procedure to be put on the agenda for discussion in the May 25
session, according to a committee member.
</P>
<P>
Huang is a taekwondo fighter-turned-lawmaker who was a silver
medalist in the 2004 Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
President Chen Shui-bian said the day before that Taiwan hopes
the torch relay can come to the country, but not if it were to
mean Taiwan having its sovereignty compromised.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan has rejected China's offer of including Taipei as a leg on
China's "domestic" route after Beijing suggested recently that
the torch enter Taiwan from Vietnam and exit from Taiwan to Hong
Kong.
</P>
<P>
Chen said the Chinese Taipei Olympic Committee is willing to
continue negotiating with Beijing and the International Olympic
Committee over the issue.
</P>
<P>
Also Tuesday, another proposal to select a Taiwan "national bird,
" submitted by the legislative caucus of the Non-Partisan
Solidarity Union (NPSU), was put on the May 25 agenda, the
committee member said.
</P>
<P>
The NPSU legislative caucus launched a national bird selection
campaign early this year and the Formosan blue magpie and mikado
pheasant were voted as the top two national bird candidates.
</P>
<P>
Although the two proposals were put on the May 25 legislative
agenda, the chances of them actually being debated during the
session are slim, as they are filed as the 85th and 86th bills to
be discussed on the day, the committee member said.
