The Penghu islands off Taiwan's southwestern coast have been hit
by a serious dry spell, prompting water resources authorities to
implement contingency measures to tackle the issue, officials of
the Taiwan Water Company said Tuesday.

According to the water company officials, water supplies for the
Penghu area might become acute in mid-July and water rationing is
being considered from the end of May if rain does not fall during
the current rainy season, which usually starts in May and runs
through September.

Meanwhile, Penghu's three reservoirs have a total of 360,000 tons
of water, which is estimated to last until the middle of July if
each provides 6,000 tons per day, water company officials said,
pointing out that the amount of underground water is also
dwindling due to the paucity of rainfall in recent months.

In addition to the rationing, the officials said, water might
have to be transported from Taiwan proper to Penghu if conditions
do not improve in the coming days. All water supply contingency
measures must first be submitted for approval by the Ministry of
Economic Affairs, he added.
