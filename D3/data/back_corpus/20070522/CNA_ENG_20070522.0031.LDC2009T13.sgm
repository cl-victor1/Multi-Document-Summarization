</HEADLINE>

Taipei, May 22 (CNA) 05/22/07  20:00:59 (By Lilian Wu)

The delivery of all 126 train carriages purchased by the
Kaohsiung Rapid Transit Corp. (KRTC) for the southern port city's
mass rapid transit system was completed Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
KRTC Chairman Chiang Yao-tsung reaffirmed during a delivery
ceremony for the last batch of six carriages his determination to
get the two lines of the MRT system operational as soon as
possible.
</P>
<P>
The ceremony was held at the South Depot of the MRT system with
officials from the KRTC, train carriage contractor Siemens AG,
shipping contractor Fracht FWO AG and other relevant companies
attending.
</P>
<P>
Chiang expressed his appreciation for all the parties involved
for completing the task, noting that the company took the first
delivery in October 2005 and has since received six carriages
every three or four weeks.
</P>
<P>
Each train consists of three carriages with a total of 126 seats
and standing room for another 250 passengers. Each carriage costs
about NT$55 million (NT$1.66 million).
</P>
<P>
The Red Line of Kaohsiung MRT system is scheduled to become
operational at the end of this year, while the Orange Line will
be operational at the end of 2008.
</P>
<P>
Construction of Kaohsiung's MRT system began in October 2001, but
the project, which was based on a build-operate-transfer model,
has encountered major construction accidents and scandals. In
August 2004, a large section of subway tunnel on the Orange Line
collapsed, while in December 2005, another section of the same
line collapsed.
</P>
<P>
A corruption scandal involving a former top aide of President
Chen Shui-bian was brought to light after Thai migrant workers
hired by the KRTC to work on the MRT system rioted in August 2005
to protest their inhumane treatment.
