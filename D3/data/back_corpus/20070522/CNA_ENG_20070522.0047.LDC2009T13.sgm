Taipei,  May 22 (CNA) 05/22/07  23:49:26 (By Sofia Wu)

The ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) and the main
opposition Kuomintang (KMT) should be blamed for causing social
confrontation through politically charged name changes of the
capital city's defining landmarks, a Taiwan Solidarity Union
(TSU) spokesman said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
TSU Secretary-General Chien Cheng-shan said the TSU, which
controls 12 seats in the legislature,  said the DPP-initiated
installation and the KMT-led removal of giant curtains on the
facade of the "Chiang Kai-shek Memorial Hall" which was renamed
the "National Taiwan Democracy Memorial Hall" last Saturday was a
ridiculous farce that wasted taxpayer's money.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the TSU does not oppose the redesignation of the
magnificent monument in downtown Taipei. Chien said it should
have been conducted in accordance with the law.
</P>
<P>
As to the KMT-led Taipei city government's renaming the large
plaza in front of the Presidential Office as "anti-corruption
democracy  square"  to  commemorate weeks  of  opposition-led
demonstrations against President Chen Shui-bian last year over
his alleged misuse of a "special affairs fund," Chien said it's a
case of the pot calling the kettle black.
</P>
<P>
Claiming that all ordinary citizens have fallen victim to the
continued KMT-DPP partisan dogfight, Chien said voters should use
their ballots to punish the two parties in the year-end
legislative elections.
