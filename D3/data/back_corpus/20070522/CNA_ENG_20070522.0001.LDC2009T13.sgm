FOREIGN MINISTER HEADS FOR CENTRAL AMERICA TO SHORE UP TIES
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  May 22 (CNA) 05/22/07  06:05:44 (By Sofia Wu)

<P>
Minister of Foreign Affairs James Huang headed for Belize late
Monday to attend a ministerial-level meeting with his
counterparts from Central American countries that maintain
diplomatic relations with the Republic of China on Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
The meeting is a regular  annual event which takes place
alternately in Taiwan and one of its allies in the region.
</P>
<P>
But this year's meeting is drawing more attention as it is
overshadowed  by another  setback  for Taipei in its bid for
participation in the World Health Organization (WHO).
</P>
<P>
In a May 14 vote at the WHO headquarters in Geneva, two of its
Central American allies -- Panama and Nicaragua -- were absent
during the voting and another -- Costa Rica -- unexpectedly voted
against the bid.
</P>
<P>
Huang said the diplomatic situation in Central America is indeed
worthy of attention, but is by no means bleak. Generally
speaking, he said, relations with allies in the region remain
firm and stable.
</P>
<P>
During his trip to Belize, Huang said he will also preside over a
working meeting of Taiwan's diplomatic mission chiefs in the
region to discuss viable strategies to retain its diplomatic
allies in the face of China's growing economic and political
clout in the world community.
</P>
<P>
"We'll have a brainstorming session to work out strategies to
counter China's efforts to cut the ground from under our feet,"
Huang said, adding that Taiwan will use its edge in information
technology (IT) industry to assist its Central American allies in
IT education and narrowing digital divide as well as help with
their solar energy technological development.
</P>
<P>
According to Huang, the Costa Rican and Panamanian foreign
minister will not attend the ROC-Central American foreign
ministers meeting in person because of their busy schedule and
will instead be represented by their deputies. It remains
uncertain whether the Nicaraguan foreign minister will personally
attend the meeting, Huang added.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with CNA Sunday, Huang said, Taiwan faces tough
challenges on its diplomatic front due to China's perennial
efforts to lure away its diplomatic allies and block its presence
in world arena.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Huang said a so-called "wave of defection" or
"exodus" of Central American diplomatic allies to China after May
20 is speculative and far from truth.
