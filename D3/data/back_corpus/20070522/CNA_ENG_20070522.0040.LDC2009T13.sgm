NO-CONFIDENCE VOTE UNDER ASSESSMENT: KMT OFFICIAL
</HEADLINE>

Taipei, May 22 (CNA) 05/22/07  21:47:55 (By Flor Wang)
</P>
<P>
The opposition Kuomintang (KMT) is carefully assessing the
possibility of raising a no-confidence vote against Premier Chang
Chun-hsiung, who took over the post from Su Tseng-chang a day
earlier, a party official said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
KMT Secretary-General Wu Den-yih made the comments following the
party's legislative caucus meeting earlier the same day.
</P>
<P>
According to Wu, many of the KMT lawmakers are looking forward to
such a development because of Chang's poor performance during his
first premiership from October 2000-January 2002 and his present
lack of sincerity in wanting to break the gridlock between the
legislative and executive branches due to disputes over several
key bills.
</P>
<P>
Given that the opposition People First Party (PFP) has come up
with a decision to topple Chang's Cabinet, the KMT will
cautiously evaluate the possibility of joining the move, Wu said.
</P>
<P>
Although the issue was not touched on by KMT legislative caucus
members during their meeting, Wu warned the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) not to think the KMT and the PFP are just
bluffing.
</P>
<P>
As soon as the KMT decides to launch no-confidence vote, the
party will carry out the move, Wu said.
</P>
<P>
Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng of the KMT however, said
that toppling the Cabinet now will only lead to greater political
turmoil.
</P>
<P>
Wang urged the KMT to carefully assess the issue with the PFP and
make a concerted move after fully exchanging viewpoints with its
"pan blue alliance" ally.
</P>
<P>
DPP legislative caucus whip Ker Chien-ming called the KMT plan
"cheap tricks" aimed at diluting mounting pressure within the
KMT.
</P>
<P>
Ker said he will suggest that President Chen Shui-bian dissolve
the legislature once the no-confidence vote has been put forward.
</P>
<P>
Earlier that same day, PFP legislative caucus whip Fu Kun-chi
insisted that only by toppling the Cabinet can the impasse
between the "pan blue alliance" and the ruling DPP be resolved
and push Chen to face up to public mandate.
</P>
<P>
Fu said a no-confidence  vote must be introduced  in the
Legislative  Yuan to fully display  the "pan blue" lawmakers'
determination and executive ability.
</P>
<P>
Chang's order to halt construction of the fourth nuclear power
plant in late 2000 dealt a heavy blow to Taiwan's international
image, business credibility and economic development, Fu said,
arguing that the "pan blue" lawmakers should have toppled Chang
in the first instance when his Cabinet had been formed.
</P>
<P>
Chang was appointed by Chen to assume the premiership from May 21
after Su offered to resign from the post May 12 following his
defeat in the DPP's May 6 presidential primary.
