KMT CHIEF VOWS TO FIGHT 'FALSE' DPP CHARGES

Taipei,  April 25 (CNA) 04/25/07  21:27:19 (By Flor Wang)

Main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Wu Poh-hsiung vowed
Wednesday to take legal action against what he called "false
charges" made by the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)
concerning the party's assets.
</P>
<P>
Wu made the comments after Premier Su Tseng-chang earlier
presided over a ceremony in the Executive Yuan marking the launch
of a Cabinet Web site on the KMT's assets. Su encouraged the
public to visit the Web site and called for widespread support of
the government's drive to demand that the KMT return its ill-
gotten assets to the national coffers.
</P>
<P>
In the face of the DPP administration's efforts to re-appropriate
KMT's assets, Wu said that his party will undoubtedly file
lawsuits for each of the groundless accusations made by the DPP
in order to defend its name.
</P>
<P>
Labeling  the  KMT's  assets  a  historical  legacy,  KMT
Secretary-General Wu Duen-yih asked the DPP to stop rehashing
these issues before every election, and urged it to devote its
energy to improving Taiwan's economy.
</P>
<P>
If the KMT had been found to have committed crimes in obtaining
its assets, the DPP would have already dealt with it over the
past seven years, Wu said, arguing that it is "awful" that the
DPP should seek to deal with the KMT in this regard with the
legislative and presidential elections slated to be held in
December and March next year, respectively.
