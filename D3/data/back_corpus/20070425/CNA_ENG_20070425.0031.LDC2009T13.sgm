DPP WHIP CALLS FOR NO AMNESTY TO 2 OPPOSITION FIGURES
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  April 25 (CNA) 04/25/07  19:46:53 (By Y.L. Kao)
</P>
<P>
The ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) legislative caucus
convener said Wednesday that a proposed sentence commutation
plan should not be applicable to former Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman
Ma Ying-jeou and People First Party (PFP) Legislator Chiu Yi
because they committed major crimes.
</P>
<P>
Ker Chien-ming made the remarks after President Chen Shui-bian
instructed the Ministry of Justice (MOJ) last week to study the
feasibility of a national commutation of sentences or partial
amnesty for prison inmates.
</P>
<P>
The proposal is aimed at commuting sentences for those who
committed minor crimes and who have shown remorse, Ker said,
adding that as Chiu is a violent criminal and shows no
repentance, he is not eligible for a sentence reduction.
</P>
<P>
Chiu Yi was sentenced to 14 months in prison for his leading role
in a violent demonstration in the southern port city of Kaohsiung
after the 2004 presidential election in which the joint KMT-PFP
ticket lost by a razor-thin margin.
</P>
<P>
As for Ma, who has not been convicted of any offense, Ker said he
has been indicted for allegedly siphoning funds from his special
allowance fund when he was mayor of Taipei from 1998-2006.
Embezzling public funds is not a minor crime, Ker added.
</P>
<P>
On whether the commutation proposal will be written into law
before the May 20 anniversary  of President  Chen Shui-bian's
inauguration, Ker said it cannot be made that soon, as a draft of
the sentence reduction bill should first be drawn up by the MOJ,
followed by approval by the Executive Yuan and the Legislative
Yuan.
</P>
<P>
Ker added that the proposal is a response to calls from human
right groups, legislators across political spectrum and
grassroots representatives. Prison overpopulation is also a
factor, he added.
</P>
<P>
As most provisions in the existing commutation statute are
outdated, Ker said a new set of rules should be enacted to
prescribe targets and qualifications for commutation.
