Taipei,  April 25 (CNA) 04/25/07  15:51:29 (By Y.F. Low)

Taiwan would have to fight on its own for the first 10 to 14 days
in the event of a large-scale military attack by China, a
National Security Bureau (NSB) official said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The estimate is based on the presumption that the United States
would provide military support to Taiwan, according to NSB deputy
chief Wang Hsi-tien.
</P>
<P>
Wang said that while the United States is expected to intervene
in the event of a Chinese attack against Taiwan, it might react
differently if the attack were the result of provocative moves by
Taiwan beforehand.
</P>
<P>
Wang made the remarks during a meeting of the Legislative Yuan's
National Defense Committee while briefing legislators on the
results of a computerized warfare simulation held recently by the
military as part of the country's annual "Han Kuang" military
exercise.

On Tuesday, Timothy Keating, commander of the U.S. Pacific
Command (USPACOM) , said the United States will continue to make
available  to  Taiwan  advice, training  and  support  for
congressionally-approved equipment to defend against a military
attack by China.
</P>
<P>
However, Keating emphasized the United States' position remains
that Taiwan's actions should be defensive, rather than offensive,
in nature.
