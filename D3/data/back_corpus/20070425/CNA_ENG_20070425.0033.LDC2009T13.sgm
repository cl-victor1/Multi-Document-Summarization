Law enforcement agents arrested a Miaoli County councilor early
Wednesday on charges of intimidation, extortion and taking
forcible possession of other people's property.
</P>
<P>
Hsieh Wen-chun and eight accomplices were taken into custody
during the wee hours of the morning when local police and agents
from the Investigation Bureau of the Ministry of Justice, working
under the instructions of a Miaoli public prosecutor, raided
their homes.
</P>
<P>
According to a spokesman for the Investigation Bureau's mobile
unit in central Taiwan, Hsieh tried to take over a sand and
gravel company at a reduced price, but the company's owner
refused to sell.
</P>
<P>
Hsieh brought in gangsters and destroyed an access road used by
the company after making up an excuse that the company had been
excavating sand and gravel illegally.
</P>
<P>
Having scared off the owner through intimidation, Hsieh and his
accomplices took possession of the company's hydraulic crane,
truck and other equipment and sold them for NT$9 million.
</P>
<P>
According to the spokesman, Hsieh and his accomplices also beat a
video game shop owner and his workers and detained them for hours
at Hsieh's residence after they refused to pay the county
councilor a monthly "protection fee".
</P>
<P>
The Miaoli Public Prosecutors' Office is investigating whether
Hsieh has committed other wrongdoings against the people in his
constituency.
