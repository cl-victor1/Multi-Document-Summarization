PRESIDENT CALLS FOR SENTENCE COMMUTATIONS
</HEADLINE>

Taipei, April 24 (CNA) 04/25/07  10:20:33 (By Ruth Wang)

<P>
President Chen Shui-bian said Tuesday that he asked the Ministry
of Justice (MOJ) last week to work out a plan to grant sentence
commutations to prison inmates.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the previous commutation was meted out 16 years ago
to celebrate the 80th anniversary of the founding of the Republic
of China, the president said another commutation is appropriate
for this year as it is the 20th anniversary of the lifting of
martial law and the 60th anniversary of the 228 Incident.
</P>
<P>
The 228 Incident refers to a revolt of local people against the
government in 1947 during which many were killed in an ensuing
government crackdown.
</P>
<P>
Chen made the announcement during a meeting with visiting
Archbishop Emeritus of Cape Town Desmond Mpilo Tutu at his
office.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Vice Justice Minister Lee Chin-yung said that his
ministry is working on a draft of a punishment reduction bill in
line with Chen's instruction to commute some sentences this year.
</P>
<P>
Lee said the MOE's Department of Prosecutorial Affairs has
organized meetings with the Judicial Yuan, the National Police
Agency, the Investigation Bureau, the Taiwan High Prosecutor's
Office and military legal authorities to work on the draft that
will be sent to the Executive Yuan next week for approval.
</P>
<P>
The draft, Lee said, will neither cover criminals who committed
serious crimes nor be applied to people who committed serious
financial crimes after 1991.
</P>
<P>
Quoting Article 40 of the Constitution of the Republic of China,
Lee said the president has the power to grant amnesties, pardon,
cut sentences and reinstate civil rights in accordance with the
law. Taiwan has granted four general commutations since the
promulgation of the Constitution in 1947, he added.
