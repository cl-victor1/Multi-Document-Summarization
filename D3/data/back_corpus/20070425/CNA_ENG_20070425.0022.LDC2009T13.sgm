TSU UNHAPPY WITH DPP'S `STEALTHY' MOVE
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  April 25 (CNA) 04/25/07  17:22:21 (By Deborah Kuo)
</P>
<P>
A top official of the opposition Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU)
accused the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) Wednesday
of having "lured" TSU elite to join the DPP in a scheme to
enlarge the DPP support base so that the party can win in the
year-end legislative elections.
</P>
<P>
Unhappy with "constant" moves that the DPP have made to lure TSU
members, TSU Secretary-General Chien Cheng-shan said the DPP's
"stealthy" actions have damaged the harmony between the two
parties.
</P>
<P>
"The DPP should take all the responsibility should DPP-TSU
consultation and negotiation on the legislative elections fail, "
Chien said.
</P>
<P>
Chien said the TSU -- an ally of the DPP -- and the DPP have
reached a consensus that the two parties will cooperate in order
to garner the greatest possible victory for the "pan green camp"
in the legislative elections slated for December this year.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Chien noted, even before the two parties have begun
to talk, the DPP has "cut the ground from under the TSU's feet"
by luring away one more of the TSU elite.
</P>
<P>
Even DPP Chairman Yu Shyi-kun traveled south Tuesday to Yunlin to
witness a ceremony  marking former TSU County Councilor  Liao
Ching-hsiang's joining of the DPP, Chien noted. Liao quit the TSU
several days ago.
</P>
<P>
Chien said the TSU condemns the DPP's "unfriendly" action in the
strongest terms.
</P>
<P>
He urged the DPP to apologize to the TSU and to stop immediately
its "headhunting" scheme.
