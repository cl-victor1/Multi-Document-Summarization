Taipei,  Jan. 31 (CNA) 01/31/07  21:26:08 (By Han Nai-kuo)

The Prosecutors' Reform Association urged Wednesday that the
Ministry of Justice allow public prosecutors to work
independently instead of placing them under the command of the
government's executive branch.
</P>
<P>
Liu Cheng-wu,  a Taipei prosecutor  and spokesman for the
Prosecutors' Reform Association, said Taiwan's public prosecutors
should answer to the people, not those in power.
</P>
<P>
He explained that if the Ministry of Justice insists on placing
public prosecutors under the control of the Executive Yuan, it
will hamper their investigative work in criminal cases.
</P>
<P>
"If, under the current system, public prosecutors must answer to
the executive branch, then it is time to consider changing the
government system by making the prosecutors independent of the
Ministry of Justice and placing the prosecutors under the
Judicial Yuan," said Liu.
</P>
<P>
Liu made the remarks while commenting on the issue of whether the
Ministry of Justice should request an interpretation by the
Council of Grand Justices on Article 52 of the nation's
Constitution in order to clarify whether the scope of the head of
state's immunity also covers his family members.

<P>
First lady Wu Shu-jen, along with several former and incumbent
senior aides at the Presidential Office, is facing trial as a
defendant at the Taipei District Court after she and President
Chen Shui-bian were named by a public prosecutor as "joint
perpetrators" in an embezzlement case involving the alleged
misuse of state affairs funds.
</P>
<P>
After appearing in court on the first day of the trial Dec. 15
last year, the first lady has been absent ever since, using poor
health as an excuse.
</P>
<P>
Her lawyers have claimed that the trial should be stopped because
it is "unconstitutional."
</P>
<P>
The Executive Yuan's request for an interpretation of the
Constitution was turned down by the Grand Justices on the grounds
that it is not in a position to make such a request.
</P>
<P>
The Executive Yuan reportedly ordered the Ministry of Justice to
file a request to the Council of Grand Justice regardless of the
fact that the ministry is in an awkward position due to a
conflict of interests between the public prosecutors and the
executive branch.
