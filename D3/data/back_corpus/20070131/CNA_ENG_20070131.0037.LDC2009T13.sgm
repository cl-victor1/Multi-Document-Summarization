The National Science Council (NSC) has released a list of winners
of the 2006 Outstanding Research Awards, with 35 research fellows
from five major academic disciplines named, NSC officials said
Wednesday.

<P>
Among the 35 winners, six are from the field of natural science,
11 from engineering, nine from biology, eight from the humanities
and social sciences, and one from science education.

According to the NSC, 605 people applied for the award at the
beginning. After several rounds of review, the list was reduced
to 35 names. Each winner will receive a cash prize of NT$500,000.

<P>
NSC Deputy Minister Yang Hung-duen said that the council modified
the review rules for the award last June, reducing the maximum
number of winners per year to 35 and stipulating that a person
can only win the award once. Yang added that the reason for the
restriction is to allow more young talent the opportunity to win
the award.
