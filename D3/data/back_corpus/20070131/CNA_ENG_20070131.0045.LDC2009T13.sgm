CEC COMPLETES LEGISLATIVE CONSTITUENCY REDISTRICTING
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  Jan.  31 (CNA) 01/31/07  21:54:58 (By Lilian Wu)
</P>
<P>
The Central Election Commission (CEC) completed a redistricting
scheme of 25 cities and counties Wednesday for the year-end
legislative elections.
</P>
<P>
The CEC was able to meet the deadline for redistricting
lawmakers' constituencies after settling disputes over eight
contentious cities and counties by way of drawing lots.
</P>
<P>
Legislative Speaker Wang Jin-pyng and Premier Su Tseng-chang
continued their consultation on the contentious eight cities and
counties Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
With neither side willing to budge, they decided that the
secretary-generals of the two branches would let chance decide
and drew lots on the redistricting scheme of the eight cities and
counties under their supervision.
</P>
<P>
The result showed that Taipei and Taichung cities and Miaoli and
Changhua counties will adopt the version suggested by the CEC,
while Kaohsiung city will follow the consensus of the
legislature.  Taipei county will follow the proposal offered by
the opposition Taiwan Solidarity Union, Taoyuan county will adopt
the ruling Democratic Progressive Party's scheme, and Pingtung
county will use the scheme agreed upon by the Non-partisan
Solidarity Union, People First Party, Kuomintang and Taiwan
Solidarity Union.
</P>
<P>
Wang said that after five rounds of negotiations with the premier
without reaching an agreement, he was "relieved" that the thorny
problem of redistricting of the eight cities and counties could
be settled.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the Election and Recall Law of the Public
Functionaries stipulates that disputes over legislative
redistricting will be thrashed out by the heads of the Executive
and the Legislative branches.
</P>
<P>
"Drawing lots to settle the contentious parts should not give
rise to the questions of legality, " Wang said, who noted a day
earlier that both Su and he had been overwhelmed by phone calls
from incumbent lawmakers who are concerned about the outcome of
the negotiations over the past days.
</P>
<P>
"Moreover, given the fact that legislators across the party
spectrum do not trust the CEC, chance should be considered the
fairest way," he added.
</P>
<P>
CEC officials noted that the redistricting constituencies of 15
out of 25 cities and counties were approved by the Legislative
Yuan.
</P>
<P>
Ten out of the 15 cities and counties -- Yilan, Hsinchu, Hualien,
Taitung, Penghu, Kinmen and Matsu counties as well as Hsinchu,
Keelung, Chiayi cities will have only one seat, while Tainan city
and Kaohsiung, Yunlin, Chiayi, Nantou counties each will have two
constituencies with one seat in each of them.
</P>
<P>
Although the legislature had not passed the redistricting scheme
for Taichung and Tainan counties,  consultations  between the
legislative and executive branches had reached a consensus.
</P>
<P>
The redistricting scheme was made necessary because the seventh
Legislative Yuan will be elected  in accordance  with a new
"single-member constituency, two-vote" electoral system,
replacing the "multi-member constituency" system of the past. The
number of the seats will also be cut from 225 to a mere 113,
which will consist of 73 seats from 73 constituencies, six seats
for aborigines and 34 seats from legislators at large.
</P>
<P>
According to the law, the Legislative Yuan has to pass a
redistricting scheme worked out by the CEC 13 months before the
term of the current legislature expires in January 2008.
</P>
<P>
As the lawmakers could not agree on some parts of the plan before
the deadline passed, the premier and the legislative speaker
began first round of negotiation Jan. 24.
