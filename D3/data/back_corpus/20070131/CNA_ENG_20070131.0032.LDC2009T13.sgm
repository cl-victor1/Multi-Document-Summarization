FORMER PRESIDENT'S SHIFT AIMED AT POLITICAL GAIN: PFP SPOKESMAN
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  Jan.  31 (CNA) 01/31/07  19:02:12 (By Flor Wang)

Former President Lee Teng-hui's shift in his attitude toward
Taiwan independence is only aimed at prolonging his political
life in view of the implementation of a new electoral system in
December's legislative elections, People First Party (PFP)
spokesman Lee Hung-chun speculated Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Lee Hung-chun made the remarks while answering questions from
reporters on the issue after Next Magazine reported in its latest
edition that Lee, the so-called "spiritual leader" of the
opposition Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU), hopes to visit China,
forswears Taiwan independence and wants Taiwan to open up to
Chinese capital and tourists.
</P>
<P>
According to Lee Hung-chun, Lee's surprise denouncement of Taiwan
independence is only a ploy to rack up his own political gains
and prolong the survival of the TSU, rather than any kind of move
made out of concern for Taiwan's long-term development.
</P>
<P>
The new "single-member constituency, two-vote system" that will
be implemented in the year-end legislative election is set to see
the 225-seat Legislative Yuan slashed to 113 -- something which
will lead to a marked loss of clout for the smaller parties.
</P>
<P>
With the implementation of the new electoral system, it will be
harder for political parties to rehash the divisive independence
versus unification issue, according to Lin Hung-chun.
</P>
<P>
Huang Kun-huei, new chairman of the TSU, which has touted Taiwan
independence since its founding in 2000 and which only controls
12 seats in the present Legislative Yuan, said early this week
that his party is determined to shift to a left-leaning middle-
of-the-road position in the hope of winning the support of
moderate voters.
</P>
<P>
The PFP, the main opposition Kuomintang and the New Party form
the pro- unification "pan-blue alliance" against the pro-
independence "pan-green camp" of the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party and the TSU as of lately.
