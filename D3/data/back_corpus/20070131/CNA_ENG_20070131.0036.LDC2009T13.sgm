</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  Jan.  31 (CNA) 01/31/07  19:20:22 (By Elizabeth Hsu)
</P>
<P>
Premier Su Tseng-chang urged opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman
Ma Ying-jeou Wednesday to "make the people's livelihoods his top
priority" and to allow the government's 2007 budget bill to clear
the floor of the Legislative Yuan as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
Su expressed regret at an Executive Yuan meeting over the failure
of the general budget bill to pass the legislature in November,
marking the first time in Taiwan's history that the Legislative
Yuan failed to pass the government budget before a new fiscal
year began.
</P>
<P>
The law requires the legislature to approve the general budget
one month before the fiscal year begins Jan. 1.
</P>
<P>
The latest legislative session ended Jan. 19 amid clashes between
lawmakers of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) and
the opposition "pan blue alliance" of the KMT and the People
First Party over a draft bill concerning the organization of the
Central Election Commission (CEC).
</P>
<P>
The premier advised Ma to refrain from using the budget bill as a
bargaining chip in exchange for the passage of the KMT-proposed
draft CEC organic act. "Don't block the people's welfare out of
selfish concerns, " Su said.
</P>
<P>
The opposition-controlled legislature is not expected to address
the 2007 budget bill until March because the legislature will
first hold general interpellation sessions when the new
legislative session opens next month.
</P>
<P>
In the  Wednesday  meeting,  Su expressed  thanks  to his
administration for making great efforts in the promotion of the
country's economic development over the past year.
</P>
<P>
Citing statistics, Su praised the team for creating last year the
nation's lowest unemployment rate in six years, while generating
US$266.1 billion in foreign exchange reserves, posing a nearly
3-fold growth compared with the level of 2000.
</P>
<P>
He has also kept his promise, made a year ago when took over the
premiership, to control the annual growth of the average
consumers' price index under the ceiling of 2 percent, Su said,
noting that the index recorded a slight 0.6 percent growth in
2006.
</P>
<P>
In terms of foreign investment in Taiwan, the investment stood at
US$13.97 billion last year, registering 230 percent year-on-year
growth, Su said.
