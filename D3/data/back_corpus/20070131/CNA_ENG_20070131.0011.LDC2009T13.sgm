The British Museum is privileged to put on an exhibition of part
of the museum's extensive collections in Taiwan to allow the
Taiwan public to know better the facets of the evolution of human
civilization, the museum's deputy director Andrew Burnett said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The exhibition, titled "Treasures of the World's Cultures: The
British Museum After 250 Years, " is scheduled to open at the
National Palace Museum in suburban Taipei Feb. 4 for a nearly
four-month  run,  said Burnett during a meeting with Taiwan's
representative in the United Kingdom, Edgar Lin, at the museum.
</P>
<P>
Burnett said the British Museum, which calls itself "a museum of
the world," hopes that through this exhibition, the Taiwan people
can gain a better understanding of different facets of various
cultures and civilizations over time,  thus helping them become
"world citizens" who have a world vision.
</P>
<P>
Lin,  accompanied by two senior officials from the Taipei
Representative Office in the United Kingdom, paid a courtesy
visit to Burnett and Jan Stuart, keeper of the British Museum's
Department of Asia, who are scheduled to depart for Taipei
Wednesday for the exhibition.
</P>
<P>
Stuart specializes in Chinese art and culture, with a focus on
the period from the beginning of the Song Dynasty (960-1279)
through to the end of the Qing Dynasty (1644-1912).
</P>
<P>
Burnett, keeper of Coins and Medals at the British Museum, said
to Lin that the National Palace Museum (NPM) is an important
world-class museum and that the British Museum may consider
arranging for a special  exhibition  of NPM's exquisite  and
invaluable collections at the British Museum in the future.
</P>
<P>
The "Treasures of the World's Cultures: The British Museum After
250 Years" exhibition in Taipei -- to be divided into 13
sections, including cultures of early civilization, Mesopotamia,
Egypt, Europe, Asia, the Islamic World, Africa, Oceania and the
Americas and covering sculptures and paintings as well as
historical and cultural artifacts from the Paleolithic Age up to
the 20th century -- will be the fourth of its kind in Asia
following similar shows in Japan, South Korea and China.
</P>
<P>
According to Burnett, about 15 percent of the 271 historical
artifacts that will be displayed at the NPM exhibition will be
making their first appearance in Asia.
</P>
<P>
The British Museum has worked with NPM for over two years to
bring the exhibition to Taiwan. All selected works have arrived
in Taipei, and many of them have already been unpacked, including
a wooden inner coffin of a mummy- case, a wooden mummy-board
called "The Unlucky Mummy," and a "Bust of Antinous, " a fine
marble statue from the second century Roman Empire.
</P>
<P>
The exhibition is slated to run until May 27.
</P>
<P>
One of the three major museums in the world, the British Museum
owns a collection of over seven million artifacts and antiques.
Receiving a regular subsidy of 35 million pounds (US$68.76
million) a year from the British government, the museum regularly
displays about 50,000 items from its mammoth collection on a
rotational basis.
</P>
<P>
The British Museum attracted five million visitors last year and
it has found that the demand for mandarin Chinese-tour guides
working in the museum has kept rising as the number of Chinese-
speaking visitors continues to increase, Burnett said.
