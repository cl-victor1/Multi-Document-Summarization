</HEADLINE>

Rome,  Jan.  30 (CNA) 01/31/07  18:37:27 (By Huang Kwang-chun and

The newly elected chairman of a pro-Taiwan group in the Italian
parliament, Gustavo Selva, said Tuesday that he will seek to
boost substantive exchanges and friendly relations between the
two countries.
</P>
<P>
Selva made the promise shortly after he was elected at a banquet
to mark the group's re-organization.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the Chamber of Deputies adopted a resolution in 2004
urging the Italian government to support Taiwan's bid to join the
World Health Organization (WHO) , Selva said his group will
continue to push for the government to back Taiwan's WHO bid.
</P>
<P>
It is unfair that Taiwan, a nation that has made impressive
achievements in the field of politics and economics, has been
shut out of international organizations, especially the world
health body, according to Selva.
</P>
<P>
Despite being a fledgling democracy, Taiwan's president and
legislators are directly elected by popular vote, Selva said. In
addition, the nation has successfully carried out a power
transfer between different political parties, he went on.
</P>
<P>
On the economic front, Selva said Taiwan has emerged as the
world's 14th-largest economy and that trade exchanges between the
two countries have been growing rapidly, with two-way trade
volume in 2006 posting a 15 percent growth year-on- year.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, investment by the Taiwan business community in Italy
is on the rise, while the number of Taiwanese tourist arrivals
has also recorded stable growth, with Taiwan people making
400,000 visits to Italy in 2006, according to Selva.
</P>
<P>
For his part, Taiwan representative to Italy Cheng Hsin, who was
also present at the banquet, expressed gratitude to the pro-
Taiwan group members for their support for Taiwan's cause and
contributions to boosting bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
Chang also invited the parliamentarians to visit Taiwan to gain a
further understanding of the current situation and to strengthen
substantive relations between the two nations.
