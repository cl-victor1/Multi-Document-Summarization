</HEADLINE>

Taipei,   Jan.  31  (CNA) 01/31/07  18:08:42 (By Y.F. Low)
</P>
<P>
Premier Su Tseng-chang pressed the Broadcasting Corporation of
China (BCC) Wednesday to return two radio frequencies that it had
promised to relinquish.
</P>
<P>
Su also instructed Minister without Portfolio Lin Ferng-ching to
supervise the National Communications Commission (NCC) to
exercise its duties properly and reclaim the two radio
frequencies from the BCC, threatening to investigate the
responsibility of the NCC if it fails to do so.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the issue during a weekly Cabinet meeting, Su pointed
out that the BCC promised to surrender the two radio frequencies
when renewing its business license in 2005 and that it has so far
not honored the promise.
</P>
<P>
Su noted that radio frequencies belong to the country and the
people and that the government must not allow any individuals or
political parties to embezzle the national resources.
</P>
<P>
The BCC, which was originally owned by the former ruling
Kuomintang (KMT), was sold to former UFO Radio Chairman Jaw Shau-
kong last year.
</P>
<P>
On the KMT's sale of its shares in the Central Motion Picture Co.
(CMPC) to a private group last year, Su said many of the assets
held by the CMPC were national property embezzled by the KMT
during the party's past authoritarian rule.
</P>
<P>
Accusing the KMT of lining its own pockets by selling its shares
in the CMPC, Su ordered the Ministry of Justice to investigate
the alleged irregularities involving the sale, which he said
include embezzlement, forgery, breach of trust and fraud.
</P>
<P>
Su said that as Taiwan has transformed from authoritarianism to
democracy, the government must shoulder its responsibility and
deal with the issue of transitional justice properly. It must not
allow the KMT to continue to infringe upon the people's
interests, he added.
