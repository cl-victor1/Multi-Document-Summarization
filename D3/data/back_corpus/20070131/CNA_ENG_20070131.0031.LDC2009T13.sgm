The China Medical University Hospital is trying to recruit 120
volunteers affected by liver spots to test the effectiveness of a
newly developed Chinese herbal medicine formula in removing the
brown-black patches of skin that appear on the face and backs of
the hands of middle-aged and elderly people.

<P>
Chan  Ya-min,  director  of the hospital's  Chinese-Western
Cooperative Treatment Center, said those who want to join the
four-month  experimental treatment program should submit their
applications to the center before June.
</P>
<P>
Chan said that after using the Chinese herbal medicine compound
preparation to treat a female patient in her fifties for about
three months, her liver spots gradually disappeared.
</P>
<P>
She added that following up on the initial success, her center
plans to try the formula on more people affected by liver spots.

<P>
Liver spots, also called age spots, are actually unrelated to the
liver or liver function. They are extremely common after the age
of 40, occurring most often on the backs of the hands, the
forearms, shoulder, face, forehead and areas of highest sun
exposure.
</P>
<P>
Liver spots are harmless and painless but may affect the cosmetic
appearance.
</P>
<P>
The real causes of liver spots are still known, although aging
and exposure to the sun may contribute to increased pigmentation
of the skin.
