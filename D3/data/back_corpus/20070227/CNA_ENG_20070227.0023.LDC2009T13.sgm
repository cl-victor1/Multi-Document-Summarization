The China Shipbuilding Corp. (CSBC) completed repainting its new
name, "Taiwan International Shipbuilding Corp.", in Chinese on
the huge Goliath crane at the CSBC Kaohsiung shipyard, a CSBC
official said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The working crew spent the whole day painting the CSBC's new
Chinese name on the Goliath bridge crane, which is a hallmark of
the CSBC. The repainting task was not easy as the Goliath crane
is 177 meters wide and 87 meters high, and each Chinese character
on it covers nine square meters, which is the equivalent of
approximately three stories in height.

<P>
The official said that the CSBC's name-change plan has been
approved by its board directors, and is awaiting final approval
by CSBC general investors March 1. That motion is expected to
pass smoothly as the Ministry of Economic Affairs holds most of
the stocks of the CSBC.

<P>
Premier Su will host an unveiling ceremony marking the CSBC's new
name March 3 after the plan's final approval, the official said.
