</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  Feb. 27 (CNA) 02/27/07  18:29:04 (By Flor Wang)
</P>
<P>
President Chen Shui-bian said Tuesday that the government should
consider adjusting the special treatment accorded to the late
President Chiang Kai-shek but that the change is by no means
aimed at fanning an ethnic row.
</P>
<P>
Chen made the remarks at the Presidential Office during a meeting
with a group of victims' families from the 228 Incident, recently
returned from the United States.
</P>
<P>
Stressing that "now is the time for the government to face up to
the truth and hold the culprits accountable 60 years after the
tragedy, " Chen said that it is a very serious issue and cannot
be dodged.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of Taiwanese elite were massacred by the KMT government
troops during the 228 Incident, in which local people rose
against an authoritarian KMT rule in Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Although  the government  has taken some measures to help
compensate for damage to the Taiwanese people, including the
creation of a 228 Memorial Fund and the publication of a series
of reports on the 1947 incident, Chen said that the government
should consider adjusting the special treatment accorded Chiang
now that solid evidence points to him as the main culprit behind
the tragedy.
</P>
<P>
The government's plan to remove the guards posted at Chiang's
mausoleum in Tahsi township in northern Taoyuan county and a
planned name change for the Chiang Kai-shek memorial Hall in
downtown Taipei were not made with any intention of stoking
ethnic disputes, rather, it is a step forward toward clarifying
the truth of the incident and doing justice to the suffering of
the victims and their families, Chen said.
</P>
<P>
The president said Monday that the Chiang's mausoleum and the
Chiang Kai-shek Memorial Hall should be phased out to purge
Taiwan of Chiang's lingering shadow.
</P>
<P>
Premier Su Tseng-chang said the same day that he supports the
president's proposal on renaming the Chiang Kai-shek Memorial
Hall to Taiwan  Democracy Memorial  Park  so as to observe
Taiwan's democratization.
</P>
<P>
The Chiang Kai-shek Memorial  Hall could serve as a good
exhibition  venue  for the government  to mark  the country's
democratization process, Su said.
</P>
<P>
Ruling Democratic Progressive Party Chairman Yu Shyi-kun asked
the Executive Yuan withdraw guards and relevant personnel
stationed at Chiang's mausoleum as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
Yu also asked former KMT Chairman Ma Yin-jeou, the person most
likely to represent the opposition "pan-blue alliance" in the
2008 presidential election, to stop whitewashing the history of
the Chiang regime and stop paying respect to Chiang on his death
day at his tomb.
