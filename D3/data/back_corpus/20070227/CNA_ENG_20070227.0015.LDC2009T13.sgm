Residents of the offshore county of Penghu are expected to be
allowed before the end of March to travel to China via the
Taiwan-held outlying islands of Kinmen and Matsu, Mainland
Affairs Council (MAC) Chairman Joseph Wu said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Fielding questions at the Legislative Yuan, Wu said that pushing
for the implementation of expanded transport links between
Taiwan's outlying islands of Kinmen and Matsu and the cities of
Xiamen, Quanzhou and Fuzhou in the Chinese province of Fujian --
better known as the "mini links" -- is a set policy of the
government and that the MAC has spared no efforts to carry it
out.
</P>
<P>
Wu said residents of Penghu Island -- which is located near the
mid-point of the Taiwan Strait -- will be able by the end of
March at the latest to travel to China via Kinmen or Matsu after
they have applied for the relevant travel documents.
</P>
<P>
Wu added that relevant regulations are still being crafted and
need to be passed by the legislature for formal implementation.
