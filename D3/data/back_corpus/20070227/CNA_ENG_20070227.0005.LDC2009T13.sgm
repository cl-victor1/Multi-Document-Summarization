LEGISLATIVE SPEAKER IN NO HURRY TO ANNOUNCE CANDIDACY: AIDES
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taipei,  Feb. 26 (CNA) 02/27/07  10:39:12 (By Flor Wang)
</P>
<P>
Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng, a stalwart of the main
opposition Kuomintang (KMT) , is in no hurry to announce his
presidential candidacy, his aides said over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
Although Wang is widely seen as a potential contender for the
2008 presidency, his aides said that he has no plans to formally
announce his bid at present but might do so around the Lantern
Festival -- which falls on March 4 this year.
</P>
<P>
At that time, Wang will put forward a comprehensive discourse and
vision on his philosophy of how to rule the country, his aides
said.
</P>
<P>
December's legislative elections are Wang's top concern for the
time being as they are critical to the KMT's chances of victory
in the 2008 presidential race and will have ramifications for the
party's sustainable development and continued cooperation with
the People First Party to maintain a majority in the Legislative
Yuan, they said.
</P>
<P>
In addition, they went on, the KMT's chairman election and the
variables surrounding former Chairman Ma Ying-jeou, are also
issues of concern to Wang.
</P>
<P>
Ma stepped down from the party's top post and announced his
desire to take part in the next presidential polls after being
indicted in the middle of this month on corruption charges over
alleged misuse of a special municipal allowance earmarked for his
discretionary use during his term as mayor of Taipei from
1998-2006.
</P>
<P>
These thorny issues must be carefully handled by the new KMT
chairman, the aides quoted Wang as saying. Wang contends that it
is better to elect a new chairman within the next month, they
pointed out.
</P>
<P>
But Wang remains unchanged regarding his plan to visit China as
part of his efforts to make peace cross the Taiwan Strait,
despite the fact that the planned trip may be postponed to April
from originally scheduled March, the aides said.
</P>
<P>
Wang also favors the idea of inviting Honorary Chairman Lien Chan
to assume the KMT's chairmanship the sooner the better, they
said, adding that Wang is not seeking to compete against acting
KMT Chairman Wu Po-hsiung for the chairmanship.
</P>
<P>
Citing the results of several recent polls, Wang's aides said
that more than 60 percent of respondents said no indicted
candidates should be allowed to pursue the presidency, ahead of
37 percent who are in favor of a recent KMT rule change to give
Ma the right to take part in the 2008 presidential election.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Lien is expected to help mediate between Ma and Wang
in seeking the KMT's nomination to represent the party in the
next presidential race, they said.
