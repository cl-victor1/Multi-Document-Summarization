KMT TENTATIVELY SETS APRIL 7 FOR PARTY CHAIRMAN BY-ELECTION
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  Feb. 27 (CNA) 02/27/07  18:49:05 (By Lilian Wu)

<P>
The main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) has tentatively set April 7
for a by- election to select the party's chairman, KMT Secretary-
General Wu Den-yih said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Wu said this was in response to a recent call by Legislative Yuan
Speaker Wang Jin-pyng, who wanted a new party head to be
installed as early as possible.
</P>
<P>
Wang, a former KMT vice chairman, said recently that he has no
plans to run for the post of KMT chairman and praised Wu Poh-
hsiung, the party's first vice chairman who is serving as acting
chairman, as a good candidate for the party's chairmanship.
</P>
<P>
But Wu Den-yih also said that the date still has to be confirmed
by a meeting of the KMT Central Standing Committee Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
He said that if the date passes, the party will proclaim the
process for the by- election March 1, after which there be a
little time for hopefuls to solicit sufficient endorsements
before April 7.
</P>
<P>
The by-election has been made necessary by Ma Ying-jeou's
resignation as party chairman Feb. 13 immediately after he was
indicted on corruption charges for his alleged misuse of a
special allowance fund put under his discretionary use during his
two-term mayoralty between 1998 and 2006. Ma also announced
simultaneously his bid for the 2008 presidential election.
</P>
<P>
Wu noted that a party chairman by-election will cost about NT$20
million (US$606,000), and that some party members have suggested
that the by-election be held in tandem with a primary vote to
select the party's presidential candidate May 26.
</P>
<P>
But most party members later concurred that the major task of a
party chairman is to coordinate the party's slate of candidates
for the year-end legislative election as well as the March 2008
presidential election, so that the date should be set at some
point prior to the presidential primary.
</P>
<P>
Reports said that no one has come forward to express interest in
running for the party's head.
</P>
<P>
Wu Poh-hsiung, though favored by all sides, said recently that he
is not considering the matter right now, pointing out that his
top priority now is reinforcing party unity.
