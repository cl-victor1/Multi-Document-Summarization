Premier Su Tseng-chang urged all aspirants contending to
represent the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) in the
2008 presidential election to give President Chen Shui-bian room
to mediate among them.
</P>
<P>
Chen is reportedly  supposed to begin mediating among DPP
presidential hopefuls after the registration deadline for the
party's primary for the presidential election ends March 9 to
help produce the strongest ticket for the election. The party is
scheduled to make public its official presidential candidate May
30.
</P>
<P>
While urging the DPP presidential aspirants to allow Chen some
room for mediation, Su said the hopefuls should also respect the
president's opinions and efforts in this regard.
</P>
<P>
Su said he believes  that the president  will engage  in
comprehensive thinking before moving to mediate and will help
work out who is the most acceptable candidate with the greatest
chance of winning the presidential race.
</P>
<P>
Su and former premiers Frank Hsieh and Yu Shyi-kun have all
announced their bids to represent the ruling DPP in the next
election. Local newspapers have speculated that Chen may push for
Su and Hsieh to be on the DPP's presidential ticket.
</P>
<P>
On questions regarding whether a debate among the aspirants or a
public opinion poll should be conducted to help the DPP arrive at
a consensus regarding the party's ticket in the next election, Su
said he remains open to all of these options.
</P>
<P>
Vice President Annette Lu, another DPP heavyweight, has yet to
announce whether she will make a bid to represent the party in
the presidential election and has remained tightlipped regarding
the issue of Chen's possible mediation or a DPP presidential
primary.
