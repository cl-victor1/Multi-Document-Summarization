HEALTH DEPT. NOT TO REGULATE COPPER LEVELS IN OYSTERS
</HEADLINE>

Taipei, Feb. 27 (CNA) 02/27/07  19:21:26 (By Lilian Wu)

The Department of Health (DOH) said Tuesday that it is not
considering regulation of copper levels in oysters in view of the
fact that most other countries have not imposed similar limits.
</P>
<P>
The DOH was responding to a call by the Consumers' Foundation,
which urged the government to regulate copper levels in the wake
of its random check of 20 samples of oysters in market and
finding three samples contained copper levels in excess of 200
ppm.
</P>
<P>
Cheng Hui-wen, director general of DOH's Bureau of Food Safety,
said that the bureau will not contemplate setting up a maximum
level for the time being.
</P>
<P>
Cheng said that copper, which is easily worked out of the body,
is generally not considered a health hazard. In addition, copper
is one of the metal elements of which all animals require trace
amounts.
</P>
<P>
Cheng said that Taiwan, as well as most other countries in the
world, has not regulated every kind of heavy metal, and has only
set maximum limits on highly toxic metals such as mercury and
lead.
</P>
<P>
Lin Chieh-liang, director of Clinical Toxic Department of Chang
Kung Memorial Hospital, also said that oysters tend to accumulate
heavy metals easily, but it is easy for the human body to
eliminate copper.
</P>
<P>
Unless one eats several kilograms of oysters a day, these levels
of copper will not affect one's organs, including the liver where
many toxins accumulate, Lin added.
</P>
<P>
But DOH health officials nonetheless reminded consumers to be
careful not to choose oysters whose color is green, as this
indicates high levels of copper.
