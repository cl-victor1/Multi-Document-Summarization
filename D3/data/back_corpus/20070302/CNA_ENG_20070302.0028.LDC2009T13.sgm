<P>
Drug addicts infected with AIDS are no longer to be excluded from
addiction treatment centers, according to a law amendment passed
by the legislature Friday.
</P>
<P>
Article 7 of the Statute on the Execution of Drug Addiction
Treatment currently stipulates that treatment centers should not
accept  drug abusers  with statutory  and government-designated
infectious diseases and AIDS.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Justice proposed the amendment out of concern
that the prevalence of AIDS is closely connected to that of drug
abuse -- as many drug abusers catch the disease through sharing
needles -- and that the spread of AIDS is getting worse.
