Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng admitted Friday that he is
preparing for the 2008 presidential race but added that he is in
no hurry to make a formal announcement confirming such a bid.
</P>
<P>
Wang, a stalwart of the main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) and a
former KMT vice chairman, said that preparations for his
presidential bid are nearly all set and that he will choose an
opportune date to announce his running for the presidency.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Wang said to the media at the Legislative Yuan that he
has no plans to run for the post of KMT chairman -- a position
vacated by Ma Ying-jeou who resigned Feb. 13 only hours after
being indicted on corruption charges for his alleged misuse of a
special allowance fund for his discretionary use during his two
terms as Taipei mayor from 1998 to 2006. Ma simultaneously
announced that he will run for president in 2008.
</P>
<P>
The KMT will hold a by-election April 7 to select a new party
chairman.

<P>
In an exclusive interview carried in the latest edition of the
Hong Kong-based Chinese-language weekly Yazhou Zhoukan, Wang said
that after serving in Taiwan politics for 31 years,  he has
accumulated many more "competitive edges" over Ma.
</P>
<P>
When asked about his comments in the interview, Wang declined to
explain what exactly his "competitive edges" are over Ma, saying
that he would not underline his own strengths and merits.
However, he added that he doesn't know what "competitive edges"
Ma might have over him.
