VP DISCUSSES FEMALE LEADERSHIP ISSUE WITH NOBEL PEACE LAUREATE
</HEADLINE>

Taipei, March 2 (CNA) 03/02/07  16:31:38 (By Deborah Kuo)

<P>
Vice President Annette Lu, who has remained tightlipped on her
presidential bid, discussed the issue of female leadership Friday
with visiting Nobel Peace Prize winner from Northern Ireland
Betty Williams.
</P>
<P>
Lu said there have been comments in Taiwan recently that "those
who wear skirts cannot become commander-in-chief of the armed
forces," which she said she disagrees with.
</P>
<P>
She said feminism might have been scathingly criticized some 35
years ago, but this same discourse is now supported by people of
both genders around the world, adding that so far, the world has
seen 58 female ministers of defense.
</P>
<P>
According to Lu, 99.9 percent of the world's wars were triggered
and launched by men, but she claimed that the results of those
wars would have been different if women had been allowed to
participate in the decision-making process.
</P>
<P>
For her part, Williams, who was a co-recipient of the Nobel Prize
in Peace in 1976, urged Lu to announce her presidential bid the
sooner the better, saying that Lu is absolutely qualified to run
for the next presidency.
</P>
<P>
Noting that there are seldom "pearls" in politics, Williams
described Lu as a "pearl of a few pearls."
</P>
<P>
Williams, who visited Taiwan in March 2004 to witness the days
prior to the 2004 presidential election, said Taiwan and Northern
Ireland have many things in common, including similar territorial
areas and each facing a hostile rival -- England to Northern
Ireland and China to Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Claiming that both Taiwan and Northern Ireland have fought for
the cause of freedom, Williams said it is a daunting task to
fight for that cause by means of rational or non-violent
approaches.
</P>
<P>
Williams said Lu has a unique leadership style and is capable of
handling the delicate yet thorny cross-Taiwan Strait issue.
