Law enforcement agents have busted an illegal drug ring engaged
in smuggling nimetazepam -- a hypnotic drug -- to Malaysia
through the post, the Coast Guard Administration (CGA) announced
Friday.
</P>
<P>
A CGA spokesman said the ring's female leader, Liu Hsiu-jun, had
disguised herself as a reporter from the International Daily News
and that she and her accomplice, Liu Chia-sheng, had bought the
illegal drug from a wholesaler, Chen Yun-han, and then smuggled
it to Malaysia by parcel post.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that a CGA mobile unit in northern Taiwan
received tip-offs that the ring was to take delivery of a large
batch of nimetazepam tablets Thursday night on Kuiyang Street in
Taipei.
</P>
<P>
A task force formed by CGA agents, Taipei city police and
military police from the port city of Keelung caught the
ringleader and her followers red-handed and seized 18,000 tablets
of the drug worth NT$3 million.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman added that the Taipei Public Prosecutors Office
pressed charges against the drug pushers after interrogating
them.

<P>
Nimetazepam, marketed under brand name EriminR, is a highly
hypnotic drug which is a benzodiazepine derivative. It possesses
anxiolytic, anticonvulsant, sedative and skeletal muscle relaxant
properties.
</P>
<P>
Because the drug has been subject to abuse, especially by persons
addicted to amphetamines or opiates, it is no longer sold in most
western nations, but is still subject to significant abuse in
some South East Asian countries, including Japan and Malaysia.
