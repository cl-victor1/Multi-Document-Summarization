Taiwan has experienced a warmer winter than usual this year due
to weak cold weather systems, with an average  temperature  of
19.49  degrees  Celsius during  the December-February period,
according to tallies released Friday by the Central Weather
Bureau (CWB).
</P>
<P>
The figure is 1.45 degrees Celsius higher than the average
temperature for the December-February period over the last 30
years, according to the CWB tallies.
</P>
<P>
It is also the second highest over the past three decades, behind
only the average temperature of 19.51 degrees Celsius recorded
for the December-February period in 2001, according to the
tallies.

Meanwhile, a CWB analysis of climate monitoring data has revealed
that the El Nino phenomenon, which appeared last August, has
weakened significantly during the last two months and is expected
to cease very soon.
</P>
<P>
According to the CWB's forecast, the average temperature from
March to May "has the largest probability of being near normal"
while there is still a possibility that it will be warmer than
normal in April.
</P>
<P>
The CWB also reminded people that Taiwan will be entering the
spring season in March and April when frontal systems with strong
convective cells usually form up around the island. The systems
often induce heavy rainfall and occasionally induce
thunderstorms, CWB meteorologists said, cautioning people to be
on alert.
