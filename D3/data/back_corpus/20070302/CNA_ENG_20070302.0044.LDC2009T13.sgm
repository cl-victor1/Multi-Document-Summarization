CHINA'S HOSTILITY COULD FORCE TAIWAN TOWARD INDEPENDENCE:
PRESIDENT
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taipei,  March 2 (CNA) 03/02/07  21:20:41 (By Sofia Wu)
</P>
<P>
President Chen Shui-bian has said in an interview with a German
news agency that China's hostility will very likely force Taiwan
to move toward independence.
</P>
<P>
According to reports issued by Deutsche Press Agentur (dpa)
Friday, Chen has warned China's leaders that Taiwan is "very
likely... to take more actions toward further independence" and
that China itself is to blame.
</P>
<P>
Chen gave the interview with dpa President Malte von Trotha and
Beijing Bureau Chief Andreas Landwehr in Taipei Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Stressing that the people of Taiwan regard their country as an
independent sovereign state, Chen said China's missile
deployments and "very hostile posture toward Taiwan" would drive
the island's 23 million people toward more autonomy.
</P>
<P>
"For the people of Taiwan, we see our country as an independent,
sovereign state, " he said.
</P>
<P>
Chen also warned of China's military buildup, saying it poses a
threat not only to Taiwan but also to the Asia-Pacific.
</P>
<P>
"Instead of a peaceful emergence of China, as it claims, we see
it as a military emergence of China, " Chen charged, pointing to
the 988 missiles China has deployed along its southeastern coast
facing Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
The number of China's missiles facing Taiwan has increased
fivefold since Chen took office in 2000 and continues to increase
at the rate of 100 to 120 annually, he said.
</P>
<P>
The missiles as well as China's refusal to renounce the use of
force against Taiwan and the Anti-Secession Law China passed in
March 2005 have laid "a legal foundation for a future military
invasion of Taiwan" and "are truly provocative gestures," Chen
said.
</P>
<P>
"In the foreseeable future, I don't think that the two sides of
the Taiwan Strait will go for unification, " he added. "Quite the
contrary, it is very likely that the actions taken by Beijing
authorities will force the people of Taiwan to take more actions
toward further independence."
</P>
<P>
Chen didn't elaborate on what actions Taiwan may take to promote
independence under China's threat and hostility.
</P>
<P>
He just said that because of China's military buildup, its
refusal to recognize Taiwan's formal existence and its blockage
of Taiwan's efforts to rejoin the United Nations and launch
diplomatic ties with other nations, "it has made Taiwan people
more and more aware of their own national identity. Moreover, it
has prompted the people to be more persistent in adopting this
Taiwan- centric consciousness."
</P>
<P>
In the interview, Chen thanked the United Sates and Japan for
helping boost Taiwan's defense but stressed that Taiwan must
depend on itself for its security.
</P>
<P>
"We have an old saying that goes 'If one sits and waits for
heavenly provisions, one would starve to death, ' so if you only
rely on others to defend your country, you are bound to be
defeated," Chen said in the interview.
</P>
<P>
While Taiwan has no intention of engaging in any kind of arms
race with China, Chen said Taiwan must enhance its self-defense
capabilities.
</P>
<P>
He added, however, that the best defense for Taiwan is not
weapons, but democracy.
</P>
<P>
"We believe that Taiwan's democracy is a success story and
Taiwan's democracy serves as the best missile defence for
Taiwan," he said, adding that Taiwan's success in democracy also
is a lighthouse to the 1.3 billion people of China."
