Placido Domingo, a world-famous Spanish tenor, will perform at
the National Concert Hall in Taipei City March 3.
</P>
<P>
Domingo arrived in Taipei Thursday. He said he will sing with the
young Argentine soprano Virginia Tola at the performance, with
Eugene Kohn conducting the Taipei Symphony Orchestra. The
performance will include classical operatic numbers for which
Domingo is well known, such as Wagner's "Die Walklure".

Domingo will sing tenor at the performance in Taipei, but
announced that he will switch ranges to baritone to take on a
demanding role in Verdi's Simon Boccanegra in 2009.
</P>
<P>
Domingo also said that the Chinese opera The First Emperor, in
which he played the leading role of the emperor Qin Shi Huang at
New York's Metropolitan Opera in 2006, will be performed at the
2008 Olympics in Beijing.

<P>
With ample experience from having played more than 123 roles, the
musician said he plans to take the challenge of playing at least
a further two characters over the coming three musical seasons.
</P>
<P>
A superstar tenor due to his strong, versatile voice, Domingo is
also the general director of the Washington National Opera and
the Los Angeles Opera. He describes passion as being the key to
his success in managing so many different roles.
