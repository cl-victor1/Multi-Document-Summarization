TAIWAN, CHINA EXPECTED TO REACH CONSENSUS ON TOURISM SHORTLY: MAC
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  March 2 (CNA) 03/02/07  18:23:59 (By Deborah Kuo)

Taiwan's top China policy planner said Friday that cross-Taiwan
Strait negotiations over the issue of Chinese citizens being
allowed to visit Taiwan for tourism have entered the final stage
and that the two sides are expected to reach a consensus shortly.
</P>
<P>
Mainland Affairs Council Chairman Joseph Wu told reporters Friday
that he made the remarks during a visit from Deutsche Press
Agentur (dpa) President Malte von Trotha and dpa Beijing Bureau
chief Andreas Landwehr a day earlier.
</P>
<P>
Wu said he told his German visitors that everybody has been
asking him when Chinese citizens will be allowed to travel to
Taiwan for sightseeing, but pointed out that this is an issue
involving the intentions of the governments from both sides of
the strait. "All Taiwan can do is strenuously seek negotiations
with China in the hope that this goal will be achieved at the
earliest possible date, " he added.
</P>
<P>
He noted that ordinary Chinese citizens have been unable to visit
Taiwan as tourists as a result of the long separation between the
two sides, adding that under Chinese communist rule, the Chinese
people have viewed  Taiwan and its people  from wrong and
distorted perspectives.
</P>
<P>
Based on that opinion, the government hopes to welcome Chinese
people to Taiwan so that they can view the country with their own
eyes and change their "distorted" viewpoints about Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Wu said he told Trotha and Landwehr that Taiwan plans to allow
entry of 1,000 Chinese tourists per day for stays of up to 10
days -- making it possible that about 10,000 Chinese tourists
will be in Taiwan on any given day.
</P>
<P>
He said that although Taiwan is capable of accommodating more
than 10,000 Chinese tourists per day, the decided number of
10,000 is a "good amount" for the time being.
</P>
<P>
It is envisaged that after six months or a year of the program's
implementation, Taiwan might consider opening wider its doors to
Chinese tourists should no seriously undesirable things happen,
Wu said.
</P>
<P>
On the issue of direct cross-strait charter flight services, Wu
said that Taiwan and China reached consensus last June on
exchanging charter flights for special holidays and emergency,
humanitarian and medical purposes.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan hopes that China will allow cargo charter flights and more
passenger charter flights to ply the route with the opening of
more points of destination, Wu added.
</P>
<P>
He said Beijing has so far refused to allow special direct cross-
strait charter flights to take routes passing Okinawan or South
Korean flight information zones. Taiwan, nevertheless, will
continue to make efforts in this regard, he said.
</P>
<P>
Trotha and Landwehr arrived in Taipei Feb. 28 and are scheduled
to leave Friday. Landwehr, who has been working in Beijing for
the past 13 years, came to Taiwan in July 1995 to interview
President Chen Shui-bian when Chen was still Taipei mayor.
