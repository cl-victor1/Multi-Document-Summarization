CABINET TO UNVEIL INVESTIGATIVE REPORT ON NCC TRANSGRESSIONS
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  April  2 (CNA) 04/02/07  13:26:22 (By Sofia Wu)

<P>
The Executive Yuan will soon unveil an investigative report on
legal infractions or transgressions by commissioners of the
controversial National Communications Commission (NCC), an
official said Monday.
</P>
<P>
According to the official who preferred anonymity, the Executive
Yuan formed a special task force in mid-February to investigate
whether the NCC was guilty of dereliction of duty or in violation
of any laws in reaching an out-of-court settlement late last year
with Broadcasting Corp. of China (BCC) over a 2004 decision by
the Government Information Office to reclaim two BCC-controlled
radio channels.
</P>
<P>
The task force was headed  by Minister-with-Portfolio  Hsu Chih-
hsiung. After more than a month of intensive probes, the official
said, the task force has come up with a comprehensive
investigative report that identifies 10 transgressions involving
various NCC members.
</P>
<P>
Noting that revoking the BCC control of the two radio channels is
the government's established policy, the official said the NCC is
not authorized to override the Executive Yuan's decision by
settling the issue with BCC out of court.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the official said the task force discovered other
transgressions, including three commissioners  illegally taking
part-time jobs and one other commissioner having his son serve as
his officially paid chauffeur.
</P>
<P>
The report also pointed out that two commissioners were present
at meetings screening  ownership  transfers  of two opposition
Kuomintang-owned media outlets -- China Television Co. and BCC --
in violation of the principle of avoiding conflicts of interest.
The two commissioners have ties with the two KMT-held media
organizations.
</P>
<P>
Claiming that all of these transgressions are very serious
violations of existing laws and ethical rules, the official said
the task force has recommended penalties for law-breaking
commissioners, including suspending them from their jobs or
referring the cases to the Commission on the Disciplinary
Sanctions of Functionaries or the Control Yuan for censure and
discipline.
</P>
<P>
Some of the more serious cases may be referred to judicial
authorities to determine whether the commissioners in question
have violated existing laws against graft and corruption, the
official added.
</P>
<P>
The planned release of the NCC transgressions report comes at a
time when the media regulatory body has been under fire for its
decision last Friday to fine two cable TV channels -- TVBS and
TVBS-N -- and demand the resignation of the TVBS president over
the mishandling and broadcasting of a gangster's video, with some
arguing the punishment was not harsh enough and others
criticizing the commission for "crossing the line."
</P>
<P>
The Executive  Yuan  official  said the timing  is purely
coincidental as the task force began the probes into the NCC
legal transgressions long before the outbreak of the recent
"gangster's footage" controversy.
</P>
<P>
The NCC was created last year, with commissioners recommended by
major political parties in proportion to the number of seats the
parties hold in the Legislative Yuan. Such a partisan-based
formation has been declared unconstitutional by the Council of
Grand Justices, which has set Dec. 31, 2008 as deadline for
disbanding the body. The NCC commissioners already determined to
step down when the tenure of the current legislators expires Jan.
31, 2008.
