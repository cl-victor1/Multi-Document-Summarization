</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  April  2 (CNA) 04/02/07  14:52:47 (By Deborah Kuo)

<P>
A ruling Democratic Progressive Party legislator demanded Monday
that Defense Minister Lee Jye "give the country an explanation"
over allegations of the widespread existence of sexual harassment
in the military.
</P>
<P>
Hsueh Ling accused Lee of "leadership failure" which she said has
allowed the problem of sexual harassment to continue in the
military, adding that this has in turn caused military discipline
"to go down the drain."
</P>
<P>
At a news conference that she called at the Legislative Yuan,
Hsueh said several female officers have raised complaints with
her about inappropriate behavior by Vice Adm. Chao Lien-ti,
including forcing female officers to kiss him during soirees of
military personnel and their partners.
</P>
<P>
Chao, currently the head of an electronic intelligence office
under the Ministry of National Defense (MND), was accused of
forcing several female subordinates to kiss him at gatherings
last December and February of this year.
</P>
<P>
Chao was also accused in unsigned complaint letters of abusing
his power by using three cars along with three chauffeurs at the
MND's expense. One of the cars was reportedly used exclusively to
serve his wife, Hsueh quoted a front- page China Times report as
saying.
</P>
<P>
Noting that female members of the military have long suffered
sexist remarks and offensive behavior, Hsueh said the military
should be an equal-opportunity workplace, adding that she does
not exclude the possibility of disclosing more cases of similar
sexual harassment in the military  if the MND fails to tackle the
Chao case appropriately.
</P>
<P>
Responding to Hsueh's accusation, Deputy Defense Minister Chu
Kai-sheng confirmed that Chao has already been transferred and
that investigations have begun into Chao's alleged inappropriate
behavior and abuse of his position.
