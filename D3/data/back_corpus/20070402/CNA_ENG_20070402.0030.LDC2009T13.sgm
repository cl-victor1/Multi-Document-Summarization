DPP CHIEF BLASTS EX-KMT HEAD FOR SEEKING PRESIDENCY AMID
INDICTMENT
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  April 2 (CNA) 04/02/07  19:54:28 (By Flor Wang)
</P>
<P>
Ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) Chairman Yu Shyi-kun
criticized Monday former Kuomintang (KMT) chief Ma Ying-jeou as a
"hypocrite" and said that a political figure so lacking in
integrity falls far short of the requirements of the presidency.
</P>
<P>
Yu made the remarks to reporters after Ma said a day earlier that
he is resolved to take part in the 2008 presidential election
even if he is convicted in the first trial of corruption charges
over allegedly embezzling NT$11 million from a special municipal
monthly allowance fund earmarked for his discretionary use when
he served as mayor of Taipei from 1998-2006.
</P>
<P>
Pointing out that Ma has always been harsh in demanding that DPP
figures behave themselves, Yu accused Ma of lacking self-
reflection and called him an "unclean hypocrite" that does not
deserve to become Taiwan's president.
</P>
<P>
Ma's embezzlement trial will begin Tuesday in the Taipei District
Court.
</P>
<P>
Speaking during an interview  with the Taipei-based  China
Television Company Monday, Ma said that his remarks concerning
his determination to participate in the upcoming presidential
election were made clear Feb. 13, shortly after he was indicted
over embezzlement charges earlier that same day.
</P>
<P>
Ma also suggested that some 6,500 government agency chiefs and
department heads might soon find themselves mired in the same
situation in the near future.
</P>
<P>
Ma, the KMT aspirant thought most likely able to beat his DPP
rival, stepped down from the KMT's top post Feb. 13 and
immediately announced the opening of his presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
According to Ma, despite the corruption charges, many KMT members
still want him to represent the party in the next presidential
election on the grounds that the KMT's rules are much stricter
than Republic of China law, which views the indicted as not
guilty before a final conviction on the third trial.
</P>
<P>
Although KMT regulations exclude indicted members from running in
any elections, Ma said that the purpose of the party's "exclusion
rules" are "somehow different" in nature from the reason for his
embezzlement charges.
</P>
<P>
"We will not hopelessly wait for death while our rivals are doing
everything possible to destroy us," Ma claimed.
</P>
<P>
But Ma stressed that the KMT's intention to modify its "exclusion
regulations" at this time is "very inappropriate" if it were out
of an effort to secure his chances of running in the next
presidential race.
</P>
<P>
The proposed regulation revision must be made with a broader
vision to make it a general rule that could bail out many
incumbent or retired government officials who might find
themselves in similar legal trouble  due to their special
allowances  or government subsidies, he opined.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the KMT's legislative caucus displayed its full
support for Ma's presidential bid despite his corruption charges,
with caucus members questioning why DPP heavyweights --  Vice
President Annette, Premier Su Tseng-chang, former premiers Frank
Hsieh and Yu -- haven't been probed for their use of special
discretionary accounts.
</P>
<P>
Ma must take part in the 2008 presidential election in the face
of such a government and the investigation and judicial system,
they said.
</P>
<P>
Echoing KMT lawmakers' views, their People First Party (PFP)
counterparts said that they also back Ma to run in the next
presidential race, as "Ma remains the most suitable hopeful" for
the KMT-PFP alliance that was formally set up in January.
</P>
<P>
Tseng Tsahn-deng, legislative caucus whip of the opposition
Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU), however, lashed out at Ma for what
he called  "Ma's intention  to deceive  voters through  political
mobilization."
</P>
<P>
If Ma insists on running in the coming presidential race while
still on trial, it will be obvious that the ex-KMT chairman is
seeking to evade prosecution through vying for presidency, Tseng
said.
</P>
<P>
A political leader in a modern society must not harbor such a
mindset attempting to blur the lines between politics and the
judiciary, he contended.
