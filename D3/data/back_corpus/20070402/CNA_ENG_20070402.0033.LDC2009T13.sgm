KMT LEGISLATOR COMPLAINS OF UNFAIR COMPETITION IN PARTY PRIMARY
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  April 2 (CNA) 04/02/07  20:57:59 (By Han Nai-kuo)
</P>
<P>
A lawmaker of the opposition Kuomintang (KMT) confirmed Tuesday
that she will not seek the KMT's nomination for the year-end
legislative election because she believes she would never have
the opportunity to fairly compete in the party primary.
</P>
<P>
KMT Legislator Joanna Lei told reporters that a comrade who may
become her rival in a same district at the party primary has
threatened to do everything to cause her to fall into disgrace.
</P>
<P>
Lei said she had filed a complaint with the KMT authorities
concerning the threats but received no response.
</P>
<P>
KMT authorities also turned a blind eye to her warning that party
primaries in some districts could be affected by "nominal
members" recruited by certain politicians with the specific
purpose of helping them win primary elections, Lei continued.
</P>
<P>
According to Lei, after exhausting all possible avenues, she has
come to the conclusion that she could never get a level playing
field in the party primary.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, Lei said, she has decided not to join the primary to
seek the party's nomination for the year-end election, but will
instead concentrate on doing a good job during the remaining 10
months of her current term as a legislator.
</P>
<P>
Lei stressed that she will neither register as a candidate in any
other district, nor compete with other KMT members for a seat in
the legislature as one of the party's legislators-at-large.
</P>
<P>
Pressed  on the reason  for her decision,  Lei said  KMT
Secretary-General Wu Den-yih has made it clear that legislators
of the New Party (NP) who joined the KMT in 2004 will not be
permitted to seek the party's appointment as a legislator-at-
large.
</P>
<P>
Lei and two other NP lawmakers joined the KMT in October 2004
shortly before the last legislative election. The trio kept dual
party membership until August 2005 when they formally
relinquished their NP memberships.
