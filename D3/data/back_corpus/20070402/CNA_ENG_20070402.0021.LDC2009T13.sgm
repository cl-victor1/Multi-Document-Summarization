A resident of the Taiwan-held outlying island of Kinmen and two
of his brothers- in-law from China were nabbed early Monday
morning for illegally entering into Republic of China territory,
officials from Coast Guard Administration (CGA) Kinmen station
said Monday.

<P>
Yeh Chien-lung, 31, a resident of Kinmen's Chinhu rural township,
was monitored by a CGA radar while accompanying two Chinese men
-- identified as Liu Zhengshun, 27 and Liu Zhengyong, 24, who are
Yeh's brothers-in-law from the southern Chinese province of Hunan
-- in an attempt to sneak into Kinmen aboard a Fujian fishing
boat at 1: 56 a.m. Monday.

The three men -- apprehended for attempting to land on a beach in
Liehyu, a small island to the west of Kinmen, without entrance
papers -- were handed over to the Kinmen District Prosecutor's
Office for questioning, CGA officials said.

<P>
According to Yeh, he traveled to Xiamen City in Fujian Province
two days ago to meet with the Liu brothers before the three set
off from Xiamen for Kinmen Sunday night aboard a Fujian fishing
boat with the idea that the Liu brothers could visit Kinmen and
enjoy a leisurely tour after visiting Yeh's wife -- their sister
-- and the Yehs' new born baby.
</P>
<P>
Due to difficulties in applying travel documents to Kinmen, the
Liu brothers decided to travel illegally -- each paying 10,000
Chinese yuan to the Fujian fishing boat owner for a sail from
Xiamen to Kinmen. Yeh himself also paid 2,000 yuan for
accompanying the Liu brothers on the trip, according to Yeh.

Lee Nien-chiao, head of the CGA Kinmen operation, said the Kinmen
coast guard forces have stepped up patrol and surveillance
efforts recently as Kinmen has entered a foggy season, which
provides smugglers with golden opportunities to operate unseen.
