TVBS CHIEF STEPS DOWN AMID OUTCRY OVER STAGED GANGSTER VIDEO

Taipei,  April 2 (CNA) 04/02/07  16:48:18 (By Maubo Chang)

TVBS General Manager Lee Tao quit Monday, two days after the
National Communications Commission (NCC) ordered him to step down
over TVBS' broadcasting of a staged video on March 26.
</P>
<P>
In a brief statement, Lee said he regrets deeply and feels sorry
for failing to find out in time that a taped death threat
purported to have been sent to TVBS by a wanted gangster was
actually made by a TVBS reporter.
</P>
<P>
Noting that TVBS crew members are all excellent journalists, Lee
appealed to the public to give them a second chance to mend their
ways and prove their great abilities.
</P>
<P>
The outspoken critic of President Chen Shui also said he hopes
his resignation will calm down those politicians offended by TVBS
in the past and stop them from further trying "to wipe out TVBS."
</P>
<P>
The controversial  tape in which a gun-flaunting  gangster
threatens to kill another mobster in a personal feud caused a
public outcry.
</P>
<P>
Although the gangster was nabbed by police on March 29 before he
could carry out his threat, the controversy didn't die down
because the police found the tape was shot with the help of a
TVBS reporter.
</P>
<P>
Although the TVBS management argued that the reporter pulled the
wool over their eyes by falsely claiming that the tape had been
made by the gangster and sent to him, the public, not to mention
politicians from President Chen on down who had been criticised
by TVBS, have jumped at the chance to push the NCC to revoke the
TV station's operating license.
</P>
<P>
The NCC, which has been criticized by these politicians as being
too lenient in imposing a "paltry" NT$1 million (US$30,211) fine
on TVBS, was challenged by TVBS supporters for ordering the
replacement of Lee Tao, claiming that the NCC has exceeded its
authority by interfering with the governance of a private
company.
</P>
<P>
Lee's decision to quit on his own Monday obviously will spare NCC
the trouble of finding a legal basis for its decision to force
him to step down, although it has yet to convince TVBS critics
that the punishment is the most the commission can hand down
within its authority.
