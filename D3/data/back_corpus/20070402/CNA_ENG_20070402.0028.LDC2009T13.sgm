The mini thoracoscope has been used in clinical treatment of
pneumothorax since 2001 and has helped reduce the relapse rate
from 8 percent to 2 percent, sources at National Taiwan
University Hospital said Monday.

Chen Jin-shing, an expert on thoracoscopic surgery in the NTUH's
Department of Surgery, explained that the hospital began using
the mini thoracoscope because it allows for minimally invasive
surgery, adding that the hospital's staff have refined the
operation process by using a new adhesive to reduce the chance of
relapse.

Conventionally, talcum powder is used to create an adhesive
effect in the surgical process, he noted. But the hospital staff
came up with the idea of replacing talcum powder with the
antibiotic "Minocycline, " which proved to be even more effective
while also facilitating recovery. The cost of the new method is
also much lower than the conventional method, he added.

<P>
According to Chen, some 250 patients have been treated with the
new method at NTUH, and most of them were released within four
days after undergoing surgery.
