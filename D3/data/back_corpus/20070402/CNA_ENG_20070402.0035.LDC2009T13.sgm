NON-TAIWAN BORN PRESIDENT LIKELY IN 2008: EX-KMT CHAIRMAN
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  April 2 (CNA) 04/02/07  21:41:04 (By Flor Wang)

A non-native born president is very likely to be produced in the
2008 Taiwanese presidential election as more and more natives
have forsworn notions of ethnic identity, former main opposition
Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Ma Ying-jeou said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Ma made the comments in an exclusive interview on a program of
the Taipei-based China Television Co.
</P>
<P>
Ma, the son of a mainlander who relocated to Taiwan with the KMT
regime in the late 1940s after the KMT lost control of the
Chinese mainland in a civil war, said that he does not believe
that his background as a second-generation mainlander in Taiwan
would hinder his presidential bid.
</P>
<P>
"I don't think that being a mainlander's descendant will hobble
my aspiration to become a president now that a growing number of
Taiwanese people are not paying attention to the ethnic
background of presidential candidates," he said.
</P>
<P>
According to Ma, his running in the next presidential election
would serve as a test as whether or not Taiwan society has really
left ethnic disputes behind.
</P>
<P>
"I have confidence in Taiwan's people, and the country would have
no future if it could not walk away from the shadow cast by the
ethnic rift," he said.
</P>
<P>
Ma, the hopeful most likely to represent the KMT in the next
presidential contest, stressed that he will first ask Legislative
Yuan speaker Wang Jin-pyng, a KMT stalwart, to join him on the
ticket if he wins the party's nomination.
</P>
<P>
Although Ma was unsure whether Wang would accept his invitation
to be his running mate, Ma said that he is very sure that the KMT
cannot afford a split in the next presidential race if it wants
to win back power.
</P>
<P>
Should he be elected president, Ma said he will focus his efforts
on improving Taiwan's economy and relaxing restrictions on
Taiwanese companies' China-bound investments, and on bolstering
cross-Taiwan Strait economic exchanges.
</P>
<P>
Ma resigned from the KMT chairmanship and formally proclaimed his
presidential ambitions Feb. 13, shortly after he was indicted on
corruption charges earlier that same day by Taipei prosecutors
over an alleged misuse of a special municipal monthly allowance
designated for his discretionary use when he served as mayor of
Taipei from 1998-2006.
</P>
<P>
Ma's trial for allegedly embezzling those funds will begin in the
Taipei District Court Tuesday.
