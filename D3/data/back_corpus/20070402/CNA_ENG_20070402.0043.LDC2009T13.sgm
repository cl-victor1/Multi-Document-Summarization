The Ministry of Education (MOE) will earmark NT$80 million(US$2.4
million) this year for a project to subsidize 1,000 local
elementary and junior high schools, MOE officials said Monday.

<P>
The announcement came after Minister of Education Tu Cheng-sheng
kicked off the project with a press conference held at an
elementary school in Pingtung county, southern Taiwan.

<P>
The project is part of the MOE's efforts to promote physical and
art education at schools in remote areas, according to the
officials.

<P>
Tu said that last year, the ministry subsidized 800 elementary
and junior high schools in remote areas to purchase books, as
well as equipment for physical and musical education.

<P>
This year, the education ministry has increased the number of
schools to 1,000, and will provide additional budget support to
these schools for the purchase of books, Tu added.

The 1,000 schools were selected from 15 out of 25 cities and
counties, the minister said, adding that each school will receive
an average subsidy of NT$80,000.

The project highlights the importance that the ministry attaches
to the students' physical and artistic education, Tu said,
expressing hope that the schools will maximize their use of the
subsidy.
