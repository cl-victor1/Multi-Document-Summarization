President Chen Shui-bian said Monday that Taiwan will offer all
necessary assistance to its South Pacific ally of the Solomon
Islands which was rattled by a tsunami unleashed by a massive
undersea earthquake earlier in the day.

Chen said he has directed Taiwan's embassy in that country to
convey sympathy and concern, and to express Taiwan's willingness
to assist in post-disaster relief and rehabilitation.

Foreign wire service reports said that a magnitude-8 earthquake
struck between the islands  of Bougainville  and New Georgia,
unleashing a tsunami that pounded the western Solomon Islands on
Monday, destroying entire villages and killing an estimated 15
people.

The reports quoted witnesses as saying that the wall of water
triggered by the 8.0-magnitude quake was up to five meters high,
and that it swamped towns, flattened homes, and sparked panic
among residents of the South Pacific state.

Solomon Islands deputy police commissioner Peter Marshall said a
plane would fly over the devastated area later Monday to assess
damage, the reports said.

Meanwhile, Solomon Islands Prime Minister Manasseh Sogavare was
quoted as having said Monday that his government was dispatching
tents, food and water to victims of the tsunami-devastated west
of the country.

"I would like to assure our people that as soon as the full
report on the extent of the destruction is known, cabinet will
decide on further assistance," Sogavare said in an address to the
nation.

A team of officials and members of the Red Cross were dispatched
to the western town of Munda to arrange assistance to the region,
where officials said at least 15 people had been killed, foreign
wire service reports said.
