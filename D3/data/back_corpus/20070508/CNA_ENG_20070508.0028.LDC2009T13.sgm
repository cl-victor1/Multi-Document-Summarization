The Ministry of Education released Tuesday a set of draft
guidelines for teachers to follow while disciplining students,
reminding teachers that they could be breaking the law by using
improper disciplinary methods, such as physical punishment.
</P>
<P>
The draft was drawn up in line with a December 2006 amendment to
the Education Basic Law that bans corporal punishment in schools.
</P>
<P>
According to the draft, all forms of physical punishment are
unlawful, including battery, caning, ordering students to slap
themselves or each other in the face, squat jump, half-squat,
kneel, frog leap, mimic duck-walking, lift water-filled buckets
over their shoulders and stand on one leg.
</P>
<P>
Other forms of unlawful punishment listed in the draft include
slander, public insult, intimidation and physical or mental
abuse.
</P>
<P>
It is also illegal for teachers to fine students or confiscate
students' belongings with the exception of dangerous and
contraband items, such as knives, guns, ammunition, chemicals,
poisons, drugs and obscene or violent publications, photos, video
taps, optical discs and cassettes as well as cigarettes, alcohol
and betel nut, according to the draft.
</P>
<P>
In addition,  teachers cannot conduct physical searches of
students or their personal belongings and lockers unless there is
evidence indicating the students are bringing contraband items to
school or are involved in activities that endanger public
security.
</P>
<P>
Teachers breaking these rules might not only be punished by being
subject to reprimand, demerit or dismissal, but might also be
subjected to criminal and civil liabilities, the draft states.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the draft outlines some methods that teachers can
adopt to discipline students, which include correcting students
verbally, adjusting their seats, requesting that they offer a
verbal apology or do a written reflection,  asking them to
complete unfinished work, forbidding them from taking part in
extra- curricular activities,  keeping them in schools for after-
school guidance programs  after  obtaining  parents'  consent,
and temporarily transferring them to other classes.
</P>
<P>
Other viable disciplinary methods the draft recommends include
that teachers ask students to sit quietly or stand up to perform
self-reflection, with the time spent standing not exceeding one
class period for each occasion and two hours per day.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Education is scheduled to hold six public
hearings around the country from May 10-25 to allow the public to
exchange opinions on the draft, ministry officials said.
