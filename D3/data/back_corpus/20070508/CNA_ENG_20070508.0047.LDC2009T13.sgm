NATURE OF 'SPECIAL FUND' FOCUS OF HEARING ON EX-TAIPEI MAYOR'S
CASE

Taipei, May 8 (CNA) 05/08/07  22:37:34 (By Lilian Wu)

<P>
The nature of a "special allowance fund" for senior officials'
discretionary use was the focus of debate in the third hearing at
the Taipei District Court Tuesday on a corruption case involving
former Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou.
</P>
<P>
Ma, a former chairman of the main opposition Kuomintang who was
recently nominated by the party to run in the 2008 presidential
election, claimed in court that the "special allowance fund" was
a "personal subsidy."
</P>
<P>
His lawyer also cited the views of the Ministry of Justice (MOJ)
in November 2006, which state that the "special allowance fund"
has been appropriated by the government for years and is in
nature a "practical subsidy" to back Ma's claim. If the
recipients overspend, the government will not give them extra
funds, but if the fund is unspent after being claimed with
receipts, the government will not ask for the unspent money to be
returned. Overscrutiny of the use of the fund was not the
original idea in creating the fund, according to the views.
</P>
<P>
The lawyer also asked the court to summon 14 witnesses, including
former Taipei Deputy Mayor King Pu-tseng, as well as cashiers
during Ma's stint in the Taipei city government, to shed light on
Ma's perception of the fund and testify that he did not take part
in the process of the reimbursement of the fund with receipts and
hence did not embezzle public funds as stated in the indictment
against him.
</P>
<P>
But Public Prosecutor Huang Huei-min said the Accounting Office
under the Executive Yuan should be in charge of the installation,
claiming and reimbursement of the fund, and that the Ministry of
Justice only provides views for reference, which might not count
as legal views.
</P>
<P>
Presiding Judge Tsai Shou-hsun ruled that the legal counselling
views of the Ministry of Justice, as well as Ma's interview with
a local cable station Sept. 7, 2006 and his response during a
question-and-answer session at the Taipei City Council will all
be valid evidence.
</P>
<P>
The court will hold its next hearing May 22.
</P>
<P>
The prosecution indicted Ma Feb. 13 for embezzling NT$11.17
million of public funds that went directly into Ma's bank
accounts during his two-term stint as Taipei mayor 1998-2006.
</P>
<P>
But the prosecution in Tainan, while probing a similar special
allowance fund for Tainan Mayor Hsu Tain-tsair, dropped the case,
ruling that the fund is in nature a "subsidy" for senior
officials.
</P>
<P>
For this reason, the Supreme Prosecutor's Office convened a
seminar on legal issues and election graft Tuesday, inviting
chief prosecutors and representatives from accounting and
auditing offices to express their views on the "special allowance
fund."
</P>
<P>
State Public Prosecutor-General Chen Tsung-ming said before the
seminar that it is hoped that a set of guidelines will be
produced via open discussion.
</P>
<P>
But the views of the participants were divergent and the only
thing they agreed upon was that probes into "special allowance
funds" should be determined on a case by case basis and it is not
appropriate to give a uniform interpretation.
</P>
<P>
The participants in the meeting decided that the court's right to
exercise its duty in each case should be respected and that it is
not appropriate for the chief prosecutors to make unified
guidelines. The evidence of each case is unique, they said,
adding that objective facts as well as subjective consciousness
will have to be weighed equally.
