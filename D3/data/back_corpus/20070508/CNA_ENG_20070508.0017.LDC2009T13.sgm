LABOR GROUP URGES EARLY ANNOUNCEMENT OF MINIMUM WAGE HIKE LEVEL
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,   May  8  (CNA) 05/08/07  15:51:44 (By Lilian Wu)
</P>
<P>
A labor organization called for the government Tuesday to
announce the level of the planned minimum wage hike and its
complementary measures as soon as possible so that the issue will
not turn into a focal point of wrestling and confrontation
between labor and management.
</P>
<P>
Shih Chao-hsien, chairman of the Taiwan Confederation of Trade
Unions (TCTU) , made the appeal one day after six major trade and
industrial organizations issued a joint statement requesting that
the government limit the increase to 5 percent and the hourly
wage to NT$82 (US$2.48).
</P>
<P>
The organization said that if the minimum wage is raised by 9
percent, 250,000 enterprises will be affected and the additional
expenses incurred will be at least NT$35 billion a year.
</P>
<P>
Shih said that labor groups are willing to make concessions and
accept a resolution on a minimum wage hike of between 7.5 percent
and 9.5 percent adopted at a screening committee meeting which
was recently convened by the Council of Labor Affairs (CLA) . The
minimum wage currently stands at NT$15,840 per month, while the
minimum hourly wage is NT$66.
</P>
<P>
Shih asked the trade and industrial organizations to take into
consideration the fact that the minimum wage has not been raised
for a decade.
</P>
<P>
If the trade and industrial groups take to the streets, even more
laborers will also engage in street protest, he said.
</P>
<P>
The government should take the initiative in handling the
differences on the minimum wage increase level between labor and
management, he urged.
</P>
<P>
The TCTU will also work with other labor groups and watch for
further action by the trade organizations, he said.
</P>
<P>
Lan Fu-liang, director of CLA's Department of Labor Standards,
responded by saying that the CLA has sent a proposal of a minimum
wage increase of between 7.5 percent and 9.5 percent and the
complementary measures to the Executive Yuan for a final
decision.
</P>
<P>
The complementary measures suggested by the CLA include an NT$10
hourly subsidy for workers at fast-food restaurants, shopping
malls, supermarkets and gas stations, as well as labor insurance
and job counselling for those who lose their jobs.
