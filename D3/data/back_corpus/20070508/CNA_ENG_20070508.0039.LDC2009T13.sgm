The Terracotta Army exhibition, one of the most popular
exhibitions in recent memory in the world, will be held at the
National Museum of History (NMH) in Taipei from May 12 - July 31,
organizers said Tuesday.

<P>
The "Terracotta Army of Qin Shi Huang Di" exhibition, which is
being held in Taiwan for the second time since 2000, will
showcase 116 of the more-than 8,000 terracotta warriors and other
articles discovered in the early 1970s in the tomb of Qin Shi
Huang, the first emperor of China, in the Chinese province of
Shaanxi.

Over1.65 million visitors visited the 2000 exhibition in Taipei
and Taichung to see some of what historians call the eighth
wonder of the world and what is listed by the United Nations as a
World Heritage site, said NMH Director Huang Yung-chuan.

<P>
While items displayed in the 2000 exhibition came mostly from Pit
One of the site, which houses a battle formation of over 6,000
warriors, the exhibits this year come from Pit Two, which was not
discovered until March 1999, Huang said.

<P>
The most valuable exhibits will be two colored terracotta
warriors and items such as a bronze crane and stone armor, Huang
said.

"The exhibition will be very helpful for those who want to know
more about Chinese culture of 2,200 years ago, " Huang said of
the exhibition, a collaboration between the NMH and China's
Shaanxi Bureau of Cultural Relics.
