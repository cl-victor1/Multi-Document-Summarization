Taipei, Feb. 23 (CNA) 02/23/07  20:43:26 (By Flor Wang)

The Kuomintang (KMT) is expected to elect a new chairman in the
middle of April to lead the party, KMT Acting Chairman Wu Po-
hsiung said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Wu expressed the hope that a new chairman can be elected by that
time and said that party unity is his top concern at this
juncture when the KMT is gearing up to choose its candidates for
December's legislative elections and to hold a primary to select
its candidate for the 2008 presidential election.
</P>
<P>
Asked by reporters whether he will vie for the post of KMT
chairman, to be elected in a direct vote by the party's members,
Wu said that he is not considering the matter right now, pointing
out that his top priority now is reinforcing party unity.
</P>
<P>
Wu, a KMT first vice chairman, has been serving as the acting
chairman in accordance with the party's regulations following Ma
Ying-jeou's resignation from the post Feb. 13 after Ma was
indicted on corruption charges earlier the same day for his
alleged misuse of a special municipal allowance fund during his
two terms as Taipei mayor from 1998 to 2006.
</P>
<P>
Ma also announced his presidential bid that same day, making him
a possible rival of Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng within
the party, who is also expected to announce soon his bid to seek
to represent the KMT in the next presidential election.
</P>
<P>
Wang made it clear later Saturday in southern Kaohsiung county
that he has no plans to run for the post of KMT chairman and
praised Wu as a good candidate for the party's chairmanship.
