GOV'T URGED TO PAY HEED TO GROWING CHINESE CURRENCY STASH IN
TAIWAN

Taipei,  Feb.  23 (CNA) 02/23/07  16:33:40 (By Sofia Wu)

<P>
The government should pay heed to the possible adverse impact on
the efficacy of its monetary policy of the growing Chinese
currency stash in Taiwan, an economist said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Hung Tsai-lung, a research fellow with the Taiwan Institute of
Economic Research, said local people may have amassed a total of
more than 100 billion Chinese yuan over the past several years.
</P>
<P>
The accumulation of Chinese currency in Taiwan can be attributed
to a combination of factors, including China's chronic trade
deficit with Taiwan and the inclination of Taiwan businesspeople
operating in China to bring home Chinese yuan, Hung said.
</P>
<P>
In March 2004, Taiwan's central bank began to allow each local
citizen to bring in up to 6,000 yuan per homecoming visit, and
the amount was raised to 20,000 yuan in October 2005. According
to an estimate by the Cabinet-level Mainland Affairs Council,
local people have made a total of more than 12 million visits to
China over the past three years.
</P>
<P>
"If each China-bound visitor brings home 6,000 yuan per visit,
then that would mean about 72 billion yuan has been brought into
the country over the past three years, " Hung said, adding that
the total domestic yuan stash probably exceeds 100 billion if the
Chinese currency brought in before 2004, including earnings from
illegal trade deals between fishing boats from the two sides of
the Taiwan Strait, is taken into account.
</P>
<P>
As Taiwan may soon fully open its doors to Chinese tourists, Hung
said, the domestic Chinese yuan stash may increase further.
Noting that Chinese yuan still cannot be converted into local
currency freely, Hung said the government should not ignore the
possible negative effects of the yuan hoarding in Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
"Money laundering and banknote counterfeiting that could arise
from the influx of yuan onto the black market may only be trivial
matters compared with a possible resulting strain on the domestic
currency circulation due to financial authorities' inability to
get real-time monetary market information," Hung said.
</P>
<P>
Worse still, Hung said,  the current ban on Chinese yuan
conversion would hobble Taiwanese businesspeople's funding
operations and consequently discourage them from remitting their
earnings back to Taiwan from China.
</P>
<P>
Hung suggested that the government step up efforts to sign a
cross-strait agreement on the establishment of a cash settlement
mechanism. If such a mechanism cannot be formulated in the near
future, he said, Taiwan should unilaterally open free Chinese
yuan conversion through selected banking institutions.
</P>
<P>
"By so doing, we'll be able to properly resolve the issues
arising from rapid accumulation of the Chinese currency in
Taiwan, " he added.
