Washington, Feb. 22 (CNA) 02/23/07  18:15:30 (By Chiehyu Lin

A former U.S. official urged Washington Thursday to acquaint
itself well with the history of the 228 Incident of 1947 in
Taiwan, saying he believes that doing so will be helpful for the
U.S. government in forming its Taiwan policy.
</P>
<P>
Randy Schriver, former deputy assistant secretary of state for
East Asian and Pacific affairs responsible for China, Taiwan,
Mongolia and Hong Kong, made the call at a workshop on the 228
Incident. The workshop was co-organized by the Brookings
Institution, a prestigious  think  tank  in the  U.S.  capital,
and the Washington-headquartered Formosan Association for Public
Affairs (FAPA).
</P>
<P>
Schriver and Peng Ming-min, a renowned Taiwanese scholar on
international law and one of the leaders of Taiwan's independence
movement, were invited to attend the workshop hosted by Richard
C. Bush, director of foreign policy studies at the Brookings
Institution and former chairman of the American Institute in
Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Schriver said that the 228 Incident has profoundly affected
Taiwan's political and cultural development,  suggesting  that
policymakers in Washington study the history of the incident
which led to the deaths of around 30,000 people.
</P>
<P>
The 228 Incident was sparked by a skirmish on Feb. 28, 1947, in
which Monopoly Bureau officials who tried to confiscate smuggled
cigarettes in Taipei caused injury to a woman vendor and the
death of an innocent bystander, prompting mass demonstrations and
clashes all over Taiwan between locals and mainland  Chinese.
Nationalist government troops moved into Taiwan March 8 and began
a brutal crackdown.
</P>
<P>
Schriver said he believes the fact that the U.S. government has
never really understood how important the historic event is to
Taiwan has affected the judgment of its policymakers on the
Taiwan issue.
</P>
<P>
Making efforts to learn about the tragic event will help the
United States in evaluating the political situation in Taiwan and
mapping out its Taiwan policy, he said.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. will be able to better understand the historic meaning
behind the current "name rectification" movement promoted by
Taiwan's ruling Democratic Progressive Party, Schriver said,
adding that he supports the move to declassify the documents
concerning the 228 Incident, which have been kept confidential
for more than half a century. He added the family members of
victims of the 228 Incident have the right of access to
information concerning the death of their loved ones.
