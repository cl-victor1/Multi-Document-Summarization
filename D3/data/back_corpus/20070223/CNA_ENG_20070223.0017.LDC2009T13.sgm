With scores of attractive specialities, facilities and a fun
nightlife in Taichung City, Chinese tourists are sure to be
attracted to the central Taiwan city and give the local economy a
boost, a tourism operator said Friday.

The tourism operator made the remarks in response to the recent
claim by Joseph Wu, chairman of the Cabinet-level Mainland
Affairs Council, that the planned full opening of Taiwan to
Chinese tourists is an established policy of the government.

Although Taichung City is short of natural scenic spots, the
city's special delicacies, colorful nightlife, department stores,
shopping malls, pubs, gourmet restaurants,  and many five-star
restaurants, as well as the National Museum of Natural Science
and the National Taiwan Museum of Fine Arts are sure to please
Chinese tourists who stopover in the city en route to two must-
see natural scenic spots, namely Mount Ali in southern Chiayi
County and Sun Moon Lake in central Nantou County, the tourism
operator said.
