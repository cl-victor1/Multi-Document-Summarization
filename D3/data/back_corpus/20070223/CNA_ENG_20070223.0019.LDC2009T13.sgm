Taipei,  Feb. 23 (CNA) 02/23/07  20:25:15 (By Lillian Wu)

President Chen Shui-bian said Friday that it is a positive thing
that many within the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)
are keen on bidding to represent the party in the next
presidential election.
</P>
<P>
The president made the remarks after visiting the tomb of Huang
Hsin-chieh in Taipei County's Pali township to pay his respects
to the late chairman of the DPP, whom he said was his life-long
mentor who led him along the path into politics. Accompanying
Chen on the visit was Vice President Annette Lu.

<P>
DPP Chairman Yu Shyi-kun announced his bid Thursday to run in the
party's primary for the 2008 presidential election, becoming the
second DPP heavyweight to do so. Former Premier Frank Hsieh was
the first to throw his hat in the ring, announcing last Friday
that he would run in the party's primary next month.
</P>
<P>
The two other DPP heavyweights -- Vice President Lu and Premier
Su Tseng-chang -- have yet to make an announcement on whether
they will also run.
</P>
<P>
After visiting Huang's tomb Friday, Chen spoke of his own
experience to represent the party in the 2000 presidential
election.
</P>
<P>
"It's all about fate, " the president said, noting that before
2000, he had only thought about running for re-election as Taipei
mayor in 1998. Ma Ying-jeou defeated Chen in the mayoral election
that year and went on to serve as mayor for two terms before
stepping down in December 2006.
</P>
<P>
"If you're destined to get the post, then you'll be able to
overcome the major difficulties ahead, even if your chances may
look slim," Chen said.
</P>
<P>
He said he is gratified to see so many capable people within the
party keen to represent the party in the presidential election,
adding that "as long as there is competition, there is progress."
</P>
<P>
The president also said that he hopes for a "gentlemen's battle"
among the party's hopefuls in the primary.
