KMT SHOULD REDRAW LIST FOR CONTROL YUAN SEATS: DPP LAWMAKER
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taipei,  March  7 (CNA) 03/07/07  18:34:31 (By Lilian Wu)
</P>
<P>
A lawmaker of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)
criticized Wednesday the Control Yuan candidates recommended by
the main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) to fill the long-vacant
Control Yuan seats, describing most of them as unqualified for
the posts.
</P>
<P>
DPP Legislator Chen Chin-teh said that of the eight nominations,
only Nan Fang- shou, a noted political commentator and cultural
critic, is acceptable to the party and that the list is "the
worst ever."
</P>
<P>
He urged the KMT to draw up a new list of recommendations and
said the Presidential Office should reject the current list.
</P>
<P>
The Control Yuan, the nation's highest watchdog body, has been
idle since Jan. 31, 2005 when the terms of the previous Control
Yuan members expired. As the opposition-controlled Legislative
Yuan has refused to confirm President Chen Shui-bian's nominees,
the Control Yuan seats have been left unfilled for the past two
years.
</P>
<P>
The president agreed late last year to redraw the list of
nominees for the watchdog body and invited various political
parties to recommend qualified candidates.
</P>
<P>
In response to his call, a KMT task force finalized Tuesday the
eight-member list, including Nan, former Control Yuan members Yeh
Yao-peng, Ker Ming-mo, Chao Chang-ping and Lin Shih-chi, National
Chengchi University Professor Ma Hsiu-ju, National Taiwan
University Professor Ke Yung-kuang, and former Taipei City
Councilor Lin Shui-chi.
</P>
<P>
He described Yeh as "biased and having too distinctive a partisan
stripe, " Lin Shui-chi as "not up to the post" and Ke as having
once been a KMT worker. Ma is known only for her accounting
expertise, while Chao and Lin Shih-chi, although professional,
are too old for the posts, he said.
