GIO LODGES PROTEST WITH CNN, AP OVER RUDE WORDING ABOUT VP
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  March 7 (CNA) 03/07/07  19:12:18 (By Elizabeth Hsu)

<P>
The Government Information Office (GIO) lodged a protest through
its overseas offices at two U.S. press media outlets Wednesday
over their use of impolite language to describe Vice President
Annette Lu in their reports, according to GIO Minister Cheng Wen-
tsang.
</P>
<P>
The Cable News Network (CNN) reported on its Web site a day
earlier on Lu's ambition to become Taiwan's first female
president with a headline describing Lu as "scum of the nation, "
which it quoted from an earlier news story released by the
Associated Press (AP).
</P>
<P>
The report drew a strong protest from Lu soon after, who demanded
a formal apology from the international media outlet and said she
might demand damages.
</P>
<P>
Cheng described CNN and AP at a news conference at the Executive
Yuan as two highly professional media outlets in the
international community. However, some of their reporters have
appeared very "rude, boorish, impolite and indecent" while citing
sources in their news stories about Taiwan. That might be because
they have covered China for too long to have sufficient knowledge
of Taiwan's democracy and multi-cultural society, according to
Cheng.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the vice presidential office also sent a letter to AP
Wednesday to protest against the media outlet's adoption of
China's views of her after it delivered a similar protest to CNN
the previous day.
</P>
<P>
Lee Nan-yang, chief of the Presidential Office's Department of
Public Affairs, said Lu is the vice president elected by the
Taiwan people and serving her second term. Lu is also a renowned
fighter for freedom and human rights. He described AP's March 5
report on Lu's announcement of her bid for the presidency by
quoting Beijing's derogatory remark about her as an insult to the
Taiwan people. He also said the report violates the professional
press company's longstanding news reporting principles.
