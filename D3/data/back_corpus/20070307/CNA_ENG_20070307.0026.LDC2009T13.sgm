Executive Yuan spokesman Cheng Wen-tsang lashed out at Chinese
Foreign Minister Li Zhaoxing  Wednesday following rude remarks
made by Li the day before concerning President Chen Shui-bian,
saying that "rogue people use rogue language."
</P>

During an annual session of the Chinese National People's
Congress held in Beijing Tuesday, Li described Chen's recent
remarks about Taiwan's status and cross-Taiwan Strait relations
with disdain and described Chen as a "local official."
</P>
<P>
Li's remarks show that "rogue officials will only be found in
rogue countries," according to Cheng.
