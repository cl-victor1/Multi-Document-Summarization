The workers union of the China Steel Co. urged the government
Wednesday to assess carefully the possibly adverse impacts of a
planned name change on the company out of concern for the many
shareholders' and workers' interests and rights.
</P>
<P>
Workers union leader Wu Shun-tsai called on the government to
thoroughly study the pros and the cons of its name change plan
for the company, in which the government controls only a 22.6
percent stake of shares, a level even lower than the 33 percent
stake controlled by foreign investors.
</P>
<P>
Wu made the comments after leading China Steel workers to protest
at the office of the United Daily News, which reported that the
company's workers will not be overly concerned so long as the
proposed name change does not affect workers' salaries and
benefits.
</P>
<P>
Wu said that the government must prioritize investors' and
workers' interests and the company's international
competitiveness when it comes to the name change issue because
China Steel, listed on the Taiwan Stock Exchange, is not a
publicly-run business and it has as many as 600,000 retail
investors.
</P>
<P>
According to Wu, China Steel workers won't agree to a new name
driven by the government for the company due to their grave
concerns that such a move might in turn erode its competitive
edge.
</P>
<P>
The China Steel workers union insists that the company remain
free from political interference so as to maintain its long-term
image as a high-end enterprises, Wu said.
</P>
<P>
The name change proposed by the central government for China
Steel Co. came after three state-run enterprises changed their
names in line with a name rectification campaign rekindled by the
ruling Democratic Progressive Party.
