Taipei,   March  7  (CNA) 03/07/07  20:03:22 (By Flor Wang)

<P>
Several members of the "red-clad" protesters  who staged massive
rallies against President  Chen Shui-bian last year are planning
to sue Shih Ming-teh, former chairman of the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) who led them in the fruitless protests.
</P>
<P>
According to Chung Tien-hua and Chou Wei-kuang, two citizens who
claimed to be members of the "red-clad" protesters who
demonstrated in September and October in front of the
Presidential Office to depose Chen from the presidency over
several high-profile corruption scandals related to his family,
said that they have won endorsement from more than 200 "red-clad"
protesters for their cause.
</P>
<P>
Chung and Chou announced their intention to sue at a seminar
sponsored by Shih's anti-corruption campaign to discuss the case
of the special "state affairs fund, " in which first lady Wu Shu-
jen was indicted by Taipei prosecutors for her alleged role in
wrongful reimbursements from the fund with receipts or invoices
provided by her friends.
</P>
<P>
The two men said that they will file a lawsuit against Shih with
the Taipei Prosecutor's Office, charging fraud and breach of
trust when the number of people endorsing the move hits their
target number.
</P>
<P>
Expressing their dissatisfaction with Shih and displaying a roll
of the over 200 signatures that they collected, the pair accused
Shih of unilaterally deciding to shut down a "red-clad house"
near the Presidential Office and of calling them "homeless" or
"villains" who bossed around in the "red-clad house."
</P>
<P>
The anti-corruption street demonstrations led by Shih ended,
fruitless, late last year after the campaign collected some
NT$100 million (US$3 million) -- NT$100 for each from about 1
million "red-clad" protesters -- to finance their month-long
protests and other related activities.
