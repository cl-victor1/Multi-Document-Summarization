NEXT PRESIDENT URGED TO SUBSTANTIATE 'FOUR WANTS, ONE WITHOUT'
POLICY

Taipei,  March 7 (CNA) 03/07/07  21:47:22 (by Luis Huang)

<P>
The nation's next president should seek to substantiate the "four
wants and one without" policy proclaimed by President Chen Shui-
bian at a recent dinner party held in Taipei to celebrate the
25th founding anniversary of the Washington- based Formosan
Association for Public Affairs (FAPA) , Wang Hsien-chi, convener
of the 908 Taiwan Republic Campaign, said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The "four wants and one without" doctrine means that Taiwan wants
independence, rectification of its official designation, a new
constitution and further development, but Taiwan is not, and will
not be polarized into left or right wing factions, according to
the president.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a news conference, Wang recognized Chen's efforts to
promote the name-rectification campaign and his willingness to
put an end to the constitutional system of the Republic of China
by serving as the ROC's last president.
</P>
<P>
Wang claimed that although the ROC has a government, land and
people, it "lacks sovereignty," claiming that the ROC
"disappeared from the international community" when its seat in
the United Nations was given to the People's Republic of China in
1971.
</P>
<P>
Chen's "four wants and one without" is aimed at reminding all the
people of Taiwan that pursing de jure Taiwan independence is the
only way to survive for the people of Taiwan and that only by
enacting a new constitution and rectifying the name of Taiwan can
the goal of independence be achieved, Wang said.
