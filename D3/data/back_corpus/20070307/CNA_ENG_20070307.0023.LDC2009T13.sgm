PREMIER CONFIRMS 12-YEAR COMPULSORY EDUCATION SYSTEM
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  March 7 (CNA) 03/07/07  16:58:32 (By Deborah Kuo)

<P>
Premier Su Tseng-chang confirmed Wednesday that the country will
go ahead with the implementation of a 12-year compulsory
education system, a move he said should have been made 39 years
ago.
</P>
<P>
Su denied  that  the government's  push for the program's
implementation was an impulsive act, or that it was done as a
vote-getter in the next presidential election.
</P>
<P>
He said that from this year, the government will spend NT$40
billion over three years to pave the way for the implementation
of the program in 2009.
</P>
<P>
Su said it has been 39 years since the country implemented its
nine-year compulsory education system in 1968. Nowadays, he
added, 46 countries around the world implement a 10-year or
longer compulsory education system -- leaving ample room for
Taiwan to catch up.
</P>
<P>
Opinion  leaders began to promote the extended  compulsory
educational system in 1983, followed by a similar call made by
educators at a national conference in 1992 and similar consensus
reached during a national conference on economic sustainability
called by President Chen Shui-bian last year, Su said.
</P>
<P>
For the program's implementation, Su said, the Executive Yuan has
mapped  out meticulous  and comprehensive  plans on financing,
cross-agency operations and other measures, including 12 sub-
plans and 22 projects, with Minister-without- Portfolio Lin Wan-
yi appointed as head convener and the Ministry of Education
establishing a supervisory office and task forces to put the
program into force.
</P>
<P>
Noting that current tuition levels charged by most of the
privately run senior high schools are about four times higher
than those charged by public senior high schools, Su said that
from August this year, senior high school students from low-
income families will be subsidized to allow them equal
opportunities to go to school.
</P>
<P>
As to thornier issues involving the program, such as how students
will be admitted into senior high schools and concerns over
catchment areas and enrollment, Su said the government will spend
one year discussing and gathering opinions in order to make the
program better and more realistic.
</P>
<P>
Consequently, Su said, except for some contingency measures, the
modes of testing for most junior high schools and high school
entrance exams will remain unchanged before July 2009.
