LEGISLATIVE SPEAKER AVOIDS TALK OF TICKET WITH EX-KMT HEAD
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  May  1 (CNA) 05/01/07  21:41:27 (By Flor Wang)

Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng refused Tuesday to discuss
issues related to the proposed creation of a presidential  ticket
with former opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Ma Ying-jeou,
although the party is set to nominate Ma as its candidate for the
2008 presidential race.
</P>
<P>
Wang's refusal to comment came while answering questions from
reporters after it was reported that the KMT was to officially
field Ma as its presidential nominee Wednesday during the weekly
meeting of its decision-making Central Standing Committee (CSC).
</P>
<P>
According to local media reports, Ma's camp is seeking to build
"an ambiance to guard honor" for Wang in the hope that
cooperation between the two key men within the KMT will not grind
to a halt. As long as cooperation between the two is assured, a
Ma-Wang ticket remains feasible, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
Reiterating his earlier pledge that he will not touch on the Ma-
Wang ticket issue for the time being, Wang said he is in no hurry
to meet Ma and that relevant matters should be discussed only
after the KMT has held its national congress in late June.
</P>
<P>
"A CSC nomination does not mean that the KMT has gone through its
entire process unless Ma has won nomination in the national party
congress," Wang said.
</P>
<P>
Asked whether he would join Ma's presidential campaign team, Wang
said that as a KMT member, he will support Ma. But he was
reserved about the form his support will take, saying only that
"there are many ways to serve that end."
</P>
<P>
As for his recently leaked plan to visit China, Wang said that
certain individuals are attempting to spoil his plan and that he
now needs to further gauge the issue.
