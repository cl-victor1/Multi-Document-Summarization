LABOR CHIEF RESIGNS (UPDATE-2)

Taipei,  May 1 (CNA) 05/01/07  18:37:20 (By Maubo Chang)
</P>
<P>
Council for Labor Affairs (CLA) Chairman Lee Ying-yuan announced
his decision to resign from the Cabinet Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a hastily called news conference, Lee said he was
quitting because of the Cabinet's decision the day before to put
on hold a CLA plan to announce a raise in the minimum wage. He
was also concerned by Premier Su Tseng-chang's suggestion April
16 that former Premier Frank Hsieh is shrewd.
</P>
<P>
Lee stopped short of saying that he is quitting to give himself a
free hand to support Hsieh in his bid for the Democratic
Progressive Party's nomination to represent the party in the 2008
presidential election. The three other candidates bidding for the
nomination are Vice President Annette Lu, Premier Su Tseng-chang
and DPP Chairman Yu Shyi-kun.
</P>
<P>
The CLA has proposed raising the minimum wage by between 7.5
percent and 9.5 percent beginning July 1.
</P>
<P>
However, the premier decided in a meeting with DPP leaders Monday
night that the plan should be shelved for the time being on the
grounds that it may lend credibility to the accusation by the
other DPP presidential hopefuls that he is engaging in pork
barrel politics to woo voters in the primary.
</P>
<P>
In response to Lee's announcement, the premier said he would try
to dissuade Lee from leaving the Cabinet, and would allow him a
leave of absence to stump for his favored candidate in the
legislative or presidential elections.
</P>
<P>
The premier said he saw Lee's letter of resignation Tuesday
afternoon after he returned to his office from the legislature,
and has no idea whether Lee decided to quit because the Cabinet
failed to announce CLA's plan to raise minimum wages on May 1
Labor Day.
</P>
<P>
The premier suggested that there is actually no substantive
difference between himself and Lee over this issue, saying that
the minimum wage is set to be raised by July 1, but the CLA's
plan should be withheld from making public until complementary
measures that are yet to be crafted by other government agencies
are in place.
