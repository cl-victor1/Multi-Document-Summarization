MA TO MEET WITH LEGISLATIVE HEAD AFTER PRESIDENTIAL NOMINATION
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  May 1 (CNA) 05/01/07  16:59:01 (By Luis Huang)

Main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) former Chairman Ma Ying-jeou
said Tuesday that should he be nominated as the KMT presidential
candidate, he will call on Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng
to talk about the party's ticket for the 2008 presidential
election.
</P>
<P>
Ma, viewed as the opposition's best bet for the upcoming
presidential race, made the remarks during an interview with
reporters after attending a swearing- in ceremony for the newly
elected board chairman, directors and supervisors of the Taiwan
Civil Engineer Association.
</P>
<P>
The KMT Central Standing Committee is expected to give the green
light to Ma's candidacy Wednesday as he is the sole formally
registered KMT presidential hopeful for the party's nomination.
</P>
<P>
Asked whether he and Wang are likely to pair up to form the KMT's
ticket or he has another ideal running mate, Ma declined to give
a definite response, saying that his running mate will be
announced prior to a meeting of the KMT National Congress slated
for late June.
</P>
<P>
Wang,  a seasoned politician from southern Taiwan, and Ma Ying-
jou, a former KMT chairman who is popular in northern Taiwan,
have been widely seen as forming a complementary  ticket and
representing the party's best chance of winning back power in the
next presidential election, according to public opinion polls.
</P>
<P>
Ma's front runner status was cast into doubt after he was
indicted Feb. 13 for his alleged misuse of a "special allowance
fund" during his two terms as Taipei mayor between 1998 and 2006.
He resigned as KMT chairman hours after being indicted but at the
same time announced his firm determination to run in the next
presidential election.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Wang, who lost to Ma in a bitter party chairmanship
election in 2005, has reportedly  been keen on becoming the
standard-bearer for the party. However, he has yet to officially
announce his bid to run for the next presidency, saying "there is
no hurry to do so."
