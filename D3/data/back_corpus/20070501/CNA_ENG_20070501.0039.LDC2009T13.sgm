Taipei,  May 1 (CNA) 05/01/07  20:22:31 (By Y.F. Low)

<P>
The Environmental Protection Administration (EPA) will start a
nationwide trial run for household waste cooking oil recycling in
September, officials said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The measure will be part of the government's effort to increase
the sources of ingredients for the production of biodiesel,
according to Ho Shun-chin, director of the EPA's Department  of
Waste Management.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Economic Affairs has announced that starting July
2008, all diesel sold on the market will be a blend containing 1
percent of biodiesel to reduce the emissions of greenhouse gases.
</P>
<P>
Ho noted that waste cooking oil can be recycled to produce soap
and stearic acid, in addition to biodiesel.
</P>
<P>
A total of 6.66 metric tons of waste cooking oil were collected
in a trial run conducted in Chiayi County between May and
December 2006, accounting for 15 percent of the county's annual
waste cooking oil output, Ho said.
</P>
<P>
With the nation's waste cooking oil output estimated at 70,000
metric tons to 85,000 metric tons per year, the EPA expects to
collect 4,600 metric tons of waste cooking oil during the first
year of the nationwide trial run, Ho said.
</P>
<P>
Advising people to develop a habit of collecting waste cooking
oil for recycling, Ho said the EPA hopes to officially list waste
cooking oil as a recyclable item if the trial run turns out to be
successful.
