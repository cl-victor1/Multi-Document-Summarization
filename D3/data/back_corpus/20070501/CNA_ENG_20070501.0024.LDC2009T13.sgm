The Formosan blue magpie and the mikado pheasant have been short
listed as finalists in the quest to anoint a national Taiwanese
bird following the conclusion of a four-month-long online
referendum, organizers announced Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
A total of 1.1 million votes were cast between Jan. 1 and April
29 in the "Vote for Taiwan's National Bird" referendum, jointly
organized by the Taiwan Sustainable Ecology Society, the Taiwan
International Birding Association, Democratic Progressive Party
Legislators Tien Chiu-chin and Chen Hsien-chung, and independent
Legislator Yang Chung-tse.
</P>
<P>
The Formosan blue magpie and the mikado pheasant won 520,000
votes and 280,000 votes, respectively, defeating the other two
candidates, the yellow tit and the swinhoe's pheasant, according
to the organizers.
</P>
<P>
They said a signature campaign will begin in the Legislative Yuan
Wednesday to promote a final decision by legislators.
</P>
<P>
Tien said she and the other organizers came up with the idea of
holding a referendum after seeing that many countries have their
own national birds, such as the United States' bald eagle and
France's cockerel.
</P>
<P>
Using the image of its national bird, Taiwan will be able to
highlight  its unique  features  and achievements  in wildlife
conservation, Tien said.
</P>
<P>
Both the Formosan blue magpie and the mikado pheasant are endemic
to Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Formosan blue magpies, known locally as long-tailed mountain
ladies, are ferocious birds that often live together in small
groups and have been known to occasionally attack other flocks of
birds. They are often seen in broad-leaved and secondary forests
at low and mid-level altitudes up to 1,800 meters above sea
level.
</P>
<P>
Mikado pheasants, also called the "king of the mist, " live in
mountainous regions at altitudes of 2,000 to 3,200 meters above
sea level. Solitary, quiet and alert, mikado pheasants often walk
and forage for food on rainy and foggy days. An image of the bird
appears on Taiwan's NT$1,000 note.
