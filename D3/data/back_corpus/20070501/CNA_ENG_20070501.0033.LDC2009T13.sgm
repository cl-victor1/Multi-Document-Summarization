Taipei,  May  1 (CNA) 05/01/07  19:19:12 (By Lilian Wu)

A lawmaker from the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)
said Tuesday that in a bid to raise public awareness of the
problem of global warming, she has invited former U.S. Vice
President Al Gore to speak in Taiwan on the subject.
</P>
<P>
DPP Legislator Tien Chiu-chin said that following airing of the
Oscar-winning documentary "The Inconvenient Truth" last November,
she has taken the initiative to invite Gore to speak in Taiwan
and has received his preliminary consent.
</P>
<P>
The feature film documentary on the Earth's climate crisis was
presented by Gore to boost his campaign to find solutions to
global warming and other environmental problems.
</P>
<P>
Gore is expected to give one speech each in Taipei and Kaohsiung
between Sept. 13 and 20, she said. There will also be a summit
forum held at the Yushan National Park in central Taiwan, which
President Chen Shui-bian will be invited to attend.
</P>
<P>
She said that the price tag for a single speech by Gore will be
US$200,000. Including other expenses, the total bill will come to
around US$700,000,  which she said will be covered by public
donations.
</P>
<P>
The itinerary of Gore's trip will also be arranged in such a way
that it will produce the least possible carbon emissions and
there will be tree-planting activities to help offset carbon
emissions.
</P>
<P>
Faced with questions about the exorbitant price of inviting Gore,
she said that Gore's presence will enable the public to get in
touch with the problem of global warming, adding that the public
will develop a deeper understanding of the issue through
campaigning and education.
</P>
<P>
"The  follow-up  benefits  definitely  make  the investment
worthwhile," she said.
</P>
<P>
She also hopes to form a group of Gore's friends in Taiwan,
inviting  those who identify with the ideals of environmental
protection to join in, and to solicit donations of US$1 million
in one year.
