Nearly half of Taiwanese youngsters practice impulsebuying,
although over 70 percent of them agree that it is worthwhile to
think it over before making a decision, according to results of a
survey released Monday.

<P>
The survey, conducted by ACNeilson Taiwan Limited at the request
of Citibank Taiwan and Taiwan Women's Rescue Foundation, obtained
satisfactory answers from 1,742 high school students throughout
Taiwan between Sept. 18, 2006 and Jan. 19, 2007.

The results show that 45 percent  of youngsters  surveyed
acknowledged that they would buy on the spur of the moment. Of
the girls surveyed, 53 percent said they would purchase what they
like this way, compared to 34 percent of the boys who would do
the same.

<P>
The survey found that 84 percent of the young people believe that
they should be held responsible for their own behavior, and 90
percent said they understand that a person's bad credit history
will make it difficult to get bank loans in the future.
</P>
<P>
The study also found that an on-campus educational program on
personal financing could increase the number of students with
good knowledge of personal finance from 21 percent to 41 percent.
