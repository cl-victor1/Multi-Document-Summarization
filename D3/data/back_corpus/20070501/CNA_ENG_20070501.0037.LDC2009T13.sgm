Negotiations on the issue of allowing Chinese tourists to visit
Taiwan have been stalled because China has not decide on its own
position, Transportation and Communications Minister Tsai Tui
said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Negotiations previously conducted by Taiwan's Cross-Taiwan Strait
Tourism Development Association and China's Cross-Strait Travel
Exchange Association have reached a consensus on certain points,
but no agreements were concluded, Tsai said.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan's door on cross-strait tourism negotiations remains open,
Tsai said, adding that the negotiations may resume at any time so
long as China decides on its position on the issue.
</P>
<P>
Even the cross-strait forum held by Taiwan's opposition party
Kuomintang and China's Communist Party did not make any progress
on this issue, despite the eager expectations of travel agencies
on both sides.

<P>
Janice Lai, director-general of the Tourism Bureau, said that
both Taiwan and China have come to a stalemate as a result of
making this a political issue and thus increasing the difficulty
of arriving at an agreement.
