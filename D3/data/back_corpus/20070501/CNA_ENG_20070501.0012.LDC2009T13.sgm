LABOR CHIEF RESIGNS (UPDATE-1)

Taipei,  May 1 (CNA) 05/01/07  15:09:41 (By Maubo Chang)

<P>
Council for Labor Affairs (CLA) Chairman Lee Ying-yuan announced
his decision to resign from the Cabinet Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a hastily called news conference, Lee said he was
quitting because of the Cabinet's decision the day before to put
on hold a CLA plan to announce a raise in the minimum wage, as
well as because of Premier Su Tseng-chang's suggestion April 16
that former Premier Frank Hsieh is shrewd.
</P>
<P>
However, Lee stopped short of saying that he is quitting to give
himself a free hand to support Hsieh in his bid for the
Democratic Progressive Party's nomination to represent the party
in the 2008 presidential election. The three other candidates
bidding for the nomination are Vice President Annette Lu, Premier
Su Tseng-chang and DPP Chairman Yu Shyi-kun.
</P>
<P>
The CLA has proposed raising the minimum wage by between 7.5
percent and 9.5 percent from July 1.
</P>
<P>
However, the premier decided in a meeting with DPP leaders Monday
night that the plan should be shelved for the time being on the
grounds that it may lend credibility to the accusation by the
other DPP presidential hopefuls that he is engaging in pork
barrel politics to woo voters in the primary.
