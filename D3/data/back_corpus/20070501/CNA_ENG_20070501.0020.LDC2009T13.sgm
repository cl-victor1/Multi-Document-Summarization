</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  May 1 (CNA) 05/01/07  16:42:16 (By Lilian Wu)

<P>
President Chen Shui-bian expressed hope Tuesday that a labor
pension fund might soon be put to better use to yield higher
profits, and that the jobless rate for laborers would be cut to
below 3.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
The president made the remarks while receiving model laborers and
their dependents at the Presidential Office to mark the Labor
Day.
</P>
<P>
He noted that since a new portable labor pension system took
effect in July 1, 2005, nearly 4.3 million wage earners have
opted for the new pension system. Under the new system, employers
must deposit at least 6 percent of an employee's salary into
their pension account each month, which the employees can carry
with them whenever they change jobs. As of April 27, the
accumulated labor pension fund deposited at banks had reached
NT$160.6 billion (US$4.86 billion), he said.
</P>
<P>
But the president said that the Legislative Yuan had only passed
an organic law for the establishment of a new body to provide a
legal basis to manage and supervise the labor pension fund March
2.
</P>
<P>
The labor pension supervisory commission is expected to be
launched in August 1 and to begin investing at the end of the
year at the earliest, the president said.
</P>
<P>
He said that the investment return of the National Stabilization
Fund in the first quarter was 4 percent, and that the labor
pension fund should also achieve an annual 4 percent investment
return rate after the commission begins formal operations to
create a win-win situation for management and labor.
</P>
<P>
"The rights of the laborers cannot wait, and the earlier the
commission begins operations the better," the president said.
</P>
<P>
He lauded Taiwanese laborers as the prime mover of the nation's
economic development, saying that although Taiwan's economic
growth has slowed down in recent years due to global competition,
its enterprises have maintained a certain level of production
value and profit thanks to the efforts of the management as well
as the selfless devotion of the laborers.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Executive Yuan has decided to adjust the minimum
wage upwards between 7.5 percent and 9.5 percent, which will be
put into practice July 1. It is estimated that 1.72 million
laborers will benefit from the increase.
</P>
<P>
Faced with divergent views on the level of increase, he also said
that the Cabinet  will come to the best decision  based  on
consideration of the advantages and disadvantages of various
levels of adjustment.
</P>
<P>
The president recalled that in 2004, when he was re-elected as
president, he gave his words to cut jobless rate to 4 percent,
ban the importation of cheap Chinese labor to protect local
labor, and improve labor safety standards.
</P>
<P>
He said that he was gratified that "there have been initial
results and progress in all these areas."
</P>
<P>
The labor jobless rate was cut to below 4 percent last year, he
said. Noting that the jobless rate in the first quarter this year
was 3.9 percent, he expressed hope that the jobless rate for the
whole year will fall to below 3.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
On labor safety, the president also said he proposed measures
last year to cut the country's rates of occupational injury and
death by 30 percent within two years.
</P>
<P>
He cited statistics to show the progress made in this area,
saying that as of April 15, the rate of major occupational death
was 12.19 per million, which he said was lower than 13.31 percent
from the same period in 2004 and 2005.
