UNI Air, an affiliate of EVA Air -- one of Taiwan's leading
carriers -- launched a passenger service Tuesday, with one flight
per day on the route between Taiwan's southern port city of
Kaohsiung and Ho Chi Minh City in Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
UNI Air President Peter Chen and government officials in charge
of civil aviation affairs presided over an inaugural ceremony,
cutting a ribbon in front of a boarding gate at the Kaohsiung
International Airport.
</P>
<P>
More than 100 passengers on the inaugural flight each received a
model of the Boeing DC 90 -- the type of airplane used on the
route -- as a memento.
</P>
<P>
The daily service will increase UNI Air's passenger flights to
Vietnam to 10, as the airline already operates three flights per
week serving the Kaohsiung-Hanoi route.
</P>
<P>
Ho Chi Minh City, former called Saigon, is the largest city in
Vietnam, where Taiwan entrepreneurs have made more investments
than businessmen from any other country.
</P>
<P>
UNI Air decided to launch the new passenger service because an
increasing number of passengers need to travel between Taiwan and
Vietnam,  including Taiwan businessmen, Vietnamese laborers and
Vietnamese women married to Taiwanese men.
