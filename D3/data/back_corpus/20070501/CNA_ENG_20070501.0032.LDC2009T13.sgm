KMT LAWMAKERS SUE 102 CABINET MEMBERS OVER SPECIAL ALLOWANCE
FUNDS

Taipei,  May 1 (CNA) 05/01/07  19:09:20 (By Flor Wang)

<P>
A group of main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) lawmakers  Tuesday
initiated a lawsuit against 102 former and incumbent Cabinet
members with the Supreme Prosecutors Office, seeking a probe into
their alleged misuse of "special allowance funds" that have
become controversial since former KMT Chairman Ma Ying-jeou's
indictment in mid-February for the same reason.
</P>
<P>
KMT legislative caucus whip Hsu Shao-ping, who led the group of
the lawmakers in the action, said in a news conference that they
were forced to make the move because the prosecutors' office has
failed to launch an investigation into a similar case involving
four major figures of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) -- Vice President Annette Lu, Premier Su Tseng-chang,
former Premier Frank Hsieh and DPP Chairman Yu Shyi-kun.

<P>
Ma was indicted 195 days after a suit was lodged by DPP lawmakers
against him, but the prosecution has yet to indict the four DPP
figures 234 days after a similar lawsuit was filed against them,
Hsu said.
</P>
<P>
If prosecutors continue taking a hands-off attitude toward the
case implicating the 102 former and incumbent ranking government
officials, including the four DPP heavyweights, the KMT will make
the next move by suing a total of 6,500 local government chiefs
and state agency heads across the country to underscore
prosecutorial bias regarding similar cases, KMT lawmaker Kuo Su-
chun said.
</P>
<P>
The DPP has used every possible means to squeeze Ma out of the
next presidential election, including through political
prosecution, Kuo said, adding that the KMT will consider charging
the more than 6,000 chiefs to resolve the issue -- a matter
labeled by Su as a historical legacy due to a controversial
practice over the long term.
</P>
<P>
Ma stepped down from the KMT's top post after being indicted by
Taipei prosecutors over allegedly embezzling some NT$11 million
in funds from a special monthly municipal allowance designated
for his discretionary use while he served as mayor of Taipei from
1998-2006.
</P>
<P>
Ma proclaimed his desire to pursue presidency shortly after the
indictment was filed against him.
</P>
<P>
The Taipei District Court opened two hearings on Ma's case in
April, during which Ma maintained his innocence and defended
himself.
