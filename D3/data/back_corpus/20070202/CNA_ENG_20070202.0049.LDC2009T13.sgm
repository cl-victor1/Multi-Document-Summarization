Taiwan has four victories in the first two days of the Asia-
Oceania Women's Softball Olympic Qualifying Series, making it
almost certain that its national team will compete in the final
for the right to go to the 2008 Olympics in Beijing.

The qualifying series between six national teams -- North Korea,
South Korea, Singapore, New Zealand, the Philippines and Taiwan
-- is being played at the softball field in Tainan's Hoshunliao
Sports Park. The seven-day event will continue until Feb. 7.

On Thursday, Taiwan's team, known as "Chinese Taipei," defeated
New Zealand 10:3 in six innings and followed with another 12:2
victory over Singapore, ending the match after five innings.

In the second day of competition Friday, Chinese Taipei first
trounced South Korea 7:0 to end the match after five innings, and
then defeated North Korea 5:2.

runs and followed with another run in the sixth inning.
