WANTED REBAR FOUNDER LEAVES SINGAPORE FOR LOS ANGELES

Singapore,  Feb. 2 (CNA) 02/02/07  19:48:12 (By Charles Kang and

Wanted Rebar Asia Pacific Group founder Wang You-theng and his
wife were allowed to leave Singapore and head directly back to
Los Angeles Friday after they refused to fly via Taiwan, where
they face arrest for corruption and embezzlement.
</P>
<P>
The couple arrived at Singapore's Changi International Airport
earlier in the day on their way from Los Angeles to Myanmar and
immediately fell under close scrutiny from the Singapore
authorities, despite the absence of a judicial assistance accord
between Taiwan and Singapore.
</P>
<P>
Through intensive negotiations between the two sides,  the
Singapore immigration authorities originally agreed to facilitate
Wang's extradition by arranging for the couple to fly a
Singapore-Los Angeles flight that would include a stopover in
Taiwan so that they could be arrested by the Taiwan authorities.
</P>
<P>
However, the couple refused to cooperate and demanded to return
to the United States on a direct flight to Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
The officials said a Dominican Republic passport held by Wang had
been canceled by the Dominican Republic government at the request
of Taiwan and that he might have problems entering the United
States unless he has other passports.
</P>
<P>
However, as Wang's wife Wang Chin Shyh-ying holds a U.S. passport
and Wang reportedly has a U.S. green card, it is still possible
that the U.S. government might allow Wang to enter the country
based on "humanitarian reasons," the officials said.
</P>
<P>
They said Taiwan officials posted in Los Angeles will try to
negotiate with the United States authorities for the couple's
extradition to Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
The Taipei District Prosecutor's Office officially accused the
couple Jan. 12 of violating the Securities Transaction Act and
breach of trust over their role in a series of financial scandals
within the Rebar group.
</P>
<P>
The couple, who fled to China immediately before the scandals
broke and later flew to the United States, was put on a most
wanted list Jan. 15.
</P>
<P>
The scandals came to light early last month after the Rebar
group's China Rebar Co. and Chia Hsin Food and Synthetic Fiber
Co. applied for insolvency restructuring, triggering a run on the
Chinese Bank, another Rebar affiliate.
</P>
<P>
The Wangs allegedly embezzled billions of dollars in corporate
funds before going on the lam.
