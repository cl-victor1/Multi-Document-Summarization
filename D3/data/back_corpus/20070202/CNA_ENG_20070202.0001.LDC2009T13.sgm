Outgoing Army Commanding General Gen. Hu Cheng-pu will succeed
Kao Hua-chu as minister of the Cabinet-level Veterans Affairs

Thursday.

Cheng's announcement came after the Presidential Office unveiled
a partial military personnel reshuffle earlier in the day, in
which Hu will be relieved of the top army post after nearly a
one-year stint and will be transferred to serve as a strategy
adviser to the president.

Hu, 59, has worked his way up the army hierarchy and advanced
into position of commander with diligence and perseverance, Cheng
said, adding that Hu's new assignment was determined after
discussion between the Presidential Office and the Executive
Yuan.
