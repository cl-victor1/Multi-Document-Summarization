Department of Health officials said Friday that food and
agricultural products with false labeling will be destroyed and
the producers fined.

Chen Chih-lang,  an official from the DOH Bureau of Food
Sanitation, made the remarks at a press conference in which
ruling Democratic Progressive Party Legislator Lee Chen-nan
revealed that ten of so-called "organic" vegetable soup packs
available in markets carried fake certification describing it as
coming from Japan.

<P>
Several producers even claim their products can cure cancer, Lee
added.

<P>
In accordance with the Food Sanitation Management Act, food
labeling or advertising should not be false,  exaggerated  or
misleading and medical benefits cannot be claimed, Chen said.

<P>
Local government health authorities can order companies withdraw
illegal products or correct the labeling, Chen said, adding that
the products will be destroyed if the companies fail to do so.

Food labeling claiming medical effects could be fined between
NT$200,000 and NT$1 million, Chen went on.

Chen Chun-shih, an official from the Council of Agriculture's
(COA's) Agriculture and Food Agency, reminded the public that
currently there are only four certified organic product labels
recognized by the COA -- MOA, TOPA, TOAF and FOA -- and said the
agency will offer more information about these certified organic
products on their Web site.
