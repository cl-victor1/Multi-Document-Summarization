Some 290,500 square meters of land around factories and
construction sites, or an area equal to some 700 basketball
courts, has been turned into parkland around the country under a
government-initiated project to green inner cities and suburban
areas, the Environment Protection Administration (EPA) reported
Friday.
</P>
<P>
Since the greening project was launched in August 2006, 561
factories and construction sites have signed up to take part in
the project -- turning areas or environment in their vicinity
into park or green land -- as of the end of December, EPA
officials said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the 561 factories and construction sites have also
sponsored the clean-up and maintenance of 1,724 km of roads
around the country during the period, the officials said.

In related news, the Water Resources Agency said a river
conservation army was established Friday to act as guardians of
rivers.
</P>
<P>
A total of 229 people will be recruited to join the river
conservation army, with over a half of the total expected to be
indigenous  people,  Water Resources  Agency Commissioner  Chen
Shen-hsien said.
</P>
<P>
The 229 "river guardians" will be assigned to 12 aboriginal rural
townships to help protect upstream areas of rivers, Chen said.
</P>
<P>
While they will be working to protect the upstream areas from
being polluted during anti-flood periods, they are also expected
to be trained as tour guides, Chen noted.
