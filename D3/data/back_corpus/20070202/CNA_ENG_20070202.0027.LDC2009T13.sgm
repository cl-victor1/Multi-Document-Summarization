Yunlin  County, central  Taiwan  (CNA) 02/02/07  17:58:58 (By Han
Nai-kuo)

<P>
Law enforcement agents in Yunlin County seized 30 metric tons of
tainted pork believed to be from dead and diseased hogs during a
late night raid on five illegal slaughterhouses Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The agents arrested a suspect at one of the locations in
Yuanchang township and were still trying to catch the ringleader
and his accomplices who fled before the agents arrived.
</P>
<P>
The Public Prosecutor's Office in Yunlin County ordered the raid
after receiving tip-offs that the illegal ring was operating out
of a shack in a village in Yuanchang township.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the prosecutor's office said that in addition to
1,000 kg of hog carcasses that were being butchered in the shack,
law enforcement agents found 6,000 kg of frozen pork in a walk-in
freezer.
</P>
<P>
At four other locations, the agents seized more than 23,000 kg of
frozen pork -- believed to be from dead and sick hogs.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said the pork was apparently meant for the Luna New
Year holiday, when meat will be in big demand. The ring is
believed to have obtained dead and sick pigs at cheap prices from
hog farms, which should have destroyed the dead animals.
</P>
<P>
In accordance with the Waste Disposal Act, those who ignore
health concerns and sell questionable meat from sick and dead
hogs could be sentenced to a maximum of five years in prison.
