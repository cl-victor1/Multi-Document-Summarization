Singapore,  Feb.  2  (CNA) 02/02/07  14:14:42 (By Deborah Kuo)

Singaporean immigration authorities conceded Friday to Taiwan's
request for the extradition of Rebar Asia Pacific Group founder
Wang You-theng and his wife who arrived at the city-state's
airport earlier the same day on their way from Los Angeles to
Myanmar.
</P>
<P>
However, Wang and his wife refused to board the Singapore
Airlines flight SQ876 which was designated by the immigration
authorities and was slated to make a stopover in Taiwan's Taoyuan
International Airport on its way to Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
Instead, they demanded to return to the United States on a flight
direct to Los Angeles, according to the immigration authorities.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, immigration officials of Singapore, which
does not maintain ajudicial assistance accord with Taiwan, hinted
that when flight SQ876 arrives in Taoyuan, Taiwan authorities can
take the Wangs into custody.
</P>
<P>
The Wangs, who allegedly embezzled billions of dollars in
corporate funds before going on the lam, arrived at Singapore's
Changi International Airport Friday morning after leaving the
United States the previous day.
</P>
<P>
The Wangs fled to China late last year after two of the Rebar
group's  120-odd member  companies  applied  for  insolvency
restructuring. The fallout triggered a run on the Chinese Bank,
another of the group's affiliates. Subsequent judicial
investigations found that the couple and other family members and
corporate executives were involved in many suspected
irregularities, including fraud, embezzlement, breach of trust
and insider trading.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan's judicial authorities and liaison officials posted in the
city-state engaged in intensive negotiations with the Singaporean
immigration authorities over the Wangs' extradition Friday
morning.
</P>
<P>
The Singaporean authorities said before the negotiations that
there was no reason for them to take the Wangs into custody as
the couple had used authentic passports and normal travel papers
for their entrance.
