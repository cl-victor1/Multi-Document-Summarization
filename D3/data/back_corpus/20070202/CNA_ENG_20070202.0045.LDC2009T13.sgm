The Government Information Office (GIO) will protect the
diversity of Taiwan's publications and the needs of disadvantaged
publishers by drafting a law aimed at reinvigorating the local
publishing industry, GIO Minister Cheng Wen-tsang said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Cheng made the remarks while receiving delegates from publishers
from South Korea and Thailand.
</P>
<P>
During his meeting with the Korean delegates, Cheng said Taiwan's
publishing industry  is unique in that the content of local
publications is very diversified.
</P>
<P>
In addition, local publishers accept new things very fast, he
added.
</P>
<P>
Cheng told the delegates that Taiwan should learn from them in
passing on cultural values, and praised their achievements in
children's books, animation and digital publication.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on the market for Chinese-language publications, Cheng
claimed that Taiwan's use of traditional Chinese characters makes
it easier for Taiwanese to be connected with classical Chinese
culture.
</P>
<P>
Cheng used National Palace Museum art as an example, saying that
Taiwan college students can understand the words in ancient
Chinese books or paintings very easily, while claiming that their
Chinese counterparts who use simplified characters cannot.
</P>
<P>
Later, during his meeting with the Thai delegates, Cheng thanked
them for choosing to feature Taiwan at the Bangkok International
Bookfair 2007, which will be held from March 28-April 10.
