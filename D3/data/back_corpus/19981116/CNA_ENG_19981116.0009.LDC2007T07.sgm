EUROPEAN GREEN PARTIES URGE TAIWAN VOTERS TO SUPPORT GREEN POLITICS

Taipei, Nov. 16 (CNA) (By Sofia Wu)
</P>
<P>
A visiting senior executive of the European Federation of Green
Parties (EFGP) urged Taiwan voters on Monday to support Taiwan Green
Party candidates in the upcoming parliamentary elections.
</P>
<P>
"We look forward to seeing Taiwan voters use their ballots to support
'green politics' to help ensure sustainable development on the Earth,"
said EFGP spokesman Franz Floss.
</P>
<P>
Floss made the appeal at a news conference held at the campaign
headquarters of Kao Cheng-yen, convenor of the Taiwan Green Party, who
is seeking a seat in the Republic of China's parliament -- the
Legislative Yuan -- in the Taipei City constituency.
</P>
<P>
Floss said the EFGP is composed of 30 green parties in 28 European
countries. "Green parties in several European countries, including
France and Germany, have managed to join ruling coalitions to put
their ideals and concepts into practice," the Austrian environmental
activist said, adding he hopes Taiwan voters will throw more support
behind Green Party candidates in the Dec. 5 elections for the
Legislative Yuan and city councils of Taipei and Kaohsiung, the
island's two special municipalities.
</P>
<P>
Floss, who once served as general secretary of the Austrian Green
Party, pointed out that reduction of carbon dioxide emissions and
anti-nuclear power generation have become the two major concerns of
global environmentalists.
</P>
<P>
Floss said many EFGP member countries, including France, Italy and
Finland, have agreed to cut carbon dioxide emissions to help ward off
a global warming crisis.
</P>
<P>
Noting that anti-nuclear power generation is the EFGP's consistent
policy, Floss said both the French Green Party and the German Green
Party have been pushing for shutdown of nuclear power plants in their
respective territories.
</P>
<P>
"Such efforts have paid off," Floss said. Germany, for example, has
decided to gradually close 16 nuclear power plants within its borders.
</P>
<P>
Floss went on to say that Austria held a plebiscite 10 years ago to
decide whether to close its only nuclear power plant. "Slightly more
than 50 percent of Austrian voters vetoed the proposal of continued
use of nuclear power. The Austrian government has consistently abided
by the voting result. Our former clear power plant has now become a
museum," he reported.
</P>
<P>
Floss said he couldn't understand why the ROC government has been
reluctant to hold a referendum to decide whether to continue using
nuclear power.
</P>
<P>
Several local-level governments, including the Taipei City Government
and the Taipei County Government, once held plebiscites within their
administrative districts to look into public opinion about the central
government's decision to build the island's fourth nuclear power plant
in Kungliao, a coastal township in northern Taiwan. The results of
those plebiscites, however, were non-binding.
</P>
<P>
Floss met with Lin Yi-hsiung, chairman of Taiwan's main opposition
Democratic Progressive Party and founder of the Fourth Nuclear Power
Plant Plebiscite Promotion Association, Monday afternoon to discuss
Taiwan's anti-nuclear power generation movement.
</P>
<P>
During his visit, Floss will also call at the ROC's Ministry of
Foreign Affairs, the Atomic Energy Council and the Environmental
Protection Administration to discuss nuclear power generation and
other environmental protection issues.
