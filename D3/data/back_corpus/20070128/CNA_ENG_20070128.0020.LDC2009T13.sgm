Former Premier Frank Hsieh encouraged disadvantaged people over
the weekend not to give up hope and to learn from alocal
handicapped musician who died the previous week in southern
Kaohsiung City at the age of 43.
</P>
<P>
Hsieh made the remarks Saturday at the funeral of John Lan, who
was born with multiple handicaps, which caused blindness, limb
atrophy, facial nerve defects and left him unable to speak.
</P>
<P>
Despite his physical limitations, Lan helped other disadvantaged
people by selling pottery he made to raise funds for them, Hsieh
said.
</P>
<P>
Hsieh also recalled his experience of playing music with Lan, a
drummer, for prisoners at a jail in the port city.
</P>
<P>
Hsieh said a foundation named after Lan was established in 1998,
the same year he was elected Kaohsiung mayor. He added that since
then, he has admired Lan's passion for life and his efforts to
bring joy to others.
</P>
<P>
Hsieh noted that during his political career, he has been
inspired by Lan's perseverance and determination and has learned
not to give up hope, especially when Taiwan is placed in a
disadvantaged position.
</P>
<P>
In addition, he urged the government to provide better care for
the disadvantaged.
