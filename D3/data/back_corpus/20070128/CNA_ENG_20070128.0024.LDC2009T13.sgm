A research institute designed to provide guidance and strategic
planning to the service industry is scheduled to be established
by the end of March, Economic Minister Chen Ruey-long said
Sunday.

With enthusiastic support from the business community, Chen said
the funding scale of the long-planned Commercial Development
Research Institute will be doubled to NT$200 million.

Chen said the institute in its initial stage will contain three
research divisions and an incubation center. The three research
divisions will specialize respectively in commercial development
and social impact, consumption patterns and lifestyles, and
international development in commerce. Another two research
divisions on business models innovation and commercial technology
applications will follow in the third year.

He said the government will invest around 51 percent of the
establishment fund, and the other 49 percent will come from the
private sector.

According to earlier plan drawn by the Ministry of Economic
Affairs, the institute needed NT$30 million to start functioning.
Chen Friday raised the number to NT$100 million, before doubling
it two days later. He said he adjusted the objective after he
consulted people in the business circle and found stronger-then-
expected support from them.
