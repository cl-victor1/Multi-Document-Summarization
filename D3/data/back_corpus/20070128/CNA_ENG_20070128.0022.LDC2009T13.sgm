A new anti-drug association will be established soon to raise
awareness and provide knowledge about how to reduce the harm of
intravenous drug use, a spokesman for the preparatory office said
Sunday.

<P>
In view of the fact that a sharp increase in the number of HIV
infections is associated with intravenous drug use, Yi-Ming
Arthur Chen, director of the AIDS Prevention and Research Center
at National Yang-Ming University, and Hsieh Chu- ying, secretary-
general of Lourdes Home, the only Catholic organization in Taiwan
that offers free services to people living with HIV/AIDS,
determined to collaborate in setting up the new group, according
to the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
He noted that drug use by young adults has increased radically in
Taiwan and added that unsafe intravenous drug users are among the
high risk group for hepatitis C and syphilis, as well as HIV
infection.
</P>
<P>
He said the association will be dedicated to reducing the harm
caused by drug abuse to individuals and society, cutting the
chances of causing HIV and other diseases among drug addicts,
promoting the concept and knowledge of harm reduction and
enhancing intergroup cooperation and international exchanges.
</P>
<P>
The establishment of the association has gained initial approval
from the Ministry of the Interior and can now begin to enlist
members, he said.
