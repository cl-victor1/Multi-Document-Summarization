OPPOSITION-PROPOSED AGENDA UNACCEPTABLE: DPP CAUCUS WHIP
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taipei,  Jan.  28 (CNA) 01/28/07  20:05:03 (By Luis Huang)
</P>
<P>
The legislative caucus of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) will not accept an opposition proposal for the agenda of an
extra legislative session under which a draft bill on amending
the Central Election Commission (CEC) Organic Law must be dealt
with ahead of the central government budget plan for 2007.
</P>
<P>
Chen Chin-jun, secretary-general of the DPP caucus, made the
remarks shortly after the legislative caucuses of the Kuomintang
(KMT) and the People First Party (PFP) put forward 35 bills they
want addressed during the proposed extra session, with the KMT-
drafted amendment bill on the CEC Organic Law listed as 30th on
the list, ahead of the 2007 budget plan.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a news conference held at the Legislative Yuan, KMT
Legislator Lei Chien said the first 29 bills are related to the
people's livelihood and include those submitted by the Executive
Yuan and the DPP caucus, but she added that a draft amendment to
the Organizational  Rules on the Labor Retirement Fund
Supervisory Committee is not listed on the KMT/PFP agenda
proposal.
</P>
<P>
Lei explained that the big difference between the DPP caucus
proposal and that of its KMT counterpart is that the former does
not advocate establishing a supervision and evaluation mechanism
for the labor retirement fund use, which, according to the
lawmaker, would make the fund "the government's ATM."
</P>
<P>
In response, Chen said the KMT/PFP agenda version shows that the
opposition camp is not sincere in supporting the holding of an
extra legislative session to handle various major bills, adding
that although the controversial KMT-drafted amendment to the CEC
Organic Law is listed as the 30th bill to be addressed, it is
still ahead of the 2007 government budget plan, which failed to
pass in the legislative session that ended Jan. 19.
</P>
<P>
If the KMT and the PFP continue to persist in their stance, the
situation will remain as chaotic as the just-concluded
legislative session, Chen noted. If so, there will be no point in
the legislature calling an extra session and the two opposition
parties will have to take responsibility for the failure, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Chen said the legislature's failure to give the green light to
the general budget plan will have a great impact on various
sectors, including the implementation of several major
development projects aimed at upgrading the nation's economic
growth and employment rate.
</P>
<P>
He further said that at least the less controversial bills such
as a draft amendment to the Organizational Rules for the Labor
Retirement Fund Supervisory Committee, a draft revision to
Article 48 of the Banking Law that would allow the government to
publish the names of major bank loan defaulters in a bid to clamp
down on financial irregularities, and "sunshine bills" aimed at
ensuring clean politics, should be addressed ahead of the CEC
bill.
</P>
<P>
According to Chen, the DPP caucus and the opposition Taiwan
Solidarity Union (TSU) will present an agenda proposal with the
2007 general budget plan at the top of the agenda, followed by a
draft bill on the organization of Labor Retirement Fund
Management and Supervisory Commission, a draft revision to the
Banking Law, a draft statute governing major defense investment,
as well as draft revisions to nine "sunshine bills," including
the Political Donations Law.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Tseng Tsan-teng, chief convener of the TSU legislative
caucus, said his party will firmly oppose the listing of any
politically controversial bills ahead of the budget plan in the
proposed extra session agenda.
</P>
<P>
If the ruling and opposition parties reach a consensus on holding
the  session, the  general  budget  plan  and  other  public
livelihood-related bills must be approved first, while
controversial clauses in the KMT-initiated CEC bill should be
discussed later.
</P>
<P>
The opposition-controlled legislature is scheduled to hold a
discussion session Monday to discuss whether to hold an
extraordinary legislative session to deal with several key bills
and to work out an agenda if the ruling and opposition parties
agree to convene the session.
</P>
<P>
Prior to the opening of the discussion session, Legislative Yuan
Speaker Wang Jin-pyng is expected to preside over negotiations
among caucus whips from across the political spectrum, during
which some controversial clauses in the KMT- drafted CEC bill
might be discussed.
