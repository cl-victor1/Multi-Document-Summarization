ACTING CHAIRWOMAN OF CHINA REBAR CO. RELEASED ON BAIL
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  Jan.  28 (CNA) 01/28/07  17:27:09 (By Han Nai-kuo)
</P>
<P>
The Taipei Public Prosecutor's Office released the acting
chairwoman of China Rebar Co. on NT$8 million (US$242,718) bail
early Sunday after questioning her for more than 12 hours about
the company's illegal transfer of company funds into the accounts
of members of the Wang family.
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors said they set the bail at NT$8 million after finding
that Wang Ling- mei played a major role in the hollowing out of
China Rebar Co. -- one of 70-odd subsidiaries owned by the
financially distressed Rebar Asia-Pacific Group.
</P>
<P>
Wang is a daughter of Taiwanese entrepreneur Wang You-theng,
founder and owner of Rebar Group who has fled to the United
States with his fourth wife Wang Chin Shyh-ying.
</P>
<P>
Wang You-theng and his wife are wanted for questioning about
insider trading and embezzlement within the Rebar Group, but they
fled Taiwan Dec. 30 -- a day after China Rebar Co. and Rebar
Group-owned Chia Hsin Food and Synthetic Fiber Co. filed
insolvency requests with the Taipei District Court.
</P>
<P>
Wang Ling-mei was questioned along with Chen Chu-chiu, secretary
to China Rebar's vice president, and five department chiefs in
charge of the company's finances.
</P>
<P>
Chen was released on NT$2 million bail, while three accounting
officers were discharged on lesser bail figures.
</P>
<P>
According to the prosecutors, the Wang family hollowed out China
Rebar Co. and Chia Hsin Food and Synthetic Fiber Co. in the same
manner they did Asia Pacific Broadband Telecom and two other
Rebar Group-owned subsidiaries -- the Chinese Bank and the stock
brokerage firm, the Great Chinese Bills Finance Corp.
</P>
<P>
The scandal was exposed after the application for insolvency
protection by China Rebar and Chia Hsin Food and Synthetic Fiber
Co. caused a panicked bank run on the Chinese Bank in early
January. The bank's customers withdrew more than NT$33 billion
(US$1 billion) from the bank, prompting a government takeover to
allay public fears.
</P>
<P>
The two companies became insolvent  after suffering losses
totaling NT$25.2 billion over the past seven years.  However,
according to initial estimates, the total losses caused to the
national coffers and investors by the Wang family's systematic
hollowing out of the Rebar Group-owned subsidiaries could amount
to NT$300 billion -- about one-fourth of Taiwan's annual tax
revenues.
</P>
<P>
As of Jan. 27, 26 Rebar Group employees, including many of Wang
You-theng's adult children in executive positions, had been
charged with embezzlement, granting illegal bad loans or insider
trading.
</P>
<P>
As the investigation into the scandal continues, the Taipei
Prosecutor's Office has banned 83 defendants and suspects from
leaving Taiwan.
