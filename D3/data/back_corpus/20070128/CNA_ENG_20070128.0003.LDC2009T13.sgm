PFP SUGGESTS EARLIER OPENING OF NEW LEGISLATIVE SESSION
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  Jan.  27 (CNA) 01/28/07  10:39:49 (By Flor Wang)

<P>
The opposition People First Party (PFP) suggested Saturday that
the Legislative Yuan open its new session earlier to deal with
several key bills pending approval, instead of calling an extra
session.
</P>
<P>
PFP spokesman Lee Hung-chun issued the call while answering
questions from reporters after Ker Chien-ming, a legislative
caucus whip of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP),
said that the PFP holds the key to passing the 2007 government
budget if an extra legislative session is called to handle the
bill.
</P>
<P>
Ker urged the PFP not to collaborate with the main opposition
Kuomintang and to allow the bill to clear the legislature, which
he said is of the greatest importance to the people's livelihood.
</P>
<P>
The latest meeting of the last legislative session ended Jan. 19
amid open fighting between the KMT and the DPP over the draft
Organic Law of the Central Election Commission, which was the
first to be addressed on the agenda.
</P>
<P>
DPP lawmakers used violence to prevent the draft law from
clearing the Legislative Yuan,  thus stonewalling other bills,
including the 2007 government budget bill, which the DPP said
should be put at the top of the agenda.
</P>
<P>
Calling on the ruling DPP not to pass the buck to the opposition
"pan-blue alliance" for the failed passage of the government
budget bill, Lee said that there is no rush to call an extra
legislative session, tentatively set for Jan. 29, to deal with
these bills as the new session is slated to kick off Feb. 27.
</P>
<P>
It would be more appropriate to begin the next legislative
session at an earlier date than to hold an extra session which
would cost NT$5 million per day, Lee said.
</P>
<P>
Lee also criticized the DPP for lacking a democratic spirit which
made it refuse to compromise with opposition parties at the
Legislative Yuan, as it only cares for the passage of the
government spending bill while refusing to negotiate with the
opposition over the passage of the draft law of the Central
Election Commission.
</P>
<P>
"The DPP must conduct deep self-reflection as it lacks the sense
to serve as a responsible ruling party," he said.
</P>
<P>
Later the same day at a party affairs meeting in northern Taoyuan
county, DPP Chairman You Shyi-kun attacked the KMT for lacking
concern for the people's livelihood by blocking the passage of
the 2007 government budget bill.
</P>
<P>
"Such a political party like the KMT that pays no attention to
public interests does not deserve the people's confidence to rule
the country," You claimed.
