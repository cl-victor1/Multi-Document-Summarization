KMT SHOULD BE PRAGMATIC OVER EXTRA SESSION AGENDA: DPP WHIP
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taipei,  Jan.  28 (CNA) 01/28/07  16:17:25 (By Luis Huang)
</P>
<P>
A legislative caucus whip of the ruling Democratic Progressive
Party (DPP) called Sunday for the main opposition Kuomintang
(KMT) to cease insisting that a draft bill on amending the
Central Election Commission (CEC) Organic Law should be put at
the top of the agenda for a proposed extra legislative session.
</P>
<P>
Ker Chien-ming, chief convener of the DPP caucus, made the appeal
a day prior to the holding of a discussion session by the
Legislative Yuan to discuss whether to hold an extraordinary
legislative session to deal with several key bills, including the
central government budget plan for 2007.
</P>
<P>
Prior to the opening of the discussion, caucus whips from across
the political spectrum will meet to forge a consensus on topics
to be put on the agenda for the planned extra legislative session
and to discuss some controversial clauses in the KMT-initiated
draft bill on the CEC Organic Law.
</P>
<P>
Should the legislature fail to call an extra session to pass the
government's 2007 budget plan, it will be put aside for more than
half a year when a new legislative session starts later next
month because general interpellations must be conducted first
during the new session, Ker pointed out.
</P>
<P>
If so, the government will not be able to carry out several major
national development projects due to lack of funds, Ker noted,
urging the KMT legislative caucus not to insist that the CEC bill
be addressed ahead of the 2007 budget plan during the proposed
extra session.
</P>
<P>
Claiming that no extra legislative session will be called unless
the legislature has to deal with urgent, major issues, Ker said
the KMT should not put the non- urgent draft bill on the CEC
Organic Law at the top of the agenda.
</P>
<P>
He stated that the DPP caucus will insist that the 2007
government budget plan be dealt with first, followed by a draft
amendment to the Organizational rules for the Labor Retirement
Fund Supervisory Committee and a draft revision to the Banking
Law that would allow the government to publish the names of major
bank loan defaulters in a bid to clamp down on financial
irregularities.
</P>
<P>
The Executive Yuan-submitted budget plan for 2007 failed to pass
in the legislative session that ended Jan. 19 due to incessant
bickering between the ruling and opposition  parties over the
KMT-drafted amendment bill on the organization of the CEC,
according to which CEC members would be recommended by political
parties in proportion to the number of their legislative seats.
</P>
<P>
The fruitless session marked the first time in the nation's
history that the central government budget bill had failed to
pass the legislature before the beginning of the fiscal year.
