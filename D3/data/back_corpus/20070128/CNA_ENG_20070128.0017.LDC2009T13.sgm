The MacDonald's Corporation has designated Jan. 28 as its
volunteer day to step up a drive to help mentally challenged
children in remote areas receive early therapy and education, as
part of the 23rd anniversary celebrations of entering the Taiwan
market, a spokesman for the fast food chain said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said all MacDonald's branches in Taiwan will join
forces in the activity.
</P>
<P>
He said early identification and intervention for mentally
challenged children is the best approach to help treat their
problems, but children in remote areas often miss the chance to
receive early intervention education due to a lack of medical and
economic resources.
</P>
<P>
The company launched a charity program last year to help such
children receive early intervention and special education,
according to the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
The assistance includes financial aid, nursery visits and timely
evaluation and assessments for children with development delays
in remote areas of the central county of Nantou, the spokesman
added.
</P>
<P>
He also noted that MacDonald's Taiwan, in conjunction with 17
nurseries and the Puli Christian Hospital, have so far visited
500 disadvantaged children and have helped 130 children with
early intervention.
