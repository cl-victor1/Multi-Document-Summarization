Ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) Chairman Yu Shyi-kun
has yet to decide whether to take part in the party's primary for
the 2008 presidential election, a DPP official said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Tsai Huang-liang, DPP deputy secretary-general, made the remarks
after the United Daily News reported that President Chen Shui-
bian has decided to replace Premier Su Tseng-chang before the
party's primary.
</P>
<P>
The major local newspaper said that the president is treating the
party's four heavyweight aspirants for the presidency -- namely
Su, Yu, Vice President Annette Lu, former Premier Frank Hsieh and
Yu Shyi-kun -- impartially in the hopes that they all can "start
from the same starting line."
</P>
<P>
On calls within the party for Yu to step down from the
chairmanship prior to the primary, Tsai said the chairman has yet
to make a final decision on whether to run.
</P>
<P>
There is still some time before the party's planned launch of its
primary process in March, Tsai said, adding that "Yu is still
considering whether to throw his hat in the ring."
</P>
<P>
On whether Yu would take part in the primary in his capacity as
chairman of the party, Tsai said "that should not be an issue, "
noting that President Chen ran for a second term while
concurrently serving as the party's chairman in 2004.
</P>
<P>
On President Chen's invitation to Yu to accompany him on his trip
to Nicaragua to attend President-elect Daniel Ortega's
inauguration ceremony Jan. 10, Tsai noted that the party chairman
accompanying the president on overseas trips has been the normal
practice, adding that this has nothing to do with the party's
primary.
