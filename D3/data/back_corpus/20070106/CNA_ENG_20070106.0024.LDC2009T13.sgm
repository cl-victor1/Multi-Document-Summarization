<P>
An educational foundation aimed at promoting the idea and
practice of "reading classics for children" will be set up
Sunday, with a ceremony to be held at Taipei-based National
Taiwan Normal University to mark the foundation's establishment.
</P>
<P>
The idea of setting up the Global Classics Education Foundation
was initiated by Wang Tsai-kui, an associate professor at
National Taichung University, who began his efforts to promote
the idea of reading Chinese classics in 1994.
</P>
<P>
Wang said the foundation's establishment signifies that the idea
and practice of reading Chinese classics to kids, even toddlers,
has successfully spread around the country, adding that it is
time to promote the ancient language and cultural educational
idea to the world.
</P>
<P>
According to Wang, the earlier a child forms the habit of
listening to and reciting Chinese classic written works, or even
Shakespeare's sonnets and dramas, the better.
</P>
<P>
"Ideally, a child should already have listened to most of the
world's classic music and seen most of its famous paintings by
the time of his or her third birthday, " Wang said, adding that
it is best for youngsters to memorize as many Chinese and foreign
classic works as they can before the age of 13 years because this
will establish a good basis for future learning and development.
</P>
<P>
According to the foundation's estimation, there are around 1.5
million children in Taiwan who are receiving "education in the
classics," while the number in China stands at around 20 million.
