President Chen Shui-bian dismissed reports Saturday that he
intends to replace Premier Su Tseng-chang prior to the primary to
choose the ruling Democratic Progressive Party's candidate for
the 2008 presidential election.
</P>
<P>
"The reports are very imaginative, and I only learned about them
after reading the newspaper," the president said.
</P>
<P>
Noting that Premier Su and his Cabinet team have performed well,
the president said categorically that he "has no plan to replace
Su at the present."
</P>
<P>
The president was responding to inquires about reports by the
United Daily News on the sidelines of an inspection tour of Puli,
Nantou County to see construction work on National Highway No. 6
and the development of a community.
</P>
<P>
The major local newspaper reported that sources familiar with the
DPP said that President Chen will treat the four DPP heavyweights
aspiring for the presidency equally and that he hopes they will
take part in the race from the same starting line.
</P>
<P>
The four bigwigs are the premier, DPP Chairman Yu Shyi-kun, Vice
President Annette Lu and former Premier Frank Hsieh.
</P>
<P>
The reports also said that the president has decided to replace
Su before the party's presidential primary at the latest.
</P>
<P>
According to the DPP's initial schedule, the registration period
for hopefuls will be in March, and TV debates will be held in
April, with voting by party members set for May.
