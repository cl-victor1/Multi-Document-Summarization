LEGISLATIVE SPEAKER FAVORS FLEXIBLE OPENING TOWARD CHINA
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taipei,  Jan.  1 (CNA) 01/01/07  18:51:13 (By Flor Wang)
</P>
<P>
Although President Chen Shui-bian has the final say in
arbitrating the government's cross-Taiwan Strait policy,
Legislative Yuan Speak Wang Jin-pyng said Monday that Taiwan
should be flexible in opening to China to help give a boost to
Taiwan companies.
</P>
<P>
Wang, a heavyweight of the main opposition Kuomintang (KMT), made
the remarks while answering questions from reporters after
President Chen Shui-bian said earlier the same day in his New
Year's Day address  that there is nothing  wrong with Taiwan's
current cross-strait policy that centers on "Taiwan first" and
"Taiwan identity" concepts.
</P>
<P>
Chen also denied that there is a so-called "modified" approach
being adopted by Premier Su Tseng-chang in Taiwan's dealings with
China -- something Mainland Affairs Council Chairman Joseph Wu
said was dreamed up by local media outlets.
</P>
<P>
Despite the fact that the president is in full charge of the
country's China policy, Wang contended, however, that Taiwan
should be more open to China when necessary for Taiwan's own
business interests. He also hailed past openings initiated by
Taiwan to China that have helped Taiwan companies gain a new
lease on life.
</P>
<P>
Tseng Yung-chuan, a KMT lawmaker and executive director of the
party's Policy Coordination Committee, said that he would agree
to Chen's remarks that there is no so-called "Su's modified
approach" so long as the nation's leaders -- Chen and Su --
realize that China links are key to Taiwan's economic prosperity.
</P>
<P>
The government's policy should be effective enough to heed the
nation's problems and it should stop playing word games to really
help improve the people's livelihoods, Tseng said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, figures in the ruling Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) also had mixed responses to Chen's claim that there is no
"Su's modified approach" regarding Taiwan's engagements with
China.
</P>
<P>
According to DPP lawmaker Lee Chun-i, Chen's such rhetoric should
be an effort to have the DPP administration re-center on his
"Taiwan first" basic policy line.
</P>
<P>
But Lee denied widespread speculation that Chen was hinting that
Su might be replaced due to alleged tension simmering between the
two as a result of their different approaches toward China.
</P>
<P>
The president should be attempting to pressure the Cabinet to
stick to his China policy during the final more than one year of
his second tenure, Lee explained, pointing out that tension could
surge between Chen and Su if Su does seek to walk his own path to
boost his chances in the 2008 presidential election.
</P>
<P>
Lee Wen-chung, a former lawmaker of the DPP's now dissolved
powerful New Tide Faction, said that the government should forge
a China policy that would best serve Taiwan's interest, although
cross-strait economics are closely related to politics.
</P>
<P>
He also blasted speculation that relations between Chen and Su
have worsened.
</P>
<P>
Daniel Huang, a lawmaker of the opposition People First Party,
said he believes that Chen -- a "lame duck" with only a little
over one year left in office, is expected to gradually loosen his
standing toward China to help pay off his past errors in cross-
strait relations.
</P>
<P>
Pressure from pro-independence forces demanding that Chen not
open further to China should have no impact on the president, who
cannot seek a third term, Huang claimed.
