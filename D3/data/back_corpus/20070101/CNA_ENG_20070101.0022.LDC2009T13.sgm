<P>
An assembly to bring about the creation of a forum on new
democracies will be held in Taipei Jan. 26, Ministry of Foreign
Affairs (MOFA) spokesman Wang Chien- yeh said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Wang made the remarks after President Chen Shui-bian said in his
New Year message that he wants to initiate a "Global Forum on New
Democracies" that will serve as a platform for dialogue and
exchange for new democracies. Chen also said that prior to its
formal establishment, Taiwan will convene an assembly in the near
future to push for its creation.
</P>
<P>
Wang noted that the forum is being planned by the Taiwan
Foundation for Democracy (TFD), an organization promoted by the
MOFA that pulls talent and funds from the government and the
private sectors.
</P>
<P>
He said that in addition to inviting political leaders from South
Korea, South Africa and other new democracies to attend the Jan.
26 assembly to exchange experience with domestic political
leaders, there will be an activity showcasing the democratic
experiences of various countries.
</P>
<P>
Tung Li-wen, TFD vice president, said the foundation hopes to
invite the "second-wave" democratic countries, or countries that
rose democratically in the 1980s and 1990s, to share their
experiences in meeting challenges after being democratized.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that the exchanges will help solve common
dilemmas and difficulties and promote democratic cooperation.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the TFD is currently planning related activities,
but will only publish details after everything is finalized for
fear of obstruction from China.
