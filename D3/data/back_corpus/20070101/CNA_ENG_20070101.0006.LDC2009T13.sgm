President Chen Shui-bian said Monday that Taiwan cannot allow a
full opening of exchange services for China's currency, the yuan,
before the two sides of the Taiwan Strait sign a currency
clearance and liquidation agreement.
</P>
<P>
The president made the remarks while going for a test ride on the
nation's first high-speed rail after presiding over a ceremony
marking the beginning of the ninety-sixth year of the nation.
Accompanying Chen were Presidential Office Secretary-General Tan
Sun Chen, National Security Council Secretary-General Chiou
I-jen, Minister of Transportation and Communications Tsai Duei,
and Taiwan High-Speed Rail Corp. Chairwoman Nita Ing.

Asked about the New Taiwan dollar-Chinese yuan exchange services,
the president said that the matter involves both sides of the
Taiwan Strait.
</P>
<P>
"Taiwan cannot engage in wishful thinking, nor can it care only
about the voices and interests of a few, " he said, adding that
as, the head of state, he cares about "national security and
interests."
</P>
<P>
"We look forward to signing a currency clearance and liquidation
agreement, but Beijing is lukewarm about it, " the president
said, adding that Taiwan has to make early preparations in
anticipation of Chinese tourists.
</P>
<P>
He noted that prior to the two sides signing an agreement, Taiwan
has allowed the conversion, selling and buying of Chinese yuan on
a trial basis on the two outlying islands of Kinmen and Matsu,
saying that as it has been done so on a trial basis, there cannot
be a full opening with no limitations.
</P>
<P>
"If both sides sign a currency clearance  and liquidation
agreement, then we can follow related regulations on foreign
currency exchanges," the president said.
</P>
<P>
"This is because we have to insist on Taiwan's sovereignty and
interests, " he stressed.
</P>
<P>
The president's remarks came on the heels of comments by Perng
Fai-nan, governor of the Taipei-based Central Bank of China (CBC)
, who said last Monday that now is the best time to open Chinese
yuan exchange services on Taiwan proper.
</P>
<P>
Once the government gives the green light, the CBC will be ready
to implement the new policy, Perng said.
