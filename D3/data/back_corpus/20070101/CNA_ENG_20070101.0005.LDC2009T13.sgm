TAIWAN'S CROSS-STRAIT TRADE POLICY MEETS PEOPLE'S EXPECTATIONS:
CHEN

Taipei,  Jan.  1 (CNA) 01/01/07  13:38:14 (By Deborah Kuo)
</P>
<P>
President Chen Shui-bian said in his New Year message delivered
Monday that Taiwan's current cross-strait trade policy is in good
shape and meets the people's expectations.
</P>
<P>
Chen  reiterated  the "proactive  management  and effective
liberalization" approach that he declared in his 2006 New Year
message as Taiwan's new guiding principle and course of action
for cross-strait economic and trade policymaking.
</P>
<P>
"Examining our economic performance over the past year, we have
indeed done rather well," Chen said.
</P>
<P>
For example, he said, export volume and orders set new record
highs, with their combined value in September 2006 exceeding the
US$20 billion mark for a single month for the first time. The
employment situation also steadily improved,  with the average
unemployment rate registering at less than 4 percent.
</P>
<P>
"Our foreign exchange reserves -- a symbol of our collective
wealth and the global business community's confidence in Taiwan
-- grew nearly threefold between 2000 and the end of November
2006, increasing from US$106.7 billion to US$265.1 billion," Chen
noted.
</P>
<P>
"On the last trading day of last year, the Taiwan Stock Exchange
reached its highest mark since Aug. 5, 2000, while an increasing
number of overseas capital investment institutions have expressed
confidence that it is not unrealistic to expect the TAIEX to rise
to 10,000 points within one or two years," he continued.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, he added, a survey conducted at the end of December
2006 indicated that 49.7 percent of respondents  believe that
regulations concerning China- bound investment should be
tightened, while 56.7 percent are of the view that unless there
is a consensus in society, the government should not further
relax restrictions on cross-strait economic and trade relations.
</P>
<P>
He said that the government's insistence on its cross-strait
trade policies meets the expectations of the majority of Taiwan
people, adding that the government has worked single-mindedly to
implement  its cross-strait  trade policies,  which Premier Su
Tseng-chang has also followed instead of seeking to adjust, as
some have suggested.
</P>
<P>
"There was no so-called 'Su modified formula, ' but only 'Taiwan
First' and 'Taiwan-centric consciousness' on these efforts. This
is definitely clear, " Chen stressed.
</P>
<P>
On the country's sovereign status, he said, it must be emphasized
and reiterated once again that "our country, Taiwan, has a total
land area of 36,000 square kilometers. The sovereignty of Taiwan
belongs to its 23 million people, not to the People's Republic of
China. Only the people of Taiwan have the right to decide
Taiwan's future."
</P>
<P>
He asserted that Taiwan is a part of the world, not a part of
China, saying, "Taiwan's overall national goals must not become
dislocated from the world's development and transformation. Our
formulation  of national policies must rise above the cramped
framework of 'one China' and cross-strait relations. We must keep
an expansive vision and understand issues in their broader
context, so that we may affirm the rightful status and unique
persona of Taiwan in the global political and economic arenas,
and vigorously pursue the creation of a sound foundation for our
sustainable development."
</P>
<P>
"Be it the former Kuomintang government's resolve, soon after
relocating to Taiwan, to counterattack and recover the mainland
or, later, its vow to unify China under the Three Principles of
the People, its creation of the Guidelines for National
Unification, its talk about a so-called 1992 Consensus, or its
espousal of an 'ultimate unification' dictum -- in essence, it
all presumes that unification is the only possible option for our
future. This mindset not only deprives Taiwan's people of their
freedom of choice, but also contravenes the fundamental principle
of 'sovereignty lies in the people,'" he argued.
</P>
<P>
"In 2000, we witnessed the alternation of governing parties and
peaceful transfer of political power. In 2003, we enacted the
Referendum Act. In 2004, we conducted the first national
referendum. In 2005, we enacted constitutional revisions whereby
the National Assembly was abolished and its power to ratify
constitutional amendments was transferred to the people through
exercising the right of referendum. On Feb. 28, 2006, I declared
that the National Unification Council had ceased to function, and
the Guidelines for National Unification had ceased to apply," he
continued.
</P>
<P>
"Although each of these steps in our ongoing democratization was
fraught with difficulty and encountered pressure and resistance
from many quarters, we held firm to our faith in democracy. We
insisted on returning to the peopleXfullyXtheir right to
determine our nation's destiny. At the same time, this process
spurred us to constantly reflect on our national identity  and
how we should position ourselves," he said.
</P>
<P>
Chen further said that his government is determined to promote
social equity and justice.
</P>
<P>
"We have been taking forceful action to implement programs to
help underprivileged families out of poverty so as to keep those
experiencing hard times from sinking into despair. We are also
setting up a system of community- based and nonprofit extended
care to improve the quality of care for the elderly. We will
expedite the passage of legislation to establish a national
pension system and press for its early implementation to further
enhance our social security network," he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
"Furthermore, we have been working hard to set the National
Health Insurance system on a sounder financial footing to enhance
the nation's health. In addition, by establishing a program to
provide assistance and counseling, we will help immigrant spouses
from overseas -- including those from China -- improve their
employability and achieve financial independence, " he said.
</P>
<P>
"In short, no matter what difficulties the members of our society
may face, let us make sure that everyone can feel the compassion
and loving care we have for one another. I urge all departments
of government, in the shortest time possible, to realize the
goals that I have just outlined. At the same time, I call for the
ruling and opposition parties to do their utmost to draw up and
support necessary legislation and budgets," he said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, Chen -- flanked by Vice President Annette Lu,
Premier Su Tseng-chang and ruling Democratic Progressive Party
Chairman Yu Shyi-kun -- attended a flag-raising ceremony in front
of the Presidential Office to mark the dawn of the new year.
</P>
<P>
After delivering the New Year message at the Presidential Office,
Chen took a ride on the "bullet train" from Panchiao, Taipei
County, to Taichung in central Taiwan, where he presented a
plaque for the Taiwan high-speed railway's inaugural train.
