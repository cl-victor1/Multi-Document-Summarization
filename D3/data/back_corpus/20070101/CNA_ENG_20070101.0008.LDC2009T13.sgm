The average overdue loan ratios of the credit departments of

Monday by the Bureau of Agricultural Finance under the Council of
Agriculture (COA).

They said that as of the end of November, the assets of the
credit departments of the farmers' and the fishermen's
associations totaled NT$1.5794 trillion, up NT$5.4 billion from
the previous month, with their net worth totaling NT$87.5

The outstanding deposits of the credit departments of the

The average overdue loan ratio of the credit departments of the
farmers' and the fishermen's associations peaked at 19.33 percent
at the end of 2001 and have slipped since that time due to active
writing-off of bad loans and improvement of the structure.
