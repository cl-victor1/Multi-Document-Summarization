President Chen Shui-bian said in his New Year message delivered
Monday that his government will strive to achieve four major
economic  goals in the new year based on "Taiwan-centric
consciousness and social equity and justice."
</P>
<P>
Chen said that looking toward the future, the government will
adhere to its two main pillars of governance -- insisting on
Taiwan-centric consciousness and achieving social equity and
justice -- in an effort to achieve the four major goals of
increasing investment in Taiwan, creating employment
opportunities, narrowing the urban-rural divide, and reducing
income disparities.
</P>
<P>
He said the government is committed to promoting sustainable
economic development.  "We have proactively  worked to attract
China-based Taiwanese businesspeople to reinvest in Taiwan so as
to buttress the foundation for national development. We will also
speed up tax reform to create  an internationally  competitive
tax environment."
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, he said, "we have taken measures to revitalize the
stock market in order to increase momentum to local capital
markets. In order to create a more favorable investment  and
business environment for Taiwan, we continue to promote the
development of and investment in up-and-coming industrial bases
such as the Hsinchu Science Park, Central Taiwan Science Park,
and Southern Taiwan Science Park."
</P>
<P>
"Meanwhile, we will accelerate the development of the special
commercial zones associated with the five major stations along
the high-speed railway, guided by a philosophy of clustering
businesses with distinctive local characteristics," he continued.
</P>
<P>
Chen said the government is also investing in technological
innovation and research and development. "Recent data indicate
that total expenditures on research and development in 2005
reached 2.52 percent of our GDP, bringing us closer to the
government's target of 3 percent. We continue to promote
industrial diversification by augmenting programs to foster the
development of a third -- or even fourth -- of a trillion New
Taiwan dollar industry."
</P>
<P>
Moreover, he continued, "we will push for the enactment of an
improved renewable energy act at the earliest possible date as
part of the efforts to boost the production value of 'green'
businesses to reach NT$150 billion (US$4.6 billion) in 2009."
</P>
<P>
"In addition,  we will more aggressively develop broadband
Internet access, with the goal of increasing the rate of
broadband users to 40 percent of the population," he continued.
