Taipei,  Jan. 14 (CNA) 01/14/07  19:35:16 (By Deborah Kuo)

Taiwan High Speed Rail Corp. (THSR) should continue to offer
half-price or discounted tickets for its bullet train service
until all the technical glitches are tackled and the service is
"fully acceptable" to the passengers,  Minister of Transportation
and Communications Tsai Duei said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Tsai said that although the Ministry of Transportation and
Communications has no right to prohibit THSR from selling full-
price tickets in accordance with the contract, the ministry
thinks THSR should continue the half-price ticket sales after
Jan. 20, given the spate of undesirable incidents over the first
week following the high-speed railway's launch Jan. 5.
</P>
<P>
THSR is scheduled to offer half-price tickets until Jan. 19.
</P>
<P>
THSR Chief Executive Officer Ou Chin-der said Sunday that the
company will begin selling tickets at regular prices beginning
Jan. 20 as scheduled.
</P>
<P>
Ou said most of the widely-reported  "technical  glitches"
surrounding the bullet train services were related to ticket
sales on the first day of the system's commercial test runs and
that the unidentified fumes escaping in a carriage of one of the
trains bound for Banciao, Taipei County Jan. 11 was "an isolated"
case.
</P>
<P>
The 345-km railway linking Taipei and Kaohsiung has reduced rail
travel time between Taiwan's two largest cities to 90 minutes
from the previous four- and-a-half hours.
