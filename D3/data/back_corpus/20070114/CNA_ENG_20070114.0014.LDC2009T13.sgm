Enjoying a cup of aromatic coffee or tea with or right after a
meal may be one of life's small pleasures for some people, but a
nutritionist warned Sunday that people with this seemingly
harmless habit could end up paying a high price by contracting
anemia.
</P>
<P>
Liao Ying-yin, a nutritionist who formerly worked at the Taipei
Armed Forces General Hospital and who now teaches at the
Municipal Yuchen High School, said the drinking of coffee or tea
should be delayed until two or three hours after a meal.
</P>
<P>
She explained that drinking coffee or tea with a meal on a long-
term basis can cause anemia -- a common blood disorder -- because
the caffeine in the drink can inhibit the body's absorption of
iron and the production of hemoglobin, the main component of
healthy red blood cells.
</P>
<P>
When the amount of healthy red blood cells is too low, there is
not enough hemoglobin to carry oxygen to the body's tissues. This
results in fatigue and stress on the body's organs and can lead
to health problems, she added.
</P>
<P>
Symptoms of anemia include fatigue, dizziness, rapid heartbeat,
pale skin and decreased pinkness of the lips, gums and nail beds,
</P>
<P>
According to Liao, other factors contributing to anemia include
staying up all night, insufficient sleep and drinking alcohol.
</P>
<P>
She suggested that one way to help prevent anemia is to increase
intake of iron- rich foods, such as green leafy vegetables, red
beans and pig liver.
