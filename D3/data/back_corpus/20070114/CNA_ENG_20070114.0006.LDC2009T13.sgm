Officers as well as the rank and file of the Army have been
encouraged recently to learn English or sharpen their English
proficiency  under a program initiated by Army Commanding General
Hu Chen-pu, an Army source said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Army Warfare Director Chou Yen-chung quoted Hu as having said
that learning a foreign language is now a world trend, manifested
by the fact that U.S. military officers have been exhorted to
take Chinese or Japanese lessons and that those who pass relevant
tests are even entitled to extra subsidies.
</P>
<P>
Based on this concept, Chou said, Hu ordered the implementation
of the program late last year to encourage officers and enlisted
soldiers  to attend English classes to sharpen  their English
proficiency.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, according to Chou, the Army has also been pushing for
the implementation of a 9 to 5 work schedule to allow the
greatest possible number of Army officers and soldiers to go home
and have dinner with their families everyday.
</P>
<P>
The policy, however, is being carried out while making sure that
personnel shifts for combat readiness are fully planned and
executed, Chou added.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the Army has also launched a combat capability
examination mechanism to ensure all higher-ranking Army officers
are capable in their posts, Chou said.
</P>
<P>
The new mechanism also examines matters related to Army morale
and discipline, he added.
</P>
<P>
These new programs are just a few of a series of innovative
policies that have been promoted by Gen. Hu since he assumed the
post of Army commanding general in February 2006, Chou noted.
