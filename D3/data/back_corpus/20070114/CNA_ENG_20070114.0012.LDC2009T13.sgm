President Chen Shui-bian presided over a goundbreaking ceremony
for the construction of a cultural park in Matou in southern
Tainan County.
</P>
<P>
Under the sponsorship of the central government, the Tainan
county government decided to construct  the cultural park in
Shuicheitou district in Matou's eastern area which used to be a
port until early 19th century.
</P>
<P>
During the ceremony, Chen promised that the central government
will financially support the construction and development of the
cultural park to preserve the Matou port site.
</P>
<P>
He said that the old Matou Port is culturally and historically
valuable, and for many people, it bears certain significance in
terms of "Feng Shui", the Chinese art or practice of positioning
objects, especially graves, buildings, and furniture, due to a
so-called "dragon throat" located there which is believed to
bring good fortune to local residents.
</P>
<P>
Chen also expressed the hope that once the construction of the
cultural park has been completed, the park can serve as a model
for other cultural parks in retaining Taiwan's heritage.
</P>
<P>
Construction of the Matou park is estimated at NT$60 million
(US$1.87 million) , with NT$23 million for the first stage of
construction on restoring the old Matou Port and old canals and
building a hall for conservation of historical relics.
