Some 100,000 people in Taiwan suffer from rheumatoid arthritis,
and the disease is three times more common in women than it is in
men, a doctor at National Cheng Kung University Hospital said
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Wang Chung-jen, a specialist  in internal medicine at the
hospital, said that although rheumatoid arthritis can affect
people of all ages, middle-aged women are more susceptible to the
disease.
</P>
<P>
Citing epidemiology statistics, Wang said the incidence rate of
rheumatoid arthritis in Taiwan is 0.04 percent, lower than the 1
percent in the United States and European countries.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that rheumatoid arthritis is an autoimmune disease
that causes chronic inflammation of the joints, the tissue around
the joints, such as the tendons and ligaments, or even various
organs of the body.
</P>
<P>
An autoimmune disease occurs when the body tissues are mistakenly
attacked by the body's own immune system, because antibodies in
the blood see the tissues as foreign invaders.
</P>
<P>
Rheumatoid arthritis is a progressive illness that has the
potential to cause deformity of the joints.
</P>
<P>
The exact cause of the disease is unknown. Some scientists
believe susceptibility to rheumatoid arthritis may be genetic.
Others suspect that certain infections or environmental factors
may trigger the immune system to attack the body's own tissues.
</P>
<P>
When the disease is active, symptoms can include fatigue, lack of
appetite, low grade fever, muscle and joint aches, and stiffness.
</P>
<P>
According to doctors, there is no known cure for rheumatoid
arthritis. At present, treatment of rheumatoid arthritis is only
aimed at reducing inflammation and pain, maximizing joint
function and preventing joint destruction and deformity.
