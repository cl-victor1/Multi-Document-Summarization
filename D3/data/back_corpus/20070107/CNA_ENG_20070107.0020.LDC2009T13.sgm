TAIWAN'S TOP FINANCIAL REGULATOR COPING WITH EMERGING STORM
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taipei, Jan.  7 (CNA) 01/07/07  19:46:52
</P>
<P>
Taiwan's top financial regulating agency is facing the greatest
challenge since its inception in July 2004 -- how to defuse an
emerging financial storm triggered by bank runs at the Chinese
Bank, owned by the financially distressed Rebar Asia-Pacific
Group.
</P>
<P>
The Financial Supervisory Commission (FSC) is apparently aware of
the grave nature of the crisis. This is self-evident from the
line-up at a Jan. 7 press conference of six top officials from
various government departments  in charge of maintaining  the
nation's financial order, who urged Chinese Bank account holders
to avoid panicking unnecessarily over the bank runs.
</P>
<P>
These officials included FSC Chairman Shih Jun-ji, Minister of
Finance Ho Chih- chin, Governor Perng Fai-nan of the Taipei-based
Central Bank of China and President Johnson Chen of the Central
Deposit Insurance Corp. (CDIC).
</P>
<P>
Their calls came after account holders withdrew a total of NT$15
billion (US$45.91 million) from the Chinese Bank in a matter of
hours, shortly before and after the FSC decided Jan. 5 to have
the Central Deposit Insurance Corp. (CDIC) take over the troubled
bank.
</P>
<P>
To allay account holders' fears, these officials declared they
have mustered NT$30 billion from the central bank and five other
major banks -- sufficient to pay all clients who wish to withdraw
their funds or close their accounts at the Chinese Bank.
</P>
<P>
The FSC head indicated that according to laws governing the use
of the Financial Restructuring Fund and the Deposit Insurance
Fund, the FSC is supported by a pool of funds totaling more than
NT$100 billion, and that the amount should be more than enough to
prevent the wave of bank runs spreading to other banks and
triggering a full-blown financial storm.
</P>
<P>
It remains to be seen whether their confidence-building measures
will meet receptive ears Jan. 8 -- the first business day for
commercial banks after a weekend.
</P>
<P>
The bank runs were set off after the Taipei District Court
approved on Jan. 4 a restructuring request by China Rebar Co. and
Chia Hsin Food &amp; Synthetic Fiber Co. -- two subsidiary
companies of Rebar Asia Pacific Group -- which became insolvent
after suffering losses totaling NT$25.2 billion over the past
seven years.
</P>
<P>
China Rebar is a large Taiwanese corporation involved in a wide
range of businesses, including textiles, construction, hotels,
real estate, retail, services, insurance, banking and media.
Together, the company and China Hsin Food &amp; Synthetic Fiber
Co. employ more than 3,400 people.
</P>
<P>
In addition to having the CDIC take over the Chinese Bank, the
FSC took further action Jan. 6 to ask Taiwan Cooperative Bank and
Cathay United Bank to jointly take over the Rebar Group-owned
stock brokerage firm, the Great Chinese Bills Finance Corp., in
an attempt to nip a domino effect in the bud.
</P>
<P>
The crisis is another blow to the FSC, which has barely restored
its tarnished image after a series of corruption scandals
implicated three of its executives.
</P>
<P>
The FSC's decision-making process has become the focus of
controversy, as critics have noted that the FSC announced the
takeover of the Chinese Bank without prior warning.
</P>
<P>
The critics have pointed out that Shih, the FSC chairman, when
briefing news media Jan. 5 on his targets for the new year, made
assurances that the Chinese Bank was in good financial condition
and would not require a government takeover, but only several
hours later, he was forced to eat his words by announcing the
bank's takeover by the CDIC.
</P>
<P>
Shih's sudden move has also provoked the ire of the 50,000
disgruntled shareholders of the Chinese Bank, because his only
answer to them was that they could file complaint with the
Securities and Futures Investors Protection Center.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the Chinese Bank, two other debt-ridden banks --
Taitung Business Bank and Enterprise Bank of Hualien -- have been
placed under the control of the Financial Restructuring Fund,
also known as the Resolution Trust Corp. (RTC) fund.
</P>
<P>
Analysts are concerned that with the resources of the RTC fund
spread thin, other banks in poor financial shape may adopt a
wait-and-see attitude and slow down the pace for improving their
financial structures.
