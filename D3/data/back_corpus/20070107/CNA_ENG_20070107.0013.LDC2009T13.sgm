MOFA DISMISSES REPORTS OF 'CASH-FOR-FRIENDSHIP' DIPLOMACY
</HEADLINE>

Taipei, Jan. 7 (CNA) 01/07/07  18:08:01 (By Luis Huang)
</P>
<P>
Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) spokesman Wang Chien-yeh
reiterated Sunday that there will be no instances of so-called
"cash-for-friendship diplomacy" or "diplomatic extortion" with
Taiwan's diplomatic allies, since the nation has always carried
out such cooperation under legal procedures.
</P>
<P>
Wang made the remarks while dismissing a media report that after
experiencing a long-term, diplomatic tug-of-war between the two
sides of the Taiwan Strait, Taiwan's diplomatic allies have
formulated a "two-pronged strategy" to extort a large sum of
financial aid from the nation.
</P>
<P>
For example, the president of one of Taiwan's diplomatic allies
in the Eastern Caribbean summoned the nation's ambassador to his
office asking for US$550 million worth of financial aid shortly
after winning the presidential election two years ago, the report
pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Claiming the report is incorrect,  Wang said the nation's aid
projects toward its diplomatic allies must be subject to a
cautious feasibility evaluation, and will then be discussed by
officials from both parties before they are put into practice.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has been promoting its diplomatic
work in a pragmatic way over the past year, as "dollar diplomacy"
is not necessarily in Taiwan's favor on the heels of China's
economic rise, Wang explained.
</P>
<P>
Saying that Central and South America is Taiwan's diplomatic
stronghold, Wang noted that in light of growing foreign aid
coming from China, the country has been under great pressure to
strengthen relations with its diplomatic allies in that region.
</P>
<P>
As for Taiwan-Nicaragua diplomatic ties, Wang said Taiwan will
continue to fortify the foundations of its existing relations
with that Central American country after leftist President-elect
Daniel Ortega comes to power Jan. 10.
</P>
<P>
Wang further said that President Chen Shui-bian will head for
Nicaragua Monday to attend Ortega's inauguration at the head of a
Taiwan delegation, which, according to the spokesman, will help
boost bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
Shortly after Ortega's electoral victory in November last year,
Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Hou Ching-shan visited Nicaragua
at the head of a working-level delegation  to hold talks  with
ministers-designate of the incoming Ortega administration, with
both parties agreeing to step up bilateral cooperation, Wang
added.
</P>
<P>
As Ortega said during the presidential campaign that if elected,
he would switch diplomatic recognition from Taipei to Beijing,
some media outlets have questioned the viability and
sustainability of Taiwan-Nicaragua ties after Ortega's
inauguration.
