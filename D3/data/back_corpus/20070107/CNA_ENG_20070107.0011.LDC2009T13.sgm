Premier Su Tseng-chang on Sunday thanked President Chen Shui-bian
for recognizing his performance, saying that all Cabinet members
will redouble efforts to promote various new policy initiatives.
</P>
<P>
Su made the remarks during an interview with reporters at the
Executive Yuan before heading for quake-stricken Pingtung County
in southern Taiwan to hear a briefing on relief operations.
</P>
<P>
The premier said that while working overtime at the Executive
Yuan a day earlier, he received a call from President Chen, who
wanted Su to pay heed to his clear, comprehensive words
concerning a media report that Su might be replaced prior to the
primary election of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)
to choose a candidate for the 2008 presidential race.
</P>
<P>
Chen dismissed the report by the mass-circulation United Daily
News that he intends to replace Su prior to the DPP's
presidential primaries in May. Noting that Premier Su and his
Cabinet team have performed well, the president stated
categorically that he "has no plan to replace Su at present."
</P>
<P>
According to the reports, sources familiar with the DPP claimed
that President Chen will treat the four DPP heavyweights aspiring
for the 2008 presidential race equally, and that he hopes they
will take part in the race from the same starting line. The four
bigwigs are the premier, DPP Chairman Yu Shyi-kun, Vice President
Annette Lu and former Premier Frank Hsieh.
</P>
<P>
Voicing his gratitude to the president for his praise for the
Cabinet's administrative performance, Su said his ruling team has
been working hard, including working overtime, to live up to
public expectations.
</P>
<P>
It is too early to touch on the 2008 presidential election, the
premier stressed, adding that the most important thing for the
Cabinet to do at the moment is step up various national
development projects.
</P>
<P>
Su also disclosed that the Executive Yuan team is planning to see
off the president at the airport when he leaves for Nicaragua
Monday to attend the inauguration of Nicaraguan President-elect
Daniel Ortega scheduled for Jan. 10.
</P>
<P>
According to Presidential Office Deputy Secretary-General Liu
Shih-fang, President Chen will stay overnight in San Francisco on
Jan. 8 before departing early the next day for Nicaragua.
</P>
<P>
For the return journey, Chen will transit in Los Angeles but only
stop long enough for the plane to refuel, Liu said, adding that
the president is scheduled to return to Taipei Jan. 12.
