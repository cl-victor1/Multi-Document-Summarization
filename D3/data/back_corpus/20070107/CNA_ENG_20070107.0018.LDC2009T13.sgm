KMT CAUCUS WILL RETURN PATRIOT-III BUDGET PROPOSAL TO MND:
LAWMAKER
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  Jan.  7 (CNA) 01/07/07  19:16:22 (By Luis Huang)

The legislative caucus of the opposition Kuomintang (KMT) said
Sunday that it will send a draft budget plan for procuring six
Patriot PAC-III anti-missile batteries from the United States
back to the Ministry of National Defense (MND) for revisions.
</P>
<P>
Tsai Chin-lung, secretary-general of the KMT legislative caucus,
made the remarks in response to a media report that military
authorities  are hoping the opposition camp will "freeze" the
procurement budget rather than return it to the MND, thereby
giving the budget a chance to survive during the Legislative
Yuan's next session.
</P>
<P>
"We will not accept a proposal to freeze the budget for Patriot
PAC-III anti- missile batteries procurement instead of returning
it to the MND, because [such a measure] would be illegitimate,"
Tsai said during an interview with reporters.
</P>
<P>
According to related regulations, the government's plan to
procure the Patriot PAC-III anti-missile batteries -- which
failed to win voter support in a 2004 referendum -- should not be
discussed within three years of holding a referendum.
</P>
<P>
Noting the next legislative session is scheduled to convene Feb.
27, Tsai said the MND can draft another list for a supplementary
budget in military procurement and submit it to the legislature
for review.
</P>
<P>
However, Tsai also questioned why the MND had released such a
message prior to the expiration of a three-year limitation on re-
opening discussion on that procurement plan.
</P>
<P>
"Is the purchase of these anti-missile batteries so urgent for
Taiwan? " he asked. If the MND is pushing for the procurement due
to pressure by U.S. arms dealers, the KMT caucus will strongly
oppose it, he added.
