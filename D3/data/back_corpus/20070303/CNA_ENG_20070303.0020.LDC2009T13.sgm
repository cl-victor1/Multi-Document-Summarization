MOEA TO CONTINUE TO WORK TOWARD CHANGING NAME OF CHINA STEEL

Economic Affairs Minister Steve Ruey-long Chen said Saturday that
changing the name of China Steel Corp. is difficult, although the
ministry will continue to push for the change.
</P>
<P>
Chen noted that China Steel Corp. is a listed company, with
foreign investors holding 32 percent of the company's stakes,
compared with the government's holding of just 22 percent of its
shares.
</P>
<P>
But since changing the name is a government policy, the Ministry
of Economic Affairs (MOEA) ,  which is the largest government
shareholder, will continue to ask China Steel Corp. to complete
the name change as soon as possible  in conformity  with related
regulations.
</P>
<P>
Chen made the remarks after several state-owned enterprises
changed their names in line with the government's "name
rectification" campaign, which it claims is being carried out to
"avoid confusion" with similarly named counterparts in China.
</P>
<P>
After three Taiwanese state-owned enterprises -- Taiwan Post Co.
(originally Chunghwa Post Co.), CPC Corp. Taiwan (originally
Chinese Petroleum Corp.) and CSBC Corp., Taiwan (originally China
Shipbuilding Corp.) -- recently removed the words "China" or
"Chinese" from their official titles and added "Taiwan" to
underscore that they are Taiwanese companies, President Chen
Shui-bian urged China Steel Corp. early this week to follow suit.
</P>
<P>
Steve Ruey-long Chen also said that non-profit institutional
organizations under the MOEA and its affiliated agencies will be
the next targets for name changes.
</P>
<P>
He said that if the organizations  fall under the direct
supervision of the MOEA and the MOEA has assigned most of the
board directors, then the ministry will review them on a case-by-
case basis.
</P>
<P>
At present, out of 26 such organizations set up by subsidies of
the MOEA, only China Productivity bears the word "China," while
many others use the names of "Republic of China" or "Taiwan."
