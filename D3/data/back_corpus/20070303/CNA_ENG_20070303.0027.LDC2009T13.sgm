Taipei Mayor Hau Lung-bin announced Saturday that the city
government will speed up its urban renovation projects in order
to bring a new look to Taipei City in his four-year term to
"change people's false impressions" about the city government's
renovation affairs.
</P>
<P>
Hau made the announcement at a press conference held to celebrate
the third anniversary of the establishment of the city's Urban
Redevelopment Office.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the efforts of the Urban Redevelopment Office, Hau
expressed hope that the projects will receive the full
participation of all Taipei residents, describing this as a
crucial factor in a city's competitiveness.
</P>
<P>
Hau said the city government will start with major projects on
strategic improvements of public space and buildings to allow
people see the city government's efforts in urban renewal in the
shortest possible time.
</P>
<P>
The city government will ensure that it offers powerful and
helpful administrative procedures to make sure the urban renewal
projects go smoothly, and will hold meetings every month to
examine the progress made.
