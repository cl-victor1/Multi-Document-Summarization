Taipei,  March 3 (CNA) 03/03/07  16:47:19 (By Lilian Wu)

<P>
President Chen Shui-bian encouraged CSBC Corp., Taiwan to work
toward greater heights Saturday during a plaque-unveiling
ceremony for the renamed state-owned company.
</P>
<P>
Chen, accompanied by Premier Su Tseng-chang, CSBC Chairman Lu
Feng-hai and Minister of Economic Affairs Steve Ruey-long Chen,
presided over the name- changing ceremony to formally shed its
original name of China Shipbuilding Corp. (CSBC).
</P>
<P>
Chen said that the name-change is not out of "ideological"
concerns and expressed hope that the new name will help revive
the company's past glories.
</P>
<P>
CSBC Corp. Taiwan is the latest in a series of state-owned
enterprises  that have changed their names recently under the
government's "name-rectification" campaign to remove the words
"China" or "Chinese" from its official titles and add "Taiwan" to
avoid confusion with the similarly named counterparts in China
and underscore Taiwan-centric consciousness by showing that they
are Taiwanese companies.
</P>
<P>
Chen noted that in 2000, CSBC posted losses of NT$6.7 billion
(US$203.03 million) and faced being closed down until then-
Minister of Economic Affairs Lin Hsin-i promoted a restructuring
plan for the company by laying off half of its employees and
slashing salaries by 35 percent for those who remained.
</P>
<P>
The government also augmented its capital by NT$3 billion and an
Executive Yuan fund pumped in NT$3.1 billion, which he said
helped the company back to its feet.
</P>
<P>
The company was able to operate in the black from 2002, reporting
a surplus of NT$1.49 billion last year, he added.
</P>
<P>
He lauded the CSBC for being a new business model after the
restructuring program, saying that it reported a net profit of
NT$200 million in January and is expected to reach NT$3 billion
by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
He also said the government is dedicated to economic development
and cutting unemployment, noting that it achieved an economic
growth of 4.62 percent last year and that the jobless rate was
cut to 3.79 percent in January.
</P>
<P>
"The public should have faith in Taiwan and in the performance of
the Cabinet under Su's leadership," he said.
</P>
<P>
With the recent name-changing of several state-owned enterprises
-- including Taiwan Post Co., from Chunghwa Post Co. and Chinese
Petroleum Corp. Taiwan from Chinese Petroleum Corp. -- the
president said that those enterprises that need to change their
names should not stall using excuses, saying that they have to
"insist on and implement Taiwan-centric consciousness."
</P>
<P>
CSBC Chairman Lu reported that orders placed with the company
extend to 2010 and that the orders are the fourth-largest in the
world, while in terms of shipbuilding volume, the 18th-largest.
