MAYOR
</HEADLINE>

In response to an Executive Yuan plan to dismantle the walls of a
major monument in downtown Taipei, Taipei Mayor Hau Lung-bin said
Saturday that the operation needs to be approved by the city
government.
</P>
<P>
Hau's remarks came after Ministry of Education gave its green
light Friday night to tear down the walls of the Chiang Kai-shek
(CKS) Memorial Hall in downtown Taipei and to rename the facility
the "Taiwan Democracy Park."
</P>
<P>
Education  Minister  Tu Cheng-sheng  said that the central
government's project to dismantle the walls of the monument is
aimed at making it more approachable for the public.
</P>
<P>
Stressing that the Executive Yuan needs to get approval from the
Taipei City Government  for its plan to pull down the walls
surrounding the Chiang Kai-shek Memorial Hall -- a major tourist
attraction and leisure area, Hau said that the municipal
authorities will have to bring related central government
officials to justice according to the law if it insists on going
ahead with the demolition without municipal approval.
</P>
<P>
The central government must not judge the issue from a political
point and the Executive Yuan must apply for a license from the
Taipei City Government for the projected move, Hau reiterated,
adding that the municipal government has to assess the possible
impact on the hall's surroundings in accordance with its overall
urban development program before deciding on whether to issue a
license.
</P>
<P>
President Chen Shui-bian said recently that the country must be
purged from the lingering remnants of the late President Chiang
Kai-shek and that the name of his memorial hall must be changed.
Chen also asked that Chiang's remains -- kept in a temporary
mausoleum in Tahsi township in northern Taoyuan County -- be
relocated to a military cemetery on the outskirts of Taipei.
</P>
<P>
Along with two other state-owned companies, Chunghwa Post Co.,
Taiwan's state- run postal service provider, was renamed the
Taiwan Post Co. in January as part of the government's name
"rectification" campaign.
</P>
<P>
Former main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Ma Ying-jeou
urged the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) to stop
fanning the flames of the ethnic row by rehashing these
ideological issues.
</P>
<P>
Ma, who announced his presidential ambition after stepping down
from the party's chairmanship last month, pledged to revive
Taiwan's economy if elected president.
</P>
<P>
Legislative caucus members of the opposition People First Party
(PFP) accused the DPP at a Legislative Yuan news conference of
stoking social confrontation by seeking to tear down the walls of
the memorial hall.
</P>
<P>
PFP lawmaker Chang Hsien-yao warned Premier Su Tseng-chang that
he risks violating the law if he decides to order the demolition
to go ahead.
</P>
<P>
Neither the Executive Yuan nor the Ministry of Education are
entitled to decide to dismantle the walls without permission from
the local government, Chang argued.
</P>
<P>
"Su would lose the chance of contending the 2008 presidential
election if he is indicted and convicted for illegally pulling
down the walls," he warned.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a spokesman for the Taipei Urban Planning Commission
said that relevant officials could be fined up to NT$300,000 and
given jail terms of up to six months should the central
government determine to demolish the walls without municipal
approval.
</P>
<P>
If the Executive Yuan wants to transform the Chiang Kai-shek
Memorial Hall into the "Taiwan Democracy Park, " the zoning for
the compound must be altered in line with the city's urban
development planning, the spokesman said, adding that it also
must get a license from the Taipei City Government.
