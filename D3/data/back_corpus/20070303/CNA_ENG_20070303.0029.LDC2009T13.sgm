Facing the challenges of globalization, preserving cultural
diversity should be Taiwan's priority, a French official said in
a conference Saturday.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, contrary to what most people think, France is
not resisting globalization, according to Jean-Claude Poimboeuf,
director of the French Institute in Taipei, in the conference
titled "Globalization: How Do the French Do It?"
</P>
<P>
"The uniqueness and the richness of Taiwan is precisely its
cultural diversity, " Poimboeuf said. He pointed out that Taiwan
is a mix of Chinese and Japanese heritage, the cultural influence
of the U.S. and local cultures, including Hoklo, Hakka and
indigenous cultures, adding that France has likewise absorbed
influences from other European countries.
</P>
<P>
Cultural diversity is what makes Taiwan unique in Asia and why
Taiwan should preserve it. "You are the result of this unique
combination," he said.
</P>
<P>
On how French deal with globalization, Poimboeuf admitted that
France is sometimes perceived as a country that fears
globalization and is seen by many as unable or unwilling to adapt
to change as a declining power. This "oversimplified view" is far
from the actual France, he said.
</P>
<P>
"France is aware that it is a major actor and beneficiary of
globalization... and has also its own strong view on how
globalization impacts the planet, " he said.
</P>
<P>
To meet the challenge of globalization, France places emphasis on
its education, he said. The French education system asks students
to learn at least two foreign languages to prepare for the world
and puts strong emphasis on science, engineering and technology.
</P>
<P>
Spreading the use of the Internet is also one of the keys, he
added.
</P>
<P>
The conference was part of the Taipei Salon, organized by the
Lung Ying-tai Foundation.
