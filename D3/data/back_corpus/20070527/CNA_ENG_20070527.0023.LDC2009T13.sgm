NCC MEMBERS MAY RESIGN EARLY IF LAWMAKERS FAIL TO REVISE LAW SOON

Taipei,   May  27  (CNA) 05/27/07  22:35:04 (By Sofia Wu)

<P>
The commissioners  of the National Communications Commission
(NCC) said Sunday they may resign early if lawmakers continue to
drag their heels over revising the NCC Organic Law to meet
relevant constitutional requirements.
</P>
<P>
They issued the statement after the often rowdy Legislative Yuan
failed again Friday to pass a draft bill amending Article 4 of
the NCC Organic Law that the Council of Grand Justices (CGJ) had
ruled as "unconstitutional."
</P>
<P>
The CGJ said in its July 21, 2006 ruling that the stipulation
concerning the selection of NCC members in accordance with the
ratio of seats each party holds in the legislature  violates  the
constitutional provision of division of power. Therefore, the
ruling said the NCC Organic Law should be revised before Dec. 31,
2008; otherwise, it will lose validity.
</P>
<P>
The nine NCC members have since repeatedly pushed the legislature
to revise the organic law accordingly to facilitate the selection
of new commissioners in line with new provisions that comply with
constitutional requirements.
</P>
<P>
Although the CGJ sets Dec. 31, 2008 as the current NCC's "sunset"
deadline, the NCC members have offered to resign en masse Jan.
31, 2008 which is also the expiry date of the current
legislature.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, the NCC members said Sunday they may resign before
the tenure of the current legislature expires if lawmakers of
different political stripes fail to come to terms on the
revisions of the law during its present session which will be
extended to June 15.
</P>
<P>
According to the NCC members, the current session is most
befitting to deal with the law revision issues. If the draft
amendment package fails to clear the legislature during the
current session, they said, chances for the package to be passed
before the present legislature expires might be slim.
</P>
<P>
As the last session of the current legislature, which will open
in September, is very close to the year-end legislative election,
the NCC members said, most lawmakers will be preoccupied with
their re-election campaign and may have little interest in
working out their differences over the new provisions for
selection of NCC members.
