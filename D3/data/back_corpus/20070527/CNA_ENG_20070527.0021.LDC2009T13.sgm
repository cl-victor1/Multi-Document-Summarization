President Chen Shui-bian said Sunday that he looks forward to
seeing a freeway built for the convenience of residents in
eastern Taiwan, so long as the construction project will not have
an adverse ecological and environmental impact.
</P>
<P>
Chen made the remarks while presiding over a maritime anti-hijack
exercise organized by the Coast Guard Administration at the port
of Suao in the northeastern county of Yilan.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the opening of the Peiyi Freeway substantially cuts
travel time from Taipei to Yilan County and expressed hope that a
similar freeway can be built to link the eastern county of
Hualien to Suao.
