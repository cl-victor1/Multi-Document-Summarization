The county government on the outlying island of Penghu will push
for listing local "vegetable houses" as cultural heritage items,
county officials said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"Vegetable houses" refer to local farms that use short walls to
resist the strong northeast monsoon wind to protect fruit and
vegetables, the officials explained.

<P>
The special houses are unique to Penghu, the officials said,
while adding that their numbers are decreasing as the island
county moves toward modernization.
