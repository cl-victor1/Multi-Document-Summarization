A dozen "life warriors" who have won the "Global Love for Life"
award over the past several years for their perseverance in
overcoming life's challenges planted seedlings on Taiwan's
outlying island of Kinmen Sunday as a gesture symbolizing sowing
seeds of hope for the world.

<P>
Among the "life warriors" was Haregewoin Teferra, known as
"Africa's Mother Theresa" for her compassionate devotion to the
poor and needy in Africa, who was one of the 10 recipients of the
2007 "Global Love for Life" award sponsored by the Chou Ta-kuan
Cultural and Educational Foundation, according to foundation
founder Chou Chin-hua.
</P>
<P>
Other "life warriors" who have won the award over the past
several years who joined the tour to Kinmen included Hsu Che, an
110-year-old lady from Singapore and the "wheelchair phoenix"
from China, Liang Yi.

Addressing the seedling-planting event, Kinmen Magistrate Lee
Chu-feng said Kinmen is proud to host the 2007 presentation
ceremony of the "Global Love for Life" award and said the
seedlings will become a Kinmen landmark bearing extraordinary
significance.

Prior to the seedling-planting, Teferra, who had traveled from
Ethiopia to accept the award, was presented with a check for
NT$100,000 by a private charity organization in Taiwan as a token
of appreciation for Teferra's strenuous efforts in the fight
against AIDS/HIV.
