Straits Exchange Foundation Chairman Chang Chun-hsiung was mum
Saturday on reports that he will soon return to the premier's
post following the resignation of Su Tseng-chang earlier in the
day.
</P>
<P>
Pressed by reporters about whether he will take over the
premiership, Chang was low-keyed, saying only, "I think I can't
answer your question."
</P>
<P>
Outgoing Premier Su, who suffered a surprise loss in the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party's (DPP's) presidential primary May
6, announced his resignation Saturday, saying that he would step
aside to allow President Chen Shui-bian a free hand in dealing
with the changed political situation during the last year of his
tenure. Chen's term will expire on May 20, 2008. Former Premier
Frank Hsieh is set to be nominated by the DPP to run in the 2008
presidential election after winning the primary.
</P>
<P>
President Chen said later in the day that he would name a new
premier as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
Chang, Chen's campaign manager when he was running for the
presidency in 2000, served as premier between 2000 and 2002.
</P>
<P>
He later served as an adviser to the president  and DPP
secretary-general. He has served as chairman of the SEF, the
nation's highest China policy planning agency, since 2005.
</P>
<P>
Analysts have said that Chang is a person that president Chen can
trust given his solid political background as well as his long-
term friendship with the president.
