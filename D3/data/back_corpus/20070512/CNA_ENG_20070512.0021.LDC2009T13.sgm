Taipei,  May 12 (CNA) 05/12/07  18:00:52 (By Maubo Chang)
</P>
<P>
President Chen Shui-bian said Saturday that he will name a new
premier as soon as possible in the wake of the resignation of Su
Tseng-chang earlier in the day.
</P>
<P>
In a hastily called news conference at the Presidential Office,
Chen said he will take into account the overall political
situation at home before naming a new premier to take the reins
of his administration for the remainder of his tenure.
</P>
<P>
Chen  said he accepted  Su's resignation  with reluctance,
understanding that Su wanted to give him a free hand in dealing
with the new political situation after former premier Frank Hsieh
won the May 6 Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) presidential
primary.
</P>
<P>
He praised the outgoing premier for his decisions to drop out of
the race for DPP presidential nomination after conceding defeat
in the party members' vote and to throw his weight behind Hsieh.
</P>
<P>
Chen also listed Su's achievements in his 16-month tenure as
premier, notably helping the administration weather crises
prompted by demonstrations organized by the president's political
foes with the purpose of bringing down Chen's administration last
year and the financial crisis triggered by the collapse of the
China Rebar Co. early this year.
</P>
<P>
Despite of these crisis, Chen said the administration under the
leadership of Su has managed to record an economic growth rate of
4.6 percent for 2006 while brining down the unemployment rate to
3.9 percent and balancing the government budget for the first
time in eight years.
</P>
<P>
Chen also accredited Su for last year's launch of the Hsuehshan
Tunnel, the masterpiece of the expressway linking Taipei and
Yilan, last year and the inauguration of the Taiwan High Speed
Rail earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
Su was the fifth premier named by Chen during his seven years in
office.
