Taipei,  May  12  (CNA) 05/12/07  17:35:29 (By Elizabeth Hsu)

A legislator of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)
urged Minister of National Defense Lee Jye, his deputy Chu Kai-
sheng, and Chief of the General Staff Huo Shou-yeh to step down
Saturday to honor the government's and military's pledge to
prepare and carry out safe and damage-free military exercises.

<P>
Legislator Hsueh Ling made the call after the Ministry of
National Defense (MND) announced the Hang Kuang 23 military
exercises will be performed May 15 as scheduled, despite the
crash of an Air Force F-5F jet fighter in Hsinchu County Friday
during a rehearsal for the drill.

The accident caused the death of the pilot and co-pilot, as well
as two Singaporean troops on the ground at a military base
housing Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) personnel stationed on the
island as part of the SAF's "unilateral training" program. A
further nine Singaporean soldiers were injured in the crash.

Two of the injured suffered serious burns and were rushed to the
Tri-Service General Hospital in Taipei. On Saturday, sources said
the wounded have already been discharged from the hospital. An
earlier report from the Singaporean Ministry of Defence said that
the SAF dispatched a five-member medical team Friday to Taiwan to
tend to the wounded.

Hsueh said the MND has to guarantee that no accidents will occur
in the upcoming drills. She also called for the passage of the
government's arms purchase budget bills at the Legislative Yuan
so that the military can replace out-dated weapons, including
submarines and anti-submarine aircraft.
