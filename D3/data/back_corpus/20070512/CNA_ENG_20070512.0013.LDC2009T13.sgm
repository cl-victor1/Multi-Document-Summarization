The ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) is gearing up this
weekend to solicit greater public support for a campaign
demanding that the main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) return its
"ill-gotten" party assets.
</P>
<P>
According to DPP officials, the party will set up booths in
cities and counties across the country to win further public
endorsement of its campaign this Saturday and Sunday.

At the booth erected on the plaza in front of the Taipei Railway
Station, carnations will be presented to people who sign the
petition, DPP official said.

As of Friday, the DPP had collected over 750,000 signatures for
the campaign, and the party predicts that it may hit the target
for the second-phase, one- million signatures, in June or July,
meaning that a referendum may be held to allow the public have a
say on the issue.
