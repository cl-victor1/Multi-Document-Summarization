PREMIER QUITS TO LEAVE ROOM FOR DPP PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: TSU

Taipei,  May  12  (CNA) 05/12/07  17:36:27 (By Flor Wang)

Su Tseng-chang's resignation from the premier's post could be
intended to create more room for the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party's (DPP)  presidential candidate to exercise his
leverage, lawmakers of the opposition Taiwan Solidarity Union
(TSU) said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
TSU lawmakers made the comments after Su announced his surprise
resignation from premiership in an Executive Yuan news conference
earlier the same day. Collectively, the TSU and ruling DPP form
the "pan-green camp, " which is opposed by the "pan-blue
alliance" of the Kuomintang (KMT) and People First Party (PFP) in
Taiwan's polarized politics.
</P>
<P>
Su said that he decided to quit after having served in the post
for nearly 16 months, to accommodate President Chen Shui-bian's
need to deal with the current political situation.
</P>
<P>
The departing premier, Vice President Annette Lu and DPP Chairman
Yu Shyi-kun lost the ruling party's presidential primary to
former Premier Frank in a vote by party members May 6.
</P>
<P>
TSU lawmakers, including Lo Chih-ming and Liao Pen-yen, also
rebutted speculation that Su's resignation has anything to do
with former President Lee Teng-hui's recent remarks blaming the
Executive Yuan for the failure of the 2007 central government
budget bill, which has been stonewalled for more than five months
in the Legislative Yuan.
</P>
<P>
According to Lo, Su's stepping down could be due to an intention
to form a Hsieh-Su ticket for the 2008 presidential election.
Doing so would allow former Vice Premier Yeh Chu-lan, who
supports Hsieh's presidential bid, to take over the premiership
to better help with Hsieh's presidential campaign, he said.
</P>
<P>
Echoing Lo's viewpoint, Liao said that Su's decision to quit
could be designed to make way for Hsieh's camp as the
presidential election approaches. But Liao disagreed with the
idea that Su is interested in becoming Hsieh's running mate.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, most of the DPP lawmakers aligned with Hsieh's camp
refused to comment on Su's resignation, saying only that the
viewpoints of the president and Hsieh must be fully respected.
</P>
<P>
DPP lawmaker Tsao Lai-wang, who backs Hsieh in his pursuit of the
presidency, declined to comment on a possible Hsieh-Su ticket and
stressed that the question is up to Hsieh.
</P>
<P>
In response to Su's resignation news, KMT legislative caucus whip
Hsu Shao-ping said that Su should have been replaced since
becoming "toothless" upon assuming premiership. "But now, no
matter whoever is to replace Su, he or she can hardly do a good
job," Hsu said.
</P>
<P>
PFP spokesman Lee Hung-chun criticized the DPP for being "good at
spoiling" political appointees and for turning a blind eye to the
proper functioning of the nation's various mechanisms. "Over the
past seven years, we have had six premiers replaced," he said.
</P>
<P>
In fact, since the President Chen was elected in 2000, Su was the
fifth premier.
