Taipei,  May 12 (CNA) 05/12/07  18:41:32 (By Lilian Wu)

<P>
Half of the Ministry of Economic Affairs' budget appropriated for
assisting business this year will go to small- and medium-sized
enterprises, Minister Steve R. J. Chen said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Chen made the remarks while attending a meeting of the National
Association of Small &amp; Medium Enterprises in Taitung, eastern
Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Chen noted that Taiwan's sound economic development, as well as
its coming out of the Asian financial crisis unscathed, can be
attributed to such enterprises, which account for 80 percent of
the nation's businesses.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the government has always attached great importance
to the small- and medium-sized enterprises, and this is why
premier Su Tseng-chang announced three measures in his "mega
investment" project -- encouragement for those Taiwan businessmen
who have not fared well in China to return to Taiwan, help for
small and medium enterprises to upgrade, and help for floundering
small and medium enterprises to be back on their feet.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the concerns of small- and medium-size enterprises on
the minimum wage hike, which the Council of Labor Affairs has
suggested a level of between 7.5 percent and 9.5 percent, Chen
said he will "heed" their concerns.
