Washington,  May  11 (CNA) 05/12/07  15:43:19 (By Jorge Liu and

U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services Mike Leavitt wrote to
the World Health Organization (WHO) Friday to express U.S.
support for Taiwan's participation in the World Health Assembly
(WHA) as an observer, Taiwan's representative to the United
States said.
</P>
<P>
In the letter addressed to WHO Director-General Margaret Chan,
Leavitt also urged the WHO to allow Taiwan to take part in
technical-level meetings under the framework of the International
Health Regulations and join the Global Outbreak Alert and
Response Network, according to Joseph Wu during an informal
gathering with Chinese-language media in Washington D.C.
</P>
<P>
Wu said the development indicates that the United States remains
supportive of Taiwan's meaningful participation in WHO
activities, although Washington does not support the country's
move to apply to become a full member of the WHO this year.
</P>
<P>
Wu noted that he has visited the administrative branch and
Congress over the past month to seek their support for Taiwan's
WHO bid, and that almost all Congress members have expressed
support for Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Early this month, 24 members of the U.S. House of Representatives
wrote to the European Union to urge the union to support Taiwan's
bid to take part in the WHA as an observer, he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
The annual WHA -- the WHO's highest decision-making body -- is
scheduled to take place May 14-23 in Geneva.
