LABOR INSURANCE TO BE TRANSFORMED INTO MONTHLY PAYMENT SCHEME
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Taipei, May 12 (CNA) 05/12/07  18:18:26 (By Sofia Wu)
</P>
<P>
The Executive Yuan has approved a package of draft amendments to
the Labor Insurance Law which, if enacted, will transform the
labor pension system from the current lump-sum cash payment upon
retirement to a regular monthly payment, an official said
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
According to the Council of Labor Affairs-proposed amendment
package,  workers who have contributed to the country's labor
insurance program for more than 15 years will be eligible to
receive a monthly payment of at least NT$3,000 (US$91) when they
retire at the age of 60.
</P>
<P>
Minister-without-Portfolio Lin Wan-yi said the new labor pension
payment scheme is related to a proposed national pension act that
the Executive Yuan introduced last week.
</P>
<P>
"Both of the draft bills will be referred to the Legislative Yuan
soon for deliberation and approval, " Lin said, adding that the
government will promote these two systems simultaneously and tie
them to facilitate care for wage earners and disadvantaged groups
of people.
</P>
<P>
Lin said the new labor pension payment scheme can be implemented
in 2009, to the benefit of more than 8.66 million insured wage
earners.
</P>
<P>
According to Lin, the total monthly payment pension scheme will,
over time, provide double the support of a lump-sum payment
received upon retirement.
</P>
<P>
Those who join the labor insurance program before the monthly
payment system is in place will be allowed to choose either the
existing lump-sum payment scheme or opt for the new payment
scheme, Lin said, adding that those who join the labor insurance
program after the new system comes into force will only have the
latter available.
</P>
<P>
Under the package of draft amendments, the monthly premium will
be calculated at 6.5 percent of the employee's monthly salary for
the first two years of the scheme's implementation, with further
increase of 0.5 percent every two years thereafter until the
ceiling of 11 percent is reached.
</P>
<P>
Workers who pay monthly premiums for more than 15 years would be
entitled to receive monthly payment upon retirement at the age of
60. As to the amount of the payment, one of two formulas will be
available, Lin said.
</P>
<P>
The first formula provides 0.55 percent of the average monthly
salary covered by this program, multiplied by the total number of
insured years, plus NT$3,000.
</P>
<P>
The second formula provides 1.1 percent of average monthly salary
multiplied by the total number of insured years.
</P>
<P>
An insured worker would be guaranteed a minimum payment of
NT$3,000 a month regardless of which formula is chosen, Lin said,
adding that insured workers with fewer insured years would be
better off if they opt for the first formula, while those with
more insured years would find the second formula more favorable.
</P>
<P>
To galvanize people to work longer,  Lin said, the draft
amendments propose that an additional 4 percent of the total
amount calculated, using either formula, be paid for each year
the insured worker postpones his or her retirement, up to an
additional 20 percent.
