Despite Mandarin Airlines' reluctance to continue operating its
Taipei-Taichung route, the Civil Aeronautics Administration (CAA)
will ask the carrier to continue its flights for another month, a
CAA spokesman said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman made the remarks after Mandarin Airlines, the sole
carrier serving the Taipei-Taichung route, applied to the CAA
last month for its approval for the company to stop providing its
single daily flight between the two cities from March 1.
</P>
<P>
According to the spokesman, the Taipei-based carrier lost some
NT$30 million on the route last year, as its average passenger
load dropped from around 40 percent of previous years to 19
percent. He forecast that the situation will further deteriorate
with the full launch of the high-speed railway system Friday.
</P>
<P>
CAA  officials  acknowledged  Mandarin  Airlines'  operating
difficulties but said that it has asked the carrier to continue
providing its service for one more month. The CAA agreed to re-
assess the issue after the one-month observation period ends,
they added.
