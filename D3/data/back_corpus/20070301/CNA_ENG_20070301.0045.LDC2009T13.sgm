The Taipei city government has collaborated with a technology
company to recycle printer ink cartridges as part of efforts to
help save the endangered Taipei green tree frog in the northern
city, city officials said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
In March and April, Hewlett-Packard (HP) Co. will make donations
to the Chi Sing Eco-conservation Foundation after the public send
their used HP cartridges to designated recycling stations, the
officials said.
</P>
<P>
The foundation will use the donations to restore habitats for the
tree frogs in the capital city, the officials noted.
</P>
<P>
At present, the tree frogs can only be spotted in two parks in
the city, Taipei Mayor Hau Lung-bin said at a press conference.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the presence of the frogs is an important indicator
of environmental cleanliness, Hau claimed that the disappearance
of the frogs "would imply that the ecosystem has been seriously
degraded."
</P>
<P>
The city officials further said that the campaign will also be
promoted at the city's elementary schools.
