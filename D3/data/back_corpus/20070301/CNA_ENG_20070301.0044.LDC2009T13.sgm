FIGHT AGAINST SUPPRESSION UNDERLIES TAIWAN'S DEMOCRATIC
DEVELOPMENT
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  March 1 (CNA) 03/01/07  23:36:55 (By Sofia Wu)

A fight against human rights abuses and suppression by a despotic
government, rather than confrontation between Taiwanese, known as
benshenren, and immigrants from China after 1949, commonly known
as waishenren, characterize Taiwan's democratic development, Vice
President Annette Lu said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Lu made the remarks while attending a preview of an exhibition
set to open at a human rights memorial park in suburban Taipei
built on the site of a military detention house during Taiwan's
infamous martial law era.
</P>
<P>
The memorial park will be located at the site of the old Chingmei
military detention house which was under the jurisdiction of the
now defunct Taiwan Garrison Command during the martial law era.
Many noted prisoners of conscience were detained and tried at the
detention house, including Lu herself and several other prominent
pro-democracy figures involved in the Kaohsiung Incident of 1979.
</P>
<P>
During the roughly 38-year martial law era, Lu said 29,000
political persecution cases were documented, incriminating
140,000 victims, of whom more than 3,000 were executed.
</P>
<P>
According to Lu, two-thirds of the killed political prisoners
were Taiwanese and the remaining were "waishengren." Against this
backdrop, Lu said Taiwan's democratic development was not rooted
in ethnic confrontation, but rather in a fight against political
persecution  and  human  rights  suppression  by the previous
authoritarian Kuomintang government led by the late President
Chiang Kai-shek.
</P>
<P>
Lu said it is hoped that the opening of the new human rights
memorial park later this year will serve as a vivid reminder of
the importance of safeguarding Taiwan's hard-won freedom,
democracy and human rights.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan experienced martial law from May 20, 1949 through July 14,
1987, during which local people's basic freedoms, including
freedom of assembly, association and speech, were subject to
stringent control.
</P>
<P>
Martial law was lifted July 15, 1987, along with the bans on
setting up new media outlets and new political parties. The ban
on travel to China was also lifted for those with relatives on
the mainland.
</P>
<P>
The lifting of martial law set the stage for Taiwan's democratic
reform, leading eventually to the holding of the country's first
direct presidential election in 1996.
</P>
<P>
The government will sponsor a series of activities this year to
commemorate the 20th anniversary of the lifting of martial law.
