NICARAGUA FOREIGN AFFAIRS MINISTER TO VISIT TAIWAN LATE MARCH:
MOFA
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  March 1 (CNA) 03/01/07  16:55:18 (By Luis Huang)
</P>
<P>
Taiwan has invited Nicaraguan Minister of Foreign Affairs Samuel
Santos Lopez to visit the country at the head of a high-level
delegation in late March, an official with the Ministry of
Foreign Affairs (MOFA) announced Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Simon Ko, director-general of the MOFA's Department of Central
and South American Affairs, said at a routine news conference
that the purpose of Santo's upcoming visit is to discuss the
details of a cooperative project between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
According to Ko, Taiwan Foreign Affairs Minister James Huang and
his Nicaraguan counterpart signed a memorandum of understanding
(MOU) in January on cooperation in the Nicaraguan capital of
Managua while President Chen Shui-bian's was attending President
Daniel Ortega's inauguration.
</P>
<P>
The MOU seeks to promote direct foreign investment in high-tech
and high value- added products in Nicaragua and joint ventures
with Taiwan businesses, cooperation on water resources and health
issues, and upgrading the competitive edge of Nicaraguan products
at home and overseas.
</P>
<P>
If Santos can visit Taiwan later this month as scheduled, it will
his first official visit to the nation, Ko pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Noting that Nicaragua is one of Taiwan's major diplomatic allies
in Central America, Ko said that the government will also invite
Ortega to visit Taiwan in the near future to boost bilateral
relations.
</P>
<P>
Ko further said Chen's attendance at Ortega's inauguration was
vital to stepping up future cooperation ties between the two
countries. He went on that Taiwan will continue to help Nicaragua
promote its agricultural development and medical care.
</P>
<P>
Ortega, leader of the Sandinista National Liberation Front (SNLF)
who made the decision to sever diplomatic relations with Taiwan
at the start of his previous term in 1985, was elected to the
presidency in November last year, so the question of whether
there would be a change in bilateral diplomatic relations became
a focus of public attention.
</P>
<P>
Chen attended Ortega's inauguration Nov. 10 at the head of a
Taiwan delegation and met with his Nicaraguan counterpart to
discuss strengthening bilateral cooperation in the future, with
Ortega promising to maintain diplomatic relations with Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Asked about a media report that Saint Lucia might sever its
diplomatic ties with China after former Prime Minister John
Compton re-assumed his post following his party's victory in last
December's general elections, Ko said the new Santa Lucian primer
minister maintains good relations with Taiwan and that the MOFA
will spare no efforts to expand relations with that Caribbean
state.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan established diplomatic relations with Saint Lucia in 1984
when Compton was prime minister, but when Kenny Anthony came to
power in 1997, he switched diplomatic recognition from Taipei to
Beijing in late August of that year.
