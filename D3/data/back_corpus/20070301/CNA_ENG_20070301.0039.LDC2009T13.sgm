Taiwan inaugurated its first National Gravity Reference Station
in northern Hsinchu City Thursday, offering advanced observation
abilities to forecast earthquake and tsunami.
</P>
<P>
The station  --  equipped  with nano-level  superconductive
gravimeters   and wide-band   seismometers   and   other
environment-monitoring instruments -- can offer better
surveillance data over tectonic micro-shifts and minute changes
in the Earth's gravity, officials from the Industrial Technology
Research Institute (ITRI) said.
</P>
<P>
Officials from the Hsinchu city government, the Ministry of the
Interior (MOI) and the ITRI attended the inauguration ceremony
held at the station, located on Shihpachienshan, a mountain in
Hsinchu County.
</P>
<P>
The MOI-administered station has filed membership applications
with the International Absolute Gravity Base Station Network
(IAGBN) and the Global Geodynamic Project (GCP) -- both
organizations that aim to monitor changes in global gravity, MOI
officials said.
</P>
<P>
Government agencies initialed the project to establish the
station in 2003 and chose the site in 2004, after several rounds
of reviews and evaluations. Construction began in 2004 and was
completed late last year. After several months of assessment of
the equipment, the station achieved full operation in February.
