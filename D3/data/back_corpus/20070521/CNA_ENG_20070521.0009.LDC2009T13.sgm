MOE TO FILE APPEAL IF FINED OVER MEMORIAL HALL DISPUTE
</HEADLINE>

Taipei, May 21 (CNA) 05/21/07  12:32:06 (By Sofia Wu)

The Ministry of Education (MOE) will file an appeal if it is
slapped with a fine by the Taipei City government over the
contentious renaming of a memorial dedicated to the late
President Chiang Kai-shek as the "National Taiwan Democracy
Memorial Hall," an official said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Chu Nan-hsien, director of the MOE's Social Education Department,
made the remarks after Lee Yung-ping,  director  of the city
government's Cultural Affairs Department, said the day before
that her department has handed a fine of NT$100,000 to the
"Chiang Kai-shek (CKS) Memorial Hall" Administration for failure
to remove the canvas blocking the name plate of the hall and the
two giant banners on the hall's wall.
</P>
<P>
Lee said that the notice for the cloth's removal was issued
Saturday evening and that the fine was handed out Sunday
afternoon. Successive fines will be levied for violating
provisions of the Cultural Assets Preservation Law if the hall's
administration, which is under the MOE's jurisdiction, fails to
take action, she added.
</P>
<P>
After learning in April of the MOE's redesignation plan, the
opposition Kuomintang-controlled  city  government  rushed  to
provisionally designate the hall as a heritage site pending an
assessment by a panel of experts and scholars.
</P>
<P>
No tampering of the site's architectural structure and decoration
is allowed before a final ruling is handed down, Lee claimed.
</P>
<P>
In response, Chu said he sees nothing illegal in "putting
clothes" on the National Taiwan Democracy Memorial Hall. If the
city government insists on its stance, Chu said, the MOE will
appeal the case after receiving the fine.
</P>
<P>
As part of his administration's campaign to rectify the names and
symbols of public buildings to be more in line with the local
Taiwanese culture and Taiwan- centric consciousness, President
Chen Shui-bian presided over the CKS memorial hall redesignation
ceremony Saturday amid protests from KMT supporters.
</P>
<P>
During a visit in the southern port city of Kaohsiung, Chen told
reporters that relevant government agencies will lock the main
gate of the renamed memorial so that people will not see the
giant bronze statute of Chiang whom he branded as a dictator.
</P>
<P>
The military guards for the hall, who perform a change of guard
ceremony every two hours, will also be removed, Chen said. As to
the planned disposal of Chiang's statute, Chen said he has
directed relevant government agencies to come up with detailed
blueprints or suggestions.
