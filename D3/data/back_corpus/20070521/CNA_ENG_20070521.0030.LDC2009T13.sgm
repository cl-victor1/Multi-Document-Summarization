ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION, ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT RELATED: PRESIDENT

Taipei, May 21 (CNA) 05/21/07  21:22:06 (By Lilian Wu)

President Chen Shui-bian said Monday that environmental
protection should not be taken out of the context of the overall
economic development of the nation.
</P>
<P>
Chen stressed that environmental protection issues are of equal
importance to economic development. However he said some
environmental activists have deemed major economic development
projects "evil" in that they will destroy the environment, but
added that they should think not only of removing all evils to
the environment but should "think of creating benefits."
</P>
<P>
In a speech delivered at the annual congress of the Taipei-based
Chinese National Association of Industry and Commerce, he also
said that benefits should be offered in exchange for the
resolution of environmental problems.
</P>
<P>
He said that environmental protection problem must be viewed from
the perspective of an emerging industry. He cited as an example
that the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions could be dealt
with through increasing the ratio of recycling energy.
</P>
<P>
Chen said that if major construction projects adopt far stricter
criteria in terms of environmental protection and greenhouse gas
emissions, but are then dismissed because they still emit
greenhouse gases, then it is an issue to be addressed to.
</P>
<P>
He noted that if the environmental protection adopts too strict
criteria, manufacturers will simply go to other countries such as
China where environmental protection criteria are lower.
</P>
<P>
In that case, Taiwan will have to import related products and the
greenhouse gases will not decrease but increase, he said. The
environmental issue will not be solved, Taiwan's industrial
development will be hampered and the job market impacted, he
added, questioning if it is "appropriate" to adopt such a policy.
</P>
<P>
Chen's address came as several major construction projects,
including a petrochemical plant, a refinery plant, the Shuhua
freeway linking Suao and Hualien in eastern Taiwan and a thermal
power plant are undergoing environmental assessment.
