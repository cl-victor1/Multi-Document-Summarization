Taipei, May 21 (CNA) 05/21/07  19:38:03 (By Maubo Chang)

<P>
New Premier Chang Chun-hsiung, who was sworn in Monday morning in
a ceremony at the Presidential Office, vowed to serve "as a
bridge over trouble waters" in his new post
</P>
<P>
Speaking after receiving the official seal of office from his
predecessor, Su Tseng-chang, in a ceremony at the Executive Yuan
mid-morning Monday, Chang noted that many vital bills have
stalled in the opposition-controlled Legislative Yuan, not the
least the central government's 2007 budget bill and the arms
procurement bill, because of the partisan bickering between the
ruling and opposition camps.
</P>
<P>
Chang said that these bills being bogged down in the legislature
represents "troubled waters" that his administration must cross
in the remaining year of President Chen Shui-bian's term.
</P>
<P>
Warning that endless partisan quarreling in the legislature will
cost the country, the premier said he will reach out to the
Legislative Yuan and "replace confrontation with cooperation" in
terms of relations with the opposition parties.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Chang said he will work to bind the members of
the new Cabinet together to work at full steam.
</P>
<P>
Chang, who served as premier between 2000 and 2002 during
President Chen's first term, was named as the new premier May 14
to replace Su Tseng-chang, who resigned after being defeated in
the ruling  Democratic  Progressive  Party's (DPP's)  primary
for presidential election.
</P>
<P>
His first term as premier ended in January 2002, shortly after
the DPP failed to perform as well as expected in the legislative
elections held at the end of 2001.
