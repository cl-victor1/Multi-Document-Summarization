TAIWAN NEEDS ANOTHER EIGHT YEARS TO DEEPEN DEMOCRACY: PRESIDENT
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taipei,  May 21 (CNA) 05/21/07  08:26:41 (By Sofia Wu)
</P>
<P>
President Chen Shui-bian has renewed a call to write a new
constitution for Taiwan and reaffirmed his commitment to amend
the Referendum Law to materialize the ideals of popular
sovereignty while stressing that Taiwan needs eight more years to
deepen its democratic system.
</P>
<P>
Chen made the remarks in a speech delivered Sunday at the
conclusion of a forum on Taiwan's transition of power, organized
by Ketagalan Institute, a school founded by Chen to nurture a new
generation of leaders in public services, to mark the seventh
anniversary of his presidential inauguration.
</P>
<P>
In his address, Chen reviewed developments in the past seven
years and outlined his priority agenda for the coming year. Chen
assumed the presidency May 20, 2000, ending the Kuomintang's
(KMT's) 55-year grip on power.
</P>
<P>
While the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) has achieved much in
its first two terms, Chen said the divisive pressures stemming
from national identity remain unsolved.
</P>
<P>
"Many of our country's problems lie in the polarization of
national identification,  which  could  be attributed  to the
longstanding authoritarian rule and the illusory 'Greater China'
ideology that prevailed during the KMT administration, " Chen
explained.
</P>
<P>
In contrast, Chen said, the DPP administration has insisted on
going down the road of democracy and the road of Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
"It's a bumpy road, but as a young democracy, we are not doing
too bad. Generally speaking, peace, democracy, Taiwan identity,
balanced development and cultural diversity are the most obvious
results we have achieved over the past seven years," Chen said.
</P>
<P>
While the DPP will have been in power for eight years as of next
May, Chen said Taiwan needs at least eight more years to
consolidate its democracy.
</P>
<P>
"There is still much room for improvement. My two four-year terms
are definitely not sufficient. We need another eight years to
further deepen our democracy," he added.
</P>
<P>
Touting the achievements made over the past seven years, Chen
said he was glad that he has managed to maintain peace in the
Taiwan Strait,  cement  the country's  democratic  system,
reinforce Taiwan-centric consciousness and narrow gaps in north-
south and urban-rural developments.
</P>
<P>
On the establishment of a diverse industrial structure, Chen said
Taiwan now has three flourishing science-based industrial parks
-- the Hsinchu Science Park in northern Taiwan, the Central
Taiwan Science Park in Taichung and the Southern Taiwan Science
Park in Tainan.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Chen said, Taiwan now has two "trillion dollar
industries" -- semiconductors and liquid-crystal-display  (LCD)
panels. The LCD-panel industry, in particular, developed from
scratch with the DPP administration's assistance, Chen said,
adding that local LCD-panel makers now command an over-40 percent
share of the global market.
</P>
<P>
On the issue of cross-strait peace, Chen said opposition parties
had claimed in the run-up to the 2000 presidential election that
a war would break out if he were elected president, but that
nothing as serious as the 1996 missile crisis happened over the
past seven years.
</P>
<P>
On deepening  Taiwan's  young  democracy,  Chen  said  his
administration has completed the task of nationalizing the armed
forces in a short period of time and that the Referendum Law of
2003 has materialized the goal of direct democracy.
</P>
<P>
In the remaining year of his presidency, Chen said he will push
for amendments of the Referendum Law to lower legal thresholds
for the holding of referendums on issues of national concern. And
hastening the birth of a new constitution that is timely, viable
and relevant to Taiwan is his another goal in this regard, he
added.
