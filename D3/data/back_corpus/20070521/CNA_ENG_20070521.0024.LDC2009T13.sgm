BALL IN CHINA'S COURT REGARDING DIRECT CROSS-STRAIT FLIGHTS:
PRESIDENT

The problems blocking the launch of direct passenger flights
between Taiwan and China lies in China rather than Taiwan, Taiwan
President Chen Shui-bian said in an interview with the Singapore-
based Channel NewsAsia Monday.
</P>
<P>
In an advance copy of the transcript of the interview which is to
be broadcast Monday evening, Chen claimed that contrary to what
the public believe, economic exchanges between Taiwan and China
peaked during his seven years in office and this is evidence in
part by the direct charter flights across the strait for three
Chinese festivals launched last year.
</P>
<P>
However, the scheduled direct cargo flights vital for Taiwan
businessmen operating in China and China's lifting of a ban on
its people traveling to Taiwan as tourists -- which will make
passenger flights commercially necessary -- should take place
before scheduled direct passenger flights, he said.
</P>
<P>
Chen said the negotiations on Chinese tourism visits to Taiwan
were close to finalization when they collapsed over Beijing's
insistence  on depicting Taiwan as "China,  Taiwan" which was
unacceptable to Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
With only one year to go before the end of his term, the prospect
for the launch of the direct flights seems to be dim, but the
president said the problem, as well as its solution, lies in
China not Taiwan.
