The Public Prosecutor's Office in southern Tainan City took a man
into custody Thursday accused of illegally taking more than 240
teak trees from the Wushantou reservoir area in Tainan County.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the office said a prosecutor, supported by Tainan
County police, detained the leader of the illegal logging ring,
identified as Ho Lao-hsun, after summoning him and three other
suspects for questioning.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said the detention of Ho was necessary to prevent
collusion between him and the others in the ring while the
investigation was still continuing.
</P>
<P>
According to the spokesman, the loggers chopped down all the 60
-year-old teak trees in the area in about 10 days and sold them
to a timber processing factory in Liuchia township for more than
NT$10 million.
</P>
<P>
He said the illegal logging not only violated the Forest Law, but
seriously affected soil and water conservation of the Wushantou
reservoir.
</P>
<P>
Teak trees that are 20 to 30 years old are sought after by
builders and furniture makers not only because the wood is
beautiful, hard and durable, but also because the oil in the wood
is a natural repellent against termites.
