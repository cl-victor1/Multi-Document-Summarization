Taiwan's medical sector will help build a general hospital in the
Solomon Islands and will discuss posting a medical mission in the
South Pacific ally, a medical source in northern Taiwan's Hsinchu
City said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
A Hsinchu Hospital delegation, to be led by Superintendent Chang
Ching-nien, is scheduled to travel to Solomon Islands at the end
of May for a fact-finding trip on a plan to help upgrade and
expand Central Hospital -- the only major medical institution in
the South Pacific country, according to Chang.
</P>
<P>
Chang and his colleagues will also engage in talks with Solomon
Islands officials on Taiwan posting a regular medical mission
there, Chang said.

<P>
Solomon Islands Prime Minister Manasseh Sogavare, who is on a
week-long visit to Taiwan at the invitation of President Chen
Shui-bian, paid a visit to Hsinchu Hospital Thursday, making him
the first foreign leader to visit in the hospital's 100-year
history.
</P>
<P>
Under a Ministry of Foreign Affairs medical cooperation program,
Central Hospital is expected to be built into a major medical
institution benefiting all the island residents in the South
Pacific region, Chang told Sogavare.
