MILITARY CONDUCTS PARACHUTE DRILL AT HUKOU ARMY BASE
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  May 17 (CNA) 05/17/07  21:25:13 (By Sofia Wu)
</P>
<P>
Military personnel conducted a parachute drill at an army base in
the northern county of Hsinchu Thursday as part of the ongoing
live-fire Han Kuang 23 military exercise.
</P>
<P>
In the drill, military units mounted a coordinated operation
against a simulated Chinese airborne invasion at the Hukou army
base in Hsinchu County, about 90 km south of Taipei.
</P>
<P>
The maneuver was the third in a four-day series of live-fire war
games the military has conducted annually under the Han Kuang
moniker since 1984. The war games are designed to test the
military's combat readiness in the face of China's perennial
military threat.
</P>
<P>
Chief of the General Staff Hou Shou-yeh presided over the
parachute drill, in which a fleet of tanks, armored vehicles,
attack helicopters and hundreds of troops were mobilized to wipe
out Chinese paratroopers into the army base.
</P>
<P>
However, an airborne attack by fighters was canceled because of
rain. The drill was also delayed by rain for an hour.
</P>
<P>
Vice Defense Minister Ko Cheng-heng, who was on hand to observe
the proceedings, commended all participating military personnel
for their hard work. "Thanks to your strenuous efforts, the drill
proceeded smoothly and the results were satisfactory," he said.
</P>
<P>
Extensive anti-aircraft landing and airport defense drills were
also staged in the southern county of Pingtung that day.
</P>
<P>
Eight heavily laden F-16 fighters strafed marked targets with
rockets and bombs 10 km off the coast of Pingtung in a simulated
amphibious attack by China.
</P>
<P>
Fast boats fired ship-to-ship missiles at floating targets in a
test aimed at honing the armed forces' ability to "destroy the
enemy before they can land on the beaches," a military officer
said.
</P>
<P>
Super Cobra attack helicopters also launched rockets, while tanks
and artillery lobbed a volley of shells to stop the mock enemy
from landing.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile,  the armed forces  practiced  airport  defensive
strategies and measures at the Chiashan air base in the eastern
county of Hualien, where huge tunnels dug into a mountain are
designed to protect dozens of jets from intensive bombing should
war break out in the Taiwan Strait.
</P>
<P>
Military personnel also demonstrated their engineering skills in
repairing airstrips damaged by Chinese missile attacks in the
Chishan air base maneuver. The drill took place amid heavy rain.
</P>
<P>
A day earlier, the military mobilized some 2,000 troops in
different services to confront a simulated invasion from China in
Suao township in the northeastern county of Yilan.
</P>
<P>
The drill simulated a scenario in which Chinese forces had
crossed the Taiwan Strait and were ready to land. The air force,
the navy, the army and the marines formed a defense network to
repel the mock Chinese seaborne invasion along the isolated
stretch of the northeastern coast.
</P>
<P>
As top military brass looked on, a lethal array of Hawk, Stinger,
Chaparral and other missiles took out one invading vessel after
another and neutralized the jet aircraft that were backing them
up.
</P>
<P>
Mobile radar installations perched on a strategically located
hill helped direct the strikes, but some of the missiles failed
to explode or missed their intended targets.
</P>
<P>
Among others, a Hawk surface-to-air medium-range missile launched
by the army landed in a cemetery without exploding. The missile
was damaged but did not detonate and military personnel later
retrieved the failed ordnance. One MGM-51 Shillelagh anti-tank
guided missile fired by the marines lost control and fell into
the sea.
</P>
<P>
Military commanders expressed their frustration over the missile
failures during the exercise. They said a thorough review will be
conducted after the exercise to determine what went wrong. Some
military sources said the setback probably could be attributed to
the fact that they were too old.
</P>
<P>
That same day, a similar combined forces drill was also held at
Taichung Harbor in central Taiwan to test the military's combat
readiness in response to a mock invasion by Chinese special
forces.
</P>
<P>
More than 500 army, air force and marine personnel were mobilized
for the combat drill, as well as dozens of aircraft and combat
vehicles, missiles and artillery.
</P>
<P>
The troops honed various combat strategies and tactics in a
presumed scenario in which Chinese airborne and special forces
troops attempted to seize the Taichung port prior to an invasion.
</P>
<P>
The four-day live-fire Han Kuang 23 exercise began Tuesday with
six air force jet fighters -- two each of the U.S.-built F-16,
the French Mirage 2000-5 and the locally developed Indigenous
Defense Fighter -- practicing emergency landings and takeoffs on
a closed section of the Sun Yat-sen Freeway.
</P>
<P>
In the exercises, the F-16s were armed with advanced AIM-120 air-
to-air missiles  and the Mirages were equipped with MICA medium-
range air-to-air missiles, while IDFs were unarmed. It marked the
first time that the air force has publicly displayed its advanced
AIM-120 missiles.
</P>
<P>
The freeway landing scenario was developed to prepare the
military to deal with the possibility that local air bases would
be knocked out by Chinese aerial bombardment.
