Law enforcement agents raided two discount clothing stores in
Taipei County Thursday and seized large quantities of fake brand
name garments with a street value of NT$10 million (US$299,690).
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the Bureau of Investigation under the Ministry of
Justice said the agents raided the two stores in the cities of
Tucheng and Chungho and found an array of pirated clothing under
the brand names of AMF, Timberland, Polo, Levis, Tommy Hilfiger
and Marlboro Classics.
</P>
<P>
The counterfeit garments were sold at one-tenth to about half of
the price of genuine name-brand goods, according to the
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
The initial interrogation of the owners has found that the two
stores were deliberately selected because both were close to a
hypermarket and were rented for only 15 days to avoid police
attention.
</P>
<P>
Bureau of Investigation officials suspect there is a massive
piracy ring behind the illegal operations and are continuing the
investigation, the spokesman said.
