Minister of Foreign Affairs James Huang will travel to Belize
later this month to attend a meeting with his counterparts in
Central America, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
MOFA officials said that during the 13th Conference of the Mixed
Commission of Cooperation Between Central American Countries and
the Republic of China (Taiwan) scheduled for May 25, Huang will
discuss with his counterparts matters related to the region,
including the issues of crime, energy and trade.
</P>
<P>
The officials noted that the foreign ministers of Taiwan, Costa
Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, Panama and
Belize agreed to set up the mixed commission to promote
multilateral cooperation during a meeting in December 1991.
Conferences have been held annually alternatively between Taiwan
and Central American countries since 1992, when the first such
meeting took place in Taipei.

<P>
Meanwhile, Jaime Chen, deputy director of the MOFA's Department
of Central and Southern American Affairs, said that he is
optimistic that Nicaraguan Foreign Minister Samuel Santos Lopez
will visit Taiwan before the end of June to work out the details
of cooperation projects between Taiwan and the new Nicaraguan
administration.
</P>
<P>
Santos told Huang, when the latter attended the inauguration of
Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega in January, that he would lead
a delegation to visit Taiwan in three months. However, he has yet
to make the trip due to other engagements.
