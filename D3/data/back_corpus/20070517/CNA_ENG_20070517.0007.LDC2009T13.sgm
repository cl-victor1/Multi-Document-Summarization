Taiwan needs to continue to push for the establishment of a free
trade agreement (FTA) with the United States as it is Taiwan's
most important trade and economic policy objective, Taiwan's
representative to the United States Joseph Wu said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Wu said that as Taiwan maintains close economic and trade
relations with China, a Taiwan-U.S. FTA will not only deepen the
trade and economic ties between the two countries but also create
a "win-win-win" situation for Taiwan, the United States and
China.
</P>
<P>
Wu made the remarks during a meeting with officials at the Taipei
Economic and Cultural Representative Office (TECO) in the United
States.

<P>
In promoting the establishment of a Taiwan-U.S. FTA, Taiwan has
explained to the U.S. side the impact of the U.S.-Korea FTA on
Taiwan's economy and has emphasized the benefits to be brought
about by a Taiwan-U.S. FTA for the business sectors in both
countries, TECO officials said.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Taiwan and U.S. businesses with investment in China
will also benefit from the supply chain integration, they said.
</P>
<P>
The officials further said Taiwan will send an agricultural and
industrial delegation to the United States in June to lobby for
support from the U.S. Congress,  state governments and civic
organizations for the signing of a Taiwan-U.S. FTA.
