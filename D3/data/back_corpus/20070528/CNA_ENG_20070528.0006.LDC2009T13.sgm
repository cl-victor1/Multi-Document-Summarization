Police will activate their election-related violence and bribery
preventive mechanism six months ahead of the year-end legislative
elections as the races are expected to be far more ferocious than
those held in the past, a senior official said Monday.
</P>
<P>
According  to the  official,  the National  Police  Agency
Director-General Hou Yu-ih called a meeting of criminal
investigation bureau chiefs from cities and counties around the
country last Friday to brief them on the government's efforts to
stamp out election-related bribery and violence in the run-up to
the year-end polls.
</P>
<P>
Hou was quoted as having said at the meeting that in the crime-
fighting campaign, the top priority will be cracking down on
vote-buying and election- related violence.
</P>
<P>
As the upcoming elections will be the first held under the new
"single-member constituency, two votes" electoral system and as
the number of seats in the legislature has been halved to 113,
Hou said the competition will be especially fierce.
</P>
<P>
Against this backdrop,  he said the mechanism  to prevent
election-related bribery and violence should be activated earlier
than usual.
</P>
<P>
To enhance operational efficiency, Hou said, a "heavy rewards,
heavy punishment" system will be put in place to encourage local
police officers to actively investigate  suspected  vote-buying
charges.
</P>
<P>
While financial rewards for efforts leading to convictions in
vote-buying cases will be substantially increased,  Hou added,
penalties  for  police  units  that fail  to  uncover  major
election-related bribery cases will be harsher than before, with
the heads of staff or police bureau chiefs to be reprimanded,
demoted or transferred to other positions or offices.
</P>
<P>
To prevent the inflow of foreign funds for use in interfering in
the coming legislative elections,  Hou said,  he and Criminal
Investigation Bureau Director Huang Mao-sui paid a visit to State
Public Prosecutor-General Chen Tsung-ming earlier this month to
seek greater access for local police officers to information and
data collected by the money laundering prevention center under
the Ministry of Justice's Bureau of Investigation.
</P>
<P>
Hou further said that he has ordered an intensified crackdown on
illegal firearms following the shooting death of Taipei County
Councilor Wu Shan-jeou in his service office in broad daylight
last Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Local police personnel should also step up intelligence gathering
to prevent violent interference in the coming legislative
elections, Hou said, adding that "we absolutely cannot allow a
single shooting of a legislative candidate to occur."
</P>
<P>
For his part,  Huang encouraged  local police officers to
courageously resist pressure from local political factions in
probing any suspected vote-buying cases. "Every possible effort
should be made to prevent the appearance of such an embarrassing
scenario in which police officers from other precincts or
branches successfully uncover a major election bribery case on
your own turf, " Huang said.
</P>
<P>
In addition to such traditional election bribery tactics as
handing out small sums of cash to individual voters or organizing
hiking activities or one-day tour packages, NPA officials said
gambling games may be used by certain candidates this time around
to win the support of voters.
</P>
<P>
"We'll pay special attention to election-related gambling to
prevent any gambling schemes from influencing the outcome of any
of the races in the legislative elections," Huang said.
