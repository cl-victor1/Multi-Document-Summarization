Zoo veterinarian Chang Po-yu, whose left forearm was bitten off
by a crocodile last month, was transferred to a public ward
Monday from the intensive care unit at the Kaohsiung Medical
University Hospital (KMUH) ,  where he underwent limb re-
attachment surgery 48 days ago.
</P>
<P>
The team in charge of Chang's medical treatment, headed by KMUH
President Hsu Sheng-hsiung, held a press conference at the
hospital, declaring Chang is the first person in the world to
have a severed arm successfully reattached after it was retrieved
from the mouth of acrocodile at the municipal Shou Shan Zoo in
Kaohsiung, southern Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Orthopedist Lin Kao-tien said he had reviewed over 2,000 cases of
people injured by crocodiles on the Internet before he found that
only one of the cases, recorded in 1983, featured a bitten-off
hand re-attached.
</P>
<P>
However, in that case there were no other records about the
outcome of the surgery, Lin said. He noted that it is difficult
to re-attach a severed limb bitten off by a crocodile because the
reptiles possess extremely powerful jaws capable of biting down
with 3,000 pounds of pressure per square inch, while their mouths
are usually home to many germs.
</P>
<P>
Treating Chang was a precious experience for the KMUH because it
was the first case of this kind that the hospital had ever dealt
with, Lin added.
</P>
<P>
The incident took place April 11 when Chang, a senior vet at the
municipal zoo, was trying to remove anesthetic needles from a
saltwater or estuarine crocodile, which had seemed inactive and
for about a week, promoting Chang to check its health.
</P>
<P>
While Chang was rushed to the hospital, a police officer was
called to shoot the huge creature in order retrieve the severed
limb, which the croc did not want to give up. Upon being shot a
second time, the crocodile violently swung its head and flung the
arm over the railing and out of the compound.
</P>
<P>
Hsu said Chang's left forearm is almost completely retained, and
Chang faces a long journey of rehabilitation to bring the injured
arm back to normal.
