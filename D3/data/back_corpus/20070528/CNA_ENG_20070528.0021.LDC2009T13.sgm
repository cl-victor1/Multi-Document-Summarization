</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  May 28 (CNA) 05/28/07  17:48:15 (By Deborah Kuo)

<P>
Taiwan's top mainland China policy planner refused to budge an
inch Monday in response to suggestions that the government  relax
restrictions  on Taiwan investment  in the manufacturing of
certain high-technology products in China.
</P>
<P>
Answering questions at a meeting of the Legislative Yuan Home and
Nations Committee, Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) Chairman Chen
Ming-tong expressed firm opposition to calls for Taiwan to lift
restrictions on domestic companies setting up shop in China to
manufacture  certain high-tech products that are already being
mass-produced there.
</P>
<P>
Chen expressed opposition to a proposal submitted by opposition
Kuomintang Legislator Lee Chi-chu calling for an amendment to
Article 35 of the Statute Governing the Relations Between the
People of the Taiwan Area and the Mainland Area to allow Taiwan
companies to invest in the manufacturing of certain high- tech
products, including the production of small-sized silicon wafers
and the application of chip packaging and testing technology, in
China that are already being mass-produced by Chinese companies.
</P>
<P>
Noting that Taiwan has restricted high-tech trade with China
based on considerations of international conventions on high-tech
trade control as well as Taiwan's national security and defense,
infrastructure,  and the development of the domestic high-tech
industrial sector, Chen said Lee seems to have only have taken
the international  conventions  on  high-tech  trade  control
into consideration.
</P>
<P>
Chen cited the results of public opinion polls conducted by
National Chengchi University over the past three years as
indicating that more than 50 percent  of Taiwan  adults  favor
"strict restrictions" on Taiwan's China-bound high-tech
investments, compared with less than 30 percent who favor an
easing of restrictions on these types of investments.
</P>
<P>
He added that most of the people of Taiwan think that the
government should regulate or control Taiwan's high-tech trade
with and investment in China in order to prevent "the draining of
Taiwan's core industrial technologies."
</P>
<P>
For her part, Lee said that she made the amendment proposal as
she sees Taiwan's high-tech industrial sector facing increasing
pressure from international competition.
</P>
<P>
Lee said she sees a domestic high-tech industry in flight and a
battered Taiwan economy, which she claimed is due to the
government's "biased and blurred" high- tech policy.
