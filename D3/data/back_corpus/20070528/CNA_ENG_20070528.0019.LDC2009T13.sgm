<P>
A proposed provision banning people from raising pet animals at
home once the animals are listed as carriers of the causative
agent of an epidemic disease passed preliminary review in the
Legislative Yuan Monday.
</P>
<P>
The proposed stipulation is part of a set of draft amendments to
the Communicable Disease Control Act aimed at improving the
current measures to safeguard the country against the outbreak of
a serious zoonotic epidemic such as an avian flu epidemic.
</P>
<P>
One of the proposed amendments would give the government the
power to impose a ban on raising, slaughtering, selling or
abandoning animals once the government has determined that the
animals are carriers of the agent of a zoonotic disease, which
may be transmitted from other animals, both wild and domestic, to
humans or from humans to animals, according to the Center for
Disease Control (CDC), which drafted the amendments.
</P>
<P>
Another amendment would give the government the authority to
slaughter, destroy, bury, or deal with animals that are carriers
of an agent of an epidemic disease with other kinds of methods.
</P>
<P>
CDC Deputy Director Generala Shih Wen-yi explained that if the
draft amendments are passed into law, the center will be able to
prohibit people from raising pet birds at home if there are
reports of an outbreak of a disease in which birds are the
carriers of the agent of the disease. The CDC will also be able
to order the slaughter of pet birds out of quarantine concerns,
he added.
</P>
<P>
Under the amended law, anyone who violated the regulations would
face a fine of between NT$60,000 (US$9,500) and NT$300,000, Shih
said.
