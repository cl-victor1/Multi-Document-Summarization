Main  opposition  Kuomintang  (KMT) presidential candidate Ma

According to the sources, Ma will head for India June 11 for a

major political party leaders and senior business executives for
wide-ranging talks.

Ma is scheduled to leave India for Singapore late June 13 where
he will meet with Singaporean  politicians,  including  senior

charge involving alleged misuse of a discretionary "special
allowance fund" during his tenure as mayor of Taipei from
19986-2006, attaches great importance to his upcoming visit to
India and Singapore as he looks forward to helping expand
Taiwan's diplomatic frontiers, Ma's aides said.
