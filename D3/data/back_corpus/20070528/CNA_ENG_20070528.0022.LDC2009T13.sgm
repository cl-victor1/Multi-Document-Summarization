School children who read more books and watch less TV tend to
make higher scholastic achievements than their counterparts  who
do not read and spend their time watching television, an
elementary school principal said Monday.

Chen Ching-yi, principal of Taipei City's Tatung Elementary
School, said during a meeting on the findings of a citywide basic
scholastic aptitude test (SAT) of school children that students
who live with both parents born in Taiwan and with high
educational backgrounds often raise questions in class, spend
time reading newspapers or books every day and spend less than an
hour a day using the computer or watching TV tend to have higher
SAT scores.

The results of the test,  on Chinese language  and maths
proficiency, found that girls generally have better scores in
Chinese language proficiency than boys, while girls and boys
share about equal proficiency in maths, according to Chen.

Meanwhile, he said, students in the habit of using "textspeak" --
a process of shortening words and adding numbers or phonetic
symbols to a text message, to make it "cooler" -- tend to have
poorer performance than their counterparts who do not use
textspeak or use less.

The test also found that aboriginal students tend to have lower
scores than their non-aboriginal counterparts, Chen added.

Taipei Mayor Hau Lung-bin, who presided over the meeting,
instructed the Education Department to hammer out plans to assist
children of "new immigrants, " single parents and those from low-
income families in their scholastic efforts.
