'MA EXCLUSION BILL' FAILS AT LEGISLATIVE COMMITTEE
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taipei,  April 20 (CNA) 04/20/07  19:54:56 (By Flor Wang)
</P>
<P>
A draft amendment to the Presidential and Vice Presidential
Election and Recall Law pushed by ruling Democratic Progressive
Party (DPP) lawmakers failed Friday at the legislative Procedure
Committee after opposition parties joined forces to reject it.
</P>
<P>
The draft bill,  widely assumed to target main opposition
Kuomintang (KMT) former Chairman Ma Ying-jeou as it would
effectively ban him from running in the next presidential race,
was blocked by KMT lawmakers and their allies in the People First
Party (PFP) and the Non-Partisan Solidarity Union (NPSU) by a
vote of 100 to 97 in favor of a KMT proposal that the committee
meeting be adjourned.
</P>
<P>
PFP legislative caucus whip Fu Kun-chi said caucus members agreed
to back the KMT's proposal after the KMT demonstrated good faith
earlier the same day with regards to cooperation between the two
parties in December's legislative elections and the 2008
presidential election.
</P>
<P>
PFP lawmaker Feng Ting-kuo said that the KMT has two weeks to
delve into the issue pertaining to KMT-PFP cooperation in the
coming elections.
</P>
<P>
If the KMT fails to live up to promises made late last year on
the allotment of 10 regional and three at-large seats to the PFP
in the year-end legislative election, PFP lawmakers will not
attend the next meeting of the Procedure Committee, making it
possible for the DPP and its ally, the Taiwan Solidarity Union
(TSU), to again place the draft amendment on the agenda, Feng
said.
</P>
<P>
The KMT has struggled since Thursday to persuade PFP and NPSU
lawmakers to join forces with the KMT to block the bill in
Friday's Procedure Committee meeting from being put forth for a
second reading.
</P>
<P>
Along with the bill aimed at preventing Ma from taking part in
the next presidential election, another TSU-proposed bill
targeting the KMT's assets was also barred from being assigned
for a second reading.
</P>
<P>
In the face of the two bills' failure at the Procedure Committee,
DPP legislative caucus whip Ker Chien-ming accused the KMT of
"working for its own destruction."
</P>
<P>
TSU legislative  caucus whip Tseng Tsahn-deng  called  the
obstruction by the KMT and the PFP "a shame" that renders each "a
laughingstock." He then blasted the two parties for "covering up
a corrupt criminal."
</P>
<P>
Ma was indicted in mid-February  by Taipei prosecutors on
corruption charges in a case related to his alleged embezzlement
of some NT$11 million in funds from a special monthly municipal
allowance earmarked for his discretionary use during his two
terms as mayor of Taipei from 1998-2006.
</P>
<P>
Ma has reiterated his strong desire to pursue the presidency
despite the corruption charges, prompting the DPP to submit the
proposed amendment to ban individuals convicted in the first
trial from participating in presidential elections.
</P>
<P>
The Taipei District Court has opened two hearings on Ma's case
since early this month. Ma pleaded not guilty and defended
himself during the sessions.
