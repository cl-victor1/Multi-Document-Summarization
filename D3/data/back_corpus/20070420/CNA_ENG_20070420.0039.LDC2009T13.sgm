Taiwanese students are displaying 23 inventions at the Geneva
Inventions Fair, the world's largest event of its kind, which
opened Thursday with more than 700 inventors from 42 countries
participating.
</P>
<P>
The Taiwanese inventions include body-shaping underwear,  a
diamond-shaped super-comfortable mask,  headstand machine,  wine
maturation accelerator, a ball-shaped hidden camera with a
360-degree split-screen and a digital wrench.
</P>
<P>
The inventions attracted attention from fair visitors and
demonstrated the results of reforms in Taiwan's educational
system, which now encourages innovation and creative thinking.
</P>
<P>
Wang Yuan-ren, vice president of Far East University, which sent
a team to the fair, said the university applies for patents on
more than 200 inventions every year.
</P>
<P>
Up to 150 of these patents have been recognized, the highest on
record among local colleges, Wang claimed.
</P>
<P>
The school hopes that its students will acquire a global
perspective and enhance their competitiveness through
participating in this year's event, Wang noted.
</P>
<P>
The university's students invented an adjustable golf club angle-
measuring instrument, a recyclable printed circuit board, a new
style of cosmetic facial mask, and scented gold accessories
advertised as promoting health.

<P>
Taiwan's representative to the WTO Lin Yi-fu and other Taiwanese
officials visited the Taiwanese participants.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan has been a big winner at past events and is expected to
win big again this year. The fair was scheduled to hold its
awards ceremony Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Geneva Inventions Fair is one of the world's three largest
invention expositions; the others are held in Pittsburgh, the
United States and Nuremberg, Germany.
</P>
<P>
Many countries, including Taiwan, South Korea and Malaysia, have
attached great importance to innovation in recent years and have
begun to organize similar events.
</P>
<P>
The Taipei International Invention Show and Technomart, now in
its third year, is slated to take place Sept. 27-30 and the
Taiwan External Trade Development Council (TAITRA) has been
promoting the event in Geneva.
</P>
<P>
Last year, 12 nations took part in the Taipei event, TAITRA
officials said, adding that this year, the event aims to set up
1,000 booths.
