EU ENVOY URGES TAIWAN TO INVEST MORE IN EUROPE
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taipei, April 20 (CNA) 04/20/07  13:09:57 (By Sofia Wu)
</P>
<P>
Taiwan is welcome to invest more in Europe as the continent has
emerged as the world's largest single market with terrific
profitability, the new representative of the 25-state European
Union (EU) in Taiwan said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Guy Ledoux, head of the European Economic and Trade Office in
Taiwan, which represents EU interests here, pointed out that
while the EU is now Taiwan's largest foreign investor, Taiwan's
investment in European countries is comparatively low.
</P>
<P>
According to Ledoux, accumulated EU investment in Taiwan has
roughly hit 11.5 billion euro (US$15.64 billion), surpassing the
amount invested by either the United States or Japan.
</P>
<P>
Ledoux said that in contrast, it seems to him that Taiwanese
entrepreneurs remain very cautious about launching  investment
projects in the EU To the best of his knowledge, Ledoux said,
Taiwan even lags behind the Philippines in terms of EU
investments. He didn't provide exact figures.
</P>
<P>
On the trade front, Ledoux said Taiwan remains one of the EU's
major trading partners, with two-way trade reaching 40 billion
euro for 2006, compared to 46 billion euro in EU-India trade and
44 billion euro in EU-Brazil trade.
</P>
<P>
Looking forward, Ledoux said Taiwan-EU trade will continue to
expand in 2007 after posting growth of 6.8 percent last year. In
2006, Ledoux said, Taiwan registered an increase of 10 percent in
its exports to the EU, but its imports from the 25-state trade
bloc only grew 1.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
Ledoux said he will give priority to bolstering trade and
investment between the EU and Taiwan, with reinforced
intellectual property rights (IPR) protection as the primary
theme.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, Ledoux delivered his first public speech since
taking office here six weeks ago at a lunch meeting of the
European Chamber of Commerce in Taipei (ECCT).
</P>
<P>
Ledoux said in that speech that Taiwan is heading in the right
direction with regards to improving IPR protection. However, he
added, there are also less encouraging moves, such as compulsory
licensing.
</P>
<P>
Noting that his office will aim to tackle restrictive trade
measures adopted by local government authorities, Ledoux said he
will step up communications with them to facilitate his work.
</P>
<P>
While the EU is negotiating bilateral free trade agreements
(FTAs) with its key trade partners, including South Korea, India
and ASEAN, Ledoux told ECCT members that it will be some time
before the EU is able to evaluate the feasibility of signing a
similar pact with Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Factors affecting the possibility of an FTA being signed between
Taiwan and the EU include whether European companies see any need
for or benefits from such a deal and whether Taiwan's government
is interested in signing such an accord, Ledoux explained.
</P>
<P>
In his speech, Ledoux also mentioned another task on his agenda,
namely urging Taiwan to sign the Government Procurement Agreement
(GPA) , which he said would allow European corporations to bid
for government tenders in Taiwan as well as give their Taiwanese
counterparts access to European government projects.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan had promised to join the GPA before its accession to the
World Trade Organization (WTO) in 2002, but it has had
difficulties delivering on that promise because of opposition
from China over terminology to be used in the contract.
</P>
<P>
Due to China's reluctance to recognize Taiwan's sovereign status,
Taiwan has been unable to conclude GPA negotiations with other
WTO members as the issues regarding the titles of its government
agencies have not been resolved.
</P>
<P>
Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) officials have said that the
government can be flexible with regard to the form of Taiwan's
participation in the GPA, but it cannot afford to budge on the
nomenclature issue.
</P>
<P>
"We deserve the same treatment as other member states and will
only join the GPA on the condition that our national dignity and
sovereignty remain intact, " an official with the MOFA's
Department of Economic and Trade Affairs said earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
On this issue, Ledoux said he believes that any disputes
surrounding the GPA can be settled through negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Born in Strasbourg,  France,  Ledoux  joined  the European
Commission-- the EU's executive arm -- in 1990. He has held a
number of posts in trade and foreign relations in the Asia
Department, the Middle East Department and the European
Neighborhood Policy Department. He has also served in Tunisia and
South Korea as deputy head of mission.
