The Taiwan Luxembourg Joint Business Council (TLJBC) was
inaugurated Friday, with the long term goal of strengthening
trade, business and investment relations between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
"Establishing linkages between Europe and Asia has not been easy,
but we're determined to do it, and Luxembourg is the gateway for
Taiwanese businesses into the European market, " council chairman
Theodore Huang, who also serves as the Chairman of the National
Association of Industry and Commerce.
</P>
<P>
Representatives from Luxembourg echoed the same opinion. "First
of all, Luxembourg can be Taiwan's gateway to the European Union
(EU) countries. Secondly, as the financial and logistic center of
Europe, [Luxembourg] can be very attractive for Taiwanese
companies, " said Pierre Gramegna, Director- General of the
Chamber of Commerce of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg.
</P>
<P>
Gramegna is among 30 Luxembourg economic mission delegates
visiting Taiwan Apr. 19 - 21. If all goes well, he said, a Taiwan
business delegation will be visiting Luxembourg this fall.
</P>
<P>
Luxembourgian businesses appreciate Taiwan's potential to produce
top-quality products and its leading role in the Chinese world in
democracy, said Marc Solvi, the other TLJBC chairman who is
currently CEO of Paul Wurth Group.
</P>
<P>
"We're not just doing business with Taiwan," he said, adding that
the company has a production facility in Kaohsiung from where it
exports its products to many other countries around the world.
</P>
<P>
In the initial stages, the council will try to help businesses
from both sides better understand one another, Huang said, adding
that Taiwan can help Luxembourg penetrate Asian markets, such as
Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
Economic relations between both sides are looking good, Gramegna
said, as there are already Taiwanese companies from more than
half dozen fields investing in Luxembourg.
