Taiwanese investment in China reached US$2.08 billion in the
first three months of this year, an increase of 17.79 percent
over the year-earlier level, according to statistics released
Friday by the Investment Commission under the Ministry of
Economic Affairs (MOEA).
</P>
<P>
The Investment Commission approved a total of 258 China-bound
investment projects by Taiwanese entrepreneurs during the
January-March period.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a total of 466 inbound investment projects by foreign
and overseas Taiwanese investors were approved by the MOEA for an
amount of US$1.508 billion during the same period, a decrease of
72.62 percent over the same period of last year.
</P>
<P>
MOEA officials attributed the drop in foreign direct investment
partly to the unusual high amount recorded in the first quarter
of last year due to Philips Taiwan's transfer of its shares in
Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Corp. to its mother company.
</P>
<P>
If that sale was excluded, foreign direct investment during the
first three months registered a 14.38 percent drop over the same
period of last year, the officials added.
</P>
<P>
The number of Taiwan's overseas investment projects excluding
China totaled 119 during the period, for a volume of US$508
million, adecrease of 21.34 percent over the year-earlier level,
according to MOEA statistics.
