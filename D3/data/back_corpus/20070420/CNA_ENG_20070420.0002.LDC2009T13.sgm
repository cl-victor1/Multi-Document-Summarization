Taipei, April 19 (CNA) 04/20/07  10:52:13 (By T.C. Jiang)

<P>
"Taiwan" and the country's official title, "Republic of China",
will appear together for the first time on the same set of local
stamps, slated for launch April 25, executives from Taiwan Post
Co. said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
This will be the last time that Taiwan's official title will
appear on stamps issued by the state-owned company, the
executives said.
</P>
<P>
The new stamps, to be issued later this month featuring the
lesser panda, are the last set of animal-themed Republic of China
stamps. The printing of that set was completed before the company
changed its name, the executives noted.
</P>
<P>
Since the postal company changed its name from Chunghwa Post to
Taiwan Post earlier this year, the name "Republic of China" will
no longer appear on local stamps, they went on.
</P>
<P>
The name change is part of the government's efforts to remove
references of "China" or "Chinese" from the titles of state-owned
companies to avoid confusion with similarly named counterparts in
China. "Chunghwa" means "China" in Mandarin.
