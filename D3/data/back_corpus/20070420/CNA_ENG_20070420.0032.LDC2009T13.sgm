The Ministry of Education is working on a plan that will budget
NT$2.6 billion (US$78.46 million) to help 210,000 disadvantaged
students at private universities and colleges from 2008,
Political Vice Minister of Education Lu Mu- lin announced Friday.

Lu made the announcement while explaining the government's
responsibilities in taking care of disadvantaged students at a
seminar held by the Association of Private Universities and
Colleges.

The special budget to be taken from the government's subsidies to
private schools will be used for students whose family income
ranks in the bottom 40 percent of the country, Lu said, adding
that the MOE's Department of Higher Education is working on
ratings for the subsidy amounts.

Subsidies for disadvantaged students in public universities and
