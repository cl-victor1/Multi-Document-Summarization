KMT-PFP REACH INITIAL AGREEMENT ON LEGISLATIVE ELECTIONS: PFP
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  April 20 (CNA) 04/20/07  20:41:20 (By Flor Wang)

The main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) has agreed to allot five
constituencies to be managed by its ally, the People First Party
(PFP) , in December's legislative elections, PFP officials said
Friday.
</P>
<P>
The preliminary agreement came after a group of PFP lawmakers led
by Chang Hsien-yao, who also serves as director of the party's
central policy center, held talks earlier that day with KMT
officials prior to a legislative Procedure Committee meeting, in
which the KMT needed PFP collaboration to block two bills that
are of major concern to it, according to PFP sources.
</P>
<P>
During the talks, KMT Secretary-General Wu Duen-yih signed a
document agreeing to allocate five constituencies for the PFP to
run in the year-end legislative elections, the sources said,
adding that the two parties will hold more talks in the coming
two weeks on cooperation in the remaining constituencies.
</P>
<P>
It is hoped that all this will help avoid a split between the two
parties and secure victory for both parties in future elections,
the sources said.
</P>
<P>
Later in the day, the two draft bills submitted by the "pan-green
camp" of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) and its
ally, the Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU), were rejected by
lawmakers of the KMT, the PFP and the Non-Partisan Solidarity
Union in the committee meeting, crushing "pan-green" efforts to
send them to the respective committees for further screening.
</P>
<P>
The first DPP-proposed bill sought to ban those who are convicted
in the first trial from taking part in the country's presidential
elections and the second, put forward by the TSU, sought to force
the KMT to return its ill-gotten assets to the national coffers.
</P>
<P>
The first is apparently  aimed at former KMT Chairman Ma Ying-
jeou, a likely and strong candidate to represent the KMT in the
next presidential race despite embezzlement charges against him.
</P>
<P>
Wu admitted that the two parties had reached agreement in some
areas with regard to the coming elections, saying that the KMT is
"cautiously optimistic" about the outcome.
