VICTIM IN MOCK BANK ROBBERY SEEKING COMPENSATION FROM CHINATRUST
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  April 20 (CNA) 04/20/07  21:19:28 (By Han Nai-kuo)

The Consumers' Foundation is intervening on behalf of a young
woman to seek compensation from Chinatrust Commercial Bank for
the trauma she suffered as a result of a January mock bank
robbery that she believed was real at the time.
</P>
<P>
Foundation Chairman Cheng Jen-hung told reporters Friday that the
woman, whose name he declined to disclose, was trying to remit a
sum of money at Chinatrust's Chungshan branch when the bank
staged the anti-robbery  exercise without giving any prior notice
to its customers.
</P>
<P>
Caught unaware by the exercise, in which a "robber" wielding a
gun was right next to her, the woman -- pale-faced and trembling
with fear -- nearly collapsed and had difficulty breathing when
the exercise was over, according to Cheng.
</P>
<P>
The woman was hospitalized for 10 days. She is still receiving
follow-up treatment and is unable to work.
</P>
<P>
Chinatrust agreed only to pay her medical expenses and offered
two gift vouchers for the Chinatrust Hotel, claiming that the
bank was not responsible for the consequences because it was
following the instructions of the Cabinet-level Financial
Supervisory Commission in holding the exercise.
</P>
<P>
Cheng said Chinatrust apparently violated the Consumer Protection
Law because it failed to inform its customers in advance of the
mock holdup in the first place and then shirked its
responsibility of making appropriate compensation to the victim.
</P>
<P>
The Consumers' Foundation executive pointed out that under the
law, the bank should post a clear sign warning its customers when
its products or services might pose a danger to their life and
health or result in their monetary losses.
