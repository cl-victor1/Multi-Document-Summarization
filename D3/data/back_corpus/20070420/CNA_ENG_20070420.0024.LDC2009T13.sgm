'ONE DARK HOUR' REDUCES CO2 POLLUTION BY 100,000 TONS: TAIPOWER

Taipei,  April 20 (CNA) 04/20/07  18:53:34 (By Deborah Kuo)

Nationwide 1.75 megawatts of electricity were conserved around
noon Friday, over and above the amount conserved April 16, the
result of a variety of factors, including a"turn-off-the-lights
for one hour" campaign, according to the state- owned Taiwan
Power Co. (Taipower).
</P>
<P>
The additional electrical savings translate into a reduction of
100,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide, comparable to the amount
of carbon dioxide that an area of forest covering 442 meters
squared would absorb in a year, Taipower officials said.

<P>
Quoting islandwide records of electrical consumption, Taipower
authorities said that energy use decreased by 56.17 MW islandwide
at 12:18 p.m., down from the peak posted on 12 noon of the same
day.
</P>
<P>
By comparison, they said, electrical consumption decreased by
54.42 MW islandwide at 12: 24 p.m. on April 16, down from the
peak at 12 noon of the same day.
</P>
<P>
April 16 was chosen as a basis of comparison because the weather
patterns of that day were similar to Friday's weather conditions,
they added.
</P>
<P>
Taipower officials said that the "turn-off-the-lights for one
hour" campaign can be considered one of the contributing factors
behind the greater decrease in electrical consumption on Friday,
compared to April 16.
</P>
<P>
They said daily energy consumption is determined by a variety of
reasons, including weather conditions and the brightness of the
day.
</P>
<P>
Legislator Tien Chiu-chin of the ruling Democratic Progressive
Party proposed several days ago that Taiwan public should take
part in a "turn-off-the-lights for one hour" campaign, switching
lights, air conditioners and electrical equipment off from noon
to 1 p.m. April 20 in a bid to lessen consumption of energy.
</P>
<P>
The campaign is part of efforts to mark the April 22 Earth Day,
observed around the globe to raise awareness of the environment,
particularly at a time when additional efforts are being made
around the world to help slow global warming, which scientists
attribute to the greenhouse effect, which is a direct result of
emissions of carbon dioxide and fossil fuel pollutants.
