NOBEL LAUREATE TUTU TALKS ABOUT RECONCILIATION DURING TAIWAN
VISIT

Taipei,  April 20 (CNA) 04/20/07  14:47:57 (By Y.C. Jou)

On an eight-day visit in Taiwan, former South African Anglican
Church Archbishop Desmond Mpilo Tutu said he was shaken by the
size of a mound that grew out of the soil one shovel scoop at a
time to cover the bloodshed of countless shooting executions in
the early period of Kuomintang rule, at a site which is now known
as Machangting Memorial Park.
</P>
<P>
"The height [of the mound] is very telling, for it indicates just
how many people were shot there. It is a silent but very powerful
image," he said.
</P>
<P>
The 1984 Nobel Peace Prize winner who made a great contribution
to ending apartheid in South Africa and facilitating
reconciliation made the remarks in an interview with members of
the press at the Grand Hotel in Taipei Thursday afternoon during
his visit in Taiwan which has been organized by the Taiwan
Foundation for Democracy with the theme of transitional justice.
</P>
<P>
Tutu said he has no specific advice for Taiwan regarding
transitional justice but hopes that "the people will learn some
of the lessons we learnt, such as that you cannot go on as a
country unless you acknowledge your past."
</P>
<P>
Presented with a question regarding historical truth often being
vulnerable to manipulation by politicians,  Tutu expressed his
confidence in society's ability to find out and face its
unpleasant past.
</P>
<P>
"There are people like ourselves, scholars, and many others, who
are able to put forward a correct version of history, and to
point out in fact that it does not help to try to deceive
yourself, " he said.
</P>
<P>
"The best way is to look at your past very firmly in the eyes. We
need to look at the beast in the eye, then we'll have the
opportunity to advance. Otherwise, the beast of the dark past
will return to haunt us," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that he found that elements of the stories of Taiwan's
228 Incident and White Terror told to him by victims and their
family members whom he met with that day echoed what he
experienced and saw in South Africa as well as Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
"People tend to think that victims are angry, nurse grudges and
are prepared to get revenge. However, the victims I met with have
gentle faces, are generous, and really want to move on," he said.
</P>
<P>
"I think most of all it's the dignity of these people that makes
them such an impressive group of people, " he said, adding that
the point is that these people want to know what really happened
to their loved ones and that it is important that this need is
met.
</P>
<P>
Asked whether he thinks South Africa has moved on, Tutu said that
it has, "to some extent."
</P>
<P>
"We have not arrived at a destination, but reconciliation is not
a just destination, it is also a journey. It is a process in
which every single one of us is expected to make a contribution,
" he explained.
</P>
<P>
South Africa's Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) takes an
approach that, described by Tutu in his 1999 book "No Future
Without Forgiveness",  neither seeks a large-scale  pursuit of
former perpetrators, like what happened in Nuremburg, Germany
after World War II, nor simply opts to forget about the past like
countries such as Chile did. Instead, the South African system
requires that those who participated in repression fully confess
to their deeds in the TRC hearings, face-to-face with the victims
and their families, in order to be entitled to a pardon.
</P>
<P>
When it comes to forgiveness on the victim's part, Tutu said, it
is not to be expected that those who have suffered will suddenly
"like" those who did evil to them. The idea is that "if you don't
forgive, you're locking yourself into a position where you're
always a victim. But if you're ready to forgive, you're not an
object, you're active, and the initiative is yours. You're in
charge, " he said.
</P>
<P>
He further said that he believes people eventually find out the
facts. "It is much better and easier to be friends than to be
enemies, and peace is much cheaper than war," he added.
</P>
<P>
Tutu denied a media report that he had not visited Taiwan during
the last 12 years due to pressure from China. "No, I am not aware
of that, " he replied when asked about the report, saying he has
the freedom to talk about any issues, such as Tibet and the Dalai
Lama, and will not be stopped by people who try to tell him what
not to do.
