Eyeing the great potential of Taiwan's machine tool and component
industries, the government will allocate NT$630 million (US$19.09
million) over the next four years as part of a plan to enhance
the sector's global competitiveness, government officials said
Friday.
</P>
<P>
Based on recent developments, the Industrial Development Bureau
(IDB) under the Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) forecasts
that the annual production of machine tool and parts industries
will both reach NT$340 billion by 2015.
</P>
<P>
In 2006, the overall machinery sector was expected to have a
total output of NT$800 billion, and it is hoped to become the
next trillion dollar industry, following the semiconductor and
color monitor industries, IDB officials said.
</P>
<P>
The machine tool industry, which plays a crucial role in the
overall machinery sector, generated a record high production
value of more than NT$100 billion in 2005, officials indicated,
adding that this splendid performance pushed the development  of
machinery components industry to even higher output values,
exceeding NT$100 billion in 2005 and NT$125 billion in 2006.
</P>
<P>
With a view to still greater developments in the promising
sector, the IDB plans to initiate an upgrading project, which it
hopes will make Taiwan one of the world's three largest
manufacturers of machinery components, and the main research and
development center for advanced and high-precision machinery
components in Asia, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
The IDB predicted that the project will help establish in Taiwan
10 flagship machine tool enterprises with a production value of
more than NT$10 billion each.
