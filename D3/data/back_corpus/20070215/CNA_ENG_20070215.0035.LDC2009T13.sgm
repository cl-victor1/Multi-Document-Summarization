The Council for Cultural Affairs (CCA) will spend four years
promoting the "Taiwan Life Aesthetics Movement" with a budget of
NT$ 3.02 billion (US$ 91.9 million) from the central government,
a spokesman for the CCA said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
To increase the Taiwanese people's awareness of aesthetics and
the environment, the CCA solicited contributions from experts and
scholars then drafted a plan for the "Taiwan Life Aesthetics
Movement, " which has since been referred to the Executive Yuan
for approval.
</P>
<P>
According to the spokesman, the plan has three main aspects:
creating an artistic environment, increasing public awareness of
aesthetics, and nurturing talents in the arts. The movement's
goals include the reformation, promotion, demonstration, and
evaluation of art.
</P>
<P>
The first aspect of the plan calls for an "artistic reformation
of public space" and an "aesthetics reformation of cultural
arenas". The second includes a "student museum" and general "life
aesthetics promotion", while the third envisions the creation of
an "artistic promotional bank" and provision of local "artistic
creative resources."
</P>
<P>
The CCA hopes to cultivate the Taiwanese people's aesthetic
sensibilities and create a robust environment in which the
country's art will flourish, the spokesman said.
