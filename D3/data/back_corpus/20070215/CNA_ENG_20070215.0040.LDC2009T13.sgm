HISTORIANS BLAME CHIANG KAI-SHEK FOR 228 INCIDENT
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  Feb. 15 (CNA) 02/15/07  23:07:02 (By Y.C. Jou)

The late President Chiang Kai-shek was the person most
responsible for the bloody 228 Incident, the head of Academica
Historica, the country's top state history institution, said
Thursday upon release of a shortened version of a famous report
on the 1947 tragedy.
</P>
<P>
To herald the approach of the 60th anniversary of the still
controversial incident, the Ketagalan Institute published a
booklet of around 60 pages to publicize the gist of "The 228
Incident: A Record on Responsibility, " a 600-page research
report published by the 228 Incident Memorial Foundation a year
earlier.
</P>
<P>
"Chiang Kai-shek ordered sending more troops to kill Taiwanese
people; he was of course the prime culprit behind the historical
trauma, " Academia Historica chief Chang Yen-hsien said at the
publication press conference for the booklet.
</P>
<P>
He also said then-Taiwan Governor Chen Yi, Taiwan Provincial
Garrison Command Chief of Staff Ko Yuan-fen and Kaohsiung
Garrison Commander Peng Meng-chi were also responsible, as all
three advocated violent suppression and asked the central
government in Nanking to send more troops to Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
A number of "half-mainlanders" collaborated with the then-ruling
Kuomintang (KMT) regime and helped in the purge of Taiwan's
elite, he added. "Half- mainlanders" refers to people with Taiwan
origins during Japanese colonization but who later went to China
and built ties with the KMT.
</P>
<P>
Chen Yi-shen, a co-author of the 2005 report and a researcher
with Academica Sinica's Institute of Modern History, rebutted a
claim by Chiang Kai-shek's grandson, KMT lawmaker John Chiang,
that the former strongman had tried to prevent bloodshed.
</P>
<P>
Chiang claims that his grandfather had on March 13, 1947 issued
an order prohibiting troops from killing in retaliation. However,
Chen said, Chiang gave the order only because ombudsman Yang
Liang-kung informed him of the bloody situation, and the order
was not issued until four days after island-wide massacre began.
</P>
<P>
Chen said there should be no "Chiang Kai-shek Temple" -- a
reference to Taipei's Chiang Kai-shek Memorial Hall -- in Taiwan,
and added that while commemorating the 228 Incident, Taiwan
should pursue the ultimate goal of changing its official name and
drafting a new constitution.
</P>
<P>
Ketagalan Institute Chairman Lee Hung-hsi said Chiang Kai-shek's
slaughter of Taiwan's elite deprived Taiwanese people of their
identity.
</P>
<P>
"It's regrettable that younger generations in Taiwan only know
this year as the 70th anniversary of the Nanking massacre but
have no knowledge about the anniversary of the 228 incident," he
said.
