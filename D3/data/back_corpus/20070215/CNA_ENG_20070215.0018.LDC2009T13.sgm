Lawyer Vincent Wang, who doubled as a commissioner of the

Wang's body was first found by an angler under the Wanshou Bridge
in Mucha in Taipei City's southern suburb Thursday morning.

Police cordoned off the scene, where prosecutors and forensics
experts arrived later to conduct an investigation into the cause
of Wang's drowning.

Wang's newly-wed wife said Wang went out for a walk late
Wednesday night saying that he was feeling really low.

<P>
Chien Shih-ying, chief secretary of the Mongolian and Tibetan
Affairs Commission, quoted Wang's friends and relatives as saying
that Wang had been in low spirits as he had been under great
pressure at work and had undergone two surgeries in recent
months.

Chien said the commission will do its best to help Wang's family
in matters concerning their former colleague's funeral.
