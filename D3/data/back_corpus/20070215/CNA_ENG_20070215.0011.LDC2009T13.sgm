Taiwan has not imported peanut butter from two U. S. brands that
have been linked to a recent salmonella outbreak in America, a
Department of Health (DOH) official said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
A salmonella outbreak that has slowly grown to nearly 300 cases
in 37 U.S. states since last August has been linked to tainted
jars of Peter Pan or Great Value peanut butter -- both brands
produced by the same ConAgra Foods company.
</P>
<P>
Cheng Hui-wen, director of the DOH Bureau of Food Safety said
that after detailed examination it was found that Taiwan has not
imported those brands of peanut butter -- which has only been
sold in the U.S. state of Georgia -- over the past year.
</P>
<P>
ConAgra Foods has reportedly begun to recall all Peter Pan and
Great Value peanut butter produced after May 2006, according to
Cheng.
</P>
<P>
Shih Wen-yi, deputy director of the DOH Center for Disease
Control, said salmonella infection is most commonly caused by
uncooked chicken, followed by infant formula.
</P>
<P>
It is probably the first salmonella outbreak associated with
peanut butter in U.S. history since about 85 percent of the
infected people said they ate peanut butter, according to a
report from the U. S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
About 20 percent of the people infected have been hospitalized,
although none have died.
</P>
<P>
U.S. health officials said how salmonella got into the peanut
butter is still under investigation.
</P>
<P>
Shih said the CDC has launched an investigation, via the Taiwan
PulseNet, into all imported food products and has found no
suspicious cases of salmonella contamination.
</P>
<P>
Symptoms of salmonella can include diarrhea, fever, dehydration,
abdominal pain and vomiting, according to Shih.
