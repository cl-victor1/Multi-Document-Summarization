It has been raining heavily in the county for several days due to
a lingering monsoon frontal system. According to statistics from
the Central Weather Bureau (CWB), rainfall amounted to 152 mm in
Takeng, Taichung county, between 11: 00 a.m. and 2: 00 p.m.
Friday, 136 mm in Tungshih during the same three-hour period, and
119 mm in Shenkang.

The downpour caused flooding which damaged a bridge connecting
the aboriginal Chiuan tribe, in the mountains of the county's
rural Hoping township, with the outside world. Meanwhile, a wall
at an old Marine Corps base in the rural Taya township collapsed
during the rains. No casualties have thus far been confirmed.

By noon, the Hoping rural township administration had opened a
disaster control center and announced the closure of schools and
government offices for the day.

CWB meteorologists forecast that the plum rains frontal system
will remain over the island for the next few days. As a result,
heavy, or torrential rains might be expected across the country
in the short term.
