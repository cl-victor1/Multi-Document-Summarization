Taipei,  June 8 (CNA) 06/08/07  17:51:52 (By Deborah Kuo)

A north-bound bullet train from Zuoying, in the southern port
city of Kaohsiung, which should have arrived 90 minutes after
departure in Banciao, in northern Taipei county, arrived 95
minutes late, resulting in full refunds for all those aboard.
</P>
<P>
The Zuoying-departing bullet train, No. 406, was scheduled to
arrive in Banciao at 10 a.m. Friday, enabling many passengers to
attend a morning meeting in Taipei, but instead arrived at 11: 35
a.m., more than an hour and a half behind schedule.
</P>
<P>
The delay -- the longest in the six-month history of Taiwan's
high speed rail services -- forced the Taiwan High Speed Rail
Corp. (THSRC) to refund in full all of the 800 passengers aboard
Train 406.
</P>
<P>
According to the THSRC authorities, train operators slowed the
vehicle when they discovered an abnormal safety reading on a
detector monitoring the condition of the bogies -- one of the
most important parts of a train -- just after No. 406 passed the
Tainan station. Operators then allowed the bullet train to run at
a much slower speed until it arrived in Taichung, central Taiwan,
where it was found that the abnormal reading did not indicate the
presences of any safety issues and the train was accelerated to
120 km per hour.
</P>
<P>
This delay was followed by a second incident the same day, which
saw passengers taking bullet train No. 114 from Zuoying arrive in
Banciao 30 minutes behind schedule. All passengers aboard that
train received a 50 percent refund.
</P>
<P>
THSRC officials said that the safety alarm on train No. 114 was
triggered when the train passed Miaoli, prompting the operators
to bring the train to a halt. The operators resumed the train's
journey, at a speed of 45 km per hour, after checking all
relevant conditions and finding that slopes supporting the
railroad near Miaoli had been eroded by flood, but that the
eroded area -- 5 meters long, with a depth of about 25
centimeters -- had occurred in an isolated area, was not running,
and would not cause any safety issues, THSRC officials said.
</P>
<P>
Two other south-bound bullet trains, No. 407 and No 505, were
also delayed due to the slope erosion in Miaoli Friday.
</P>
<P>
The 345-km railway linking Taipei and Kaohsiung, inaugurated in
January this year, has reduced rail travel time between Taiwan's
two largest cities to 90 minutes from the previous four-
and-a-half hours.
