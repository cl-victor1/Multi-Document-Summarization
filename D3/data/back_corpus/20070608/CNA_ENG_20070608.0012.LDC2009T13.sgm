Taipei, June 8 (CNA) 06/08/07  15:04:41 (By Deborah Kuo)

Taiwan's setback incurred from the severance of diplomatic
relations with Costa Rica will not affect the operations of the
Democratic Pacific Union (DPU) , Vice President Annette Lu said
Friday.
</P>
<P>
Lu, who played an instrumental role in bringing about the
establishment of the DPU two years ago, noted the number of
countries in the 26-member DPU that do not maintain formal
diplomatic relations with Taiwan is greater than the number of
countries that do, adding that all countries are welcome to join
the DPU so long as they are peace-loving and recognize the value
of democracy.
</P>
<P>
Lu said that in light of Taiwan's latest diplomatic setback -- as
a result of Beijing's unmerciful suppression of Taiwan -- the
people of the country should close ranks and pay more attention
to international affairs and have more concern for the future of
Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
The DPU -- a non-governmental organization designed to serve as a
platform for exchanges among the Pacific Rim countries in the
promotion of democracy, peace and prosperity, and other common
values -- was inaugurated on Aug. 14, 2005.
</P>
<P>
Lu called for the people of the country, particularly members of
the media and the government, to not spend too much time and
energy on elections, saying that elections should be left to the
candidates. She said the country's people should be more
attentive to efforts aimed at making Taiwan a greater and
stronger nation.
</P>
<P>
Lu made the remarks during an interview with media members at
I-Shou University located in Kaohsiung County, southern Taiwan.
