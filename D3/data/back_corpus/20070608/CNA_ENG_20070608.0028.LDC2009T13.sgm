The Philippines government is rolling out a series of promotions
in the hope of attracting more Taiwanese tourists, an official
from the Philippine Department of Tourism said on the sidelines
of a Philippines travel guide launch ceremony Friday.
</P>
<P>
"We will try to present various tour packages to attract
different types of Taiwanese tourists. Some of them visit the
Philippines purely for sightseeing, while some come to play golf,
" said Ireneo H. Reyes, Senior Tourism Operation Officer of the
Department of Tourism.
</P>
<P>
Reyes estimated that more than 100,000 Taiwanese tourists visited
the Philippines last year. The latest statistics from this year
show a 7 percent increase in the number of tourists from the same
period of last year, he said, adding that the bureau is expecting
a record-breaking year in 2007.
</P>
<P>
However, there should be a lot more Taiwanese tourists visiting
the Philippines, he said, adding that the low number of tourists
is due to Taiwanese lack of understanding about its closest
neighbor to the south.
</P>
<P>
The Manila Economic and Cultural Office collaborated with the
China Times Publishing Company to publish the Chinese-language
guide titled Inside Guide: Philippines. "We hope that the readers
will gain a better understanding of Filipinos," he said.
</P>
<P>
The book contains features on Philippine history, culture,
traditions, faith, way of life and other information collected by
the Discovery Channel and Inside Guides -- two of the world's
best information providers, he said.
</P>
<P>
Reyes noted that some of Taiwan's media reports have brought the
Philippines a lot of negative publicity and have affected
Taiwanese people's views of the Southeast Asian country.
