The season for the endangered green turtle to return to lay eggs
on beaches of Penghu has arrived, and tourists should refrain
from entering their protected areas, a conservation official
warned Friday.
</P>
<P>
Chen Chin-lung,  a section  chief with the Penghu  County
Government's Department of Ecology and Conservation, said that
every year between May and October, green turtles come to
Penghu's seashore to nest.
</P>
<P>
Penghu County is the area in Asia where green turtles most
regularly come each year to nest, Chen said.
</P>
<P>
The county has set aside an area of 23.328 hectares in Wanan
township for the threatened species to lay eggs undisturbed,
hoping to eliminate the interference of the tourists in the
turtles' egg-laying and hatching process.
</P>
<P>
Chen said that tourists are banned from entering the area between
May 1 and Oct. 31, and that violators face severe penalties in
accordance with the Wildlife Conservation Law.
</P>
<P>
Although there has been no indications of green turtles coming
ashore to lay eggs so far this year, Chen said that they are
expected to do so shortly.
</P>
<P>
He urged local residents and tourists to follow the relevant
regulations and not to intrude out of curiosity.
