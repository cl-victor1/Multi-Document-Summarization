Ruling Democratic Progressive Party presidential candidate Frank
Hsieh said Thursday that he is in favor of expanding direct
charter flight services across the Taiwan Strait, but opposed to
recognizing diplomas or degrees conferred by Chinese educational
institutions.
</P>
<P>
Hsieh made the remarks while delivering a keynote speech titled
"Say Yes Taiwan" at Chung Shan Medical University in the central
city of Taichung.
</P>
<P>
Answering questions on a wide range of topics, he recalled that
during his tenure as premier, he voiced his support for expanding
direct cross-strait charter flights to avoid controversy over
whether direct cross-strait routes should be defined as
international or domestic.
</P>
<P>
Regarding the recognition of Chinese diplomas, Hsieh said it is a
much more complicated subject, and as China has a hostile
attitude toward Taiwan, he is not favor of any change in this
regard in the short term. He added that if Taiwan were to
acknowledge Chinese academic degrees, it could hurt Taiwan's
national interests and might cause a harmful impact on Taiwan's
educational system and school competition for students.
</P>
<P>
However, he added, all these issues can be resolved only through
dialogue, communication and negotiation between the two sides of
the Taiwan Strait.
