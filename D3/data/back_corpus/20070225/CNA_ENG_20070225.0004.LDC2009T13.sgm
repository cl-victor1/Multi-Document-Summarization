Taipei, Feb. 25 (CNA) 02/25/07  13:28:29 (By Y.C. Jou)

<P>
Premier Su Tseng-chang announced his bid to represent the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) in the 2008 presidential
election Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Su made the announcement at Fort San Domingo in Tamsui, Taipei
County. Choosing the historic site originally built by the
Spanish in 1628 and seen by the Taiwanese as a sign of the
country's previous foreign rulers, Su said Taiwan's democracy
must not step back and that "the owner of Fort San Domingo must
not change again."
</P>
<P>
Su said the people of Taiwan need a leader with "a blueprint for
governing the country as well as resolution, willpower and
executive ability that can make Taiwan keep advancing."
</P>
<P>
He said Taiwan needs to break constraints on its international
activities, form a united national identity, create new
opportunities for economic development, deal with new social
problems, promote quality of life, build a mature democratic
culture, re-establish the people's trust and seriously address
the challenges facing the next generation.
</P>
<P>
Su claimed that his personal history from a DPP founding member
to the party's chairman, from Pingtung county commissioner to
legislator,  Taipei  county commissioner,  Presidential  Office
secretary-general and premier proves him "trustworthy, capable
and honest."
</P>
<P>
Registration for the DPP's presidential primary is set to take
place March 5-9. Former Premier Frank Hsieh and DPP Chairman Yu
Shyi-kun have declared their bids to compete in the primary,
which according to the party leadership might not be held if
negotiations convened by President Chen Shui-bian successfully
determine the party's candidates for president and vice
president.
</P>
<P>
Su's declaration left Vice President Annette Lu the only one of
the four top DPP heavyweights expected to compete for the party's
nomination that had not announced her bid, while none of the
others had nominated their running mate.
