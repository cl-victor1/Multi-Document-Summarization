NEARLY HALF DESCRIBE ETHNIC PROBLEM AS 'SERIOUS': POLL
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  Feb. 25 (CNA) 02/25/07  18:25:54 (By Y.C. Jou)
</P>
<P>
More than 60 percent of Taiwanese citizens do not think the
identification of the late President Chiang Kai-shek as the prime
culprit behind the 228 Incident will harm harmony between ethnic
groups, according to the results of a survey released Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Three days prior to the 60th anniversary of the 1947 tragedy, the
Taiwan Thinktank held a news conference to announce the results
of its recent poll on public perceptions of the incident and
ethnic relations.
</P>
<P>
The 228 incident refers to an uprising against the corrupt
Kuomintang (KMT) regime, and the government's brutal crackdown on
Taiwanese people, who had just come under the China-based KMT
rule following the end of half a century of Japanese
colonization. Thousands  of  Taiwanese,  including  many  of  the
nation's intelligentsia, were murdered, leaving a scar on the
nation's collective memory that exists to this day.
</P>
<P>
On the question of whether they agreed that the identification of
Chiang as the prime culprit behind the incident could damage
relations between the country's ethnic groups, 60.9 percent of
the respondents said it would not while 27.9 percent said it
would.
</P>
<P>
"Ethnic groups" in Taiwan generally refer to Hoklo (or Hokkien) ,
Hakka, Waishengren and indigenous people.
</P>
<P>
A 600-page research report titled "The 228 Incident: A Record on
Responsibility" published by the semi-official 228 Incident
Memorial Foundation last year named the former strongman as the
person most responsible, raising controversy.
</P>
<P>
The poll results also said 46.7 percent of the respondents agreed
that efforts to clarify truth of the incident so far have been
insufficient; 43.8 said that commemorating the incident would
harm ethnic harmony, while 47.7 said it would not.
</P>
<P>
Asked whether the ethnic problem is serious, 47.3 percent said
yes while 38.7 said no, the think tank officials added.
</P>
<P>
Hsu Yung-ming, a political scientist at Academia Sinica, said at
the conference that the percentage of people perceiving serious
ethnic problems has risen significantly over the past two
decades. "The reason is the worsening of political conflicts, and
political leaders should properly address this problem," he said.
</P>
<P>
Chen Chun-kai, a professor of history at the Catholic Fu Jen
University,  said standing  institutions  should be set up to
investigate the 228 Incident as well as the "White Terror," the
KMT's violent purge of so-called "leftists" in the 1950s.
</P>
<P>
"Only  the  restoration  of  truth  and  clarification  of
responsibility can really improve ethnic harmony," Chen said.
</P>
<P>
The telephone poll was conducted Feb. 13-14 and received 936
valid responses.
