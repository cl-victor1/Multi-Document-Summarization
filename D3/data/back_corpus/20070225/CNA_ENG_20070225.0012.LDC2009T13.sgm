PFP TO COLLABORATE WITH KMT IN NEW LEGISLATIVE SESSION: PFP WHIP

Taipei, Feb.  25 (CNA) 02/25/07  17:19:33 (By Han Nai-kuo)

<P>
The opposition People First Party (PFP) will work closely with
its ally, the Kuomintang (KMT), in pushing through major
legislation in the new Legislative Yuan session, a PFP legislator
in charge of the party's policy said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Daniel Hwang, executive director of the PFP Policy Committee,
told reporters that a proposed amendment to the Organic Law of
the Central Election Commission (CEC) that failed to pass in the
last legislative session will continue to be a priority on the
legislative agenda when the legislature begins to screen draft
bills in early March.
</P>
<P>
Hwang said the PFP and the KMT will try to have the legislature
complete the third reading of the amendment in the new
legislative session because the legislation is needed to ensure a
fair and just presidential election in 2008.
</P>
<P>
He added that although the DPP opposed the amendment in the last
legislative session, the proposed legislation will get passed
easily in the new session as long as Legislative Yuan Speaker
Wang Jin-pyng is determined to enforce the legislative agenda.
</P>
<P>
The amendment proposed by the KMT would have the CEC's members
selected according to the ratio of seats held by each political
party in the legislature, instead of being nominated by the
premier and appointed by the president as is the case at present.
</P>
<P>
The KMT has complained that 15 of the 17 members currently
serving on the CEC are from the "pan-green camp" of the DPP and
its ally, the Taiwan Solidarity Union.
</P>
<P>
On the final day before the last legislative session ended Jan.
19, DPP legislators resorted to physical violence to block the
draft amendment from passing on the grounds that the budget bill
was more important and should have been reviewed first.
</P>
<P>
However, opposition legislators refused to make concessions to
the DPP lawmakers and insisted on pushing for a vote on the third
reading of the amendment.
</P>
<P>
To prevent the speaker from re-entering the legislative floor
after a recess to continue the legislative process, radical DPP
lawmakers even locked the main entrance to the legislature with a
motorcycle padlock.
</P>
<P>
The legislative session ended without passing any bills and left
the central government without a fiscal budget after the start of
the fiscal year for the first time in the nation's history.
