A three-year-old boy took part in a Chinese New Year calligraphy
activity Sunday in Taipei, gaining applause from the audience
when he completed and added a personal stamp to his work.

The boy, surnamed Lo, was accompanied by his family at the
calligraphy event. He wrote two Chinese couplets and his mother
said that as Lo's grandmother is a member of a Chinse calligraphy
association, he began to practice calligraphy at the age of two
and had learned a number of Chinese characters.

She added that the little boy's main recreational activities had
been limited to practicing calligraphy and memorizing Tang
Dynasty poems instead being allowed to play with toys or games.
