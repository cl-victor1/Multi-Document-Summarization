The government has stepped up checks at airports and seaports as
Taiwan holidaymakers return home from abroad at the end of the
Lunar New Year holiday, in a bid to keep contagious diseases at
bay, a health official said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The Center for Disease Control (CDC) under the Department of
Health has assigned extra manpower at the country's borders to
watch for the entry of Taiwan citizens who have made leisure
trips to Southeast Asia, China, Hong Kong and Macau and might be
carrying contagious diseases.
</P>
<P>
CDC Deputy Director-General Shih Wen-yi said traditionally, the
days after the Lunar New Year holiday sees the annual apex of the
risk of disease brought in by inbound passengers.
</P>
<P>
Shih said the CDC has tried hard to bar the entry of diseases
such as avian flu, arboviruses, intestinal and respiratory
diseases in general and dengue fever, influenza and bacillary
dysentery in particular.
</P>
<P>
Most recently, Shih said, two Taiwan citizens who had traveled to
Thailand for a few days had become infected with bacillary
dysentery, while 107 out of 109 reported dengue fever cases in
Taiwan last year were picked up on trips to Malaysia, Thailand,
the Philippines, Vietnam, Cambodia, Indonesia and Singapore.
</P>
<P>
Shih called for returning travelers to fill in forms at the
airport or seaport about their symptoms if they develop fever,
coughing, vomiting, diarrhea, rashes or jaundice.
</P>
<P>
People who develop such symptoms in the month after their return
from abroad should also report their conditions and disease
history to the health authorities, Shih noted.
