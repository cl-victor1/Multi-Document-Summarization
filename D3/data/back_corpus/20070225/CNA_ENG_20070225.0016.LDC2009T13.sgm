A total of 364 teams made up of college student volunteers went
to help students in 364 elementary and junior high schools  in
remote areas around the country during the just-concluded winter
vacation, officials from the National Youth Commission under the
Executive Yuan said Sunday.

<P>
The officials said the teams organized by the commission helped
students in remote areas to improve their reading skills and
learning ability during the winter vacation.

<P>
Ever since its inception in 2004, the officials said, the
program, which was set up by the youth commission and the
Ministry of Education, has attracted more than 44,000 college
students who have provided 880,000 hours of service to 170,000
students in 2,300 elementary and junior high schools.

<P>
In dollar value terms, these services would be worth NT$57
million (US$1.72 million) according to the minimum wage of NT$65
per hour set by the Council of Labor Affairs, the officials went
on.

Claiming that volunteer services help people foster an unselfish
and altruistic character and facilitate the development of a
civic society, the officials quoted National Youth Commission
Minister Cheng Li-chiun as saying that the commission will expand
its program into a "Ten Thousand Youths, Ten Thousand Volunteers"
campaign this year by enlisting the help of other government
ministries and the private sector.
