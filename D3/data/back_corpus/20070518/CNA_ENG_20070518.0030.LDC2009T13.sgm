Taipei,  May 18 (CNA) 05/18/07  19:47:06 (By Luis Huang)

Ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) Chairman Yu Shyi-kun
called Friday for unity among all contenders in the party's just-
concluded at-large legislative primary.
</P>
<P>
Yu made the remarks while discussing the results of the DPP's at-
large legislative primary, in which all the so-called "11
nemeses" -- as they are branded by some radical DPP supporters --
failed to make the "safe list" for at- large legislative seats.
</P>
<P>
Asked whether he is satisfied with the DPP's list unveiled a day
earlier, Yu said no electoral results will satisfy all
contenders, adding that should those who fail to make the list be
reluctant to accept the results with open- mindedness, they will
complain of the party's primaries being unfair.
</P>
<P>
Claiming that there is nothing wrong with the DPP's democratic
system,  Yu stated that as contenders for the DPP's at-large
legislative primary are all excellent, it is inevitable that
several of the talented hopefuls be eliminated from the list.
</P>
<P>
He also called for all DPP legislative primary contenders to join
forces to stump for the party's  candidates  in the year-end
legislative elections and the 2008 presidential race.
</P>
<P>
Asked what role the party's New Tide faction will play in the
future after suffering a humiliating setback in the primary, Yu
said the issue will be discussed after the elections and that the
DPP will welcome any suggestions with open arms.
</P>
<P>
He further claimed that all party factions had been disbanded
under a resolution adopted by the DPP National Congress at a
meeting held July 23, 2006.
