</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  May 18 (CNA) 05/18/07  16:24:09 (By Y.F. Low)

<P>
The Department of Health (DOH) has launched a hotline to help
expectant mothers quit smoking to reduce the potential dangers to
their unborns, DOH officials said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The 0800-636363 hotline is available from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m.,
Monday to Saturday, the officials said, adding that each pregnant
smoker needing help will be offered six to eight smoking
cessation counseling sessions via telephone over a two-month
period.
</P>
<P>
Expectant mothers who do not smoke can also call the hotline for
help to resolve the problem of second-hand smoke exposure and
persuade their husbands and other family members to kick the
habit, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
A survey conducted in 2006 by National Taipei College of Nursing
on pregnant women indicated that 6.6 percent of the respondents
were smokers.
</P>
<P>
With approximately 200,000 Taiwan women getting pregnant per
year, the ratio translates into 13,000 pregnant women being
smokers per year.
</P>
<P>
Also, the survey found that 55 percent of respondents were
exposed to second- hand smoke.
</P>
<P>
Lin Lien-chang, director of the DOH's smoking cessation hotline
service center, noted that pregnant smokers tend to have higher
risks of miscarriage and premature delivery than non-smokers,
while the chances of their babies being born with deformities,
low birth weight or cleft lip are also higher.
</P>
<P>
Citing the results of a study by British researchers, Lin said
there is a 49 percent success rate for pregnant smokers to kick
the habit under professional guidance owing to their concern for
their babies' health, compared with just 20 percent among other
smokers.
</P>
<P>
However, the study also found that a high percentage of these
women will pick up the habit again three to six months after
delivery, Lin said, pointing out that smoking usually becomes an
excuse to relieve stress among post-natal women, especially when
they face "the double pressure of life and child care."
</P>
<P>
He said the smoking cessation hotline is aimed at assisting
pregnant smokers recognize their roles as mothers and thus give
up cigarettes for good.
