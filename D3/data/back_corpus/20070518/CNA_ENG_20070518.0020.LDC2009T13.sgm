The 2007 Taiwan International Motorcycle Industry Show opened
Friday at the Taipei World Trade Center's Exhibition Hall 3 under
the auspices of the quasi- official Taiwan External  Trade
Development  Council  (TAITRA)  and the Taiwan Transportation
Vehicle Manufacturers Association.

According to the organizers, a total of 166 exhibitors from
Taiwan and abroad have set up 370 booths, an increase of 25
percent over last year's show, to present their latest motorbike
models and accessories during the exhibition, which will run
through May 20.

The exhibitors include local agents of renowned motorcycle brand
names, such as Japan's Suzuki, Italy's Bimota and Piaggio, as
well as suppliers of whole motorcycles, heavy-duty motorcycles,
motorcycle parts and components from Taiwan, China, Pakistan,
India and Vietnam.

States' Polaris Industries, will visit the show to look for
business partners in Taiwan.

In addition to booths showcasing complete motorcycles, parts and
accessories, as well as maintenance and inspection equipment, a
special area has been designed to display fancy,  dressed-up
motorcycles remodeled in Taiwan with a view to luring buyers and
promoting opportunities for parts manufacturers to do remodeling
work.

During the three-day show, four seminars will be held at the
exhibition site to help participants in the show keep pace with
new trends in the global motorcycle industry.
