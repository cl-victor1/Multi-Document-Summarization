DPP'S LINEUP FOR AT-LARGE SEATS IN NEXT LEGISLATURE
`DISAPPOINTING'
</HEADLINE>

Taipei, May 18 (CNA) 05/18/07  20:45:56 (By Han Nai-kuo)

<P>
Several legislators of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) expressed disappointment Friday with the lineup for the
party's legislators-at-large in the next legislature, claiming
that it "does not measure up to the expectations of the majority
of the people."
</P>
<P>
Legislator Wang Tuo, a whip of the DPP legislative caucus, told
reporters it was sad to see that some contenders who won only 40
percent approval ratings in the May 14-16 public opinion polls
are guaranteed an at-large seat in the next legislature, while
contenders with approval ratings higher than 50 percent are not.
</P>
<P>
In the DPP primaries, results from public opinion polls accounted
for 60 percent of the final decisions, with the remaining 40
percent relying on the results of a May 6 vote by party members.
</P>
<P>
As for the DPP candidates who won the right to compete for
district seats in the year-end legislative elections, Wang
claimed they won the nominations mainly because the public
opinion polls relied on by the primaries were designed in such a
way as to exclude all respondents considered to be supporters of
the opposition Kuomintang and its ally, the People First Party.
</P>
<P>
Wang expressed concern that as a result of the party's "improper"
practice, former Premier Frank Hsieh, the DPP's presidential
nominee, might "reap disastrous consequences" in the 2008
election.
</P>
<P>
DPP legislator-at-large Hsu Jung-shu said she "felt empty inside"
when she learned of the DPP lineup for at-large seats.
</P>
<P>
Hsu said she is worried about the future of the DPP and that of
Taiwan because the DPP has become a party no longer tolerant of
criticism, leaving the impression that the party has lost the
ability to reflect upon itself.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on speculation that DPP Chairman Yu Shyh-kun, who has
the power to appoint four legislators-at-large to supplement the
top eight contenders -- half men and half women -- might favor a
hardcore member of the party as his first choice, DPP Legislator
Cheng Yun-peng cautioned that the four at-large seats should go
to DPP members  who  either  have  special  expertise  or
represent less-privileged groups.
</P>
<P>
The DPP's lineup for legislators-at-large  consists  of 19
hopefuls. If the DPP can maintain the same percentage of votes it
won in the previous legislative elections, the party should be
able to have 12 at-large seats in the next legislature, with one-
third of them to be appointed by the DPP chairman.
</P>
<P>
According to law, half of the at-large legislative seats must be
reserved for women.
</P>
<P>
They four top male hopefuls who are assured of an at-large seat
are: DPP Deputy Secretary-General Tsai Huang-liang, former
Department of Health Minister Tu Sing-jhe, Legislator  Wang Sing-
nan and Legislator Gao Jyh-peng, while the four top women
lawmakers-to-be are: Council for Hakka Affairs Vice Chairwoman
Chiu Yi-ying, Legislator Hsueh Lin, former Changhua County
Magistrate Wong Chin-chu and Legislator Tien Chiu-chin.
</P>
<P>
Whether the reform-minded hopefuls on the list -- former Council
of Hakka Affairs Chairman Lo Wen-chia, five-term Legislator Hong
Chi-chang and four-term former Legislator Shen Fu-hsiung -- will
get an at-large seat will depend on if the DPP can garner enough
voter support in the legislative elections.
</P>
<P>
The "single-member constituency, two-vote system" adopted for the
year-end elections will see the number of legislators slashed
from the current 225 to 113, and their terms extended from three
years to four.
</P>
<P>
Voters will cast one vote for a candidate and the other vote to
choose  a political  party.  The  DPP can expect  to appoint
proportionately more legislators-at-large if it performs well in
the second category.
