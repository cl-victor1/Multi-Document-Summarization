CHINA PLOTS TO CHANGE TAIWAN'S MEMBERSHIP NAME IN ANIMAL HEALTH
GROUP

Taipei,  May 18 (CNA) 05/18/07  13:18:27 (By Y.F. Low)
</P>
<P>
In yet another move to suppress Taiwan's participation in
international organizations, China is orchestrating a plot to
change Taiwan's membership name in the World Organization for
Animal Health (OIE) to downgrade the country's status to that of
a regional member, Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) officials
said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
China  has put forth  a draft  resolution,  intended  for
consideration during the OIE's 75th general session slated for
May 20-25 in Paris, to change Taiwan's membership name from
"Taipei China" to "Taiwan, China," MOFA officials said.
</P>
<P>
According to the officials, Taiwan reluctantly accepted the name
"Taipei China" in 1992 because without a comma in between,
"Taipei" and "China" are parallel.
</P>
<P>
But Taiwan will never accept the name "Taipei, China" or "Taiwan,
China, " since it means Taiwan is subordinate to China, they
explained.
</P>
<P>
In the draft resolution, China claims the proposed name-change is
intended to restore its legitimate rights at the OIE, where it
gained membership as a sovereign state, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
China claims that Taiwan has taken part in the OIE as a "regional
member" and that it can only use the name "Taiwan, China" in OIE
activities, documents and publications.
</P>
<P>
The OIE, founded in 1924 in Paris, is an intergovernmental
organization consisting of 168 member nations with the objective
of controlling and preventing animal diseases.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan gained accession to the OIE in 1954 under the name of
"Republic of China (Taiwan) , but it was forced to change its
membership name to "Taipei China" after China was admitted to the
organization in 1992.
</P>
<P>
However, China remains dissatisfied with the alteration. In an
attempt to push the OIE to make further moves to change Taiwan's
membership name, China has refused to participate in OIE affairs
and pay its membership fees.
</P>
<P>
To try to resolve the problem, the OIE's International Committee
proposed in 2003 that Taiwan adopt the membership name of "the
Separate Customs Territory of Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen and Matsu"
-- the one that Taiwan used to join the World Trade Organization
in 2002. But neither Taiwan nor China accepted the proposal.
