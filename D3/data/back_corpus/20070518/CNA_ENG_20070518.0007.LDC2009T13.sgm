PREMIER-DESIGNATE WORKING TO FORM CABINET FREE OF FACTIONAL RIFTS
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  May 18 (CNA) 05/18/07  12:36:37 (By Deborah Kuo)

Premier-designate Chang Chun-hsiung assured the country Friday
that the process of forming the new Cabinet lineup has not been
influenced by factional considerations and that his goal is to
fashion an administrative team that everyone can accept and that
is free of factional rifts and wrangling over the party's
primaries.
</P>
<P>
Chang, chairman of the Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF), who was
appointed by President Chen Shui-bian as the new premier Monday
to succeed outgoing Premier Su Tseng-chang, discounted
allegations that there have been twists and turns in the
personnel reshuffle process over the past several days under a
shroud of tug of war between Su and New Tide faction leaners and
their opponents.
</P>
<P>
Chang, who served as the first Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)
premier between 2000-2002, said at the Legislative Yuan Friday
that he is keeping himself totally open during the talent
scouting and consulting process in efforts to shape his new
Cabinet as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
Chang is being allowed a very short period of time to shape his
new Cabinet, some political observers said Thursday, adding that
the Chang administration is expected to be on track soon, given
that the former premier and SEF chairman has no faction
affiliations and is enjoying a free hand in conducting the
personnel reshuffle.
</P>
<P>
On legislators' questions about whether former Chief of the
General Staff Lee Tien-yu will be appointed to succeed Lee Jye as
minister of national defense, Chang declined to give a positive
answer, only saying that he will continue to consult with
President Chen on appointments for important posts before making
any final decisions.
</P>
<P>
Chang was appointed by Chen as the new premier after Su submitted
his resignation May 12, one week after he lost the ruling DPP
presidential primary to his predecessor Frank Hsieh.
</P>
<P>
Chang announced a second wave of personnel appointments Thursday
for his new Cabinet, which is scheduled to be sworn in next
Monday.
</P>
<P>
In the first  wave announced  Wednesday,  Chang  appointed
Presidential Office Secretary-General Chiou I-jen as the new vice
premier and Deputy Transportation and Communications Minister
Chen Ching-chun as the next Executive Yuan secretary-general.
</P>
<P>
Upon appointing Chang as the new premier, Chen put forward five
directives for Chang to oversee day-to-day administration. The
five directives  are:  Insist on Taiwan-centric  consciousness
and materialize social justice; secure development with an
environmental protection mindset; promote what is beneficial and
abolish what is harmful; take good care of the central and
southern regions, middle and  lower-echelons  of society,  and
small-  and medium-sized enterprises; and run the government
humbly and consolidate Taiwan powerfully.
