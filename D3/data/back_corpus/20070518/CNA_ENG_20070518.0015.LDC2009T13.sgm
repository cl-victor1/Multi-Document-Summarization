The "Wan An No. 30" air raid drill began in eight cities and
counties in central Taiwan simultaneously with sirens sounding in
these areas at 5:30 a.m. Friday.

Police, civilian defense corps and military police in the cities
and counties were mobilized to guide people away from streets and
roads before the launch of the drill, which simulated a massive
air attack by enemy forces.

In the drill, the governments of the affected cities and counties
practiced taking immediate measures to address heavy civilian
casualties by performing simulated operations, including setting
up shelter centers and conducting rescue work.

The drill was supervised by Air Force Lt. Gen. Liu Yi-tien, who
arrived in Taichung City half an hour before the drill began.
