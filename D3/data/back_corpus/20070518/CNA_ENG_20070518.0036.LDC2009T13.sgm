A tourist from Xiamen in China's Fujian Province might have
sneaked into Taiwan from outlying Kinmen Island with help of
local human traffickers, and police are searching for him, Kinmen
county officials said Friday.
</P>
<P>
According to Kinmen tourism bureau officials, the 19-year-old
tourist, surnamed Wei, might have entered Taiwan via Kinmen,
where he arrived Monday with a 17-member group from Xiamen for a
three-day tour.
</P>
<P>
The local travel agency that organized the tour reported the case
to Kinmen police after searching in vain for Wei across Kinmen
until Tuesday, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
An initial police investigation shows that Wei left the hotel
with his tour group Tuesday morning after receiving a cell phone
call at around 8 a.m. -- an indication that his flight might have
been arranged in advance by human smugglers.
</P>
<P>
Wei's absconding is the first of its kind over the past few years
since Fujian tourists were allowed to make sight-seeing trips to
Kinmen via the direct shipping services between the two sides --
commonly known as the "mini three links" -- from December 2004.
</P>
<P>
According to Kinmen tourism bureau officials, more than 33,000
Fujian residents have visited Kinmen since that time. Kinmen lies
close to Fujian on the other side of the Taiwan Strait.
</P>
<P>
Kinmen officials have informed air and sea ports and immigration
authorities of Wei's absconding and have asked local travel
agencies catering to Chinese tourists to stay on alert and
prevent similar cases, the officials said, adding that the top
priority is to trace the human cargo traffickers believed to be
involved in Wei's case.
