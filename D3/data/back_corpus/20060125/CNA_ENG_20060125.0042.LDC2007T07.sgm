NEW PREMIER VOWS TO 'TAKE RIGHT PATH'
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taipei, Jan. 25 (CNA) (By Sofia Wu)
</P>
<P>
New Premier Su Tseng-chang took office with a new Cabinet Wednesday,
pledging to "take the right path and do the right thing."
</P>
<P>
Su, 59, made the remarks after taking over the official seal from his
predecessor Frank Hsieh at a changeover ceremony at the Executive
Yuan.
</P>
<P>
Su vowed to form a clean government, aiming to recoup public support
for the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) after a humiliating
election defeat and a spate of alleged corruption scandals damaged the
party's image last year.
</P>
<P>
"We especially hope that upon a fine base left by Premier Hsieh and
his predecessors and colleagues, we can accomplish the president's
many previously expressed courses of action and wishes, in particular
his most recent statement on New Year's Day, " said Su, a former DPP
chairman.
</P>
<P>
President Chen Shui-bian appointed Su to the premiership last week
after Hsieh offered to resign over disagreements with Chen's hardline
policy toward China.
</P>
<P>
Su's Cabinet team is a mixture of old and new. Su selected Tsai Ing-
wen as vice premier. Tsai, formerly a lawmaker who had also served as
head of the Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) which charts Taiwan's
policy on relations with China. Tsai is expected to fill in some gaps
for Su, who has keen political skills but little experience in
international affairs and China policies.
</P>
<P>
MAC Chairman Joseph Wu and Minister of National Defense Lee Jye are
staying in place.
</P>
<P>
For his economic team, Su recruited top managers from state-run
enterprises. Former Bank of Taiwan Chairman Joseph Lyu took over the
Ministry of Finance, while utility Taiwan Power Co. Chairman Morgan
Hwang became economics minister. President Chen's deputy chief-of-
staff James Huang is the new foreign minister.
