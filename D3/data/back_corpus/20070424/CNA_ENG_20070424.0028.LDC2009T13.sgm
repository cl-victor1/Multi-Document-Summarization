CHARGES DROPPED AGAINST EX-KMT CHIEF OVER REMARKS AIMED AT CHEN
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  April  24 (CNA) 04/24/07  18:28:51 (By Flor Wang)

The prosecution decided not to indict former main opposition
Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Ma Ying-jeou over his remarks last year
regarding President Chen Shui- bian amid a presidential recall
drive in the legislature, the Taipei Prosecutors Office said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Taipei Prosecutors Office said there was no evidence that Ma
had intention to drive others to commit crimes or to disrupt
public order when he claimed in early June, 2006 that "the gun
was loaded" and that "Chen would end up in a foul death" at a
time when lawmakers were to vote on the presidential recall
motion.
</P>
<P>
The prosecutor in charge of the probe on the case found that Ma's
rhetoric was a means of pushing Chen, whom they described as a
"corrupt-ridden" president, to step down following a February
launch of a recall motion by lawmakers of the KMT and the People
First Party.
</P>
<P>
A group of Tainan city councilors of the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party then lodged a complaint against Ma with the
Tainan District Prosecutors Office in mid-June of the same year,
accusing him of "enticing others to conduct criminal activities
by making the remarks."
</P>
<P>
But the case was transferred to the Taipei District Prosecutors
Office, which dealt with it as an allegation against public order
and never questioned Ma, as the Article 11 of the Constitution
guarantees freedom of speech.
</P>
<P>
The Taipei prosecutor responsible for handling the case said that
relevant remarks made by Ma in the print and electronic media
showed what Ma meant is that Chen would lose all public respect
-- meaning that he might face the end of his political career --
if the presidential recall motion were to be approved at the
Legislative Yuan.
</P>
<P>
As chief of the main opposition part by that time, Ma had the
responsibility of scrutinizing the government's operations for
the sake of public interests, although his criticism might sound
sensationalistic, the prosecutor said.
