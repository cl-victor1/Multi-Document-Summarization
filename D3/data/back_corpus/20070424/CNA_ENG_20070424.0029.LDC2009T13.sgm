MEDICAL PROFESSIONALS URGE GOVERNMENT TO UPGRADE VACCINATION
POLICY

Taipei, April 24 (CNA) 04/24/07  18:30:16 (By Elizabeth Hsu)

Medical professionals urged the government Tuesday to begin to
evaluate the possibility of including several new types of
vaccine in the existing state- financed inoculation program.
</P>
<P>
Conveners of the new "Taiwan Vaccine Promotion League", including
former Minister of Health Twu Shing-jer, made the call at a press
conference the league held to publicize their message that the
government's preventive inoculation policy has lagged behind
world standards over the past 20 years.
</P>
<P>
Twu said Taiwan has not progressed since 1984 when it began to
freely inoculate newborns with a vaccine against hepatitis B. At
the time, it was a cutting edge practice and contributed
significantly to Taiwan's efforts to reduce the prevalence of
hepatitis and live cancer, he noted.
</P>
<P>
However, since then, the country's preemptive care practices have
not improved. For example,  Twu indicated,  74 countries have
introduced a vaccine against streptococcus pneumoniae since the
World Health Organization released an assessment a few years ago,
showing that some 1 million young children aged under 5 in around
the world die of streptococcus pneumoniae (S.P.) infection every
year.
</P>
<P>
Seventeen of those nations have even listed inoculation with S.P.
vaccine in their state-funded regular inoculation programs Twu
added, noting that in comparison, Taiwan has thus far been
reluctant to follow suit despite of the fact that drug resistant
S.P. infections have  become  common  on the  island where
antibiotics  are over-prescribed.
</P>
<P>
Pediatrician Lee Pin-ying at the National Taiwan University
Hospital blamed ongoing,  "outdated"  practices associated with
preventive inoculation on a lack of funds. Parents of young
children must pay for the vaccine against new viruses or
bacteria, he said, arguing if all children enjoyed the right to
vote, the government would have long since offered them free
inoculations just as it provides stipends to the elderly.
</P>
<P>
In response to the call, Lin Tung, deputy director of the Center
for Disease Control under the Department of Health (DOH) ,
admitted that the current level of funding for regular
inoculation is inadequate to include new vaccines, saying that
the central and local governments allocated a total of NT$570
million (US$17.15 million) for the regular inoculation every
year.
</P>
<P>
However, the DOH has worked out a medium-term plan in a bid for
governmental funds that includes new types of vaccines like that
against new-type whooping cough and S. P. in the regular
inoculation regime for young children, Lin added.
</P>
<P>
Types of vaccine in the existing regular inoculation practice for
children include neonatal hepatitis B vaccine, BCG vaccine, the
three-in-one vaccine against diphtheria, pertussis and tetanus,
the three-in-one vaccine against measles, mumps and rubella, the
vaccine against Japanese encephalitis, and polomyelitis oral
vaccine.
</P>
<P>
Members of the vaccine promotion  league also include Lee Ching-
yu, a honorary professor at the National Taiwan University's
Medical Institute, who is known as the father of vaccine in
Taiwan; Lin Chou-yien, president of the Chang Gung Children's
Hospital; Huang Fu-yuan, chairman of the Taiwan Pediatric
Association; and Chuang Tzai-cheng, director of the vaccine
center of the National Health Research Institutes.
