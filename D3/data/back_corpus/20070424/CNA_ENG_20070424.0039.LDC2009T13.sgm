The Second Boashan reservoir in Hsinchu County, completed a year
ago, will be filled to capacity with water in July after a safety
evaluation is conducted on the dam in the next two months, water
resources officials said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The officials from the Water Resources Agency under the Ministry
of Economic Affairs told reporters that the reservoir is now 61.3
percent full, with the water level at 140.47 meters.
</P>
<P>
When filled to capacity, the reservoir will hold 32.18 million
tons of water and will be able to provide an additional 191,500
tons of water per day for household and industrial use in Hsinchu
County, in addition to the 90,000 tons a day currently supplied
by the First Baoshan reservoir, located three kilometers to the
north, according to the officials.
</P>
<P>
The two reservoirs, together with the Dapu reservoir, will be
able to meet Hsinchu County's water needs until 2021, they added.
</P>
<P>
The Second Baoshan reservoir is located on the upper reaches of
the Shihching stream in Baoshan township. Construction began in
1997 after the government recognized the need to keep pace with
growing water demand as a result of the Hsinchu Science Park's
second- and third-phase expansion projects.
</P>
<P>
The First Baoshan Reservoir was completed in June 2006 at a cost
of NT$10.5 billion (US$316 million).
