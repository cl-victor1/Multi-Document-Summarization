Several civil social welfare organizations Tuesday urged the
ruling and opposition parties not to propose unrealistic raises
in stipend paid to the elderly as the approach of the year-end
legislative election and the 2008 presidential election.
</P>
<P>
The civil groups, including the Parents' Association for Persons
with Intellectual Disabilities, the League of Welfare
Organizations for Disabled, the League of Welfare Improvement for
Older People (LWIOP) , and the Taiwan Association of Family
Caregivers, held a joint press conference to release their
statements and criticized some politicians for attempting to "buy
votes" through raising the dollars attached to various existing
stipend programs.
</P>
<P>
The legislative committees of health, environment and social
welfare have decided to screen the existing provisional
regulations on welfare subsidies to the elderly Wednesday. It is
said that lawmakers have prepared 25 different versions of
amendment proposals, all aimed at increasing the elderly's
stipend, with some suggesting a raise from the current NT$3,000
(US$90) to NT$4,000, NT$6,000 or even NT$10,000.
</P>
<P>
Whenever there is an election, there are politicians ready to
write checks for those persons who are socially less privileged
in an attempt to buy their votes, criticized LWIOP Secretary-
General Wu Yu-chin.
</P>
<P>
But social welfare services can't be confined to the practice of
offering stipends, Wu said, noting cash cannot improve people's
life, but that can be accomplished given a sound, healthy social
welfare system.
</P>
<P>
While over 90 percent of the government's current social welfare
budget is spent covering various kinds of stipend programs, the
groups urged ruling and opposition parties to respect the
conclusion of the 2006 national conference on sustaining Taiwan's
economic development and forgo inflating existing social welfare
stipend programs  until the long-planned  national  pension
program is implemented.
