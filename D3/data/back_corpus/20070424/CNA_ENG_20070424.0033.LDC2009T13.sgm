KMT CENTRAL WILL NOT DICTATE RULE CHANGE: PARTY OFFICIAL
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taipei,  April 24 (CNA) 04/24/07  19:42:46 (By Flor Wang)
</P>
<P>
The Kuomingtang's (KMT) central committee will not impose a
proposed change to its charter regarding the party's requirements
for presidential candidates in the upcoming national congress,
KMT Secretary-General Wu Duen-yih said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Wu's remarks came amid rampant rumors that the main opposition
KMT is planning to modify its charter to secure former party
chairman Ma Ying-jeou's chances of taking part in the 2008
presidential election despite being indicted on corruption
charges this February. The KMT charter presently bans party
members convicted in the first trial from running for office.
</P>
<P>
According to Wu, the KMT is slated to hold the second conference
of its 17th plenary session June 24, at which time party
delegates from across the country will deal with charter revision
proposals, including the one pertaining to presidential
candidacy.
</P>
<P>
For the KMT, it is a routine to screen proposals to revise the
party charter during its plenary sessions every year, and only
qualified party delegates at a national congress are entitled to
decide on changes, he said, adding that a party task force led by
Vice Chairman John C. Kuan is only in charge of collecting
opinions with regard to such issues.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a proposed amendment to the Presidential and Vice
Presidential Election and Recall Law submitted by the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) was killed early the same day
at the legislative Procedure Committee as a result of the joint
efforts of KMT lawmakers and their counterparts in the People
First Party (PFP).
</P>
<P>
The bill, which sought to bar citizens convicted on corruption
charges from participating in presidential elections, was
apparently directed at Ma -- widely assumed to be a strong
contender in the 2008 presidential race despite embezzlement
charges against him in a case related to funds from a special
monthly municipal allowance earmarked for his discretionary use
when he served as mayor of Taipei from 1998-2006.
</P>
<P>
Along with the so-called "Ma exclusion bill, " another bill
initiated by the Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU) , an ally of the
DPP, to demand that the KMT return its illegally acquired assets
to the national coffers was also blocked.
</P>
<P>
The two draft amendments could pose major setbacks to the main
opposition KMT's quest to take back power in the next
presidential election. Against that back drop, the KMT needs PFP
cooperation to prevent the proposals from clearing the committee
for further reading.
</P>
<P>
PFP and KMT lawmakers vetoed the two bills in a concerted move in
Tuesday's committee session after the two parties inked a 7-point
pledge late last week regarding cooperation in December's
legislative elections.
