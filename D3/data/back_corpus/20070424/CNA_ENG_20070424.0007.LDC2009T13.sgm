Taipei,  April 23 (CNA) 04/24/07  09:42:14 (By Flor Wang)

<P>
Premier Su Tseng-chang voiced agreement Monday with the idea of
combining the upcoming legislative and presidential elections,
but said the decision to be rendered by the Central Election
Commission (CEC) should be respected.
</P>
<P>
Su made the comments in an exclusive interview with the Central
News Agency.
</P>
<P>
According to Su, the public should be willing to see the two
high-profile elections combined as doing so is more cost-
effective. The legislative election is set for December this
year, while the presidential race is slated for March, 2008.
</P>
<P>
However, the premier said that he is not in a position to ask the
CEC do so because the issue must be decided by the CEC -- the
central government agency in charge of national electoral
affairs.
</P>
<P>
What is more, he said, the CEC organic law has been stonewalled
in the Legislative Yuan for some time due to the boycott by the
opposition "pan-blue alliance, " preventing a new CEC from being
set up so as to make a final decision on the issue.
</P>
<P>
Commenting  on another proposal,  which would allow public
referendums to be held along with presidential elections, Su
called the proposal a commonplace measure in all democratic
nations and questioned why the main opposition Kuomintang views
it as a "monstrosity."
</P>
<P>
As to an inquiry on whether he would consider resigning from the
premiership should he outgun his rivals in the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party's presidential primary, Su responded that he
will fully delve into the matter if he wins the party's
nomination.
</P>
<P>
Stressing that he has stayed as premier under instructions from
President Chen Shui-bian, Su said that he will not step down from
the post simply because doing so would make it easier for him to
vie for the party's presidential nomination by freeing him of a
shadow cast by allegations that he can easily allocate
administrative resources to campaign for himself or craft
policies to lure voter support.
</P>
<P>
Su also dismissed rumors that there will be a partial re-shuffle
of the Cabinet, saying that all present Cabinet members are well
placed and that he will not make any adjustments in the short
term.
</P>
<P>
Regarding a DPP central committee proposal that the first two
winners in the presidential primary pair up a ticket to run in
the next presidential election, he said that "ideals and
philosophy" on the administration of the nation are more
important to him in terms of selecting a running mate.
