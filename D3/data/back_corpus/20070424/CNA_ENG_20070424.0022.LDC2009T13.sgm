MERGER OF KMT, PFP NO EASY TASK: LEGISLATIVE SPEAKER
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taipei,  April 24 (CNA) 04/24/07  16:34:58 (By Lilian Wu)
</P>
<P>
Legislative Speaker Wang Jin-pyng said Tuesday that the merger of
the opposition Kuomintang and the People First Party (PFP) will
not be easy, and that a lot of issues will have to be discussed
and arranged.
</P>
<P>
Wang made the remarks on the sidelines of an international
symposium  on transitional  justice and national reconciliation
sponsored by the Taiwan Foundation for Democracy (TFD) , for
which Wang serves as the chairman.
</P>
<P>
Wang said that the KMT and the PFP, a splinter party of the KMT,
will have to "meet, talk and make compromises, " saying that such
actions will, to a greater degree, conform to the "political
reality."
</P>
<P>
The year-end legislative elections will see the introduction of a
new "single- seat  constituency,  two ballots" electoral system,
replacing the existing "single vote, multiple-seat constituency"
system. Voters will cast two ballots, one for their constituency
representative and another for their favored political party.
</P>
<P>
The 225-seat legislature will also be halved to 113 members, with
73 seats elected from regional districts, six seats elected by
aboriginal representatives, and 34 seats for at-large and
overseas expatriate representatives.
</P>
<P>
Faced with a streamlined legislature, the competition among the
legislative hopefuls has been especially fierce. Nonetheless,
reports have said that the main opposition KMT is willing to
yield some at-large seats to the PFP or the Non-Partisan
Solidarity Union to forge a formidable opposition alliance.
</P>
<P>
Asked about the timing for the merge of the opposition parties,
Wang said that as long as the parties involved are sincere, then
"the sooner the talks begin the better."
