The Taiwan High Speed Railway, which has shortened travel time
between Taipei and Kaohsiung,  has thus increased the chances of
single people from different areas getting together, a dating
club opertor said Tuesday.

<P>
The 90-minute travel time between Taipei in the north and
Kaohsiung in the south extends single people's limited social
circles, making it easier for them to take part in activities in
other areas so that their chances of finding dates are increased,
said Lu Juei-chi, chief of the SIP dating club.

<P>
Lu said the number of single people taking part in activities in
January is 30 percent higher than the same period of 2006. An SIP
survey shows that 70 percent of its 700-odd members would like to
extend their social circle to the whole country using the new
bullet train.

For example, one 35-year-old identified only as "Kevin" said he
is willing to be a "High Speed Rail groom" because the journey
time is short, while a 26-year-old Miss Cheng said the ticket
price is worth it if it helps her find a man, according to Lu.
