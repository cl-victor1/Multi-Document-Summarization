Taipei,  Jan.  23 (CNA) 01/23/07  21:50:52 (By T.C. Jiang)

The National Palace Museum in Taipei has recently received
donations of Thai ceramic works and palm-leaf manuscripts from
Bangkok University's Southeast Asian Ceramics Museum and a local
art collector, respectively, for the museum's southern branch.
</P>
<P>
The southern branch, currently under construction in southern
Chiayi County, is scheduled to open in 2011.
</P>
<P>
Palace Museum officials made the announcement Monday at a
ceremony in which the museum presented awards to thank the
Southeast Asian Ceramics Museum's curator Dr. Roxanna Brown and
the art collector Lu Chong-hsiung.
</P>
<P>
In 2004, Brown was invited to give a one-week series of lectures
at the museum. During her stay, Brown learned that the southern
branch museum would feature Asian arts. As a result, Bangkok
University's board of directors later decided to donate six Thai
ceramic works to the museum.

<P>
The officials said that the donation, made last July, not only
marks the first time the National Palace Museum has received art
works from a foreign counterpart, but also represents a valuable
gain in Asian art studies.
</P>
<P>
The Thai ceramic works formally became part of the museum's
collection last December, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
The officials further said that the palm-leaf manuscripts are
ancient documents and Buddhist Scriptures written in Pali or
Burmese and that they represent a certain regional culture in
South Asia or Southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
The officials said that Lu is Taiwan's biggest collector of palm-
leaf manuscripts and that he has made such donations to the
museum in the past.
</P>
<P>
The museum is now asking language experts to help translate the
palm-leaf manuscripts, which the officials claimed were read
aloud by nobles between the late 18th century and early 20th
century.
