HIGH-SPEED RAIL'S TAIPEI-BANCIAO SECTION GETS CONDITIONAL
APPROVAL TO OPEN
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taipei, Jan. 22 (CNA) 01/23/07  12:34:46 (By Sofia Wu)
</P>
<P>
The Taipei-Banciao section of the country's first high-speed rail
system was given conditional approval Monday to open for service,
with members of an inspection committee outlining six defects
that need to be dealt with before they give the green light.
</P>
<P>
Vice Minister of Transportation and Communications Ho Nuan-hsuan
made the announcement at the conclusion of a final review meeting
of the ad hoc inspection committee organized by the Ministry of
Transportation and Communications (MOTC).
</P>
<P>
Nine engineering experts inspected the bullet train system's
final 5-kilometer section linking Banciao in Taipei County with
Taipei City over the weekend. The experts came up with a review
report at the meeting in which six defects were listed.
</P>
<P>
Noting that none of the defects are related to the railway's core
system, Ho said the problems mainly lie with its signage system.
</P>
<P>
According to Ho, the committee most wants Taiwan High Speed Rail
Corp. (THSR) -- the bullet train operator -- to improve signage
at Taipei Main Station, enhance directional signs to clearly
indicate the location of fire extinguishers on the carriage, and
map out a comprehensive passenger dispersal plan at Taipei
Station for the upcoming Chinese New Year holiday.
</P>
<P>
The committee also demands that the THSR further check whether
air conditioning compressor cover plates at platforms were
properly installed,  improve information and directional  signs
for its ticketing facilities at Taipei Station, and practice
operational rules for simultaneous embarkation and disembarkation
by four physically challenged passengers.
</P>
<P>
Ho said the MOTC will verify whether the THSR has rectified the
first five defects or deficiencies, while the inspection
committee will review the drill with regard to embarkation and
disembarkation by the physically challenged.
</P>
<P>
"The MOTC will not approve the opening of the Banciao-Taipei
section to service until after all the six defects are
corrected," Ho said.
</P>
<P>
Since none of the defects that need to be addressed are related
with the railway's core system, MOTC sources said, the THSR is
expected to complete all improvement work by the end of January
and obtain the operational license in time for the Banciao-Taipei
section to join commercial operations early next month.
</P>
<P>
The THSR began its bullet train service between Banciao and its
southern terminus Zuoying Jan. 5. The offering of half-price
tickets was originally scheduled to end Jan. 14 but was later
extended to Jan. 31 due to some embarrassing technical glitches,
particularly with the ticketing system.
</P>
<P>
Ho said the THSR's sometimes chaotic ticket selling operations
and problems with its automatic ticket gates were not subject to
tests in the just-concluded review.
</P>
<P>
"As the THSR has continued improving its ticketing system, we are
willing to give the company a bit more time to rectify its flaws,
" Ho said, adding that ticket-related operations are included in
the list of items that need to be perfected gradually and
continuously.
</P>
<P>
Once the Banciao-Taipei section opens, Ho said, the 14 ticket
gates at the Taipei station will become operational, which will
help improve the whole rail system's ticket checking operations.
At present, Banciao Station has only six ticket gates.
</P>
<P>
If all goes well, industry sources said, the Taipei-Banciao
section will open between early February and Chinese New Year,
which falls on Feb. 18 this year.
</P>
<P>
After the inauguration of the section, the current 19 northbound
and 19 southbound trains each day between Zuoying and Banciao
will be extended to Taipei City.
</P>
<P>
The Taipei-Banciao section will be the shortest distance of the
345-km high speed railway, with the standard fare being set at
NT$40 (US$1.22). The Taipei- Taoyuan fare will be NT$160, the
Taipei-Hsinchu fare will be NT$290, the Taipei- Taichung fare
will be NT$700, the Taipei-Chiayi fare will be NT$1,080, the
Taipei-Tainan fare will be NT$1,350, and the Taipei-Kaohsiung
will be NT$1,490.
