The Cabinet-level Council of Agriculture (COA) is resolved to
help boost sales of Taiwan fruit both at home and abroad, Council
of Agriculture (COA) Chairman Su Jia-chyuan announced Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a news conference  held to explain the COA's
achievements last year and its outlook for the coming year, Su
said the council has ironed out a series of action guidelines and
promotional incentives to boost sales.
</P>
<P>
According to Su, the COA will help local farmers grow high
quality fruit and raise public interest in consuming locally
produced fresh and safe produce.
</P>
<P>
The COA is planning to set up a platform upon which local
consumers can purchase fine quality products, he said, adding
that it will also cooperate  with retail stores to increase sales
by sponsoring an activity to select the "top 10 most popular
fruit in Taiwan" in the hope of getting the public to consume
more locally cultivated goods, Su said.
</P>
<P>
It will also take steps to fuel exports of Taiwan fruit to
foreign markets in 2007, setting a 20 percent export growth
target for the coming three years through 2009, he said.
</P>
<P>
The COA's new promotional action guidelines will focus on
stepping up sales of locally produced fruit in the domestic
market, increasing sales around the world, strengthening quality
control by local farmers, establishing a reliable export network
and building a high-end image for Taiwan produced agricultural
and farm goods, he said.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan's agricultural  production value hit around NT$380.3
billion (US$11.52 billion) last year, up by 8 percent over the
previous level prior to the country entering the World Trade
Organization (WTO) in 2002, the COA head reported.
</P>
<P>
He attributed the local sector's growth to efforts by the
government and farmers, which exploded the myth that the local
agricultural sector would crumble after WTO entry.
</P>
<P>
From June this year, the COA is slated to kick off a profile
system for locally grown agricultural and farm produce at chain
stores and hypermarkets, Su said, adding that the council hopes
to impose the measure on such establishments nationwide by the
end of next year to provide the public with secure and safe
products.
</P>
<P>
A total of 125 fishery, agricultural and farm products are slated
to be listed on the COA's TGAP (traceable good agricultural
practice) program by the end of this year in the initial stage,
he said.
</P>
<P>
Both local and foreign organic agricultural and farm products are
expected to be included in the system within two years to
guarantee food safety for the public, he said.
