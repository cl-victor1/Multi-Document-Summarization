The total value of Hsinchu Science-based Industrial Park (HSIP)
exports in January amounted to NT$44.83 billion (US$1.36 billion)
, up 3.1 percent from the year-earlier level, park administration
officials said Sunday.

However, the figure represented a decline of 16.4 percent in
comparison with the previous month's figure, according to the
officials.

The output value of the semiconductor industry took the lion's
share of the park's total exports in January, accounting for 51.7
percent of the total with NT$23.18 billion,  followed by the
electro-optical sector's 33.3 percent or NT$14.94 billion.

Among the park's six major industries, the electro-optical
sector's annual export growth rate topped the list at 77.8
percent, with the flat panel display sub-industry's monthly
export value hitting NT$13.74 billion, which accounted for 92
percent of the sector's total monthly output and represents an
annual growth rate of 90.8 percent.

As for the semi-conductor industry, the chip manufacturing sub-
industry saw a 18.11 percent rise year-on-year to NT$16.55
billion during the same period, while the export value of IC
packaging plunged to NT$3.77 billion, down 62.68 percent year-on-

semi-conductor industry.
