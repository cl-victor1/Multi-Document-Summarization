<P>
Natural, additive-free instant coffee is now available in
Taiwan's convenience stores at a low price, thanks to the
perseverance of a Taipei businessman who believes that good
coffee should be affordable.
</P>
<P>
Wu Chien-wen, a vegetarian who hardly ever drank coffee before
2000 when he was moved by a cup of freshly made, aromatic coffee
offered by a college alumnus at the latter's coffee shop.
Whereupon he was instantly won over and decided to cash in on
business of ready-to-drink coffee.
</P>
<P>
Part of a new breed of people who embrace LOHAS (lifestyles of
health and sustainability) , the forty-something Wu wanted to
sell natural,  aromatic instant  coffee containing  no
emulsifiers, thickening agents or any other additives, and at a
price much cheaper than Starbucks -- NT$30 for a cup of instant
arabica coffee.
</P>
<P>
Wu's Formosa Coffee is now the top seller at two upscale
supermarkets in Taipei -- winning the hearts and souls of the
consumers with its quality and price.
</P>
<P>
By joining hands with the Family convenience store chain, Wu has
put his Formosa Coffee on the shelves of over 2,000 Family stores
islandwide since the beginning of this year, and other
convenience stores -- excepting 7-Eleven -- are expected to begin
offering his coffee shortly.
</P>
<P>
Wu's reputation and business acumen extend beyond the Taiwan
market. In April 2005, he presented an Italian-style coffee maker
-- which can make a typical 100 percent-crema Espresso in minutes
-- at a Specialty Coffee Association of America (SCAA) exhibition
held in Seattle, Washington and attracted the attention of Erna
Knutsen, the matriarch of specialty or gourmet coffee in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
Knutsen was so impressed that she agreed to let Wu use her name
on his machines to make inroads into international markets.
</P>
<P>
Further confirming his international reputation, Wu was invited
to be ajudge at aglobal Cup of Excellence (CoE) competition of
baked beans held in Honduras in May 2006.
