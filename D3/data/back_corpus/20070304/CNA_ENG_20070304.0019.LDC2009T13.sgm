Minister of Education Tu Cheng-sheng Sunday advised parents of
students not to rush to buy apartments near so-calledstar senior
high schoolsbecause the school districts in the newly unveiled
12-year compulsory educational system will be made large enough
to allow students greater choice.
</P>
<P>
Tu said that the termstar schoolsis a product of social
convention without official definition. However,  he said, the
government is realistic enough to recognize the historic and
social fact that certain schools are generally acknowledged  as
more competitive and are favored by parents and students.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, he said, issues such as defining the boundaries of
school districts and cross-district entrance to these popular
high schools will be discussed and carefully studied before any
decision is made.
</P>
<P>
He said the ministry will invite experts as well as the public to
offer their views over a period of up to one year, adding that
students and parents should not be anxious about the location of
their homes.
</P>
<P>
The ministry announced Tuesday the decision to prolong the
compulsory educational system from nine years to 12 beginning in
2009.
