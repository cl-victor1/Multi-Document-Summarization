Taipei,  May 25 (CNA) (By Deborah Kuo)

An official from the Center for Disease Control (CDC) under the
Department of Health said Wednesday that a Taiwan citizen who
maintained business operations in China is believed to have died of
viral pneumonia recently and added that a media report claiming that
the man died of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is highly
speculative.
</P>
<P>
CDC Deputy Director-General Chou Chih-hao said that currently there
have been no confirmed SARS cases reported worldwide and that it
remains to be determined whether the deceased man had contracted SARS.
</P>
<P>
Chou also confirmed that the businessman's adult son reportedly
contracted a fever after coming into contact with his father after the
latter returned from China and soon afterward died.
</P>
<P>
According to the media rumor, the Taiwan businessman returned to
Taiwan recently with fever for treatment but "died of SARS" soon
afterward. His son also developed fever and was admitted to a
hospital, while the son's girlfriend, an airline attendant, has been
suspended from work.
</P>
<P>
Discounting the report, Chou said that the CDC is investigating the
source of the SARS allegation and stressed that the rumormonger will
be apprehended and dealt with in accordance with the law.
