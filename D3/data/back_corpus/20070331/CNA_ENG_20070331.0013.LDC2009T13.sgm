The head of the Chinese Taipei Paralympic Committee (CTPC)
attended a ceremony held by the United Nations Friday at its
headquarters to mark the signing of the International Convention
on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.
</P>
<P>
CTPC Chairwoman Chen Li Chou, also a professor at Taiwan's
National Normal University, told CNA it was the first time the
committee has attended a U.N. event as an observer, thanks to the
International Paralympic Committee, which helped promote the
CTPC's participation.

<P>
Chen said the attendance was significant but expressed regret
that the CTPC was excluded from the signing of the convention,
regarded as the biggest human rights treaty of the 21st Century.
Chen attended the event with CTPC consultant Yang Li-chu.

<P>
According to a U.N. press release, more than 80 countries signed
the treaty, while other 40 signed the optional protocol of the
convention, which will enter into force automatically so long as
there are 20 national ratifications from the signatories.
</P>
<P>
There are approximately 650 million mentally and physically
challenged people around the world, more than 900,000 of whom
live in Taiwan, according to Ministry of the Interior statistics.
</P>
<P>
Chen noted that Taiwan will host the second World Wheelchair and
Amputee Games Sept. 9-19 in Taipei, with the opening ceremony
slated for Sept. 11. So far, 40 countries including China have
registered to attend the games, she said.
