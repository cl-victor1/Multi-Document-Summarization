From April 1, residents on the outlying Penghu Islands will be
able to sail to China using the existing "mini three links" route
via the Kinmen and Matsu islands, Mainland Affairs Council (MAC)
Chairman Joseph Wu announced Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The measure will allow Penghu residents to travel to China using
the direct ferry services maintained between the two Taiwan-held
islands and Xiamen and Mawei ports in China's Fujian Province
that lie on the opposite side of the Taiwan Strait, Wu said.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Chinese tourists can also travel to Penghu via
Kinmen and Matsu islands on a case-by-case basis, although
proceeding to Taiwan proper will remain prohibited.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan initiated direct shipping services connecting Kinmen and
Matsu to Fujian's Xiamen and Mawei ports in January 2001 to help
facilitate travel between the two sides of the strait. Direct
shipping and air links between Taiwan proper and China are not
permitted due to decades-old political feuding between the two
nations.
