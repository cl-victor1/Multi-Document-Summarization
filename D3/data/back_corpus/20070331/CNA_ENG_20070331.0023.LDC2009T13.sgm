KMT RALLIES AGAINST DPP'S NAME-CHANGE DRIVE

Taipei,  March  31 (CNA) 03/31/07  20:56:30 (By Flor Wang)
</P>
<P>
The main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) organized a march in Taipei
near the Presidential Office Saturday in protest against the
ruling party's recent series of moves to cleanse Taiwan of the
influence of the late President Chiang Kai- shek and of its links
to China.
</P>
<P>
A large crowd of supporters marched from Ketagalan Boulevard in
front of the Presidential Office to the Chiang Kai-shek (CKS)
Memorial Hall to voice their desire to "Love Taiwan and Protect
the Republic of China."
</P>
<P>
KMT heavyweights including former Chairman Ma Ying-jeou, acting
Chairman P.K. Chiang, Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng and
scores of KMT lawmakers showed their support by taking part in
the demonstration.
</P>
<P>
If it were not because of Chiang, Taiwan would not have
recuperated from Japanese rule that ended in 1945, Ma claimed,
adding that the late president also succeeded in leading Taiwan
against bombardment from China.
</P>
<P>
Although Chiang should be held responsible for the 228 Incident
of 1947, in which thousands of Taiwanese elite were massacred by
KMT troops and for his authoritarian rule over Taiwan, Ma claimed
that his contributions outweighed his wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
The DPP is seeking to shift public attention away from its
incompetence in administering Taiwan by casting up Chiang's
deeds, Ma said.
</P>
<P>
For his part, Wang praised Chiang's contribution to Taiwan's
economic development, claiming that it was Chiang who laid a
solid foundation for the country's economic progress.
</P>
<P>
Wang said it is important to safeguard the existence of the
Republic of China and called for widespread public support for
the KMT in December's  legislative election  and the March  2008
presidential race.
</P>
<P>
The CKS Memorial Hall has recently become a focal point in
society due to a plan of the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)
to tear down its walls and convert it into a "Taiwan democracy
monument" amid the ruling party's name change efforts for state-
run companies and establishments that carry the words "China, "
"Chinese" or Chiang's name.
</P>
<P>
DPP legislative caucus whip Wang To earlier the same day accused
the KMT of deceiving  the Taiwan  people  by organizing  the
demonstration to disguise its intentions for partisan gain.
</P>
<P>
Wang called the KMT protest ridiculous and claimed that only in
an authoritarian country can people see so many statues of a
dictator.
