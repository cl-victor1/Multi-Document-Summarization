Taipei,  March 31 (CNA) 03/31/07  20:31:35 (By Lilian Wu)

The National Communications Commission (NCC) carefully weighed
all factors to reach its decision to impose a fine of NT$2
million (US$60,600) on a local cable TV company for airing a
controversial staged video, NCC Chairman Su Yeong-chin said
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Su made the remarks amid widespread outrage that the NCC was too
lenient. Premier Su Tseng-chang also blasted the NCC, saying its
decision fell far short of public expectations.
</P>
<P>
The NCC decided Friday to fine the company's two cable channels
-- TVBS and TVBS-N -- NT$1 million each for broadcasting the
controversial five-minute tape produced by a TVBS journalist in
which a gun-toting gangster made a death threat against his
former mob boss.
</P>
<P>
The NCC also demanded that the TV company replace its president
within seven days of receiving the NCC ruling and that its top
two executives should no longer be allowed to host programs.
</P>
<P>
According to Su Yeong-chin, demands that the NCC shut down the
company or suspend its broadcasting rights are overstepping legal
bounds.
</P>
<P>
He said the number of cable television channels is greater and
that their impact is not as great as terrestrial or cable radio,
so that punishment for transgressions should be less.
</P>
<P>
But the airing of the video shows mismanagement of the company,
which has affected public trust in the media, Su went on, adding
that the NCC dealt with the matter in accordance with the
regulations of the Satellite and Broadcasting Law, which obliges
the NCC to demand that the company "improve the situation by a
certain date" and "adopt other necessary measures."
</P>
<P>
Su said that the NCC has asked the company to rigorously exercise
internal management.
