<P>
The Hsinchu Science Park reported Saturday that exports from the
park totaled NT$38.8 billion in February, down 13.4 percent from
the previous month due to reduced working days because of the
nine-day Chinese New Year holiday.
</P>
<P>
This came on the heels of reduced exports of NT$44.83 billion in
January, down 16.44 percent from the previous month, because
January is traditionally a cooler time for the park's
manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
The semiconductor sector is the largest sector in the park and
some semiconductor manufacturers continued operating during the
holiday to fulfill orders. Exports of the sector therefore
climbed to NT$23.87 billion, higher that the US$23.18 billion in
January.
</P>
<P>
Other sectors, including optoelectronics, computer peripherals,
communications, precision machinery and biotech, recorded
declines in exports. Among them, exports of the optoelectronic
sector totaled NT$8.42 billion in February, down 43.65 percent
from the previous month, representing the biggest decline among
all sectors.
</P>
<P>
Exports of the park as a whole in the first two months totaled
NT$83.63 billion, down 1.07 percent from the same period of last
year.
</P>
<P>
Exports of the optoelectronic sector in the first two months
totaled NT$23.36 billion, or 40 percent up year-on-year. The flat
panel display was the prime mover, recording exports of NT$21.09
billion, or an increase of 48 percent year- on-year.
</P>
<P>
Exports of the semiconductor sector in the first two months
totaled NT$47.06 billion, down 10.55 percent from the same period
of last year.
