MOJ TO REOPEN PROSECUTOR REVIEW COMMITTEE
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  March 31 (CNA) 03/31/07  18:12:20 (By Elizabeth Hsu)
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Justice (MOJ) has decided to reopen the
Prosecutor's Personnel Review Committee (PPRC) after several
newly designated chief prosecutors in district prosecutors
offices refused to take their new positions.
</P>
<P>
Vice Minister of Justice Lee Chien-yung made the announcement at
a press conference at the ministry Saturday, explaining that the
MOJ needs to further discuss with the PPRC a controversial
planned reshuffle of dozens of chief prosecutors in district and
high prosecutors offices.
</P>
<P>
A consensus on the reshuffle is required, since PPRC members have
different opinions about whether or not there was the required
consultancy procedure before the personnel adjustment, Lee said.
</P>
<P>
Asked whether the MOJ will reconsider the name list for the
reshuffle, Lee said the ministry wants to collect a wide spectrum
of opinions before making a final decision.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, the MOJ passed a list of new chief prosecutors in
district offices, as well as a move to transfer Hsieh Wen-ting,
chief prosecutor of the Taiwan High Prosecutors Office, to the
position of prosecutor general of the Supreme Prosecutors Office,
in a PPRC meeting that was attended by just six of the 17
committee members, as most members refused to attend on the
grounds that the proposed reshuffle was the result of political
interference.
</P>
<P>
The passage of the list drew criticism from the Prosecutors'
Reform Association (PRA) , which claimed in a statement that the
reshuffle has severely harmed the independence of the prosecution
system and called for the outgoing and designated chief
prosecutors to refuse to change over before a legal procedure for
the personnel adjustment has been completed.
</P>
<P>
The PRA also launched a petition among prosecutors around the
nation who support its call. PRA convener Chen Chih-min said
Saturday that they had received numerous signatures from district
prosecutor offices in Tainan, Hsinchu and Penghu, as well as from
the Shihlin District Prosecutor Office in Taipei.
</P>
<P>
In its statement,  the PRA expressed strong opposition to
political influence in any personnel adjustment of the
prosecution system and blasted the MOJ's decision to replace
well-performing chief prosecutors without valid reason.
</P>
<P>
The PRA said the MOJ's reshuffle decision was made in violation
of Article 59 of the Organic Law of the Court, which requires a
legal quorum for any decision made at a meeting to become
effective.
</P>
<P>
Opposition  legislators  claim the reshuffle is politically
motivated because the Democratic Progressive Party government,
dogged by an embezzlement case involving the first lady's alleged
misuse of the president's special state affairs fund, is
attempting to line up chief prosecutors whose legal opinions are
colored in Wu's favor.
