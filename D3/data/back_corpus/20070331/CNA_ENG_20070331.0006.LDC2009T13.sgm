FORMER TRANSPORT MINISTER INDICTED FOR TAKING BRIBE
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  March 30 (CNA) 03/31/07  12:57:42 (By Y.C. Jou)
</P>
<P>
The Taipei District Court Prosecutor's Office indicted  Friday
former Minister of Transportation  and Communications Kuo Yao-chi
for allegedly taking a US$20,000 bribe in 2006 and recommended
that she be sentenced to eight years in jail.
</P>
<P>
According to the indictment, the prosecutors gathered evidence on
Kuo primarily from telephone wiretapping, saying she received the
cash in a tea gift box last July from leisure industry
conglomerate Nan Ren Hu Group Chairman Lee Ching-po and his son,
who asked her to help the company win a Taipei Railway Station
renovation project tender.
</P>
<P>
In an August ministry meeting, Kuo "implicitly directed" her
subordinates to alter the content of the project to favor Nan Ren
Hu, the indictment continues. However, it said, the company later
gave up its bid for unrelated reasons.
</P>
<P>
The prosecutors said Kuo's actions in return for the bribe did
not constitute a "breach of official duties, " although the fact
that she accepted the money constitutes a corruption offense.
</P>
<P>
The prosecutors dropped their case against the Lees due to lack
of evidence that they intended to pay Kuo to act in breach of her
official duties.
</P>
<P>
Kuo has denied the charges.
