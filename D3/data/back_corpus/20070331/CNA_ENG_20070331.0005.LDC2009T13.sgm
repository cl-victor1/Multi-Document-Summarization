MORE CENTRAL GOVERNMENT FUNDING FOR TAINAN RAIL PROJECT: MAYOR
</HEADLINE>

Tainan,  March 30 (CNA) 03/31/07  12:57:32 (By Han Nai-kuo)

<P>
Tainan Mayor Hsu Tien-tsai urged the central government Friday to
increase its funding to the Tainan city government for a project
to put the railway going through the city underground.
</P>
<P>
Hsu told a press conference that the central government has said
it will provide cash for the city's NT$29.7 billion project
provided the Tainan city government can put up NT$7.7 billion.
</P>
<P>
Hsu refused to accept the central government proposal, describing
the fund required of the city government as being too high.
</P>
<P>
He said he hopes the central government will either appropriate
the full amount for the project or else allow the city government
to repay the central government NT$2.5 billion over 15 years, or
NT$4 billion over 25 years.
</P>
<P>
The Tainan mayor threatened to withhold his support for any
presidential candidate who does not support the project.
</P>
<P>
He said the project is necessary because the city has many
important historical relics and that if the railway is elevated
it will ruin the city skyline.
