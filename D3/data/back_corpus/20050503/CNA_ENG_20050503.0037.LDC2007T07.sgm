FOREIGN MINISTRY DENIES TAIWAN  TO USE 'CDC, TAIWAN' IN WHO BID
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Taipei, May 3 (CNA) (By Y.F. Low)
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) denied on Tuesday that the
government has proposed using the name "CDC (Center for Disease
Control) , Taiwan" to participate in the World Health Assembly (WHA).
</P>
<P>
However, the CDC can serve as Taiwan's liaison with the World Health
Organization (WHO) if Taiwan is included in the International Health
Regulations, according to a statement released by the ministry.
</P>
<P>
The ministry made the clarification in response to a media report that
the government is making a bid to take part as an observer in the next
WHA scheduled for May 16-25 in the name of a "health entity, " "health
territory" or "CDC, Taiwan" in an attempt to play down the political
implication of the bid.
</P>
<P>
The WHA is the WHO's decision-making arm.
</P>
<P>
Speaking of the issue, Chang Wu-hsiu, head of the Department of
Health's (DOH) international cooperation section, said that the name
"CDC, Taiwan" is impractical although it involves less political
controversy.
</P>
<P>
According to Chang, in addition to disease control, the operations of
the WHO also include a wide range of health affairs such as cancer
prevention, drug control and women's health, and the CDC is
insufficient to represent the overall health interests of Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Compared with "CDC, Taiwan, " a "health entity" is a better name,
Chang said.
</P>
<P>
He urged China to make an open announcement in support of Taiwan's bid
to join the WHO immediately if it is sincere about its offer to help
Taiwan achieve this goal.
