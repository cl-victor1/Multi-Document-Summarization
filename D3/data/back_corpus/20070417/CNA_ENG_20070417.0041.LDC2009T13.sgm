The first-quarter operations of the Offshore Shipping Center
(OSC)  in Kaohsiung Harbor decreased year-on-year, an official of
the Ministry of Transportation and Communications (MOTC) said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The OSC's total operations reached its peak of 674,000 TEUs in
2004, decreased to 661,000 TEUs in 2005 and to 616,000 TEUs in
2006. The 151,000 TEUs from January-March 2007 represented a 5.29
percent drop from the same period of last year and future growth
is not likely, the official said.
</P>
<P>
The official said the OSC, established in 1997, allows carriers
to handle direct shipping between Taiwan's Kaohsiung and China's
Xiamen and Fuzhou ports, but only with cargo heading for third
destinations.
</P>
<P>
With other ports in China gradually improving facilities for big
vessels, allowing them to ship directly to America and Europe,
the importance of OSC has been reduced and its operations
affected, according to the official.
</P>
<P>
Although the OSC operations decreased, the loading and unloading
operations at Kaohsiung Port reached 2.45 million TEUs in the
first quarter, moving up 6.99 percent year-on-year, the official
said, adding that the growth rate of its transit cargo operations
moved up 10.24 percent over the previous year's first quarter.
