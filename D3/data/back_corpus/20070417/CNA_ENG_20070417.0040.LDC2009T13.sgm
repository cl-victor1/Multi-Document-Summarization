Vice President Annette Lu said Tuesday that she is prepared to be
Taiwan's next president and the nation's first female head of
state.
</P>
<P>
Addressing participants at a symposium held by National Kaohsiung
University of Applied Sciences and the Geneva Centre for the
Democratic Control of Armed Forces, Lu urged the public to help
her fulfill her dream of getting elected in 2008.
</P>
<P>
She dismissed her opponents as "not having the nation's future in
mind" and claimed to be the only candidate who has a clear
overall perspective about Taiwan's sovereignty and its future
course.
</P>
<P>
She criticized her three party primary rivals from the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) -- Premier Su Tseng-chang, DPP
Chairman Yu Shyi-kun and former Premier Frank Hsieh -- for their
"fierce bickering" over the question of who leads in opinion
polls in terms of approval ratings.
</P>
<P>
She also blasted Ma Ying-jeou, a presidential hopeful from the
opposition Kuomintang, claiming that he is busy with nothing else
but defending himself in an embezzlement case.
</P>
<P>
The vice president said she has been advocating gender equality
for 35 years and is glad to see that Taiwan now ranks first in
Asia and 19th in the world in this respect.
</P>
<P>
She added that if the nation could write a new chapter in its
history by electing a woman to serve as president in 2008, it
would greatly enhance Taiwan's visibility in the world.
