Vice President Annette Lu said Monday that it would be an
achievement and sign of progress for all Taiwanese women if
Taiwan's next president were a woman.
</P>
<P>
Lu made the remarks at the Presidential Office when she received
members of a leadership program for outstanding Taiwanese female
entrepreneurs living overseas.
</P>
<P>
A female presidency in Taiwan would eradicate unfair treatment
women face in society, Lu said, adding that Taiwan's "time of
women" has come, as many high- profile organizations have
chairwomen instead of chairmen, including the Taipei 101, Taiwan
High Speed Rail, and the Grand Hotel.
</P>
<P>
Lu noted that Taiwanese women's rights and interests ranked the
19th among 193 countries, and first among Asian countries, in an
evaluative  report  issued by the United Nations  Educational,
Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO).
</P>
<P>
Lu said the report shows that Taiwanese women's efforts in
economic development have won recognition in the world, and that
Taiwan is ready to have a female president after 11 male
presidential tenures.
