Emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2) in the transportation sector
fell by 160,000 tons in 2006 in Taiwan compared with the previous
year, according to the Ministry of Transportation and
Communications (MOTC) , which Tuesday attributed the result to a
series of transportation related energy-saving measures.
</P>
<P>
In keeping with the Kyoto Protocol, an agreement arrived at under
the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change as part
of the world's efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions that
came into force Feb. 16, 2005, the MOTC began an energy-saving
drive targeting vehicles.
</P>
<P>
As a result of the drive, 39 action plans were brought forward in
2005 to address three goals -- developing "green" transportation
systems, slowing the rise in the number and use of motor
vehicles, and improving the efficiency of transportation systems,
the MOTC said.
</P>
<P>
For example, to encourage public transportation service operators
to introduce low-pollution automobiles, the MOTC provided
businesses using environmental- friendly motor vehicles with
extra points in their applications for the right to offer
commercial transportation services on certain roads, such as the
Taipei- Yilan Expressway.
</P>
<P>
The MOTC Institute of Transportation has also worked to establish
a Web site on which to publicize  ideas touching  on "green
transportation" in the hope that more and more people will choose
to travel via mass transportation systems, bicycle, or on foot.
