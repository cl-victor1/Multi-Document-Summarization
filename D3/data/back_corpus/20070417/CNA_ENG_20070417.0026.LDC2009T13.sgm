Taipei,  April 17 (CNA) 04/17/07  19:41:27 (By Elisa Kao)

<P>
Taiwanese trade officials warned Tuesday that the country should
accelerate the upgrading of its industries amid fierce
competition in the world community.
</P>
<P>
Officials of the Council for Economic Planning and Development
(CEPD) made the appeal after the latest trade report released by
World Trade Organization (WTO) showed that Taiwan was the 17th
largest trading country in 2006, down a notch from its 2005
rating, and the worst rating in memory.
</P>
<P>
According to the WTO statistics, Taiwan's trade value totalled
US$427 billion last year, accounting for 1.7 percent of the
world's total trade, representing a drop of 0.1 percentage point
from its share in 2005.
</P>
<P>
The United States continued to be the world's largest trading
country in 2006, followed by Germany, China, Japan, United
Kingdom, and France, in that order, according to WTO statistics.
</P>
<P>
However, CEPD officials revealed that the value of China's
exports in the second half of 2006 exceeded for the first time
that of U.S., coming second only to that of Germany.
</P>
<P>
Officials attributed the drop of Taiwan's trade rating to the
rise of many developing countries with great potential and the
positive trade performances of advanced countries.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Taiwan's trade volume lagged behind that of the
other three Asian tigers -- Singapore, South Korea, and Hong
Kong, the officials went on.
</P>
<P>
Noting that this should be taken as a serious warning and must
not be ignored, the officials urged the government to effectively
implement those policies already presented which aim at elevating
the competitiveness of the island's industries.
