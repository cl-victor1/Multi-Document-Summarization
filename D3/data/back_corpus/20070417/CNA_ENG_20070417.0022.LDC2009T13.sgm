Taipei,  April  17 (CNA) 04/17/07  18:29:19 (By Lilian Wu)

Desmond Mpilo Tutu, former Anglican Archbishop of South Africa
and Nobel Peace Prize laureate, will arrive in Taiwan Wednesday
for a weeklong visit, Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesman Wang
Chien-yeh said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Wang said the itinerary of Tutu will be arranged by the Taiwan
Foundation for Democracy (TFD), which invited him for the visit.
The TFD is a non-profit organization dedicated to the promotion
of democracy and human rights in Taiwan and abroad.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, Tutu will meet with the family members of victims of
the 228 Incident and pay a visit to Lin Yi-hsiung, former
chairman of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party.
</P>
<P>
The 228 Incident refers to an uprising against the corrupt KMT
administration under the late President Chiang Kai-shek that
began Feb. 28, 1947 and was followed by a bloody crackdown
resulting in the deaths of tens of thousands of civilians.
</P>
<P>
Lin's mother and twin daughters were murdered on Feb. 28, 1980
when he was in jail for his involvement in the Kaohsiung Incident
in December 1979, a pro- democracy rally that turned violent. The
murder remains unsolved till today.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, Tutu will meet with Vice President Annette Lu and
later ride the high speed rail line to Kaohsiung to visit
churches in southern Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
On April 24, Tutu will deliver a speech on transitional justice
and ethnic reconciliation and share the experience of South
Africa in this regard.
</P>
<P>
He will also meet with President Chen Shui-bian April 24 before
leaving Taiwan the following day.
</P>
<P>
Tutu, 75, is a South African cleric and activist who rose to
worldwide fame during the 1980s as an opponent of apartheid. Tutu
served as the chairman of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission
(TRC) to move the nation along the path of reconciliation, one
year after apartheid was done away with in 1994.
</P>
<P>
The TRC was a crucial component of the transition to full and
free democracy in South Africa and, despite some flaws, is
generally - though not universally - regarded as successful.
