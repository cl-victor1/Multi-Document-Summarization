The Taichung city government warned real estate agents Tuesday
not to place property ads wherever they like in the city, or they
could face a double fine.
</P>
<P>
City government officials told reporters they have noticed a
significant increase in "randomly placed" property ads in
Taichung recently as a result of the booming real estate market.
</P>
<P>
They said such ads not only are against the law but also make the
city look ugly.
</P>
<P>
As a countermeasure, they added, the Environmental Protection
Bureau and the Land Administration Bureau under the city
government will work together to crack down on illegal property
ads.
</P>
<P>
The officials warned that offenders will first be fined up to
NT$6,000 for violation of the Waste Disposal Act and then
referred to land administration officials who will determine
whether the offenders failed to include their company names in
the property ads and thus should be subjected to another fine.
</P>
<P>
According to the Real Estate Broking Management  Act,  an
unauthorized broker engaged in property sales is liable to a fine
of between NT$100,00 and NT$300,000, while a real estate broker
failing to provide its name in a property ad will face a fine of
between NT$6,000 and NT$300,000.
