attacking and destroying positions of the outlawed Kurdish Workers'
Party (PKK) with jet fighters, according to military officials on
Thursday.

High-ranking Turkish military officials in Ankara said that government
forces have killed more than 500 PKK rebels since some 15,000 troops,
backed by armored units and air power, crossed into northern Iraq
three weeks ago.

the border. More than 26,000 people have been killed in the past 13
years of conflict between Turkish government forces and the PKK.
