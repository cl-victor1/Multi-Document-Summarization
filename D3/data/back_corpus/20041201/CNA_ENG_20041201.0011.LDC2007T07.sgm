Taiwan is joining four other Asian economies in establishing a system,
to be dubbed "Green Lane," which helps speed up imports of electrical
and electronic products by providing quick issuance of certification
documents, a Singaporean daily reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Members of the Asia Network Forum (ANF) -- which groups major testing
and certification bodies from Japan, Singapore, Taiwan, South Korea
and mainland China -- decided Tuesday during an ANF general meeting
that the "Green Lane" project will be materialized in the near future
to further facilitate imports among the ANF member countries.

<P>
The Lianhe Zaobao daily reported that once the "Green Lane" project is
established and takes effect, imports of electrical and electronics
products, such as DVD players, will take only 10 days to move from the
factory into the country of destination, instead of the current 45
days.

The ANF member countries have agreed to exchange among themselves
issuance and recognition of product certification. The certificates
that are issued by ANF member countries will save time in the border-
crossing process, said Henry Heng, CEO of Singapore's PSB Group, which
is one of the five organizations of the ANF.

Taking Singapore as an example, Heng said, Singapore exported some S$6
billion worth of electrical and electronics products to the other four
ANF member countries over the past two years via a fast channel, which
features mainly product and export certificates that were issued by
the ANF and recognized by other ANF member countries.
</P>
<P>
The ANF was established five years ago in Singapore to provide speedy
product safety testing and inspection services using advanced
technology for a range of products, including chemical and materials,
electrical and electronics, as well as mechanical and building.
