The health drink market showed a surprising slump in sales of
nearly 9 percent in 2006, failing for the first time to realize
the same steady growth as in previous years, a representative of
the industry said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The health drink market used to be a battlefield for businessmen
due to the lifting  of restrictions  and rapid  changes  in
biotechnology. New drinks appeared on the market one after
another, but while businessmen have continued to introduce new
products, sales performance declined in 2006.
</P>
<P>
The industry representative suggested that the market ceased to
grow because new products on the market did not perform as well
as in the past while many established brands dropped out
entirely.

<P>
Taiwan's health drink market grew steadily from NT$25 billion in
2003 to over NT$35 billion (US$ 1.06 billion) in 2005.
