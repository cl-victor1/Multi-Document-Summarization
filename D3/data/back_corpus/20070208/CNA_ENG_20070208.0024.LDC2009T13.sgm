Taipei,  Feb.  8 (CNA) 02/08/07  18:54:15 (By Deborah Kuo)

Officials representing Taiwan and the Philippines signed a
memorandum of understanding Thursday aimed at bolstering
bilateral exchanges and cooperation on indigenous peoples'
affairs.
</P>
<P>
Antonio Basilio, resident representative and managing director of
the Manila Economic and Cultural Office in Taiwan, joined Wu
Hsin-hsing, representative of the Taipei Economic and Cultural
Office in the Philippines, at a ceremony held to ink the MOU,
which calls for closer cultural and economic exchanges and
cooperation of indigenous people between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Walis Pelin, chairman of the Council of Indigenous Peoples, and
his Philippine counterpart,  Jannette Cansing Serrano-Reisland,
witnessed the MOU signing at the ceremony, which was followed by
performances of indigenous songs and dances, all flavored with
champagne.

<P>
Speaking at the ceremony, Walis Pelin told a beautiful story
about interactions between indigenous peoples from Taiwan and the
Philippines. Filipinos are believed to be descendants of the
various Austronesian-speaking migrants who arrived in successive
waves over some thousand years ago from Taiwan, and are
genetically most closely related to the Tao (formerly known as
Yami) people now living on Green Island located off Taiwan's
southeast coast, he said.
</P>
<P>
Twenty years ago, he said, a young Tao man ferried to Batan, in
the Philippines' northernmost island group to marry to a Batan
girl, thereby reliving the close relations  that the two
countries' ancestors had maintained a thousand years ago.
</P>
<P>
Walis Pelin also disclosed that the Council of Indigenous Peoples
had been planning to sponsor some 20 Taiwan indigenous people to
ferry to Batan in the near future to again follow the path that
Taiwanese ancestors followed when they ferried to the Philippines
a millennium or more ago.
</P>
<P>
Thursday's MOU marked the fourth of its kind that Taiwan has
signed with foreign countries. Taiwan has signed similar pacts
with indigenous groups from Canada, New Zealand and Belize.
