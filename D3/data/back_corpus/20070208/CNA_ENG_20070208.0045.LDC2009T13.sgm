KMT CHAIRMAN WILL TENDER RESIGNATION IF INDICTED: PARTY OFFICIAL
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

Taipei,  Feb.  8 (CNA) 02/08/07  22:30:33 (By Flor Wang)
</P>
<P>
Opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Ma Ying-jeou will definitely
tender his resignation to the party's Central Standing Committee
if indicted on embezzlement charges related to his alleged misuse
of special municipal funds during his tenure as Taipei mayor, KMT
Secretary-General Wu Den-yih said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a Legislative Yuan news conference, Wu said Ma will
offer to resign if he is indicted. "The party's Central Standing
Committee will respond to such a drastic development in line with
its existing mechanisms, " he said, adding that "the party is not
considering a bailout plan for such a scenario."
</P>
<P>
Wu's comments came after the People First Party (PFP), an ally of
the KMT in the opposition "pan-blue alliance, " proposed earlier
in the day that the two parties should jointly nominate a
presidential candidate for the 2008 election based upon their new
but closer KMT-PFP alliance.
</P>
<P>
Wu thanked the PFP for its concern and suggestion but insisted
that the KMT has not worked out any package to deal with the
situation in the event of Ma's indictment. The former mayor is
widely viewed as the most eligible "pan-blue" candidate in the
2008 president poll.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, it was reported that the prosecution had concluded its
probe into the case of Ma's alleged embezzlement and is set to
indict the former Taipei mayor in the coming days. The KMT has
reportedly been planning to revise its clauses to secure Ma's
right to participate in the next presidential race or allow him
to run as an independent even if he is indicted.
</P>
<P>
According to PFP lawmaker Liu Wen-hsiung, the two proposals are
bad ideas that would doom Ma's chances in the race, as both
alternatives will significantly taint Ma's moral reputation as
"Mr. Clean."
</P>
<P>
Liu said the best chance of victory in the 2008 presidential
election is for the two "pan-blue" parties to jointly field a
candidate who stands the best chance of success. By so doing, Liu
said, Ma would not necessarily be nominated, as other hopefuls
could also join the race for nomination. But given Ma's
popularity with grassroots pan-blue supporters, Liu said, Ma
stands a good chance of winning the primary through this process
while avoiding damaging unity within the "pan-blue" alliance.
</P>
<P>
"As long as Ma enjoys widespread grassroots support, the best way
to bail out Ma is through the joint nomination mechanism of the
new KMT-PFP alliance, " Liu argued, adding that he believes PFP
Chairman James Soong will also fully back Ma in the 2008
presidential race if Ma is truely nominated by the alliance.
</P>
<P>
He urged the KMT to quickly come out with countermeasures to
settle the issue as Ma enjoys very strong support among "pan-
blue" voters.
