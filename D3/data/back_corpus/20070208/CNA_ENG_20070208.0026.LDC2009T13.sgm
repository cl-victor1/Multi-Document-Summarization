An English test touted to be the first developed in compliance
with regulations laid down by the Ministry of Education and the
Common European Framework was unveiled here by a private
educational institution, the National Development Institute (NDI)
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
In a news conference called to promote the examination system,
Huang Chun-teng, an associate professor in the Department of
English, National Changhua University of Education, and head of a
panel of scholars responsible for the development of the test,
said the Global English Test (GET) is learner-centered and
action-oriented, and is thus designed to measure the exam-taker's
ability to communicate.
</P>
<P>
Noting  that many English  tests available  on the market
concentrate on gramar, Huang said GET stresses the students'
ability to use English in daily life.
</P>
<P>
In the course of its development, Huang said, more than 16,000
students from 50 junior and senior high schools and universities
took the exam between September and December last year to help
its developers to finetune the system.
</P>
<P>
Citing the examination results of GET A2 level, which is the
equivalent to the English level of junior high school sophomores,
Huang said freshmen from gifted classes at junior high schools
perform better not only than their counterparts in regular
classes, but also better than students from universities.
</P>
<P>
Although the results may not reflect the whole picture of the
country, Huang said, it suggests that the English language has
been taught as a study subject rather than an applied skill, and
as a result many local university graduates cannot communicate in
English while studying abroad.
</P>
<P>
Stressing the importance of motivation in learning a foreign
language, Huang said young students -- except for those who are
applying to schools overseas -- are not encouraged to take the
examination because there is no point for them to invest their
time in it.
</P>
<P>
The test, which ranks learners from beginner to superior, in six
grades from A1 to C2, consists of a listening and reading
section, and speaking and writing section. The test for each
section carries a fee of NT$550 (US$15.12).
