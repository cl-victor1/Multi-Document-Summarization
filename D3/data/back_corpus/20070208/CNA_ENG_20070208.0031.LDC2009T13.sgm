NAME CHANGE ON SHIPYARD GOLIATH CRANE PAINSTAKING: CSBC
</HEADLINE>

Kaohsiung,  Feb. 8 (CNA) 02/08/07  20:07:00 (By Deborah Kuo)

It would be a "painstaking task" for the China Shipbuilding Corp.
(CSBC) to erase the company's Chinese name and repaint a new one
on the huge Goliath crane at the CSBC shipyard, which is the
largest of its kind in Southeast Asia, a CSBC official claimed
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
In addition to having to use a "super-high" crane with a man-
carrying cage for the name-change job, it would cost at least
NT$10 million to have the CSBC's new Chinese name painted on the
Goliath bridge crane, CSBC Vice President Wang Ko- hsun claimed.

<P>
Despite his complaints, Wang said the name-change idea -- from
CSBC to "Taiwan International Shipbuilding Corp." in Chinese --
is generally supported by company management  since it is a set
government policy and will help avoid confusing the state-run
company with a Chinese one.
</P>
<P>
There will be little change in the company's new English name --
from CSBC to CSBC Taiwan -- out of consideration for the
company's convenience in operations in international shipbuilding
markets, Wang noted.
</P>
<P>
Wang said the name-change plan is expected to be passed smoothly
at a meeting of CSBC board directors to be held in Taipei Friday.
The plan will then be referred to a meeting of CSBC general
investors slated for March 1 for final approval.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Economic Affairs also announced last month a plan
to change the name of the state-run Chinese Petroleum Corp. (CPC)
to "CPC, Taiwan."
</P>
<P>
The opposition  parties have accused the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party of "ruling the nation with ideology" in a bid
to blot out the last vestiges of China's influence from the
country.
