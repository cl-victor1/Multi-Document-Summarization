A three-year-old girl died early this month of serious
complications caused by type B influenza, becoming the fifth flu-
related fatality recorded in the country this winter, the Center
for Disease Control (CDC) reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The victim, a Hsinchu City resident, was hospitalized Jan. 22 for
fever, sore throat, diarrhea, vomiting and decreased level of
consciousness, CDC officials said.
</P>
<P>
Despite receiving intensive medical care, the girl developed
complications, including cardiopulmonary failure, shock and
cerebral edema, and died Feb. 1, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
According to CDC Deputy Director-General Shih Wen-yi, tests
confirmed that the girl was infected with type B influenza. She
had not received flu vaccination this winter or last winter.
</P>
<P>
CDC tallies show that 24 cases of severe influenza have been
confirmed this winter, with all five fatalities caused by the
type B influenza virus.
</P>
<P>
Shih said the good news is that the number of flu cases reported
around the country is decreasing, with the ratio of patients
making medical visits for flu having dropped to 4.99 percent last
week from 5.55 percent the previous week.
</P>
<P>
Despite the slight decline in the number of new flu cases, Shih
reminded the public that the country still remains in the peak
period of flu season and that there might be a small outbreak
during the upcoming Lunar New Year holiday.
