</HEADLINE>

Taipei, Feb. 8 (CNA) 02/08/07  12:11:06 (By Sofia Wu)
</P>
<P>
Relevant government agencies should pull out all the stops to
stamp out child abuse and enhance children's well-being, Premier
Su Tseng-chang said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Su made the remarks amid an increasing number of reports of child
abuse cases, including some shocking and horrifying child abuse
and neglect fatalities, in recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
"It's sad and disheartening to hear one after another child
neglect or abuse case, " Su said, adding that the government
cannot stand idly by while many young children face the threat of
abuse.
</P>
<P>
According to government statistics, up to 83 percent of child
abuse fatalities were committed by the children's own parents or
their natural parents' live-in lovers, and 73 percent of the
victims were under 6 years of age.
</P>
<P>
Over the past year, Su said, the government has devoted a huge
amount of funds and manpower to addressing the child abuse issue.
"But the continuing rise in the number of reported child abuse
cases indicate that our efforts are still not sufficient, " Su
said, adding that in the face of rapid social changes, relevant
government agencies should work even harder to protect children
from falling victim to violence or filicide-suicide.
</P>
<P>
According to a Ministry of the Interior (MOI) report, 90 percent
of child abuse cases happened within families, and more than
50,000 children have been listed for special attention as they
live in families at high risk of violence or suicide.
</P>
<P>
An MOI official said the ministry will push for amendments to the
existing child welfare  law to require grass-roots  community
coordinators to report child abuse cases or high-risk families.
</P>
<P>
The official said the ministry is also studying the feasibility
of using funds from the public-interest lottery to set up
regional family welfare service centers for disadvantaged
children  or high-risk families.
</P>
<P>
"We are also considering  stopping  recruiting  grass-roots
community coordinators and using the budget to recruit trained
social workers or caseworkers to strengthen services for
disadvantaged children from high-risk families," the official
added.
