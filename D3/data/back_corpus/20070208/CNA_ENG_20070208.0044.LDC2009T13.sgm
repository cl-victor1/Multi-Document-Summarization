<P>
Legislator Huang Cheng-che of the opposition Taiwan Solidarity
Union (TSU) is to resign following his indictment over his
suspected role in a highway construction scandal, a TSU official
said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Chuang Po-lin, a member of the TSU Central Advisory Committee,
made the remarks after hour-long talks with Huang earlier in the
day.
</P>
<P>
According to Chuang, Huang agreed to resign from his at-large
legislative post before the new legislative session formally
opens later this month.
</P>
<P>
Huang was indicted last November on charges of corruption, breach
of trust and fraud in a scandal involving construction of roads
linking the Taiwan high-speed railway's Shalun station in
southern Tainan County to neighboring townships and cities.
</P>
<P>
Chuang said the legislative seat to be vacated by Huang's
resignation will be filled by Lin Chih-chia, the TSU's incumbent
secretary-general. The party controls 12 seats in the
legislature.
