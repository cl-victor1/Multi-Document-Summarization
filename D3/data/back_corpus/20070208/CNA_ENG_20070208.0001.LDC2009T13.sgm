A member of the Kangshan Township Council in Kaohsiung County was
arrested Wednesday on charges of running a brothel and forcing
Vietnamese women into prostitution.
</P>
<P>
Chang Mao-yung and seven accomplices were taken into custody when
police from the Criminal Investigation Bureau (CIB) raided seven
locations in Kangshan township, Yenchao township and Sanmin
District in Kaohsiung city.
</P>
<P>
The crime ring has been under police surveillance since Kaohsiung
County police separately detained several Vietnamese women
working as prostitutes in the townships of Kangshan and Fengshan
on Jan. 25 and Jan. 28.
</P>
<P>
CIB agents rescued six Vietnamese women who have been forced by
the crime ring to work as sex slaves.
</P>
<P>
According to a spokesman for the CIB's local detachment, Chang
and the "snakehead" of his ring went to Vietnam to recruit women
to work in Taiwan, promising them good employment opportunities.
They brought the Vietnamese women into Taiwan under the guise of
what turned out to be false marriages, and then coaxed or forced
the women into prostitution.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said Chang and his accomplices will be referred to
the Kaohsiung District Public Prosecutors' Office for prosecution
for violating the Organized Crime Prevention Act.
