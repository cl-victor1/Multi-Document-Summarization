CABINET TO ASSESS FEASIBILITY OF PROPOSALS ON TRANSITIONAL
JUSTICE
</HEADLINE>

Taipei, Feb. 8 (CNA) 02/08/07  16:31:44 (By Y.F. Low)
</P>
<P>
The Cabinet will evaluate the feasibility of proposals put forth
by the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) regarding the
pursuit of transitional justice in the country, Cabinet spokesman
Cheng Wen-tsan said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Cheng said he agrees that Taiwan, having achieved democracy
through a peaceful transition of power, needs to further deepen
its democracy and address issues of transitional justice by
providing redress for those victimized during the period of
authoritarian rule and correcting historical truths that were
distorted in the past.
</P>
<P>
However, as the proposals raised by the DPP involve not only the
jurisdiction of the central government but also of local
governments and even the cooperation of the people, the Cabinet
will conduct a comprehensive review of the proposals before
deciding whether to adopt them, Cheng said.
</P>
<P>
Marking the 60th anniversary of the 228 Incident this year, the
DPP has recommended that the government step up its effort in the
pursuit of transitional justice.
</P>
<P>
The DPP has proposed that the country enact a law on transitional
justice, release a report on the truth behind the 228 Incident,
eliminate the remnants of authoritarian rule, and hold various
commemorative events to mark the 228 Incident.
</P>
<P>
Among the measures to eliminate the remnants of authoritarian
rule, the party has asked the Cabinet to remove military guards
posted at the mausoleum of late President Chiang Kai-shek, rename
the Chiang Kai-shek Memorial Hall to "Taiwan Democracy Memorial
Hall" and rename all roads named after Chiang -- who is
considered the key perpetrator of the 228 Incident of 1947 during
which thousands of people were massacred by Kuomintang (KMT)
troops suppressing a rebellion against KMT rule in Taiwan.
