According to a government draft amendment to the Company Act, key
officials of a company should be discharged if they are convicted
of economic crimes in the first instance, economic officials said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) geared up its efforts to
amend the Company Act in pursuit of better corporate governance
in the wake of the Rebar Group scandal and the ministry held a
meeting with academic and businessmen Thursday to exchange views.
</P>
<P>
According to the MOEA draft, board directors, supervisors and
managers of a company are subject to discharge if they are found
guilty of economic crimes in the first instance -- a clause
harsher than the current stipulation, which mostly requires
finalization of a conviction for such crimes to lead to a
compulsory discharge.
</P>
<P>
The draft also proposes that the government review applications
to establish companies more strictly in order to prevent the
practice of setting up several companies with the same capital
and conducting false transactions, officials said.
</P>
<P>
The officials also said that for the sake of the board directors'
autonomy, the law will no longer allow representatives of legal
person shareholdings to serve as both director and supervisor of
a company at the same time.
</P>
<P>
Companies that involve "public interest" or whose shareholders or
capitalization reach a certain amount will be required to go
public under the amended law, officials added.
