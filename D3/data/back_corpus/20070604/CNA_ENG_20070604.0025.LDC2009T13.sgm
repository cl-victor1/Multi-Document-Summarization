President Chen Shui-bian said Monday that the country's anti-drug
war will be long and tough, and he urged more people to join the
authorities' efforts to stamp out illegal drugs.
</P>
<P>
Chen made the remarks while receiving individuals and groups who
have contributed to drug-fighting efforts over the past year.
</P>
<P>
He said that although the government's  efforts to combat
narcotics have borne some fruit, crime related to narcotics, as
well as ensuing problems, have become more complex. This, coupled
with new types of narcotics available, means that "no-one should
let down their guard" and more people should take part in anti-
drug efforts, he said.
</P>
<P>
Chen noted that the government has set 2005-2008 as "the years
for waging war against narcotics."
</P>
<P>
The government has also set a new anti-drug strategy since last
year which he said put the emphasis on cutting the demand for
narcotics.
</P>
<P>
The government now divides drug control work into four major
areas: drug- prevention; drug-rejection; drug rehabilitation; and
drug crackdowns, he added.
