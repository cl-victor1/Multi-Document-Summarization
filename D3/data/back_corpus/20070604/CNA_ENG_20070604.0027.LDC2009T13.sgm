<P>
Most areas of Taiwan can expect "extremely heavy rain" until
Tuesday because of a plum rain front that has remained stationery
over Taiwan, the Central Weather Bureau predicted Monday.
</P>
<P>
CWB meteorologists warned that people in northern, northeastern,
eastern, western and central regions of Taiwan could see
tremendous downpours in short periods and that residents in
central Taiwan, expecially Hsinchu and Miaoli counties,  should
watch out for lightning strikes, falling rocks, landslides and
mudflows.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan's plum rain season this year began May 17 and is expected
to last through early to mid-summer.
</P>
<P>
Formed by moist air over the Pacific  meeting the cooler
continental air mass, the front often brings prolonged
precipitation to East Asian countries.
</P>
<P>
By extremely heavy rain, the CWB refers to an area's accumulated
rainfall exceeding 130 mm within a 24-hour period.
