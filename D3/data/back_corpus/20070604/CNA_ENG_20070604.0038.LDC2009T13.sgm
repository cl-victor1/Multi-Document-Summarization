Kaohsiung, June 4 (CNA) 06/04/07  23:03:43 (By T.C. Jiang)

<P>
Ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) presidential candidate
Frank Hsieh said Monday that he hopes to win at least 60 percent
of the vote in the southern city and county of Kaohsiung in the
2008 presidential election.
</P>
<P>
Hsieh made the remarks while visiting the southern county as part
of a nationwide campaign tour.
</P>
<P>
He expressed appreciation to the people in the county's Renwu
township for supporting him in the DPP's presidential primary,
saying that in the 2004 presidential election, President Chen
Shui-bian won 55 percent of the vote in Kaohsiung County and over
58 percent in Kaohsiung City.
</P>
<P>
The former premier said that Kaohsiung County Magistrate Yang
Chiu-hsing has promised to serve as chief of his election
campaign headquarters in Kaohsiung and that he hopes the vote
percentage can be raised to 60 percent.
</P>
<P>
Opposition Kuomintang (KMT) presidential candidate Ma Ying-jeou
is "unable to unify his party" and often uses opinion polls to
show that he is in the lead at critical moments, Hsieh claimed.
</P>
<P>
Claiming that he knows better than Ma how to protect Taiwan,
Hsieh said Ma supports the opening of direct links between Taiwan
and China, but his own belief is that there should be
"complementary measures" and that both sides should negotiate on
an equal footing.
</P>
<P>
In response to Ma's criticism that the DPP only have slogans but
nothing of substance, Hsieh said the DPP government has solved
flooding problems in flood- prone areas, has cleaned up the Love
River in Kaohsiung City, and will complete Kaohsiung City's mass
rapid transit (MRT) system soon.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, Taipei Mayor Hau Long-bin is still talking
about cleaning up the Tamshui River, which his predecessor Ma
also talked about eight years ago, Hsieh said.
</P>
<P>
Rebutting Ma's remarks that Taiwan should learn from Singapore,
Hsieh pointed out that the city state is not as democratic as
Taiwan, and that Taiwan should learn how Singapore became
independent instead.
</P>
<P>
In his capacity as premier in 2005, Hsieh said he introduced an
eight-year, NT$80 billion (US$2.42 billion) flood-prevention
project to take care of minority groups.
</P>
<P>
In addition, he initiated a four-year, NT$40 million plan to
improve old classrooms in central and southern Taiwan, rather
than in northern Taiwan, where he claimed "there are no old
classrooms."
</P>
<P>
If elected president, he vowed to continue to take care of the
disadvantaged and seek "transitional justice," Hsieh went on.
</P>
<P>
Claiming that Ma does not understand the hardships of the people,
even though he recently embarked on a bicycle tour around the
island, Hsieh said a national leader should be capable of solving
people's problems.
