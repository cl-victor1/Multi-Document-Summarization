CEC ATTACKED FOR SETTING DATE FOR LEGISLATIVE POLLS

Taipei,  June 4 (CNA) 06/04/07  19:10:29 (By Flor Wang)

Lawmakers of the main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) held a news
conference Monday to accuse the Central Election Commission (CEC)
of creating chaos by setting the date for the seventh legislative
elections for Jan. 12, 2008.
</P>
<P>
Hsu Shao-ping, KMT legislative caucus whip, said at a Legislative
Yuan news conference that electoral affairs regarding the coming
legislative and presidential elections should be decided by the
next CEC, as current CEC members have to step down June 16 -- the
expiry date of their terms given that a draft CEC Organic Law
concerning the lineup of body has yet to clear the Legislative
Yuan.
</P>
<P>
The CEC set the date during a June 1 meeting and said that it
will soon notify the Executive Yuan of its decision to put off
the legislative elections, originally scheduled for Dec. 11 this
year, to next January.
</P>
<P>
The outgoing CEC members should not make any major decisions on
either the coming legislative elections or the 2008 presidential
race, Hsu argued.
</P>
<P>
KMT lawmaker Wu Yu-sheng accused CEC Chairman Chang Chun-hsiung
of "going too far" in making the important decision without
having followed a due process, especially when there is little
time left of his tenure.
</P>
<P>
The CEC, which lacks a legal foundation, is not entitled to make
major policy shifts aimed at serving the interests of a
particular political party, he said.
</P>
<P>
According to Wu, the KMT legislative caucus whip is not opposed
to altering the date of any election as long as the CEC observes
the legal process.  The decision unilaterally made by the CEC is
questionable, he said.
