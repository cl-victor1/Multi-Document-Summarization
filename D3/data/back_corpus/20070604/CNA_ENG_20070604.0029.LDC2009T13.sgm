Taipei,  June  4 (CNA) 06/04/07  21:36:44 (By Lilian Wu)

<P>
Main opposition Kuomintang presidential candidate Ma Ying-jeou is
scheduled to visit India and Singapore June 11-15, Ma's office
said in a press release Monday.
</P>
<P>
The office said Ma will call on business and industrial leaders
during his visit to India before heading for Singapore to meet
with business leaders and visit economic facilities there.
</P>
<P>
The press release said that over the past seven years under the
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) administration, Taiwan's
economy has undergone dramatic regression, and claimed that this
has been due to the DPP's "obsession with ideology and its
incompetence in good governance."
</P>
<P>
Taiwan's economic growth ranked at the bottom among Asia's Four
Little Dragons, which also include Hong Kong, South Korea and
Singapore, and even trailed behind those of Thailand, the
Philippines, Indonesia, Malaysia and Vietnam, it claimed.
</P>
<P>
The DPP's maneuvering over the issue of a "de jure Taiwan
independence" has also turned the island into a "troublemaker"
internationally, the press release claimed.
</P>
<P>
Ma thinks that only by adopting a more flexible and pragmatic
"dynamic  economy, " lowering  the  ideological  struggle  and
strengthening exchanges in economy, trade, culture and tourism
with other Asian countries, can it break out of its isolation and
re-invent its economic miracle, the press release said.
</P>
<P>
Accompanying Ma will be high-tech industry expert Steve Hsieh,
financial expert Yin Chii-ming, online newspaper DigiTimes
President Huang Ching-yang and former ROC Ambassador to the
Dominican Republic John Feng.
