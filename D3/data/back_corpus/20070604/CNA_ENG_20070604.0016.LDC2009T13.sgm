Easy Cards issued by the Taipei Smart Card Corp. to pay fares on
the city's metro system and buses, as well as to pay for
municipal parking fees, will also be good for paying taxi fares
in a trial period beginning November.

In a briefing to Mayor Hau Lung-bin Monday, the company's general
manager, Lin Chih-ying, said they are seeking 1,000 taxis in the
city willing to accept payment with Easy Cards, which would allow
discounts for the physically challenged, and senior citizens.

In order to encourage taxi drivers to join the program, the
corporation is mulling the idea of paying the cost of installing
card readers, which are NT$18,000 (US$543) per unit, Lin said,
adding that this would need to be approved by the city
government, which controls the card corporation.

<P>
Technically, Lin said, there would be no difficulty using Easy
Cards to pay taxi fares.
