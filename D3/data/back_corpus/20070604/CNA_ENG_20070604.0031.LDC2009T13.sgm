<P>
A package of draft amendments to the Anti-Money Laundering Law
cleared a legislative committee Monday with the aim of allowing
the country to better contribute to global anti-terrorism and
anti-money laundering efforts.
</P>
<P>
The law amendment will also list suspects engaged in money
laundering of more than NT$5 million as criminals, a tightening
of the previous level of NT$20 million that is designed to crack
down on economic crime.
</P>
<P>
The package will also criminalize the financing of terrorist
acts, including murder, arson, hijacking of trains, ships and
airplanes or planting bombs for religious, racial or ideological
reasons.
</P>
<P>
In addition, people caught profiteering through fraud or scams
will also be charged as major economic criminals.
</P>
<P>
The draft package further requires financial institutions to
record and report the identities of customers engaging in
suspicious deals or currency transactions to units under the
Executive Yuan and to keep receipts of all such transactions.
</P>
<P>
Both outbound and inbound travelers must declare their holdings
in foreign currency and travelers checks above a certain ceiling
set by the government to customs authorities. Under the current
law, departing or entering passengers cannot carry more than
US$10,000 with them.
</P>
<P>
According to government officials, the law revision is expected
to help Taiwan solidify its position in the Egmont Group, as it
is feared that China might try to force a name change of Taiwan
in the group. They pointed out that the group wrote to its 20
members in early May asking them to complete relevant legislation
or face suspension of their membership rights.
</P>
<P>
To better help the international battle against money laundering,
the Bureau of Investigation under the Ministry of Justice joined
the Egmont Group in 1998 under the designation of "MLPC (Money
Laundering Prevention Center), Taiwan," the officials said.
