Taipei,  June 4 (CNA) 06/04/07  18:05:55 (By Deborah Kuo)

<P>
Taiwan and Vietnam signed a memorandum of understanding Monday
aimed at bolstering high-technology exchanges and cooperation
between the two countries, the non-profit Institute for
Information Industry (III) reported.
</P>
<P>
The memorandum -- mainly calling for increased Taiwan investment
in Vietnam's information technology industry -- was inked by III
Chairman Ke Chih-sheng; Hoang Le Minh, deputy director of Ho Chi
Minh City's Department of Posts and Telecommunications, and Pham
Ngoc Tuan, an executive manager of the Saigon High- Tech Park, in
a ceremony held at the III headquarters.
</P>
<P>
Relocating part of Taiwan's investments to Vietnam will help
reduce the risks from concentrating too much investment in China
and create a win-win situation for Taiwan and Vietnam, Ke said
during the ceremony.
</P>
<P>
Ke, who led III officials to Vietnam for a fact-finding trip in
January, said that Vietnam, with a hardworking labor force, has
witnessed ever-expanding economic growth over the past several
years, averaging 7-8 percent annually.
</P>
<P>
He quoted International Telecommunication  Union tallies as
indicating that Vietnam has registered the world's second highest
growth in the telecommunication industry in recent years, behind
only China.
</P>
<P>
The III head attributed Vietnam's success mainly to the fact that
the country has abundant and inexpensive human resources.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan, which remains the largest investor in Vietnam, will also
benefit by continuing to increase its investment in Vietnam, Ke
noted.
</P>
<P>
For his part, Pham said that Vietnam, a relative "newcomer" to
the high- technology industrial sector as compared to Taiwan,
hopes to strengthen exchanges with Taiwan in this regard.
</P>
<P>
According to III tallies, as of the end of November 2006,
Taiwanese companies had channeled US$8.128 billion into Vietnam
for various investment projects, constituting 13.74 percent of
all foreign investment in Vietnam. The figure made Taiwan the
largest foreign investor in Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam applied to join the World Trade Organization at the end
of 2006 and gained entry into the organization at the beginning
of this year. The country's entry into the WTO has so far
attracted investment from Japan, South Korea, Europe and the
United States amounting to over US$12 billion, III officials
said.
</P>
<P>
Besides, they said, the Vietnamese government has announced that
it will lower import tariffs on 330 categories of information
technology and telecommunication products between 2008 and 2010
to attract more foreign investment to help accelerate the
development of its high-tech industries.
