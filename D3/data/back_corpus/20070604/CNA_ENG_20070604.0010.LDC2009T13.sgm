Taipei City health officials on Monday advised people who are
preparing to travel to Canada in the near future to get
vaccinated against mumps before their departure as that country
is experiencing an outbreak of the highly infectious disease,
with about 300 cases being reported in May.
</P>
<P>
Mumps is an acute viral disease which is spread among human
beings  by saliva droplets  or direct contact  with articles
contaminated with infected saliva. Children aged nine or younger
are prone to the disease. While symptoms are generally not severe
in children, nearly 30 percent of male adults who are infected
with mumps develop orchitis, while about 5 percent of female
patients develop ovaritis.
</P>
<P>
The incubation period is usually 12-25 days, with affected
persons suffering from fever and painful swelling of the salivary
glands, according to Lin Pi-fen, deputy chief of the city disease
control department.

Lin noted that Taiwan began free inoculation services against
mumps in 2004. Since then, the infection rate of the disease has
significantly decreased on the island, with only five cases being
reported in 2006.
</P>
<P>
Although mumps is usually not a fatal disease, Lin said, the
disease is used as a public health indicator. He advised that all
infants aged 12-15 months should be vaccinated against the
disease and that anyone planning to travel to affected areas get
vaccinated at least two weeks before departing on their trip.
