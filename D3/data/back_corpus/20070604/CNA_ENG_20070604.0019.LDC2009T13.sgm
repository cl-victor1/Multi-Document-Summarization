The Cabinet-level Environmental Protection Administration (EPA)
plans to ban all government agencies, schools and hospitals from
using disposable cups from July 1 to further reduce the amount of
solid waste generated, EPA officials said Monday.
</P>
<P>
The officials noted that although all government agencies and
Taiwan's 978 schools have already stopped using disposable
tableware in their dining halls since July 1 and Sept.  1 last
year, respectively, in observance of a ban by the EPA, the use of
disposable cups outside dining halls has continued.
</P>
<P>
According to EPA estimates, the ban on disposable tableware is
expected to reduce the solid waste generated in Taiwan by 2,600
metric tons each year.
</P>
<P>
The EPA will conduct inspections to enforce the ban and violators
will be liable to fines of between NT$1,200 and NT$6,000 under
the Waste Disposal Act, the officials said.
