MAC URGES CHINA TO SET MECHANISM TO SYSTEMATICALLY COMBAT CRIME
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  Jan. 16 (CNA) 01/16/07  16:53:45 (By Lilian Wu)

<P>
The Cabinet-level Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) urged China
Tuesday to establish a cross-strait mechanism to jointly fight
crime.
</P>
<P>
MAC Vice Chairman Liu Teh-shun made the remarks when he met with
Legislators Hsu Jung-shu of the ruling Democratic Progressive
Party as well as Kuo Su-chun and Chu Fong-chi of the opposition
Kuomintang, who called on Liu to exchange views with him on their
plan to organize an inter-party group to China to help establish
a mechanism to systematically fight crime.
</P>
<P>
Liu noted that both sides of the Taiwan Strait signed an
agreement in the outlying island of Kinmen in 1990 mainly to deal
with Chinese illegal immigrants and their repatriation, but the
agreement was signed between the Red Cross Societies on either
side without the participation of the government.
</P>
<P>
But with ever closer exchanges between the two sides of the
Taiwan Strait, a great number of white-collar criminals and other
types of fugitives have emerged, Liu said.
</P>
<P>
He said that China has received notifications from Taiwan in
recent years on 72 white-collar criminals and 640 fugitives
involved in crimes of other types although China has yet to
repatriate even one white-collar criminal and has only sent back
somewhat more than 200 fugitives of other types.
</P>
<P>
"China should seriously  address  the problem of Taiwanese
criminals seeking refuge in China, " Liu said, expressing the
hope that current practice of dealing with criminals on a case by
case basis might evolve  into a systematic approach  to combating
cross-strait crime.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that government authorities on both sides of the
Taiwan Strait should take part in the talks so as to enforce
effectively any agreement inked between them.
</P>
<P>
KMT Legislator Chu noted that the recent case of Taiwanese tycoon
Wang You- theng, founder of the financially distressed Rebar Asia
Pacific Group, fleeing to China has highlighted the problem of
Taiwanese criminals seeking safe haven in China.
</P>
<P>
With the latest incident involving Wang, legislators hope to play
a role in the repatriation of economic and common criminals in
China, Chu said.
</P>
<P>
She expressed the hope that the MAC and the National Police
Agency will send officials to go with the group to help both
sides establish a mechanism to systematically combat crime so as
to make up for the deficiencies of the Kinmen Agreement.
