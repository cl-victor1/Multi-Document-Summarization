Taiwan's income inequality is moderate compared with other
countries, with the latest statistics showing its Gini
coefficient -- a measure of inequality in income distribution --
recording 0.326 in 2000-2002, lower than those of other major
Asian economies, Council for Economic Planning and Development
(CEPD) officials said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
According to the tallies released last year, the officials said
Taiwan  was behind only Japan,  which reported  a 0.284 Gini
coefficient.
</P>
<P>
The Gini coefficient is defined as a ratio with values between
zero and one used to measure  income  inequality,  with zero
corresponding to perfect income equality -- meaning everyone has
the same income -- while one corresponds to perfect income
inequality -- meaning that one person has all the income, while
everyone else has zero.
</P>
<P>
The level of 0.4 is commonly regarded as a figure that should
prompt an alert and reflects serious income inequality, according
to the CEPD.
</P>
<P>
Singapore's Gini coefficient registered 0.48 in the 2000-2002
period, while that of South Korea recorded 0.358 and that of
China was 0.45.
