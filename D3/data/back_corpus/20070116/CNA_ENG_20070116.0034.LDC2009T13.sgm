The name of the candidate to be chosen by the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) to run in the 2008 presidential  election
will be announced in June, DPP Deputy Secretary-General Tsai
Huang-liang said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Tsai said party hopefuls should register their interest in
running with the party in early April. DPP members will then vote
in early May, and public opinion polls will be conducted in June.
</P>
<P>
Public opinion polls will account for 70 percent of the primary
results, while the party vote will account for the other 30
percent, he said.
</P>
<P>
Some within the DPP have suggested that voting in the first stage
of the primary be moved ahead to March and that the presidential
candidate be announced in May, believing that this will be
favorable to the integration of various factions within the party
and give the candidate more time for election campaigning.
</P>
<P>
But Tsai said that most DPP members agreed to the party's plan,
and that the time schedule has been set by referring to past
practice.
</P>
<P>
The schedule for producing the party's presidential candidate
will be sent to the DPP Central Standing Committee for discussion
at the end of the month, he added.
