Taiwan exhibitors Monday, cutting ribbons for them to play up
their presence in the exhibition, according to a spokesman for
the event.

the exhibition and encouraged them to do their utmost to succeed
in striking profitable deals.

Plasto Ispack 2007 was slated to be held in Israel last
September, but was delayed due to a war between Israel and
Lebanon last July and August, said the spokesman.

600 firms from Israel and abroad to showcase their products, the
spokesman said.

containers by the Feng Huang Plastic Co. in Yunlin County have
drawn a great deal of attention, the spokesman said, adding that
the products are made from 70 percent stone powder and 30 percent
plastic, are able to withstand high-temperatures and carry a
price tag as low as ordinary plastics products.
