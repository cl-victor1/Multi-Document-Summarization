<P>
The Executive Yuan will ratify the Sakizaya as Taiwan's 13th
indigenous tribe Jan. 17, a government official said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
According to the official, the Sakizaya were categorized as
members of the Ami tribe by Japanese ethnologists during the
period of Japanese colonization, but later scholars distinguished
them as a separate tribe because their languages differ greatly.
</P>
<P>
Encouraged By the Kavalan and Taroko tribes' ratifications,
Sakizaya representatives started tracing the tribe's history and
culture and applied to the Council of Indigenous People for
ratification in 2004.
</P>
<P>
The Sakizaya are mainly distributed around Hualien City and
Hualien county's Shoufeng, Jueisuei and Fengbin townships. It has
a strong sense of individualism from other tribes and is active
in establishing autonomous organizations.
</P>
<P>
The Executive Yuan asked the council to provide information on
the Sakizaya and to set up an approval procedure when drafting
the Aborigine Identification Law to deal with possible new
application cases, the official said.
