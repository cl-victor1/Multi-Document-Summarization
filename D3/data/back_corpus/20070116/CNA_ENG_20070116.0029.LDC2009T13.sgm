Environmental officials in Kaohsiung vowed Tuesday to reduce the
city's greenhouse gas emissions after they found out that the
southern port city tops the world in terms of emissions of carbon
dioxide and other greenhouse gases.

Statistics compiled by the Environmental Protection Bureau under
the Kaohsiung city government show that Kaohsiung's greenhouse
gas emissions total 52 million metric tons a year, accounting for
almost 20 percent of Taiwan's entire emissions.

Taiwan discharges 230 million metric tons of carbon dioxide and
other gases a year into the atmosphere, placing Taiwan as the
22nd-highest greenhouse gas emitter in the world.

A spokesman for the bureau acknowledged that with emissions of
34.74 metric tons per capita, Kaohsiung has become he the city
with the highest greenhouse gas emissions in the world.

He said the environmental authorities in Kaohsiung will try to
reduce the city's greenhouse gas emissions, although Taiwan is
not a signatory to the Kyoto Protocol -- a United Nations treaty
on climate change that went into effect Feb. 16, 2005 and
requires all member countries to reduce the emissions of carbon
dioxide and other greenhouse gases.

The spokesman said measures to be enforced include putting
restrictions on the burning of "ghost money," setting stricter
standards for exhaust emissions by cars using diesel and
requiring filling stations to install vapor recovery systems.
