A Taiwanese music group invited to perform in Cannes, France
later this month staged a performance at a press conference
Monday in the southern county of Pingtung.
</P>
<P>
The music group, which is the first ever from Taiwan to be
invited to perform at the MIDEM international music fair, the
world's largest music industry trade fair, is scheduled to depart
for France Jan. 19. In the past, there were only individual
Taiwanese performers invited to take part in the event.

<P>
Many non-English speaking countries use this event to promote
their unique styles of music.
</P>
<P>
The Taiwanese group features two singers -- Tsai Ming-feng, one
of artists currently in residence at the county's Fanglaio F3 ART
Venue, and local record producer Lin Giong.

At the press conference, Tsai sang a song he wrote himself with a
mix of ancient Chinese music elements, while Lin played
background music he composed with Indian and Buddhist musical
flavors.
