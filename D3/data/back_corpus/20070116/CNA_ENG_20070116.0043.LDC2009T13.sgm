Japan's Nakajima Loshto Co. will continue working with a
Taiwanese rice firm, the Unionrice Co., to plant a special strain
of rice known as " Dream Beauty" in Taiwan, an Agriculture and
Food Agency spokesman said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The two companies collaborated in 2006 to produce "Dream Beauty"
in the southern county of Tainan and exported two thirds of the
harvest to Japan in small packages of home deliveries.

Encouraged by good market response, the two firms will continue
the plantation but move the area totaling 80 hectares to Changhua
and Pintung counties. Half of harvest will be exported to Japan
in small packages. The cooperative contract will bring better
profits to Taiwanese farmers as "Dream Beauty" can fetch higher
prices in the market, the spokesman said.

<P>
Unionrice Co. and Nakajima Loshto Co. will co-host a seminar on
agricultural production and marketing at Taipei office of the
Agriculture and Food Agency Jan. 17. During the seminar they will
renew their contract and formally initiate their cooperation
program, according to the spokesman.
