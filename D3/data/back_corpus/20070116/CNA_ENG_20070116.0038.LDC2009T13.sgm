Beinan township in Taitung County is scheduled to hold a custard
apple festival and a series of cultural activities Jan. 20-21 to
let the public know what they should not miss when they visit the
township.

Taitung County Deputy Magistrate Huang Fa-lou told a press
conference that the county produces 70,000 metric tons of custard
apples a year, accounting for 85 percent of Taiwan's total
production of the fruit, and that only a small amount -- about
100 metric tons -- is exported to China, Hong Kong, Singapore and
Canada.

He said that July to February is the harvest period for Beinan
township's custard apple variety, while the December to March
period is the harvest season for pineapple custard apples,
another strain of the fruit.

<P>
Custard apples are also known to Taiwanese farmers as "barbarian
lichi" because its immature fruit looks like lichi and because
the fruit was introduced from overseas. The fruit is also
sometimes called Buddha-head fruit since the ripe fruit looks
like the head of Buddha.

The festival is aimed at helping visitors know more about the
fruit, Huang said, adding that dishes and drinks using custard
apple as an ingredient will also be presented during the two-day
event.

Chang Ching-chung, head of Beinan township, said the township
government will provide free shuttle buses from the town center
to the county's various scenic spots, including the Beinan
Cultural Park, the Chulu Pasture, the Chihpen Hot Spring resort
and the local botanical gardens.
