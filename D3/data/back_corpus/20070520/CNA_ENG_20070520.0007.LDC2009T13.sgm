The Taipei City government has recently begun promoting a "cool
biz" concept borrowed from Japan in an attempt to lead
environmentally-friendly efforts of energy saving.
</P>
<P>
Taipei Mayor Hau Lung-bin, known as the "green" mayor, who served
as chief of the Environmental Protection Administration between
2001-2003, began to wear short-sleeved shirts to the office last
week to promote the notion of saving energy.
</P>
<P>
Other city government officials, including Department of Labor
Director Su Ying- kuei and Department of Information Director
Yang Hsiao-tung, also began going to the office wearing short-
sleeved polo shirts or T-shirts as of Friday.
</P>
<P>
Hau, who has promoted a number of environmental protection and
energy saving measures since assuming the mayorship last
December, said Sunday that making Taipei an environmentally-
friendly city is a set policy of his government.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese Environment Ministry began advocating the Cool Biz
campaign in the summer 2005 in efforts to save energy by limiting
air conditioning, demanding that central government offices set
air conditioner temperatures at 28 degrees Celsius until
September.
</P>
<P>
Under the Cool Biz dress code, workers are advised to starch
their collars so they stand up and to wear trousers made from
materials that breathe and absorb moisture. In addition, Japanese
workers are encouraged to wear short-sleeved shirts and do
without jackets or ties.
