Taipei,  May 20 (CNA) 05/20/07  15:37:11 (By Deborah Kuo)

President Chen Shui-bian joined a group of young volunteers in
cleaning up marine oil spills near Hsiaoliuchiu, an islet off the
southernmost county of Pingtung, Sunday to mark the seventh
anniversary of his inauguration.
</P>
<P>
Flanked by some 50 volunteers and 20-odd members of the foreign
diplomatic corps posted in Taiwan, Chen took a ferry to
Hsiaoliuchiu at around 10: 20 a.m., where he cleaned up spilled
oil that has contaminated areas of the islet's major fishing
port.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the activity, Chen said he will also be happy to
volunteer next year after leaving office.
</P>
<P>
He also expressed the hope that the 12 universities to which the
government has earmarked a mammoth fund of NT$50 billion (US$1.5
billion)  since 2006 in an attempt  to make them first-class
universities in the world, will begin to repay Taiwan society one
year from now.
</P>
<P>
Also during the trip to Hsiaoliuchiu, Chen took part in a short
journey to an area about two nautical miles offshore the islet
where he watched experts put in place an artificial fishery reef.
</P>
<P>
Chen noted that the reef is a floating one and therefore will not
cause damage to the coral reefs or other marine life in the area.
However, he added that he welcomes public debate on concerns that
manmade fishery structures may cause damage to marine ecologies.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile,  Chen  disclosed  that  Cho  Jung-tai,  deputy
secretary-general of the Presidential Office, will serve as
acting secretary-general of the Presidential Office, succeeding
Chiou I-jen, who will be sworn in as vice premier Monday.
