Premier-designate  Chang Chun-hsiung introduced his new
administrative team to the media Sunday, on the eve of the new
Cabinet's swear-in ceremony.
</P>
<P>
Chang and members of the new Cabinet are scheduled to be sworn in
at the Presidential Office at 8: 30 a.m, to be followed by a
joint changeover ceremony slated for 11 a.m. at the Executive
Yuan and an Executive Yuan meeting at 3 p.m. the same day,
according to the Government Information Office.
</P>
<P>
After fast-paced personnel changes over the past several days, a
new Chang administrative team was largely shaped as of Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The new members of the Cabinet include Vice Premier Chiou I-jen,
Defense Minister Lee Tien-yu, Minister-without-Portfolio Liu Yu-
shan, Executive  Yuan Secretary-General  Chen Ching-chun,
Government Information Office (GIO) Minister Shieh Jhy-wey,
Council of Labor Affairs Chairman  Lu Tien-ling, Council for
Cultural  Affairs Chairwoman Wong Chin-chu, Council of Indigenous
Peoples Chairman Yichiang Paluer and Atomic Energy Council
Chairman Su Hsien- chang.
</P>
<P>
According  Executive  Yuan  Secretary-General-designate  Chen
Ching-chun, former GIO Minister Huang Hui-chen will serve as a
minister-without-portfolio, while ruling Democratic Progressive
Party Legislator Chen Chung-hsin will serve as a deputy minister
of the Environmental Protection Administration (EPA).
</P>
<P>
As of Sunday, only three ministers-without-portfolio positions
and the post of EPA minister had yet to be finalized.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the ministers of the interior, education, justice and
health will retain their posts. Heads of the Council of
Agriculture, the Council for Hakka Affairs, the National Science
Council, the National Youth Commission and the National Council
on Physical Fitness and Sports will also keep their posts.
</P>
<P>
Chang has been allowed a very short period to shape his new
Cabinet,  political observers  said,  adding  that  the Chang
administrative team is expected to be on track soon, given that
Chang -- formerly a premier and chairman of the Straits Exchange
Foundation -- has no faction affiliations and is enjoying a free
hand in conducting  the personnel reshuffle.  President Chen
Shui-bian appointed Chang as the new premier May 14 to succeed
Premier Su Tseng-chang after Su submitted his resignation May 12,
one week after he lost the ruling Democratic Progressive Party
presidential primary to his predecessor Frank Hsieh.
