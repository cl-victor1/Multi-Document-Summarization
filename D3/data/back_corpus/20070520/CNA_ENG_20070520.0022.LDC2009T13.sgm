FOREIGN MINISTER VOWS TO CEMENT TIES WITH CENTRAL AMERICAN ALLIES
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  May 20 (CNA) 05/20/07  22:55:43 (By Sofia Wu)
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) will pull out all the
stops to consolidate the country's diplomatic relations with its
allies in Central America, Minister of Foreign Affairs James
Huang said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Huang made the remarks amid reports of concern about a possible
"wave of diplomatic defection to China" or "switch of diplomatic
allegiance to China" of Taiwan's allies in the region.
</P>
<P>
Admittedly, Huang said, Taiwan faces tough challenges on its
diplomatic front due to China's perennial efforts to lure away
its diplomatic allies and block its presence in world arena.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Huang said a so-called "wave of defection" or
"exodus" of Central American diplomatic allies to China after May
20 is speculative and far from truth.
</P>
<P>
Huang will head for Belize Monday to meet with his counterparts
from Central American countries that maintain diplomatic
relations with the Republic of China on Taiwan. The meeting is a
regular annual event which takes place alternately in Taiwan and
one of its allies in the region.
</P>
<P>
This year's meeting is drawing  more attention  as it is
overshadowed  by another  setback  for Taipei in its bid for
participation in the World Health Organization (WHO).
</P>
<P>
In a May 14 vote in Geneva, two of its Central American allies --
Panama and Nicaragua -- were absent during the voting and another
-- Costa Rica -- unexpectedly voted against the bid.
</P>
<P>
The MOFA already filed a protest to Costa Rica through diplomatic
channel over the incident. Media reports said whether Costa Rican
Foreign Minister Bruno Stagno attends the May 25 meeting in
Belize between  Taiwan's  foreign  minister and his Central
American counterparts  would become the "index" measuring the
state of bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
The reports also speculated that if Costa Rica were to switch its
diplomatic allegiance from Taipei to Beijing, it might have a so-
called "domino effect, " triggering an "exodus" or "wave of
defection" to China of Taiwan's diplomatic allies in the region.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with CNA on the eve of his departure for Belize,
Huang said such speculation is meaningless and could mislead
local people into misperception of the country's diplomatic
prospects.
</P>
<P>
During his forthcoming trip to Belize, Huang said he will also
preside over a working meeting of Taiwan's diplomatic mission
chiefs in the region to discuss viable strategies to retain its
diplomatic allies in the face of China's growing economic and
political clout in the world community.
</P>
<P>
"We'll have a brainstorming session to work out strategies to
counter China's efforts to cut the ground from under our feet,"
Huang said.
</P>
<P>
According to Huang, the Costa Rican and Panamanian foreign
minister will not attend the ROC-Central American foreign
ministers meeting in person because of their busy schedule and
will instead be represented by their deputies. It remains
uncertain whether the Nicaraguan foreign minister will personally
attend the meeting, Huang added.
