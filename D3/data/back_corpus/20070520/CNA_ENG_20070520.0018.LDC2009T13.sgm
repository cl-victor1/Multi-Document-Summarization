The Bureau of Investigation announced Sunday that it apprehended
a suspect who produced ketamine at a luxury apartment in the
central city of Taichung, making it the first ketamine
manufacturing plant that has been uncovered in central Taiwan.

The bureau investigators said that it seized 25.3 kg of ketamine
with an estimated street value of around NT$30 million
(US$900,000).

The 26-year-old suspect used the tightly-guarded luxury apartment
to cover up his operations and purchased a NT$100,000 large air
filter to prevent the smell of the drug from being detected by
neighbors, the investigators noted.

The suspect recently sold many of his high purity drugs to hotels
and pubs in central and southern Taiwan, the investigators said,
adding that police are currently hunting down his accomplice.
