A local university awarded honorary doctoral degrees to a
novelist, a dancer, and a business tycoon to recognize their
career achievements and contributions to Taiwan Saturday.
</P>
<P>
National Chengchi University presented the degrees at a ceremony
held as part of its 80th anniversary celebrations.
</P>
<P>
Wu Se-hwa, the university's president, said that "wuxia" or
martial arts novelist Jin Yong, choreographer Lin Huai-min and
Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC) Chairman Morris
Chang have set good examples for others in Taiwan to follow.
</P>
<P>
Jin Yong, an alumnus of the university, said humbly that if he
has made any small achievements in his life, he attributes them
to his teachers and encouragement from many people.
</P>
<P>
Jin Yong, also a senior journalist, wrote 15 novels, many of
which  have been translated  into English,  French,  Japanese,
Vietnamese, Malay and Korean.
</P>
<P>
Lin, also an alumnus of the university, encouraged the school's
students to be brave and never give up their dreams.
</P>
<P>
Lin founded Cloud Gate Dance Theater in 1973. He was selected as
one of the top 10 distinguished young people in Taiwan in 1983
and received the Ramon Magsaysay Award, which is regarded as the
Asian version of the Nobel Prize, in 1999.
</P>
<P>
Chang said that the honorable doctoral degree is very meaningful
to him because it is his first in the field of business
management.
</P>
<P>
Chang stressed that one should not make money just for oneself
and should instead "increase the added value of society and the
company."
</P>
<P>
Chang, who won Ph.D. in electrical engineering from Stanford
University  in 1964,  is considered  the  father  of Taiwan's
semiconductor industry.
