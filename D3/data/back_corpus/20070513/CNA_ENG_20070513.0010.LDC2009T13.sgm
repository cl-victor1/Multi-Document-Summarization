PFP LAWMAKER THREATENS TO 'TOPPLE CABINET' IF EX-PREMIER RESUMES
POST

Taipei,   May  13  (CNA) 05/13/07  15:54:17 (By Deborah Kuo)
</P>
<P>
Opposition People First Party (PFP) Legislator Fu Kun-chi
threatened Sunday to move to topple the Democratic Progressive
Party (DPP) Cabinet if former Premier Chang Chun-hsing is
appointed by President Chen Shui-bian to return to the premier's
post.
</P>
<P>
Fu said he would initiate a motion to topple the next Cabinet if
Chang, currently chairman of the quasi-official Straits Exchange
Foundation, is appointed by Chen to succeed Premier Su Tseng-
chang, who quit the premiership over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
Outgoing Su,  who suffered a surprise  loss in the DPP's
presidential primary May 6, announced his resignation Saturday,
saying that he would step aside to allow Chen a free hand to deal
with the ever-changing political situation during the last year
of his tenure.
</P>
<P>
Chen's term will expire May 20, 2008 and former Premier Frank
Hsieh is set to be nominated by the DPP to run in the 2008
presidential election following his convincing primary victory.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the Cabinet-toppling plan is just his personal idea,
Fu claimed that if Chang is appointed the next premier, he will
merely be a figurehead manipulated by Chen.
</P>
<P>
He argued that Su should not have linked the DPP presidential
primary vote to the operations of the country's administration or
national policies.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, PFP spokesman Lee Hung-chun noted that Su submitted
his resignation just one week after his defeat in the DPP primary
vote, indicating that Su has sustained external pressure beyond
the results of the primary.
</P>
<P>
Lee said the PFP leadership has not discussed a no-confidence
vote as mentioned by Fu earlier Sunday, but added that the PFP
will respect Fu's freedom of speech.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, an opposition Kuomintang (KMT) heavyweight said the
KMT will allow the new premier, whoever he is, to make his
administrative report to the legislature in accordance with the
Constitution.
</P>
<P>
Tseng Yung-chuan pointed out that if Chang is indeed named by
Chen to succeed Su, he will be obliged to make himself clear to
the legislature as to why he was resolutely opposed to the
construction of the Fourth Nuclear Power Plant during his
previous stint as premier.
</P>
<P>
Describing Chen's changing of the premier -- six in seven years
-- as "discarding tissue paper, " Tseng said Legislative Yuan
Speaker Wang Jin-pyng should coordinate the next premier's report
to the legislature or the probability of a motion to prolong the
current legislative session in the wake of Su's surprise
resignation.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, KMT presidential candidate Ma Ying-jeou said Fu's idea
of toppling the Cabinet is not against the law but should not be
implemented until careful consideration of the overall national
situation has been made.
</P>
<P>
Ma suggested that the KMT and its "pan blue alliance" ally the
PFP engage in discussion on opposition strategies when a new
premier is actually appointed.
