TAIWAN OFFICIALS ARRIVE IN GENEVA TO PUSH FOR WHO ACCESSION
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Geneva,  May 12 (CNA) 05/13/07  15:34:47 (By Neil Lu and Deborah
Kuo)
</P>
<P>
Health Minister Hou Sheng-mao and Deputy Foreign Minister Yang
Tzu-pao arrived in Geneva Saturday to push for Taiwan's accession
to the World Health Organization (WHO).
</P>
<P>
At a news conference held upon his arrival in Geneva, where the
World Health Assembly (WHA) , the WHO's top decision-making arm,
is scheduled to take place May 14-23, Hou said that although
Taiwan's bid to become a full member of the WHO under the name of
"Taiwan" is the government's top mission this year, the efforts
do not alter Taiwan's determination to seek meaningful
participation in WHO activities.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan's goals of "meaningful participation" include taking part
in technical- level meetings under the framework of the
International Health Regulations (IHR) , joining the Global
Outbreak Alert and Response Network and the Framework Convention
on Tobacco Control, as well as partaking in WHO-sponsored
meetings on food sanitation, avian flu and tuberculosis, Hou
said.
</P>
<P>
He added that Taiwan announced the implementation of the IHR May
15, 2006 and that he personally wrote to WHO Director-General
Margaret Chan May 2 this year to tell her Taiwan had relevant
statutes revised to cope with the implementation of the IHR
worldwide June 15 and that the Center for Disease Control had
been appointed as a liaison window with the WHO authorities in
this regard.
</P>
<P>
Chan has not acknowledged receiving the letter, Hou noted.
</P>
<P>
Undaunted by the fact that Taiwan's bid for observer status in
the WHA has remained unsuccessful for the past 10 years,
President Chen Shui-bian decided this year to push for Taiwan's
application to join the WHO as a full member under the name of
"Taiwan."
</P>
<P>
As a matter of strategy, Taiwan is adopting a three-pronged
approach this year to facilitate its bid to join the world health
regulatory body, specifically continuing to seek observer status
in the WHA, continuing to seek meaningful participation in WHO
technical meetings and applying for full membership of the WHO
under the name "Taiwan."
</P>
<P>
Yang said that although  the WHO Secretariat  has already
unequivocally turned down Taiwan's request for admission into the
WHO as a full member under the name of "Taiwan" on the grounds
that Taiwan is not a sovereign state, 12 of Taiwan's diplomatic
allies have also written to Chan on behalf of Taiwan, asking that
Taiwan's WHO membership application be included on the agenda of
this year's WHA, slated to open May 14, with a letter that
President Chen wrote to Chan attached to their letters as a
reference.
</P>
<P>
Yang said that if the WHO Secretariat continues to turn a deaf
ear to these requests, representatives of these allies will
challenge the Secretariat May 14 by raising motions for Taiwan's
cause.
</P>
<P>
The issue of inviting Taiwan to join the WHA as an observer is
expected to be discussed during the proceedings of the WHA,
according to Yang.
</P>
<P>
Both Hou and Yang said China will not relent in its obstruction
of Taiwan's WHO bid and this year is no exception. However, they
did not elaborate on Taiwan's countermeasures.
</P>
<P>
During a videoconference held Friday, Chen said he has written
Chan three times to insist  that the WHO deal with Taiwan's
application according to due process, although his request was
rejected by the WHO Secretariat on each occasion, on the grounds
that Taiwan is not a sovereign state.
