The Council for Economic Planning and Development (CEPD) is
seeking to collaborate with the private sector to open computer
training workshops for female citizens aged over 50 in the hope
that some 13,000 of this group will become computer literate
within six months.
</P>
<P>
CEPD officials said the government will foot the bill to enable
10 private companies or organizations to sponsor the workshops.
</P>
<P>
It is an ambition of the CEPD to help narrow the digital divide
between male and female citizens aged over 50 to under 10
percent, CEPD officials said.
</P>
<P>
CEPD officials quoted the results of a 2006 survey on the
individual/household digital divide conducted by the Research,
Development and Evaluation Commission as indicating that the
Internet penetration rate among female citizens aged over 50 was
roughly 10 percent lower than that of male citizens in the same
age group.
</P>
<P>
The digital divide between female and male citizens aged between
21 and 50 was 2 percent, according to the same survey, the
officials said.
</P>
<P>
The wide digital gap unfavorable to older females is an issue
that cannot be addressed under the government's existing efforts
to narrow the digital gap between cities and rural areas, the
officials noted.
</P>
<P>
The planned workshops are envisaged to enable female citizens
aged over 50 -- most of whom have focused their time and energy
on their homes -- to surf the Internet so that they can share
information and knowledge via Web portals and even craft their
own careers through the Internet, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
They noted that 61 digital  opportunity  centers  are now
operational islandwide and said it is expected that another 62
will be established this year under a sub-plan included in the
2015 Economic Development Project.
</P>
<P>
The officials added that age and gender differences are major
factors determining the character of the digital divide, although
other  factors, including  personal  incomes  and  educational
backgrounds, also play decisive roles in Internet penetration
rates.
