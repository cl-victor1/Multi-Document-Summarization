A group of students at a Taipei school has developed a new low-
cost electronic "drowning saver" system that can detect the
status of swimmers and automatically notify the lifeguard in
possible drowning scenarios, school sources reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The system, invented by four students at Kai Nan High School of
Commerce and Industry -- Ma Ming-che, Lin Chia-he, Ke Kai-yuen
and Yu Po-wei -- combines a set of detection and notification
devices that must be carried by swimmers and a positioning array
set around the pool or the sea area.
</P>
<P>
The students said the devices can detect the position of a
swimmer's face and that should the face stay under the water
surface longer than a preset time, the device will deploy a life
buoy around the user's waist, as well as transmit an alert to a
control center.
</P>
<P>
"If that happens, " they continued, "the lifeguard can start
searching, using the positioning array to determine the location
of the drowning person."
</P>
<P>
They said that the cost for the whole system is about NT$100,000
(US$2,995), while the individual devices worn by the swimmers
cost no more than NT$500 each.
