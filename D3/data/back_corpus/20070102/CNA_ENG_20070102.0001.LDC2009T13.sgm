IMMIGRATION OFFICIAL DEFENDS PLANNED BIOMETRICS AUTHENTICATION
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

Taipei, Jan. 1 (CNA) 01/02/07  10:31:23 (By Sofia Wu)
</P>
<P>
The planned installation of a new biometrics authentication
system at the country's main gateways or airports will by no
means infringe upon any incoming visitor's human rights, an
immigration official said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Wu Hsueh-yen, deputy director of the Bureau of Immigration, was
responding to a newspaper report that questioned the propriety of
the government's plan to subject all Chinese visitors to facial
pattern sensing during immigration inspection.
</P>
<P>
According to Wu, the immigration bureau -- which will be upgraded
into an agency and placed under direct jurisdiction of the
Ministry of the Interior Tuesday -- indeed plans to install a new
biometrics system in the country's major international airports
July 1.
</P>
<P>
The new system, developed by a German company, will operate in
line with regulations set forth by the International Civil
Aviation Organization (ICAO) and will therefore in no way violate
anyone's human rights through its operations.
</P>
<P>
Although the ICAO regulations  allow for the use of iris
recognition technology, Wu said, the immigration bureau will not
include that part of authentication.
</P>
<P>
"Our biometrics system will neither include iris recognition nor
touch on controversial fingerprint or DNA authentication, which
may cause human rights disputes, " Wu explained, adding that the
new system to be installed at immigration inspection counters
will need only three seconds to sense each incoming visitor's
facial pattern.
</P>
<P>
The new system, comprising 22 sensing devices plus databanks,
carries a price tag of NT$27 million, Wu said, adding that the
system's authentication rate could reach 97 percent.
</P>
<P>
"As it takes only three seconds to sense a visitor's facial
pattern, its operation will not impact normal immigration
inspection proceedings, " Wu said, adding that if any illegal
immigrant is spotted by this facial pattern sensing device, he or
she will be repatriated via the same plane that carried him or
her to Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
At the moment, Wu said the bureau only plans to have Chinese
tourists subjected to facial pattern authentication. Chinese
citizens intending to come to Taiwan for family reunions, long-
term stay or permanent settlement will continue to be required to
have their fingerprints taken upon arrival.
</P>
<P>
The facial pattern sensing system will be gradually expanded to
incoming foreign visitors in the future, Wu added.
