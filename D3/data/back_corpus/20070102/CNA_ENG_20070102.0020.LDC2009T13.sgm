Japanese is the most popular foreign language elective course
among Taiwan high school students after the required subject of
English, according to statistics released Tuesday by the Ministry
of Education (MOE).
</P>
<P>
In the first semester of the 2006 academic year, optional courses
were offered in seven different foreign languages -- Japanese,
French, German, Spanish, Korean, Latin and Russian -- in high
schools around the country, attracting more than 26,000 learners.
</P>
<P>
Around 20,500 of the students chose to study Japanese, making it
the most popular second foreign language in high schools,
followed by French, which attracted over 3,500 students, the
statistics showed.
</P>
<P>
Among 159 high schools that have second foreign language courses,
only Taipei Municipal Chien-Kuo Senior High School and Taipei
First Girls High School (TFGHS) opened courses in Latin.
</P>
<P>
Asked why Latin was chosen, TFGHS Principal Chou Yun-wei said
many of their teachers consider the ancient language to be a
useful foundation for learning other Western languages.
</P>
<P>
Taipei's Chengyuan High School offers the only Russian class,
drawing the enrollment of 25 students.  School Principal Chen
Shih-chang said the course was set up in response to the demand
of their students, and has existed since the 2004 academic year.
