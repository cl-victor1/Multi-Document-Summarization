Taipei,  Jan.  2 (CNA) 01/02/07  20:18:08 (By Flor Wang)

Premier Su Tseng-chang presided over the inauguration of the
upgraded National Immigration Agency (NIA) Tuesday and urged the
new institution to work out comprehensive auxiliary measures to
help new immigrants integrate into local society and protect
their rights and interests.
</P>
<P>
Noting that Taiwan is allowing entry of an ever-growing number of
immigrants due to the increased number of intermarriages between
Taiwan nationals and foreign spouses, Su pointed out that foreign
husbands and wives are also members of local society and that the
government needs to listen to their voices and boost their human
rights.
</P>
<P>
Su encouraged the NIA -- upgraded from the Bureau of Immigration
under the Ministry of the Interior -- to be visionary and open-
minded in making Taiwan a healthier society in which new
immigrants can swiftly blend in with local people.
</P>
<P>
According to the premier, one out of every five new marriages in
Taiwan comprises a foreign national and one in every eight babies
is born to a foreign wife.

Minister of the Interior Lee Yi-yang, Mainland Affairs Council
Chairman Joseph Wu,  Coast Guard Administration  Minister Wang
Ching-wang, Minister without Portfolio Wu Feng-shan, Government
Information Office Minister Cheng Wen-tsang and New Zealand
Commerce and Industry Office Representative Clare Fearnley also
witnessed the ceremony held at the NIA headquarters.
</P>
<P>
In line with the NIA inauguration in Taipei, branches offices in
all 25 cities and counties around the country also opened on the
same day, including one on outlying Kinmen Island.
</P>
<P>
The Kinmen branch at the port of Shuitou will be in charge of
inbound and outbound immigration affairs, checking of passenger
documents and inspection for unlawful objects, as well as the
detention of illegal immigrants and the scrutiny of international
charter flight services -- the NIA's sole local unit nationwide
that will be responsible for immigration issues through air,
shipping and land travel links, an NIA Kinmen branch official
said.
</P>
<P>
Since the inception of the "mini three links" -- direct trade and
shipping services maintained between Taiwan-held Kinmen and Matsu
islands and Xiamen and Mawei ports in China's Fujian Province --
in Jan. 2001, the number of passengers using the routes has
jumped to a total of over 623,000 last year from some 21,000 in
the first year.
</P>
<P>
The travel volume on the mini three links is set to further
increase with more opening measures expected across the Taiwan
Strait, the official predicted, pointing out that the Kinmen
branch, which has additional manpower, will be able to handle
more business, thanks to the agency's upgrading.
