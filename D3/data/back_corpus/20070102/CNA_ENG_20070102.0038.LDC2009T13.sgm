Taipei, Jan. 2 (CNA) 01/02/07  21:23:48 (By Y.C. Jou)

<P>
Taiwan's state-run Chinese Petroleum Corp. (CPC) announced
Tuesday a NT$0.4-per- liter price drop for gasoline and a NT$0.3
drop for diesel from midnight Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
With the adjustment, the price of 92 octane unleaded will drop to
NT$26.5 per liter, with 95 octane unleaded priced at NT$27.2 and
98 octane unleaded at NT$28.7.
</P>
<P>
The prices of super and regular diesel will be down to NT$23.4
and NT$22.9 per liter, respectively. Bunker oil will be down
NT$300 per kiloliter to NT$16,193 per kiloliter, while fuel oil
prices will remain the same.
</P>
<P>
International oil prices are falling due to expectations that a
warmer winter in the United States will lower the demand for
heating oil.
</P>
<P>
The CPC last September  introduced  a floating oil-pricing
mechanism on a trial basis. The new system, designed to better
reflect international crude oil price fluctuations, was put into
formal implementation immediately after the New Year.
