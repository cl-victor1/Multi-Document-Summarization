PREMIER PINS HOPE ON KMT HEAD FOR INTER-PARTY RECONCILIATION
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  Jan.  2 (CNA) 01/02/07  20:27:07 (By Flor Wang)
</P>
<P>
In response to a local media report that main opposition
Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Ma Ying-jeou has recently shown
willingness to reconcile with the ruling Democratic Progressive
Party (DPP) , Premier Su Tseng-chang said Tuesday that he hopes
Ma will back his words with action.
</P>
<P>
Su made the remarks in response to questions from reporters over
the issue after the China Times reported that Ma, in a recent KMT
Central Standing Committee weekly meeting, said that there is no
question of a "life or death" struggle between the opposition and
ruling parties since Taiwan's people are all in the same boat.
</P>
<P>
Expressing hope that Ma will live up to his words as the new year
has begun, Su said that Ma's "different attitude" should help
resolve major disputes, as well as assist long-stalled and urgent
issues, such as a major military procurement bill and the
screening of a presidential nomination list of Control Yuan
members, in clearing the Legislative Yuan.
</P>
<P>
Asked whether he would like to meet Ma to discuss issues of
mutual concern, Su said that it would be more appropriate for the
two parties' leaders to talk over relevant issues if necessary.
</P>
<P>
Yeh Yi-jin, a DPP legislative caucus whip, voiced her desire that
"Ma really means it" in terms of stepping up KMT-DPP cooperation
to help resolve problems facing the country for the sake of
Taiwan's democracy and the people's well- being.
</P>
<P>
Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng, who is a KMT stalwart,
said that what the media described as "Ma's new stance, " would
be extremely useful.
</P>
<P>
According to Wang, it would mean that several critical bills and
key issues would be more likely to be approved by the Legislative
Yuan,  along with an easing in the confrontation between the
opposition "pan-blue alliance" and the "pan-green camp" of the
DPP and its alley, the Taiwan Solidarity Union.
</P>
<P>
If the two camps are really  willing  to compromise  and
collaborate, it would be in the nation's best interest and would
be greatly conducive to boosting the people's well-being and
benefits, he said.
