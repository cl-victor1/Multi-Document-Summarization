<P>
Fifty-seven schools in Nantou County joined more than 300 other
schools around Taiwan as "health-promoting schools" Tuesday after
they passed an evaluation conducted by the Ministry of Education
and the Cabinet-level Department of Health.
</P>
<P>
The schools are some of 64 schools in Nantou County that applied
last year to become health-promoting schools.
</P>
<P>
Nantou County Magistrate Lee Chao-chin presented certificates of
their health- promoting school status to the principals of the 57
schools on behalf of the education authorities.
</P>
<P>
Lee said at the presentation ceremony that the county government
will continue its campaign to turn all remaining schools in the
county into health-promoting schools by 2008.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that certified schools will not let their students
become smokers or betel nut chewers, in addition to other
measures conducive to the creation of a good learning
environment.
</P>
<P>
The concept of health-promoting schools first appeared in the
early 1980s. It involves all members of a school participating in
health measures related to the curricula and other school
activities.
</P>
<P>
A set of guidelines issued by the World Health Organization in
1996 for the development of health-promoting schools identified
six areas for promotional efforts: school health policies, the
physical environment of the school, the school's social
environment, community relationships, personal health skills and
school health services.
