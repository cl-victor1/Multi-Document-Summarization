Taipei,  Jan.  2 (CNA) 01/02/07  16:59:22 (By Y.F. Low)

<P>
Taiwan is planning to hold a meeting of energy and environment
ministers with its South Pacific allies this year after the
success of a similar meeting held last year with the country's
Central American allies, a Ministry of Foreign Affairs official
said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Yu Teh-sheng,  deputy  director-general  of the  ministry's
Department of East Asian and Pacific Affairs, said the next
meeting will be aimed at helping South Pacific allies resolve the
problems of global warming and garbage disposal, in light of the
limited resources owned by these countries.
</P>
<P>
Yu noted that in recent years, the focus of Taiwan's aid to
foreign countries has shifted from assisting them with
infrastructure development to improving the life of locals, in
hopes the aid would meet the substantial needs of the people.
</P>
<P>
Toward this goal, the government has reviewed its foreign aid
projects based on conclusions reached during the first leadership
summit between Taiwan and its South Pacific allies in September
last year, Yu said.
</P>
<P>
According to Yu, the mobile medical mission and the digital
divide narrowing project promoted by Taiwan in its South Pacific
allies have been effective in improving their medical services
and communication facilities, and are greatly welcomed by the
local population.
