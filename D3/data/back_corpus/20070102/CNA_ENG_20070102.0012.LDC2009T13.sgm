CHEN-SU TIES IN GOOD SHAPE: DPP CHAIRMAN
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taipei,  Jan.  2 (CNA) 01/02/07  16:18:07 (By Luis Huang)
</P>
<P>
Ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) Chairman  Yu Shyi-kun
called on the public to refrain  from exaggerating any
disagreement between President Chen Shui-bian and Premier Su
Tseng-chang on the government's cross-Taiwan Strait policies,
saying that relations between Chen and Su are in good shape.
</P>
<P>
Yu made the appeal during an interview with reporters after
walking from the DPP headquarters to a nearby convenience store
to pay his party membership fees.
</P>
<P>
Chen mentioned twice in his New Year's Day address that there is
absolutely no so-called "Su revisionist line, " rebutting
speculation that the premier has launched a new course deviating
from the president's "active management, effective opening"
policy in dealing with China.
</P>
<P>
Lawmakers from the opposition "pan-blue alliance" led by the
Kuomintang interpreted the president's words as a signal that the
premier will step down soon.
</P>
<P>
In response, Yu, a former premier, said that powers concerning
national defense, diplomacy and cross-strait relations are
conferred on the president by the Constitution, with related
policies announced to the public by the Executive Yuan after
approval by the National Security Council and the head of state.
</P>
<P>
As for the opposition  camp's intention to undermine  the
solidarity  among DPP members by distorting Chen's remarks on
cross-strait policies in his New Year Message, Yu stressed that
"we will not be divided."
</P>
<P>
Touching on Chen's remarks that he is willing to shorten his term
so that the next presidential election can be held simultaneously
with the legislative elections, Yu said the president's position
is based on considerations of what is best for Taiwan's
democratic development and social progress.
</P>
<P>
Yu said that the DPP leadership will continue to strengthen
communications  with the party's legislators  and officials of
different levels on the issue.
</P>
<P>
Yu proposed recently that the next presidential and legislative
elections be held together on Jan. 19 as a measure to promote
social harmony and to cut costs, but the recommendation has been
met with strong opposition from some DPP lawmakers.
