Taipei,  Jan. 2 (CNA) 01/02/07  20:27:04 (By Y.F. Low)
</P>
<P>
The Center for Disease Control (CDC) warned Tuesday of possible
soaring mass flu infections at schools this winter in light of
the late start of the winter vacation.
</P>
<P>
According to CDC tallies, five cases of mass flu infections have
been reported at various levels of schools over the past two
weeks.
</P>
<P>
In the past week, 1.26 percent of children at kindergartens or
elementary schools have come down with the infection, which is
twice to three times the figure recorded during the same period
of last year, the tallies show.
</P>
<P>
CDC Deputy Director-General Shih Wen-yi expressed concern that
the situation could worsen as this year's winter vacation will
start one week later than usual, increasing the chance of mass
infections.
</P>
<P>
Shih pointed out that students are at high risk of catching flu
because poor classroom ventilation and close contact with their
classmates make excellent conditions for a quick spread of flu
virus.
</P>
<P>
Past experience indicates that the occurrences of mass infections
reduces as soon as winter vacation starts, Shih said.
</P>
<P>
CDC officials said the number of flu cases reported in the
country has been increasing for five consecutive weeks and is
expected to reach its peak in the next two to three weeks, adding
that the outbreak is not expected to slow down until mid-
February.
