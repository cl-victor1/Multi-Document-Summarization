With eight days to go before the inauguration of Nicaraguan
President-elect Daniel Ortega Saavedra, the Ministry of Foreign
Affairs refused to reveal Tuesday whether President Chen Shui-
bian will attend the Oct. 10 inauguration in Managua.
</P>
<P>
Wang Chien-yeh, the spokesman for the ministry, refused to be
pinned down on the question of whether Chen will go to Managua in
person or send an envoy in his place, saying only that his
ministry is working out the arrangements, including the states
where the Taiwan official to the inauguration will make transit
stops while traveling to and from Managua.
</P>
<P>
"We won't disclose our plan until everything is settled, " Wang
said, adding that showing Taiwan's hand too early might invoke
unexpected trouble in light of Beijing's all-out attempts to
stymie Taipei's diplomatic reach out.
