Taipei, March 30 (CNA) 03/30/07  22:49:27 (By Lilian Wu)

Minister of Economic Affairs Steve R.L. Chen said Friday that the
ministry will crack down on illicit stockpiling of gravel amid
reports that domestic gravel prices could surge soon.
</P>
<P>
Chen noted that the ministry has estimated that supplies will be
sufficient for the construction sector with contingency measures
and alternative import sources other than China, which announced
a ban on gravel exports March 1, although it said it would have
separate consultations with Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macau on the
issue.
</P>
<P>
The ministry will learn via the Fair Trade Commission if there is
any illicit stockpiling going on and if so, will deal with
offenders according to the law.
</P>
<P>
Chen noted that the Mainland Affairs Council has designated the
Taiwan External Trade Development Council to consult with China
on the issue, although he added that the talks have made no
progress.
</P>
<P>
Economic officials said recently they estimate local demand for
gravel will be 67.86 million cubic meters this year, while the
supply will be 69.93 million cubic meters.
</P>
<P>
As Taiwan's gravel stockpile will only last until the end of
April if China has not resumed exports to Taiwan by then, the
officials said the ministry will activate its contingency
mechanism by taking several steps, including increasing gravel
mining at home as well as importing 3 million cubic meters of
gravel from the Philippines.
