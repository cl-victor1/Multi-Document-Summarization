PREMIER REAFFIRMS TAIWAN'S STATUS QUO
</HEADLINE>

Taipei, March 30 (CNA) 03/30/07  18:58:31 (By Maubo Chang)

Premier Su Tseng-chang cautiously walked a political  tightrope
between the island's pro-independence  and pro-union forces at
the legislature Friday by reaffirming Taiwan's political status
quo.
</P>
<P>
Su, who is one of four favorites vying for the chance to run for
president on the DPP ticket, told the legislature that Taiwan is
an independent state with fully sovereignty under the name of the
Republic of China.
</P>
<P>
He made the comment in a response to an opposition lawmaker who
attempted to pin the premier down on whether or not he supports
Taiwan's independence.
</P>
<P>
However,  the premier said he does support President Chen Shui-
bian's call for writing a new constitution because the current
one is quite confusing.
</P>
<P>
Although Su echoed Chen's call for a relevant, and suitable
constitution, he refused to tip his hand on the question of
whether he prefers a change in the system of government, which is
currently a hybrid of the presidential and parliamentary systems,
to a thoroughly parliamentary one.
</P>
<P>
Calling the current administration a dual-leader system with the
president as the head of the state, and the premier the head of
the executive branch, Su said, he is in no position to discuss
his individual preference in light of the fact that he is both
the premier appointed by the president and an aspirant for
presidency in the upcoming election.
</P>
<P>
Instead of committing himself on the issue, the presidential
hopeful said there are many hitches in the current constitution,
and much discussion is needed before crafting a new constitution
to address them, adding that any change to the current government
system should have the consent of the people.
</P>
<P>
He stalled on the question of whether he would name an opposition
member to serve as the premier if he is elected president, saying
only that it is a possibility he wouldn't ruled out in order to
optimize the efficiency of the administration and promote the
reconciliation between the different parties.
