Taipei,  March 30 (CNA) 03/30/07  20:37:44 (By Ruth Wang)

A Taipei City Hospital's doctor suggested Friday including a
foreskin removal operation in AIDS prevention policies because
the procedure lowers infection rates by 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
Wang Yung-wei,  director of the hospital's  Department  of
Infectious Disease Control, made the suggestion at an activity
hosted by the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) to discuss
preventative measures and celebrate a decade of success in the
application of a drug cocktail treatment of AIDS.
</P>
<P>
Wang suggested that the simple circumcision operation be included
among measures to reduce the spread of HIV-AIDS.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on the same occasion, a CDC spokesman pointed out Taiwan
spent NT$1.17 billion (US$35.3 million) through health insurance
expenditures to fund a cocktail treatment that has been proven to
extend the lives of patients.
</P>
<P>
Patients who did not take cocktail therapy died, on average, six
months to two years after diagnosis, while those who underwent
the therapy tended to live, on average, another 21.5 years, the
spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
David Ho, inventor of the cocktail therapy and an international
AIDS treatment authority, was also present at the activity, the
spokesman said, adding that Wang's suggestion is in agreement
with Ho's observation that research in Europe, America and Africa
shows circumcision helps cut the rate of HIV infection.
