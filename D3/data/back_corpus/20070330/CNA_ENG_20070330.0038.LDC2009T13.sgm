`PAN-BLUE' KAOHSIUNG COUNCILORS SUE MAYOR OVER REMOVING STATUE
</HEADLINE>

Kaohsiung,  March 30 (CNA) 03/30/07  21:46:45 (By Flor Wang)
</P>
<P>
A group of Kaohsiung city councilors belonging to the opposition
"pan-blue alliance" lodged a lawsuit Friday against Mayor Chen
Chu and municipal officials on charges of damaging public
property and illegal possession of public property.
</P>
<P>
Councilors of the main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) and its ally,
the People First Party (PFP) , filed the lawsuit with the
Kaohsiung Prosecutor's Office against Chen, Deputy Mayor Chiu
Tai-san and municipal Bureau of Cultural Affair chief Wang Zhi-
cheng on the grounds that the authorities tore down and removed a
statue of the late President Chiang Kai-shek at the city's
cultural center without the council's approval.
</P>
<P>
According to Huang Po-lin, the KMT's caucus whip at the Kaohsiung
City Council, the council has the authority to deal with public
property belonging to the city. But the Kaohsiung city government
failed to notify the council of its removal plan and to acquire
its permission before making the move.
</P>
<P>
Huang accused the city government of unlawfully tearing down the
statue owned by the city and "bestowing" it upon another,
violating articles 138 and 336 of the Criminal Code, as well as
Article 4 of the Anti-corruption Law.
</P>
<P>
The Kaohsiung city government decided March 13 during a municipal
meeting to pull down the statue at the city's Chiang Kai-shek
Cultural Center and to change the center's name, prompting a
protest from the opposition-controlled city council that the
municipal authorities failed to follow due process in carrying
out the task.
</P>
<P>
The statue was broken down into more than 200 pieces and
relocated to Tahsi township in northern Taoyuan County, where the
mausoleums of Chiang and his son, Chiang Ching-kuo, are located.
</P>
<P>
But the statue was so broken that township personnel have said it
will be extremely difficult to reconstruct it.
</P>
<P>
In response to the city council's legal action, municipal
Department of Information Director-General Hsiao Yu-jung said
that doing so will only increase tension and is not good for
helping to build harmony between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
Calling on the "pan-blue" councilors to calm down and not
"misinterpret the city government's good intentions, " Hsiao
insisted that the municipal authorities acted in accordance with
law.
