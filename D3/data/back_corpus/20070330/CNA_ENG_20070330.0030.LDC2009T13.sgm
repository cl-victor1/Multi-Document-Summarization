Two Taiwanese sailors, Hsu Wen-ho and Wang Heng-hsiang, long
detained by Russian border-guards returned to Taiwan March 29
with the help of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA), a MOFA
official said Friday.

<P>
Four Taiwanese sailors including Hsu and Wang, were among crew
members of the Indonesian fishing vessel, "ERICARISTINA",
detained by Russia since being apprehended for allegedly illegal
fishing in the Kamchatka Sea last August.
</P>
<P>
The shipping vessel was stranded outside the port during this
period of detention, where it was subject to cruel winter weather
and a lack of water, electricity and supplements. Some crew
members were in poor physical condition, the official said.
</P>
<P>
The MOFA asked the Fisheries Agency under the Council of
Agriculture to contact the shipowner in Taiwan to deal with the
problem and instructed Taiwan's Representative Office in Moscow
to offer urgent aid in ensuring that basic human rights were
respected by local authorities.
</P>
<P>
The official said office staff had visited the detained shipmen,
assisted them to receive medical treatment ashore, and provided
them with necessary supplies.
</P>
<P>
The  official  reminded  people  to contact  the MOFA  or
representative offices abroad for timely help if they confront
trouble overseas.
