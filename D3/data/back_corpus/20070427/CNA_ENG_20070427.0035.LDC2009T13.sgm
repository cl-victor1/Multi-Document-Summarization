Minister of Foreign Affairs James Huang said Friday that a summit
meeting between Taiwan and its African allies is scheduled to
take place in Taipei in September.
</P>
<P>
Huang made the remarks on the sidelines of a birdwatching trip
with ambassadors and representatives to Taiwan in the scenic
Aowanda National Forest Recreation Area in central Taiwan's
Nantou County.
</P>
<P>
He said the theme of the summit will be to help Taiwan's allies
cope with the challenges of globalization. Issues to be discussed
at the summit meeting will include environmental protection,
biotourism, solar energy, medical care and health, and
agriculture.
</P>
<P>
He said the purpose of the summit is not to compete with China
for "dollar diplomacy, " noting that Taiwan cannot afford such
egregious spending, although it is able and willing to help its
allies cope with globalization.
</P>
<P>
China spent about US$20 billion when it hosted the Forum on
China-African Cooperation recently, according to Huang.
