Members of the opposition parties condemned  Friday  the
Democratic Progressive  Party  (DPP) administration's rejection
of Beijing's proposed route for the 2008 Olympic torch relay,
saying that the government is unilaterally barring the Olympic
torch from passing through Taiwan for ideological reasons.
</P>
<P>
Hsu Shao-ping,  a whip of the opposition Kuomintang (KMT)
legislative caucus, said that Taiwan has been concerned that it
is increasingly being marginalized in the international
community. Nevertheless, she continued, rejecting the passage of
the 2008 Olympic torch through Taiwan for political reasons will
only do Taiwan a disservice by seriously damaging the country's
image in the international community.
</P>
<P>
Huang Chih-hsiung,  an Olympic  silver medalist-turned  KMT
legislator, expressed his concern that the rejection may cause
the International Olympic Committee (IOC) to punish Taiwan by
repealing Taiwan's membership in the IOC, consequently leaving
Taiwan athletes out of the Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
If that were to occur, Huang asserted, the DPP government should
take all the responsibility.
</P>
<P>
Premier Su Tseng-chang said Friday that Beijing's proposed route
for the 2008 Olympic torch relay is unacceptable to Taiwan,
adding that Taiwan's sovereign status should not be undermined
under any circumstances.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on China's plan that the Olympic torch would travel
from Vietnam's Ho Chi Minh City to Taipei and then continue on to
Hong Kong, Macau and several other Chinese cities before arriving
in the host city, Beijing, Su said at the Legislative Yuan that
Taiwan belongs to the International  Olympic Committee (IOC)  as
an independent sports entity and has taken part in Olympic
competitions on an equal footing for years.
</P>
<P>
Yang Jong-her, Minister of the National Council on Physical
Fitness and Sports, and Chinese Taipei Olympic Committee Chairman
Thomas W. Tsai also said shortly after the Beijing's announcement
Thursday that the torch relay route was unacceptable on the
grounds that Taiwan's  sovereign  status would be compromised  as
the Beijing-proposed torch relay route purposely includes Taipei
as part of the "domestic leg" of the relay.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the government officials' remarks, KMT Legislator
Yang Li-huan said that Taiwan should grasp every possible
opportunity to gain exposure on the world stage and that the
Olympic torch relay would provide Taiwan with an opportunity to
expand its tourism. "Taiwan should open itself to the world,
rather than shutting itself off," Yang added.
</P>
<P>
Kuo Su-chun, a deputy whip of the KMT legislative caucus,
suggested that a nationwide referendum be held to gauge the
Taiwan public's opinions on whether Taiwan should accept the
Beijing torch relay route or not.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Lee Hung-chun, a spokesman for the opposition People
First Party, attributed the DPP government's rejection of the
Beijing-proposed torch relay route to the DPP's preparation for
the 2008 presidential election.
</P>
<P>
Lee said he believes that in order to consolidate its support
base for the 2008 presidential election, the DPP must alienate
itself from the international community as well as China.
</P>
<P>
Lee said he wonders how the DPP will explain to the international
community the reasons for rejecting the Beijing-proposed Olympic
torch relay route.
</P>
<P>
The DPP government owes an explanation to the Taiwan public and
the world over this issue, Lee added.
</P>
<P>
He urged the government not to sacrifice Taiwan athletes' rights
on the world sports stage because of politics.
