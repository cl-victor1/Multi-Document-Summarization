Officials of the Cabinet-level Fair Trade Commission (FTC) said
Friday that they have formed an ad hoc group to investigate
whether there is any manipulation of commodity prices by traders
in local market.

The officials  made the announcement  after  media reports said
that prices of several daily necessities, including dairy
products,  imported meat, flour, soybean oil and feeds surged
recently.

The officials stressed that they will respect consumer prices
hikes if the situation was the result of fair competition or
under the normal market mechanism. Otherwise, the traders may be
found to have violated related regulations if they force up the
prices by manipulating the market.

The FTC will also regularly offer information  related to
consumer products and the market situation to the media in order
to clear up any doubts among the public regarding consumer
prices, the officials added.
