TAIWAN TO QUIT 2008 OLYMPICS IF CALLED 'TAIPEI, CHINA': PREMIER
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  April 21 (CNA) 04/27/07  18:59:41 (By Y.F. Low)

Premier Su Tseng-chang said Friday that Taiwan would not take
part in the 2008 Beijing Olympic Games if China insisted on
referring to the country as "Taipei, China, " instead of the more
commonly used "Chinese Taipei."
</P>
<P>
Su said the reference "Taipei,  China" would represent  a
downgrading of Taiwan's status as a sovereign country, a
situation which he said is totally unacceptable to the
government.
</P>
<P>
"Taiwan would never participate in the Games only to be dwarfed
and humiliated, " Su said during a question and answer session in
the Legislative Yuan.
</P>
<P>
The government has rejected China's offer to include the island
on the Olympic torch-relay route on the grounds that Beijing's
proposed route purposely downgrades Taiwan's status to that of a
local administrative region of China.
</P>
<P>
According to China's plan, the Olympic torch would travel from
Vietnam's Ho Chi Minh City to Taipei and then continue on to Hong
Kong, Macau and several other Chinese cities before arriving in
the host city, Beijing.
