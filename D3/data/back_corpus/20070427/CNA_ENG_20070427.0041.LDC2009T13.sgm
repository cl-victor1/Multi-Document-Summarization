The General Tests of English Language Proficiency (G-TELP) was
not included in the criteria for the promotion of civil servants,
an official of the Central Personnel Administration said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The official  made the announcement  to clarify  that the
information posted on the Web site of the G-TELP Co. -- the
agency of G-TELP tests -- concerning their inclusion in the
administration's list of promotional criteria is incorrect.
</P>
<P>
The official  said the G-TELP Co.  did not apply to the
administration  for inclusion  in the criteria,  nor did the
administration approve all applications submitted by language
test organizations.
</P>
<P>
The administration informed all language test organizations in
1996 that language tests following the Common European Framework
of Reference for Languages: Learning, teaching, assessment (CEF),
will be taken as qualified to examine the English proficiency of
civil servants, but governing authorities will have the final say
on whether or not they are adopted, the official stated.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore,  according to the official, the University of
California accused the American Life Learning Co. of introducing
the G-TELP into Taiwan without authorization, and its issuance of
certificates is an act of fraud.
</P>
<P>
The official said the administration has asked the Ministry of
Education and the Ministry of Economic Affairs to deal with the
issue of authorization on G-TELP in order to avoid future
disputes.
