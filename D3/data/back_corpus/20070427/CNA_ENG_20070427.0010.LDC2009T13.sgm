OLYMPIC TORCH RELAY ISSUE POSES TEST FOR TAIPEI, BEIJING, IOC

Taipei,  April 27 (CNA) 04/27/07  13:17:53 (By Sofia Wu)

Taiwan's snub of China's offer to include its capital city of
Taipei on the Olympic torch relay route for the 2008 Beijing
Olympic Games poses a test to the governments on both sides of
the Taiwan Strait and to the International Olympic Committee
(IOC), analysts said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Within hours of Beijing's announcement of what would be the
longest torch relay in Olympic history -- a 137,000-kilometer
route that would cross five continents and scale Mount Everest,
Taiwan rejected being included on the route.
</P>
<P>
According to Beijing's announcement, the Olympic torch would
arrive in Taipei from Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam before traveling
to China-controlled Hong Kong and Macau.
</P>
<P>
"It is something that Taiwan's government and people cannot
accept because the route is defined by Beijing as a domestic
route, which constitutes an attempt to downgrade our country's
sovereignty," Thomas W. Tsai, chairman of the Chinese Taipei
Olympic Committee (CTOC), said at a late night news conference.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on the same occasion, Yang Jong-her, minister of the
Cabinet-level National Council on Physical Fitness and Sports,
echoed Tsai's view, saying the arrangement announced by Beijing
downgrades Taiwan's status as an independent sovereign state
because Taipei is included as a leg on China's domestic route.
</P>
<P>
A senior official of the Mainland Affairs Council, which charts
Taiwan's policy toward China, also described Beijing's proposal
as the worst route. "Beijing was simply trying to belittle
Taiwan, " said the official who preferred anonymity.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan wanted the torch to come from a third country and leave
for another third country, the official said, adding that Hong
Kong is considered part of China and that Taiwan cannot accept
the relay through the former British colony back to Beijing.
</P>
<P>
It marked the first time since the Olympic torch relay was
inaugurated for the 1920 Brussels Olympic Games that an IOC
member has rejected being part of the torch relay.
</P>
<P>
CTOC Chairman Tsai said protests will be lodged with Beijing and
with the IOC. "An adjustment to the route is necessary," Tsai
said.
</P>
<P>
As the IOC has already approved the Beijing-proposed relay route,
analysts said, it's up to Beijing to resolve whether and how the
route will be changed. "The ball is in Beijing's court, " an
analyst said.
</P>
<P>
According to the analyst, Beijing could easily settle the issue
by agreeing to have the torch come to Taipei from Pyongyang,
North Korea before heading to Ho Chi Minh City.
</P>
<P>
Given Beijing's obstinate opposition of refusing to treat Taiwan
on an equal footing, the analyst said he is not optimistic about
the prospect of Beijing making any concession on this issue.
</P>
<P>
After announcing the torch relay route in Beijing Thursday
evening, Jiang Xiaoyu, executive vice president of the Beijing
Olympic organizing committee, repeatedly referred to Taipei, Hong
Kong and Macau as "overseas Chinese cities" and stressed that
they were not included as part of the relay's international
route.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan returned to the IOC in 1981 under the name of "Chinese
Taipei" after a 10-year hiatus following its ouster from the
United Nations in 1971.
</P>
<P>
Sports and political analysts reminded the Chinese Taipei Olympic
Committee that it should carefully handle subsequent issues
besides seeking a change to the torch relay route. It should not
overlook the possibility of being denied IOC membership following
its snub of the 2008 torch relay, they cautioned.
</P>
<P>
Sports minister Yang said that although Taiwan rejects the
planned arrival of the torch, Taiwan athletes will by no means be
absent from the Beijing Olympic Games to be held next summer.
Asked whether Taiwan would pull out of the games if Beijing were
again to deliberately make discriminatory moves to downgrade
Taiwan's status, Yang said he couldn't answer such hypothetical
questions.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the government's torch relay snub, Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) legislative whip Ker Chien-ming said he
is convinced that Taiwan is better off rejecting the offer since
the Olympic torch has become a "political torch."
</P>
<P>
In contrast, the main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) issued a
statement late Thursday night saying that politics should be kept
out of sports.
</P>
<P>
Taipei Mayor Hau Lung-bin, a KMT stalwart, said he feels deep
regret over the DPP administration's decision to refuse to allow
Taiwan to be part of the torch relay.
</P>
<P>
"I hope the government will change its mind and agree with the
inclusion of Taipei in the relay route, " Hau said, adding that
the government should not mix sports and politics, which he
claimed only damages Taiwan's international image and reputation.
</P>
<P>
Wu Ching-kuo, Taiwan's member in the International Olympic
Committee who is now in Beijing to attend IOC activities there,
also expressed "shock and regret" over Taiwan's rebuff, saying he
hopes remedies can still be worked out.
