Taipei, April 27 (CNA) 04/27/07  22:43:50 (By Han Nai-kuo)

<P>
Three presidential hopefuls of the ruling Democratic Progressive
Party (DPP) issued a joint statement Friday accusing their rival,
Premier Su Tseng-chang, of misusing government funds to aid his
campaign and turning the pary primary into an "unfair
competition."
</P>
<P>
Vice President Annette Lu, DPP Chairman Yu Shyh-kun and former
Premier Frank Hsieh issued the statement after the Chinese-
language United Daily News reported that Su has agreed to use
NT$26 billion (US$782 million)  to help Tainan City and Chiayi
County with construction projects.
</P>
<P>
In a rebuttal issued later in the day, Su termed the accusation
"the biggest insult" to him and claimed that he has attached
great importance to integrity throughout his career as a public
servant.
</P>
<P>
Su said the decision to allocate funds for the two local
governments was a continuation  of previous central government
policies.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the project to make a section of railway in
Tainan run underground was mapped out 14 years ago, while the
decision to establish an herbal science and technology park in
Chiayi County was finalized in 2003.
</P>
<P>
The premier said the nation has an election almost every year and
that Taiwan's construction and development cannot be put aside
just because an election is going to take place.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the vice president told reporters that she will
withdraw from the DPP primary if President Chen Shui-bian throws
his support behind any particular candidate.
</P>
<P>
Queried by reporters on which candidate would be his choice as
the DPP's nominee for the 2008 presidential election, Chen did
not answer directly, but replied -- apparently jokingly -- that
he only supports himself.
