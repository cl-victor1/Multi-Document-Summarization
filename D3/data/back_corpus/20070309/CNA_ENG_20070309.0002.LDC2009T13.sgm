Taipei, March 8 (CNA) 03/09/07  10:59:47 (By Sofia Wu)
</P>
<P>
The Association of Taiwan Journalists (ATJ) urged the government
Thursday to refrain from using any technical tactis to obstruct
freedom of the press.
</P>
<P>
The association made the call after a group of ruling Democratic
Progressive Party legislators asked the government to expel an
Associated Press (AP) reporter who quoted Beijing's derogatory
criticism of Vice President Annette Lu in a March 6 article about
her presidential bid.
</P>
<P>
ATJ Secretary-General Liu Kuei-lan said the government should
respect every foreign reporter dispatched to cover news in Taiwan
and respect their right to cover the news.
</P>
<P>
If the government uses technical tactics to hobble freedom of the
press, such as revoking the visa given to an individual foreign
correspondent, or expelling him or her as a person-non-grata, Liu
said Taiwan's image and the international community's perception
of Taiwan's freedom of the press could be at stake.
</P>
<P>
As to whether the AP reporter had violated any journalistic
professional rules, Liu said the AP should conduct an internal
probe and unveil the results of its investigation in line with
the journalistic community's self-disciplinary principles.
</P>
<P>
Min Lee, an AP correspondent from Hong Kong, drew the ire of Lu
and a large number of DPP supporters by citing Beijing's
reference to Lu as an "insane" splittist and the "scum of the
nation" in his report on Lu's campaign to become Taiwan's next
president.
</P>
<P>
Lee's article sparked a local political storm after it was posted
on the CNN Web site under the headline "Taiwan's 'scum of the
nation' runs for president."
