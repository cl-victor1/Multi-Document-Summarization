Taipei,   March  9  (CNA) 03/09/07  21:48:52 (By Flor Wang)

Lienchiang  County Magistrate Chen Hsueh-sheng, administrative
chief of the outlying island of Matsu, urged the Cabinet-level
Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) Friday to grant its approval to
allow Matsu to conduct sea disaster relief exercises in
cooperation with China.
</P>
<P>
Chen called on the MAC to place the highest degree of importance
to the issue in an effort to help reduce the frequency of
accidents in the Taiwan Strait.
</P>
<P>
Since the inception in 2001 of direct shipping services between
Taiwan's Kinmen and Matsu islands and the Xiamen and Mawei ports
in China's Fujian Province, commonly known as the "mini three
links, " the number of cross-strait accidents involving fishing
boats and cargo vessels has been on the rise, Chen said.
</P>
<P>
A proposal was put forward last year by the Lienching county
government on establishing a set of cross-strait drill mechanisms
aimed at honing skills in disaster relief at sea, but the MAC
rejected the proposal, he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
According to Chen, he has instructed the Matsu fire department to
re-submit to the MAC a cross-strait sea disaster aid exercise
project and provide details of the calamities that have occurred
in the area in recent years.
</P>
<P>
Chen expressed hope of being able to establish a sea disaster
relief platform free of national security concerns between the
two sides and promised to step up security and management
regulations on local ships plying the area.
