<P>
Former opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Ma Ying-jeou -- a
presidential hopeful -- pledged Friday that he will do his utmost
to curb oyster smuggling to Taiwan if he wins the 2008 election.
</P>
<P>
Ma signed a statement to declare the pledge during a visit to a
coastal area of Chiayi County in southern Taiwan -- where most of
Taiwan's oyster breeders are located -- to campaign for his
presidential bid.
</P>
<P>
On a visit to Tungshih Port, the former Taipei mayor expressed
concern with sales of local oysters after being told that oyster
sales recently experienced a plunge after the Consumer's
Foundation reported that some oysters in local markets are
contaminated with copper.
</P>
<P>
To express his recognition of the quality and safety of Tungshih
oysters, Ma sampled several raw and praised their freshness and
flavor.
</P>
<P>
Local oyster breeders have claimed that the contaminated products
are mostly smuggled from overseas to meet huge demand due to a
drop in local production caused by inclement weather.
