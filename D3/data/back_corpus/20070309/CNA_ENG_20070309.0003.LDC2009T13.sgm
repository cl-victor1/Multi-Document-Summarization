Taipei, March 8 (CNA) 03/09/07  11:00:39 (By Y.C. Jou)

President Chen Shui-bian said Thursday that the inappropriate
reference to Vice President Annette Lu by the Associated Press
(AP) and the Cable News Network (CNN) represented a serious
distortion of news events resulting from the media's practice of
adopting Beijing's perspective to maliciously criticize Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
No professional media in the world would cite Venezuelan
President Hugo Chavez's verbal attack on U.S. President George W.
Bush while referring to President Bush in news headlines, Chen
said in a speech delivered at a Ministry of Foreign Affairs
dinner attended by foreign ambassadors and envoys, including
American Institute in Taiwan (AIT) Taipei Office Director Stephen
Young.

<P>
Terming the incident "inconceivable, Chen said it "had evoked
people's righteous indignation over the injustice done to Lu."
</P>
<P>
He said the use ofvulgarandirresponsiblewords bytwo
internationally  renowned mediain  their reports  on Lu was
regrettable.
</P>
<P>
Chen reiterated that Taiwan and the People's Republic of China
are two separate sovereign countries that neither one belongs to
the other.Taiwan is Taiwan; China is China,he said.
</P>
<P>
Reporting Tuesday on Lu's candidacy registration with the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party for the party's primary for the 2008
presidential election, an AP story described Lu as anoutspoken
vice president whom China has calledinsaneandthe scum of the
nation.CNN posted the AP article on its Web site later that day
under the derogatory headline: Taiwan's 'scum of the nation' runs
for president.
</P>
<P>
The Presidential Office has filed protests with the two media and
demanded apology.
