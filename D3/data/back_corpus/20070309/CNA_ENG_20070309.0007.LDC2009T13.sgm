U.S. PACIFIC COMMAND NOMINEE PROMISES ENGAGEMENT WITH CHINA
</HEADLINE>

Washington,  March 8 (CNA) 03/09/07  13:48:22 (By Chiehyu Lin and

The admiral nominated to serve as the top U.S. military commander
in the Pacific said Thursday that if his nomination is confirmed,
he will pursue robust engagement with China to help defuse
tensions across the Taiwan Strait.
</P>
<P>
Navy Adm. Timothy Keating said during a confirmation hearing at
the Senate that if the U.S. military deals with some frequency at
several levels with the Chinese, holds exercises with them, and
ensures the Chinese are aware of its capabilities and intent,
this will go a long way toward diffusing tension across the
Taiwan Strait.
</P>
<P>
"If confirmed, I'd intend to pursue a series of robust engagement
with, principally, the People's Liberation Army of China, not
just in terms of frequency but in terms of complexity, " Keating
said at the hearing.
</P>
<P>
"We'd engage in exercises of some sophistication and frequency,
and we would pay close attention to the development of their
weapon systems and their capabilities with a weather eye on
whether they intend to use those against Taiwan," he further
said.
</P>
<P>
Sen. Carl Levin, a Democrat from Michigan and a ranking member of
the Senate Armed Forces Committee, asked Keating that given the
possibility of political or military miscalculation between China
and Taiwan, what role the U.S. military can play in trying to
reduce cross-strait tensions.
</P>
<P>
Keating answered that if he assumes the post, those relations and
sustaining the calm that appears to pervade today across the
Taiwan Strait will be a principal goal of his at the Pacific
Command.
</P>
<P>
In response to questions by Sen. John Warner (R-Va.) , who asked
Keating about his own view on the challenges involving cross-
Taiwan Strait relations and the U.S. policy toward the two
Chinas, Keating said that in dealing with the People's Republic
of China and with the government of Taiwan, "we would emphasize
that China has to be very careful in the development of offensive
weapons. We want to sustain Taiwan's  notion  of a defensive
front  from their military capabilities."
</P>
<P>
"We would encourage  increased  dialogue between those two
countries on an informal basis. And we're not unaware of the
burgeoning economic engine that is trade across the Taiwan
Strait, " he continued.
</P>
<P>
"So we would encourage all those positive signs. We will do our
best to make sure that both sides are aware of our close
observation of developments. And we would do our best to sustain
the harmony that does appear to be the situation across the
Taiwan Strait today, " Keating said.
