PROSECUTORS TO RENEW PUSH FOR FUGITIVE TYCOON'S REPATRIATION
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  March  9 (CNA) 03/09/07  11:43:56 (By Sofia Wu)
</P>
<P>
Excerpts from the 940-page indictment against a fugitive tycoon
will be translated into English for delivery to the United States
in a drive to bring to justice the wanted suspect, a Taipei
prosecutor said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Chuang Cheng, the head prosecutor in charge of the snowballing
Rebar Asia Pacific Group scandal, made the remarks after
indicting the group's founder Wang You-theng for a spate of
alleged financial crimes, including insider trading, embezzlement
of corporate funds, accounting fraud, and money laundering.
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors are seeking a 30-year prison sentence for Wang plus a
record high fine of NT$1.71 billion (US$52.13 million).
</P>
<P>
Wang, who fled Taiwan before investigations into the Rebar group
scandals began in January, has been held at an immigration
detention center outside Los Angeles since Feb. 2, pending a
decision by the U.S. immigration court on whether to deport him
back to Taiwan. Wang made his second appearance in immigration
court March 7.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan has tried in vain to persuade the U.S. government to
repatriate Wang so that the disgraced octogenarian can stand
trial for a series of crimes he has allegedly committed during
his long career.
</P>
<P>
In the wake of Wang's indictment, Chuang said the U.S. government
may reconsider Taiwan's request for Wang's repatriation as the
accusations against him have become more convincing.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, according to the indictment, Wang had led Rebar group
affiliates in engaging in large-scale money laundering over a
long period of time involving a sum well over NT$57 billion
(about US$1.73 billion).
</P>
<P>
An additional  US$147.05 million that the Wang family had
allegedly raked in through other criminal operations was also
listed in the indictment as evidence of the family's offshore
money laundering dealings.
</P>
<P>
Noting that money laundering has been a priority target in
international cooperation in fighting crime, Chuang said the
United States has been very sensitive to the risks of money
laundering since the 911 terrorist attacks in New York in 2001.
</P>
<P>
"If we can furnish U.S. authorities with evidence of Wang's
direct involvement in cross-border money laundering, it will be a
valuable bargaining chip to secure Wang's return, " Chuang said,
adding that the English excerpts to be sent to the United States
will focus on Wang's supposed leading role in the Rebar's money
laundering operations.
</P>
<P>
Also indicted in the case were Wang's wife -- Wang Chin She-ying,
his six children and a younger brother plus nearly 100 Rebar
group executives.
</P>
<P>
Wang and his wife, who fled to China shortly before the scandals
broke and later flew to the United States, were put on a most
wanted list Jan. 15.
</P>
<P>
They left the U.S. in late January for Myanmar via Singapore, but
were forced to go back to the United States after Singapore
denied them entry at Taiwan's request. While his wife, with a
valid U.S. passport, managed to enter the United States upon
arrival Feb. 2, Wang has since that time been held at an
immigration center in San Pedro in suburban Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
The Rebar scandals came to light in early January after the
group's China Rebar Co. and Chia Hsin Food and Synthetic Fiber
Co. applied for insolvency restructuring, triggering a run on the
Chinese Bank, another Rebar affiliate.
</P>
<P>
The Wangs allegedly embezzled billions of dollars in corporate
funds before going on the lam.
