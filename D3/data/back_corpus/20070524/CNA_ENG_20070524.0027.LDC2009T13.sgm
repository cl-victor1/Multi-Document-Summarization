Taipei,  May 24 (CNA) 05/24/07  18:11:35 (By Deborah Kuo)

<P>
Opposition Kuomintang (KMT) presidential candidate Ma Ying-jeou
appealed to the Democratic Progressive Party administration
Thursday to heed his suggestions to help rev up the country's
economy and "lift the citizens from a dire situation."
</P>
<P>
Ma suggested that the DPP administration open direct air links
across the Taiwan Strait, allow Chinese citizens to come to
Taiwan for sightseeing tours and normalize business and trade
relations with China.
</P>
<P>
Ma made the call during a ceremony held in Taipei to mark the
opening of a trade fair showcasing the car industry, real estate,
financial services and the beauty and cosmestics industry.
</P>
<P>
The former Taipei mayor and KMT chairman  said that many
industrial and business sectors in Taiwan have fallen into a dire
situation because of stagnation in the domestic economy over the
past seven years.
</P>
<P>
Per capita incomes in the United States, South Korea, Singapore
and Hong Kong have all increased remarkably over the past several
years, but Taiwan's per capita income has increased only
slightly, with the increase benefiting only the top 20 percent of
the richest people, Ma said.
</P>
<P>
The 20 percent at the poor end of the spectrum, however, have
witnessed drops in their incomes during the same period, he
added.
</P>
<P>
Ma urged the DPP administration to do something before it is too
late.
