The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) on Thursday urged people
planning to visit Japan to pay attention to the ongoing measles
outbreak in the Kanto region.
</P>
<P>
According to MOFA spokesman Wang Chien-yeh, the outbreak is
mainly occurring in Tokyo, with many universities suspending
classes until the end of this month.
</P>
<P>
As the outbreak is still under control, the MOFA has not upgraded
its travel alert on Japan, Wang said, adding that other
countries, such as the United States, the United Kingdom, France,
Canada and Australia, have not upgraded their travel alert on
Japan, either.

Wang said prospective travelers to Japan can visit the Center for
Disease Control's Web site at http: //flu.cdc.gov.tw/ for more
information about the measles outbreak.
