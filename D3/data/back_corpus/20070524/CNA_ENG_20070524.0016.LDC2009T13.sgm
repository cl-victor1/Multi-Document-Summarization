Taipei,  May 24 (CNA) 05/24/07  15:07:47 (By Y.F. Low)

The expected absence of several foreign affairs ministers from
the upcoming ministerial meeting between Taiwan and its Central
American allies will not affect the discussion of regional
issues, a Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) official said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
MOFA spokesman Wang Chien-yeh said the ministry has been informed
of the situation beforehand.
</P>
<P>
According to Wang, the ministers will not attend the meeting
because they have other scheduled meetings in Europe, and not
because they are avoiding the ministerial meeting on purpose.
</P>
<P>
The 13th Conference of the Mixed Commission of Cooperation
Between Central American Countries and the Republic of China
(Taiwan) is slated for May 25 in Belize. Taiwan's Minister of
Foreign Affairs James Huang departed for Belize Monday night to
attend the gathering.
</P>
<P>
However, only the foreign ministers of Belize and the Dominican
Republic are expected to attend the meeting, while those of
Panama, Costa Rica, Nicaragua, Guatemala and El Salvador will be
absent and will have their deputies attend on their behalf.
</P>
<P>
The situation has been interpreted by local media as a sign that
Taiwan's diplomatic relations with its Central American allies
might be weakening.
</P>
<P>
The meeting is a regular  annual event which takes place
alternately in Taiwan and one of its allies in the region.
