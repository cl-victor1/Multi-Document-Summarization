PROSECUTORS APPLY FOR DETENTION OF EX-MUSEUM CURATOR OVER SCANDAL
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  May 24 (CNA) 05/24/07  12:07:46 (By Sofia Wu)
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors have applied for detention of former National Palace
Museum curator Shih Shou-chien for further probes into a
suspected profiteering scandal involving a museum facelift
project, judicial sources said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The application was filed after long hours of questioning by
Bureau of Investigations agents and prosecutors that began
Wednesday and lasted into the wee hours of Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors are also seeking the detention of two other former
museum officials -- Hsueh Fei-yuan, a former chief secretary, and
Hsiao Chih-ming, a former clerk.
</P>
<P>
As of press time, the Taipei District Court had yet to mete out a
ruling  on whether  to have the trio detained  to facilitate
prosecutorial  investigations into corruption  and profiteering
charges.
</P>
<P>
Yeh chang-chi, a former general affairs department director of
the museum, and Chou Ching-lin, an acting section chief at the
museum, were released after questioning.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Wang Wen-lu, a former general affairs department head,
was released on NT$300,000 (US$9,009) bail after questioning, and
two other suspects -- Wang Shih-sheng, a former section chief,
and Sun Chao-feng, a clerk -- were released on NT$100,000 bail
each.
</P>
<P>
The interrogations of the former museum staff came a day after
local prosecutors led more than 60 investigators in searching
their offices and residences for evidence of suspected
irregularities.
</P>
<P>
At issue was a NT$385 million (US$11.53  million)  museum
renovation project that got underway in July 2004 and was not
fully completed until late last year.
</P>
<P>
Media reports said judicial authorities do not rule out the
possibility of summoning incumbent Education Minister Tu Cheng-
sheng for questioning because the facelift project was conceived
and drafted during Tu's stint as the museum's curator.
</P>
<P>
Opposition lawmakers have asked Tu to explain his role in the
case. However, Tu didn't give any response to the call. Instead,
his aide said Tu will respect judicial authorities'
investigations, and if subpoenaed, he will dutifully answer the
summon.
</P>
<P>
Tu's aide said the case has been under investigation for quite
some time. Given Tu's high-profile status and position, the aide
said he believes that it would have been revealed long ago if Tu
had been involved in any wrongdoing in the case.
</P>
<P>
In Tuesday's massive raid,  the offices and residences of
architect Luo Hsing- hua and other contractors were also
searched. A large collection of files and documents, including
the texts of a contract between the museum and Luo's company and
blueprints for the museum's face-lift projects, were seized in
the raid.  Prosecution authorities said the aid was launched only
after nearly two years of extensive investigations. Probes got
underway after law enforcement authorities received a written
petition.
</P>
<P>
Investigators  said  they  have scrutinized  many documents
concerning the open tender for the renovation project, contract
negotiations, meeting minutes and selection of qualified
contractors. Following comprehensive scrutiny, law enforcers said
they found suspected irregularities, including possible bribery
taking and favoritism.
</P>
<P>
After securing search warrants, prosecutors from Taipei's Shihlin
District Prosecutor's  Office  led agents from the Bureau of
Investigation in raiding more than 10 locations Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
According to prosecutors, the Palace Museum renovation project
was tainted by repeated cost overruns. The museum is home to one
of the largest collections of ancient Chinese art treasures in
the world.
