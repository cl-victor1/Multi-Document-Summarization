TAIWAN READY FOR OPENING TO CHINESE TOURISTS: MAC CHIEF
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taipei, May 24 (CNA) 05/24/07  19:26:14 (By Flor Wang)
</P>
<P>
Taiwan will immediately announce its opening to Chinese tourists
as soon as Beijing gets rid of its political considerations in
this regard and makes public its decision to allow Chinese
tourists to visit Taiwan, Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) Chairman
Chen Ming-tong said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Chen made the remarks while answering questions from lawmakers at
a legislative committee.
</P>
<P>
According to Chen, Taiwan and China have reached agreement on
technical issues concerning the issue during five rounds of
bilateral negotiations held during the tenure of former MAC
Chairman Joseph Wu.
</P>
<P>
Although a final agreement has yet to be announced, Chen went on,
the two sides have made a great deal of progress.
</P>
<P>
"So long as Beijing can surmount its political concerns and
clinch a pact with Taiwan, Taiwan will announce the opening at
once," Chen said.
</P>
<P>
In response to lawmakers' inquiries as to whether the Olympic
torch could be allowed to pass through Taiwan on a "city-to-city"
model, Chen replied that national sovereignty and dignity must
not be compromised and that the torch must enter from a "third
country" and leave for a "fourth country."
</P>
<P>
"Beijing can negotiate with Taiwan if it is truly sincere in
including Taiwan on its torch relay route, " Chen said, adding,
however, that his office had not received any information in this
regard to date.
</P>
<P>
Chen also underscored Taiwan's right to take part in the 2008
Olympic Games, saying that Beijing is not entitled to prevent
Taiwan from doing so.
</P>
<P>
"Should Beijing attempt to infringe upon Taiwan's national status
in the event, the government will come up with several packages
to counteract Beijing," Chen said.
