Taxpayers who have not yet submitted their income tax returns for
2006 can speed up the filing process by doing it through the
Internet, officials at the Taipei National Tax Administration
under the Ministry of Finance said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
With only seven days left until the May 31 deadline for filing,
the officials said that based on previous statistics, about 70
percent of the nation's taxpayers file their income tax returns
in the last five days.
</P>
<P>
They added that those who have not filed their tax returns should
consider doing it through the Internet, because they not only can
avoid the trouble of waiting in a long queue to submit the
papers, but also will be included in the first group to receive
their tax refunds by the end of July next year.
</P>
<P>
The officials noted that as of Thursday, more than half a million
taxpayers in the greater Taipei area had not yet filed.
</P>
<P>
Statistics compiled by the Ministry of Finance show that as of
May 22,  nearly 1.53 million people had filed their returns,
accounting for only about 30 percent of Taiwan's taxpayers. The
total included 1.02 million taxpayers who filed their returns
through the Internet. Compared with the corresponding period of
the previous year, the number of Internet filers had increased 27
percent.
