Statistics compiled by the Department of Industrial Technology
show that the automobile industry's first quarter output value
dropped 30 percent from the same period of last year to NT$65.87
billion (US$1.97 billion), with both the vehicle industry and the
parts and components industry showing declines.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the department's Industry and Technology
Intelligence Services quoted the statistics as showing that the
vehicle industry had an output value of NT$31.06 billion in the
first quarter, a fall of 39.3 percent on a year-on- year basis.
</P>
<P>
According to the spokesman, small and medium economy cars are
gradually becoming the market's mainstream products, with some
72.1 percent of the vehicle industry's output value coming from
small family cars and only 12.1 percent from large family cars.
</P>
<P>
The output value of the parts and components industry in the same
quarter was NT$34.8 billion, representing a smaller slide of 15.7
percent compared with the vehicle industry, thanks to support
from its export market in America, China, Japan and Canada, the
spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman added that with many small and medium economy cars
introduced into the market this quarter, the vehicle industry's
output value might be improved.
