The number of suicides in Kaohsiung has decreased, with 53 deaths
reported in the first quarter of this year, representing a drop
of 33.7 percent from the same period of 2006, according to
statistics released Thursday by the Kaohsiung Suicide Prevention
Center.
</P>
<P>
The figures serve as evidence that the center's efforts to
prevent suicide in the past year have achieved good results,
according to center officials.
</P>
<P>
The center's suicide-prevention program began in March 2006, but
its office was not formally established in a Kaohsiung hospital
until four months later.
</P>
<P>
It was set up by the Kaohsiung city government to strengthen the
volunteer work done by the 30-year-old private Kaohsiung Lifeline
Association after the city's suicide rates topped all other
cities and counties of Taiwan for three consecutive years from
2003 to 2005.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that Kaohsiung recorded a suicide rate of 16.48
deaths per 10,000 people in 2004. For 2005, the city recorded 324
suicides, representing a rate of 21.48 deaths per 10,000.
</P>
<P>
The number of suicides in Kaohsiung dropped again to 292 in 2006,
and the first quarter of this year saw 53 deaths, down from the
80 recorded over the same period of 2006.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Kaohsiung Lifeline Association indicated that its
volunteer workers receive more than 10,000 phone calls seeking
help each year, including hundreds by callers who had either
tried to commit suicide before, who had felt the urge to end
their lives right away, or who had already taken overdoses.
