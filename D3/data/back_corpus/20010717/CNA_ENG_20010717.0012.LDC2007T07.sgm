Taiwan has a national health insurance system that has become the envy
of the world, Premier Chang Chun-hsiung said during a visit to the
Department of Health Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
But the premier also said that the health department faces the
challenges of improving its finance management, adding that the public
has great expectations of the national health insurance system.

<P>
Chang instructed the health department to address the weak points in
the system, stem the waste of medical resources and map out a plan
that will take into consideration of both medical quality as well as
financial balance.
</P>
<P>
Chang also said that the health department must continue its efforts
to join the World Health Organization (WHO) as an observer despite
being denied such status for the last five years.

<P>
The premier asked the health department and other government agencies
to work out strategies to facilitate Taiwan's bid to participate in
the WHO.

The premier was positive about the health department's efforts in the
wake of the magnitude 7.3 earthquake in September 21, 1999 and other
natural disasters.

<P>
As the prevention of disease is crucial to public safety and the
overall economic development of the nation, the premier asked the
health department to continue to implement disease prevention and
quarantine procedures.
