DPP WISE ENOUGH TO HANDLE NEW RESOLUTION: LEGISLATIVE CAUCUS WHIP
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  May 11 (CNA) 05/11/07  22:03:52 (By Flor Wang) (By Flor

Ker Chien-ming, legislative caucus whip of the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) , said Friday that he believes the party
will wisely handle the issue regarding a proposal that the party
pass a new resolution on making Taiwan a normal country.
</P>
<P>
Ker made the comments while answering questions from reporters
after DPP Secretary-General Lin Chia-lung said a day earlier that
in promoting the goal of making Taiwan a normal country, a list
of names will be submitted to the party's Central Standing
Committee May 16 to form a task force in charge of drafting the
"normal country" resolution.
</P>
<P>
The new resolution is intended to replace the "Resolution on the
Future of Taiwan, " which states that Taiwan is a sovereign and
independent country and that any change to its status requires a
national referendum by its 23 million people.
</P>
<P>
The "Resolution on the Future of Taiwan" was incorporated into
the party's platform in 1999 in a bid to woo moderate voters
ahead of the 2000 presidential election.
</P>
<P>
Pointing out that a high degree of consensus must be built to
have the new resolution passed by the party congress, Ker said
that Chairman Yu Shyi-kun raised the proposition during the
campaign prior to the party's May 6 presidential primary vote.
</P>
<P>
Ker said that Yu's viewpoint must be fully respected if he feels
it is necessary to promote the stance, and expressed his belief
that the party will be able to properly deal with the issue. "I
personally do not have a set position regarding the issue," Ker
added.

Hung Chi-chang, a senior figure in the DPP's now defunct New Tide
fraction, said that the Resolution on the Future of Taiwan was
the consensus forged within the party before the 2000
presidential poll. But making Taiwan a normal country is a long-
term task that requires lengthy and complex constitutional re-
engineering, according to Hung.
</P>
<P>
Now, with former Premier Frank Hsieh the DPP's presidential
candidate,  it is necessary  to take  Hsieh's  opinions  into
consideration,  Hung said,  arguing that the issue cannot be
unilaterally decided by the party's headquarters.
</P>
<P>
DPP lawmaker Lee Chun-yee, widely seen as a protege of Hsieh,
said that it is a common desire of the Taiwan people to build a
normal country and establish sound systems of government. But Lee
quoted Hsieh as saying that the public has the final say on the
issue and that he supports holding a referendum to allow the
public to settle the issue through constitutional amendments.
</P>
<P>
"This is the people's right, and a long-term stance of the DPP, "
Lee said, adding that a new resolution on making Taiwan a normal
country must be based on mainstream public opinions on current
conditions and a consensus within the DPP concerning Taiwan's
future, Lee said.
</P>
<P>
"Party unity will be hobbled if the party central seeks to
replace the existing Resolution on the Future of Taiwan without
majority support within party ranks," he said. ENDITEM/jnc
