'GOOD TEAMMATE' TAIWAN SHOULD NOT BE LEFT OUT OF WHO: CIVIL
GROUPS
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taipei,  May  10  (CNA) 05/11/07  11:33:50 (By Chris Wang)
</P>
<P>
Taiwan has been described as a "good teammate" in the game of
world health, one which the world can not afford to lose, and
which does not deserve to be left out in the cold, civil groups
said Thursday in a press conference to announce an urban hike to
promote for Taiwan's application to enter the World Health
Organization (WHO).
</P>
<P>
Taiwan has been making a contribution to improving global health,
sending medical missions worldwide, and is always on the
frontlines in  providing international  emergency  relief  where
needed, representatives from various organizations said.
</P>
<P>
For example, Taiwan sent medical missions overseas during the
tsunami in South Asia, the earthquake in Indonesia, and to a
number of small countries in need, such as Tuvalu and Solomon
Islands. The International Cooperation and Development Fund
(ICDF) has been sending medical missions abroad since 1962, and
the Taiwan Nurses Association has been offering international
relief services for the past 20 years.
</P>
<P>
Despite the international community's awareness that "diseases
knows no boundaries, and there shouldn't be any gaps in the
international disease- prevention network, " Taiwan has been
unable to participate in the WHO since it withdrew from the
organization in 1972.
</P>
<P>
"The WHO was established with the goal of helping all peoples
attain the highest possible levels of health. However, the 23
million people of Taiwan were treated like orphans during the
SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) outbreak in 2003, " said
former health minister Lee Ming-liang.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan has had its WHO bids constantly rejected despite the fact
that, according to a public poll, 94.7 percent of Taiwanese
people support Taiwan's bid for membership in the WHO, and 111
legislators supported the latest bid.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan's membership bid has become an annual activity -- and
disappointment -- but supporters were jubilant over this year's
new tactics, which saw Taiwan apply to enter the WHO as a full
member rather than joining  the World Health Assembly  (WHA) ,
the decision-making body of the WHO, as an observer.
</P>
<P>
"Now we're bidding for full membership. Even though it is still
very difficult [to win approval] this year, we will be coming
back strong every year, " said Tsuang Ming-sion, superintendent
of Sin Lau Hospital. Tsuang will lead a group of 70 persons to
promote Taiwan's WHO bid in Geneva, where the WHA annual meeting
will be held from May 14.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan has obviously been excluded from the WHO for political
reasons, given that the nation's medical systems globally rank in
the top 30 percent, said Lee Tzu-yao, a veteran doctor who is a
member of the Foundation of Medical Professional Alliances in
Taiwan (FMPAT).
</P>
<P>
"We are human, not animals. The people of Taiwan should stand up
and speak for themselves," Lee stressed.
</P>
<P>
The hike "Be WHO! Taiwan, " jointly organized by the Taiwan
International Health  Action  (Taiwan  IHA)  and eight  other
organizations, will be held simultaneously in Taipei and
Kaohsiung May 12, with the expected number of participants pegged
at 20,000, said Taiwan IHA, an ad hoc inter-ministerial body
established in 2006 to integrate public and private resources for
Taiwan's international humanitarian and medical relief efforts.
