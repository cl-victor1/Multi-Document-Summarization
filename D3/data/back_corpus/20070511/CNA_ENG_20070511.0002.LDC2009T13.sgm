Vice President Annette Lu promoted Thursday the idea of training
100,000 nurses in senior health care to prepare for the needs of
an aging society in the near future.
</P>
<P>
Lu was attending a ceremony celebrating in advance International
Nurse Day which falls on May 12, when she introduced this idea in
association with a plan to create elder communities providing
comfortable housing for senior citizens.
</P>
<P>
Lu said Taiwan has 2.5 million people aged over 65, and it is
estimated that the country will have 7 million elderly citizens
in 40 to 50 years. As such, senior care is becoming a very
important issue, Lu added.
</P>
<P>
The government has already launched a "good housekeepers" program
training mothers to offer professional senior, child, and home
care, Lu said, adding that those who are already well trained in
senior care may serve as teachers for the proposed 100,000-strong
senior health care force.
</P>
<P>
National Union of Nurses' Association Chairwoman Yin Jeo-chen
requested that Lu help institute a pay raise for nurses, saying
that nurses deserve higher pay for working 65 hours a week, and
asserting that better remuneration and workplace welfare will
encourage more people to plunge into the nursing profession.
