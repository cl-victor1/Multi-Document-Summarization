TAIWAN'S WHO BID 'HAS NOTHING TO DO' WITH 'FOUR NOES': PRESIDENT
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taipei,  May 11 (CNA) 05/11/07  18:30:33 (By Y.F. Low)

President Chen Shui-bian said Friday that Taiwan's bid to become
a full member of the World Health Organization (WHO) "has nothing
to do" with his "four noes" commitments to the United States.
</P>
<P>
Chen pointed out that the "four noes" pledges are founded on the
precondition that "China has no intention of using force against
Taiwan, " but Beijing has so far refused to renounce its military
threat against Taiwan and is increasing the number of missiles
targeting Taiwan along its southeast coast.
</P>
<P>
Chen said the "four noes" have not affected Taiwan's efforts to
become a "normal country, " such as the enactment of the
Referendum Law in 2003 to make possible the first national
referendum held along with the March 2004 presidential election.
</P>
<P>
Chen made the remarks in response to a question during a
satellite video conference with international media
representatives posted in Geneva, an event held to promote the
country's application for WHO membership under the name "Taiwan"
for the first time this year.
</P>
<P>
In his 2000 and 2004 inauguration addresses, Chen pledged that if
China has no intention of using force against Taiwan, he will not
declare Taiwan independence, not change the official name of the
country, not include the "state-to-state" concept on cross-strait
relations in the Constitution, and not promote a referendum to
change the cross-strait status quo.
