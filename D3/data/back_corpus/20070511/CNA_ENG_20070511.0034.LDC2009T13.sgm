The 2007 Taipei Film Festival released a list of 31 nominees in
four categories ahead of one of the largest film festivals in
Taiwan at press conference Friday.
</P>
<P>
Notable nominees at the festival, which will be held from June 22
to July 9 in Taipei, include "I Don't Want to Sleep Alone,"
directed by internationally- renowned director Tsai Ming-liang,
"The Most Distant Course" and "Island Etude, " both of which were
earlier nominated in the International New Talent Competition.
</P>
<P>
Promising local young directors are also being recognized, with
Kao Bing-chuan having two films -- "The Soul of the Bread" and "A
Starry Silent Night" -- on the list of nominees. Awards fall into
four categories: best narrative films (12 films) , best
documentary films (6), best experimental films (6) and best
animated films (7).
</P>
<P>
Six documentary nominees, a genre which has been relatively
successful in recent years in Taiwan, touch on a wide range of
social topics,  including  beach preservation,  journalism  in
Taiwan, home-rebuilding in Jhongliao, Nantou after the massive
earthquake in 1999, and the Loshen Sanatorium, are also worth
watching, said organizers.
</P>
<P>
All nominated films will be screened during the 18-day festival,
one of the most important and high-profile international cultural
events in Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
The festival attracts not only everyday moviegoers, but also film
professionals. Of the approximately 100,000 attendees each year,
the majority is made up of a decidedly young audience.
