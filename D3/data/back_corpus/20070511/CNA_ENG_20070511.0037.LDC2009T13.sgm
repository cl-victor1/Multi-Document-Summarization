An Air Force F-5F jetfighter crashed Friday morning into an army
base used by Singaporean troops at Huko in Hsinchu County,
killing the pilot and co-pilot and two Singaporean troops on the
ground, according to Minister of National Defense Lee Jye.

Lee, who rushed to the scene from Taipei City upon being informed
of the accident, said nine other Singaporean soldiers on the
ground were wounded in the crash, one of whom suffered serious
burns and was taken to the Tri-Service General Hospital in
Taipei.

Chen Tien-mu, chief of the hospital's General Surgery Department,
said the 23 -year-old soldier, identified only by his surname of
Chou, would have to stay in the hospital for at least two weeks
and would need skin grafts.

In Singapore, a statement issued by the Defense Ministry there
said the plane crashed into a storeroom used by Singapore Armed
Forces (SAF) personnel stationed in Taiwan as part of the SAF's
"unilateral training" program.

Wu Chi-fang, a spokesman for Taiwan's Ministry of National
Defense, said earlier in the day that the two-seater plane, which
took off from Chihhang air base in Taitung, eastern Taiwan,
crashed at 9: 38 a.m. during a rehearsal for the Hang Kuang 23
military exercises.

<P>
The pilot and co-pilot who died in the crash were an instructor,
Maj. Wei Tzu- yuan and an intelligence officer, Capt. Chang Chia-
chun, the spokesman said.

The crash caused a fire at the barracks housing the SAF soldiers
undergoing training.

The air force, which had 66 F-5Fs, and F-5Es in 1974 when the
F-5E first went into service, grounded all 34 of the planes still
in service for safety inspections immediately after the accident.
</P>
<P>
The aircraft have been involved in 17 crashes in the last 19
years, killing 18 pilots, seriously injuring one and leaving four
unaccounted for, according to statistics provided by Legislator
Hsueh Ling.

Lee said the Hang Kung 23 exercises will go on as scheduled
despite the accident.
