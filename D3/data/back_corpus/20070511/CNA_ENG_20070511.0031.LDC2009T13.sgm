Taipei,  May  11 (CNA) 05/11/07  18:09:44 (By Deborah Kuo)

Staff from a Presbyterian hospital in Tainan,  southern Taiwan,
are scheduled to depart for Geneva, Switzerland, Friday to drum
up support for Taiwan's bid to join the World Health Organization
(WHO) as a full member under the name of "Taiwan."
</P>
<P>
Thirty-five members of Sin Lau Hospital of the Presbyterian
Church of Taiwan are planning to campaign on the banks of Lake
Geneva May 13 by distributing pamphlets to make known Taiwan's
intention to join the world health regulatory body, said Chuang
Ming-hsiung, president of the hospital.

<P>
It would be Sin Lau Hospital's third journey to Geneva in the
last three years to drum up support for Taiwan's WHO membership
bid at the WHO headquarters where the WHO annual assembly takes
place, Chuang said.
</P>
<P>
On May 14, the Sin Lau Hospital group will first gather in front
of the WHO assembly venue to sing for three consecutive hours to
make the will of Taiwan's people heard by the world.
</P>
<P>
Group members will then enter the WHO assembly venue in the
afternoon as visitors and observe the proceedings of the first
day of the WHO annual meeting.
</P>
<P>
Chuang said that there are about 200 visitor's seats in the
venue. Due to China's obstruction of Taiwan's WHO bid, which has
caused the Chinese authorities to assign "professional students"
to the venue every year to occupy the visitor's seats during the
WHO assembly period, the Sin Lau Hospital members will go to the
WHO headquarters early in the morning of May 14 to apply for
visitor's passes, he added.
