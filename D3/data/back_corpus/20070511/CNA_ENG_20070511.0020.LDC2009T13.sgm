</HEADLINE>

<P>
Taipei,  May 11 (CNA) 05/11/07  16:27:22 (By Y.F. Low)
</P>
<P>
The Legislative Yuan adopted a resolution Friday to show its firm
support for the country's bid to become a full member of the
World Health Organization (WHO).
</P>
<P>
The resolution was adopted ahead of the annual World Health
Assembly -- the WHO's decision-making arm -- slated to open May
14.
</P>
<P>
The resolution noted that because of China's suppression, Taiwan
has failed in its efforts to take part in the WHA as an observer
over the past 10 years.
</P>
<P>
It stated that Taiwan's application for membership in the WHO
this year is a part of the government's aim to uphold the health
and well-being, as well as the basic rights of its people, and to
contribute to the improvement of health internationally.
</P>
<P>
Before its official accession to the organization, the government
needs to continue to fight for international support for the
country's participation in WHO activities, the resolution said.
</P>
<P>
The results of a survey released in March by Taiwan Thinktank
indicated that as many as 94.9 percent of the respondents think
the country should apply for membership in the WHO.
</P>
<P>
President Chen Shui-bian officially made the request in a letter
to WHO Director-General Margaret Chan April 11, and again May 3.
