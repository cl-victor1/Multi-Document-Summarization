Taipei,  April 23 (CNA) 04/23/07  21:22:39 (By Deborah Kuo)

President Chen Shui-bian said Monday that the name "Taiwan" is
the best logo that the Taiwanese people have and that his name
"rectification" work will continue to help correct the wrongs of
past administrations.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to a group of visiting representatives of the World
Taiwanese Chambers of Commerce at the Presidential Office, Chen
said that insisting on a Taiwan- centric consciousness or a
"Taiwanese national identity" is now an "irreversible trend."
</P>
<P>
Saying that the right of the public to use the name "Taiwan"
should never be taken away, Chen said the word "Taiwan" is the
best, most beautiful and most powerful name that the Taiwanese
could ever have used.
</P>
<P>
In the past, due to some specious political reasons, the name of
"Taiwan" had been prohibited, resulting in identity disputes
among groups of different political affiliations, as well as
Taiwan's confinement in the international community, he said.
</P>
<P>
This mistake made by the previous Kuomintang administration has
been a source of agony for the entire Taiwan population, he
added.
</P>
<P>
The mistake, nevertheless,  should not remain unchanged or
unchallenged, the president went on.
</P>
<P>
Chen said the name-changing work will continue, now that the word
"Taiwan" is included on Republic of China passports, the name of
the Chiang Kai-shek International Airport has been changed to
Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport and Chunghwa Post Co. has
been changed to Taiwan Post Co.
</P>
<P>
In the near future, he said, the names of many other state-owned
enterprises will also be changed to carry the word "Taiwan, "
including  Chinese Petroleum Corp.  into Taiwan CPC and China
Shipbuilding Corp. into Taiwan International Shipbuilding Corp.
to make them more identifiable with their country of origin.
</P>
<P>
Chen called for the support of Taiwanese chambers of commerce
scattered around of world to the country's efforts to join the
World Health Organization and the United Nations as a full member
under the name of Taiwan.
