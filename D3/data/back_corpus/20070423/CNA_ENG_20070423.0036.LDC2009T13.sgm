PFP LAWMAKERS 'WILL' ATTEND COMMITTEE MEETING
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Taipei,  April 23 (CNA) 04/23/07  22:33:49 (By Flor Wang)
</P>
<P>
Lawmakers of the People First Party (PFP) will certainly attend
the Procedure Committee meeting Tuesday and help block passage of
two key draft bills of major concern to the main opposition
Kuomintang (KMT), a PFP lawmaker said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Legislator Hwang Yih-jiau, who also serves as the executive
director of the PFP's central policy center, gave his assurances
that PFP lawmakers will "definitely" take part in the meeting and
join forces with their KMT counterparts to prevent the two draft
bills from again being included on the legislative agenda.
</P>
<P>
"There will be no surprise on the part of the PFP, " Hwang said.
"The PFP is a political party that lives up to its promises."
</P>
<P>
Due to the absence of PFP and Non-Partisan Solidarity Union
(NPSU) lawmakers, their peers from the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) and its ally, the Taiwan Solidarity Union
(TSU) , were able at the April 17 committee meeting to push the
two bills through for further screening.
</P>
<P>
One seeks to ban indicted citizens from pursuing presidency,
apparently directed at former KMT Chairman Ma Ying-jeou, and the
other targets the return of the KMT's ill-gotten assets.
</P>
<P>
But the two bills were defeated by KMT, PFP and NPSU lawmakers
during last Friday's committee session on a KMT-initiated
proposal that the meeting be adjourned, after the KMT and the PFP
inked a 7-point pledge early that same day on bilateral
cooperation in December's legislative election.
</P>
<P>
In addition to agreeing to allot five constituencies to be
handled by the PFP in the legislative election, the KMT also
promised the PFP  to wrap  up two-way coordination  in the
remaining constituencies within two weeks -- a development that
helped bring about a temporary cease fire between the two allied
parties.
</P>
<P>
PFP Legislator Chang Hsien-yao, who also leads the party's
central policy center, urged Monday evening the two parties to
open high-level talks as soon as possible to coordinate their
actions in the upcoming legislative election.
</P>
<P>
Chang called on the two parties to examine their relationship
strategically so as to free themselves of much of the baggage
troubling them.
