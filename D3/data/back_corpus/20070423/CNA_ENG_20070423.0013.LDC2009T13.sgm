According to the organizers, including the Tourist Bureau and the

The fair venue will be divided into several exhibition areas,

performing groups from Ghana, Russia, Ukraine and France will put

The organizers said Monday that the annual travel fair has
successfully increased exchanges between domestic and overseas
tourist sectors and boosted Taiwan's tourism development since
first being held in 2000. In 2006, 236 businesses and
governmental tourism agencies took part in the TITF, which
attracted over 70,000 visitors, up 12.5 percent over the previous
year's level, the organizers said.

A total of 265 private businesses and governmental units have
applied to take part in the 2007 event, they added.
