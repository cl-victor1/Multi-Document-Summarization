TRADE, TEACHERS' GROUPS CALL FOR MINIMUM WAGE HIKE ASAP
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  April  23 (CNA) 04/23/07  13:46:08 (By Deborah Kuo)

Trade and teachers' groups urged the government Monday to raise
the country's minimum wage, which has been frozen at the same
level for a decade, immediately to make it more commensurate with
Taiwan's general economic situation and consumer price index.
</P>
<P>
At a news conference held in the leadup to International Labor
Day on May 1, representatives of the Taiwan Confederation of
Trade Union (TCTU) and National Teachers' Association (NTA)
demanded that the government raise the minimum wage immediately
to show that the government is concerned about the "survival
rights" of lower-echelon workers.
</P>
<P>
TCTU Chairman Shih Chao-hsien said that over the past several
years, enormous amounts of Taiwan capital has flowed overseas at
a tremendous pace as a result of a "specious" government policy
of financial liberalization.  The outflow of capital has in turn
compromised domestic workers' rights and interests, he claimed.
</P>
<P>
Shih added that the country's minimum wage, which has remained at
NT$15,840 (US$480) per month, or NT$66 per hour, for 10 years, is
not commensurate with current economic realities,  including
rising inflation. This is a development that has prevented low-
level workers from maintaining "a living with dignity" or even
securing their basic "rights to survival," he said.
</P>
<P>
NTA Chairman Wu Chung-tai said that many parents have taken on
extra jobs just to try to make ends meet, adding that this
moonlighting has had an impact on parent-child relations.
</P>
<P>
The representatives  also called for the administration to
institutionalize regular adjustments of the minimum wage and to
convene a meeting at least once a year in this regard to keep the
minimum wage fully commensurate with the actual economic and
social situations. They also resolved that TCTU and NTA members
will rally on Labor Day and invite six presidential aspirants
from the ruling and opposition parties to make known their
resolutions and ideals about the country's labor policy.
</P>
<P>
Lee Ying-yuan, Taiwan's top official in charge of labor affairs,
said earlier this month that the minimum wage will be adjusted in
the second half of this year, probably July 1, although the exact
timing for the implementation can be readily changed based on
practical considerations.
</P>
<P>
As to the adjustment range, Lee said, a combination of factors,
including the increase in the average consumer price index over
the past decade, Taiwan's general economic growth as well as the
possible adverse impact on local industries' competitiveness,
should be taken into consideration when deciding on the level of
the minimum wage increase.
</P>
<P>
While the business community has declared that 5 percent is the
maximum level they are willing to accept for an upward
adjustment, labor groups want a far larger hike, Lee said, adding
that he once proposed at a Legislative Yuan session that the
minimum wage be raised to 40 percent of the average salary of all
workers in the country. If adopted, the minimum wage would be
increased to NT$17,600 per month, representing a hike of 11
percent over the current level.
