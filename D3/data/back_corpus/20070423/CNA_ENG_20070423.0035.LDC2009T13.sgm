Taipei, April 23 (CNA) 04/23/07  22:27:06 (By Sofia Wu)

Premier Su Tseng-chang said Monday he will embark on overseas
tours if he wins the ruling Democratic Progressive Party's
(DPP's) mandate to run in the 2008 presidential election.
</P>
<P>
Su made the remarks in an interview with CNA as the DPP
presidential primary continued to heat up after two rounds of
televised policy debates among the four contenders.
</P>
<P>
Given Taiwan's diplomatic plight, Su said the government has
consistently spared no effort to enhance the country's
international profile. If he manages to win the DPP primary, Su
said he will visit as many countries as possible, particularly
Taiwan's major security and trading partners, in his capacity as
the ruling party's candidate for the next presidency.
</P>
<P>
In the DPP primary fray, Su has often come under fire from the
rivaling camps over alleged abuse of his position for electoral
gains. Su said he foresaw such a scenario long before the primary
race began.
</P>
<P>
"I offered to quit the premiership when the last legislative
session ended early this year. But President Chen Shui-bian asked
me to stay to complete many important policy initiatives. Out of
good faith between me and the president, I decided to stay, " Su
said, adding that he may offer to resign again in case he wins
the primary.
</P>
<P>
"If the situation becomes difficult or unfavorable for me to
carry out major policy initiatives, I'll consider stepping down
from my current job," Su explained.
</P>
<P>
As to whether he would reshuffle the Cabinet in short term, Su
said it's not on his agenda since the administrative team is
working smoothly in high morale.
</P>
<P>
Su also touted his team's achievement in promoting tourism in
innovative ways, including naming the pop band F4 as "tourism
ambassador" in attracting tourists from Japanese and South Korea.
Just on Sunday, some 5,000 of the group's Japanese and South
Korean fans visited Taipei to meet with their idols.
</P>
<P>
"Over the past few years, we have adopted many new measures to
sell Taiwan in a bid to rev up our sluggish tourist industry.
Thanks to concerted efforts in the public and private sectors, we
have reaped encouraging results. The number of tourist arrivals
have increased steadily in the past two years and the number is
expected to hit a new high this year," Su said.

<P>
Asked about the government's policy on casino business, Su said
the government would consider opening the business in the context
of promoting tourism. "We would not open gambling for gambling's
sake. We would allow for such business only on the premise of
attracting foreign tourists," he added.
</P>
<P>
Touched on foreign private equity groups' increasing interest in
acquiring local blue-chip companies, Su said the government will
respect market mechanism in dealing with those issues.
