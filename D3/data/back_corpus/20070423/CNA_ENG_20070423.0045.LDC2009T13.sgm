Taiwan,  April 23 (CNA) 04/23/07  22:45:29 (By Han Nai-kuo)

<P>
Olivia Newton-John and her band decided Monday to stay in Taiwan
for an extra day to savor Taiwan's delicacies after enchanting
more than 9,000 Taiwanese fans in a pair of concerts the previous
two nights.
</P>
<P>
Newton-John, who arrived in Taipei April 19, was scheduled to
leave for Singapore for her next leg in her current four-nation
Asian tour, but decided to delay her departure to Tuesday
afternoon, so that she could have a full extra day free to visit
Taipei's night markets and taste some of the unique delicacies
recommended by organizers of her performances in Taipei.
</P>
<P>
The 58-year-old Australian singer gave two concerts in the Taipei
Arena on Saturday and Sunday nights and achieved a resounding
success.
</P>
<P>
She led her fans -- most in their 40's to 60's -- back through
time with a string of hits from a repertoire of her famous songs,
including "Have You Never Been Mellow," "A Little More Love,"
"Stronger Than Before," "Xanadu," "Magic," "Suddenly," and
"Physical."
</P>
<P>
On her second day in Taipei, Newton-John and her entourage took
time out to visit the National Palace Museum. Unable to see much
because of the intense media attention, she said she will find
another time to visit the museum.
</P>
<P>
Taipei is the second leg of Newton-John's current Asian tour and
the only city to enjoy a pair of concerts. She performed in Hong
Kong April 15 before coming to Taipei. She will also give one
concert in Singapore April 27, followed by another performance in
Kuala Lumpur April 29.
</P>
<P>
Newton-John's original schedule included one concert in Shanghai
April 24 but the performance was later cancelled.
</P>
<P>
Newton-John settled in Malibu, near Los Angeles after winning a
series of Grammy Awards for her work. She has also won numerous
Country Music Awards, American Music Awards and People's Choice
Awards.
</P>
<P>
A versatile singer, Newton-John has covered rock songs as well as
the gentle folk songs and ballads which formed her early
repertoire.
</P>
<P>
She starred with John Travolta in the 1978 movie Grease,
catapulting herself to super-stardom with such hits as "You're
The One That I Want," "Summer Nights" and "Hopelessly Devoted To
You."
</P>
<P>
In 1981, she reached the pinnacle of her career with her million-
selling single "Physical."
</P>
<P>
After recuperating  from breast  cancer  surgery  in 1992,
Newton-John became a staunch supporter of breast cancer awareness
charities and has been advocating early detection and treatment.
