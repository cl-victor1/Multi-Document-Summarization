CONSTITUTIONAL INTERPRETATION ON MA'S PRESIDENTIAL BID URGED
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taipei,  April  23 (CNA) 04/23/07  18:54:08 (By Flor Wang)
</P>
<P>
A lawmaker urged the Central Election Commission (CEC) Monday to
ask the Council of Grand Justices (CGJ) for a constitutional
explanation on the bid by former opposition Kuomintang (KMT)
Chairman Ma Ying-jeou, an indicted suspect on corruption charges,
to run in the 2008 presidential race.
</P>
<P>
Ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) Legislator Yu Cheng-tao
made the call in a Legislative Yuan news conference, as it is
increasingly obvious that Ma is set to become the main opposition
KMT's presidential candidate. Ma is widely believed to be a
strong contender in the 2008 presidential polls.
</P>
<P>
Yu called on the CEC to ask the CGJ to rule on Ma's presidential
bid after he registers with the CEC to run in the next
presidential election or on the constitutionality of his
election, to fend off unnecessary rows in the future should he be
convicted after his election.
</P>
<P>
As the Presidential and Vice Presidential Election and Recall Law
bans citizens convicted with a prison term of over 10 years in
the first trial or those convicted in the third and final trial
on corruption charges from running in presidential elections, Yu
also urged Ma to drop his presidential bid, as the ex-KMT chief
was indicted in mid-February by Taipei prosecutors on corruption
charges.
</P>
<P>
Holding a new presidential election would cost about NT$1.2
billion, he said.
</P>
<P>
The Taipei District Court has opened two hearings on Ma's case
since early this month over his alleged embezzlement of about
NT$11 million in funds from a special monthly municipal allowance
earmarked for his discretionary use when he served as mayor of
Taipei from 1998-2006.
</P>
<P>
Ma maintains his innocence and has represented himself in his
defense during the two sessions.
