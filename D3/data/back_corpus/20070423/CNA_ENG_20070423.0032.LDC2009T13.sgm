The Legislative Yuan approved several amendments  to the
Physically  and Mentally Disabled  Citizens Protection Act on
first reading to further protect the rights of these people
Monday.

The amendments  were passed at Legislative  Yuan's Health,
Environment and Social Welfare Committee on the 10th anniversary
of the promulgation of the country's Physically and Mentally
Disabled Citizens Protection Act.

<P>
According to the amendments, the citizens should not abandon,
abuse, limit the actions of disabled people or leave the heavily
disabled persons in dangerous situations.

People are also banned from obliging these disabled people to beg
or commit crimes, exhibit them for commercial purposes, or
pressure or seduce them to marry.

According to the proposal of the Ministry of the Interior,
violators of the law will face fines ranging from NT$30,000
(US$909) to NT$150,000, and the government may publicly announce
their names.

Family members of the physically and mentally disabled people who
violate the law should receive between eight to 50 hours of

However, committee members were divided on the ratio of the
disabled  persons that public  or private  organizations  and
institutions should hire, and they left this topic for further
discussions.

According to the current law, government departments, public
schools or corporations whose total number of employees is no
less than 50 should employ disabled persons capable of work in no
less than two percent of their total number of positions.

Private schools or corporations whose total number of employees
is no less than 100 should employ the disabled with working

The amendments also include a clause advising people not to
touch, feed or bother a guide dog when it is guiding a visually
impaired people. However, no punishments are codified for
violators.
