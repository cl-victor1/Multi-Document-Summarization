The Tourism Bureau announced Monday that it will slap a fine of
NT$60,000 (US$1,820) on a travel service company for failing to
provide minimum quality service to a group of Chinese tourists.
</P>
<P>
Bureau officials noted that to embrace fully the opportunities
arising from opening Taiwan to Chinese tourists on sightseeing
tours, the bureau and travel service operators agreed late last
year to promote a program to upgrade travel services. Program
measures included the requirement that tour operators spend no
less than US$80 daily for each member of a Chinese tourist group,
and the age of tour buses used by Chinese tourist groups not
exceed seven years.
</P>
<P>
The officials stressed that the standards aim at ensuring a
certain level of quality service for Chinese tourists.
</P>
<P>
According to the officials, the travel service company recently
arranged for a Chinese tourist group to stay at a hotel in
Changhua where the expenses for one night's stay were only a
little over than NT$500.
</P>
<P>
But according to the US$80 minimum expenses per day for one
Chinese tourist, the accommodations should have cost over
NT$1,000 for one night.
</P>
<P>
Shockingly, one member of the tour group was bitten by a rat
while staying in that hotel.
</P>
<P>
For failing to care properly for the safety of the tourists and
ensuring that the tourists met the minimum expense requirement,
the bureau has decided to discipline the travel service company,
the officials said.
</P>
<P>
The bureau's announcement came amid reports that travel services
and bus operators, disgruntled at the bureau's strict
regulations, will rally at the bureau Tuesday to stage a protest.
</P>
<P>
Bureau officials explained that the requirement that buses used
by the Chinese tourist groups not exceed seven years is due to
concerns that Chinese tourists usually visit scenic spots as Sun
Moon Lake and Mt. Ali, which require travel on mountainous roads,
so ensuring that the buses are in good condition is a vital
safety consideration.
