American English language specialist Lydia Stack began conducting
a series of seminars at the Ministry of Education (MOE) Monday
afternoon to share effective English teaching methods with
elementary and junior high school teachers.
</P>
<P>
Stack came to Taiwan for five seminars from April 23-27 at the
invitation of the MOE with an aim to improve Taiwanese teachers'
teaching efficiency.
</P>
<P>
A specialist in English education for students from kindergarten
to grade 12, Stack has consulted on English teaching methods in a
number of Asian countries, including Japan and Honk Kong. She is
especially involved in teenage English education, curriculum
design, learning evaluation, and education standards of English
as Second Language (ESL).
</P>
<P>
In Monday's seminar, Stack pointed out that interactive classroom
learning activities help to elicit students' attention and
interest, and that group discussions in class are beneficial to
boosting students' learning efficiency as they create
opportunities for students to practice their skills and help
teachers with classroom management.
</P>
<P>
Teachers in the U.S. use a lot of group discussions in class to
help non-English speaking immigrant students, Stack said, adding
that she liked the interactive and interesting English teaching
methods in Taipei City's Hsinyi Elementary School that she
visited earlier before the seminar.
</P>
<P>
During the seminar, Stack also encouraged extra curricular
learning from readings and movie viewings to improve English
ability.
</P>
<P>
Seminars will be held in the coming days in Taoyuan County,
Hsinchu County, Taichung City, and Chiayi City.
