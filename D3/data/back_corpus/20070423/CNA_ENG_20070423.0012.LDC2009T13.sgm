A national land restoration plan put forward recently by the
Executive Yuan is expected to have an impact on some domestic
industries, particularly the cement processing industry, a
Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) official said Monday.
</P>
<P>
The plan -- formulated in line with a national land restoration
draft bill, which is pending in the legislature -- stipulates
that public land in high elevation areas or areas zoned for
restoration should not be leased out to private companies for
business usage.
</P>
<P>
Chen Tai-hsiung, a deputy director of the MOEA Bureau of Mines,
said that the land restoration plan is seen to have an adverse
impact on the cement,  iron and steel,  and petrochemical
processing industries. He added that if the plan is implemented,
Taiwan's cement and marble processing industries will be the
first to be affected, with many plants in these sectors being
forced to close down due to a dearth of raw materials.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Taiwan Cement Corp., one of the country's major cement
producers, does not expect the national land restoration plan to
have any immediate impact on its business operations.
</P>
<P>
A corporate source said that Taiwan Cement has taken out leases
on three mine areas around the island for the extraction of hard
rocks or softer rocks for the production of cement. The leases
don't expire until 2017.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the source said, according to Taiwan Cement's new
extraction contracts with the government, only three percent of
the land in the leased rock mining areas is at an elevation of
higher than 1,000 meters.
</P>
<P>
The source  added  that  Taiwan  Cement  has always  been
environmentally- conscious and has helped green the mining areas
while excavating raw materials.
