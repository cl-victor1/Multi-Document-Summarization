The Executive Yuan hopes a draft bill for the National Pension
Act will clear the Legislative Yuan by the end of this year, the
vice minister of the interior said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Lin Mei-chu made the remarks during a question-and-answer session
at the Legislative Yuan after a local newspaper reported earlier
that the bill proposed by the Ministry of the Interior (MOI) has
been delivered to the Executive Yuan for review.
</P>
<P>
According to the report by the China Times in its Monday edition,
the draft bill stipulates that persons aged above 65 who have
joined the proposed pension program for 40 years will be entitled
to a monthly pension of NT$7,603 (US$229).
</P>
<P>
Lin said it has so far not yet come to a final decision in terms
of the pension amount, nor the date for beginning the program's
operation.
</P>
<P>
Also at the Legislative Yuan, Executive Yuan spokeswoman Chen
Mei-ling explained that after receiving the bill from the MOI
April 12, the Executive Yuan commissioned Minister without
Portfolio Lin Wan-yi to form a task force to review the bill.
</P>
<P>
The draft bill is expected to be delivered to the Cabinet plenary
meeting for certification by May 2, Chen said, adding that the
MOI will not file detailed reports on how it will enact the
national pension act or when it will begin to operate the pension
program until the bill is certified.
</P>
<P>
This bill proposes that anyone aged 25 to 64 not covered by any
form of social insurance be included in the national pension
program.
</P>
<P>
Forty percent of the monthly premium will be paid by the
government. For the handicapped, the government subsidy will
increase in accordance with the degree of disability. Low-income
families will be exempt from the premium, according to the
Executive Yuan.
</P>
<P>
Chen also noted that the Executive Yuan is opposed to any
proposals by lawmakers to raise the amount of any of the existing
stipend programs before the long- planned national pension
program is implemented.
