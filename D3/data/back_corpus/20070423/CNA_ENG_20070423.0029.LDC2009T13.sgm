PREMIER TOUTS COMPETITIVE EDGE OVER KMT CONTENDER
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taipei,  April 23 (CNA) 04/23/07  21:01:43 (By Sofia Wu)
</P>
<P>
Premier Su Tseng-chang said Monday he is confident that if he
wins the ruling Democratic Progressive Party's (DPP's) mandate to
run in the 2008 presdiential election, he will beat his rival
from the main opposition Kuomintang (KMT).
</P>
<P>
Speaking in an interview with CNA, Su said he possesses a
competitive edge that will enable him to defeat Ma Ying-jeou --
the KMT's best bet for the next presidency.
</P>
<P>
"My competitive edge includes political integrity, resoluteness,
competence  and a distinctive  'Taiwanese  flavor, '" he said
confidently.
</P>
<P>
In Taiwan's political map, Su said, the DPP has a firm grip in
southern Taiwan while the KMT's power base lies in northern
Taiwan. "I'm the only one who has been elected as county
magistrate in both southern and northern Taiwan," he said
proudly.
</P>
<P>
Su once served as magistrate of the southernmost county of
Pingtung. He had also twice beat his rivals from the KMT-led
"pan-blue" camp to win the magistrateship of Taiwan's most
populous county -- Taipei County in northern Taiwan whose
population accounts for one-sixth of the country's total.
</P>
<P>
While seeking re-election as Taipei County magistrate, Su said he
received support from across the political spectrum. "Both my
home county Pingtung and Taipei County can serve as my campaign
bases if I'm nominated by the DPP to run for the presidency," he
added.
</P>
<P>
On prosecution authorities' ongoing investigations into several
prominent political figures' use of their discretionary special
allowance funds, including Su's, the premier said he took the
probes in stride.
</P>
<P>
"Any public figure must withstand stringent test and scrutiny.
Moral integrity has been one of my priorities in pursuing
political career. I have never come under any question in this
regard. If I'm found to have breached or transgressed the law
with regard to the use of the special allowance funds set aside
for my discretionary use, I would definitely pull out of the
presidential race, " Su said categorically.
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors  started to probe how Su and three other DPP
presidential contenders -- Vice President annette Lu, DPP
Cahirman Yu Shyi-kun and former DPP Chairman Frank Hsieh -- had
used their special allowance funds during their stints as local
government chiefs after KMT's Ma was indicted Feb. 13 over his
alleged misuse of special allowance funds during his tenure as
Taipei mayor between 1998 and 2006.
</P>
<P>
In the past, Su said, Ma projected a clean image and the public
hold high expectation of his integrity. Immediately after Ma was
elected KMT chairman in 2005, he pushed for his party to
formulate a regulation that required its members to quit
political posts if they are indicted over corruption charges. As
a results, many KMT local government chiefs quit the party after
they were indicted on corruption charges.
</P>
<P>
"However, Ma was lenient toward himself. The KMT invalidated such
anti- corruption stipulation right after Ma was indicted, " Su
said, adding that the KMT-led "pan-blue" alliance had even
thwarted the DPP's recent efforts to revise the current law in a
bid to prevent those who are convicted in the first trial to run
for the president. Ma has vowed to pursue his presidential bid
even if he is convicted in the final trial.
</P>
<P>
Su also criticized Ma's inconsistence in his attitude toward the
KMT assets. "Before Ma was elected KMT chairman, he promised to
return the party's ill- gotten assets to the ntional coffers.
Once he was elected chairman, he quickly sold out many
controversial assets and the legality of those dealings have been
called into questioned," Su said.
</P>
<P>
As to personal competence and decisiveness in policy-making, Su
said the devastating 921 earthquake provided a god-send
opportunity for comparison of his and Ma's emergency response
capabilities.
</P>
<P>
"When the earthquake happened on Sept. 21, 1999, I was Taipei
County magistrate. Two buildings collapsed in the earthquake,
while only one building was toppled in Taipei City where Ma was
mayor. The collapsed Taipei building has so far not yet been
rebuilt, while the two toppled buildings in Taipei County had
been completed before I ended my magistrateship tenure," Su said.
