Managua,  Jan.  10 (CNA) 01/11/07  18:37:14 (By Wen Kuei-hsiang

Nicaragua did not mean to downgrade the status of Taiwan by
referring to the country as "China-Taiwan, " President Chen Shui-
bian said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Chen was commenting on an episode that took place while he was
attending the inaugural ceremony of Nicaraguan President Daniel
Ortega, during which the MC addressed Chen as the president of
"China-Taiwan."
</P>
<P>
Showing Taiwan reporters the headline of a local newspaper which
also refers to Taiwan as "China-Taiwan, " Chen noted the
country's diplomatic allies are often confused about the
abbreviation of or colloquial references to Taiwan's official
name -- the Republic of China.
</P>
<P>
For example, Chen said, when he was visiting Panama in 2001 and
the Vatican in 2005, both countries thought the "Republic of
China" could be abbreviated as "China" and thus referred to
Taiwan as "China."
</P>
<P>
Chen said as the situation is not only confusing to foreigners
but also to the people of Taiwan, it is the country's hope to
rectify its name to differentiate itself from the People's
Republic of China.
</P>
<P>
According to Chen, during his meeting with Ortega Tuesday, Ortega
referred to Taiwan as "Republic of China (Taiwan) " when he
mentioned the country for the first time, but called the country
"Republic of Taiwan" later on.
</P>
<P>
While Taiwan's  diplomatic  allies have in the past grown
accustomed to calling the country "Republic of China, " they are
now calling it "Republic of China (Taiwan) " or "just Taiwan" --
none of which are meant to downgrade the country's status, Chen
said.
</P>
<P>
Also commenting on the issue, Minister of Foreign Affairs James
Huang said "China-Taiwan" is a colloquial expression that carries
no political connotation and urged Taiwan's media not to play up
the matter.
