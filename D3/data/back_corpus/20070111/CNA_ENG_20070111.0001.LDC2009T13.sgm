Kaohsiung, Jan.  10 (CNA) 01/11/07  10:30:21 (By Han Nai-kuo)

<P>
The Kaohsiung District Court acquitted on Wednesday four Thai
laborers of all charges related to the Aug. 21, 2005 riot in
their living quarters in Kaohsiung County that caused NT$10
million in property damage.
</P>
<P>
The four Thai workers -- Mueangjan Phon, Meemak Saranyoo,
Bopribun Suksan and Kaeokone Baeng -- were charged for offenses
against public safety, theft and obstruction of official duty.
Public prosecutors identified them from 18 suspects through video
footage.
</P>
<P>
The court ruled that the poor-quality video footage showing
blurred human images cannot be considered as convincing evidence
that the four Thai laborers incited the riot and set fire to the
management office in their living quarters.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the court has found them not guilty as charged.
</P>
<P>
In a separate ruling, the court passed a six-month sentence on
Yen Shih-hua, general manager of Huapan Co. and four of his staff
members for providing video gambling machines in the dormitories
of the Thai laborers.
</P>
<P>
Huapan Co. was responsible for the management of some 1,700 Thai
laborers working on the Kaohsiung rapid transit railway project.
</P>
<P>
In its ruling, the court has asked the prosecution to find out
whether Yen and other Huapan employees engaged in enslaving and
exploiting the Thai workers.
</P>
<P>
The Kaohsiung County riot occurred when some of the Thai workers
took drastic action to protest poor living conditions and the
harsh restrictions placed on them by Huapan.
</P>
<P>
The mounting pressure and criticism have prompted the Kaohsiung
city government and Kaohsiung Rapid Transit Corp. to take action
to improve the living conditions of the Thai workers, who now
live in comfortable  dormitory buildings in the Hsiaokang
District of Kaohsiung City.
