A new model of household robot has been developed by a team of
researchers at Hsinchu-based National Chiao Tung University
(NCTU) that has the ability to follow those who need extra care,
university sources said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The robot, dubbed "NCTU Vision One, " can remember the figure of
their "master" -- whom they are designated to serve -- and follow
the individual to offer in- time help, they said.
</P>
<P>
Financed by the Ministry of Economic Affairs under a four-year
project titled "Computer Vision-based Intelligent Environment, "
the university's Computer Vision Center under the Department of
Computer Science has spent several years researching and
developing 13 new technologies, enabling the making of the robot.
</P>
<P>
The president of Asia University,  Tsai Wen-hsiang  --  a
participant in the project -- said the new digital vision system
allows the robot not only to remember the master, but also
recognize his or her gestures and offer services accordingly.
</P>
<P>
The robot can also judge the person's health condition by
analyzing facial expressions, he added.
</P>
<P>
Tsai said that after the master inputs a set of gestures, the
master can then instruct the robot through a single gesture --
whether it is "get me a drink" or "get my medicine." He also said
the built-in facial recognition database also help the robot
"better understand" the meaning of expressions.
</P>
<P>
Tsai added that with these functions, day-care of the elderly
could be replaced by the robot.
</P>
<P>
"The robot can also be remodeled to offer security watch, " Tsai
explained. "The robot's memory can distinguish intruders from
family members and it can be pre- set to follow these intruders
and relay the image to control center."
</P>
<P>
Tsai said that when in surveillance mode, the robot is programmed
to protect itself, which means it will keep a distance of 10-15
meters from the intruders and avoid possible attacks from them.
