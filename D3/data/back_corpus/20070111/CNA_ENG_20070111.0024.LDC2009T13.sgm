The total production value of Taiwan's optoelectronics industry
recorded NT$1.27 trillion in 2006, up 11 percent from the
previous year's NT$1.15 trillion, according to statistics
released by the Photonics Industry and Technology Development
Association (PIDA) Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The figure represented a 13 percent share of the global
optoelectronics market in 2006. The ratio is expected to increase
one percent this year.
</P>
<P>
In the next few years, the optoelectronics industry growth rate
is estimated to average 12 percent and the total output value
could reach NT$1.84 trillion in 2009.
</P>
<P>
Of the total output value of US$39 billion in 2006, the display
industry generated US$25.2 billion, or 64.6 percent, followed by
the opto-storage industry (US$7.2 billion or 18.6 percent), and
the opto-input devices (US$2.6 billion or 7 percent), said Murphy
Lin, a manager at the PIDA.
</P>
<P>
The total production value of top ten optoelectronics products
reached around NT$1.2 trillion, occupying up to 95 percent of the
total industry output.
</P>
<P>
These products included TFT-LCDs, TN/STN LCDs, CD/DVD-R/RW
drives, CD/DVD-Rs, digital cameras, image scanners, LEDs, optical
components.
</P>
<P>
Lin said that solar batteries enjoyed the highest growth rate of
136 percent among all optoelectronics products in 2006, thanks to
soaring energy prices and Europe's environmentally friendly
energy policy.
</P>
<P>
The growing FTTH (Fiber To The Home) markets in the United States
and Japan have helped boost the growth of the opto-communication
industry, with sales of optical fibers and cables growing 22
percent and optical active component sales rising 23 percent.
