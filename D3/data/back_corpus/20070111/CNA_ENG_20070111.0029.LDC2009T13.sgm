Taipei,  Jan.  11 (CNA) 01/11/07  20:25:11 (By Deborah Kuo)

<P>
Passengers were furious Thursday after a bullet train was delayed
by 26 minutes on a journey from Zuoying, in southern Kaohsiung
City to Banciao, in northern Taipei County, which should only
have taken 90 minutes.
</P>
<P>
The delay was the worst since Taiwan's first high-speed railway
was launched Jan. 5.
</P>
<P>
Most passengers who took the inaugural trains on the first day of
commercial operations Jan. 5 came away impressed by the
experience, but on Thursday, the passengers who took the bullet
train from Zuoying at 10: 25 a.m. -- the scheduled time --
arrived in Banciao at 12: 51 p.m. -- 26 minutes late.
</P>
<P>
The delay was caused by the failure of a door to close when the
bullet train was preparing to depart from the Zuoying station.
The high-speed rail operators scrambled to bring another train
into service, which departed the Zuoying station only 43 minutes
later.
</P>
<P>
Passengers were not entitled to a refund. According to the rules,
passengers can ask for a 50 percent refund if the high-speed rail
train is 30 minutes late and a full refund if it is one hour
late.
</P>
<P>
Thursday's delay marked the second incident involving the bullet
train in two consecutive days following a minor accident the
previous night when the doors of a bullet train failed to open
when it arrived from Zuoying at Tainan station. The train
departed Tainan two minutes after arrival at Tainan without
letting Tainan-bound passengers off nor Taipei-bound passengers
on the train.
</P>
<P>
After traveling for about one kilometer, the train operators
found the cause of the problem, stopped the train and brought it
back to the Tainan station on the same rail.
</P>
<P>
The train arrived in Banciao at 9:38 p.m. -- 13 minutes late.
</P>
<P>
The 345-km railway linking Taipei and Kaohsiung has reduced rail
travel time between Taiwan's two largest cities to 90 minutes
from the previous four- and-a-half hours.
