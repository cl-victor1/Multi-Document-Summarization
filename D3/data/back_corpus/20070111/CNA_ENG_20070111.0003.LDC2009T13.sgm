The government will set up a special task force to tighten
corporate financial supervision, speed up disclosure of
information about corporate insolvency reorganization
applications and increase transparency of financial information
to better protect individual stock investors, a senior official
said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Financial Supervisory Commission Shih Jun-ji made the remarks
after criminal investigators launched massive raids at
headquarters of troubled Rebar Asia Pacific Group and offices of
its subsidiaries earlier in the day on alleged irregularities
involving the group.
</P>
<P>
Shih said the commission will cooperate closely with judicial
authorities in probes into Rebar group, which operates more than
20 businesses spanning manufacturing, broadband communications,
banking and other services.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Shih said Rebar group founder Wang You-theng didn't
borrow NT$800 million for remittances abroad before fleeing to
China with his wife shortly before judicial authorities
prohibited the 80-year-old tycoon and 42 other members of his
family and senior executives of Rebar group affiliates from
leaving Taiwan earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
Two Rebar Group subsidiaries -- China Rebar Co. and Chia Hsin
Food &amp; Synthetic Fiber Co. applied for bankruptcy protection
last Thursday and prompted a run on The Chinese Bank, another
Rebar affiliate.
</P>
<P>
Judicial authorities raided the group's headquarters and the
offices of its subsidiaries  Wednesday in probes into alleged
irregularities involving the group, including breach of trust,
forgery, fraud, insider trading, embezzlement of corporate fund
and violations of the banking law and accounting regulations.
</P>
<P>
More than 40 Rebar group executives were summoned by criminal
investigators  for questioning  about  their roles  in alleged
irregularities in the group's operations, including Chin shui-ho,
chairman of Union Insurance Co., a Rebar subsidiary, who was
later released on a NT$200,000 bail. Two other executives have
been transferred  to the Taipei  Prosecutor's  Office  for
further investigations.
