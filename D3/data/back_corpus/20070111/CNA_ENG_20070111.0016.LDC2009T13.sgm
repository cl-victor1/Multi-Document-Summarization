The quasi-official Taiwan External Trade Development Council
(TAITRA) is organizing a trade delegation to help local
manufacturers tap India's market, a TAITRA official said
Thursday.

According to the official, the delegation is scheduled to make a
fact-finding visit to Mumbai and Chennai May 9-19 to explore
trade opportunities.

<P>
While there, the delegation will hold trade consultations with
local businesspeople, the official said, adding that local
businesses dealing in information technology products, machinery,
textiles, as well as parts and accessories for automobiles are
welcome to take part in the delegation.

In addition, the group might take advantage of the upcoming trade
promotion tour to visit the emerging market of Sri Lanka, the
official disclosed.

According to the official, the Ministry of Economic Affairs has
listed India as one of the major countries with which Taiwan will
seek to step up economic and trade exchanges this year.

India's economy posted an annual growth rate of more than 8
percent during the 2003-2005 period, the official said, adding
that the South Asian nation's economic growth rate for 2006 is
forecast to hit 8.2 percent.

Moreover, India is also expected to become one of the world's top
five economies prior to 2040, so domestic manufacturers should
seek to make inroads into the Indian market, the official said.
