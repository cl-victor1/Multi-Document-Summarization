Criminal Investigation Bureau (CIB) officials said Thursday that
they could not confirm reports that a suspect in a bank heist had
been apprehended in China.
</P>
<P>
CIB officials were responding to the reports that Lee Han-yang,
45, the driver of an armored truck for Group 4 Securicor, a
private security company, was nabbed in Kunming, in southwestern
China.
</P>
<P>
They said that if the reports are true, they will ask China to
repatriate Lee as soon as possible according to a cross-Taiwan
Strait agreement that both sides join forces to combat crime by
repatriating criminals who flee across the strait.
</P>
<P>
Lee allegedly fled to Guangzhou via Hong Kong before arriving in
Kunming by train Jan. 2. Public security officers in China
arrested him, although they did not find NT$56 million (US$1.72
million) he allegedly stole from the truck.
</P>
<P>
Group 4 Securicor officials said they were not aware of the
whereabouts of Lee and were checking the news via other channels.
</P>
<P>
The private security firm has offered a reward of 10 percent of
the retrieved money for information leading to Lee's arrest.
