Managua,  Nicaragua,  Jan. 10 (CNA) 01/11/07  23:30:42 (By Wen
Kuei-hsiang and Sofia Wu)

<P>
President Chen Shui-bian said in Managua Wednesday that he had
"pleasant and meaningful" chats with U.S. Secretary of Health and
Human Services Mike Leavitt before attending Nicaraguan
President-elect Daniel Ortega's inauguration that same day.
</P>
<P>
During his impromptu talks with Leavitt, Chen said he asked the
U.S. health minister to convey his gratitude to President George
W. Bush for the long-term U.S. support for Taiwan's bid to join
the World Health Organization and the World Health Assembly as an
observer, as well as for the privileges and courteous treatment
extended to him during his recent transit stop in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
Chen arrived in the Nicaragua capital Tuesday to attend Ortega's
inauguration, while Leavitt was serving as Bush's special envoy
at the event.
</P>
<P>
Chen Shui-bian expressed satisfaction Tuesday with his latest
telephone dialogue with Washington officials during his overnight
transit stop in San Francisco earlier this week en route to
Nicaragua.
</P>
<P>
Sharing his views with Taiwan reporters after arriving in the
Central American nation, Chen described the 40-minute dialogue as
"the best ever" for the past several years.
</P>
<P>
Chen said he was impressed with the welcome from the Washington
officials.
</P>
<P>
He said he was very happy to meet with former U.S. Secretary of
Defense William Perry, American Institute in Taiwan Chairman
Raymond Burghardt and Donald McQuade, vice chancellor of the
University of California at Berkeley, and to exchange views with
members of Congress over the telephone during his stopover.
</P>
<P>
While waiting for the start of Ortega's inaugural ceremony, Chen
said he also shook hands and chatted with the heads of state of
17 other countries, including Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez
and Bolivia's first Indian president, Eva Morales.
</P>
<P>
Former revolutionary Daniel Ortega was sworn in as Nicaragua's
president Wednesday, ending his nearly two-decade fight to return
to power by promising to maintain relations with the United
States while building a leftist coalition with some of
Washington's top foes.
</P>
<P>
Wearing his signature white, button-down shirt, the cuffs rolled
up to his elbows, Ortega took the oath of office at a plaza he
constructed as president in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
President Chen quoted Ortega as having said during their meeting
Tuesday that Nicaragua will maintain diplomatic ties with Taiwan
as it appreciates Taiwan's long-term goodwill assistance to its
national development.
</P>
<P>
On his way back to Taipei from Managua, Chen and his entourage
will make a transit stop in Los Angeles.
