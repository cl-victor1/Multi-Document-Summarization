HEADQUARTERS

Taipei,   Jan.  11  (CNA) 01/11/07  12:22:58 (By Sofia Wu)
</P>
<P>
Investigators have seized some key documents in a search of the
troubled Rebar Asia Pacific Group headquarters that could
incriminate some suspects in corporate scandals, prosecution
authorities said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Four prosecutors from the Taipei Prosecutor's Office led 195 law
enforcement officers and financial supervisors to search the
Rebar headquarters and offices of five of its major subsidiaries
as well as the homes of relevant executives in Taipei County,
Taipei City and Yilan County.
</P>
<P>
The search was carried out after investigators gained possession
of documents from the Financial Supervisory Commission on
suspected irregularities  involving business dealings between the
group's Chinese Bank and other subsidiaries.
</P>
<P>
Two Rebar Group subsidiaries -- China Rebar Co. and Chia Hsin
Food &amp; Synthetic Fiber Co. -- applied for insolvency
reorganization last Thursday which prompted a run on the Chinese
Bank.
</P>
<P>
Lin Chin-tsun, spokesman for the Taipei Prosecutor's Office, said
the investigative team searched more than 30 locations housing 50
to 60 companies and managed to seize a total of 50 cases of
documents and other evidence.
</P>
<P>
According to Lin, the investigative team has seized some key
evidence unfavorable to those who stand accused, but he declined
to elaborate.
</P>
<P>
The Rebar group reportedly controls more than 130 companies
spanning manufacturing, communications, finance, media and other
service industries.
</P>
<P>
The team will first focus their investigations on two cases in
which the investigators have collected useful leads -- the Great
Chinese Bills Finance Corp.'s suspected provision of questionable
financing to other Rebar affiliates and Union Insurance Co.'s
alleged involvement in embezzlement of corporate funds, Lin said.
</P>
<P>
As to two other potential scandals involving the group's three
other subsidiaries -- the Chinese Bank's excessive lending and
insider trading involving shares of China Rebar Co. and Chia Hsin
Food &amp; Synthetic Fiber Co., Lin said prosecutors are still at
the stage of collecting documents and evidence to serve as a
"solid base for further investigation."
</P>
<P>
More than 40 Rebar group executives, including Wang Ling-yi,
president of Chia Hsin Food &amp; Synthetic Fiber Co., were
questioned Wednesday. Union Insurance Co. Chairman Chin Shui-ho
was released on NT$200,000 bail.
</P>
<P>
Rebar group founder Wang You-theng fled to China with his wife
Dec. 30, a few days before prosecutors banned the duo and many
other family members and senior Rebar group executives from
leaving the country.
</P>
<P>
The number of Rebar group executives and Wang family members
prohibited from leaving Taiwan increased to 43 Wednesday, but
Gary Wang, one of the founder's sons who heads Eastern Multimedia
Group, is not included on the list. Wang has said his group is a
separate company and denied involvement in any Rebar-related
scandals.
</P>
<P>
The Rebar group employs more than 5,000 people, and many of them
have joined forces to organize a self-help association aimed at
protecting their legitimate rights, an association spokesman
said, adding that judicial authorities' decision to freeze the
assets of the two affilaites under bankrupt restructuring
proceedings will force them out of work.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Financial Supervisory Commission Chairman Shih Jun-ji
said the government will set up a special task force to tighten
corporate financial supervision, speed up disclosure of
information about corporate insolvency reorganization
applications and increase transparency of financial information
to better protect individual stock investors.
</P>
<P>
Shih Jun-ji made the remarks after criminal  investigators
launched massive searches at the headquarters of troubled Rebar
Asia Pacific Group and the offices of its subsidiaries earlier in
the day on alleged irregularities involving the group.
</P>
<P>
Shih said the commission will cooperate closely with judicial
authorities  in investigations  into the suspected Rebar group
scandals, including breach of trust, forgery, fraud, insider
trading, embezzlement of corporate funds, and violations of the
banking law and accounting regulations.
