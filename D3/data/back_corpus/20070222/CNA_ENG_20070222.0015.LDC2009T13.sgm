Taiwan's 2006 agricultural trade was valued at US$12.58 billion,
a decrease of 2.75 percent from the year-earlier level, according
to a statistical report released by the Council of Agriculture
(COA) Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The COA report was based on its analysis of 2006 agricultural
import and export data provided by the Directorate General of
Customs under the Ministry of Finance, a COA spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The report shows that the island's 2006 agricultural imports
totaled US$9.28 billion, showing a slight year-on-year decrease
of 0.77 percent; the island's agricultural exports reached US$3.3
billion, making a significant decrease of 7.91 percent. As a
result the overall agricultural trade deficit increased US$211
million to reach the total of US$5.98 billion.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said the island's main agricultural imports are
corn, tobacco, soybean, cotton, frozen beef, milk powder, and
broad leaf material.  Main agricultural exports include frozen
tuna, feathers, frozen bonita, eel, wool, pigskin, frozen
mouthbreeder and frozen squid.
</P>
<P>
The value of Taiwan's frozen tuna exports decreased by US$300
million because the International Commission for the Conservation
of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT) largely cut Taiwan's 2006 quota for
bigeye tuna in November 2005, and Taiwan's take of yellowfin tuna
in the Indian Ocean slumped. But as the ICCAT has reinstated
Taiwan's 2007 quota for bigeye tuna, its exports value is
expected to rise in the year to come.
</P>
<P>
The main source of agricultural imports to Taiwan in 2006 were
the United States, Australia, Japan, Malaysia, and China; the
main destinations for exports were Japan, Hong Kong, China, and
the United States, the spokesman said.
