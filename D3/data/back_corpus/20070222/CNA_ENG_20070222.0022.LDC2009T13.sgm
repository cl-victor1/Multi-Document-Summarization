ETHANOL GASOLINE TO BE USED BY GOVERNMENT VEHICLES IN TAIPEI CITY

Government vehicles in Taipei City will switch to using E3
ethanol gasoline within this year on a trial basis, officials at
the Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
They said the ethanol gasoline will be supplied to these vehicles
at specific state-owned CPC Corp., Taiwan gas stations.
</P>
<P>
By 2009, the ethanol gasoline will be available in several other
major cities in Taiwan, and filling stations all around the
island will make available both normal and ethanol gasoline by
2011, according to the MOEA.
</P>
<P>
E3 ethanol gasoline is composed of 97 percent gasoline and 3
percent ethanol. Countries of the European Union have been using
E85 ethanol gasoline, while E93 has been introduced on the market
in Brazil.
</P>
<P>
Although ethanol mixed fuels can help reduce dependency on fossil
fuels and diminish emissions of greenhouse gases, MOEA officials
noted that ethanol can erode fuel tanks and limit driving
performance -- factors which can only be offset by future
improvements.
</P>
<P>
Citing a previous survey, MOEA officials said that 1.17 million
cars, or 80 percent of all cars made after 2001, are adaptive to
ethanol gasoline. However, cars made before 2001 must be tested
to determine whether they can use ethanol- blended fuels.
