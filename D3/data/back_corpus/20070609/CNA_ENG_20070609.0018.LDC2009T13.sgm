College graduates are finding it more difficult to land jobs than
they had imagined and are ending up pursuing further education or
preparing for civil service exams rather than entering the job
market, a job information magazine reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Chang Sheng-yuan, editor-in-chief of Career magazine, said that
according to the survey conducted by the magazine, 80 percent of
the college graduates questioned said that they had difficulty
landing jobs and that they put off the pressure by pursuing
advanced studies at home or abroad or preparing for civil service
or other professional examinations.
</P>
<P>
If this group of graduates is counted, the actual jobless rate
among college graduates could be higher than the published
figures, he said.
</P>
<P>
Chang said that many college graduates "look like they have
jobs," but do not have full-time jobs. They often receive a
monthly salary of less than NT$12,000 (US$364) because they
cannot find full-time jobs, or they have to scrape by working at
home on short term projects, auctioning items on the Internet or
doing odd-jobs.
</P>
<P>
"Their income is not even on par with the minimum wage level of
NT$15,840 (US$480) for foreign laborers," Chang said, adding that
"the worsening of the job quality" among college grads is not
fully reflected in the jobless rate.
</P>
<P>
The pace for "non-traditional hiring" has quickened and the
number of full-time jobs is falling, Chang predicted on the
employment trend for 2007 college graduates.
</P>
<P>
Chang said government statistics show that the number of hourly
wage earners increased drastically to 180,000 in 2006 from 70,000
and that they received on average only NT$14,700 per month.
</P>
<P>
The number of dispatch or hourly paid jobs has increased
drastically as employers try to save costs, Chang went on.
</P>
<P>
On the personnel recruited by companies, Chang said companies are
in need of high-end elite and low-end laborers, and have no need
for mid-level talent.
</P>
<P>
Preparatory programs to nurture future executives has extended
from foreign companies to all trades, Chang said, adding that
boss are hoping to establish high-quality successor teams through
the rigorous screening and training programs.
</P>
<P>
He said these "para" executives often get promotion 10 or 20
years ahead of regular staff, and the time for "younger
executives leading older staff" has come.
</P>
<P>
He also claimed that Taiwan youths in their 20s are part of an
egotistic "me" generation who tend to think only of themselves
and change jobs frequently.
</P>
<P>
They tend to have every excuse when they make mistakes and ask
more from others than they are prepared to give themselves. They
have no respect for their superiors and have low EQ. They are
immature and have trouble getting along with others.
</P>
<P>
To cope with them, more and more companies have begun to employ
aptitude tests, believing that "personality attributes" are as
important as "professional ability," he said.
