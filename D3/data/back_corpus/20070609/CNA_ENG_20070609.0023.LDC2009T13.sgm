China is trying to pressure Taiwan's South Pacific allies into
severing ties with Taipei through Australia and New Zealand, Vice
President Annette Lu claimed Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the opening of a symposium on Taiwan's ties with
South Pacific states, Lu said China is trying to win Canberra and
Wellington's co-operation in its diplomatic plotting against
Taiwan by promising to support them to improve regional
stability.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, Lu said, Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao promised to
offer US$400 million aid over three years to states in the South
Pacific during a trip to the region last year in an attempt to
attract states into China's fold.
</P>
<P>
The vice president also accused Beijing of luring Costa Rica to
switch allegiance from Taipei to Beijing June 1, citing President
Chen Shui-bian as saying that Beijing has offered US$130 million
in grants in addition to US$300 million in soft loans to the
Central American country.
</P>
<P>
She derided Costa Rica President Oscar Arias Sanchez, whom Lu
said she had accompanied on a trip to Kinmen when he visited
Taiwan in 2001, for branding Taiwan "stingy" in granting aid to
its allies while explaining his government's decision to desert
Taipei for Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Noting that Arias was the winner of the Nobel Peace Prize in
1987, Lu said Arias has brought shame on himself for terminating
his country's 63-year friendship with Taiwan simply for money.
