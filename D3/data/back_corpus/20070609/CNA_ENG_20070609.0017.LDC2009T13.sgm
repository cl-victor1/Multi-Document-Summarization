Taipei, June 9 (CNA) 06/09/07  17:42:38 (By Y.F. Low)

<P>
President Chen Shui-bian reaffirmed Saturday the country's plan
to apply for full membership of the United Nations under the name
"Taiwan" in September.
</P>
<P>
Chen admitted that the bid might "appear impossible" at present,
but he claimed that Taiwan will "eventually" achieve the goal if
it makes the first move.
</P>
<P>
Despite failure in its bid to become a full member of the World
Health Organization in May, the country will continue to push
forward with the bid next year, he said.
</P>
<P>
Chen made the remarks while addressing a luncheon to mark the
third founding anniversary of the Love Taiwan Association in
Tainan City, southern Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
After failing in its bid to participate as an observer in the
World Health Assembly (WHA) -- the WHO's decision-making arm --
for the past 10 years owing to China's obstruction, Taiwan
applied for full WHO membership for the first time this year.
</P>
<P>
However, the bid was thwarted as the WHA adopted a motion to
exclude the issue of Taiwan's membership from the agenda of its
annual meeting held last month in Geneva.
