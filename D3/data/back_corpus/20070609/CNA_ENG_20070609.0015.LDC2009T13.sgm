JAPAN `TOO COWARDLY' ON YASUKUNI SHRINE CONTROVERSY: EX-PRESIDENT
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Tokyo,  June  9 (CNA) 06/09/07  16:56:49 (By Mike Chang, Yang
Ming-chu and Y.F. Low)
</P>
<P>
Former Republic of China President Lee Teng-hui accused Japan
Saturday of behaving in a "too cowardly" manner in dealing with
the controversy surrounding the Yasukuni Shrine.
</P>
<P>
Lee addressed the issue during a news conference held at the
Foreign Correspondents Club of Japan (FCCJ) to mark the
conclusion of his 11-day visit to this country. The event
attracted more than 200 journalists.
</P>
<P>
Lee claimed that the controversy is a product created by China
and South Korea owing to their inability to deal with their own
domestic problems.
</P>
<P>
According to Lee, it is a matter of course for politicians to pay
their respects "to soldiers who die fighting for their country"
and it is unreasonable that Japan should be subject to criticism
by foreign governments for visits to the shrine by the country's
leaders for such purposes.
</P>
<P>
Pointing to his own experience, Lee noted that during his 12
years as president, he visited the Martyr's Shrine in Taipei
twice a year to pay his respects to the heroes who died in a
revolutionary movement against the Ching Dynasty in 1911 in
China, even though the movement had nothing to do with Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
The Yasukuni Shrine is dedicated to the 2.5 million soldiers who
died fighting for Japan during World War II, including more than
28,000 from Taiwan, which was under Japan's colonial rule at that
time.
</P>
<P>
The reason for the controversy is that the shrine also honors
executed Japanese war criminals who committed inhuman atrocities
in China, Korea and many other countries in the Asia-Pacific
region.
</P>
<P>
Lee visited the shrine Thursday to pay his respects to his older
brother, who died fighting in the Japanese Imperial Army, and
said the move had nothing to do with political or historical
issues.
</P>
<P>
On Taiwan's relations with China, Lee said Taiwan is already an
independent country and that it is unnecessary for Taiwan to
"declare independence again."
</P>
<P>
While Beijing claims Taiwan is part of China and the United
States "probably thinks so too, " the people of Taiwan are the
true owners of Taiwan's sovereignty, Lee said.
</P>
<P>
He said it is uncertain when and how the cross-Taiwan Strait
issue can be resolved, but added that it is very important for
the people of Taiwan to stick strongly to "their belief that
Taiwan is independent."
</P>
<P>
He said Taiwan must continue its democratic development and urged
China to democratize its political system to grant its people a
higher level of freedom.
</P>
<P>
It was Lee's third trip to Japan since his presidency ended in
May 2000. However, the trip marked his first visit to Tokyo in 22
years and the first time he has made a public speech in the
country.
</P>
<P>
Also during the visit, he was awarded the first Shimpei Goto
Prize by the Japanese publisher Fujiwara Shoten in recognition of
his contribution to Taiwan's urbanization and democratization.
</P>
<P>
Lee told the FCCJ that the visit has been the most satisfactory
among all the foreign tours he has made.
</P>
<P>
He said he felt very honored to be presented the Shimpei Goto
Prize, adding that Goto's contribution to Taiwan's modernization
has connected himself spiritually with the late Japanese colonial
administrator.
</P>
<P>
Lee expressed the hope that he will be able to visit Japan again
next year or some other time to finish a half-accomplished tour
that retraced a journey made by haiku poet Matsuo Basho in 1689
based on which his famous work "Oku no Hosomichi" was written.
</P>
<P>
Lee said the unique Japanese culture is something to be treasured
and that he will continue to study Japanese culture based on what
he learned during his trip.
