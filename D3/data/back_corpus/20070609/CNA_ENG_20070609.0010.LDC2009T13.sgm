<P>
As the Taiwan population ages,  the increasing number of elderly
is expected to bring lucrative business opportunities, the
nation's top economic policy charter said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Council for Economic Planning and Development (CEPD) said
that as of March this year, there were 1.25 million people aged
between 55 and 59 and 1.65 million aged between 50 and 54. It is
estimated  that 2.9 million will reach the age of compulsory
retirement at 65 within a decade.
</P>
<P>
The growing number of elderly is expected to bring about
lucrative business opportunities, as retired people are usually
financially secure and can afford to spend money, CEPD officials
said.
</P>
<P>
They said the elderly attach great importance to safe and
comfortable living environments, adequate medical care and
travel, and that they have become the emerging spending group in
the market.
</P>
<P>
The officials added that the government's "mega investment, mega
warmth" project has heeded the demands of an aging population and
will promote related industries.
</P>
<P>
Medical care has been listed as an emerging industry under the
project,  and related sectors will include medical  equipment,
pharmaceuticals and health food for the elderly, they went on.
</P>
<P>
In a 10-year care program under the project, it is estimated that
by 2015, the number of professional and para-professional
caregivers, social workers, nurses and therapists will have
reached 83,000, they added.
