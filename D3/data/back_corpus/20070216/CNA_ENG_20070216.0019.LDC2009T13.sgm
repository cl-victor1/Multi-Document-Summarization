Opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Legislator Hung Hsiu-chu was indicted
on defamation charges Friday for insulting remarks she made about
ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) Chairman Yu Shyi-kun.
</P>
<P>
According to the indictment issued by the Taipei District
Prosecutor's Office, Hung called Yu "the most loyal dog" of
President Chen Shui-bian and accused Yu of being "worse than a
dog" while commenting on Yu's move to sue the China Times during
a TV talk show Sept. 25, 2006.
</P>
<P>
Cheng Tsun-chi, another guest on the show who made similar
remarks about Yu, was indicted Jan. 30.

<P>
Responding to her indictment Friday, Hung said she respects the
opinions of the prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
Hung accused the DPP of repeatedly resorting to lawsuits to
"attack and criminalize" KMT politicians, which she said reflects
the ruling party's pettiness.
