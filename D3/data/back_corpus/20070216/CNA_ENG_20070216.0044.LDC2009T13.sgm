<P>
Taiwan's economic growth rate for 2006 reached 4.62 percent,
thanks to diminishing credit card problems, a rising stock market
and good weather, the country's budget chief said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The figure surpassed the government's target of 4.5 percent, Hsu
Chang-yao, director-general of the Cabinet-level Directorate
General of Budget, Accounting, and Statistics (DGBAS), said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, last year's unemployment rate was 3.91 percent, while
the consumer price index (CPI) saw an annual increase rate of 0.6
percent, Hsu said, adding that both figures were lower than the
government's targets of 4 percent and 2 percent, respectively.
</P>
<P>
Attributing the rise in the economic growth rate to good
performance in the fourth quarter, Hsu said the effect of two
"ghost months" -- the seventh month of the Chinese calendar when
business activity is usually sluggish -- was over and that the
negative impact of bad credit card debt was subsiding.
</P>
<P>
The two factors had helped boost the tourism and food and
beverage sectors by 11 percent and 7.5 percent, respectively, Hsu
went on.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the stock market became more active, reporting a 20.4
increase in the total trading value compared with the 2005 level,
Hsu said, adding that this had also increased private spending.
</P>
<P>
The economic growth rate in the final quarter of last year
recorded 4.02 percent, higher than the 3.15 percent forecast by
the government, while the per capita gross domestic product (GDP)
reached US$15,640 in 2006, according to Hsu.
