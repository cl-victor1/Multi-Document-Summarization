Taipei,  Feb. 16 (CNA) 02/16/07  21:19:47 (By Y.L. Kao)

President Chen Shui-bian has told a group of female German
parliamentarians that Taiwan was proud to elect a female vice
president in 2000.
</P>
<P>
Receiving the Bundestag representatives at the Presidential
Office Thursday, Chen said that even though the United States --
a country that has been building its democracy for more than 200
years -- has yet to elect a woman as vice president, Taiwan not
only has already elected its first female vice president but has
also appointed two women as vice premier.
</P>
<P>
Chen said he attaches great importance to women's human rights
during a meeting with the German delegation.
</P>
<P>
He added that German women take an active role in the political
arena and that from Angela Merkel, who was elected as Germany's
first female chancellor in 2005, he thinks German people
particularly favor and admire female political figures.
</P>
<P>
Claiming that the competition environment is "always unfavorable
to females, " Chen said that given better opportunities and room
to perform, "women can do as well as men."
</P>
<P>
Chen said he cares about women's rights and noted that the Taipei
city government recruited the most female chief executives among
all government agencies during his tenure as Taipei mayor prior
to assuming the presidency.
</P>
<P>
He thanked the delegation for the German parliament's support and
concern for issues related to Taiwan and expressed hope for a
peaceful resolution to cross- Taiwan Strait disputes through
dialogue.
