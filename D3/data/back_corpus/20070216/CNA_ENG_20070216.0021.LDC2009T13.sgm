KMT TO FIELD STRONG TICKET IN 2008 PRESIDENTIAL RACE: ACTING

Taipei,  Feb. 16 (CNA) 02/16/07  17:37:02 (By Deborah Kuo)

The main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) will field only the
strongest ticket with the greatest chance of winning the 2008
presidential election, acting KMT Chairman Wu Po-hsiung said
Friday.
</P>
<P>
Wu made the announcement after a closed-door meeting with KMT
honorary Chairman Lien Chan, Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-
pyng, former KMT Chairman Ma Ying- jeou aimed at helping arrive
at a consensus among all aspirants contending for the party's
candidacy in the 2008 race.
</P>
<P>
Lien, who called the meeting, said that the four exchanged views
in a "very friendly" atmosphere, although all of them were
serious about the subjects discussed.
</P>
<P>
After the meeting, Wu announced a six-point consensus that the
four KMT bigwigs reached: that the KMT is resolute in defending
the country and the people's interests; that esprit de corps tops
all issues concerning the 2008 race; that a new KMT chairman will
be elected soon after the Lunar New Year; that the KMT will be
equally single-minded  and relentless  in efforts  toward the
year-end legislative election as it is toward the 2008
presidential election; that the KMT hierarchy will remain
completely neutral; and that Wang and Ma will give deep thought
during the Lunar New Year holiday concerning the 2008
presidential race and that mediation as well as coordination will
begin soon after the holidays end.
</P>
<P>
An early agreement on the KMT's presidential ticket grew urgent
after Ma announced his presidential bid and resigned as KMT
chairman following his indictment on corruption charges Feb. 13.
</P>
<P>
Lien has said that Ma's hasty announcement of his presidential
bid may "narrow" the maneuvering room available in attempting to
mediate between Ma and Wang, who is another KMT kingpin.
