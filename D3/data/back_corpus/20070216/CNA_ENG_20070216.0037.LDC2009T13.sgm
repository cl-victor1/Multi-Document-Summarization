The Ministry of Education (MOE) is "protecting  students'
Internet security" through promotion and education on information
ethics and online self- protection,  a spokesman for the MOE
claimed Friday.
</P>
<P>
A survey conducted by the Taiwan Network Information Center
(TWNIC) shows that Internet usage rate among Taiwan families was
72 percent, and that of individual users is 68 percent as of June
2006, with 95 percent of users aged from 12-25. The spokesman
claimed that Internet use by young people will cause more social
problems of Internet pornography or slander.
</P>
<P>
To prevent  such social problems,  the MOE initiated  the Taiwan
Academic Network improper information filtering system for nearly
3,500 schools four years ago to protect students from bad Web
sites, and also provides students' parents with free downloading
of IEblocker software -- an end-user filtering system.
</P>
<P>
Additionally, the MOE subsidized the Taiwan chapter of the global
End Child Prostitution, Child Pornography and Trafficking in
Children to build the www.smartkid.org.tw Web site to teach
students about Internet etiquette and self-protection. The
ministry also built the www.eteacher.edu.tw Web site offering
teaching resources about Internet use.
</P>
<P>
Other measures in practice include the promotion of an Internet
rating system and an excellent Web site recommendation, including
information ethics in high school textbooks, providing related
regulations and laws on the MOE's Web site and offering
counseling to students affected by Internet use.
