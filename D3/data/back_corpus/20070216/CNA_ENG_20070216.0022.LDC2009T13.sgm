`HUMAN HAIR LIFTING ELEPHANT' ACTIVITY HELD DESPITE PROTEST

<P>
An activity of using human hair to lift an "elephant" off the
ground was held in an amusement park in Tainan County, southern
Taiwan Friday, although rocks and timber took the place of a real
elephant due to protests from animal rights activists.
</P>
<P>
The protest caused embarrassment at one point for the National
Science and Technology Museum and Wan-Pi World, which sponsored
the heavily advertised activity.
</P>
<P>
The museum spent NT$250,000 (US$7,570) to buy 1.6 million human
hairs and asked a vocational school in Kaohsiung to braid into a
rope capable of lifting an elephant and platform with a total
weight of around eight tons.
</P>
<P>
But the activity caused concern among animal right groups, which
sent officials to appeal against using an elephant.
</P>
<P>
Lin Tai-ching, an ecology activist, pointed out that if the
activity is aimed merely at proving that human hair is strong
enough to lift heavy objects -- which in any case is already
well-known and hardly a scientific breakthrough -- there is no
need to use a living elephant.
</P>
<P>
Elephants are sensitive animals and even caging them in zoos is
already a violation of nature, let alone lifting one chained to a
platform, Lin said while questioning who would be held
responsible if anything goes wrong.
</P>
<P>
Wan-Pi World Chairman Hsu Chung-fa said the Asian elephant they
had planned to use has been held captive in the zoo for more than
10 years and is mild- tempered.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the park had done everything possible to ensure the
animal's safety and the platform carrying the elephant would only
be lifted 10 cm off the ground, which he said would also be an
opportunity to get an exact weight the elephant.
</P>
<P>
But because of the vehement protests from conservationists, the
organizers decided to use rocks and timber of equal weight to
carry out the "experiment" and apply for listing in the Guinness
Book of World Records.
</P>
<P>
Wang Chun-fa, director of the museum, claimed that the experiment
was "very creative."
