Taipei,  June 7 (CNA) 06/07/07  20:38:32 (By Han Nai-kuo)

United Airlines (UA) of the United States will resume daily
nonstop passenger and cargo service between Taipei and San
Francisco beginning June 8, while ceasing its daily passenger
service between Taipei and Nagoya in Japan, the company's Taiwan
office announced Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Taipei-San Francisco route will be served by Boeing 777s, UA
officials in Taipei said, adding that the service will provide
outbound passengers from Taiwan with access to more than 200
destinations in the United States.
</P>
<P>
The Chicago-based carrier began to fly the Taipei-San Francisco
route in 1987 but suspended the service in April 2003 and folded
its operations in Taiwan five months later because of an outbreak
of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in East Asia,
which set off a global health crisis.
</P>
<P>
UA decided to resume the Taipei-San Francisco route after the
company's recent assessment confirmed a market demand.
</P>
<P>
The airline opened its Taipei-Nagoya passenger service in April
2005 because of a growing demand from visitors to the 2005 Aichi
World Exposition. However, fierce competition from Taiwan's two
major carriers -- China Airlines and EVA Air -- operating the
same route prompted UA to halt the service.
