National Cheng Kung University (NCKU) Thursday launched an
innovative "house of quality life" that brings together advanced
technologies,  user-friendly interfaces,  and creative interior
designs to present a vision of a better living space, according
to the Tainan-based university.

Yang Jar-ferr -- director of NCKU's Institute of Computer and
Communication Engineering -- explained that the house is the
result of collaboration between seven departments and institutes
at NCKU, and  is  representative  of  the university's
integrated interdisciplinary capabilities.

The house features flexible walls and partitions, a wireless
sensing network, large 3-dimension display, user-oriented
lighting and appliance control, and "virtual" windows that can
remember user's preference  and adjust automatically to favored
"comfortable" conditions, according to NCKU.

Broadband  Internet  access  and  full-graphic,  interactive
interfaces are also attached to most household electronic
appliances, allowing users browse the Web, gather weather
information, or communicate with others via the Internet from
virtually anywhere in the house.

NCKU officials said that the house is currently only open for
several hours during weekdays, however, the university plans to
offer "lodging services" in the future, making possible short
overnight stays by visitors.
