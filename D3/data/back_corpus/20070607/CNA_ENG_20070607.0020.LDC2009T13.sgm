BEIJING ACCOUNTABLE FOR COSTA RICA FIASCO: VP
</HEADLINE>

Taipei, June 7 (CNA) 06/07/07  17:49:26 (By Flor Wang)

Vice President Annette Lu said Thursday that Beijing should be
held accountable for the severing of Taiwan-Costa Rica ties.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Foreign Affairs James Huang announced earlier the
same day Taipei's termination of diplomatic relations with Costa
Rica shortly after the Central American country's formal
announcement of establishment of diplomatic links with Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Although Lu said that the development was "predictable" due to
Taiwan's difficult situation in the international community as a
result of Beijing's suppression, she added that many people in
Taiwan are turning a blind eye to this and are seeking to placate
Beijing.
</P>
<P>
She said Beijing's international isolation of Taiwan is a severe
problem that Taiwan's people have to face up to, and questioned
how a certain opposition presidential candidate can attempt to
tie Taiwan's fate to Beijing's control. She also voiced her grave
concern that the candidate will be unable to lead Taiwan through
the many difficulties and challenges ahead if he is elected head
of state.
</P>
<P>
"It is not prudent to pass the buck to the government, as Beijing
is expected to further pressure Taiwan and aggressively challenge
Taiwan on a wide range of fronts," Lu said, urging Taiwan's
people to maintain cool heads and draw a clear line between the
two sides.
</P>
<P>
As Lu is slated to visit Paraguay in July at the invitation of
Paraguay's vice president and parliament speaker to mark the 50th
founding anniversary of the Republic of China (Taiwan) -Paraguay
diplomatic partnership, she promised to help explore and solidify
Taiwan's diplomatic standing on the tour.
