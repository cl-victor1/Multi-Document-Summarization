Taipei, June 7 (CNA) 06/07/07  20:35:01 (By Lilian Wu)

<P>
Taiwan registered a trade surplus of US$1.59 billion in May, the
15th consecutive month in which the country recorded a trade
surplus since March 2006, the Ministry of Finance said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Financial officials cited customs' tallies to show that exports
in May totaled US$19.58 billion, up 3.5 percent month-on-month.
The figure was the seventh largest for a single month.
</P>
<P>
Imports in May totaled US$18.19 percent, down 0.1 percent from
the same month last year, or the third largest total in years.
</P>
<P>
Officials attributed the increased exports in May to greater
exports to China, six member countries of the Association of
Southeast Asian Nations and Europe, which rose 5.2 percent, 3.3
percent and 12.5 percent, respectively.
</P>
<P>
Although Taiwan increased its imports from China, the United
States and Europe by 14.0 percent, 12.5 percent and 12.2 percent
respectively in May over the same month the year before, imports
from the six member countries of the ASEAN and the Middle East
decreased by more than 11.0 percent, and crude oil imports from
Angola, Africa decreased by 40.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
Officials said that exports in the first five months of this year
totaled US$93.86 billion, up 6.8 percent year-on-year, mainly
because exports to Asia increased by 7.5 percent, including
increased exports to China, Japan, South Korea and six member
nations of the ASEAN by 6.7 percent, 3.1 percent, 7.1 percent and
10 percent, respectively.
</P>
<P>
Exports to Europe also increased by 10.9 percent, although
exports to the United Stated were cut by 2.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
Imports in the first five months totaled US$84.73 billion, up 4.1
percent over the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
One  noteworthy  phenomenon  is  that  information  and
telecommunication product exports in May were down by 15.1
percent from the same month last year, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
They said that negative growth has become a norm since July 2006
due to outflow of manufacturers, and that double-digit decreases
have become the norm, with a decrease as high as 22 percent in
November.
</P>
<P>
Electronic product exports in May showed an unusual decrease of
2.5 percent from the same month last year, which the officials
attributed to the high comparison base of last year's
performance. Last year's electronic product exports averaged a
23.16 percent increase over the previous year.
