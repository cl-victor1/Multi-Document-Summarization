Tourism Bureau Director-General Janice Lai said Thursday that she
will promote Taiwanese tourism during her visit to Japan, and
expressed hope that the total number of Japanese visitors to
Taiwan will exceed 1.23 million this year.

Lai made the remarks at Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport in
the northern county of Taoyuan before leading a delegation to
Hokkaido, Japan.

Lai said that she will visit the tourism sector in Japan and
introduce Taiwanese tourist spots and delicious foods to Japanese
citizens in the hope that more people from Hokkaido will visit
Taiwan in the second half of the year.

Hokkaido has been a popular tourist destinations for Taiwanese
people over the past decade, Lai said, adding that the total
number of Taiwanese visitors to Hokkaido every year increased
from 50,000 10 years ago to 250,000 last year.

Taiwanese tourists accounted for half of the total foreign
visitors to Hokkaido, according to Lai, however, fewer than
50,000 people from Hokkaido travel to Taiwan every year.

With that in mind, the bureau began to collaborate with private
travel promotion organizations in Hokkaido in recent years as
part of efforts to increase two-way exchanges and visits, Lai
said.
