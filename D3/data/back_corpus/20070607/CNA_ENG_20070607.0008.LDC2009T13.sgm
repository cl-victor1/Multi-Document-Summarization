Minister of Foreign Affairs James Huang said Thursday he has
offered to resign to assume responsibility for the latest
diplomatic setback, namely Costa Rica's switch of diplomatic
allegiance from Taipei to Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Huang said he had informed President Chen Shui-bian and Premier
Chang Chun- hsiung of his decision to resign, but he didn't say
whether his superiors have agreed to his offer.
</P>
<P>
Huang just said President Chen and Premier Chang have instructed
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to handle the aftermath properly.

Costa Rican President Oscar Arias announced his administration's
decision to forge diplomatic relations with China 5:15 p.m.
Wednesday (local time) shortly after he urgently summoned
Republic of China Ambassador to Costa Rica Wu Tzu-dan to inform
him of the decision.
</P>
<P>
According to Huang, Chinese Foreign Minister Yang Jiechi and his
Costa Rican counterpart  Bruno Stagno already  signed a joint
communique in Beijing June 1 on establishing formal diplomatic
ties. However, the Costa Rican government failed to inform Taiwan
of such an unfriendly event until 4:00 a.m. Thursday (Taipei
time).
</P>
<P>
For the sake of upholding national interest and dignity, Huang
said, the ROC government has decided to terminate formal
relations with Costa Rica and cease all bilateral cooperation
projects.
