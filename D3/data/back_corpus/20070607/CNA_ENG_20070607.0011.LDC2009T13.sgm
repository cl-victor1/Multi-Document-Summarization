Taipei,  June 7 (CNA) 06/07/07  12:50:28 (By Sofia Wu)

<P>
President Chen Shui-bian said Thursday that he has rejected
Minister of Foreign Affairs James Huang's offer to resign over
Costa Rica's switching of diplomatic recognition from Taipei to
Beijing.
</P>
<P>
"Given  China's  unmerciful  suppression  of Taiwan in the
international arena, Taiwan's diplomatic staff face an unusually
tall order in carrying out their work, " Chen said, adding that
"we need to give more encouragement and support to them."
</P>
<P>
Chen made the remarks during an inspection tour in the southern
county of Yunlin after Huang said at a press conference earlier
in the day that he had informed President Chen and Premier Chang
Chun-hsiung  of his intention  to resign  over Costa  Rica's
establishment of diplomatic relations with China.
</P>
<P>
Chen said Huang has done his utmost "to safeguard the country's
diplomatic territory and should not be blamed for the setback."
