Taipei, June 7 (CNA) 06/07/07  19:46:01 (By Ruth Wang)

Vice President Annette Lu said Thursday that she will visit
Paraguay, Taiwan's only South American ally, to attend a ceremony
in July celebrating the 50th anniversary of diplomatic relations
between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Lu said she will lead a delegation to attend the ceremony, but
added that the itinerary in Paraguay has not yet been settled.
</P>
<P>
Interviewed by reporters at the Presidential Office that day,
which was also Lu's 63rd birthday, she said her birthday wish is
a better international situation for Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Lu said she will try to strengthen diplomatic ties with Paraguay
in the midst of a difficult diplomatic period caused by Costa
Rica's switching of diplomatic recognition from Taipei to
Beijing.
</P>
<P>
The fact that Costa Rica recognized China was the consequence of
China's suppression of Taiwan in the international arena,
therefore, it is not reasonable to blame Taiwan government for
this, Lu said.
</P>
<P>
The offer to resign by Foreign Affairs Minister James Huang is an
act of showing political responsibility and administrative
ethics, Lu said, adding that to accept or refuse Huang's
resignation will be a decision for President Chen Shui- bian.
