Tokyo,  June 7 (CNA) 06/07/07  17:50:34 (By Mike Chang and Y.F.

Former President Lee Teng-hui visited a controversial Japanese
shinto shrine for war dead Thursday to pay his respects to his
older brother, who died fighting for the Japanese Imperial Army
during World War II.
</P>
<P>
Lee entered the Yasukuni Shrine -- where the name of his deceased
brother is listed -- in the company of his wife and Japanese
writers Ayako Sono and Miura Shumon. He stayed there for
approximately 40 minutes.
</P>
<P>
According to Lee's companions, Lee, who is a Christian, did not
perform any shinto rites but only bowed and prayed silently in
memory of his brother.
</P>
<P>
While explaining his decision to visit the shrine earlier that
day, Lee said the visit was personal and had nothing to do with
political or historical issues.
</P>
<P>
The Yasukuni Shrine is dedicated to 2.5 million soldiers who died
fighting for Japan during World War II, including more than
28,000 from Taiwan which was under Japan's colonial rule at that
time. It has drawn controversy mainly because executed war
criminals are also enshrined there.
</P>
<P>
For Asian countries such as China and South Korea which were
affected by Japanese invasions, the shrine is a symbol of
Japanese imperialism.
</P>
<P>
Over the past few years, Taiwan's aboriginal representatives have
made several trips to Japan to demand that the Japanese
government remove the names of their ancestors from the shrine.
</P>
<P>
Lee's visit attracted a crowd of nearly 100 Japanese and foreign
reporters,  and some Japanese  television  stations  even sent
helicopters to cover the event.
</P>
<P>
Japanese Cabinet spokesman Yasuhisa Shiozaki declined to comment
on Lee's visit to the shrine, on the grounds that it was a
private activity.
</P>
<P>
Reiterating that Lee is in Japan for cultural and academic
activities, Shiozaki said his visit to the shrine would not
affect a planned meeting between Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo
Abe and Chinese President Hu Jinto slated for June 8 in Germany
on the sidelines of the G8 summit.
