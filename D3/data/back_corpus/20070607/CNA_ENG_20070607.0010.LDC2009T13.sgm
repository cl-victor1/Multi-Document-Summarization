lure Costa Rica to shift diplomatic allegiance, Huang said Taiwan
has no intention of waging a "checkbook diplomacy" battle with
China.

effect, " Huang said he believes that Costa Rica's decision is
only an isolated case, adding that the Ministry of Foreign
Affairs has ordered all of the country's overseas diplomatic
missions to cement relations with diplomatic allies.

Costa Rican counterpart, Bruno Stagno, already signed a joint
communique in Beijing June 1 on establishing formal diplomatic
ties. However, the Costa Rican government failed to inform Taiwan
