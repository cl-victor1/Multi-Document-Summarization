MOFA GOING ALL OUT TO MAINTAIN TIES WITH COSTA RICA: MINISTER
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taipei,  June 6 (CNA) 06/07/07  01:30:16 (By Sofia Wu)

<P>
The government is pulling out all the stops to stabilize
diplomatic relations with Costa Rica amid signs that the Central
American country may switch its allegiance to Beijing, Minister
of Foreign Affairs James Huang said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Briefing media outlets on the latest diplomatic situation, Huang
said the country's relations with Costa Rica are at a "sensitive"
stage and that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) is doing
"everything within our power" to consolidate bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
At present, Huang said, various bilateral communications channels
still function smoothly.
</P>
<P>
"Taiwan and Costa Rica have maintained diplomatic relations for
more than six decades. As both are democratic countries, we
harbor high expectations of future cooperation. We'll do
everything in our power to keep the ties, " Huang said, adding
that given its good international reputation, Costa Rica is not
expected to do anything that could seriously impair Taiwan's
national interest.
</P>
<P>
Although the Republic of China's ambassador to Costa Rica, Wu
Tzu-dan, has offered to resign to assume political responsibility
for the recent disturbance and uncertainty in ROC-Costa Rican
relations, Huang said he has rejected Wu's offer.
</P>
<P>
For the sake of boosting diplomatic staff's morale, Huang said,
the ministry has no personnel replacement plan at this critical
juncture.
</P>
<P>
Even though Costa Rica has been in frequent contact with China,
it has invariably stressed in its public statements its
willingness to maintain friendly ties with Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Huang said relations between the two countries are
indeed at a crossroads. It is hoped that the two countries can
communicate in a frank and sincere manner, Huang said, adding
that the MOFA is eager to know the discrepancies between Costa
Rica's publicly stated goals and its real thinking or stance.
</P>
<P>
"So far our ties with Costa Rica are OK, but there have been some
unusual signs lately that we should closely monitor and be on our
guard," Huang said.
</P>
<P>
Among the warnings was Costa Rica's unexpected "no" vote at the
World Health Organization's annual assembly in Geneva in mid-May
on a proposal to include Taiwan's membership  application  into
its discussion agenda.
</P>
<P>
For all the pall over the ROC-Costa Rican ties, Huang said the
government is unlikely to take the pre-emptive move to ditch
Costa Rica as some media outlets have speculated.
