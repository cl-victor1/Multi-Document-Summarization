Taipei,  April 28 (CNA) 04/28/07  18:39:18 (By Lilian Wu)

Premier Su Tseng-chang said Saturday that he regrets the attacks
on him by his three rivals in the ruling Democratic Progressive
Party (DPP) primary for the 2008 presidential election.
</P>
<P>
The premier, one of the frontrunners in the primary, made the
remarks while attending a clam festival in Yunlin County a day
after Vice President Annette Lu, former Premier Frank Hsieh and
DPP Chairman Yu Shyi-kun, held a news conference to accuse Su of
misusing national resources to aid his campaign. Su angrily
denied the accusation.
</P>
<P>
He described the "pork barrel" accusation from his rivals as
lamentable, saying he would only have expected such a slur from
the main opposition Kuomintang.
</P>
<P>
He said the DPP supporters do not want to see internal strife in
the party and added that only solidarity within the party is
needed.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Hsieh told a supporters' group that "a fair" primary
is crucial to ensure that all aspirants can gladly accept the
outcome. The primary will consist of a member vote May 6 and a
series of public opinion polls before it announces the candidate
later that month.
</P>
<P>
Lu continued to question if President Chen Shui-bian is favoring
any specific hopeful prior to the primary, saying that Chen
should "make his stance clear" as "integrity is crucial for a
national leader."
</P>
<P>
In fact, President Chen has on a number of recent occasions
clearly and unequivocally professed his neutrality as regards the
DPP aspirants.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Wang Toh, a party whip of the DPP in the legislature,
accused all four aspirants of campaigning as if they have lost
their senses as the primary draws near.
</P>
<P>
"They should calm down, otherwise the DPP will have no hope of
winning the presidential election next year," he added.
</P>
<P>
Former DPP Legislator Lin Cho-shui also said that the attacks on
the premier by his three rivals have DPP supporters worried.
</P>
<P>
He also said DPP acting Chairman Trong Chai should refrain from
attending news conferences of the hopefuls Friday, saying that he
should observe decorum as a chairman instead of interfering in an
election.
