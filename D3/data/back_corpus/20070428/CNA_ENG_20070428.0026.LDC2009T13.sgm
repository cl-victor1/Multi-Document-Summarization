Taipei Mayor Hau Lung-bin called for the central government's
support for the city's plan to transform the Easy Card into a
kind of electronic money that can be used at gas stations,
convenience stores, or to pay for entrance to the City Zoo.
</P>
<P>
Hau made the call at an activity hosted by the Taipei Smart Card
Corp. to celebrate breaking the 9 million mark for issuance of
the multi-purpose IC cards for Taipei's mass rapid transport
system, buses and parking lots.
</P>
<P>
Hau expressed approval of the company's efforts, which have made
Easy Card the largest-circulation card of its kind in Taiwan, and
the sixth-largest among Asian cities. He said that in the near
future when the cable car between the zoo and the Maokung tea-
production area in the Mucha district is inaugurated, people can
also use the card to pay for the cable car and for visits to the
zoo.
</P>
<P>
The city government has also been working with the Taipei County,
Keelung City and Taoyuan County in an effort to expand Easy Card
applications to public transport all over northern Taiwan, Hau
added, noting that the city government has also begun efforts to
encourage the railway and high-speed railway system operators to
adopt the card.
</P>
<P>
In the celebration, professional tennis players Chan Yung-jan and
Chuang Chia- jung, who reached the finals in the women's doubles
in the Australia Open earlier this year, touted the smart card
and hosted a charity auction for limited edition Easy Cards
carrying their images.
