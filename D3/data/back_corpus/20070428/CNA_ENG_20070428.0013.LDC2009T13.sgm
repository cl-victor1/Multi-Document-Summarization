<P>
Taiwan is becoming a learning-oriented society, attributed to a
mushrooming of community colleges around the country over the
years, former Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Ma made the remarks at a national community colleges conference,
a two-day event that kicked off Saturday at Ling Tung University
in the central city of Taichung.
</P>
<P>
Representatives of over 100 community colleges around the country
attended the annual conference, organized by the Taichung City
Bureau of Education and the National Association for the
Promotion of Community University, for talks on the development
of informal education.
</P>
<P>
Ma, also a former chairman of the main opposition Kuomintang,
cited cases in Taipei to point out the popularity of community
education.
</P>
<P>
Institutes offering such opportunities have become one of the key
learning channels in Taiwan, he added.
</P>
<P>
Ma also noted that a community college can act better than formal
colleges and universities  in promoting coherence of community
commonsense and arousing community vitality.
