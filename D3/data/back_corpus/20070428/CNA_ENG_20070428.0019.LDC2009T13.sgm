President Chen Shui-bian urged Saturday the four presidential
aspirants of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party to "show
restraint" lest they damage party solidarity.
</P>
<P>
The president made the remarks after visiting ailing Kaohsiung
Mayor Chen Chu at Kaohsiung Medical University Hospital. The
mayor was hospitalized Thursday due to high blood pressure.

With the presidential primary set to begin next month, the spats
among the hopefuls -- Vice President Annette Lu,  Premier Su
Tseng-chang, former Premier Frank Hsieh and DPP Chairman Yu Shyi-
kun -- have grown fiercer. Lu, Hsieh and Yu convened a joint news
conference Friday accusing Su of misusing the national resources
to aid his campaign, which Su angrily denied.
</P>
<P>
The president expressed the hope for a "positive competition, "
saying that elections are "transient" and urging the hopefuls to
take the primary "in their stride."
</P>
<P>
"They must show restraint even when attacking their rivals," he
said, lest the wounds become too big to heal completely.
</P>
<P>
On the question of who he will support, he said all four are
excellent candidates but that he will maintain neutrality without
favoring any specific ones.
</P>
<P>
He said the true rival of the DPP is not within the party itself,
or Ma Ying- jeou, former chairman of the main opposition
Kuomintang, but China,  which has relentlessly  obstructed
Taiwan in the international community.
