Taipei,  April 28 (CNA) 04/28/07  23:36:13 (By Sofia Wu)

The government has decided to name Yang Jia-jiun, director of the
Department of Legal Affairs under the Mainland Affairs Council
(MAC), to serve as Taiwan's new representative to Hong Kong, a
senior official said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Yang will replace Pao Cheng-kang, who will reach his full
retirement age soon, said the official who preferred anonymity.
</P>
<P>
Because of the complexity in Taiwan's relations with China and
Hong Kong, Taiwan's representative to Hong Kong is referred to in
Taiwan as director of the MAC's Hong Kong Affairs Bureau and in
Hong Kong as managing director of the Chung Hwa Travel Service.
</P>
<P>
According to the MAC official, the council already referred the
personnel replacement plan to the Cabinet for approval. If all
goes well, Yang's job transfer plan will be formalized soon.
Nevertheless, it remains unclear when Yang can get a work permit
from Hong Kong authorities.
</P>
<P>
It took Pao six months to get a working visa from the Hong Kong
government, the official said.
