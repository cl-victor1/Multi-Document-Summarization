PROSECUTORS TO BEGIN QUESTIONING FUND USE OF DPP BIGWIGS

Several audit and cashier officials handling the "special
allowance fund" of several prominent figures of the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party will be questioned next week in a
probe into alleged misuse of the fund, a special investigation
panel under the Supreme Prosecutors Office said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Chen Yun-nan, director of the panel, said that since those cases
were assigned to two teams of prosecutors earlier this month, the
prosecutors have been examining related evidence.
</P>
<P>
"The prosecutors have yet to summon any of the defendants to
explain their fund use," Chen said.
</P>
<P>
The indictment of former Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou, who used to
enjoy a reputation as "Mr. Clean" until his indictment for
alleged embezzlement of his "special allowance fund" this
February, has triggered a debate on the nature of the fund given
to senior officials around the country for their discretionary
use, a practice that has been going on for decades without
anyone's questioning.
</P>
<P>
Prosecutor Hou Kuan-jen alleged that Ma misused half of the fund
that went directly into his personal banking accounts during his
two-term mayorship between 1998 and 2006. The indictment forced
Ma to resign from the chairmanship of the main opposition
Kuomintang. Ma, who has denied any wrongdoing, has registered to
represent the party in the 2008 presidential election.
</P>
<P>
But another prosecutor in Tainan, in a similar probe of the
"special allowance fund" for Tainan Mayor Hsu Tain-tsair, dropped
the case last month, saying that half of the "special allowance
fund" that went directly to the mayor's banking accounts was an
"actual subsidy."
</P>
<P>
The Supreme Prosecutors Office will convene a meeting of the
prosecutors in early May to decide a coherent interpretation on
the nature of the fund, Chen said.
</P>
<P>
But he also said the panel will investigate each case based on
facts and evidence and that the consensus reached at the meeting
will only be used as a reference and will not affect the probe
into the current cases.
</P>
<P>
All dossiers related to the alleged misuse of the fund of the DPP
bigwigs were turned over from the now defunct anti-corruption
center to the special investigation panel, which was formally
inaugurated April 2.
</P>
<P>
The panel also formally began probes April 14 into alleged
discretionary fund misuse cases involving the four DPP aspirants
for the next presidency -- Vice President Annette Lu, Premier Su
Tseng-chang, DPP Chairman Yu Shyi-kun and former Premier Frank
Hsieh. Their cases were assigned to three prosecutors -- Hou
Kuan-jen, Shen Ming-lun and Chou Shih-yu.
</P>
<P>
Hou's team will also handle a similar case involving another DPP
bigwig -- National Security Council Secretary-General Tan Sun
Chen.
</P>
<P>
The case involving Judicial Yuan President Weng Yueh-sheng's
alleged misappropriation of the "special allowance funds"
budgeted for his discretionary use will be handled by three
prosecutors -- Chu Chao-liang, Wu Wen-chung and Lee Hai-lung. Chu
is the prosecutor who cleared the Tainan mayor.
