Taipei,  April 28 (CNA) 04/28/07  23:03:15 (By Sofia Wu)

The government remains firm on its stance that the Olympic torch
for the 2008 Beijing Olympics should enter and exit Taiwan both
via a third country if China would include the island on the
flame's relay route, an official said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Chou Jui, head of the office of the minister of the National
Council on Physical Fitness and Sports (NCPFS) , made the remarks
after International Olympic Committee (IOC) Chairman Jacques
Rogge was quoted as having said in India earlier in the day that
he hopes Taiwan and China can settle their disputes over the
torch relay route through consultations.
</P>
<P>
Beijing announced next year's Olympic torch relay route Thusday,
in which Taipei would be the 21st stop, behind Vietnam's Ho Chi
Minh City and before China- controlled area of Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Within hours of Beijing's  announcement,  Taiwan explicitly
rejected the Vietnam-Taiwan-Hong Kong route, saying it implied
Taiwan was part of China.
</P>
<P>
Rogge refrained from giving direct comments on the dispute during
his visit in India Saturday. He instead said that the dust has
not yet settled and that he looks forward to seeing the two sides
of the Taiwan Strait reach an agreement on the issue through
further talks.
</P>
<P>
Responding to press inquiries about the NCPFS' views on Rogge's
remarks, Chou said the council cannot make any comment until
after getting full information about the IOC's position on the
dispute.
</P>
<P>
But he added that one thing is certain that the government will
stick to its gun that the Olympic torch to be acceptable to
Taiwan must follow a "third country- Taiwan-third country" route.
</P>
<P>
Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) Vice Chairman Tung Chen-yuan said
earlier in the day that Taiwan would welcome the passage of the
Olympic torch through its territory but reject the intention of
China downgrading Taiwan to the level of one of its provinces.
The MAC charts Taiwan's policy toward China.
