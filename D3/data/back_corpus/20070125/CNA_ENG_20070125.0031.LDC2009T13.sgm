Vice President Annette Lu said Thursday that the CNA's annual
selection of 10 "rising stars" in various professional fields has
helped identify candidates in Taiwan's talent pool.
</P>
<P>
In the face of China's rise as a new economic powerhouse and the
challenges of globalization and a declining birthrate, Lu said
Taiwan needs to identify and nurture promising candidates to
"inject new blood into society" and groom a vast talent pool to
sustain national development.
</P>
<P>
Lu made the remarks at the CNA-sponsored 2007 Top 10 Rising Stars
commendation ceremony.
</P>
<P>
A guitarist and a golf ace in their teens, a rare disease
patient-turned- volunteer, an enterprising economist and an
innovative medical researcher are on this year's list.
</P>
<P>
Besides honoring and congratulating the award-winners, Lu also
exhorted them to continue pursuing excellence in their
professions and contributing to public service.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on the same occasion, Minister of Justice Shih Mao-lin
said the stories of the 10 award-winners epitomize Taiwan's vigor
and vitality. "They are the pride of Taiwan as they all have
noble ideals and have made remarkable contributions to society,"
he added.
</P>
<P>
This is the third consecutive year that CNA has celebrated the
inspiring power of potential by honoring those who have achieved
something remarkable or shown great promise for future
development before reaching the age of 40.
</P>
<P>
Rounding out the 2007 Top 10 Rising Stars list are Huang Mo-hsin
in the law and politics category; Sun Chih-li in economics,

Tu Wen-ling in social improvement and environmental protection;
Tseng Ya-ni in sports; Mayuei Pihou in social harmony; Hsu Chu-an
in medicine and public health; and Yang Yu-hsin in social
service.
</P>
<P>
The annual celebration is aimed at encouraging young people to
strive to make a difference with innovation and originality while
dedicating themselves to careers in the public interest, setting
guidelines for values and providing a new vision for Taiwan, CNA
Chairman Su Tzen-ping said.
</P>
<P>
He added that the CNA has strictly observed the principles of
openness and objectivity throughout the recommendation, initial
screening and final selection processes.

of Taiwan-born unsung heroes who are down-to-earth and diligent
and who show vitality, perseverance and a strong will to serve
and sacrifice in their pursuit of professional excellence and
making Taiwan a better place in which to work and live."
