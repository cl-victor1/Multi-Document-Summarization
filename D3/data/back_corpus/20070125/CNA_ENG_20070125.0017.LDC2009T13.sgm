Cathay Life Charity Foundation will begin training foreign wives
this year to tell stories to children as part of its efforts to
encourage them to integrate into Taiwanese society, foundation
chairman Fredrick F. Chien said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Chien outlined the program during a ceremony in which 30
exceptional volunteers, out of the foundation's total 3,200
volunteer workers, were recognized for their efforts.
</P>
<P>
The foundation will step up its service to the growing number of
immigrants in Taiwan starting this year, including training
foreign mothers as volunteer storytellers for neighborhood
children as a way to help them better adapt themselves to and
contribute to local society, Chien said.
</P>
<P>
It will be the first time that the foundation will have foreign
mothers voluntarily serve local people, he said.
</P>
<P>
The foundation, in cooperation with 150 college students from 10
universities, will also sponsor after-school reading and
assistance programs for poor foreign spouses and their children
with the aim of helping build the youngsters' spoken Mandarin
language ability and encourage healthy mental development, he
added.
</P>
<P>
According to Chien, the foundation assisted 1,077 immigrants last
year, a figure expected to increase to some 3,000 in 2007.
