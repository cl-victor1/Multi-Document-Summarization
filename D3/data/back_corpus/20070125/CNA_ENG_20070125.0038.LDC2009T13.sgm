Taipei Mayor Hau Lung-bin has urged enterprises to help
physically and mentally challenged people by offering them
employment.
</P>
<P>
Hau made the call Wednesday at a charity activity organized by
the Eden Social Welfare Foundation.
</P>
<P>
The activity was part of the foundation's efforts to promote the
welfare of the handicapped. It was held at Nu Cafe, which is
sponsored by Nu Skin Taiwan Inc., a Taiwanese branch of a global
direct sales company.
</P>
<P>
The collaboration began last June, the officials said, adding
that Nu Skin Taiwan Inc. is the first company to provide full
sponsorship  for the cafe's rent,  decoration,  facilities and
equipment, raw materials for coffee and bread, as well as the
monthly water and electricity bills.
</P>
<P>
The foundation plans to hold similar activities every two months
at Nu Cafe, which Hau said serves as a positive model for other
enterprises to offer assistance to the handicapped.
</P>
<P>
Well-known comic book illustrator Liu Hsing-chin was also present
at the activity and donated 10 of his manuscripts for charity
sales. Liu said the manuscripts were a treasure to him, and this
was the first time in 50 years that he made such donation.
