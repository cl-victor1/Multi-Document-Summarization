Taipei,  Jan.  24 (CNA) 01/25/07  12:11:56 (By Sofia Wu)

<P>
Chen Tsun-ming, the country's first top prosecutor appointed by
the president with the assent of the legislature, assumed office
Tuesday with a vow to combat major crimes and official
corruption.
</P>
<P>
Chen took over as state public prosecutor-general after accepting
the official seal of office from his predecessor Wu Ying-chao in
a changeover ceremony witnessed by Minister of Justice Shih Mao-
lin.
</P>
<P>
Chen, a seasoned prosecutor who has handled many high-profile
cases, said he is ready and determined to fulfill his official
duties and will endeavor to fight corruption, election bribery
and major white-collar crimes.
</P>
<P>
He also promised to complete the selection of qualified and
competent prosecutors within two months to form a special
criminal investigation panel under his direct jurisdiction to
deal with criminal cases of a severe gravity.
</P>
<P>
According to legal amendments to the country's prosecutorial
system adopted last year, the state public prosecutor-general is
authorized to organize a special crime-fighting panel to
investigate grave criminal activities, particularly those of an
especially severe gravity, or involving high-ranking officials or
prominent political figures.
</P>
<P>
The president used to have full authority to appoint the state
public prosecutor-general, however, under the revised Court
Organic Law enacted last year, the president's nominee now
requires the legislature's approval. According to the new rules,
an appointment must be approved by half of the legislators
present at a session, with at least one-third of lawmakers in the
legislature in attendance for the vote.
</P>
<P>
The Legislative Yuan gave the green light to Chen's appointment
in a Jan. 18 vote in which 126 lawmakers endorsed his nomination,
two voted against the nomination and 87 cast invalid votes. With
more than half of lawmakers present endorsing his nomination,
Chen's appointment was formally approved.
</P>
<P>
Under the new law, the state public prosecutor-general serves
only a single four-year term. The new measures are designed to
enhance  the  democratic legitimacy  and independence  of the
prosecutorial system.
