Some notebook computers release an excessively high level of
electromagnetic waves during wireless Internet connection, which
can be harmful to users' health, according to the results of
tests released Thursday by a local environmental group.
</P>
<P>
The tests, conducted by the Taiwan Environmental Protection
Union, covered 25 notebook computer products of different brands
and models.
</P>
<P>
The tests found that the electromagnetic emissions by 14 of the
products register more than 2,000 microwatts per square meter
during wireless Internet connection, much higher than the safe
level of 1 microwatt set by Austria for indoor spaces.
</P>
<P>
These 14 products covered brands including FIC, Asus, Twinhead,
Acer, IBM and Gigabyte.
</P>
<P>
Chen Shu-hua, an official at the union, said each product
registering electromagnetic emissions of more than 2,000
microwatts during wireless Internet connection had undergone at
least two tests with similar results.
</P>
<P>
However, their electromagnetic emissions were very low during a
wired Internet connection, Chen said.
</P>
<P>
Noting that electromagnetic waves in indoor spaces tend to exceed
the safe level if two or more computers are using wireless
networking at the same time, Chen said indoor wireless connection
should not be encouraged in places such as classrooms, libraries
and crowded spaces.
</P>
<P>
She said that children, teenagers, pregnant women and those who
are sensitive to electromagnetic waves should avoid exposure for
long periods to electromagnetic waves, which can trigger
hereditary illnesses as well as diseases involving the central
nervous system, immune system or reproductive system.
</P>
<P>
Also, she advised users not to place their computers too close to
their abdomen or chest while using a wireless Internet
connection.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the union urged authorities concerned to require that
computer manufacturers label the electromagnetic emission levels
of their products to protect consumers.
