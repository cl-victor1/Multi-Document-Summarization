The key suspects in a Jan. 2 bank heist apprehended by Chinese
security authorities after fleeing Taiwan to Yunnan Province were
repatriated to Taiwan Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Lee Han-yang -- the driver of an armored van for Group 4
Securicor, a private security company in Taipei -- who drugged
his colleague and made off with NT$56 million (US$1.7 million) --
and his younger brother, Lee Chin-tsan, an accomplice in this
case who once did business in Yunnan, were repatriated in
accordance with the Kinmen Agreement signed by Red Cross
societies from both sides of the strait in 1991.
</P>
<P>
The Lee brothers were first repatriated to the Taiwan-held front
line island of Matsu in the morning then airlifted to Taiwan
proper around 1: 30 p.m. after brief interrogations at a Matsu
police station.
</P>
<P>
Kao Cheng-sheng,  a deputy commissioner  with the Criminal
Investigation Bureau (CIB) under the National Police
Administration, led a CIB group to Matsu the day before for the
repatriation.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, NPA investigators said they believe that the NT$56
million Lee stole from the armored van has remained in Taiwan
since Lee hurriedly left the country immediately after the heist
and Chinese police did not find a large amount of money on him.
