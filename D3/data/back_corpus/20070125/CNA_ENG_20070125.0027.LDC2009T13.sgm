Traditional herbal medicine might be helpful to pet dogs and cats
suffering from depression, based on the positive results of
previous testing on rodents, sources at National Taiwan
University's Department of Veterinary Medicine said Thursday.

<P>
The testing on pets is scheduled to start in the following
months.

Citing the rodent experiment  conducted  by Taipei Medical
University (TMU), Professor Fei Chang-yung at the department said
the medication -- a soup named as "kan-mai-ta-tsao-tang" in
Chinese -- combines ingredients including liquorice, wheat, and
Chinese jujube to provide effects similar to anti- depression
drugs, increasing the level of serotonin and dopamine to ease
depression-related symptoms.

<P>
In the TMU testing, the therapy showed little or no side effects
common in other pharmaceuticals, Fei added.

Asked why the tests are being conducted on pet dogs and cats, Fei
pointed out that sedatives and pheromones often come with either
serious side effects or high costs and thus there is a need to
search for better medications.
</P>
<P>
According to a survey in 2001, 65 percent of pet dogs and cats in
Taiwan are constantly kept in the house and such confinement
often leads to negative emotions and poor behavior, including
aggression, gnawing furniture, and excreting at random.
