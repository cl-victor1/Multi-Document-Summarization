TAIWAN TO TRACK MIGRATORY BIRDS TO BOLSTER AVIAN FLU PREVENTION

The Council of Agriculture (COA) is planning to equip migratory
birds wintering in Taiwan with global positioning system (GPS)
devices in an effort to bolster Taiwan's avian flu preventive
measures.
</P>
<P>
Officials from the COA's Bureau of Animal and Plant Inspection
and Quarantine said Thursday that tracking migratory birds and
their travel patterns with the devices will help Taiwan better
monitor the birds so that avian flu can be kept at bay during the
winter, when the birds are following their migration routes.
</P>
<P>
The bureau is planning to cooperate with wild bird societies
around the country to install GPS microchips on visiting
migratory birds, bureau officials said.

<P>
In light of recent outbreaks of the virulent H5N1 strain of avian
flu at poultry farms in Japan and South Korea, the COA is paying
extra attention to the arrival and activities of migratory birds
from the north, bureau officials said.
</P>
<P>
They noted that the northern migratory birds follow several
routes when traveling south to winter. Most of these birds travel
to Taiwan either from Siberia via the Korean peninsula and Japan,
or from Siberia via southern China.
</P>
<P>
News reports have also said that South Korea has recently culled
nearly 250,000 chickens to try to prevent the spread of bird flu.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile,  the officials  said,  in addition  to the GPS
installation and stepped-up wild bird monitoring, the bureau has
also pushed chicken and poultry farms to erect wire fences to
keep Taiwan's local stock separated from wild birds, since
preventing contact between wild birds and domestic animals is
also very important in avian flu prevention.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam, Hong Kong and Japan have reported bird flu outbreaks
this month, while Indonesian officials said four people died
recently from H5N1. Myanmar reported its first H5N1 outbreak in
chickens and quail last March at farms in the central part of the
country. Bird flu killed 42 of the 93 people infected in Vietnam
in 2003-2005.
</P>
<P>
Bird flu, which does not easily infect humans, has so far killed
161 people globally since 2003, a relatively small number
compared to other diseases, according to the World Health
Organization. But epidemiologists fear the H5N1 virus could
trigger a global pandemic if it were to mutate and become easily
transmitted among humans.
