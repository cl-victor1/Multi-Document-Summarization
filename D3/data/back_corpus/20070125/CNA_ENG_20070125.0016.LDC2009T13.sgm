PRESIDENT SEEKS CONSTITUTIONAL INTERPRETATION ON HIS IMMUNITY
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taipei,  Jan.  25 (CNA) 01/25/07  16:27:57 (By Y.F. Low)
</P>
<P>
President Chen Shui-bian petitioned the Council of Grand Justices
Thursday for an interpretation regarding the head of state's
constitutional immunity from prosecution in a bid to clarify a
dispute surrounding the on-going judicial trial of the "state
affairs fund" case.
</P>
<P>
Chen also petitioned the Judicial Yuan to order the Taipei
District Court to stop the case's proceedings, on the grounds
that they are unconstitutional and will encroach on the
president's powers and result in the release of state secrets.
</P>
<P>
Presidential Office Deputy Secretary-General Cho Jung-tai, who
filed the petition on the president's behalf, claimed it is in
violation of the president's immunity for the prosecution to
indict first lady Wu Shu-jen over the case and then name Chen as
a "joint perpetrator."
</P>
<P>
In addition, the Taipei District Court has infringed on the
president's "state secrets privilege" by repeatedly requesting
that he provide the court with information regarding the
country's secret diplomacy, Cho argued.
</P>
<P>
Citing Article 52 of the Constitution, Cho noted that the
president enjoys immunity from criminal prosecution while in
office, unless he commits sedition or treason.
</P>
<P>
Additionally, as the head of state, Chen has the right to refuse
to disclose, during legal proceedings,  information  that may
jeopardize national security, Cho said.
</P>
<P>
The prosecution indicted Wu on charges of corruption and forgery
Nov. 3, 2006 after determining she had used receipts provided by
others to claim reimbursements totaling NT$14.8 million
(US$450,000) from the president's "state affairs fund" between
July 2002 and March 2006.
</P>
<P>
Stressing that none of the money went into his own pocket, Chen
claimed it was necessary to use receipts from different
individuals to muster the funds to engage in secret diplomatic
missions in certain  countries  because of the confusing  and
inconsistent accounting system governing expenditures by the
Presidential Office.
</P>
<P>
However, the Taipei District Court ruled Jan. 19 that the six
diplomatic missions cited by the president as having drawn on the
state affairs fund were not secret as the president claimed, and
should be disclosed in court proceedings.
