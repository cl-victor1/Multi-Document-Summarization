TAIWAN CAPABLE OF PRODUCING FLU VACCINE: CDC

Taipei,  Jan.  25 (CNA) 01/25/07  21:22:59 (By Zep Hu)

Taiwan possesses the key technologies necessary for the fast
production of vaccine strains against avian flu, the Center for
Disease Control (CDC) announced Thursday.
</P>
<P>
After acquiring any prevalent virus strain, researchers can now
develop the according vaccine strain within two months,
shortening greatly the time spent in vaccine production,
according to the CDC.
</P>
<P>
CDC Deputy Director-General Shih Wen-yi said researchers found in
previous attempts that the conventional vaccine development
technique -- using chicken embryos as the virus reproduction
medium -- was useless in the case of the bird flu virus, because
the virulence is so strong that the embryos died before enough
viruses could be gathered.
</P>
<P>
They later turned to reverse genetics, cultivating viruses in
vitro from the virus strains acquired from infected birds or
humans, he went on.
</P>
<P>
As for vaccine production capacity, Shih said the National Health
Research Institute has already established a vaccine quick
production facility that can produce 100,000 doses per year.
</P>
<P>
He also noted that the nationwide production capacity will be
expanded further after the CDC finishes negotiations with the
Dutch-based pharmaceutical company Akzo Nobel.
