President Chen Shui-bian will call for the establishment of an
international forum for emerging democracies when he meets with
five former heads of state in Taipei Friday, Foreign Minister
James Huang said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Huang said the forum initiated by Chen will be a regular
gathering for the world's emerging democracies to draw
international attention  to the issues facing them and to enhance
Taiwan's international profile.
</P>
<P>
In Friday's meeting, Chen will exchange views on democratic
development with former South African President Frederik Willem
de Klerk, former South Korean President Kim Young Sam, former El
Salvador President Francisco Flores, former Polish President Lech
Walesa and former Mongolian President Punsalmaagiyn Ochirbat.
</P>
<P>
They will also sign a statement calling for the establishment of
the forum for worldwide emerging democracies as a place for them
to share their experiences in the hope that it will help other
emerging democracies to avoid or overcome similar problems.
</P>
<P>
Huang said his ministry kept the list of foreign former heads of
state secret until the last minute to avoid unnecessary "external
interference" -- a reference to pressure from China -- in light
of Taiwan's absence of diplomatic ties with all five states.
