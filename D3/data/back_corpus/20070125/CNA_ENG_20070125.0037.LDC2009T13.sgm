The British Museum is one of only a few institutes able to plan
an exhibition of such scope introducing different facets of
various cultures from its extensive collections, the spokesman
said, adding that the NPM has worked with the British Museum for
over two years to bring this exhibition to Taiwan.

The exhibition is divided into 13 sections, including cultures of
early civilization, Mesopotamia, Egypt, Europe, Asia, the Islamic
World, Africa, Oceania, the Americas, etc, and covering works of
sculpture and painting, as well as historical and cultural
artifacts from the Paleolithic Age up to the 20th century.

The spokesman said all selected works have arrived Taiwan and
three of them had been unpacked. One is a classic wooden inner
coffin of a mummy-case; another is a wooden mummy-board called
"The Unlucky Mummy;" the third is "Bust of Antinous," a fine
marble statute from the second century Roman Empire.

The exhibition will begin Feb. 4 and last till May 27.
