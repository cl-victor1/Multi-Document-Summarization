PIG FMD VACCINATION TO CEASE

Trials to end vaccination against foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) in
swine will start in April across Taiwan, in the hope that exports
of the country's fresh pork may resume in August 2009,
agriculture officials said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
No-vaccination trials have been carried out in Penghu County
since March 2006, and will be extended to mainland Taiwan, Kinmen
and Matsu in this April, Bureau of Animal and Plant Health,
Inspection and Quarantine (BAPHIQ) under the Council for
Agriculture (COA) said.
</P>
<P>
According to the BAPHIQ, the trials will expand gradually, with
the numbers of pigs in each herd no longer receiving vaccination
increasing from a few to the entire stock. If the program goes
well the pork industry across the country will be FMD vaccination
free by August 2008.
</P>
<P>
If there is no outbreak of FMD for one year's time following the
final end of vaccination, Taiwan may apply to the World
Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) for recognition as a "FMD
free country where vaccination is not practiced", a status which
would enable the country to resume its once-vigorous fresh pork
exports, the BAPHIQ said.
</P>
<P>
A disastrous FMD outbreak struck Taiwan in 1997 and led to the
culling of 3.83 million pigs. With measures including
vaccination, the situation came under control and no outbreak has
been reported since Feb. 2001. In May 2003 Taiwan was recognized
as a "FMD free country where vaccination is practiced" by the
OIE.
</P>
<P>
The BAPHIQ said under its current status Taiwan may export heat-
treated pork but not fresh pork, but the resumption of exports of
the latter will provide far greater opportunities.
