Seoul,  Jan.  25 (CNA) 01/25/07  19:19:16 (By Chiang Yuan-chen

<P>
The Republic of China on Taiwan and South Korea share a common
commitment to democracy and a market economy, making these
countries completely different from mainland China, former South
Korean President Kim Young Sam said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
This is one of the reasons why he enjoys visiting Taiwan so much,
Kim said prior to departure for Taipei, where on Friday he is
scheduled to join ROC President Chen Shui-bian and four other
former presidents -- from Poland, South Africa, El Salvador and
Mongolia -- attending an advocacy meeting which aims at pushing
for the creation of a "global forum on emerging democracies".
</P>
<P>
In addition to attending the advocacy meeting, Kim is also
expected to deliver a speech -- on South Korea's democratization
and economic development -- to an ensuing international seminar,
which will discuss issues of emerging democracies from every
perspective.
</P>
<P>
Other topics to be discussed will include democratic transitional
justice, the options in creating a constitutional system,
splitting national and ethnic identities, the mass media and
democratic development.
</P>
<P>
Kim is also expected to join other experts and scholars from the
United States, Mongolia, South Africa, Chile, Romania, Pakistan
and the Philippines for group discussions.
</P>
<P>
President Chen attaches great expectations to the "global forum
on emerging democracies," hoping that it will serve as a platform
for dialogue and an exchange of ideas for new democracies from
around the world.
</P>
<P>
Kim said it will be his fourth visit to Taiwan since the two
countries severed formal diplomatic relations in 1992.
