The period from now to the Lunar New Year holidays is likely to
see an influenza peak, the Center for Disease Control (CDC)
warned Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Past experiences show that the first two weeks of February pose a
peak for flu, said Shih Wen-yi, CDC deputy director, adding that
busy transportations and frequent contacts during the New Year
time all help spread the disease.
</P>
<P>
According to CDC statistics, type B influenza has claimed four
lives across the country this winter. The center's monitoring
system, meanwhile, suggested a slight increase in the influenza-
like illness (ILI) rate in the past week - 5.7 to 5.8 cases out
of every hundred patients who consulted sentinel physicians.
</P>
<P>
Good news is that, Shih said, winter vacation for schools have
silenced cluster infections for two weeks.
