ENVIRONMENT WRITER PUSHES FOR WOODLAND RESTORATION IN TAIWAN
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  Feb.  4 (CNA) 02/04/07  18:03:08 (By Deborah Kuo)

A Welsh writer who has been a long time resident of Japan visited
the Taipei International Book Fair Sunday, where he expressed his
hope that woodland restoration can be achieved as successfully in
Taiwan as in Japan.
</P>
<P>
Clive Williams Nicol, 66, a writer, actor and Japanese citizen
who has published many books about wildlife and the environment
in both English and Japanese, is bringing new inspiration to
Taiwan with regards to restoring woodlands by putting his books
on display at the book fair.
</P>
<P>
On display at the fair are a number of his latest books -- all in
Japanese but translated into Chinese -- including "I Bought a
Forest," "The Whisky Cat," and "Tree."
</P>
<P>
In addition to promoting his new books and delivering speeches at
the Taipei book fair, Nicol will also help Taiwan's NGOs in their
efforts to restore Taiwan's woodlands.
</P>
<P>
Nicol,  who used to be a hunter  but is now a wildlife
conservationist and gourmet, said at the book fair that he was
very much impressed with the Taiwanese readers, whom, he
described as totally different from those he found in China.
</P>
<P>
The Taiwan readers are friendly and enthusiastic, quite unlike
the Chinese people, who do not smile at strangers and who seem to
have never seen birds or butterflies.
</P>
<P>
Noting that it takes time for a people to nurture the concept of
environmental protection and implement it, Nicol said he hopes
that his books will help extend the woodlands of Taiwan little by
little, and that more Chinese-reading people will contribute to
efforts related to wildlife conservation and environmental
protection.
</P>
<P>
Nicol was born in Neath, Wales, and from a young age expressed an
interest in wildlife and the environment. In 1958 he visited the
Arctic circle to research the Elder duck for McGill University.
He also spent two years in Ethiopia working as a game warden in
one of Ethiopia's national parks. By the early 1960s he was
studying karate in Japan, and soon thereafter began to study
Japanese at Nihon University. He has lived in Japan since that
time.
</P>
<P>
Since taking up residence in Japan he has written many books and
other literary works. In 1980 he won the Japan Broadcasting
Writer's Award for a television drama written in Japanese. He
also soon became an environmentalist activist, and to this day
travels both within and outside of Japan giving talks and
lectures on the environment, addressing issues such as
deforestation and the preservation of natural environments. He is
particularly interested in restoring Japan's vast woodlands, and
due to these and other endeavors is quite famous in Japan.
</P>
<P>
In the book, "Why I became Japanese, " Nicol wrote about how he
obtained Japanese citizenship. He now resides in a plot of forest
land he owns in Japan with his wife and two daughters.
