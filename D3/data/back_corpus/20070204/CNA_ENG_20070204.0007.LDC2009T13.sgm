Taipei,  Feb. 4 (CNA) 02/04/07  15:31:16 (By Deborah Kuo)

A Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) official warned Taiwan's local
travel agency operators and tour guides Sunday from dealing in
yuan, the Chinese currency.
</P>
<P>
MAC Vice Chairman Liu Teh-hsun said it is illegal under the
nation's currency law to buy or sell Chinese yuan privately, and
called for travel agency operators and tour guides to avoid such
practices, especially now that the Chinese New Year holiday is
approaching and transactions in the Chinese currency is
anticipated to increase sharply.
</P>
<P>
Liu said the MAC will collaborate with the Tourism Bureau under
the Ministry of Transportation and Communications to jointly
control illegal transactions in Chinese yuan in order to prevent
possible currency irregularities from occurring.
</P>
<P>
Currently, only banking institutions, airports and seaports in
the Taiwan-held outlying islands of Kinmen and Matsu are allowed
to engage in exchanges of Chinese yuan, Liu said.
</P>
<P>
He added that between the time that exchanges in Chinese yuan
were first permitted on Kinmen and Matsu early last year and
December 2006, about 228.11 million worth of Chinese yuan has
been exchanged. Of that total, over 99.5 percent was bought or
sold by Taiwan residents.
</P>
<P>
Liu attributed most of the large volume of transactions in yuan
on Kinmen and Matsu by Taiwan residents to speculation that the
value of the Chinese yuan might further appreciate, and to an
increasing number of Taiwanese residents traveling back and forth
between Taiwan and China via Kinmen and Matsu.
