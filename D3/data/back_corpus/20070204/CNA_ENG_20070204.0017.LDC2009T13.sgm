Amid recent controversy over his remarks on Taiwan's national
goals, Former President Lee Teng-hui said Sunday theTaiwan
Independencedebate is a false one used by the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) and opposition Kuomintang (KMT) to wrap
their power struggle.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a graduation ceremony of Lee Teng-hui Academy's
southern Taiwan branches, in Kaohsiung, he said extremist sects
with the design to cut the country's history off were formed
within political parties after the transfer of power in 2000.
</P>
<P>
The anti-democracy force in the KMT betrays Taiwan's history of
democratization and aims to take back the power and rebuild a
party-state system,he said, while the extremist force in the DPP,
just like their KMT counterparts, denies Taiwan's achievement in
democratization and says Taiwan is not yet an independent country
and is still in need of seeking independence.
</P>
<P>
He said one of the two forces defines itself as seeking
independence while the other is engaged in counter-independence
efforts with the Chinese communist regime.Both attempt to utilize
the false issue of Taiwan independence to provoke a 'unification
versus independence' conflict and to grab power out of it,he
said.
</P>
<P>
He said Taiwanese people have become the masters of their own
country in the 1996 presidential election, when 75 percent of the
votes went to him and the DPP candidate, under Chinese missile
threats.
</P>
<P>
Lee saidthe old parties, old politicians and old parliament have
turned a blind eye to the real needs of the people.They are only
causing problems instead of solving them; they are dragging the
country downward.
</P>
<P>
If the two extremist forces are left unchecked and continue to
split the people, Lee said, it's very possible that one political
force may collaborate with outside force and help fulfill the
Communist empire's ambition to annex the democratic Taiwan,
scraping the freedom Taiwanese people had fought hard to gain.
</P>
<P>
He said he is very worried over what policies China will adopt
toward Taiwan after its hosting of the 2008 Olympic Games and the
2010 World's Fair.Important things are happening outside and
affecting Taiwan but Taiwan is only keen on internal struggles,
he said,just thinking about this can make one shed tears.
