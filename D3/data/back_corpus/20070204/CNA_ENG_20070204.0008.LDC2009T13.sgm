BEIJING ALLEGEDLY SEEKING TIES WITH DPP

Taipei,  Feb.  4 (CNA) 02/04/07  15:52:36 (By Deborah Kuo)

A local Chinese-language daily reported Sunday that Beijing has
stepped up contacts with Taiwan's ruling Democratic Progressive
Party (DPP) , particularly in the wake of the mayoral elections
held in Taipei and Kaohsiung late last year.
</P>
<P>
The United Daily News quoted Lin Chong-pin, a professor with
Tamkang University's Institute of International Studies, as
saying recently that Beijing's Taiwan policy and strategy have
changed drastically since Taiwan's ruling DPP won the important
mayoral election in Kaohsiung.
</P>
<P>
Lin said he sees that the Chinese authorities have begun to seek
improved relations with the DPP in all aspects and will no longer
stake their approach to cross-strait relations solely on Taiwan's
opposition Kuomintang, according to the daily's report.
</P>
<P>
Lin added that the visit to Beijing by Chung Chia-pin, a former
DPP deputy secretary-general, in 2005 at the invitation of
Beijing Union University was just one of the examples underlining
Beijing's attempts to improve relations with the DPP.
</P>
<P>
Responding to that report, DPP Deputy Secretary-General Tsai
Huang-liang said Sunday that the ruling DPP will not exclude the
possibility of making contact with Beijing or exchanging views
with Chinese authorities on the premise that they recognize
Taiwan's sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
Tsai's response echoed remarks made by DPP Chairman Yu Shyi-kun,
who said recently that the ruling DPP will not shun contact,
exchanges or dialogue with Beijing so long as Taiwan's national
interests, cross-strait peace and the principle of equality are
respected.
</P>
<P>
The truth is, however, that exchanges between the ruling parties
from the two sides of the Taiwan Strait have yet to begin because
Beijing continues to reject government-to-government dialogue or
negotiation with Taiwan, Tsai said.
