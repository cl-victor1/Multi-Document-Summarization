'FOUR NOES PLUS ONE' PLEDGE MUST BE SCRAPPED: DPP CHAIRMAN
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  March 6 (CNA) 03/06/07  21:09:38 (By Luis Huang)
</P>
<P>
Ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) Chairman Yu Shyi-kun
said Tuesday that the "four noes plus one" commitment made by
President Chen Shui-bian in his 2000 inaugural speech must be
scrapped for the sake of safeguarding Taiwan's dignity as an
independent, sovereign state.
</P>
<P>
Describing the "four noes plus one" pledge as a "tacit consent"
reached between Chen and the United States under specific
conditions, Yu said the commitment was neither a resolution
adopted by the DPP nor a national consensus, and so must be
scrapped.
</P>
<P>
In his 2000 inaugural speech, Chen pledged that so long as China
has no intention to use force against Taiwan, during his term in
office he would not declare independence, not change the national
title, not push for the inclusion of the so-called "state-to-
state" description in the Constitution, nor promote a referendum
to change the status quo with regards to the question of
independence or unification. Furthermore, the abolition of the
National Unification Council (NUC) or the National Unification
Guidelines would not be an issue.
</P>
<P>
Among those promises, the function of the NUC and the application
of the National Unification Guidelines were brought to a close by
the president last year.
</P>
<P>
Yu spoke highly of Chen's recent declaration of a "four wants and
one without" doctrine -- namely that Taiwan wants independence,
rectification of its official designation, a new constitution and
further development, and that Taiwan is not, and will not be
polarized into left or right wing factions -- stressing that the
president's declaration is consistent with the DPP's core values.
</P>
<P>
Yu, who announced that he will vie for the DPP's nomination for
the 2008 presidential election, made the remarks while delivering
a speech at a DPP tea party in honor of local civil groups,
during which he also called on all the people of Taiwan to work
with his party  to  pursue  transitional  justice  by promoting
the name-rectification campaign and getting to the bottom of the
228 Incident of 1947, in which many elite members of local
society were killed.
