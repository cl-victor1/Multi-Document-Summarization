KAOHSIUNG LOOKING FOR SITE TO BUILD POP MUSIC CENTER

Kaohsiung, March 6 (CNA) 03/06/07  19:15:13 (By Han Nai-kuo)

The Kaohsiung city government's efforts to find a site on which
to build a Center for Popular Music have suffered a temporary
setback, but Mayor Chen Chu vowed Tuesday that the city
government will find a location for the project one way or
another.
</P>
<P>
The Cabinet-level Council for Cultural Affairs has agreed to set
aside NT$4 billion (US$121.3 million) for Kaohsiung to build a
pop music center in the city, on the condition that the location
of the center must be decided by the end of March.
</P>
<P>
The Kaohsiung city government's plan to build the center on
Kaohsiung harbor's No. 10 Wharf -- a bulk cargo wharf -- met
strong opposition from the Kaohsiung Harbor Bureau Workers
Industrial Union.
</P>
<P>
The mayor said she will continue to communicate with leaders of
the union in hopes that they would change their minds and allow
the music center to be built on the No. 10 Wharf, which is
considered an ideal site by officials at both the Council for
Cultural Affairs and the Kaohsiung city government.
</P>
<P>
Chen expressed confidence that construction of the new Center for
Popular Music will result in a "win-win situation", creating many
business opportunities for the local community.
</P>
<P>
Chen said she will seek assistance  from the Ministry of
Transportation and Communications to persuade Kaohsiung Harbor
Bureau workers to agree to the use of No. 10 Wharf for the music
center, which she said will be a new landmark of Kaohsiung.
</P>
<P>
She added that if the union continues to refuse to budge, the
Kaohsiung city government will not give up, but will instead find
an alternative location for the project.
