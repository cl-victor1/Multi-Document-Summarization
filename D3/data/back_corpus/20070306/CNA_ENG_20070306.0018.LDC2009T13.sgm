CHEN'S 'FOUR WANTS' MARK NO SHIFT FROM 'FOUR NOES' POLICY:
PREMIER
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  March 6 (CNA) 03/06/07  17:03:47 (By Flor Wang)

<P>
President Chen Shui-bian's Sunday remarks about Taiwan's
sovereignty and cross- Taiwan Strait relations marked no shift
from the "four noes" policy  laid out in his 2000 inauguration
speech, Premier Su Tseng-chang said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Su made the comments while answering questions  from main
opposition Kuomintang (KMT) lawmaker Wu Yu-sheng, who accused
Chen of deviating from his "four noes" policy by proclaiming the
"four wants" position Sunday during a dinner party marking the
25th anniversary of the Washington, D. C.-based pro-independence
Formosan Association for Public Affairs (FAPA).
</P>
<P>
According to Su, Chen's "four wants" declaration for the country
-- seeking independence, "rectification" of its official
designation, a new constitution and development -- is only a
description of the present cross-strait situation in which Taiwan
is a sovereignty independent of China.
</P>
<P>
The president's "four wants" voice an aspiration to underscore
Taiwan's identity and do not go against his previous "four noes"
pledge, Su insisted.
</P>
<P>
Su admitted that Chen had informed him of his plan to proclaim
the "four wants" prior to the FAPA gathering, but that he did not
relay the message to Minister of Foreign Affairs James Huang and
Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) Chairman Joseph Wu.
</P>
<P>
While Huang said that Chen's talks were merely a reiteration of
his past statements, Wu claimed that "there is no need for Su to
inform me of that because what Chen said Sunday evening does not
breach his standing or contradict the long-term goals of the
ruling Democratic Progressive Party.
