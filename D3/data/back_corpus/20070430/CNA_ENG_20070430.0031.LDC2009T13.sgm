MAC URGES BEIJING TO ACT IN CROSS-STRAIT NEGOTIATION MECHANISM
</HEADLINE>

Taipei, April 30 (CNA) 04/30/07  21:43:09 (By Elizabeth Hsu)

The Cabinet-level Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) suggested Monday
that China act within existing cross-Taiwan Strait engagement
mechanisms while proposing to open more access points for cross-
straits chartered flight services.
</P>
<P>
MAC Vice Chairman Liu Te-hsun made the remarks in response to
media inquiries on several controversial announcements by Chinese
authorities at a two-day forum co-hosted by Taiwan's largest
opposition Kuomintang (KMT) and the Community Party of China
(CPC) in Beijing that ended Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The announcements include the opening of six more Chinese cities,
namely Chengdu, Hangzhou, Nanjing, Shenzhen, Kueilin, and Dalian,
to serve as cross- strait chartered flight destinations, and the
opening of Taiwanese colleges and universities to enroll students
from China.
</P>
<P>
Liu explained  that the two sides talked about the issue
concerning destinations  of the chartered cargo and passenger
cross-strait flight services during authorized negotiations, and
that the KMT-CPC forum only served to exchange opinions between
two political parties and any agreements arising from such an
event cannot be implemented without governmental authorization.
</P>
<P>
As to the issue of Chinese student enrollment, Liu stressed that
educational resources in the country are shared by all Taiwanese
people. Providing local students with the best educational
resources on the one hand, while on the other hand resolving the
difficulties of some local colleges and universities in
recruiting students is a challenge the Ministry of Education has
to face, he said.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on recent media reports saying that Beijing has
defined Chinese people's sightseeing visits to Taiwan not as
"travel between two countries, " the MAC official stated that the
government hopes that Beijing will deal with the issue concerning
Chinese tourists' visits to Taiwan in a pragmatic manner, meaning
on an economic basis, not a political one.
</P>
<P>
Any unnecessary political barriers will certainly cause
difficulties in the cross-strait dialogues on the issue, Liu
noted.
