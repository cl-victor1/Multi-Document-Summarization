MAC CHIEF URGES BEIJING TO REMOVE POLICY BARRIERS
</HEADLINE>

Kaohsiung, April 30 (CNA) 04/30/07  19:36:07 (By Flor Wang)
</P>
<P>
Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) Chairman Chen Ming-tong urged
Beijing Monday to remove barriers to its policy to help bail out
ongoing negotiations with Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Chen issued the call at a seminar in Kaohsiung City attended by
representatives of the local tourism, business and industry
sectors.
</P>
<P>
Chen's comments came after the third economic cooperation forum
held between Taiwan's main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) and the
Communist Party of China (CPC) concluded a day earlier in
Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Although the KMT and the CPC reached agreement in several fields,
including allowing Taiwan-based universities  and businesses to
recruit students in China and to invest in Chinese shipping and
container companies, Chen, Taiwan's top China policy planner,
pointed out that the conclusions are invalid because the KMT does
not represent the Taiwan government.
</P>
<P>
"What the KMT and the CPC have done is more burdensome than
beneficial, further complicating the situation, " the MAC chief
said, adding that "any agreement reached between them must be
approved by the government."
</P>
<P>
Chen called on Beijing to remove barriers to its existing policy
toward Taiwan so as to help push forward real negotiations
already underway between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
Pointing to the long-expected opening of Taiwan to Chinese
tourists as an example, Chen said that the "simple" issue remains
unsolved following Sunday's KMT-CPC forum and ascribed the
failure to Beijing's continuous attempts to rehash political
issues. "But bilateral negotiations on the issue must go on," he
said.
</P>
<P>
As to the issue concerning Beijing's plan to relay the 2008
Olympic Games torch through Taiwan as part of its domestic route,
Chen said that the government will never yield to China's "two-
faced" scheme to make Taiwan one of its provinces and thus will
not accept the Beijing-proposed relay route.
</P>
<P>
The main obstacle to Taiwan-China dealings and permanent peace in
the Taiwan Strait resides in Beijing's reluctance to recognize
this country's existence as an independent sovereignty, he said.
</P>
<P>
In the face of Beijing's increasing bullying of Taiwan, he also
called for concerted efforts from the opposition parties and
local governments to forge national consensus and common ground
toward China.
