TSU LAWMAKERS SPEAK OUT FOR TERTIARY-EDUCATION GRADUATES

Taipei,  April 39 (CNA) 04/30/07  22:00:37 (By Flor Wang)

A group of lawmakers of the opposition Taiwan Solidarity Union
(TSU) Monday urged the government not to allow further
enrollments at tertiary education institutes, citing the huge
supply-demand gap between college graduates and the domestic job
market.
</P>
<P>
The group of TSU lawmakers, led by legislative caucus whip Tseng
Tsahn-deng, issued the call in a Legislative Yuan news conference
on the eve of the May 1 Labor Day.
</P>
<P>
Calling on the government to pay greater heed to a high
unemployment rate of 4.36 percent among Taiwan's university
graduates and master's and doctoral degree holders, Tseng said
that aglut of "unqualified" higher education manpower is already
having an impact on starting salaries.
</P>
<P>
Citing the latest statistics compiled by the Cabinet-level
Council of Labor Affairs, Tseng reported that the starting
monthly salaries for tertiary degree holders new to the job
market averaged NT$31,500, while those for new university and
college graduates stood at NT$26,700 and NT$23,800, respectively.
</P>
<P>
The earnings of Taiwan's university graduates and higher-degree
holders are little compared by their tuition fees, which have
markedly risen in recent years, Tseng said, noting that salaries
for Taiwan's higher education diploma holders have bogged down
over the latest 10 years.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, Tseng pointed out, a local graduate from a private
college or university typically carries student loan debts of at
least NT$400,000.
</P>
<P>
The TSU lawmakers' call came after Taiwan's main opposition
Kuomintang (KMT) concluded an economic cooperation forum with the
Communist Party of China (CPC), the third of its kind, a day
earlier in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
The CPC offered several overtures to Taiwan, including allowing
Taiwan-based universities and colleges to recruit students in
China, among others.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the issue, TSU Chairman Huang Kun-huei voiced his
opposition on the grounds that Taiwan's higher education
resources have been insufficient due to rapid expansion, with
each college student receiving only NT$10,000 in government
subsidies per year, a drop from the previous level of NT$30,000.
</P>
<P>
Against such a backdrop, there is no reason for Taiwan's colleges
and universities to court Chinese students -- a situation which
Huang predicted would further stretch educational resources for
local students.
</P>
<P>
What the government should do, Huang opined, is adopt adequate
measures  to phase  out  poorly-performing  higher  education
institutions.
</P>
<P>
According to TSU Secretary-General Chien Chen-shan, Taiwan cannot
pin its hopes on China to address such a problem. Many more
complications involving employment and immigration will arise
from such an opening to Chinese students and a recognition of
Chinese academic degrees, he warned.
