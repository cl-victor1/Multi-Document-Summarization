MARCH 23 SHOULD BE 'TAIWAN INDEPENDENCE DAY': VP
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  April 30 (CNA) 04/30/07  17:09:49 (By Deborah Kuo)

Taiwan is a sovereign state and "formally became independent" the
day Taiwan people cast their votes to elect their president for
the first time March 23, 1996, Vice President Annette Lu claimed
Monday in the eastern city of Hualien, adding that March 23
should therefore be set as Taiwan's independence day.
</P>
<P>
In a speech to her supporters in the Hualien area, Lu said
Hualien could be a "defensive frontline zone " instead of a safe
place in the rear in the event of military attacks by China.
</P>
<P>
She lambasted Beijing for downgrading Taiwan's sovereign status
when announcing a 2008 Olympic torch relay route plan recently
that included  Taiwan  as a "domestic  leg." She also blamed  the
administrative department for failing to take preventive or
remedial measures beforehand in this regard.
</P>
<P>
Noting that only people in sovereign states are given the right
to elect their own presidents, Lu claimed that presidential
elections have made Taiwan not only a de facto independent
country, "but also a de jure independent one."
</P>
<P>
Knowing this fact well, she went on, China fired intimidating
missiles into the seas off the coasts of Keelung and Kaohsiung on
the eve of the March 23 presidential election in 1996.
</P>
<P>
She added that one of the missions that the new Taiwan president
to be elected in 2008 should strive to carry out is to normalize
Taiwan's sovereign status in the international community,
claiming that so far none of the other presidential aspirants is
as capable and devoted as she is in this regard.
