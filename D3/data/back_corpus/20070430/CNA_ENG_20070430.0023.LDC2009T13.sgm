Taipei,  April 30 (CNA) 04/30/07  18:47:52 (By Y.F. Low)

The education resources enjoyed by Taiwan students would be
diluted if the government were to allow China citizens to study
in Taiwan without working out proper complementary measures, a
Ministry of Education official claimed Monday.
</P>
<P>
According to Szu Chi-pu, executive secretary of the ministry's
Mainland Affairs Task Force, there are more than 150 colleges and
universities in Taiwan, with public institutions receiving 80
percent of their funding from the government and private
institutions receiving 18 percent to 20 percent of their funding
from the government.
</P>
<P>
In assessing whether to allow Chinese students to study here, the
government needs also to take into account the possible decline
in the quality of education and the policy's possible impact on
the country's public order, Szu said.
</P>
<P>
Citing the example of Japan, Szu said approximately 70,000 China
students have studied in Japan since Japanese universities
started recruiting Chinese citizens, but he claimed that the
policy has resulted in worsening of Japan's public order.
</P>
<P>
In one case, a Chinese student killed a family of five in Kyushu
around four years ago, which prompted the Japanese government to
sponsor a racist advertisement urging its citizens to "beware of
Chinese, " Szu said, adding that the advertisement was removed
after protests by the Chinese government.
</P>
<P>
Szu made the remarks in response to Beijing's announcement Sunday
that Taiwan colleges and universities are welcome to recruit
students in China to promote cross-Taiwan Strait educational
exchanges and cooperation.
