CHEN URGES EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT TO SUPPORT TAIWAN'S WHO BID
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  April  30  (CNA) 04/30/07  14:36:02 (By Y.F. Low)

President Chen Shui-bian urged the European Parliament Monday to
continue to support Taiwan's bid to join the World Health
Organization (WHO) , a goal which is being pursued this year
under the name of "Taiwan."
</P>
<P>
Addressing the issue while receiving members of a pro-Taiwan
group in the European Parliament, Chen stressed that Taiwan is
applying to join the WHO under the name of "Taiwan" not because
the country is changing its official title but because the name
is more familiar to the international community than its official
title "Republic of China."
</P>
<P>
On the WHO Secretariat's claim that Taiwan is not a sovereign
country and therefore not qualified to become a WHO member, the
president asserted that Taiwan's status as a sovereign country is
"unquestionable" because Taiwan maintains diplomatic relations
with 23 official members of the WHO and one observer in the
organization.
</P>
<P>
Chen pointed out that Taiwan has tried but failed to join the WHO
for the past 10 years and that even the country's bid for
"meaningful participation" in the organization has been
unsuccessful.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated that the 23 million Taiwan people's right to health
should not be ignored, denied or restricted, while expressing his
gratitude to the European Parliament for adopting resolutions in
support of Taiwan's WHO bid on many occasions.
