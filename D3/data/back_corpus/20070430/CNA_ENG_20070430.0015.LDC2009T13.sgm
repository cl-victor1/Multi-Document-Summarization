<P>
Nearly 74 percent of Taiwan workers worry that they might become
victims of karoshi -- a Japanese term for death from overwork and
stress and fatigue from long working hours -- according to the
results of a public opinion poll released Monday.
</P>
<P>
The poll, conducted by 1111 Job Bank April 13-27 to mark May 1
Labor Day, found that 90 percent of the respondents have worked
overtime, with overtime hours averaging 8.2 hours per week or
1.64 hours per work day.
</P>
<P>
Of this group, nearly 50 percent were not paid for their
overtime, the poll found.
</P>
<P>
Wu Jui-ying, a 1111 vice president, quoted a 2003 report compiled
by the Lausanne,  Switzerland-based  International Institute of
Management Development as indicating that the Taiwanese worked an
average of 2,282 hours a year in 2002, more than anyone else in
the world.
</P>
<P>
Wu said that according to similar tallies compiled by the
Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics, Taiwan
workers worked an average of 2,170 hours a year in 2006, or 180.8
hours per month.
</P>
<P>
The 1111 poll found that Taiwan's salaried men and women worked
8.18 more hours per week than the normal weekly work hours so far
this year, marking an increase of 1.52 hours over the average of
6.66 hours recorded in 2004 in terms of weekly overtime hours.
</P>
<P>
In terms of overtime hours, the poll found that 71.7 percent of
the responding office workers work overtime in the evening after
their normal work, 19.38 percent work overtime when the need
arises and 17.6 percent work at the weekend.
</P>
<P>
The poll also found that 73.79 percent of the office workers
worry that they might die from overwork, as they often suffer
from symptoms of fatigue, including sore, numb neck and
shoulders, declining memory, difficulty concentrating and mood
swings.
</P>
<P>
The poll, conducted online, had a confidence level of 95 percent
and a margin of error of 2.2 percent.
