SONGSHAN AIRPORT UNSUITABLE FOR FLIGHTS TO HONG KONG, MACAU: CAA
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  Jan. 3 (CNA) 01/03/07  19:34:37 (By Lilian Wu)

<P>
It is inappropriate at the present stage to open Taipei Songshan
Airport for flights to Hong Kong and Macau, officials of the
Civil Aviation Administration (CAA) said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The officials made the report in a feasibility study of opening
Songshan airport for flights to the two special Chinese
administrative regions in response to a request by a legislative
committee.
</P>
<P>
They noted that the number of passengers between Taiwan and Hong
Kong and Macau in the first 11 months of last year accounts for
37.5 percent of passengers of Taiwan Taoyuan International
Airport in a regular year.
</P>
<P>
If Songshan airport is also open to fly charter or regular
flights to Hong Kong and Macau, it will divide the passengers
using Taoyuan Airport, Taiwan's main gateway.
</P>
<P>
Also, flight network efficiency of the Taoyuan airport will be
undermined and the competitive edge of the airport in Asia will
also be compromised, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
They said that currently around half of air cargoes are
transported on the lower decks of planes and relies on frequent
flight services to meet the needs of speedy delivery.
</P>
<P>
But they said that Songshan airport has no capacity to handle air
cargo, which they said will affect the delivery efficiency and
competitive edge.
</P>
<P>
In addition, they went on, there are no international flight
routes at Songshan airport and no transit services.
</P>
<P>
International passenger services were shifted to Taoyuan airport
in 1979 because Songshan airport had no more hinterland for
further development and was subject to restrictions from
pollution control in rural areas.
</P>
<P>
The restrictions have not relaxed over the years but have become
even more strict, they pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Songshan airport is still the most important airport for airlines
on domestic routes, they said. Judging from the current situation
and the facilities, it will be unable to accommodate regular
flights to Hong Kong or Macau, they added.
</P>
<P>
Also, from the perspective of national security and cross-Taiwan
Strait development, China still threatens the use of force
against Taiwan and if the airport is open for flights to Hong
Kong and Macau before the two sides establish a confidence
building mechanism, it will not only cause security concerns, but
will also be considered a direct flight point, which they said
will require cross-strait negotiation.
