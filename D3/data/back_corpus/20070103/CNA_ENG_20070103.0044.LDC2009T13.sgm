The opposition Kuomintang (KMT) and its ally, the People First
Party (PFP), have agreed to cooperate on the nomination of
candidates for the year-end legislative election, a KMT whip said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Tsai Chin-lung, general secretary of the KMT's legislative
caucus, told reporters that the KMT's Central Standing Committee
had approved a draft agreement on a KMT-PFP alliance for the
election, and that the heads of both parties are expected to sign
the pact as soon as the consensus is confirmed between the two
parties.
</P>
<P>
Tsai said in fielding candidates for the legislative Yuan
election, the KMT favors using negotiation to thrash out
differences between the two parties, and that only when
negotiation has failed will the KMT recommend using primary
elections to name candidates.
</P>
<P>
Asked whether the agreement with the PFP may trigger a backlash
among KMT hopefuls who think their chances of being nominated
will be affected, Tsai said there is nothing he can do if KMT
lawmakers seeking re-election are unhappy.
</P>
<P>
The legislative election at the end of this year will use a
"single-member constituency, two-vote system," with the number of
legislators slashed from 225 to 113 and their term extended from
three years to four.
</P>
<P>
Many incumbent legislators from both the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party and the KMT may become jobless, although the
new system will be unfavorable to candidates of smaller political
parties, including the PFP.
