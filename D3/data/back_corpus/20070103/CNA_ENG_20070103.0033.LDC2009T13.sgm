The government is eyeing 11 countries for stepped-up export
promotion, hoping to achieve an overall growth of 10 percent this
year, the Board of the Foreign Trade (BOFT) said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
BOFT officials said that in addition to continuing promotion
efforts in Japan, South Korea, India, Vietnam, Russia, South
Africa and Brazil, they will also target the Turkish and
Malaysian markets.
</P>
<P>
The officials said that based on customs tallies, Taiwan's
exports to the nine priority markets in the first 11 months of
2006 accounted for 17.6 percent of overall exports, showing that
the nine countries have potential for development.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the officials said petroleum-producing countries in
the Middle East have accumulated large amounts of petrodollars in
recent years thanks to soaring crude oil prices.
</P>
<P>
The BOFT will step up promotion efforts in Saudi Arabia and
United Arab Emirates,  saying that in addition  to organizing
construction, machinery and electrical delegations to the Middle
East, they will commission the Taiwan External Trade Development
Council to organize delegations to attend a computer exhibition
in Saudi Arabia so as to help Taiwan businesses make inroads into
the Middle East market.
