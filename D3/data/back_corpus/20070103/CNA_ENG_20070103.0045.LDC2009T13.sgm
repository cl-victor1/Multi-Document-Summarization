TAIWAN EXPORTS TO SOUTH KOREA UP 20% IN 2006: MOEA
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  Jan.  3 (CNA) 01/03/07  23:07:59 (By Sofia Wu)

Preliminary estimates show that Taiwan's exports to South Korea
posted a 20-percent growth year-on-year in 2006, far exceeding
the original target of 6 percent, a senior Ministry of Economic
Affairs (MOEA) official said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The growth in Taiwan's trade deficit with South Korea also slowed
down last year, falling from an average of 15 percent to a
20-percent increase in the past to single-digit growth in 2006,
Huang Chih-peng, director of the MOEA's Board of Foreign Trade,
said.
</P>
<P>
In the first 11 months of last year, Huang said, two-way trade
between Taiwan and South Korea amounted to US$19.91 billion, up
15.7 percent from the year- earlier level.
</P>
<P>
Of that amount, Taiwan exports to South Korea accounted for
US$6.22 billion, marking an impressive 22.9 percent increase over
the same period in 2005. In contrast, imports from South Korea
grew a mere 12.7 percent to US$13.69 billion.
</P>
<P>
During the 11-month period, Huang said, Taiwan still incurred a
trade imbalance of US$7.47 billion with South Korea, but the
trade deficit growth rate dropped to 5.4 percent, indicating that
the government's efforts to boost exports to South Korea and
narrow the bilateral trade gap have borne fruit.
</P>
<P>
Noting that after Japan, South Korea is Taiwan's second largest
source of trade imbalance, Huang said the government has given
priority to boosting exports to that country.
</P>
<P>
"Preliminary tallies show our exports to South Korea outgrew our
overall exports last year by 10 percent, " Huang said, adding
that Taiwan's overall exports posted a 12.9 percent gain in the
first 11 months of 2006.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Huang said Taiwan's exports to South Korea also outgrew
imports from that country by 10 percent during the 11-month
period.
</P>
<P>
"All these figures indicate that our export promotional efforts
have paid off," he added.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the expansion of Taiwan's semiconductor production
capacity, Huang said, the rapid appreciation of the South Korean
currency is also an important factor contributing to the
remarkable growth in Taiwan's exports to South Korea during the
past year.
</P>
<P>
For the new year, Huang said the government has set two goals for
trade with South Korea -- achieving a 10-percent export growth
while narrowing trade imabalance with that country to below the
2006 level.
