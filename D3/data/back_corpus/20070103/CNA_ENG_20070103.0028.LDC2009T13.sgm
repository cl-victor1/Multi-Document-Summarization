IMMIGRATION OFFICIALS BANNED FROM PRIVACY INVASION: OFFICIAL
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  Jan.  3 (CNA) 01/03/07  18:09:06 (By Lilian Wu)

The new immigration chief said Wednesday that he has instructed
immigration officials not to touch on private questions when
conducting interviews on foreign or mainland Chinese nationals
seeking to enter the country.
</P>
<P>
Wu Cheng-chi, director of the National Immigration Agency, made
the remarks while reporting at a Legislative Yuan committee that
was reviewing a draft revision of an immigration law.
</P>
<P>
Opposition legislators Lee Ching-hua and Chu Fong-chi of the
Kuomintang pointed out that some immigration officials have been
known to ask inappropriate questions related to the private live
and sex lives of potential visitors, saying that such questions
do not "live up to the image of a nation based on human rights
that Taiwan wants to project to the world."
</P>
<P>
Wu offered the excuse that the interview system was only put into
practice in Taiwan recently and that the immigration officials
"may not be so experienced" as their counterparts in other
countries.
</P>
<P>
But he said that he has repeatedly asked the immigration
officials  to stick to the "no questions on private matters"
principles.
</P>
<P>
"If there are still violations and they are proved to be true,
the officials will be severely dealt with," he added.
</P>
<P>
Claiming that "Chinese are good at forging documents, " Wu said
the immigration agency has spent NT$26 million (US$797,550) to
install a new biometric authentication system at the country's
airports in July.
</P>
<P>
Initially, the system will only be used for Chinese tourists, but
in the future, all foreign nationals will be subject to such
facial pattern authentification, he said, adding that the
profiling is "not discriminatory against Chinese."
</P>
<P>
Chinese citizens intending to come to Taiwan for family reunions,
long-term stay or permanent settlement will continue to be
required to have their fingerprints taken upon arrival, according
to the agency.
