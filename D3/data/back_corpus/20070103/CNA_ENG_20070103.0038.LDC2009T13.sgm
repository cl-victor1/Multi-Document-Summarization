Taipei,  Jan.  3 (CNA) 01/03/07  20:39:52 (By Luis Huang)

The Central Standing Committee of the opposition Kuomintang (KMT)
approved Wednesday the establishment of a seven-member  task
force that will be in charge of selecting candidates for Control
Yuan seats.
</P>
<P>
According to KMT spokesman Huang Yu-chen, KMT Chairman Ma Ying-
jeou will serve as convener of the task force. Members of the
panel include former Interior Minister Chang Po-ya, former United
Daily News President Chang Tso-chin and Soochow University
President Liu Chao-hsuan.
</P>
<P>
The KMT is scheduled to put advertisements in major newspapers
Friday welcoming local groups to recommend qualified individuals,
Huang said, adding that the KMT task force will select from among
the names recommended.
</P>
<P>
The KMT will present its list of candidates for Control Yuan
seats in three weeks to one month, Huang pointed out. President
Chen Shui-bian has asked all major political parties to present
their recommendations as soon as possible so that he can redraft
a nominee list to fill the long-vacant seats of the Control Yuan.
</P>
<P>
The ruling Democratic Progressive Party has decided not to
recommend any candidates, while its "pan-green camp" ally, the
Taiwan Solidarity Union, recommended its secretary-general, Lin
Chih-chia, and former Legislator Chen Cheng-lung.
</P>
<P>
The Control Yuan has been left vacant since the term of its
previous members expired on Jan. 31, 2005, mainly because of
persistent obstruction by the opposition-controlled legislature.
Opposition lawmakers had expressed dissatisfaction with the
members of the screening panel, which also included Nita Ing,
chairwoman of the Taiwan High-Speed Rail Corp., who was under
investigation by the Control Yuan, as well as Chang, the nominee
for Control Yuan president.
