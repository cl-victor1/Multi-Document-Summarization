Taipei,  Jan.  3  (CNA) 01/03/07  20:16:36 (By Deborah Kuo)

<P>
An inter-ministerial meeting will be convened in 20 days to
tackle the issue of illegal Cambodian spouses in Taiwan, Vice
Minister of the Interior Chien Tai- lang said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Chien said the meeting of officials from the Ministry of the
Interior, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and other Cabinet-level
agencies will aim at helping over 2,000 Cambodian spouses who
either used counterfeit papers of nationality to enter Taiwan or
used genuine papers of nationality to enter Taiwan to obtain
Taiwan ID cards proving that they are now naturalized Republic of
China citizens.
</P>
<P>
According to Chien Kang-tan, director-general of the Bureau of
Consular Affairs under the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) ,
more than 2,000 Cambodian spouses of Taiwan citizens have been
unable to become naturalized ROC citizens because of problems
with their papers of nationality.
</P>
<P>
If these new immigrants use genuine papers of nationality that
were issued by the Cambodian government to enter the country, it
is stipulated in those papers that they are only good for
entering the People's Republic of China.
</P>
<P>
Chien Kang-tan said the MOFA office in Vietnam's Ho Chi Minh City
has found that many papers of nationality that Cambodian women
use to marry Taiwan citizens -- papers carrying words in both
English and Chinese -- are counterfeit.
</P>
<P>
A China Times report said Wednesday that the government of
Cambodia, which maintains formal diplomatic relations with the
PRC, has prohibited Cambodian women from marrying Taiwan citizens
and forsaking their Cambodian nationalities through marriages.
</P>
<P>
Due to this fact, the paper said, cross-border marriage brokers
simply counterfeit papers of nationality for these Cambodian
women to enable them to get married to Taiwan citizens.
</P>
<P>
The MOFA also discovered as much as over a year ago that many of
the papers of nationality used by these Cambodian spouses are
counterfeit.
