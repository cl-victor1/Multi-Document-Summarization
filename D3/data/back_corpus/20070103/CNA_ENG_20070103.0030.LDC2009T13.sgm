The government's plan to use a biometric identification system
aimed only at Chinese passengers at nationwide points of entry
will not breach human rights and will heed national security,
Executive Yuan spokesman Cheng Wen-tsang said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Cheng made the remarks at a news conference following a weekly
Executive Yuan meeting.
</P>
<P>
Main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) lawmakers attacked the planned
measure by the National Immigration Agency (NIA) earlier the same
day, accusing the NIA of targeting only Chinese entering the
country -- something which they criticized as a discriminatory
move that would only be put in place in a fascist regime.
</P>
<P>
Claiming that "similar" preventive measures and national security
mechanisms have been implemented in advanced countries in Europe
and America, Cheng said that the government will not apply
inappropriate measures that would infringe upon any individual's
human rights even for national security needs.
</P>
<P>
"Everyone is free to air different viewpoints, but he or she must
not smear others or twist the facts, " Cheng argued, stressing
that "the government will certainly stick to its key principles
while seeking  to reinforce  national security  under  some
special circumstances."

During a news conference at the Legislative Yuan, KMT legislative
caucus whip Tsai Chin-lung and lawmaker Lee Ching-hua blasted the
biometric identification plan by the NIA, which was inaugurated
Tuesday after being upgraded from the Bureau of Immigration under
the Ministry of the Interior to handle increased business volume.
</P>
<P>
The NIA should apply the biometric identification measure without
discrimination to all entering foreign passengers if it wants to
safeguard the nation's security, Tsai said, accusing the
government of treating immigrant Chinese spouses and Chinese
travelers like "terrorists" for seeking to subject them and only
them to the practice.
</P>
<P>
Tsai asked the NIA to re-assess the planned measure, which is
slated to be imposed from June or July.
</P>
<P>
According to NIA Director-General Wu Chen-chi, his agency plans
to first set up a personal data bank of Chinese tourists by using
facial  pattern authentification  facilities  and  fingerprint
recognition facilities in the initial stage. The system is
expected to be launched nationwide by the end of this year and
the measure will be applied to all foreign visitors, he added.
