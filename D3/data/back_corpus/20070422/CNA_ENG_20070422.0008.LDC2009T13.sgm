</HEADLINE>

Rome,  April  21  (CNA) 04/22/07  15:56:29 (By K. C. Huang and
Deborah Kuo)
</P>
<P>
Taiwanese expatriates living in Italy resolved Saturday to
support Taiwan's bid to join the World Health Organization (WHO)
as a full member under the name "Taiwan."
</P>
<P>
At a colloquium hosted by Wu Hsiu-chi, president of the Taiwan
Chamber of Commerce in Italy, the expatriates decided that they
will write joint letters to WHO Director-General Margaret Chan
and Italy's foreign and health ministries to ask the new WHO
chief and Italian authorities to consider Taiwan's appeal and
support its bid.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the gathering, Cheng Hsin, Taiwan's representative in
Italy, stressed that medical care knows no borders and that
global disease prevention networks should be seamless.
</P>
<P>
Cheng said that based on the WHO's mission to protect the health
of all the peoples around the world, Taiwan has every right to
apply to join the WHO as a full member.
</P>
<P>
He said all 23 million people in Taiwan are entitled to good
medical care, as are other peoples around the world, and the last
thing that the Taiwanese people would like to see is that Taiwan
causes a "rift" in the global disease prevention networks.
</P>
<P>
Cheng added that due to China's obstruction each of Taiwan's
attempts to join the World Health Assembly (WHA) , the WHO's
decision-making body, even as an observer, have failed over the
past 10 years.
</P>
<P>
He called for Taiwanese people at home and abroad, as well as
friends of Taiwan, to work together to realize the goal of
Taiwan's accession to the WHO as a full member under the name of
"Taiwan" at the earliest possible day.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Chen Chang-fa, head of Italian operations of the
European Federation of Taiwan Health Alliance, said that he has
traveled to the WHO headquarters in Geneva every year since 2000
to voice support for Taiwan's bid to join the world health
regulatory body, and has also observed great pressure applied by
Beijing in its determination in barring Taiwan from joining the
WHO.
</P>
<P>
Chen said greater efforts are needed to make the international
community aware of the injustice of Taiwan's being excluded from
the WHO, and the imperative of integrating the island into the
world health system.
</P>
<P>
Also speaking at the colloquium, Chen Tai-ming, an economics
professor of postgraduate classes in Rome, called on China --
which claims to have "risen peacefully" onto the world stage --
to act like a great nation with magnanimity.
</P>
<P>
As a "great nation, " China should treat its neighbors well,
particularly Taiwan, which is like a brother of China's, said
Chen Tai-ming.
</P>
<P>
He said Taiwan's bid to join the WHO as a full member under the
name "Taiwan" may appear unrealistic at the moment, but people
should be unrelenting, pointing out that so long as they
struggle, they exist; and so long as they exist, they have
strength.
</P>
<P>
He added that he is confident that Taiwan -- a world-class
economic powerhouse with good medical care a compassionate
population -- will eventually succeed in its bid.
