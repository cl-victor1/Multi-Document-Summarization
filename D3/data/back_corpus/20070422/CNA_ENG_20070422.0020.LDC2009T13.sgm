TAIWAN, SINGAPORE SAID AT ODDS OVER ENVOY SELECTION

Singapore and Taiwan are at odds over each other's diplomatic
personnel selection, informed sources said over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
According to these sources, Singapore has rejected Taiwan's offer
to have the former chief of the General Staff serve as its new
representative to the city- state on the excuse that "his status
is too sensitive."
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, the sources went on, Singapore proposed
assigning a low- echelon official to be its top liaison officer
in Taiwan, an offer Taiwan has ruled out.
</P>
<P>
Singapore's Ministry of Foreign Affairs has so far made no
comment on all those reports, while Taiwan's Foreign Ministry
spokesman Wang Chien-yeh has also refrained from responding to
any inquiries about relevant personnel replacement speculation.
</P>
<P>
As Taiwan's representative to Singapore, Hu Wei-jen, will soon
serve out the remainder of a second and final term of office, and
Singapore is also planning to reshuffle the lineup of its mission
in Taipei, the sources said the two countries had discussed the
issue earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
According  to sources,  President Chen Shui-bian once told
Singapore representative Ker Sin Tze that his administration
planned to appoint Lee Tien- yu, a former chief of the General
Staff to succeed Hu as Taiwan's representative to Singapore.
</P>
<P>
Since Taiwan and Singapore have long cooperated in military
affairs, Ker was reportedly positive on the replacement proposal
and conveyed the message to his home country.
</P>
<P>
However, the sources said, processing for the planned personnel
reshuffle was suspended after Singapore's Minister Mentor Lee
Kuan Yew publicly criticized President Chen last month over his
"Four Wants, One Without" doctrine that Lee thought could provoke
China with its pro-independence rhetoric. Relations between
Taiwan and Singapore have since plunged to a new low, the sources
said.
</P>
<P>
Early this month, sources say, the Singapore Foreign Ministry
informed Taiwan through a formal channel of its refusal to accept
Lee as Taiwan's new envoy to the city-state, which is why
Taiwan's Presidential Office made no mention of Hu's replacement
in its recent announcement of Hu's transfer to a new post at
home.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, sources say, Singapore has informed Taiwan of its plan
to assign Stanley Loh, a press secretary of former Singaporean
Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong, as its new representative to
Taiwan, and would prefer to make the personnel changeover in
July.
</P>
<P>
In Singapore's personnel hierarchy, Loh's ranking is equivalent
to that of a deputy division chief. Unhappy with Singapore's
arrangement, sources say Taipei has politely let Singapore know
of its disapproval with Loh's appointment.
</P>
<P>
Despite the absence of formal diplomatic ties, Taipei and
Singapore have tended to maintain friendly and stable relations,
with each side traditionally posting a political heavyweight to
the other's territory to facilitate communications. However, the
rapport between the two countries has come under strain in recent
years partly because they do not see eye-to-eye on approaches
toward China.
</P>
<P>
While  Singapore  is critical  of Taiwan's  resistance  to
reconciliation with China at the expense of its sovereign status,
Taiwan  is  dismissive  of Singapore's  attempts  to harmonize
its cross-Taiwan Strait policy with China.
