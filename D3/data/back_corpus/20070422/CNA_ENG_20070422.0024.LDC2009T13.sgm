The National Youth Commission (NYC) will hold a series of
training courses for prospective female entrepreneurs around the
country beginning in May to help women set up their own business,
a NYC official said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The NYC started up the innovative program to provide women with
entrepreneurial guidance in 2000, and over the past seven years
the program has attracted 14,000 participants, the official said.
</P>
<P>
The official added that the program has so far borne fruit in
many respects, including providing leadership among government
agencies and pushing other agencies to attach greater importance
to female entrepreneurs.
</P>
<P>
For example, following the NYC lead, the Ministry of Labor
Affairs initiated the Micro-business Start-up Loan program this
year, officials pointed out.
</P>
<P>
The official quoted a survey conducted by the NYC stating that 90
percent of office ladies said they are interested in starting a
business, while only 30 percent of those applying for business
start-up loans for young entrepreneurs were women, showing that
women were more conservative in dealing with personal finances.
</P>
<P>
Other figures showed that a total of 390,000 enterprises in
Taiwan were headed by women, accounting for 34 percent of the
total, while the revenue streams of these companies comprised
only 13 percent of the total, the official said, adding that
there is still ample room for growth in terms of female business
start-up.
</P>
<P>
The NYC programs are characterized  by offering  the best
guidelines for business practices, and for launching many
activities for women in the business sector, including training
in writing operating proposals, applying for loans, marketing
products, as well as offering consultation and enterprises
diagnostic services.
</P>
<P>
The courses are slated to open May 5, and with the auspices of
the NYC, those interested in participating are required to pay
only a NT$1,000 enrollment fee, the official said, adding that
further information is available on their Web site:
