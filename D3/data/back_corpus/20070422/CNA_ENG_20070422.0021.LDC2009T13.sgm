Three traditional dance and percussion troupes will depart Taiwan
Wednesday for a 35-city performance tour in the United States and
Canada as part of the country's cultural diplomacy drive,
government sources said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The troupes will represent Taiwan during the "Asian Pacific
American Heritage Month" in the United States, a celebration of
Asians and Pacific islanders and their cultures, said Chang Fu-
mei, chairwoman of the Overseas Compatriot Affairs Commission
(OCAC).

Former U.S. President George H.W. Bush designated May as Asian
Pacific American Heritage Month in 1990 and his successor Bill
Clinton designated the second week in May as the Taiwanese
American Heritage Week in 1999. Clinton did so after lobbying by
the Formosan Association for Public Affairs, a Washington-based
group dedicated to promoting Taiwan's cause.

The three troupes -- the Jyou Tian Folk Drumming and Arts Group,
the Hongsheng Lion Dance Troupe and the Honwa Folk Dance Troupe
-- will present acrobatic dragon and lion dances, drum
performances and Taiwanese martial arts demonstrations, Chang
said.

<P>
"The troupes, composed mostly of young people, will give 35
performances in major cities across the U.S. and Canada to offer
a look at Taiwan's culture and folk arts," Chang explained.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Yang Tzu-pao said the
troupes' performance tour is the work of cultural diplomacy, a
valuable vehicle to showcase Taiwan's spirit, folk culture and
customs, and upgrade its international profile and image.
</P>
<P>
Praising the troupe members as cultural ambassadors, Yang said
they are getting Taiwan's name out there. He further said the
United States is an ideal place to embark on cultural diplomacy
since its administration has designated the second week in May as
an official celebration of Taiwan, giving Taiwan a unique
opportunity to boost cultural ties with the U.S.

According to OCAC Chairwoman Chang, some members of the troupes
come from troubled backgrounds, even being placed in juvenile
reformatory schools. The OCAC works with them closely, and all
are in night school in addition to rehearsing dance and drumming
routines by day, Chang said, adding that these individuals have
successfully transformed themselves.

<P>
A number of government agencies, including the OCAC, the Ministry
of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of Education, the Government
Information Office and the National Youth Commission, will
jointly finance the troupes' North America tour.
