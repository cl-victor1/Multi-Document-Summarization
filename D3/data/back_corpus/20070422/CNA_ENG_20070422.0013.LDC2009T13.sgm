Kaohsiung,  April 22 (CNA) 04/22/07  18:51:27 (By Deborah Kuo)

Former South African Anglican Church Archbishop Desmond Mpilo
Tutu visited the operational headquarters of the Buddhist Tzu Chi
Compassionate Relief Foundation in the southern port city of
Kaohsiung Sunday, coming away with a tremendous appreciation of
the contributions that Tzu Chi has made to the world.
</P>
<P>
Tutu, the 1984 Nobel Peace Prize winner, recognized for his
contribution to ending apartheid in South Africa and facilitating
reconciliation,  and his wife were profoundly  impressed  with
video-audio records and verbal accounts of relief work carried
out by Tzu Chi volunteers around the world over the past two
decades in an effort to save lives and comfort people traumatized
afflicted by natural disasters.
</P>
<P>
Tutu said the devotion of Tzu Chi volunteers is exemplary of the
compassion of Buddhism and unselfish service to mankind.
</P>
<P>
Tutu's wife was reduced to tears as she saw how Zulu volunteers
had reacted to the support services extended to AIDS patients in
South Africa under the leadership of Tzu Chi volunteer Pan Ming-
shui.
</P>
<P>
Overwhelmingly moved, Tutu said that South Africa is a Christian
country but that Christians there have been relatively more
arrogant than Buddhists. He called on Christians to be humble
enough to learn from and emulate what the Buddhists have done.
</P>
<P>
Tutu and his wife arrived in Taiwan April 18 for an eight-day
visit at the invitation of the Taiwan Foundation for Democracy.
</P>
<P>
The couple have visited Machangting, a former execution ground
for political prisoners adjacent to the present-day Youth Park in
western Taipei and the 228 Peace Memorial Park in downtown
Taipei, as well as meeting with Vice President Annette Lu, who
was imprisoned for nearly six years for her pro-democracy
activities during Taiwan's martial law era.
</P>
<P>
Tutu will deliver a speech April 24 on South Africa's experiences
in seeking transitional justice and ethnic reconciliation
following the end of apartheid. As head of South Africa's  Truth
and Reconciliation Commission, Tutu has played a leading role in
his country's post-apartheid campaign to heal its historical
wounds and boost ethnic harmony.
