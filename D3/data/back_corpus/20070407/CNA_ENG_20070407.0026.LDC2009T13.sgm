The Criminal Investigation Bureau (CBI) reminded people Saturday
to be aware of the criminal activity of phishing when using the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
A CBI spokesman said phishers usually send e-mails with a
hyperlink to a bogus Web site falsely claiming to be that of a
legitimate enterprise. Users are then tricked into handing over
their personal information, such as credit card numbers, which
the phishers then use to withdraw money from the users' accounts.
</P>
<P>
There have been many victims of phantom withdrawals by phishers,
the spokesman said, adding that people have been duped out of
millions of dollars in total.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that Internet users should be sure that the
Web site they are visiting is legitimate, especially if they
locate the Web sites via the use of search engines.
</P>
<P>
He also reminded users not to click onto links to unknown Web
sites, and not to open emails from unknown senders. In addition,
he recommended that people regularly change their passwords and
use authorized software as a precaution against phishing.
