WU POH-HSIUNG WINS KMT CHAIRMANSHIP BY-ELECTION
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taipei,  April 7 (CNA) 04/07/07  20:34:19 (By Lilian Wu)
</P>
<P>
Former acting chairman of the opposition Kuomintang (KMT) , Wu
Poh-hsiung, won Saturday's KMT chairmanship by-election by a
landslide.
</P>
<P>
Wu garnered 156,499 votes, or 86.97 percent of the 181,374 votes
cast, beating his only rival, Legislator Hung Hsiu-chu, who
managed 23,447 votes.
</P>
<P>
Wu said after the victory that he'll "do his utmost to promote
party solidarity after assuming his new post April 11."
</P>
<P>
Wu also said that the "new task will be the beginning of
responsibility," vowing to promote party affairs in an "impartial
manner."
</P>
<P>
The new chairman will immediately face the daunting task of
coordinating between the two KMT presidential aspirants -- former
KMT Chairman Ma Ying-jeou and Legislative Speaker Wang Jin-pyng
-- in the hopes of helping the party win the 2008 presidential
election.
</P>
<P>
The other task will be coordinating among legislative hopefuls
for the year-end legislative elections, for which a new "single-
member constituency and two votes" electoral system will be
adopted, under which the number of seats in the legislature will
be halved to 113.
</P>
<P>
Wu, 68, was widely favored to win this election given his solid
background in politics. He has served as Taoyuan County
magistrate, Taipei mayor, Minister without portfolio, minister of
the interior, secretary-general of the Presidential Office and
vice chairman of the KMT.
</P>
<P>
Wu and Hung hugged each other to show the reconciliation between
them after the election. Wu also presented Hung with a birthday
cake to wish her happiness, as Saturday happened to be her
birthday.
</P>
<P>
A total of 337,467 KMT members around Taiwan and overseas were
eligible to cast ballots in the by-election, which became
necessary after Ma resigned from his post upon being indicted in
early February for allegedly embezzling public funds.
</P>
<P>
The voter turnout rate was 53 percent, better than the estimate
of 40 percent by the KMT's original estimate in view of the
inclement weather and the fact it is a long weekend.
</P>
<P>
Hung, who came to the party's headquarters to watch the vote
count after the polls closed at 4 p.m., conceded defeat before
the count was finished as she trailed by a large margin.
</P>
<P>
Hung said she fared worse than she had expected, but she added
that "to take part is itself a victory."
</P>
<P>
Hung said that she was not satisfied with reports which described
the by- election as a "a battle between proxies, " meaning that
Ma favored Wu while she joined the election at the urging of
Wang.
</P>
<P>
She said that her relations with Wu will not change after the
election, pointing out that there weren't any clashes during the
campaign period, although she did find that there are some things
about the party that need to be improved.
</P>
<P>
She stressed that she will not bid for an at-large seat in the
year-end legislative elections, adding that between now and
December, she has several months to think about her next step or
next job.
</P>
<P>
After seeing People First Party Chairman James Soong send a
floral basket to Wu at 5 p.m. to congratulate him for his
victory, Hung also jokingly said that Soong should be fair and
also send her a floral basket to comfort the loser and wish her
happiness on her birthday.
