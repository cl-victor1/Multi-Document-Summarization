<P>
The nation's two largest air carriers are expected to see robust
profit growth after fuel price pressure eases, analysts said
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Both China Airlines (CAL) and EVA Airways Corp. reported
lackluster performance last year due to soaring oil prices,
although fuel price pressures began to ease in the fourth
quarter.
</P>
<P>
EVA Airways's revenue for 2006 totaled NT$93.9 billion (US$2.84
billion), up 6 percent from the previous year.
</P>
<P>
The second-largest air carrier reported a pre-tax profit of
NT$650 million in the fourth quarter, compared with a loss of
NT$1.47 billion in the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
EVA Airways reported an after-tax net loss of NT$1.68 billion in
2006, which was less than expected.
</P>
<P>
CAL, the largest air carrier, reported revenue of NT$121.99
billion last year, up 12 percent from the previous year. After-
tax net profit was NT$738 million, up 14.43 percent over the
previous year.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said that average oil prices this year are expected to
be lower than last year, which they said will ease pressure on
air carriers.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the prospect of more cross-strait charter flights at
times other than during the Chinese New Year, Tombsweeping Day,
Dragon Boat Festival and Mid-Autumn Festival holidays will also
be a boost for the two air carriers.
</P>
<P>
Analysts estimated that EVA Airways' revenue will be NT$92.14
billion this year, with a pre-tax net profit of NT$1.09 billion,
while CAL will register a profit of NT$2.08 billion for the year.
