The Grass Mountain Chateau on scenic Ynagmingshan in suburban
Taipei, which was the late President Chiang Kai-shek's  first
official residence in Taiwan,  was partially destroyed by a fire
late Friday, Taipei City government officials said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Initial investigations showed that the chateau's main exhibition
hall spanning about 660 square meters had been completely
engulfed in flames in the fire, which broke out at around 0: 20
a.m., municipal firefighting department officials said. They
added that the cause of the fire has yet to be determined.
</P>
<P>
The department's Yangming outpost sent fire engines to the scene
immediately after receiving an emergency call from security
guards at the chateau, the officials said, adding that as the
flames were very high, more fire gear from neighboring Shihlin,
Shihpei and Huagang outposts were sent to help put out the fire
which was brought under control at around 1:30 a.m.
</P>
<P>
According to the officials, their firefighting efforts were
impeded by several factors, including a water shortage, heavy
night fog, and the area's rugged terrain.
</P>
<P>
The city government has listed the 87-year-old chateau as a
protected heritage site. The chateau was built in 1920 by Taiwan
Sugar Corp. in preparation for a visit by then-Japanese Crown
Prince Hirohito. Historical records show that Hirohito stayed at
the house for only one hour and 50 minutes. The chateau later
served as a spa villa for social celebrities during the period of
Japanese colonial rule.

<P>
In December 1949, the Republic of China government moved its seat
to Taipei, and President Chiang Kai-shek chose to stay at the
chateau,  making it Taiwan's first presidential residence. The
president and his wife lived at the house until May 1950 when a
new house was built in Taipei's Shihlin district. The chateau
later served as the first couple's summer villa.

<P>
As several major government decisions were made during the
Chiang's stay at the chateau, the Taipei City government decided
Dec. 19, 2002 to list the house as a building of historical
significance and officially named it the "Grass Mountain
Chateau."
</P>
<P>
The building has since served as a cultural activity center that
encompasses an exhibition hall, a conference room, a performance
stage, a restaurant and reception area, and a management center.
the mid-night fire mainly damaged the exhibition hall and the
restaurant and reception  area,  known  as Meilu Hall and Yingho
Hall, respectively.
</P>
<P>
Municipal police authorities have begun investigating the cause
of the fire.
