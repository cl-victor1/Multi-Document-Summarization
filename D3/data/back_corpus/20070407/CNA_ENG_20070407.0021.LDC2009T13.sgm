PRESIDENT VISITS TAICHUNG FOR BRIEFING ON SHUINAN DEVELOPMENT
PLAN

Taipei,  April 7 (CNA) 04/07/07  19:18:33 (By Elizabeth Hsu)

President Chen Shui-bian visited Taichung City, central Taiwan,
Saturday with Premier Su Tseng-chang to receive a briefing from
the city government on plans to develop the vast plot of land
where the old Shuinan Airport once stood.
</P>
<P>
The development project, formed after the airport facilities were
relocated to the Chingchuankang Airport in March 2004, thus
leaving approximately 250 hectares of land vacant, drew Chen's
attention after Richard Li, a Hong Kong business tycoon whose
father is Asia's richest man, Li Ka-shing, appeared interested in
the project during his visit to the site of the former airport
last month.
</P>
<P>
Talking about the development project, Taichung Mayor Jason Hu
said work on carrying out the project has long been put off
because of the problem of covering the cost of at least NT$7
billion (US$211.64 million) of work to relocate the Air Force
second logistic command center away from the Shuinan airport
site.
</P>
<P>
The Shuinan airport was built during the period of Japanese
colonial rule of the island to serve as a military airport. It
was taken over after the end of World War Two by the ROC Air
Force, which established the logistic command center and an
aviation industrial development center at the airport.
</P>
<P>
From that time until 1980, all Taiwan-produced aircraft were
manufactured and underwent tests at the airport, according to the
city government. As Taichung expanded,  the airport's relative
location shifted from the outskirts to the center of the city. It
is now situated  near the Central Taiwan Science Park, Fengchia
University and the Aerospace Industrial Development Corp., which
designed and built Taiwan's Indigenous Defense Fighters.
</P>
<P>
As the airport's existence was often blamed for hindering the
city's land traffic and urban development, the city government
kicked off efforts after the relocation of the airport facilities
in 2004 to develop the place into a modern urban center that has
been planned to house a university city, a trading exhibition
center, an exclusive residential district and a forest park.
</P>
<P>
After the briefing, Hu cited President Chen as saying that the
central government will do something to address the problem that
has hindered the development project from proceeding for years.
