MORE DOCTORS USE FINE NEEDLES TO CHECK CANCEROUS LUMPS

Singapore,  Oct. 6 (CNA) (By Conrad Lu)
</P>
<P>
More doctors in Singapore are turning to the use of a fine needle to
find out whether tumors are cancerous or not.
</P>
<P>
Called Fine Needle Aspiration (FNA) biopsy, the technique uses a very
fine needle to obtain a tiny part of the lump tissue which is then
mounted on a glass slide for evaluation under the microscope.
</P>
<P>
Results are usually obtained within hours.
</P>
<P>
Conventional biopsy, on the other hand, involves the surgical removal
of the lump, which usually requires general anesthesia and
hospitalization. Results usually take a few days to obtain.
</P>
<P>
Not surprisingly, the number of FNA biopsies in Singapore have been
increasing steadily by about 10 percent annually since the technique
was first introduced in the late 1980s, said Dr. Angela Chong, a
spokeswoman for a three-day FNA workshop, which ended here on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The workshop, attended by more than 60 pathologists from around the
region, was organized by the Chapter of Pathologists, the Academy of
Medicine and the Singapore Society of Pathologists.
</P>
<P>
Last year, about 4,000 FNA biopsies were done in government and
private hospitals in Singapore, many of which were biopsies for
thyroid and breast growths, she said.

<P>
The Singapore National University Hospital has one of the largest
published series of fine-needle biopsies of the liver in the world --
92 liver cancers were diagnosed using the method between 1985 and
1992.
</P>
<P>
Fine-needle aspiration biopsy is widely used in most developed
countries.
