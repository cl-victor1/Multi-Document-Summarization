KMT CHAIRMAN VISITS PREDECESSOR

Taipei, Feb. 9 (CNA) 02/09/07  19:55:57 (By Flor Wang)

Main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Ma Ying-jeou met his
predecesor, KMT Honorary Chairman Lien Chan, Friday, stirring up
speculation about the meeting at a time when the prosecution
authorities are reportedly soon to indict him over embezzlement
charges.
</P>
<P>
Both Ma and Lien were reluctant to answer questions from
reporters after their tete-a-tete -- the latest move by Ma after
an interview  with  a newspaper Thursday  and  a visit  to the
anti-corruption task force at the Taiwan High Court Prosecutor's
Office a day prior to that. The prosecutors have concluded a
probe into the case related to Ma's alleged misuse of special
municipal fees allocated for his discretionary use when he served
as mayor of Taipei from 1998-2006.
</P>
<P>
According to KMT Secretary-General Wu Den-yih, Ma remained
unchanged on his decision to resign from the party chairmanship
if he is indicted, but Wu was reserved about the question of
whether Ma will take part in future elections for public office
if he is indicted.
</P>
<P>
Although Ma's public approval ratings have recently dropped due
to the embezzlement allegations, Wu pointed out that Ma still
enjoys a high level of public backing that far exceeds that
enjoyed by the various possible presidential aspirants of the
ruling Democratic Progressive Party.
</P>
<P>
More than half the respondents to several public opinion polls
conducted in recent months have expressed support for Ma for
president in the 2008 elections, Wu claimed.
</P>
<P>
According to KMT spokesman Su Chun-pin, Ma and Lien reached an
agreement during the meeting that the KMT must be fully united if
it wants to secure victory in the next presidential race in the
face of the challenge of the "pan-green camp" of the ruling DPP
and the Taiwan Solidarity Union.
