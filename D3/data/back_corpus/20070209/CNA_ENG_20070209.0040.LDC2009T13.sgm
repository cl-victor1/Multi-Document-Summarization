<P>
The Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) will hold talks Feb. 13
with representatives of leading commercial and industrial groups
on a package of draft bills stipulating measures to promote
industrial upgrades, MOEA officials said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The talks, to be hosted by Minister of Economic Affairs Chen
Ruey-long, will be part of the government's efforts to work out a
new policy on Taiwan's industrial development given the upcoming
2009 expiration  of the existing Statute for Upgrading
Industries, officials said.
</P>
<P>
According to the MOEA, the draft bills, designed to cover every
possible legal field concerning industrial upgrades, will include
a basic law regulating industrial development, regulations
concerning investment incentives and supplements, as well as a
statute on the establishment and management of industrial parks.
</P>
<P>
The planned basic law will provide guidelines around which the
government is to form policies and regulations  on industrial
development, focusing on issues such as the knowledge-based
economy, the import and training of talented personnel,
technology transfer and proliferation, development of sustainable
industry, international cooperation, and cooperation between the
academic and industrial sectors, according to the MOEA Industrial
Development Bureau in charge of drafting the bills.
</P>
<P>
The bureau is expected to complete the drafts by the end of June,
and is scheduled to submit them to the Executive Yuan by July or
August for review before they are delivered to the Legislative
Yuan in 2008 for approval.
