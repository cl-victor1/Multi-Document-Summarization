LAWMAKERS THREATEN TO GIVE CHUNGHWA POST HARD TIME OVER NAME
CHANGE

Taipei,   Feb.  9  (CNA) 02/09/07  18:12:31 (By Deborah Kuo)

Opposition People First Party (PFP) lawmakers threatened Friday
to give Chunghwa Post a hard time should the state-owned postal
service insist on changing the company's name without the consent
of its staff and the legislature.
</P>
<P>
PFP Legislator Lee Hung-chun,  who doubles as the party's
spokesman, said that although Chunghwa Post has changed to
corporate operations, it is still a state- owned company subject
to Legislative Yuan screening and approval for its annual budget.
</P>
<P>
Lee warned Chunghwa Post not be so confident over the company
name change issue, claiming that the issue's fate is still up to
the legislature.
</P>
<P>
Lee said he agreed with remarks made by Chunghwa Post labor union
leader Tsai Liang-chuan earlier in the day in which Tsai argued
that the union sees nothing good about changing the name of the
company in terms of increasing its business, adding that it is
regrettable that the issue of changing the names of state
enterprises is being used for political purposes.
</P>
<P>
Tsai claimed that the name change will probably make Chunghwa
Post a fully privatized company overnight without the workers'
interests being protected.
</P>
<P>
He also lambasted Chunghwa Post Chairman Lai Chin-chi for
supporting the name change drive and implementing the plan
without consulting anybody or notifying any of the company's
workers in advance.
</P>
<P>
Lee said that when the new legislative session begins later this
month, the PFP will be instrumental in boycotting Chunghwa Post's
budget for the coming year, as a tit-for-tat measure over the
name change issue.
</P>
<P>
Chunghwa Post Co. was planning to change its name Friday to show
its Taiwan identity, part of a wave of name changes among state
enterprises under a name change campaign advocated by President
Chen Shui-bian.
</P>
<P>
The word "Chunghwa" means China. A new Chinese name translated as
"Taiwan Post Co." was planned to be applied after Chunghwa Post's
board meeting passed the proposal Friday, although an official
English name had yet to be decided upon.
</P>
<P>
Lee likened the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) government's
name change campaign to the Chinese Cultural Revolution launched
by Mao Zedong, claiming that the name change drive is a Taiwan
version of a cultural revolution against political foes
camouflaged by the advocacy of Taiwan independence.
</P>
<P>
PFP Legislator Lin Hui-kuan called for Chunghwa Post and the
ruling DPP not to play the "magic of names" any longer and
instead do something useful to benefit the people.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Economic Affairs also announced last month a plan
to change the name of the state-run Chinese Petroleum Corp. (CPC)
to "CPC, Taiwan," and China Shipbuilding Corp. (CSBC) to "CSBC,
Taiwan."
</P>
<P>
The opposition Kuomintang has accused the DPP of "ruling the
nation with ideology" in a bid to blot out the last vestiges of
China's influence from the country.
