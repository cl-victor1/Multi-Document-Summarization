The Environmental Protection Administration (EPA) will launch a
one-week national "clean-up" campaign Saturday ahead of Chinese
New Year, one of the most important annual festivals in Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
The clean-up campaign, slated for Feb. 10-16, is designed around
the traditional notion of sweeping the old away to make way for
the new, EPA officials said Friday. It is a custom in Chinese
society to clean up the home in preparation for the Lunar New
Year, which falls on Feb. 18 this year.

<P>
During the clean-up campaign, people can dispose of any large
waste items, such as old furniture, at designated sites at
specific times regulated by local governments for recycling,
according to the EPA.
</P>
<P>
While cleaning up indoors, people should check for any possible
breeding spots for disease-carrying mosquitoes in or around their
homes, the EPA officials suggested. They also reminding people to
clean up the public area within four meters around their homes,
including road surfaces and gullies, as stipulated by the law.
