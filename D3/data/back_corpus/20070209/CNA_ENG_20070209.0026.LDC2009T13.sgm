Hog breeders around Taiwan signed a self-discipline convention
Friday as a pledge to provide consumers with pork from healthy
hogs amid the public's shunning of pork and processed pork
products out of food safety concerns in the wake of reports of
meat from sick and dead hogs being sold in local markets.
</P>
<P>
Pork sales have been affected countrywide since police cracked
down on illicit trading of diseased and dead hogs in central and
southern Taiwan in early February.
</P>
<P>
News reports have said the illicit sales of substandard pork from
sick and dead hogs have been going on for many years, with buyers
including vendors at traditional markets, restaurant operators
and food processing businesses around Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
The signing took place at the Bureau of Animal and Plant Health
Inspection and Quarantine under the Council of Agriculture (COA),
and was witnessed by COA officials. During the ceremony,
representatives of the convention endorsers vowed to deal with
the bodies of hogs hit by sudden death through a certified
process from delivery to cremation or burying.
</P>
<P>
The signatories also urged local hog breeders to support the
practice of applying for life insurance for their livestock as
part of efforts to stem illicit trading of sick and dead hogs,
while suggesting that judicial authorities impose more severe
punishment on illegal slaughterhouse operators and meat
transporters.
