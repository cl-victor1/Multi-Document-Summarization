CAA CHIEF INDICTED OVER AIRPORT NOISE INSULATION SCANDAL
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  Feb.  9 (CNA) 02/09/07  12:16:41 (By Sofia Wu)

<P>
Chang Kuo-cheng, director-general of the Civil Aeronautics
Administration (CAA) ,  has been indicted on corruption charges
for his suspected role in a Taoyuan International Airport noise
insulation subsidies scandal.
</P>
<P>
The Taoyuan Prosecutor's Office indicted Chang and 28 other CAA
and airport officials as well as borough and village chiefs in
northern Taoyuan County Thursday after more than two years of
investigations into the case.
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors are seeking a seven-year prison sentence for Chang,
who was released on NT$1 million bail after being questioned
regarding the case last year.
</P>
<P>
The scandal involving noise insulation subsidies for residents in
the vicinity of the Taoyuan International Airport, Taiwan's main
gateway, broke in May 2004 after prosecution authorities received
tip-offs that many subsidy recipients did not use the money to
install air-conditioners as soundproofing.
</P>
<P>
Subsequent  prosecutorial  investigations  showed  that some
households managed to claim soundproofing subsidies even after
they had relocated to other areas, while many other households
used fake pictures to mislead transportation ministry officials
into believing that their homes had been equipped with air-
conditioners to qualify for soundproofing subsidies even though
they had not.
</P>
<P>
As residents could apply for subsidies by just producing pictures
showing their homes were equipped  with air-conditioners,  the
indictment said some air- conditioner suppliers assisted
residents in faking pictures through introductions by borough or
village chiefs who were given NT$2,000 to NT$4,000 in commission
for each such deal.
</P>
<P>
The indictment said that although the then-Taoyuan Airport
Administration's environmental  section chief had informed his
superiors of possible irregularities or profiteering practices in
the process, Chang shut his eyes to the warning and continued the
practice of requiring residents to just produce pictures to
receive soundproofing subsidies.
</P>
<P>
According to the indictment, the scandal caused a huge waste of
taxpayer's money.
</P>
<P>
Chang's deputy Wang Teh-ho and CAA Chief Secretary Wei Sheng-chih
were  also indicted  on corruption  charges,  with prosecutors
recommending a six-year prison sentence for each of them.
</P>
<P>
Seven Taoyuan Airport Administration officials, including Deputy
Director Liu Chuang-sheng, were also indicted on similar charges.
Prosecutors are seeking a 12-year prison sentence for Liu.
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors also indicted a number of former and incumbent
village and borough chiefs and are seeking eight-year  prison
sentences for each of them.
</P>
<P>
As to residents who had claimed noise insulation subsidies
without actually installing soundproofing equipment, prosecutors
said they will be indicted later on charges of fraud.
