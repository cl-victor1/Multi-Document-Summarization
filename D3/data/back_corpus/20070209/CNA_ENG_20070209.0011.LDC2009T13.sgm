MND AWAITS INSTRUCTIONS ON HANDLING OF LATE PRESIDENTS'
MAUSOLEUMS
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

Taipei,  Feb. 9 (CNA) 02/09/07  14:37:23 (By Y.F. Low)
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of National Defense (MND) has not received any
instructions from the Cabinet with regard to disbanding an office
in charge of maintaining the mausoleums of the late Presidents
Chiang Kai-shek and Chiang Ching-kuo, a ministry official said
Friday.
</P>
<P>
Huang Yi-ping, deputy chief of the general staff for personnel,
said that basically, the office will only be disbanded after the
Chiang family has agreed to and completed the removal of the late
presidents' remains from the mausoleums for permanent burial.
</P>
<P>
However, if any instructions are received from the Cabinet on the
disbandment of the office, the ministry will assess the
feasibility of doing so, Huang said.
</P>
<P>
Huang made the remarks during a public hearing on the issue held
by several opposition Kuomintang (KMT) legislators led by John
Chiang, son of Chiang Ching- kuo.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, a group of ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)
legislators requested that the Cabinet make an announcement by
Feb. 28 to disband the mausoleum maintenance office under the MND
and scrap the budget for the maintenance of the mausoleums
located in Taoyuan County's Tzuhu and Touliao, respectively,
where the two late presidents' remains are temporarily interred.
</P>
<P>
Pointing out that the government has prepared new tombs for the
two late presidents at Taipei County's Wuchihshan Military
Cemetery, the legislators said the Chiang family should make a
decision by Feb. 28 on whether to remove the remains of the two
late presidents.
</P>
<P>
They argued that it lacks any legal basis and is a waste of
taxpayers' money for the government to earmark a budget of more
than NT$70 million per year to maintain the mausoleums, including
the personnel expenses for 35 staff, 70 military police and 24
honor guards posted at the facilities.
</P>
<P>
The proposal to disband the mausoleum maintenance office is among
a series of measures put forth by the DPP recently to "eliminate
the remnants of authoritarian rule" associated with Chiang Kai-
shek -- whom the DPP claims was the key perpetrator behind the
228 Incident of 1947 in which thousands of people were massacred
by KMT troops in suppression of a rebellion against KMT rule in
Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Also Friday, John Chiang said he will take legal action against
DPP Chairman Yu Shyi-kun if he does not apologize within one week
for the claim.
</P>
<P>
He alleged  that although  the DPP claims  it is against
authoritarianism, the party is turning itself into a "Nazist"
party under Yu's leadership.
