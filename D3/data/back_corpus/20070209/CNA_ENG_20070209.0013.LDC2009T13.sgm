The country's designation -- the Republic of China -- should be
changed, as it is confused with China's formal name and "fails to
reflect Taiwan's historic truth," Examination Yuan President Yao
China-wen claimed Friday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a colloquium on Taiwan's historic status and future
diplomatic strategy, Yao, a well-known Taiwan independence
advocate, said the country of Taiwan -- whose official name is
the Republic of China -- is not the same country that uses the
same designation whose capital had been in Peking, Nanking and
Chungching prior to 1949, nor the regime currently ruling China,
whose formal name is the People's Republic of China.
</P>
<P>
Claiming that the Republic of China is "too easy to be confused"
in the international community with the People's Republic of
China, Yao said a national name change as President Chen Shui-
bian has championed recently is "a must" for the country.
</P>
<P>
According to Yao, the Taiwan people have been given too many
"distorted facts and untrue concepts" by the former Kuomintang
government, leading some of the country's people to have the
wrong perceptions  about  Taiwan's  history  and its status  in
the international community.
</P>
<P>
The colloquium was sponsored by the Taiwan International Studies
Association.
