Taipei,  Feb. 9 (CNA) 02/09/07  17:28:18 (By Flor Wang)

<P>
Vice President Annette Lu called Friday for public support for
the government's current campaign to change state-owned
enterprises' name to avoid confusion with their Chinese
counterparts, saying that it is essential to correct "mistakes
left by history."
</P>
<P>
Lu made the comments while answering questions from reporters
before attending a seminar on Taiwan's historical standing and
its foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
Quoting President Chen Shui-bian's stated resolve to make Taiwan
a complete, normal and great nation, Lu said that the public
should back the government's efforts to "correct the historical
mistake in a piecemeal fashion" by taking out the words "China"
or "Chinese" from the names of state-run companies in the initial
stage.
</P>
<P>
Despite Chen promised in his 2000 and 2004 inaugural speeches
that Taiwan's official title will not be changed during his
tenure, Lu said that Taiwan's people should back the government's
ongoing name change campaign, which has begun with some state-run
companies, such as Chinese Petroleum Corp., China Shipbuilding
Corp. and Chunghwa Post.
</P>
<P>
In response to accusations by opponents that the name change
drive will cost the government a fortune to carry out, Lu
contended that it is worthwhile to do so and it will help Taiwan
gain a solid ground in the international arena over the long
term.
</P>
<P>
The name change campaign is "not an ideological conflict," rather
it is an issue that affects national dignity and which requires
nationwide efforts to achieve and safeguard, Lu claimed.
</P>
<P>
The campaign is backed by the ruling Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) but opposed by the opposition "pan-blue alliance, " with
DPP Chairman Yu Shyi-kun displaying full support for the drive at
the party's weekly Central Standing Committee meeting Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Premier Su Tseng-chang claimed that the campaign is
unlikely to cost the government a fortune and will not affect
workers' rights and interests at the state-run companies.
</P>
<P>
Su appealed for widespread public support for the drive and
claimed  that  the move will help sharpen  Taiwan  companies'
competitiveness by avoiding unnecessary confusion in the world
market.
</P>
<P>
Claiming that the name change campaign should have been carried
out long ago, Su promised to implement the mission through due
legal process.
