President Chen Shui-bian said Friday that he supports  exchanges
between Taiwan museums and internationally well-known museums.
</P>
<P>
Chen made the remarks while meeting with Michael Spindelegger,
the second president of Austria's parliament, who was in Taipei
to attend a ceremony marking the completion of a reconstruction
project for the National Palace Museum (NPM) in suburban Taipei.
</P>
<P>
Chen said he was glad to see that Austria's art history museum
(Kunsthistorisches Museum Wien) will hold an exhibition at the
National Palace Museum in October, while several Taiwanese
museums, including NPM, will exhibit in Kunsthistorisches Museum
Wien next February.

<P>
According to Chen, the Quai Branly Museum in Paris, which was
established last year under the promotion of France's President
Jacques Chirac, also has a collection of treasures of some of
Taiwan's aboriginal tribes.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the NPM is planning to construct a branch in southern
Taiwan, Chen expressed gratitude to France's Ecole Francaise d
'Extreme-Orient for its help in the planning.
</P>
<P>
He also expressed hope that France's Guimet Museum, which focuses
on collections of art from East Asian countries, will help the
NPM in the construction and exhibition affairs of its southern
branch.
