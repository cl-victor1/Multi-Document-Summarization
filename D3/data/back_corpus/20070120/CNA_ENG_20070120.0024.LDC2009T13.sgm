PREMIER ASKS FOR EXTRA LEGISLATIVE SESSION
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taipei,  Jan. 20 (CNA) 01/20/07  20:11:27 (By Lilian Wu)

Premier Su Tseng-chang said Saturday that he had asked
Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng to help convene an
extraordinary legislative session "so as to live up to the
expectations of the people."
</P>
<P>
Su made the remarks after the central government budget for 2007
failed to pass in the legislative session that ended a day
earlier due to incessant bickering between the ruling and
opposition parties over a proposed revision of the composition of
the Central Election Commission (CEC).
</P>
<P>
The 17 members of the CEC are currently named by the premier, but
the main opposition Kuomintang wanted the format changed so that
parties could be represented  in proportion to the number of
legislative seats they hold.
</P>
<P>
Su said this was the first time the central government budget had
failed to pass within the legislative session and has affected
the operations of the government tremendously.
</P>
<P>
Su criticized KMT Chairman Ma Ying-jeou for putting the CEC
organic bill at the top of the agenda while listing the central
government budget as the 28th bill, a move he claimed was
designed to serve Ma's own "selfish ends."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Ma said the KMT does not rule out the possibility of
holding an extra legislative session, but added that the
provisional session should proceed according to the original
agenda.
</P>
<P>
He also condemned ruling party legislators  for physically
attacking Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng, locking the
door to Wang's room and stonewalling all bills, including the
central government budget bill.
</P>
<P>
"What other ruling parties would deal with the legislature in
such a way?" Ma asked.
</P>
<P>
Ma pointed out that the term of the current CEC members will
expire in June, but said that if what he claimed is the CEC's
tilting in favor of the ruling party continues after that, the
KMT will not trust it to deal with elections impartially.
