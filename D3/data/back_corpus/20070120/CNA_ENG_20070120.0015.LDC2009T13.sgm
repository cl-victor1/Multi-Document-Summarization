LEGISLATURE SPEAKER CONDEMNS LEGISLATIVE CHAOS
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  Jan.  20 (CNA) 01/20/07  17:44:28 (By Lilian Wu)

Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng condemned Saturday the
chaos on the last day of the legislative session a day earlier
and expressed  regret that the central government budget for 2007
was not passed.
</P>
<P>
Wang issued the statement in the wee hours of Saturday shortly
after the session ended fruitlessly due to the incessant
bickering between the ruling and the opposition legislators over
a proposed revision of the composition of the Central Election
Commission (CEC). The current 17 members of the CEC are named by
the premier, but the main opposition Kuomintang wanted the format
to be changed so that parties could be represented in proportion
to the number of legislative seats they hold.
</P>
<P>
Wang said he deeply regretted that the budget of the central
government for 2007 failed to pass, but added that according to
related regulations, it will only affect certain new budgets and
will not affect other budgets or the public livelihood.
</P>
<P>
On whether to convene an extraordinary legislative session, Wang
said that if the legislative caucuses do make the request, an
informal coordination meeting will be held Jan. 29. If an extra
session does take place, it will be Jan. 30-31.
</P>
<P>
In an unusually stern tone, Wang also accused legislators of the
ruling Democratic Progressive Party of being "outrageous" when he
met with the media after announcing the recess of the
legislature.
</P>
<P>
He described the DPP legislators as repeatedly adopting the
"irrational" approach  of  filibustering  and  paralyzing  the
proceedings, which he claimed raised questions about "the norms"
of how a legislator should behave.
</P>
<P>
Wang was hit in the mouth by a book and was almost hit by a
flying shoe during a pushing and shoving match. The door of a
room at his disposal was locked with a motorcycle lock and he had
to use a "stealth" microphone to proceed after his original
microphone was snatched. He insisted, however, that he was not
authorized by law to summon the police to the legislature.
</P>
<P>
Although legislators from the opposition "pan-blue alliance" had
petitioned for Wang to call in the police to maintain order, he
said the legislators should exercise self-restraint and that he
"could not and should not call in the police, as doing so would
not resolve the problems, as past experience has shown."
</P>
<P>
Wang urged legislators  across the party spectrum to deal
"rationally" with the screening of controversial bills, such as
the CEC organic bill.
</P>
<P>
He cited the bill of the National Communications Commission (NCC)
as an example, saying that it only passed the legislature after
three violent clashes and nine rounds of coordination.
