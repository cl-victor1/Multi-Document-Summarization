THSR HAS OFF-PEAK FARE PLAN

Taipei,  Jan. 20 (CNA) 01/20/07  20:17:57 (By Lilian Wu)
</P>
<P>
An official of the Taiwan High Speed Rail Corp. (THSR) confirmed
Saturday that the company has a plan for an off-peak fare for the
nation's first bullet train service.
</P>
<P>
Ou Chin-der, THSR chief executive officer, made the remarks after
reports said the Ministry of Transportation and Communications
(MOTC) may ask the THSR to discount fares to attract more
passengers after poor ticket sale of the full- price tickets.
</P>
<P>
The THSR began its bullet train service between Banciao, Taipei
County and Zuoying, Kaohsiung County Jan. 5. The discount fares
were originally scheduled to end Jan. 14 but were later extended
to Jan. 31 due to some embarrassing technical glitches,
particularly with the ticketing system.
</P>
<P>
Full-price tickets for next month went on sale Friday, but less
than 100 tickets were sold, although Ou noted that the sales of
only one day will not gauge the real situation.
</P>
<P>
Ou confirmed that the company does have an off-peak fare plan but
declined to disclose when the plan would be unveiled.
</P>
<P>
The standard fare for the Taipei-Kaohsiung service is NT$1,490
(US$45.4) and NT$2,440 for business class.
</P>
<P>
"The most urgent task is to get the ticketing system stabilized
and upgrade the service quality," Ou said.
</P>
<P>
According to the THSR, judging from the current schedules, the
occupancy rate of the bullet train should be over 65 percent to
be considered normal, and that if the occupancy rate reaches 75
percent, then the company will have to add additional trains.
</P>
<P>
If the occupancy rate is less than 30 percent, its operation
strategy will be seriously affected, THSR officials estimated.
</P>
<P>
The 345-km railway cuts travel time between Taipei and the
southern port city of Kaohsiung from four-and-a-half hours to
just 90 minutes.
