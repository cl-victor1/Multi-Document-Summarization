Taiwan has made "moderate progress" in combating human
trafficking over the past six months since it was put on the
Special Watch List for the problem, according to an interim
assessment released Friday by the U.S. State Department.
</P>
<P>
The interim assessment evaluates the performance of 39 countries
placed on the Special Watch List in the department's 2006
Trafficking in Persons (TIP) Report published last June.
</P>
<P>
The department said some of the countries could be further
downgraded in the 2007 TIP Report to be published in June if
their anti-trafficking efforts this year are determined to be
inadequate.
</P>
<P>
In the 2006 report, Taiwan was placed on the "Tier 2 Watch List"
for its failure to show evidence of increasing efforts over the
past year to address human trafficking, particularly the serious
level of forced labor and sexual servitude among legally
migrating Southeast Asian contract workers and brides.
</P>
<P>
According to the 2007 Interim Assessment, the Taiwan authorities
failed to prosecute any offenses of trafficking for forced labor
or domestic servitude, despite evidence of a significant
trafficking problem among the 350,000 Thai, Indonesian,
Vietnamese and Filipino workers in Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Also, it said the Taiwan authorities failed to make progress in
developing a system to identify and protect foreign workers who
have been subjected  to conditions  of forced labor or
involuntary servitude.
</P>
<P>
However, it mentioned significant improvements made by the
Council of Labor Affairs (CLA) in its policies and regulations
governing the terms and conditions of work for foreign laborers
in Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
These include bilateral agreements reached with Indonesia, the
Philippines, Thailand and Vietnam to allow foreign domestic
workers to apply directly to the CLA for work instead of going
through Taiwan labor brokerage agencies that are known for
exploitative practices, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, in an effort to prevent trafficking of Southeast Asian
women through fraudulent marriages, the Interior Ministry banned
the registration of new international marriage firms based in
Taiwan and strengthened regulations and monitoring of existing
firms, while the Ministry of Foreign Affairs tightened the
screening of Southeast Asian women applying for visas as "brides"
of Taiwan men, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Besides Taiwan, the other 38 countries evaluated in the interim
assessment are Algeria, Argentina, Armenia, Bahrain, Belize,
Bolivia, Brazil, Cambodia, Central African Republic, China,
Cyprus, Djibouti, Ecuador, Egypt, Equatorial Guinea, Finland,
India, Indonesia, Israel, Jamaica,  Kenya, Kuwait, Laos, Libya,
Macau, Malawi, Malaysia, Mauritania, Mexico, Oman, Peru, Qatar,
Russia, Singapore, South Africa, Switzerland, Togo, and the
United Arab Emirates.
