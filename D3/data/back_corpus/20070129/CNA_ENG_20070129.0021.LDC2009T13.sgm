Taiwan's potential competitiveness ranked 19th among the world's
50 major economies in 2006, up two notches from the previous year
to share the same ranking as South Korea, according to the
results of a survey released Monday by the Japan Center for
Economic Research.
</P>
<P>
The top three places went to Hong Kong, Singapore and the United
States, in that order, while Japan took 12th and China ranked
35th.

The research institute has since 2000 conducted annual surveys on
50 major economies around the world based on eight criteria:
internationalization, business efficiency, education,  financial
system, government efficiency, technological development, social
infrastructure and information technology.
</P>
<P>
For 2006, Taiwan ranked 18th in terms of internationalization,
25th in terms of business efficiency, 16th in terms of education,
18th in terms of financial system, 43rd in terms of government
efficiency, seventh in terms of technological development, sixth
in terms of social infrastructure and 13th in terms of
information technology.
</P>
<P>
Taking the top position for the second consecutive year, Hong
Kong ranked first or second in most of the eight criteria, with
the exception of education and technological development.
</P>
<P>
The survey shows that Japan made progress in terms of business
efficiency and internationalization in 2006, but its performance
in government efficiency, social infrastructure and financial
system was less good.
</P>
<P>
If Hong Kong is included, China's potential competitiveness
ranked 33rd in 2000 and advanced to 30th in 2005, but dropped to
32nd in 2006, according to the survey.
