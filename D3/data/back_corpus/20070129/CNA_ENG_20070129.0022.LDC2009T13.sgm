MAC TO DEAL WITH TAIWAN BUSINESSMEN TAKING POLITICAL POSTS IN
CHINA

Taipei,  Jan.  29 (CNA) 01/29/07  17:00:31 (By Deborah Kuo)

The Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) will look into the case of
Taiwan businessmen taking up posts as members of a city committee
of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC)
and mete out penalties accordingly, an MAC official said Monday.
</P>
<P>
MAC Vice Chairman Liu Teh-hsun said the three businessmen, who
have reportedly been elected members of the CPPCC Dongguan city
committee, will be dealt with in accordance with the Statute
Governing the Relations Between the People of the Taiwan Area and
the Mainland Area if they remain Republic of China passport
holders.

<P>
Under a stipulation of the statute -- which prohibits ROC
citizens from taking up political party, military, administrative
roles in China or being members of any Chinese organizations that
are established for political purposes -- the three Dongguan-
based businessmen will be fined between NT$100,000 and NT$500,000
if the report is verified, Liu said.

Meanwhile, on the recent appointment of Sally Wu -- formerly a
Taiwan television anchorwoman and currently a vice president of
the Hong Kong-based Phoenix Satellite Television Co. -- as a
member of the CPPCC 9th Guangdong provincial committee, Liu
described the appointment as "political maneuvering" by Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Liu said Beijing's  plot to allow Taiwan  businessmen  or
celebrities to become members of the rubber-stamp CPPCC will not
hide the "party-leading-politics" truth in China and shows that
China has a long way to go before democracy is implemented there.
