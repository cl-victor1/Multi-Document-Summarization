The consumer confidence index (CCI) dropped in January, with
analysts suggesting that the decline was the result of fallout
from a spate of irregularities involving the Asian Pacific Rebar
Group, according to the results of a survey released Monday.

<P>
The Research Center for Taiwan Economic Development of National
Central University (NCU) conducted the CCI survey Jan. 18-21 on
2,347 randomly-selected adults around the country by telephone.
</P>
<P>
The survey showed the January CCI registered at 67.43 points,
down 1.02 points from the month-earlier level.
</P>
<P>
Six major consumer confidence indicators declined in January,
with the indicator measuring consumers' assessment regarding "the
best time to purchase durable products and real estate in the
next six months" recording the largest drop at 2.75 points to
stand at 115.1 points.
</P>
<P>
The other indicators that slipped included those concerning
domestic consumers' assessment of price levels, household income,
domestic economic development, employment opportunities and the
best time for stock investment.
</P>
<P>
The survey has a margin of error of plus or minus 2 percentage
points.
