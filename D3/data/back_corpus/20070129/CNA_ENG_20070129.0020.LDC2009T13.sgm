Taipei,  Jan.  29 (CNA) 01/29/07  16:38:26 (By Lilian Wu)

Ministry of Justice (MOJ) officials met Monday with five members
of the Asia/Pacific Group on Money Laundering (APG) who were in
Taiwan to investigate government agencies and private institutes
related to prosecution, investigation and finance, in order to
assess their enforcement of internationally accepted standards on
money laundering and the financing of terrorism.
</P>
<P>
Vice Minister of Justice Wang Tien-sheng said that although
Taiwan is shut out of most international organizations because it
is not a member of the United Nations, it knows the importance of
combating money laundering.
</P>
<P>
Wang noted that the business of the APG is closely related to
several U.N. international conventions and that the MOJ has sent
officials to APG annual conferences since it was established in
1997.
</P>
<P>
He said this is the first time Taiwan has undergone an assessment
by the APG.
</P>
<P>
The MOJ has convened meetings with the Central Bank of China, the
Judicial Yuan, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Financial
Supervisory Commission since June 2005 in anticipation of the
assessment, he said.
</P>
<P>
The MOJ has also convened inter-agency meetings to regularly
examine Taiwan's domestic policies as well as their
implementation, in line with U.N. conventions and
recommendations.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the MOJ formulated a draft bill on amendments to a
money- laundering prevention law that was sent to the Cabinet for
screening last October. The draft bill, as well as an anti-
terrorism action law, are expected to be legislated soon.
</P>
<P>
Wang said that to assist the APG in its assessment, the ministry
has arranged for the group to call on related government agencies
as well as private organizations so that they can have a
comprehensive understanding of Taiwan's related policies and
their implementation.
</P>
<P>
Premier Su Tseng-chang will also receive the group, which is
comprised of legal and financial experts from Australia, New
Zealand, South Korea, Fiji and the Cook Islands, to highlight
Taiwan's determination in monitoring its financial state, he
said.
