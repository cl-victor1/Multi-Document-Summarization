The Shihlin District in northern Taipei City has geared up to
apply to join the Asia-Pacific Alliance for Healthy Cities under
the framework of the World Health Organization, a Taipei city
government official said Monday.
</P>
<P>
A Shihlin Healthy Cities Alliance Bid Promotion Association was
established Monday by 80 individuals and organizations from the
district to help push for inclusion in the regional healthy
cities alliance, said Teng Su-wen, deputy director of the city's
Department of Health.
</P>
<P>
The establishment of the association is aimed at building
partnerships and civil participation among the alliance members,
Teng said.
</P>
<P>
She continued that the formation of the alliance was aimed at
improving the quality of life in urban communities. It was also
aimed at reaffirming that health is a fundamental right and that
the attainment of the highest possible level of health requires
action by many sectors and that recognizing urbanization as a
worldwide phenomenon, she added.
</P>
<P>
Teng added that the association  is scheduled to file an
application with the Asia-Pacific Alliance for Healthy Cities in
June.
</P>
<P>
She said that the Shihlin District -- which has the top ratio of
"green land" accessibility and availability to district residents
among all Taipei districts -- is blessed with the world-renowned
National Palace Museum, Yangmingshan National Park, the
Zhishanyan Prehistoric Site, the former presidential residence
and a large number of trails for hiking -- only a few of many
other worthy factors that make the district seen as a great place
to live.
</P>
<P>
The Taipei city government will help push for the district's
membership of the alliance along with that of the Beitou District
this year, while seeking membership of the Songshan, Zhongshan
and Wanhua districts next year, Teng said.
</P>
<P>
She added that Da-an last year became the first Taipei district
to be admitted into the alliance, which currently has 62 member
cities from over 10 countries and areas in the Asia-Pacific
region.
