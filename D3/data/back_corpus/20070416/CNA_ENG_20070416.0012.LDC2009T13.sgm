A dust storm from China began affecting Taiwan's air quality in
the early hours of Monday, with the Environmental Protection
Administration (EPA) detecting a surging density of air particles
in the areas north of Taoyuan, EPA officials said, warning that
the air particle density is expected to reach its peak at around
5:00 p.m.
</P>
<P>
EPA technician Chang Shun-chin said the particle density at 10
a.m. was measured to be 133 micrograms per cubic meter on Kinmen
Island, 85 micrograms per cubic meter in Wanli in Taipei County,
northern Taiwan, and 69 micrograms per cubic meter on
Yangmingshan in suburban Taipei City, much higher than usual.
</P>
<P>
The particle density was usually at the level of around 40
micrograms per cubic meter in Wanli, and about 10 micrograms per
cubic meter on Yangmingshan, Chang said. He forecast that the air
particle density in Taipei City could reach as high as 250
micrograms per cubic meter Monday afternoon.

<P>
While the movement of a high atmospheric pressure system from
China passing across Taiwan has been slowing down, the dust storm
is expected to continue affecting the island's air quality until
Wednesday morning, the EPA officials said, advising people to
wear gauze masks when heading outdoors.

<P>
They also advised that the elderly and young people refrain from
engaging in any outdoor activities over the next two days.
