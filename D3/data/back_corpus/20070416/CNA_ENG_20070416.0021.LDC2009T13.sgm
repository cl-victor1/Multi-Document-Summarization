ELECTION GAMBITS TO INCREASE PRIOR TO DPP PRIMARY: PREMIER
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  April 16 (CNA) 04/16/07  18:03:42 (By Lilian Wu)

Premier Su Tseng-chang said Monday that election gambits will
increase in the run-up to the presidential primary of the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) in May, but that he is sure
voters will make their own judgments.
</P>
<P>
The premier made the remarks following a local cable television
report last Friday that another presidential hopeful, former
Premier Frank Hsieh, is leading in test public opinion polls
conducted by the "pan-green camp" led by the DPP.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with a local radio station, Su said that all
kinds of election gambits will come out before the party's
primary with the intention of undermining rivals and
strengthening the candidates' own camps.
</P>
<P>
The media also has its own stance, which is evident to discerning
eyes, Su added.
</P>
<P>
Su said that he has experience about the unreliability of public
opinion polls, noting that he won the election for Taipei county
magistrate in 1997, despite public opinion polls showing that he
was lagging behind by more than 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
He noted that he has insisted on not verbally attacking other
rivals and said the voters will make their decisions based on the
character and style of each presidential hopeful.
</P>
<P>
DPP sources said a recent spat over who is leading among the DPP
presidential hopefuls, who include Vice President Annette Lu, DPP
Chairman Yu Shyi-kun and former Premier Frank Hsieh, is aimed at
swaying DPP members, hoping that they will eventually cast their
votes for the leading contender, even though DPP member votes
only account for 30 percent of the hopeful's final score, while a
series of public opinion polls will account for 70 percent.
</P>
<P>
The DPP will announce its candidate May 30.
</P>
<P>
Su also took the opportunity to defend himself over recent
controversy surrounding a planned demolition of the Losheng
Sanitarium in Taipei County and the planned construction of a
freeway linking Suao and Hualien.
</P>
<P>
He said his new goal is to preserve 90 percent of the leprosarium
and not to postpone a scheduled opening of a mass rapid transit
line through the complex.
</P>
<P>
On criticism of this policy flip-flop, Su noted that the route of
a MRT line passing through the leprosarium was planned in 1994
during the previous Kuomintang administration, and that he only
held the office of Taipei county magistrate until December 1997.
Su ruled in December 2002 that the leprosarium would not be
designated a historical site and last month rejected a suggestion
by the Council for Cultural Affairs that 90 percent of the
complex be preserved.
</P>
<P>
Su said that both Yu and Hsieh clearly stated during their stints
as premier that the matter should be left for coordination
between Taipei city and county.
</P>
<P>
"There is no need to point fingers at others," Su said, adding
that as a premier, he has to tackle the problem.
</P>
<P>
He also claimed that major construction projects and
environmental protection cannot co-exist. President Chen Shui-
bian first floated the idea of a freeway linking Suao and Hualien
when he was campaigning for president, Su said, adding that Yu
suspended the construction project because of disputes over its
impact on the environment. His predecessor Hsieh did not retract
the project, although he proposed an alternative project, Su
continued.
</P>
<P>
He said that as long as the project passes an environmental
impact assessment, it will be continued.
