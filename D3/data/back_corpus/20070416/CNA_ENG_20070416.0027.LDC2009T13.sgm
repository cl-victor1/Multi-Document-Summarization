With the handsome profits earned by Taiwan's several unmanned
convenience stores, dubbed "Q-Shops, " many enterprises plan to
follow suit, including several based in Japan, trade sources said
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan's first two Q-Shops were set up by the OK convenience
chain store last November under a promotion program for
intelligent stores presented by the Commerce Department under the
Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA).
</P>
<P>
Customers can buy groceries, snacks and drinks from vending
machines at the unmanned Q-Shops, using cash or credit cards.
Clients can talk to clerks or security guards via intercom at
each vending machine if they have any problems with the machines.
</P>
<P>
According to the statistics, more than 35,000 people made
purchases at the two Q-Shops for total transactions of NT$580,000
(US$17,575) since their opening Nov. 28 last year. Only 5 percent
of the customers used credit cards.
</P>
<P>
Yang Hui-wen, a section chief of the Innovative Digitech-Enabled
Applications and Services Institute (IDEAS) under the Institute
for Information Industry, which offers software assistance to the
project, noted that with the unmanned convenience stores reducing
significantly their costs in personnel and rent, the Q-Shops had
good profit margins, although the transactions were small.
</P>
<P>
In addition to food, beverages and groceries, the OK group will
introduce digital photo printing in order to diversify their
operations later this year, said Chang Hung-hao, general manager
of the OK group.
</P>
<P>
Other enterprises, including gas stations, highway rest stations,
companies in science parks and some Japanese firms have shown
strong interest in following in the OK group's footsteps.
</P>
<P>
Wang Poh-po, director-general of the MOEA's Commerce Department,
said the government might consider authorizing the Q-Shops to
offer more  services  in the future,  including  handling
household registration application.
