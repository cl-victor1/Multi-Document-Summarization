Washington,   April   15  (CNA) 04/16/07  15:19:04 (By Chiehyu
Lin and Deborah Kuo)

Taiwan's  top labor  affairs administrator, Lee Ying-yuan,
arrived in Washington, D.C. Sunday to clarify and explain
Taiwan's labor policy as part of efforts to pave the way for the
signing of a free trade agreement (FTA) between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
Speaking outside the airport upon his arrival in the U.S.
capital, Lee, chairman of the Council of Labor Affairs (CLA),
said this is the first time that a Taiwan official in charge of
labor affairs has come to Washington for talks on labor- related
topics which are one of the United States' major concerns in
gauging whether to sign an FTA with Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Prior to Lee's visit, only officials in charge of economic and
trade affairs had traveled to Washington for similar talks.
</P>
<P>
Lee said Taiwan has advanced regulations governing management and
welfare services for both local and migrant workers employed in
Taiwan and completed related legislation over the past several
years, adding that Taiwan's Labor Standards Law now provides
"lofty and adequate norms and standards" for treatment of wage
earners.
</P>
<P>
Lee said that he attaches great importance to his visit in
Washington during which he will exchange views with the Bush
administration officials, think-tank specialists and members of
the U.S. Congress. He added that the current members of the U.S.
Congress have payed closer attention to labor affairs and
environmental protection issues than their predecessors had.
</P>
<P>
During his visit, Lee is also expected to brief U.S. officials
and think tank scholars on Taiwan's labor policy and its efforts
to improve welfare benefits for both domestic wage earners and
foreign laborers in the hopes of "clearing up any misconceptions
or misunderstandings."
</P>
<P>
He added that an FTA between Taiwan and the United States will
help shore up the volume of two-way trade between the two
countries, which will in turn generate more job opportunities in
the industrial sectors of the two sides.
</P>
<P>
Lee, who once served as Taiwan's deputy representative in the
United States, would not disclose exactly which U.S. officials he
is scheduled to meet with, only saying that all such meetings are
being arranged by the Taipei Economic and Cultural Representative
Office in Washington.
</P>
<P>
According to Lee's itinerary, he will deliver a speech Tuesday on
upgrading Asian labor standards at the Center for National
Policy, a U.S. think tank dedicated to research and debate on
issues concerning U.S. national interests. He will also attend a
seminar at the U.S. Heritage Foundation, another Washington-based
think tank. Before wrapping up his trip Thursday, Lee will brief
Taiwanese journalists posted in Washington, D.C. on the purposes
and accomplishments of his visit.
