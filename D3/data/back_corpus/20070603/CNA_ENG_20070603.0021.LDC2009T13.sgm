Former President Lee Teng-hui, who is currently in Japan on an
11-day visit, was panned here Sunday for accepting a prize named
after a late Japanese administrator in Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Koo Kwang-ming, who is a former senior adviser to President Chen
Shui-bian and who had lived in Japan as a political exile for 25
years, said that Shinpei Goto might have contributed a lot to
Taiwan while serving as the chief civil administrator under the
Japanese colonial government in Taiwan between 1898 and 1906 but
that it was inappropriate for Lee, as a retired head of state of
Taiwan, to accept an award set up in Goto's honor.
</P>
<P>
Koo, who is a close friend of Lee's, said he was not aware before
Lee's departure for Japan that the former president would receive
the prize during his visit, adding, however, that if he had known
about it, attempting to change the mind of someone as stubborn as
Lee would have been in vain.
</P>
<P>
Lee received the prize in Tokyo on June 1 for his contribution to
Taiwan's urbanization and democratization.
