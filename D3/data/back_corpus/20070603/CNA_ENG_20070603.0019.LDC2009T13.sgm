FLIGHTS

Opposition Kuomintang presidential candidate Ma Ying-jeou's
promise to negotiate with Beijing to launch direct flights across
the Taiwan Strait if elected was made based on concerns that
Taiwan faces the serious threat of being marginalized, a KMT
executive explained Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Chang Jun-kung, deputy executive director of the KMT's policy
committee,  made the remarks in response to a report in the
Chinese-language United Daily News Sunday that Ma claimed in a
recent interview with foreign media that if elected president in
2008, he will immediately engage in negotiations with China for
the opening of direct cross-strait flights within one year after
assuming office.
</P>
<P>
Noting that Ma had said on previous occasions that he would make
direct cross- strait flights a reality within two years after
assuming the presidency, Chang explained that Ma moved up the
deadline to one year as most of the political concerns related to
direct links with China have been alleviated with KMT Honorary
Chairman Lien Chan's three visits to China over the past three
years and because the success of direct cross-strait charter
flights during holiday periods has made direct flights year-round
more feasible.
</P>
<P>
Chang further said that foreign enterprises operating in Taiwan
have frequently called for the government to move forward with
opening direct cross-strait flights, adding that the United
States has even stated that it has no willingess to sign a
bilateral free trade agreement with Taiwan if the government
refuses to do so. He said the government has turned a deaf ear to
Washington's calls, which he claimed is stunting the island's
economic competitiveness.
</P>
<P>
Chang added that Ma has also come up with an effective policy to
open Taiwan up to Chinese tourists with the goal of developing
its economy and avoiding Taiwan becoming marginalized in terms of
regional economic integration.
