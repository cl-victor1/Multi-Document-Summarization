The Yilan County government has decided to designate all the
county grown rice to be harvested after July as "Yilan Rice"
before putting it on the market as part of its efforts to develop
the county's own brand, government officials said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
In addition to designating the rice as "Yilan Rice, " the
government will also require that information about the rice be
included, such as the "rice taste value, " on the package labels
in order to enhance consumer confidence in the safety and quality
of the products, according to the official.
</P>
<P>
The "rice taste value is obtained by using a near-infrared grain
analyzer to study the chemical composition of the rice samples,
the spokesman explained.
</P>
<P>
At present, there are many varieties of Yilan rice packaged under
different names, including Dongnung Rice and Shanshui Rice by the
Dongshan Farmers' Association, and Yuekuang Rice and Wunung Rice
by the Wuchie Farmers' Association, making it difficult to ensure
the quality of the rice products, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Besides the package labeling requirement, the county government
has also decided to adopt stricter measures to regulate the
amount of chemical  substances  used in growing rice to further
protect consumers, the spokesman said.
