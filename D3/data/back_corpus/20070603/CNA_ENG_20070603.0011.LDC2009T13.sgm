Premier Chang Chun-hsiung said Sunday that he is open to the
notion of the Legislative Yuan holding a no-confidence vote
against him to topple the Cabinet.
</P>
<P>
Legislator Chen Chin-de of the ruling Democratic Progressive
Party proposed the no-confidence motion last week with the aim of
toppling the Cabinet so as to allow President Chen Shui-bian to
dissolve the legislature.
</P>
<P>
Premier Chang, speaking to reporters at the Grand Hotel after
attending a national drug control conference, said he respects
the ideas of the lawmakers and President Chen on whether the
Cabinet should be toppled to pave the way for President Chen to
dissolve the Legislature.
</P>
<P>
According to the Constitution, the president may, within 10 days
after legislative approval of a no-confidence vote against the
premier, dissolve the legislature.
</P>
<P>
As of Friday, a total of 46 of the 83 DPP lawmakers had endorsed
Legislator Chen's motion, leaving it 26 signatures short of the
one-third threshold required to send the motion to the
legislature. Chen has said that he will continue to work to get
more DPP lawmakers onboard.
</P>
<P>
On the reasons behind introducing the motion, Chen said that the
long-term disorder in the "pan-blue alliance"-dominated
Legislative Yuan has seriously hindered administrative
operations, adding that "now is the time to put an end to the
farce."
</P>
<P>
However, several DPP legislators have expressed doubts about the
no-confidence motion proposal, which has also drawn flak from
opposition lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
Ker Chien-ming, a whip of the DPP legislative caucus, said
Saturday that it is strange that lawmakers from the ruling party
are trying to topple the Cabinet, stressing that any major
decision involving the party should be debated and passed by the
DPP legislative caucus.
</P>
<P>
Lee Hung-chun, a spokesman for the opposition People First Party,
asked the DPP Friday why it is aiming to hold a no-confidence
vote against the premier, instead of against the president
himself.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Tseng Yung-chuan, executive director of opposition
Kuomintang's (KMT's) Central Policy Committee, said Sunday that
the KMT will not make any response to the no-confidence motion
proposal until it determines whether the proposal is "just a
political facade" on the part of the DPP.
</P>
<P>
Responding to these reactions to his proposal, Chen Chin-de said
Sunday that it is constructive that the DPP members have
different opinions on issues, adding that this reflects the
"nature of the DPP as a great party."
</P>
<P>
Chen, however, reiterated his resolve to continue working to get
the required number of endorsement signatures for his no-
confidence vote motion to be sent to the legislature.
</P>
<P>
According to the Constitution, a no-confidence vote should be
held within three days after the motion is sent to the
legislature.
