Kuomintang Chairman Ma Ying-jeou paid a visit to the Chen's
Family Clan Association on Kinmen Sunday as part of his tour of
grass-root communities on the outlying island.
</P>
<P>
Ma received a warm welcome from Chen family members when he
visited an 100-year- old  ancestral hall of the largest family
organization on Kinmen island, with the family unfurling a red
banner and opening the main gate to welcome him.
</P>
<P>
Chen Shui-Tzai, president of the Chen Clan Association said
opening the main gate is not common, with openings occurring only
three times during the previous Lunar New Year holidays.
</P>
<P>
Chen added local residents understand that Ma was troubled by the
embezzlement charges related to his alleged misuse of special
municipal funds when he served as mayor of Taipei from 1998-2006,
and that they believe in his moral soundness and integrity.
</P>
<P>
He also expressed his belief that 90 percent of people on the
island would support Ma's run in the 2008 presidential election,
and gave voice to his hope that Ma's resolution and aspirations
to serve the country, government and people will not undermined
by political manipulation.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile Ma insisted on his innocence, saying that he expects
prosecution authorities will look into the case based on justice,
that he will appeal to reason to prove his innocence, and he will
fulfill the responsibilities entrusted to him by the 23 million
people of Taiwan.
