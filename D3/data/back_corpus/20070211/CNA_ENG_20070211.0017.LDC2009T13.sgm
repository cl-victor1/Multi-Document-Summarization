KMT CHAIRMAN HAS NOT YET THOUGHT ON RUNNING MATE ISSUE

Taipei,  Feb. 11 (CNA) 02/11/07  18:38:17 (By Flor Wang)

The top priority for the Kuomintang (KMT) now is to unite and
field the most qualified ticket to take back power in the 2008
presidential election, KMT Chairman Ma Ying-jeou said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Brushing aside a media report that he had discussed the issue of
forming a presidential ticket with Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang
Jin-pyng during a Friday meeting with KMT Honorary Chairman Lien
Chan, Ma clarified that he has not thought of the question and
added that he only mentioned to Lien that there must be only one
ticket to represent the KMT in the next presidential poll.
</P>
<P>
Ma said that he has yet to officially announce his presidential
bid and that he has never thought about with whom he should form
a ticket to run in the race for the KMT.
</P>
<P>
Ma made the remarks at a seminar with KMT Taipei city committee
members who urged him to quickly make public his presidential bid
for the sake of the nation's overall interests.
</P>
<P>
According to Ma's aides, the KMT's presidential candidate must be
produced in line with the party's mechanisms. Once the party's
presidential hopeful is decided, whether through negotiations
within the party or through its primaries, he or she is entitled
to choose a running mate, they said, adding that it is pointless
to discuss the question of who and who should form a presidential
ticket.
</P>
<P>
Earlier the same day, Wang also claimed that he had not
considered forming a ticket with Ma to run in the next president
poll. "I need more time to carefully assess the issue," he said.
</P>
<P>
Wang also denied a media report that he might team up with a
running mate from the "pan-green camp" of the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) and the Taiwan Solidarity Union, arguing
that he never discussed such an option or revealed such an
intent.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, KMT lawmakers voiced their worry that there have been
no signs of cooperation between Ma and Wang, despite high public
expectations that the two men should team up to run in the 2008
presidential election.
</P>
<P>
According to KMT lawmaker Hsu Shu-po, grass-roots supporters
keenly wish to see Ma and Wang form a ticket to represent the KMT
in the next presidential election. But he said that there have
been no signs that the two KMT key men will collaborate in this
regard, a development he called "worrisome."
</P>
<P>
"Aides surrounding Ma must realize that it will be very difficult
for the KMT to take back power if Ma doesn't team up with Wang in
the 2008 presidential race, " Hsu said, urging both Ma and Wang
to unite and face up to reality, and warning that DPP
heavyweights have started to coordinate on producing a combative
candidate for the next presidential race.
</P>
<P>
Stating that support for a Ma-Wang presidential ticket remains
strong among the rank and file, KMT lawmaker Lai Shyh-bao
encouraged the two men to "have a talk and settle the issue."
