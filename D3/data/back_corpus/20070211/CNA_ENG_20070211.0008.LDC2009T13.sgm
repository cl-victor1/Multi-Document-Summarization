Taipei,  Feb.  11 (CNA) 02/11/07  16:16:10 (By Sofia Wu)
</P>
<P>
President Chen Shui-bian has promised to help with the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party's (DPP's) candidate selection for
the 2008 presidential contest through building a consensus among
all of the hopefuls, party sources said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Ker Chien-ming, top whip of the DPP legislative caucus, quoted
Chen as saying at a spring gathering of senior administrators and
DPP officials at a recreational park in Sanhsia, Taipei County
Saturday that he feels "bound in honor" to assist in coordinating
the selection of the DPP's 2008 presidential ticket.
</P>
<P>
"If necessary,  I'll not evade the duty of helping  with
presidential candidate selection through coordination, " Chen was
quoted as having said at the spring gathering he hosted in honor
of government and party officials as well as DPP lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
According to Ker, the selection of the party's candidate for the
next presidential election was the hottest topic discussed during
the "hiking and talking" event.
</P>
<P>
With the party's four heavyweights -- Vice President Annette Lu,
Premier Su Tseng-chang, former Premier Frank Hsieh and DPP
Chairman Yu Shyi-kun -- overtly or covertly vying for the party's
mandate for the presidential race, Ker said many DPP members are
worrying over how to build a consensus among the four aspirants
to avoid damaging party unity.
</P>
<P>
"Many participants to the spring gathering requested that the
president help with this tough and arduous job, " Ker said.
</P>
<P>
Former Premier Hsieh was quoted as having said on the occasion
that party unity is most important in ensuring electoral victory.
Therefore, he said,  the party should act early to pick its
presidential ticket through consensus building instead of holding
a primary, which he said could undermine harmony and unity within
the party.
</P>
<P>
If the 2008 presidential election and the year-end legislative
election are, in fact, held simultaneously, Hsieh said, the
voting day should be advanced to Jan. 26, 2008. Should that be
the case, he said, less than a year is left for preparations.
"This is why I have been advocating that our party should start
presidential hopeful registration as soon as possible," Hsieh
added.
</P>
<P>
Some lawmakers present at the meeting called for an extensive
debate among all aspirants on the party's future policy lines and
various reform initiatives. Hsieh reportedly threw his support
behind such a proposal.
</P>
<P>
Premier  Su  said  he  believes  that  the  Cabinet's
demonstrated administrative success would be the best guarantee
of the ruling party's success in the two upcoming critical
elections.
</P>
<P>
"Against this backdrop, I'll work diligently and cooperatively
with all party members in carrying out all of our policy
initiatives and reform projects. I also wholeheartedly support
the proposal of having the president assist in deciding on our
party's presidential ticket as early as possible," Su said during
the meeting.
</P>
<P>
For his part, DPP Chairman Yu said the party central committee
has worked out a schedule in reference to past practices for
selecting the party's presidential candidate. According to the
schedule, candidacy registration will start in April, a primary
vote by party members will take place in May and public opinion
polls will be held in June. According to DPP regulations, the
primary voting result will account for 30 percent and the opinion
poll results will make up 70 percent in selecting the party's
presidential nominee.
</P>
<P>
If necessary, Yu said he himself would not oppose advancing the
whole work schedule or have President Chen help coordinate the
candidate selection.
</P>
<P>
Another major topic discussed in Saturday's gathering was the DPP
administration's ongoing campaign to rename state-owned companies
to get rid of Chinese reference and include "Taiwan" in their
titles to make them more identifiable with their country of
origin and avoid confusion with similarly named Chinese
organizations.
</P>
<P>
President Chen was quoted as having acknowledged that it would be
very difficult to satisfy all social quarters with regard to the
"name rectification" campaign. Consequently, he said, the
government and the DPP would be better off if they keep a low
profile and refrain from "talking too much" about the issue.
</P>
<P>
DPP Chairman Yu said the "name rectification" drive is both aimed
at realizing the party's policy goal and a move to deliver on its
commitment to making Taiwan a "normal, complete and great"
country.
</P>
<P>
"There  might be practical  limitations  and obstacles  to
accomplishing our ultimate goal, but we should never back away
from hard work or our party's ideals, " Yu said, adding that his
current push for name rectification and desinicization is in line
with the party's policy line.
</P>
<P>
He further said that even though writing a new constitution for
the country is a tall order, the DPP should still present a draft
bill in this regard to deliver on its promise to its hard-core
supporters.
</P>
<P>
Both Premier Su and his predecessor, Hsieh, were reportedly more
reserved about touting the party's ideals that may be hard to be
fully implement given the present international environment. Both
said they prefer to see a delicate balance achieved between
advocating  the party's  ambitious  goals and their pragmatic
implementation.
