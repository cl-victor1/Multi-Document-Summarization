NAME CHANGE DRIVE HELPS BOOST TAIWAN IDENTITY: DPP CHAIRMAN
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  Feb.  11 (CNA) 02/11/07  19:42:12 (By Flor Wang)

The government's ongoing name change campaign for state-run
companies is very helpful in galvanizing the people's
identification with Taiwan, ruling Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) Chairman Yu Shyi-kun said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Yu made the remarks while giving a speech at a ceremony in
central Changhua county during which more than 100 new party
workers took an oath to serve the DPP.
</P>
<P>
Defending the name change campaign that he launched earlier this
month,  Yu contended that the drive will certainly boost the
identification of the people of Taiwan with the country. "The
more the issue is being talked about, the more the people will
feel akin to Taiwan," he argued.
</P>
<P>
He further pointed out that the United States has no right to
meddle in Taiwan's internal matters, like the ongoing name change
campaign for state-run enterprises, and called for a customized
constitution and joining the United Nations under the name
"Taiwan" making Taiwan a normal country.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Ma Ying-jeou
voiced his opposition to the ruling DPP's name change drive at a
seminar with the party's Taipei city committee members.
</P>
<P>
Reminding the DPP government that such a meaningless move will
only waste the taxpayers' money and create concerns in other
countries, like the United States, Ma questioned whether the name
change drive is the DPP's first step towards a formal declaration
of Taiwan's independence.
</P>
<P>
Arguing that the DPP's "bossing around" will gain no public
support, Ma said that he was reserved about a proposal that the
KMT should dramatically respond to the DPP's name change drive.
</P>
<P>
The KMT must refrain from dancing to the tune of the DPP, which
has been seeking to divert public attention away from its
corruption and incompetence, said Ma.
