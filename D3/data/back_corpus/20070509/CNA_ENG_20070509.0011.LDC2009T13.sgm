Taipei,  May 9 (CNA) 05/09/07  11:46:07 (By Sofia Wu)

<P>
Non-economic factors, rather than economic performance, have
contributed to Taiwan's one-notch drop in the latest world
competitiveness rankings compiled by the renowned IMD Business
School in Lausanne, Switzerland, officials said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The officials from the Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) were
responding to media reports that Taiwan has declined to 18th in
the soon-to-be-released IMD World Competitiveness Yearbook 2007
while China has overtaken Taiwan to claim 15th place.
</P>
<P>
It marks the first time that China has ever surpassed Taiwan in a
major global competitiveness ranking.
</P>
<P>
The IMD Business School has published the World Competitiveness
Yearbook annually since 1989. The yearbook analyses and ranks the
ability of nations to create and maintain an environment that
sustains the competitiveness of enterprises and contributes to
upgrading of living standards.
</P>
<P>
The IMD evaluated 55 major economies around the world this year
in terms of four competitiveness factors -- economic performance,
government efficiency, business efficiency and infrastructure,
which altogether consist of 312 competitiveness criteria.
</P>
<P>
Generally speaking, Taiwan has been on a steady decline in the
IMD's overall competitiveness rating in recent years, sliding
from 11th in 2005 to 17th in 2006 and further dipping to 18th
this year.
</P>
<P>
In contrast, China has been on a steep upward streak, leaping
from 31st in 2005 to 18th in 2006 and further rising to 15th in
2007.
</P>
<P>
The MOEA officials  said Taiwan's  decline in the overall
competitiveness rating was mainly due to non-economic factors,
such as weak social coherence and solidarity, political
instability and policy inconsistency.
</P>
<P>
In comparison, the officials said, Taiwan remains robust in the
economic realm. In the IMD's economic performance rating, Taiwan
moved up to 16th from 25th in 2006.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan also made progress in the government efficiency category,
rising from 23rd in 2006 to 20th this year. However, its ratings
in the infrastructure and business efficiency categories dropped
from 18th and 13th to 21st and 17th, respectively.
</P>
<P>
According to the MOEA officials, Taiwan's IMD competitiveness
rankings in the economic performance category saw dramatic
changes in recent years, bouncing back nine places this year
after a substantial fall in 2006.
</P>
<P>
Noting that such a trend shows that Taiwan's industry is
undergoing structural transformation, the officials said Taiwan
needs more time and more efforts to overhaul its economy and
reinvent itself.
</P>
<P>
In terms of the IMD assessment, the officials said Taiwan must
continue to give priority to research, development and
innovation. In addition to developing the knowledge-based service
industry, the officials said, Taiwan must also step up efforts in
developing new products and new technologies to boost the values
of its industries.
</P>
<P>
As to China's overtaking of Taiwan in the IMD competitiveness
rankings, the officials said that it mainly reflects the fact
that China's economic growth rate has been higher than that of
Taiwan.
