The Cabinet-level National Youth Commission (NYC) is opening 98
study-travel programs this summer for young men and women from
home and abroad to enable them to engage in first-hand, in-depth
exploration of Taiwan, commission officials said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
More than 6,000 openings in 200-odd camps in 98 study-tour
packages will be available this upcoming summer break to allow
young Taiwanese youths aged between 15-30 to see, sense and touch
the land where they live and allow young men and women from
abroad to discover Taiwan's multi-faceted and pluralistic society
as well as its natural beauty, NYC officials said.

They said that youths who have grown fond of literature should
sign up for the "jail" camp or for the study-tour of the southern
city of Tainan and the southern township of Yenshui to get a
glimpse into the history of the development of Taiwan's literary
culture and its current situation.

Those who are interested in exploring local life in Taiwan are
welcome to take part in camps in offshore areas to experience how
Taiwan fishermen live and to see how farmers work in rice
paddies, harvest bamboo shoots and plant and harvest tea and
herbs, the NYC officials said.

Those  who like wildlife  and adventure  can sign up for
mountaineering, whale- watching and white-water trips and ancient
trail expedition camps, they said.

They added that those who are interested in indigenous people and
their cultures should join the annual worship rituals to be held
by the Amis and Rukai tribes during the summer break.
