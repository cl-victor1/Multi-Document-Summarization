A total of 120 countries and areas around the world, including
Taiwan, Hong Kong and China, are being covered in an
unprecedented "peace" survey, whose results are expected to be
released at the end of the month.
</P>
<P>
The world's first peace survey is the brainchild of Steve
Killelea, a successful Australian entrepreneur and humanitarian,
who came up with the idea during a trip to Africa four years ago
during which he saw first-hand how wars and economic depression
are afflicting the people on the continent.

<P>
With a scientific survey aimed at calculating the amount of peace
in a nation, Killelea told CNA that he hopes the United Nations,
governments, non- governmental organizations, as well as all
civil groups around the world will take the survey as an
indicator that reminds them how much still needs to be done to
achieve true peace.

<P>
Killelea, the founder and chairman of Integrated Research Ltd.,
launched a charity foundation in 2000 dedicating to providing aid
to people living in Third World countries.
</P>
<P>
Dafne Ter-Sakarian, chief of a client research department of the
Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU) , is working with Killelea in
carrying out the Global Peace Index survey. He said 650
researchers around the world have been mobilized for the
challenging task of collecting and analyzing data based on 24
different criteria.
</P>
<P>
They have been working on the survey for more than 300 days, Ter-
Sakarian said, noting the results are expected to be released May
30.
