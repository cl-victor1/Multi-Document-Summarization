Taipei,   May  9  (CNA) 05/09/07  11:57:13 (By Deborah Kuo)

<P>
Former Kuomintang (KMT)  Chairman Ma Ying-jeou,  the main
opposition  party's nominee for the 2008 presidential election,
said Wednesday that he was misquoted by a KMT lawmaker saying
that he is a "candidate for the leadership of Taiwan."
</P>
<P>
Ma said he is a KMT nominee for the 2008 election of the
president of the Republic of China, instead of a "Taiwan leader"
as KMT Legislator Wu Yu-sheng said recently during an interview
with a mainland Chinese media outlet.
</P>
<P>
Wu's "Taiwan leader" remarks have triggered flak and questions by
ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
Ma said that although Wu is a close friend and had been a good
colleague of his when he was Taipei mayor, he would squarely tell
Wu that his remarks were "inappropriate."
</P>
<P>
It is unarguably clear that he will be running for the ROC
presidency, Ma said, adding that he will also ask Wu to be more
careful in the future when he talks in public.
</P>
<P>
Ma made the remarks in response to reporters' questions while
attending a religious ritual at a temple in Taipei.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, on questions that his support ratings have fallen in
recent months and that the gap between his support ratings and
those of Frank Hsieh, who is set to represent the DPP in the 2008
presidential race, has narrowed to less than 10 percent, Ma said
he will pay heed to this fact and will strive even harder to
consolidate the opposition alliance's esprit de corps to win the
2008 battle.
