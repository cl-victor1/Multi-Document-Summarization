A business delegation organized by the semi-official Taiwan
External Trade Development Council (TAITRA) will hold two
separate trade fairs in India starting Thursday as part of
efforts to assist Taiwanese companies in opening the market, a
TAITRA official said Wednesday.

The first fair will open in the largest Indian city of Mumbai May
10-12, with 33 Taiwanese businesses displaying their products,
which include electronic appliances and peripheral equipment for
computers, machine tools, medical and health care equipment and
clothes, as well as construction materials.

Following the Mumbai trade fair, the delegation, comprised of 45
representatives of the fair participants, will head to the
industrial city of Chennai, eastern India, to hold its second
trade exposition on the sub-continent, slated for May 13-15.

Chang Yuan-lin, a TAITRA official stationed in Mumbai, said that
all of the products to be exhibited meet demands within the huge
market. In addition to the exhibitions, the council has also
invited Indian traders and manufacturers to meet with the
Taiwanese entrepreneurs for talks on possible trading exchanges.

India, home to 1.1 billion people, has maintained an economic
growth rate of over 8 percent in recent years. Vigorous economic
activities, along with the rapid rise of the middle class have
made the South  Asian  continent  a market abounding  in business
opportunities, an official of the ROC representative office to
India said.

According to statistics of Taiwan's Ministry of Economic Affair,
India recorded an average income of US$680 per capital in recent
years. In 2005-2006, the country's imports reached US$143.7
billion while exports amounted to US$103.3 billion. In 2005,
Taiwan's exports to India amounted to US$1.58 billion,
registering a year-on-year growth of 46.3 percent. The following
year, however, the amount slid to US$1.47 billion, for a year-on-
year drop of 7.1 percent.

In 2006, Taiwan imported US$1.24 billion worth of goods from
India, a significant growth over the previous year.
