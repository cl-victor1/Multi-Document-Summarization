The Department of Health (DOH) confirmed Wednesday  this  year's
first fatality  due  to  enterovirus complications.
</P>
<P>
The victim was a baby girl who developed flatulence shortly after
birth in Yunlin, southern Taiwan, April 26, DOH officials said.
The girl developed fever and became restless April 29, and was
transferred to a Chiayi hospital April 30 before she died of
sepsis May 2.
</P>
<P>
The DOH, after examining a specimen from the girl, confirmed that
she was infected with echovirus 6, an enterovirus.
</P>
<P>
Chou Chih-hao, deputy director of DOH's Center for Disease
Control, said that there is no risk of an enterovirus outbreak at
present, but because the means by which the girl was infected is
as yet unknown the public must not let down its guard.

Enterovirus is most prevalent in Taiwan between April and
October. The DOH said that the number of the cases has shown a
steady climb for seven consecutive weeks, and that the number of
cases reported this week exceeds the prewarning threshold.
</P>
<P>
The number of enterovirus cases in Taitung have increased to 247
this year, health officials in the eastern Taiwan county said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Officials said that the disease is mostly likely to afflict
children under five years of age, and urged parents to attend to
such hygienic practices as washing hands,  avoiding crowded
places, maintaining a balanced diet, and keeping to ventilated
environments.
