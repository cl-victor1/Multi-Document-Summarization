LARGEST PATCH OF ALGAL REEF IN TAIWAN UNDER THREAT: ECOLOGISTS
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  May 9 (CNA) 05/09/07  20:24:49 (By Zep Hu)

<P>
The largest patch of algal reef in Taiwan is under serious threat
from a natural gas pipeline construction project of the state-
owned CPC Corp., Taiwan (CPC), local ecologists warned Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The four-kilometer-long, 500-meter-wide algal reef, located along
the coast between Hsiao-fan-li creek and Hsin-wu creek in the
northern county of Taoyuan, has existed there for some 2,200
years to 6,000 years, according to the Endemic Species Research
Institute (ESRI) under the Council of Agriculture.
</P>
<P>
The algal reefs are formed by crystalline calcium carbonates left
by dead calcareous algae, ESRI researchers noted, adding that the
rarity of algal reefs, especially vast ones, lies in their
extremely slow growth rate -- usually 0.1 centimeters to 0.2
centimeters per year.
</P>
<P>
Although algal reefs have been spotted in several regions around
Taiwan, most of them have either stopped growing or have died due
to serious environmental disruption, they reported. "Taoyuan's is
the largest patch of living algal reef discovered so far."
</P>
<P>
"It is now in immediate danger, " ESRI Assistant Researcher Liu
Ching-yu warned.
</P>
<P>
"The CPC project will jeopardize the area in two ways: first, the
pipeline will cut through the reef from sea to land to reach a
90-degree curve junction, " she said. "And second, after the
curve, the pipeline will proceed along a 12-meter- wide ditch in
the back of the reef."
</P>
<P>
"This will result in the destruction of the ecology in the area,"
she added.
</P>
<P>
The ESRI has filed its concern and warning to the Environmental
Protection Agency, which has ordered the CPC to relocate the
pipeline or "be prepared for a suspension order." However, there
has been no positive feedback from the company, ESRI sources
said.
</P>
<P>
According to news reports that same day, the company said in a
statement that they will reduce the damage caused by the pipeline
ditch by reducing the width from 12 meters to four meters.
However, " the cut-through design is inevitable, " for lesser
environmental impact to the surrounding areas, the company
claimed.
