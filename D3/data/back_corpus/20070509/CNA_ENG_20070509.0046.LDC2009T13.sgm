TAIPEI MAYOR LAMENTS NAME CHANGE OF CKS MEMORIAL HALL
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taipei,  May 9 (CNA) 05/09/07  21:35:56 (By Flor Wang)
</P>
<P>
Taipei Mayor Hau Long-bin Wednesday called the central
government's decision to change the name of the Chiang Kai-shek
(CKS) Memorial Hall a result of ideological strife and said that
the city government will first consider the public's interests
when it comes to the name change issue.
</P>
<P>
Hau made the comment after the Executive Yuan officially approved
a decree earlier in the day to abolish the law provision ruling
the organization and the functions of the CKS Memorial Hall -- a
major tourist attraction in downtown Taipei -- and renamed it the
"national Taiwan democracy hall" in accordance with an organic
organization act passed in April by the Executive Yuan.
</P>
<P>
The "national Taiwan democracy hall" will become operational as
soon as the Ministry of Education announces the name change for
the monument.
</P>
<P>
Expressing his regret that relevant measures have been adopted by
the Executive Yuan to "rectify" the monument's name, Hau said
that the move may have a series of unintended consequences
impacting the public. For instance, he said, questions may be
raised over whether the names of bus stops and the Taipei mass
rapid train (MRT) CKS station should also be changed.
</P>
<P>
The Taipei city government will not follow in the footsteps of
the Executive Yuan if a name change is not necessary, as the
public has long grown used to the name "CKS Memorial Hall," Hau
said, adding that changing the names of bus and MRT stops in the
hall's perimeter is estimated to cost the city government at
least NT$80 million (US$2.4 million).
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a news conference in the Legislative Yuan later the
same day, opposition People First Party (PFP) lawmakers accused
the Executive Yuan of breaching the constitution by rescinding
the law governing the CKS Memorial Hall with an administrative
decree.
</P>
<P>
Chang Hsien-yao, a PFP lawmaker and director of the party's
central policy center, said that the Executive Yuan is not
entitled to deal with any law and described its "hasty" and
"improper" move as "unconstitutional."
</P>
<P>
"The PFP is planning to file a compliant with the Control Yuan
over a dereliction of duty by relevant government officials, "
Chang said.
</P>
<P>
The controversial name change drive was rekindled in Jan. this
year by ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) Chairman Yu
Shyi-kun, with President Chen Shui-bian echoing Yu's efforts to
push for a name change of the CKS Memorial Hall and for the
removal of Chiang's name and statutes from all military barracks
and public institutions across the country.
