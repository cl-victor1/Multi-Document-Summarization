EUROPEAN UNION URGED TO SUPPORT TAIWAN'S WHO BID
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Brussels,  May  8 (CNA) 05/09/07  12:42:01 (By P.C. Tang and Y.F.
Low)

Taiwan representatives called for the European Union Tuesday to
support the country's bid to enter the World Health Organization
(WHO) under the name of "Taiwan."
</P>
<P>
During an event held in the Belgian capital to lobby for Taiwan's
WHO bid, National Security Council member Yang Kuang-hua
explained that the country is applying for WHO membership this
year because its efforts for "meaningful participation" in the
organization have proved ineffective.
</P>
<P>
Since China secretly signed a memorandum of understanding with
the WHO in 2005 with regard to Taiwan's participation in WHO
activities,  it has become  even more  difficult  for medical
professionals from Taiwan to take part in technical-level
conferences held by the WHO, Yang said.
</P>
<P>
While Taiwan's participation in such conferences requires China's
approval beforehand, Taiwan representatives often are not given
the chance to express their opinions even if they are allowed to
attend the meetings, Yang noted.
</P>
<P>
Under these circumstances, Taiwan hopes to become a full member
of the WHO and to take part as an observer in the World Health
Assembly (WHA) -- the WHO's highest decision-making body --
before its official accession, he said.
</P>
<P>
Wu Chih-chung, a professor of political science at Taiwan's
Soochow University, accused the WHO of discriminating against
Taiwan for excluding the country.
</P>
<P>
Wu said that Taiwan has no intention of politicizing the issue
and that it is only fighting for its basic rights.
</P>
<P>
Michael Ying-mao Kau, Taiwan's representative to Belgium and the
European Union, urged the European Union to offer more support
for Taiwan, pointing out that the United States and Japan have
shown support for Taiwan's bid for observer status at the WHA
although both countries, like the European Union, follow a "one
China" policy.
