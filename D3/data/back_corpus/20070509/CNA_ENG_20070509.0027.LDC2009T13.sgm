A Taiwan-based charity group urged the public Wednesday to
support its fund- raising campaign with the goal of building 100
kindergartens  for 5,000 impoverished children in Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
According to Hung Chih-chieh, secretary-general of Compassion
International, the group has completed the construction of five
kindergartens in remote areas in central and southern parts of
Vietnam since 2004, with the construction work of two others
still under way.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the group has provided 10 days of educational
training  per year for the teachers  and staff  who operate
kindergartens, has paid their salaries and sponsored semi-annual
health examinations and daily lunches for the pupils, Hung said.
</P>
<P>
While Compassion International has enhanced Vietnam's preschool
enrollment rate by an average 26 percent over the past three
years, it is planning to build 93 more kindergartens in the
Southeast Asian nation to help even more disadvantaged children,
he said.
</P>
<P>
With each sponsor contributing NT$600 per month for a year, the
group needs 150 sponsors for each kindergarten construction
project costing approximately NT$1.08 million a year, meaning
that at least 13,950 more sponsors are required, Hung said.
</P>
<P>
Through similar sponsorship programs, the group has provided
medical care and education for more than 3,000 impoverished or
homeless children in central and southern Vietnam every year
since 1998, he said.
