CDC INSISTS NO TAIWAN BIRDS INFECTED WITH H5N1

Taipei,  Nov.  15 (CNA) (By Sofia Wu)

<P>
No bird in Taiwan has so far tested positive for H5N1, the most
virulent strain of avian flu, the Center for Disease Control (CDC)
under the Department of Health said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
CDC Deputy Director Lin Ting made the remarks after the British
government said the same day that birds from Taiwan quarantined in
Britain were infected with H5N1.
</P>
<P>
According to a report from the British Department for Environment,
Food and Rural Affairs, 53 of a shipment of 101 mesias imported from
Taiwan had died, but it was not clear how many of them had died of the
avian flu virus.
</P>
<P>
Tests of birds at the quarantine center, where Britain's first case
was detected, show that the virulent H5N1 strain was present only
within a group of mesias imported from Taiwan, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the report, Lin said all bird and poultry testing
results provided by the Council of Agriculture (COA) to date show that
no birds in Taiwan have ever tested positive for H5N1.
</P>
<P>
Against this backdrop, Lin said, the avian flu alert level will not be
raised at present and the current preventive measures will remain
unchanged.
