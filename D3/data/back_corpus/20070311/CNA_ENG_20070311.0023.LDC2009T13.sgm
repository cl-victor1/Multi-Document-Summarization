New York,  March 10 (CNA) 03/11/07  19:26:37 (By Hwang Jaw-pyng
and Y.L. Kao)

<P>
A Taiwanese delegation consisting of representatives from 21
fishery companies is currently in the United States to take part
in an international seafood fair.
</P>
<P>
The fishery delegation, headed by Hsu Juh-ing, secretary general
of the Taiwan Frozen Seafood Industries Association, will set up
a Taiwanese exhibition pavilion in the 2007 Boston International
Seafood Fair to provide a platform to enhance exchanges between
the fishing industries of the two countries, with the hope of
expanding Taiwan's tilapia markets in northern America, a
delegation spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman quoted tallies released by U.S. Customs as showing
out that in 2006, Taiwan was the fifth largest supplier of
tilapia to the U.S., and tilapia was Taiwan's most competitive
aquacultural export item.
</P>
<P>
Tallies showed that in 2006, Taiwan exported 45,000 tons of
aquacultural products to the U.S., worth US$117.6 million, of
which, tilapia accounted for US$36.54 million, frozen dolphin
accounted for US$24.55 million, squid accounted for US$17.17
million and other aquacultural products.
</P>
<P>
Hsu said that the growing U.S. market for aquacultural products,
especially for tilapia, is good news for those Taiwanese fishing
enterprises attending the trade show.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to last year's success, the number of participating
Taiwanese fishing companies has significantly increased to 21.
</P>
<P>
In connection with the March 11-13 Boston seafood fair, the
Taiwan External Trade Development Council also sent personnel to
arrange exhibitions at a Taiwanese pavilion to promote Taiwan's
farm and fishery products, food, food processing equipment, food
packaging machines as well as other information on foreign trade.
