Taipei,  March 11 (CNA) 03/11/07  23:39:54 (By Sofia Wu)

Premier Su Tseng-chang said Sunday he fully supports ruling
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) Chairman Yu Shyi-kun's "two
noes, one want" advocacy for contenders in the party's
presidential primary.
</P>
<P>
Yu, himself a DPP presidential primary contender, came up with
the advocacy a day earlier, urging all unsuccessful contenders in
the heated race to refrain from joining the 2008 presidential
election on his or her own or quitting the party and should
instead campaign wholeheartedly for the party's nominee for the
next presidency.
</P>
<P>
Asked about his views on Yu's suggestion on the sidelines of a
Chinese Medicine Practitioners Day celebration rally, Su, also a
primary election contender, said he agrees with Yu about the "two
noes, one want" stance. "It's a matter of course," he added.

Two other DPP bigwigs who have thrown their hats into the ring --
Vice President Annette Lu and former Premier Frank Hsieh -- have
accentuated the importance of harmony and unity in the process of
selecting the party's candidate for the 2008 presidential
election.
</P>
<P>
"A ruptured sky lantern cannot fly high. If contestants criticize
each other in the process of mediation or primary election, I
don't think our successful contender in the primary can
eventually win the nationwide presidential race, " Lu said Sunday
while attending a colloquium at the DPP chapter in central
Changhua County.
</P>
<P>
According to the DPP's charter, a primary election should be held
after the negotiation or mediation approach fails.
</P>
<P>
Registration for the DPP's presidential primary ended Friday.
Party members will vote May 6, after which a series of public
opinion polls will be conducted. The vote by party members is
weighted to comprise 30 percent of a would-be candidate's score,
while the public opinion polls count for 70 percent. The
presidential aspirant who receives the highest approval rating
will be named as the party's presidential candidate May 30.
