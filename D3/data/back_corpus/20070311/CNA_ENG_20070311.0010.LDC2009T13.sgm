Taipei, March 11 (CNA) 03/11/07  16:10:34 (By Deborah Kuo)

Taiwan strongly protests against Beijing's moves to have Taiwan's
title changed during a recent World Trade Organization (WTO)
meeting held in Geneva, Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesman
Wang Chien-yeh said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Under Beijing's pressure, Taiwan's title used in all documents
circulated at a global fishery subsidies meeting held in Geneva
March 1-2 under the auspices of the WTO and the United Nation
Environment Programme was changed into "China, Taiwan Province."
</P>
<P>
The Taiwan delegation immediately voiced a strong protest, but
the organizers failed to resume Taiwan's formal title used in the
WTO -- the Separate Customs Territory of Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen
and Matsu, Wang said, adding that the Taiwan delegates then
walked out of the meeting in protest.
</P>
<P>
Wang called for the WTO authorities to show respect for the
rights and interests of every member country of the WTO. Taiwan
was admitted into the WTO as a full member Jan. 1, 2002.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Wang said the Foreign Ministry will throw its full
support behind the Wild Bird Federation Taiwan (WBFT) over a
similar name-change threat.
</P>
<P>
Wang said regardless of any excuse, the Birdlife International
should not ask the WBFT to change its name at the request of
China.
</P>
<P>
Wang said Foreign Ministry officials will assist WBFT workers in
talks with the Birdlife International officials who are scheduled
to come to Taiwan this week to discuss the name-change issue.
