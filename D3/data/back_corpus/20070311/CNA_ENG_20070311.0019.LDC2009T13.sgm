Taipei,  March  11 (CNA) 03/11/07  18:59:40 (By Luis Huang)

<P>
Opposition People First Party (PFP) Legislator Liu Wen-hsiung
announced his decision Sunday to run in the by-election for the
Keelung mayorship, which has become necessary because of the
death of embattled Mayor Hsu Tsai-li.
</P>
<P>
Accompanied by his colleagues Chung Jung-chi and Lee Hung-chun
and a group of his supporters, including main opposition
Kuomintang (KMT) Legislator Wu Yu- sheng, Liu, who lost his
Keelung mayoral bid in 2005 to Hsu, declared his candidacy for
the northern city's mayoral by-election in front of a bronze
statue of the late President Chiang Ching-kuo erected at the
fishing port of Pisha.
</P>
<P>
Liu told his supporters that the reason why he chose to announce
his mayoral bid in front of the bronze statue is because Chiang
used to be the most diligent and honestest political leader in
Taiwan, saying if elected, he will dedicate his life to serve all
Keelung citizens.
</P>
<P>
However, Liu also voiced the hope that the KMT-PFP alliance will
activate the negotiation mechanism as soon as possible so that
the two parties can jointly field a candidate to with the mayoral
by-election slated for May 12.
</P>
<P>
For his part, Lee, who is also PFP spokesman, disclosed that
ranking KMT and PFP officials will hold a first round of
negotiations next week to discuss the issue. He also stressed the
importance of the upcoming negotiations, saying bilateral
negotiation results will demonstrate whether the two parties will
be able to cooperate in the year-end legislative election and the
2008 presidential election.
</P>
<P>
In addition to Liu, Keelung City Council Speaker Chang Tung-jung,
who is also a KMT member, made public his determination last
month to vie for the mayorship.
</P>
<P>
Hsu, who was sentenced to seven years in prison on a graft
charge, died of complications from chronic heart disease Feb. 19
at the age of 60. The Ministry of the Interior has named Hsu
Ching-kun, chief secretary of the Keelung city government, to
serve as acting mayor.
</P>
<P>
According to the country's public functionaries election law, a
by-election should be held within three months after an elective
post becomes vacant if the original office holder has not yet
served half of the term.
