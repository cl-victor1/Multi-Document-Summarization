Enthusiastic visitors formed a long queue Sunday at the Kaohsiung
Harbor to board MV Doulos, the world's oldest ocean-faring
passenger ship, to take in an international book fair.
</P>
<P>
The MV Doulos international book fair opened in Kaohsiung
Saturday aboard the 131-meter long, 17-meter wide, 6,800-ton
Doulos, which is paying its sixth visit to Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
MV Doulos -- built in 1914 and now owned by the German charity
Gute Bucher fur Alle (Good Books for All) -- is opening its
mammoth collection of 500,000 books collected from around the
world to Taiwanese visitors of the floating bookshop. The shop
also acquired another 5,000 copies of Chinese-language books from
Taiwan the day before opening the book fair at the Kaohsiung
Harbor.
</P>
<P>
The MV Doulos, which has been known as SS Medina, the SS Roma and
the MV Franca C. over the years, last visited Taiwan in 2000.
</P>
<P>
The MV Doulos floating bookshop will be open at the Kaohsiung
Harbor until March 26 before heading to Taichung Harbor for
similar fair March 27. The Taichung book fair is slated for March
29-April 9. After visiting Taichung, the ship will stage its
third book fair in Taiwan at Keelung Harbor April 19-May 8, said
Peng Shu-jui, an executive director of MV Doulos book fair
activities in the Taiwan area.
</P>
<P>
The Medina was built in 1914 by Newport News Shipbuilding and Dry
Dock Company for the Mallory Steamship Company of the United
States. At one time a freighter serving in the Atlantic, she
served with the United States Coast Guard during World War II.
</P>
<P>
The ship was converted into a passenger ship in 1948, with cabins
for 287 people and dormitories for an additional 694 people.
</P>
<P>
In 1977, Gute Bucher fur Alle acquired the Franca C. and renamed
her the Doulos. Manned by a volunteer crew since then, the Doulos
has made port calls in over 100 countries around the world.
