DESIGNATION OF DPP CHIEF SUBSTITUTE JUSTIFIABLE: PARTY OFFICIAL
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  March 11 (CNA) 03/11/07  17:52:12 (By Deborah Kuo)

A ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) official said Sunday
that party chief Yu Shyi-kun has been on a "leave of absence" and
has not "resigned", and Yu's designation of Legislator Trong R.
Chai as the party's acting chairman during his absence is
justifiable from all perspectives.
</P>
<P>
Meng Yi-chao, director of the DPP Department of Culture and
Information, said Yu's designation of Chai as the acting chairman
during his leave of absence between March 8 and May 20 was in
line with party precedent and regulations.
</P>
<P>
Discounting a United Daily News report Sunday which said that
Presidential Secretary-General Chiou I-jen might be appointed as
DPP acting chairman in a DPP Central Standing Committee meeting
slated for Wednesday at the directive of President Chen Shui-
bian, Meng said it was a misinterpretation by the daily and he
has not heard any similar remarks made by the president.
</P>
<P>
Meng added that Chai will be an acting chairman to preside over
the DPP Central Standing Committee meeting Wednesday and the
issue involving Chai's being designated by Yu as an acting
chairman can be discussed during that meeting if any DPP party
member wish to take issue with that.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued 7 after registering his candidacy for the
DPP's presidential primary, Yu said he decided to take a leave of
absence from the DPP chairmanship from March 8 in order to devote
his full energy to running for the party's nomination for the
2008 presidential election and that Chai will act for him during
his absence, which triggered a dispute among party members.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the chairmanship is not vacant because Yu only asked
for a leave of absence, Meng said it is natural for Yu to
designate a substitute without compelling the entire party to go
through the trouble of electing an acting chairman.
