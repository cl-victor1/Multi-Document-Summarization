Ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) Chairman Yu Shyi-kun
registered his candidacy Thursday for the party's primary for the
2008 presidential election.
</P>
<P>
Yu, a former premier who also used to be President Chen Shui-
bian's chief of staff, was the second DPP bigwig to register for
the DPP presidential primary after Vice President Annette Lu who
completed her registration Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Former Premier Frank Hsieh is scheduled to register his candidacy
for the DPP primary at 10 a.m. Thursday and Premier Su Tsen-chang
will also follow suit later in the day.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, Yu issued a statement on his decision to take a
leave of absence from DPP chairmanship from Thursday so that he
can devote his full energy to run in the party primary.
</P>
<P>
During his absence from March 8 through May 20, Yu said DPP
Legislator Trong Chai, who is also a member of the DPP Central
Standing Committee, will serve as DPP acting chairman. It is
hoped that his "leave of absence" will set a model in ensuring
neutrality and impartiality in party primary, Yu added in his
statement.
