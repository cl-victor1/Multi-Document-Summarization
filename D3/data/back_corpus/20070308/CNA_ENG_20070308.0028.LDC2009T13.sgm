FREEDOM OF SPEECH PRIZE FOUNDER DIES IN NEW YORK
</HEADLINE>

New York,  March 7 (CNA) 03/08/07  19:06:29 (By Lillian Lin and
Deborah Kuo)
</P>
<P>
New York-based veteran Taiwan journalist Chang Chao-ying, who
established a prize worth US$30,000 annually to champion freedom
of speech and media ethics, died of lung cancer at a hospital in
New York Wednesday at the age of 74.
</P>
<P>
Chang, brought up in an elite and rich Taipei family at the turn
of  Japanese colonization  and  Kuomintang  rule,  was  a
journalist-official who worked for the then-KMT government
between 1967 and 1998 in New York and Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
He witnessed the process of Taiwan's democratization and paid
close attention to Taiwan's democratic development, even during
his last years living in New York.
</P>
<P>
The freedom of speech prize -- dubbed "the FAPA Chang Chao-ying
Prize for Freedom of Speech and Media Ethics" and awarded
annually to individuals whose actions promote freedom of speech
and media ethics -- was established by Chang on his sickbed with
the assistance of his American son-in-law Brian Scanlan, a
computer software businessman who promised to foot the bill for
the prize for 10 consecutive years.
</P>
<P>
Scanlan traveled to Taipei March 4 to take part in a ceremony
marking the 25th founding anniversary  of the Washington-based
Formosan Association for Public Affairs (FAPA), in which he
announced the inception of the prize.
</P>
<P>
During the ceremony, FAPA Chairman C.T. Lee said the association
will help select the prizewinners and organize the prize
presentation ceremony every year.
</P>
<P>
Lee said FAPA hopes the award will eventually become known as "a
Pulitzer Prize of Taiwan."
</P>
<P>
Chang died one day after Scanlan returned to New York to tell him
about the establishment of the prize.
</P>
<P>
Chang's rich life -- which benefited from broad international
experience that his contemporaries rarely enjoyed -- was featured
in his 2006 prize-winning and best-selling dictated autobiography
titled "90-Banchi, Miyamae-Cho."
</P>
<P>
Chang wrote that his concerns for Taiwan went beyond party lines
and that "Taiwanese people have the right to decide their own
future. While people may be different in their preferences for
unification or independence, everybody's freedom of speech should
be respected."
