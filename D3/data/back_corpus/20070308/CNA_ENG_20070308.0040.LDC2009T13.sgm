Taipei,  March 8 (CNA) 03/08/07  21:48:43 (By Flor Wang)

Two hopefuls threw their hat in the ring Thursday for the main
opposition Kuomintang's (KMT's) chairmanship by-election  --  the
party's acting Chairman Wu Po-hsiung and Legislator Hung Hsiu-
chu.
</P>
<P>
Both of them contributed NT$2 million in campaigning fees and
picked up registration forms for the chairmanship by-election
earlier in the day.
</P>
<P>
According to the KMT's schedule,  there will be a 10-day
campaigning period for Wu and Hung from March 28-April 6, and the
two are required to register their bids for the chairmanship with
the party March 18. KMT members will then elect a new chairman in
a direct vote April 7.
</P>
<P>
Former KMT Chairman Ma Ying-jeou resigned from the KMT's top post
in mid- February after being indicted on corruption charges over
alleged embezzlement from a special municipal monthly allowance
for his discretionary use when serving as mayor of Taipei from
1998-2006. Ma announced his bid to take part in the next
presidential election immediately after quitting the top KMT job.
</P>
<P>
Saying that vying for the KMT chairmanship was originally not a
part of his life development plans, Wu promised to do his best to
win this opportunity to serve the party at a time when the KMT
finds itself at a historic juncture with the approaching
legislative elections in December and the March 2008 presidential
election.
</P>
<P>
For her part, Hung announced that she will quit the KMT's
legislative primary and stressed her resolve to compete for the
party's chairmanship in a news conference.
</P>
<P>
Hung expressed  hope that her participation  in the KMT's by-
election for chairman will bring "new choices, new thinking and
new hope" for the party. "Only competition will push the KMT to
evolve," she said.
