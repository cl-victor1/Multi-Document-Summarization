<P>
Stress can now be detected using only a few drops of saliva
thanks to a new detection method developed at a Taipei-based
hospital, medical sources said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Liang Wei-bin, director of Health Management Center at Lian-an
Wellness Center, said that stress levels affect the amount of
adrenal cortisol released, and that excessive corticoid caused by
high stress reduces the number of lymphocytes and thereby impairs
immunity.
</P>
<P>
Common symptoms include fatigue, anxiety, and dysphoria, he said,
adding that without proper treatment the condition could develop
into depression.
</P>
<P>
If so, treatment with dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEA-S) can
redress the negative effects, Liang noted.
</P>
<P>
With this new means of detection, Liang explained, patients can
now measure their stress status by testing the volume of
corticoid and DHEA-S in their saliva and seeking professional
opinions before chronic diseases develop.
</P>
<P>
However, at present, stress detection is costly in terms of both
money and time, requiring a minimum of NT$5,500 (about US$167)
and three to four days to obtain results.
