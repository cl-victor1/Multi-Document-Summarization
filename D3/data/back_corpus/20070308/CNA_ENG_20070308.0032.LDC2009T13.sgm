LEGISLATIVE SPEAKER DENIES REPORT ON PAIRING UP WITH EX-KMT HEAD
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Taipei,  March  8 (CNA) 03/08/07  20:17:35 (By Flor Wang)
</P>
<P>
Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng denied a media report
Thursday that he has agreed to form a presidential  ticket with
former Kuomintang (KMT)  Chairman Ma Yin-jeou, describing it as
fabricated news and saying that it is still "too early" to talk
about the issue.
</P>
<P>
Wang made the remarks while answering questions from reporters
after it was reported a day earlier that through mediation by KMT
acting Chairman Wu Po- hsiung, both Ma and Wang agreed to invite
the other to serve as his running mate if fielded by the KMT as
its candidate to run in the 2008 presidential election.
</P>
<P>
Out of desire to avoid a KMT split in the 2008 presidential race,
Wu called Wednesday for the creation of a KMT presidential ticket
involving the two men during a weekly meeting of the party's
powerful Central Standing Committee.
</P>
<P>
Arguing that it is wrong to believe that a KMT presidential
ticket has been taking shape as reported  because substantial
negotiations have not even started, Wang said that creating a KMT
presidential ticket with Ma is out of the question at present.
</P>
<P>
The key point of Wu's proposal that the successful KMT nominee,
irrespective of whether Ma or himself wins the primary, should
invite the other to team up to contend the 2008 presidential
election, and the formation of a Ma-Wang or Wang- Ma ticket
depends on whether either of them would agree to such an
invitation, Wang said.
</P>
<P>
However, Wang reiterated that if nominated by the KMT as its
presidential candidate, he will definitely honor his promise and
invite Ma to pair up on a ticket with him.
</P>
<P>
Both Wang and Ma, the two major players in the KMT's presidential
primary that will being in April, expressed willingness a day
earlier to invite the other to form a presidential ticket to
avoid a split if nominated by the party to vie for the next
presidency.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, KMT lawmakers were happy to know that Wang and Ma have
initially voiced willingness to cooperate in the race, although
they acknowledged that a full resolution of the issue remains
some way off.
</P>
<P>
"Wang and Ma must respect each other to ensure that their
collaboration continues and this is what the KMT supporters are
concerned about," KMT lawmaker Hsu Chung-hsiung said.
</P>
<P>
KMT lawmaker Lin Yu-feng urged the KMT to quickly settle its
primary mechanism so as to end the public's suspicions that the
party is still engaged in closed- door politics.
