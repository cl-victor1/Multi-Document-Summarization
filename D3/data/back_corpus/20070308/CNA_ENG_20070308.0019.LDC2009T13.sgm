The Taiwan Semiconductor  Industry Association (TSIA) and the
Taiwan TFT LCD Association (TTLA) signed an agreement with the
Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) Thursday, pledging to
voluntarily conserve energy and cut carbon dioxide emissions.
</P>
<P>
TSIA Chairman Huang Chung-jen and TTLA Chairman Ho Shao-yang
inked the agreement with Minister of Economic Affairs Chen Ruey-
long on behalf of a total of 16 member manufacturers of the two
associations.
</P>
<P>
Under the terms of the agreement, both semiconductor and TFT LCD
manufacturers are expected to cut their carbon dioxide emissions
by 24 million tons during the 2006-2010 period.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a signing ceremony held at the Taipei International
Convention Center, Chen said that since Taiwan is not a signatory
to the Kyoto Protocol, the nation has not faced pressure from the
international agreement aimed at reducing greenhouse gas
emissions.
</P>
<P>
However,  Chen noted that several of Taiwan's  neighboring
countries such as South Korea, India and China are seeking to
acquire more know-how and funds to help them achieve the goal.
</P>
<P>
Greenhouse gas emission projects launched by China and South
Korea are aimed at reducing global warming, Chen said, adding
that their greenhouse gas emission reductions account for 52
percent of globally registered reductions under the Clean
Development Mechanism (CDM).
</P>
<P>
Chen further said that in the foreseeable future, international
pressure on the two nations to reduce greenhouse gas emissions
will be relatively eased, which he said is expected to have an
adverse impact on Taiwan's industrial competitiveness.
</P>
<P>
According to Chen, the government has set an objective of
reducing the nation's greenhouse gas emissions by 10 percent from
the 2000 level, while the MOEA set up an office in charge of
promoting greenhouse gas emissions last year.
</P>
<P>
After the U.N.-initiated Kyoto Protocol came into force in
February 2005, several high greenhouse gas-emitting industries,
such as petrochemicals, cement, pulp and paper, steel and man-
made fiber, as well as fabric or piece goods printing, dyeing and
finishing industries, jointly signed a similar agreement with the
MOEA.
