LAWMAKERS CALL FOR EXPULSION OF AP CORRESPONDENT
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  March  8 (CNA) 03/08/07  12:04:09 (By Maubo Chang)
</P>
<P>
A group of lawmakers of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) called for the government Thursday to expel an AP
correspondent who used Beijing's criticism of Vice President
Annette Lu in a March 6 story about Lu's presidential bid.
</P>
<P>
The DPP lawmakers, led by Wang Sing-Nan, told a news conference
that the AP correspondent Min Lee had demonstrated no regard for
Taiwan's elected leader and should no longer be allowed to work
in the country.
</P>
<P>
His remarks echoed the opinion of a group of Taiwan Solidarity
Union lawmakers who urged the government to kick Lee out of the
country as a "persona non grata."
</P>
<P>
Government Information Office Minister Cheng Wen-tsang said at
the same news conference that Lee is an AP correspondent posted
in Hong Kong and that he entered Taiwan with a tourist visa,
which falls under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Foreign
Affairs rather than his office.
</P>
<P>
Lee raised the eyebrows of DPP supporters by citing China media's
criticism of Annette Lu as an "insane" splittist and the "scum of
the nation" in his story.
</P>
<P>
The story trigged a political storm in Taipei after it was
published by CNN.com with the headline "Taiwan's 'scum of the
nation' runs for president."
