A contract for the first local vaccine manufacturing plant for
influenza will be signed by the Center for Disease Control (CDC)
and the Netherlands-based Akzo Nobel within two months,
government officials said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The contract which took one year to hammer out will be signed no
later than April.

The plant should enter mass production by 2010, with an annual
output of 16 million doses of flu vaccine, they said, adding that
the government has given a 10-year procurement guarantee of no
less than 5 million doses per year.
</P>

According to the CDC, Akzo Nobel's total investment will amount
some NT$4 billion (approximately US$121 million), with half going
to construction and the other half to funding vaccine packaging,
clinical testing and effectiveness reviews.

Chen  Chei-hsiang,  director  of  the  Biotechnology  and
Pharmaceutical Industries Program Office under the Ministry of
Economic Affairs, said Akzo Nobel has also decided to add a
vaccine research and development center to the previously agreed
upon vaccine plant, expanding further their production capacity
in Taiwan.

Chen said the Akzo Nobel complex, designated to be located in the
Hsinchu Biomedical Park, will be joined by several CDC branch
offices and National Health Research Institute vaccine facilities
to form a springboard for Taiwan's vaccine industry.
