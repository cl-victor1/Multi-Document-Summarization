AP PRESIDENT TO RESPOND TO VICE PRESIDENT'S PROTEST
</HEADLINE>

New York,  March 7 (CNA) 03/08/07  16:19:40 (By Lillian Lin,

</P>
<P>
Associated Press (AP) President and CEO Tom Curley will respond
to a protest from Vice President Annette Lu soon over an
inappropriate reference the news agency made about her when it
reported on her presidential bid, a Taiwan official stationed in
New York said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Shao Ping-yun, head of the information division at the Taipei
Economic and Cultural Office in New York, made the remarks after
relaying Lu's letter of protest to AP headquarters, where Shao
met with a senior AP executive in charge of international news
coverage to exchange views on the controversy.
</P>
<P>
In their talks, Shao said, the AP executive described AP as an
independent agency that has maintained a long relationship with
Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the controversial AP dispatch from Taipei Tuesday
concerning Lu's announcement of her ambition for the next
presidency, the AP executive said the AP reporter merely quoted
terms used by Chinese news media and academics to describe Lu,
arguing that the reporter used quotation marks around the
controversial wordings.
</P>
<P>
The AP story described Lu as an "outspoken" vice president who
China has called "insane" and "the scum of the nation." The Cable
News Network (CNN) posted the AP article on its Web site later
that day under the derogatory headline: "Taiwan's 'scum of the
nation' runs for president."
</P>
<P>
Noting that CNN is an AP subscriber, the AP executive was quoted
as having told Shao that the news agency would not have expected
CNN to have used such an improper title.
</P>
<P>
The executive also argued that AP is not in a position to control
its subscribers' handling of news stories, including the wording
of headlines.
</P>
<P>
He added that the AP would feel it regrettable if its report has
sparked Lu's ire or discomfort.
</P>
<P>
According to Shao, the AP headquarters will discuss the issue
with its Taipei office before deciding how to respond to Lu's
protest.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan's Government Information Office (GIO) has expressed hope
that the AP headquarters will attach importance to Lu's protest
and come up with concrete remedial measures.
</P>
<P>
After asking the GIO's overseas offices to convey her letters of
protest to AP and CNN, Lu demanded that the two media outlets
respond to her protests within 48 hours. Otherwise, Lu said, she
would file complaints with major international human rights
groups and media watchdog bodies over the issue.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Chang Chung-jen, head of the GIO's Atlanta, Georgia
office, has forwarded Lu's letter of protest to CNN headquarters
and was awaiting a response from CNN management. The letter was
addressed to a CNN vice president in charge of the CNN Web site.
