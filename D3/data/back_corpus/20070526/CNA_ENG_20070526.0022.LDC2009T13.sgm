The world's largest passenger airliner, the Airbus A380, will

Narita Airport June 4-6 and then go to Sydney Airport in
Australia June 6-8, before heading to Taiwan June 8-10.

The twin-deck Airbus A380, which can carry 525 passengers, made
successful trips to New Delhi and Mumbai in India May 6-10 and
will move on to visit North America, the Middle East and China
after its Asian trip.

The demonstration is to ensure successful airport compatibility,
ground handling and maintenance procedure tests at airports
around the world, the spokesman said, adding that the A380 has
passed tests at 45 airports so far and will have passed tests at
more than 70 airports by 2011.

followed by other deliveries to Emirates Airlines and Quantas

airliner, the spokesman said.
