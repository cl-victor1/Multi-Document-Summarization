CLA PROPOSES COMPLEMENTARY MEASURES FOR MINIMUM WAGE HIKE
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taipei, May 26 (CNA) 05/26/07  17:48:07 (By Ruth Wang)

<P>
The Council of Labor Affairs (CLA) has drafted five complementary
measures to handle potential negative effects of a minimum wage
hike to be implemented later this year, CLA Chairman Lu Tien-lin
said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The CLA has adjusted the hourly basic wage from NT$66 (US$1.98)
to NT$95, an increase of 9.09 percent rather than the 7.58
percent expected by enterprises, Lu said.
</P>
<P>
Lu said that after negotiation, enterprises are willing to
increase the minimum wage from NT$66 to NT$87 in the first year
of implementation, and further adjust it upward to NT$95 in the
second year.
</P>
<P>
In order to ease the burden on enterprises and encourage their
cooperation, Lu said the CLA will provide a NT$10 hourly subsidy
in the first year for each part-time laborer who has worked
longer than three months at fast food restaurants, gas stations,
supermarkets and shopping malls, as one of the five complementary
measures to make up the gap between NT$87 and NT$95.
</P>
<P>
Lu said the CLA can carry out this measure as fewer than 180,000
part-time workers are qualified to receive the subsidies.
</P>
<P>
The second measure is to give small-and medium-sized enterprises
monthly subsidies of NT$5,000 for each of their employees who are
single mothers, women re-entering the workforce, or workers over
the age of 40, Lu said.
</P>
<P>
The third measure is that employers can increase the amount of
foreign laborers' boarding fees that is supposed to be deducted
form their salaries, Lu said. Currently employers only deduct
NT$2,300-NT$2,500, so there is still ample room for adjustment,
since the upper deduction set by the government is NT$4,000, Lu
added.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Lu said the CLA will also raise its highest subsidies
for vocational training from 40 percent to 70 percent and will
also help find jobs for laborers who lose their jobs due to the
wage hike policy.
