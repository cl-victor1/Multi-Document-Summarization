KMT OFFICIAL SPEAKS ON STRATEGY FOR WINNING PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taipei,  May 26 (CNA) 05/26/07  18:45:32 (By Lilian Wu)

<P>
The opposition Kuomintang's strategy for winning the 2008
presidential election will be "to win more in northern Taiwan and
lose less in southern Taiwan, " a KMT official said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Liao Feng-teh, director of the KMT's Organizational Development
Department, made the remarks during a coordination conference of
KMT mayors and county magistrates held at the Taipei county
government headquarters. KMT presidential candidate Ma Ying-jeou
was also present to solicit their support.
</P>
<P>
Liao noted that northern Taiwan traditionally tilts toward the
candidates of the "pan-blue alliance" led by the KMT, while
southern Taiwan is traditionally a stronghold of the "pan-green
camp" led by the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP).
</P>
<P>
He said that the year-end legislative  elections  and the
presidential election are equally important.
</P>
<P>
If the KMT wins the presidential election but does not achieve
victory in the legislative elections, the situation will be the
same as that dogging President Chen Shui-bian, whose DPP suffers
from being a minority in the opposition- dominated legislature.
</P>
<P>
But if the KMT wins over half of the legislative seats but lose
the presidential election, the situation will remain the same as
at present.
</P>
<P>
Pointing at the persistent bickering between the "pan-blue
alliance" and the "pan-green camp, " he said that only if the
party wins both elections can the country break out of its
current standoff.
</P>
<P>
He told the participants that they play a "pivotal role" in the
year-end legislative elections.
</P>
<P>
The elections will adopt the new "single-member constituency, two
vote" electoral system, which he said will take equal
consideration of political parties and candidates. The difference
in the number of ballots garnered by candidates of different
parties will not be big, and an election victory will lie in the
5 percent of wavering voters.
</P>
<P>
Whichever political party can solicit the support of the 5
percent of undecided voters will win the legislative elections,
he said.
