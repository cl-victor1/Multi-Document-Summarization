CHINA WANTS TO ERASE ROC, ANNEX TAIWAN: MAC OFFICIAL
</HEADLINE>

Taipei, May 26 (CNA) 05/26/07  19:16:51 (By Elizabeth Hsu)

China's ongoing suppression of Taiwan in the latter's bid for
participation in international activities over the past few years
is driven by its attempt to eradicate the Republic of China and
annex Taiwan, Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) Vice Chairman Tung
Chen-yuan said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Describing the attempts as outrageous, Tung expressed Taiwan's
strong protest and extreme resentment over China's suppression,
referring to a resolution proposed by China to downgrade Taiwan's
membership status in the Paris-based World Organization for
Animal Health (OIE).
</P>
<P>
Tung made the remarks in an address to the opening of the 2007
Youth Scholar Forum held by National Taiwan Normal University.
</P>
<P>
Talking about the OIE issue, Tung accused China of "blackmailing"
the OIE with its political power amidst the increasingly
important subject of animal epidemics.
</P>
<P>
The OIE's highest authority, the International Committee, passed
the resolution a day earlier during its general assembly, saying
that the OIE notes China's view that the People's Republic of
China is China's only legitimate government of the "whole" of
China, which it describes as including Taiwan, and that Taiwan
can only take part in the OIE as a "non-sovereign regional
member" under the appellation of "Chinese Taipei."
</P>
<P>
The resolution was passed with a vote of 113-12, with five
abstentions. The United States voted for the resolution, while
Japan abstained.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan joined the OIE in 1954 under the name of "Republic of
China (Taiwan), " but was forced to change it to "Taipei China"
after Beijing was admitted to the organization in 1992.
</P>
<P>
However, China remained dissatisfied with the alteration. In an
attempt to push the OIE to make a further concession to change
Taiwan's membership name, China has refused to participate in OIE
activities or pay its membership fees.
</P>
<P>
To try to resolve the problem, the OIE International Committee
passed a resolution in 2003 to change Taiwan's membership name
from "Taipei China" into "Separate Quarantine Territory of
Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen and Matsu. "
</P>
<P>
At that time, Taiwan made clear that it would accept the new name
but China refused to accept the resolution and did not take part
in the final vote on the issue.
