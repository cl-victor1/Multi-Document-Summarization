A cardboard cut-out of a person was installed at every Taiwan
High Speed Rail (THSR) station Saturday, bearing the caption "Are
You the Lucky 5 Millionth Person?"

The THSR company expects the 5 millionth THSR ticket will be sold
soon, the buyer of which will receive 10 free tickets for
business class travel on the train, THSR officials said.

The winner will be able to use the tickets at any time within one
year and will also be given four models of the high speed train.

As of Saturday, more than 4.9 million THSR tickets had been sold
since the rail system began commercial operations Jan. 5,
according to the THSR, which also revealed that the accumulated
number of THSR passengers is growing by an average of over 40,000
per day.

The THSR passenger before, and the one after the 5 millionth will

train.

THSR officials reminded travelers to take note of the number
printed on the bottom left corner of their tickets so that they
do not miss the chance of winning the prize.
