Frank Hsieh, presidential candidate of Taiwan's ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) , will put off a visit to the United
States to mid-July, a DPP source said Friday.
</P>
<P>
According to a DPP official in charge of party affairs on the U.
S. west coast, Hsie  has decided to postpone his visit from the
original date in late June to mid-July because many key U.S.
figures will not be in Washington, D.C. in late June or early
July.

<P>
Hsieh is now slated to leave Taipei July 18 for Washington, D.C.,
where he will meet U.S. officials and thinktank members.  He will
proceed to New York July 25 and depart for Los Angeles July 28,
the DPP officials said, adding  that Taiwanese expatriates in the
Los Angeles area will host parties to display their strong
support for Hsieh's presidential bid.

Meanwhile, the party official also said that DPP Chairman Yu
Shyi-kun, leading a 10-member group of high-ranking party
officials, will arrive in Los Angeles June 8 on the first leg of
a U.S tour aimed at gaining an understanding of the party's
overseas operations and soliciting voter support for the DPP in
the 2008 presidential election.

Yu will also visit Houston and New York, according to the DPP
official.
