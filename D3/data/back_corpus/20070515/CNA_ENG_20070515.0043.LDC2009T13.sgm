Six air force jet fighters completed a successful emergency
landing drill on a closed section of the Sun Yat-sen Freeway
Tuesday as part of the ongoing combined forces Huan Kuang 23
military exercise.
</P>
<P>
Two each of the air forces' three mainstay types of fighters --
the U.S.-built F-16, the French Mirage 2000-5 and the locally
developed Indigenous Defense Fighter (IDF) -- swooped down to
land and take off from the six-lane section of freeway in central
Taiwan as the military responded to a simulated attack by China
at the start of the extensive live-fire war games.
</P>
<P>
In the exercises, the F-16s were armed with advanced AIM-120 air-
to-air missiles and Mirages were equipped with MICA medium-range
air-to-air missiles while IDFs were not armed.
</P>
<P>
The six fighters screeched to a halt in quick succession along
the Huatan section of freeway in Changhua County in central
Taiwan, had their fuel tanks and munitions pods topped off by Air
Force personnel and took off to face another wave of imagined
attackers from China.
</P>
<P>
The drill attracted many media professionals, including 50
foreign correspondents.
</P>
<P>
Squadron leader Lt. Col. Wang Kai-ming said pilots involved in
the landing felt a lot of pressure because of the unusual nature
of the runway.
</P>
<P>
"It was very difficult to do this, " he said. "But we were
successful in accomplishing our mission."
</P>
<P>
The freeway landing scenario was developed to prepare the
Taiwanese military to deal with the possibility that local air
bases would be knocked out by Chinese aerial bombardment.
