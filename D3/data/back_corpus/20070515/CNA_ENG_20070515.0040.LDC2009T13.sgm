HEALTH MINISTER REBUTS CHINA'S CLAIMS ON WHO
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  May 15 (CNA) 05/15/07  23:15:54 (By T.C. Jiang)

Minister of Health Hou Sheng-mao said in Geneva Tuesday that
Taiwan has faced obstructions from China in its participation in
World Health Organization (WHO) affairs, rebutting Chinas claim
that it attaches great importance to the health rights of the
people of Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
The remarks came after Chinese Health Minister Gao Qiang said
Monday at the World Health Assembly (WHA) that Beijing has long
taken into consideration the health rights of the Taiwan people,
which is why it signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) with
the WHO under the one-China principle. The MOU has enabled Taiwan
to send 23 people to attend various technical conferences
organized by the WHO, Gao claimed.
</P>
<P>
Hou, who is visiting Geneva to drum up support for Taiwan's bid
to join the WHO as a full member, responded that the WHO holds
more than 1,000 professional health conferences every year, only
a few of which Taiwan is allowed to attend.
</P>
<P>
Hou noted that the MOU sets limits on Taiwan's applications to
attend the conferences,  the level of participating  Taiwanese
officials, and the use of the country's official name. Even if
Taiwan files an application in advance, China usually delays its
approval so that Taiwanese representatives cannot receive an
invitation from the WHO in time, according to Hou.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Hou said that 16 out of the 23 people were able to
attend the conferences only due to Taiwan's sole efforts.
</P>
<P>
He added that Taiwanese and Chinese health and medical experts
have frequent exchanges because Taiwanese experts are often
invited to China to share Taiwan's experience in advanced
healthcare systems, public medical care and hospital management.
</P>
<P>
China reports its infectious diseases to Taiwan because Beijing
has to follow the International Health Regulations (IHR), not
because China is particularly concerned about Taiwan, Hou said.
