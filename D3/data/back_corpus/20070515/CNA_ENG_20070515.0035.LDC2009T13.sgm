TAIWAN'S NEW WHO BIDDING STRATEGY NOT A FAILURE: SOCHOLARS
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  May 15 (CNA) 05/15/07  21:52:25 (By Chris Wang)

Although Taiwan's bid to join the World Health Organization (WHO)
as a full member was rebuffed again, the new strategy it
presented this year has "not been a failure" as it took the issue
to a new "moral high ground" instead of political disputes
between Taiwan and China, according to scholars attending a forum
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan's new strategy to bid for full WHO membership instead of
trying for observer status in the World Health Assembly (WHA)
"challenged the WHO on its founding principle of 'health for all'
and made the international community question whether the
organization has yielded to political reality, thus taking the
people of Taiwan to the moral high ground, " said David Huang, an
associate research fellow at Academia Sinica's Institute of
European and American Studies (IEAS).
</P>
<P>
The new proposal also shows the world that Taiwan has not been
happy with its minimal participation  in WHO activities,  the
illegitimacy of the way it has been treated in the bidding
process, and the illegality of a memorandum of understanding that
the WHO Secretariat signed privately with China in 2005,
according to Lin Cheng-yi, a research fellow at Academia Sinica's
IEAS.
</P>
<P>
In a "broader perspective, " Taiwan did not lose in the
international spectrum, said Lo Chi-cheng, a professor at Soochow
University who serves as the executive commissioner of Taiwan
Thinktank, organizer of the forum that reviewed Taiwan's strategy
in its 2007 WHO bid.
</P>
<P>
"The U.S. and Japan are still supportive of Taiwan's bid as a WHA
observer, and the European Union maintains its support of
Taiwan's meaningful participation in WHO activities as well. In
other words, Taiwan has not taken a step back. Instead, Taiwan
has expressed its position more clearly, " Lo said.
</P>
<P>
The scholars also claimed that Taiwan's proposal this year made
it "once again the limelight" of the annual WHA meeting, and
claimed that this will be helpful for Taiwan's promotion for its
WHO bid, that first started in 1995.
</P>
<P>
It called into question among countries all over the world
whether it is fair that Taiwan, a country that has donated over
US$300 million during the past 10 years to more than 90 countries
for international medical and humanitarian relief, has not been
accepted as a WHO member, according to Chiu Ya-wen, a researcher
at the National Health Research Institute.
</P>
<P>
Just 17 countries voted in favor of Taiwan's membership being
discussed, while 148 voted against the idea.
