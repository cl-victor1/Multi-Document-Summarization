PFP SEEKING KMT BACKING TO TOPPLE NEW CABINET
</HEADLINE>

Taipei, May 15 (CNA) 05/15/07  22:27:28 (By Flor Wang)
</P>
<P>
The opposition People First Party (PFP) will seek backing from
its ally -- the main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) -- to topple the
Cabinet to be formed by Premier-designate Chang Chun-hsiung after
he assumes the post, PFP legislative caucus whip Fu Kun-chi said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Fu made the comments at a Legislative Yuan news conference after
Chang, a lawmaker and chairman of the semi-official Straits
Exchange Foundation, was appointed a day earlier by President
Chen Shui-bian to take over the post from outgoing Premier Su
Tseng-chang, who offered to resign last Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Chang has made clear that he will assume the
premiership May 21 and that the present Cabinet will resign en
masse Wednesday. This will be the second time Chang has served as
premier.
</P>
<P>
According to Fu, PFP lawmakers decided to topple the new Cabinet
to be led by Chang because he was listed as persona non grata by
lawmakers when he first served as premier from October 2000
through Jan. 31, 2002.
</P>
<P>
Calling Chang extremely inadequate to serve as premier due to his
past performance, and a "pawn" of Chen, Fu pointed out that
Chang's precipitous halting of the construction of the fourth
nuclear power plant in late 2000 seriously damaged Taiwan's
international image and business interests.
</P>
<P>
In addition, he argued, the number of Taiwan's suicides and
jobless grew rapidly when Chang served as premier.
</P>
<P>
Due to Chang's poor record and the ruling Democratic Progressive
Party's inability to stabilize the political situation, PFP
lawmakers came up with the decision to topple his Cabinet, Fu
said, adding that his party will seek the KMT's support as soon
as possible to raise a no-confidence vote against the Cabinet,
pushing Chen to dissolve the legislature and allowing for a new
legislative election.
</P>
<P>
According to PFP spokesman Lee Hung-chun, the KMT's attitude will
be the key to his party's plan as the PFP only controls 21 seats
in the 219-member Legislative Yuan, far short of the lowest legal
threshold of 50-percent support.
</P>
<P>
Tseng Yung-chuan, a KMT lawmaker and director of the party's
Central Policy Coordination Committee, said the KMT is not
opposed to the PFP's no-confidence vote initiative but added that
it will have to first assess whether Chang is willing to do
something to break the deadlock in the Legislative Yuan over the
draft Central Election Commission (CEC) Organic Law.
</P>
<P>
Chang, a DPP lawmaker, knows very clearly that the present
impasse in the legislature is a result of DPP lawmakers' failure
to act in accordance with its regulations, Tseng said, adding
that Chang stands a good chance of displaying his leadership if
he can resolve the gridlock.
