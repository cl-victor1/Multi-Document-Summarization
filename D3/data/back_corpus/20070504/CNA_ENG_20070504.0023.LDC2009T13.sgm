Former Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Ma Ying-jeou may meet with
Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-ping Monday to discuss creating
a ticket to run in the 2008 presidential election, sources close
to Ma's camp said Friday.
</P>
<P>
According to the sources, a much-discussed Ma-Wang meeting may
take place Monday at the earliest after Ma called Thursday to set
up, as soon as possible, such a tete-a-tete in order to invite
Wang to serve as his running mate. Ma was nominated Tuesday by
the main opposition KMT as its presidential candidate despite
embezzlement charges against him.
</P>
<P>
During the upcoming meeting, Ma will elaborate on his vision for
Taiwan and delve into his governing philosophy, the sources said,
adding that Ma will also explain his position concerning his
ongoing trial on the corruption charges in response to Wang's
concern over the matter.

<P>
As Wang firmly insists that trust-worthy third parties must also
be present in the meeting, KMT Honorary Chairman Lien Chan and
KMT Chairman Wu Poh-hsiung may attend the meeting, the sources
said.
</P>
<P>
According to KMT spokesman Su Chun-ping, it is natural that Wu
take part as the incumbent party chief has been keen to pair up
Ma and Wang on a presidential ticket.
</P>
<P>
Against such a backdrop, the meeting is expected to involve Ma,
Wang, Lien and Wu, Su said.
