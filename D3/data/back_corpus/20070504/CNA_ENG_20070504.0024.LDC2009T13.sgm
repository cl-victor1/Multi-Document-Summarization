MOFA ORGANIZING RALLIES TO GALVANIZE TAIWAN'S WHO BID
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  May 4 (CNA) 05/04/07  18:42:00 (By Deborah Kuo)
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) is organizing rallies in
Taiwan's two largest cities and in New York May 12 as a part of
efforts to galvanize support for Taiwan's bid to join the World
Health Organization (WHO) as a full member, MOFA officials said
Friday.
</P>
<P>
People are urged to join the rallies, to be held simultaneously
in Taipei, Kaohsiung and New York May 12 to make known the strong
desire of Taiwan's people to join the WHO, MOFA officials said.
</P>
<P>
The foreign ministry has launched an online campaign regarding
the rallies. Titled "Taiwan joins WHO, I care, you care, " the
campaign has attracted 7,668 signatures in just two days, the
officials said, adding that more are urged to sign up for the
rallies at http://www.bewhotaiwan.com.tw.
</P>
<P>
The rallies will provide Taiwan's people with a convenient
opportunity to let the world hear them speak clearly with one
voice, officials said, noting that 95 percent of people in a
recent public opinion poll said that Taiwan should be admitted
into the WHO as a full member.
</P>
<P>
They added that Taiwan has failed in all of its attempts to join
the World Health Assembly (WHA) -- the top decision-making body
of the WHO -- as an observer over the past 10 years.
</P>
<P>
The 23 million people of Taiwan have been isolated and excluded
from the world health regulatory body and its activities even
during the height of the pandemic of severe acute respiratory
syndrome (SARS) and other epidemic diseases, resulting in a
serious gap in the global public health protection network, they
pointed out.
</P>
<P>
On the diplomatic front, President Chen Shui-bian lodged "a
protest in the strongest terms" against the WHO Secretariat April
29, saying that Taiwan's bid to join the WHO is not an issue that
could be denied or decided by the secretariat or any individual
working for the WHO.
</P>
<P>
Taking the former East Germany as an example, Chen said whether
Taiwan should be admitted into the WHO as a full member is an
issue that should be determined by all member countries of the
WHO.
</P>
<P>
Chen appealed to the WHO Secretariat and WHO Director-General
Margaret Chan to handle Taiwan's accession bid in accordance with
the WHO laws and spirit and refer Taiwan's membership application
to the World Health Assembly so that all WHO members can discuss
the issue and reach a decision when they meet in mid- May.
