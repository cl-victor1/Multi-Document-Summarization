<P>
The ratio of people who are in favor of conditional opening of
direct cross- Taiwan Strait transportation links has dropped to a
seven-year low, the Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The results were contained in a survey on public views on cross-
strait relations conducted by National Chengchi University on the
commission of the MAC. The survey interviewed 1,072 people April
20-22 with a margin of error of 2.99 percent.
</P>
<P>
On the issue of direct cross-strait transportation, 69.3 percent
polled favor "conditional opening, " compared with 14.8 percent
who favor "unconditional opening."
</P>
<P>
Polls have shown that the ratio of those who favor conditional
opening reached its height at 83.2 percent in April 2000 and that
the ratio has since slipped, dropping to 70.3 percent last
December.
</P>
<P>
MAC spokesman Liu Te-hsun said he will continue to monitor the
situation in the hope of learning the reasons for the downward
trend.
</P>
<P>
The poll also found that 77.3 percent of the people polled are in
favor of joining  the United Nations  and other international
organizations under the name of "Taiwan."
</P>
<P>
After failed attempts to join the World Health Organization (WHO)
as an observer over the past decade, Taiwan will bid for
membership for the first time under the name of "Taiwan" when the
World Health Assembly, the decision-making body of the WHO,
convenes later this month in Geneva, Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
On the issue of pursuing unification with China or seeking Taiwan
independence, the ratio of those who favor a broadly defined
status quo is still dominant at 80.1 percent, in tune with the
results of past surveys.
</P>
<P>
But a great majority, or 72.2 percent of those polled, disapprove
of China's "one country, two systems" model for unification with
Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
The ratio of those who think the Beijing authorities are
unfriendly toward the Taiwan government and people is still high,
at 58.6 percent and 39.9 percent, respectively.
</P>
<P>
On the priority of developing relations with other foreign
countries and China, the ratio is equal at 34.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
Even if developing relations with foreign countries causes
tension across the Taiwan Strait, 63.9 percent of those polled
still favor developing diplomatic ties with other countries.
</P>
<P>
On the government's restrictions on investment in China, 52.2
percent of the respondents said they should be more stringent,
while 30.3 percent said they should be relaxed.
</P>
<P>
On the pace of cross-strait exchanges, 30.2 percent said they are
too slow, compared with 22.5 percent who said they are too fast
and 34.5 percent who said they are acceptable.
