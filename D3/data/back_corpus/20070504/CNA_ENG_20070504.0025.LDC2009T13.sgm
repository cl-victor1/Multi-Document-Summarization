AD HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH DPP PRESIDENTIAL PRIMARY: EXECUTIVE
YUAN

Taipei, May 4 (CNA) 05/04/07  19:05:04 (By Lilian Wu)

An ad run by the Executive Yuan on the salvage of the
government's long-stalled budget bill is unrelated to the
upcoming presidential primary of the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP), a Cabinet spokeswoman said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Chen Mei-ling was referring to an ad urging the public to salvage
the government's 2007 budget bill that appeared in three major
local dailies earlier the same day.
</P>
<P>
She stressed that the ad has nothing to do with the DPP
presidential primary, which will kick off Sunday with member
voting and followed by public opinion polls before the
announcement of the party's candidate May 12 at the earliest.
Premier Su Tseng-chang is one of the front runners among the
party's four presidential aspirants, which also includes Vice
President Annette Lu, former Premier Frank Hsieh and DPP Chairman
Yu Snyi-kun.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the budget should have been passed by the Legislative
Yuan late last year, the ad said the Executive Yuan lamented that
the budget bill is still pending in the legislature. The ad took
the main opposition Kuomintang to task for holding the budget
hostage by demanding that the DPP agree to the lineup of a
Central Election Commission based on the proportion of seats of
each party in the legislature, which the Cabinet deems as
unconstitutional. The ad urged the public to express their
indignation at the KMT by whatever means.
</P>
<P>
One noteworthy aspect of the ad was the disclaimer that "the
expenses of the ad will be paid by free donations of the
appointed government officials."
</P>
<P>
Chen said that the total cost of the ad amounted to around
NT$800,000 (US$24,240) . As the Cabinet has only notified the
officials about the matter the previous day, she didn't know how
much the donations would amount to. She also said that the
officials in charge of national defense, foreign affairs, cross-
strait affairs as well as independent agencies were excluded from
donating money to the ad.
</P>
<P>
Chen said that the Executive Yuan has not used government budgets
nor the "special allowance fund" for the senior officials to pay
for the ad because it wants to highlight the seriousness of the
matter.
</P>
<P>
But the ad's appearance just two days prior to the primary gave
ammunition to the KMT, as well as some within the DPP.
</P>
<P>
The KMT caucus in the legislature said Friday that the ad has
shown that the premier "only has the election on his mind."
</P>
<P>
"The budget's failure to clear the legislature  shows how
incapable Su is, and he should take full responsibility, " the
KMT caucus said.
</P>
<P>
DPP Legislator Lin Kuo-ching, a supporter of another presidential
hopeful, Frank Hsieh, said that he "sympathized with the
appointed government officials," believing that they "were forced
to take sides with Premier Su as the fiercely competed primary
draws near."
</P>
<P>
Lin said that the Executive Yuan was trying to solicit support
from the administrative team and "forestall more officials
following the suit of Lee Ying-yuan," which refers to the recent
resignation of the Council of Labor Affairs chairman to throw his
support behind Hsieh.
</P>
<P>
Lin alleged the premier of availing himself of administrative
resources, which he said has resulted in a unfair competition
ahead of the primary.
</P>
<P>
But Ker Chien-ming, a DPP caucus whip in the legislature, said
that "one should not make unnecessary speculation, " saying that
the DPP caucus has previously suggested that the Executive Yuan
run such an ad.
