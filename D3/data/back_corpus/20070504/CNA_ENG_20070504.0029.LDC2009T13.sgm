Taiwan's first ever International Senior Lifestyle and Health
Care (SenCare) exhibition opened Friday at the World Trade
Center, showcasing a wide spectrum of medical treatment and
health care products, including mobility support devices, leisure
activity programs and financial solutions.

Distance health care services and relevant products, mostly
designed for independent seniors, were in the spotlight Friday at
SenCare.

A total of 118 foreign and local businesses have set up 262
booths at the venue in a drive to grab market share and
capitalize on trade opportunities as early as possible, said the
organizer of the semi-official Taiwan External Trade Development
Council (TAITRA).

Currently, there are more than 2 million people over the age of
65 in Taiwan. Against that backdrop, the estimated value of the
national senior health care industry is expected to surge to
NT$350 billion (US$10.5 billion) over the next seven years,
TAITRA officials said.

<P>
The council hopes the fair, set to run through May 7, will serve
as a platform at which foreign buyers will learn about popular
and innovative senior health care products made in Taiwan and
local people to gain insight into the many dimensions of the
emerging senior health care industry, the officials noted.
