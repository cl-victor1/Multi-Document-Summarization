CHINA'S BLOCKING WHO BID VIOLATES TAIWAN PEOPLE'S RIGHTS:
PRESIDENT
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  May 4 (CNA) 05/04/07  18:04:30 (By Y.F. Low)

<P>
President Chen Shui-bian said Friday the exclusion of Taiwan from
the World Health Organization (WHO) is a serious result of China
violating human rights through political means.
</P>
<P>
According to Chen, the country's move to apply for WHO membership
under the name of "Taiwan" this year is intended to highlight the
fact of China's suppression against the people of Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
"We want to let the people of Taiwan and the international
community see clearly that China is saying one thing but doing
the other," Chen said while addressing an event held at Taipei's
Songshan Armed Forces General Hospital to mark the 4th
anniversary of the SARS outbreak in Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Chen noted that as Taiwan is not a member of the WHO, it has not
been able to obtain any immediate assistance from the
international health network during outbreaks of cross-border
infectious diseases such as SARS.
</P>
<P>
Over the past decade, the government has employed various
strategies to fight for its right to participate as an observer
in the World Health Assembly -- the WHO's highest decision-making
body, but the effort remains unsuccessful owing to the political
interference from China, Chen pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Even Taiwan's request to become a full member of the WHO was
rejected by the WHO Secretariat on the grounds that Taiwan is not
a sovereign country, he said.
</P>
<P>
"This not only has denied the 23 million Taiwan people's rights
to health, but also highlighted the fact that the WHO's pursuit
of 'health for all' has been overridden by politics, " Chen said,
adding that Taiwan needs a seat in the WHO to ensure its people
enjoy international medical care in the event of an infectious
disease outbreak.
