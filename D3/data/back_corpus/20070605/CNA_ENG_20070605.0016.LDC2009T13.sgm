DPP LAWMAKERS MIXED ON HSIEH-SU TICKET

Taipei, June 5 (CNA) 06/05/07  14:43:38 (By Lilian Wu)

Reactions were mixed among ruling Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) lawmakers to reports Tuesday that President Chen Shui-bian
is coordinating between DPP presidential candidate Frank Hsieh
and former Premier Su Tseng-chang for them to form a ticket to
run in the 2008 presidential election.
</P>
<P>
Hsieh won the DPP presidential primary May 6 by beating three
other hopefuls, including Su, who finished second.
</P>
<P>
Hsieh has yet to announce his running mate, although there has
been much speculation that he will choose Yeh Chu-lan, a former
vice premier and former acting Kaohsiung mayor, given their
longstanding cooperation as well as the fact that Yeh is a woman
and Hakka.
</P>
<P>
The Hakka people represent the second largest ethnic group in
Taiwan, behind only the Hoklo people.
</P>
<P>
The China Times, a local newspaper, reported Tuesday that the
president has suggested that Hsieh pair up with Su in the belief
that their cooperation will help mend fences after the bitterly
contested presidential primary and that Su will complement Hsieh
in terms of expanding support base to boost Hsieh's chances of
winning the presidential election next year.
</P>
<P>
DPP Legislator Kao Chien-chih, who is a protege of Hsieh, said
that Yeh would be the best partner for Hsieh.
</P>
<P>
DPP Legislator Kuan Bi-ling said in Hakka that Hsieh has no need
"to pronounce" his running mate right now, adding that too much
talk will be harmful in terms of future cooperation.
</P>
<P>
DPP Legislator Wang Shih-chien, yet another of Hsieh's proteges,
said that if most of the Hakka people support Yeh, then Yeh will
be the best choice, although he added that the most important
factor will be the strategy employed for the presidential
campaign, and not who will run with Hsieh.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, DPP Legislator Wu Ping-Jui, who is a protege of Su,
said that although one should respect Hsieh's views in choosing a
running mate, Su would definitely be a boost to the DPP
presidential candidate's chances of winning the 2008 election.
