Taiwan Salt Industrial Corp. Chairman Lin Ching promised Tuesday
not to increase salt prices during his term in order to ease
consumers' worries.

Lin said Taiwan Salt has not raised prices for about 20 years,
even after its privatization in 2003.

Production costs of salt have increased due to soaring world raw
material prices, Lin said, adding that Taiwan Salt will not
increase its salt prices and will follow  the government's
policy of stabilizing domestic raw material prices.
