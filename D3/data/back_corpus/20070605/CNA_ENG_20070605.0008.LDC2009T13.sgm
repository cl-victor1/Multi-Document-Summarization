President Chen Shui-bian conferred medals on former Premier Su
Tseng-chang and other former officials in a ceremony held at the
Presidential Office Tuesday, with the notable absence of former
Vice Premier Tsai Ing-wen, who declined the honor.
</P>
<P>
Tsai's staff said she declined the honor because she "doesn't
have the habit of accepting medals."
</P>
<P>
President Chen bestowed medals on Su, former Executive Yuan
Secretary-General Liu Yu-shan as well as former Minister of
National Defense Lee Jye in recognition of their contributions to
the nation. Su, who stepped down shortly after losing the
Democratic Progressive Party's presidential primary May 6, led
his Cabinet to resign en masse last month.
</P>
<P>
Officials of the Presidential Office said the president affirmed
Tsai's contribution to the nation, but Tsai informed them that
she is not accustomed to receiving medals.
</P>
<P>
The officials noted that Tsai had also declined a medal offered
by then-Premier Yu Shyi-kun in 2004 when she ended four years'
service as the chairwoman of the Mainland Affairs Council, the
nation's top China policy-planning body.
</P>
<P>
Tsai expressed her appreciation to the president but declined to
accept the honor, the officials said, adding that the president
"understands and respects" her decision.
