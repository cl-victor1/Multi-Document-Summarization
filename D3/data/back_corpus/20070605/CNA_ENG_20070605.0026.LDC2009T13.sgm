presidential candidate, will depart for a visit to India and
Singapore next week.

According to Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) officials, the
ministry, including its outposts in the two countries, will
provide assistance to Ma, although technical details involving
the trip have been worked out by Ma's aides.

Ma is slated to depart for India June 11 and will visit Indian
officials and business leaders through June 13 before proceeding
to Singapore later that day. Ma will return to Taipei June 15
after meeting Singaporean political and business leaders.

Ma, a former KMT chairman who stepped down from the party's top
post in February, was nominated in early May by the KMT as its
presidential candidate, despite corruption charges against him.

monthly allowance earmarked for his discretionary use during his
two terms as mayor of Taipei from 1998-2006.
