The Taipei City government has worked out an integrated image
improvement- oriented program as part of efforts to showcase the
beauty of the capital of Taiwan, Mayor Hau Lung-bin announced
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Hau also said after he presided over an administrative meeting at
the city hall that carrying out the "Taipei Good Image" program
will be one of his administration's key tasks over the next six
months.
</P>
<P>
The program "is not a mirage, nor does it cost a lot," Hau said,
explaining that it will allow the city's residents to see a
changing Taipei while feeling the city's beauty and prosperity.
</P>
<P>
The program is comprised of six major projects, including the
inauguration of the Maokung cable car system -- the first of its
kind in the city -- in the tea- growing Mucha district, which is
slated for the end of June.
</P>
<P>
In the other major projects, efforts will be made to integrate
the cultural landscape in the area that surrounds the National
Palace Museum and to expand the facilities of the Water Park in
the Kungkuan district in a drive to create an "Off Off Broadway"
stage for performing art in the busy business district that
attracts young people.
</P>
<P>
Hau said that his administrative team will also work to improve
walking paths on hills in suburban districts, as well as the
lighting in MRT stations and vehicle tunnels around the city.
