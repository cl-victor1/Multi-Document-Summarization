The Taiwanese and Vietnamese information industries forged the
2007 APEC Digital Opportunity Center (ADOC) Information and
Communications Technology (ICT) Alliance Monday in Taipei with
the aim of taking part in international digital development
projects, industry sources said Tuesday.

Industry representatives from the Vietnam Electronic Industries
Association and the Taipei Computer Association (TCA) signed the
agreement with the ADOC Secretariat.

<P>
The signing ceremony was presided over by Hoang Le Minh, deputy
director  of Ho Chi  Minh  City's  Department  of Posts  and
Telecommunications; Wang Chien- ping, director of the
Multilateral Trade Affairs Division under Taiwan's Bureau of
Foreign Trade; TCA Secretary- General Enoch Du; and Eva Yueh,
deputy director of the Institute for Information Industry.

Wang said the ADOC program was originally proposed by former
Academica Sinica President Lee Yuan-tseh at the 11th APEC
Economic Leaders' Meeting in Bangkok in 2003 to bridge the
digital divide and upgrade e-capability throughout the Asia-
Pacific region.
</P>
<P>
He added that the 2007 ADOC Alliance was formed to integrate
Taiwanese  and Vietnamese  information  industry resources  and
professional experience to help ADOC members extend their
international markets.

Since the ADOC program was launched three years ago, Taiwan has
set up 19 ADOCs in Vietnam, Indonesia, the Philippines, Chile,
Peru and Papua New Guinea, while adding one ADOC and two tele-
centers in Thailand last month and planning to promote ADOC
programs and train 1,300 people in the near future.
