MINIMUM WAGE INCREASE TO BE FINALIZED THIS WEEK
</HEADLINE>

Taipei, June 5 (CNA) 06/05/07  19:18:06 (By Lilian Wu)
</P>
<P>
The amount of the minimum wage increase will be finalized this
week and put into practice July 1, Executive Yuan Secretary-
General Chen Chin-jun said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Chen said the Executive Yuan is now listening views from all
quarters, taking into consideration a proposal by the Council of
Labor Affairs (CLA) , the views of the Council for Economic
Planning and Development, and suggestions by business and
industrial groups.
</P>
<P>
According to the CLA's proposal, the minimum wage should be
raised from the present NT$15,840 (US$476) by 9.09 percent to
NT$17,280 per month, while the hourly wage should be raised from
the current NT$66 to NT$95, although trade groups that visited
the Executive Yuan that day complained that the level of increase
is "much too high."
</P>
<P>
The CLA believes that the level of hourly wage increase should
not be separate from that of the monthly increase, and should be
increased at one time, not in a piecemeal way.
</P>
<P>
But to lessen the burden of the employers and for the sake of a
comprehensive plan, the CLA has also proposed several sets of
complementary measures.
</P>
<P>
Premier Chang Chun-hsiung recently said that the minimum wage is
aimed at protecting the livelihoods of laborers and maintaining
their purchasing power, noting that the minimum wage has remained
unchanged since 1997.
</P>
<P>
He further  said  the minimum  wage hike will  take into
consideration the basic needs of laborers, the impact on Taiwan's
industrial competitiveness and consumer price fluctuations.
</P>
<P>
However, major business and industrial groups called for a
minimum wage increase of no more than 5 percent, with a minimum
hourly wage of no more than NT$82.
