A Singaporean couple were arrested Monday at Taiwan Taoyuan
International Airport for attempting to smuggle heroin from
Thailand into the country, customs officials said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
According to the officials, the smuggled heroin, weighing about
3.7 kg, was found hidden inside a tapestry in the couple's
luggage when they arrived on a flight from Bangkok.
</P>
<P>
The couple told police that they contacted drug dealers in
Bangkok and were to deliver the smuggled heroin to someone in
Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
The old-fashioned smuggling technique of hiding contraband in
tapestries has made a comeback because now is the peak season for
drug demand due to the summer vacation, the officials said,
adding that the customs and aviation police will reinforce drug
detection work.
