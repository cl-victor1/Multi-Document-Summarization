The Taipei city government will hold a series of activities June
17-19 to celebrate this year's Dragon Boat Festival in Taipei's
Dajia Riverside Park.
</P>
<P>
Nine dragon boat teams from the United States, South Africa and
the Philippines will join 116 teams from all over Taiwan in an
international dragon boat race, with the final competition
scheduled for June 19.
</P>
<P>
Visitors to the carnival-like festival will be able to savor a
variety of delicacies and buy artifacts at 150 stalls in the
park.

<P>
They can also enjoy jazz music played by a band of the Taipei
American School and watch performances by street artists and new
immigrants in Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Parents and their children can participate in a "parent-child
iron man triathlon" -- a fun game designed for entire families.
</P>
<P>
At exactly 12 noon of the Dragon Boat Festival, which falls on
the fifth day of the fifth lunar month, or June 19, visitors will
be invited to join a competition to stand raw eggs on end.
</P>
<P>
The Dragon Boat Festival originated from activities commemorating
the death of a highly esteemed poet, Chu Yuan, who served as a
minister in the state of Chu during China's Warring States Period
(475-221 B.C.) . He committed suicide by drowning himself in a
river to protest his dismissal by a corrupt prince. Fishermen
nearby raced their boats in an attempt to save him but were
unable to recover his body.
