President Chen Shui-bian named former Premier Su Tseng-chang
Tuesday as his envoy to attend the funeral of Malawian first lady
Ethel Mutharika.

Mutharika, wife of Malawian President Bingu wa Mutharika, passed
away Monday after battling an unspecified illness, Wang Chien-
yeh, spokesman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA), quoted
a brief statement from the Malawian presidential office as
saying.

Su will head a delegation to the southeast African country June 7
to attend the funeral on behalf of the Republic of China
government. The funeral is scheduled to be held June 9. The
delegation will make a transit stop in Johannesburg, South Africa
en route to Malawi, Wang said, adding that the delegation is
scheduled to return home June 13.

This will be Su's second visit to Malawi -- one of Taiwan's five
diplomatic allies in Africa. His first visit was in July 2002
when he accompanied President Chen on a diplomatic tour to
Senegal, Sao Tome and Principe, Swaziland and Malawi, according
to the MOFA. Senegal switched diplomatic ties from Taipei to
Beijing in 2005.
