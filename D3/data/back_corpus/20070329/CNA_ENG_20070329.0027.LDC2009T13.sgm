IMPROVEMENT IN SOCIAL ORDER, GUN CRIMES HALVED: POLICE CHIEF
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  March 29 (CNA) 03/29/07  19:16:05 (By Elizabeth Hsu)

The head of the National Police Agency (NPA) said Thursday that
there has been a "significant improvement" in social order over
the past year, while the number of crimes involving firearms has
been halved and robberies reduced by 40 percent.
</P>
<P>
No criminals like Chang Hsi-ming, who shocked society with his
possession of powerful firearms before being nabbed last year for
masterminding many kidnappings for ransom, are still at large in
Taiwan, NPA Director-General Hou Yu-ih claimed at a press
conference at the NPA.
</P>
<P>
Hou also said that in the past year, the number of violent crimes
dropped 15 percent and that of telephone fraud decreased 17
percent, while motor vehicle thefts dropped 20 percent after the
NPA began from this year to carry out a measure requiring motor
vehicles to be branded with their engine codes as part of efforts
to crack down on motorcycle and car theft.
</P>
<P>
The contributions  of law enforcement  departments  to the
maintenance of social order should not be diminished by the
airing of controversial television footage showing a local
gangster flaunting firearms and threatening to kill another
gangster, according to Hou.
</P>
<P>
He also expressed bewilderment as to why the arrest of a
kidnapper who abducted a schoolboy in Tainan, southern Taiwan did
not attract the media's attention in the same way the scofflaw
gangster did.
</P>
<P>
Hou urged local media outlets to make reports that "convey the
right messages" after the video footage, said to have been made
with the collaboration of two TVBS reporters and the gangster,
triggered public concern over social order.
