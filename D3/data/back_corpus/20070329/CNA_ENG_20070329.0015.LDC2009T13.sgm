<P>
Taipei,  March  29  (CNA) 03/29/07  16:28:57 (By Lilian Wu)

<P>
The Presidential Office on Thursday dismissed as "groundless"
reports that it had applied pressure on prosecutors during their
probe into alleged misuse of a special allowance set aside for
the president's discretionary use.
</P>
<P>
The Presidential Office was responding to reports by the United
Daily News, a mass-circulation daily, which quoted "reliable
sources" as saying that after first lady Wu Shu-jen and other
officials were indicted last November in connection with the
"state affairs fund, " top officials from President Chen's
administration attempted to pressure the prosecutors into
dropping the case.
</P>
<P>
According to the daily, Taiwan High Court Prosecutor-General
Hsieh Wen-ting, who reportedly refused to budge under pressure,
was recently notified that he would have to step down from his
post.
</P>
<P>
The Presidential Office said in a press release that the reports
are "speculative" and "were not verified." It also condemned the
reports as not being conducive to maintaining the prosecution's
independence or upholding social justice.
</P>
<P>
In the press release, the Presidential Office pointed out that
during the investigations into the "state affairs case, " it had
repeatedly said that it would respect the judicial system and
cooperate with the investigators.
</P>
<P>
"The Presidential Office has never applied pressure on the
prosecutors or intervened in the investigation, " the press
release said.
</P>
<P>
Wu was charged with embezzlement and forgery involving the misuse
of a special "state affairs fund." The prosecution said she used
invoices collected from family members and others to claim
NT$14.8 million in reimbursements from the fund between July 2002
and March 2006.
</P>
<P>
Three other former and incumbent officials of the Presidential
Office were also indicted on charges of embezzlement, forgery and
perjury.
