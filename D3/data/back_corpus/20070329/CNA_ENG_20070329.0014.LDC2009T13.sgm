TSU CALLS FOR BOYCOTT OF CHINESE TOWELS

Taipei,  March 29 (CNA) 03/29/07  16:09:17 (By Deborah Kuo)

The opposition Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU) called on the public
Thursday to boycott substandard towels from China in order to
protect their health and the interests of domestic towel makers.
</P>
<P>
TSU Chairman Huang Kun-hui claimed at a news conference held at
the Legislative Yuan that many China-originating towels imported
to Taiwan via third countries are poisonous as they contain the
carcinogenic substance benzidine.
</P>
<P>
Huang demanded that the Bureau of Standards, Measurement and
Inspection under the Ministry of Economic Affairs step up
inspection and control over "shoddy and counterfeit" toweling
imports from China.
</P>
<P>
Huang also demanded that the Directorate General of Customs crack
down on the dumping of Chinese towels in Taiwan at low prices and
on the illegal transshipment of the products into Taiwan without
submitting "place of origin" documents.
</P>
<P>
TSU Legislator Lai Hsin-yuan, who has been working to protect the
interests of Taiwan towel makers, said at the news conference
that although the Ministry of Finance (MOF) has levied a 204.1
percent provisional anti-dumping tax on most Chinese towel
imports to Taiwan since last September, the interests of domestic
manufacturers has been tremendously infringed upon.
</P>
<P>
Lai claimed that like the towel-making industry, some 30 other
domestic industries are also struggling for survival under the
threat of dumping of similar products from China.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan began to levy the provisional 204.1 percent anti-dumping
tax on all Chinese towel exports to Taiwan, with the exception of
two Chinese companies that have been subject to lower anti-
dumping taxes of 109.3 percent and 107.7 percent, respectively.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan towel makers, mostly from the central county of Yunlin,
took to the streets in March 2006 to denounce the deluge of cheap
Chinese products entering Taiwan, prompting the Ministry of
Economic Affairs to hold public hearings and investigate the
matter.
