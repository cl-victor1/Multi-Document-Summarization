Taipei,  March 29 (CNA) 03/29/07  23:49:35 (By Maubo Chang)

<P>
Premier Su Tseng-chang lauded police for nabbing a gangster only
three days after he threatened to kill a rival mob boss in a
video broadcast by several local TV stations Monday.
</P>
<P>
Su said the arrest of Chou Cheng-pao has proven the caliber of
the police and their capacity to maintain peace and order.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the premier condemned, without naming names,
local TV stations for prompting panic in society by shooting and
airing Chou's video then pretending that it was sent to them by
post.
</P>
<P>
Chou, who toted firearms in the video, was arrested by police in
a shelter at a defunct sand and grit dredging site by a river in
Wujih, Taichung county Thursday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Chou did not put up any resistance when police stormed the
shelter, and contrary to his boasts in the much publicized video,
denied his involvement in three recent high-profile shootings in
Taichung.
</P>
<P>
He was immediately taken by police to a secret location for
questioning.
</P>
<P>
His video, purportedly sent to local TV stations by post, was
discovered to have been shot by two reporters of a local TV
station before being aired repeatedly by the TVBS station, which
represented it as a scoop in its Monday news cycle.
