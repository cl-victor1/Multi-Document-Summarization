TAIWAN SLIPS TO 13TH IN GLOBAL NETWORKED READINESS INDEX
</HEADLINE>

Taipei, March 29 (CNA) 03/29/07  13:11:30 (By Sofia Wu)
</P>
<P>
Taiwan has slipped to 13th in the world in terms of the ability
to exploit information and communications technology, according
to a new survey by the Geneva-based World Economic Forum (WEF).
</P>
<P>
The forum issued Wednesday its 2006-2007 Global Information
Technology Report which assessed the impact of information and
communications technology (ICT) on the development process and
the competitiveness of 122 nations around the world in terms of
the Networked Readiness Index (NRI).
</P>
<P>
The NRI measures the range of factors that affect a country's
ability  to harness  information  technologies  for  economic
competitiveness  and development.  It also establishes a broad
international framework mapping out the enabling factors of such
capacity.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan ranked seventh in the WEF's 2005-2006 Networked Readiness
Index, which also marked the first time that Taiwan ranked among
the top 10 in the forum's annual report.
</P>
<P>
Government officials attributed the drop to a combination of
factors, including Taiwan's poor regulatory environment and
European countries' rapid progress in ICT development.
</P>
<P>
In coordination with the European Union's "i2010" program,
European countries have invested heavily in ICT infrastructure
construction in recent years, which has borne fruit, with Nordic
countries dominating the top of the rankings in the WEF's
2006-2007 report.
</P>
<P>
Denmark topped the list, followed by Sweden. Singapore, which
ranked first in the 2005-2006 survey, was the top Asian nation at
third  overall.  Rounding  out the top 10 list were Finland,
Switzerland, the Netherlands, the United States, Iceland, Britain
and Norway, in that order.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan ranked third among Asian countries, lagging behind only
Singapore and Hong Kong, which ranked 12th in the world, but
slightly ahead of Japan, ranked 14th, and South Korea, ranked
19th.
</P>
<P>
Officials from the Executive Yuan's National Information and
Communication Initiative (NICI) Task Force said Taiwan's
government budget  for ICT development  has repeatedly  been cut
by the opposition-controlled legislature in recent years.
</P>
<P>
In 2006, Taiwan's ICT spending only accounted for 0.45 percent of
its gross domestic product (GDP) , far lower than Britain's 1.19
percent, America's 1.08 percent, Singapore's 0.83 percent,
Japan's 0.8 percent and South Korea's 0.58 percent.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan's regulatory environment ranked 31st in the world in the
2006-2007 NRI survey. Among the criteria used in rating a
country's regulatory environment were judicial independence, for
which Taiwan ranked 53rd; legislative efficiency, for which it
ranked 49th; efficiency of legal framework, 41st; protection of
property rights, 39th; and intellectual property rights
protection, 26th.
</P>
<P>
"All these figures indicate that there is still ample room for us
to improve our regulatory environment, " an NICI task force
official said.
</P>
<P>
In contrast, Taiwan made progress in the government's leadership
in ICT development efforts, with its ranking advancing from ninth
to sixth, and its infrastructure construction environment also
moved forward one notch to 12th.
</P>
<P>
The official said he believes that Taiwan's NRI ranking will
continue to improve as the government has decided to invest
NT$55.6 billion to implement an NICI package over the next five
years to build Taiwan into an "ubiquitous network society."
