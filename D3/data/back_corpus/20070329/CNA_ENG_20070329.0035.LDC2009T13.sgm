A business magnate urged the government Thursday  to be more pro-
active  in efforts  to seek Taiwan's representation or
participation in regional or global organizations.
</P>
<P>
According to Chang An-ping, vice chairman of Chia Hsin Cement
Corp., Taiwan has business and industrial opportunities that are
world-class and of global vision -- conditions that are good
enough to make the island a global economic powerhouse.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan is an economic powerhouse as it has most of the conditions
that make a country an economic superpower, conditions he
described as including an open society, a leadership with vision,
a diverse society, globalized business and industrial sectors, an
intellectual arena with members willing to take risks, an
independent academic sector and innovative people, Chang claimed.
</P>
<P>
However, he went on, Taiwan is excluded from many major regional
economic blocs and organizations,  such as the Association of
Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and the ASEAN Plus Three.
</P>
<P>
He attributed this mainly to the fact that Taiwan did not extend
a helping hand to its Southeast Asian neighbors when the region
was embroiled in a financial storm in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Chang urged the government not to remain shortsighted but to
instead embrace Taiwan's neighbors unconditionally and try to
make friends with those countries before thinking about
harvesting any benefits from them.
</P>
<P>
Chang made the remarks during a speech delivered at a seminar on
economic cooperation in the Asia-Pacific region and the prospects
for Taiwan's business sector that was sponsored by the Chinese
Taipei Pacific Economic Cooperation Council.
