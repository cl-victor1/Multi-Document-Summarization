CAMBODIAN WIVES NEED NOT PRODUCE NATURALIZATION DOCUMENTS: MOI
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  March  3 (CNA) 03/29/07  21:43:43 (By Deborah Kuo)

Cambodian brides of Taiwanese need no longer produce documents
proving renunciation of their original nationality to apply for
naturalization, the Ministry of the Interior (MOI) said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
MOI officials said those Cambodian wives who have already applied
for ROC citizenship but could not present a certificate of
renunciation of original nationality to facilitate the
application may now be awarded ROC citizenship based on a proviso
carried in the ninth article of country's law of nationality.
</P>
<P>
Under the ROC law of nationality, the officials said, foreigners
must give up their original nationality before they can apply for
naturalization. However, some countries, including Cambodia,
Thailand and Japan, do not allow their citizens to renounce their
nationality.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, 22 Japanese wives so far have been naturalized
after their citizenship applications were handled as special
cases, in which they had to prove that the responsibility for
failing to obtain a certificate of renunciation of original
nationality did not rest with them, with the reason for the
failure verified by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
</P>
<P>
However, none of the Cambodian wives in Taiwan have had the
chance to apply for naturalization based on the Japanese model
because the Foreign Ministry has refused to grant them similar
verification after declaring that all Cambodian certificates will
be regarded as fake because so many documents from Cambodia are
forged.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 20 Cambodian brides of Taiwanese wept recently at a news
conference held at the Legislative Yuan while denouncing the
Foreign Ministry for depriving them of the "right" to apply for
Taiwan citizenship.
</P>
<P>
The women protested against unfair treatment compared with that
of Japanese women who are married to Taiwanese men.
</P>
<P>
Currently there are over 2,000 Cambodian wives legitimately
living in Taiwan. Seventy-nine of this group, however, have
failed to obtain ROC citizenships because their documents of
renunciation of original nationality were judged by Foreign
Ministry authorities to have been forged.
