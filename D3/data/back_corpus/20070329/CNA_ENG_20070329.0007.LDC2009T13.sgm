PRESIDENTIAL OFFICE DENIES AUTHORIZING SPEAKER'S PLANNED CHINA
VISIT
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  March 29 (CNA) 03/29/07  12:01:31 (By Sofia Wu)

The Presidential Office has discounted as a "groundless rumor" a
local newspaper report that Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-
pyng may receive an official mandate to visit China to negotiate
certain critical issues.
</P>
<P>
The Presidential Office made the denial in a press release late
Wednesday after the China Times daily reported earlier in the day
that Wang, a stalwart of the main opposition Kuomintang, may be
authorized by the Democratic Progressive Party administration to
visit China sometime in April to discuss new opening measures,
including the opening of bilateral banking exchanges and cargo
charter services.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, Wang would meet with Chinese President
Hu Jintao during his China visit.
</P>
<P>
Responding to the media report, major pro-independence groups,
including the Taiwan South Society, demanded that the
Presidential Office and the Executive Yuan give a public
explanation about the decision to authorize Wang's China visit
for talks on such important cross-Taiwan Strait issues.
</P>
<P>
The Presidential Office said in its late-night press statement
that the report was groundless and lacked any solid facts.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, an official from the Mainland Affairs Council, a
Cabinet-level body which charts Taiwan's policy toward China,
said that an institutionalized mechanism for cross-strait
negotiations on issues involving public authorities has been in
place for years.
</P>
<P>
As a matter of fact, the official continued, negotiations for the
opening of Taiwan to Chinese tourists and the opening of direct
cross-strait cargo charter flight services have been proceeding
smoothly.
</P>
<P>
"None of our ongoing negotiations are moving toward the direction
reported by the newspaper," the official said.
</P>
<P>
As to the opening of banking exchanges, the official said, Taiwan
banks would be allowed to open branches in China only after the
two sides crafted a mutually acceptable financial supervisory
mechanism.
</P>
<P>
"We have informed China of our readiness to talk about that
issue; however, no consultations in that regard have ever taken
place due mainly to China's insistence that such talks must be
held under its cherished 'one China' principle -- a prerequisite
unacceptable to Taiwan," the official said, adding that "given
China's recalcitrance, we see that no progress in this regard
would be forthcoming no matter which Taiwanese political leader
tried to help."
