Taipei,    March   29   (CNA) 03/29/07  19:57:13 (By Lilian Wu)

National  Immigration  Agency Director-General Wu Chen-chi and
three other agency officials were disciplined Thursday for lax
supervision after 200 blank multi-entry visa permits kept by a
clerk were found to be missing.
</P>
<P>
Wu was given two major demerits by an assessment committee
convened  by the Ministry  of the Interior  (MOI) .  Deputy
Director-General Tsai Chen-jung received a major demerit, Section
Chief Chiu Hsin-ying was handed a minor demerit, and the agency's
Taipei County Office Director Chang Tseng-liang was given one
major demerit and transferred to a non-executive post.
</P>
<P>
MOI officials said they meted out the punishments because the
loss of multiple entry permits has "seriously undermined public
trust in the government."
</P>
<P>
Wu, reporting to the assessment committee Thursday, said Cheng
Fang-lin, a clerk at the agency's Taipei County office, reported
March 21 that 200 multiple entry permits under her safekeeping
were missing. The permits have not been found.
</P>
<P>
Wu added that each clerk will now only be allowed 50 permits at a
time.
