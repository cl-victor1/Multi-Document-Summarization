International express firms FedEx and UPS will continue to invest
in Taiwan, executives of the two firms said Thursday.

FedEx Taiwan General Manager Chu Hsing-Jung said Taiwan's
industries are still growing, although many of them have to
transform or move out of the country to survive. FedEx is still
optimistic about the Taiwan market and will continue investing in
the country, he added.

FedEx has renewed or expanded its service stations in Hsinchu,
Taoyuan, Wuku and Taichung since 2005 to increase its logistical
efficiency and strengthen its services for central Taiwan, Chu
said.

Wu Hsin-han, general manager of UPS, said UPS will provide more
resources to Taiwan's small- and medium-sized enterprises to help
them enter international markets.

Wu said the firm's 2006 sales in the global, Asia Pacific and
Taiwan markets reached double-digit growth.
