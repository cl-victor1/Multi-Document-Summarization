The wanted criminal who recently appeared in controversial
television broadcasts threatening to murder a rival has been
nabbed in central Taiwan, a National Police Agency inspector said
Thursday.

Inspector Chih Ming-mou said Chou Cheng-pao was arrested earlier
in the day at his hideout -- an abandoned shelter for quarry
workers on a river bank. He was found in possession of four toy
guns and a bulletproof vest.
</P>
<P>
Chou had aroused public concern over social order by producing a
video statement claiming responsibility for three recent
shootings that injured his former gang boss. The statement was
broadcast on the TVBS television channel Monday, with the video
footage showing him sitting behind a table on which two M-16
rifles and two handguns were displayed.
