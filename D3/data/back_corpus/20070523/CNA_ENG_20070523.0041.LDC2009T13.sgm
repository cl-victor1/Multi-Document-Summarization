Passengers traveling between Taiwan's Kinmen and Matsu islands
and the Fujian Province ports of Xiamen and Mawei in China made a
total of some 670,000 trips in 2006, up by 20.5 percent over the
2005 figure, the Ministry of Transportation and Communications
(MOTC) reported Tuesday.

Taiwan travelers made over 590,000 trips to China last year on
the Kinmen-Xiamen and Matsu-Mawei shipping routes -- popularly
known as the "mini three links" -- while Chinese visitors only
made some 80,000 ferry voyages, according to MOTC statistics.

<P>
The prime reasons behind cross-Taiwan Strait visits are mainly
related to tourism, family reunions, and religious and academic
activities, MOTC officials said.

<P>
However, the volume of cargo shipped between the two sides
declined by 45 percent year on year to just over 900,000 metric
tons last year, the same statistics show.

<P>
Some 900,000 metric tons of products, 85 percent of which was
gravel, were transported from China to Kinmen in 2006, MOTC
officials said, pointing to the huge gap existing between the two
sides. Kinmen speciality products, including liquor, fishery
goods and groceries were the main items shipped to Fujian.

<P>
The "mini three links" were initiated in January 2001, with
Quanzhou, also in Fujian, joining the program in June last year.
