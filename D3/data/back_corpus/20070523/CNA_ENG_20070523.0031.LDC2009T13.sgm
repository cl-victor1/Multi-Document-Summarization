Prosecutors requested a life sentence Wednesday for Lee Tai-an,
one of two brothers suspected of conspiring to murder a
Vietnamese woman by deliberately causing a train derailment in
order to collect on her life insurance.
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors in the southernmost county of Pingtung made the
announcement at a press conference at the end of their
investigations into the murder case and said they are seeking the
life sentence for Lee on charges of murdering his sister-in-law
and of sabotaging a public transport system.
</P>
<P>
Lee's family members said they will appeal against the ruling.
</P>
<P>
The Pingtung prosecutors sought a death sentence for Lee last
July,  based on the reasoning that he continues to deny all
accusations despite the convincing evidence against him and that
he has shown no remorse for his actions.
</P>
<P>
All the evidence indicates that Lee Tai-an and his younger
brother, Lee Shuang- chuan, who was a railway worker, caused
several train derailments in March 2006 on the South Link Line
connecting the counties of Taitung and Pingtung, with the aim of
killing Lee Shuang-chuan's Vietnamese wife, surnamed Vguyen, in
order to collect on her life insurance policy, the prosecutors
said in their 2006 ruling.
</P>
<P>
Lee Shuang-chuan was found dead hanging from a tree near his
Taitung home March 23, 2006.
</P>
<P>
The investigators had listed Lee Shuang-chuan previously as a
suspect in the deliberate sabotage of the South Link Line that
led to a train derailment, in which his wife died as a result of
internal bleeding.
</P>
<P>
The 24-year-old  Vietnamese  woman was among three people,
including the train driver, badly injured in the accident.
</P>
<P>
There were more than 200 passengers aboard when the express train
heading from Taitung, eastern Taiwan to the southern port city of
Kaohsiung derailed. Three of the passenger cars tipped over in
the accident, while the locomotive was completely destroyed.
</P>
<P>
After ensuing investigations and autopsies, investigators came to
the conclusion in May 2006 that Lee Shung-chuan had injected an
unknown poison into his wife's body immediately after the train
derailed.
</P>
<P>
The investigators also found that Lee Shuang-chuan, who lost
NT$33 million (US$1 million) on stock trading with two securities
firms between January 2000 and June 2004, had taken out a NT$20
million insurance policy covering the accidental death of Vguyen
-- his third wife -- just days prior to the derailment, and that
his second wife, also Vietnamese, died four years ago of a snake
bite in circumstances described as suspicious.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Pingtung prosecutors also sought a six-month
prison sentence for an alleged accomplice, Huang Fu-lai, on
charges of conspiring  with the Lee brothers  to cause several
train derailments.
