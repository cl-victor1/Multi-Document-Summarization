NICARAGUA SAID ALIENATING TAIWAN
</HEADLINE>

<P>
San Jose,  Costa Rica,  May 22 (CNA) 05/23/07  17:48:46 (By Ramon
Huang and Deborah Kuo)
</P>
<P>
A Nicaraguan daily reported Tuesday that there are signs that the
Ortega administration has increasingly alienated Taiwan since he
was sworn in this past January.
</P>
<P>
One of the signs is that Nicaraguan Foreign Minister Samuel
Santos will not attend a ministerial-level meeting between
Taiwan's foreign minister and his counterparts from Central
American countries that maintain diplomatic relations with the
Republic of China on Taiwan slated for May 25 in Belize, the El
Nuevo Diario reported.
</P>
<P>
The daily said that Santos has appointed his deputy, Valdrack
Jaentschke, to attend the meeting, which is a regular annual
event held alternately in Taiwan and one of its allies in the
region, on his behalf.
</P>
<P>
If the daily's report is verified as true, Santos will be the
third foreign minister to be absent from the May 25 meeting. The
other two are the foreign ministers of Panama and Costa Rica.
</P>
<P>
So far, the ROC embassy in Nicaragua has kept mum on the daily's
report.
</P>
<P>
President Chen Shui-bian traveled to Nicaragua Jan. 9-11 to
attend the inauguration of Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega.
Minister of Foreign Affairs James Huang headed to Belize Monday
to prepare  for the May 25 meeting  with his Central  American
counterparts.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, former Nicaraguan Foreign Minister Norman Caldera told
the CNA that Taiwan-Nicaragua ties are rife with twists and
turns, as attested to by the fact that Nicaragua was absent from
the May 14 vote at the WHO headquarters in Geneva on Taiwan's bid
for membership in the organization.
</P>
<P>
Caldera said Nicaragua broke its promise to Taiwan to support the
island's bid to become a member of the WHO, adding that
Nicaragua's absence from the WHO vote on the issue was
inconsistent with the country's foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
"A person or country will not be trusted by others if that person
or country fails to keep their promises to their friends or
allies, " Caldera said.
