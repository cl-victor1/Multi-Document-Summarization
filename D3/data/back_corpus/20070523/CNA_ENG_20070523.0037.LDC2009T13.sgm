Apartment rent rates in Taipei are the 27th highest in the world,
according to a recent survey conducted by ECA International, the
world's largest membership organization for international human
resource professionals.
</P>
<P>
The survey comparing rental prices for a three bedroom apartment
in 92 cities worldwide in 2006 shows that Hong Kong is the city
with the highest rent, with an apartment in a popular expatriate
area costing approximately US$8,592 per month on average.
</P>
<P>
Taipei ranked 27th, with an average rent of NT$94,000 (US$2,816)
per month, down four notches from 2005.
</P>
<P>
Lee Quane, general manager of ECA International Hong Kong, told
the Central News Agency that Taipei's rental rates are stable
among Asian cities, in light of the fact that they rose only a
moderate 2 percent in 2006, compared with Hong Kong's 10 percent
and Singapore's 15 percent.
</P>
<P>
However, if examined on a longer time frame, Taipei's rental
rates have increased 16 percent over the past five years, a hike
that is larger than those of Hong Kong, Tokyo and Singapore
during the same period, Quane said.
</P>
<P>
He predicted that in the next few years, property prices and
rental rates will continue to rise in Asia, which is home to the
world's fastest-growing economy.
</P>
<P>
While rental rates in Shanghai are expected to increase 4 percent
to 5 percent, those in Taipei are likely to jump 3 percent to 4
percent, Quane said.
