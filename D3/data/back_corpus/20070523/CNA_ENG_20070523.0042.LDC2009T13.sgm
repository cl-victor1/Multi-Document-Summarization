FORMOSAT-3 PROVIDING INFO KEY TO UNDERSTANDING OZONE DEPLETION:
NSPO

Taipei,  May 23 (CNA) 05/23/07  20:25:49 (By Zep Hu)

Taiwan's weather satellite FORMOSAT-3 has proven effective in
offering constant observation data on the stratospheric
temperature  gradient over Antarctica, providing information that
is key to understanding ozone depletion, the National Space
Organization (NSPO) , which operates the satellite, announced
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Over 200 entries of data per day have been provided  by
FORMOSAT-3, 10 times the amount provided by ground-based weather
balloons which can only be deployed two times per day at most,
according to the NSPO.
</P>
<P>
Previous research showed that the temperature variations in the
Antarctic stratosphere are closely related to the scope of ozone
depletion, with lower temperatures correlating with greater
degrees of depletion.
</P>
<P>
NSPO researchers pointed out that ground-based Antarctic weather
observations are highly susceptible to environmental conditions,
such as extremely low temperatures and fierce gales or ice
storms; while the stratospheric temperature monitoring to date
has been carried out using weather balloons which are also unable
to provide constant data due to weather limitations.
</P>
<P>
However,  they  continued,  FORMOSAT-3  --  also known  as
Constellation Observing System for Meteorology,  Ionosphere and
Climate -- can use its remote sensing and observation capability
to offer constant monitoring of the stratosphere above
Antarctica.
</P>
<P>
FORMASAT-3 -- an observing constellation of six micro-satellites
orbiting the planet at an altitude of 800 kilometers above ground
-- observes the global weather conditions through GPS signals.
The theory behind the process is that weather conditions
constantly interfere with GPS signals; therefore, by counter-
calculations on the interference, the researchers can reconstruct
the weather conditions on the route.
