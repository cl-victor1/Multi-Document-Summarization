CABINET OFFICIAL WARNS AGAINST NO-CONFIDENCE VOTE
</HEADLINE>

Taipei, May 23 (CNA) 05/23/07  19:34:20 (By Flor Wang)

In response to a local media report that the opposition "pan-blue
alliance" might raise a no-confidence vote next month  against
Premier  Chang  Chun- hsiung,  Executive  Yuan Secretary-General
Chen Chin-jun urged political parties Wednesday to "forswear
partisan gain" or risk being cast aside by the people.
</P>
<P>
Chen made the remarks after the China Times reported that same
day that opposition People First Party (PFP) legislative caucus
whip Fu Kun-chi said a day earlier that he had recently reached
agreement with main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Wu Poh-
hsiung and KMT Secretary-General Wu Den-yih on jointly toppling
the Cabinet June 9, the day when the KMT wraps up its legislative
primary.
</P>
<P>
Calling on the various parties to prioritize the people's needs
and never let their own interests take precedence, Chen said that
Chang, who assumed the premiership Monday, has readied himself to
take on the challenges of the coming year.
</P>
<P>
Asked by reporters about the issue, Wu dismissed the report,
saying that the KMT has yet to even consider whether or not it
should join forces with the PFP to launch the no-confidence vote,
let alone fix a date to do so.
</P>
<P>
According to Wu, a consensus must be forged within the party
before a decision can be made on the matter. He added that the
KMT wants to assess if Chang is sincere in promoting detente in
the Legislative Yuan over several blocked key bills, including
the draft Central Election Commission  Organic Law and the 2007
central government budget bill.
</P>
<P>
KMT lawmaker Tseng Yung-chuan, who also serves as director of the
party's Policy Coordination Committee, said that it is true that
the KMT and the PFP are "keenly" weighing the situation to gauge
the timing for toppling the Cabinet if Chang fails to respond in
good faith. "But the reported date of June 9 is groundless, " he
pointed out.
</P>
<P>
According to Tseng, the KMT legislative caucus needs a two-thirds
majority approval of its members to make a decision on a major
issue like toppling the Cabinet. A no-confidence vote could be
called at any time during the current legislative session before
it adjourns June 15, he added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng warned that
both the "pan- blue" and the "pan-green" camps might end up
suffering if the Cabinet is toppled. But he added that he will
have to follow due process in the Legislative Yuan if a no-
confidence vote is launched.
</P>
<P>
Wang called on the two sides to cautiously weigh their next move
and seek to negotiate and mend their differences instead of
having confrontation, to mitigate the possibility of political
uncertainty.
