PRESIDENT VOWS TO KEEP PUSHING FORWARD WITH FINANCIAL REFORMS
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  May 23 (CNA) 05/23/07  15:56:17 (By Y.F. Low)
</P>
<P>
President Chen Shui-bian pledged Wednesday to continue to push
forward with the second phase of financial reforms to enhance the
competitiveness  of domestic financial institutions.
</P>
<P>
According to Chen, the reforms are on the right track, although
there is much room for improvement in the government's efforts to
promote the reforms.
</P>
<P>
"The second phase of financial reforms has not failed. It simply
has not succeeded yet, " Chen said while addressing the 2007
International Conference on Economics, Finance and Accounting
held by National Taiwan University.
</P>
<P>
Chen recalled that between 1991 and 1992, the Ministry of Finance
approved the establishment of 16 privately-owned banks without
working out proper complementary measures, which led to a sharp
increase in the number of domestic banking branches from 1,382 in
1993 to 2,693 in 2000.
</P>
<P>
The excessive  competition  among domestic  banks seriously
undermined their credit quality and increased their overdue loan
ratios, which averaged a record 11.4 percent by April 2002, Chen
noted.
</P>
<P>
In view of the situation, the government designated 2001 as the
first year of financial reforms and enacted during that year six
laws essential to carrying out the reforms, Chen said.
</P>
<P>
In 2002, the government set the objectives of reducing the
overdue loan ratios of domestic banks to below 5 percent and
boosting their capital adequacy ratios to over 8 percent within
two years, Chen said.
</P>
<P>
With the goals achieved ahead of schedule, the average overdue
loan ratio of domestic banks has now dropped to 2.32 percent, and
their average adequacy ratio has also increased to 10.11 percent,
he said.
</P>
<P>
In October 2004, the president continued, the government launched
the second phase of financial reforms, setting new targets
including halving the number of publicly-owned banks to six,
helping at least three financial institutions to grab a market
share of at least 10 percent, halving the number of financial
holding companies, and helping at least one financial institution
to list their shares on overseas stock markets or be operated by
a foreign owner.
</P>
<P>
"Although  the second phase of financial reforms has been
unsatisfactory in terms of the methods in which the reforms are
being carried out, along with many other aspects requiring
improvement, the objectives that we set are definitely correct,"
Chen said.
</P>
<P>
Chen said that after the Rebar Group's embezzlement scandal came
to light early this year, the government released the lists of
major overdue debtors of various domestic banks, adding that it
will publicize the lists once a year in the future.
</P>
<P>
According to Chen, while the first phase of financial reforms was
aimed at improving the asset structures and operations of
domestic financial institutions, the purpose of the second phase
of reforms is to  build  up  the financial  institutions'
international competitiveness.
</P>
<P>
"The success of the first phase of financial reforms only laid
the foundation, and we must not be complacent about it or confine
ourselves to it," he said.
</P>
<P>
Today, financial institutions in the country still face a lot of
problems, such as vicious competition among banks and non-
economic intervention in the privatization of publicly-owned
banks, which are pending resolution by the joint efforts of the
government, businesses and various political parties, Chen said.
</P>
<P>
He urged opposition parties "not to make a political tool of
financial issues and delay the progress of financial reforms."
