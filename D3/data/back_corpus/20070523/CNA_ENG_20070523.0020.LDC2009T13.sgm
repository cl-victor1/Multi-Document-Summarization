Taipei,  May 23 (CNA) 05/23/07  15:44:42 (By Deborah Kuo)

Taipei County Councilor Wu Shan-chiu of the opposition People
First Party (PFP) died shortly after being shot five times by a
lone gunman at his service office just before noon Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
After administering emergency treatment to try to revive Wu, who
had displayed no signs of life after being rushed to Tzu Chi
Hospital's Hsintien branch, doctors at the hospital pronounced Wu
dead at 1:03 p.m. Wu was 48.
</P>
<P>
Wang Yu-kang, deputy director of the Taipei County Police
Department, said that the gunman arrived at Wu's service office
in Hsintien at around 11: 20 a.m. wearing a motorcycle helmet and
sunglasses and asked for Wu. He then shot the councilor five
times, including three times in the chest, with a handgun.
</P>
<P>
Wang said it is clear that the gunman was a hired assassin.
However, he would not speculate on whether the assassination was
related to Wu's recent bringing to light of a collusion case over
illegal gravel and sand trading, saying only that police will
track down the killer by using information on cases, including
filed complaints, that Wu's office has been handling.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the PFP issued a statement around noon, expressing its
grief over the death of Wu, whom the party called a "crime-
exposing hero, " and condemning the violence that it said has
been "ripping the fabric of Taiwan society."
</P>
<P>
The PFP also urged the police to track down the assassin and
bring him to justice as quickly as possible.
</P>
<P>
A few hours later, Premier Chang Chun-hsiung expressed his
sympathy over the death of Wu and told the media that he has
instructed Minister of the Interior Lee Yi-yang to see to it that
the case is solved as soon as possible.
