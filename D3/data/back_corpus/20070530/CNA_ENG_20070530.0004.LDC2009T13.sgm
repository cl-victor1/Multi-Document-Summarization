The Taipei County government is offering a NT$2 million
(US$60,605) reward to anyone who can identify the assassin who
shot dead a county councilor in his constituency office in
Hsintien City a week ago.
</P>
<P>
Taipei County Magistrate Chou Hsi-wei announced Tuesday that the
reward is being offered in the hope that police can bring the
murderer to justice as soon as possible for killing Councilor Wu
Shan-chiu. He encouraged the public to view a photo image of the
gunman released by the police.
</P>
<P>
A police spokesman for the Taipei County Police Bureau told news
media that the image recorded on CCTV is so clear that anyone who
knows the assassin should be able to identify him.

<P>
According to information provided by the police, the gunman is
about 175 cm tall and has a lean build. On May 23, the day of the
assassination, he circled Wu's office on a Sanyang R1 motorcycle.
He was wearing a light-colored shirt and a pair of dark-colored
trousers, along with a crash helmet and a pair of sunglasses.
</P>
<P>
A video footage shows the man producing a handgun as soon as he
dismounts his motorcycle. Three of Wu's aides have testified that
the man asked one of them whether the councilor was in the office
before walking in and shooting him five times.
