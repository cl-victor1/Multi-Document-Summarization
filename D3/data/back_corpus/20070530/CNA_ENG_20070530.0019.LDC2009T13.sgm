PRESIDENT URGES CHINA TO HONOR OLYMPIC SPIRIT BY REMOVING
MISSILES
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Washington, May 29 (CNA) 05/30/07  17:13:21 (By Chieh-yu Lin and
Sofia Wu)
</P>
<P>
President Chen Shui-bian said Tuesday he looks forward to seeing
China honor the Olympic spirit of fostering world peace by
removing all the nearly 1,000 missiles it has deployed against
Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Chen made the call while holding a video conference with members
of the National Press Club (NPC) in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
In response to questions from a Japanese journalist about
Taiwan's stance and policy toward the 2008 Beijing Olympic Games,
Chen said that Taiwan will not boycott the event and that it
would like to see the sporting extravaganza be a great success.
</P>
<P>
"However, we do not want to see China use the Beijing Olympics to
belittle Taiwan," Chen said, taking issue with the Beijing
organizing committee's arbitrary change of Taiwan's Olympic title
from "Chinese Taipei" to "China Taipei," which connotes that
China has jurisdiction over Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
As to the Olympic torch relay, Chen said Taiwan would be happy to
be a part of the relay so long as Taiwan's national sovereignty
and dignity would not be undermined.
</P>
<P>
The Beijing Olympics organizers announced last month that the
Olympic torch would pass through Taiwan after sweeping through
the cities of Pyongyang in North Korea and Ho Chi Minh in Vietnam
and before moving on to China-controlled Hong Kong and Macau.
</P>
<P>
But Taiwan rejected the offer and demanded that the torch arrive
and leave the island via a third country, excluding the Chinese
territories of Hong Kong or Macau, to highlight Taiwan's
sovereign status.
</P>
<P>
"We do not want to see the route of this torch relay being
interpreted as a domestic route within the territory of China, "
Chen said in the video conference.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the Olympic Games are supposed to foster a spirit of
peace, Chen said if Beijing wants to honor this spirit, it should
dismantle all of its missiles aimed at Taiwan and annul its so-
called Anti Secession Law which codifies its use of force against
Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
The 70-minute  teleconference,  titled  "Democratic  Taiwan:
Challenges and Prospects, " began at 8: 30 p.m. Taipei time and
was moderated by NPC Vice Chairman Peter Hickman.
</P>
<P>
Chen opened with a 10-minute speech and then spent the next 20
minutes replying to questions  from incumbent and former U.S.
politicians,  including Congressman Lincoln Davis (D.-Tenn.) ,
U.S.-Taiwan Business Council Chairman Rupert Hammond- Chambers;
former American Institute in Taiwan (AIT) Chairman Richard Bush;
former AIT Chairwoman Therese Shaheen; and Randy Schriver, a
former deputy assistant secretary of state.
</P>
<P>
Responding to Chen's speech, Shaheen said she agrees with Chen
that appeasement would breed aggression, adding that China's
actions in certain areas seem increasingly inconsistent with its
declared policies.
</P>
<P>
The  last  35  minutes  of  the  teleconference  was  a question-
and-answer session.
</P>
<P>
Asked about what he intends to accomplish during his last year in
office, Chen said he will dedicate his remaining time in office
to strengthening Taiwan- centric consciousness and contributing
to the country's drive to join the United Nations and the World
Health Organization under the name of Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Chen said Taiwan's bid to join international organizations
complies with the provisions of the Taiwan Relations Act (TRA) --
the U.S. law that regulates U.S. relations and engagements with
Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
According to Chen, the TRA recognizes Taiwan as a country and
makes it completely legitimate for Taiwan to join international
organizations.
</P>
<P>
He further  said using  the name "Taiwan"  to join world
organizations does not violate the "four noes" pledge he made in
his 2000 inaugural speech and does not equate to changing the
name of the country.
</P>
<P>
The "four noes" pledge refers to the commitment he made as part
of his first inaugural speech in which he promised that so long
as China has no intention to use force against Taiwan, he would
not declare Taiwan independence, not change the nation's official
title, not enshrine the "state-to-state" framework of cross-
strait relations in the Constitution,  and not  hold  a
referendum  on formal independence.
</P>
<P>
Chen said the "four noes" pledge has not only played a pivotal
role in maintaining  stable Taiwan-U.S.  relations  during his
presidency but has also helped avoid the outbreak of conflict in
the Taiwan Strait.
</P>
<P>
Although cross-strait relations have been strained from time to
time over the past seven years, there has been no war in the
strait, Chen said, adding that he has worked hard during his
presidency to ensure peace and stability in the strait.
</P>
<P>
Chen said he believes that his successor will understand the
importance  of the "four noes" pledge  in maintaining  stable
Taiwan-U.S. and Taiwan-China relations over the past years.
</P>
<P>
As to his plans after he steps down from the presidency, Chen
said he will heed the advice former U.S. President Bill Clinton
gave him during the latter's visit to Taipei in February 2005,
namely to "avoid criticizing your successor and refrain from
giving him or her instructions."
