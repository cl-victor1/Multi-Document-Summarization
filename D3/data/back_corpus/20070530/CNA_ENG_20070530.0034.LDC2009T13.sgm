A Taiwan medical team is providing a variety of voluntary
services to the people of El Salvador, former Department of
Health Minister Lee Ming-liang said in the Central American
country Wednesday.

<P>
Lee, who is leading the 13-member team now, said the team is
providing  free dental,  ophthalmic,  pediatric,  surgical  and
acupuncture services during its 10-day stay.
</P>
<P>
Noting that Taiwan has sent medical teams to Africa and Latin
America in the past, Lee said this is the first time a team has
offered such services in El Salvador.

The team went to Honduras before arriving at El Salvador and is
likely to move on to Nicaragua and other Central American
nations, Lee added.
