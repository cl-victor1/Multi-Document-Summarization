</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taipei, May 30 (CNA) 05/30/07  15:23:04 (By Deborah Kuo)
</P>
<P>
The Fisheries Agency under the Cabinet-level Council of
Agriculture will be relocated to the southern port city of
Kaohsiung before Oct. 31,  Premier Chang Chun-hsiung announced
Wednesday
</P>
<P>
Noting that the Fisheries Agency will be the first administrative
organization under the central government to be relocated from
Taiwan's capital in the north to the south, Chang expressed the
hope that the agency's relocation will be carried out smoothly
and serve as a paradigm for other governmental organizations to
emulate in this regard.
</P>
<P>
Speaking during an Executive Yuan meeting, Chang said that after
the Fisheries Agency's relocation -- a move in line with the
government's  policy of bolstering the development of Taiwan's
fisheries sector -- about two-thirds of the agency's 200-plus
employees will be working at the Kaohsiung headquarters.
</P>
<P>
The Fisheries Agency, to be headquartered in the Ocean Going
Fisheries Development Center located in the Chienchen Fishing
Port complex in Kaohsiung City, will be responsible for carrying
out the government's fishery policy and providing consultation
and assistance for fishery operators in central and southern
Taiwan, Chang said.
</P>
<P>
The remaining one-third of Fisheries Agency employees will remain
in Taipei to continue the agency's work, including coordinating
with the Legislative Yuan and providing consultation and
assistance to fishery operators in the northern city of Keelung
and the northern counties of Yilan and Taoyuan, Chang said.
</P>
<P>
The Taipei operations will be renamed as the Taipei Office of the
Fisheries Agency, he added.
</P>
<P>
Chang said the fisheries industry is one of the most important
business sectors in Taiwan, with production totaling NT$85.9
billion (US$2.6 billion) in 2006.
</P>
<P>
Of that total, about 72 percent, or NT$62 billion, was generated
by fishery operators based in the southern counties of Chiayi,
Tainan, Kaohsiung and Pingtung, he added.
</P>
<P>
It is expected that the Fisheries Agency's relocation  to
Kaohsiung will facilitate the implementation of the
administration's set policy of helping boost economic growth in
central and southern Taiwan and balancing regional development,
Chang reiterated.
