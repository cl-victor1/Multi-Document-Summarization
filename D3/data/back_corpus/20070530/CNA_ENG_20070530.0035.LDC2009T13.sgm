Kaohsiung County Magistrate Yang Chiu-hsin received a five-star
rating for his performance for the second time, according to the
results of a magazine poll released Wednesday.

Global Views magazine conducted the poll in April to gauge the
satisfaction of local residents in 22 cities and counties with
the performance of their mayors and magistrates.

Yang was the only local government head to receive a five-star
ranking for the second time in a row, the poll results show.

The poll excluded Keelung City because the city held a mayoral
by-election just recently.

Yang, Hsinchu Mayor Lin Junq-tzer and Hsinchu County Magistrate
Cheng Yung-chin all received five-star ratings in the category of
mayors and magistrates who are serving second terms.
