A "Taiwan Food Month" program will begin June 1 as part of
efforts to attract international businessmen to Taiwan, officials

According to surveys, 62.21 percent of the foreign tourists who
arrive in Taiwan come mainly to enjoy local cuisine, the
officials said.

Therefore, the TAITRA decided to collaborate with 61 restaurants
and hotels to organize the program, the officials noted.

The decision also came amid expectations that around 40,000
foreign businessmen will attend several international exhibitions
in Taipei in that month, the officials went on.

TAITRA hopes the food in Taiwan will help leave a good impression
on foreign visitors and further create word-of-mouth marketing to
attract even more tourists, the officials said.
