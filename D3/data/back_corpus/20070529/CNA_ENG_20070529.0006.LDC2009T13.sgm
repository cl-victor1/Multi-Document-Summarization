NEW ZEALAND WELCOME TO ATTEND ROC-PACIFIC ALLIES SUMMIT:

Taipei,  May  29 (CNA) 05/29/07  10:56:44 (By Sofia Wu)

<P>
President Chen Shui-bian has said New Zealand is welcome to send
a delegation to observe a leadership meeting between the Republic
of China and its South Pacific allies to be held in the Marshall
Islands in October.
</P>
<P>
Chen extended his invitation Monday while meeting with a visiting
delegation composed of indigenous Maori members of the New
Zealand House of Representatives.
</P>
<P>
Recalling that the first Taiwan-Pacific Allies Summit, held in
Palau last September,  was very fruitful in cementing  mutual
friendship and cooperation, Chen said he has high expectations of
the coming second such rendezvous with his counterparts from
Taiwan's Pacific allies, including Palau, the Marshall Islands,
Kiribati, Nauru, Tuvalu and the Solomon Islands.
</P>
<P>
As New Zealand has traditionally maintained close ties with major
Pacific island countries, Chen said he looks forward to seeing
the attendance as observers of a New Zealand delegation at the
coming Taiwan-Pacific Allies Summit.
</P>
<P>
Touching on Taiwan-New Zealand relations, Chen said bilateral
trade and commercial cooperation have been growing ever closer
over the past decade. Two- way trade amounted to 1 billion New
Zealand dollars (US$725.7 million) in 2006, with imports and
exports each accounting half of the total.
</P>
<P>
Chen said he takes pleasure in seeing bilateral trade develop in
such a balanced manner. Since 1994, the two countries have held a
sub-Cabinet-level trade and economic consultative meeting to map
out various trade and investment promotional programs.
</P>
<P>
When this year's conference is held in Taipei in August, Chen
said he hopes officials from both sides will break new grounds
for cooperation in various fields.
</P>
<P>
The New Zealand delegation is headed by Tariana Turia, co-leader
of the Maori Party and a member of the Health Committee of the
New Zealand parliament.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Chen expressed his heartfelt gratitude for
Turia for her generous support for Taiwan's bid to join the World
Health Organization (WHO) . Turia has not only written to the New
Zealand health minister but has also issued press statements
urging the New Zealand government to throw its weight behind
Taiwan's WHO bid.
</P>
<P>
For the past 11 years, Taiwan has tried but failed to gain
representation in the Geneva-based world health regulatory body
simply because of China's obstruction. Chen told his guests that
Taiwan will not be daunted by any setbacks or challenges and will
continue its quest for presence  in the WHO and other major
international organizations.
