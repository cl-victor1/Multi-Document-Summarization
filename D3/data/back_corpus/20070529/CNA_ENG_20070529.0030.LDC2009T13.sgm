Taipei,  May 29 (CNA) 05/29/07  19:32:50 (By Elizabeth Hsu)

<P>
President Chen Shui-bian will hold a video conference with the
U.S. National Press Club (NPC) in Washington, D.C.  Tuesday
evening,  in  which  he  will accentuate  his administration's
referendum and constitutional re-engineering plans do not have
anything to do with his "four noes" pledge, according to a
spokesman for the Presidential Office.
</P>
<P>
Lee Nan-yang, director of the office's Department of Public
Affairs,  said Chen plans to underline the importance of his
administration's efforts to promote constitutional re-
engineering, as well as to organize a referendum on Taiwan's bid
for membership of the United Nations and the World Health
Organization under the name of Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Chen will also say that the efforts have nothing to do with his
"four noes" pledge made in his 2000 inaugural address that as
long as Beijing has no intention of using military force against
Taiwan, he will not declare independence, not change Taiwan's
name, not add the state-to-state theory to the Constitution,  and
not promote a referendum on the independence versus unification
issue during his term in office.
</P>
<P>
Chen will speak in the first half of the video conference with
U.S. politicians and scholars, including House Representative
Lincoln Davis (D-Tenn), Rupert Hammond-Chambers, president of the
U.S.-Taiwan Business Council, two former directors of the
American Institute in Taiwan, Richard Bush and Therese Shaheen,
as well as Randy Schriver, former U.S. deputy assistant secretary
of state for East Asian and Pacific affairs.
</P>
<P>
In the second part of the event, Chen will take questions from
journalists stationed in Washington, Lee said, noting major
topics in the event will focus on cross-Taiwan Strait relations,
U.S.-Taiwan political, economic and trading ties, and democratic
development in Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
NPC Vice Chairman Peter Hickman will moderate the event, titled
"Democratic Taiwan: Challenges and Prospects, " in which Chen is
scheduled to first deliver a 10-minute address before he begins
dialogues with the American participants.
