Over 85 percent of employees around the country who are aged
above 30 and who have been working for years have expressed that
they are worried they will suffer an "old bird" crisis on the job
in the near future, according to survey results released Tuesday
by the online 104 Job Bank.
</P>
<P>
The veteran employees -- called "old birds" in the vocational
field -- are worried that their professional expertise and skills
can't keep up with the times, that they will face difficulties in
seeking promotions, or that they will have trouble competing with
younger workers as their bodies weaken and their capacity for
learning deteriorates over time, according to Fang Kuang-wei, the
104 Job Bank's publicity manager.

<P>
Fang made the revelation when citing the results of an online
survey  that  his company  and  Wealth  Magazine,  a monthly
Chinese-language journal covering trends in the global economy
and investment, conducted April 23-27 on their members aged over
30.
</P>
<P>
The survey results show that more than 50 percent of the
respondents said that if they have an "old bird" crisis, they
will consider changing professions when they are middle aged.
</P>
<P>
The major factors that will lead "old birds" to seek new careers
include no future standing in their current jobs, with 50.5
percent of respondents mentioning this; no prospects in their
current professional field, mentioned by 47.5 percent; and
difficulty finding a new job in their current professional field,
mentioned by 26.7 percent of the respondents, Fang pointed out.
</P>
<P>
According to the survey results, 32.9 percent of the respondents
expressed that they are too tired to remain in their current
jobs, with 34 percent of these respondents planning to start
their own businesses, 28.5 percent hoping to work as ranking
managers, and 20.6 percent saying they will remain employees.
</P>
<P>
A total of 1,747 valid questionnaires were collected in the
survey, which has a margin of error of plus or minus 2.34
percentage points.
