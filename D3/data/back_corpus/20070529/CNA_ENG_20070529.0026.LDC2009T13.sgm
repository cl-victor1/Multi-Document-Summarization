TAIWAN PLANT BREEDERS ELIGIBLE TO APPLY FOR EU PATENTS: COA
</HEADLINE>

Taipei, May 29 (CNA) 05/29/07  17:17:19 (By Sofia Wu)

New plant breeders from Taiwan now enjoy the same patent
protection in the European Union as their counterparts from the
27 EU member states do, a Council of Agriculture (COA) official
said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
According to the official, the European Union formally informed
the COA in March of its assent to process applications by
Taiwanese individuals and corporations for protection of
intellectual property rights for new plant varieties.
</P>
<P>
The EU approval came after a full year of intensive negotiations,
the official said, adding that local plant breeders can file
their patent applications with the EU's Community Plant Variety
Office (CPVO).
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, the official said, the EU further informed
Taiwan that if disputes arise because of patent claims by two or
more parties over the same plant variety, Taiwanese breeders can
enjoy a priority right in the EU for that variety so long as they
have already obtained patent protection in a non-EU country.
</P>
<P>
"This latest notice confirms that our plant breeders now enjoy
same full patent protection in the whole EU territory for their
new cultivars as their counterparts from EU member countries do,
" the official explained, adding that the EU has also offered
same protection for plant breeders from member states of the
International Union for the Protection of New Varieties of Plants
(UPOV).
</P>
<P>
The UPOV is a U.N.-affiliated intergovernmental organization with
its headquarters in Geneva, Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
As Taiwan is not a U.N. member, it has been barred from joining
the UPOV, and its plant breeders have consequently been denied
patent protection for their new cultivars.
</P>
<P>
"The breakthrough in negotiations with the EU marks a significant
step forward in the government's efforts to help our plant
variety developers secure better protection for their
intellectual property rights and to facilitate their exploration
of overseas markets, " the official said.
</P>
<P>
He further said that it's not easy for the European Union to
agree to offer full patent protection for new plant varieties
developed by Taiwan breeders because most countries usually do
not take the initiative in protecting the rights and interests of
foreign new plant breeders until after the parties concerned have
taken their cases to the courts for debate.
</P>
<P>
From now on, the official said, Taiwanese breeders will be able
to collect royalties for their patented new cultivars from their
EU partners and will also be able to file patent violation
lawsuits if their competitors in China or other countries
illegally use their breeding know-how to cultivate and export the
plant species to EU countries.
</P>
<P>
Through separate bilateral negotiations, the official said, the
United States, Australia and Japan have also expressly agreed to
process patent applications by Taiwanese breeders of new plant
varieties.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the official said, the COA has assisted local orchid
breeders and growers in forming a corporate body to facilitate
their overseas patent applications for their new orchid
varieties.
</P>
<P>
The Taiwan Orchid Growers Foundation, headquartered in the
Netherlands, has filed an application with the EU Community Plant
Variety Office (CPVO) for patent protection for 10 locally
developed phalaenopsis species and hybrids, the official said,
adding that the EU office is now processing the applications.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan's new drive to protect its plant breeding expertise has
drawn increasing attention from flower growers and horticulture
industry operators in Europe, the United States and Japan, the
official said.
</P>
<P>
Among others, CPVO Chairman Bart Kiewiet said in a recent
interview with the noted horticulture  magazine "Flora Culture
International" that he expects Taiwan to apply for patent
protection for a number of plant species in the near future.
