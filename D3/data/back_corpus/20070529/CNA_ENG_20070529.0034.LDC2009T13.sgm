Taipei, May 29 (CNA) 05/29/07  21:00:21 (By Lilian Wu)

<P>
The ruling Democratic Progressive Party's
</P>
<P>
(DPP's) presidential candidate vowed Tuesday to end incessant
partisan bickering that has dominated Taiwan's political scenes
over the past seven years.
</P>
<P>
Frank Hsieh, a former premier, made the remarks in a news
conference after the DPP's Central Executive Committee formally
nominated him as the party's candidate for the next presidency.
</P>
<P>
Accompanying him for the news conference were DPP Chairman Yu
Shyi-kun, Premier Chang Chun-hsiung and Ker Chien-ming, the top
whip of the DPP's legislative caucus.
</P>
<P>
Hsieh defeated the three other presidential hopefuls -- Vice
President Annette Lu, Former Premier Su Tseng-chang and Yu -- in
the party's presidential primary May 6.
</P>
<P>
Hsieh said the 2008 presidential election is not just about the
DPP winning the election to continue the "native" government in
contrast with the previous Kuomintang administration as the KMT
originated in China.
</P>
<P>
"The race is also not just about defeating or annihilating
another party or candidate, " Hsieh went on.
</P>
<P>
"The most important reason for the DPP to win the coming
presidential election is to end incessant party bickering so that
the country can end the internal attrition and start to move
forward," he added.
</P>
<P>
"Taiwan can't afford and has no more time for inter-party
squabbling, " he said, adding that "democracy, the value of
integrity as well as mutual respect, which have taken so long to
take root in Taiwan, have gradually drifted away because of the
ceaseless fighting between ruling and opposition political
parties."
</P>
<P>
He predicted that Taiwan will face its most critical time between
2008 and 2009, as the new president of the United States will be
elected then and the new U.S. administration may not be able to
intervene in East Asian politics and that Taiwan will have to
face international pressure bravely on its own.
</P>
<P>
"This is way internal solidarity is most important, " Hsieh went
on,  adding that  this is why he advocated  "symbiosis  and
reconciliation" when he assumed the premiership in early 2005. He
stepped down a year later.
</P>
<P>
Hsieh was scheduled  to sponsor a concert to express his
appreciation at the Taipei City Council at night, which none of
his primary rivals would attend.
