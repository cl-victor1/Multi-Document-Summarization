Premier Chang Chun-hsiung ordered government employees Tuesday
not to wear suits and ties to their offices during the summer in
order to prevent unnecessary waste of energy on air-conditioning
set at too-low temperatures.
</P>
<P>
Appearing at a news conference in a white shirt without a tie,
Chang said staff of government agencies and public schools should
wear casual clothing unless they are receiving foreign guests.
</P>
<P>
Chang said air-conditioners in offices should be set at 26-28
degrees Celsius, adding that in procuring electrical equipment,
government  agencies  and schools  should  give  priority  to
high-performance products certified for their energy-conserving
functions.
</P>
<P>
According to Chang, the government should set a good example
first before promoting a national energy conservation campaign
and should educate the younger generation on the importance of
the issue.
