More than 6 million tablets of Reductil, an anti-obesity
medicine, were sold in Taiwan last year, making it the 18th best-
selling drug on the local pharmaceutical market, according to
statistics released by IMS Health Inc. Monday.
</P>
<P>
The figure means that an average of over 20,000 local people have
used Reductil to lose weight and stay fit over the past year,
market sources said.
</P>
<P>
Reductil's sales ranking remained the same as the preceding year,
the sources said, adding that the stable sales could be
attributed to a crackdown launched by the Department of Health on
substandard or counterfeit weight-loss drugs, which prompted many
consumers to turn to Reductil, a legally licensed brand.
</P>
<P>
In contrast, the sales ranking of Viagra fell steeply from ninth
place in 2005 to 19th last year. It also marked the first time
that Viagra has trailed behind Reductil in Taiwan's top-20 best-
selling medications list.
</P>
<P>
A total of 710,000 pills of Viagra were sold in 2006, worth
slightly more than NT$500 million (US$15.12 million).
</P>
<P>
Urologists attributed Viagra's lackluster sales records in part
to a domestic economic slowdown which they said have discouraged
less serious impotence patients from using the drug, which costs
NT$400 (US$12.09) apiece and is not eligible for national health
insurance coverage.
</P>
<P>
The drop in Viagra sales could also be attributed to competition
from other anti-impotence medications, such as Cialis and
Levitra, pharmacists said.
