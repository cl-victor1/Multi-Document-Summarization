TAIWANESE SHOULD SHOW MORE COMPASSION FOR TIBET: CIVIC GROUP
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  May 29 (CNA) 05/29/07  21:57:48 (By Chris Wang)

<P>
Taiwanese people should understand Tibet more and show more
compassion to the region that like Taiwan has also been oppressed
by China for decades, a civic group said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The people of Taiwan can do more than just participate in a
prayer day and a march from 228 Memorial Park to Ximending June
3, said a Taiwan Tibet Exchange Association (TTEF) researcher who
preferred to remain anonymous.
</P>
<P>
TTEF is the main organizer of "The Prayer Day for World Peace and
Human Rights in Tibet, " a serial multinational event that was
launched in Bangkok, Thailand May 27 and includes stops in
Cambodia, Taiwan, Japan, India and Mongolia.
</P>
<P>
"One thing we can learn from Tibet is that, as much oppression as
Taiwan had experienced from China, there have been many minority
people in China suffering from the same oppression, " the
researcher said.
</P>
<P>
"We should feel fortunate for our economic prosperity and
political development in Taiwan. We can elect our own national
leader. These are things that the Tibetans don't have, " she
said.
</P>
<P>
"And the Tibetans haven't given up on fighting for freedom and
independence. Some overseas Tibetan refugees could have been
living luxurious lives in the West, given their financial status
and educational background, but they are still devoting all their
energy and life to the movement, " she claimed.
</P>
<P>
"That kind of effort and persistence should be recognized by the
people of Taiwan and deserves our attention and support, " she
added.
</P>
<P>
Taiwanese should also show the sympathy and empathy to Tibet from
the perspective of human rights, because the Chinese government
has not restrained its cultural, economic, political and
religious control and oppression  of Tibet 40 years after the
Cultural Revolution, she said.
</P>
<P>
Other civic groups and volunteers in Taiwan have started taking
action to help Tibet, such as the Taiwan International
Cooperation and Development Fund, she said.
