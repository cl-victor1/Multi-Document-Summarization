FOUNDATION OPPOSES LAX RESTRICTIONS ON ORGANIC CROPS

Taipei, May 29 (CNA) 05/29/07  21:08:20 (By Flor Wang)

In response to a government plan to ease the requirement that
locally produced organic crops be pesticide-free, the Consumers'
Foundation (CF) said Tuesday that it strongly opposes the move
out of concern over food safety.
</P>
<P>
CF Chairman Cheng Jen-hung made the comments after Agriculture
and Food Agency Director-General Huang Yu-tsai visited him to
tout the change. The agency is a unit under the Cabinet-level
Council of Agriculture (COA).
</P>
<P>
According to Huang, his agency is planning to follow the U.S.
model by permitting local crops that contain no more than 5
percent in chemical residue of the standard safety levels set by
the public health authorities to carry "organic" stickers.  This
would mark an easing of the existing zero-residue tolerance.
</P>
<P>
Arguing that the so-called "authentic" organic crops must not
contain any pesticide, Cheng said they have received many phone
calls from consumers complaining about the planned change, on the
grounds that they would prefer to purchase safe certified organic
vegetables and fruit even if they are more expensive.
</P>
<P>
Cheng said that the CF is not opposed to the government setting
up a brand new system to allow certain amounts of chemical
pesticide on crops, but that it will never agree to the idea of
permitting so-called ecological farm produce to have any amount
of pesticide residue. This would also be very unfair to farmers
dedicated to pesticide-free organic farming, he insisted.
</P>
<P>
Public confidence in the government's organic certification will
also be shaken and their rights affected if the restriction is
eased, Cheng said.
</P>
<P>
In the face of the backlash from the private sector, COA Vice
Chairman Lee Chien-chuan said later that same day that a final
decision will be made in one month after the opinions of all
parties concerned, including producers, consumers and food
experts, have been fully explored.
</P>
<P>
The 5 percent adjustment on allowable chemical residue is based
on the basic safety amount set by the government for each variety
of farm produce, Lee explained.
</P>
<P>
Pointing to rice as an example, Lee said, organic rice would not
be allowed to have more than 0.005 PPM (0.1 PPM x 5% ) in
chemical residue. 0.11 PPM is the standard safety level in
chemical fertilizer set by the Department of Health for rice, he
added.
</P>
<P>
Saying that the motive behind the planned adjustment is to help
ease local farmers' concern over monetary punishments meted out
to them for selling produce tainted as a result of environmental
pollution, Lee claimed that the COA hopes to encourage greater
efforts toward eco-friendly production with the change.
</P>
<P>
Under the terms of the regulations  governing agricultural
production and certification promulgated Jan. 29 by the COA, it
is unlawful to use chemical fertilizers to produce organic crops.
Offenders can be fined from NT$30,000 to NT$150,000.
</P>
<P>
Citing COA statistics, a local newspaper reported that day that
Taiwan produced some NT$600 million worth of organic produce in
2006, only about the half of foreign imports amounting to nearly
NT$1.3 billion.
</P>
<P>
Although the COA aims to help local farmers devoted to ecological
production with the easing on allowable chemical residue on their
produce, specialists said that complementary measures must be put
in place at the same time to avoid negative consequences, in
particular on the part of farmers, according to the report.
