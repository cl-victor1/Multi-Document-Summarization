China's substantial military budget hike reveals its attempt at
achieving global dominance or hegemony, Mainland Affairs Council
Chairman Joseph Wu said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The country's top China policy planner made the remarks after
Beijing made public its draft budget bill for 2007 which shows a
17.8 percent increase in its military budget.
</P>
<P>
China's annual military spending has invariably registered a
double-digit growth since 1993, Wu said, adding that the
significant budget increase, coupled with a lack of transparency
in its military buildup, a rapid expansion of its air and naval
forces, and its progress in space defense technology, has led him
into believing in China's attempt at global dominance.
</P>
<P>
In the foreseeable future, Wu said, the growth in China's
military expenditure is not expected to slow down, but will
instead accelerate. "The upward spiral in China's military budget
has become a long-term trend," he added.
</P>
<P>
With no apparent present threat and no potential future threat to
its security in sight, Wu said China's continued military budget
growth deserves global attention and concern.
</P>
<P>
Quoting Western military experts, Wu said China's actual military
budget is roughly three times its officially declared figure.
</P>
<P>
Noting that China's increased military budget underscores its
rising threat to Taiwan and other neighboring Asia-Pacific
countries, Wu said Taiwan's plan to procure three big-ticket
weaponry systems -- eight diesel-electric submarines, six Patriot
PAC III anti-missile batteries and a squadron of 12 P-3C anti-
submarine aircraft -- is aimed at beefing up its defense
capability in the face of China's ambitious military buildup.
