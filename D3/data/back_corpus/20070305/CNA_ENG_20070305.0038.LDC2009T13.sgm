TAIWAN FACING FOUR MAJOR CRISES: LEGISLATIVE SPEAKER
</HEADLINE>

Taichung,  March 5 (CNA) 03/05/07  21:34:18 (By Han Nai-kuo)

Taiwan is facing four major crises and three crucial issues, and
the government must work out effective policies to better cope
with these problems, Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng said
in Taichung Monday.
</P>
<P>
Addressing participants at a annual meeting of the Republic of
China Industrial Park Manufacturers Federation (IPMF), Wang said
Taiwan is currently engulfed in four major crises: the hollowing-
out of national coffers, the marginalization of Taiwan in the
world economy, the social polarization between rich and poor and
the heightening of tensions in cross-Taiwan Strait relations.
</P>
<P>
Wang added that in addition to the four crises, Taiwan is also
dogged by three burning issues: the need to promote harmony
between Taiwan and China, between the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) and opposition parties, and between
ethnic and social groups.
</P>
<P>
He explained that harmonious relations with China are important
to Taiwan's economic development.
</P>
<P>
He urged the DPP government to come up with better policies to
provide opportunities for the survival and further development of
Taiwan's industries.
</P>
<P>
"Only by doing so can we turn Taiwan into an international
investment center and dissolve the crises Taiwan is facing," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Wang, a member of the opposition Kuomintang (KMT), acknowledged
last week that he was making preparations to run for president in
2008. He has not yet announced his candidacy, but is widely
believed to be a major rival to former KMT Chairman Ma Ying-jeou
in a party primary.
