The Cabinet-level Council for Hakka Affairs held a meeting
Monday, asking designers, manufacturers and sales outlets to
provide products reflecting Hakka culture to go with the 2007
paulownia flower season, better known as the tung blossom
festival.
</P>
<P>
April and May are the months when the paulownia flowers are in
full bloom in northern Taiwan's mountainous areas. The white
flowers have become a symbol of the Hakka people.
</P>
<P>
The blooming season is celebrated every year with Hakka music and
songs and other cultural traditions that reflect the Hakka
people's way of life, their gregariousness, hospitality and
hardworking spirit.
</P>
<P>
Chuang Chin-hua, head of the Council for Hakka Affairs, told
reporters that some 300 products related to Hakka culture are
expected to be put on Taiwan's market during the festival.
</P>
<P>
She said the products will be available at the Taiwan Handicraft
Promotion Center and Shin Kong Mitsukoshi Department Store's
Hsinyi Road Branch in Taipei.
</P>
<P>
Chuang said the public are welcome to visit Hakka villages in
various counties, including Taoyuan, Hsinchu, Miaoli and Taichung
during April and May to feast their eyes on the snow-white
blossoms, listen to Hakka music and enjoy Hakka delicacies.
</P>
<P>
The Hakkas are a unique ethnic group of Han Chinese, who
originally lived in central China but gradually migrated south
during different dynasties and settled in Jiangxi, Fujian and
Guangdong provinces to flee from war and famine. They were called
Hakka, which literally means "guest families," by the locals when
they first settled in.
</P>
<P>
The Hakka are conservative in keeping their cultural traditions.
One of their outstanding characteristics is that they are willing
to venture into other parts of the world to establish themselves.
</P>
<P>
During the last hundred years, the Hakka have migrated to
countries in Southeast Asia, East Africa, Europe and North and
South America.
