PRESIDENT'S REMARKS `UNRELATED TO TAIWAN INDEPENDENCE': OFFICIALS
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taipei,  March  5 (CNA) 03/05/07  21:18:42 (By Flor Wang)

President Chen Shui-bian's most recent remarks about Taiwan's
sovereignty and cross-Taiwan Strait relations are not meant to
proclaim Taiwan independence, nor are they a prelude to changing
Taiwan's official designation,  Presidential Deputy Secretary-
General Cho Jung-tai said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Cho's remarks came after Chen said the previous night at a dinner
party marking the 25th anniversary of the Washington, D. C.-based
pro-independence Formosan Association for Public Affairs (FAPA)
that Taiwan  wants  formal  proclamation of  Taiwan
independence, "rectification" of its national designation, new
constitution and development -- which Chen dubbed his "four wants
and one without."
</P>
<P>
In Taiwan, there is no dispute over which path the country should
take, rather it is an issue about national identification, Chen
said.
</P>
<P>
According to Chu, Chen issued the statement out of grave concern
amid the growing threat from China.
</P>
<P>
Brushing aside criticism that Chen's remarks were electioneering
prior to December's legislative elections and the 2008
presidential race, Cho said that Chen would be an irresponsible
head of state if he were to turn a blind eye to the situation.
</P>
<P>
The government has to be consistent and coherent in its policy
and the president's statement on an important occasion must not
be misrepresented as a scheme to solicit voter support at a time
when China has spared no efforts to reinforce its military
buildup aimed at Taiwan, Chu said.
</P>
<P>
Another presidential deputy secretary-general, Chen Chi-mai,
admitted that Chen's words were in essence what he felt and
learned after serving as Taiwan president since 2000.
</P>
<P>
Chen Chi-mai urged the public to "think positively" of the
president's remarks, which he described as being aimed at raising
public awareness of the Taiwan identity concept.
</P>
<P>
What the president said has "nothing to do" with his " five noes"
policy outlined in his 2000 inauguration speech, neither does it
breach the platform of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) or violate his "five noes" promise, according to Chen Chi-
mai, who did not elaborate.
</P>
<P>
President Chen's desire to proclaim Taiwan independence is not a
regression in his pursuit of the cause, rather it is a noble task
for the country, Chen Chi- mai said.
