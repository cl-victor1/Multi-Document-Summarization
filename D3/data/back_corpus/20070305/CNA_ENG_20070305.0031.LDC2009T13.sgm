Taipei,  March 5 (CNA) 03/05/07  21:10:20 (By Ruth Wang)

A total of 15 tonnes of Taiwanese bananas were shipped from
Kaohsiung Port to Busan, South Korea Monday, indicating a return
of this fruit to the Korean market after a 10-year absence, a
spokesman for the Council of Agriculture (COA) said that same
day.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said high quality Taiwanese bananas were usually
exported to the Japanese market to take advantage of higher
prices in that market over those offered in other Asian
countries, but exports had been overly reliant on the one market.
</P>
<P>
The shipment of Taiwanese bananas to South Korea should help to
decrease the impact of fluctuations in the Japanese market and
improve the development of banana industry.
</P>
<P>
The COA plans to hold a press conference and marketing activities
in South Korea's capital, Seoul, when this shipment of bananas
enter Korean market to increase the visibility of Taiwan's
produce.
