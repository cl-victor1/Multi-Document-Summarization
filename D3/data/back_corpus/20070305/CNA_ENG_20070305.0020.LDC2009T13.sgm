Taiwan's highest peak received snowfall Monday as a wet cold
front reached the island, bringing cold weather and showers to
the whole country, the Central Weather Bureau (CWB) reported that
day.
</P>
<P>
According to the CWB Yushan meteorological station, the mountain
received 0.1 cm of snow in a 10-minute flurry in the early
morning.
</P>
<P>
The mountain is one of the country's most popular hiking
destinations and only re-opened March 1 to the public after an
annual one-month closure aimed at allowing the environment and
wildlife some time to recover from the influence of human
activity.
</P>
<P>
CWB meteorologists forecast even colder weather Tuesday as the
cold air mass from China becomes more and more powerful, and
further snowfalls are predicted.
</P>
<P>
The temperature plunged to 16 C in the daytime from the 27 C or
28 C of the past few days.
</P>
<P>
The CWB forecast that central and northern coastal areas will
experience temperatures as low as 10 C - 11 C on Tuesday and
Wednesday, with lows of 13 C in the south.
</P>
<P>
The cold front is not expected to lose its power until Thursday,
the CWB reported.
