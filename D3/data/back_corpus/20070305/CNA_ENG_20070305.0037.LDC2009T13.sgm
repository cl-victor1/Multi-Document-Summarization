PRESIDENT'S LATEST REMARKS 'ELECTION RHETORIC': ACADEMIC
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taipei,  March 5 (CNA) 03/05/07  21:27:30 (By Lilian Wu)

<P>
Both the United States and China should realize that President
Chen Shui-bian's latest remarks are just "electoral rhetoric" and
were not meant to impact the triangular relations between Taiwan,
the U.S. and China, a scholar said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Lo Chih-cheng, director of the Department of Political Science of
Soochow University, made the remarks in the wake of President
Chen's address at a dinner party held in Taipei Sunday to
celebrate the 25th founding  anniversary  of the Washington-based
pro-independence Formosan Association for Public Affairs (FAPA) ,
a non-profit organization promoting Taiwan's cause.
</P>
<P>
Chen said that Taiwan wants independence, a new constitution,
development and a change of its official name, and that 'Taiwan'
is the best name for the country to use in its bid to join the
United Nations and other international organizations.
</P>
<P>
Chen also explained that this is not a problem of leftist or
rightist policy lines but only one of national identity and the
question of whether to unify with China or secure Taiwan's formal
independence.
</P>
<P>
In Lo's views, the president's advocacy of independence is not a
declaration of independence, nor does it touch on the nation's
official name. His advocacy of a new constitution has also been
mentioned on many occasions, he added.
</P>
<P>
Lo said that he doesn't think that President Chen is retreating
from his "four noes" pledge, made in his 2000 inaugural speech,
which includes pledges not to declare independence and not to
change the nation's official name if Beijing does not use force
against Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
"The U.S. and China should realize that the president's remarks
are electoral rhetoric, and that he will not make drastic
adjustments in his cross-strait policy, " Lo said. The U.S. and
China need not play along with the 'electoral rhetoric" for
cementing core, or "dark green", support for the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party for the year-end legislative
elections and the March 2008 presidential election.
</P>
<P>
Liu Bih-rong, a professor of politics at Soochow University, also
said that the U.S. and China seem to be dealing with Chen's
latest remarks in a "cool manner."
</P>
<P>
They should see Chen's remarks as an electoral gambit, though the
effect of it remains to be observed, Liu said.
</P>
<P>
Although he voiced worries about the DPP, which seems to be
tilting toward its core "dark green" supporters. Taiwanese
society also seems to be splintering at an accelerating speed, he
added.
</P>
<P>
Lai I-chung, director of DPP's Department of Chinese Affairs,
said that President Chen's remarks reflect the reality that
Taiwan is effectively independent from the People's Republic of
China.
</P>
<P>
The DPP has also long promoting the name-change drive and the
crafting of a new constitution, Lai said.
</P>
<P>
In Taiwan, the perception of a status quo is that Taiwan and the
People's Republic of China are independent of one another, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Lai said that the president's "four noes" pledge applies to his
term in office, while the "four wants and one without" is his
vision for the nation's longer- term development.
