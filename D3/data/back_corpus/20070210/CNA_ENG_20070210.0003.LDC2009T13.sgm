NAME CHANGE COSTS LOW, WON'T AFFECT STAFF'S RIGHTS: CABINET
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  Feb.  9 (CNA) 02/10/07  12:07:53 (By Sofia Wu)
</P>
<P>
The funds needed to change the names of three state-run
enterprises are limited and the move will not affect their
employees' legitimate rights and interests in any way, Cabinet
spokesman Cheng Wen-tsang said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Cheng made the remarks after the Chinese Petroleum Corp. (CPC) ,
China Shipbuilding Corp. (CSBC) and Chunghwa Post Co. approved
their name changes in board meetings earlier in the day.
</P>
<P>
Noting that changing corporate titles to remove references to
China and prevent confusion with Chinese counterparts  is the
government's long-term policy goal, Cheng said each of the three
companies has been assessing the feasibility of name changes for
quite a long time.
</P>
<P>
According to Cheng, all three companies fleshed out comprehensive
technical details regarding name changes before presenting them
to the Executive Yuan for approval. "We have avoided premature
exposure to prevent controversies, " he said,  adding that
Premier Su Tseng-chang has kept President Chen Shui-bian informed
of the developments in the issue.
</P>
<P>
The name changes  follow calls from the ruling Democratic
Progressive  Party  to remove  references  to China  in state
organizations.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese Petroleum Corp. said its new name is CPC Corp.,
Taiwan, while China Shipbuilding said it will be called CSBS
Corp., Taiwan. The oil company's name change took effect
immediately, while the CSBC's name change is still pending a
formal endorsement by its shareholders at a March 1 meeting.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Economic Affairs Chen Ruey-long said the name changes
will contribute to upgrading the images of the two companies'
brand awareness and international competitiveness, while
requiring only a limited outlay of financial resources and will
have no adverse impact on the rights and interests of corporate
staff.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, he added, the name changes will have a positive impact
on the two companies' sustainable development.
</P>
<P>
Chunghwa Post -- Chunghwa means "Chinese" -- changed its name to
Taiwan Post Co., Ltd, but only after the meeting of its board was
disrupted by opponents from the company's labor union.
</P>
<P>
Dozens of protesters kicked down the door of the meeting room and
forced board members to move to another location. The union
claimed that the name change would cost too much and come at the
expense of the company's employees.
</P>
<P>
However, Minister of Transportation and Communications Tsai Duei
said the name change will hardly impact the postal company's
business growth nor undermine the rights and interests of its
staff and clients.
</P>
<P>
As to the cost, Tsai said the name change will cost the postal
company less than NT$70 million.
</P>
<P>
Tsai said the postal company has been preparing for the name
change since the Executive Yuan ordered a study of the
feasibility in 2004.
</P>
<P>
Both CPC Corp., Taiwan and Taiwan Post Co. will begin to use new
signboards Monday. Plaque unveiling ceremonies will be held at
both firms' Taipei head offices at 2 p.m.
