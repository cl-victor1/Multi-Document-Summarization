ZAMBIAN OPPOSITION PARTY CONSIDERING OPENING OFFICE IN TAIWAN

The Patriotic Front, Zambia's major opposition party, may open a
representative office in Taiwan to learn from the country's
experiences in technological and democratic development, the
party's leader said in Taipei earlier this week.
</P>
<P>
Speaking in an interview with the Central News Agency prior to
his departure Friday for home after a five-day Taiwan visit,
Michael Chilufya Sata said he has been impressed by Taiwan's
booming economy and technological advancement as well as its
liberal democracy during his stay in Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
"This is my first trip to Taiwan, and it won't be my last. I'm
impressed by Taiwan's prosperity and development in various
fields. After I return to my country, I'll discuss with my party
colleagues the possibility of operating a liaison office in
Taiwan, " Sata said, adding that given its proximity to Hong
Kong, Japan, South Korea and the Philippines, Taiwan is an
appropriate location to be home to his party's Asia base.
</P>
<P>
Praising Taiwan as having come a long way in transforming itself
from an agricultural backwater into an industrial powerhouse,
Sata said he believes that African countries, including Zambia,
should have much to learn from Taiwan's developmental
experiences.
</P>
<P>
"It is regrettable  that few Africans know about Taiwan's
achievements in technological and democratic development, and I
believe that such ignorance is the major reason behind the sad
fact that only five African countries recognize Taiwan," Sata
said.
</P>
<P>
Sata, 70, is a prominent Zambian politician known for his
activism. He used to be a provincial head and held Cabinet posts
in labor, health and social welfare fields. He made headlines
last September when he drew the ire of China by calling Taiwan a
sovereign state on the campaign trail ahead of the Zambian
presidential election.
</P>
<P>
Sata led by a large margin in the Zambian capital, major copper
mining towns and urban areas in the first two days of the vote
count, but the situation took a dramatic turn on the third day,
with incumbent President Levy Mwanawasa coming from behind to
score an upset victory. Sata ended up losing the election,
garnering only 30 percent of the vote to Mwanawasa's 43 percent.
</P>
<P>
Sata's supporters staged a two-day rally to protest the result
but were dispersed by police with tear gas and warning shots.
Sata later conceded defeat (with) but maintained that the ruling
party had rigged the vote.
</P>
<P>
When Chinese President Hu Jintao visited Zambia early this month,
the Patriotic Front issued a statement expressing Zambian
people's anti-China sentiments. Hu was forced to cancel his plan
to visit a Chinese-run copper mine north of Zambian capital after
learning that Patriotic Front supporters were planning to stage a
protest against Hu's visit. Due to his anti-China stance, Sata
was excluded from all welcoming activities during Hu's visit.
</P>
<P>
Noting that his party holds a strong clout in Zambia's capital
and copper mining areas, Sata said he believes that Hu should
have gotten the message of Zambian people's discontent with
China's exports of laborers to work at Zambian's mining areas.
</P>
<P>
"China's labor exports to Zambia and other African countries have
caused resentment among Africans because Africa itself has
abundant labor supplies but lacks job opportunities," Sata said.
</P>
<P>
Asked why he is so critical of China at a time when most African
countries are vying for China's aid in their economic
development, Sata said their expectations are based on wrong
perception and ignorance of the many meaningful aid projects
Taiwan has launched for his five African allies -- Malawi,
Burkina Faso, Swaziland, The Gambia and Sao Tome &amp; Principe.
</P>
<P>
Sata further said he believes that China's relentless efforts to
block Taiwan's international presence and constant military
threat against Taiwan mainly result from "its jealousy of
Taiwan's successful economic development  and its fear of the
spread of Taiwan's democratic  notions and lifestyle across the
Taiwan Strait to influence its people."
</P>
<P>
Asked why he recognizes Taiwan as a sovereign state, Sata said
Taiwan is a bona fide sovereign state because "it has its own
government, lifestyle and has been independent for more than 50
years." He further said Taiwan's future will mainly be decided by
its own people, not anybody else. Sata said if had won Zambia's
last presidential  election,  he would have switched  his
country's diplomatic recognition from Beijing to Taipei.
