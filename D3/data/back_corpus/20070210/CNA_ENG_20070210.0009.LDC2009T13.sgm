The United States does not support steps that would appear to
change Taiwan's status unilaterally, including changes  in
terminology  for entities administered  by Taiwan authorities, a
U.S. State Department official said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Sean McCormack, spokesman of the department, reiterated that the
maintenance of peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait remains
the primary interest of the United States.
</P>
<P>
"The United States does not support Taiwan independence and
opposes any unilateral steps by either side that would change the
status quo," McCormack said during a daily press briefing.
</P>
<P>
"President Chen's fulfillment of his commitments will be a test
of leadership, dependability and statesmanship, as well as the
ability to protect Taiwan's interests, its relations with others,
and to maintain peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait," he
added.
</P>
<P>
McCormack made the statement in response to questions concerning
President Chen Shui-bian's recent indication of plans to change
the names of Taiwan's overseas outposts.
</P>
<P>
In the latest issue of his online newsletter published Thursday,
Chen said that besides the government's current efforts to change
the names of state-owned enterprises that contain references to
China, the names of the country's overseas embassies and
representative offices will also be changed in the future to
highlight Taiwan's identity.
</P>
<P>
In their respective board meetings held Friday, the Chinese
Petroleum Corp. decided to change its name to "CPC Corp., Taiwan,
" China Shipbuilding Corp. decided to change its name to "CSBC
Corp., Taiwan" and Chunghwa Post Co. decided to change its name
to "Taiwan Post Co."
</P>
<P>
The ruling Democratic Progressive Party has been promoting the
name rectification  campaign to avoid confusion resulting from
Taiwan-based organizations carrying similar names to
organizations in China.
