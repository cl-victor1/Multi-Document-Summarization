The Financial Supervisory Commission (FSC) reminded users of
online banking services Saturday to check their bank's Web site
address before engaging in any transactions or information
exchanges in order to protect themselves from being "phished" by
cyber-criminals.
</P>
<P>
The FSC issued the warning after the technology crimes prevention
and control center of the Criminal Investigation Bureau (CIB)
revealed that it has recently discovered that some computer
hackers from China have been acquiring online banking users'
personal information, such as bank account numbers and passwords,
through false bank Web sites.
</P>
<P>
Explaining the scheme called "phishing, " anti-technology crime
police officers said that "phishers"  copy Web site pages of
legitimate banks to trick users into disclosing sensitive
personal information.
</P>
<P>
People who do not have the habit of checking the official Website
address of their banks can easily be cheated as the false bank
Web sites look almost identical to the real ones, the police
said.
</P>
<P>
According to the CIB center, in addition to personal information
of bank clients, the phishers have also been discovered to have
been stealing money from bank accounts online by cooperating with
criminal rings in Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
The FSC therefore called for the public to be on alert against
this new type of online fraud and to avoid communicating by
e-mail with any banks or other businesses with which they are not
familiar.
</P>
<P>
People should always check information on exchanges through their
online bank accounts and contact their bank at once if they
suspect that their bank accounts and passwords have been used
without their authorization, the FSC suggested.
