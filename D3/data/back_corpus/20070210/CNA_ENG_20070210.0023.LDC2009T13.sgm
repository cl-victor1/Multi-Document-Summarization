Taipei, Feb. 10 (CNA) 02/10/07  19:40:11 (By Lilian Wu)

Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng said Saturday that he is
cautiously assessing his future options amid reports that he is
actively preparing for the Kuomintang (KMT) primary for the 2008
presidential election.
</P>
<P>
Wang was responding to reports by the United Daily News, a major
local newspaper, that he will make a formal announcement to throw
his hat in the KMT primary at an "appropriate time" after the
Chinese New Year holidays to try to win the party's nomination.
</P>
<P>
Instead of confirming the news, Wang said he has to "seriously
consider the questions of what he can do for the country and what
the country should do for the people to live up to their
expectations."
</P>
<P>
"I will also engage in self-reflection to see if I'm capable of
serving the country," Wang continued.
</P>
<P>
"There are many options ahead, and I'll cautiously assess my
future direction, " he said, adding that "I'll not rule out any
possibilities, and staying on in the legislature will also be an
option."
</P>
<P>
Asked about the possibility of running against KMT Chairman Ma
Ying-jeou, the most likely bet of the party for the presidential
election, in the primary, Wang said that he will respect Ma's
decision.
</P>
<P>
The politically-savvy Wang resigned from his concurrent post as
the KMT vice chairman after losing to Ma, then also a KMT vice
chairman, in the party's chairmanship election in 2005. He has
until now been tightlipped about his intentions concerning the
2008 presidential election.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, there were mixed reactions from KMT lawmakers to the
reports.
</P>
<P>
KMT Legislator Wu Yu-sheng said that the primary system will
provide  all aspirants  with the opportunity  to engage in a
"gentlemen's battle, " which he said is better than the fighting
under the table between the four heavyweights of the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) , referring to Vice President
Annette Lu, Premier Su Tseng-chang, former Premier Frank Hsieh,
and DPP Chairman Yu Shyi-kun.
</P>
<P>
While KMT Legislator Hsu Chung-hsiung said that he will not
speculate on unconfirmed reports, his colleague Wu Chih-yang
stressed that "it is a good thing for aspirants to make known
their intentions."
</P>
<P>
Legislator Daniel Hwang, executive director in charge of policy
of the People First Party (PFP) , an ally of the KMT, said that
the party respects "Wang's running for the KMT's nomination in
the primary."
</P>
<P>
Hwang said that he is sure that the two parties will throw their
support behind a presidential candidate endorsed by the KMT-PFP
alliance.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Legislator Lo Chih-ming of the pro-independence Taiwan
Solidarity Union (TSU) noted that Wang has remained on friendly
terms with former President Lee Teng-hui, the spiritual leader of
the TSU.
</P>
<P>
"If Wang can identify with the Taiwan-centric consciousness as
well as the center-left direction espoused by the TSU, then the
chances of bilateral cooperation will increase," Lo added.
