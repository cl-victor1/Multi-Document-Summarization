TAIWAN'S FIRST DEPARTMENT STORE BRAND DOLL TO MAKE DEBUT

Taipei,  Jan. 6 (CNA) 02/06/07  21:30:12 (By T.C. Jiang)

Taipei 101 Mall will become Taiwan's first department store to
launch its own line of doll products as part of the mall's effort
to develop its brand, a department store spokesman said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Scott Chen, vice president of Taipei Financial Center Corp.
(TFCC), which owns the world's tallest skyscraper, Taipei 101,
said that "Damper dolls" and related products will make their
debut Feb. 8. In addition, Taipei 101 will develop a series of
Damper products promoting the beauty of Taiwan, adding that these
will be launched by March.
</P>
<P>
The TFCC's assistant vice president Michael Liu said that Taipei
101 has authorized a Japanese company to design and manufacture
"Damper dolls, " which are expected to generate profits though he
declined to provide an estimate as to how much.
</P>
<P>
The mall views brand management as its top priority, Chen
stressed, and therefore will not open a chain of stores as do
other local department stores.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the mall recently spent nearly NT$20 million on the
promotion of its image by placing advertisements in international
media, Liu complained that the central and local governments have
not created an environment attractive to overseas tourists; as a
result, Taipei 101's marketing efforts have produced limited
benefits.
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, according to Liu, Taipei 101's observation deck
brings in an annual profit of between NT$300 million and NT$400
million.
</P>
<P>
Liu noted that 40 percent of its customers are Japanese, while 50
percent are Taiwanese.
