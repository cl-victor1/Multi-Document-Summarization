Representatives of the Japanese company NEC will come to Taiwan
to look for software outsourcing companies from Feb. 12-14, an
official of the Industrial Development Bureau (IDB) under the
Ministry of Economic affairs said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The IDB has helped Taiwanese software companies find software
outsourcing markets in Asian countries since last year. Minister
without Portfolio Lin Feng- ching led a team of IDB officials and
businessmen in the information service industry on visits to six
Japanese information companies, including NEC, at the end of last
year.
</P>
<P>
More than 10 Taiwanese companies, including MiTAC, Syscom and
Acer, will give brief reports at a business cooperation seminar
held by the IDB Feb. 13 in the hop of winning outsourcing orders
from Japanese companies.
</P>
<P>
The IDB has set a goal for the information service industry to
achieve NT$300 billion(US$9.11 billion) in output value and NT$60
billion in export value, and an NEC order placement would be a
great step forward in achieving this goal, the official said.
