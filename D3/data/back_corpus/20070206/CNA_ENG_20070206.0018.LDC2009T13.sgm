The Cabinet-level Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) will permit
Chinese tourists and cross-Taiwan Strait charter flights on
weekends and holidays soon after wrapping up bilateral
negotiations, MAC Vice Chairman Liu Teh-hsun said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Liu made the remarks at a Legislative Yuan seminar sponsored by
the legislative caucus of the main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) ,
members of which suggested that the government permit the opening
as soon as possible after the coming Chinese New Year -- which
falls on Feb. 18 -- to help bolster Taiwan's economy.
</P>
<P>
Officials from relevant government agencies, including the MAC,
the Ministry of Transportation and Communications, the Ministry
of the Interior and the Central Bank of China (CBC) , as well as
KMT lawmakers such as Tseng Yung-chuan, Lai Shyh-bao, Alex Fei
and Hung Hsiu-chu were present.

According to Liu, bilateral talks on Taiwan's opening to Chinese
tourists, cross-strait weekend and holiday charter flights, and
the exchange of Chinese yuan in Taiwan have made concrete
progress and the MAC will allow the opening soon after the two
sides conclude negotiations.

<P>
CBC Deputy Governor Hsu I-hsiung voiced the bank's support for
allowing renminbi-new Taiwan dollar exchanges in Taiwan as part
of the government's efforts to wipe out black market deals.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, local real-estate and property developers forecast
that opening up to Chinese tourists will galvanize market demand
for department stores, hotels, shopping malls and office
buildings.
</P>
<P>
As Taiwan's property prices still lag far behind those in other
developed countries, coming Chinese tourists with strong
purchasing power are very likely to target the local real-estate
market, industry sources said.
</P>
<P>
According to a survey carried out by the Taiwan Institute of
Economic Research, Chinese tourists spent an average of US$987 at
each retailer -- the world's highest level.
