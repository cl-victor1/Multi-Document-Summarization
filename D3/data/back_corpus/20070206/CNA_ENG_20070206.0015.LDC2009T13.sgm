The number of homestay providers around Taiwan had increased to
2,001 as of the end of 2006, according to tallies released
Tuesday by the Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and

Of the 2,001 homestay providers, 1,704 are licensed, up 42.7

These licensed homestay providers offer a total of 6,836 rooms,

By region, Hualien, Nantou and Yilan counties are home to the
largest number of homestay providers, they said.

While Hualien County saw the number of its homestay providers
soar 73.5 percent from the previous year to 439 in 2006, the
number in Nantou and Yilan counties rose more than 20 percent to
347 and 240, respectively, they said.

Owing to the competition from homestay providers, the average
hotel occupancy rate in the country declined to 69.2 percent in
2006, down 2.8 percentage points over the previous year, the

international-class hotels registered a drop of 2.9 percentage

(US$99.45) per night in 2006, up 5.1 percent from the year-
