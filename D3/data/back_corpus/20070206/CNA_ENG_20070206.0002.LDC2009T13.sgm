Taiwan repatriated Monday 152 illegal Chinese migrants, bringing
the numbers of those still in Taiwanese custody to a historic
low, the National Immigration Agency (NIA) said.
</P>
<P>
The action followed the largest ever operation, which sent home
218 illegal Chinese immigrants on Jan. 26. The Mainland Affairs
Council (MAC) said the repatriation of as many as 370 illegal
Chinese immigrants in only 11 days is encouraging.
</P>
<P>
China has now become receptive to bringing home illegal
immigrants,Liu Te-shun, MAC vice chairman said Monday.This is not
only good news for those Chinese who want to go home for the
Lunar New Year, but also a sign that China is finally willing to
face up to the problem and to take care of its citizens.
</P>
<P>
China's past reluctance to accept the return of its illegal
migrants to Taiwan long disturbed Taiwan authorities. Delays in
repatriation operations often caused the number of migrants held
in Taiwanese facilities to soar, with 1993 seeing a record of
5944 inmates in three asylums in northern Hsinchu, eastern Ilan
and outlying Matsu Island, according to NIA tallies.
</P>
<P>
Now there are only 128 Chinese illegal immigrants in the asylums
after Monday's operation, the NIA officials said, adding that all
of them had been implicated in criminal cases, and therefore
there are no inmates pending repatriation, and this too is a
record, officials said.
</P>
<P>
The repatriation of Chinese illegal immigrants has been conducted
through the Red Cross Societies of the two sides, in accordance
to a 1990 Kinmen Agreement.
