Taipei City social affairs authorities have been managing two
halfway houses for the city's homeless, with the shelters being
equipped with a total of 104 beds to help those living on the
streets survive the bitter winter, city officials said.

<P>
Statistics compiled by the municipal government's Bureau of
Social Affairs show that there are some 500 people living on the
streets in the city, with 220 gathering in the Chungcheng
district and around 80 staying on a street in the old Wanhua
district.

Bureau officials said that currently, the city's policy on
dealing with the homeless issue focuses on efforts to guide
street people to return home and to assist those capable of
working to find jobs.
</P>
<P>
There are two different shelter programs for the homeless, with
the first offering accommodations for a 1-3 month short-term
stay, and the second providing accommodations for up to a year,
according to the bureau.

<P>
Last year, the bureau helped 381 homeless people find jobs, with
128 of these people keeping their jobs for at least three months.
