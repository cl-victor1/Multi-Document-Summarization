DPP TO ASK CABINET TO REMOVE GUARDS AT LATE PRESIDENT'S MAUSOLEUM

The ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) is expected to put
forth a proposal Wednesday recommending that Cabinet remove the
military guards posted at the mausoleum of late President Chiang
Kai-shek, party officials said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Claiming that the Cabinet has no reason to continue to protect
the mausoleum of the "dictator", officials said the job of
maintaining the mausoleum should be taken care of by the
offspring of the Chiangs, not the government.
</P>
<P>
They said DPP Chairman Yu Shyi-kun will officially raise the
proposal during the party's Central Standing Committee meeting,
when Academia Historica Curator Chang Yen-hsien will brief the
committee on an investigative report on who bore responsibility
for the 228 Incident.
</P>
<P>
The report, which was completed two years ago, pinpoints Chiang
Kai-shek as the key perpetrator for the incident that occurred in
1947, in which thousands of people were massacred by KMT troops
in suppression of a rebellion against KMT rule in Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
The proposal to remove military guards from the Chiang's
mausoleum will be yet another move by the DPP to try to eliminate
symbols of authoritarianism associated with the Chiang from the
country, and follows the removal of Chiang Kai-shek's statues
from military bases and a proposal to rename the Chiang Kai- shek
Memorial Hall as "Taiwan Democracy Memorial Hall."
