Vice President Annette Lu announced Monday her withdrawal  from
the Democratic Progressive  Party  (DPP) presidential primary.
</P>
<P>
Lu, who finished last among the four contenders in Saturday's
party member vote with only 8,666 votes, or 6.16 percent of the
total number of ballots cast, said she will throw her weight
behind Frank Hsieh, who finished first with 44.66 percent of the
votes.
</P>
<P>
Lu, who had vowed to fight down to the wire after Saturday's
vote, said that she changed her mind and promised to support
Hsieh's presidential bid after Hsieh visited her Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
Lu's decision leaves Hsieh as the only remaining contender as the
other two, Premier Su Tseng-chang and DPP Chairman Yu Shyi-kun,
quit the race Saturday night after the results of the vote was
announced. In addition to Saturday's primary, the DPP's
presidential nominee must be chosen by taking into consideration
the results of opinion polls to be conducted between May 9-11.
