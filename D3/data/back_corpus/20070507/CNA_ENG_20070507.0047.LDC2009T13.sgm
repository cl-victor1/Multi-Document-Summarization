Approximately 56 percent of Taiwanese mothers are  overburdened,
while  another 14 percent  are  extremely overburdened, according
to the results of a survey released Monday.

The results came after the Child Welfare League Foundation
earlier held a press conference in the run up to Mother's Day,
which falls on May 13 this year.

The foundation conducted the survey of local mothers who have
children between the ages of 4-12 in late March and mid April. A
total of 1,492 valid samples were collected fromaverage mothers
and another 254 fromhigh-risk mothers.

Mothers in Taiwan find themselves under great pressure from
family and work,  a spokeswoman for the Child Welfare League
Foundation said, calling for more family, government, and social
support for mothers.

Up  to  66  percent  of theaverage  motherspolled  are
overburdened,  while 57 percent of thehigh-risk  mothersare
extremely overburdened, the survey indicates.

This shows that life is more difficult for "high-risk mothers"
who are more likely thanaverage mothersto fall into poverty,
debt, illness, and depression, and receive little support, the
survey says.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 9.5 percent ofaverage mothersin Taiwan verge on being
extremely overburdened, the survey points out, stressing that
these "average mothers" have a high probability of becominghigh-
risk mothersand urgently need social assistance.

Alicia Wang, the foundation's executive director, said that one-
quarter of the mothers surveyed said that they do not think they
are doing a good job, and that they do not consider themselves to
be good mothers.

<P>
Another 25 percent of the mothers noted that they are often in a
bad mood, and seven percent said they thought about committing
suicide to escape the pressure, Wang added.

Up to 76 percent of the respondents said that their biggest wish
is to spend more time with their children and listening to their
children; 42 percent said that they wished to have a successful
career; 37 percent noted that they wish that they did not need to
worry about their childrens living expenses and tuition; 23
percent said they wished to have a good body and charming
