DPP PRIMARY WINNER VOWS TO PURSUE NATIONAL GOAL WITH PRAGMATISM
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  May 6 (CNA) 05/07/07  12:27:57 (By Sofia Wu)
</P>
<P>
The ruling Democratic Progressive Party's (DPP's) most likely
candidate for the 2008 presidential election said Sunday he will
pursue the ideal of making Taiwan a normal country in a pragmatic
manner.
</P>
<P>
Frank Hsieh, a witty lawyer-turned-politician who once served as
premier and mayor of Kaohsiung, made the remarks after he emerged
as the surprise winner in the first phase of the DPP's
presidential primary.
</P>
<P>
Describing himself as a pragmatic idealist, Hsieh said that while
he will never forsake his ideal of making Taiwan a normal country
and has confidence in Taiwan's eventual success in securing a
dignified status in the world stage in her right name, he will
pursue those lofty goals under the premises of domestic political
stability and economic prosperity.
</P>
<P>
Hsieh, who defended political dissidents during Taiwan's infamous
martial law era which ended in 1987, also pledged to sincerely
mend the party after the bitterly contested party primary.
</P>
<P>
"We've had verbal confrontations... but those were inevitable
during the process to cultivate a vision for the future," Hsieh
said, adding that the end of the primary vote will mark the
beginning to forge party unity.
</P>
<P>
Hsieh garnered 44 percent of the ballots cast in Sunday's primary
vote by DPP members, while Premier Su Tseng-chang won 33 percent,
according to a press statement issued by the DPP headquarters.
</P>
<P>
Su, widely expected to win, conceded defeat and said he would
pull out of the race.
</P>
<P>
"For our party's unity and its victory in the coming presidential
election as well as the national well-being, I will withdraw from
this primary, " Su said at a news conference. He also pledged to
help the victor of the primary in next year's presidential
election.
</P>
<P>
The vote was open to the some 250,000 members of the DPP, which
has held the presidency since 2000.
</P>
<P>
Under the DPP's primary mechanism, the outcome of the vote by
party members accounts for 30 percent of a hopeful's final score,
with the remaining 70 percent determined by the results of a
series of public opinion polls to be held May 9-11.
</P>
<P>
Just days before Sunday's primary, a fierce bout of mudslinging
erupted between Hsieh and Su. Hsieh's campaign accused Su of
planting a story in a magazine that accused Hsieh of illegally
accepting political contributions while seeking reelection as
Kaohsiung mayor in 2002. Su challenged Hsieh to prove his
innocence.
</P>
<P>
In his post-primary vote speech, Hsieh reiterated his previous
statements that "there is not a single person whom he would not
cooperate and that there is not any hatred that cannot be
forgiven."
</P>
<P>
He also quoted President Chen Shui-bian as saying that promoting
party unity is not only a responsibility but also an unescapable
duty. "I'll go for broke to mend rifts and integrate party forces
to turn the momentum of party primary into capacity for unity."
</P>
<P>
Hsieh, a feisty and resourceful politician, is known to be a
moderate in attitude toward relations with China -- one of the
most important issues in the election in the primary debate.
Since the DPP comes to power, Beijing leaders have refused to
deal with President Chen, who won't endorse eventual unification
with the Chinese mainland. Many believe Hsieh might be more
flexible and pragmatic with China.
</P>
<P>
The two other candidates in the presidential primary were Vice
President Annette Lu, who received 7 percent of the vote, and DPP
Chairman Yu Shyi-kun, who garnered 16 percent, according to the
DPP press statement.
</P>
<P>
After the vote, Yu said he would suspend all campaign activities.
One of his close aides said suspension of campaign activities is
tantamount to withdrawing from the presidential fray.
</P>
<P>
According to DPP regulations, no hopeful can pull out of the race
once he or she register candidacy for the presidential primary.
Therefore, DPP Secretary- General Lin Chia-lung said, the party
central will conduct public opinion polls as scheduled.
</P>
<P>
Lin said Vice President Lu has also told the party headquarters
that  she will continue  her primary  campaign  despite  her
less-than-ideal performance in the members vote.
</P>
<P>
Lu herself also told reporters that she will uphold sportsmanship
and complete the primary proceedings. She further said she is
confident that she would be able to perform better in the
subsequent public opinion polls.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Hsieh paid a visit to Yu shortly after the voting
outcome was announced. Hsieh said he exchanged views with Yu on
how to promote party unity, policy coherence and cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Starting Monday, Hsieh said he will travel around the island to
seek grassroots support for his presidential bid, particularly
DPP county magistrates.
