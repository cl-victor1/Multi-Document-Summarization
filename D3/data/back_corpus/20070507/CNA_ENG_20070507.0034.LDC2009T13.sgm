MOST OF TAIPEI'S THOROUGHFARES FAIL PAVEMENT ROUGHNESS TESTS

Taipei,  May 7 (CNA) 05/07/07  21:00:18 (By Han Nai-kuo)

The Taipei city government needs to do a better job of
maintaining the city's roads to facilitate smooth driving, a city
councilor said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Dai Hsi-chin, a city councilor of the main opposition Kuomintang,
publicized the results of a survey conducted at his request by
the National Central University's  Department of Civil
Engineering, showing that 12 of Taipei's 17 thoroughfares failed
to satisfy a worldwide  standard  for  measuring  pavement
smoothness,  the international roughness index (IRI), with the
acceptable roughness set at 4.5m/km.
</P>
<P>
The index measures pavement roughness in terms of the number of
meters per kilometer that a laser, mounted in a specialized van,
jumps as it is driven across a road system. The lower the IRI
number, the smoother the ride.
</P>
<P>
Dai pointed  out that  the bumpiest  road among  all the
thoroughfares is the elevated Hsinsheng North Road, with a
roughness index of 8.97m/km, while other major roads, including
Jenai Road, Kuangfu South Road and Civic Boulevard, failed to
match even the 5m/km roughness standard for lower-class roads in
Taoyuan County.
</P>
<P>
The New Construction Office under the city government attributed
the abnormal roughness of the city's pavement surface to "too
many manhole covers."
</P>
<P>
City government officials in charge of road construction and
maintenance said they will try to resolve the issue by using
asphalt to cover all manhole covers that are three centimeters
lower than the road surface.
</P>
<P>
Dai reminded the officials that Taiwan Power Co., Chunghwa
Telecom Co., and three city government agencies -- the Taipei
Water Department, the Sewage System Office, and the Traffic
Engineering Office -- are also responsible because they
frequently dig into roads and damage the pavement in order to
carry out their construction and repair work.
