Travel rates on the "mini three links" between Taiwan's Kinmen
and Matsu islands and three ports in China's Fujian Province have
been on the rise, as Q1 figures in both passenger and voyage
numbers have posted noticeable year on year growth, the
government reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics compiled by the Cabinet-level Directorate
General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics (DGBAS) , ferries
shipping between the two sides made a total of 1,300 trips in the
first three months of this year, up by 436 from a year ago.
</P>
<P>
During the same three-month period, more than 98,000 passengers
-- an annual increase of 25.8 percent -- traveled between the two
sides, with some 84,000 leaving Taiwan for China, DGBAS
statistics show.
</P>
<P>
Although only about 14,000 Chinese people entered Kinmen or Matsu
in Q1 via the "mini three links," the figure nevertheless
represented a year on year rise of 48 percent.
</P>
<P>
The "mini three links" were initiated by Taiwan in January 2001
to help offset the disadvantages arising from the lack of direct
shipping and air links across the Taiwan Strait due to the long
political feud between Taiwan and China.
