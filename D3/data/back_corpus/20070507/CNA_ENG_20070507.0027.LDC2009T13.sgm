Taiwan's imports reached US$18.36 billion in April, posing an
11.8 percent growth over the previous month and the highest
single-month  level in history, according  to customs statistics
released Monday by the Ministry of Finance (MOF).
</P>
<P>
The record was attributed to the importing of a Boeing aircraft
worth US$190 million by China Airlines, said Chen Chi-shen, an
MOF official in charge of statistics affairs.
</P>
<P>
The MOF denied that rising oil prices on the international market
was one of reasons for the April import surge, saying that oil
was US$60.03 per barrel on average in April, when Taiwan
purchased a total of 3,003 barrels.
</P>
<P>
In the same month of last year, the average oil price was
US$59.77 per barrel and Taiwan imported 3,303 barrels that month.
These figures prove that oil imports appeared to drop in April,
according to the MOF statistics department.
