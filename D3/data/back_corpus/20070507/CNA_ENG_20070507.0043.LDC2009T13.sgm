CABINET TO CONSIDER ALL FACTORS IN RAISING MINIMUM WAGE
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  May 7 (CNA) 05/07/07  22:01:06 (By Lilian Wu)

<P>
The Executive Yuan will consider all factors when adjusting the
minimum wage, with the level of the hike expected to be finalized
this week, Executive Yuan spokeswoman Chen Mei-ling said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Chen made the remarks after the presidents of six major trade and
industrial organizations issued a joint statement earlier in the
day requesting that the government confine the increase level to
5 percent and the hourly wage to NT$82 (US$2.48).
</P>
<P>
The organizational presidents said that if the minimum wage is
raised by 9 percent, 250,000 enterprises will be affected and the
additional expenses incurred will be at least NT$35 billion a
year.
</P>
<P>
They were responding to a suggestion sent to the Executive Yuan
by the Council of Labor Affairs (CLA) that the hike be 9.09
percent, which would translate to a minimum wage of NT$17,280 per
month, up NT$1,440 from the current NT$15,840, and an hourly wage
of NT$95, up NT$ 29 from the present NT$66.
</P>
<P>
Chen stressed that an adjustment in the minimum wage will not
satisfy everyone, although "the Executive Yuan will strive to
strike a balance through complementary measures, hoping that all
will find it acceptable, although not entirely satisfactory."
</P>
<P>
"After all, the minimum wage has remained unchanged for a
decade," Chen said.
</P>
<P>
Chen reaffirmed that the Executive Yuan hopes the minimum wage
hike can be put into practice July 1, adding that the CLA, the
Ministry of Economic Affairs, and the Council of Economic
Planning and Development are working on the complementary
measures, which should be completed Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Vice Economics Minister Shih Yen-hsiang also said that he
believes the Executive Yuan will consider all facets of the issue
before coming to a fair and balanced decision.
