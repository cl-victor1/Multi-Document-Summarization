The ruling Democratic Progressive Party's (DPP) presidential
primary winner Frank Hsieh announced Monday that he is starting a
"tour of unity and gratitude" in which he will visit the party's
county magistrates and city mayors to solicit their support for
his 2008 presidential election bid.
</P>
<P>
Hsieh has become the party's only candidate for the 2008
presidential election, since the party's other three contenders
-- Premier Su Tseng-chang, Vice President Annette Lu and DPP
Chairman Yu Shyi-kun -- withdrew from the primary.
</P>
<P>
Hsieh called Su, Yu and Lu after the results of primary vote by
DPP members Sunday evening came out to express his hope for party
unity. Hsieh's campaign camp then decided to pay visits to the
party's seven county magistrates and city mayors in the hope that
they can put an end to rifts arising during the bitterly fought
primary.
</P>
<P>
During the campaign, Su was accused by Hsieh, Yu and Lu of using
his administrative resources for his primary campaign to get
seven local government leaders of the DPP on his side. However,
the election results showed that Hsieh enjoyed victory in five of
the seven cities and counties in southern Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Hsieh said his first stop of his tour will be Yunlin County to
call on Magistrate Su Chih-fen, the only local government chief
of the DPP who publicly supported Hsieh and who helped Hsieh get
42.35 percent of the votes in her county.
