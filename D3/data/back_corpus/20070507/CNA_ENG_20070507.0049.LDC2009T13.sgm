The ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) is set to nominate
former Premier Frank Hsieh to run for the presidency as the party
has decided to scrap the second phase of its presidential
primary, DPP acting Chairman Trong Chai said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Chai made the remarks after the DPP's Central Executive Committee
decided at an extraordinary meeting Monday evening to revise the
party's primary regulations to allow for the cancellation of the
opinion poll phase of the primary.
</P>
<P>
The decision came after Hsieh clinched a surprise victory Sunday
in the first phase of the primary, beating favorite Premier Su
Tsen-chang.
</P>
<P>
In the first phase of the primary, the party's 250,000 members
went to the polls to vote for their favored candidate from a pool
of four contenders. Hsieh obtained 44.66 percent of the vote,
while Su took about 33 percent. Su then announced he was pulling
out of the race.
</P>
<P>
According to DPP rules, the result of the vote would have
accounted for 30 percent of any candidate's final score in the
primary, while the remaining 70 percent was to be determined by a
series of public opinion polls originally scheduled for May 9-11.
</P>
<P>
As the two other contenders -- DPP Chairman Yu Shyi-kun who has
been on a leave of absence since April to campaign for his
presidential bid, and Vice President Annette Lu -- have also
decided to drop out of the race and agreed to do away with
opinion polls, Chai said, the DPP Central Executive Committee
came to a decision to have the party's primary regulations
revised to pave the way for scrapping the opinion poll plan.
</P>
<P>
"All  committee  members  unanimously  agreed  to the rule
amendments," Chai said, adding that the committee has also
authorized the party's Central Standing Committee to negotiate
with the four presidential contenders on the return of funds for
the opinion polls.
</P>
<P>
Each  contender  already  paid  NT$7 million  to help the cash-
strapped DPP finance presidential primary spending. Now that no
opinion polls will be held for the primary, Chai said, the party
will return part of the funds to the four contenders.
</P>
<P>
Under original DPP regulations, no candidate was allowed to
withdraw from the primary once the process kicked-off.
