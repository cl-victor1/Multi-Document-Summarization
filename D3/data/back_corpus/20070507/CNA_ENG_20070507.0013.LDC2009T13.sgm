TAIWAN SUSPENDS CHILEAN APPLE IMPORTS

Taiwan has told the Chilean government to stop exporting  apples
to Taiwan after quarantine  inspectors discovered a codling moth
larva in a sample from imported Chilean Gala apples at Keelung in
northern Taiwan, Council of Agriculture (COA) officials said
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Chile is the second apple exporter to be forbidden from shipping
the fruit into Taiwan this year following New Zealand, whose Fuji
apple exports were suspended April 12 after a codling moth larva
was found in a shipment at Taichung harbor in central Taiwan,
according to the COA's Bureau of Animal and Plant Health
Inspection and Quarantine.
</P>
<P>
A total of 4,992 cases of Gala apples from Chile failed to pass
quarantine inspection last week, the bureau said, noting that
under Taiwan's regulations concerning the handling of apples
imported from countries and regions with codling moths, the
contaminated apples will be either returned or destroyed.
</P>
<P>
The suspension will last until the Chilean government looks into
the reasons for the pest's presence, adopts measures to improve
inspections and notifies Taiwan that its exports are free of
codling moths, bureau officials said.
</P>
<P>
According to COA statistics on 2006 apple imports, Chilean apples
accounted for one-third of all apples imported into Taiwan last
year, making Chile Taiwan's second-largest apple source.
</P>
<P>
The codling moth lays eggs on apples and the larvae feed on the
fruit, burrowing into the fruit before leaving to overwinter and
pupate elsewhere. If the moth adapts to Taiwan's climate, it
could attack apples, pears and peaches, causing great damage, COA
officials said.
