CLA CHIEF CALLS FOR HIGHER HOURLY WAGES
</HEADLINE>

Taipei, March 22 (CNA) 03/22/07  23:04:22 (By T.C. Jiang)

<P>
Hourly wage earners in Taiwan should get a larger pay raise than
those receiving a monthly salary, given that positions that pay
an hourly wage are often more intense, the Council of Labor
Affairs (CLA) Chairman Lee Ying-yuan said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Lee made the remarks while fielding questions at the Legislative
Yuan.
</P>
<P>
Lee dismissed media reports, saying that the exact amount of hike
has not been determined yet. He stressed that he will respect the
decision of the CLA's minimum wage review committee.
</P>
<P>
The CLA plans to convene the minimum wage committee at the end of
April to conduct a review of the current rate.
</P>
<P>
An alliance, formed by young workers and students, will file a
petition to the CLA Friday to ask the council to adjust hourly
wage immediately and to levy fines against companies that
illegally offer lower hourly wages, a spokesman for the alliance
said.
</P>
<P>
Substandard hourly wages have long been a problem, the spokesman
claimed, stressing that according to the Labor Standards Act,
local hourly workers are supposed to receive higher wages on
national holidays, rather than the minimum hourly wage of NT$66.
</P>
<P>
The alliance also conducted a field survey and found that many
chain stores -- including MacDonald's, KFC, and 7-11 -- do not
abide by the Act, instead offering only hourly wage of
NT$66-NT$80.
