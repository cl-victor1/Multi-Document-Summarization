SUPREME COURT REJECTS KMT LAWMAKER'S APPEAL

Taipei,  March 22 (CNA) 03/22/07  23:14:12 (By Sofia Wu)

The Supreme Court rejected Thursday an appeal by opposition
Kuomintang Legislator Chiu Yi seeking to overturn a one-year-and-
two-month prison sentence imposed by a lower court for his role
in a violent protest at the Kaohsiung District Court in 2004.
</P>
<P>
The Supreme Court verdict is final, which means that Chiu will
have to serve time in a prison after receiving the court's
official judgment.
</P>
<P>
It remains unclear whether Chiu will resign from his post
following the rejection of his appeal. According to current law,
Chiu will not automatically lose his status as a lawmaker because
the court verdict doesn't deprive his civil rights.
</P>
<P>
If Chiu does not resign voluntarily, he will be the first
legislator to be imprisoned.
</P>
<P>
A Supreme Court spokesman said the court decided to uphold the
Taiwan High Court verdict because the case against Chiu is iron-
clad, with sufficient evidence of his criminal activities.
Television footage and security monitoring videos clearly showed
Chiu heading a group of people attacking the district court's
main entrance in the southern port city in wee hours of March 21,
2004.
</P>
<P>
Chiu led the violent attack in an attempt to force the court to
seize ballot boxes after the KMT's presidential candidate Lien
Chan lost to President Chen Shui-bian in the March 20
presidential election by a razor-thin margin.
</P>
<P>
The violent attack resulted in injuries to eight police officers.
Chiu was indicted on charges of obstructing officials' discharge
of duties and the district court sentenced him to one year and
six months in prison in February 2006.
</P>
<P>
Chiu appealed his case to the Taiwan High Court which reduced his
sentence to one-year-and-two-months last August on the grounds
that Chiu had settled his suits with the eight injured policemen
out of court and compensated each of them to the tune of
NT$10,000.
</P>
<P>
Appealing the high court ruling, Chiu brought his case to the
Supreme Court last September. After several months of carefully
scrutinizing all of the relevant documents, the Supreme Court
finally decided to turn down Chiu's appeal.
