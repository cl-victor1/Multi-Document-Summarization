A total of 14 Taiwanese novels had been translated into Czech as
of the end of 2006 under a plan developed by the National Museum
of Taiwan Literature, and will soon be published in the Czech
Republic, marking a big step forward in introducing Taiwanese
literature to the world, a spokesman for the museum said
Thursday.

The museum worked with Czech academics Lucie Olivova, David Uher
and various Taiwanese professors in selecting and translating the
14 post-1960 novels by 14 Taiwan novelists, including Wang Chen-
ho, Pai Hsien-yung, Chu Hsi-ning, Huang Chun-ming and Chu Tien-
hsin.

The spokesman said project organizer Shih Yi-lin had traveled to
the Czech Republic's Palacky University and Prague for the launch
of the books.

The characteristics of Taiwanese literature and the novelists'
life experiences were taken into consideration during the
selection process, the spokesman said, adding that the novels,
focusing on the wounds of history, criticism and the
underprivileged, represent a good cross-section of Taiwan's
literary arena.
