CABINET SEEKS TO PRESERVE SANATORIUM BUT MAKES NO GUARANTEE
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Taipei,  April  9 (CNA) 04/10/07  11:21:49 (By Y.C. Jou)
</P>
<P>
The Cabinet expressed its willingness Monday to save the 70-year-
old Losheng leprosarium from being dismantled to make way for a
Taipei metro depot project, but fell short of satisfying patients
and preservationists by making mandatory its request that the
Taipei County Government suspend the demolition.
</P>
<P>
As the April 16 departure deadline for patients with Hansen's
disease still living in the Losheng Sanatorium, in Hsinchuang
City, Taipei County, draws near, a group of patients and
activists visited the Cabinet-level Public Construction
Commission and demanded that an alternative retaining 90 percent
of the existing 4-hectare compound be adopted.
</P>
<P>
Chairman of the commission Wu Tse-cheng said in a joint news
conference with petitioners that he will do his best to
communicate with Taipei County Government and Taipei City's
Department of Rapid Transit Systems (DORST) so as to provide "at
least one to two more months" for a better solution to be worked
out.
</P>
<P>
He said the three agencies have been meeting and seeking
technically feasible measures to meet the 90 percent preservation
demand.
</P>
<P>
"We will try to preserve as much as possible and will explain to
the public where preservation is for technical reasons not
feasible," he said.
</P>
<P>
Lee Tien-pei, president of the patients' self-help organization,
said he was disappointed with Wu's stance, saying the Executive
Yuan should immediately issue formal instructions ordering the
Taipei County Government to halt demolition.
</P>
<P>
However, Wu declined the request, saying "there must be mutual
respects between agencies."
</P>
<P>
Cheng Wen-lung, a lawyer from the Legal Aid Foundation, appealed
to what he called the two key persons in determining whether the
sanatorium remains in place after April 16: Premier Su Tseng-
chang and Taipei County Magistrate Chou His-wei.
</P>
<P>
Cheng said Magistrate Chou must not order the demolition before a
renewed assessment over the whole project is completed,
"otherwise he will be condemned in history."
</P>
<P>
He called on Su to publicly meet with the patients and listen to
their wishes and opinions, as well as to order a halt to the
eviction, "so to remove uncertainties afflicting society and the
patients."
</P>
<P>
The leprosarium was built in 1930 by Japanese colonizers to treat
patients with Hansen's disease in segregation, and the Kuomintang
regime in its early years in Taiwan inherited the policy. In
later years, patients were later allowed to leave the sanitarium,
but many, having lived in chronic isolation and faced
discrimination had little choice but to stay, long since grew
accustomed to the settings.
</P>
<P>
Several dozen elderly patients still live in the compound and are
resisting the government's plan to relocate them to a nearby
high-rise hospital.
</P>
<P>
Preservationists have been advocating for the patients' right to
stay and say that as the only leper colony in Taiwan, the
institution provides living testimony to past indignities endured
by the patients and is thus of great historical and cultural
value.
