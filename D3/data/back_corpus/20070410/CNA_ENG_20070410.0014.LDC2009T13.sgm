The crash of an Army UH-1H helicopter in a remote mountain region
in Kaohsiung County in southern Taiwan a week ago could primarily
be attributed to human factors, a senior military officer said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Wang Kuo-chiang, commander of the Army's Airborne and Special
Operations Command (ASPC), made the remarks at a news conference
held at the Ministry of National Defense on the flight mishap in
which the helicopter struck a radio tower and crashed in mid-air,
resulting in the death of all eight officers aboard.
</P>
<P>
Quoting an investigation report by a special military team, Wang
said the tragedy could be attributed to a combination of factors,
including the pilot's failure to gauge the height of the tower,
the crew's poor emergency response skills, and the pilot's
failure to alter course or return to base when weather
condition's suddenly turned for the worse.
</P>
<P>
All the debris of the crashed UH-1H chopper were sent back to the
Kueijen Army Base in neighboring Tainan County for re-assembling
to facilitate probes into the cause of the disaster.
</P>
<P>
The flight mishap claimed the lives of all the eight Army
officers aboard. Five of the bodies were recovered at the crash
site Tuesday, but rescuers didn't locate the remaining three
until Wednesday noon when they were discovered lodged in the
girders of the radio tower, which the helicopter had collided
with in bad mountain weather.
</P>
<P>
The crashed helicopter was manufactured in 1974.  Under a
cooperation deal with U.S.-based Bell Helicopter, the military's
Aero-Industry Development Center -- the forerunner of the
present-day Aerospace Industry Development Corp. -- has built a
total of 118 UH-1Hs since 1969.
