The statistics show that 10.36 percent of all imports into China

the figure for the same period a year earlier, while 13.91
percent of imports into China came from Japan, and 11.59 percent
came from South Korea.

China's exports grew 41.66 percent year-on-year for the period,
while imports rose 20.43 percent, the spokesman said. Imports
from Japan, South Korea and Taiwan grew 20.48 percent, 19.53
percent, and 10.05 percent, respectively, for the period, he
added.

Taiwan, South Korea and Japan are in keen competition in the
Chinese market, with two of the top three products exported to
China from each of the three countries being integrated circuits
and liquid crystal display devices.
