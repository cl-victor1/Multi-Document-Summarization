Taipei,  April 10 (CNA) 04/10/07  21:36:50 (By Elisa Kao)

Opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Legislator Hsieh Kuo-liang said
Tuesday that he will propose a revision to the Presidential and
Vice Presidential Election and Recall Law, requiring that future
presidential  candidates  pass the general English proficiency
test at the intermediate level.
</P>
<P>
Hsieh stressed that since the president has to represent the
country's interests at many international occasions, a certain
level of English speaking capability is a must.
</P>
<P>
Hsieh said the country's general English proficiency test (GEPT)
has been divided into five categories: elementary, intermediate,
high-intermediate, advanced and superior, and he will propose
that future presidential candidates only pass the intermediate
level of English proficiency, which is roughly equivalent to the
English ability of a junior high school graduate.
</P>
<P>
Noting that currently Taiwan's public servants have to pass the
GEPT test when seeking a promotion, and even taxi drivers are
strengthening  their English proficiency,  Hsieh said requiring
presidential candidates to understand and be able to
participating in simple English conversations with foreigners at
international events is quite reasonable.
</P>
<P>
Hsieh said he will also conduct public hearings  to seek the
opinions of the experts and the general public in this regard and
will ask for the Grand Justice's explanation on whether the
proposal would violate the Constitution.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile,  the ruling Democratic  Progressive  Party (DPP)
Legislator Hsiao Bi- kim blasted Hsieh's proposal, describing it
as an international joke, which she said does not conform to
international practice and would violate the Constitution.
</P>
<P>
Hsiao noted that voters will have their own way to gauge a
presidential candidate's global vision, and it should not be
proven by tests.
</P>
<P>
In addition, she added, one's global vision is not well reflected
in language ability.
</P>
<P>
Hsiao went on that she has never heard of another country
requiring their presidential candidates to have certain degree of
proficiency in a foreign language.
</P>
<P>
Even if some foreign leaders are proficient in English, they will
certainly speak in their own languages  at such occasions to
underscore their own country's national identity, Hsiao said,
adding that Hsieh's proposal both violates the Constitution and
constitutes a discrimination against the country's national
language.
