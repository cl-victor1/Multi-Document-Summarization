The Ministry of Education has budgeted NT$100 million (US$3.02
million) to buy books and renovate reading facilities at
elementary and junior high schools in remote places, education
Minister Tu Cheng-sheng said Tuesday.

<P>
Tu made the announcement at Taitung County's Wen Chuan Elementary
School where the county's storytelling association and MOE held a
ceremony to kick off the promotional project.

MOE's 2007 reading promotion budget will help 300 elementary
schools and 219 junior high schools in remote places buy books
and create better reading environments, Tu said.

<P>
By way of example, Tu explained to the school's students how
materials expand and contract with temperature changes by telling
the classical Arthurian legend story of "The Sword in the Stone,
" and encouraged students to save time for learning from
extracurricular readings.

During the ceremony, Tu gave two oars symbolizing navigation to
representatives of the  nation's  21 storytelling  groups  in
acknowledgement of their leading roles in promoting positive
reading habits.
