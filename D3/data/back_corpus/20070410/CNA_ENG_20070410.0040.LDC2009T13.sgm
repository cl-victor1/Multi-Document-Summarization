The 23rd Han Kuang military exercise will be based on a
simulation focusing on a 2012 cross-Taiwan Strait military
situation, an officer of the Ministry of National Defense (MND)
said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The MND's Deputy Chief of the General Staff for the Operations
and Planning, Chiu Kuo-cheng, said at a news conference held by
MND to explain issues related to the 23rd Han Kaung drill slated
for April and May this year.
</P>
<P>
The scenario assumes that Taiwan will have to defend itself from
a Chinese invasion launched in 2012 due to Taiwan's refusal to
participate in unification talks, and that there will have been
no progress in arm procurements by that time, Chiu said, adding
that this year's Han Kuang drill has two phases: full- scale
maneuvers and computer war game simulations.
</P>
<P>
According to Chiu, the full-scale maneuvers will be carried out
in Penghu, Hualien, Yilan, Hsinchu, Taichung, Changhua and
Pingtung areas as scheduled by MND, some of which will be open at
certain times to the public. The computer war game simulations
will proceed for five consecutive days at all command centers,
Chiu added.
</P>
<P>
Chiu said this year's Han Kaung drill requires the participation
of all national defense forces in order to test their combat
readiness to face future joint warfare operations.
