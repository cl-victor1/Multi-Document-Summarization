The government supports promoting sports racing activities, such
as car racing and yachting, in Taiwan, but the proposal has yet
to be fully assessed, Premier Su Tseng-chang said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Su made the remarks during a question-and-answer session at the
Legislative Yuan while fielding questions from main Kuomintang
(KMT) Legislator Liao Wan-ju, after a government planned opening
of car racing and horse racing in central or southern Taiwan,
unveiled last weekend, stirred up heated debate.
</P>
<P>
According to Su, the government backs a well-planned opening of
car racing or yachting with an aim of bolstering tourism-related
businesses, while the horse- racing proposal is out of the
question due to animal protection concerns.

<P>
"For the time being, the entire project is still on the drawing
board," he made clear.

Chang Ching-sen, vice chairman of the Cabinet-level Council for
Economic Planning and Development, shed light last Friday on a
government plan to open car racing and horse racing in central or
southern regions, beginning in June, in an effort to revive local
economies and strike a balance in regional development.
</P>
<P>
But the idea drew flak from KMT lawmakers, who criticized the
ruling  Democratic Progressive  Party administration  for rash
policy-making and called it a tactic to win voter support in the
run up to the legislative and presidential elections.
