Taipei,   April  10  (CNA) 04/10/07  20:41:37 (By Elisa Kao)

The Army Commanding General Chao Shih-chang and the commander of
the Army's Airborne and Special Operations Command Wang Kuo-
chiang were assigned demerits over the recent crash of an Army
helicopter in southern Taiwan which resulted in the loss of eight
elite officers.
</P>
<P>
Hsu Tai-sheng, director of the Joint Operation Training and
Doctrine Office under the Ministry of National Defense (MND) ,
made the announcement Tuesday after the Army released its report
regarding the causes of the crash of the Army UH-1H helicopter,
which hit a transmission tower in the remote mountain region in
Kaohsiung County in southern Taiwan last week.
</P>
<P>
The Minister of National Defense Lee Jye has since demanded that
all aircraft of the same type be grounded for further security
checks.
</P>
<P>
An Army official said the Army will also require in the future
that both chiefs and deputy chiefs of a same unit not board the
same aircraft.
</P>
<P>
The MND report attributed the plane's crash to a sudden change of
the weather in the region that day and an inability on the part
of the pilot and crew members to respond to the emergency.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Army officials added that they will resume as soon as
possible the operations of other UH-1H helicopters, but did not
elaborate on when that might be.
