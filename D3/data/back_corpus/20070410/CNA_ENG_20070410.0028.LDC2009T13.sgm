Taipei, April 10 (CNA) 04/10/07  19:05:20 (By Lilian Wu)

President Chen Shui-bian said Tuesday that the government's
capacity to deal with an emergency has been upgraded through a
simulated drill.
</P>
<P>
The president  made the remarks  after completion  of the first-
stage of the drill sponsored by the National Security Council
(NSC) at a command center in Taipei. Vice President Annette Lu,
Premier Su Tseng-chang  and related government  officials also
participated in the drill on short notice.

<P>
"Only through careful planning in peacetime can we prepare
ourselves well for war," the president said.
</P>
<P>
He added that repeated drills also help to discover problems and
find ways to solve them, thus avoiding unnecessary losses in
times of war.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the NSC denied reports that the drill has anything to
do with political situation or the 2008 presidential election.
</P>
<P>
The NSC was responding to reports by the China Times, a local
newspaper, that said the drill was designed with nearly 200
scenarios against a domestic background in which Ma Ying-jeou,
former chairman of the main opposition Kuomintang (KMT), loses
the 2008 presidential election and his supporters, refusing to
concede defeat, stage a massive protest. As a result Taiwan is
thrown into chaos.
</P>
<P>
The NSC said that such reports  are groundless  and pure
fabrication.
</P>
<P>
The NSC explained that the drill envisioned a scenario in which
major political and economic changes take place in China and
international clashes erupt due to competition for valuable
sources in the Asia and Pacific waters, leading in turn to a bold
move by China to launch a lightning attack on Taiwan.
