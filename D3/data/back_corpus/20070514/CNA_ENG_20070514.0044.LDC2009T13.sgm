More than 2,400 Filipino workers in Taiwan cast their votes in
the Philippines' midterm election Monday, the first time voting-
by-mail has been allowed for the country's overseas workers, the
Manila Economic and Cultural Office (MECO) said.
</P>
<P>
However, a rough count showed that just 12.9 percent of the
18,767 Filipino registered voters in Taiwan bothered to cast
their votes, Carlo L. Aquino, overall coordinator for Philippines
overseas absentee voting in Taiwan told CNA.
</P>
<P>
The Philippine  Commission on Elections (COMELEC)  approved
personal voting for the first time for overseas Filipino workers
(OFWs) in the 2004 election. This year marks the first time OFWs
have been able to vote by mail, said Aquino.

<P>
"We didn't have the kind of turnout rate we would have liked
though, "Aquino admitted, saying the turnout rate was probably
because most OFWs in Taiwan are only allowed to go out one Sunday
every month and do not have easy access to MECO offices.
</P>
<P>
In addition, due to registration and postal errors, some ballot
packets were not sent to the correct addresses in Taiwan, Aquino
added.
</P>
<P>
Aquino also encouraged Taiwan's legislation to pass its own
absentee voting act to respect the basic civil right of every
Taiwanese national.
