MAYOR THREATENS TO ARREST DAMAGERS OF CKS HALL
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  May 14 (CNA) 05/14/07  19:06:10 (By Maubo Chang)

Taipei Mayor Hau Lung-bin vowed Monday to arrest anyone who tries
to damage the Chiang Kai-shek Memorial Hall, which is at the
center of a confrontation between the city government and the
Executive Yuan.
</P>
<P>
Fielding questions from city councilors, the mayor, a member of
the opposition Kuomintang (KMT), said the hall has been
provisionally designated as a heritage site by the city
government and that anyone, especially officials, who tries to
destroy it will face immediate arrest and be dealt with according
to the law.
</P>
<P>
The mayor's announcement was made after the Executive Yuan
decided in April to rename the hall the Taiwan Democracy Hall in
line with President Chen Shui- bian's policy of ridding the
country of the legacy of the late President Chiang Kai-shek,
described by Chen as the culprit behind the 228 Incident of 1947
during which many local people were killed by the government for
rebelling against Chiang's authoritarian rule.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of the Education, which oversees the hall, said May
9 that it will replace the name plate of the hall "on a
convenient day, " a decision that was opposed by the KMT, among
whose followers Chiang still commands high respect.
</P>
<P>
Lee Yung-ping, director of the city's Department of Cultural
Affairs, told the council afterward that her office is keeping a
close eye on maintenance work undertaken by the management of the
hall before the building was designated as a heritage site to
ensure that no "damage" was done to the "historical building."
</P>
<P>
Yeh Ching-yuan, director of the city's Law and Regulation
Commission, assured the city council that the city government is
empowered by law to bring anyone who damages a heritage site to
justice, and said that any officials who commit this offense will
be subject to punishment one-and-a-half times heavier than that
for members of the public.
