Taipei,   May  14  (CNA) 05/14/07  20:15:17 (By Flor Wang)

<P>
Premier-designate  Chang Chun-hsiung confirmed Monday that he
will assume his new post May 21.
</P>
<P>
Chang, a senior lawmaker who has served as chairman of the semi-
official Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) since 2005, made the
comments to reporters after visiting ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) Chairman Yu Shyi-kun at the party
headquarters.
</P>
<P>
Chang also visited outgoing Premier Su Tseng-chang earlier that
day and was slated to later meet former Premier Frank Hsieh, who
won the May 6 vote by party members in the DPP's primary to
select a presidential candidate for the 2008 election.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the formation of a new Cabinet, Chang said that he
will not take DPP factional differences into account and that
selecting the "right person for the right post" will be his
principle in choosing his Cabinet members.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng of the main
opposition Kuomintang (KMT) expressed hope that the new premier
will negotiate better with the Legislative Yuan to help push for
the passage of two key bills -- the draft Central Election
Commission Organic Law and the 2007 central government budget.
</P>
<P>
Wang suggested that the new Cabinet members should fairly and
rationally discuss and negotiate with lawmakers of the various
parties if the ruling DPP wants to see quicker passage of the
budget bill in the Legislative Yuan.
