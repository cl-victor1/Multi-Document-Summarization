The chief of the General Political Warfare Bureau under the
Ministry of National Defense (MND) confirmed Monday that the
"five convictions" that have been followed by members of the
country's armed forces as spiritual and behavioral guidance have
been reduced to three.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the Legislative Yuan, Chen Kuo-hsiang confirmed that
of the "five convictions"  --  doctrine,  leadership,  nation,
responsibility  and honor -- the notions  of "doctrine"  and
"leadership" have been omitted as times have changed.
</P>
<P>
He said the convictions of "doctrine" and "leadership" were
omitted because they are already enshrined in the Constitution
and the National Defense Act.
</P>
<P>
The warfare chief said that the Defense Ministry conducted
careful discussions on the omission before deciding on it and
that the ministry secured the support of members of the
Legislature on the matter, adding that the omission work will be
completed before the end of June.
</P>
<P>
Defense Minister Lee Jye admitted at the Legislative Yuan May 7
that the "five convictions" followed by the Republic of China
military for over six decades have been reduced to only "nation,
responsibility and honor, " while Chen Kuo- hsiang said at that
time that the omission was still under discussion and that no
conclusions regarding the matter had yet been reached.
