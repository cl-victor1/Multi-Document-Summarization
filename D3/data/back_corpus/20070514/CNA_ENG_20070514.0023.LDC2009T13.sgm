A delegation made up of representatives of 38 Taiwan companies
and 12 agricultural associations is taking part in the 12th Asian
International Exhibition of Food and Drink being held May 13-16
in Hong Kong, the delegation's leader, Lin Chen-hsuan, said
Monday.

<P>
Lin, also the honorary chairman of the Taiwan Rice &amp; Cereals
Industrial Association, said the delegation has set up a total of
50 booths at the Hong Kong Convention &amp; Exhibition Center to
exhibit Taiwan's agricultural products, including fruits, rice,
tea, wine, frozen food, eggs, candies and cookies.

<P>
Lin said Hong Kong is the second largest market for Taiwan
agricultural exports and is also an important channel for Taiwan
to export agricultural products to China. Taiwan exported US$490
million worth of farm produce to Hong Kong in 2006, he added.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan's rice, fruits and tea are internationally competitive in
terms of quality, but sales have been affected by higher prices
and production costs, Lin said.
</P>
<P>
However, Lin added, Taiwan's agricultural trade with Hong Kong
has increased in volume year by year, adding that he believes the
biennial international food show in Hong Kong deserves the credit
for this growth.
