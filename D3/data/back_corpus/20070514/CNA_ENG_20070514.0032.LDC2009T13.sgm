LOW AVAILABILITY OF MIRAGE JET FIGHTERS `UNACCEPTABLE': KMT
LAWMAKER
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  May  14 (CNA) 05/14/07  19:58:27 (By Han Nai-kuo)

A lawmaker of the opposition Kuomintang (KMT) said Monday that
the low availability of the Republic of China Air Force's Mirage
2000-5 jet fighters is "unacceptable."
</P>
<P>
At a meeting of the legislature's National Defense Committee, KMT
Legislator Lin Yu-fang asked Maj. Gen. Liu Chen-wu, chief of
staff of the Air Force, about the current availability of the 60
Mirage fighters bought from France in the 1990s to upgrade
Taiwan's air defense capability.
</P>
<P>
Liu replied  that the Air Force  maintains  a 54 percent
availability for the single-seater Mirage 2000-5s, and a 75
percent availability for the twin- seaters.
</P>
<P>
Admitting he was unhappy with these figures, Liu agreed with Lin
that the single-seater Mirage 2000-5s are the backbone of the air
force's combat force.
</P>
<P>
Lin said  it is "unacceptable"  that  46 percent  of the single-
seater Mirage fighters are not combat-ready.
</P>
<P>
Tghe KMT added that he could not understand why the air force
keeps spending money to buy new fighter planes while not leaving
enough funds to keep its existing planes in proper condition.
</P>
<P>
Lin raised the questions after an F-5F jet fighter crashed three
days ago during a military drill, killing its two pilots and two
visiting Singaporean military officers on the ground, and
wounding nine others when it hit a military barracks.
</P>
<P>
The F-5 jet fighters have been in service in Taiwan for 33 years,
during which 32 pilots have perished in 30 crashes. In its
heyday, the air force had 308 F-5s, but currently fewer than 100
of the fighters are still in service.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan bought 150 F-16A/B jet fighters from the United States and
60 Mirage 2000-5 fighters from France in the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the Ministry of National Defense submitted a budget
plan to the Legislative Yuan to buy 66 F-16C/D fighters from the
United States, but the legislature denied it on the grounds that
the plan failed to follow the procurement procedure.
