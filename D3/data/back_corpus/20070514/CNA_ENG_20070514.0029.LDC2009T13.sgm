Taipei,  May 14 (CNA) 05/14/07  18:42:50 (By Lilian Wu)

Coast guard officials reported Monday that they had seized a
large haul of contraband cigarettes from the Keelung River in
Taipei, the first such seizure in a river on Taiwan proper.
</P>
<P>
Following a tip-off, coast guard authorities had stepped up
patrols in recent days and detected two suspicious sampans
anchoring beside a dredging vessel in the Keelung River under the
Choumei Expressway early Monday.
</P>
<P>
A search of the vessels found 282 cartons of untaxed cigarettes
with a market value of around NT$846,000 (US$25,640). Although
the crews of the sampans fled, the four crewmen aboard the
dredger were arrested.

<P>
The Coast Guard Administration said it had since November 2006
stepped up a crackdown on contraband agricultural, fishery and
livestock products, as well as live animals, cigarettes and
alcohol.
</P>
<P>
In the past, seizures have been made at sea or in harbors rather
than in rivers, showing that smugglers are trying novel ways to
sneak in contraband.
