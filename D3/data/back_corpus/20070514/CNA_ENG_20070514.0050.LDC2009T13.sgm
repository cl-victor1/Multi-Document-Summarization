President Chen Shui-bian's appointment of Straits Exchange
Foundation (SEF) Chairman Chang Chun-hsiung as the country's new
premier will have a positive impact on relations across the
Taiwan Strait, SEF Secretary-General You Ying- lung predicted
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Chang, a senior legislator who since 2005 has headed the quasi-
official intermediary body dealing with exchanges with China in
the absence of official ties, will be the country's premier most
familiar with cross-strait affairs after he assumes office May
21, You said.

<P>
According  to You,  the SEF has been transformed  into a service-
oriented organization since Chang took over the organization.
</P>
<P>
"Under Chang's leadership, the SEF has set up a service center
for Taiwan businessmen operating in China and has organized an
army of volunteer lawyers and a legal counseling group to help
those with investments in China, " You said, adding that a
special hotline has also been installed to offer emergency
counseling and humanitarian aid for troubled people on both sides
of the Taiwan Strait.

<P>
In addition, You said, a special hotline has also been opened for
the benefit of Chinese spouses of Taiwanese citizens. Thanks to
Chang's innovative planning and devoted services of all SEF
staff, You said, the SEF has emerged as a major cross-strait
service force over the past two years.
</P>
<P>
With his knowledgeable understanding of cross-strait affairs, You
said he believes that Chang will contribute to the development of
cross-strait relations after assuming office.
