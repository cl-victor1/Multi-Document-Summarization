Taipei,  Jan. 12 (CNA) 01/12/07  15:41:44 (By Elizabeth Hsu)

A biennial meeting of film directors from Taiwan, China and Hong
Kong was held in Taichung, central Taiwan, Friday, with Taichung
Mayor Jason Hu hosting the gathering.
</P>
<P>
It was the first time the conference of movie directors from the
two sides of the Taiwan Strait and Hong Kong was held in Taichung
since its formation in 1992. Since that year, the event has been
held in Taiwan, Hong Kong and China on rotation every two years
for film directors in Chinese society to exchange their working
experience and ideas on movie aesthetics.
</P>
<P>
In Taiwan, Taipei had always been the site of the conference in
past years.
</P>
<P>
The Taichung conference -- the ninth of its kind -- was organized
by the Directors Guild of Taiwan (DGT) and attended by
approximately 100 directors from Taiwan, Hong Kong and China,
including Taiwan's Chu Yen-ping and China's Huang Jianxin.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the opening, Chu, who also chairs the DGT, said there
have been pragmatic exchanges among film industries across the
strait over the past years. Since China and Hong Kong have
maintained close relations in terms of film- making cooperation
and left Taiwan behind, "Taiwan needs to run faster to catch up
with the party," he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile,  Huang  noted  that there are still some legal
restrictions on cross- strait exchanges and cooperation in the
movie industry.
</P>
<P>
"If the relevant authorities  on the two sides can allow
cooperation and exchanges of the kind freely, I believe there
will be great Chinese movies produced in the international film
market, " he said.
