Los Angeles,  Jan. 12 (CNA) 01/12/07  19:28:56 (By Chu Lu-sheng

<P>
President Chen Shui-bian departed for Taiwan late Thursday from
Los Angeles after a three-hour transit stop in the U.S. city.
</P>
<P>
The president is scheduled to return to Taiwan early Saturday
morning.
</P>
<P>
During the brief stopover, Chen met with Los Angeles Mayor
Antonio Villaraigosa, three city councilors, three academics and
representatives of the Taiwanese expatriate community in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
Chen cut short his stopover in Los Angeles after his arrival was
delayed for five hours because Mexico rescinded its permission
for his plane to fly through the region under pressure from
China, forcing the plane to make a detour around Mexican airspace
on its way from Nicaragua to Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
Chen visited Nicaragua Jan. 9-11 to attend the inauguration of
Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega.
</P>
<P>
On his way to the Central American country, Chen made a 16-hour
overnight transit stop in San Francisco, where he met with
American Institute in Taiwan Chairman Raymond Burghardt and
former U.S. Secretary of Defense William Perry, and exchanged
views with key U.S. Congressmembers by telephone.
</P>
<P>
Chen also had a 40-minute telephone dialogue with top Washington
officials, which he described as "the best ever" in the past
several years.
