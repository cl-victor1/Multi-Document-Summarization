Several legislators of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party
asked the government Friday to publish the names of legislators
who have outstanding loans owed to the Chinese Bank.
</P>
<P>
The lawmakers made the remarks in the wake of a run on the bank,
a subsidiary of the Rebar Asia Pacific Group, which broke out
Jan. 5 after two other subsidiaries of the group filed for
bankruptcy protection a day earlier.
</P>
<P>
More than 40 Rebar Group executives have been questioned, and two
family members of Wang You-theng, founder of the group who fled
to China late last month, have been detained over the financial
scandal.
</P>
<P>
Legislator Chuang Shou-han said that the DPP demands that the
government publish the names of the legislators who together have
accumulated debts amounting to over NT$30 million (US$914,630) in
recent years, noting that many people have complained that a
great number of legislators have borrowed from the Chinese Bank.
</P>
<P>
Chuang said he hopes for speedy passage of the amendment to the
bank law to establish a legal basis for the government to publish
the names of these legislators.
</P>
<P>
Legislator Huang Chien-huei of the DPP echoed Chuang's words,
saying that lawmakers from across the party spectrum should join
hands to promote speedy passage of the amendment.
