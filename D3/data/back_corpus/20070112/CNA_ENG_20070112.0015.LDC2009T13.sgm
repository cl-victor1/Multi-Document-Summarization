PRESIDENT ARRIVES IN LOS ANGELES FOR TRANSIT STOP
</HEADLINE>

Los Angeles,  Jan.  11 (CNA) 01/12/07  16:59:32 (By Wen Kuei-
hsiang and Y.F. Low)
</P>
<P>
President Chen Shui-bian arrived in Los Angeles late Thursday for
a transit stop on his way back to Taiwan from a visit to
Nicaragua.
</P>
<P>
Chen was greeted by American Institute in Taiwan Chairman Raymond
Burghardt and Taiwan's representative to the United States David
Ta-wei Lee on his arrival at the Los Angeles International
Airport.
</P>
<P>
The president's arrival was delayed for five hours because Mexico
rescinded its permission for his plane to fly through its flight
information region under pressure from China, forcing the plane
to make a detour around Mexican airspace.
</P>
<P>
Owing to the delay, the president was unable to attend a dinner
reception hosted by the Taiwanese expatriate community in Los
Angeles and had to call off scheduled meetings with U.S. Congress
members and academics, officials said.
</P>
<P>
However, he was scheduled to have various other activities not
open to the media in Los Angeles before returning to Taipei early
Saturday, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
Speaking of China's sabotaging of his plan to fly through Mexican
airspace, Chen told Taiwan reporters while on the plane that he
felt regret and was surprised by the incident.
</P>
<P>
According to Chen, China made the move because it was trying to
regain the upper hand after its protest against his transit stops
in the United States was ignored by Washington and its effort to
have Nicaragua switch recognition from Taipei to Beijing was
unsuccessful.
</P>
<P>
Noting that China adopted a similar method to bar him from flying
through Philippine airspace on his way to visit Palau last year,
Chen said this is a new tactic of Beijing using its diplomatic
allies to isolate Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Chen disclosed that Beijing had also attempted to pressure the
Spanish news agency EFE into cancelling an interview with him
while in Nicaragua but the request was rejected by EFE.
</P>
<P>
Despite the suppression from China, Chen said he will not give up
his efforts to expand Taiwan's foreign relations.
