A university executive quarrelled with a senior official of the
Ministry of Education (MOE) during the 2007 national conference
of university presidents Friday that opened in Kaohsiung,
southern Taiwan a day earlier, over a media report on a plan for
tuition fee hikes.
</P>
<P>
Top executives of 156 public and private universities around the
country who participated in the annual conference passed a
proposal Thursday to advise the MOE to allow colleges and
universities to decide whether or not they will raise tuition
fees and by how much, up to a ceiling of 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
However, the plan drew criticism from the media Friday with
reporters arguing that the proposal was formed hastily. "The
thought of tuition adjustment has replaced the idea of education,
"the reporters said.
</P>
<P>
Angry with the reports, Taoyuan-based Ching Yun University Vice
President Lin Chung-lian said the integrity of university
presidents had been smeared.
</P>
<P>
"MOE officials should be the ones on the battlefront facing the
attacks, not university officials," Lin said, claiming that the
issue of tuition hikes is the MOE's responsibility.
</P>
<P>
Lin's remarks however drew severe criticism from the MOE's
Director of Higher Education Chen Teh-hua, who said university
administrations "have never been on the frontline."
</P>
<P>
In an attempt to calm the argument, National Taiwan University
President Lee Si- chen, who is also chairman of the Association
of National Universities of Taiwan, explained that three
organizations of university and college chiefs had been
discussing the tuition hikes since October and that the decision
was not made in haste.
</P>
<P>
Lee also said the tuition hike plan was formed after rational and
complete discussions based on data and information that revealed
schools are suffering financial difficulties.
