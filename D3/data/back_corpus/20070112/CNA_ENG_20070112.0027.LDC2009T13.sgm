</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  Jan.  12 (CNA) 01/12/07  19:31:31 (By Y.F. Low)
</P>
<P>
The Taipei District Prosecutor's Office officially accused Rebar
Asia Pacific Group founder Wang You-theng Friday on charges of
violating the Securities Transaction Act and breach of trust over
his role in a series of financial scandals within the business
group.
</P>
<P>
Also accused on the same charges was his wife -- China Rebar Co.
Chairwoman Wang Chin Shih-ying.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the prosecutors issued a warrant for the arrest
of the couple, who fled to China immediately before the scandals
broke.
</P>
<P>
They will be put on a wanted list next Monday at the earliest
unless they are arrested by Saturday, prosecutors said, adding
that they can remain on the list for as long as 25 years if they
are not captured.
</P>
<P>
The scandals came to light last week after the group's China
Rebar Co. and Chia Hsin Food and Synthetic Fiber Co. went into
insolvency, triggering a run on the Chinese Bank, another Rebar
affiliate.
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors have forbidden 47 Rebar group executives and Wang
family members from leaving the country following a search of
Rebar headquarters and other subsidiary offices and seizure of
key evidence unfavorable to those who stand accused.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, prosecutors detained Union Insurance Co. President
Wang Shih-chan -- Wang's younger brother -- and Chia Hsin Food
and Synthetic Fiber Co. President Wang Ling-yi -- one of Wang's
sons -- as part of their investigation into the scandals.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, in a meeting for creditor banks of China Rebar Co. and
Chia Hsin Food and Synthetic Fiber Co. held Friday, the banks
demanded that the two companies withdraw their insolvency
reorganization petitions within a week and present operation
plans within two weeks.
</P>
<P>
Otherwise, the creditor banks will petition the court to counter
their requests for insolvency reorganization, bank officials
said.
