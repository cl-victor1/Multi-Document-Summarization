Three Army brigade commanders were relieved of their positions
recently after their units failed a comprehensive combat
capability assessment, Army Commanding General Gen. Hu Chen-pu
said Friday.
</P>
<P>
In the coming three months, Hu said, deputy commanders, political
warfare chiefs and chiefs of staff of the three units that failed
will also be replaced with a view to upgrading the combat ability
and readiness of military units.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the combat capability assessment uses objective
criteria in determining military personnel promotions and
transfers, Hu said the new merit- only system will help prevent
favoritism within the military.
</P>
<P>
"Whoever fails to lead their brigade to pass the test should step
down from their leadership post, " Hu said, adding that the new
evaluation strategy will contribute to the establishment of a
fairer personnel system and facilitate promotion of competent and
dedicated military officers.
</P>
<P>
According to Hu, the evaluation covers two areas -- tangible and
intangible combat abilities. The assessment was jointly conducted
by the Army's deputy commanding general, presidents of various
military academies, senior executives of test centers, and
commanding officers of local military units.

Military sources said the Army began to test and evaluate combat
acumen and skills of all brigades in the later half of last year.
Three of the tested brigades failed to attain the passing grade
of 70 points on a zero-to-100 scale. Their commanders, all major
generals, have been transferred to non-leadership posts. As two
of them are in their 50s, Army sources said, they may have to
retire a year later.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the new evaluation system, the sources said, the
Army has also launched many other reform initiatives since Hu
assumed his current post last year. The new initiatives include
strengthening location training and field support operations to
hone the Army's contingency combat readiness and response
capabilities.
