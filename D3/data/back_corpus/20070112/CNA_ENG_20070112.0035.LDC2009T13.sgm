LAWMAKERS TO DISCUSS LAW REVISION AIMED AT BIG DEFAULTERS
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  Jan.  12 (CNA) 01/12/07  22:00:21 (By Flor Wang)

<P>
Lawmakers from the ruling and opposition camps agreed Friday to
negotiate a draft law amendment Jan. 15 that would allow the
government to publish the names of major bank loan defaulters in
a bid to clamp down on financial irregularities.
</P>
<P>
Lawmakers at the legislature's Finance Committee were slated to
discuss a revision to Article 48 of the Banking Law but decided
to postpone their discussion on the issue until next Monday after
failing to forge a consensus on the definition of a "major" loan
delinquent.
</P>
<P>
Under the terms of the Banking Law's Article 48 that had already
been screened by Finance Committee lawmakers, banks are not
required to keep confidential the names of borrowers who fail to
pay off bad debts of more than NT$30 million or those who do not
repay loans ranging from NT$10 million to NT$30 million within a
year.
</P>
<P>
According to main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Legislator Joanna
C. Lei, ruling and opposition lawmakers all agreed to the
proposal to publish the names of major bank loan defaulters, but
they differed on the threshold level that should be set to define
a major delinquent.
</P>
<P>
Lawmakers  from different parties agreed to negotiate  the
threshold Monday after the Financial Supervisory Commission (FSC)
has studied the issue and comes out with a reasonable level that
would best serve social justice and market fairness, Lei said.
</P>
<P>
Citing statistics provided by the FSC, Lei said that currently
there are 1,528 borrowers who owe over NT$100 million to banks
and 1,932 who owe between NT$50 million and NT$100 million. A
total of 2,648 customers have failed to pay off bank loans of
between NT$30 million and NT$50 million, while 13,277 people have
yet to repay bank loans of between NT$10 million and NT$30
million, she added.
</P>
<P>
The lawmakers' efforts to provide the banks with a legal basis to
regulate bad loan delinquents came after a run started Jan. 5 on
the Chinese Bank, prompted by insolvency petitions lodged by two
other companies affiliated to their parent company -- Rebar Asia
Pacific Group -- which also owns the Chinese Bank.
</P>
<P>
Group Chairman Wang You-theng and his wife fled to China before
the insolvency petition was made public Jan. 4 -- an incident
that shook public confidence in the domestic financial market and
pushed the Central Insurance Deposit Corporation to take over the
troubled bank and reimburse customers' deposits.
</P>
<P>
Premier Su Tseng-chang and other government officials have vowed
to fully probe the matter and to bring back Wang and his wife
from China to face justice.
