Chinese public security authorities are awaiting a signal from
Taiwan to repatriate a suspect in a bank heist that occurred
earlier this month in Taiwan who had escaped to Yunnan Province
but had been apprehended by the local police, a Taiwan business
source based in Kunming said Friday.

<P>
Lee Chih-ming, president of the Taiwan Businessmen's Association
in Kunming City in the southern Chinese province of Yunnan, told
the CNA in a telephone interview that Lee Han-yang, the driver of
an armored truck for Group 4 Securicor, a private security
company in Taiwan, had been nabbed in Kunming after he drugged
his colleague and made away with NT$56 million (US$1.72 million)
Jan. 2 in Taipei.

<P>
Lee, 45, fled to Hong Kong immediately after the heist and
reportedly sneaked to Kunming Jan. 6 to join his younger brother,
identified as Lee Chin-tsan, who reportedly once did business in
Kunming.
</P>
<P>
According to Lee Chih-ming, the Lee brothers were apprehended by
Kunming police Jan. 10 and remain in Kunming police custody.
</P>
<P>
The Kunming public security authorities are ready to repatriate
the Lee brothers based on the Kinmen Agreement upon receiving
notification from Taiwan's Criminal Investigation Bureau (CIB) ,
Lee Chih-ming said.
</P>
<P>
The NT$56 million stolen from the armored truck had not been
found and Group 4 Securicor was fined NT$1 million Jan. 4 for
mismanagement in losing the money.
</P>
<P>
Lee's wife and younger brother, who were interrogated by police
after the heist, told investigators they had no idea Lee was
considering committing such a crime.
