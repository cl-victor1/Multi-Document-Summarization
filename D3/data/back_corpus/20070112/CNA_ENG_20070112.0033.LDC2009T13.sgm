A case involving a Taiwan businessman who recently fled to China
after several enterprises belonging to his business group went
under has become a hot potato for Beijing, sources said Friday.
</P>
<P>
According to reliable sources close to the Chinese authorities in
charge of Taiwan affairs, the case of Rebar Asia Pacific Group
Chairman Wang You-theng has sent ripples into Beijing, which is
gauging how best to deal with it to minimize the impact on cross-
Taiwan Strait relations and Taiwan's political situation.
</P>
<P>
To Beijing, Wang's flight to China is not just a personal act,
but is something that might implicate Taiwan-China ties after
political figures from both the ruling and opposition camps have
aired comments on the issue, the sources said, adding that
Beijing has been assessing the matter in depth.
</P>
<P>
In addition, they pointed out, Beijing is also concerned that
some people in Taiwan are seeking to gain political leverage by
rehashing the issue and trying to get Beijing involved.
</P>
<P>
But the sources said that Beijing is expected to carefully handle
the case by taking Taiwan's public opinion into account.
</P>
<P>
According to another source familiar with the Beijing leadership,
Wang's case to Beijing is not as simple as whether or not it
should simply deport Wang. Rather, it is a complex matter that
goes beyond the legal front and that might impact cross-Taiwan
Strait links, they said.
</P>
<P>
It has turned into a thorny issue for Beijing, as Chinese
officials are concerned about public response in Taiwan if they
fail to send Wang back to Taiwan while doing their best to stay
out of the matter, the source said, adding that Beijing is also
likely to force Wang to go to a third country or area to get rid
of him.

<P>
Wang and his wife fled to China Dec. 30 via Hong Kong, just a few
days before judicial authorities prohibited the duo and many
other members of the family and Rebar executives from leaving the
country over a spate of suspected irregularities invovling the
group.
