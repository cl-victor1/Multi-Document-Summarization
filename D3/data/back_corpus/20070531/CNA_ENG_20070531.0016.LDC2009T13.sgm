KMT PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE MEETS SPEAKER ON PAIRING-UP ISSUE

Taipei,   May  31  (CNA) 05/31/07  13:07:08 (By Flor Wang)

Ma Ying-jeou,  the main opposition Kuomintang's (KMT) candidate
for the 2008 presidential election, said Thursday he is hopeful
that Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng could agree to serve
as his running mate first and then jointly work out their
campaign platform in terms of the party's basic policy line.
</P>
<P>
Ma made the remarks shortly after a meeting with Wang to talk
over the issue. Ma, a former KMT chairman who was fielded earlier
this month by the party as its presidential candidate, has
repeatedly said that he will first ask Wang to serve as his
running mate since winning the party's nomination.
</P>
<P>
Much to his disappointment, Ma said Wang disagreed with his
suggestion. Ma originally hoped that Wang could agree to his
invitation to pair up for the next presidential race.
</P>
<P>
Also speaking after the meeting, Wang said that he is willing to
cooperate with Ma in the coming presidential race but cannot
dedice whether to pair up with Ma on a presidential ticket right
now because he feels that they have to come to terms on certain
key policy issues first.
</P>
<P>
As Ma wants a definite answer before the end of May, Wang said he
has to reject Ma's invitation. Nevertheless, Wang reiterated his
promise to cooperate with Ma to ensure the party's victory in the
2008 presidential election.
