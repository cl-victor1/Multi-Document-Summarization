A delegation organized by the Taiwan-based Industrial Technology
Research Institute (ITRI) is set to head to the United States
next month to recruit talent to enhance the ITRI's research
capabilities in six major disciplines, ITRI sources reported
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The recruitment event has been held annually for the last five
years, and the delegation this year is being led by ITRI
President Johnsee Lee. The group will hold two separate sessions
of the "ITRI Forum 2007 and Career Fair" -- one in New Jersey on
June 9 and the other in Silicon Valley, California on June 14.
</P>
<P>
According to the ITRI, the focus areas of this year's recruitment
drive are "information and communications, " "advanced
manufacturing and systems," "material, chemical and
nanotechnologies," "biomedical technologies, " "electronics and
optoelectronics, " and "energy and environment".

"Skilled workers with at least five years of experience in these
fields are especially welcome," ITRI officials said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, as an added incentive, the ITRI has decided to give
researchers 25 percent of the royalties earned from any patent
for a product or technology developed by them, the officials
said.
