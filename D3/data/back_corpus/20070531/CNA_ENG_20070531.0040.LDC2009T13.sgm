<P>
Lawmakers across the party spectrum agreed Thursday to an
amendment to the Immigration Law putting an end to the
controversial interracial marriage brokerage industry.
</P>
<P>
Effective immediately, cross-border marriage brokers will be
banned from doing business and offenders  will be subject to
punishment.
</P>
<P>
To help combat international human trafficking, a special clause
was added to the law amendment allowing the issuance of a work or
residence permit to foreign victims of sexual abuse or human
trafficking during the probe into their cases in Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the law revision also eases regulations
governing residency for foreign-born Taiwanese children who have
Republic of China nationality but no household registration.
</P>
<P>
The Immigration Agency is also banned from revoking residency
permits for foreign workers involved in labor lawsuits against
their Taiwanese employers or for abused foreign spouses with a
protection warrant issued by a court.
