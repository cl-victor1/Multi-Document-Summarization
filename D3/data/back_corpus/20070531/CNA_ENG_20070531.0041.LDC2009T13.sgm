MOFA TO RESPECT EX-PRESIDENT'S DECISION ON JAPAN WAR SHRINE VISIT
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taipei, May 31 (CNA) 05/31/07  21:34:09 (By Y.F. Low)
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs will respect whatever decision
former President Lee Teng-hui makes regarding whether or not he
will visit a controversial Japanese shrine for war dead to pay
respects to his deceased brother, a ministry official said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Huang Chu-hou, chief of the MOFA's Committee on Japanese Affairs,
said he does not think a visit by Lee to the Yasukuni Shrine for
such personal reasons will affect Taiwan's relations with Japan
or with China.
</P>
<P>
Huang said it is China's "irrational belief" if it thinks a visit
by Lee to the shrine would have political repercussions.
</P>
<P>
Huang noted that Lee's current sightseeing, cultural and academic
visit to Japan has been arranged by Akita International
University President Yasushi Akashi and the Friends of Lee Teng-
hui Club in Japan.
</P>
<P>
Lee has even turned down an offer by Koh Se-kai, Taiwan's
representative to Japan, to greet him at the Narita International
Airport because Lee does not want to attach any political
implications to his Japan visit, Huang said.
</P>
<P>
Under these circumstances, there is no reason for Beijing to
protest Lee's visit to Japan as a former president.
</P>
<P>
Lee departed Wednesday for Japan for a 11-day private visit.
While interviewed by Japanese media on his arrival in Tokyo, Lee
indicated his desire to visit the Yasukuni Shrine where the name
of his deceased brother Lee Teng-chin is listed.
</P>
<P>
Asked about the issue that day, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo
Abe said the matter concerns Lee's religious freedom and that it
is up to Lee to decide whether he visits the shrine or not.
</P>
<P>
The Yasukuni Shrine is dedicated to 2.5 million soldiers who died
fighting for Japan during World War II, including more than
28,000 from Taiwan. It has drawn controversy mainly because a
group of war criminals are also enshrined there.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan's aboriginal representatives, led by Legislator Kao Chin
Su-mei, have made several trips to Japan over the past few years
to demand that the Japanese government remove the names of their
ancestors from the Yasukuni Shrine so that their spirits could be
escorted back to Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
The aboriginal representatives have also asked Japan to unlist
the names of the war criminals to make the Yasukuni Shrine a
"peace shrine."
</P>
<P>
Also Thursday, opposition Kuomintang Legislator Hung Chiu-chu and
Joanna Lei urged Lee to help the aborigines achieve the goal
since he has such close a friendship with Japan.
</P>
<P>
Claiming that the tablet of Lee's brother is enshrined in a
temple in Hsinchu County in Taiwan, Hung and Lei said they
suspect Lee's true purpose of visiting the shrine is not to pay
respects to his brother, but instead to the war criminals.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Chien Teng-shan, secretary-general of the Taiwan
Solidarity Union of which Lee is the spiritual leader, said it is
only human nature for Lee to want to pay respects to his late
brother.
</P>
<P>
Chien urged opposition politicians not to make any irrational
remarks to criticize Lee.
</P>
<P>
This is Lee's third visit to Japan since his presidency ended in
May 2000.
</P>
<P>
During the trip, Lee will be presented with the first Shinpei
Goto Prize marking the 150th anniversary of the birth of the late
Japanese colonial administrator Shinpei Goto, which is awarded to
people who have contributed to national or regional development.
</P>
<P>
Lee will also make an "oku no hosomichi" tour covering the
prefectures of Miyagi, Yamagata, Iwate, Akita and Gunma,
retracing a similar journey made by Basho in 1689 based on which
his famous work "Oku no Hosomichi," or "Narrow Road to the
Interior," was written.
