EU URGED TO HEED ISSUES RELATED TO TAIWAN STRAIT SECURITY
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  May 30 (CNA) 05/31/07  14:45:21 (By Lilian Wu)
</P>
<P>
Taiwan should urge Britain to use its considerable sway within
the European Union (EU) to bring it to heed issues  related  to
security  in the Taiwan Strait,  Taiwan's representative to
Britain, Edgar Lin, said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Lin made the remarks when he reported on bilateral relations
between Taiwan and Britain at a meeting of the Legislative Yuan's
Foreign Affairs Committee.
</P>
<P>
He noted that Britain plays a major role in the European Union
and that Taiwan should urge it to prod the EU to continue to put
pressure on Beijing instead of appeasing it and not to lift its
arms embargo against China, which was imposed shortly after the
Tiananmen Square massacre in June 1989.
</P>
<P>
Other issues the EU should heed include applying pressure on
China to democratize, improve its domestic human rights
conditions and respect religious freedom, and should continue to
review the "fallacy" of its "one China" policy following
Beijing's enactment of the Anti-Secession Law against Taiwan in
March 2005, lest it be misconstrued by China that the
international community condones its unilateral say on security
matters in the Taiwan Strait.
</P>
<P>
He said that European countries should understand that the
development of Taiwan-EU relations is not in conflict with the
development of China-EU relations and that Taiwan should show the
EU that the island is crucial to its overall trade benefits in
Asia and the Pacific and that security in the Taiwan Strait is in
the interests of countries on both sides of the Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
Lin expressed the hope that the EU can formulate a law or a due
framework to help stabilize security in the Taiwan Strait just
like the Taiwan Relations Act formulated by the United States.
</P>
<P>
He also reported that trade and cultural exchanges between Taiwan
and Britain are very close, although Britain tends to be
conservative in political exchanges due to its "one China"
policy.
</P>
<P>
He said that Britain is Taiwan's third largest trade partner in
Europe. It is estimated that bilateral trade reached US$5,29
billion in 2006, with Taiwan's exports to the Britain totalling
US$3.51 billion and its imports from Britain amounting to US$1.78
billion.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the number of Taiwan students studying in Britain
currently stands at more than 15,000, accounting for 25 percent
of the total number of Taiwan students studying overseas. Britain
has become the second largest destination of Taiwan students for
advanced studies after the United States, he added.
</P>
<P>
In political exchanges, Britain has adopted a "low-profile" and
the "gradual" approach, although parliamentary exchanges between
the two countries have borne fruit, he said.
</P>
<P>
The number of members of a pro-Taiwan group in the British
parliament has increased to 51 from 17 in May 2005. Taiwan's
legislature also established a Taiwan-British parliamentary amity
group in April 24, which now has 36 members, he added.
