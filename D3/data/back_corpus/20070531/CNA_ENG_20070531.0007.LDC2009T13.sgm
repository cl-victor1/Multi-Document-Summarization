TAICHUNG MAYOR TO ATTEND SISTER CITIES CONFERENCE IN FLORIDA
</HEADLINE>

Taichung, May 30 (CNA) 05/31/07  10:06:39 (By Han Nai-kuo)
</P>
<P>
Taichung Mayor Jason Hu will attend the 2007 annual Sister Cities
International Conference, scheduled for July 18-21 in Fort
Lauderdale, Florida.
</P>
<P>
Hu was asked by reporters Wednesday whether he will take his wife
Shirley Shao -- who lost her left forearm in a car accident in
November last year -- so that she can have a prosthetic arm
fitted for her by American experts.
</P>
<P>
The mayor said he was not sure whether his wife's health would be
up to the rigors of a trip in July.
</P>
<P>
"If I cannot take her to the United States in July, I will
probably wait until October or November to do so," he added.
</P>
<P>
According to Hu, doctors have suggested that if Shao only wants a
cosmetic prosthetic, the job can be done in Taiwan. But if she
wants an electronic arm that can function almost like a natural
one, the mayor should take her to the Rehabilitation Institute of
Chicago for more information on such devices.
</P>
<P>
The mayor acknowledged that Shao's doctors are divided on whether
she should be fitted with a cosmetic or an electronic arm, with
some saying a cosmetic arm should do just fine because the left
arm is not used frequently, while others recommended an
electronic arm.
</P>
<P>
Hu said he is still undecided about the matter, although he
expressed worry that the weight of an electronic arm might be too
heavy for his wife, who has a slender build.
</P>
<P>
Shao is still undergoing rehabilitation at present. She not only
lost her arm but also suffered serious injuries to her face Nov.
18 when the vehicle in which she was traveling overturned in
Tainan County, southern Taiwan.
