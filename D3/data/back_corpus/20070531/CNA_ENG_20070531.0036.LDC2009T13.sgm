Taiwan's first bottle of potable water collected from great
depths hit the market Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Pacific Marine Biotech Corp., which produces the 100 percent
"cool" water, said the water was collected from a depth of 700
meters from the Chihsintan area in Hualien County, eastern
Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Company officials said water collected from such depths is free
from pollution and offers consumers a new drinking water option.
</P>
<P>
In addition to deep sea water drinks, the company is also
planning to develop a series of cosmetic products made with the
water.
</P>
<P>
Lucky Cement Corp. began to invest in the company about four
years ago and has pumped in NT$500 million (US$15.15 million) for
equipment. It is estimated that the annual turnover could reach
NT$1 billion.
