ROC EMBASSIES IN LATIN AMERICA REPLACE NAME PLATES
</HEADLINE>

Panama City, March 25 (CNA) 03/25/07  15:37:43 (By Ramon Huang

<P>
Many of the Republic of China embassies in Latin America have had
their brass name plates changed to include the word "Taiwan" in
parenthesis, underscoring the identity of their country of origin
and avoiding confusion with their Chinese counterparts.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan maintains formal diplomatic relations with a total of 12
countries in Central and South America and the Caribbean. Only a
few of its embassies in the regions have not yet had their brass
name plates replaced. Among these are embassies in the Dominican
Republic and Costa Rica.
</P>
<P>
Besides ROC embassies,  affiliated  agencies,  such as the
representative offices of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, the
Ministry of National Defense and the Government Information
Office, have also had their name plates changed to include the
word "Taiwan."
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, the new name plates are not completely identical in
content or specification: some embassy name plates bear the ROC's
national emblem, several others do not.
</P>
<P>
The ROC Embassy in Nicaragua has a national emblem on its new
name plate, Ambassador Hung Ming-ta told CNA in a telephone
interview. He added that the emblem on the new plate is even
larger than that on the old one. The new name plates of the
embassies in Guatemala, El Salvador and Belize also carry the
ROC's national emblem.
</P>
<P>
In contrast, the national emblem has been omitted from the new
name plates of the embassies in Panama and Paraguay.
</P>
<P>
According to ROC Ambassador to Paraguay David C. Y. Hu, the new
name plates were sent to embassies in the regions by government
authorities in Taipei. Hu said he didn't know why there are
discrepancies between the content of embassy name plates in
different countries.
</P>
<P>
The new name plate of the ROC Embassy in Panama has the word
"Taiwan" inserted in parenthesis between the words "the Republic
of China" and "Embassy" in both of its Chinese and Spanish
titles, but the ROC national emblem is omitted.
</P>
<P>
ROC Ambassador to Panama Hou Ping-fu said the replacement of the
embassy name plate has nothing to do with "name rectification"
nor is it a move of desinicization.
</P>
<P>
The insertion of the word "Taiwan" is only aimed at making the
embassy more identifiable to foreigners and preventing them from
perceiving the Republic of China Embassy as that of the People's
Republic of China -- China's official title, Hou added.
