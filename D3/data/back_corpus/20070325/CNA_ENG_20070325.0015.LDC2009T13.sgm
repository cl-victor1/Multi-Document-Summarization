A name plaque for the Kaohsiung City Cultural Center has been
installed above the main entrance of the center Sunday as part of
the local government's promotion of the national government's
name-change campaign to remove references to the late president
Chiang Kai-shek from local place names.
</P>
<P>
The move came after local government decided March 13 to rename
the cultural center and dismantle Chiang's statue at the
Kaohsiung Chiang Kai-shek Cultural Center despite protests from
opponents.
</P>
<P>
According to an official with the Kaohsiung City' Cultural
Affairs Bureau, the space cleared after tearing down the statue
of Chiang  will be used for displaying  art installations  after
refurnishing and decoration has been completed.
