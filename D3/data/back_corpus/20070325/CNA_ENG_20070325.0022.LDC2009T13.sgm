Fund-raising for the establishment of the Commercial Development
Research Institute has nearly succeeded in achieving its goal of
raising NT$200 million (US$6 million), Minister of Economic
Affairs Steve Chen said.

According to the Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) , the
government will invest around 51 percent of the establishment
fund of the research institute, and the other 49 percent will
come from the private sector. Chen said before the weekend that
around NT$190 million has been gathered.

He said benefactors will meet over the coming week to discuss the
act of endowment, but the institute will not be able to start
functioning in March as planned.

Chen had said that the institute, in its initial stage, will
contain three research divisions and an incubation center. The
three research divisions will specialize  respectively  in
commercial development and social impact, consumption patterns
and lifestyles, and international development in commerce.
Another two research divisions on business models innovation and
commercial technology applications will follow in the third year.

As for the location, Chen said in its primary stage the institute

leased office space before it acquires its own building.
