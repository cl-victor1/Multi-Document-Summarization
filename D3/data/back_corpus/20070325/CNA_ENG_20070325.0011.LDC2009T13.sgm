FOREIGN MINISTER'S ST. LUCIA VISIT CONDUCIVE TO BILATERAL TIES:
MOFA
</HEADLINE>

Taipei, March 25 (CNA) 03/25/07  17:09:29 (By Luis Huang)

The ongoing visit to St. Lucia by a Taiwan delegation headed by
Minister of Foreign Affairs James Huang will be conducive to the
development of relations between the two countries, Ministry of
Foreign Affairs (MOFA) spokesman Wang Chien-yeh said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
According to the spokesman,  Huang and his delegation are
receiving high-profile treatment from the St. Lucian government,
and are exchanging views on issues of mutual concern with
government officials of the southern Caribbean state in a very
positive atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
At present St. Lucia maintains diplomatic ties with China, but
after Primer Minister John Compton, considered to be pro-Taiwan
in his political stance, came to power again following his
party's victory in last December's  general elections,  it was
widely speculated that Taiwan-St. Lucia diplomatic relations
would be reestablished.
</P>
<P>
Following a secret visit to St. Lucia in mid-December when
Comptom assumed his post, Huang arrived in the Caribbean nation
Mar. 23 and held extensive talks with Compton and other senior
officials, triggering a formal protest from the Chinese Embassy
in Castries, St. Lucia's capital.
</P>
<P>
Asked when the two nations will re-establish diplomatic links,
Wang said both parties are looking forward to strengthening
bilateral cooperation in various fields, but he added that Taiwan
will respect whatever decision the St. Lucian government will
make on future development of bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
According to diplomatic sources, the two sides of the Taiwan
Strait have engaged in a diplomatic battle since Compton staged a
comeback last December. As Taiwan cannot afford the so-called
"checkbook diplomacy", the sources said the nation can only adopt
a pragmatic strategy to forge relations with St. Lucia by
discussing substantive cooperation projects between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
At a time that Taiwan is facing a quite difficult diplomatic
situation, St. Lucia showed a good-will gesture to Taiwan by
extending an invitation to the nation's foreign minister, the
sources said, adding that such a move has been intolerable to
China even though substantive diplomatic ties will not
necessarily be forged between Taiwan and St. Lucia.
</P>
<P>
According to foreign wire service reports, St. Lucia's Foreign
Ministry announced Friday that it has begun talks with the
Taiwanese delegation to discuss "cooperation and mutual
interests, " which triggered a protest from the Chinese Embassy.
</P>
<P>
The reports also quoted Huang as having told reporters that he
intended to discuss relations between Taiwan and St. Lucia with
Compton, describing the 82 -year-old leader as "our dear old
friend."
</P>
<P>
Taiwan established diplomatic relations with Saint Lucia in 1984
when Compton was prime minister, but when former Prime Minister
Kenny Anthony came to power in 1997, diplomatic recognition was
soon switched from Taipei to Beijing.
