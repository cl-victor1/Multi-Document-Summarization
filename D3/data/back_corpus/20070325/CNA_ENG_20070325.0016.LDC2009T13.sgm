A main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) youth group said Sunday that
it hopes to host a public debate April 4 for the two candidates
contending for the party's top post to expound on their campaign
platforms.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a news conference held at National Taiwan University,
initiators of the "Youth Reform Forum", including Chen Huan-yu,
Chen Ke-wei and Wang Cheng, called on former KMT acting Chairman
Wu Poh-hsiung and Legislator Hung Hsiu-chu to take part in the
proposed debate.
</P>
<P>
Chen said the group decided to host the debate because the two
candidates for the KMT chairmanship by-election slated for April
7 have not put forward any constructive ideas on the party's
future development and reform.
</P>
<P>
In addition to youth representatives and pundits from different
sectors, former KMT Chairman Ma Ying-jeou and Legislative Yuan
Speaker Wang Jin-pyng will also be invited to question the
candidates during the debate in order to inspire party members to
rationally discuss the direction of the party's future
development.
</P>
<P>
The by-election was made necessary by Ma's resignation as KMT
chairman Feb. 13 immediately following his indictment on
corruption charges for the alleged misuse of a special
discretionary allowance fund during his two terms as Taipei mayor
from 1998 to 2006. Ma simultaneously announced that he will run
in the 2008 presidential election.
