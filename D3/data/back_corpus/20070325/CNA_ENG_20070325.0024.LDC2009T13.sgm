Commenting on the election of a new Hong Kong leader, the
Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) Sunday urged China to implement
universal suffrage in Hong Kong soon.
</P>
<P>
Calling the Hong Kong election asmall-circleone, under birdcage
democracy, a MAC news release said the process and result of the
election were subject to intervention and manipulation by
Beijing, as revealed by media reports during the election.
</P>
<P>
This makes one think that the promise of 'Hong Kong people
running Hong Kong, ' and 'Hong Kong enjoying a high degree of
autonomy' is just empty words,the news release said.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, it praises the efforts by Hong Kong people to
support the pro-democracy camp candidate's bid to become eligible
for the race, and the efforts by the camp to oblige candidates to
report to the citizens their political platforms.All these
amounted to one more step forward on Hong Kong's road to
democracy,the MAC said.
