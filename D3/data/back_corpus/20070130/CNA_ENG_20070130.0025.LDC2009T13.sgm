DPP SEEKS TO COOPERATE WITH TSU IN LEGISLATIVE ELECTION
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  Jan. 30 (CNA) 01/30/07  18:02:29 (By Luis Huang)

Ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) Chairman Yu Shyi-kun
said Tuesday that the DPP will seek to cooperate with its ally --
the Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU) -- in fielding candidates for
the year-end legislative election.
</P>
<P>
"Our basic idea is that the two parties can jointly nominate the
most promising candidates for the next legislative election based
upon public opinion survey results," Yu told reporters while
visiting the DPP Hualien County Council caucus.
</P>
<P>
Describing the DPP and the TSU as "brothers in a family," Yu said
that only through mutual cooperation can the two parties win the
upcoming legislative election. Consequently, the DPP will -- with
maximum sincerity and goodwill -- discuss the proposal with the
TSU, he said.
</P>
<P>
Yu said that he decided to meet with new TSU Chairman Huang Kun-
huei to exchange views on the legislative election issue when
Huang assumed his post last Friday.
</P>
<P>
As for the TSU's intention to adopt a center-left line, Yu
stressed that as a political party, the TSU is autonomous, so its
party affairs, development strategy and political line should be
respected.
</P>
<P>
Claiming that the TSU's political ideals and goals are identical
with those of the DPP, Yu voiced the hope that for Taiwan's
future the two parties will cooperate closely in the next
legislative election.
</P>
<P>
The legislative election at the end of this year will use a
"single-member constituency, two-vote system, " with the number
of legislators slashed from 225 to 113 and their terms extended
from three years to four. Many incumbent legislators from the
ruling and opposition parties may lose their seats, but the new
system will be decidedly less favorable to candidates of smaller
political parties.
