MAC

Taipei,  Jan. 30 (CNA) 01/30/07  12:32:26 (By Sofia Wu)

Negotiations between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait for
Taiwan's planned full opening to Chinese tourists have proceeded
smoothly but have yet to reach the concluding stage, a Mainland
Affairs Council (MAC) official said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The official was responding to a recent report by China's
official Xinhua News Agency that quasi-official intermediary
bodies from the two sides of the Taiwan Strait are holding a
fourth round of technical talks on Taiwan's planned opening to
Chinese tourists.
</P>
<P>
According to the MAC official, executives from Taipei's Taiwan
Strait Tourism Association and the Beijing-based Cross-Strait
Tourism Exchange Association had indeed met in a third area
recently to discuss the planned tourism opening measure.
</P>
<P>
"While the talks have proceeded smoothly, the two sides have not
yet reached consensus on certain critical points," the official
said, adding that the MAC -- Taiwan's top China policy planning
agency -- will brief the press whenever a major breakthrough or
any concrete result is achieved.
</P>
<P>
The official refrained from revealing what issues the two sides
remain at odds over and instead reiterated that opening the door
to Chinese tourists is the government's established policy.
</P>
<P>
"We'll remain in touch with China in the hopes that the two sides
come to terms in the near future," the official added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile,  MAC commissioners met Monday to review China's
internal situation and its policy and strategies toward Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
MAC commissioners concluded that China's basic policy tone toward
Taiwan's government remains unchanged while it continues to step
up its efforts to court the Taiwan people's favor.
</P>
<P>
They predicted that China will increase cross-strait civilian
interaction this year by organizing large-scale trade fairs,
academic forums and religious activities, targeting mainly women,
youths and labor union members.
</P>
<P>
China will also make bids to expand exchanges with Taiwan's city
and county governments by forging cooperative platforms in
specific fields, such as tourism and agriculture, MAC
commissioners said.
</P>
<P>
In related news, Government Information Office Minister Cheng
Wen-tsang said Monday that Taiwan has come a long way towards
democracy and press freedom and will never backtrack.
</P>
<P>
Cheng made the remarks while meeting with Robert Menar, founder
and secretary- general of Reporters without Borders, who received
the 2006 Asia Democracy &amp; Human Rights Award in Taipei Sunday
on behalf of the Paris-based organization also known as Reporters
sans Frontieres (RSF). The award was presented by the Taiwan
Foundation for Democracy.
</P>
<P>
Cheng lauded the RSF for its ardent and undaunting efforts to
protect journalists in the line of duty and to promote freedom of
the press since its inauguration in 1985.
</P>
<P>
Noting that democracy and freedom of the press are "twins," Cheng
said an extremely vibrant free press has been one of the most
noteworthy characteristics of Taiwan's young democracy.
</P>
<P>
Cheng further said that every incident involving freedom of the
press or freedom of speech has consistently  caused extensive
discussion in local society. Whenever international journalistic
organizations, such as RSF or Freedom House, have commented on
Taiwan-related events, Cheng said, the government has invariably
engaged in self-reflection on whether it has done enough to
protect freedom of the press.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, he continued, the government has become more concerned
than ever about China's attitude toward press freedom because "a
country's policy on the freedom of the press usually embodies its
openness to change."
</P>
<P>
At present, Cheng said, China still only allows very limited
press freedom, with most of its media outlets subject to state
control and stringent censorship.
</P>
<P>
In 2006, Cheng said, four popular U.S. Internet access portals or
search engines -- Yahoo! , Google, MSN and CISCO -- had to abide
by Beijing's "inappropriate requirements." As a matter of fact,
he added, China boasts the world's largest Internet police force.
</P>
<P>
Stressing that freedom of speech and freedom of the press are
critical to democratic development, Cheng said he keenly hopes
that the RSF and new democracies in Asia can pay more attention
and show more concern toward China's freedom of expression.
</P>
<P>
"If we can sow the seeds of press freedom in China, then
democracy will eventually bloom and thrive there," he added.
