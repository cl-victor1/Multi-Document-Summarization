With last year's target for new private investment achieved, the
government has set a goal 11.44 percent higher for this year for
a total of around NT$1 trillion (US$30.3 billion), Ministry of
Economic Affairs (MOEA) officials said Tuesday.

According to tallies released by the MOEA, the ministry's goal of
attracting NT$903.2 billion (US$27.3 billion)  in new private
investment projects in 2006 was fulfilled with a 102.7-percent
achievement rate, or a total of NT$927.6 billion (US$28.1
billion) in 1,689 projects.

The MOEA held a meeting that day on soliciting investment.
Officials briefed Economics Minister Chen Ruey-long and said
Taiwan's Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) industry last year
generated NT$814 million (US$24.6 million) in production value, a
15.3 percent growth from 2005.

The MOEA is encouraging enterprises  to develop self-owned
technologies, as well as soliciting foreign companies to lend
cooperation on "proof of concept" or set up R&amp;D centers in
Taiwan, the officials said.

Intelligent robotics is another field the government is paying
particular attention to, the officials said, adding that as of
the fourth quarter of last year, 16 companies had invested nearly
NT$500 million in robot applications ranging from child care to
wireless transmission modules. Domestic private investment in the
field this year is estimated to reach NT$2.9 billion, the
officials said.
