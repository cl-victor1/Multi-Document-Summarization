The state-run Chinese Petroleum Corp. (CPC) announced Tuesday
that it would raise gasoline prices by NT$0.6 per liter and the
price of diesel by NT$0.7 per liter from midnight that day.
</P>
<P>
According to a CPC official, it will be the first raise since the
company formally implemented a floating oil-pricing mechanism
earlier this month to better reflect fluctuations in crude oil
prices on the international market.
</P>
<P>
With the adjustment, the price of 92 octane unleaded will rise to
NT$25 per liter, while that of 95 octane unleaded will be NT$25.7
and that of 98 octane unleaded will be NT$27.2, the official
said.
</P>
<P>
The price of regular diesel will be up to NT$21.3 per liter,
while that of super diesel will be NT$21.8 per liter and fuel oil
price will increase to NT$14,593 per kiloliter, the official went
on.
</P>
<P>
The upward adjustment  of oil prices reflects  a hike in
international crude oil prices due to growing demand, the
official explained.
</P>
<P>
The CPC began to implement a floating price system for oil Jan. 3
to better reflect the company's costs. The new pricing system is
based on fluctuations in the price of West Texas Intermediate
crude traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
