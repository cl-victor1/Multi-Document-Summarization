CSMU INTRODUCES 'FREE RADICAL DETECTION PLATFORM'

Chung Shan Medical University (CSMU) has introduced a new "free
radical detection platform" into clinical practice, to determine
the probability of a patient's incidence of certain diseases by
measuring the amount of free radicals in the body, sources at the
Taichung-based university said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The detection process requires only three cc of blood and the
results are available within 10 minutes, they said, adding that
if the level of radicals exceeds a threshold amount, the patient
is more susceptible to some types of cancer, cardiovascular
diseases, and allergies.
</P>
<P>
CSMU Vice President Wang Chin-kun explained that radicals such as
total free radicals, superoxide anion radical (O2), hydroxyl
radical (OH) and hydroperoxyl radical (HO2) are known threats to
human health.
</P>
<P>
The radicals generally enter the body from expired foods,
scorched meat and food products that have pesticide residuals,
while fresh vegetables are proven effective in neutralizing
radicals. Patients are encouraged, therefore, to eat fresh
vegetables daily to help lower their free radical burden, Wang
noted.
</P>
<P>
However, if patients continue to eat an unbalanced diet, these
levels would continue rise and likely cause disease, he added.
</P>
<P>
According to previous research, the standard range of total free
radicals is 60,000 per 10 seconds, and of superoxide anion
radicals is 20,000 per 10 seconds. The standard is yet to be
formulated for the hydroxyl radical that is associated with the
occurrence of many cancers. Higher levels spell a greater
incidence of disease.
</P>
<P>
The detection procedure for radicals is a precautionary measure,
Wang said. Through the process, the patients can learn how close
they are to hazardous levels and make adjustments to their
dietary habits to prevent development of some diseases.
