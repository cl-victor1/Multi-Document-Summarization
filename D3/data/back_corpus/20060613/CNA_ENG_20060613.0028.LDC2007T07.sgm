Taipei,  June 13 (CNA) (By Elizabeth Hsu)
</P>
<P>
The Taipei City Government designated the Chihai residence of the late
President Chiang Chin-kuo in suburban Taipei as a historical site
Tuesday, enabling the preservation of the 1960s building, which is on
military property.
</P>
<P>
The residence will be opened to the public after its restoration,
officials of the City Department of Cultural Affairs (CDCA) said.
</P>
<P>
The Chihai Residence, located close to Navy headquarters in northern
Taipei, was being used by the Navy to house foreign guests before
Chiang moved in at the beginning of his term as minister of defense in
1969.
</P>
<P>
The son of late President Chiang Kai-shek lived there until his death
in 1988. During that period, many key political decisions were made
there.
</P>
<P>
Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou frequently set foot in the building during
his service as Chiang's English secretary.
</P>
<P>
The simplicity of furnishings in the western-style residence reflects
the modesty of its former inhabitants. On the first floor, there was
space for meetings with foreign quests or family reunions, while the
second floor had Chiang's office and several bedrooms, according to
the CDCA.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the Chihai residence, the home of the late senior
adviser to the president, Sun Yun-hsuan, on Chungchin South Road in
downtown Taipei, and the old National Taiwan Science Education Center
(built in 1956) located in Nanhai park were also designated as
historical sites in the capital city.
