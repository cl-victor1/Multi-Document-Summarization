Aboriginal females in Taiwan consume more sodium on average than
their Taiwanese and Hakka counterparts do, according to the
results of a survey released Friday by the Taoyuan County
government.
</P>
<P>
The survey, conducted by National Taiwan University at the
commission of the Taoyuan County Department of Health over the
past one year, found that aboriginal females in Taoyuan County
have an average daily sodium intake of 5,269 mg, or about 1.48
times higher than the average daily sodium intake of all females
in Taiwan, which stands at 3,569 mg.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan's female population is mostly comprised of Taiwanese,
Chinese from mainland China, Hakka, and a relatively smaller
number of aborigines. The number of aboriginal people in the
northern county of Taoyuan totals slightly over 50,000, with
about half of them being females.

Lin Hsueh-jung, director of the Taoyuan County Department of
Health, said sodium is one of the essential elements needed by
the human body, but an excessive intake of it could negatively
affect a person's health, including the development of chronic
high blood pressure.
</P>
<P>
Lin quoted nutritionists as suggesting that seasonings, including
salt, soy sauce and MSG, be judiciously used, while processed
foods, including dried noodles, ready-to-serve noodles, preserved
fruits and canned foods, should not be consumed, in order to
avoid excessive intakes of sodium.
</P>
<P>
The poll of nearly 2,000 people aged between 19-64 years old in
Taoyuan County also found that males in the county have an
average daily sodium intake of 5,000 mg, which is 1.3 times
higher than that of other males around the country.
</P>
<P>
A total of 1,993 valid samples were collected in the poll, which
has a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points.
