Four men were indicted Thursday by Taipei prosecutors on charges
of illegally brokering Taiwanese students to study in China and
the prosecutors asked that they be given heavier punishments for
acting as middle men.
</P>
<P>
The four men were charged with violating the Statute Governing
the Relations Between the People of the Taiwan Area and the
Mainland Area, and could be subject to prison terms of no more
than one year, the prosecutor in charge of the case said.
</P>
<P>
According to the indictment, two men surnamed Yeh and Sun who ran
companies in Taipei, and two clerks surnamed Lin and Her,
illegally recruited local students through the Internet and
through local newspspers to study in China-based universities,
senior high schools and post-graduate institutes during the
2002-2005 period.
</P>
<P>
During the three years, Yeh and Sun also held unlawful seminars
in the Taipei and Hsinchu areas to attract Taiwanese students by
providing auxiliary classes to help them prepare for entrance
examinations to Chinese universities.
</P>
<P>
In March 2003, the four men flew with 11 Taiwanese students to
Beijing, where they took part in a special pre-entrance
examination course at the China Politics and Law University. Each
student had to pay NT$200,000-NT$250,000 for the trip and the
10-day course.
</P>
<P>
In March that same year, Lin accompanied the 11 Taiwanese
students to Hong Kong, where they took the university entrance
examination for its economics and law school. Nine of them were
admitted.
</P>
<P>
According to the prosecutors, private individuals, groups and
institutions are banned from recruiting or brokering local
students for Chinese educational institutes under the terms of
the Statute Governing the Relations Between the People of the
Taiwan Area and the Mainland Area.
