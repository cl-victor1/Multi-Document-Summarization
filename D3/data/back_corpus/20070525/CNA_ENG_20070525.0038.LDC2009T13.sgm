TAIWAN TO BAN WHALE SHARK FISHING NEXT YEAR: COA
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taipei, May 25 (CNA) 05/25/07  21:18:08 (By Lilian Wu)
</P>
<P>
Taiwan will ban fishing for whale sharks, the largest living fish
species, from next year, the Fisheries Administration under the
Council of Agriculture (COA) announced Friday.
</P>
<P>
Fisheries Administration Director Hsieh Ta-wen said the year's
quota of 30 whale sharks was reached March 27 and that no more
fishing will be allowed from March 27 till December 31.
</P>
<P>
Any stockpiled whale shark meat must be sold within three months,
meaning that from June 27, no more selling of whale shark meat
will be allowed.
</P>
<P>
Starting from next year, the fishing, selling, importing and
exporting of whale sharks will be banned completely, he added.
</P>
<P>
The whale shark, the gentle giant of the ocean, is found in
tropical and warm oceans and live in the open sea. The species is
called the tofu shark locally because its delicate meat is
purported to taste like tofu.
</P>
<P>
The shark, believed to have originated about 60 million years
ago, can grow up to 20 meters in length and can weigh up to 30
tons. It is considered a delicacy in many Southeast Asian
countries.
</P>
<P>
Hsieh said 12 out of this year's 30 whale sharks were caught in
fixed nets this year and were released. The Fisheries
Administration has also presented NT$3.47 million (US$104,200) in
cash to fishermen for their cooperation in releasing the fish.
</P>
<P>
The released sharks were fitted with satellite tracking devices
to help track their migration routes and provide more information
about their ecology.
</P>
<P>
If more whale sharks are accidentally trapped in the fixed nets,
Hsieh instructed fishermen to report the catch immediately and
apply for a cash reward for not killing them. Those sharks will
also be fitted with satellite tracking devices.
</P>
<P>
Fisheries officials also noted that two whale sharks accidentally
caught off Hualien in eastern Taiwan will be sent to an aquarium
in the state of Georgia in the United States early next month for
teaching, research and display purposes.
</P>
<P>
The aquarium purchased two whale sharks from Taiwan in 2005 and
2006, respectively, but one of them died earlier this year of
peritonitis.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, fishermen in three counties who mainly fish for whale
sharks were disgruntled about the government ban, disputing
expert opinion that the great fish are on the brink of extinction
and complaining that a complete ban will jeopardize their
livelihoods.
</P>
<P>
They noted that the annual quota has continued to dwindle from 80
in the past to 60 in 2006 and 30 this year in the face of global
outrage that the endangered animals are still being hunted.
</P>
<P>
Huang  Juei-yueh,  president  of  the  Hualien  Fishermen's
Association, who runs fixed net operations, said the fixed net
operators have in recent years helped aquariums with
conservation, research, education and tourism work, which he said
is more valuable in terms of diplomacy and conservation than
satisfying the insatiable appetites of unscrupulous diners.
