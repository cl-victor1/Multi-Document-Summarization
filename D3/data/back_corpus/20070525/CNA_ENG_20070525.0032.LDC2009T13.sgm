Taipei, May 25 (CNA) 05/25/07  19:27:09 (By Flor Wang)

Three Taiwanese have been turned over to the prosecution
authorities  after being caught  selling  fake or substandard
products on a local auction web site, police officers of the
Criminal Investigation Bureau announced Friday.
</P>
<P>
The three suspects, identified only by their surnames of Hu, Chen
and Yeh, were handed over to the Panchiao Prosecutor's Office a
day earlier for investigation on charges of infringement of the
Trademark Law.
</P>
<P>
The detentions came after police, acting on tip-offs provided by
online buyers who claimed to have been cheated, raided their
offices and warehouses in Taipei County, Changhua County and
Yunlin County, where more than 1,000 items of fake brand name
goods fabricated in China were stored.
</P>
<P>
Police said the products the three men auctioned on local web
sites -- mainly memory chips, batteries and cell phone components
-- were counterfeits neatly packaged and sold at unfairly low
prices.
</P>
<P>
The initial probe also found that the three suspects also headed
to China together, where they purchased pirated Sony, Nokia,
Motorola and Samsung products.
</P>
<P>
The men sold the fake products in their own stores and posted ads
on local auction web sites, with orders transferred to China,
from where the goods were delivered via postal delivery. They
earned a commission for each order they placed with Chinese
providers.
