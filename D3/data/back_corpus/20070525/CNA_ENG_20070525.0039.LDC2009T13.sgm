Apart from some outlying islands, water supplies on Taiwan proper
will remain secure at least until the end of June, officials of
the Water Resources Agency (WRA) under the Ministry of Economic
Affairs said Friday.
</P>
<P>
As the Shihmen reservoir, the major provider for northern Taiwan,
as well as reservoirs in central Taiwan, are still at between 60
percent and 90 percent capacity, supplies on Taiwan proper are
assured in principle until the end of June, the WRA officials
said.
</P>
<P>
Although the Tsengwen reservoir, the main supplier for southern
Taiwan, is only at 13 percent capacity, the officials said that
the other providers in the region still have considerable
reserves of water and predicted that supplies in the region will
remain stable.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, supplies on the outlying islands are quite tight
because of the current dry season.
</P>
<P>
The Nankang area of the island of Matsu has had to begin water
rationing in recent weeks, while reduced water pressure has been
put in place on the island of Kinmen, according to WRA officials.
