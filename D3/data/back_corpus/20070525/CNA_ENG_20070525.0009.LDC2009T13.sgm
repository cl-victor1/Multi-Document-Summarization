A maritime anti-hijack drill is scheduled to be held at the
eastern fishing port of Suao Sunday to hone the coast guard's
response capabilities to cope with the changing coastal crime
situation, the Coast Guard Administration (CGA) reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The "Haian Drill" is mainly aimed at examining the coast guard's
capability in dealing with fishing boat hijacks, as two Taiwan
fishing boats had been hijacked by mainland Chinese fishermen
within the past two months, CGA officials said.

<P>
In late April, a Nanfangao, Yilan-registered fishing boat, the
"Yu Chang 66, " was hijacked by a Chinese deckhand and forced to
sail for waters off the coast of Fujian Province in China, while
earlier this month, another Nanfangao- registered fishing boat,
the "Chin Fu Yu, " was also hijacked and forced to sail to the
Fujian coast, the CGA officials said, adding that both vessels
were able to return to Taiwan and that none of the crew members
were hurt in the incidents.
</P>
<P>
Sunday's drill is also aimed at honing the coast guard's
contingency combat readiness and response capabilities to handle
other undesirable situations, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
Airborne operations are also expected to be part of the drill,
which will be open to the public to watch, the officials said.
