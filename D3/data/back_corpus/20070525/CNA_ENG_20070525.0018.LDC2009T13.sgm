PRESIDENT SOLICITING QUALIFIED PEOPLE FOR GRAND JUSTICE SEATS
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  May  25  (CNA) 05/25/07  15:33:00 (By Lilian Wu)

<P>
President Chen Shui-bian is currently soliciting qualified people
to fill eight seats on the Council of Grand Justices that are set
to be vacated at the end of September, Vice President Annette Lu
said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Lu made the remarks on the sidelines of a seminar on gender
education held at Shih Hsin University.
</P>
<P>
Asked about reports that the president is planning to nominate
former Vice Premier Tsai Ing-wen as a grand justice, Lu only said
that there are eight seats to be filled and that the president is
soliciting qualified people for them.
</P>
<P>
Lu did not answer directly when asked if Tsai, who holds a
doctoral degree in law and who has served as Mainland Affairs
Council chairwoman 2000-2004, is fit to serve as a grand justice,
saying instead that "women can serve as presidents, let alone as
grand justices."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a private group dedicated to the screening of grand
justice nominees urged the president to present a list of grand
justice nominees early for public scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
Huang Hsiu-duan, a spokeswoman of an alliance formed in 2003 by
Taipei Society, Taiwan Law Society, Taiwan Association for Human
Rights, Taiwan Bar Association, Taipei Bar Association and the
Judicial Reform Foundation, said that the alliance will start its
screening and assessment mechanism.
</P>
<P>
Huang pointed out that President Chen presented a list of eight
grand justice nominees long before their time was due four years
ago. However, recently, the public has been pre-occupied with the
bitterly contested party primaries for the year-end legislative
elections and the controversy surrounding the re-naming of the
Chiang Kai-shek Memorial Hall and "simply has forgotten about the
matter," she added.
</P>
<P>
With the current legislative session due to end this month and
the next session not scheduled to begin until September, she
expressed concern that there may not be enough time for the
legislators to review the grand justice nominees for approval.
</P>
<P>
"If the president doesn't nominate grand justices soon, then
there will only be seven grand justices left after September,
which may hamper the operations of the Judicial Yuan," Huang
said.
</P>
<P>
Among the seats on the Council of Grand Justices that President
Chen nominated in 2003, eight of them, including the president
and the vice president of the Judicial Yuan, are for four-year
terms, while the remainder are for eight-year terms.
