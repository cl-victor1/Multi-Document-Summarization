A civil engineering professor of National Taiwan University (NTU)
was awarded the title of academician by the Austrian Academy of
Sciences in Vienna Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Yang,  who is also secretary-general  of the Institute of
Engineering Education Taiwan, was granted the title by the
academy's president, Peter Schuster, becoming the first Taiwanese
scholar to have earned the honor.
</P>
<P>
The academy's former president, Herbert Mang, recommended Yang on
the strength of his research papers on the theory of spatial
structure stability and vibration of high speed railway bridges,
which have received a lot of attention and earned him respect in
the international academic community.
</P>
<P>
Yang told a CNA reporter that the Austrian Academy of Sciences
has been very active in promoting academic exchanges with Taiwan,
even though Taiwan has limited understanding of the German
speaking academic community.
</P>
<P>
Yang added that the academy signed agreements on cooperation with
Taiwan's Academia Sinica and the National Science Council last
year to further promote bilateral academic interaction.
</P>
<P>
The academy, established in 1847, is similar to Taiwan's Academia
Sinica in status and function. It encompasses 65 research
institutes and many of its academicians are Nobel laureates.
</P>
<P>
Among the academy's 24 academicians selected this year, Yang is
the only scholar chosen from Asia, while the rest are mainly from
Europe.
