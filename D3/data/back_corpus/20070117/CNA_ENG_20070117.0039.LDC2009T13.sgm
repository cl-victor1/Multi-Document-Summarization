technology development.

After listening to the report, Su said the government will do its
utmost  to budget more funds for technological  research  and
developmentet. At the same time, Su said he hopes the NSC can
work to attract more non-governmental investment in R&amp;D in

The 2007-2010 White Paper on Science and Technology submitted by

Competitiveness Index released in May 2006 by the Switzerland-
based Institute for Management Development (IMD) , Su said,
Taiwan ranked 4th in technology infrastructure, and 5th in
science infrastructure, indicating that Taiwan performs faily
well in terms of its science and technology infrastructure.

The NSC outlined seven technology development strategies in the
white paper to help match the developed countries' innovation
abilities and living standards by 2015.

Su urged all departments to cooperate closely and enhance their
coordination and integration in order to derive the utmost
benefit from scarce resources and to fulfill all of the
objectives set forth in the white paper.
