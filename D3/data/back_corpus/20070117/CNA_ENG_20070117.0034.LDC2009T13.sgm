UNDECLARED AGARWOOD CHIPS IMPORT SEIZED AT TAICHUNG PORT

Taichung County,  Jan. 17 (CNA) 01/17/07  20:01:06 (By Hsan Nai-

Customs officials at the Taichung port seized 160 bags of
undeclared agarwood chips from a container on a cargo ship from
Indonesia Wednesday and will handle the case according to the
Customs Anti-Smuggling Act.
</P>
<P>
A mobile unit of the Taichung Customs Office conducted the search
after they found that the weight of one of the containers on the
Singapore-registered cargo ship, Wan Hai 206, was incompatible
with the goods declared on a customs clearance form.
</P>
<P>
The officials examined the 20-foot container and found 4,800 kg
of agarwood chips, of which 1,650 kg in 160 bags with an import
value of NT$2 million was undeclared.
</P>
<P>
Agarwood products are subjected to trade controls under the
Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild
Flora and Fauna (CITES).
</P>
<P>
Indonesia and Malaysia are the main sources of agarwood species
in international trade.
</P>
<P>
The dark and heavy wood is a resinous, fragrant and highly
valuable heartwood produced by Aquilaria malaccensis and other
species of the tree genus Aquilaria. Its Chinese name is "chen
hsiang", which means "wood that sinks."
</P>
<P>
Agarwood incense is used in religious ceremonies by Buddhists,
Hindus and Muslims. In Taiwan, agarwood is an aromatic ingredient
in Chu-yeh Ching and Vo Ka Py wine.
</P>
<P>
It is believed that the fragrant resin that permeates the
heartwood of some Aquilaria trees is produced as a response to
wounding or a fungal infection. It is this resinous wood, or
'agarwood', that is sought.
</P>
<P>
As external signs of the presence of agarwood are not always
obvious, Aquilaria trees are often cut down indiscriminately in
the search for those containing agarwood.
</P>
<P>
The high value of agarwood products has stimulated illegal
harvest and trade. CITES has listed six Aquilaria species as
"endangered" because of overexploitation.
</P>
<P>
Countries exporting or re-exporting Aquilaria Malaccensis wood
and products must obtain CITES export permits, while countries
importing or re-exporting such products are required to submit
data for the CITES annual report.
