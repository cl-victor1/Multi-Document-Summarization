Kaohsiung Mayor Chen Chu paid a visit Tuesday to her counterpart
in Turin City, Italy to exchange views and opinions on city
infrastructure development and bilateral exchanges.

Chen, heading a governmental delegation, arrived in the northern
Italian city Sunday for a visit aimed at promoting Kaohsiung's
bid for the right to host the 2011 Universiade -- also known as
the World University Games. She visited Mayor Sergio Chiamparino
Tuesday in the company of ROC Representative to Italy Cheng Shin.

During  the meeting,  Chen paised  Chiamparino's  excellent
administrative achievements, saying it was these achievements
that helped Chiamparino win re- election with the support of
nearly two-thirds of the city's voters in 2006.

Chen said that she hopes she will win similar applause from
Kaohsiung citizens in the future.

Expressing her admiration for Turin's success in hosting the 2006
Winter Olympic Games, Chen said the Italian city is a model for
Kaohsiung to learn from in holding international sporting events,
as the southern Taiwan city is preparing for the 2009 World
Games.

Turin is also the host of the 2007 Winter Universiade which is
slated to kick off Wednesday.

Kaohsiung World Games.

Winter Universiade before returning home Thursday.

University Sports Federation.
