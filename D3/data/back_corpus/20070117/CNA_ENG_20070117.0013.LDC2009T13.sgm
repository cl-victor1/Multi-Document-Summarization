KMT TO STRICTLY SCREEN TOP PROSECUTORIAL NOMINEE: CHAIRMAN
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

Taipei,  Jan. 17 (CNA) 01/17/07  14:04:50 (By Deborah Kuo)

<P>
Main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Ma Ying-jeou said
Wednesday that the party will rigorously screen the nominee for
the country's  top prosecutorial post before the legislature
votes Thursday on whether to approve the nomination.
</P>
<P>
The KMT legislative caucus will hold a "straw vote" Wednesday to
gauge KMT lawmakers'  opinions  about the competence  of Chen
Tsung-ming, who has recently been nominated by President Chen
Shui-bian to be the next state public prosecutor-general.
</P>
<P>
Ma said the KMT legislative caucus will examine Chen Tsung-ming
strictly, particularly in terms of several issues that were
raised by KMT Legislators Kao Si-po and Joanna Lei, including the
functions of a special investigation group under the Supreme
Court's state public prosecutor General's Office which has the
authority to deal with crimes committed by top government
officials or their relatives, and how the recent Rebar scandals
should be dealt with.
</P>
<P>
Ma said he does not think that the KMT is opposed to Chen Tsung-
ming's nomination "only for the sake of opposition" as claimed by
the ruling Democractic Progressive Party, adding that the KMT
knows what it is doing this time and knew what it was doing last
time when the KMT rejected  the nomination of Taiwan  High Court
Prosecutor-General Hsieh Wen-ting last year, when President Chen
nominated Hsieh for the top prosecutorial post.
</P>
<P>
The opposition-controlled legislature rejected Hsieh's nomination
by a vote of 101-19, with an additional 88 invalid ballots being
cast, last April. A "yes" vote by at least half of the
legislators present at the vote is required for the nomination to
be approved.
</P>
<P>
Yeh Yi-jin, a party whip of the ruling DPP legislative caucus,
repeated the DPP's condemnation of the KMT Wednesday for its
opposition to Chen Tsung-ming's nomination "for nothing more than
the sake of opposition."
</P>
<P>
Yeh called for the KMT to show some respect for the judicial
system, saying that the country needs a wholesome judicial system
and that it is detrimental to country that the top prosecutorial
post has been left vacant for so long.
</P>
<P>
The legislative committees in charge of the judiciary, organic
laws and statutes, as well as home and nations affairs, held two
joint meetings  in early January  to review Chen Tsung-ming's
qualifications for the post. They are scheduled to hold a third
meeting before the final vote set for Thursday.
</P>
<P>
KMT legislative caucus party whip Tsai Chin-lung said the day
before that the KMT caucus hopes only that a complete review
system can be established in the Legislative Yuan for its right
to approve the nominees for posts like Control Yuan members and
grand justices.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Ko Chien-ming, convener of the legislative caucus of
the ruling DPP, said the caucus respects the president's
nomination and will issue a "first- degree mobilization order, "
meaning that all the party's lawmakers will be required to attend
the confirmation vote Thursday.
