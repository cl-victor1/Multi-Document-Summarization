Taipei,  Jan.  17  (CNA) 01/17/07  17:20:27 (By Y.F. Low)

A foreign worker from Indonesia has recently been diagnosed with
leprosy, making him the first leprosy case reported in the
country this year, officials said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
According to Chung Wen-hung, a dermatologist at Linkou Chang Gung
Memorial Hospital, half of the patient's face was covered with
rashes when he sought treatment at the hospital, and tests
confirmed that he was suffering from leprosy.
</P>
<P>
Chung noted that the disease is difficult to diagnose at the
early stage because it is often mistaken as merely rashes.
</P>
<P>
Chung said a Vietnamese woman married to a Taiwanese man was
diagnosed by the hospital as suffering from leprosy last year and
that both patients could have come to Taiwan during the disease's
incubation period.
</P>
<P>
With the number of foreign workers and foreign spouses increasing
in Taiwan, he urged dermatologists to pay extra attention
whenever they encounter patients from leprosy-affected countries
presenting with unidentified rashes.
</P>
<P>
Shih Wen-yi, deputy director-general of the Center for Disease
Control, said less than 10 cases of leprosy cases are reported
per year in Taiwan in recent years, all of which are imported
cases involving foreign workers or foreign spouses from leprosy-
affected countries such as Indonesia and Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
As the incubation period of leprosy can last two to five years,
some foreign workers and foreign spouses infected with the
disease are able to pass the health examination required before
their entry into Taiwan, Shih said.
