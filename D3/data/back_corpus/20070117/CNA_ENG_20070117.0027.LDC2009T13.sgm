The key suspect in a Jan. 2 bank heist who has been apprehended
by Chinese security authorities after fleeing Taiwan to Yunnan
Province will be repatriated within days, as soon as the weather
allows, a spokesman for China's Taiwan Affairs Office under the
State Council said Wednesday.

Yang Yi said at a regular news briefing in Beijing that Lee Han-
yang -- the driver of an armored cash van for Group 4 Securicor,
a private security company in Taipei -- who drugged his colleague
and made off with NT$56 million (US$1.7 million), will be
repatriated in accordance with the Kinmen Agreement signed by the
Red Cross societies on both sides in 1991.

Lee's younger brother -- identified as Lee Chin-tsan, who
reportedly once did business in Yunnan's Kunming and who has also
been detained by the Chinese public security authorities -- will
also be repatriated along with Lee on charges of condoning,
according to the Yunnan public security authorities.

Unconfirmed reports said Wednesday that several officials from
the National Police Agency (NPA) have already traveled to the
Taiwan-held outlying island of Matsu to be ready to pick up the
Lees, who will be airlifted to Taiwan proper immediately after
they are repatriated from China.

Meanwhile, NPA investigators said they believe that the NT$56
million Lee stole from the armored van is still in Taiwan since
Lee left the country in a hurry immediately after the heist and
the Chinese police did not find a large amount of money on him.
