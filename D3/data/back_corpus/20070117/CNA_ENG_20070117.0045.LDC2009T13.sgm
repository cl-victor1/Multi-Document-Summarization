Vice President Annette Lu said Wednesday the two sides of the
Taiwan Strait should promote normalization of bilateral relations
in terms of "3 Cs" -- co- existence, cooperation and co-
rposperity.
</P>
<P>
Lu made the remarks while attending a videoconference organized
by the New York- based think tank -- the Council on Foreign
Relations.
</P>
<P>
In her opening remarks, Lu also said said Taiwan faces three
challenges -- the rise of Taiwan's national identity, the "magnet
effect" of China and the acceleration of globalization.
</P>
<P>
After leaving its authoritarian past behind and embracing
democracy at the end of the 20th century, Lu said Taiwan is
developing a unique selfhood, which can be roughly translated as
a Taiwan nationality.
</P>
<P>
Quoting the results of a recent survey, Lu said 60 percent of
Taiwan people consider themselves "Taiwanese," compared to only
18 percent in 1992.
