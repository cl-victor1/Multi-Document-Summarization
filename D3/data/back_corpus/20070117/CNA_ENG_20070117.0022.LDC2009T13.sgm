SAKIZAYA RATIFIED AS TAIWAN'S 13TH INDIGENOUS GROUP
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  Jan. 17 (CNA) 01/17/07  17:20:36 (By Deborah Kuo)

<P>
A group of aboriginal people from Hualien, eastern Taiwan were
ratified Wednesday as the Sakizaya tribe, officially designating
them as the country's 13th distinct indigenous group.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a tea party held at the Executive Yuan to mark the
designation, Premier Su Tseng-chang said the Sakizaya people have
finally succeeded in their efforts to be identified and
recognized as a distinct indigenous group.
</P>
<P>
Su said that with the inspiration provided by the Sakizaya
tribe's success, Taiwan as a whole should strive further to
enable its name to be officially identified and recognized  by
the international community.
</P>
<P>
Su offered his congratulations to the Sakizaya people for their
perseverance in conserving their culture, language and traditions
despite twists and turns over the past 120 years.
</P>
<P>
The premier said that while records of the Sakizaya people appear
as far back as historical  archives  compiled by the Spanish
colonialists in the 17th Century, the tribal ancestors decided to
make themselves "disappear" after losing a bloody battle in 1878
to Ching dynasty invaders from China.
</P>
<P>
He said the Sakizaya had traditionally lived in areas today known
as Hualien City and Hsincheng, Chian and Shoufeng rural townships
in Hualien County until the ethnic purge 128 years ago known as
the "Dagubuwan Incident, " when many of the Sakizaya were killed
by the Chinese.
</P>
<P>
Survivors of that incident were so scared that they moved and hid
behind false identities, mostly pretending to be members of the
Ami tribe, Su said.
</P>
<P>
Although the tribe might have appeared to have "vanished," it had
continued to live in the Hualien area over the past 128 years,
discreetly maintaining their traditions, culture and language,
which are completely different to those of the Ami, Su said.
</P>
<P>
With Taiwan becoming more and more democratic, Su said, the
Sakizaya have increasingly craved their own identity, prompting
them to take concrete action toward this goal in May 2005 with
the launch of the Sakizaya identity movement.
</P>
<P>
Since then, more than 5,000 letters have been endorsed by
Sakizaya offspring, confirming that they are Sakizaya rather than
Ami and demanding that the Sakizaya be recognized by the central
government as Taiwan's 13th indigenous group.
</P>
<P>
Also speaking at the tea party, Walis Pelin, chairman of the
Cabinet-level Council of Indigenous Peoples, said that in
addition to the Cabinet's ratification of the Sakizaya, Su had
also approved that a budget be appropriated in order to reclaim
traditional Sakizaya land taken by the Taiwan Sugar Corp. over
the past several decades.
</P>
<P>
Most of the Sakizaya offspring -- believed to number between
5,000 and 10,000 -- have moved away from Hualien to the northern
counties of Taoyuan, Taipei and Keelung.
</P>
<P>
The Truku tribe, who originated from the Taroko Gorge area in
eastern Taiwan, became in 2004 the 12th tribe to be acknowledged
by the government.
</P>
<P>
The recognition helped the Truku people in efforts to obtain
autonomy,  uphold their rights and identity and protect their
ancestral homeland.
