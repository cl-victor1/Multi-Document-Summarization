The leader of a trio of mountaineers attempting to scale Mount
Nanhu and the Central Range Point has died after temperatures in
the mountain area dropped suddenly, according to fire brigade
officials who responded to an emergency call for help Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The officials said they received emergency calls saying that the
team's leader, Lai Shan-chieh, had died while two other team
mates -- Ting Ching-chun and Chou Mei-chu -- were suffering from
hypothermia after temperatures on the 3,700-meter high mountain
dropped rapidly.
</P>
<P>
Ting and Chou were temporarily quartered at a tourist lodge at
Nanhu, while awaiting medical assistance.
</P>
<P>
A seven-member rescue team set off from the brigade's detachment
near Lishan, but it will take them three to four days to reach
the mountain lodge, according to the officials.
</P>
<P>
The brigade requested that a helicopter join the rescue mission
Tuesday, but that plan had to be abandoned due to bad weather.
Officials said they will renew their attempts to reach the area
by air when weather conditions permit.
