Taiwan may consider launching cooperative programs with its
allies in the South Pacific to deal with climate change problems
and help those island countries keep their lands above water, a
Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) official said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Lee Chuan-tung, director-general of the MOFA's Department of East
Asian and Pacific Affairs, said the Foreign Ministry may
collaborate with the Environment Protection Administration in the
near future to jointly launch programs to deal with flooding -- a
result of global warming caused by the excessive use of fossil
fuels -- in the South Pacific area. Of particular concern is
Tuvalu, which is a diplomatic ally of Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Quoting recent foreign wire service reports, Lee said Tuvalu is
on the front line of climate change. Increasingly intense
tropical weather, rising ocean temperatures, and rising sea
levels -- all documented results of atmospheric warming -- are
making trouble for Tuvalu.
</P>
<P>
The sea around Funafuti, the capital of Tuvalu, has reached its
highest level of all time, with sea waves closing in on
residential areas of the capital city, Lee said.
</P>
<P>
One of the smallest nations in the world, Tuvalu has a population
around 12,000 people, who live on nine coral atolls totaling 26
square kilometers.
</P>
<P>
Studies estimate that Tuvalu will be submerged if the globe's
average sea level raises by one meter, Lee said.
</P>
<P>
He added that New Zealand has already taken in many Tuvalians as
immigrants in the wake of flooding.
