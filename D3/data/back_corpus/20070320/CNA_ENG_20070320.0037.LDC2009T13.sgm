CASINOS MUST NOT AFFECT ECOSYSTEM: GREEN ISLAND CHIEF
</HEADLINE>

Despite a government assessment that casinos should be allowed to
open on Taiwan's outlying islands, such establishments must not
affect local ecosystems, Green Island township chief Chen Chia-
wen said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
According  to Chen,  local  residents  would  welcome  the
establishment of casinos on Green Island off the coast of eastern
Taitung County as long as they pose no threat to the natural
environment.
</P>
<P>
Citing the results of a public opinion poll made public in 1997,
Chen said that about 78 percent of local residents surveyed
agreed to the idea of allowing casinos at that time, far ahead of
7 percent who were opposed and some 14 percent who had no
comment.
</P>
<P>
But Chen said that it is necessary to re-assess the issue, as
public awareness of environmental  protection has been greatly
increased among local residents in recent years.
</P>
<P>
He called for comprehensive complementary measures in traffic
management and accommodation if the gambling industry is to be
allowed on the island.
</P>
<P>
He also pointed out that the casino proposal might constitute a
violation of another government plan to designating the island as
a national park.
</P>
<P>
Premier Su Tseng-chang and former Academia Sinica head Lee Yuan-
tzeh inspected Green Island last year and proposed a quota
control mechanism on the entry of tourists in view of the
degradation of the environment there, he said.
