President Chen noted that he was the first ROC president to visit
Nauru last September during which he delivered a speech at the
Nauruan Parliament that was entered into the parliamentary
record.

Chen also said that Nauruan President Ludwig Scotty has visited
Taiwan three times since the two countries resumed diplomatic
ties in May 2005.

The president said that he was glad to learn that the Nauruan
embassy in Taiwan will be opened at the end of this month and

Taiwan first established diplomatic relations with the island
