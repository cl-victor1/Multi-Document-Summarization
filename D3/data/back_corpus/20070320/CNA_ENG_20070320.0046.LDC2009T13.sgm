<P>
President Chen Shui-bian said Tuesday that Taiwan, the United
States and China should jointly manage the "peace, security and
stability in the Taiwan Strait."
</P>
<P>
Chen made the recommendation in a keynote speech delivered at an
American Chamber of Commerce dinner also attended by American
Institute in Taipei Director Stephen M. Young.
</P>
<P>
He also reiterated that Taiwan's pledge to maintain the peaceful
status quo in the strait will be upheld and that the country's
"commitment to the U.S. government and President Bush will also
remain unchanged."
</P>
<P>
Chen said that although China is a huge market with many business
opportunities, it is an unstable factor for the region as long as
its one-party totalitarian regime remains in power, "because
Beijing may at any time choose to invade other nations as a means
of shifting its people's attention away from internal political
contradictions." He added that only a stable Taiwan Strait
jointly managed by Taiwan, the United States and China can
prevent regional prosperity and progress from being threatened
and harmed.
</P>
<P>
He also expressed appreciation for Washington's quick acceptance
of the appointment of Mainland Affairs Council Chairman Joseph Wu
as the new top representative to the United States.
