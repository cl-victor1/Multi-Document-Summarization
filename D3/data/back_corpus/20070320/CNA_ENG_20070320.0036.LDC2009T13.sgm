Taipei, March 20 (CNA) 03/20/07  20:17:06 (By Han Nai-kuo)

<P>
Nearly 70 percent of the paper table mats in Taipei's fast food
chains and hot pot restaurants tested by the Consumer's
Foundation  contain fluorescent penetrant, a toxic whitening
agent, according to results of a survey released by the
foundation Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Foundation officials said they gathered samples of paper mats
from eight fast food stores as well as samples from five hot pot
restaurants March 13 and submitted them to a laboratory for
analysis.
</P>
<P>
The results show that 69 percent of the mats tested contained
fluorescent whitening agents.
</P>
<P>
The officials pointed out that these restaurants include chain
stores selling hamburgers and fried chicken, where many customers
lay their food directly on the paper mats or pour tomato sauce on
them into which they dip their French fries.
</P>
<P>
The whitening agent could be a health hazard if absorbed along
with the food, the officials warned.
</P>
<P>
They said the Consumers' foundation will ask the offending
restaurants to print a clear warning on their paper mats to warn
customers not to let their food touch the mats.
