MORE TALKS NEEDED TO BRING TAIWAN INTO GPA: EU OFFICE HEAD
</HEADLINE>

The head of the European Economic and Trade Office in Taiwan said
Tuesday more talks are needed to bring Taiwan into the Government
Procurement Agreement (GPA) of the World Trade Organization
(WTO), and compromise on the European Union's (EU) part over the
wording concerning Taiwan's status is still possible.
</P>
<P>
At the moment we probably  haven't found an appropriate
formulation  but I believe  we will be able to with further
discussions, said Guy Ledoux, who assumed his post as the head of
the EU office in Taiwan two weeks ago, at a news conference held
to promote the Taiwanese public's understanding of the EU.
</P>
<P>
A plurilateral agreement currently signed by 28 WTO member
countries, the GPA allows businesses from its signatories to
compete across the board for government purchases of goods and
services on a non-discriminatory basis. Negotiations leading to
Taiwan's entry were successfully concluded in 2002, but Taiwan
has yet to join due to objections from China, which is not a GPA
signatory, against some of the wording that refers to Taiwan's
governmental institutions.
</P>
<P>
In order to bring in Taiwan, the GPA Commission last June adopted
a proposal initiated by the United States and the EU and reached
a decision stating that the names or terms used in protocols,
documents and appendices regarding the participation of acustoms
territory in the GPA bear no implications for sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan joined the WTO in 2002 under the name: Separate Customs
Territory of Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen and Matsu.
</P>
<P>
The 2006 decision was not accepted by Taiwanese authorities.
Asked whether compromise on the EU's part over the wording in GPA
materials is possible, Ledoux saidit's my understanding and my
wish.
</P>
<P>
In the run-up to the fiftieth anniversary of the Treaty of Rome,
signed on March 25, 1957, the EU office in Taipei held an event
to promote both European values and relations between Taiwan and
the EU. It also released three new publications: Reporting on the
European Union: A Guide for Journalists, a booklet introducing
the EU, and a cartoon version of the same for young students.
