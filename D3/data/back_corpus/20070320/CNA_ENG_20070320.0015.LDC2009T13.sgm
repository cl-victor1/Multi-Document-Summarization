ALL MOTHER TONGUES IN COUNTRY SHOULD BE RESPECTED, PRESERVED:
PREMIER
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  March 20 (CNA) 03/20/07  15:15:55 (By Deborah Kuo)

<P>
Premier Su Tseng-chang said Tuesday that all the mother tongues
of the people in the country should be respected and preserved,
although a common language is essential.
</P>
<P>
Fielding questions at the Legislative Yuan, Su confirmed that the
Executive Yuan is drafting a national language development bill
aimed at saving dying dialects, particularly aboriginal ones, and
allowing them to flourish again.
</P>
<P>
"The core purpose of the bill is to prevent native tongues from
going extinct as a result of 'wrong' language policies that had
been adopted by the government in the past," Su said.
</P>
<P>
Su made the remarks in response to a question raised by
opposition Kuomintang Legislator Su Chi, who asked whether the
administration is planning to replace mandarin Chinese with the
Taiwanese, or the Hoklo dialect, as the official language of the
country.
</P>
<P>
Also responding to Su Chi's inquiries, Council for Cultural
Affairs Chairman Chiu Kun-liang said the United Nations
Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization listed Taiwan
over a decade ago as an area where local mother tongues are
vanishing.
</P>
<P>
Chiu said the administration, including the Ministry of Education
and the Council for Cultural Affairs, has worked to preserve
dying dialects in the country, in addition to planning for the
national language development bill.
</P>
<P>
Chiu said the bill is aimed at including all tribes' mother
tongues as national languages based on the perspective of
cultural conservation, rather than at replacing mandarin Chinese
as the official language.
</P>
<P>
"All mother tongues in the country -- including Hakka and
aboriginal dialects -- are equal, and all tribes or ethnic groups
in Taiwan have the right to use their own dialects, and that is
the reason why the government is drafting a bill to protect the
native languages," Chiu argued.
</P>
<P>
There are 12 indigenous groups in Taiwan, namely the Amis,
Atayal, Bunun, Kavalan, Paiwan, Pinuyumayan, Rukai, Saisiyat,
Thao, Truku, Tsou, and Yami, with each having their own dialect
and distinct culture.
