The National Palace Museum has won the highest achievement award
from an international organization that aims at encouraging the
use of audiovisual and multimedia technology in museums, a press
release issued by the museum said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Festival Audiovisual International Musees &amp; Patrimoine, or
F@imp, is an annual conference organized by the Committee for
Audiovisual Image and Sound New Technologies, which belongs to
the International Council of Museums.
</P>
<P>
This year marks the first time F@imp has recognized all the
entries of a single museum since its establishment, according to
the press release.
</P>
<P>
Lin Mun-lee, the museum's director, is scheduled to depart for
Vienna, Austria, this August to receive the award, the press
release said.

In 2004, the museum hosted a F@imp competition, which marked the
first time the event was held in Asia, an anonymous official of
the museum pointed out.

The museum won two awards from the organization in 2000 and 2001,
respectively. The press release quoted Lin as saying that this
year's award demonstrates the museum's further efforts in recent
years to digitize its art and artifact collections, and to
promote the use of audiovisual and multimedia technology.
