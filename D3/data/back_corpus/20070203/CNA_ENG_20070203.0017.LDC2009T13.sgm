More than 60 percent of Taiwan's office workers selected the
high-tech Hon Hai Group as their "dream" manufacturing company to
work for, according to the results of a survey released Saturday.

The survey,  which was conducted  by online manpower firm
www.1111.com.tw from Jan. 19-Feb. 2 found that 61.75 percent of
the respondents  hope  to work for Hon Hai,  followed  by Taiwan
Semiconductor Manufacturing Corp. Ltd. (TSMC) at 43.65 percent
and ASUSTek Computer Inc. at 28.57 percent.

The survey, which received 1,260 valid samples from office
workers around the country, had an error margin of 2.8 percentage
points.

In the service sector, the state-run Taiwan Power Company was
ranked as the most popular firm to work for due to its handsome
bonus, followed by China Airlines and Acer Group.

In the financial and banking sector, Chunghwa Post Co. Ltd.,
which has seen a diversification in its operations in the last
few years, was chosen as the most popular finance firm to work
for, followed by the Bureau of National Health Insurance and
Cathay Financial Holding Co.

Wu Ruey-ying, deputy director-general of the 1111 data bank, said
more and more employees are choosing state-run firms as their
dream companies to work for due to the stability and the high
salaries these companies offer, especially after the recent
financial crisis triggered by credit card debts and the run on
the failing Chinese Bank.

salary and welfare or added value attached to the jobs.

Wu suggested that office workers should be professional and
progressive if they want a good position in the job market.
