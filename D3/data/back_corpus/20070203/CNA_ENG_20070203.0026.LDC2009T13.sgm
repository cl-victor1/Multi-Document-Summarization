Tainan County Magistrate Su Huan-chih arrived in San Francisco
Friday for a four-day visit to the U.S. West Coast.
</P>
<P>
Su, heading a county government delegation, began the visit at
the University of California at Berkeley, where he attended an
international wildlife preservation activity focusing on efforts
to preserve the endangered black-faced spoonbill.

<P>
The mouth of the Tsengwen river in Tainan County, southern
Taiwan,  is the wintering ground of the migratory bird, with
statistics showing that at least two-thirds of the world's entire
population of black-faced spoonbills spend the winter there every
year, according to Su, who said the rivermouth is protected by
the central government.

<P>
As the trip is also aimed at attracting investors to Tainan, the
delegation is also scheduled to visit Silicon Valley and
Sacramento.

Su said that the Southern Taiwan Science Park in Tainan County
generated NT$450 billion (US$13.67 billion) in revenues last
year. Mentioning that a special zone for the fabrication of thin-
film transistor liquid crystal displays has been established in
the park, Su said the county hopes more high-tech enterprises
will set up production facilities there.

The delegation visited Seattle in neighboring Washington State
before traveling to San Francisco, where it toured
environmentally friendly architecture and the University of
Washington.
