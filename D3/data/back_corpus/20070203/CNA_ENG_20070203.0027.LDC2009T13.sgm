Kukeng, a rural township in southern Yulin County, has succeeded
in exporting oncidium to Japan, Yunlin County Magistrate Su Chih-
fen said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
An oncidium production cooperative in Kukeng signed a contract
with a Japanese company a day earlier to supply it with 1.6
million oncidium stems this year, Su said, adding that the deal
will help bring the cooperative's annual production value to more
than NT$15 million (US$455,705.43).
</P>
<P>
The flowers are produced by the cooperative's oncidium production
division that was set up in 2005, according to Su.

<P>
The division, which has 17 hectares under cultivation, is
expected to produce 1.7 million stems this year, she added.
