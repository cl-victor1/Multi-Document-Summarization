PROSECUTION REJECTS INDICTMENT REQUEST AGAINST KAOHSIUNG MAYOR
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Kaohsiung, Feb. 2 (CNA) 02/03/07  11:14:20 (By Sofia Wu)
</P>
<P>
The Kaohsiung Prosecutor's Office decided Friday not to indict
Kaohsiung Mayor Chen Chu over allegations that she had made false
vote-buying accusations against her rival Huang Chun-ying on the
eve of last December's mayoral election.
</P>
<P>
Huang, the candidate of the opposition Kuomintang (KMT) , asked
prosecution authorities to place charges against Chen and three
campaign aides, after losing the Dec. 9 mayoral election by a
narrow margin, over what he called their violation of the Public
Officials Election and Recall Law.
</P>
<P>
According to Huang, the Chen campaign's presentation of a video
at a late night news conference ahead of the election allegedly
showing vote-buying on a bus returning from a Huang rally had
seriously tarnished his clean image and hobbled his chances of
electoral victory.
</P>
<P>
Huang claimed that the allegations were a plot of the ruling
Decmocratic Progressive Party (DPP) to win the election by
smearing him.
</P>
<P>
After extensive investigations, the prosecutor's office said in a
ruling that the vote-buying incident was not staged by the Chen
Chu campaign.
</P>
<P>
A careful scrutiny of the videotape presented by the Chen
campaign indeed showed that two men were giving cash to
passengers aboard the bus and reminding them to vote for Huang,
the prosecution authorities said, adding that some individuals
aboard the bus were wearing the Huang campaign vests.
</P>
<P>
It was understandable that the videotape would lead the Chen
campaign into believing that somebody in the Huang campaign was
bribing voters with cash, the prosecution said in the ruling.
</P>
<P>
Against this backdrop, the ruling said none of the four accused
should be prosecuted as they didn't purposely defamed Huang.
"They were just telling facts while presenting the video, " the
prosecution ruling concluded.
</P>
<P>
The three other accused were DPP Legislator Kuan Pi-ling, Chen
Chu's chief campaign manager Chen Chi-mai and her spokesman Hsiao
Yu-jen.
</P>
<P>
After learning of the prosecution's ruling, Hsiao said it is
hoped that KMT Chairman Ma Ying-jeou and Huang Chun-ying can make
a public apology over their false accusation.
