U.S. CONCERNED ABOUT CONSTITUTIONAL REFORMS IN TAIWAN: FORMER
PREMIER
</HEADLINE>

Washington,  Feb.  2 (CNA) 02/03/07  16:54:21 (By Chiehyu Lin and
Elizabeth Hsu)

The U.S. government appears concerned with constitutional
reforms in Taiwan and has hopes Taiwan's government can always
keep it informed of the latest developments in this regard,
former Premier Frank Hsieh said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Hsieh made the remarks in response to media inquiries during a
visit to Tidal Basin, a scenic spot in Washington, D.C. Hsieh
headed a delegation on behalf of President Chen Shui-bian that
attended the National Prayer Breakfast held the previous day.
</P>
<P>
Asked in what way the U.S.  is concerned  about Taiwan's
constitutional reform plan, Hsieh said the U.S. government is
skeptical whether Taiwan would honor its previous promise on the
issue.
</P>
<P>
Hsieh said he told U.S. officials that many things in Taiwan are
not under the government's control and that a lot of situations
cannot be anticipated now that Taiwan is a democratic country.
</P>
<P>
In his view,  Hsieh said the two sides  should  increase
communications so that they can more easily predict each other's
actions or reactions.
</P>
<P>
He told reporters that it would not be proper for Taiwan to act
differently from the information it gave to the U.S. in advance.
To his best understanding, Hsieh said,  the U.S. government was
"surprised" by Taiwan's actions on several previous occasions.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. authorities do not want Taiwan to deceive them, Hsieh
went on, adding that Taiwan should offer frank explanations to
the U.S. side whenever it comes up with new policy initiations
that may cause U.S. concern.
</P>
<P>
Although it is difficult to control the development of democracy,
Taiwan's leaders should refrain from "talking too fast" and
should keep their promises, Hsieh said, adding that when he
returned to Taipei, he would inform the government of his opinion
on Taiwan-U.S. relations, which is that "the two sides share same
strategic interests but need to repair and strengthen bilateral
ties."
</P>
<P>
Asked about U.S. concerns over Taiwan's delay in carrying out its
plan to purchase arms from the United States, Hsieh claimed that
consensus has been reached between the ruling and opposition
parties on the issue and that the legislature will pass a long-
delayed arms procurement bill by March or April.
