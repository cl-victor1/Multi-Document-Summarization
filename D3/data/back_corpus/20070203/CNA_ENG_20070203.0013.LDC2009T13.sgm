The Taiwan External Trade Development Council  (TAITRA)  will
head a trade delegation  of machinery manufacturers to Eastern
Europe in May to help domestic manufacturers explore the market
there, a TAITRA official said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The official noted that as more and more East European countries
have entered or are preparing to enter the World Trade
Organization (WTO) , trade information about these countries is
becoming more transparent.
</P>
<P>
Judging from the statistics, there is a trend that more and more
East European countries are shifting their purchase sources from
Western Europe to more competitive Asian countries, the official
added.
</P>
<P>
TAITRA is scheduled to hold three trade seminars in Poland,
Ukraine and Russia, respectively, from May 15-27.
</P>
<P>
In addition to inviting buyers in these East European countries
to trade consulting talks with the Taiwan delegates, TAITRA will
also arrange several visits for domestic manufacturers to their
East European counterparts or trade organizations there.
</P>
<P>
Domestic manufacturers in the electric or electronic machinery
industries who are interested in joining the delegation can apply
to TAITRA before Feb. 10, the official added.
