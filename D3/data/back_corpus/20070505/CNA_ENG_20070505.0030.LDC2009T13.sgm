Taipei,  May 5 (CNA) 05/05/07  21:43:44 (By Maubo Chang)

<P>
Premier Su Tseng-chang claimed Saturday that he was the victim in
the leak of information about his predecessor, former Premier
Frank Hsieh, who is involved in a corruption case that is under
investigation.
</P>
<P>
Su, who is in a cut-throat competition with Hsieh and two other
contenders -- Vice President Annette Lu and DPP Chairman Yu Shyi-
kun --  in the Democratic Progressive Party primary for the 2008
presidential race, denied an accusation made by Hsieh's camp that
he was the mastermind behind the May 2 leak of information with
the intent of tarnishing the former Kaohsiung City mayor Frank
Hsieh who is leading the premier by a slim margin in opinion
polls.
</P>
<P>
The premier said that he has ordered a thorough investigation
into the leak of the contents of a letter written by a prosecutor
from the Kaohsiung branch of the Taiwan High Prosecutors' Office
but that he himself has had no role in it.
</P>
<P>
"As chief of the Executive Yuan, I have no way of learning about
the contents of a specific letter written by a prosecutor to
agents of the Investigator Bureau," the premier claimed.
</P>
<P>
Su further said that he himself was badly hurt by the leak
because his political foes have used the incident to claim that
he "pulled the strings behind the plot."
</P>
<P>
A local weekly, Next Magazine, published May 2 a letter written
by prosecutor Luo Chien-hsun April 3 to the Kaohsiung branch of
the Investigation Bureau in which the prosecutor asked
investigators to refer Hsieh to the Kaohsiung District
Prosecutors' Office for further investigation in connection with
corruption.
</P>
<P>
The prosecutor claimed his preliminary investigation has yielded
iron-clad evidence of Hsieh's inapproriate ways of seeking
political donations in 2002 when he was serving as mayor of
Kaohsiung.
</P>
<P>
Hsieh has already been questioned by prosecutors twice in
connection with the case. None of the contents of the
investigation had been disclosed prior to the disclosure of the
prosecutor's letter on May 2.
</P>
<P>
The letter caused an outcry in political circles as it was
published four days before the DPP member vote in the party's
presidential primary in which Hsieh and Su were considered the
leading contenders.
</P>
<P>
Hsieh called the leak a political scheme hatched by his political
foes to undermine his campaign, adding that the premier, as the
head of the administration, should be held responsible for the
incident anyway.
