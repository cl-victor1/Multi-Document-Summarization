Taipei,  May 4 (CNA) 05/05/07  11:42:26 (By Chris Wang)

President Chen Shui-bian Friday praised the ideals and
achievements of the European Union (EU), which is entering its
50th year, and appealed to EU for its support of Taiwan in the
international community.
</P>
<P>
Highlighting the World Health Organization (WHO) Secretariat's
refusal to accept Taiwan's request to become a WHO member under
the name "Taiwan" and the fact that the United Nations Office in
Geneva once again refused  to issue press credentials  to
Taiwanese journalists to cover the World Health Assembly (WHA),
Chen urged the EU to "extend more assistance  to and support for
Taiwan in international affairs."
</P>
<P>
"We deeply appreciate the EU's solid support for Taiwan's
accession to the World Trade Organization (WTO). With the WHA
soon to convene, it is my earnest hope that EU delegates will
also speak up for Taiwan at the assembly and join hands with us
to safeguard the collective health rights of the 23 million
people of Taiwan, " Chen said at a Europe Day dinner hosted by
the European Chamber of Commerce to celebrate the EU's 50th
anniversary.
</P>
<P>
Citing the Freedom of the Press 2007 survey published by
U.S.-based Freedom House Tuesday, in which Taiwan ranked No. 33
among the 195 countries surveyed and counted as Asia's most
media-friendly country, Chen said it is ironic that Asia's freest
press environment is denied the freedom to cover the WHA.
</P>
<P>
"Do not hesitate to do a good deed because it is trivial, and do
not do an evil deed because it is negligible, " Chen said, using
an old saying to encourage European countries speak up against
China's relentless oppression of Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
He described European integration as "the grandest project in
mankind's contemporary history" and in his speech lauded the EU's
pursuit of four major objectives: peace, security, solidarity and
progress.
</P>
<P>
Europe Day, May 9, is the anniversary of the Schuman Declaration
in which former French Foreign Minister Robert Schuman proposed a
new form of political arrangement for Europe. Six countries
decided in 1957 with the Treaty of Rome to build a European
Economic Community, which is now known as the EU.
