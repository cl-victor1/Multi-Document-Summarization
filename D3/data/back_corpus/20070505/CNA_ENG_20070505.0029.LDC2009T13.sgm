The Taiwan Railway Administration (TRA) will use nanotechnology
on its new trains to combat the nagging problems of odors and
dust, TRA officials said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The officials noted that surveys have found that passengers have
complained most about the "foul smell" of the restrooms on
trains, and this is why the TRA has decided to employ the new
technology on the "Taroko Express," as the tilted new trains
traveling between Taipei and Hualien are called. The new trains
are due to make their debut next Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
While demonstrating the new technology in Taipei Saturday, the
officials noted that passengers on the "Taroko Express" will
notice that the restrooms no longer smell bad.
</P>
<P>
The TRA has reportedly invested NT$2.8 billion (US$84.84 million)
for the purchase of the new trains which will drastically cut
travel time between Taipei and Hualien to one hour and 55 minutes
from the currents two hours and 45 minutes.
</P>
<P>
The officials said that they have made use of technology
developed by the Industrial Technology Research Institute to help
sterilize the restrooms and clean the glass windows on the
trains.
</P>
<P>
They said that a dust-fighting coating material will prevent dust
from accumulating on the glass, noting that experiments have
shown that the material cuts by half the amount of dust that
accumulates on the windows.
</P>
<P>
The new technology will first be used on the Taroko Express and
will later be used on other trains, the officials added.
