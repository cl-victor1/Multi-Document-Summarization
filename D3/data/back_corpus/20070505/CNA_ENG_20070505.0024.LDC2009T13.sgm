Taipei, May 5 (CNA) 05/05/07  19:47:56 (By Lilian Wu)

Nearly 70 percent of the Taiwan people think that ranking
officials from Taiwan and Hong Kong should increase direct
exchanges to enhance bilateral relations, according to the
results of a survey released Saturday by the Mainland Affairs
Council (MAC).
</P>
<P>
The MAC commissioned National Chengchi University to conduct the
survey to learn more about the public's views on the development
of Taiwan-Hong Kong relations as well as the recent chief
executive election in the former British colony. A total of 1,072
valid samples were collected in the poll which is said to have a
margin of error of plus or minus 2.99 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
In the survey, 69.9 percent of the respondents said they are in
favor of the idea of increasing contacts between high-level
officials in Taiwan and Hong Kong, compared with 14 percent who
said they are opposed to such exchanges.
</P>
<P>
MAC officials said that exchanges between Taiwan and Hong Kong
have been frequent in recent years, but Hong Kong has yet to set
up an office in Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
The officials expressed the hope that Hong Kong can set up an
office in Taiwan soon so as to facilitate the assistance and
protection of Hong Kong people on the island.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the survey also found that 63.7 percent of the
respondents think that China should allow Hong Kong people the
right to elect their leaders.
</P>
<P>
The officials noted that although an election was held March 25
to select the chief executive of Hong Kong, it was a "small
circle election" in which only the 800 members of the Election
Committee (EC) were allowed to vote. The EC is elected by three
percent of the population in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Outgoing Chief Executive Donald Tsang was re-elected with 649
votes, defeating pro-democracy candidate Alan Leong, who garnered
123 votes.
