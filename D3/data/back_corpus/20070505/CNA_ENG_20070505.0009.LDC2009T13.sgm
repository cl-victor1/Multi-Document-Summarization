REGULATIONS ON CHINESE EMPLOYEES IN TAIWAN REVISED
</HEADLINE>

A regulation revised Friday by the Mainland Affairs Council (MAC)
allows children of multinational enterprises' Chinese employees
in Taiwan to study at schools for foreign residents, MAC Vice
Chairman Liu Te-hsun said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Liu said some excellent Chinese workers are hesitant to work in
Taiwan because they are worried about their children's education,
so that the revised regulations might increase their willingness
to come here.
</P>
<P>
The original regulations allowed multinational enterprises'
Chinese employees in management or professional services to be
transferred to Taiwan to work. After three years, they can apply
for admission to Taiwanese schools for their children, who must
be under that age of 18 and cannot stay in Taiwan for more than
one year at a time, Liu said.
</P>
<P>
After entering Taiwanese schools, these children will be able to
take the same school entrance exams as Taiwanese students in
order to get higher education.
</P>
<P>
In addition,  the proposed  revisions  offer  multinational
companies' Chinese employees in Taiwan another choice -- sending
their children to study at educational institutes for foreign
residents, Liu said.
</P>
<P>
The revised regulations will be implemented after being approved
by the Executive Yuan, Liu said.
