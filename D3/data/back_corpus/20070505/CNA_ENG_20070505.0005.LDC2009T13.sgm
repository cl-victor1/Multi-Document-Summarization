WHO PANNED FOR `OUTRAGEOUS' HANDLING OF TAIWAN'S MEMBERSHIP BID
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  May 4 (CNA) 05/05/07  11:27:18 (By Sofia Wu)

President Chen Shui-bian lambasted the World Health Organization
(WHO) Friday for what he described as its "outrageous" handling
of Taiwan's membership application, saying the world health care
body has insulted itself with its uncivilized behavior toward
Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Speaking in an interview with a local cable TV channel, Chen said
WHO Secretariat personnel "stealthily" returned his April 22
letter to WHO Director- General Margaret Chan applying for
Taiwan's WHO membership under the name "Taiwan" by sliding it
under the door of the Taiwan Representative Office in Geneva.
</P>
<P>
Against this backdrop, Chen said he decided to write to Chan
again, asking the WHO Secretariat to handle Taiwan's membership
application in line with provisions set by the World Health
Assembly (WHA) -- the WHO's decision-making arm. Chen stressed
that the WHO Secretariat is not empowered to determine whether
Taiwan is entitled to apply for a seat in the WHO. Only the WHO
members can determine the fate of Taiwan's membership bid, he
said in his second letter.
</P>
<P>
This  time around,  Chen said representatives  of Taiwan's
diplomatic allies were asked to convey his second letter to Chan
in person May 1 to make sure Chan received that letter. To avoid
any "unexpected surprises, " copies of the letter were also sent
from Taiwan and Geneva to the WHO headquarters via registered
mail, he added.
</P>
<P>
Over the past decade, Chen said, Taiwan has tried in vain to join
the WHA as an observer simply because of China's obstruction. Two
years ago, the United States and several other advanced countries
suggested that Taiwan be granted right for "meaningful
participation" in WHO-sponsored technical meetings and
activities.
</P>
<P>
Much to Taiwan's shock and regret, Chen said, the WHO secretly
signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) with China on Taiwan's
participation in WHO- related activities, under which Taiwan's
medical experts have to filed applications five weeks in advance
and the applications must be approved by China's health
department. The MOU also stipulates that Taiwan medical personnel
must attend the WHO activities in private capacity and they
should be identified as "coming from Taiwan, China" in all
official documents.
</P>
<P>
"We didn't know the existence of such a humiliating pact until
earlier this year. The whole world has also been kept in dark.
Under such a biased accord, we can never have any meaningful
participation. This is why we decided to apply for full WHO
membership under the name 'Taiwan' this year," Chen explained,
adding that the government will stick to its gun with regard to
the country's WHO bid.
