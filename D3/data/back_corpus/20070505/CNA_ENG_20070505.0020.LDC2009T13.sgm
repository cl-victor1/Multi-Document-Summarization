CORRIDOR TO STRENGTHEN TAIWAN-PHILIPPINES ECONOMIC TIES: OFFICIAL
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  May  5  (CNA) 05/05/07  17:22:25 (By Chris Wang)
</P>
<P>
The Kaohsiung-Subic Bay-Clark economic corridor is going at full
strength, and it seeks to strengthen economic relations between
Taiwan and the Philippines, a Philippine official told the CNA in
an interview Saturday.
</P>
<P>
By linking three economic and export process zones and allowing
easier product and manpower movement, Taiwan and the Philippines
will be able to build upon their already successful trade
relations and create a win-win situation, said Armand Arreza,
administrator and CEO of the Subic Bay Metropolitan Authority.
</P>
<P>
Arreza was a part of a Philippines delegation that visited Taiwan
from May 2-5 to review the implementation of the economic
corridor, an initiative submitted by former Minister of Economic
Affairs Ho Mei-yueh in 2005. The Memorandum of Agreement was
signed and went into effect May 2006.
</P>
<P>
The Philippines and Taiwan have been enjoying a long and
harmonious trade relationship, Arreza said, adding that there are
more than 45 Taiwanese locators in the Subic Bay Freeport Zone
which account for more than 80 percent of the zone's export
value.
</P>
<P>
The establishment of the corridor is expected to resolve some
issues that have concerned Taiwanese companies and make Subic Bay
attractive again, he said.
</P>
<P>
The Clark Special Economic Zone, a former U.S. Air Force base
located just north of Manila, will also become attractive for
Taiwanese companies, especially following Philippine President
Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo's announcement of a US$1 billion
investment plan by Texas Instruments earlier this week, Clark
Development Corp. Director Benigno Ricafort said.
</P>
<P>
Arreza also clarified local news reports on Taiwanese businesses'
"exodus" from Subic Bay, stressing that the freeport always
welcomes Taiwanese companies and that it is "delivering more and
more incentives to Taiwanese companies."
</P>
<P>
"This is an international zone for everyone. Companies from South
Korea, China and the United States have seen the opportunities [
for investment.] It's only a matter of time before Taiwan once
again recognizes the opportunities," Arreza said.
</P>
<P>
However, he admitted that some Taiwanese companies have moved out
of Subic Bay, explaining that "it's just a part of the business"
since companies are always looking for cheaper labor.
</P>
<P>
"Today, they're moving to Vietnam, tomorrow they will be in
Cambodia. And in the future, they will probably be in Africa, "
he said.
</P>
<P>
"But we want to work with Taiwan, and we are always looking to
adjust, " he reiterated, saying that qualified engineers are in
short supply, and that's Taiwan's strength. If Taiwan takes
advantage of the Philippine  labor force and helps develop its
talent and creativity, this will be beneficial for both sides, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Subic Bay and Clark are working hard to improve infrastructure,
including building expressways, international airports and power
supply networks, Ricafort added.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan's Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) announced in a press
release that the Philippines has agreed to grant Taiwanese IC
makers tax-free treatment for a period of between 6-8 years, as
well as 90-day visas and work permits, while lowering electricity
costs for Taiwanese locators. The two sides will also collaborate
to push for direct flights between Taipei/Kaohsiung and Subic
Bay/Clark and to integrate tourism into the corridor in the
future.
</P>
<P>
According to MOEA tallies, bilateral trade between Taiwan and the
Philippines reached US$7.2 billion for 2006, with Taiwan ranking
as the Philippines' sixth largest trading partner.
