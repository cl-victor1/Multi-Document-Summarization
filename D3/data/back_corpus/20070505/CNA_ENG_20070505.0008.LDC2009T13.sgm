Taiwan is making its Arabian Travel Market debut, joining 63
other countries in the 2007 exhibition, a spokesman for the
Taiwan External Trade Development Council (TAITRA) said Friday.

The Arabian Travel Market 2007, being held at the Dubai World
Trade Center with 2,600 exhibitors, is a leading travel and
tourism exhibition in the Middle East.

The TAITRA spokesman said the Taiwan pavilion at the exhibition
is not only showing documentaries on Taiwan's scenic beauty but
is also distributing brochures for two hospitals -- Taipei Show
Chwan Hospital and Taipei Municipal Wanfang Hospital -- to
attract tourists who wish to make use of Taiwan's health care
services while they are visiting Taiwan.

He said that although this is the first time Taiwan has taken
part in the travel fair, there have been crowds of people around
the Taiwan pavilion over the past four days, making inquiries
about Taiwan and seeking tourism information.
