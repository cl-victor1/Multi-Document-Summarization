cyclist- friendly to promote biking as an alternative means of
transportation for commuters.

Su said the government will amend transportation regulations and
designate special paths for cyclists in both downtown and
suburban areas in various counties and cities around the country
so that cyclists will receive due respect as road users.

"Taiwan Bike Day" held in Pali, Taipei County by the Cycling
Life-Style Foundation.

as a 73-year- old man, he believes he will be able to complete
it.
