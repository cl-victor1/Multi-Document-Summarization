Taipei,  April  29 (CNA) 04/29/07  17:47:38 (By Deborah Kuo)

More than 2,000 people from some 400 families rallied on Taipei
streets Sunday to support "International Spank Out Day" which was
initiated in 1998 by a U.S. group to bring widespread attention
to its campaign to end the physical punishment of children.
</P>
<P>
Activists from several dozen other Taiwan civil groups, including
Homemakers' Union and Foundation, also took part in the rally --
a walk from National Taiwan University to Daan Forest Park --
sponsored by the non-profit Humanistic Education Foundation
(HEF).
</P>
<P>
HEF volunteers called on Taiwan parents and teachers not to spank
their children or students, while offering educational
information to parents and caregivers about non-violent
discipline alternatives.
</P>
<P>
Group members suggested that adults, rather than smacking a child
on a sudden impulse, place a phone call for educational
consultation, exchange pithy formulas encouraging  non-violent
solutions  -- particularly during periods of anger -- and seek
supportive resources in order to help end the resort to violence.
</P>
<P>
"Angry" parents and teachers are also encouraged to hit drums,
play ball, or clean the house to channel their sudden impulses or
dissipate bad moods.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Education Tu Cheng-sheng, who was among several
celebrities invited by the HEF to offer their "pithy formulas" to
beef up April 30 "International Spank Out Day, " said: "Respect
and understand children to avoid treating them violently."
</P>
<P>
Noting that even a little  child is a human being whose
individuality should be respected by adults, Tu said that
spanking will actually deal only with superficial problems while
leaving the core issues unsolved.
</P>
<P>
Similar "No Smacking Day" activities were held in Taichung in
central Taiwan, and the southern port city of Kaohsiung Sunday.
</P>
<P>
HEF officials said that various countries around the world,
including the United States hold various events every year to
observe the "Spank Out Day, " which is sometimes called "No
Hitting Day, " or "Day of Non-Violence for Children." The day of
action was initiated by the U.S. Center for Effective Discipline
in 1998.
