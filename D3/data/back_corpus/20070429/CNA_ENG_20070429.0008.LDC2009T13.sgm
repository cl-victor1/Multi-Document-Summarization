CHEN PROTESTS AGAINST WHO OVER TAIWAN'S MEMBERSHIP BID
</HEADLINE>

Taipei, April 29 (CNA) 04/29/07  14:04:12 (By Deborah Kuo)

President Chen Shui-bian lodged "a protest in the strongest
terms" against the secretariat of the World Health Organization
(WHO) Sunday, saying that Taiwan's bid to join the WHO is not an
issue that could be denied or decided by the secretariat or any
individual working for the WHO.
</P>
<P>
Taking the former East Germany as an example, Chen said whether
Taiwan should be admitted into the WHO as a full member is an
issue that should be determined by all member countries of the
WHO.
</P>
<P>
Chen appealed to the WHO Secretariat and WHO Director-General
Margaret Chan for handling Taiwan's accession bid in accordance
with the WHO laws and spirit and referring Taiwan's membership
application to the World Health Assembly, so that all WHO members
can discuss the issue and reach a decision when they meet in mid-
May.
</P>
<P>
Chen made the call in his speech at the opening of a workshop on
Taiwan's bid to join the WHO under the name of Taiwan, marking
the first and formal response to a WHO Secretariat's response to
his letter dated April 11 to the WHO director- general about
Taiwan's membership bid.
</P>
<P>
The WHO Secretariat responded in an April 25 letter to Chen by
calling Taiwan's application a "non-issue" and saying that after
a thorough study and legal consultation, the WHO had decided not
to deal further with the issue, on the grounds that Taiwan is
ineligible to apply for membership, which requires statehood
recognized by the United Nations.
