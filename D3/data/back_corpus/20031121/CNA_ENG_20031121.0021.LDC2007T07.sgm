Taiwan has made preparations to keep a new outbreak of severe acute
respiratory syndrome (SARS) at bay as winter approaches, Taiwan's top
health official said here Thursday.

<P>
Chen Chien-jen, minister of the Cabinet-level Department of Health
(DOH) , who arrived in Washington Wednesday, said he has exchanged
views with U.S. officials on how to prevent SARS outbreaks and
strengthen cooperation in improving public health.
</P>
<P>
Chen, who has met with officials from the U.S. Department of Health
and Human Services, the Agency for Health Care Quality and Research
and the National Institute of Health, expressed Taiwan's appreciation
to Secretary of Health Tommy Thompson for the United States' decision
to send health specialists to Taiwan early this year when the SARS
onslaught was at its height.
</P>
<P>
The DOH head also expressed appreciation to Thompson for his courage
and righteousness in a speech he made in support of Taiwan at the
recent World Health Organization assembly meeting.

According to Chen, the DOH has installed thermal monitors at the main
airports and seaports since the SARS outbreak in Taiwan in March. In
addition, he said, the government has also made sure that 1.5 million
senior citizens and 500,000 health care personnel have received flu
vaccinations as a preventive measure against SARS.
</P>
<P>
Chen said he was told by Thompson that the United States has also made
necessary preparations to ward off a possible SARS epidemic and that
the United States will again offer help in the event of an outbreak.
