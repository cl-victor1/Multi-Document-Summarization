PROSECUTORS TO PROBE OTHER SPECIAL ALLOWANCE FUNDS CASES SOON

Taipei,  Feb.  13 (CNA) 02/14/07  10:44:42 (BY Sofia Wu)
</P>
<P>
Investigations into suspected special allowance fund misuse
involving many government executives will get underway soon, a
spokesman for the anti- corruption center under the Taiwan High
Prosecutor's Office said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman made the remarks after main opposition Kuomintang
Chairman Ma Ying-jeou was indicted earlier in the day on charges
of embezzling  from a special  mayoral  fund designated  for his
discretionary use while he served as Taipei mayor from 1998 to
2006.
</P>
<P>
According to the spokesman, prosecutor Hou Kuan-jen began his
investigation into Ma's alleged misuse of fund last August after
Legislator Hsieh Hsin-ni complained that Ma had channeled money
from the fund into his private bank accounts.
</P>
<P>
Under the existing budgetary system, all executives holding
public office are given a special allowance fund every month.
Although the money is left up to the administrative  chief's
discretion, half of the fund can be spent without any proof of
spending, while use of the other half must be substantiated with
receipts.
</P>
<P>
The anti-corruption center has also received similar accusations
against Vice President Annette Lu, Judicial Yuan President Weng
Yueh-sheng, Premier Su Tseng- chang, and other heavyweights of
the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP).
</P>
<P>
The High Prosecutor's Office spokesman said the anti-corruption
center will begin to investigate those cases in the near future
now that probes into Ma's case has been concluded.
</P>
<P>
Ma was charged with embezzling NT$11.17 million (US$337,650) from
the mayoral special allowance fund during his two mayoral terms.
Ma claimed innocence and argued that if he is found guilty, then
the same fate will befall almost all government executives,
including almost all prominent DPP heavyweights.
</P>
<P>
The indictment dealt a blow to Harvard-educated Ma, but he denied
the charges and announced he would run for president next year.
"I want to face the people and prove my innocence, " he said in a
televised speech. "Ma Ying-jeou won't be knocked down."
</P>
<P>
However, Ma announced that he would step down as KMT chairman in
line with a promise he has made repeatedly over the past several
weeks.
</P>
<P>
The KMT's decision-making Central Standing Committee rejected his
resignation. It remains uncertain when Ma's resignation will take
effect.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile,  the KMT committee  passed a resolution  at an
extraordinary meeting Tuesday evening to revoke a party
regulation that requires suspension of membership rights of any
KMT member who is indicted on criminal charges. The removal of
the regulation is part of the committee's efforts to retain Ma as
party chairman.
</P>
<P>
Responding to Ma's indictment, Vice President Lu reminded her DPP
colleagues to refrain from harboring the feelings of
schadenfreude over Ma's predicament or the KMT's misfortune.
</P>
<P>
"All DPP politicians should instead reflect upon themselves and
brace themselves up for new challenges ahead, " Lu said, adding
she believes that Ma's indictment would have significant
ramifications on domestic poltiical development.
