NAME CHANGE NOT TO AFFECT VALIDITY OF STAMPS: TAIWAN POST CO.
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  Feb. 14 (CNA) 02/14/07  11:50:08 (By Sofia Wu)

<P>
The change of the name on stamps issued by Taiwan Post Co. will
not affect the stamps' validity, a spokesman for the state-owned
company said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman made the remarks after a postal expert with the
Berne-based Universal Postal Union (UPU) said a day earlier that
individual UPU member countries can ask to invalidate new stamps
to be issued by the newly renamed Taiwan Post Co.
</P>
<P>
The state-owned postal company formally changed its name from
Chunghwa Post Co. -- "Chunghwa" means China-- to Taiwan Post Co.
Monday, and it plans to issue the first set of stamps marked
"Taiwan" Feb. 28, featuring the Taipei 228 Memorial Museum as the
theme in commemoration of the 60th anniversary of the 228
Incident.
</P>
<P>
The stamps will be the first to carry the Chinese characters for
"Taiwan stamp" instead of the words "Republic of China stamp."
</P>
<P>
According to the UPU expert, UPU member countries are entitled to
void the new "Taiwan stamp" in line with Article 8 of the UPU
Convention regarding the name on stamps.
</P>
<P>
If any individual UPU member state informs the UPU Secretariat of
its decision to invalidate the new "Taiwan stamp, " the expert
said, the UPU Secretariat is obliged to deliver the message to
all other member states. It's up to individual UPU member states
to decide whether to follow suit, the expert said.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the UPU expert's remarks, the Taiwan Post spokesman
said such a scenario is not expected to happen given the
company's longstanding good cooperative ties with various UPU
member countries.
</P>
<P>
Although Taiwan has not been a UPU member since 1972, it has
consistently followed international norms and UPU regulations,
the spokesman  said,  adding that the bilateral postal
cooperation agreements the company has signed with various UPU
member states are valid for good.
</P>
<P>
"Following our company's redesignation, we need just to exchange
notes with various UPU member countries and our bilateral postal
cooperative contracts will continue to be valid and binding, "
the spokesman explained.
</P>
<P>
According to the spokesman, stamps prepared with the words
"Republic of China" will continue to be printed in the first
quarter of this year, with "Republic of China" stamps to stop
being issued in April at the earliest.
</P>
<P>
Unveiling the "Taiwan Post Co." plaque at the postal company
headquarters Monday, President Chen Shui-bian said the name
change is "a belated move to serve Taiwanese justice by dumping
the outdated 'Great China' ideology."
</P>
<P>
"Although we have practiced democracy for 20 years, " Chen said,
"many people still have martial law in their hearts, and they
refuse to use the beautiful name of Taiwan to address ourselves
and our country."
</P>
<P>
Noting that the history of the postal company dates back to 1888
when the Qing Dynasty established a Taiwan Post Bureau, Chen said
the redesignation also marks the restoration of the name and
history of the postal service.
</P>
<P>
"Since Taiwan is already a democratic country, we Taiwanese
should recognize ourselves and value our culture as well as our
name," he added.
