FORMER KMT CHAIRMAN'S PRESIDENTIAL BID CALLED 'POPULISTIC'
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  Feb. 14 (CNA) 02/14/07  17:30:52 (By Y.F. Low)
</P>
<P>
Former Premier Frank Hsieh accused former opposition Kuomintang
(KMT) Chairman Ma Ying-jeou Wednesday of resorting to "populism"
for announcing his bid to run for the next presidency immediately
being charged with corruption.
</P>
<P>
The anti-corruption  center  under  the Taiwan  High Court
Prosecutor's Office indicted Ma a day earlier on corruption
charges after determining that he embezzled NT$11.17 million
(US$337,650) from a special allowance fund designated for his
discretionary use during his two terms as Taipei mayor from 1998
to 2006.
</P>
<P>
While resigning from the KMT chairmanship immediately after the
indictment, Ma claimed his innocence and announced his decision
to run for the presidency in 2008 to prove his integrity "via
voter support" in the election.
</P>
<P>
According to Hsieh, who is a possible presidential candidate of
the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) ,  Ma's move is
unfavorable to the establishment of a fair judicial system,
because the people do not review relevant documents, question
witnesses or see any evidence but only base their judgment on
their impressions.
</P>
<P>
On expected judicial investigations into suspected misuse of
special allowance funds involving other government executives,
which could implicate a number of other important politicians,
Hsieh said he believes there are no problems with the way their
special allowances were spent.
</P>
<P>
Hsieh claimed that he did not use fake receipts to claim
reimbursement  from the allowance and spent all the funds on
office-related affairs.
</P>
<P>
Hsieh claimed that Ma is to be blamed for his own predicament,
pointing out that he claimed he used the special allowance on
office-related affairs in the beginning but later admitted that
some of the funds were used for private purposes.
