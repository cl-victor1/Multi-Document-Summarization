The ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) will kick off its
primaries for the year-end legislative elections and the March
2008 presidential election earlier than originally scheduled,
officials said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The DPP Central Standing Committee passed a proposal at its
regular  weekly meeting that day that all aspirants  for the
presidential election must register between March 5 and March 9.
A party member vote for both the presidential and legislative
elections will be held May 6, which will account for 30 percent
of the primary.
</P>
<P>
Public opinion polls for the presidential election will be held
between May 7 and May 28, which will account for the remaining 70
percent. The party will announce its candidate May 30.
</P>
<P>
All hopefuls for the legislative elections should register with
the party from March 12-16 and public opinion polls will be held
May 11-June 17 before the candidates are announced June 20.
</P>
<P>
The DPP said earlier  that the primary  system should be
institutionalized based on the three previous presidential
elections, which would mean registration in April, a member vote
in May and public opinion polls in June.
</P>
<P>
However, after President Chen Shui-bian intervened to sort out
differences among the four heavyweights and aspirants for the
presidency -- Vice President Annette Lu, Premier Su Tseng-chang,
DPP Chairman Yu Shyi-kun and former Premier Frank Hsieh -- a
consensus was reached to bring the primary forward.
</P>
<P>
"The moving ahead of the primary has nothing to do with the
announcement of former Kuomintang Chairman Ma Ying-jeou's bid for
the presidential election," Yu said.
</P>
<P>
Ma resigned as the party head and announced his bid for the
presidency after being indicted for allegedly embezzling NT$11.17
million (US$338,500) from a special allowance fund for his
discretionary use during his tenure as two-term Taipei mayor that
ended December 2006. Ma has maintained his innocence.
