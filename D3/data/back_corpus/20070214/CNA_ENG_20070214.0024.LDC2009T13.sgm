A long queue has been forming outside the residence of President
Chen Shui- bian's parents in Kuantien township of Tainan County,
southern Taiwan, in which people use chairs to mark their places
in a line to receive red envelope be presented by Chen on Chinese
New Year's Day.
</P>
<P>
The envelopes are believed by the recipients to be "lucky."
</P>
<P>
Every year of Chen's presidency the Chen family residence has
been surrounded by crowds of "red envelope hunters" on Lunar New
Year's Day, many of whom begin lining up days in advance.
</P>
<P>
The queue is headed this year by Chen Chao-shou from northern
Taipei County, who started waiting Feb. 8 and has hardly left the
queue since, according to security guards stationed at the Chen
family residence.

<P>
Chen Chao-shou was also first in line last year.
