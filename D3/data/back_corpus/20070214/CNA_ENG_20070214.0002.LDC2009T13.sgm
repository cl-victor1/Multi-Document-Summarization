Taipei, Feb. 13 (CNA) 02/14/07  10:43:01 (By Han Nai-kuo)

Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng said Tuesday he believes
in opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Ma Ying-jeou's
integrity, despite Ma's indictment  on charges of embezzling from
a special allowance fund while serving as Taipei mayor from 1998
to 2006.
</P>
<P>
"I also have confidence in the nation's judicial system," Wang
said when asked to comment on Ma's indictment.
</P>
<P>
Wang, who is a seen as a presidential hopeful and major rival to
Ma in the KMT's primary for the 2008 presidential election, also
said that he respects Ma's resignation from his post as KMT
chairman, as well as his decision to join the presidential race.
</P>
<P>
Wang indicated last weekend that he would not rule out the
possibility of taking part in the KMT presidential primary.
</P>
<P>
The anti-corruption  center  under  the Taiwan  High Court
Prosecutor's Office formally indicted Ma on charges that he
embezzled NT$11.17 million (US$337,650) from the mayoral special
allowance during his two mayoral terms.
</P>
<P>
Shortly afterwards, Ma professed his innocence at a press
conference and claimed that he had used the special allowance
fund according to the law.
</P>
<P>
Ma announced his resignation from the KMT chairmanship but vowed
that he will appeal to the people to clear his image by entering
the 2008 presidential race and vindicating his integrity "via
voter support" in the election.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Wang Hsin-nan, a legislator of the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP), urged DPP heavyweights seriously
considering their presidential bids to examine whether they used
their special allowance funds in the same way as Ma while serving
in their executive posts.
</P>
<P>
Wang said those DPP bigwigs who want to run in the 2008
presidential race should make sure they have no such problems
before declaring their candidacy, so that efforts by the party to
help them in their election campaigns will not be in vain.
