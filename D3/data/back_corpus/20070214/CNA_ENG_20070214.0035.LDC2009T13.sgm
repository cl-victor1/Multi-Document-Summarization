KMT HONORARY HEAD AGREES TO HELP ARRANGE PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDACY
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  Feb. 14 (CNA) 02/14/07  19:10:47 (By Flor Wang)

<P>
Main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Honorary Chairman Lien Chan
agreed Wednesday to help coordinate and bolster cooperation
between two key KMT members in the 2008 presidential election.
</P>
<P>
Speaking in a press release issued following a meeting with
acting Chairman Wu Po-hsiung and five KMT vice chairmen who
suggested that Lien help coordinate the presidential candidacy
within the party, Lien promised to assist in the matter and
called for joint efforts to serve that end.
</P>
<P>
"It may seem that the KMT is deeply mired in a crisis, but it
also presents a turning point in the party's transformation into
victory," Lien said.
</P>
<P>
Although Lien pledged to do his utmost to help forge cooperation
between former KMT Chairman Ma Ying-jeou and Legislative Yuan
Speaker Wang Jin-pyng in forming a ticket for the next
presidential election, he said, however, that Ma's announcement
of his presidential bid in the coming  presidential  race has
"narrowed"  the space  for coordination.
</P>
<P>
Ma delivered on his promise to resign from the KMT chairmanship
Tuesday after being indicted on corruption charges over his
alleged mishandling of a special municipal allowance when serving
as mayor of Taipei from 1998-2006.
</P>
<P>
In a special emergency meeting that evening, the KMT's Central
Standing Committee (CSC) returned Ma's resignation and rescinded
a special clause that bans indicted party members from running in
elections with the aim of bailing out Ma's participation in the
2008 presidential race as a KMT candidate.
</P>
<P>
Warning the KMT against flow-on effects of the clause's removal,
Lien asked Wu to get Ma and Wang to sit down and talk as soon as
possible, reiterating that "unity is essential if the KMT wants
to win in December's legislative election and regain power in the
2008 presidential polls."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Wang failed to agree to have a tete-a-tete with Ma in
the coming days, despite Lien's hope for a meeting with the two
men before the Feb. 18 Chinese New Year.
</P>
<P>
Instead, Wang urged the KMT to build a noble spirit to gain back
widespread public support.
