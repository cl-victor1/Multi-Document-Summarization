of the college said Wednesday.

Huang, chairman of the college's multimedia art design
department, was invited to paint artwork to celebrate the
ascension of Pope Benedict XVI in 2005. Having only pictures of
the pope from newspapers to work from, Huang spent two weeks
depicting the pope's expressions in three Chinese ink paintings.

Cardinal Paul Shan in Taiwan issued the certificate on behalf of
the pope to Huang in Kaohsiung, making Huang the first Chinese
artist to receive the certificate, the spokesman said.

The pontiff was very glad to receive Huang's gift and said Huang
made him look younger in the paintings. The pope plans to take
one painting back to his home in Germany, while one will go into
the Vatican Museum's collection, according to the spokesman.
