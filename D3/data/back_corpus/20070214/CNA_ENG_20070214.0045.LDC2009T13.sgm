A tulip exhibition opened at the National Museum of Natural
Science in Taichung Wednesday to coincide with Valentine's Day.
</P>
<P>
The flower show puts on display more than 60 varieties of tulips,
including the Darwin Hybrid group, the Triumph group and the
Lily-flowered group, in a great variety of colors.
</P>
<P>
Many of these tulip varieties  were brought  in from the
Netherlands and cultivated in Taiwan. The Netherlands exports
more tulips than any other country, supplying some 7 billion
bulbs worth roughly US$750 million a year.
</P>
<P>
Jack Damen, director of the Agricultural and Food Department in
the Netherlands Trade and Investment Office in Taiwan, gave a
lecture on the history of his country's tulip industry and the
international tulip trade.
</P>
<P>
He said the tulip is a symbol of caring, love and life, and that
to him personally, it is also a symbol of friendship because
through these flowers he has made many foreign friends eager to
know more about his country.
</P>
<P>
The tulip exhibition will continue until March 31 with related
activities held at the exhibition site, including a flower
painting contest and a lecture Feb. 28 on how to cultivate
bulbous plants.

Information about the exhibition and related activities can be
