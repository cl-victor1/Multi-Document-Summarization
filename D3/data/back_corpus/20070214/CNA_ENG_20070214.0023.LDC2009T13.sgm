National Penghu University (NPU) has made breakthroughs in pearl
cultivation techniques, facilitating the goal of making Penghu
County into the largest pearl farming base in the world, sources
at the university said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
NPU has been developing related techniques for three years, the
sources said, adding that impressed by the initial results,
Ichimura Co., based in Okinawa, Japan, has sought cooperation
with the university, with the two sides signing a memorandum of
understanding on cooperation last May.
</P>
<P>
Under the arrangement, NPU is to provide the latest cultivation
techniques of black lip shell and penguin shell -- two of the
common pearl shells, while Ichimura is to provide the business
know-how. Combining the experience of the two sides, as well as
the National Science Council's funding for research, they are
aiming to boost Penghu's pearl business, according to the
sources.

<P>
NPU professor Ueng Jinn-pyng said that after putting the research
achievements into practice, the cost of pearl production has been
significantly lowered, leading to increases in profits.
