A pro-Taiwan independence group called for debate among the
aspirants of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party for the 2008
presidential election in lieu of coordination to produce the
party's candidate.
</P>
<P>
The Taiwan Society said that coordination among the four DPP
aspirants -- Vice President Annette Lu, Premier Su Tseng-chang,
former Premier Frank Hsieh and DPP Chairman Yu Shyi-kun -- "might
be convenient, but it shows no respect for the people."
</P>
<P>
"If a fair and reasonable set of game rules are followed, then
those who fail to be nominated will accept the result gladly, "
the group claimed.
</P>
<P>
Group members said that they are planning to co-sponsor with the
media a public debate im March among the DPP presidential
hopefuls in which they can present their platforms and engage in
cross-debate.
</P>
<P>
Yu and Hsieh have expressed willingness to take part in such
debate, while Lu and Su have yet to confirm their participation,
society officials said.
</P>
<P>
Chin Heng-wei, a society member and TV commentator, said that
what really makes the DPP win is the voters, claiming that the
progress of democracy relies "on the system, not the people."
</P>
<P>
Chin claimed that the KMT currently only relies on one person, an
oblique allusion to the most likely presidential bet for the
party, former KMT Chairman Ma Ying-jeou.
</P>
<P>
Chin said that "the potential of the DPP is better than that of
the KMT, because the DPP can choose the best candidate through
exchanges of views between the voters and the party."
