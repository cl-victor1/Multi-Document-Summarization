</HEADLINE>

<P>
Taipei,  Feb.  14 (CNA) 02/14/07  17:56:46 (By Y.C. Jou)
</P>
<P>
The government is to issue six regional licenses for broadband
wireless access (BWA) services in the first part of a two-phase
licensing plan, the Executive Yuan announced Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The licenses, scheduled to be issued at the end of June, include
three each for the northern and southern halves of the country,
are valid for six years and can be renewed only once, the
Executive Yuan said, adding that the government is expected to
earn at least NT$1.26 billion (US$38.07 million) in license fees
over the first six years.
</P>
<P>
According to an agenda drawn up by the Cabinet-level National
Communications Commission (NCC) , the government will hold a
public hearing on the BWA regulations draft in March, establish
the regulations the same month, accept business applications in
April and May, and then complete application reviews and bidding
processes in June before giving out the licenses.
</P>
<P>
The northern BWA service region will include Taipei city and
county, Taoyuan County, Hsinchu city and county, Miaoli County,
Yilan County, Keelung City and Matsu islands, while the other
parts of the country go to the southern service region, the NCC
said.
</P>
<P>
Each regional licensee will be allocated a bandwidth of 30 MHz
within the international standard spectrum range of 2.5 - 2.69
GHz, and regional operators will be permitted to merge and
convert their regional licenses into a nationwide one, the NCC
said.
</P>
<P>
Two of the six licenses will be first reserved for new players
that are not running Type I Telecommunications Enterprise
services and will apply the 802.16e standard, unless no such
company wins a bid, NCC officials said. The Type I
Telecommunications Enterprise is referred to businesses that
provide telecommunications services with its own connection
facilities.
</P>
<P>
Bidders that combine services and manufacturing industries will
be better evaluated  during the application  review procedure,
according to the NCC.
</P>
<P>
In the bidding process that follows, qualified bidders will
compete with their offers of annual license fees, defined by a
percentage of their total annual revenues. Minimums for the
license fee are set at NT$20 million (US$ 604,318) for the first
year, NT$30 million for the second year and NT$40 million per
year from the third through the sixth year, the NCC said.
</P>
<P>
The Executive Yuan said in a news release that the issuance of
three licenses each in two regions will not only accommodate the
current needs of the business sector but will foster a healthy
competitive environment, provide multiple choices to consumers
and allow consumers to enjoy high-quality telecommunications
services.
</P>
<P>
The news release added that in the second phase of the project,
at least one additional nationwide license will be issued after
June 2009, depending on the progress of phase one mergers.
