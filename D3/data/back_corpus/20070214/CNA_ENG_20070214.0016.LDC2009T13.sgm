Taoyuan County-based Yuan Ze University has recently achieved a
breakthrough in the development of technologies for building
unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) for commercial use, the director
of a UAV development project at the university said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Wu Chang-huei, an associate professor at Yuan Ze University's
department of mechanical engineering, indicated that through the
UAV computer system his team has developed, an unamanned vehicle
can be made to automatically carry out various surveillance
missions simply by punching in the coordinates of the appointed
targets.

<P>
Wu noted that unmanned aircraft have been widely used to carry
out military missions for many years, but it has only been in
recent years that such vehicles have started to be developed for
civilian uses.
</P>
<P>
In 2006, the Environmental Protection Administration contracted
Yuan Ze to develop a commercial UAV system capable of performing
automatic flight by following satellite navigation signals, he
said.

With cameras, a UAV can also transfer images from the sky back to
the control headquarters on the ground, Wu said, adding that the
machine is useful for all kinds surveillance missions, including
monitoring pollution at sea and the traffic situation on roads
and highways. In addition, UAVs can be used for rescue missions
in difficult to reach locations, such as mountainous regions or
on the open seas.
</P>
<P>
Citing an unoffical estimate, Wu said military-use UAV production
is expected to reach US$3 billion annually over the next five
years, while civilian UAV production is forecast to reach US$600
million per year in the same period.
</P>
<P>
"The space for Taiwan to develop UAVs and relevant technologies
is unlimited," the expert said.
