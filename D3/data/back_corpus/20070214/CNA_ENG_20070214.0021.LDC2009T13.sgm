Taipei,  Feb.  14 (CNA) 02/14/07  16:08:42 (By Deborah Kuo)
</P>
<P>
Lin Chung-cheng, a former member of the Financial Supervisory
Commission (FSC) , was indicted Wednesday by Taipei prosecutors
who asked that he be sentenced to 16 years in prison on suspicion
of taking bribes from businessmen.
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors also sought a fine of NT$5 million (US$151,976) for
Lin's role in a case in which he is suspected of abusing his
power to prevent  the FSC from referring  several public
companies  to investigators for taking bids in return for
profits.
</P>
<P>
Lin, an academic-turned-politician who was a lawmaker appointed
by the ruling Democratic Progressive Party before being recruited
as a member of the country's supreme financial regulation body,
has been detained incommunicado  since last November by
prosecutors  on bribe-taking charges.
</P>
<P>
Lin's personal secretary, Su Chun-chi, who was also detained for
his reported role as Lin's proxy in dealing with businessmen, was
also indicted.
</P>
<P>
Chiu Mei-lan,  a legal counselor of the China Development
Financial Holding Corporation (CDFHC), which is one of the
companies alleged to have bribed Lin, was indicted with
prosecutors seeking a two-year sentence and a NT$1 million fine.
</P>
<P>
Eight others, including three CDFHC officials and five executives
of four securities firms, were released without being indicted
due to lack of evidence.
</P>
<P>
Seven other people, including a construction company owner and an
architect, were handed deferred prosecutions.
</P>
<P>
Lin's detention was the latest in a series of blows to the two-
year-old FSC, which has seen its former chief, Kong Jaw-sheng,
and former head of its Finance Examination Bureau, Lee Chincheng,
indicted separately on charges of corruption.
