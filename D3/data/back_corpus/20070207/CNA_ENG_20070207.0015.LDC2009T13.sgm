Taipei,  Feb.  7  (CNA) 02/07/07  16:58:08 (By Y.F. Low)

The concentration of arsenic in the atmosphere in central
Taichung City has skyrocketed since the inauguration of the
Central Taiwan Science Park, with a reading of as high as 37
nanograms per cubic meter detected in certain spots in the city,
according  to data  released  Wednesday  by the Taiwan
Environmental Protection Union (TEPU).
</P>
<P>
The data included the results of monitoring conducted by the
city's Environmental Protection Bureau and another laboratory
report obtained independently by the union.
</P>
<P>
The data shows that the arsenic concentration in the air
surrounding the science park soared from just 2.5 nanograms in
2005, when the park was still under construction, to 31 nanograms
in 2006, when some plants in the park had started mass
production.
</P>
<P>
While researchers detected arsenic concentrations of up to 37.4
nanograms at Tunghai University, another test conducted by the
Environmental Protection Bureau returned a reading of 27
nanograms.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the arsenic concentration in the air in the city's
Hsitun district registered 30 nanograms, much higher than the
concentration recorded in even severely polluted mining zones
around the world.
</P>
<P>
TEPU Chairwoman Hsu Kuang-jung noted that arsenic is a toxic
substance that can cause cancer and kill.
</P>
<P>
The carcinogenic risk registers 0.001 percent when the arsenic
concentration in the air stands at 2 nanograms, increasing to
0.01 percent when the concentration reaches 20 nanograms, Hsu
said.
</P>
<P>
The TEPU demanded that National Science Council Chairman Chen
Chien-jen and Taichung City Environmental Protection Bureau
Director Lee Li-teh step down to take responsibility for the
failure to prevent the pollution.
</P>
<P>
The council should also present a resolution for the problem in
30 days and punish manufacturers  responsible for the arsenic
emissions, TEPU officials said.
