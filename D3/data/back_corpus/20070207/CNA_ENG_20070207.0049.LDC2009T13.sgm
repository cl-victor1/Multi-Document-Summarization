The government is to spend NT$21.1 billion (US$641  million)
over ten years to build Taiwan's  national geographical
information system (GIS) , in order to spur on private sector
applications of this technology, a senior economic official
announced Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a news conference, Ho Mei-yueh, Chairwoman of the
cabinet-level Council for Economic Planning and Development
(CEPD) , said the integration of various geographical  data bases
held separately by different governmental agencies is needed.
</P>
<P>
These data won't contribute to industries if they are not
utilized, Ho said.The state has to establish an information
system, standardize it, and make it available to the private
sector for its use.
</P>
<P>
GIS is an important part of a knowledge-based economy, she added.
</P>
<P>
The CEPD hopes that governmental efforts on this project will
help create new businesses. For example, Ho said, people could
consult a GIS company to know whether the residence they are
considering buying is located on a fault.
</P>
<P>
She said the CEPD will serve as an integrator, reviewing
materials from separate governmental agencies to avoid
repetition, ensuring  compatibility  and increasing  the efficacy
of the geographical information.
</P>
<P>
Ho said other measures the government is considering to foster
GIS industries include establishing  a national space library,
training people to apply GIS knowledge as a secondary skill,
offering low-interest loans, subsidizing projects, setting up
venture capital, developing authentication mechanisms and so
forth.
