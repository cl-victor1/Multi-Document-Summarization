Taichung Mayor Jason Hu and his city government employees
answered a call by the Taichung Blood Center Wednesday for donors
to help relieve its current blood shortage.
</P>
<P>
The Taichung city government and the Taichung Blood Center
jointly held a blood donation drive in front of the city
government after the mayor learned of the shortage being
experienced by the center.
</P>
<P>
Hu was the first to roll up his sleeve to donate, leading fellow
employees waiting for their turn in a long queue.
</P>
<P>
Hu told the donors that he was grateful that his wife's life was
saved by an emergency surgery that required a transfusion of
20,000 c.c. of blood after she was seriously injured in a car
accident in November last year.
</P>
<P>
He said that he will be a "happy frequent blood donor" for the
rest of his life.

<P>
The Taiwan Blood Services Foundation has pointed out that the
Lunar New Year holiday beginning on Feb. 17 is a period when
blood centers throughout Taiwan are dogged by blood shortages,
which threaten the ability of hospitals to perform surgeries and
respond to emergencies.
</P>
<P>
To cope with the crisis, the foundation and its blood centers
have launched a month-long blood donation campaign from Jan. 16
to Feb. 16.
</P>
<P>
Experts at the foundation estimate that if everyone who is
eligible to donate blood did so twice a year, shortages at
Taiwan's blood centers would become a thing of the past.
