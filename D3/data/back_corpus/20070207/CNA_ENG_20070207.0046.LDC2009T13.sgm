Despite controversy arising from the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) Chairman Yu Shyu-kun's drive to change
the names of state-run companies, the government is poised to
promote the long-term goal of making Taiwan a normal country,
Executive Yuan spokesman Cheng Wen-tsan said Wednesday.

According to Cheng, the "rectifying the country's name" campaign
is a key task that the government will definitely do its utmost
to implement in pursuit of the nation's overall interests.

Meanwhile, Yu was slated to put forward his proposal on changing
the names of the state-owned enterprises that carry the term
"China" at the party's Central Standing Committee meeting later
the same day.

In addition to the name change drive, the DPP chairman was also
reportedly planning to suggest that the Executive Yuan
immediately withdraw both military and honor guards posted at the
temporary mausoleums of late presidents Chiang Kai-shek and his
son Chiang Ching-kuo during the party's weekly meeting.

<P>
Premier Su Tseng-chang said a day earlier that the government
will undoubtedly undertake any task beneficial to the nation
after thoroughly considering such matters.
