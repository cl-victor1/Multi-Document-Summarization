Fruit growers of Taichung County in central Taiwan have supplied
more than 340 metric tons of ponkan mandarin oranges to Singapore
and other Southeast Asian countries since mid-January, the
Tungshih  Farmers Association  indicated Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the association noted that with the Lunar New
Year holiday drawing near, ponkan mandarin oranges produced in
Taichung County, especially Tungshih township, are in great
demand, with Singapore, Malaysia and Indonesia being major
importers of the fruit.
</P>
<P>
He said such exports would not only bring increased revenues to
fruit farmers, but also help stabilize the price of the autumnal
fruit on the domestic market.
</P>
<P>
The ponkan mandarin orange is a favorite fruit for people in
Taiwan and other southeast Asian countries not only because it is
available in autumn and winter, but also because of its bright
color, sweet fragrance and taste, and ease in peeling.
</P>
<P>
Orchards in Tungshih township are best known for this fruit, and
produce more than 1,000 metric tons a year.
