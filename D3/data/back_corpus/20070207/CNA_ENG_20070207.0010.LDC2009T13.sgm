Touting his idea of civilian control of the military, President
Chen Shui-bian said Wednesday there are numerous civilian
candidates available who are qualified to be minister of national
defense.
</P>
<P>
Chen claimed that although he is reluctant to talk about his
contribution to the country, he has nurtured a lot of talent for
the country over the past several years.
</P>
<P>
For example, there are "more than half a dozen" aspirants in the
ruling Democratic Progressive Party who are interested in running
for the presidency in 2008, while there are "a truckload of"
civilian candidates who are qualified to be defense minister,
Chen said.
</P>
<P>
The president made the remarks while presiding over a changover
ceremony  in which  Chiou  I-jen  was  sworn  in as the new
secretary-general of the Presidential Office, replacing Tan Sun
Chen, who took over Chiou's previous post of National Security
Council secretary-general on the same occasion.
</P>
<P>
Chen has recently appointed Shi Hwei-yow, deputy director of the
National Security Bureau, as the intelligence agency's first
civilian head and expressed the hope that the principle of
civilian control of the military can be realized in the final
year of his term as president.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the issue Tuesday, Minister of National Defense Lee
Jye said that he hopes the goal can be achieved as soon as
possible and that he "can leave any time" if the president has
found a suitable person to replace him.
