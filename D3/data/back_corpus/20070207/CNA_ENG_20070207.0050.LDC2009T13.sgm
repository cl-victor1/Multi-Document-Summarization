HOLLAND URGED TO GRANT VISA-FREE PRIVILEGE TO TAIWAN TOURISTS

<P>
President Chen Shui-bian urged the Netherlands Wednesday to grant
visa-free privileges to Taiwanese tourists to further boost
bilateral civilian exchanges.
</P>
<P>
Chen made the call while meeting with Hans van Baalen, chairman
of the Dutch parliament's Foreign Affairs Committee, who arrived
in Taipei earlier this week for a visit.
</P>
<P>
Despite the absence of formal diplomatic ties, Chen said,
substantive relations between Taiwan and the Netherlands have
been close and cordial. Two-way trade reached US$6.6 billion last
year, making Holland Taiwan's second largest European trading
partner after Germany.
</P>
<P>
"There should much more room for bilateral trade to grow further
in the years to come," Chen said, adding that the Netherlands is
also Taiwan's biggest investor from Europe,  with accumulated
Dutch investment in Taiwan reaching US$8.88 billion at the end of
last year.
</P>
<P>
Chen lauded Baalen for his ardent efforts in the past years to
help promote friendly relations between Taiwan and the
Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
Among others,  Baalen initiated a resolution in the Dutch
parliament in December 2003 on opposing the European Union to
lift its arms embargo against China. Through his strenuous
effort, the resolution cleared the Dutch parliamentary floor. In
the following year, the Netherlands took up the E.U. presidency
and used its diplomatic leverage to prevent the bloc from
removing its arms ban against China.
</P>
<P>
In October 2005, Baalen again used its political clout to have
the Dutch parliament pass a resolution throwing support behind
Taiwan's bid to join the World Health Assembly -- the World
Health Organization's governing body -- as an observer.
</P>
<P>
"Neither of these achievements came easily. We are grateful for
your kind- hearted assistance with our national cause, " Chen
told Baalen during their meeting at the Presidential Office.
</P>
<P>
Noting that there is still ample room for Taiwan-Dutch ties to
grow, Chen galvanized Baalen to continue assisting in promoting
substantive relations. Tasks in this regard include pushing the
Dutch executive branch to take concrete actions to substantiate
support for Taiwan's WHO bid, offer visa-free entry for Taiwanese
tourists and advocate the formation of a pro-Taiwan subgroup in
the Dutch parliament.
