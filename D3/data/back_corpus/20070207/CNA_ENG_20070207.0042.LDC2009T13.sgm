Taipei,  Feb.  7 (CNA) 02/07/07  21:13:09 (By T.C. Jiang)

Taiwan might launch a sports lottery next March, a National
Council on Physical Fitness and Sports (NCPFS) official said
Wednesday after Premier Su Tseng-chang vowed a day earlier to
eradicate domestic baseball-related scandals.
</P>
<P>
Council Vice Chairman Chen Yu-hsin said that last year, the NCPFS
submitted a plan for the sports lottery to the Ministry of
Finance, which he said is likely to announce public bidding
following the Chinese New Year holiday that starts Feb. 17.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, the official launch of the lottery might take
another year, he added.
</P>
<P>
Chen's remarks came after Su made the vow during a meeting with
Chao Shou-po, chairman of the Chinese Professional Baseball
League (CPBL) , and representatives of Taiwan's six professional
baseball teams.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting, the premier instructed Finance Minister Ho Chih-
chin to step up the launch of the sports lottery, which is
expected to help stem illegal gambling on local professional
baseball games and generate money to finance domestic sports.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the premier ordered the National Police Agency and the
Bureau of Investigation to take measures to prevent gangsters
from interfering with local professional baseball games again.
</P>
<P>
There have been three baseball scandals involving organized crime
in 1996, 2005, and 2006, respectively, which have caused the
number of people attending games to drop from 1.05 million to
670,000 within the past five years, according to Su.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Su requested that Ho grant tax breaks to six
business groups that have long sponsored local baseball, while
ordering  the Ministry  of Economic Affairs to ask state-run
enterprises to form a baseball team.
</P>
<P>
In related news, Joseph Tsai, director-general of the Finance
Ministry's National Treasury Agency, remarked that despite the
NCPFS's plan, the ministry needs to further discuss with the
Executive Yuan the establishment of supplementary measures and a
monitoring mechanism.
