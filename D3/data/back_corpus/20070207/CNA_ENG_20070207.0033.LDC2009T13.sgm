DPP HEAD DEFENDS NAME CHANGE DRIVE
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  Feb.  7 (CNA) 02/07/07  19:45:44 (By Flor Wang)
</P>
<P>
Ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) Chairman Yu Shyi-kun
defended Wednesday his proposed "desinicization moves" amid
rampant speculation on why he raised the proposals at this
particular time.
</P>
<P>
In response to the speculation on why he proposed a name change
for some state- run companies and a withdrawal of military guards
posted at the mausoleums of the late presidents Chiang Kai-shek
and Chiang Ching-kuo now, Yu, displaying an official document,
argued that he asked in January 2005, while serving as premier,
that task forces be set up in relevant government agencies to
promote a name change of public enterprises that carry "China" in
their titles.
</P>
<P>
But Yu was reserved when asked by reporters whether it was his
successor, former Premier Frank Hsieh, who failed to continue
carrying out the mission.
</P>
<P>
Yu also ascribed the 228 Incident in 1947 to Chiang Kai-shek,
whom pro- independence activists say is the main culprit behind
the tragedy, in which thousands of Taiwan's elite were murdered
by Kuomintang  (KMT)  troops in the initial  stage of the KMT's
authoritarian rule of Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Yu was also reportedly planning to propose at the DPP's Central
Standing Committee meeting later that same day that the
government remove all Chiang statues from military barracks
around the country and pull all military guards stationed at the
two late presidents' temporary mausoleums in northern Taoyuan
county.
</P>
<P>
Yu will also ask KMT Chairman Ma Ying-jeou to make a vow Feb. 28
that he will stop paying his respects to the two late presidents
at their mausoleums.
</P>
<P>
Yu's series of proposals provoked criticism from the opposition
"pan-blue alliance" and stirred up allegations within the DPP, in
particular from pro- Hsieh lawmakers, as to whether his moves
were aimed at outgunning other DPP aspirants vying for the
party's nomination to run in the 2008 presidential election,
including Hsieh, Vice President Annette Lu and Premier Su Tseng-
chang.
</P>
<P>
DPP lawmaker Wang Hsing-nan, however, voiced his support for Yu's
proposal to relocate statues of Chiang and his son, pointing out
that many Taiwan people have no respect for the two late
dictators.
</P>
<P>
Wang hailed Yu's statue relocation idea and argued that it is not
the government's obligation to finance the maintenance of the two
Chiangs' tombs and that providing finance in fact lacks any legal
basis according to the law.
</P>
<P>
DPP lawmaker Cheng Yun-peng, a Hsieh protege, claimed that Yu
should  first quit  the chairmanship  if he wants  to start
electioneering for the 2008 presidency.
</P>
<P>
Cheng said that he agrees with the statue relocation idea but
contended that the DPP head should have discussed the issue with
the Legislative Yuan and should have allowed the Executive Yuan
to make the announcement instead of the party central.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, KMT legislative caucus members accused Yu of seeking
to cement "deep green" voter support by airing the comments.
</P>
<P>
KMT legislative whip Hsu Shao-ping argued that both the military
and honor guards at the mausoleums must not be removed because
they are one of Taiwan's major tourist attractions.
</P>
<P>
KMT lawmaker Alex Fei urged Yu to "stop rubbing salt into wounds"
by rehashing these historic issues, and said that the DPP
chairman did this to jockey for a position in the DPP aimed at
the next presidential election.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a Legislative Yuan news conference, Lee Hung-chun,
spokesman for the opposition People First Party (PFP) in the
"pan-blue alliance, " accused the DPP of attempting to launch a
"cultural revolution" in Taiwan in a covert move to "conceal its
fear of declaring formal Taiwan independence."
</P>
<P>
Lee also blasted Minister of National Defense Lee Jye for "having
no guts" in yielding to DPP pressure and for having agreed to
remove a total of 228 statues of the two former presidents from
military barracks on Feb. 28.
</P>
<P>
PFP legislative caucus whip Cheng Chin-ling and PFP lawmaker Liu
Wen-hsiung demanded that Lee Jye immediately step down.
