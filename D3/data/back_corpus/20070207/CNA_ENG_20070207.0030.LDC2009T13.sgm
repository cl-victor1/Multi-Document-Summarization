An investigation by the Department of Health (DOH) of 1,148 meat
suppliers and vendors around the country has turned up no signs
of pork from sick and dead hogs, a DOH official said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The DOH mobilized every city and county health bureau from Feb. 1
to investigate the meat suppliers and vendors,  including 240
pork-processing factories, 402 restaurants and 506 traditional
market vendors.
</P>
<P>
Bureau of Food Sanitation Director Cheng Huei-wen pointed out
that it takes time to find illegally butchered pork because the
illegal slaughterhouses discovered so far have produced only
around 5,000 kg of pork, while around 2.8 million kg is consumed
daily.
</P>
<P>
Restaurants near universities were the investigation's key point,
but no evidence of tainted meat was found.
</P>
<P>
Cheng reminded consumers to check for the CAS logo on the skin of
good quality pork and to be aware of pork selling for extremely
low prices or without skin.
</P>
<P>
Those caught selling pork from sick or dead pigs face fines of
between NT$30,000 (US$909) and NT$150,000, Cheng said.
