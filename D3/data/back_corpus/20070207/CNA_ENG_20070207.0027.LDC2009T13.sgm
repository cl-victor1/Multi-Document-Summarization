<P>
The global market for digital mandarin Chinese learning will be
worth some US$60 billion in five years, officials from the
Council for Economic Planning and Development (CEPD) predicted
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
CEPD officials urged Taiwan businessmen and companies to grasp
the opportunity of a rising Chinese-learning fad worldwide to
make money out of the trend.
</P>
<P>
The officials quoted a survey conducted by the Summer Institute
of Linguistics (SIL) International as indicating that among the
world's 6,809 languages in use, mandarin is currently the
language with the greatest number of speakers.
</P>
<P>
About 14.8 percent of the world's population, or roughly 885
million people, speak mandarin as their mother tongue or second
language, compared to 400 million people who speak English as
their mother tongue or second language, officials said.
</P>
<P>
It was assessed that about 1 million mandarin teachers will be
needed worldwide to meet the demand arising from the Chinese-
learning fad. Currently, nevertheless, there are only about
100,000 mandarin teachers working.
</P>
<P>
The evident shortages has resulted in a huge need for digital
mandarin teaching materials, the officials said.
