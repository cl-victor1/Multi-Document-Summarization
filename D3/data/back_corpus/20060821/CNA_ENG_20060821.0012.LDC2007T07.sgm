ICBC NAME CHANGE DRAWS CRITICISM

Taipei,   Aug.   21  (CNA) (By Deborah Kuo)
</P>
<P>
The official designation of the International Commercial Bank of China
(ICBC) is scheduled to be changed to Mega International Commercial
Bank Monday, drawing criticism from opponents of the move.
</P>
<P>
Cheng Shen-chi, chairman of Mega Holdings Co., which recently merged
with ICBC -- one of the oldest and most reputable banks in Taiwan --
is scheduled to make the announcement on the name change Monday
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Criticizing the planned name change of the century-old bank,
opposition Kuomintang Legislator Fei Hung-tai said he suspects Cheng
is making the move as part of efforts to materialize President Chen
Shui-bian's goal of "desinicizing" public-run organizations in Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a news conference held at the Legislative Yuan, Fei lashed
out at the Ministry of Finance for defying a resolution passed by the
Finance Committee of the Legislative Yuan May 29 demanding that the
finance ministry submit to the Legislative Yuan an assessment report
on the impact of the name change before actually going through with
it.
</P>
<P>
Fei said that the name change should be stopped and that Cheng should
be fired by the board of directors of Mega Holdings -- in which the
government holds a majority stake -- for dereliction of duty.
</P>
<P>
Fei threatened to block the budget for the finance ministry in the
legislature's next session which begins in September if Mega Holdings'
board of directors does not elect a new chairman to replace Cheng.
</P>
<P>
Also speaking at the news conference, Tsai Chiu-fa, a leader of the
ICBC Workers' Union, said the government "has treated the feelings of
the 3,400 workers of ICBC and their interests as dirt" by rashly
moving to change the name of the bank which was established more than
100 hundred years ago.
