The reconstruction of the late President Chiang Kai-shek's first
official residence in Taiwan will not be a problem, but finding
the right kind of cypress and the original Japanese tiles will be
difficult, an emergency response panel said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The panel, which comprises structural specialist Tsai Teh-shin
and Lee Chung- yao, an authority on historical relics and
heritage site restoration, visited the wreckage of the Grass
Mountain Chateau on Yangmingshan in suburban Taipei, which was
badly damaged during a fire earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
The panel estimated that the cost of the reconstruction will be
between NT$30 million (US$909,000) and NT$50 million and will
take about two years to complete.
</P>
<P>
Tsai said that cinders from the fire will have to be collected
and preserved. In addition, the issue of fire and earthquake
prevention will have to be taken into consideration.
</P>
<P>
Lee, a traditional architectural restoration master who played a
leading role in the building's first large-scale face-lift a few
years ago, said he was saddened to see the fire-ravaged site, but
as the original design has been kept, "it will be no problem to
restore it to its original form, " although the methods and
skills will have to be studied.
</P>
<P>
He noted that there is dirt, wood and lime in Taiwan, but
Japanese tiles are no longer produced here. The wooden structure
of the original building employed mainly Taiwan cypress and
whether to use Taiwan cypress or foreign cypress -- which is
three or four times more expensive -- will be up to the Taipei
city government to decide, he added.
</P>
<P>
Lee Yung-ping, director of the city government's Department of
Cultural Affairs, claimed that the fire was most likely caused by
arson. Police are still investigating if the Buddhist Fo Kuang
University, which has been commissioned by the city government to
manage the site since 2002, is guilty of negligence or
dereliction of duty.
</P>
<P>
Lee also said the department has erected pickets around the
building to bar trespassers prior to the reconstruction work.
</P>
<P>
The bureau will film the building materials and structure,
restoration and reconstruction process in a documentary, Lee
added. All badly burned materials, as well as the wreckage, will
be kept for display for future generations to learn about the
importance of preserving heritage sites, she added.
</P>
<P>
The style of the 660-square-meter main building of the chateau,
on an estate covering about 1,815 square meters, is typical of
Japanese architecture of the 1920s. The wall of the entrance to
the main building is made of stone, with a Japanese wooden
structure inside.
</P>
<P>
The April 7 fire destroyed more than half of the main building,
with the wooden interior being completely burnt. The stone wall
remains intact. Total damage is estimated at roughly NT$36
million.
</P>
<P>
The city government listed the building as a protected heritage
site in 2002 and it has since served as a cultural activity
center that encompasses  an exhibition  hall,  a small  showroom,
a multifunction auditorium, a performance area, a semi-open air
coffee shop and a management center.  The midnight fire damaged
the exhibition hall, known as Meilu Hall, and the coffee shop,
known as Yingho Hall.
