A Taiwanese delegation visited Vietnam Prime Minister Nguyen Tan
Dung Wednesday to solicit his country's support for Taiwan's
participation in regional economic integration, an official of
the Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) said Thursday.

Deputy Economics Minister Hsieh Fadah, who is part of the
delegation organized by the Taipei-based Chinese National
Association of Industry and Commerce, was quoted as having said
the delegation has explained to Nguyen Taiwan's economic
development and the challenges it faces in getting involved with
regional integration.

The delegation expressed hope that Vietnam will help Taiwan to be
included in the integration and support the concept of a Free
Trade Area of the Asia-Pacific (FTAAP) proposed to the Asia-
Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum, Hsieh said.

<P>
Taiwan is the largest foreign investor in Vietnam, but this will
be affected  if Taiwan is not included  in regional economic
integration.

The delegation said Taiwan would like to keep its investment in
Vietnam, an idea that was welcomed by Nguyen, said Hsieh.
