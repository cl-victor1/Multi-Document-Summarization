PFP LAWMAKERS MAY BE ABSENT FROM VOTE ON KEY BILLS

Taipei,  April 19 (CNA) 04/19/07  21:59:52 (By Flor Wang)

Despite a keen desire on the part of the Kuomintang (KMT) that
they join forces in a vote Friday on two key bills in a
legislative committee, People First Party (PFP) lawmakers said
Thursday that they may absent themselves from the vote if the KMT
fails to keep its promise regarding upcoming elections.
</P>
<P>
PFP legislative caucus whip Feng Ting-kuo made the comments after
the KMT issued a call earlier the same day urging PFP lawmakers
to attend the Procedure Committee meeting and help their KMT
peers defeat two key draft bills that are of great concern to the
KMT.
</P>
<P>
The two bills, initiated by the ruling Democratic Progressive
Party (DPP) , target the main opposition KMT's assets and could
rule out former KMT Chairman Ma Ying-jeou's presidential bid.
They were successfully placed on the committee's agenda Monday
during the absence of PFP and Non-Partisan Solidarity Union
lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
According to Feng, the matter is simple, so long as the KMT lives
up to its promise to allot to the PFP 10 regional and three at-
large seats in December's legislative elections.
</P>
<P>
"Should the KMT honor its promise, there will be room for the PFP
to alter its decision," Feng said.
</P>
<P>
PFP lawmaker Wu Ching-chih called on the KMT to stop trying to
deceive his party, and voiced his discontent, asking how the KMT
could turn a blind eye to the agreement reached late last year
with the PFP.
</P>
<P>
An unidentified PFP lawmaker said that they might not attend the
meeting, or might not vote, if the KMT refuses to honor its
pledge.
</P>
<P>
"All PFP legislators will act in concert regarding Friday's vote
in the Procedure Committee, based on a consensus that will be
reached that same day by the central committee," he said.
</P>
<P>
KMT officials, including Secretary-General Wu Duen-yih, and
legislative caucus whip Hsu Shao-ping, are still pinning their
hopes on the PFP and called for continued cooperation at this
critical moment despite apparent rows arising from the upcoming
elections.
