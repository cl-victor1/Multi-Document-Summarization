JOINING WHO UNDER NAME 'TAIWAN' IS WILL OF THE PEOPLE: MINISTER

Taipei,  April  19 (CNA) 04/19/07  14:58:14 (By Lilian Wu)

Joining the World Health Organization (WHO) under the name
"Taiwan" is the will of the people of Taiwan, with 95 percent of
the population supporting the idea, Minister of Foreign Affairs
(MOFA) James Huang said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Huang made the remarks while attending a book presentation by the
Taiwan International Health Action, a government-funded
organization set up to provide medical assistance to Taiwan's
diplomatic allies.
</P>
<P>
No matter how difficult the bid for WHO membership might be,
Huang vowed to make every effort to let other countries know
through Taiwan's diplomatic allies and other channels that it is
wrong to shut Taiwan out of the health organization.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the government has for the past decade humbly bid
to join the WHO as an observer, which the United States and Japan
has supported, and to "participate in a meaningful way" in the
WHO's activities, as suggested by European countries, but both
approaches have proven unsuccessful due to China's obstruction.
</P>
<P>
Since China signed a memorandum with the WHO in 2005, which
allows China to have the final say on Taiwan's interactions with
the organization, the situation has become even worse, Huang
noted.
</P>
<P>
Meaningful participation has been suggested by some countries as
meaning the opportunity for Taiwan to participate in as many WHO-
related meetings as possible, regardless of its official title or
the circumstances, he said.
</P>
<P>
However, he continued, permission for experts from Taiwan to
attend even meetings on technical issues has consistently been
denied or delayed.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan has become even more marginalized, and this is why it has
decided to push for membership under the name "Taiwan," Huang
said.
</P>
<P>
WHO Director-General Margaret Chan, in a recent interview with
CNN, said the WHO's "193 member states still hold on very
strongly to the one China principle".
