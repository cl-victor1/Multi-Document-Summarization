Although the total number of incidents at schools and
universities nationwide was down in 2006, the number of reported
cases of on-campus bullying was on the rise, according to
statistics released Thursday by the Ministry of Education (MOE).
</P>
<P>
MOE statistics showed that a total of 14,638 incidents were
reported last year at all levels of educational facilities around
the country, down by 1,190 cases from the 2005 figure. However,
the number of incidents involving security maintenance, violence
and misconduct accounted for 21.2 percent of the total, or 3,116
cases, which marked a 6.4 percent growth year on year.

<P>
Twenty-nine students were killed last year due to on-campus
bullying, harassment, extortion, robbery or running away from
home, while 1,097 were injured, MOE tallies indicated.
</P>
<P>
Accidents remained the main cause of student deaths on campus
last year, with 648 killed and 7,420 wounded.
</P>
<P>
The recent shooting that killed more than 30 students and staff
by a South Korean student at Virginia Tech in the United States
has shocked the entire world, prompting the MOE to stay on high
alert against violence on campus.
</P>
<P>
According to officials from the MOE's Bureau of Students Military
Training, the ministry has for some time been running a series of
programs aimed at reinforcing order and security at all levels of
schools, including the establishment of a contingency monitoring
and reporting system.
