Taipei, April 19 (CNA) 04/19/07  19:57:55 (By Lilian Wu)

<P>
The Supreme Court upheld Thursday a ruling of the Taiwan High
Court that former President Lee Teng-hui should apologize to
James Soong, chairman of the opposition People First Party, and
compensate him for defamation.
</P>
<P>
The Supreme Court ruled that Lee should run apology ads in three
local newspapers for one day and pay NT$2 million (US$60,600) in
compensation.
</P>
<P>
At issue is Lee's insinuation in a public speech that Soong was
playing mahjong with friends April 10, 2004 while his followers
were fighting with police in a street protest against President
Chen Shui-bian's re-election victory the previous month.
</P>
<P>
Soong filed a defamation suit and the Taipei District Court ruled
in November 2005 that Lee should compensate Soong NT$10 million
and run ads in nine local newspapers to apologize to him.
</P>
<P>
The Taiwan High Court ruled in August 2006 that as a former
national leader, Lee should know his remarks carry weight, but
his insinuation of Soong turning back on his supporters to play
mahjong led the public to see Soong as an irresponsible
politician, causing him "great emotional distress" and therefore
deserving of compensation.
</P>
<P>
As compensation in previous defamation suits have not exceeded
NT$3 million, the high court slashed the amount from NT$10
million to NT$2 million.
</P>
<P>
In view that the case has been widely publicized, the high court
also ruled that the request for running apology ads for three
consecutive days in nine local newspapers, which would cost an
estimated NT$13 million, should be cut to one day ads on the
front pages of three national newspapers.
