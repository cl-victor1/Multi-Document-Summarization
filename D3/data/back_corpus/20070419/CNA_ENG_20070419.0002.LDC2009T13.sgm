Former South African Archbishop Desmond Mpilo Tutu arrived in
Taiwan Wednesday for a week-long visit at the invitation of the
Taiwan Foundation for Democracy.
</P>
<P>
Tutu, who rose to worldwide fame during the 1980s as an opponent
of apartheid and won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1984, said he will
take in the latest developments in Taiwan and exchange views with
local friends on a range of topics of mutual interest, including
political and economic affairs and ethnic harmony.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, Tutu will visit Machangting, a former execution
ground for political prisoners adjacent to the present-day Youth
Park in western Taipei, and 228 Peace Memorial Park in downtown
Taipei where he will meet with family members of the victims of
the infamous 228 Incident, an uprising in Taiwan that began Feb.
28, 1947 and was suppressed by the then-Kuomintang government,
resulting in the killing of thousands of civilians.
</P>
<P>
Tutu is set to meet Friday with Vice President Annette Lu, who
was imprisoned for nearly six years for her pro-democracy
activities during Taiwan's martial law era. Later that day, he
will travel to the southern port city of Kaohsiung via the high-
speed rail line.
</P>
<P>
Tutu will deliver a speech April 24 on South Africa's experiences
in seeking transitional justice and ethnic reconciliation
following the end of apartheid. As head of South Africa's  Truth
and Reconciliation Commission, Tutu has played a leading role in
his country's post-apartheid campaign to heal historical wounds
and boost ethnic harmony.
