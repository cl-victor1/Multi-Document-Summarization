A novel fire-resistant insulation material,  developed by
Taiwan's Industrial Technology Research Institute (ITRI) , has
made its debut at the ongoing Hanover Messe trade fair,  the
institute's Europe branch in Berlin reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The new material, named Reddex,  has strong fire-resistant
ability, ITRI officials stationed in Berlin said, adding that
even at temperatures of 1,000 degrees Celsius, it can still
maintain a back-side temperature of about 300 degrees C for over
60 minutes, without either drip-melt or break-up.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, they noted, eco-friendly Reddex contains neither
halogens  nor phosphorous,  both of which are widely used in
traditional insulation materials, therefore it produces no toxic
particles when exposed to flames. Steam is the only by-product,
they added.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the ITRI officials said, the smoke density released
by Reddex is only 2.0, only one 1 percent of a safe ceiling of
200.
</P>
<P>
According to the officials, Reddex has been successfully applied
to awide range of products, including paint, coating, paste,
film, hoses, coated fabric and other protective insulation used
in vehicles and buildings.

The Hanover Messe, started in 1947, has become the largest
industrial fair in the world. It is held annually at the Hanover
fairground, with the participation of about 6,000 exhibitors and
200,000 visitors per year.
