KMT LAWMAKERS IN FULL GEAR TO BLOCK TWO KEY BILLS

Taipei,  April 19 (CNA) 04/19/07  17:30:24 (By Flor Wang)

<P>
The main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) has gone into full gear to
mobilize party lawmakers in the hope of blocking two key draft
bills of great concern to its future in a legislative committee
meeting Friday.
</P>
<P>
Tseng Yung-chuan, director of the KMT's Policy Coordination
Committee, said that all party lawmakers have been notified that
they must attend the Procedure Committee meeting Friday, in which
two bills regarding the handling of the KMT's assets and the
banning of convicted individuals from future presidential
elections are on the agenda.
</P>
<P>
The two bills, targeting the KMT's assets and its former
chairman, Ma Ying-jeou, who is making a strong presidential bid,
were put on the committee's agenda Tuesday as a result of the
absence of lawmakers of the People First Party (PFP) and the Non-
Partisan Solidarity Union (NPSU) to block the move.
</P>
<P>
Tseng said he has confidence that with cooperation from PFP and
NPSU lawmakers, they will be able to reject the two draft bills
in a concerted move in the Friday meeting. The KMT has been
mediating with the PFP and the NPSU on the matter, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Despite Tseng's call for PFP and NPSU collaboration, it remains
unclear whether the two parties will join KMT efforts in killing
the two bills. The PFP, in particular, has been at loggerheads
with the KMT due to rows arising from the May 12 by-election for
Keelung mayor and December's legislative elections, even though
the two parties set up a new alliance in January that was
supposed to step up cooperation in coming elections.
</P>
<P>
In response to the KMT's keen desire that PFP lawmakers help
block the two bills, PFP legislative caucus whip Fu Kun-chi said
that seven or eight PFP legislators have gone abroad and that he
is not sure whether they will return home to attend the Friday
meeting.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Fu also said that the "PFP will not make it so that
Ma misses the chance to run in the 2008 presidential race " and
added that the PFP will hold a meeting later Thursday to discuss
how to deal with the situation in Friday's Procedure Committee
meeting.
