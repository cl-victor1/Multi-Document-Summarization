MINIMUM WAGE TO BE RAISED IN SECOND HALF OF YEAR: CLA CHIEF
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Washington, April 18 (CNA) 04/19/07  16:12:51 (By Michelle Tsai
and Sofia Wu)
</P>
<P>
Taiwan's minimum wage will be adjusted in the second half of this
year, probably July 1, to make it more commensurate with Taiwan's
general economic situation and consumer price index, a visiting
labor official said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Council of Labor Affairs Chairman Lee Ying-yuan, who is visiting
Washington, D.C. to lobby for support for Taiwan's drive to sign
a free trade agreement with the United States, made the remarks
while meeting with Taiwanese journalists stationed in the U.S.
capital over a cup of tea.
</P>
<P>
After  extensive  consultations  with major industrial  and
commercial associations, labor unions, and academic groups, Lee
said a consensus has been forged for a measured adjustment of the
country's minimum wage, which has been frozen at NT$15,840
(US$480) per month, or NT$66 per hour for a decade.
</P>
<P>
In view of the more than 50 percent growth in Taiwan's gross
domestic product (GDP) for the past 10 years, Lee said, the
minimum wage should be raised appropriately to let all wage
earners enjoy the fruits of economic growth.
</P>
<P>
The planned adjustment is tentatively set for implementation in
the second half of this year, Lee said, adding that July 1 is the
most favored starting day. But he added that the exact timing for
the implementation  can  be  readily  changed based  on practical
considerations.
</P>
<P>
As to the adjustment range, Lee said, a combination of factors,
including the increase in the average consumer price index over
the past decade, Taiwan's general economic growth as well as the
possible adverse impact on local industries' competitiveness,
should be taken into consideration when deciding on the level of
the minimum wage increase.
</P>
<P>
While the business community has declared that 5 percent is the
maximum level they are willing to accept for an upward
adjustment, labor groups want a far larger hike, Lee said, adding
that he once proposed at a Legislative Yuan session that the
minimum wage be raised to 40 percent of the average salary of all
workers in the country. If adopted, the minimum wage would be
increased to NT$17,600 per month, representing a hike of 11
percent over the current level.
</P>
<P>
"Anyway, many elements should be taken into account, and the
final adjustment figure should be announced by the premier
himself, " Lee said.
</P>
<P>
Noting that under Taiwan's new portable pension system adopted
some two years ago, employers are required to deposit a monthly
pension reserve fund equivalent to 6 percent of an employee's
salary, Lee said, the measure is to some extent tantamount to
offering a pay raise. "This element should also be taken into
consideration when deciding the minimum wage adjustment range,"
he added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Lee said Taiwan could refer to the past U.S. practice
in basic wage adjustment in which its minimum wage was raised by
7.25 percent in three stages during a 26-month interval.
</P>
<P>
Lee arrived in the U.S. capital Sunday for an FTA-lobbying visit,
during  which he has met with Bush administration  officials,
congressional leaders and think tank scholars to brief them on
Taiwan's labor policies and welfare services as part of his
efforts to clear the way for signing a bilateral free trade pact.
He will wrap up his visit Thursday.
