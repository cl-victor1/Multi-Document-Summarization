Taiwan fishermen must immediately stop catching whale sharks on
the high seas as the number of the fish caught by local fishermen
has hit an annual ceiling, officials at the Fisheries Agency
under the Cabinet-level Council of Agriculture said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
According to agency officials, Taiwan fishermen have caught 30
whale sharks since the beginning of this year, reaching the
annual quota imposed by the international fishing community on
the country for the whole of 2007.
</P>
<P>
From now on, fishermen must release all whale sharks they catch,
alive or dead, and are banned from selling, possessing or
disposing of the fish's meat starting from June 27, the officials
said.
</P>
<P>
Those who violate the regulations will receive a jail term up to
three years, they pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Fishermen are also required to report to the Fisheries Agency and
local fisheries authorities at once if they set free a live whale
shark in order to help establish a biological data bank on the
world's largest fish and shark, they said.
