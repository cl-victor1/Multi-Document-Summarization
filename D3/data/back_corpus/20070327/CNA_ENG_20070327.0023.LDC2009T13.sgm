Taichung Mayor Jason Hu expressed satisfaction Tuesday with his
six-day tour of Japan before leaving for home.
</P>
<P>
Hu has received positive responses from Yasuchika Negoro, head of
the Nippon Professional Baseball (NPB) leagues organization, and
NPB Secretary General Kazuo Hasegawa, to proposals of further
exchanges between the baseball organizations of the central
Taiwan city and Japan, Hu said.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Hu revealed that he had also invited Japanese
professional baseball teams to conduct their seasonal training at
the new Intercontinental Baseball Stadium in Taichung City,
inaugurated last November.
</P>
<P>
Hu said as he had only expected to meet Hasegawa -- who visited
his city last year to check on the new baseball stadium -- during
his stay in Tokyo, but was pleasantly surprised when he learned
that Negoro also wanted to meet him in person. This "meant they
attached importance to the visit," the mayor noted.
</P>
<P>
Speaking of the Intercontinental Baseball Stadium, Hu pointed out
that the facility is expected to be available for professional
training by the end of next year, adding he will dispatch a group
of experts to Okinawa -- the most popular place among Japanese
baseball teams for training programs -- to inspect its facilities
and equipment.
</P>
<P>
Hu arrived in Fukuoka March 23 to begin his Japanese tour, where
he visited Sadaharu Oh, a renowned Japan-based professional
baseball manager of Chinese descent and won the celebrity's
promise to serve as the spokesman for the 2007 Baseball World
Cup, slated for November in Taichung.
</P>
<P>
Hu traveled from Fukuoka to Tokyo on March 25, from where he flew
back to Taiwan after touring the Tokyo Dome.
