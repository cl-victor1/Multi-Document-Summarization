Local college students garnered 33 out of 36 awards at an
international micro- robot contest held last week in Japan,
setting the highest record in the decade- long history of the
event, a spokesman for Da Yeh University said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The remarks came after the university, located in the central
county of Changhua, held a press conference to display the coin-
sized robots that earned such success for the school.
</P>
<P>
Pan Tien-tsi, a professor at the university who trained the
students who took part, noted the event has been held for 18
years in Japan and added that this year marked the first time the
event had been raised to the international level.
</P>
<P>
This year, participants from more than 200 foreign teams were
required to design robots smaller than those entered in last
year's competition, which presented an even more difficult task,
Pan pointed out.
</P>
<P>
The Taiwanese students used last year's experience and innovation
to successfully beat the other contestants, Pan continued.
</P>
<P>
Chiu Kun-chi, a doctoral student at the university, said that
last year, they took three top prizes, which apparently surprised
the Japanese organizers.
</P>
<P>
This year, the Japanese said they were "shocked," Chiu said with
a smile.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan's victory shows that Japan needs two or three years to be
able to surpass Taiwan in this field, a Japanese professor said.
</P>
<P>
Chen Ching-shun, another professor at Da-Yeh University, revealed
that quite a few companies have expressed interest in working
with the university to mass produce the micro-robots.
</P>
<P>
However,  the university plans to develop the robots into
"cleaning robots" for home use, he said, adding that the school
will then apply for patents before collaborating with
manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
In the future, the robots could also be used in medical,
industrial and military applications, Chen said.
