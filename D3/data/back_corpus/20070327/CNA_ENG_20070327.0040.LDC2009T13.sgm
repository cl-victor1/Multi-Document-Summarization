The 2007 Taipei International Cycle Show ended Tuesday, with this
year's number of foreign buyers showing an increase of 11 percent
over last year, according to a spokesman for the Taiwan External
Trade Development Council (TAITRA).

<P>
Yieh Ming-shuei, TAITRA's deputy secretary-general, said this
year's show had more than 40,000 buyers, 3,939 of whom were from
foreign countries. The five countries with the most buyers were
the United States, Japan, South Korea, Germany and China,
although numbers from countries in other areas such as the Middle
East and Southeast Asia also increased.
</P>
<P>
Foreign buyers were impressed by the Taiwan bicycle industry's
advantage of vertical integration and by the world-class quality
of new products, Yieh said.
</P>
<P>
Yieh said the increased number of buyers made many participating
firms decide to prebook exhibition booths for next year's
international cycle show that is slated for March 13-16 at the
soon-to-be opened Nankang Exhibition Hall in suburban Taipei.
