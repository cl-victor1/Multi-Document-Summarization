President Chen Shui-bian said Tuesday that the results of the
indigenous defense fighter (IDF) upgrade program operated by the
Aerospace Industrial Development Corp. (AIDC) has proved that
Taiwan is capable of developing and making weapons on its own.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan should continue efforts to seek independence in terms of
weapons production, Chen said in an address at a ceremony he
presided over at the AIDC factory in the central county of
Taichung to mark the debut of two upgraded IDFs, named Imposing
Eagle.
</P>
<P>
According to Chen, the IDF program has filled a vacuum in the air
force's counterattack power. In this regard, he added, the
project has plays a significant role in efforts to ensure the
safety of the country.
</P>
<P>
Chen noted that the IDF upgrade program was started in 1999
before he became president, but all the concerned budgets and
operational plans were worked out during his administration. He
stressed the necessity of the continuity of government
administration while calling for the Legislative Yuan's passage
of long-proposed budgets for three military arms procurement
projects from the United States.
</P>
<P>
The locally developed and manufactured IDFs have been in service
for more than 10 years and the Ministry of National Defense (MND)
has budgeted NT$7 billion for a mid-life upgrade for the planes.
</P>
<P>
As part of the upgrade, the fighter has been fitted with
additional fuel tanks to increase its range and airtime, while
its avionics have also been upgraded through the installation of
a new flight control computer system, according to defense
officials.
</P>
<P>
The plane's structure has also been strengthened to enhance its
weapon-carrying capacity, with the number of Tienchien II air-to-
air missiles it can carry rising from two to four.
</P>
<P>
In the early stage of the upgrade program, one single-seat IDF
and one twin- seater were upgraded and the air force will conduct
an evaluation into the upgrade results before deciding how many
other IDFs will be upgraded.
