Taipei,  March 27 (CNA) 03/27/07  15:44:50 (By Elizabeth Hsu)

<P>
The government does not have any plan to introduce a child care
subsidy program in 2008 as reported in a local daily, Interior
Minister Lee Yi-yang told lawmakers Tuesday during an
interpellation session at the Legislative Yuan.
</P>
<P>
In its Tuesday edition, the Chinese-language China Times revealed
the contents of a research report by the Ministry of the Interior
(MOI) on the government's population policy. The daily claimed
that the MOI plans to provide a "child care subsidy" to families
with at least one child in an effort to stem declining birth
rates in the country.
</P>
<P>
Under the reported "child care program, " families with one child
will be entitled to a monthly subsidy of NT$2,000 (US$60) , while
those with two children will receive NT$3,000 per month, and
families with three or more children will be eligible for a
monthly subsidy of NT$5,000.
</P>
<P>
When asked by Legislator Huang Chih-hsiung of the opposition
Kuomintang whether the MOI has decided to implement the planned
program in 2008, Lee explained that what the local daily
published was "purely a research report" by a research
institution commissioned by his ministry.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that a government program cannot be formed without a
consensus being reached by all relevant government units after a
thorough review.
</P>
<P>
Lee also said that the MOI has not yet decided whether or not to
accept proposals on the research report and that he believes
other ministries will surely have different opinions on the
issue.
