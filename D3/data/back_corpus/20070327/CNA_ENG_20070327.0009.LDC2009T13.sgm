PRESIDENT URGES OPPOSITION NOT TO OBSTRUCT ADMINISTRATION
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Taipei,  March  27  (CNA) 03/27/07  13:29:19 (By Lilian Wu)
</P>
<P>
President Chen Shui-bian urged the opposition Tuesday not to
obstruct his administration in carrying out its duties  out of
election  considerations, saying that the administration's policy
has been characterized by continuity.
</P>
<P>
The president  made the appeal  while presiding  over the
inauguration ceremony for the upgraded indigenous defense fighter
(IDF), known locally as the "Ching- kuo" jet fighter in memory of
the late President Chiang Ching-kuo,  at the Aerospace
Industrial Development Corp.'s (AIDC's) plant in Taichung City,
central Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
The president said that the upgrading project of the IDF, which
has been renamed the Ching-kuo Imposing Eagle, began in 1999
before he assumed the presidency the following year but that it
was completed during his second term, demonstrating his
administration's policy of continuity.
</P>
<P>
He noted that 2007 government budget, however, has yet to pass
the opposition- controlled legislature, even though it should
have been passed at the end of last year.
</P>
<P>
The president also noted that a major arms procurement from the
United States -- including a squadron of 12 anti-submarine P-3C
aircraft, eight diesel-fueled submarines and six Patriot PAC-3
anti-missile batteries -- was proposed by the Ministry of
National Defense (MND) before he assumed the presidency but that
it continues to be blocked in the legislature to this day.
</P>
<P>
The locally developed and manufactured IDFs have been in service
for more than 10 years. The MND budgeted NT$7 billion (US$212.12
million) for a mid-life upgrade of the Air Force's 130 IDFs.
</P>
<P>
The state-run AIDC was commissioned to carry out the IDF's mid-
life upgrade project in cooperation  with the military-run
Chungshan Institute of Science and Technology.
</P>
<P>
As part of the upgrade, the IDF has been fitted with additional
tanks to enable it to remain in flight for a longer period of
time, defense officials said, adding that the plane's avionics
have also been upgraded through the installation of a new flight
control computer system.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the officials said, the plane's structure has been
strengthened to enhance its weaponry capacity, with the number of
Tienchien (Skysword) II air- to-air missiles mounted being
increased from two to four.
