President Chen Shui-bian should consider granting amnesty to
everyone serving time for minor offenses May 20 in conjunction
with the seventh anniversary of his presidency, a senior lawmaker
said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Ker Chien-ming, convener of the legislative caucus of the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) , said many of his DPP
colleagues and other individuals have expressed the hope that
Chen will pardon all minor law-breakers on the seventh
anniversary of his presidency.
</P>
<P>
Noting that all prisons have long been overcrowded, Ker said the
president should seriously consider the grand amnesty proposal,
as his presidential tenure will expire in one year.
</P>
<P>
As a matter of fact, Ker said, many people recommended that Chen
should announce a grand amnesty when he assumed office May 20,
2000, becoming the first opposition figure to hold the country's
top executive post. A similar proposal was also brought up when
Chen was re-elected in 2004, he recalled.
</P>
<P>
With only one year to go before his presidency expires, Ker said
he felt compelled to reflect what he described as "grassroots
opinion."
</P>
<P>
"It is hoped that Chen will give thought to the proposal. With
less than two months to go, the Presidential Office and the
Ministry of Justice should discuss details as early as possible,"
he added.
