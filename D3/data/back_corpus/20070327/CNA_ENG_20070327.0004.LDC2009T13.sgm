A proposal to exclude opponent voters from the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party's (DPP) presidential primary poll has won
support from two presidential aspirants and will be put forward
at Wednesday's DPP Central Executive Committee meeting, a
Presidential Office source said Monday.
</P>
<P>
The source, who demanded not to be named, said the proposal was
initiated by high-ranking officials in the Presidential Office
and has been signed by Premier Su Tseng-chang and former premier
Frank Hsieh along with eight other DPP Central Standing Committee
members.
</P>
<P>
The DPP has a primary system which takes into account both
opinion polls involving general citizens and voting by party
members, with the former weighted 70 percent and the latter 30
percent.
</P>
<P>
Concerns over the influence of opposition-leaning voters on the
polls have driven DPP politicians to find ways of excluding the
opinions of such voters, though there are disagreements over the
proper extent of such an exclusion.
</P>
<P>
The source said the new version of the questionnaire will
function on a "party identification" basis. It will first ask
those surveyed about their party inclinations. The opinions of
those answering that they favor the DPP, the Taiwan Solidarity
Union or the Pan-green  camp will be included,  while opinions
from those identifying with the Kuomintang, the People First
Party, the New Party or the Pan-blue camp will not, according to
the source.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, those who remain uncommitted on the first
question will be asked to answer a follow-up question: Generally
speaking, do you admire the Pan- green or the Pan-blue? with
those favoring the blue again being excluded.
</P>
<P>
The source said it is estimated that the poll will successfully
exclude the preferences of the 30 percent of voters who favor the
blue camp, while retaining those expressed by the other 70
percent who are green or swing voters.
