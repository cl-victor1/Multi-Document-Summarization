DPP PRESIDENTIAL HOPEFULS TRADE BARBS OVER GOOD GOVERNANCE
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  April 21 (CNA) 04/21/07  20:18:01 (By Lilian Wu)

<P>
Two presidential aspirants of the ruling Democratic Progressive
Party (DPP) traded barbs over what good governance means Saturday
in a televised platform forum.
</P>
<P>
Former Premier Frank Hsieh said that if elected president in the
2008 election, he will form a stable coalition in view of the
current plight of a minority government.
</P>
<P>
Hsieh noted that if the DPP fails to gain control of more than
half of the seats in the legislature, he will coordinate with
other parties to form a stable coalition, although he declined to
touch on how to do so, saying it is a "complex issue." Hsieh
later explained that "tolerance" is essential to achieving the
end.
</P>
<P>
Premier Su Tseng-chang challenged Hsieh to disclose now how he
would end the political impasse and the perennial squabbling
between the ruling and opposition parties, saying that Hsieh can
provide his advice on coordination now without waiting to 2008
when he is elected president.
</P>
<P>
All four DPP hopefuls, including Vice President Annette Lu and
DPP Chairman Yu Shyi-kun, attended the second and last platform
forum sponsored by the DPP prior to the party's presidential
primary in May. The forum was held in Chiayi, southern Taiwan.
The first one was held in Taipei last Saturday.
</P>
<P>
They concurred that the minority government has been hampered in
carrying out many of its policies, when asked by professor Shih
Cheng-feng of Tamkang University why so many supporters feel that
that the DPP has failed to deliver on its campaign promises after
seven years in power and what they are going to do to ensure
happiness for the people if elected president in 2008.
</P>
<P>
Hsieh noted that if he is elected, he will form a stable
coalition with other parties and sign with them an agreement to
state clearly in which areas they can cooperate and in which
areas they cannot.
</P>
<P>
Su said that the interests of the public are the most important,
adding that if economic development and environmental protection
cannot co-exist, he would rather choose the preservation of
Taiwan's ecology.
</P>
<P>
Lu said that the major problem with the administration lies with
a bad constitutional system.
</P>
<P>
Lu noted that after the president appoints the premier, the
Executive Yuan possesses great power, except that of national
defense and diplomatic policies. But she lamented that the
premier's term is too short, noting that there have been five
premiers over the past seven years. The five decades of
Kuomintang rule also left a litany of problems, which will
require time to solve, she added.
</P>
<P>
Constant bickering in the legislature stemming from the fact that
the government is a minority government has also been a hindrance
to implementing and carrying out policies, Lu said,  adding that
globalization is also a challenge.
</P>
<P>
She said that  if elected  president,  she will push for
constitutional reform and party politics, make good use of talent
in every field, and work in tune with global trends.
</P>
<P>
Yu said that the performance of the DPP has not lived up to the
public's expectations mainly because it is a minority government,
adding, however, that in fact, the DPP has done a credible job,
citing the examples of the daunting tasks of constructing the
Shuehshan Tunnel and dredging of the Keelung River.
</P>
<P>
He vowed that if elected, he will make Taiwan a "normal country"
and "bring about economic prosperity so that the people will
enjoy a high-quality life."
