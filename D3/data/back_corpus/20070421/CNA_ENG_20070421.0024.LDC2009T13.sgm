Taiwan's total display panel output is expected to surpass NT$1
trillion (US$30.17 billion) for 2007, an Industrial  Technology
Research Institute (ITRI) official said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Jim Chung, a research manager with the ITRI's Economics and
Knowledge Center (IEK) , forecast that the flat panel display
(FPD) industry's output --including all kinds of panels and
upstream components and materials -- will reach NT$1.44 trillion
for this year, up 13.9 percent over the figure for 2006.
</P>
<P>
The annual output of Taiwan's FPD industry exceeded NT$1 trillion
for the first time last year, reaching NT$1.27 trillion, up 30.8
percent over the year-earlier figure, Chung said.

Total output of large size TFT-LCD panels for 2006 was NT$765.35
billion, up 34.5 percent year-on-year, while that of all kinds of
panels was NT$911.56 billion, up 29.1 percent, and that of
upstream raw materials was NT$360.4 billion, up 35.5 percent,
according to Chung.

<P>
He further said that the increase in total output of large size
panels was due to the fast growing LCD TV market, while that of
small and medium size panels was due to the growing mobile phone
and DVD player markets.
