President Chen Shui-bian praised Taiwan's outgoing top
representative to the United States David Ta-wei Lee Monday for
his exceptional contributions to cementing ties between Taiwan
and the United States during his tenure in Washington.
</P>
<P>
Lee has been reassigned as Taiwan's representative to Canada
after the administration appointed Mainland Affairs Council
Chairman Joseph Wu last week to succeed Lee as Taiwan's top
representative to Washington.
</P>
<P>
Wu's appointment was confirmed Sunday by Premier Su Tseng-chang,
who said the U.S. authorities have consented to the arrangement.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to a group of visiting mayors from major Canadian cities
at the Presidential Office, Chen described Lee as a shrewd and
talented diplomat who has performed outstandingly during his
stint in Washington.
</P>
<P>
He told the Canadian visitors that Lee is the best choice
available to be assigned to lead Taiwan's diplomatic mission in
Canada and expressed hope that the Canadian government will
accord Lee assistance to allow him a good start in Ottawa.
</P>
<P>
Chen also gave a thumbs up to Thomas Chen, the outgoing Taiwan
representative to Canada, for his extraordinary contributions to
improving ties between Taiwan and Canada during his six-year
stint in Ottawa.
</P>
<P>
Chen  said  Thomas  is praiseworthy  particularly  for his
contributions to pushing for Canada's enactment of a Taiwan
affairs bill governing Taiwan-Canada relations and Taiwan's
interests in Canada.
