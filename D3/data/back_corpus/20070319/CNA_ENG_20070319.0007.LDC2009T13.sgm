New York,  March 18 (CNA) 03/19/07  12:39:59 (By Lillian Lin and

A U.S. academic expressed the belief Sunday that Mainland Affairs
Council Chairman Joseph Wu, who has been appointed as Taiwan's
top representative to Washington, will make a capable and
competent envoy representing Taiwan's interests in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
June Teufel Dreyer, professor of political science at the
University of Miami, said during a telephone interview with the
CNA that she has known Wu for a long time and that Wu's abilities
and diligence will make him a capable and competent Taiwan
representative in Washington.
</P>
<P>
Dreyer said she has known Wu since the time he was studying at
graduate school at Ohio State University, adding that she was
impressed with his intelligence, his gentlemanly way of doing
things and his conscientious way of conducting research.
</P>
<P>
Giving the thumbs up in particular to a speech delivered by Wu at
the Royal United Services Institute, a London think tank, last
November, Dreyer said Wu gave a clear picture of Taiwan's foreign
policy to his audience.
</P>
<P>
Wu earned a doctoral degree in political science from Ohio State
in 1989 and later worked as an assistant  professor  in the
university's Department of Political Science.
</P>
<P>
Wu has been appointed  to be Taiwan's  representative  in
Washington, replacing David Ta-wei Lee, who has been reassigned
to serve as Taiwan's representative to Canada. Wu's appointment
was confirmed Sunday by Premier Su Tseng-chang, who said the U.S.
authorities have consented to the arrangements.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on Lee, Dreyer praised him highly, saying that Lee has
performed exceptionally well as the de facto Taiwan ambassador in
Washington. "I believe many friends of his in the United States
will miss him a lot after he transfers to Canada, " she added.
