President Chen Shui-bian has yet to give up on coordination among
the four contenders bidding to represent the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) for the 2008 presidential election, a DPP
legislative whip said Monday.
</P>
<P>
DPP Legislator Wang Sing-nan was responding to reports by the
Liberty Times, a local mass-circulation newspaper, that said the
president, after presiding over two rounds of coordination
meetings among the four aspirants -- Vice President Annette Lu,
Premier Su Tseng-chang, DPP Chairman Yu Shyi-kun and Former
Premier Frank Hsieh -- over the past 10 days, has decided to try
a new strategy.
</P>
<P>
The president would like to see the four DPP bigwigs, after a
policy debate on TV, proceed to the primary system, which will be
comprised of DPP member vote and public opinion polls, to decide
which of them will be the party's presidential candidate,
according to the reports.
</P>
<P>
Wang quoted officials of the Presidential Office as saying that
the president had not yet given up on efforts to coordinate among
the four aspirants, hoping that a major rift among the contenders
can be avoided.
</P>
<P>
The president is doing his best, the officials said, adding that
the primary system will be used only if all these efforts fail.
</P>
<P>
DPP Legislator Wang Tuoh expressed the hope that the president
will continue to coordinate among the four hopefuls, pointing out
that a split within the party will be unfavorable in terms of its
chances of winning the next presidential election.
</P>
<P>
Wang also voiced opposition to the planned holding of a policy
debate among the four aspirants on TV, saying that the debate
will "provide ammunition for the opposition camp."
</P>
<P>
DPP Acting Chairman Trong Chai said that as acting chairman, he
cannot assume that the coordination efforts will succeed and that
he therefore has to prepare for the possibility that the party's
primary mechanism will be used.
</P>
<P>
According to the party's primary schedule, if the coordination
efforts fail, the DPP will conduct a vote among party members as
well as public opinion polls in May before announcing the party's
candidate May 30.
