PRESIDENT TO CONTINUE PRESIDENTIAL TICKET MEDIATION

Taipei,  March 19 (CNA) 03/19/07  19:51:15 (By Luis Huang)

President Chen Shui-bian will continue to mediate in the
selection of a presidential ticket for the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) in the 2008 presidential election,
although sources close to him said Monday that he is preparing
for the worst.
</P>
<P>
The sources were responding to a report by a local daily Liberty
Times that after presiding over two rounds of coordination
meetings among the DPP's four aspirants -- Vice President Annette
Lu, Premier Su Tseng-chang, DPP Chairman Yu Shyi-kun and Former
Premier Frank Hsieh -- Chen wants to see the party proceed to its
primary election mechanism following a policy debate on TV.
</P>
<P>
Although the four presidential hopefuls have reached consensus on
certain issues in the two coordination sessions, no concrete
progress has been made in Chen's mediation efforts because their
respective camps are still sticking to their own stances,
according to the sources.
</P>
<P>
During the second round of mediation last week, the four
contenders agreed to conduct a policy debate before accepting the
president's mediation for picking a single candidate to avoid a
split in the party.
</P>
<P>
They also agreed to sign a written commitment pledging to accept
the final result of the mediation.
</P>
<P>
According to the DPP's presidential nomination mechanism, a
primary election will be held only if the mediation and
coordination approach fails to produce a single candidate. If the
primary approach has to be adopted, the candidate will be
selected based on the results of a party member vote, which
accounts for 30 percent of their scores, and a series of public
opinion polls to test their public support, which accounts for 70
percent.
