EACH PASSENGER MAY CARRY TWO CERTIFIED WII'S THROUGH CUSTOMS: NCC
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  March 19 (CNA) 03/19/07  21:28:56 (By Han Nai-kuo)

The National Communications Commission (NCC) clarified Monday
that each passenger entering Taiwan is allowed to carry two Wii's
through the customs at Taiwan's two international airports if the
products are certified Japanese Nintendo game consoles.
</P>
<P>
Howard Shyr, vice chairman and spokesman for the NCC -- Taiwan's
highest media regulator -- explained that Nintendo has already
obtained certification in Taiwan for its new game console, and
that passengers are allowed to go directly through airport
customs if they carry no more than two Wii's that are certified
to be genuine Nintendo products.
</P>
<P>
Stressing that the NCC has never intended to penalize people who
own a Wii, Shyr said the NCC must place imported Wii game
consoles under control because of their radio frequency
components and the bandwidth used by them.
</P>
<P>
Shyr added that those passengers carrying more than two Wii's
with them through the customs will have to pay import duties for
their commercial activities.
</P>
<P>
The NCC spokesman made the clarification after customs officials
at the international  airports  in Taoyuan and Kaohsiung  had
temporarily seized more than 100 Wii's from passengers.
</P>
<P>
Shyr said the NCC has sent its officials to the two airports to
help customs officials identify certified products.
</P>
<P>
The latest Nintendo game console has become increasingly popular
in Taiwan, with the number of owners estimated at about 20,000,
although the product is yet to be formally sold in Taiwan's
stores.
