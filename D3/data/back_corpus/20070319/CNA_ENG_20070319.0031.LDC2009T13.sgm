The ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) will host two or
three TV debates in April to allow the party's four presidential
aspirants to expound on their political concepts and policy
lines, a DPP official said Monday.
</P>
<P>
According to the official, Vice President Annette Lu, Premier Su
Tseng-chang, DPP Chairman Yu Shyi-kun and former Premier Frank
Hsieh, who are vying for the party's nomination to run in the
2008 presidential election, agreed to the decision at a
coordination meeting presided over by DPP Secretary-General Lin
Chia-lung at the party's headquarters.
</P>
<P>
The three debates are scheduled to be held between April 14 and
April 28, with each debate lasting for two hours, the official
said, adding that the party will invite pundits from different
sectors to put questions during the debates, with the name-list
of interrogators subject to approval by the four presidential
hopefuls.
</P>
<P>
Since Su, Yu and Hsieh have promised to take part in a debate to
be held March 24 that is being organized by the Taiwan Society,
it was decided at the meeting that the debate will be open to
those aspirants intending to participate, but that none of them
will be allowed to attend subsequent similar activities sponsored
by the society or other civil groups.
