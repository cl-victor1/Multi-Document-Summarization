PFP LAWMAKER REGISTERS FOR KEELUNG MAYORAL BY-ELECTION
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

Taipei,  March  19 (CNA) 03/19/07  17:50:01 (By Flor Wang)
</P>
<P>
Opposition People First Party (PFP) Legislator Liu Wen-hsiung
registered Monday with the Keelung City election commission to
take part in an April 12 by- election for the mayoral post.
</P>
<P>
Liu made his registration with the municipal election commission,
following Keelung City Council Speaker Chang Tung-jung of the
main opposition Kuomintang (KMT), who registered the previous
week.
</P>
<P>
Liu said that he had to register to assure his supporters that he
will not pull out of the race, even though the PFP and the KMT,
two allies in the opposition "pan-blue alliance, " have agreed to
use public opinion polls to jointly field a common candidate in
the race.
</P>
<P>
However, Liu did not write down his party affiliation on the
registration form in a bid to leave room to forge a cooperative
atmosphere between the PFP and the KMT to avoid a "pan-blue"
split in the by-election, called to select a successor to former
Mayor Hsu Tsai-li who died of diabetes in February.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the PFP and the KMT have tentatively agreed
to nominate a single candidate in the race pending the results of
public opinion polls. Any hopeful who commands a lead of at least
3 percent points will be jointly fielded by the two parties as
their common candidate.
</P>
<P>
Later in the day, Chang reiterated his resolve to take part in
the by-election and claimed that poll results gained by KMT
central will "only serve as a reference."
