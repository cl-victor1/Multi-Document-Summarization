Visiting President Chen Shui-bian said Tuesday that the selection
of a candidate to represent the ruling  Democratic  Progressive
Party (DPP)  in the 2008 presidential election will follow a
democratic mechanism.
</P>
<P>
Chen made the remarks when he met with the media after arriving
in Managua, Nicaragua Tuesday to attend the Jan. 10 inauguration
of president-elect Daniel Ortega.
</P>
<P>
Chen declined to comment on the 2008 presidential election or
potential candidates, saying only that "everything will follow a
democratic mechanism and the primary system of the party."
</P>
<P>
He expressed hope that all qualified aspirants will engage in a
"gentleman's battle, " adding that he will not encourage anyone
to participate  in the election,  nor will he deter anyone from
participating.
</P>
<P>
On suggestions within the party that the president should
coordinate among the four hopefuls for the presidency -- Vice
President Annette Lu, Premier Su Tseng- chang, former Premier
Frank Hsieh, and DPP Chairman Yu Shyi-kun -- the president said
only that the party has a sound democratic nomination mechanism.
</P>
<P>
Chen also said that when he took part in the presidential
elections in 2000 and 2004, there were not many rivals within the
party.
</P>
<P>
"But for the presidential election in 2008, because of our
victory in the last two presidential elections, as well as a pool
of qualified candidates within the party -- with at least six
each wanting to solicit the nomination of presidency and vice
presidency -- it is something to celebrate," he said.
</P>
<P>
Chen also said that for himself, he hopes for a smooth election
as well as a smooth passing of the baton to the winner of the
presidential election.
</P>
<P>
"For this reason, I'll stay above the matter and instead trust
the nomination mechanism," he said.
