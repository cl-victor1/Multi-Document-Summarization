NEARLY 30 REBAR GROUP EXECUTIVES BANNED FROM LEAVING TAIWAN
</HEADLINE>

Taipei, Jan. 10 (CNA) 01/10/07  15:42:08 (By Sofia Wu)
</P>
<P>
Nearly 30 senior executives of the troubled Rebar Asia Pacific
Group have been prohibited from leaving Taiwan as law enforcement
authorities are looking into suspected irregularities in the
group's business dealings and cash flows, prosecutors said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Lin Chin-tsun, a spokesman for the Taipei Prosecutor's Office,
said prosecution authorities  have closely cooperated with the
Financial Supervisory Commission (FSC) and the Investigation
Bureau under the Ministry of Justice in investigating  Rebar
group's suspected irregularities in land dealings and cross
holding in the past few days.
</P>
<P>
The  group  operates  more  than  20  businesses  spanning
manufacturing, communications, media, finance, real estate and
other services industries.
</P>
<P>
The investigations got underway after the government took over
the group's Chinese Bank last weekend following panic runs across
the country after two other Rebar affiliates announced Thursday
that they had filed for bankruptcy reorganization with the Taipei
District Court.
</P>
<P>
Chia Hsin Food &amp; Synthetic Fiber Co., a subsidiary in the
group, is burdened with NT$19.9 billion in debt from losses in
its man-made fiber business, while China Rebar Co., which acts as
guarantor to Chia Hsin, has debts amounting to NT$20.7 billion.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, eight local banks also took over Great Chinese Bills
Finance Corp., another financially troubled unit of the Rebar
group.
</P>
<P>
Noting that investigations first focused on checking the capital
flow between the Chinese Bank and other subsidiaries of the Rebar
group, Lin said progress has been made. "We'll take necessary
actions as soon as possible," he added.
</P>
<P>
The alleged irregularities include breach of trust, insider
trading, forgery, violation of accounting regulations and banking
law, as well as fraud, Lin said.
</P>
<P>
According to Lin, four prosecutors have been assigned to take
charge of the four major cases involving the group -- namely the
Chinese Bank's excessive lending to two Rebar subsidiaries --
Union Insurance Co. and Great Chinese Bills finance Corp.; Union
Insurance Co.'s capital "hollowing out"; insider trading
involving Chia Rebar Co. and Chia Hsin Food &amp; Synthetic Fiber
Co.; and hollowing out of Great Chinese Bills finance Corp.
</P>
<P>
Rebar's founder Wang You-theng and his wife had already quietly
slipped into China before the ban on leaving the country was
imposed by prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
Legislator Chen Ching-chun from the ruling Democratic Progressive
Party asked "Finance Minister Ho Chih-chin and Financial
Supervisory Commission (FSC) Chairman Shih Jun-ji to take
responsibility for failing to immediately supervise the crisis."
</P>
<P>
A local newspaper reported that shortly before his departure,
Wang had borrowed NT$800 million from the Chinese Bank and
remitted the money to China where he has sizable investments.
</P>
<P>
However, FSC Vice Chairwoman Susan Chang said that while there
was indeed a similar loan amount offered by the Chinese Bank
shortly before Wang's departure, the deal didn't seem to be
related to Wang.
</P>
<P>
According to Chang, the money was lent to an asset management
company to repay a loan to a local bank. But Chang said the FSC
will continue tracking relevant money flows to determine whether
there were other similar dealings.
