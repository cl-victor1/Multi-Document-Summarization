ACADEMIC MIGHT CHALLENGE KMT CHIEF IN PRESIDENTIAL PRIMARY

Taipei,  Jan. 10 (CNA) 01/10/07  19:21:40 (By Flor Wang)

Main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Ma Ying-jeou might face
a rival in the party's primary for the 2008 presidential
election, as a professor at National Taiwan University (NTU)
announced Wednesday his bid to compete against Ma.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a news conference at the Legislative Yuan, Hwang
Kwang-kuo, a long- time liberal academic, said that he is willing
to take on the challenge against Ma and hold debates with him to
discuss major issues of national concern, such as Taiwan's
relations with China and the nation's role on the world stage.
</P>
<P>
Hwang said that he does not aim to beat Ma in the primaries but
wants to help push for structural transformation and boost
exchanges of ideas and viewpoints within the party through his
participation in the primary.
</P>
<P>
Hwang claimed that Ma lacks a comprehensive  and in-depth
discourse of the so- called "Taiwan identity" on a broad range of
issues regarding cross-Taiwan Strait ties and Taiwan's future.
</P>
<P>
Over the past year, Ma has proved himself to be incompetent in
bringing new hopes for Taiwan, despite the fact that many people
pin their hope on the KMT chairman to lead the nation, he further
claimed.
</P>
<P>
According to Hwang, he also hopes to step up cooperation between
the KMT and the Democratic Action Alliance -- a civic group led
by him that strongly opposes legislative approval of a major
military procurement bill from the United States and echoed calls
by the "red-clad protesters" for President Chen Shui-bian to step
down during a series of protests from September to October in
front of the Presidential Office.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, Hwang's application to renew his KMT
membership, filed Dec. 8, has yet to be approved by the party.
