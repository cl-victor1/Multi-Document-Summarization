Taipei,  Jan.  10 (CNA) 01/10/07  15:45:37 (By Elizabeth Hsu)

Over 100 Investigation Bureau inspectors and prosecutors set off
Wednesday morning for a comprehensive search of the financially
troubled Rebar Asia Pacific Group's headquarters, headquarters of
all the group's affiliates and subsidiaries, as well as the
offices and residences of family members of the group founder
Wang You-theng.
</P>
<P>
Wang and his wife had already  fled to China before the
prosecution imposed a ban on dozens of executives of Rebar-
affiliated companies from leaving the country after the group was
suspected of involvement in many irregularities.
</P>
<P>
During the search, a female employee at Great Chinese Bills
Finance Corp., a Rebar subsidiary, was taken away for further
questioning.
</P>
<P>
The search was decided upon a day earlier during a special
meeting held by Kuan Chuang-cheng, chief prosecutor of the Taipei
District Prosecutors Office, along with four other prosecutors
assigned to take charge of the Rebar case, Investigation Bureau
inspectors, and Financial Supervisory Commission officials.
</P>
<P>
There are several alleged irregularities involving the group,
including  the Chinese Bank's excessive  lending to two Rebar
subsidiaries -- Union Insurance and Great Chinese Bills Finance;
China Rebar Co.'s capital "hollowing out"; insider trading
involving China Rebar Co. and Chia Hsin Food &amp; Synthetic
Fiber Co.; as well as breach of trust and hollowing out of Great
Chinese Bills Finance.
</P>
<P>
According to the task force in charge of the Rebar case, Union
Insurance is suspected of having carried out the scheme of
"pretended land trading" -- buying land at low prices then
selling high -- to appropriate near NT$1 billion worth of Union
Insurance's assets in collaboration with China Rebar, while Great
Chinese Bills Finance is also suspected of using the same tactic
of land dealing and cross holding to "hollow out" company funds.
</P>
<P>
The task force said a preliminary investigation has shown that
the Rebar group had conducted such fraud-oriented trading for
years.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the prosecution has also begun moves to review the
private accounts of all the members of the Wang family after
uncovering evidence revealing abnormal fund transactions between
Rebar affiliates.
