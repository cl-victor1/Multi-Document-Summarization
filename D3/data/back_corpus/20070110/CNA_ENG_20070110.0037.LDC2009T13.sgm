Issues concerning bilateral cooperation between Taiwan and
Nicaragua are not the main subject of President Chen Shui-bian's
trip to Nicaragua, as the only purpose of the visit is to
celebrate the inauguration of President-elect Daniel Ortega,
Foreign Affairs Vice Minister Yang Tzu-pao said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Yang made the remarks in response to lawmakers' questions during
a meeting of the Legislative Committee of Foreign Affairs about
reports that Chen will present Ortega with NT$1.8 billion as a
"gift" for the inauguration celebration.
</P>
<P>
Yang said that no such money will be given but admitted that
there are ongoing talks on bilateral cooperation between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
Opposition Kuomintang Legislator Kung Wen-chi said he doubts
Ortega will give a "warm welcome" to Chen's visit since he has
never appeared friendly toward Taiwan and had even expressed
during presidential campaign that he would switch diplomatic
recognition from Taiwan to China if elected.
</P>
<P>
Yang said Chen was invited to attend Ortega's inauguration in his
capacity as the head of state of a country with diplomatic ties
with Nicaragua. The treatment Chen enjoys during his Jan. 10-12
stay in the country will be the same as that accorded to other
attending leaders, he said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Chen arrived in Nicaragua at the start of his three-day
visit. He and his entourage were greeted by Nicaraguan government
officials in a formal welcome ceremony upon his arrival at the
Managua International Airport, with a large group of Taiwanese
expatriates also on hand to welcome the president.
</P>
<P>
During his stay, Chen will also hold talks with heads of state of
Taiwan's diplomatic allies in Latin America and sign a joint
declaration after the meeting, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
Chen is scheduled to make a transit stop in Los Angeles Jan. 12
on his way back to Taipei.
