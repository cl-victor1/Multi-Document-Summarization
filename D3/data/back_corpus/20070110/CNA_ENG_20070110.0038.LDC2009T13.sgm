LAWMAKERS DEMAND FSC CHIEF'S RESIGNATION

Taipei, Jan. 10 (CNA) 01/10/07  21:40:25 (By Flor Wang)

<P>
Opposition lawmakers continued their attack on Financial
Supervisory Commission (FSC) Chairman Shih Jun-ji Wednesday,
demanding his resignation in the wake of a bank run that they
claimed has seriously rocked the public's confidence in the
domestic financial market.
</P>
<P>
Main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) lawmakers Alex Fai, Lai Shyh-bao
and Kuo Su- chun urged Shih to step down for what they called a
dereliction of duty amid a run at the Chinese Bank since Jan. 5.
They made their demand after hearing a keynote report on the
incident by Shih, Minister of Finance Ho Chih-chin and Central
Bank of China Governor Perng Fai-nan at a legislative committee
meeting.
</P>
<P>
Fai argued that Shih must resign  from the top financial
regulator's post because he failed to apologize for his
negligence over the run and because the FSC fell short of setting
up a fast response task force to deal with the issue.
</P>
<P>
But he praised Ho and Perng for their apologies to the public and
hailed Perng's quick formation of an ad hoc team in response to
the run.
</P>
<P>
Fai also accused Shih of being incapable of preventing the run
from breaking out and said that the FSC chief is therefore
unqualified to hold the post.
</P>
<P>
According to Lai, either Premier Su Tseng-chang or Shih must step
down to take responsibility for the Chinese Bank run. Their
failure to swiftly handle the matter led to the run, which has
severely shaken the public's confidence, he claimed.
</P>
<P>
In response to the lawmakers' accusations, Shih said that the FSC
will provide a clear report on the run to the public and promised
that he will assume his responsibility after the whole incident
has been fully cleared up.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Chang Hsien-yao, director of the opposition People
First Party's Policy Center, urged Su to quickly call an
emergency meeting with experts to study ways to quell public
unease about the bank run.
</P>
<P>
The government must not underestimate the possible side effects
of the run and must take concrete measures to prevent the local
currency from depreciating and the domestic foreign exchange
market from being affected, Chang said.
</P>
<P>
He expressed his disappointment about Shih's hesitation to make
it clear whether the Financial Reconstruction Fund still has
enough funds to reimburse customer deposits.
</P>
<P>
The Central Deposit Insurance Corporation has taken over the
Chinese Bank, prompting the Financial Reconstruction Fund to
tackle the incident with its funds generated by taxpayers.
</P>
<P>
Chang also questioned Shih as to whether the fund has enough
money to deal with similar contingencies in the future, now that
it has listed 10 questionable banks under its scrutiny since more
than a year ago.  Relevant government authorities  must offer a
good explanation to the public in this regard, he argued.
</P>
<P>
Shih must be held fully accountable for the FSC's failure to
adequately handle the Chinese Bank run in his capacity as chief
of the government agency, he added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, President Chen Shui-bian, who is visiting Nicaragua to
attend the inauguration of President-elect Daniel Ortega, asked
Su do his best to cope with the run in compliance with the law so
as to minimize the impact on society.
</P>
<P>
It is the government's responsibility to protect the people's
interests in such cases, Chen said. He also called for law
revisions to form protective umbrellas for the victims of such
incidents.
</P>
<P>
According to Vice Premier Tsai Ying-wen, government agencies need
to improve the way how they have handled the run to better help
build public confidence in the aftermath, despite the fact that
no systematic risks will emerge from the incident.
</P>
<P>
A run broke out last Friday across the country at the Chinese
Bank, an operation unit of the Rebar Asia Pacific Group, after
two Rebar subsidiaries filed for a bankruptcy protection a day
earlier.
</P>
<P>
Rebar Group Chairman Wang You-theng and his wife had reportedly
fled to China before the bankruptcy was made public.
