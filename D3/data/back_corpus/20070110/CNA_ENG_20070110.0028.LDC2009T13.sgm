The Civil Aeronautics Administration (CAA) said Wednesday that it
will ask Japan to allow more domestic airlines to fly to Japan.
</P>
<P>
CAA officials noted that in view of the recent inauguration of
the high speed railway system linking Taipei in northern Taiwan
and Kaohsiung in the south last week, domestic airline operators
now face an even steeper challenge.
</P>
<P>
They noted that a new air pact signed between Taiwan and Japan
last year increased new flight destinations in Japan for China
Airlines and EVA Airways -- Taiwan's two largest carriers, as
well as allowing another airline to ply charter flight services,
the fourth airline in Taiwan to enter the Japanese market.
</P>
<P>
Mandarin Airlines obtained the charter flight qualification in
November 2000.
</P>
<P>
As the operations of the Japanese routes have been good while
domestic routes have continued to slide, several airliners,
including UNI Airways Corp., Trans Asia Airways, as well as Far
East Air Transport Corp., have solicited hotly for the charter
flights. UNI Airways awarded in October and will open a new
flight route to Hokkaido next month.
</P>
<P>
The officials said that during the renewal of an air pact last
year, they had hoped Japan would allow more Taiwan airlines to
fly to Japan, but were refused by Japan.
