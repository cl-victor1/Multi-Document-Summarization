Taipei, Jan. 10 (CNA) 01/10/07  19:48:04 (By Lilian Wu)

<P>
The Environmental Protection Administration (EPA) has demanded
improvements in water potability in Maioliao, Yunlin County, as
well as on the outlying island of Kinmen.
</P>
<P>
Officials from the EPA's Department of Environmental Sanitation
and Toxic Substance  Management  said they have asked  local
environmental protection departments to fine water plants that do
not achieve standard quality or fail to improve.
</P>
<P>
The officials noted that arsenic levels tested at the Maioliao
water plant last year were 0.0139 milligrams per liter, higher
than the standard level of 0.01 milligrams per liter. An
investigation showed that the plant had been taking water from
three wells that have high levels of arsenic. The EPA alerted
Taiwan Water Corp. (TWC) to stop using the water.
</P>
<P>
After two follow-up tests of the Maioliao water cleaning plant,
the arsenic level had fallen to potable levels.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, water quality on Kinmen has been unstable due to
insufficient water resources. Trihalmethanes (THM) in the water
tend to be high at between 0.0605 and 0.0727 milligrams per
liter, which is approaching the standard level of 0.08 milligrams
per liter.
</P>
<P>
The officials said that THMs, a by-product of chlorides used for
disinfection, has been listed by the World Health Organization as
a possible carcinogen.
</P>
<P>
Kinmen environmental protection officials have asked the Kinmen
water plant to continue monitoring the processing of its water to
ensure safety.
