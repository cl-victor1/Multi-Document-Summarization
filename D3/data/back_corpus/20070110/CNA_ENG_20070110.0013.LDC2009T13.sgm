</HEADLINE>

<P>
The Ministry of Justice said Wednesday that it will solicit views
from all sectors of society this year on the issue of whether to
abrogate capital punishment.
</P>
<P>
Chang Chi-yun,  director of the ministry's  Department  of
Prevention, Rehabilitation and Protection, said the ministry will
conduct public hearings, seminars as well as campus debates to
invite the public to think about and debate the issue.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the ministry is not ruling out the possibility of
holding another survey to learn the views of the public on the
issue, Chang added, noting that surveys on the issue have not
been conducted for a long time.
</P>
<P>
He noted that President Chen Shui-bian said in 2000 that he
wanted to scrap the death penalty and that the ministry's policy
to eventually abrogate it remains unchanged.
</P>
<P>
Chang said he has met with members of groups in support of the
abrogation as well as family members of victims who are against
the scrapping to learn more about their views.
</P>
<P>
The ministry  also held a seminar on phasing out capital
punishment for the first time last year, with the participants
fully expressing their views, Chang said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that currently, the concept of getting even is still
prevalent in Taiwan and that the abrogation of the death penalty
will have to await "a maturing of society."
</P>
<P>
The ministry hopes that the public can think seriously about the
right to life through inter-school debates like the one held last
year, he said.
</P>
<P>
The ministry will also hold public hearings in northern, central
and southern Taiwan this year, inviting people from all walks of
life to participate.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the ministry will commission the Crime Research
Center under National Chung Cheng University to study the issue.
