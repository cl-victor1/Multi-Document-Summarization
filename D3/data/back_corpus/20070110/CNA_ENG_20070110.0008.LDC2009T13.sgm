The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) promised Wednesday that it
will investigate alleged bribe-taking by immigration officials in
charge of interviewing foreign spouses of Taiwan citizens
applying to settle in the country.

improve the interview mechanism for foreign spouses of Taiwan
citizens at a legislative committee meeting.

Opposition Legislator Lai Shyi-pao of the Kuomintang said during
the meeting that he has received complaints that officials
stationed in Ho Chi Minh City to conduct interviews on Vietnamese
spouses of Taiwan citizens have been receiving cash bribes to
speed up the application process.

Yang noted that he has heard such stories before, adding that it
is a serious matter if the stories are true. He promised to give
Lai a written report after a thorough probe.
