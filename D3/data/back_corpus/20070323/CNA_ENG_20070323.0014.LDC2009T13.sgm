Taichung Deputy Mayor Hsiao Chia-chi expressed the hope Friday
that construction of the green line of the proposed mass rapid
transit system in the central Taiwan city will be completed
quickly to mitigate traffic congestion in the city.
</P>
<P>
Hsiao made the remarks after the Ministry of Transportation and
Communications (MOTC) announced a day earlier that construction
of the MRT system will begin in October.
</P>
<P>
Hsiao said that as far as he knows, the MOTC will only begin
</P>
<P>
erecting fences along the MRT routes in that month and that the
designs for the MRT system will only be completed by early next
year.
</P>
<P>
Construction of the green line, which will link up with a station
of the high- speed rail system, is scheduled to be completed in
2012.
