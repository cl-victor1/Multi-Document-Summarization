Chou Chun-hsun, the first Taiwan-nurtured ninth-dan go player,
was all smiles when he received the trophy and prize money in
Seoul Friday for the first world go title he has ever won -- the
11th LG Cup Go Championship.
</P>
<P>
The presentation ceremony took place at the headquarters of the
Chosun Ilbo daily, presided over by Bang Sang-hoon, the
newspaper's president.
</P>
<P>
Chou, 27, received 250 million Korean won in prize money, in
addition to a trophy.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan's representative to South Korea, Chen Yong-cho, also
attended  the ceremony.  Chen had originally  planned to read
congratulatory messages from President Chen Shui-bian and Vice
President Annette Lu, but the plan was thwarted when the leader
of the Chinese delegation threatened to walk out of the ceremony
along with Chinese go player Hu Yaoyu, the runner-up in the
competition.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese delegate insisted that the occasion was a ceremonial
function and should not be politicized.
</P>
<P>
After brief negotiations, the Taipei mission in Seoul agreed to
wait until after the end of the ceremony to deliver the messages
to Chou.
</P>
<P>
Chou defeated his Chinese opponent Hu 2-1 in a best-of-three
final Thursday. Chou's victory marked the first time a Taiwan go
player representing Taiwan has won the first-tier international
go competition. The LG Cup is reputed as the most lucrative go
competition in the world.
