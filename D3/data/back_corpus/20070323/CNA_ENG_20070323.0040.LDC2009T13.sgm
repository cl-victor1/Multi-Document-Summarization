Taipei, March 23 (CNA) 03/23/07  21:37:58 (By Ruth Wang)

<P>
The Legislative Yuan has passed the first reading of a package of
draft amendments that would allow foreign laborers in Taiwan to
serve as board directors and supervisors of labor unions.
</P>
<P>
Ku Yu-lin, secretary-general of the Taiwan International Workers'
Association (TIWA), hailed the proposed amendments, noting that
foreign laborers have declined to join unions because Taiwanese
unions are weak in fighting for foreign laborers' welfare.
</P>
<P>
Ku said that allowing foreign laborers to be union executives
might not actually help, but the move is at least progress.
</P>
<P>
Ku said the Labor Union Law is still too conservative in making
changes and she expressed hope that further amendments to the law
will allow foreign laborers to organize their own unions.
