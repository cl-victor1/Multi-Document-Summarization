Taipei City's 2007 Traditional Arts Festival -- Taiwan's biggest
event featuring traditional music, dance and drama -- will begin
March 31 and run through the beginning of June, Taipei City Mayor
Hau Lung-bin announced Friday.

Hau said city government has invited local and foreign artists to
participate in this major festival,  which  will present  44
performances in drama, dance and music, revolving around seven
topics, including "moonlight theater, " "panorama of dramas, "
and "dance up new generation."

The Taipei Chinese Orchestra will work with the National Taiwan
College of Performing Arts to present dramatic performances
written by the late master Yu Ta-kang, in memory of the great
playwright's contributions to Taiwanese arts.

Hau said the efforts of Taipei City and these artists to preserve
traditional arts should be approved and supported by the public
through participation in festival activities, adding that the
event will incorporate traditional arts into contemporary
lifestyles, and help to pass on the legacy of the traditional
arts.

Lee Yung-ping, commissioner of Taipei City's Department of
Cultural Affairs, said that she hopes to see traditional arts
revitalized through artists' attempt to grapple with the impact
of globalization, and that she will be happy to see Taipei become
a world class center of the arts and culture.
