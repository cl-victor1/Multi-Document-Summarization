Export orders totaled US$21.91 billion in February, representing
an increase of 8.17 percent year-on-year, the Ministry of
Economic Affairs (MOEA) said Friday.
</P>
<P>
MOEA officials attributed the increase mainly to booming orders
for notebooks, followed by other electronic products, noting that
international electronic giants have been outsourcing their
orders to Taiwan because of global demand for electronic
products.
</P>
<P>
In terms of region, the United States placed the most orders with
US$5.63 billion, followed by Hong Kong (including China), with
orders worth US$5.17 billion.
</P>
<P>
Export orders in the first two months totaled US$47.84 billion,
up 12.92 percent from the same period of last year, they said.
</P>
<P>
They predicted that export orders and manufacturing production in
March will be even better than February.
</P>
<P>
Due to decreased working days in February because of the nine-day
Chinese New Year holiday, industrial production for the month was
down 2.77 percent from the same month of last year. The
manufacturing sector was down by 4 percent, the mineral and
gravel sector was down by 22.26 percent, the water, electricity
and fuel sector increased by 0.38 percent and the construction
sector was up by 57.66 percent.

sector increased by 1.55 percent, the water, electricity and fuel
sector was up by 2.64 percent and the construction sector was up
by 5.43 percent, while the mineral and gravel sector was down by
