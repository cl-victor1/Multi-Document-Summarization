Vice President Annette Lu urged leaders in education to join
efforts to promote the "value of soft power," which she explains
is the power embodied in democracy, peace, and social prosperity.
</P>
<P>
Lu made the call Friday in her address to the opening of the
second International Forum of University Presidents, which is
part of celebrations for the 50th establishment anniversary of
Ming Chung University in Taipei City.
</P>
<P>
Understanding the value of soft power, Lu said she believes
leaders of the next generation will have to not only concentrate
their attention on military and economic expansion, but also
endeavor to promote democracy, peace and prosperity.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on the importance of education, Lu, who taught at the
university for three years before entering politics, stated that
she thinks the goal of education is not just to equip individuals
with professional skills, but to ensure that those professionals
cultivate the core values that make them dignified human beings.
</P>
<P>
In the speech delivered in English, the vice president recognized
the contribution of Ming Chuan founder Dr. Pao Teh-ming to
education, who Lu indicated has dedicated her life to cultivating
leaders among women through education. Pao retired from the
university in 1999, and is now 100 years old.
</P>
<P>
Ming Chuan was established by Pao and her husband Lee Ying-chao
in 1957 as a three-year junior women's college, the first
business and management institution of its kind in Taiwan. The
college expanded to a university in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The one-day international forum drew more than 160 scholars from
more than 20 institutions of higher education in 10 countries
including the United States, Britain, Japan, Korea, Russia,
Malaysia, Thailand, the Philippines, Vietnam, and Taiwan, for
discussions on higher education in the 21st century.
