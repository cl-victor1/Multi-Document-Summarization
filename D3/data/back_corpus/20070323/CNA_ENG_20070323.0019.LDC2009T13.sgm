TAIWAN GO PLAYER RISES FROM OBSCURITY TO FAME
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  March 23 (CNA) 03/23/07  17:43:13 (By Sofia Wu)

Chou Chun-hsun, fresh from winning his first world Go title in
Seoul, South Korea, says the subtle Oriental board game known as
"wei-chi" in Taiwan is his whole life.
</P>
<P>
Chou,  the only Taiwan-nurtured Go player to rise to the
professional game's top tier -- ninth dan, or level nine,
captured the 11th LG Cup Go championship in Seoul Thursday after
beating Chinese player Hu Yaoyu 2-1 in a best-of-three final.
</P>
<P>
The victory, bringing him 250 million Korean won (US$266,421;
NT$8.8 million) in prize money, was not only Chou's first world
title but also marked the first time that a home-grown player has
ever won a world title under the banner of Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Another Taiwan-born Go player, Cho U, won the coveted LG Cup two
years ago, but he was representing Japan at the time.
</P>
<P>
After emerging victorious, Chou said he hopes that his win can
galvanize other Taiwan Go players to pursue excellence and win
more world titles for themselves and their country.
</P>
<P>
Chou, 27, started to learn how to play Go with his father at the
tender age of 6. He soon found great interest and joy in the
intellectually challenging game.
</P>
<P>
During his elementary school years, playing Go was a major source
of courage and comfort for Chou. With half of his face covered by
a scarlet birthmark, he was often mocked by his classmates. To
dodge curious gazes, Chou opted to lock himself in the strategic
world of Go.
</P>
<P>
Over the years, Chou has learned to ignore comments about
birthmark while cultivating a habitual concentration and
precocious calm, which have become his valuable personal assets
in the highly competitive game of Go.
</P>
<P>
During his formative years, Chou recalled in a recent interview
with CNA, he liked to run to vent his grief. "When I was a junior
high school student, I ran for three hours every day, circling
the school's  sports ground about 70 times and covering  some 28
kilometers," he said.
</P>
<P>
Such regular exercise has given him abundant energy which has
allowed him to endure lengthy, tense and stressful Go
competitions.
</P>
<P>
Chou won his first Go title in a competition organized by Japan
Asia Airways in 1989 when he was a third grade student. At 12, he
was crowned  national champion  and represented  Taiwan  at major
international tournaments before becoming a professional Go
player at the age of 14, the youngest at the time.
</P>
<P>
Although he had won dozens of tournaments during his career, he
was unable to get past the semi-finals of an international
tournament until Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Unlike other Taiwan-born Go players, Chou has not moved abroad to
play tougher competition in Japan, instead staying in Taiwan and
representing his country for the past 10 years at major
international tournaments.
</P>
<P>
Chou's struggle to excel in the world of Go has been compiled
into a primary school textbook. The writer, Chiang Ying-chiao, a
former principal of Taipei's Yenping Elementary School, said she
wrote the article, titled "Red-face Go King, " in the hope that
Chou's life story can provide inspiration to other
schoolchildren, particularly those in trouble or with
disabilities.
</P>
<P>
As a footnote to his Go career, Chou once said: "For me, my
birthmark is a blessing in disguise. I have come to believe that
no matter how arduous or challenging life may be, there will be a
way forward. No one should belittle his or her potential. Where
there is a will, one can always reach for the stars."
</P>
<P>
Chou advanced to seventh dan in 1997 and then finally reached
ninth dan in 2000. He is widely viewed as being the best player
at the Taiwan Chi Yuan Culture Foundation, also known as the
Taiwan Go Association.
</P>
<P>
In the pursuit of excellence, Chou has been to China to study Go
with three renowned Chinese masters of the game -- namely Song
Xuehlin, Yu Bin and Wu Yulin. He was the first Taiwan Go player
to have travel all alone to China to perfect his Go skills and
took part in its rank-grading competition.
</P>
<P>
Despite his busy career, Chou has persevered in his academic
study. He finally obtained his vocational high school diploma
after much-longer-than-usual- schoolyears.
</P>
<P>
The LG Cup, also known as the LG Cup World Baduk Championship, is
sponsored by LG Group of South Korea and offers the highest
amount in prize money of any annual Go competition. Go is known
as baduk in South Korea.
</P>
<P>
The organizers presented a trophy and prize money to Chou in a
grand award- presentation ceremony Friday. Chou is scheduled to
return to Taipei Saturday.
