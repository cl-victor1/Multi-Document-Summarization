Kazmerskie said the SOC awards were created in 1995 in the United
States to award junior and senior high school students for
outstanding volunteer services to their communities. He added
that the awards are also given out in Japan and South Korea and
that Taiwan's SOC awards are organized by the company and GASC.

more young people to take part in volunteer services "to make
Taiwan a country full of love and care."
