Taipei,  March 23 (CNA) 03/23/07  19:36:41 (By Lilian Wu)

<P>
Premier Su Tseng-chang said Friday that the government will
adjust its policy to encourage more people with talent to excel
in world-class games or specific fields.
</P>
<P>
The premier made the remarks one day after Taiwanese go player
Chou Chun-hsun won his first world go title in Seoul, South
Korea.
</P>
<P>
Chou won 250 million Korean won (US$266,420) in prize money, the
most lucrative go prize in the world, making him the first home-
grown player representing Taiwan to win the honor.
</P>
<P>
Another Taiwan-born player, Cho U, won the coveted LG Cup two
years ago, but he was representing Japan at the time.
</P>
<P>
The premier said Chou's example should inspire Taiwanese parents,
saying that in addition  to wanting their children  to shine
academically, they should also let them excel in other aspects.
</P>
<P>
Opposition Kuomintang Legislator Lin Hung-chih questioned why the
government has not provided any financial assistance to Chou for
the past 20 years, saying that a talent like him should be
subsidized.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Education Tu Cheng-sheng said go seems to fall into a
gray area between art and academia and that he will have to study
the matter further before agreeing to subsidies for go players.
