Responding to a media report that construction of the mass rapid
train (MRT) system in the greater Taichung area will kick off
soon, the Taichung County Government urged the central government
Friday to provide it with sufficient monetary aid to help meet
its needs.
</P>
<P>
The transport  and tourism bureau of the Taichung  County
Government has asked the central government in Taipei to provide
at least 90 percent of the construction budget for the priority
line from Taichung City's Peitun district to Wuje in neighboring
Taichung County, citing the county's financial straits.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Transportation and Communications has reportedly
scheduled construction on the 16.7-km priority line to begin in
October and last until 2011 at the earliest, at a cost of NT$39
billion. The line will be built on elevated tracks the entire
way, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Taichung County authorities also called for the project, which
would link the high speed rail station in Wuje to downtown
Taichung and create a new transportation hub in central Taiwan,
to begin as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that the entire greater Taichung area metro
system will take 20 years to complete.
