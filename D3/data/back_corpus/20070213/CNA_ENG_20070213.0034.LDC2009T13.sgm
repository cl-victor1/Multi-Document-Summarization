Chiayi county's "Taiwan Tangerines" (citrus-ponkans) are proving
to be very popular in Singapore, with more than 300 tonnes
exported to Singapore in the past month alone, a county
government official said Tuesday.

The county's Agriculture Bureau Chief Hsu Ling-sung said that
export of tangerines helped to correct for an over-abundance of
produce in the domestic market and that the "Great Luck"
tangerine sets, packaged with a miniature spring couplet on each
tangerine, have become hot-selling gifts in Singapore in the run-
up to the Chinese New Year holiday.

With the Tropic of Cancer running through it, Chiayi county is an
ideal place to grow a variety  of fruits including  tropical
pineapples, bananas, papayas, guavas, mangos, as well as
temperate tangerines, oranges, and pears, Hsu said, adding that
tangerine orchards in the county cover more than 2,300 hectares
and produce over 33,000 tonnes of fruit.

County Magistrate Chen Ming-wen encouraged the bureau two years
ago to export tropical fruits to temperate countries like Japan,
China, Canada and South Korea, and temperate fruits to tropical
countries like Singapore, Hong Kong, and Southeast Asian
countries. Hsu said the marketing strategy has proved to be
successful.

<P>
County government's marketing strategy has helped to create
export channels for the county's high quality tangerines, Hsu
said, pointing out that with Singapore importing more than 300
tonnes of Taiwan's tangerines in only one month, on average,
every group of 20 people in Singapore has collectively consumed
one creatively packaged set of "Great Luck" tangerines.
