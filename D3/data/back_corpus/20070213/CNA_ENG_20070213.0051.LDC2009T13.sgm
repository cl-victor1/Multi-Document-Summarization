KMT LAWMAKERS FIRM ON CHAIRMAN RUNNING IN PRESIDENTIAL RACE
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taipei,  Feb. 13 (CNA) 02/13/07  21:29:29 (By Flor Wang)
</P>
<P>
Main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) lawmakers voiced their keen
support Tuesday for KMT Chairman Ma Ying-jeou's participation in
the 2008 presidential election, saying that Ma must not pull out
of the race despite his indictment on embezzlement charges
earlier in the day.
</P>
<P>
Ma, a former mayor of Taipei who ended his eight-year mayoral
term last December, was indicted on embezzlement charges over his
alleged mishandling of special municipal funds earmarked for his
discretionary use.
</P>
<P>
Ma was charged with lining his pockets with NT$11 million
(US$332,684) from a special allowance fund for the mayor's
discretionary use that required no invoices or receipts upon
which to claim reimbursement, while Yu Wen, a municipal
government clerk, was also indicted for graft and document
forgery for allegedly using others' invoices to claim
reimbursements from the special municipal fund.
</P>
<P>
Describing Ma's indictment as a "politically charged move, " KMT
lawmaker Lai Shyh-bao said that Ma must take part in the next
presidential election regardless of the indictment, claiming that
the public strongly believes in his "clean name."
</P>
<P>
Lai questioned why investigations into similar charges against
heavyweights in the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) ,
such as Vice President Annette Lu, Premier Su Tseng-chang, former
Premier Frank Hsieh and former Premier and incumbent DPP Chairman
Yu Shyi-kun, as well as Judicial Yuan President Weng Yueh-sheng
and National Security Council Chairman Tan Sun Chen, have not
even started.
</P>
<P>
"The prosecution's  singling out Ma is just a politically
motivated move," he claimed.
</P>
<P>
KMT lawmaker Hung Hsiu-chu asked the prosecution to come out with
a timetable for beginning probes into the DPP figures and called
for calm and unity within the KMT at this very critical time.
</P>
<P>
KMT lawmaker  Kuo Su-chun ascribed  Ma's indictment  to a long-
existing flawed government system that can be used as a pretext
to set someone up and claimed that it is "extremely unfair" to
solely indict Ma.
</P>
<P>
KMT lawmaker Shuai Hua-ming insisted that Ma has to stay in the
race for the sake of the overall national interest.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Lee Hung-chun, spokesman for the opposition People
First Party (PFP) , a KMT ally, told the KMT that December's
legislative elections and the 2008 presidential elections must
not be hobbled due to Ma's indictment.
</P>
<P>
Lee called for speedy follow-up trials and a conclusion of Ma's
case as quickly as possible. He offered to collaborate with the
KMT through their cooperation mechanisms in order to secure
victory in the coming elections.
</P>
<P>
"Ma's indictment does not mean he is guilty, " Lee pointed out,
calling for judicial justice through due legal process and
warning that the opposition "pan- blue alliance" cannot afford to
have another split.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, DPP lawmakers demanded that Ma weigh his next move,
apologize to the public and conduct self-reflection now that he
has been indicted.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a news conference in the Legislative Yuan, DPP
Legislator Lin Shu- fen insisted that Ma must judge himself by
the same standard with which he judged President Chen Shui-bian's
wife and son-in-law, who were indicted on charges of embezzlement
and insider trading, respectively, last year.
</P>
<P>
Investigation results show that Ma lied Nov. 15 last year when he
claimed he did not embezzle from the special municipal allowance,
according to Lin.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile,  Ma immediately offered to resign from the KMT
chairmanship following his indictment -- a promise he made before
his indictment. The party's Central Standing Committee is slated
to call an emergency meeting to deal with the drastic
development.
