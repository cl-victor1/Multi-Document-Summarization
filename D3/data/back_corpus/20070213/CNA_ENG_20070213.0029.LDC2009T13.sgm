A proposal by the Council of Labor Affairs (CLA) to review the
minimum wage ran into opposition from the chairman of a major
think tank Tuesday on the grounds that such policy would do more
to harm disadvantaged workers.
</P>
<P>
The government's move would raise the minimum wage above the
value of some workers' labor, thus discouraging employers from
hiring and push some factories to leave, Chen Po-chih, an
economist and Chairman of Taiwan Thinktank, said in a telephone
interview with the CNA. The think tank is seen to be close to the
Democratic Progressive Party government.

In the end, it is the disadvantaged workers that will be hurt,
Chen said.

CLA Chairman Lee Ying-yuan said a day earlier that the council is
to convene a meeting after the Lunar New Year holidays to discuss
adjusting the country's minimum wage, which has remained
unchanged at NT$15,840 (US$481) per month for the last nine
years. Lee said he is personally in favor of raising the minimum
wage, but the decisions on whether to adjust it and by how much
will be made by a CLA committee.
</P>
<P>
Chen Po-chih said that the CLA's position is understandable, but
his point is made from a global economic perspective and is aimed
at protecting poor and unemployed laborers.
</P>
<P>
He called the move to adjust the minimum wageirresponsibleand
said that he will only consider challenges to his view from
laborers now paid with current minimum wage -- provided that they
are willing to accept responsibility for their own future
unemployment should their position on an increase be accepted.
