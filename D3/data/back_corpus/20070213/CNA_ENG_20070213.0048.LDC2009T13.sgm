The Council for Economic Planning and Development (CEPD) has
drafted plans to make Taiwan world-class in the Radio Frequency
Identification (RFID) industry, a government spokesman said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said the technology industry describes the rapidly
developing RFID technology as "the second IT revolution."
Hardware and software factories have invested heavily in RFID
technology research and development and advanced countries regard
it as a new power in industrial development.
</P>
<P>
RFID can be used in the fields of mobile business, global
logistics, national security, transportation, operations
management, and medical care. Deployment of RFID in wholesale,
convenience, and department stores can also reduce inventory
inaccuracies.
</P>
<P>
In addition, RFID helps to control product distribution chains
from loading and transportation, to the retail level. The
Kaohsiung Customs Office and Port of Kaohsiung replaced manual
escorts on products in logistics with RFID, a move that has
reduced escort waiting time by 6,200 hours.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman pointed out that according to ABI Research
statistics, RFID's market scale will reach US$22.3 billion by
2011, while the Asia-Pacific market's rapid growth will surpass
the American market in 2010 to account for half of the global
output.
</P>
<P>
The CEPD has completed a blueprint for RFID applications from
2006-2013 and is now promoting the deployment of RFID in the
country's free trade port zones for better operation efficiency,
the spokesman added.
