Internet manpower company CTjob will collaborate with 7-11 to
offer a 24-hour job hunting platform for unemployed persons who
can't get online, an executive of CTjob announced at a press
conference Tuesday.

<P>
The executive said the service is for people who need jobs but
lack computer skills. Job hunters can grab forms at neighborhood
7-11 stores, send their resumes to CTjob, and await interviews
from companies that CTjob regularly matches with job seekers
through internet.

CTjob invited artist Ma Chau-chun to be its "Marketing Advocate
for Saving the Unemployed." Ma had held no job for over one year
because his studio was destroyed in the 921 earthquake. He later
returned to the entertainment business with the help of friends
and now wishes to give back to those in need.

Taipei Deputy Mayor Wu Hsiou-kuang, CTjob's Chief Executive Li
Laing-yiou and Ma read the declaration, "Saving the Unemployed",
at the press conference Tuesday to kick start the 24-hour job
hunting service.
