KMT CHIEF RESIGNS, ANNOUNCES BID FOR PRESIDENCY
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taipei,  Feb.  13 (CNA) 02/13/07  19:31:29 (By Maubo Chang)
</P>
<P>
Opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Ma Ying-jeou announced his
bid for the presidency in 2008 and his resignation from his party
post Tuesday, hours after a prosecutor indicted him for stealing
NT$11 million (US$332,684) from a special allowance fund during
his term as Taipei city mayor.
</P>
<P>
Claiming innocence, Ma said he used the special allowance at
issue according to the law and that he refused to accept the
corruption charges.
</P>
<P>
The stern-faced KMT chief said he would step down from his post
as KMT chief as he had promised and would fight to clear his name
through the judicial system, which he described as a struggle not
only for him but also for thousands of active and former senior
government officials who also spend their special allowances in
the same way as him and therefore may face the same charges.
</P>
<P>
Claiming that the ruling party is going out of its way to bash
him, Ma vowed not to be knocked down.
</P>
<P>
Rather, he said, he will appeal to the people to clear his image
by entering the 2008 presidential race and vindicating his
integrity "via voter support" in the election.
</P>
<P>
In anticipation of Ma's indictment and ensuing stepdown, KMT
Secretary-General Wu Den-yih had said a day earlier that the
party's first vice chairman, Wu Poh- hsung, will take over as
acting KMT chairman and will call for the election of a new
chairman within three months.
