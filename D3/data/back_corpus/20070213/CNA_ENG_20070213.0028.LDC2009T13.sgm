LABOR AUTHORITIES TO DISCUSS FEASIBILITY OF RAISING MINIMUM WAGE
</HEADLINE>

<P>
The Council of Labor Affairs (CLA) is planning to organize a
commission following the Chinese New Year holiday to discuss the
feasibility of raising the minimum wage, which has remained
constant since 1998, CLA officials said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The current minimum wage, which came into effect Oct. 16, 1997,
is NT$15,840 (US$478.55) per month, NT$528 per day, or NT$66 per
hour.
</P>
<P>
The CLA decision to convene meetings of the "basic wage fixing
commission" by the end of May follows demands from laborer groups
who have not seen an adjustment in the minimum wage in over nine
years, the officials explained.
</P>
<P>
A proposal concerning basic wage adjustment must be endorsed by
the commission, which would then submit the proposal to the
Executive Yuan for ratification, according to the CLA.
</P>
<P>
The CLA must be very cautious in considering such an adjustment
to the basic wage because the basic salary is associated with
various social benefits including labor insurance, national
health insurance, and the wages of foreign workers and social
relief. Such an adjustment might also affect local enterprises
and the general economic development of the country, the CLA
said, noting that so far it has not yet come up with a likely
range for such an adjustment.
