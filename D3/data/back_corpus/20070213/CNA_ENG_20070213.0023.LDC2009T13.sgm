REBAR FOUNDER'S CASE TO BE HEARD TUESDAY
</HEADLINE>

An immigration official confirmed Monday that a preliminary
hearing will be held in San Pedro, California Tuesday morning to
review the case of whether Taiwan fugitive tycoon Wang You-theng
will have to leave the country.
</P>
<P>
Wang, founder of the Rebar Group, was placed on Taiwan's most
wanted list on Jan. 15 for suspected embezzlement of large
amounts of capital from the group before fleeing with his wife to
China and then on to the United States at the turn of this year.
</P>
<P>
Wang's hearing will be held at the immigration holding center in
San Pedro, where he has been detained since Feb. 2 for entering
the country without valid travel documents.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan authorities have actively been seeking to have Wang and
his wife repatriated back to Taiwan to face the charges against
them.
</P>
<P>
As Tuesday morning's hearing is preliminary to any possible
immigration procedure regarding Wang's case, its result is not
likely to present any final resolution on whether the fugitive
tycoon will be sent back to Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Wang has hired several top immigration lawyers to represent him
in the case.
</P>
<P>
According to an anonymous Los-Angeles based immigration lawyer,
Wang will probably ask to be released on bail during the hearing,
a request which is likely to be turned down.
</P>
<P>
"Unless there is some unexpected twist in events, Wang is
destined to spend the Chinese New Year Day at the immigration
holding cell," the lawyer said.
