During the event, with scores of players mobbing company booths
to try out new games, business transactions for each company grew
by 10-20 percent over last year's levels, the spokesman said,
adding that more newly developed games will hit the market
following the Feb. 17-25 Chinese New Year holiday.

Taipei Mayor Hau Lung-bin said during the event's opening
ceremony that the city government intends to make available in
public places -- including department stores and shopping malls
-- games that encourage intellectual development.
