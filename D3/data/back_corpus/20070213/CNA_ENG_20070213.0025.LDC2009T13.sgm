Rings and necklaces are the gifts Taiwanese female undergraduates
in Taiwan most wish to receive on Valentine's Day, according to
the results of a survey released Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Coming in second on the wish list are clothing (lingerie
included) and shoes, followed by a romantic candle-lit dinner,
chocolates and flowers, the survey shows.
</P>
<P>
The  survey,  conducted  recently  by a domestic  lingerie
manufacturer, Easy Shop, contacted 590 female undergraduates
around Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
The pollsters said flowers do not enjoy a high ranking on the
list because most of the respondents feel that flowers represent
a momentary vanity that is quick to wither.
</P>
<P>
Some respondents asserted that men only give flowers when they
cannot think of a gift for their lovers, the survey found.
</P>
<P>
While 20 percent of the respondents have never thought of
receiving lingerie as a Valentine's Day gift, more than 50
percent said they would feel very happy if they received such a
gift.
</P>
<P>
However, 80 percent of the respondents think it would be more
appropriate for men to present lingerie as a gift for their
lovers after they have been dating for more than six months,
according to the survey.
</P>
<P>
On the favored designs, the survey found that black lingerie
decorated with sexy lace, cute lingerie in pink, and purple
lingerie decorated with romantic ribbons are the most popular
choices.
