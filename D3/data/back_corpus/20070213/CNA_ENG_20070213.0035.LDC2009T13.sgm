FORMER TAIPEI MAYOR INDICTED ON CHARGES OF EMBEZZLEMENT
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  Feb.  13  (CNA) 02/13/07  19:43:41 (By Han Nai-kuo)
</P>
<P>
The chairman of the main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) was indicted
Tuesday on charges of embezzling from a special allowance fund
designated for his discretionary use while he served as Taipei
mayor from 1998 to 2006.
</P>
<P>
The anti-corruption  center  under  the Taiwan  High Court
Prosecutor's Office formally indicted Ma Ying-jeou on charges
that he embezzled NT$11.17 million (US$337,650) from the mayoral
special allowance during his two mayoral terms.
</P>
<P>
Prosecutor Hou Kuan-jen said in the indictment that Ma received
NT$10.23 million in special allowances during his first term from
December 1998 to December 2003.
</P>
<P>
However, the expenditure records of Ma's bank accounts show that
he spent only NT$3.49 million of that amount but did not return
the unspent portion -- NT$6.74 million -- to the national
coffers, Hou continued.
</P>
<P>
From January 2004 to July 2006, Ma used NT$630,000 of the NT$5.06
million fund and kept the remaining NT$4.43 million in his
account.
</P>
<P>
Hou contended that the unspent money during his two terms,
totaling  NT$11.7 million, should  be considered  "gain  from
embezzlement."
</P>
<P>
Hou rejected an interpretation by the Ministry of Justice last
November that special allowance funds for executives of
government departments are actually meant as salary subsidies.
</P>
<P>
"The view raised by the Ministry of Justice alone is not shared
by others and contradicts the rules and regulations set by the
Cabinet and the Ministry of Finance governing the use of special
allowance funds," Hou said.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out further that Ma had acknowledged when he was first
summoned for questioning last year that the special allowance
fund was not part of his salary and should have been spent
completely on office-related affairs.
</P>
<P>
Although taking note of the fact that Ma and his wife donated
tens of millions of dollars to charitable organizations during
his mayoral terms, Hou argued that those donations came mostly
from Ma's unspent election campaign funds rather from his special
allowance funds.
</P>
<P>
All executives  holding public office are given a special
allowance fund every month. Although the money is left up to the
administrative chief's discretion, half of the fund can be spent
without any proof of spending, while use of the other half must
be substantiated with receipts.
</P>
<P>
Hou began his investigation into Ma's alleged misuse of fund in
August last year after Legislator Hsieh Hsin-ni complained that
Ma had channeled money from the fund into his private bank
accounts.
</P>
<P>
Ma contended on a TV show a week earlier that he had no intention
of breaking the law because he considered the fund set aside for
his discretionary use as "private money," as it is regarded by
every other recipient of similar funds in Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
He argued that if he is found guilty, then the same fate will
befall  almost all government  executives, including  political
heavyweights of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party and
everyone who has ever served as a mayor or county magistrate.
