Tai wan has obtained permission from the governments of Chile and
Australia to export Taiwan-grown mangoes and lychees to the two
countries this year, officials of the Bureau of Animal and Plant
Health Inspection and Quarantine under the Council of Agriculture
(COA) said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The bureau signed with Chilean authorities a working plan last
year on quarantine measures regarding Taiwan's mango shipments to
Chile as well as an agreement on Taiwan mango exports to the
South American country. Since the importing country has ratified
the working plan and agreement, COA officials said, Taiwan can
start shipping the fruit to the country this year.
</P>
<P>
In Australia, relevant authorities have also recently ratified
similar agreements, allowing Taiwan to begin exporting mangoes to
the country this year, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
Under the quarantine regulations,  mangoes have to undergo heat-
steaming before they are transported to the two countries, the
officials noted.
</P>
<P>
Before the first batch of mangoes are shipped, the COA will
invite Chilean and Australian officials in charge of quarantine
affairs to visit the island to inspect the steaming and relevant
operations, the officials said.
