KMT SHOULD CONTINUE BOOSTING CROSS-STRAIT TIES: HONORARY CHAIRMAN
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  Feb.  13 (CNA) 02/13/07  19:26:24 (By Elisa Kao)

Lien Chan, the honorary chairman of the opposition Kuomintang
(KMT) , said Tuesday that the KMT should continue to work towards
reconciliation with the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) as their
previous efforts have contributed significantly to the
improvement of cross-Taiwan Strait relations.
</P>
<P>
Lien made the remarks at a meeting organized by the KMT's think
tank on KMT-CCP affairs.
</P>
<P>
According to Lien, the two parties have made intensive efforts to
strengthen bilateral ties during the last year, including the
organization of two economic forums and a meeting on the
interests of Taiwanese businessmen with operations in China.
</P>
<P>
In those meetings, the two parties have reached a consensus on
many issues and are implementing some of the agreements, Lien
said, adding that these measures have won the support of many
Taiwanese people and businessmen with operations in China.
</P>
<P>
However,  Lien expressed regret that the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) has been trying to mislead the public by
offering misinformation regarding  China's good-will  gestures,
including a decision to offer tariff- free treatment to some of
Taiwan's fruit exports.
</P>
<P>
Noting that although Taiwan's agricultural produce has entered
China and proven popular on that market, Lien said Taiwan's fruit
exporters still can not expand their market share in China due to
the high cost of transportation between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
Lien suggested that KMT continue making efforts to resolve the
problems of Taiwan people and seek the maximum benefits for
people on both sides of the Taiwan Strait.
