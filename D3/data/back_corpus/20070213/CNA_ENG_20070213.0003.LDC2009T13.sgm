REDESIGNATION NOT AIMED AT DENYING HISTORY: PRESIDENT

President Chen Shui-bian said Monday that renaming the state-
owned Chinese Petroleum Corp. as CPC Corp., Taiwan is not aimed
at completely denying history but rather at having a company
worthy of its name.

<P>
Chen made the remarks while presiding over a plaque-unveiling
ceremony to mark the redesignation of Chinese Petroleum Corp.
(CPC) as CPC Corp. Taiwan as part of the government's efforts to
prevent state-owned enterprises from being confused with
similarly named Chinese ones.

"As the petroleum company was inaugurated in Shanghai in 1946 and
moved its headquarters to Taipei along with the previous
Kuomintang government in 1949, the government has decided to
preserve 'chung' -- which means China -- in its Chinese title to
retain its historical roots," Chen explained, adding that he
believes that the inclusion of "Taiwan" in the company's new
English title will bring even more business opportunity to "CPC
Corp. Taiwan."
</P>
<P>
In their respective board meetings held last Friday, the Chinese
Petroleum Corp. decided to change its name to "CPC Corp., Taiwan,
" China Shipbuilding Corp. decided to change its name to "CSBC
Corp., Taiwan" and Chunghwa Post Co. decided to change its name
to "Taiwan Post Co."
</P>

Chen said the postal company was first inaugurated in Taiwan in
1888 and the shipbuilding firms was established in Taiwan in the
1970s. "Both of them originated in Taiwan, so their new titles do
not carry any Chinese references," he added.
