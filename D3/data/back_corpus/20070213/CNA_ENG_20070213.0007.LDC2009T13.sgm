NAME RECTIFICATION 'A MATTER OF COURSE': MAC CHIEF
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taipei,  Feb.  13 (CNA) 02/13/07  12:18:14 (By Sofia Wu)
</P>
<P>
Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) Chairman Joseph Wu said Monday
that Taiwan's ongoing name rectification campaign to remove any
references to China from the names of its state-owned enterprises
is a matter of course following the country's democratization.
</P>
<P>
Speaking in a meeting with a German Bundestag delegation, the
country's top China policy planner pointed out that many of
Taiwan's stated-owned companies and institutions have kept the
words "China" or "Chinese" in their names, which he said has
often caused confusion in the international community.
</P>
<P>
Noting  that the practice  dates  back to the period  of
authoritarian rule by the Kuomintang (KMT) , Wu said the
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) administration is obligated to
tackle the legacies of that era, such as renaming state-owned
companies by including the word "Taiwan" to make them more
identifiable with their country of origin.
</P>
<P>
Acknowledging that the name change campaign has met criticism and
sparked heated debate in local society and even drawn a "no
support" comment from Washington, Wu said the campaign is a
matter of course now that Taiwan has become a democracy and must
address issues remaining from the period of authoritarian rule.
</P>
<P>
Wu further said many of Taiwan's national symbols are legacies of
the previous one-party state era. For instance, Taiwan's national
emblem is the KMT's party emblem, and its national anthem is the
KMT's party anthem, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Since Taiwan is a democratic country and the KMT is no longer its
ruling party, Wu said, the people of Taiwan are entitled to
freely discuss whether its national symbols should be changed.
</P>
<P>
Wu also pointed to the national titles of the two sides of the
Taiwan Strait, saying that the close resemblance between the two
has caused problems for both sides. Wu recalled a faux pas made
by the master of a welcoming ceremony for Chinese President Hu
Jintao during his visit to the United States last year when he
announced the playing of the national anthem of "the Republic of
China" -- Taiwan's national title -- instead of "the People's
Republic of China" -- China's official name.
</P>
<P>
A similar gaffe happened recently in Grenada, with the Caribbean
nation's marching band playing the national anthem of "the
Republic of China" instead of that of the "People's Republic of
China" during the inaugural ceremony of a China-funded stadium in
the country.
</P>
<P>
To help the international community better understand that the
"Republic of China" refers to democratic Taiwan, not
authoritarian China, Wu said, the government has arranged for
Taiwan's embassies to have the word "Taiwan" added in parenthesis
to their names. He said progress has also been made in
negotiations with countries with which Taiwan  does  not maintain
diplomatic relations  for similar arrangements for Taiwan's
representative offices in those countries.
</P>
<P>
No matter how these issues are discussed or addressed, Wu said,
the government's policy is crystal clear, namely that "so long as
China has no intention of using force against Taiwan, Taiwan will
not change its official title nor its anthem."
</P>
<P>
"This has been our commitment to the international community
since 2000, " Wu said, adding that the government's current name
rectification campaign will by no means touch on Taiwan's
official title.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Wu took the opportunity to voice his protest over
China's customary addressing of Taiwan as "China, Taipei, "
"China, Taiwan, " or "Taiwan Province of the People's Republic of
China" on international occasions.
</P>
<P>
While China repeatedly threatens war if Taiwan takes steps to
formalize its de facto independence, including changing its
official title, it arbitrarily changes Taiwan's national title
all the time, Wu said.
</P>
<P>
Equally disheartening and unfair to democratic Taiwan is that the
international community has consistently kept mum over China's
arbitrary change of Taiwan's official designation, he lamented.
