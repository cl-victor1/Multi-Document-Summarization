Igara said the population in the area affected by the tsunami was 8,000 to 10,000 people .
`` Officers are now visiting the affected villages and areas to establish the whereabouts , safety and health of the population , '' he said .
McLachlan said the aircraft were ferrying 60 medical personnel with the aim of setting up a mobile hospital in the area .
Dalle said the Nimas village near the Sissano lagoon , the Warapu village and the Arop village had been wiped out , and the Malol village had almost been completely destroyed .
However , he said that how quickly the medical crew could get to work would depend on whether the landing strip at Wanimo was long enough for the C130s to land and the possibility of further earthquakes .
