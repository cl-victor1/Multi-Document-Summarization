In one of the blasts , close to the wall of the irrigation department , four people were injured .
There was no claim of responsibility for the attacks , the latest in a series of small explosions to hit the state-run rail network in the province .
Authorities were also hunting the culprits behind the bombing of the Chiltan Express train heading from the eastern city of Lahore to Quetta , the latest in a series of attacks on the rail network in Baluchistan .
A parliamentary committee has been set up to examine the grievances of the tribesmen in Baluchistan , which was roiled by insurgency in the 1970s , and make recommendations to the government .
