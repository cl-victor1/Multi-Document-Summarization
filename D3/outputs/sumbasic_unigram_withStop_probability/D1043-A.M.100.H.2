Hariri and the other victims were then laid to rest in the grounds of the new mosque .
Ambulances carrying the coffin of Hariri and six of his bodyguards and a paramedic who were also killed in the blast , were brought to a halt at the edge of the square .
The red flags of the Druse leader Walid Jumblatt 's Socialist Party and the green cedar flags of the Phalangist Party , also enemies in the war , fluttered together in the sea of people that descended into the funeral grounds in front of the unfinished Amin Mosque .
Earlier in the day , Hariri was killed in a powerful explosion in the Lebanese capital of Beirut .
