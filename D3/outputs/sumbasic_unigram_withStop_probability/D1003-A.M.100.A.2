The reappearance of the panda in the western parts of the Qinling mountains was attributed to recent efforts by the government to restore the region 's natural habitat , the report said .
The rarity of the bamboo-chomping bears , along with the variety and beauty of the area 's landscape and ecology , were cited as reasons for the application to the UN , the Shanghai Morning Post said .
If the situation worsens all the pandas in the reserve will have to be transferred elsewhere .
Bamboo blooming in the early 1980s caused the deaths of about 250 giant pandas , the report said .
The giant pandas are predominantly found in the Wolong , Siguniang and Jiajinshan areas of the province , near the cities of Chengdu and Yaan .
