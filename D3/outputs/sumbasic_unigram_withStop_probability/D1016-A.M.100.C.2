The offices of the attorney general , chief public prosecutor and public prosecutor have asked the public to provide information about the wealth of officials to help the team in its investigations , the spokesman said .
`` We would not take the initiative ( to launch the investigation ) , it has to come from the country of origin of the person ( suspected of having illegally-gained deposits ) , '' he added .
Commenting on the stand of the Golkar on the subject , the Jakarta Post said , `` This is another display of their halfhearted commitment to clean up corruption .
It said it would be more relevant if the call for the probe into the riches of the former president and his family was made part of the decree on corruption , collusion and nepotism .
