Heaped like a pile of rocks in the middle of the boat was the morning 's haul -- oysters , the rough and craggy bottom dwellers that have been the shining jewels of the Chesapeake Bay for generations .

Uphill and upstream from the bay , thousands of acres of Pennsylvania crop- and pastureland abut the banks of the Susquehanna or the creeks and streams that feed it .
