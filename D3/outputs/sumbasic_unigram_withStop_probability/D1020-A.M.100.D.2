In the Bil Mar Foods case , the Agriculture Department left the announcement of the recall to the company .
The investigation into the source and cause of the outbreak was continuing , he said .
`` Those people are one of the highest-risk populations in the country , '' Osterholm said .
A person answering the telephone at the plant Monday said no one could comment about the scale of the recall .
And that recall was at the end of 1997 , the only recall of that year .
The number of people who inspect the food has remained the same .
Consumers may return the recalled products to the place of purchase for a full refund .
