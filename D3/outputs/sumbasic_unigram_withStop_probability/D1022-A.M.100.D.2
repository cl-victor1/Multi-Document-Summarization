Tokyo has declined to release details of the expanded hunt ahead of the IWC Scientific Committee 's consideration of the proposal in the three weeks prior to the IWC 's full meeting .
However , Allsop granted the animal rights group permission to appeal his decision to the full bench of the Federal Court .
Challenging the plans in the World Court should be considered , said Fitzsimons .
Attorney-General Philip Ruddock said the judge had upheld the government 's view that it was not appropriate to pursue the campaign against whaling in the Australian courts .
`` The Australian government has the view that the attempt to enforce the EPBC Act ( to stop the killing of whales ) may upset the diplomatic status quo ... and may be contrary to Australia 's long term national interests , '' he said .
