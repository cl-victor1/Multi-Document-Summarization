The SEPA confirmed the `` major pollution '' of the Songhua River on Wednesday .
The blast of the petrochemical plant happened about 350 kilometer away from the China-Russia boundary .
The enlarged water current would not only help dilute pollution in the river , but also slowed down freezing of the river water downstream .
The flow is expected to return to 600 cubic meters per second in the evening .
`` It is the chemical plant of the CNPC in Jilin province . ''
Several river monitoring stations reported that benzene density in the front strip of the pollutants was 28.56 times of the national standard as of 4:00 p.m. Wednesday , the spokesman said .
