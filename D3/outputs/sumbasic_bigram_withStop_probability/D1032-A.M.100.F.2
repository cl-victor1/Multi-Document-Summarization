`` It means that we lost control of the pressure in one of the rigs , '' after a gas leak around 7:00 pm ( 1800 GMT ) , he said .
No one was hurt , he said .
The group was evacuated by helicopter from the Snorre A platform which is operated by Norway 's Statoil , Terje Largaas , a rescue official at Sola in the southwest of the country , told AFP .
The shutdown of Snorre and production in the nearby Vigdis field cut Norway 's production by 205,000 barrels of oil a day , or 6.4 percent of the nation 's roughly 3.2 million barrel daily production .
