rafik hariri was the antithesis of osama bin laden .
crowds had begun jamming the streets in martyr 's square in downtown beirut since 9:30 a.m .
hariri was buried in the unfinished mosque which he had financed after the mass funeral procession escorting an ambulance carrying hariri 's coffin covered with national flag marched through the main streets to the mosque in central beirut .
the islamic call to prayer was mixed with sounds of church bells and mourners chanting slogans of reverence for the former prime minister .
