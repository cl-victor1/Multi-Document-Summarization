In his latest ruling Monday , he said the defense argument applies only `` when the government compels an individual to incriminate himself , '' which he says did n't happen in Kaczynski 's case , news reports said .
Burrell said he 'll form the panel when he has 12 jurors and six alternates .
Justice Department sources said Reno agreed to prosecutors ' request and had authorized the death penalty in the case , and said the decision was expected to be disclosed in a court filing later on Thursday in Sacramento , California , where the case is pending .
Prosecutors have said they hope to decide before January whether to seek the death penalty , which Kaczynski could also face for the two California bombing deaths .
Media reports said Kaczynski 's lawyers requested the transfer , which was completed Wednesday , 10 weeks before his trial begins in Sacramento .
He also said reports of harassment against witnesses -- submitted by attorneys on both sides of the case -- meet the test for juror anonymity spelled out by the 9th U.S .
Burrell said the request had to be rejected because the defense had failed to show that using the voter rolls the impact of pretrial news coverage .
