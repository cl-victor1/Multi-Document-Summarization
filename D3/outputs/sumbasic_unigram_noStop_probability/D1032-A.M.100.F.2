But it will take some time before these efforts will be completed , '' the company said .
Statoil said it did not know when production would be able to resume .
`` We do not want to speculate on when we can resume production , '' Hetland said .
She also said the chances of repairs on Saturday also looked `` very hit-and-run . ''
`` The safety aspect has top priority at the moment , '' Reinertsen said .
`` We are trying to seal the leak so that we can resume production as early as possible , '' he said .
There are a number of things we need information about , '' he said , adding that a startup this week is unlikely .
Once repairs are made , Eide said production could be back to normal within a day .
He said the leak was discovered during an attempt to drill a sidetrack from an injection well .
Activities at the neighbouring Snorre B platform were not affected for the time being , Hetland said .
Statoil however said it could take some time to reach even such limited production goals .
`` At the moment it is unclear when production from Snorre A and Vigdis will resume , '' Statoil said in a statement .
All other considerations will have to wait , '' Oeivind Reinertsen , a senior Statoil executive , said in a statement .
