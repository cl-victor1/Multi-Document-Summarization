At first , he thought the nearby power station had been struck , he said .
He said that another factory in the suburb of Kafouri also made chemical weapons .
A hospital spokesman said earlier that 10 people wounded from the strike were admitted to the wards .
`` Most people here , even those who are anti-government , do not believe this particular factory was making chemical weapons , '' one man said .
But another longtime opposition supporter , a lawyer , said he believed the Americans knew what they were doing .
`` Bin Laden has never built a factory for medicines in his life , '' said the lawyer .
`` We have undeniable proof '' that the plant was only used for pharmaceutical products such as children 's and anti-malarial medicines , he said .
Some said they were skeptical that the pharmaceutical plant was a cover for preparing chemical warfare agents .
He said the enterprise made 30 varieties of drugs for humans , and 23 kinds of veterinary medicines .
As part of its case that the plant was a benign operation , government officials said that it was owned by a Sudanese businessman , Salah Idrisse , who is also a citizen of Saudi Arabia .
