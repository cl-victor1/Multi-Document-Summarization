`` He said he would do anything to protect that child , '' Samuels said .
`` Those monsters will never get her , '' Blake said .
Blake `` is a man of emotions , '' Schwartzbach said .
He said neither man had been solicited by Blake .
Jurors want to hear from the defendant , she said .
`` It does n't matter what you think of Bonny , '' Samuels said .
`` He was looking for somebody who would be willing to do an assassination , '' she said .
He said there was no need to divorce her because they were going to make a go of it .
`` That 's what this case is all about , the defendant getting what he wants , '' Samuels said .
`` For Blake , there are a lot of ways to lose , '' said Levenson .
But Samuels said no one saw Blake return to the restaurant .
When that failed , the prosecutor said , he tried to abduct their daughter .
One witness said the actor appeared to be `` turning it on and off . ''
`` He was tricked by Bonny Lee and he hated her for it , '' Samuels said .
He said that she had another house in suburban Thousand Oaks and she could do it there .
But if you can make the jury laugh , Seville said , `` you are going to be more persuasive . ''
`` He 'd come to terms with the fact that it was family , '' the lawyer said .
