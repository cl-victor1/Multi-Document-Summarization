The US Geological Survey  USGS  said the volcano  which killed 57 people during a major eruption in 1980  was shaken by a  tremor burst  for 25 minutes
The history of this volcano suggests that this could be the opening salvo of more eruptions   he said adding that the small 1986 eruption was similar to the latest one

The signal  was far stronger after today s steam eruption  than the tremor that followed Friday s blast  Steele said
The earthquakes quit after the eruption  said University of Washington seismologist Tony Qamar
