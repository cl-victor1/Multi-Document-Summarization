Blake  is a man of emotions   Schwartzbach said
The prosecution case depended heavily on the testimony of two retired stuntmen who said that Blake solicited them to kill Bakley
He said neither man had been solicited by Blake
The defense established on cross-examination of Smith that the story never said Blake asked Gary McLarty to kill Bakley
One witness said the actor appeared to be  turning it on and off But Blake s lawyer  pointing out that no blood  DNA or other evidence directly links Blake to the 2001 slaying of Bonny Lee Bakley  said prosecutors were relying on a drug-using liar as a key witness and a bungled police investigation
