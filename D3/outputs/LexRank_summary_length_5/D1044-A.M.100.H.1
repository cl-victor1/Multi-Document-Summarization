The dye  known as Sudan I  is linked to an increased risk of cancer  but is not thought to be a risk to health at the concentrations used in these products  said a BBC report
The vast majority of products contaminated with the illegal dye Sudan I have been removed from sale   the agency said in a statement
It has ordered supermarkets over the past week to discard a growing list of food tainted by the illegal Sudan I dye and instructed food manufacturers to reveal any other affected products
The Food Standards Agency said it was working with the food industry and local authorities to make sure that all the affected products are removed from the shelves and urged members of the public who have them in their cupboards to contact the store where they were bought for a refund
Britain s food safety watchdog ordered the recall of more than 350 food products Friday after it said that a potentially cancer-causing dye had been discovered
