On Monday  Hariri and eight other people were killed in a huge explosion  which occurred as Hariri s motorcade was passing by in the seafront area of the Lebanese capital Beirut
Hariri was important to Lebanon as a politician and a symbol
He was Rafik Hariri  a former and a future prime minister of Lebanon
It was too early to say who killed Hariri who resigned as prime minister last October though oppositions held Syria and its allied Lebanese government responsible for Hariri s murder
Walid Eido  a member of Hariri s parliamentary bloc  also blamed Lebanese authorities  saying   This government is responsible for the killing of Rafik Hariri
