The advantage of mangroves is severalfold   Cripps said
Damage from the Indian Ocean tsunami could have been significantly reduced if more coastal areas had maintained their protective shields of mangrove swamps and coral reefs  conservation groups said Thursday
The damage inflicted to mangroves by the Dec 26 tsunami was still being assessed  and changes in soil salinity or fresh water inflow might cause further damage in the longer-term  the agency said in a statement
But  he said  it remains unclear whether mangroves and coral reefs had a significant protective effect against a  tsunami on the scale that we ve just witnessed
To avoid tsunami  people should neither reside in the areas close to coastlines nor destroy mangrove forests that protect tidal waves  he said from the agency s compound in Bandung  West Java
