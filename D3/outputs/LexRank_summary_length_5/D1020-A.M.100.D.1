The number of people who inspect the food has remained the same
The outbreak led to the recall on Tuesday of certain lots of hot dogs and packaged meat produced at the Bil Mar Foods plant in Zeeland  Mich  and sold throughout the United States
The agency is studying whether some of the Bil Mar products might contain the Listeria bacteria
However  USDA officials said they did not feel comfortable recommending a recall until they found a package of unopened meat with the bacterium at the plant
The Agriculture Department announced the recall Friday night
