The Snorre A offshore oil platform is unlikely to resume production this week after being shut down by a natural gas leak because more time is needed to review plans  the Norwegian Petroleum Safety Authority said Thursday
Norwegian oil group Statoil said on Tuesday that it had yet to resume production on two of its platforms after a gas leak forced it to shut down operations earlier this week  cutting Norway s total oil output by 200000 barrels per day
Norwegian oil group Statoil said on Monday that it was trying to seal off a gas leak on a platform in the North Sea where production had been suspended and most employees evacuated owing to the risk of an explosion
Norwegian oil group Statoil said on Wednesday that it remained  unclear  when it would be able to resume production on two of its platforms after a gas leak forced it to shut down operations earlier this week
Statoil has proposed resuming full production on Vigdis  75000 bpd   and partial production on Snorre A  by pumping up oil through underwater extensions while repairs continue on the platform itself
