Exercise alone was enough to prevent the degeneration of brain cells in rats with Parkinson s disease  University of Pittsburgh researchers report

The rats also had significantly greater amounts of the protein GDNF  which the University of Pittsburgh scientists speculate may protect brain cells from oxygen damage produced by the disease
The 84-year-old has Parkinson s disease  which makes it difficult for him to walk and to pronounce his words
