living space for gibbons fell dramatically with increasing human population , deterioration of forest environments , and excessive cutting of tropical rain forests .
han xingguo , of the xishuangbanna tropical botanical garden , says that the himalayas acts as a natural protective screen , stopping cold air from the north , while warm , moist air from the indian ocean brings plentiful rain .
protecting the area means protecting an important gene storehouse , han says .
gibbons are regarded as an animal indicator in the tropical rain forest .
