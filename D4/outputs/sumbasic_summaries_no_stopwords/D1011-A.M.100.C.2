About one out of every five people with an eating disorder will die from the disease .
It may take 5 to 10 years .
But Kearney-Cooke says that need n't be the case .
The stress led her to control the one thing she could -- her body .
For Hecht , the eating disorders were part of her life for many years , but she did n't admit it to herself , and others , until the mid-1990s .
When they hit 50 and could n't lose weight , it resurfaced .
Six years later , she still keeps the letter .
