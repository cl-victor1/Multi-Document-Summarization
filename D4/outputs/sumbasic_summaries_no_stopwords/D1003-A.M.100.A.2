The three Beijing giant pandas about to leave were born respectively in 1991 , 1999 and 2003 , and one of the three Sichuan pandas was also born last year .
But in Sichuan and in Shaanxi province , which also has panda reserves , arrow bamboo has also been found blooming .
The giant pandas will not eat the bamboo after it blooms and it takes 10 years for a new supply to grow .
Wang Wanyun , head of the bureau 's Wildlife Protection section , said that traces of giant pandas have also been left and spotted in neighboring Zhouzhi and Liuba counties over the past two years .
