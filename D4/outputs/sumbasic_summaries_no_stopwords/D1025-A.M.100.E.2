In Yellowstone Park , about 30 people have been injured and two killed in bear attacks since 1975 .
Female grizzlies do not reproduce until they are about 8 years old , and generally have litters of one or two cubs every four or five years .
At least 25 bears died in the greater Yellowstone area last year , including eight breeding-age females killed by people .
Once the proposal is announced , there would be a period of public comment , and it could be months before a final decision is made .
`` Even if you start with 500 bears , an annual decline of 2 percent to 5 percent over 15 to 30 years could take them down to 200 . ''
