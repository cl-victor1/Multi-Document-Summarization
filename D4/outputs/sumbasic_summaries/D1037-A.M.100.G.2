Still , he said , it might be two years before the changes go through .
Just a few years ago , there were thousands of people oystering in Maryland ; this year , they expect fewer than 150 .
When they applied this year , many of the plants were shut out , officials say .
In an earlier time , they would have been prepping their dredges for oyster season , but most wo n't be dredging this year .
`` Now people can not say , 'Rebecca , we do n't know what needs to be done , ' `` she said .
