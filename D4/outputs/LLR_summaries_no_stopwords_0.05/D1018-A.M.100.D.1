Police Superintendent Jan van der Straaten refused to identify Croes by name Friday but said that the latest detainee was arrested based on information provided by one of the three young men already in custody .
A three-block area of beach near the Aruba Marriott Resort was closed as police combed the sand and nearby dunes and drained a nearby swampy area while searching for 18-year-old Natalee Holloway .
It was not immediately clear why van der Sloot had not been allowed to see his son or whether the youth 's mother had been allowed to .
