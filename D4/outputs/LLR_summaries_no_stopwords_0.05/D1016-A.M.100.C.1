local and foreign reports have accused soeharto of amassing wealth illegally during his 32-year reign and stashing the fortune overseas .
indonesian foreign affairs minister ali alatas said earlier this week that his ministry was ready to assist the attorney general 's office in rescuing state assets possibly stashed abroad during the soeharto era .
ghalib came under fire after he said on monday that he believed soeharto 's public denial of charges that he had accumulated a fortune worth billions of u.s. dollars during his rule .
