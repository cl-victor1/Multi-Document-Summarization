A judge heard motions Friday from lawyers for the two brothers  Deepak Kalpoe  21  and Satish Kalpoe  18  and a Dutch youth  Joran Van Der Sloot  17 -- the three prime suspects in the case  who were the last people known to have seen Holloway before she disappeared in the wee hours of May 30
While Aruban police were present during the questioning of van der Sloot  which lasted until about 3 am  officers left the talking to Holloway s family until things began to get  heated   Bearman said
Two one-time security guards were taken into custody because van der Sloot and the brothers said they saw Holloway outside the hotel with a security guard  but both have since been released
Judge Bob Wit  who was sent in from the neighboring Dutch island of Curacao  extended the detention of Joran van der Sloot  17  and brothers  Deepak Kalpoe  21  and Satish Kalpoe  18  for eight days  said Mariaine Croes  who is not related to the fourth detainee
Those are the same suspicions prosecutors have used to hold three suspects who have been in custody for eleven days  Joran Van Der Sloot  17  and brother Deepak Kalpoe  21  and Satish Kalpoe  18
