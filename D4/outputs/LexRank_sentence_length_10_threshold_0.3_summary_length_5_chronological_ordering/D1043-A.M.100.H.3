Hariri had joined a chorus of objection to interference in Lebanon s internal affairs
It was too early to say who killed Hariri who resigned as prime minister last October though oppositions held Syria and its allied Lebanese government responsible for Hariri s murder
But Hariri s supporters have accused Syria and the Lebanese government of orchestrating the assassination
They came from throughout the country in an emotional and politically charged tribute to Hariri  the former prime minister  billionaire developer and architect of Lebanon s revival from a devastating 15-year civil war
Hariri  a popular figure to many in Lebanon and a central figure in reconstructing the country after a devastating 15-year civil war  was assassinated on Monday in an explosion that many here believe was the work of Syria  whose forces have played a dominant role in Lebanon since the 1970s
