Attorney General Soedjono C. Atmonegoro said last week that the government has started an investigation into the wealth of former government officials , including former President Soeharto and his family .
The government prosecutor 's office would continue a thorough investigation into the wealth while the land would be seized for the state or returned to its original owners , Hasan said .
The Indonesian government has set up two teams to investigate alleged corruption by Soeharto as well as his wealth .
Soeharto , who had ruled Indonesia for the last 32 years , resigned on May 21 under the heavy pressure from the people demanding for total reforms in political , economic and legal fields .
