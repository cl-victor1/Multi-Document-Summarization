That recall  and one in January of about 30 million pounds of hot dogs and luncheon meat from the Thorn Apple Valley plant in Arkansas  represent most of the increase in the pounds pulled from shelves for listeria contamination in recent years
But no illnesses have been reported in connection to the beef produced on that day and the company said it had notified the US Department of Agriculture  which was testing the product
There have been many large outbreaks of food-borne illness in the last year  including one just last week that made a New York woman ill and resulted in the recall of 172000 pounds of ground-beef patties contaminated with the deadly bacteria E coli O157  H7
The Agriculture Department said it has no evidence  however  linking the product to a nationwide listeriosis outbreak that is under investigation
To its credit  the Agriculture Department has announced recalls of processed meats contaminated with listeria from four other companies in the last four months  most recently last weekend
