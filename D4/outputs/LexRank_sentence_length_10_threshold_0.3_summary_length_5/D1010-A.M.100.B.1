Chen Lu-hung  director of the health department s Bureau of Food Sanitation  noted that although there was only a single case of mad cow disease found in the United States  the actual situation in the United States has to be evaluated
The EU said the program was one of 82 programs tackling 10 major animal diseases  including rabies  mad cow  and scrapie  a similar brain-wasting disease found in sheep
An EU ban on British beef and widespread cattle culls followed the 1996 alert  but by then the disease had spread to other countries
Canada has been testing cattle for BSE since 1992  but boosted testing levels after a single case of mad cow disease was found in Alberta in May 2003
According to statistics released by the US Department of Agriculture  testing for mad cow disease from June 1 to Oct 17 on 85812 cows came up negative  indicating that there is very little chance that American cows have mad cow disease  or bovine spongiform encephalopathy
