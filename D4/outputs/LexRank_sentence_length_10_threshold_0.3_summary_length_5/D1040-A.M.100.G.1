At one point in the trial  which began in December  retired Hollywood stuntman Roy  Snuffy  Harrison  who said Blake had asked him to kill Bakley  was being pressed by Samuels on a bit of testimony that seemed to suffer from faulty memory She handed him a transcript of his earlier testimony and asked him to refer to it  as is common in criminal trials 
During his daylong summation of the two-month trial  M Gerald Schwartzbach also disputed the accounts of several prosecution witnesses that Blake acted oddly the night his wife was killed  and denied that his client was acting when he wailed and moaned at the crime scene
The prosecution case depended heavily on the testimony of two retired stuntmen who said that Blake solicited them to kill Bakley
The prosecutor said that in the story Cole McLarty stated that Blake had talked of Bakley and  he did nt like Bonny  did nt approve of her lifestyle and wanted her out of the way
Prosecutors have built their case on the testimony of stuntmen Gary McLarty and Ronald  Duffy  Hambleton  who each testified Blake asked them to  pop  or  snuff  his wife  laying out multiple scenarios to kill her including one involving the restaurant near where she was killed May 4  2001
