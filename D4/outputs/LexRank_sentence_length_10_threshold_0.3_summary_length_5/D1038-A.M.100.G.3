When the eruption ended  government monitoring instruments showed a sharp decrease in the seismic activity that in recent days had been registering as many as four small earthquakes per minute on the mountain  located in a sparsely populated area of southwest Washington
Volcanic experts have been warning of a possible imminent eruption of Mount St Helens for several days as seismic activity in the area grew  This is exactly the eruption we predicted   the USGS s
Then  as in the last week  a swarm of small quakes rumbled around the dome  a bulge 925 feet high and a half-mile wide at the center of the crater  but then the ground quieted without a new eruption
Once scientists realized this weekend that an eruption could be imminent  spectators were ordered to leave an observatory five miles from the crater
Although geologists said the probability for another eruption is high  they predict it would not be anything like that of 1980
