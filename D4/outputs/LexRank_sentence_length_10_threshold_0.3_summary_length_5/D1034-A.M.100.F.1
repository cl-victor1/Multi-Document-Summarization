About one third of amphibians are under threat of extinction  according to researchers who carried out a global census
Isolated reports of silent forests and empty streams began to circulate about three decades ago  but the latest assessment is the first to provide a complete snapshot of a global decline in the diversity of frogs  salamanders  newts  and worm-like caecilians  and to show that they are at greater risk than both birds and mammals
Perhaps hundreds of varieties of frogs and salamanders are being wiped out before they are even discovered  Wake said
Frogs and other amphibians have been vanishing worldwide over the past few decades
That means as many as 55 percent of all known amphibians  more than 3000  could be on the verge of extinction  plus scores of species that have yet to be identified
