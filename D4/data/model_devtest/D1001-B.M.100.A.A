Columbine investigators determined that perpetrators acted alone but did arrest a 22 year old, Mark Manes, for selling the weapons to Klebold's girlfriend, who was directed to Manes by a pizza parlor employee.
The massacre wounded total was set at 23 and crosses were put in Littleton, including two for the perpetrators, whose pictures were to be included in the Columbine yearbook, as well as some of their clique dubbed the Trenchcoat Mafia.
President Clinton was to visit and also chair a special White House Commission.
The House Judiciary Committee opened hearings on the massacre.
