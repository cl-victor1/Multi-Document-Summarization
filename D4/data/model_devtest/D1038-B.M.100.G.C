Scientists monitoring activity of Mt.
St. Helens on Oct. 4 explained a steam plume soaring 1000-2000 feet above the volcano's crater as a result of hot material in the mountain contacting glacial water causing boiling and bursting steam.
They predicted a more serious eruption.
The next morning, for the fifth straight day, the volcano spat up a towering cloud of steam and ash.
U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) volcanologist Jacob Lowenstern said the activity might last weeks or months.
Seismic activity diminished and on Oct. 6 USGS announced that Mt.
St. Helens was no longer about to erupt.
