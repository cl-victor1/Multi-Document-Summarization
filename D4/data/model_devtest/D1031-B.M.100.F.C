A UN-sponsored conference in Paris opened Jan. 24, 2005 to draw environmental lessons learned from the Dec. 26 tsunami.
Speakers said that coastlines vulnerable to tsunamis should nurture healthy coral reefs, beds of sea grass and mangrove swamps, natural buffers against killer waves.
The death toll of more than 227,000 was due in part to earlier destruction of these buffers.
Several countries are now planning to plant mangroves as protection against tidal waves.
Myanmar has attributed its escape from serious tsunami damage as in part due to unspoiled mangroves and coral islands.
