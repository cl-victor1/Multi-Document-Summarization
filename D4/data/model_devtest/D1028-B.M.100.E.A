When the trial phase of alleged Unabomber Kaczynski began in January 1998, it was halted by unhappiness with defense lawyers, who earlier abandoned plans portraying him as a paranoid schizophrenic.
The judge ruled against him.
Kaczynski then reportedly attempted suicide but agreed to psychiatric tests so he could act as his own lawyer.
Some weeks later, he pleaded guilty to all charges and was sentenced to four life terms with no possibility of release.
He subsequently pitched a book to a New York publisher, who turned it down.
Kaczynski's family accepted a reward, given to charity, for outing him.
