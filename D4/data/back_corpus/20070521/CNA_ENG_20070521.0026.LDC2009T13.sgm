An executive of the Travel Agents' Association (TAA) of the
Republic of China called Monday for new Premier Chang Chun-hsiung
to help Taiwan's tourism sector expand its sources of foreign
tourists by substantiating a long-touted government plan for
doubling the number of tourist arrivals.
</P>
<P>
TAA Secretary-General Roget Hsu made the appeal during an
interview with reporters on the sidelines of a world tourism
conference  being held in Taipei under the auspices  of the
Cabinet-level Overseas Compatriot Affairs Commission.
</P>
<P>
After the government launched its plan to double the number of
tourist arrivals in September 2002, the number of foreign tourist
arrivals reached only a little over 3.37 million last year, far
lower than the targeted number of 5 million, Hsu said.

<P>
For his part, Lee Shao-pin, secretary-general of the Hotel
Association of the Republic of China, said there are plenty of
emerging tourism products worthy of promotion to attract foreign
tourists to Taiwan, such as medical tourism, learning Chinese
tourism and long-stay tourism targeting retired Japanese.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics released by the Council for Economic
Planning and Development, the output value of Taiwan's tourist
service sector accounted for an average 2 percent of the nation's
gross domestic product during the 2002-2005 period, lower than
the global tourism's 3.6 percent as a ratio of the world's GDP.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, tallies compiled by the Central Bank of China indicate
that Taiwan's travel-related revenues hit around US$5.1 billion
in 2006, while travel-related expenditures amounted to around
US$8.75 billion, leaving a deficit of US$3.65 billion, which
shows there is ample room for growth in the domestic tourism
market.
