A Legislative Yuan committee passed the first reading of a major
provision in a bill Monday seeking to amend the Physically and
Mentally Disabled Citizens Protection Act and increase employment
opportunities for the disabled.
</P>
<P>
According to an estimate by the Sanitation, Environment and
Social Welfare Committee, the proposed amendment would provide a
further 4,800 jobs for the disabled.
</P>
<P>
The Physically and Mentally Disabled Citizens Protection Act, as
it stands, has been amended seven times since it was first
enacted in 1980.
</P>
<P>
Article 31 of the act stipulates that any government agency,
public school, or state-run business institution with 50 or more
employees must reserve 2 percent of the jobs for disabled workers
and that any private school, organization, or private business
firm with 100 or more employees must reserve at least 1 percent
of the jobs for disabled workers.
</P>
<P>
The proposed amendment would lower the threshold for government
agencies, schools and state-owned enterprises that must hire
disabled workers from a workforce of 50 people to 34, while the
percentage of disabled workers to be employed would be raised
from 2 percent to 3 percent.
</P>
<P>
The amendment would also lower the threshold for private schools,
organizations and business firms that must hire disabled workers
from 100 employees to 67, while requiring that the number of
disabled workers to be hired should not be lower than 1 percent
of the workforce and at least one person.
