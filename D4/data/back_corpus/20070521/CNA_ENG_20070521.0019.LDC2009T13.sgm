GROWTH OF TAIWAN EXPORTS TO CHINA STALLED: THINK TANK
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  May 21 (CNA) 05/21/07  17:52:18 (By Lilian Wu)

<P>
Growth of Taiwan exports to China and Hong Kong has stalled after
their ratio reached nearly 40 percent of the country's overall
exports, a local think tank said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Lien Wen-jung, an associate researcher of the Chung-Hwa
Institution for Economic Research, made the analysis of the
changes of Taiwan's exports to China in recent years.
</P>
<P>
He also predicted that the next target for Taiwan exports will be
Southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
Lien noted that Taiwan's exports have converged in China and Hong
Kong over the past 15 years. In 1990, Taiwan's exports to China
and Hong Kong accounted for only 12.7 percent of its total
exports in terms of U.S. dollars, but the ratio surged to 24.4
percent in 2000. Since then, the ratio has accelerated to reach
39.8 percent in 2006, averaging an increase of 1.7 percentage
points every year.
</P>
<P>
The ratios of Taiwan's exports to China and Hong Kong between
2003 and 2006 were 35.7 percent, 38.0 percent, 39.1 percent and
39.8 percent, respectively, Lien said.
</P>
<P>
The growth slowed in 2005 and 2006 and slipped to 38.9 percent in
the first quarter of 2007, showing that the structure of the
export regions have come to a time for change, according to Lien.
</P>
<P>
It is generally believed that Taiwan's exports have focused on
China because of a lot of Taiwan businessmen have gone there,
resulting  in their  increased imports  of raw materials  or
semi-finished products from Taiwan for processing in China.
</P>
<P>
But he said Taiwan's exports to China and Hong Kong have reached
an apex and that the likelihood of the growth faster than that of
the overall export growth is now decreased.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan products will face steeper competition in China and the
prospects of Taiwan's exports there are worrisome.
</P>
<P>
Under the circumstances, Lien predicted, Southeast Asia is the
next target where Taiwan can register robust export growth,
noting that this is a region of dynamic economies and is now
engaging in free trade agreement talks.
