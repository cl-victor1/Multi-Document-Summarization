A van plunged down a steep ravine in Nantou County's mountainous
region in central Taiwan amid a heavy downpour Sunday, leaving
four people dead and injuring five others, police said.

The van tumbled down the scenic Taichi Ravine in Nantou County
from a narrow, winding mountain road, Nantou police authorities
said in a press statement.

According to the police statement, all of the injured passengers
have been sent to Hsiuchuan Hospital in neighboring Changhua
County for emergency medical treatment. The bodies of the four
people who died at the scene have also been recovered and sent to

The van was driven by a grocery shop-owner-turned-driver when the
accident occurred. The eight passengers were from a family in
Taipei County's Hsinchuang City, police said.

It was the second major traffic accident since the Tienti scenic
area in the Taichi Ravine opened to tourists. In late March, a
traffic mishap happened at the same area along the county's No.
