A delegation of reverends organized by the Christian charity
organization World Vision Taiwan (WVT) left for Uganda Sunday for
a visit aimed at gaining a better understand of the east African
country which has been seriously affected by the problems of
hunger and AIDS, a WVT spokesman said Monday.

The delegation of reverends from various Christian denominations,
led by WVT President Tu Ming-han, will learn about developments
of several projects that have been carried out by the WVT in
northern Uganda since June 2005, including AIDS prevention and
landmine prevention, as well as planned projects to be carried
out soon, such as water resource and public health projects.

The delegation will also visit churches and donation recipients
in Uganda as well as help deliver food and provide other
services.

According to the spokesman, the visit to Uganda is part of the
international humanitarian campaign called "30 hour famine" which
the WVT has participated in for the last 18 years. The campaign
not only helps locals and foreigners in need, it also educates
young Taiwanese and nurtures their compassion, the spokesman
said.

E-Television, has joined the delegation at the invitation of the
WVT to cover the visit that is slated to conclude May 26.

those in need in Uganda through her reports.

The WVT will hold concerts June 8, 15, and 16 in Taipei,
Taichung, and Kaohsiung, respectively, to raise funds for its "30
hour famine" campaign. People who donate NT$300 will get a ticket
for one of the concerts, and all the donated money will be used
in domestic and international famine relief projects, the
spokesman said.
