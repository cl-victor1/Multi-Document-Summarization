TAIPEI FINES MEMORIAL HALL ADMINISTRATION AGAIN
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Taipei,  May 21 (CNA) 05/21/07  17:32:46 (By Elizabeth Hsu)
</P>
<P>
The Taipei city government handed the "Chiang Kai-shek Memorial
Hall" Administration another fine Monday, one day after fining it
for violating the law concerning protection of the country's
cultural assets.
</P>
<P>
Taipei City Director of Cultural Affairs Lee Yung-ping announced
the fine at a press conference she held with Yeh Ying-yuan, chief
of the city's Law and Regulation Commission, after the
administration of the memorial hall, which has been renamed as
the "National Taiwan Democracy Memorial Hall, " failed to remove
two gigantic banners on the hall's outer walls as well as a
canvas covering the name plate of the monument -- a
provisionally-designated heritage site.
</P>
<P>
As the banners block the view of part of the heritage site, they
are in violation of provisions of the Cultural Assets
Preservation Law, Lee said, warning the memorial's
administration, which is under the jurisdiction of the Ministry
of Education (MOE), that fines will continue to be handed out if
it keeps ignoring the city government's ruling.
</P>
<P>
The MOE is obliged to follow regulations of the local government
in terms of changes to a historic site or practices that block
visitors from seeing or entering a historic monument, according
to the city government.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the fine of NT$200,000 (US$5,990) , the City
Department of Cultural Affairs also issued an order for the
memorial hall administration to tear down a scaffold installed in
front of the hall's front door for a "claimed restoration
project, " Lee added.
</P>
<P>
The scaffold, which blocks the renamed hall's original plaque
from view, was installed prior to a new plaque-unveiling ceremony
for the monument Saturday. On that day, the hall's main gate was
also closed for the same reason of being under repair.
</P>
<P>
President Chen Shui-bian revealed Sunday during his visit to the
southern port city of Kaohsiung that the main gate will remain
locked so that people will not see the huge bronze statute of
Chiang whom he branded as a dictator.
</P>
<P>
Chen also mentioned that the guards at the memorial hall, who
perform a change of guard ceremony every two hours in
commemoration of the late president, will also be removed.
</P>
<P>
Lee asked at Monday's press conference whether any workers have
been seen working on the scaffold on the so-called "restoration
project" over the last three days.
</P>
<P>
Asked when the city government will move to tear down the
installation to uphold the law, Lee said no timetable has been
set. She reiterated that it is her department's duty to deal with
and prevent unlawful practices, adding that the department could
be guilty of dereliction of duty if it fails to act on the issue.
</P>
<P>
In response, Vice Education Minister Chou Tsan-der said he sees
nothing wrong with the hanging of the banners and that the
ministry will ask the Council  for Cultural  Affairs,  which
oversees implementation of the Cultural Assets Preservation Law,
to explain whether the city government's punitive fine is legal
or justified.
