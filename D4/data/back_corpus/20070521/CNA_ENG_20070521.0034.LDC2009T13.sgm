Buyers of a newly marketed 30-liter flagon of Kaoliang -- the
fiery liquor distilled from sorghum -- will get three years of
free storage in military tunnels bored into a mountain that have
been turned into cellars, the county-run Kinmen Kaoliang Liquor
Inc. announced Monday.
</P>
<P>
Kinmen County Magistrate Lee Chu-feng and Li June-wen, chairman
of the distilling company, told a press conference that the first
batch of kaoliang in 2,000 pottery flagons, priced at NT$21,000
(US$628) each, will be sold only to Kinmen residents aged 20 and
over, and that each buyer can purchase only one flagon.
</P>
<P>
They said that if the public response on the outlying island is
overwhelming, the company might extend the sales and free storage
services to consumers in Taiwan proper in the future.
</P>
<P>
Lee pointed out that the longer kaoliang is stored in a cellar,
the more fragrant and valuable it becomes. He added that buying a
flagon of kaoliang could be a better investment than buying
stocks.
</P>
<P>
Wang Yi-min, president of Kinmen Kaoliang Liquor Inc., said that
after three years of storage, the 30-liter package will be ideal
for use for such occasions as wedding banquets, birthday parties
or other celebrations.
</P>
<P>
He said there is more than enough space for the free storage
service because the company can use three military tunnels on the
island, and that some sections of the tunnels can be sealed for
kaoliang storage from 10 years up to 100 years.
