More than 27 percent of elementary and junior middle school
pupils in Taiwan have experienced physical punishment in school
in the first half of this year, according to the results of a
survey released Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The Humanistic Education Foundation conducted the survey between
mid-April and the end of May among 1,817 students from 302
elementary schools and 62 students from 161 junior middle schools
around Taiwan. The survey has a margin of error of plus or minus
two percentage points at a 95 percent level of confidence.
</P>
<P>
Executives of the foundation deplored the widespread use of
physical punishment in schools despite the fact that the
Education Basic Law was amended near the end of 2006 to ban any
form of corporal punishment in school.
</P>
<P>
The survey shows that 27.3 percent of the respondents said they
were punished with blows to the body, such as flogging, spanking,
slapping of the face, pinching or jabbing.
</P>
<P>
Some teachers ordered other pupils to hit their classmates for
their misbehaviour or asked pupils being punished to slap each
other's face.
</P>
<P>
Although the 27.3 percent represented a substantial drop from the
51 percent physical punishment rate for 2005, foundation
officials indicated that they take no satisfaction in the figure.
</P>
<P>
In addition to physical punishment, 35 percent of the pupils said
they were subjected to a mild form of punishment -- standing in a
corner for 10 minutes or longer. Another 15 percent said they
were deprived of food and water or not allowed to go to the
restroom, while 12.3 percent said they were ordered to do squat
jumps or pushups as punishment.
</P>
<P>
The survey also found that Taichung County has the highest
physical punishment rate at 69.1 percent, while Taipei City's
rate of 36.7 percent is the lowest among all cities and counties
in Taiwan.
