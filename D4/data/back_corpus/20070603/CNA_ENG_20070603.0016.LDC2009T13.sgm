Taipei,  June 3 (CNA) 06/03/07  18:50:40 (By Deborah Kuo)

<P>
The number of drug abusers in the country has substantially
declined over the past one year following the launch of a new
anti-narcotics program in June 2006, Justice Minister Shih Mao-
lin said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Eleven months after its implementation, the program -- focusing
on reducing demand for illicit narcotics, rather than supply --
has helped cut the number of drug abusers put under observation
in substance abuse prevention centers by 2,699, or 22.6 percent,
Shih said in a speech at the opening of the 2007 National Drug
Control Conference.
</P>
<P>
The program has also witnessed a decline in the number of drug
abusers placed in substance abuse treatment programs at the
centers by 355, or 12 percent, Shih added.
</P>
<P>
He said that the administration declared war on illicit drugs in
1993 but that it has only had limited success in its campaign.
</P>
<P>
The Executive  Yuan Drug Control and Prevention  Committee
submitted a proposal last June to allow the government to adopt a
new strategy to control and prevent illicit narcotics, and the
sharp decline in the number of drug abusers over the past 11
months has proved that the strategy works, Shih noted.
</P>
<P>
Also held on the sidelines  of the National Drug Control
Conference at the Grand Hotel in Taipei was an international drug
control  symposium  in which officials and narcotics  control
specialists from Thailand, Vietnam, Australia, the United States
and Taiwan participated.
</P>
<P>
The foreign participants included Anselmo S. Avenido Jr., head of
the Dangerous Drugs Board of the Philippines, and John Herron,
chairman of the Australian National Council on Drugs.
</P>
<P>
The National Drug Control Conference was jointly sponsored by the
Ministry of Justice, the Ministry of Education and the Department
of Health.
