The pro-independence Taiwan Society launched a new organization
Saturday to promote Taiwan-centric consciousness among young
people.
</P>
<P>
The new organization, named Taiwan Youth Society, will focus on
recruiting people aged between 18 and 35 as its members, Taiwan
Society President Wu Shu- ming said.
</P>
<P>
According to Wu, the Taiwan Society comprises more than 100 like-
minded social groups,  with glorifying Taiwan culture and
deepening Taiwan identity as its main purposes. These lofty
goals, however, cannot be materialized without the participation
of young people, he added.
</P>
<P>
"Therefore, we decided to form the Taiwan Youth Society to arouse
youth passion and love for Taiwan identity, " Wu said at the new
group's inaugural ceremony.
</P>
<P>
Wu said he keenly hopes that the new society can succeed in
attracting young people to join its ranks as Taiwan badly needs a
new generation of leaders who are broad-minded, forward-looking
and full of fresh ideas and new visions to help break diplomatic
isolation imposed by China.
</P>
<P>
Hsu Shun-pin, president of the Taiwan Youth Society, said the new
society will help young people better understand Taiwan while
promoting Taiwan identity through cultural, arts,  musical and
historical studies.
</P>
<P>
Many young politicians, including National Youth Commission
Chairwoman Cheng Li- chun, Legislator Julian Kuo of the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) and Lee Wen-ying, a DPP Taipei
city councilor, attended the inaugural ceremony to throw their
weight behind the new society.
