The Taiwan High Speed Rail Corp. (THSRC) welcomed its 5 millionth
passenger Sunday, five months after it launched its passenger
service between Taipei and Kaohsiung, the two largest cities in
Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
A 70-year-old passenger, identified as Chen Feng-hsiung, walked
out of Panchiao Station a happy man after receiving his prizes --
a model high speed train and 10 business-class tickets valid for
one year -- at a ceremony from Chia Hsian- teh, a deputy manager
of the THSRC in charge of public relations.
</P>
<P>
Chen was traveling with his family and a group of 40 friends from
his neighborhood in Changhua in central Taiwan. He said that he
had booked the tickets for himself and his family at the end of
May for a one-day sightseeing trip from Wujih in Taichung County
to Panchiao and that he was surprised to be informed on the train
that he was the 5 millionth passenger.
</P>
<P>
Chen said he had already ridden a high speed train six times and
felt quite comfortable with the services, adding that he will use
the 10 open-end tickets for more sight-seeing trips with his
family.
</P>
<P>
The THSRC, which began its passenger service Jan. 5 this year,
has twice increased the number of trains each day to enhance its
services. On March 31, it increased the number of trains going in
each direction from 19 to 25 per day. On June 1, the company
again increased the number of trains in both directions from 25
to 31 daily.
</P>
<P>
THSRC executives said they estimate that the total number of high
speed train passengers transported since Jan. 5 will surpass the
10 million mark in September.
