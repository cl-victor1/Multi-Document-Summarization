Taipei, Aug. 26 (CNA) (By Huang Kwang-chun)
</P>
<P>
Various hospitals in Taiwan will coordinate their efforts from
September to prevent and control severe acute respiratory syndrome
(SARS) should the disease make a reappearance on the island, the head
of the Center for Disease Control (CDC) under the Cabinet-level
Department of Health (DOH) said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Su I-jen said that the CDC has laid out a plan for establishing a SARS
prevention network around the nation with 19 hospitals designated for
exclusively treating patients with the flu-like atypical pneumonia.
</P>
<P>
The hospitals will take on their SARS-fighting posture if the
potentially deadly disease is detected again in Taiwan, Su noted.
</P>
<P>
Also, he added, health authorities will start a nationwide anti-flu
vaccination program Sept. 15 for senior citizens aged over 65 to
avoiding possible mistakes in diagnosing potential SARS patients.
</P>
<P>
The disease, which gripped mainland China, Hong Kong, Vietnam,
Singapore, Canada and Taiwan between March and June this year, claimed
more than 800 lives around the world, 84 in Taiwan. Health experts are
concerned about a SARS relapse this winter.
