TAIWAN PAYS CLOSE ATTENTION TO HOLY SEE'S BEIJING GESTURE

Taipei,  Jan.  21 (CNA) 01/21/07  15:25:30 (By Deborah Kuo)
</P>
<P>
Taiwan will pay close attention to a Vatican statement Saturday
calling for a "respectful and constructive dialogue" with Beijing
to pave the way toward the "normalization of relations" in the
future, Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesman Wang Chien-yeh said
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Wang said the Foreign Ministry has noticed that the main point of
the statement that the Holy See issued following  a two-day
closed-door review of the Vatican's China policy was religious
affairs,  or more precisely,  the issue of China's  religious
liberalization.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan is paying close attention to the statement, but is
confident that its bilateral relations with the Vatican are as
strong as before and there are no signs that the relationship is
going to change anytime soon, Wang added.
</P>
<P>
In the statement, the Holy See said it wished to "overcome
misunderstandings of the past" with Beijing, which does not allow
Chinese Catholics to recognize papal authority.
</P>
<P>
It said participants expressed the desire to normalize relations
at "different levels" in order to benefit the Church and work
together for the good of the Chinese people and for peace in the
world.
</P>
<P>
Wang said it is widely understood that it is difficult for the
Vatican and China to normalize their bilateral ties before
China's religious liberalization is fully achieved.
