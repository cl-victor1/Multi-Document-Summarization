TAIWAN BID TO JOIN WHO UNCHANGED: MOFA
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  Jan.  21 (CNA) 01/21/07  16:10:28 (By Deborah Kuo)

Taiwan's bid to join the World Health Organization (WHO) remains
unaltered, although the entry strategy has adopted a more
outside-the-box approach, Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesman
Wang Chien-yeh said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Wang said Taiwan's goal of securing an observer status at the
World Health Assembly (WHA), the WHO's top decision-making body,
has not and will not change, but the MOFA has shifted to a more
pragmatic and realistic strategy.
</P>
<P>
Wang confirmed as true a Liberty Times report Saturday that
Taiwan has not submitted an appeal to the WHA this year for
observer status to be discussed at the WHA Executive Board (EB)
session, which is set to be held in Geneva, Switzerland Monday.
</P>
<P>
Wang said while Taiwan has not submitted its observer status
appeal with the WHA EB, this does not mean that the Foreign
Ministry is paying less attention or applying itself less
strenuously to this issue.
</P>
<P>
He argued that the Foreign Ministry is getting its priorities
straight and concentrating its resources on a "battlefield" more
important than the WHA EB.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan has little chance to win sufficient support at the WHA EB,
which has 34 member countries, of which only El Salvador
maintains formal diplomatic relations with Taiwan, he added.
</P>
<P>
Wang stressed that the Foreign Ministry has tried its utmost to
enable Taiwan to secure observer status at the WHA and continues
to heed the opinions and suggestions offered by other sectors of
the country to strengthen the WHA accession bid, but this remains
a daunting, uphill battle given China's persistent obstruction.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan has sought to join the WHA as an observer since 1997, but
because of China's obstruction, Taiwan has seen little progress
in its bid. Last year at the WHA gathering, Taiwan's hopes of
joining the organization were dashed for the 10th consecutive
year when the WHA General Committee decided not to include
Taiwan's bid on the assembly's agenda.
