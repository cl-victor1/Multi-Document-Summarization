KMT, PFP TO SIGN PACT ON NOMINATING LEGISLATIVE CANDIDATES
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  Jan.  21  (CNA) 01/21/07  16:13:07 (By Han Nai-kuo)
</P>
<P>
The leaders of Taiwan's two largest opposition parties -- the
Kuomintang (KMT) and the People First Party (PFP) -- will sign an
agreement Monday to provide a platform for mutual cooperation in
fielding candidates in the year-end legislative election.
</P>
<P>
The signing of the pact will take place during a satellite video
conference between KMT Chairman Ma Ying-jeou and his PFP
counterpart, James Soong, who is currently in the United States.
</P>
<P>
Ma will ink the agreement at the KMT's office in Taipei, with KMT
Secretary- General  Wu Den-yih  and  PFP Secretary-General  Chin
Chin-sheng and other invited guests as witnesses.
</P>
<P>
Wu,  a KMT legislator  who assumed  his new post as KMT
secretary-general a week ago, told reporters that the alliance
will allow the KMT and PFP to jointly name the most promising
candidates for the next legislative election.
</P>
<P>
On whether the two parties will use negotiation or primary
elections in selecting candidates, Wu said party workers will try
to persuade candidates whose approval ratings in polls lag far
behind to yield to those candidates who have greater support, and
that only when two or more candidates are running neck and neck
in the same electoral zone, will the KMT recommend using primary
elections to determine a single nominee.
</P>
<P>
The legislative election at the end of this year will use a
"single-member constituency, two-vote system, " with the number
of legislators slashed from 225 to 113 and their term extended
from three years to four.
</P>
<P>
Many incumbent legislators from both the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party and the opposition parties may lose their
seats, but the new system will be decidedly less favorable to
candidates of smaller political parties, including the PFP.
</P>
<P>
The PFP was founded by James Soong in 2000 after he -- a member
of the KMT at the time -- failed in his run as an independent in
the presidential election that year. Like the KMT, the PFP
opposes Taiwan independence and favors Taiwan's eventual
reunification with China.
</P>
<P>
The KMT and PFP have maintained a close working relationship, and
together hold a slim majority in the 219-seat legislature. The
relationship is sometimes tense, especially in election years,
because they have to compete for support from the same voters.
</P>
<P>
In the past year, the PFP has been sliding toward marginalization
after 12 of its 34 legislators switched allegiance to the KMT,
making the KMT the largest party in the legislature with 90
seats.
