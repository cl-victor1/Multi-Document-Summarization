U.S.-KOREA FREE TRADE PACT TO HAVE ADVERSE IMPACT ON TAIWAN:
MINISTER

Taipei,  April  1 (CNA) 04/01/07  16:22:04 (By Deborah Kuo)

The imminent signing of a free trade agreement between the United
States and South Korea will definitely have an adverse impact on
Taiwan, which has been a major rival to South Korea in terms of
industrial production and export trade, Minister of Economic
Affairs Chen Ruey-long said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
It is certain that the U.S.-South Korea free trade pact --
expected to be signed shortly as bilateral talks are slated to
wrap up by Monday -- will have an effect on Taiwan, although how
much and to what extent remain to be seen, Chen said.
</P>
<P>
It is believed that the U.S.-South Korea agreement will have
little impact on Taiwan's agriculture sector, though South Korea
may increase its imports of U.S. agricultural products under the
stipulations of the agreement, which might have the side effect
of benefiting Taiwan in terms of the island's imports, Chen
analyzed.

<P>
The U.S.-Korea FTA will also have minor impact on Taiwan's
information technology (IT) industry since the export of most IT
products is duty-free under international practices, Chen said.
</P>
<P>
As to other industrial sectors, Chen said, the Economics Ministry
will pay close attention to the contents of the U.S.-Korea FTA to
see how it will affect related sectors in Taiwan's economy.
</P>
<P>
He added that the Economics Ministry is watching closely to
determine whether the U.S.-Korea FTA will prompt more U.S.
companies to invest in South Korea or bring about closer
cooperation in business and trade sectors between the two
countries.
