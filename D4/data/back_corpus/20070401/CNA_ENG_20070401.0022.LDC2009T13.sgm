PRESIDENT IDENTIFIES MAJOR OBSTACLES TO TAIWAN'S NATIONAL GOAL
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  April 1 (CNA) 04/01/07  23:42:01 (By Sofia Wu)

President Chen Shui-bian said Sunday that the previous "party-
state"  system, cultism and greater China consciousness have been
major stumbling blocks to Taiwan's ultimate goal of becoming a
normal and complete modern country.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a ceremony marking the seventh anniversary of
Ketagalan Institute, Chen said those stumbling blocks have also
threatened the goal of defending Taiwan's democratic status quo
and peace in the Taiwan Strait.
</P>
<P>
Under the party-center governing system which characterized the
previous Kuomintang (KMT) rule, Chen said the interests of the
ruling party took precedence over the national interests. As a
result, the military served the ruling party's interests and the
public money and properties were often used for partisan
interests.
</P>
<P>
Noting that such a system violates the democratic principles that
require fair competition among different political parties and
separation of the state and the ruling party, Chen said his
administration opposes such a system and is thus determined to
push the KMT to return its ill-gotten party assets to the
national coffers.
</P>
<P>
Chen further said that his ruling Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) opposes cultism. Against this backdrop, he said, the DPP
administration feels compelled to shed light on the late
President Chiang Kai-shek's suppression of human rights and hold
him responsible for the infamous 228 Incident of 1947 in which
many innocent people were killed brutally.
</P>
<P>
In order to safeguard Taiwan's distinct identity and its hard-won
democratic system, Chen said, his administration must push for
the birth of a new constitution that fits Taiwan's situation and
must get rid of reference to China from state-own companies and
various institutions.
</P>
<P>
"All these efforts are aimed at preserving Taiwan's democratic
status quo and its separate national identity as well as
safeguard peace in the Taiwan Strait, " Chen said, adding that
none of these actions have anything to do with fanning ethnic
rifts and conflicts.
