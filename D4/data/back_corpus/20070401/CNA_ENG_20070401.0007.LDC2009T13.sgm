Taipei,  April 1 (CNA) 04/01/07  15:50:28 (By Deborah Kuo)

Former main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Ma Ying-jeou
said Sunday that he will invite Legislature Speaker Wang Jin-pyng
to be his running mate and jointly challenge the 2008
presidential election.
</P>
<P>
Ma, who is widely viewed as the KMT's best bet in the 2008 race,
is poised to register candidacy for the KMT presidential primary.
He said Sunday he would like to have Wang as his running mate
even if Wang does not register for the KMT primary. Registraton
for the KMT primary will begin April 3.
</P>
<P>
Wang was formerly a KMT vice chairman.
</P>
<P>
Ma made the remarks while taking the Taiwan High Speed Railway
from Taipei to the southern city of Tainan.
</P>
<P>
Responding to a reporter's inquiry as to whether Ma was worried
that Wang, who has recently expressed his explicit intention to
run in the 2008 presidency, may announce his candidacy as an
independent, Ma said he reckons Wang "will probably not do this."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Ma, who resigned as the KMT chairman Feb. 13 upon
being charged over allegedly lining his pockets during his time
as Taipei mayor with NT$11 million (US$332,684) from a special
allowance fund set aside for the mayor's discretionary use, would
not speculate on the possible outcome of a court hearing April 3
when the Taipei District Court addresses his indictment.
