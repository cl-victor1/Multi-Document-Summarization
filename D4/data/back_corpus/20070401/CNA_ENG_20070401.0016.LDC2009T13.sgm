Taipei,  April 1 (CNA) 04/01/07  19:44:56 (By Han Nai-kuo)

A former vice chairman of the opposition Kuomintang (KMT) said
Sunday that if he is elected KMT chairman, he will consider
retirement after the 2008 presidential election no matter whether
the KMT ticket wins or loses the election.
</P>
<P>
Speaking in a TV debate with another contender for the KMT
chairmanship, Wu Poh- hsiung said that if elected KMT chairman,
he would be willing to quit the post to accept responsibility if
the party loses the presidential election in 2008.
</P>
<P>
"Even if the party wins the election, I would consider retiring,
because after completing my task, I would have no regrets in
doing so," he said.
</P>
<P>
Wu said he found it "traumatic" to see former KMT Chairman Ma
Ying-jeou, whom he described as a man noted for his "integrity
and clean image" in Taiwan's political circle, indicted on
charges of embezzling special funds designated for use at his
discretion while he served as Taipei mayor.
</P>
<P>
Wu added that after careful consideration, he decided that the
best way to help the KMT win the 2008 presidential election would
be for him to become the next KMT chairman.
</P>
<P>
"If I evade such a responsibility, I would regret it for the rest
of my life," he said, adding that if, by serving as KMT chairman,
he can help the party return to power, he will "die a happy man."
</P>
<P>
At the TV debate held by TVBS, Legislator Hung Hsiu-chu, another
contender for the KMT chairmanship, said that, if elected the
next KMT chairwoman, she would support the KMT presidential
candidate with the greatest chances of defeating the opponent
from the ruling Democratic Progressive Party in the 2008
election.
</P>
<P>
She acknowledged that she will back Ma as the KMT presidential
nominee because he is currently seen as having the greatest
chance of winning the election.
</P>
<P>
The KMT chairmanship  became vacant after Ma resigned  in mid-
February following his indictment on charges of corruption by a
public prosecutor.
</P>
<P>
Wu served as acting chairman for one month in his capacity as the
most senior vice chairman among the KMT's four deputies before
resigning his post on March 14. Vice Chairman Chiang Ping-kun is
now the acting KMT chairman.
