TAIWAN HOPES JAPAN WILL RECIPROCATE BY OPENING DOOR TO TAIWAN
PORK

Taiwan's animal husbandry industry executives expressed hopes
Sunday that Japan will reciprocate by opening its door to Taiwan
pork exports since Japan has been exporting many of its
agricultural products in large quantities to Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Huang Chin-jung, chairman of the non-profit National Animal
Industry Foundation, who recently led a Taiwan delegation to
visit agricultural operations on Japan's northern island of
Hokkaido, said governments of various levels are striving to root
out foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) from Taiwan's farms in the hope
that the disease will be eradicated once and for all within a
couple of years, meaning that Taiwanese-produced pork will again
be allowed access to Japan's meat markets.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan's pork exports have been barred from Japan since 1997
after an outbreak of FMD on animal farms around the island that
same year.

<P>
Under concerted government efforts, some areas, including the
offshore county of Penghu, have successfully eradicated FMD
through organic means instead of using vaccination, Huang said,
adding that all animal farms in Taiwan are expected to stop
vaccinating their cultured livestock by August 2008 -- at the
same time also paving the way for Taiwan to become an FMD-free
country, Huang noted.

<P>
During last week's trip to Hokkaido, Huang said, members of the
Taiwan delegation of animal farm operators met with their
Japanese counterparts and were told that the farmers associations
from Hokkaido have enjoyed brisk businesses exporting their
produce and output to Taiwan, including Chinese yams, dairy
products, grape wine and other agricultural products.
