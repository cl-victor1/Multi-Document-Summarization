ACADEMICS PONDER ETHICAL ISSUE OF BIOBANK PLANS
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,   April  1  (CNA) 04/01/07  18:54:33 (By Deborah Kuo)

<P>
A group of academics and medical professionals gathered Sunday to
ponder ethical issues and related controversies that might arise
from the establishment of a national biobank.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a colloquium organized by the Foundation of Medical
Professionals Alliance in Taiwan, Tsai Tu-chien, director of
Taipei Medical University's Institute of Medical Humanities, said
more legal professionals are needed to pitch in to build a legal
framework concerning human genome studies and possible
establishment of a biobank in Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Building a legal framework -- aimed at supervising the biobank in
terms of ethical and related issues -- will at least help
alleviate doubts harbored by aboriginal people and help win their
trust regarding the planned biobank, Tsai added.
</P>
<P>
An Academia Sinica plan to construct a "Taiwanese Biobank" --
based on a pool of native genes, and with the aims of running
massive, cross-generation studies to understand the
interconnections between Taiwanese and the local environment, and
enhancing the efficacy of disease prevention, diagnosis and
treatment -- was shelved last year after human rights groups
intervened to voice aboriginal people's doubts and anger
regarding the plan.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile,  Lee  Jui-chuan,  director  of National  Central
University's Institute of Philosophy, said the indigenous people
as well as the general public are hesitant to embrace the plan
due to fears that their genes and genetic data might be abused,
resulting in their privacy being infringed or their families
stigmatized.
</P>
<P>
Lee suggested that together with the establishment of the
"Taiwanese Biobank, " there should be a feedback mechanism to
allow genetic donors to be reasonably rewarded if any commercial
dividends result from the establishment of the biobank.
</P>
<P>
Also speaking at the colloquium, Lee Tsung-hsi, director of
National Dong Hwa University's Institute for Financial and
Economic Law Studies, said current laws and statutes in this
country are insufficient to govern the establishment and
operations of a human genome center.
</P>
<P>
He said related laws and statutes should be beefed up since
research on the human genome involves the protection of privacy
of individuals and their families, and well as patent rights,
rewards, and business interests.
