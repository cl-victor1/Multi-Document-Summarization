RE-NAMING OF CKS MEMORIAL HALL 'ILLEGAL': TAIPEI MAYOR
</HEADLINE>

Taipei, May 19 (CNA) 05/19/07  19:44:00 (By Lilian Wu)

Taipei Mayor Hau Lung-bin said Saturday that the name-change of
the National Chiang Kai-shek Memorial Hall is "illegal" and a
"deception" that the city "seriously condemns."
</P>
<P>
Hau made the remarks in a news conference shortly after President
Chen Shui-bian presided over the plaque-unveiling ceremony for
the hall dedicated to the late president, which has been re-named
National Taiwan Democracy Memorial Hall.
</P>
<P>
Hau criticized  the central  government  for imposing  the name-
change even before legislation of the organic statute of the
National Taiwan Democracy Memorial Hall, adding that the "central
government has broken the law."
</P>
<P>
Hau also said that the central government, by hanging large cloth
banners on the two flanks of the CKS Memorial Hall, also violated
the law by blocking the view of a historic site.
</P>
<P>
Stressing that the city government will "rigorously enforce the
law, " he said that the city government has asked the central
government to remove the banners or the city government will
remove them according to the law.
</P>
<P>
On president Chen's remarks that just as the name of the
Presidential Office, a national historic site, was changed from
Chienshou Hall in celebration  of the late President Chiang's
birthday, the name of the CKS Memorial Hall could also be
changed, Hau said the two cases are different. He noted that the
organization of Chiehshou Hall was not legislated and that the
organic statute of the CKS Memorial Hall was passed by the
Legislative Yuan.
