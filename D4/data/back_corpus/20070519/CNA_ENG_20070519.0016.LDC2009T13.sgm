President Chen Shui-bian presented a citation Saturday to commend
the devotion of the late American philanthropist  Joyce McMillan
to taking care of disadvantaged children in Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
The citation was received by McMillan's family during her funeral
service held at Changhua County's Erhlin Happy Christian Homes,
which was founded by McMillan in 1965.
</P>
<P>
McMillan died April 26 in Erhlin. She was 93 years old.
</P>
<P>
Recapping McMillan's charitable deeds, Chen noted that McMillan
first came to Taiwan in 1960 to engage in volunteer nursing
services after learning that there were many children with
tuberculosis in Taiwan who needed help.
</P>
<P>
While engaging in volunteer nursing services in Changhua County,
McMillan discovered that a large number of children were
suffering from polio, so she decided to stay in Taiwan to set up
the Erhlin Happy Christian Homes to take care of these children,
Chen pointed out.
</P>
<P>
McMillan sold her properties in the United States to finance the
operations of the institution, Chen said, adding that more than
1,000 children received care at the institution over the past
several decades.
</P>
<P>
Because of her selfless devotion, Chen continued, McMillan was
the first American to receive a good Samaritan award in Taiwan
and was a recipient of the Presidential Cultural Awards.
</P>
<P>
Calling McMillan a person who truly loved Taiwan, the president
expressed the hope that McMillan's devotional spirit will expand
from Changhua County to the rest of Taiwan.
