U.S. TO REVIEW 'ONE CHINA' POLICY IF DPP WINS BIG IN 2008: DPP

Taipei,  May 19 (CNA) 05/19/07  18:26:40 (By Lilian Wu)

<P>
If the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) can win the 2008
presidential election by an overwhelming margin, the United
States will be compelled to review its "one China" policy, DPP
Chairman Yu Shyi-kun claimed Saturday.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks while attending a forum on policy suggestions
for the new century sponsored by the Taiwan New Century
Foundation.
</P>
<P>
Yu noted that after the DPP won the presidential election in
2004, many U.S. think tanks raised doubts about America's "one
China" policies. But the DPP didn't "win by a large enough margin
that time, " he said, adding that if the party can win more votes
in 2008, with those identifying with Taiwan throwing their
support behind the DPP presidential candidate, he is confident
that "the United States will review its policy, and consequently
influence Japan, the European Union and other democratic
countries."
</P>
<P>
President Chen Shui-bian won the 2004 presidential election by a
razor-thin margin.
</P>
<P>
Yu said that 2008 will be a crucial year in terms of solving the
problems faced by Taiwan, noting that the country has "been in a
chaotic state" over the past seven years with the opposition
trying to topple the Cabinet and to recall the president. He also
pointed to the large-scale "red-shirt" protest rallies calling
for President Chen to step down last year in the wake of a series
of alleged scandals surrounding the president's family members
and his close aides.
</P>
<P>
Yu said that if the issue of national identity cannot be
resolved, then many other problems that the nation faces will not
be solved.
</P>
<P>
He noted that recent public opinion polls have shown that around
70 percent of the people identify with Taiwan, while only a
little more than 10 percent identify with China.
</P>
<P>
"If the DPP is able to stay in power after 2008, then the issue
of national identity can be solved," he claimed.
</P>
<P>
Yu further said that the party is now promoting a resolution on
turning Taiwan into a "normal country" and that he has invited
Chen Lung-chih, chairman of the foundation, to serve as a member
on a task force that will work on the draft of the resolution,
which will include such issues as drafting a new constitution,
rectifying the nation's official designation, and bidding to join
international organizations under the name of Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
He noted that it is widely believed that there are three options
for Taiwan, with the first being eventual unification with China,
for which he said Taiwan would pay a "hefty price." He added that
most people would not like to see this happen.
</P>
<P>
The second option is maintaining the status quo, for which Yu
said Taiwan would pay a lesser price but which would be like
subjecting oneself to "chronic poisoning."
</P>
<P>
The third option is Taiwan independence, which he said may be "a
crooked and winding road, " adding, however, that "where there is
a will, there is a way."
