A group of pro-independence activists tried to pull down a statue
of the late President Chiang Kai-shek in a park in Chiayi City in
central Taiwan Saturday but were stopped by police.
</P>
<P>
Huang Chao-tang,  chief of the World United Formosans for
Independence, and Chen Ying-hua, ex-chief of the Chiayi chapter
of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party, led a group of their
followers to attempt to pull down with a rope the statue of
Chiang Kai-shek in Chungcheng Park,  which was named after the
late president.
</P>
<P>
They stopped only after police stepped in and impounded their
rope.
</P>
<P>
The incident took place hours after President Chen Shui-bian
delivered a blistering  speech against Chiang,  calling him a
"dictator" and "executioner" in a plaque-unveiling ceremony held
in Taipei City to mark the renaming of the National Chiang Kai-
shek Memorial Hall as the "Taiwan Democracy Memorial Hall."
