NAME CHANGE AIMED AT `EMERGING FROM MARTIAL LAW SHADOW':
PRESIDENT
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  May 19 (CNA) 05/19/07  09:10:54 (By Sofia Wu)
</P>
<P>
President Chen Shui-bian has said that the government's decision
to rename the Chiang Kai-shek (CKS) Memorial Hall as the
"National Taiwan Democracy Memorial Hall" is not a purge and has
nothing to do with sabotaging a protected heritage site.
</P>
<P>
Chen made the remarks in a 3,000-word statement issued late
Friday on the eve of the holding of a grand ceremony at the
memorial in downtown Taipei where a new plaque bearing the new
name of the magnificent monument dedicated to the late President
Chiang Kai-shek will be unveiled and installed.
</P>
<P>
In the article, Chen explained that the redesignation is just a
move to remodel into a "democracy landmark" the most blatant
symbol of the authoritarian rule, single-party system and cult
mechanism that prevailed during Taiwan's infamous martial law era
dominated by the Chiang family and his followers.
</P>
<P>
"By so doing, we hope to enable Taiwan to emerge from the shadow
of the martial law imposed by Chiang that shackled the country
for 38 years until July 15, 1987," Chen said.
</P>
<P>
During those dark days, Chen said Taiwan was incarcerated by the
shackles of the Kuomintang's (KMT's) China-centric consciousness,
cult worship of the Chiang family, the single-party state and the
White Terror period that saw the persecution of Taiwan's elite at
the hands of the KMT's security apparatus.
</P>
<P>
Although the martial law was lifted in 1987, Chen said, the
country has not yet emerged from its authoritarian past because
of its reluctance to honestly face up to that ugly and painful
history. "The situation is like what the Bible describes. While
we have left Egypt, we have yet to reach the promise land -- the
Land of Canaan," he lamented.
</P>
<P>
Against this backdrop, Chen said the government is determined to
have "Chiang -- the culprit of the tragic 228 Incident of 1947
and the dictator who imposed the martial law -- removed from the
altar" by giving the memorial a new name commemorating Taiwan's
democratic metamorphosis.
</P>
<P>
Remodeling the most obvious token of the authoritarian rule and
cult following of the Chiang family is expected to redeem all
those who had fallen victim to political persecution during the
martial law era and thereby enabling local society to go beyond
the shadow of cruel past wrongdoings while marching toward a
promising future of freedom, democracy and social justice, Chen
said.
</P>
<P>
The CKS Memorial Hall was inaugurated April 5, 1980, on the fifth
anniversary of Chiang's death when the KMT was in power and the
Chiang-proclaimed martial law was still in force.
</P>
<P>
In 2006, 37 legislators of the ruling Democratic Progressive
Party (DPP) proposed that the CKS Memorial be moved to Chiang's
temporary mausoleum in Tzuhu in Taoyuan County, and that the
current site be renamed the "Taiwan Democracy Memorial Hall."
</P>
<P>
The DPP-led "pan-green camp" politicians consider the CKS hall
redesignation proposal part of a movement to rectify the names
and symbols to be more in line with the local Taiwanese culture
or Taiwan-centric consciousness, while their KMT-led "pan-blue
alliance" opponents criticize it as "desinicization."
</P>
<P>
Since the Executive Yuan approved the name change proposal
presented by the Ministry of Education (MOE) in mid-April, the
memorial hall redesignation plan has been the focal point of
disputes between the ministry, which oversees the memorial's
management, and the KMT-controlled Taipei city government, which
operates the hall.
</P>
<P>
At one point, Taipei Mayor Hau Lung-bin, son of a retired general
who served under "dictator" Chiang, threatened to have police
arrest anyone who dared to remove the memorial's name plate or
put up a new one at the hall.
</P>
<P>
But the two sides finally reached a compromise Friday, with the
MOE assuring city officials that no damage will be done to the
memorial hall.
</P>
<P>
Mayor Hau said Friday evening that the city government will take
the MOE's "no damage" promise as being made in good faith and
refrain from counteracting the central government concerning the
issue.
</P>
<P>
As the city government has provisionally designated the memorial
as a protected heritage site, Vice Education Minister Chou Tsan-
der said earlier this week that the ministry will see to it that
the installation of the new name plate offends no provisions of
the Cultural Heritage Preservation Law.
</P>
<P>
The memorial shares the grounds of the 240,000-square-meter
Chiang Kai-shek Memorial Park with the National Concert Hall and
the National Theater and is one of Taipei's defining landmarks.
</P>
<P>
President Chen Shui-bian is scheduled to preside over the plaque-
unveiling ceremony at the Gate of Great Piety, one of the
gateways to the memorial hall that border Ai Kuo E. Road.
</P>
<P>
Following the ceremony, a special exhibition, titled "Farewell,
President Chiang! Going Down the Taiwan Road, " will be held at
the museum at the memorial hall's ground level that has
traditionally displayed photos and mementos of Chiang's life.
</P>
<P>
The special exhibition, organized by the 228 Incident Memorial
Foundation, will feature a collection of historical documents and
photos that chronicle Taiwan's transformation from authoritarian
rule to a vibrant democracy.
