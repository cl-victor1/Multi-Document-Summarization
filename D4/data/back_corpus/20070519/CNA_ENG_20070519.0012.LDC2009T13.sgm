PRESIDENT PLEDGES TO CONTINUE EFFORTS TO MAKE TAIWAN 'NORMAL
COUNTRY'
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Taipei,  May 19 (CNA) 05/19/07  14:17:03 (By Y.F. Low)
</P>
<P>
President Chen Shui-bian pledged Friday to continue his efforts
to turn Taiwan into a "normal country, " an objective which he
said will take at least another eight years to achieve.
</P>
<P>
To ensure a Taiwan-centric government will continue to lead the
country toward the goal over the next eight years, Chen said he
will take various measures during the remaining one year of his
term to deepen Taiwan's democratic development, reinforce the
Taiwanese identity,  realize  transitional  justice, enhance
national competitiveness, close the urban-rural development gap,
strengthen the country's industrial foundation  and revitalize
its human resources.
</P>
<P>
Chen made the remarks in a statement marking the 58th anniversary
of the declaration of martial law in Taiwan on May 19, 1949.
</P>
<P>
With martial law lifted only 20 years ago and the first
transition of power between political parties taking place only
seven years ago in the country, Taiwan is still a very young
democracy, Chen said.
</P>
<P>
Over the past seven years, Chen noted, Taiwan has faced problems
such as divisions over national and ethnic identities, vicious
partisan struggle, transitional justice,  and debate over the
country's constitutional system.
</P>
<P>
In addition  to these common  dilemmas  faced by emerging
democracies, Taiwan also needs to deal with the non-stop military
threat and diplomatic suppression from China, Chen pointed out.
</P>
<P>
He said the tests that the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)
government have undergone over the past seven years prove that
"sticking to the Taiwan-centric consciousness" and "realizing
social fairness and justice" are the correct "Taiwan line."
</P>
<P>
"With much hardship, we have obtained the right to be our own
masters, but we are still working hard to learn how to be our own
masters," Chen said.
</P>
<P>
To further deepen Taiwan's democratization in the remainder of
his term, the president said he will push for an amendment to the
Referendum Law and help work out a draft for a new constitution
for review by the Legislative Yuan.
</P>
<P>
On measures to reinforce the Taiwan-centric consciousness, Chen
said the DPP government  will continue  to rename state-owned
enterprises, promote the country's bids to take part in
international organizations, including the World Health
Organization and United Nations, under the name of Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
On steps to realize transitional  justice,  Chen said the
government will push for a referendum to reclaim the "ill-gotten"
assets of the former ruling Kuomintang, declassify more archive
material and work to uncover the truth behind major political
cases during the martial law era.
</P>
<P>
On measures to enhance the country's competitiveness, Chen said
the government will complete a merger of Taichung County and
Taichung City, reorganize the central and local government
systems, and reform the country's taxation system.
</P>
<P>
To close the urban-rural development gap, the government will
review and relax restrictions on farmland use and enact a law to
facilitate the reconstruction of farm villages, Chen said.
</P>
<P>
To strengthen the country's industrial foundation, the government
will work to boost the development of the precision machinery,
electronic communication and biotechnology industries with the
goal of increasing their production values to more than NT$1
trillion per year, he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, to strengthen the country's human resources, the
government will subsidize 150 prominent businesses in the country
to encourage them to each provide a six-month internship to 100
university graduates, he added.
