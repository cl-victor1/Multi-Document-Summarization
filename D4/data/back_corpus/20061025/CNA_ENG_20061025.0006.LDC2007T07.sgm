Taipei,  Oct.  24 (CNA) (By Han Nai-kuo)
</P>
<P>
Taiwan has seen 434 confirmed indigenous dengue fever cases since the
beginning of summer, according to statistics released Tuesday by the
Center for Disease Control (CDC) under the Department of Health.
</P>
<P>
A breakdown of the figure shows that there were 277 reported cases in
Kaohsiung City, 144 cases in Kaohsiung County, nine cases in Pingtung
County, two cases in Tainan County, and one each in Taipei County and
Keelung City.
</P>
<P>
CDC Deputy Director Chou Chih-hao said the increase in the incidence
of dengue fever infections was slowing down, with 40 confirmed cases
last week.
</P>
<P>
He acknowledged that three of Kaohsiung City's districts --
Chiencheng, Sanmin and Nantzu -- are still "hot zones" and that more
efforts are needed by the residents to clean up their environments and
get rid of the mosquitoes that carry the disease.
</P>
<P>
He said it has been certified that the two people in Taipei County and
Keelung City who contracted the disease were infected during visits to
southern Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Chou expressed confidence that the incidence of the disease will be
brought under control as the climate cools in November.
</P>
<P>
Dengue fever is a flu-like viral disease spread by the bite of
infected mosquitoes that breed in abandoned tires, flower pots and
water storage containers close to human dwellings.
</P>
<P>
The disease usually starts suddenly with a high fever, rash, severe
headache, pain behind the eyes, and muscle and joint pain, accompanied
by nausea, vomiting and loss of appetite. It may take a month for a
patient to recover from the disease.
