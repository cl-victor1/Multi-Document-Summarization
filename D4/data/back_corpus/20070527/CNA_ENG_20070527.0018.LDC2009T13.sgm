TAIWAN TO HOST 2009 UNPFII ASIAN PREPARATORY MEETING
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  May 27 (CNA) 05/27/07  18:10:12 (By Deborah Kuo)

Taiwan has been authorized to sponsor an Asian preparatory
meeting in 2009 for the Eighth United Nations Permanent Forum on
Indigenous Issues (UNPFII) to be held in New York in May that
year, an aboriginal source said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Yapasuyongu Poiconu, a Tsou leader of the seven-member Taiwan
aborigine delegation to the sixth UNPFII held in New York May
14-25, said it was decided during the just-concluded U.N.
indigenous affairs forum that the Asian preparatory meeting next
year will be held in Nepal and that for the 2009 forum will be
held in Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Poiconu noted, however, that should the 2008 UNPFII preparatory
meeting not be held in Nepal due to political instability in that
Himalayan country, the 2008 preparatory meeting could possibly be
held in Taiwan.

Speaking at a news conference in Taipei upon the delegation's
return,  Poiconu said that among other things,  the delegates
introduced  Taiwan Indigenous Television (TITV)  --  the first
indigenous  people's  television  channel  in Asia that became
operational in 2005 -- and captured the hearts and minds of the
participants in the forum from around the world.

<P>
Also speaking at the news conference, Awi Mona, a delegate
representing Taiwan's Sdeiq tribe, said a draft bill of the U. N.
indigenous peoples' rights declaration has remained a draft bill
due to political intervention.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, the chairman of the sixth UNPFII vowed during the
conference that he will strongly suggest that the U.N. General
Assembly have the draft bill concerning the rights and interests
of the world's indigenous people passed in the upcoming assembly
to be held in September, Mona said.
</P>
<P>
According to Poiconu, the Taiwan delegation also continued to
push for a proposal calling for a change of reference to
"indigenous peoples" in Chinese at the United Nations, from "Tu
Zhu, " which connotes cultural inferiority, to "Yuan Zhu Min Zu,
" which connotes the original residents of a place and also those
who have rights to the land.
</P>
<P>
The Taiwan delegation to the fifth UNPFII last year for the first
time submitted such a proposal but it seemed to fall on deaf
ears, as nothing was done about it.
