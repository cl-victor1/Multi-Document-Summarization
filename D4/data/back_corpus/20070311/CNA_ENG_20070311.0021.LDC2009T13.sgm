The Kaohsiung city government declared Sunday that Taiping Island
-- the largest island in the Nansha (Spratly) island group -- has
become a conservation area for the endangered green sea turtles
and will enjoy a protected status.
</P>
<P>
The Marine Bureau under the Kaohsiung city government said the
conservation area extends from the center of Taiping Island to
the beach and also covers 12 sea miles from the coast.
</P>
<P>
The Convention of International Trade in Endangered Species of
Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) has placed green sea turtles on its
list of endangered species because humans have ruined many of
their nesting grounds.
</P>
<P>
In December last year, the Coast Guard Administration (CGA) built
an L-shaped pier on Taiping island, triggering concerns that the
construction might affect the local ecology and ruin the natural
habitat of green sea turtles.
</P>
<P>
However, a CGA spokesman explained that the pier was built mainly
to facilitate boats delivering logistic supplies to CGA personnel
stationed on the island and would not deprive the green sea
turtles of their nesting grounds.
</P>
<P>
He said the CGA command on Taiping Island has ordered all
personnel stationed there to do their utmost to conserve the
local ecology.
</P>
<P>
Taiping Island is located southwest of Taiwan in the South China
Sea. Stretching 1,360 meters wide and 350 meters long, the island
has a land area of only 489,600 square meters. Facilities on the
island include a radar station, a meteorological center, a power
plant, a library and an activity center.
</P>
<P>
The Nansha island chain consists of 180 islets and reefs in an
area that stretches 810 km from north to south and 900 km from
east to west. Taiping Island is located in the center of the
island group.
