EPA WORKING TO INVITE AL GORE TO VISIT TAIWAN

Taipei, March 11 (CNA) 03/11/07  18:10:13 (By Deborah Kuo)

An Environmental Protection Administration (EPA) official
confirmed Sunday that the agency has been working to invite
former U.S. President Al Gore to visit Taiwan to help inspire
Taiwan's anti-global warming efforts.
</P>
<P>
Yang Chih-yuan, director of the EPA Department of Air Quality and
Sound Pollution Control, said the EPA has been working through
diplomatic channels to invite Gore for about four months, but
nothing concrete has been discussed thus far.
</P>
<P>
"We'll know whether or not it'll happen in a month at the
earliest," Yang said.
</P>
<P>
Al Gore's movie, "An Inconvenient Truth, " won an Oscar for best
documentary Feb. 25, making him a recognized spokesman for
efforts to curb global warming and for "right causes."
</P>
<P>
Yang noted that the budget is not an issue at all in terms of
inviting Gore, who reportedly asks for US$300,000 for a speech or
a in-person visit.
</P>
<P>
The EPA can afford US$300,000 for an Al Gore visit, Yang said,
adding that he believes that Gore's visit to Taiwan will help the
government promote nationwide efforts to reduce greenhouse gases
from fossil fuel use, and thereby reduce human-caused global
warming.
</P>
<P>
The only issue now is probably the interference of Beijing,
making Gore's Taiwan visit a political issue, rather than cost,
Yang said.
