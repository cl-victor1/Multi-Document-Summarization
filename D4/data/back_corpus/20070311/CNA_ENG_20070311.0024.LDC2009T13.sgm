In addition to divergent prize-winning orchids, this year's
exhibition features orchid art installations as well as various
rare orchids species, the spokesman said.

One of the characteristics of the ongoing show is its focus on
finding creative means to improve interaction between viewers and
exhibits. For example, outside the main entry, there is a display
featuring a wide variety of outdoor color paintings and pig-
shaped sculptures to create a joyful atmosphere marking the Year
of the Pig.

The event, co-sponsored by the Tainan county government and the
Taiwan External Trade Development Council, is also designed to
showcase a wide array of orchid strains from Malaysia, Thailand,
Japan and German.

The spokesman said that the fair has drawn a large number of
orchid buyers from home and abroad, and the county government
expressed hope that it will bring orders breaking the NT$ 1.5
billion mark this year.
