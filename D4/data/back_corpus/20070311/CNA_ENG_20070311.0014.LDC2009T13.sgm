Taichung, March 11 (CNA) 03/11/07  17:52:07 (By Han Nai-kuo)

<P>
Taiwan Sugar Corp. (Taisugar) is seeking assistance from the
Cabinet-level Council of Labor Affairs (CLA) to hire 168
employees for its new hypermarket chain store in Taichung to be
inaugurated in April or May.
</P>
<P>
The CLA's employment service office in central Taiwan has
instructed officials at its Taichung office to interview
applicants at a location next to the city's Jenai Elementary
School.
</P>
<P>
Taisugar's new hypermarket store -- its fifth in Taiwan -- is
located  in Taichung's  Hsitun District, home to the Taichung
Industrial Park.
</P>
<P>
Taisugar joined the battle with domestic and foreign-invested
hypermarket chains and opened its first store in Nantze, home to
the Kaohsiung Export Processing Zone, in 2001. In subsequent
years, it established three other stores in Peikang, Yunlin
County; Pingtung in southern Taiwan; and Jenteh township, Tainan
County.
</P>
<P>
The company's new store in Taichung is expected to make the
competition among the hypermarket chains even more fierce, as the
4 million residents in the greater Taichung area are already
served by the French Carrefour chain, which owns four stores in
the city, and Geant, which has three stores.
</P>
<P>
Locally-owned RT Mart and Save &amp; Safe chains together have
three stores in Taichung.
