Vietnam's Ministry of Finance will send a delegation to Taiwan in
late May to visit the country's major financial institutions to
gain a better understanding of Taiwan's financial development, an
official of Taiwan's Financial Supervisory Commission (FSC) said
Wednesday.

According to the official, Vietnam expressed a willingness to
send officials to visit Taiwan to FSC Vice Chairwoman Chang
Hsiou-lien when she visited Vietnam's State Bank, Ministry of
Finance, and State Security Commission from May 6-10 to exchange
views with Vietnam on strengthening bilateral cooperation in
securities affairs.

Chang, invited by the Taiwan Financial Services Roundtable's
delegation comprised of 28 domestic top managers led by the
organization's chairman, Chien Hung-wen, to visit Vietnam, made
suggestions to Vietnam on problems encountered by Taiwanese
financial firms in that country.

Chang suggested  that Vietnam provide clear timelines  and
transparent approval procedures for opening its financial market
in the future, as the country became the 150th member of the
World Trade Organization in January this year. She also expressed
the hope that Vietnam will make opening its financial market
further a top priority as well take the interests of Taiwan
business people into consideration, the official said.

Taiwan's delegation also held seminars with more than 130
Taiwanese business people for opinion exchanges during its visit
to Vietnam, the official said.
