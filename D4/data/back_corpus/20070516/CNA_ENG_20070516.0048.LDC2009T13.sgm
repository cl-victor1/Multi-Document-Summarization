Armed forces honed counterattack skills and tactics at Wharf No.
2 of Taichung Harbor in central Taiwan Wednesday as part of the
ongoing Han Kuang 23 combined services military exercises.
</P>
<P>
More than 500 army, air force and marine personnel were mobilized
for the combat drill, as well as dozens of aircraft and combat
vehicles, missiles and artillery.
</P>
<P>
The troops performed various combat strategies in response to a
simulated attack by Chinese airborne and special forces troops
attempting to seize the port prior to an invasion.
</P>
<P>
Government units, including the Taichung Harbor Bureau, the city
police and firefighting departments, the Coast Guard
Administration and coastal patrol units, also took part in the
exercise.
</P>
<P>
The four-day live-fire Han Kuang 23 exercise began a day earlier
with three types of air force jet fighters -- the U.S.-built
F-16, the French Mirage 2000-5 and the locally developed
Indigenous Defense Fighter -- practicing emergency landings and
takeoffs on a freeway in western Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
It marked the first time in 29 years the three types of fighters,
which form the backbone of the air force, demonstrated their
skills at the same time.
</P>
<P>
The live-fire wargames, staged in Penghu, Changhua, Yilan,
Hsinchu, Taichung and Pingtung, are the largest in terms of areas
covered and number of participants involved.
</P>
<P>
The Taichung Harbor drill was directed by Army Commander-in-Chief
Gen. Chao Shih-chang and witnessed by over 500 people including
Lin Feng-hsi, executive director of the Central Taiwan Joint
Services Center of the Executive Yuan, Legislator Yeh Chin-piao,
elected representatives, and representatives of schools and civic
groups.
