<P>
The Cabinet approved Wednesday the national languages development
draft law which is aimed at protecting the equality and variety
of languages used by different ethnic groups in the country.
</P>
<P>
Premier Su Tseng-chang said the government should respect all
languages and not repeat the same mistaken policy of the former
Kuomintang government in which local languages other than
Mandarin were suppressed.
</P>
<P>
"Languages are an important cultural heritage. All languages
should be given the same level of importance and granted equal
status, " Su said during a weekly Cabinet meeting after the draft
law was adopted.
</P>
<P>
Through the efforts made by the government in recent years, some
endangered native languages, such as Hakka, are seeing a
renaissance, Su said.
</P>
<P>
The draft law states that national languages refer to the natural
languages used by different ethnic groups in the country and that
citizens should not be restricted or discriminated against while
using national languages.
</P>
<P>
The right of foreigners and naturalized immigrants to use the
languages of their original countries should be respected, the
draft says, adding that the government should incorporate and
respect language variety while promoting  the development  of
national languages.
</P>
<P>
The draft stipulates that the government should advance the
preservation, learning and research of national languages and
should work out plans to restore endangered languages.
</P>
<P>
It says that citizens can use any national languages  in
publication, audio/video broadcast, internet transmission or
other forms of media communications.
</P>
<P>
While the government should provide incentives to encourage
universities to establish departments or institutes dedicated to
the research of endangered languages,  all levels of schools and
pre-school institutions should provide opportunities for students
to learn various national languages, according to the draft.
</P>
<P>
It says citizens can request that the government provide services
in any of the national languages.
