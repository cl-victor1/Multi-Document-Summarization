TAIWAN REJECTS CHINA'S IHR CLAIM
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Geneva,  May 15 (CNA) 05/16/07  14:36:26 (By Neil Lu and Y.F.
Low)
</P>
<P>
Taiwan rejected Tuesday China's unilateral announcement that the
International Health Regulations (IHR) applies to the "entire
territory" of China, including Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Dismissing the claim as invalid in a statement,  Taiwan's
Department of Health (DOH) noted that China has no jurisdiction
over Taiwan and has not negotiated with Taiwan over the IHR
issue.
</P>
<P>
DOH officials said there is a "very wide perception gap" between
China and the World Health Organization (WHO) on the application
of the IHR in China, because according to WHO officials, China
has not implemented the IHR or designated a national IHR focal
point as a channel of communication with the WHO.
</P>
<P>
Although the revised IHR is only set to be fully implemented June
15 this year, Taiwan has implemented the IHR ahead of schedule
and has designated the DOH's Center for Disease Control (CDC) as
the country's national focal point with the WHO, the officials
said.
</P>
<P>
According to China's state-controlled Xinhua News Agency, Beijing
issued a statement Monday announcing that the IHR applies to the
"entire territory" of China, including Hong Kong, Macau and
Taiwan, and China's permanent mission to the United Nations in
Geneva has sent the statement to the WHO Secretariat.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, China's Minister of Health Gao Qiang said during a
news conference Monday in Geneva that Beijing plans to sign a
memorandum of understanding with the WHO on the IHR's application
to Taiwan and that it has consulted with the WHO Secretariat on
the issue on many occasions.
</P>
<P>
However, little progress has been made in the consultations
because Taiwan "does not recognize, accept or comply with" the
"one China" principle, Gao said.
</P>
<P>
According to Taiwan's Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs Yang
Tzu-pao, China is planning to make the IHR applicable to Taiwan
through an exchange of letters with the WHO Secretariat, and
Taiwan has sternly turned down the offer.
</P>
<P>
Instead, Taiwan has requested an exchange of letters as a "non-
member"  with the WHO Secretariat  on the issues of IHR
application in Taiwan and the designation of the CDC as its
national focal point, but the WHO has yet to respond to the
request, Yang said.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Health Hou Sheng-mou noted that in handling the issue
of the IHR's application to Taiwan, China considers Taiwan as one
of its provinces, which he said is totally unacceptable to
Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan's bid to become a full member of the WHO was thwarted as
the World Health Assembly (WHA), the decision-making arm of the
WHO, adopted Monday a motion by a vote of 148-17 with two
abstentions to strike the issue of Taiwan's membership off the
agenda of this year's meeting scheduled for May 14-23 in Geneva.
