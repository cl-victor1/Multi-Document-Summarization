Washington, May 15 (CNA) 05/16/07  13:39:36 (By Chiehyu Lin &amp;

The U.S. State Department reiterated its support Tuesday for
Taiwan to attend annual meetings as an observer of the World
Health Assembly (WHA) , the decision-making arm of the World
Health Organization (WHO).
</P>
<P>
State Department officials of East Asian and Pacific affairs made
the remarks in response to Taiwan media inquiries after Taiwan
suffered a setback in its bid for membership in the WHO under the
name of "Taiwan."
</P>
<P>
The bid was rejected Tuesday at the WHA in Geneva, Switzerland,
with 17 WHO members voting in favor of membership for Taiwan
being discussed, while 148 members, including the United States,
voted against the idea.
</P>
<P>
It was the first time that Taiwan applied for entry into the WHO
as a full member under the name of "Taiwan."
</P>
<P>
The United States will not support Taiwan's efforts to join an
international organization whose members have to be sovereign
countries, the officials said, noting that this is Washington's
standing policy and position on the issue.
</P>
<P>
However, the U.S. government encourages Taiwan to participate in
international organizations in a meaningful manner and believes
that the Taiwan people are capable of making contributions in the
area of global public health and therefore should enjoy the
relevant rights and benefits, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
According to Act No. 243 signed by President George W. Bush after
being passed by the Senate in 2003, the U.S. government is
obliged to support Taiwan's bid for observer status in the WHA.
The executive branch is also obliged to brief Congress on how it
will assist Taiwan in the matter before the opening of the annual
WHA gathering.
