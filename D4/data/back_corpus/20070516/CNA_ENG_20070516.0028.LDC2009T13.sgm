CHINA HAS NO JURISDICTION OVER TAIWAN: DOH
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taipei,  May 16 (CNA) 05/16/07  18:02:09 (By Y.F. Low)
</P>
<P>
The Department of Health (DOH) released a five-point statement
Wednesday to rebuke Beijing's claim that the International Health
Regulations (IHR) covers Taiwan as part of China's territory.
</P>
<P>
The statement was issued in the wake Beijing's announcement
Monday that the revised IHR -- set to be fully implemented June
15 this year -- applies to the "entire territory" of China,
including Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
The full text of the DOH statement is as follows:
</P>
<P>
1. China has no jurisdiction  over Taiwan,  including  its
</P>
<P>
territorial waters and airspace. China's claim is unilateral
</P>
<P>
and is inconsistent with the facts.
</P>
<P>
2. On May 13, 2006, the DOH's Center for Disease Control (CDC)
</P>
<P>
informed the World Health Organization (WHO) of the country's
</P>
<P>
intention of implementing the IHR ahead of schedule, a move
</P>
<P>
which received positive recognition from the United States,
</P>
<P>
Japan and European Union. This proves that Taiwan is not
</P>
<P>
subject to China's control.
</P>
<P>
3. Minister of Health Hou Sheng-mou wrote to WHO Director-General
</P>
<P>
Margaret Chan May 2 this year to repeat the fact that the
</P>
<P>
country has implemented the IHR ahead of schedule and has
</P>
<P>
designated the CDC as its national focal point.
</P>
<P>
4. China's Ministry of Health has never contacted Taiwan on
</P>
<P>
issues concerning IHR implementation. Hou Sheng-mou wrote to
</P>
<P>
China's Minister of Health Gao Qiang May 4 this year to
</P>
<P>
request talks with China on cross-Taiwan Strait health issues,
</P>
<P>
but the request has yet to receive any positive response from
</P>
<P>
China.
</P>
<P>
5. The DOH has asked WHO officials about China's announcement and
</P>
<P>
has been told that the WHO has not received any formal
</P>
<P>
document or material from China.
