PREGNANT WOMEN CANNOT PROMOTE INFANT FORMULA: DOH
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taipei, May 16 (CNA) 05/16/07  20:45:14 (By Lilian Wu)

<P>
Pregnant women and babies under one year old can no longer be
used to promote infant formula, baby food or nutritional
supplements under a consensus reached between the Department of
Health (DOH) and representatives of formula manufactures and
children's groups Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
They also agreed that the names for formula for babies under one
year old and over one year old should be clearly differentiated
to avoid confusion.
</P>
<P>
The DOH has convened similar meetings before to ask formula
manufacturers to act in accordance with the World Health
Organization's code on alternatives to breast milk.
</P>
<P>
But due to the lucrative profits involved -- it is estimated that
the annual product value of infant formula for babies under one
is around NT$1.5 billion (US$45.45 million) -- and the fact that
the code is not a law,  the code  is no more than a toothless
self-regulation.
</P>
<P>
To solve the "chaotic" marketing phenomenon that sees formula
manufacturers hiring pregnant entertainers to promote their
products, the DOH has again invited representatives from the
Consumers' Foundation, the infant formula manufacturing sector
and the Breastfeeding Association of Taiwan, as well as pediatric
groups, to meet to work out a new self-regulation code.
</P>
<P>
Cheng Huei-wen, director of the Department of Food Safety under
the DOH, said that although formula manufacturers often claim in
their ads that their products contain some of the nutrients found
in breast milk, "breast milk cannot be copied."
</P>
<P>
From July 1, formula manufacturers will have to act in accordance
with the DOH regulations and they will not promote the
ingredients and function of nutritional supplements.
