TAIWAN'S NEW WHO BID PROPOSAL A MORALE BOOSTER: CIVIC GROUPS
</HEADLINE>

Representatives of civic groups who attended the World Health
Assembly (WHA) meeting in Geneva said Wednesday that it boosted
their morale to hold their heads high calling for support from
the international community on Taiwan's new bid proposal to enter
the World Health Organization (WHO) as a full member.
</P>
<P>
"This has been my 11th trip to Geneva for the WHA but it felt
like the first time because we arrived with the name of Taiwan on
our chests, " said Wu Shu- min, president of the Foundation of
Medical Professionals Alliance in Taiwan (FMPAT), which has been
one of the most active civic groups in supporting Taiwan's WHO
bid.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan has failed time and again in its WHO bid -- whether as a
"health entity" or bidding for WHA observer status -- because of
China's oppression, said Tu Shiing-jer, vice president of the
Taiwan United Nations Alliance (TAIUNA) who also once served as
health minister.

<P>
More than 100 overseas Taiwanese, most of them doctors and
physicians from Europe and North America, volunteered to promote
Taiwan's bid in Geneva, Wu said.
</P>
<P>
"If you were there, you could feel the difference. The morale was
high. The passion and love for Taiwan was extraordinary. It was
something I have never felt before during my past 10 trips to
Geneva, " Wu said.
</P>
<P>
"And it was all because we finally shouted out to the world about
who we are and what we want. This is a difficult road, but we'll
keep coming back, " Wu said, claiming that constitutional re-
engineering and referendum will make Taiwan's entry into the WHO
easier.
