Foreign domestic helpers are entitled to a reasonable amount of
time off and personal space, and employers who violate this right
will be subject to fines, Taipei City's top official in charge of
labor affairs said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Su Ying-kuei, director of the Taipei City Department of Labor,
said that beginning from March 1, all of the 914 Taipei families
who employ foreign helpers will be required to provide a single
room exclusively for the domestic helper's use and to allow the
helper to sleep for at least eight consecutive hours, as demanded
by the Philippine authorities in charge of overseas employment.
</P>
<P>
Violators  will be fined between NT$60,000  (US$1,817)  to
NT$300,000 (US$9,085) and repeat violators could have their
permits to hire foreign helpers revoked, Su noted.
</P>
<P>
Although the personal space and minimum eight-hour sleeping time
requirements were requested by the Philippine government,  the
requirements will also be applicable to Taipei families who
employ domestic helpers from other foreign countries, Su added.
</P>
<P>
Su made the announcement at a news conference to which officials
from the representative offices of the Philippines, Thailand,
Vietnam and Indonesia were also invited to attend.
