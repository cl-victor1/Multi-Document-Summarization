FORMER PRESIDENT DECLARES DIFFERENT STANCE TO THAT OF DPP
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

Tokyo,  Feb. 12 (CNA) 02/12/07  18:17:38 (By Elizabeth Hsu)

<P>
Former President Lee Teng-hui, who used to be reputed as the
"godfather of Taiwan independence, " has recently said he shares
no common views with the ruling Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) and has declared that his future efforts will focus on the
"reconstruction of democratic Taiwan."
</P>
<P>
Lee made the remarks during an interview with the Sankei Shimbun,
a mass- circulation Japanese economic daily.  The interview was
published in the paper's Monday edition.
</P>
<P>
Lee reiterated that Taiwan is an independent and sovereign
country that is faced with the problem of how to become a
"normal" country, rather than how to seek independence.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan should endeavor to make up the "deficiencies" that impede
its sovereignty as a democratic independent country, Lee said.
</P>
<P>
Talking about the future development of the opposition Taiwan
Solidarity Union (TSU), which regards Lee as its "spiritual
leader, " Lee said the party is undergoing a complete
reconstruction under the leadership of Huang Kun-huei, who took
over the chairmanship last month.
</P>
<P>
While the party is working on amendments to its platform and a
name change, Lee said it will cut its political ties with the
DPP, concentrating on work aimed at putting together a Taiwan-
centric consciousness.
</P>
<P>
In reply to questions about his controversial remarks published
by Next Magazine in early February in which the magazine claimed
he was "giving up independence, open to investment from China and
looking forward to visiting China, " Lee claimed that Taiwan's
economic growth is stagnated while the number of unemployed is
growing and the gap between the rich and poor is expanding.
</P>
<P>
For all that, Lee claimed that the ruling party is still
reluctant  to make efforts  to resolve  the problems  but is
concentrating on a power struggle with the opposition Kuomintang.
</P>
<P>
The DPP's economic policy is a "failure, " according to Lee, who
suggested that the ruling party try to correct its wrongs while
making efforts to end interparty conflicts.
</P>
<P>
He also claimed that he has never considered visiting China under
communist rule.
