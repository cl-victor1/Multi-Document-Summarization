PRESIDENT'S SON-IN-LAW TO RESIGN FROM NTUH
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taipei,  Feb. 12 (CNA) 02/12/07  19:03:45 (By Y.F. Low)
</P>
<P>
National Taiwan University Hospital (NTUH) confirmed Monday it
has approved the resignation of President Chen Shui-bian's
disgraced son-in-law, Chao Chien-ming.
</P>
<P>
Chao's resignation will take effect Feb. 14, according to NTUH
spokesman Lin Ho- hsiung.
</P>
<P>
There have been reports that Chao has been hired by Sin Lau
Hospital in southern Tainan City, but the hospital declined to
confirm the reports.
</P>
<P>
Chao, who was an orthopedic surgeon at NTUH, was suspended from
duty immediately after he was indicted in July 2006 on charges of
insider trading of Taiwan Development Corp. (TDC) stocks.
</P>
<P>
NTUH voted down Chao's request to return to his job in October on
the grounds that he "seriously violated medical ethics."
</P>
<P>
The Taipei District Court sentenced Chao to six years in prison
and fined him NT$30 million  (US$909,090)  in December  after
determining that he took advantage of his influence to obtain
important information regarding TDC share prices, based upon
which he traded TDC shares for huge profits.
</P>
<P>
According to the court, Chao got more than NT$54 million in
actual gains from the trading together with his father, although
pro forma earnings  calculated in accordance  with the Securities
Transaction Act amounted to only NT$4.27 million.
</P>
<P>
Chao has appealed his case to the Taiwan High Court.
