The opposition Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU) will run an ad
Tuesday to solicit a new name for the party, TSU officials said
Monday.
</P>
<P>
The ad will describe the TSU as a political party that insists on
a Taiwan- centric path and that speaks for the middle-class and
the underprivileged, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
"To demonstrate the new direction of the TSU, the party will need
a new name," the ad will say.
</P>
<P>
TSU officials urged the public to look at the TSU's Web site at
www.tsu.org.tw and enter their proposed names in a competition
for the chance to win NT$100,000 (US$3,050) in cash for the
winning name.
</P>
<P>
New TSU Chairman Huang Kung-huei said upon assuming the post last
month that he will engage in party overhaul in an effort to win
public trust.
</P>
<P>
Huang said at the time that he is also considering whether to
change the name of the party to project a clear set of values to
"rekindle the passion of the people."
</P>
<P>
The TSU was founded by former Interior Minister Huang Chu-wen in
July 2001 with former President Lee serving as its "spiritual
leader."
