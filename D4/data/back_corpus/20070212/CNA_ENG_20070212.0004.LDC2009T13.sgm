The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) spokesman declined to
comment Monday on a newspaper report that just-retired Armed
Forces Chief-of-Staff Lee Tien-yu will be assigned to serve as
Taiwan's representative to Singapore, replacing Hu Wei- chen.
</P>
<P>
MOFA spokesman Wang Chien-yeh said neither he nor the foreign
ministry have any idea about the report, carried in Monday's
United Daily News.
</P>
<P>
The daily said that Gen. Lee, who retired from the military chief
of staff post just last month, will be appointed by President
Chen Shui-bian soon as Taiwan's new representative in Singapore,
replacing Hu, who has served in the post for more than two years.
</P>
<P>
According to the daily, Lee's appointment will be part of a
"major reshuffle" of military personnel that President Chen has
pushed to carry out since January.
