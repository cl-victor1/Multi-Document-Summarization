POSTAL CO. REDESIGNATION REFLECTS MAINSTREAM OPINION: PRESIDENT
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  Feb. 12 (CNA) 02/12/07  23:43:44 (By Flor Wang)

President Chen Shui-bian said Monday that renaming the state-
owned postal company to include "Taiwan" in its title complies
with prevailing mainstream public opinion, which favors promotion
of Taiwan's distinct national identity.
</P>
<P>
Chen made the remarks while giving a speech at a plaque-unveiling
ceremony to mark the redesignation of Chunghwa Post Co. --
Chunghwa means China -- to Taiwan Post Co. as part of the
government's ongoing name rectification  campaign  to prevent
Taiwan's  state-owned enterprises  from being confused with
similarly named Chinese counterparts.
</P>
<P>
Acknowledging that the name change campaign has inevitably met
criticism, misunderstanding, opposition and obstruction, Chen
said the government should nonetheless  be adamant,  determined
and responsible in doing what it thinks is right for the nation.
</P>
<P>
If the government pulls out all the stops to fulfill "mission
impossible", Chen said he believes the campaign will eventually
win public support and recognition. He called for widespread
public backing in future endeavors, including pushing to have the
country join international organizations -- including the United
Nations -- under the name "Taiwan".
</P>
<P>
According to the president, the postal company name change is
completely justified and responsible. He also said the change
also conveys "high praise for the country's high-quality mail
system" that has served well the Taiwan people over the past 120
years.
</P>
<P>
Chen said the previous authoritarian  government assumed a
negative attitude toward all things Taiwanese, including the
dialect, culture and artistry due to its own rigidly "Chinese
supremacy" mindset and consciousness. This animosity led the past
government to prohibiting private groups from using "Taiwan" in
their titles.
</P>
<P>
Gone are those dark days, Chen said, adding that Taiwan has
democratized  and all local people should be freed from such
unreasonable restrictions and courageously embrace the beautiful
name of their homeland. "We should no longer hesitate to call our
country Taiwan," he added.
</P>
<P>
Chen said Taiwan Post Co. will issue the first set of "Taiwan
stamps" Feb. 28 featuring the Taipei 228 Memorial Museum in their
design. The issuance will be the first carrying the mark "Taiwan
stamp" following the company's name change from "Chunghwa Post
Co." to "Taiwan Post Co." This set will be a tribute to Taiwan's
century of struggle for freedom, democracy, human rights and
peace, Chen said.

<P>
Speaking at the same event, Premier Su Tseng-chang described the
government's name change campaign as a "justifiable move" to
"recover the historical truth" and he gave his assurance that
postal workers' and customers' rights and interests will not be
affected by the change.
