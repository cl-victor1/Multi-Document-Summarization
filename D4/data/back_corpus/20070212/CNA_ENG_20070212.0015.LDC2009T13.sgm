Taipei,  Feb.  12 (CNA) 02/12/07  16:23:32 (By Y.F. Low)

<P>
As much as 88 percent of condoms sold in erotic product stores
have not passed inspections by the health authorities, according
to the results of a survey released Monday by the Consumer's
Foundation.
</P>
<P>
The survey was conducted among 25 condom products sampled by the
foundation from 11 erotic product stores in the city and county
of Taipei from Feb. 3-4.
</P>
<P>
While all condoms sold on the market are required to be
registered with the Department of Health (DOH) as a medical
product and to receive a license code after passing inspection by
health authorities, the survey found that 18 of the surveyed
products did not carry a license code and four others had codes
that did not belong to them.
</P>
<P>
The survey shows that only two products were labeled with
complete information as required by the Pharmaceutical Affairs
Law, including the name and address of the manufacturer, name of
the product and its license code, the manufacture date or
shipment identification number, as well as the expiration date.
</P>
<P>
Six of the products carried inconsistent labels in their inner
and outer packagings in terms of their manufacture and expiration
dates, and four others had passed their expiration dates,
according to the survey.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, among 18 condom products with special fragrances, 12,
or 67 percent, either did not indicate their ingredients at all
or failed to label their ingredients clearly, the survey shows.
</P>
<P>
Responding to the results of the survey, foundation chairman
Cheng Jen-hung urged the DOH to step up its inspection of condoms
sold on the Taiwan market and fine manufacturers failing to
comply with the regulations.
