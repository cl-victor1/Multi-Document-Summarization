HEARING ON REBAR FOUNDER'S CASE NOT OPEN TO PUBLIC
</HEADLINE>

Los  Angeles,  Feb.  13  (CNA) 02/14/07  13:09:26 (By Chu Lu-
sheng and Y.F. Low)
</P>
<P>
A preliminary hearing on Taiwan fugitive tycoon Wang You-theng's
illegal entry into the United States was held as a closed-door
session in San Pedro, California Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The judge ruled that the hearing, which began at 8 a.m. at an
immigration court in the immigration holding center in San Pedro,
was not open to the public at the request of Wang's attorneys,
shutting out a large group of Taiwan media members waiting there
to cover the event.
</P>
<P>
The hearing ended two-and-a-half  hours later,  but Wang's
attorneys declined to make any comment regarding the case despite
inquiries by the media.
</P>
<P>
The next hearing on the case reportedly is scheduled for March 6
or 7, but U.S. justice officials would not confirm the
information.
</P>
<P>
Wang, founder of the Rebar Asia Pacific Group, has been detained
by U.S. immigration authorities since Feb. 2, when he tried to
return to Los Angeles with both his Republic of China and
Dominican Republic passports canceled, following a failed attempt
to flee to Myanmar via Singapore.
</P>
<P>
According to Yang Ling, a former U.S. immigration official who is
now working as an immigration lawyer in Los Angeles, Wang could
have petitioned for political asylum through his lawyers, which
was the reason why the hearing on his case was allowed to be held
as a closed-door session.
</P>
<P>
However, Yang said that such a petition by Wang would have slim
chance of success as Taiwan is not defined by the United States
as a country where citizens suffer political persecution.
</P>
<P>
Even if Wang makes up a story to try to justify his petition for
political asylum, U.S. immigration authorities will judge whether
Wang was actually being persecuted or just making an excuse to
evade facing trial in Taiwan for allegedly breaking the law, Yang
said.
</P>
<P>
Wang is suspected of having embezzled billions of dollars in
corporate funds from the group before fleeing with his wife, Wang
Chin She-ying, to China late last year and then to the United
States early this year.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan authorities placed the couple on the country's most-wanted
list Jan. 15 and are actively seeking U.S. assistance to have
them repatriated back to Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Yang said that Wang might be trying to use the political asylum
petition to extend his stay in the United States to facilitate
his application for family- based immigration, given the fact
that his wife is a U.S. citizen.
