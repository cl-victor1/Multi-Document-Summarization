The 2006 cohort of Young Diplomats, representing  the young

Francisco Feb. 13 for a friendly visit as part of their scheduled
tour of Canada and the United States, a government official said
Wednesday.

Yeh Fei-bi, deputy spokeswoman of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs
(MOFA) and Lin Wen-tung, from the Ministry of Education (MOE),
are leading the delegation on its tour of Vancouver, Seattle, and
San Francisco.

This is the fifth delegation  of Young  Diplomats  to be co-
sponsored by the MOFA and the MOE. During its two-day visit to
San Francisco, the delegation will visit the city government, the
Taipei Economic and Cultural Office in San Francisco, and Lowell
High School to exchange views and increase their understanding of
the city.

The delegation is composed of 12 students from three schools: Wu-
ling Senior High School in Taoyuan, Taipei Municipal Nanhu
School, and National Hsinchu Girls' Senior High School. These
three schools were selected from 137 applicant institutions
through various competitions, including group performances and
impromptu English public speaking.

Yeh said that the Young Diplomats program aims to encourage
students to pay attention to international affairs and improve
their English communication skills, and that the delegation's
