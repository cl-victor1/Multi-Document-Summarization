CABINET TO REVOKE NCC DECISION FAVORING EX-KMT BROADCASTER
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taipei,  Feb. 14 (CNA) 02/14/07  23:39:50 (By Y.C. Jou)

Disaffected with a National Communications Commission (NCC)
administrative decision seen as unduly favoring a formerly
Kuomintang-owned (KMT) radio station, the Executive Yuan
announced Wednesday that it will void the offending decision.
</P>
<P>
The Executive Yuan will also form a team to investigate the
possibility of misconduct and negligence at the NCC,  Cabinet
spokesman Cheng Wen-tsang said in a news conference.
</P>
<P>
The NCC's  moves  to make a deal with the Broadcasting
Corporation of China (BCC) , to repeal a previous governmental
decision and disregard the Cabinet's policy is a violation of due
administrative procedure and ethics, and has done serious harm to
the prestige of the government, Minister  without Portfolio  Lin
Ferng-ching said.
</P>
<P>
When the BCC in 2004 applied to renew its broadcasting license
with the Government Information Office (GIO), the GIO listed
several conditions, including one concerning proportioning of
political ads by party on the BCC during the presidential
election period, and another that asked the KMT company not to
dispose of its ill-gotten real estate before the delivery of a
verdict in property litigation. The GIO also asked the BCC to
return to government control a number of frequencies.
</P>
<P>
The BCC filed a lawsuit  against  the GIO and asked for
compensation from the state after an administrative appeal with
the Executive Yuan was rejected. In 2006, the newly-founded NCC,
which took over the GIO's supervisory  role regarding the
country's broadcasting companies -- and thus the lawsuit case --
reached a settlement with the BCC, and in early December voided
the GIO's previous stipulations.
</P>
<P>
Later that month, former UFO Radio Chairman and former New Party
politician Jaw Shau-kong confirmed that he has bought the BCC.
</P>
<P>
NCC Vice Chairman Shih Shih-hau reiterated Wednesday that the
commission's moves were justified, saying the conditions that the
GIO imposed on the BCC were irrelevant.
</P>
<P>
Election  ads are the business  of the Central Election
Commission, while the property litigation was a civil case;
neither has anything to do with the renewal of a broadcasting
license, Shih said, adding that the settlement has averted
scenarios in which the government may have needed to pay
compensation.
</P>
<P>
Lin Ferng-ching, however, said that the NCC should have gone to
the Cabinet for permission when seeking to reach a settlement,
rather than arbitrarily deciding to repeal previous stipulations.
