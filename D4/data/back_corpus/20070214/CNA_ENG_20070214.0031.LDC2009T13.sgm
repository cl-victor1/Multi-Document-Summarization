CHAIRMAN'S RESIGNATION TAKES EFFECT: KMT OFFICIAL

Taipei,  Feb. 14 (CNA) 02/14/07  18:49:10 (By Flor Wang)
</P>
<P>
Main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Ma Ying-jeou's
resignation has become effective and will be sent to the party's
Central Standing Committee (CSC) for reference during its Feb. 28
weekly meeting, KMT Secretary-General Wu Den-yih said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
According to Wu, Ma remained firm on his promise to quit the KMT
chairmanship despite the CSC's efforts to persuade him to stay in
the post after Ma was indicted a day earlier on corruption
charges over his alleged misuse of a special municipal allowance
earmarked for his discretionary use when he served as mayor of
Taipei from 1998 to 2006.
</P>
<P>
Ma tendered his resignation and officially announced his bid to
run in the 2008 presidential race following his indictment
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
As Ma's resignation has taken effect, First Vice Chairman Wu Po-
hsiung, in accordance with the party's regulations, will serve as
KMT acting chairman in the coming three months until a new
chairman is elected through a direct vote among party members.
</P>
<P>
In an effort to secure Ma's chance to take part in the next
presidential election, the powerful CSC rescinded Tuesday evening
a special clause implemented last July that bans indicted party
members from participating in elections, on the grounds that it
goes against the party platform that prohibits only convicted
members from running for public office.
</P>
<P>
According to Juan Kang-meng, director of the KMT's Evaluation and
Discipline Committee, the special clause has been removed and the
party will only follow its platform to screen KMT members'
candidacy in coming elections.
</P>
<P>
With the removal of the special clause, the KMT need not discuss
the issue of Ma's indictment and therefore, the question of
whether or not Ma should be suspended from participating in party
activities does not exist, Juan said, adding that such rights of
other KMT cadres who violated the special clause will be
reinstated, including Hsinchu County Magistrate  Cheng Yung-chin
and lawmaker Chang Chang-tsair.
