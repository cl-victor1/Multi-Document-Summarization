U.S. SCHOLAR DESCRIBES INDICTED KMT HEAD AS 'CLEVER STRATEGIST'

Washington,  Feb. 13 (CNA) 02/14/07  13:34:20 (By Chiehyu Lin,
Jorge Liu and Deborah Kuo)
</P>
<P>
A U.S. scholar on Tuesday described Ma Ying-jeou, chairman of
Taiwan's main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) who was indicted on
corruption charges the day before and subsequently resigned from
the position, as "a very clever strategist" for announcing his
bid to run for the presidency in 2008 almost immediately after
the indictment.
</P>
<P>
June Teufel Dreyer, a China hand and a professor of political
science at the University of Miami at Coral Gables, said during
an interview with the CNA that "sadly, people in Taiwan are not
shocked to hear that politicians are corrupt, and in any case,
the proceedings will probably drag on for so long that the
general public will lose interest."
</P>
<P>
Describing Ma as a "very clever strategist, " Dreyer said that
there is no doubt Ma will be able to portray himself as a victim
in this indictment and that he has tried to maintain his
innocence and vowed to clear his name by announcing his bid for
the presidency in 2008.
</P>
<P>
She stressed that it is uncertain whether Ma's crisis has been
solved by making the announcement, noting that "one of the
reasons is that Taiwan politics is so unpredictable."
</P>
<P>
"I wonder, however, if Ma's indictment will change many voters'
minds," she added.
</P>
<P>
In related news, renowned U.S. China hand Alan D. Romberg said
that a key to Ma's political future is not so much his formal
status in the KMT party as what the public reaction is both to
the indictment and to Ma's response.
</P>
<P>
Romberg, a senior associate and director of East Asian studies at
the Henry L. Stimson Center, said that if the public takes the
indictment -- without a conviction -- as tarnishing Ma's image
and therefore turn away from him, the whole political situation
in Taiwan will open up, both within the KMT and in the "pan-blue,
pan-green" competition.
</P>
<P>
If, on the other hand, the public continues to view Ma as a man
of integrity -- a standing that he obviously considers extremely
important -- and continues to support him, and, of course, if he
is not found guilty, then he will continue to have a good chance
of winning the KMT nomination and perhaps the presidential
election, Romberg continued.
</P>
<P>
Romberg said that in the wake of his indictment, Ma has taken two
steps to try to consolidate his political position. First, Ma
followed through on his promise to resign as KMT chairman, thus
showing himself to be a man of his word. And second, Ma has made
clear that he will run for president, thus forestalling a
political vacuum within the KMT or an opportunity for the ruling
Democratic Progressive  Party to dominate the political  field
while the "pan-blue" camp struggles to find its moorings.
</P>
<P>
He said the race for the presidency was always destined to be
closer than current public opinion  polls indicate,  and Ma's
indictment adds even greater uncertainty.
</P>
<P>
If Ma is able to quickly clear himself -- and he undoubtedly will
seek an early trial to do just that -- then this uncertainty may
also quickly pass. If, on the other hand, it takes some time to
bring the case to resolution, this will undoubtedly handicap Ma
in his quest for Taiwan's presidency and create new ferment in
Taiwan's political situation, Romberg commented.
</P>
<P>
Romberg also predicted that if Ma were to be "fatally hurt" by
the indictment and related developments, this would seem to
enhance the chances of a DPP victory in 2008. While this does not
mean that the cross-strait situation could not improve -- clearly
Beijing wants improvement and thinks some progress would be
possible with either Su Tseng-chang or Frank Hsieh as president
-- nonetheless it would alter Beijing's perception about the
likely pace and extent of that improvement, he said.
