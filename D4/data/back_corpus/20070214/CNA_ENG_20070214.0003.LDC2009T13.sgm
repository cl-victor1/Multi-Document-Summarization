"INSTITUTIONAL TRAPS" PROBLEM SHOULD BE ADDRESSED: VP
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  Feb,  13 (CNA) 02/14/07  10:43:52 (By Y.C. Jou)
</P>
<P>
Vice President Annette Lu said Tuesday, upon hearing about the
indictment of opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman and former
Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou, that the problem of possible
"institutional traps" should be addressed.
</P>
<P>
Lu was responding to queries from the press during a visit to a
Taipei community. She claimed to be "surprised" to hear about the
indictment.
</P>
<P>
"Some have fiercely attacked President Chen-Shui-bian over his
state affairs fund case, " Lu said, adding that "now it's time
for more contemplation on whether there are some 'institutional
traps'".
</P>
<P>
She said there should not be joy over Ma's indictment, for its
impact can be profound.
</P>
<P>
According to the indictment, during his two consecutive terms as
Taipei mayor from 1998 to 2006 Ma received a total of NT$15.29
million (US$461,934) in special allowance funds designated for
the mayor's discretionary use and failed to return the unspent
NT$11.17 million kept in his account.
</P>
<P>
Ma has pointed out that his treatment of the fund is in line with
the way such funds are treated by every high-ranking public
official across party lines.
</P>
<P>
Sympathizers of Chen have also described the special state
affairs fund case, in which the first lady is on trial on
corruption charges, as an incident caused by the lack of laws
that clearly define the way such money should be dealt with.
</P>
<P>
Lu refused to comment further on Ma's case, saying she had not
read the indictment.
