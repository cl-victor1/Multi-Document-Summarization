FORMER KMT CHAIRMAN'S MENTOR 'STUNNED' BY INDICTMENT
</HEADLINE>

New York, Feb. 13 (CNA) 02/14/07  14:35:13 (By Jaw-pyng Hwang
&amp; Elizabeth Hsu)
</P>
<P>
Former Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou's mentor at Harvard Law School,
Jerome A. Cohen, described the indictment of Ma on charges of
embezzlement the day before as "stunning" and "surprising."
</P>
<P>
On Ma's announcement of his bid for 2008 presidency, the U.S.
authority on law said if Ma feels he was wronged, he should try
to prove his innocence. And if he is clear of the charges, Cohen
said there is no doubt that the opposition Kuomintang chairman
can run for the presidency.
</P>
<P>
During an interview with the CNA, Cohen, who is currently a law
professor at New York University, described Ma as a person of
honesty and uprightness. He said he feels sympathetic and sad
just as what he felt after the imprisonment of his another
Taiwanese student -- current Vice President Annette Lu -- in the
80s.
</P>
<P>
Both Ma and Lu were Cohen's students at Harvard Law School.
Returning home from the United States in 1978, Lu joined in the
pro-democracy movement in Taiwan. However, because of a 20-minute
public speech at a rally held to commemorate Human Rights Day
Dec. 10, 1979, she was subsequently sentenced to 12 years in
prison for sedition.
</P>
<P>
Lu ended up spending five years and four months in jail before
being given a medical parole due to thyroid cancer.
</P>
<P>
Asked about the Taiwan High Prosecutors Office's move to indict
Ma for allegedly embezzling NT$11.17 million (US$337,650) from a
special allowance fund during his two mayoral terms, Cohen said
he is not familiar with the case and expressed that he does not
want his remarks on the issue to be "misinterpreted" as support
for either the ruling "pan-green camp" or the opposition "pan-
blue alliance" in Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
"People should give Taiwan's judicial system a chance,  "
suggested the scholar, who has been paying attention for a long
time to Taiwan's democratic development as well as human rights
and judicial practices in China. He also noted that Ma's
indictment is a whole new judicial case and that the judicial
system has been facing greater  pressure  given  the increasing
level of inter-party confrontation.
</P>
<P>
The case could be an "interesting" challenge for Taiwan in its
efforts to develop democratic politics, Cohen said.
</P>
<P>
Ma, who has portrayed himself as a political "Mr. Clean, "
tendered his resignation as KMT chairman and announced his bid to
run for the presidency in 2008 just hours after he was indicted.
He argued that if he is found guilty, then the same fate will
befall almost all government executives and everyone who has ever
served as a mayor or county magistrate.
