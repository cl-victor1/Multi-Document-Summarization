Tainan County Magistrate Su Huan-chih of the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) was acquitted of election bribery by the
Tainan District Prosecutor's Office Tuesday, county officials
said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The prosecutor's office was tipped off that the DPP's Tainan
County chapter sponsored a barbecue Oct. 9, 2005 to bribe voters
ahead of the county magistrate election late that year.
</P>
<P>
After a thorough probe, prosecutors indicted Su and 20 other DPP
candidates for county councilor and township chief elections as
well as DPP Tainan chaper staff members Jan. 20, 2006 on vote-
buying charges. Prosecutors even recommended that Su be given an
eight-month sentence.
</P>
<P>
But the district court acquitted all of the accused on the ground
that the barbecue was a DPP local chapter activity without any
intention to bribe voters.
