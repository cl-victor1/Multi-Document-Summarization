Tainan, southern  Taiwan, Feb.  14 (CNA) 02/14/07  20:31:43 (By

Law enforcement agents seized 45 kg of heroin bricks from two
Taiwanese fishing boats Wednesday after intercepting the boats at
sea two days ago.
</P>
<P>
Agents from the Bureau of Investigation's Kaohsiung office
arrested Hsu Tung- sheng, owner of the two fishing boats -- Yu Fa
102 and Yu Fa No. 2 -- and three accomplices: Hu Jui-chung,
skipper of Yu Fa 102; chief engineer officer Chen Shih-hsien; and
crew member Chen Teh-liang.
</P>
<P>
Altogether the agents found 106 heroin bricks, with an estimated
street value of NT$200 million (US$6.04 million), after the two
boats were intercepted by anti- smuggling ships and escorted to
Anping harbor in Tainan.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the Bureau of Investigation (BOI) said the
bureau's Kaohsiung office received tip-offs from foreign sources
last October that Hsu Tung-sheng would attempt to smuggle heroin
into Taiwan from Phuket Island, Thailand.
</P>
<P>
A special task force was subsequently formed to monitor the
activities of Hsu's boats. BOI agents also received aid from
anti-drug authorities  in Thailand and the United States Drug
Enforcement Administration to keep Hsu under surveillance while
he was in Thailand to contact his suppliers.
</P>
<P>
According to the spokesman, as Yu Fa 102 sailed into waters
approximately 190 nautical miles southwest of Taiwan, Hsu Tung-
sheng instructed its skipper, Hsu Hui-chung to phone Tungkang
harbor's fishery radio station via satellite, and claim that the
boat was low on fuel and needed its sister boat, Yu Fa No. 2, to
bring a supply of fuel and meet it in the open sea.
</P>
<P>
Actually, the spokesman explained, their real intention was to
have the Yu Fa No. 2 take possession of the heroin bricks in
order to avoid police inspection.
</P>
<P>
Two anti-smuggling ships dispatched to intercept Yu Fa 102 and Yu
Fa No. 2 met the two boats in waters southwest of Taiwan two days
ago and escorted them to Anping harbor. At that point, agents
boarded the boats and seized the heroin from where it was hidden
among the fishing nets and gear.
