Taipei,  May 12 (CNA) 05/12/07  20:13:54 (By Lilian Wu)

<P>
Main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) candidate Chang Tung-jung won
the Keelung mayoral by-election Saturday, the Keelung Election
Commission announced.
</P>
<P>
Commission officials said that Chang, presently speaker of
Keelung City Council, collected 56,115 votes. His two major
rivals, Liu Wen-hsiung of the People First Party (PFP) , who ran
as an independent, bagged 33,956 ballots, while Shih Shih- ming
of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party, garnered 26,908
votes. Two other contenders lagged far behind.
</P>
<P>
The turnout rate for the by-election -- made necessary after
Keelung Mayor Hsu Tsai-li died early this year from diabetes-
related complication -- was 45.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
Both the KMT and the PFP said that the results of the by-election
will not affect the future cooperation of the two parties, saying
that bilateral cooperation is a set policy.
</P>
<P>
KMT Legislator Hsu Shao-ping did complain that while Chang was
the joint candidate produced through a coordination mechanism
between the two parties, Liu nonetheless insisted on running as
an independent.
</P>
<P>
PFP Legislator Daniel Hwang was positive about KMT's "restrained"
approach in stumping for Chang, which he said has left room for
future cooperation between the two parties.
</P>
<P>
DPP Legislator Wang Tuoh said that he was "disappointed' over the
decision of Keelung people.
</P>
<P>
He admitted that Shih was not an ideal candidate, but was
gratified that he had fared better than expected.
