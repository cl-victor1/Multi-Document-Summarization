REPEATED PREMIERSHIP CHANGES BAD FOR NATIONAL DEVELOPMENT: MA

Taipei, May 12 (CNA) 05/12/07  14:48:12 (By Elizabeth Hsu)

Ma Ying-yeou, the presidential candidate for the opposition
Kuomintang (KMT), said Saturday that while he does not know why
Premier Su Tseng-chang wants to step down, he believes repeated
changes  in the premiership  do not favor national development.
</P>
<P>
Ma made the remarks during a visit to the southern county of
Pingtung when asked about Su's announced resignation earlier in
the day, which clears the way for Taiwan's sixth premier in seven
years.

<P>
"The government is obliged to build a stable country by providing
continuous political development and decisive policies," Ma said.
</P>
<P>
He believes it would be difficult for a government to do so given
constant changes in the premiership, Ma noted.
</P>
<P>
KMT spokesman Su Chun-pin also said that the party does not
understand why Su tendered his resignation. If the move is due to
the failure to push the 2007 budget bill through the Legislature,
he said the best way to resolve the problem is for the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) to sit down for talks with the
opposition.
</P>
<P>
Since the DPP took power in 2000, the government has churned
through five different premiers. On average, Su said each DPP
premier has served for a term shorter than the compulsory
16-month military service term.
