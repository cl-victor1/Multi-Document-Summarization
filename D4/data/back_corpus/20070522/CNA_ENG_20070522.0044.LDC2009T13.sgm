Students in Taipei engaged in an exchange program with their
counterparts in New York via video conferencing for the second
time Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The program is part of efforts by the U.S.-based GKE Co. to equip
U.S. students with a global view and a better understanding of
Chinese-speaking cultures.
</P>
<P>
Students at Hsin Sheng Elementary School and Zhongzheng Senior
High School in Taipei conducted the first exchange May 15, in
which students on both sides discussed sports, food and music.
</P>
<P>
During the second exchange, students talked about the Taiwanese
New York Yankees pitcher, Wang Chien-ming, and food.
</P>
<P>
According to GKE CEO James Chang, in the wake of the Sept. 11
terrorist attacks in 2001, the U.S. government has become more
aware of the importance of globalization and a world view.
</P>
<P>
The U.S.  government  decided to begin with education and
encouraged schools to teach students about the cultures of
different countries and areas, Chang noted.
</P>
<P>
Due to the rise of China, many countries are interested in
learning about China and the Chinese language, Chang went on,
adding that he hopes the video conferencing exchange program will
help U.S. students  establish  a basic understanding  of Chinese-
speaking societies and pique their interest in learning Chinese.
