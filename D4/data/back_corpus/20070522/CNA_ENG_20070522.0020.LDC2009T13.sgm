</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  May 22 (CNA) 05/22/07  16:52:38 (By Luis Huang)

A strategic conference on Taiwan's bid to join the United Nations
will be held in a few days, an official with the Ministry of
Foreign Affairs (MOFA) announced at a news conference Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Lin Yung-le,  director-general of the MOFA's Department of
International Organization,  said that officials from relevant
government agencies will attend the meeting to hammer out
strategies aimed at promoting Taiwan's efforts to join the U.N.
family.
</P>
<P>
According to Lin, the foreign ministry will go all out to drum up
diplomatic allies' support for the nation's U.N. bid through
various channels.
</P>
<P>
Following Taiwan's first attempt to apply to join the World
Health Organization (WHO) as a full member under the name of
"Taiwan" in mid-May, President Chen Shui-bian publicly stated
that his administration will also bid for U.N. membership under
the name of "Taiwan."
</P>
<P>
Lin told reporters the experience that the government obtained in
promoting Taiwan's WHO bid this month can serve as an important
reference for the foreign ministry in pushing for the nation's
accession to the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
Last year, Taiwan campaigned on the theme of "UN-FAIR, " and the
U.N. turned out to be "unfair" to Taiwan by not just refusing to
discuss Taiwan's representation in the organization but also
cutting short the time its diplomatic allies had to speak in
support of it.
</P>
<P>
The Republic of China on Taiwan gave up its U.N. membership in
1971 when the China seat was given to the communist regime in
Beijing under a resolution adopted by the U.N. General Assembly.
</P>
<P>
Since 1993, Taiwan has been calling for international attention
to its plight and asking its allies to push for U.N. recognition
of Taiwan. This year's campaign will be Taiwan's 15th attempt to
gain U.N. membership. All of its previous attempts have failed
because of China's obstruction.
