Taipei, May 22 (CNA) 05/22/07  13:37:02 (By Lilian Wu)

<P>
The first batch of 2,000 "jumbo" pottery jars of 30-liter Kinmen
kaoliang -- the fiery liquor distilled from sorghum on the
outlying island of Kinmen -- sold out in just one morning
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Even before the distribution center of the county-run Kinmen
Kaoliang Liquor Inc. opened its doors for business at 8 a.m.,
more than 500 people had already queued up to buy the liquor.
Each person was limited to buying just one jar, which sells for
NT$21,000 (US$630).
</P>
<P>
The company promised three-year free storage in miliary tunnels
bored into a mountain that have been turned into cellars, as well
as other souvenirs to mark the inauguration of its largest-size
kaoliang product to date.
</P>
<P>
After the three-year storage period expires, the buyer can also
receive a cellar certificate, the company said.
</P>
<P>
Teng Chih-cheng, a 52-year-old man, was the first who received a
cellar storage coupon from the company's president, Wang Yi-ming.
</P>
<P>
Teng, who came to the distribution center at 9 p.m. Monday with
mosquito repellent incense, said he was happy to be the first one
to obtain the coupon, although he had to battle with the
onslaught of mosquitos for the whole night.
</P>
<P>
The others also said that the longer Kinmen kaoliang is stored,
the more fragrant and valuable it becomes, and they plan to open
their jars of kaoliang on a propitious day to share with their
families.
</P>
<P>
Wang expressed appreciation for the enthusiastic response of the
public, adding that the second batch will be unveiled at the end
of the year, although the number will not exceed the 2,000 jars
in the first batch.
</P>
<P>
He said that there is more than enough space for the free storage
service because the company can use three military tunnels on the
island, and some sections of the tunnels can be sealed for
kaoliang storage from 10 years to up to 100 years.
