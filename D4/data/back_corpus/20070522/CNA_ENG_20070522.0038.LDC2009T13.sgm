TOO EARLY TO CARRY OUT BICYCLE ID POLICY: NPA
</HEADLINE>

Taipei, May 22 (CNA) 05/22/07  21:40:16 (By Elizabeth Hsu)

<P>
It is too early to implement a proposal to have bicycles marked
with identification numbers in an effort to deter theft, a
National Police Agency (NPA) official said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Legislative Committee of Transportation passed a draft
amendment to the statute governing road traffic Monday under
which bicycles  will  fall  under the government's  "management
on transportation tools, " which will require the NPA to work out
measures to have all bicycles registered in an attempt to stem
rampant bike theft.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese-language United Daily News claimed that day that the
NPA has decided to carry out the measure and is asking bike
sellers to file personal information on buyers.
</P>
<P>
However,  Ho Kuo-jung,  head  of the NPA's  transportation
department, dismissed the false report, pointing out that the
policy is still no more than a preliminary idea and that the
agency has not yet worked out any measures to carry it out.
</P>
<P>
There are over 10 million bicycles in Taiwan, as well as rampant
bike theft, Ho said.
</P>
<P>
The imprinting practice has proved effective in lowering the
number of motorbike thefts since police began to carry out the
measure this year requiring motorcycles and scooters to have
their component parts marked with vehicle identification numbers,
according to the NPA.
