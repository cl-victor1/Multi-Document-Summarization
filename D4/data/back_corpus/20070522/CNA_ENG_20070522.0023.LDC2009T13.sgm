An "Encyclopedia of Taiwan" project, which seeks to publish the
first encyclopedia about Taiwan and eventually become a
"Taiwanese version" of Encyclopedia  Britannica,  was officially
launched Tuesday, a publisher and the Council of Cultural Affairs
(CCA) announced in a press conference.

The structure of the encyclopedia is expected to be laid out
within the first six months and the first six volumes will be
completed in two years in the first phase of the project, said
Wang Jung-wen, chairman of the YLib Group.

"The compilation of an encyclopedia is a national project. It
will cost billions of dollars and will require huge manpower
resources and great help from academia. Hopefully, we can show
the readers the variety and identity of Taiwan with the
completion of this project," Wang said.

"We wish to use the Korean  edition  of the Encyclopedia
Britannica as an example, as it has the requisite regional
angle," said Iris Du, executive director of the project.
</P>
<P>
Lee Yuan-tseh, a Nobel laureate and former director of Academia
Sinica, has accepted the offer to preside over a committee of
hundreds of professors from universities and institutions that
will oversee the editing of the encyclopedia.

The second stage of the project will be to present a global view
from a Taiwanese perspective as well as to interpret Taiwanese
culture and serve as a platform for the overall knowledge base in
Taiwan, Du said.
