<HEADLINE>
TAIWAN WILL NOT ACCEPT DOWNGRADED MEMBERSHIP IN OIE: MOFA
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taipei,  May  22 (CNA) 05/22/07  18:55:35 (By Elizabeth Hsu)
</P>
<P>
Taiwan will never accept a name that downgrades its membership
status in the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE), a
Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) official in charge of
international organization affairs said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Lin Yung-lo made the statement at a MOFA press conference in
response to media inquires on a CNA report from Geneva that the
OIE Administrative Commission adopted Monday at the OIE
International Committee's 75th general session in Paris a draft
resolution put forward by China with the goal of downgrading
Taiwan's status to that of a "non-sovereign regional member."
</P>
<P>
Lin pointed out that Taiwan is an OIE formal member. If there
must be a change to Taiwan's membership name, Taiwan suggested
the name of "Separate Quarantine Territory of Taiwan, Penghu,
Kinmen and Matsu, " which was proposed in 2003. It is a name
similar to the one Taiwan was forced to use to join the World
Trade Organization (WTO) in 2002.
</P>
<P>
The United States and Japan both support Taiwan's position on the
issue, Lin said.
</P>
<P>
However, he also expressed concern that Taiwan's rights could be
damaged if the OIE International Committee -- the highest
authority of the intergovernment organization headquartered in
Paris -- launches a vote on the draft resolution May 25, the last
day of its current general session, because only 15 of the 168
OIE member nations are diplomatic allies of Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
In the draft resolution, China proposed a change to Taiwan's
membership name from "Taipei China" to "Taiwan, China," a name
Taiwan will never accept because it means Taiwan is subordinate
to China, according to the MOFA.
</P>
<P>
Lin said Taiwan gained accession to the OIE in 1954 under the
name of "Republic of China (Taiwan) , " but was forced to change
the name to "Taipei China" after Beijing was admitted to the
organization in 1992.
</P>
<P>
However, China remains dissatisfied with the alteration. In an
attempt to push the OIE to make further moves to change Taiwan's
membership name, Lin said China has refused not only to
participate in OIE activities, but also to pay its membership
fees.
</P>
<P>
To try to resolve the problem, the OIE International Committee
passed a resolution in 2003 to change Taiwan's membership name
from "Taipei China" into "Separate Quarantine Territory of
Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen and Matsu. "
</P>
<P>
At that time, Taiwan made clear that it would accept the new name
but China refused to accept the resolution and did not take part
in the final vote on the issue, Lin said.
</P>
<P>
Since then, the two sides have been using their membership names
that were chosen in 1992, Lin added.
</P>
<P>
In the draft resolution,  China claims  that the proposed name-
change is intended to restore its legitimate rights at the OIE,
where it gained membership as sovereign state, according to the
MOFA.
</P>
<P>
China claims that Taiwan has taken part in the OIE only as a
"regional member" and says that it can only use the name "Taiwan,
China" in OIE activities, documents and publications.
</P>
<P>
The OIE was founded in 1924 in Paris with the objective of
controlling and preventing animal diseases.
