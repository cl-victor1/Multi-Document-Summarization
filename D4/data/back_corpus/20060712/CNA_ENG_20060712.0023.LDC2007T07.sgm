Taipei,  July 12 (CNA) (By Zep Hu)

<P>
The Center for Disease Control (CDC) under the Department of Health
has established the first National Influenza Center (NIC) to put
respond swiftly to any outbreak of avian influenza, CDC deputy
director Lin Ting said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Lin added that if there should be any suspicious flu cases, the NIC
can conduct speedy examinations and identify the pathogen in less than
24 hours, enabling quick control over the epidemic.
</P>
<P>
Since its establishment in 1979, the CDC has contributed significantly
to local disease surveillance and notification -- especially during
the SARS outbreaks of 2003.
</P>
<P>
Lin said the NIC -- combining the functions of surveillance,
notification and examination -- will be monitoring new flu viruses and
their mutations, providing antibodies against local flu virus strains
and issuing a weekly "Influenza Express" to announce relevant events.
</P>
<P>
Lin said that although Taiwan is still free of highly pathogenic avian
flu, there should still be precautions against a flu pandemic, adding
that the establishment of the NIC is a necessary first step.
