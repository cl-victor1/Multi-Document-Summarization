Police issued more than 23,000 traffic tickets Tuesday on the
second of day of a new crackdown on dangerous and reckless
driving aimed at reducing fatalities on Taiwan's roads, according
to a National Police Agency (NPA) spokesman.

<P>
Quoting NPA tallies, the spokesman said 22,594 traffic tickets
were issued for traffic violations on normal highways around the
country and an additional 492 tickets were issued for violations
on freeways.
</P>
<P>
Taipei County topped the list of traffic violations, followed by
Taipei City and Taoyuan County, the NPA spokesman said, adding
that the three administrative districts accounted for more than
9,600 traffic tickets issued from 4 p.m. Monday through 4 p.m.
Tuesday.

<P>
Police launched the nationwide crackdown on New Year's Day with a
view to alleviating traffic fatalities. As of noon Monday, more
than 15,000 traffic tickets had been issued.
</P>
<P>
The crackdown  focused on six serious  traffic violations,
including running red lights, excessive speeding, driving on hard
shoulders, changing lanes recklessly, drunken driving and heavy-
duty vehicles forcefully overtaking smaller ones.
</P>
<P>
In the past two days, the spokesman said, running red lights
consistently took the largest share of traffic violations,
accounting for 90 percent of all traffic tickets issued.
</P>
<P>
To enhance operational efficiency, police are avoiding adopting a
high profile stance while enforcing traffic rules but instead are
acting in a more low-key manner to penalize dangerous and
reckless drivers.
