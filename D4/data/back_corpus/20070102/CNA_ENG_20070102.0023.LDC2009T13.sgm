The compulsory installation of global positioning system (GPS)
tracking devices on trucks transporting dead pigs is expected to
help prevent 30,000 metric tons of diseased pork from entering
the market every year, an Environmental Protection Administration
(EPA) official said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Since the policy was enforced in June 2006, all 125 licensed
trucks responsible for transporting livestock or poultry
carcasses around the country have completed the installation,
according to the EPA. The measure was adopted to facilitate EPA
monitoring and ensuring the diseased animals are sent to
designated feed-processing plants, in the wake of reports that
unscrupulous traders have been reselling diseased pork to
restaurants and food manufacturers for human consumption.
</P>
<P>
According to Yang Ching-hsi, deputy head of the EPA's Department
of Waste Management, a total of 8,622 metric tons of diseased
pork was sent to feed- processing plants in October and November
last year, up 5,500 metric tons compared to the same period in
2005.
</P>
<P>
Based on this outcome, the measure could prevent at least 30,000
metric tons of diseased pork from getting to the market every
year, Yang said.
</P>
<P>
He said in the future, the GPS devices will be upgraded with an
image transmission function for even better results.
</P>
<P>
Starting in April this year, trucks transporting sewage and
contaminated mud will also be required to install GPS devices, he
said.
