KMT LAWMAKER OPPOSES BIOMETRIC IDENTIFICATION AIMED AT CHINESE
</HEADLINE>

Taipei, Jan. 2 (CNA) 01/02/07  20:46:58 (By Flor Wang)

A lawmaker of the main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) expressed
fierce objection Tuesday to a government plan to use a biometric
identification system aimed at Chinese entering the country,
saying that it will pose a serious infringement on what he
claimed are "universally recognized" human rights.
</P>
<P>
George  Hsieh issued  the condemnation  after the National
Immigration Agency (NIA) , which became operational that same day
after being upgraded from the Bureau of Immigration under the
Ministry of the Interior, announced that it will use German-
developed biometric  data collection  equipment from July at
immigration checkpoints at the country's main gateways.
</P>
<P>
According to the manufacturers, the equipment, worth NT$27
million, is believed to have a successful identification rate of
as high as 97 percent.
</P>
<P>
Arguing that no country in the world has ever used the hi-tech
facilities to single out people from only a single country, Hsieh
demanded that the plan be aborted and said the NIA's plan to
target only people coming into the country from China will
"absolutely violate the basic principles of universally
recognized human rights, " as it would imply that the NIA
presumes that every incoming Chinese national is a criminal.
</P>
<P>
Hsieh said he has already put forward a proposed resolution at
the Legislative Yuan to ask the NIA drop or re-assess the plan
and that it has won endorsement from the KMT's legislative
caucus. He also called for widespread support from the various
political parties for the proposal.
