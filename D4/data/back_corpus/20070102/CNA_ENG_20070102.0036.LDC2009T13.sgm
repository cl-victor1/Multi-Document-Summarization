A 14-member high-level Chinese delegation is scheduled to arrive
in Taiwan Jan. 15 to attend a seminar on cross-Taiwan Strait
economic development outlook at the invitation of the Chung-Hua
Institution for Economic Research (CIER).

According to CIER Chairman Vincent Siew, nine of the Chinese
delegation  members are government  officials,  including Zhang
Xiaoqiang,  vice minister of the State Development and Reform
Commission.

The seminar is aimed at helping the domestic business community
gain a better understanding of China's economic policy evolution
and risks, Siew said.

<P>
As an emerging economy, China is reformulating its economic
policies such as its ongoing 11th five-year economic and social
development plan, so Taiwanese manufacturers should seek to study
the evolution of China's economic situation, Siew said.
