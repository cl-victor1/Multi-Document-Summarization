A Taiwan trade delegation, organized by the quasi-official Taiwan

The International CES is celebrating its 40th anniversary, the

The official said more than 20 special zones have been planned to
display various production technologies, including Bluetooth

According to the official, a Taiwan pavilion will be set up by
