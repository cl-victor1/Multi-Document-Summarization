Premier Su Tseng-chang warned oyster breeders to apply for
licenses to operate in officially designated oyster breeding
areas in order to ensure they are entitled to compensation in the
event of damage to their businesses caused by natural disasters
such as typhoons.
</P>
<P>
Su made the call Tuesday on a visit to oyster breeders operating
along the coast of Chiayi County in southwestern Taiwan which
boasts the country's largest oyster farming business.
</P>
<P>
During the visit, Su was faced with many demands from local
breeders, including central government assistance in accelerating
work to delimit operational zoning on designated oyster farming
waters, which cover 20,000 hectares off Tungshi and Putai
townships, and for reinforced efforts to crack down on oyster
smuggling from China.
</P>
<P>
Chiayi County Magistrate Chen Ming-wen said local oyster breeders
often suffer losses because of devastation from torrential rain
and typhoons but find it difficult to apply for government
compensation because they cannot provide documented proof of
their operations.
</P>
<P>
The problem was never resolved until the central government began
work to delimit operational areas of local oyster breeders in
public waters off Chiayi County last year, Chen said, noting that
45 operational breeding areas have been set up there, with the
first license issued May 30, 2006.
