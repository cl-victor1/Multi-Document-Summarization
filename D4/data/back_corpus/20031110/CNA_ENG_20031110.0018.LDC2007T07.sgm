SARS HOTLINE TO BE REOPENED: HEALTH OFFICIAL
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  Nov. 10 (CNA) (By Maubo Chang)
</P>
<P>
A hotline set up to provide counseling to the public on fighting
severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) during the peak of the
outbreaks earlier this year will be reopened Nov. 15 as part of the
country's efforts to brace for a possible resurfacing of the disease,
a health official said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Chou Chih-hao, deputy director of the Center for Disease Control under
the Department of Health, said the line will be reactivated to answer
the public's questions about SARS, which created havoc on the island
between March and July.
</P>
<P>
In anticipation of the possibility of a resurfacing of the disease
this winter, Chou traveled to Ilan County to drum up public vigilance
against SARS, which claimed the lives of 37 out of 346 probable cases
in Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
With the experience gained earlier this year in fighting SARS, Chou
said the health authorities are better-prepared to combat the disease
should it break out again.
</P>
<P>
As the preliminary signs of SARS look very much like influenza, which
is rampant in winter and usually hits 10 percent of the population,
Chou urged people aged over 65 to get vaccinated against influenza.
</P>
<P>
He urged the public to wash their hands frequently as an easy but
effective way to ward off the virus that causes the disease and to
visit a doctor if they have afflicted with a cough coupled with fever,
which is typical of SARS.
</P>
<P>
He added that SARS patients need not be isolated as long as they don't
develop the fever that is an indication the sufferer is contagious.
