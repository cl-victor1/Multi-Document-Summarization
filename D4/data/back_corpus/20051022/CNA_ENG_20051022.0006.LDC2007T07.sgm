TOO EARLY FOR EXPERTS TO BE SENT TO TAIWAN:  U.S. CDC
</HEADLINE>

Washington, Oct. 21 (CNA) (By J.L. Che and P.C. Tang)

It is still too early to say whether the U.S. Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention (CDC) will send experts to Taiwan to help
prevent the island from being affected by avian influenza, a
spokeswoman of the center said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Christine Pearson made the comments in response to a question raised
by the Central News Agency regarding whether the center will dispatch
experts to Taiwan if the island sees an outbreak of the bird flu.
</P>
<P>
The CDC sent several of its experts to Taiwan during the outbreaks in
2003 of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS).
</P>
<P>
According to the spokeswoman, the CDC has sent its experts to various
disease-affected areas around the world to help prevent further
expansion of disease.
</P>
<P>
Despite the fact that the world is paying much attention to the
possible outbreak of bird flu in Asia, Pearson said that it is
difficult to predict now the situations regarding any future outbreaks
and expansion of bird flu in the region; therefore, it is still
premature to talk about whether the center will send anyone to Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Wild birds are the hosts of the H5N1 virus that transmits the disease.
Although the virus does not typically infect humans, in 1997, however,
the first instance of direct bird-to-human case was documented during
an outbreak of avian influenza among poultry in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
According to the center, from Dec. 30, 2004 to March 17, 2004, 12
confirmed human cases of avian influenza were reported in Thailand and
23 in Vietnam, resulting in 23 deaths.
