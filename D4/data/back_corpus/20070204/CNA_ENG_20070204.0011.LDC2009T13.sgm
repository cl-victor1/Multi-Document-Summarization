Official contacts across the Taiwan Strait in professional fields
have increased over the past year, although these contacts could
not be characterized as "close, " a Mainland Affairs Council
(MAC) official said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The MAC official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said that
over the past year Chinese officials have become more willing to
contact their Taiwanese counterparts on issues in various
specialized or professional fields, instead of insisting on
cross-strait contacts only in strictly private sectors.
</P>
<P>
This  improvement,  he said,  is leading  developments  of cross-
strait relations in a healthier direction and is worthy applause
and encouragement since the effect of exchanges would be, and
have been, limited were cross-strait affairs tackled only via
private channels.
</P>
<P>
The official, however, declined to comment on local daily reports
that Beijing's Taiwan policy and strategy have changed
drastically since Taiwan's ruling Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) won the important mayoral election in Kaohsiung late last
year, or that Chinese authorities have begun to seek improved
relations with the DPP in all aspects and will no longer stake
their approach to cross-strait relations solely on Taiwan's
opposition Kuomintang.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, at a seminar held Saturday, MAC Vice Chairman Tung
Chen-yuan called for Beijing to grasp "golden opportunities" in
the first half of this year to resume cross-strait negotiations
on seven important issues -- ranging from Taiwan's agricultural
exports to China, the establishment of a cross-strait financial
liquidation mechanism, the establishment of a cross-strait
financial supervisory mechanism,  to intellectual property rights
protection,  mutual judicial assistance, cross-strait crime-
fighting and the signing of an investment guarantee pact aimed at
protecting Taiwanese citizens maintaining business operations in
China.
