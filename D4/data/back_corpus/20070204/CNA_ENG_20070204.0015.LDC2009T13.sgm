Taiwan's first Olympic medalist, Yang Chuan-kwang, who died Jan.
28 in his Ventura County, California home at the age of 73, was
buried at Ivy Lawns Memorial Park in that county Saturday after a
brief funeral.

The funeral was held at a local funeral home at 11 a.m, where his
family members were joined by officials from Taiwan's National
Council on Physical Fitness and Sports, the Taipei Economic and
Cultural Office in Los Angeles, the Chinese Taipei Olympic
Committee, and the Democratic Progressive Party's Western America
Chapter.

They sang the Republic of China's (ROC's) national anthem at the
funeral in memory of the athlete who won a silver in the
decathlon at the Rome Olympics in 1960 for the Republic of China.

Chen Chuan-show, former chief of the National Council on Physical
Fitness and Sports, and an official from the Taipei Economic and
Cultural Office in Los Angeles, covered his coffin with a ROC
national flag to mark the great glory Yang brought to his
country.

Notable among the attendants was Rafer Johnson, an American
athlete who undertook training together with Yang at the
University of California Los Angeles in the later 1950s and
defeated Yang to win the gold in the decathlon in Rome in 1960.
He recalled at the funeral his five-decade friendship with Yang,
which has become a legend among athletes.

Yang died of brain hemorrhage. He is survived by his wife, Daisy
Chou and two sons, Cedric Yang and C.K. Yang Jr.

Daisy Chou and C.K. Yang Jr. will attend a memorial service for

medal the Taiwanese decathlete won will be put on display.
