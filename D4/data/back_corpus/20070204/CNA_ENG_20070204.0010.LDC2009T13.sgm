New York,  Feb.  3 (CNA) 02/04/07  16:38:38 (By Lillian Lin and

<P>
Taiwan will donate funds for two health promotion projects in
Burkina Faso, one of its diplomatic allies in Africa, a spokesman
for the Taipei Economic and Cultural Office (TECO) in New York
said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The two projects -- a trachoma prevention plan and a cooking oil
plan -- are jointly organized by the New York-based Helen Keller
International (HKI), the United Nations Children's Fund and the
World Health Organization, the spokesman said, adding that the
HKI will implement the two programs using funds donated by
Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Andrew L. Y. Hsia, head of the TECO, will provide the funds to
HKI President Kathy Spahn on behalf of Taiwan's government during
a reception to be held at the TECO office in Manhattan next
Wednesday, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The funds will include US$103,940 for the trachoma prevention
project, the spokesman said, adding that this donation represents
the final installment in a three-year project that began in late
2004.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan has donated more than US$375,000 to the project aimed at
combating trachoma in Burkina Faso's Komandjari area by planting
vegetables and fruits to boost local residents' vitamin A intake,
improving medical facilities and promoting hygiene and good
sanitary habits among school children.
</P>
<P>
Trachoma is a highly infectious disease of eyes that is caused by
bacteria and is the second largest cause of blindness in Africa
and Asia.
</P>
<P>
Encouraged by the success of the trachoma prevention project, the
spokesman said, Taiwan has decided to sponsor a cooking oil
project in Burkina Faso from 2007. The project, which focuses on
adding vitamin A to cooking oil to reduce the risks of mothers
and young children dying from malnutrition, will also be
implemented over three years at an estimated cost of US$300,000.
Taiwan will foot the bill, with the first-year donation set at
US$128,952.
</P>
<P>
The Helen Keller International (HKI) combats the causes and
consequences of blindness and malnutrition by establishing
programs based on research on vision, health and nutrition.
</P>
<P>
Founded in 1915 by Helen Adams Keller and George Kessler, the
organization's mission is to save the sight and lives of the most
vulnerable and disadvantaged.
</P>
<P>
Keller was a deaf-blind American author, activist and lecturer.
The woman, from the small farm town of Tuscumbia, Alabama taught
the world to respect people who are blind and deaf with her
outstanding career achievements and dedicated services to the
disadvantaged.
