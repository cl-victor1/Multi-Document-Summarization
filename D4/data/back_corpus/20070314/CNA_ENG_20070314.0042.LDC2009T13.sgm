VP PROMOTES TAIWAN AS REGIONAL FINANCIAL CENTER

Taipei,  March  14 (CNA) 03/14/07  22:02:45 (By Ruth Wang)

Vice President Annette Lu urged the government and opposition
party Wednesday to cooperate in promoting Taiwan as aregional
financial center.
</P>
<P>
Lu made the call while attending the Standard &amp; Poor's Fund
Awards presentation ceremony.
</P>
<P>
Lu pointed out in her speech that Hu Sheng-cheng, chairman of
Council for Economic Planning and Development, in 2004 proposed
five strategies, including the promotion of asset management and
developing diversified financial services, to transform Taiwan
into a regional financial center.
</P>
<P>
That proposal aimed to reach several goals by 2008: increasing
the rate of financial services industry's output in gross
domestic product (GDP) to 13 percent, having one to three local
banks stand as outstanding regional financial institutes, and
making financial institutes' total assets grow by more than 30
percent.
</P>
<P>
Lu said it is a pity that this proposal did not work out because
the Legislative Yuan brought a halt to the government's "second
financial reform" policy in 2005. She added that Taiwan should
recognize that the World Economic Forum has changed its
evaluation criteria to focus on countries' financial services --
an area in which Taiwan has yet to demonstrate significant
improvement.
