ANTI-SECESSION LAW LEADS EU TO FACE CHINESE THREATS TO TAIWAN:
PUNDIT

China's enactment two years ago of its so-called Anti-Secession
Law targeting Taiwan has led members of the European Union to
sense the seriousness of the Chinese military threat against
Taiwan, a British scholar said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Christopher Hughes, a senior lecturer in international relations
at the London School of Economics and Political Science, said at
a colloquium that before China enacted the Anti-Secession Law,
many EU countries  had actively  sought closer ties with Beijing
in anticipation of significant benefits from China's huge market.
</P>
<P>
But after China enacted the law March 14, 2005 -- which
authorizes Beijing to use non-peaceful means against Taiwan if it
moves toward formal independence -- the EU members realized that
China might deal with Taiwan by force and could be a real
security threat, according to Huges. This has caused the EU
members to view China in a negative light, he said.
</P>
<P>
Hughes, who speaks fluent mandarin Chinese and who has visited
Taiwan many times, said that after China enacted the Anti-
Secession Law, there has been much debate among EU officials on
the impact of the "rise of China" and on whether the European
Union should lift its arms embargo against China or not.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Dafydd Fell, deputy director of the Taiwan Studies
Programme at the School of Oriental and African Studies,
University of London, who also spoke at the colloquium, said that
the contents of the Anti-Secession Law offer nothing new, except
providing legitimacy for China's military moves against Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Fell said, the enactment of the Anti-Secession Law
has proved to be a "failed" policy that has only earned Beijing
infamy and criticism from the international community.
</P>
<P>
Former ruling Democratic Progressive  Party Legislator  Lin Cho-
shui, who has traveled from Taiwan to London for the colloquium
sponsored by the UK Chapter of the Taiwan-based Global Alliance
for Democracy and Peace and several other pro- Taiwan
organizations, said that since China passed the Anti-Secession
Law, Beijing has turned "harder" in its intimidating strategy
toward Taiwan while becoming "softer" in its overtures toward the
people of Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Lin noted, however, that China's enactment of the Anti-Secession
Law has backfired -- underlined by fact that the United States
and Japan have agreed to expand their regional security concerns
to wider areas to include Taiwan, while the European Union has
decided to prolong its arms embargo against China -- which he
said proves that the international community has shifted its
target of "imaginary enemy" from Moscow to Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Lin said that although the current cross-Taiwan Strait situation
is not "tense" enough to cause Beijing to put its Anti-Secession
Law into actual force, China has continued to increase its
military spending by at least 10 percent every year.
</P>
<P>
Other participants in the colloquium, including representatives
from Taiwanese communities around the United Kingdom, urged
Beijing on the eve of the second anniversary of the enactment of
the Anti-Secession Law to scrap the law immediately as it has
hurt the feelings of the Taiwan people and hindered the positive
development of cross-strait relations.
</P>
<P>
They condemned China's intimidation of the Taiwan people through
its aiming of ballistic missiles at the island, with the number
of missiles increasing from 784 last year to some 988 at present.
</P>
<P>
They stressed that Taiwan is an independent and sovereign country
which has never been a part of China and that Taiwan's future
should be decided by the Taiwan people.
</P>
<P>
They said the enactment of the Anti-Secession Law has created an
excuse for China to use force against the peace-loving people of
Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
The law has not only legitimized China's military threat against
Taiwan, it has also undermined peace and security in the entire
East Asia region, they argued.
