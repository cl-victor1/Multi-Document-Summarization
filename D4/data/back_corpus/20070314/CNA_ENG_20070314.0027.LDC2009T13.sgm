PRESIDENT ISSUES `ONE CALL, TWO REQUIREMENTS'

Taipei,  March 14 (CNA) 03/14/07  19:34:27 (By Flor Wang)

President Chen Shui-bian issued what he described as "one call,
two requirements" Wednesday regarding the Beijing regime on the
second anniversary of the enactment of its so-called Anti-
Secession Law against Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Stating  in an online newspaper  issued  that day by the
Presidential Office, Chen urged all the countries in the world,
as well as the European Union, not to export any weapons to China
before Beijing has substantially improved its human rights
records and implemented democratic reforms.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Chen said, China should follow Taiwan's lead of
making its military politically neutral by not requiring People's
Liberation Army personnel to be members of the Communist Party of
China.
</P>
<P>
China should also legalize the establishment of genuine and
capable opposition parties and hold at least two fair, impartial
and open elections that allow opposition parties to take part on
an equal footing, Chen said.
</P>
<P>
Only when China has substantially evolved in these two areas can
Taiwan begin to consider two-way cooperation, Chen said.
</P>
<P>
Describing Beijing's Anti-Secession Law as a "spiritual shackle"
imposed on Taiwan's people, Chen said, however, that a growing
divide on Taiwan's national identification will seriously hinder
Taiwan's defense capabilities and lead to a deterioration in the
cross-Taiwan Strait situation.
</P>
<P>
"This is a fact that we must face up to and endeavor to
overcome," the president urged.
</P>
<P>
The Anti-Secession Law, which provides Beijing with a legal basis
to use non- peaceful means against Taiwan, basically represents a
denial of the universal principles of freedom, democracy, human
rights and peace and reflects an old- fashioned mindset of
hegemony, he said, arguing that the law is just Beijing's attempt
to flex its muscle toward Taiwan and other neighboring countries.
</P>
<P>
In the face of China's constant threats, it is deplorable that
some people opt to overlook Beijing's ambition to swallow up
Taiwan due to their "greater China" mindsets at a time when China
is still increasing the number of its missiles pointing at
Taiwan, he said.
