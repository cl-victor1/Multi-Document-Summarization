The Kaohsiung city government's decision to remove and relocate a
statue of the late President Chiang Kai-shek at the municipal
cultural center was aimed only at having the facility serve its
original purpose, ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)
lawmakers said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
DPP lawmakers Wang Shu-hui and Lin Shu-shan made the comments at
a Legislative Yuan news conference  after the Kaohsiung city
government acted the previous night to dismantle the huge statue
and remove the center's original name plague.
</P>
<P>
About a dozen lawmakers and city councilors of the opposition
"pan-blue alliance" of the Kuomintang and the People First Party
rushed to the site and voiced their concern over the issue, but
were forced by a large police presence to leave the area. More
than 1,000 policemen were mobilized to ensure a smooth
dismantling on the site.

The removal of the statue is entirely aimed at helping the center
free itself from lingering authoritarian elements and better
serve its purpose as a cultural establishment, Lin argued. "No
dictator's ghost should be allowed to continue haunting a
democratic society, " he said.
</P>
<P>
It is within the rights of the Kaohsiung city government and its
citizens to demand that the center only serves cultural
activities, Wang said, adding that she will propose at the
Legislative Yuan that all of Chiang's statues be removed from
college and high school campuses around the country.

<P>
The dismantled parts of the Chiang's statue will be transported
to and kept at Tahsi township in northern Taoyuan county, where a
mausoleum of the late president is located.
