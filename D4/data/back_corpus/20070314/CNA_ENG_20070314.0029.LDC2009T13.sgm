A medical researcher at the Taoyuan-based Chang Gung Children's
Hospital suggested Wednesday that parents whose babies have sleep
problems should help their children to develop good sleep habits
while refraining from comforting babies or feeding them when they
awake crying.

Assistant Professor Chou Yi-hung made the remarks while speaking
of his conclusions on a survey he conducted among 506 mothers of
children aged from newborn to six months in the hospital's well-
baby clinic from January 2004 to July 2005 to investigate parent-
reported sleep problems in infants and young children.

<P>
Chou concluded that sleep problems among infants and young
children are very common in northern Taiwan. The survey was
published in the January  issue  of Sleep  and Biological
Rhythm,  an English-language journal of the Japanese Society of
Sleep Research.

Chou said his research team has found night waking and difficulty
falling asleep are the two major sleep problems of infants and
young children involved in the investigation. Excluding the
disease factor, they found that nearly 40 percent of the children
have the problem of frequent night waking, while more than 70
percent take 30 minutes or longer to fall asleep.

<P>
In addition, illness interfering with sleep at night was observed
in 35 percent of the young children, according to the survey,
with a revelation that problems are prevalent in the going-to-bed
schedule, night waking and daytime sleepiness.
</P>
<P>
Chou suggested that parents let their babies sleep in their own
beds and set fixed sleep times to create a safe environment for
their children to fall asleep.
