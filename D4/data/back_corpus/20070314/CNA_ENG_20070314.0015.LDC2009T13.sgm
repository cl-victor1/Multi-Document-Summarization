CENTRAL BANK WON'T BE RELOCATED SOUTH: GOVERNOR

Taipei,  March 14 (CNA) 03/14/07  14:48:52 (By Deborah Kuo)

The Central Bank of China (CBC) will not relocate its
headquarters from Taipei City to southern Taiwan amid calls for
relocation of public agencies away from Taiwan's capital aimed at
balancing regional development, CBC Governor Perng Fai-nan said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Fielding questions at the Legislative Yuan, Perng said that based
on his judgement and based on the fact that Taipei is the
country's financial center, there is zero probability that the
administration would ask the CBC to relocate to Kaohsiung, which
is a port city and the largest city in southern Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Perng said he doesn't believe that either President  Chen Shui-
bian or Premier Su Tseng-chang would request that the CBC move to
the south, adding that neither of them has made such a proposal.
</P>
<P>
Perng made the remarks in response to a question raised by
opposition Kuomintang Legislator Lai Shyh-bao, who asked whether
Chen or Su has asked Perng for talks on the feasibility of the
CBC relocating south.
</P>
<P>
The Council for Economic Planning and Development (CEPD) said
Tuesday that the government  should study the feasibility  of
relocating more public agencies away from Taipei in order to
facilitate localization and "multinucleus urban regeneration."
</P>
<P>
The CEPD officials' call was made after President Chen Shui-bian
said recently that the country should consider relocating several
Cabinet-level agencies, including the Council of Agriculture and
the Council of Labor Affairs,  to the south before talking about
relocating the capital city there.
</P>
<P>
In addition to relocating the Council of Agriculture and the
Fisheries Administration  to central or southern Taiwan,  CEPD
officials said several other agencies, such as the Tourism Bureau
under the Ministry of Transportation and Communications, the
Bureau of Mines under the Ministry of Economic Affairs, the
Council of Labor Affairs, and the Council for Hakka Affairs, are
also suitable for relocation southward.
</P>
<P>
The Council of Agriculture  is preparing  to relocate its
headquarters from Taipei to southern Taiwan in line with the
government's policy of bolstering fishery development in the
country.
</P>
<P>
Fisheries  Administration  Director  Hsieh Dah-wen said the
relocation move will be made upon receiving instructions from the
Executive Yuan.
