Taipei,   Sept.   28   (CNA) (By Victor Lai)
</P>
<P>
Republic of China Premier Chang Chun-hsiung said Friday that he
approved the resignation of Vice Minister of Transportation and
Communications Ho Cheng-tan because Ho insisted on leaving the post.
</P>
<P>
Chang made the remarks while answering a question raised by Kuomintang
legislator Chen Hsueh-sheng who questioned the timing of Ho's
resignation.
</P>
<P>
The premier said that he affirmed Ho's ability and performance, but as
Ho insisted on quitting -- citing personal reasons -- he reluctantly
approved Ho's resignation Friday morning.
</P>
<P>
Chang noted that he had hoped Ho would have stayed on until the
resignation of the Cabinet en masse after the Dec. 1 legislative
elections, but he had to respect Ho's intention.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, MOTC Minister Yeh Chu-lan denied speculation that her
"disharmony" with Ho was the reason that Ho wanted to resign.
</P>
<P>
She said that Ho agreed to serve as vice minister for only one year
when he joined the government team in May last year, and added that he
presented his resignation in May and August despite her efforts to
retain him.
</P>
<P>
Ho's post has been filled by Lin Ling-san, vice chairman of the Public
Construction Commission under the Executive Yuan.
