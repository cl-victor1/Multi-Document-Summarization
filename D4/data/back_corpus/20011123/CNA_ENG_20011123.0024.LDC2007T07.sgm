Margarete Steiff GmbH, a German company noted for producing teddy
bears, announced Thursday that it will market 1,500 Chinese-style "Lu"
teddy bears in Taiwan from late this year through early next year.

The German company's marketing of the specially made teddy bears is in
celebration of the 100th anniversary of the widely known toy.

"Lu" means wealth in Chinese.

Chou Mei-wen, an executive of Cherng Yaw Corp., local agent of the
German company, said the price for each "Lu" teddy bear will be
NT$9,900 (US$286.95).

Jean Lafitte, Margarete Steiff GmbH's manager in charge of overseas
marketing, is presently in Taipei to help promote the marketing of the
"Lu" teddy bears which he said will be sold only in Taiwan.

Besides the "Lu" teddy bears, Cherng Yaw Corp. also plans to market
another two Chinese-style teddy bears -- the "Fu" (felicity) and the
"Shou" (longevity) teddy bears in 2002 and 2003, Chou said.
