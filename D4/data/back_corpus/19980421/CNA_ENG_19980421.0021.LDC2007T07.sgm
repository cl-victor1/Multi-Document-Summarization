MACAU FEELS IMPACT OF REGIONAL CRISIS

Bangkok,  April 21 (CNA) (By Kuo Fang-chih)

<P>
Macau is currently experiencing a period of economic difficulties
exacerbated by the regional economic and financial crisis, said Vitor
Rodrigues Pessoa, Macau's secretary of economic coordination.
</P>
<P>
Pessoa told the some 100 delegates at the second day of the 54th
meeting of the United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia
and the Pacific that "these difficulties have been particularly
noticeable in the tourism sector, now the territory's main activity
sector, as reflected in the drop in the number of visitors ... last
year."
</P>
<P>
The Asian financial crisis, however, has not affected the stability of
the local currency, Pessoa said.
</P>
<P>
"Given its peg to the Hong Kong dollar, it appreciated considerably in
relation to other currencies in the region," he noted.
</P>
<P>
But Macau's exports have been affected by the strength of its
currency. "In terms of the manufacturing sector -- which is almost
entirely geared toward exports given the small level of domestic
demand -- the competitiveness of the territory's products in the world
markets has been clearly affected," he said.
</P>
<P>
The official said despite growth of around 8 percent in value in 1997,
a slackening in exports is expected this year.
</P>
<P>
Macau is scheduled to end over four centuries of Portuguese rule and
become a Special Administrative Region of mainland China on Dec. 20,
1999.
</P>
<P>
Beijing has pledged to allow Macau to retain its economic, social,
executive, legislative and judicial systems for at least 50 years.
