CONSULTATION BETTER THAN PRIMARY TO SELECT DPP'S 2008 CANDIDATE:
VP
</HEADLINE>

Kaohsiung, Jan. 7 (CNA) 01/07/07  21:07:39 (By Sofia Wu)

Vice President Annette Lu said Sunday she believes that the
ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) would be better off
holding internal consultation instead of a primary to select the
party's 2008 presidential candidate.
</P>
<P>
Lu was responding to a press query about her view on the DPP's
plan to hold a primary later this year to select the party's 2008
presidential candidate.
</P>
<P>
In her view, Lu said the party should hold internal consultation
rather than a primary to determine its candidate for the next
presidential election because holding a primary tends to hurt
camaraderie and hobble intraparty unity.
</P>
<P>
As to reports that some prominent pro-independence activists have
ruled out support for Lu to run the 2008 presidency, Lu said
since she has never expressed any intention to join the next
presidential race, it's nonsense to talk about "ruling her out of
the hopefuls list."
</P>
<P>
Lu made the remarks after autographing copies of the Chinese
edition of her biography at a bookstore in the southern port city
of Kaohsiung. The book, titled "Daughter of the World," was
authored by Yoo Lin-soo, a noted South Korean scriptwriter, on
Lu's life story.
</P>
<P>
While autographing her biography, some of her fans urged Lu to
seriously consider running for the presidency. But Lu said "as of
today, I have no intention of joining the race."
</P>
<P>
During a ceremony marking the launch of the book in Taipei last
month, Lu said an increase in the number of female presidential
candidates will definitely develop into a significant trend.
</P>
<P>
Lu said feminists have evolved from "pursuing women's rights"
into "pursuing sharing of responsibility." According to Lu,
women's rights activists want to share responsibility rather than
seeking rights or power. Claiming that men are more belligerent
than women, Lu said she is convinced  that letting  women  to
serve  as commander-in-chief of a country's armed forces, war
would either be completely averted or minimized.
</P>
<P>
Lu also said at that occasion that the publishing of her
biography has nothing to do with any political election.
</P>
<P>
Lu said what she wants to remind the public is that men can no
longer unilaterally or solely determine the mainstream values of
the 21st century.
