CHINESE BANK RESUMES ATM WITHDRAWAL, TRANSFER SERVICES: FSC
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  Jan. 7 (CNA) 01/07/07  18:59:44 (By Y.L.Kao)
</P>
<P>
Automated teller machines (ATM) for Taipei- based Chinese Bank
have resumed inter-bank money withdrawal and transfer services
starting 7 a.m. Sunday, according to Financial Supervisory
Commission (FSC) Vice Chairwoman Susan Chang.
</P>
<P>
The FSC announced late Friday that Central Deposit Insurance
Corp. (CDIC) would be taking over Chinese Bank -- a member of the
Rebar Asia Pacific Group -- beginning midnight Saturday, in the
wake of a bank run sparked by the insolvency of the group's two
member firms, China Rebar Co and Chia Hsin Food &amp; Synthetic
Fiber Co.
</P>
<P>
Some clients of the cash-strapped bank complained that they have
been unable to withdraw funds despite the FSC's assurance that
inter-bank withdrawals and transfer services by other banks' ATMs
were operating as usual.
</P>
<P>
Chang said this could not occur theoretically, since the ATM
system is a data- processing system linking computer facilities
of financial institutions to those of the country's central bank
on a 24-hour basis, and is a system designed for the real-time
transfer of funds across the institutions' deposit reserve
accounts at the central bank.
</P>
<P>
But, she added that if clients complain they are still unable to
withdraw their money, the FSC will deal with such extraordinary
situations on a case-by-case basis.
