THOSE RESPONSIBLE FOR BANK RUN TO BE DEALT WITH HARSHLY: PREMIER
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  Jan.  7 (CNA) 01/07/07  15:51:28 (By Deborah Kuo)

<P>
Premier Su Tseng-chang said Sunday that those who have caused a
bank run crisis involving the Chinese Bank under the Rebar Asia
Pacific Group will be dealt with harshly.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the Executive Yuan before departing for southern
Taiwan for an inspection tour, Su said the Central Deposit
Insurance Corp. (CDIC) has been instructed by the Financial
Supervisory Commission (FSC) to take over the Chinese Bank -- a
member of the Rebar Asia Pacific Group -- in the wake of a bank
run triggered by the insolvency of two other companies under the
group.
</P>
<P>
FSC tallies show that clients withdrew a total of NT$15 billion
(US$462 million) from the bank Friday -- the first day of the
bank run crisis.
</P>
<P>
Su assured the public the government has stepped in to take care
of the crisis to ensure that not a dollar of clients' money will
be affected. He urged the public to stop withdrawing their
deposits from the Chinese Bank, stressing that their savings are
secure now that the government has taken over the bank.
</P>
<P>
Su noted, meanwhile, that those who might be involved in the
incident -- including people in charge of the Chinese Bank and
executive and management members of the Rebar Group -- will be
dealt with squarely and harshly, including freezing their assets
and restricting them from leaving the country.
</P>
<P>
Following an emergency meeting held Saturday, officials from the
FSC, the Ministry of Finance and the Central Bank of China
(Taiwan), met again Sunday over the incident.
</P>
<P>
During a news conference held on the issue Saturday, FSC Chairman
Shih Jun-ji said the Chinese Bank is no longer a member of the
Rebar Group and has become a national bank, with all deposits of
clients enjoying unlimited protection from the government.
</P>
<P>
Shih said the bank's business will not be affected because the
CDIC has prepared more than NT$20 billion in cash to cope with
the needs of the bank's operations when it reopens Monday.
</P>
<P>
Claiming that Taiwan's financial system is very healthy with the
average overdue loan ratio of domestic financial institutions
having dropped to 2.35 percent, Shih said it is unlikely that any
large-scale financial crisis will occur in the country.
