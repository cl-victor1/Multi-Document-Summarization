REBAR'S CASE FOR BANKRUPTCY PROTECTION ENTERS JUDICIAL PROCESS
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taipei, Jan. 7 (CNA) 01/07/07  19:33:21 (By Deborah Kuo)
</P>
<P>
A case involving bankruptcy protection filed by two companies
under the Rebar Asia Pacific Group has entered judicial
proceedings, and final decisions will be made by the Taipei
District Court, the head of the Financial Supervisory Commission
(FSC) said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
At a news conference held at the Government Information Office on
the issue -- which has caused a bank run involving the Chinese
Bank, another business operation of the Rebar Group -- FSC
Chairman Shih Jun-ji said that participants of two consecutive
meetings held on this concern since Saturday have not discussed
whether or how the government would move to financially bail out
the two Rebar companies.
</P>
<P>
Shih said the FSC has collected relevant information and reports
on allegedly illegal conduct by the Rebar Group -- which also
include Great Chinese Bills and Finance Co. -- and has referred
them to investigators and prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
Soon after China Rebar Co. and Chia Hsin Food and Synthetic Fiber
Co. filed for bankruptcy protection Friday, bank runs have
erupted at branches of the Chinese Bank over worries about the
insolvency of the two Rebar companies.
</P>
<P>
On later Friday, the FSC instructed the Central Deposit Insurance
Corp. (CDIC) to take over the Chinese Bank in the wake of the
bank run crisis.
</P>
<P>
FSC tallies show that clients withdrew a total of NT$15 billion
(US$462 million) from the bank Friday -- the first day of the
bank run crisis.
</P>
<P>
Shih said the FSC has also decided that Great Chinese Bills
Finance Co. will be jointly taken over by Taiwan Cooperative Bank
and Cathay United Bank.
</P>
<P>
Shih said Saturday that Chinese Bank's business will be
unaffected because the CDIC has prepared more than NT$20 billion
in cash to cope with the bank's operation needs Monday when it
reopens.
</P>
<P>
Claiming that Taiwan's financial system is very healthy with the
average overdue loan ratio of domestic financial institutions
having dropped to 2.35 percent, Shih said it is unlikely that any
large-scale financial crisis will occur in the country.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Perng Fai-nan, governor of Taiwan's Central Bank of
China, urged the clients of the Chinese Bank at Sunday's news
conference to refrain from the bank run and not to rashly sever
their time deposit contracts with the Chinese Bank.
</P>
<P>
Since the government has stepped in to ensure that not a dollar
of clients' savings will be affected and the Central Bank of
China is preparing over NT$10 billion to meet the clients' panic
withdrawing, Perng said it is unnecessary for clients to seek to
sever their time deposit contracts with the Chinese Bank, a move
which would lead them to lose already-earned interest.
