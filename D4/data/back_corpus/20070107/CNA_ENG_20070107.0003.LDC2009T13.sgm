Former President Lee Teng-hui wants to tour Japan this year if
his health allows him to do so, Japan's news agency Jiji Press
quoted Lee as saying in Taipei Saturday.

<P>
In an interview with Jiji, the former president who canceled a
trip to Japan in May last year because of his health was cited as
saying that he would like to visit the northeastern part of Japan
which is known for its pristine beauty thanks to a book written
by a 17th Century Japanese poet Matuwo Baseu.

<P>
Lee who had visited Japan in 2001 and 2004 after he stepped down
from presidency in 2000 is an outspoken critic of China and has
never set foot on Japan without drawing Beijing's protest to
Tokyo.
