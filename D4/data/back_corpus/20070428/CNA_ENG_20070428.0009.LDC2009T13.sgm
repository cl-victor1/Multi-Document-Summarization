U.N. BID UNDER NAME OF TAIWAN `DIFFICULT': EX-FOREIGN MINISTER
</HEADLINE>

Taiwan's bid to apply to join the United Nations under the name
of "Taiwan" involves great difficulty, a former Republic of China
minister of foreign affairs said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the issue during a conference titled "Taiwan and Its
Contexts" held at Yale University, Fredrick Chien said the ROC
has been "unfairly and unreasonably"  ignored by the
international community since its seat at the United Nations was
replaced by the People's Republic of China in 1971.
</P>
<P>
While promoting a campaign to re-enter the United Nations over
the past 14 years, Taiwan has not tried to challenge Beijing's
representation  at the United Nations but has emphasized  the
"unfairness" of the world organization excluding Taiwan, Chien
said.
</P>
<P>
According to Chien, "it will be a very difficult matter" if
Taiwan is to apply for U.N. membership under the name of "Taiwan"
because Taiwan must be a "new country" in order to enter the
United Nations as a new member, which brings up the issue of
declaring independence.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Chien pointed out, any application for new U.N.
membership is required to obtain the unanimous consent of the
five permanent members of the U.N. Security Council -- one of
which is China.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, "there will be a very big problem" if Taiwan is to
apply to join the United Nations under the name of "Taiwan" this
September, he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, analyzing the democratic development of Taiwan at the
conference, Chu Yun-han, a professor of political science at
National Taiwan University, said the problems of partisan
struggle and split national identity in Taiwan are not expected
to be resolved in the near future.
</P>
<P>
While the people hinged high expectations on President Chen Shui-
bian when he was elected in 2000 and again in 2004, the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) has failed to obtain a
majority status in the Legislative Yuan in the past two
legislative elections, Chu noted.
</P>
<P>
Despite this fact, the DPP has refused to relinquish the right to
appoint the premier, resulting in a continuation of confrontation
between the ruling and opposition camps, Chu said.
