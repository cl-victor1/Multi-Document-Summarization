MAC REBUTS BEIJING'S ACCUSATION ABOUT OLYMPIC TORCH CONSENSUS
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  April 28 (CNA) 04/28/07  13:33:25 (By Sofia Wu)

Taiwan's refusal to be included in the Beijing-proposed route for
next year's Olympic torch relay is an issue of "sovereignty" and
"respect" rather than of "credibility or routing," a senior
official said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Mainland Affairs Council Vice Chairman Liu Te-hsun made the
remarks after Beijing Organizing Committee for the 2008 Olympic
Games (BOCOG) Vice President Jiang Xiaoyu accused Taiwan the day
before of "breach of commitment" by reneging on a previous
agreement to host a leg of next year's Olympic torch relay.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said he was surprised at Taiwan's snub of China's proposal
that the Olympic flame would arrive in Taipei from Ho Chi Minh
City, Vietnam before heading to China-controlled Hong Kong and
Macau.
</P>
<P>
Jiang claimed that the BOCOG had been discussing the relay issue
with Taiwan sports officials since November and received a letter
detailing Taipei's agreement to the route March 27.
</P>
<P>
However, Liu rebutted Jiang's claim by elaborating on the
negotiation process over the torch relay.
</P>
<P>
Liu said that on Feb. 12, Taiwan's Chinese Taipei Olympic
Committee (CTOC) Chairman Thomas W. Tsai traveled to Beijing to
meet with his Chinese counterpart and was given a briefing on the
torch relay route. Tsai was told that the Olympic torch would be
entering Taipei from Vietnam before leaving for Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Tsai presented Beijing's proposal to the government authorities,
and on March 27, Tsai sent a letter to BOCOG saying the CTOC
would not object to the plan as long as China refrains from using
it to belittle Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Over the past month, Liu claimed, Beijing has changed its tune.
"We have discovered that China started spreading propaganda
claiming that Taiwan would be the Olympic torch's first leg on
the `interior route.' Worse still, China has typically referred
to Taiwan as `Taipei, China' instead of using its formal
designation in the International Olympic Committee (IOC) of
`Chinese Taipei, '" he added.
</P>
<P>
According to Liu, Olympic committees on both sides of the Taiwan
Strait reached a consensus in 1989 that Taiwan should be
addressed as "Chinese Taipei" when it takes part in IOC-sponsored
competitions and activities in China.
</P>
<P>
Regrettably, Liu said, Chinese officials and media personalities
have not observed  that accord while talking  about the 2008
Olympics-related activities.
</P>
<P>
Against this backdrop, Liu said, the CTOC sent a letter to
Beijing again April 20 protesting its abuse of the torch relay
route for political manipulation and stressing that Taiwan could
not accept China's attempt to downgrade its sovereign status.
</P>
<P>
To avoid a situation in which the Olympic torch might be
described as traveling from "Taipei, China" to "Hong Kong, China,
" Liu said the CTOC requested in its April 20 letter that the
flame enter and exit Taiwan via third countries.
</P>
<P>
"However, Beijing ignored our request and announced the route
Thursday, " Liu said, adding that Taiwan was surprised at
Beijing's announcement.
</P>
<P>
For the sake of safeguarding Taiwan's sovereignty and national
dignity, Liu said, Taiwan must reject the Beijing-dictated torch
relay route.
</P>
<P>
In the process, Liu said, the CTOC has approached the IOC for
assistance, calling attention to Taiwan's plight that Beijing is
deliberately attempting to belittle Chinese Taipei -- an
independent member of the IOC -- as an integral part of China.
</P>
<P>
At the moment, Liu said, Taiwan will not rule out the possibility
of hosting a leg of the relay, although it requires further
discussion.
</P>
<P>
The Olympic flame has come to Taiwan only once -- in 1964 for the
Tokyo Olympic Games. President Chen Shui-bian said Friday that
Beijing should consider the relay route that Japan used in 1964,
which entailed having the flame travel to Taiwan from a third
country and then passing it on to another third country.
