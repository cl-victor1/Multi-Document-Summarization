</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  April  28 (CNA) 04/28/07  19:27:16 (By Elisa Kao)

Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) Vice Chairman Tung Chen-yuan said
Saturday that Taiwan would welcome the passage of the Olympic
torch through the country but rejects the intention of China
downgrading Taiwan to the level of one of its provinces.
</P>
<P>
Tung made the remarks at a seminar held in Taipei on the 2008
Beijing Olympic Games and cross-Taiwan Strait relations.
</P>
<P>
Tung said it is an honor for Olympic member nations to have the
torch pass through their countries and that Taiwan would like to
share this honor.
</P>
<P>
However,  he  added,  Taiwan  opposes  Beijing's  political
intervention in sports affairs and the torch relay route proposed
by Beijing.
</P>
<P>
The Olympics organizers announced Thursday that Taipei would be
included as a leg on the torch relay's "domestic" route.
</P>
<P>
According to Beijing's announcement, the Olympic torch would
arrive in Taipei from Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam before heading to
the China-controlled areas of Hong Kong and Macau.
</P>
<P>
Announcing the route, Jiang Xiaoyu, executive vice president of
the Beijing Olympic organizing committee, referred to Taipei,
Hong Kong and Macau as "overseas Chinese cities, " a description
that downgrades Taiwan's sovereign status.
</P>
<P>
An indignant Taipei insisted that the Olympic torch must enter
and depart Taiwan via a country other than China.
</P>
<P>
Tung noted that the Taiwan government has stated repeatedly that
the torch arrangement should adopt the Olympic courtesy by
obtaining the approval of the country through which the torch is
scheduled to travel.
</P>
<P>
According to Tung, Beijing Olympic Games organizing committee has
since March 2005 included Taiwan in China's "domestic route" for
the torch relay.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Chinese officials and journalists have repeatedly
referred to Taiwan as "Taipei, China, " which Tung said violates
the agreement reached between the Chinese Olympic Committee and
the Chinese Taipei Olympic Committee in 1989, in which both sides
agreed to use "Chinese Taipei" when referring to Taiwanese sports
teams when they visit China.
