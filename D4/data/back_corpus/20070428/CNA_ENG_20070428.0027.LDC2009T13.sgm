The Buddhist Compassionate Relief Tzu Chi Foundation will hold a
series of activities in May to mark the 41st anniversary  of its
inception,  foundation officials announced Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Tzu Chi, a non-profit organization founded in 1966 by Dharma
Master Cheng Yen, has come to prominence because of the relief
aid it has provided to many corners of the world.

<P>
According to Tzu Chi officials, in addition to the foundation's
missions of charity, medicine, education and culture, Tzu Chi
volunteers have spared no efforts in education on recycling over
the years. In 2003 alone, Tzu Chi's 40,000 volunteers helped
recycle 123,000 tons of garbage in Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Responding to the issue of global warming, Tzu Chi will also hold
a two-week large-scale exhibition from May 6 in front of the
Chiang Kai-shek  Memorial Hall to arouse the public's
environmental protection awareness.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the philanthropic group will hold several activities
around Taiwan on Mother's Day, May 13, to wash the image of
Buddha, a ceremony traditionally held on his birthday, and at the
same time express appreciation to mothers around the world.
