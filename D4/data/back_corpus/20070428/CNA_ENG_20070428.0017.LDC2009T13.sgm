Taipei,  April 28 (CNA) 04/28/07  16:31:16 (By Elisa Kao)

Officials of the Government Information Office (GIO) said
Saturday that they have informed the world press regarding
Taiwan's refusal to be included in China's "domestic route" in
the 2008 Beijing Olympic Game's torch relay.
</P>
<P>
The officials said that in order to clarify Taiwan's stance, GIO
personnel informed the world's major media as soon as Taipei
decided to reject being included in the 2008 Olympic torch relay
route.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese Olympics organizers announced Thursday that Taipei
would be included as a leg in the torch relay's "domestic" route.
According to Beijing's announcement, the Olympic torch would
arrive in Taipei from Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam before heading to
the China-controlled areas of Hong Kong and Macau.
</P>
<P>
While unveiling the route, Jiang Xiaoyu, executive vice president
of the Beijing Olympic organizing committee, referred to Taipei
alongside with Hong Kong and Macau as "overseas Chinese cities, "
a description that downgrades Taiwan's sovereign status.
</P>
<P>
Taipei, indignant at being "downgraded" to the level of a Chinese
province, insisted that the Olympic torch must enter and depart
Taiwan via a country other than China.
</P>
<P>
According to information collected by GIO personnel stationed
around the world, a total of 25 major news media had reported the
issue, with Japanese media accounting for the largest coverage,
followed by other Asian media.
</P>
<P>
GIO officials said the majority of the world news media had
reported objectively on the Taiwan government's stance and the
situation between the two sides of Taiwan Strait, and that few
made any editorial comments. An AP report said the episode
underscores the deep mistrust between Taipei and Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Due to the objective coverage of the issue, there has been no
damage to Taiwan's image related to its rejection of the torch
relay, the officials said.
