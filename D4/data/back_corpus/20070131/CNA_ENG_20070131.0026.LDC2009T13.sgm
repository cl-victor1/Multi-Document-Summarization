TSU HEAD ATTEMPTS TO CLARIFY FORMER PRESIDENT'S `REVISED LINE'
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  Jan.  31 (CNA) 01/31/07  18:10:13 (By Lilian Wu)
</P>
<P>
Former President Lee Teng-hui believes Taiwan is already a
sovereign, independent country and that there is no need to
pursue Taiwan independence, the opposition Taiwan Solidarity
Union's (TSU's) new head said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
TSU Chairman Huang Kun-huei was responding to reports that Lee,
the "spiritual leader" of the TSU, had revised his pro-Taiwan
independence line in an interview with Next magazine.
</P>
<P>
According to the magazine, Lee has forgone advocating Taiwan
independence and is trying to distance himself from his
unofficial title of "the godfather of Taiwan independence." Lee
also said the independence versus unification debate has become a
"false" issue in Taiwan and claimed that he has "never advocated
Taiwan independence," nor has he thought about the necessity of
pursuing Taiwan independence.
</P>
<P>
Lee also called for the introduction to Taiwan of Chinese capital
and a full opening to Chinese tourists to help boost Taiwan's
economy, the magazine claimed, adding that Lee expressed his
interest in visiting China, claiming that a "lot of people" there
have invited him.
</P>
<P>
Huang denied that Lee has made an about-face, claiming that
"there has been no change." Lee broached the "no haste, be
patient" policy as well as the theory of "special state-to-state"
cross-strait relations during his 12-year tenure that ended in
2000.
</P>
<P>
"Lee thinks Taiwan has already democratized and that it is
already a sovereign and independent country. Why should it
`backtrack' to pursue Taiwan independence?" Huang asked.
</P>
<P>
Huang said that because of historical legacy as well as pressure
from the international community, Taiwan is not a normal country.
</P>
<P>
"What Lee insists upon is a change of the nation's name and the
crafting of a new constitution to make it a normal country, "
Huang said.
</P>
<P>
Huang also claimed that "strictly speaking," it is "incorrect" to
say that Lee is in favor of introducing Chinese capital.
</P>
<P>
Lee believes that Taiwan's capital has continued to flow into
China which could run dry someday, and that the capital should
flow back, according to Huang.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, another TSU official claimed that Lee's latest remarks
do not run counter to his "go slow, be patient" policy.
</P>
<P>
Ho Min-hao, a TSU executive director of policy committee,
contradicted his colleague Huang by saying that in fact Lee did
call for the introduction of Chinese capital, but added that he
also insists on the independence and sovereignty of Taiwan and
that a campaign to change the nation's name and craft a new
constitution will continue.
</P>
<P>
He said Lee talked about the introduction of Chinese capital and
opening  to Chinese tourists  from a perspective  of "special
state-to-state" cross-strait relationship theory.
</P>
<P>
TSU Legislator Lo Chih-ming said that although Lee advocates his
"go slow, be patient" policy regarding cross-strait trade, it is
aimed at restraining Taiwan investment in China rather than at
restricting Chinese investment in Taiwan. The TSU is still
opposed to direct trade and transportation links with China and
any easing of investment in China restriction, Lo said.
</P>
<P>
He said Lee is aware that Taiwan talks about "becoming a regional
operations center, " but wonders how it can achieve the goal if
it does not allow the introduction of capital from China.
</P>
<P>
Faced with the year-end legislative elections that will adopt a
new electoral system of "single-member constituency and two
votes, " Lo said the TSU cannot act as a dependency of the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party, with whom the TSU has formed a
partnership in the "pan-green camp."
</P>
<P>
"The TSU must take a major step by presenting its ideals for the
sake of the party's long-term development," Lo added.
