Taipei,  Jan. 24 (CNA) 01/31/07  18:32:09 (By Deborah Kuo)

<P>
The Executive Yuan passed a draft bill on refugees Wednesday at a
weekly meeting, in a gesture designed to demonstrate the
importance Taiwan attaches to the human rights issue.
</P>
<P>
Welcoming its passage, Vice Premier Tsai Ing-wen said the draft
bill -- authored by the Ministry of the Interior, the Ministry of
Foreign Affairs and the Mainland Affairs Council -- if enacted
into law, will apply to persecuted people all over the world.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the refugee issue is a tragedy and that no countries
in the world can pretend that the issue is non-existent, Tsai
said that although Taiwan is not a party to the U.N.-sponsored
Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees adopted in 1951,
Taiwan is determined, as a member of the "global village, " to
enact a refugee law to deliver on its promise of promoting a
rights-based national development approach and making human
rights protection its core value and top guiding principle.
</P>
<P>
Once the bill is formally enacted with the Legislative Yuan's
approval, Tsai said, those who are persecuted in their homeland
or who have a well-founded fear of persecution there for
political, religious or ethnic reasons can apply to the Taiwan
authorities for refugee status and asylum.
</P>
<P>
After the bill takes effect, Tsai said, anyone who falls victim
to persecution on account of race, religion or political opinion
can file applications with the Ministry of the Interior for
refugee status.
</P>
<P>
If the applicants are certified as refugees through due process
set forth in the law, they can then apply for asylum or
settlement.
</P>
<P>
During that period, Tsai added, the government will render help
and support for the applicants  in their legal,  medical and
accommodation needs.
</P>
<P>
Tsai asked relevant Cabinet agencies to inform the lawmakers
quickly about the content and spirit of the draft bill so as to
facilitate its enactment at an early date.
</P>
<P>
Tsai also asked the Foreign Ministry to direct its subordinate
units overseas to notify the governments of their resident
countries about Taiwan's refugee law enactment efforts and to
make known Taiwan's determination  to safeguard human dignity and
promote humanitarianism.
