Ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) Chairman Yu Shyi-kun
said Wednesday that his party will seek to speed up promotion of
a campaign to rectify the names of Taiwan's state-owned
businesses.
</P>
<P>
Yu made the remarks at a news conference following a weekly
meeting of the DPP Central Standing Committee (CSC) , during
which Minister of Education Tu Cheng- sheng delivered a report on
how to promote the nation's historical education.
</P>
<P>
According to Yu, CSC members present at the meeting reached a
conclusion that all state-run enterprises, such as Chinese
Petroleum Corp. and China Shipbuilding Corp., should drop the
terms "Chinese" and "China" from their names.
</P>
<P>
Claiming that altering the names of state-owned businesses
bearing the terms "Chinese" or "China" does not require revisions
to relevant laws and regulations, Yu said the DPP will push for
the government to carry out name- rectification as soon as
possible.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the DPP will also call on the government to remove
"province" or "provincial" from the names of those government-run
enterprises that bear these terms, because the Taiwan Provincial
Government was eliminated about a decade ago, Yu pointed out.
</P>
<P>
To consolidate the Taiwanese identity, the DPP will redouble its
efforts to push for the name-rectification campaign so that
Taiwan will become a "normal" nation, the DPP head concluded.
