The two sides of the Taiwan Strait have reached a consensus on
expanding direct cross-strait charter flight services and
allowing Chinese citizens to take such flights, a Mainland
Affairs Council (MAC) official said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The official made the remarks after a Beijing official in charge
of Taiwan affairs said earlier in the day that "all technical
barriers" have been removed to offering direct cross-strait
passenger flights on a regular basis.
</P>
<P>
According to the MAC official, representatives from the two sides
have indeed met recently to discuss both how to make cross-strait
personnel and cargo transport more convenient and the feasibility
of expanding charter flights. "Initial consensus has been
achieved after extensive discussion," he acknowledged.
</P>
<P>
On pasenger flights, the two sides discussed how to expand the
service target. At present, only Taiwanese citizens are eligible
to take direct cross-strait charter flights on special festivals
or for emergency or humanitarian purposes.
</P>
<P>
As Taiwan is determined to open its door to Chinese tourists, the
official said, the government is not opposed to expanding the
charter flight service targets to Chinese tourists.
</P>
<P>
As to the frequency of direct cross-strait character flights, the
official  said the two sides have also reached a preliminary
consensus, but he didn't elaborate on the exact number of the
flights to be allowed per week or the time intervals.
</P>
<P>
While the two sides have agreed on allowing Chinese tourists to
take direct cross-strait charter flights, the official said they
have not yet completed talks on details regarding entry of
Chinese tourists.
</P>
<P>
Noting that charter flights and opening to Chinese tourists are
being dealt with by different government departments, the
official said the goal of allowing Chinese tourists to come to
Taiwan via direct charter flights will become a reality when
negotiations on both topics are completed.
</P>
<P>
According to the officials, personnel from both sides are
expected to meet again before the Chinese New Year, which falls
on Feb. 18, in the hope of finalizing talks on certain
contentious points.
