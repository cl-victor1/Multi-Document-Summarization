Former Premier Frank Hsieh arrived in New York Tuesday, from
where he will drive to Washington, D.C. the following day to
attend the annual National Prayer Breakfast, slated for Jan.31-
Feb. 1, as the envoy of President Chen Shui-bian.

Hsieh is being accompanied on his visit by Wu Li-pei, a former
senior adviser to President Chen Shui-bian; several ruling
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) legislators, including Hsieh
Hsin-ni and Hsu Kuo-yung; and Chen Chien-chung, a commissioner of
the Coordination Council for North American Affairs.

In reply to media questions upon his arrival, Hsieh said he will
meet with members of the U.S. Congress as well as several think
tanks during his stay in Washington, D.C.

Asked about Taiwan's current state and future, Hsieh said he
thinks "solidarity" is the most important thing for the country
to strive for now.

In response to a question about how the DPP will nominate its
candidate for the 2008 presidential election, Hsieh expressed the
hope for more intra-party communication and suggested that the
party build a negotiation mechanism regarding election affairs.

The National Prayer Breakfast is an unofficial, non-political and
private gathering whose spirit lies in friendship and sharing.
The organizers have traditionally invited some 3,000 leading
politicians, opinion leaders and representatives from all walks
of life from more than 150 countries around the world to attend.

As in the past, U.S. President George W. Bush, Vice President
Dick Cheney and influential members of Congress will attend the
event, according to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
