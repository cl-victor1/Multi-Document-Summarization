The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) said Wednesday that it
will work closely with the National Police Agency to crack down
on Taiwanese fraudsters in South Korea lest they tarnish the
nation's image.
</P>
<P>
MOFA officials said that between September 2006 and January 2007,
several cases involving Taiwanese fraudsters were reported and
several Taiwanese who were commissioned to travel to South Korea
to claim fraudulently obtained money had been apprehended by
South Korean police.
</P>
<P>
They said that 14 such cases involving 30 Taiwanese took place in
South  Korea according  to an initial  estimate  by Taiwan's
representative office in Seoul.
</P>
<P>
The fraudsters allegedly called South Korean residents to say
that their children had been kidnapped and demanded ransom money.
Other criminals used forged credit cards, they added.
</P>
<P>
MOFA has asked the National Police Agency to track down the
fraudsters and said the ministry would also remind those who plan
to travel to South Korea not to collect money on behalf of other
people.
