Taipei, Jan. 31 (CNA) 01/31/07  15:55:48 (By Y.F. Low)

The Environmental Protection Administration said Wednesday the
cold front that is expected to hit Taiwan Thursday will bring
more air pollutants to the country and advised people with
cardiovascular or respiratory disease to avoid heading outdoors.
</P>
<P>
According to Chang Shun-chin, a section chief at the EPA's
Department of Environmental Monitoring and Information
Management, most of the pollutants that have flowed to Taiwan
along with cold fronts recently are industrial waste produced by
factories in China's coastal areas.
</P>
<P>
Sand storms from Inner Mongolia, which were the most common
source of air pollution in Taiwan during winter seasons in the
past, are not obvious this year, Chang said.
</P>
<P>
Monitoring conducted by the EPA as of Wednesday morning showed
that the air quality in Taiwan remained unsatisfactory, with an
especially high concentration of particulate matter having been
detected in the atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
The greatest increase in particulate matter concentrations has
been seen on the outlying islands of Kinmen and Matsu, where the
concentrations of the pollutants have registered at 151
micrograms per square meter and 199 micrograms per square meter,
respectively, EPA officials said.
</P>
<P>
Air quality in northern Taiwan has also been poor, with the
concentration of particulate matter reading 124 micrograms in
Taipei County's Wanli, 111 micrograms on Yangmingshan and 99
micrograms in downtown Taipei City, all exceeding the background
concentration of 80 micrograms, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the concentration of sulfur dioxide detected in the
air in downtown Taipei City has also increased to 10 parts per
billion (ppb) , double the background concentration of 5 ppb,
they added.
