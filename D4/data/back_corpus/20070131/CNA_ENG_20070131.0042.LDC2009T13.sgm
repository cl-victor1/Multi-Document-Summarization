A group in Tainan city keen on the idea of relocating Taiwan's
capital from Taipei to southern Taiwan agreed Wednesday upon a
resolution suggesting that the next president decide to which
city or county the capital should be relocated, a spokesman for
the group said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman for the Tainan-based group dedicated to the capital
relocation issue urged cities and counties in southern and
central Taiwan to establish similar organizations to further
promote the cause.
</P>
<P>
He opined that city and county governments in southern and
central Taiwan should refrain from jockeying for the position and
should instead forge a consensus on the relocation issue as soon
as possible.
</P>
<P>
The group, with Tainan City Mayor Hsu Tien-tsai as its convener,
is composed of local officials, city councilors and like-minded
individual activists to promote the idea of capital relocation.

The idea of relocating the capital from the northern Taipei city
to a city or county in southern or central Taiwan has received a
warm response from local authorities, with Taichung city, Chiayi
city, Chiayi county, Kaohsiung city and Kaohsiung county all
displaying a high degree of interest.
</P>
<P>
President Chen Shui-bian said in recent days that the government
will begin studying the possibility  of first relocating some
government agencies, such as the Council of Labor Affairs and the
Council of Agriculture, to better serve people in southern Taiwan
before relocating the capital city.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile,  a number of pro-independence cultural, medical,
academic and educational groups headquartered in southern
Kaohsiung city, Taiwan's second- largest city after Taipei,
issued a joint statement later the same day calling on the
Ministry of Education and the Council for Cultural Affairs to be
moved to Tainan city, where they said Taiwan's traditional
culture and rites are very well preserved.
</P>
<P>
The groups made the call on the grounds that it is very important
to have the two government agencies operate in Tainan -- a
historical home of Taiwan's culture -- in order to recover the
country's culture and traditions. They argued that firmly
establishing a Taiwanese government after Chinese rule of more
than 50 years should be a major campaign issue in the coming
elections.
</P>
<P>
According to these groups, most of the bureaucrats at government
agencies in Taipei have a Chinese mindset and the city has long
been besieged by Chinese influences.
