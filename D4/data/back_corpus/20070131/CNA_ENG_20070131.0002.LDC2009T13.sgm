REDISTRICTING LAWMAKERS' CONSTITUENCIES TO BE SETTLED WEDNESDAY
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  Jan. 30 (CNA) 01/31/07  10:20:24 (By Maubo Chang)

With one day to go before the deadline for redistricting
lawmakers' constituencies, Legislative Speaker Wang Jin-pyng said
Tuesday he will meet with Premier Su Tseng-chang the following
day in the hope of sorting out their differences on the issue.
</P>
<P>
Although the Central Election Commission has to publish the new
constituencies that day, the election districts in eight out of
the country's 25 counties and cities were not redivided because
of a lack of consensus between the executive and legislative
branches, Wang said.
</P>
<P>
A lot of problems remain to be settled in those eight counties
and cities, Wang said, adding that both Su and he agreed that a
solution would have to be worked out by Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The division of election districts, which was necessary after a
constitutional amendment cut the number of legislative seats from
225 to 113, was supposed to be approved by the legislature by
Dec. 31 last year according to the law, and those parts not
approved on time had to be decided by the chiefs of the executive
and legislative branches via negotiations.
</P>
<P>
The deadline for the negotiations falls due Wednesday, and Wang
said that both Su and he had been overwhelmed by phone calls from
incumbent lawmakers who are concerned about the outcome of the
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
The speaker said that even if the premier and he fail to meet
Wednesday's deadline,  the new electoral system --  with one
legislative seat for each election district as provided in an
amendment to the Constitution -- will be employed in the year-end
legislative eletions anyway.
