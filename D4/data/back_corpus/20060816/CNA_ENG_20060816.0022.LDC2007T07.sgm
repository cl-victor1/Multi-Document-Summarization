Taipei, Aug. 16 (CNA) (By Deborah Kuo)

Premier Su Tseng-chang exhorted the country Wednesday to strive to win
the right to host the world design conference authorized by the
International Council of Societies of Industrial Design (ICSID) in
2011.
</P>
<P>
Hosting the conference would help raise Taiwan's design standards and
capabilities as well as improve the country's image in the
international community, Su said during a meeting at the Industrial
Development Bureau.
</P>
<P>
Su asked the Ministry of Economic Affairs to work with the Government
Information Office and other relevant government agencies to
coordinate resources from the official, industrial, academic and
research sectors for the purpose of winning the right to sponsor the
2011 ICSID meeting.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the premier also gave thumbs up to the progress of the
government authorized Designed in Taiwan (DIT) project.
</P>
<P>
The DIT project -- a four-year, NT$800 million (US$24.46 million)
program that began last year -- has yielded fruit this year in either
efforts to win prizes in international design competitions, or to
upgrade industrial design ability and capability and promote the
public's recognition of industrial design, Su said.
