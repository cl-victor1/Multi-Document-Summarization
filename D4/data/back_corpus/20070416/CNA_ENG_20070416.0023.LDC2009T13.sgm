TAIWAN OFFICIAL CALLS FOR JAPAN'S COOPERATION IN FACING UP TO
CHINA

Tokyo,  April 16 (CNA) 04/16/07  18:40:19 (By Mike Chang and

<P>
Japan should cooperate with Taiwan to face up to threat from
China, a Taiwan official said in an article carried in Monday's
Sankei Shimbun newspaper.
</P>
<P>
Tung Chen-yuan, vice chairman of Taiwan's Mainland Affairs
Council warned in the article that China was eyeing Japan when it
fired a missile to destroy a defunct orbiting satellite Jan. 11.
</P>
<P>
Tung noted that the missile was fired one day after Japanese
Prime Minister Shinzo Abe asked the European Union not to lift
its boycott on arms sales to China and two days after Tokyo
upgraded its Defense Agency to a Cabinet-level ministry.
</P>
<P>
China, which has already deployed more than 1,000 missiles aimed
at Taiwan, continues building up its military force rapidly,
showing that Beijing is aiming at countries other than Taiwan,
according to Tung.
</P>
<P>
Tung said he is surprised that Tokyo is worried about the threat
posed by North Korea while ignoring the more serious threat posed
by Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Tung said Tokyo should cooperate with Taipei to cope with both
North Korea and China.
