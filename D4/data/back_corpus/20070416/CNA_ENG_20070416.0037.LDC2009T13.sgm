A group of Singaporean dialysis patients and their families have
arrived in Taiwan to receive treatment and travel in the country,
the group's organizer said Monday.
</P>
<P>
The visit is part of a cooperation agreement between Jen Chi
hospital in the capital of Taipei and the Singapore-based Asia
Renal Care (ARC) company, a spokesman for the hospital said.
</P>
<P>
The company has established a blood dialysis center at the
hospital, the spokesman noted.

<P>
The hospital received the investment partly because of its
location in the vicinity of a famous night market in the city,
the spokesman claimed, adding that the patient's family members
can tour the market during the four-hour wait.

<P>
The 19-member group -- seven of whom are patients -- arrived in
Taiwan April 14, the spokesman said, adding that the patients
were scheduled to check into the hospital earlier in the day.
</P>
<P>
Saying that Taiwan enjoys some of the highest medical standards
in Asia,  the spokesman  described  local medical services as
inexpensive and able to attract foreign medical tourism
investment.
