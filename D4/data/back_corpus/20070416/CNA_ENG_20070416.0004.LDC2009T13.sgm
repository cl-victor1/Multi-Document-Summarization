Washington,  April 15 (CNA) 04/16/07  13:17:40 (By Chiehyu Lin
and Deborah Kuo)
</P>
<P>
Taiwan's new representative to the United States, Joseph Wu,
arrived to a warm welcome in Washington, D.C. Sunday to assume
his post.
</P>
<P>
Over 100 Taiwanese expatriates, along with Taiwan officials
stationed in the United States and officials from the American
Institute in Taiwan (AIT), the de facto U.S. embassy in Taiwan,
met Wu at the airport, welcoming the first Taiwan representative
to the United States from the ruling Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP).
</P>
<P>
Overwhelmed by the warm welcome from the Taiwanese expatriates
who came from all around the greater Washington and Baltimore
areas to greet him, Wu said he will do his utmost during his
stint in Washington to safeguard the interests of Taiwan and its
people.
</P>
<P>
Wu said he is pleased to be the first DPP representative in the
United States but stressed that he is representing Taiwan, the
Republic of China, and its 23 million people and will handle
U.S.-Taiwan relations based on the principle of protecting and
promoting Taiwan's interests to the greatest degree.
</P>
<P>
On the issue of the DPP administration's seeking constitutional
reform to facilitate a Taiwan name rectification plan, Wu said
this is part of the progress that Taiwan must make in its
democratization process, adding that he will keep the U.S.
authorities informed of all relevant developments.
</P>
<P>
Wu said that topping his agenda in Washington will be enhancing
communications with U.S.  authorities over the ever-increasing
political lobbying efforts by China on Capitol Hill, adding that
he will try to bolster Taiwan's preparedness in this regard and
also try to increase Taiwan's influence in the U.S. Congress.
</P>
<P>
Wu, who was Taiwan's top China policy planner before being
assigned by President Chen Shui-bian to be the country's new
representative in Washington, said that in the face of China's
rapid military expansion and economic rise, Taiwan must be more
aggressive and adopt pragmatic strategies to let the
international community better understand Taiwan and its
situation.
</P>
<P>
Wu said he believes that his background as Mainland Affairs
Council head should make him more persuasive when it comes to
dialogue with U.S. friends over issues concerning cross-Taiwan
Strait relations.
</P>
<P>
As to Taiwan's bid to join the World Health Organization (WHO) --
a longstanding goal that has yet to be realized due to China's
obstruction, Wu said he will try his utmost to seek the United
States' support and understanding, particularly regarding the
unfair treatment that the Taiwan people have faced by being
excluded from the world health regulatory body.
</P>
<P>
Wu noted that only the 23 million people of Taiwan are not
represented in the WHO -- a fact that is "unarguably unjust for
the Taiwan people."
</P>
<P>
Consequently, he said, relevant Taiwan officials must seek more
pragmatic means to let the Taiwan people have access to the WHO
and its activities on a more equal footing.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, AIT Managing Director Barbara Jane Schrage, who
welcomed Wu in person upon his arrival at the airport, said the
U.S. government welcomes Wu with open arms and believes that
given his backround and experience, he will be a capable
representative just like his predecessors.
