With the firefly breeding season about to enter full swing,
sightseeing visits to Lienhuache, a popular firefly conservation
spot in Yuche township of Nantou County, central Taiwan, will be
restricted from late April as part of efforts to protect the
insects from human disturbance, Taiwan Forestry Research
Institute (TFRI) officials said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Lienhuache, surrounded by wetlands and old agricultural land
where farming activity has not been carried out for many years,
is listed as a national treasure because of its abundant and
various natural resources. Over the years, the TFRI has worked
with local people to revive creeks and forests around Lienhuache,
an effort that has proved successful, as the number of lightening
bugs has been growing there, TFRI official Wu Chun-hsiung said.

<P>
Attracted by the glowworms, more and more tourists are visiting
the Lienhuache area during the insect's breeding season in April
and May, Wu said, adding that to protect them from human
disturbance, the Lienhuache creek conservation association has
since last year taken measures to restrict tourist visits to
Lienhuache during the "Firefly Festival."
</P>
<P>
In 2006, more than 10,000 tourists visited Lienhuache to capture
the beauty of a night lit by the insect, which only lives in
clean natural environments, according to the TFRI.
</P>
<P>
Wu said those who want to drive to Lienhuache must park in
Yuche's Wutsun village, where the association provides services
for firefly visitors, including lectures on the bug's life and
how to visit the insects without disturbing them.
