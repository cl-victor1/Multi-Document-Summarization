GLOBAL WARNING CAUSES TROPICAL FRUIT TO HIT TAIWAN MARKET EARLY
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  April  16 (CNA) 04/16/07  21:58:07 (By Han Nai-kuo)

Global warming does not seem to be treating the people of Taiwan
all that badly because a variety of tropical fruits that usually
come into season between June and August have this year been
ripening since March.
</P>
<P>
Huang Mei-hua, a section chief in charge of crop production at
the Agricultural and Food Agency under the Cabinet-level Council
of Agriculture, told reporters Monday that the period from March
to May is usually a season of scarce fruit supplies in Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
She explained, however, that as a result of global warming,
various tropical fruits are ripening earlier than normal climate
conditions would allow.
</P>
<P>
Huang noted that papayas, bananas, pineapples and mangoes have
been in abundant supply since March, and that another favored
tropical fruit, lychee, will begin to hit the market in May.
</P>
<P>
One good thing about the abundant fruit supply is that although
consumers have a great variety to choose from, the prices have
remained stable and created handsome profits for fruit farmers,
she said.
