Former Premier Frank Hsieh said Monday that public opinion polls
conducted by his own camp show that he is ahead of other ruling
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) hopefuls bidding to represent
the party in the 2008 presidential election.
</P>
<P>
Hsieh said that he will not comment on public opinion polls
conducted by the media which also showed that he is ahead but
that polls conducted by his camp show he is leading the other
three DPP presidential hopefuls, namely Vice President Annette
Lu, Premier Su Tseng-chang and DPP Chairman Yu Shyi-kun.

<P>
"The public opinion polls go up and down, and as the leading
contender, I'll deal with them with humility."

On other hopefuls' questions regarding the results of his camp's
polls, Hsieh said that if they have any doubts, they can conduct
their own public opinion polls.

Hsieh made the remarks during a visit to a center for physically
and mentally challenged children in Taichung, central Taiwan.

According to the DPP's primary mechanism, a party member vote
will be held in early May, with the results accounting for 30
percent of the hopefuls' final score, followed by a series of
public opinion polls, whose results will account for 70 percent
of the hopefuls' final score. The party's presidential candidate
will be announced May 30.
