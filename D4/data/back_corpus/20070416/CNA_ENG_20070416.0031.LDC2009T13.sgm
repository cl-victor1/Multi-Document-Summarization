RIGHT POLICY AND ENVOY WILL BOOST TAIWAN-U.S. TIES: EX-OFFICIAL
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  April  16 (CNA) 04/16/07  20:46:05 (By Lilian Wu)

The right policies, represented by an envoy able to communicate
effectively with the United States, will "be a boost to
Taiwan-U.S. relations," a former Taiwan representative to the
United States said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Chen Chien-jen, who served as the nation's top representative to
Washington 2000-2004, made the remarks at a public hearing in the
legislature.
</P>
<P>
Chen noted that the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) is
confident that the new representative to the United States,
Joseph Wu, will convey the government's stance and policies
faithfully to the U.S., thus mitigating bilateral
misunderstanding, which he thinks is a good thing.
</P>
<P>
He also said that whether the new appointment will provide a
boost to Taiwan-U.S. relations hinges on whether the policy is
right.
</P>
<P>
The right policy, coupled with an appropriate envoy, will be a
boon, but if it deviates from the right policy, and an envoy
cannot faithfully convey the government's stance and policies,
relations will suffer.
</P>
<P>
'Deciding whether the policy is right or wrong will require
public examination," he added.
</P>
<P>
Chen's words came as Wu, former chairman of the Mainland Affairs
Council, arrived at the Washington D.C. Monday to assume his new
post.
</P>
<P>
Wu said that he was glad to be the first DPP member to serve as
Taiwan's envoy in the United States, but he stressed that he will
represent the country and not serve a particular political party,
vowing to keep Taiwan's best interests in mind while dealing with
Taiwan-U.S. relations.
</P>
<P>
Chen, a career diplomat, concurrently served as the
representative to the European Union and Belgium from 2004 until
his retirement last year.
