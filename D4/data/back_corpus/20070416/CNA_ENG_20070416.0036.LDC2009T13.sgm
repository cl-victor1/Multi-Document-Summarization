MA TO ATTEND 2ND COURT HEARING ON CORRUPTION CHARGES
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taipei, April 16 (CNA) 04/16/07  21:59:52 (By Flor Wang)
</P>
<P>
Ma Ying-jeou, former chairman of the main opposition Kuomintang
(KMT) , will attend a second court hearing on corruption charges
Tuesday at the Taipei District Court, Ma's aides said Monday.
</P>
<P>
According to the aides, Ma's Monday schedule was unaffected by
Tuesday's trial, and he was not so nervous this time compared
with April 3 when the trial was opened for the first time.
Tuesday's court hearing will be opened to the public.
</P>
<P>
Ma met KMT Honorary Chairman Lien Chan last week and Lien was
relieved to learn of Ma's current situation concerning the
lawsuit against him, the aides said, adding that in recent days
Ma also discussed with lawyers adopting a strategy with which to
better defend himself during the coming trial.
</P>
<P>
Ma was charged by Taipei prosecutors in mid-February over his
alleged embezzlement of NT$11 million from a special municipal
monthly allowance designated for his discretionary use during his
two terms as mayor of Taipei from 1998-2006.
</P>
<P>
Ma's ongoing trial on embezzlement charges has cast shadow over
his chances of representing the KMT in the 2008 presidential
election, as the party's rules presently ban members convicted in
the first trial from taking part in any elections.
</P>
<P>
Despite the embezzlement charges, Ma still picked up earlier this
month a registration form for the KMT's presidential primary in a
display of his resolve to pursue his presidential bid.
</P>
<P>
On the other side, Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng, also a
KMT member who harbors a strong presidential ambition, failed to
collect the form, provoking grave concern among KMT supporters
that Wang might split and run in the next presidential election
as an independent instead of pairing up with Ma.
</P>
<P>
Due to mounting uncertainties about Ma's fate, KMT members of the
Kaohsiung County branch suggested Monday that the party prepare
two presidential tickets so that it can better cope with the
situation in case Ma is unable to take part in the next
presidential race.
</P>
<P>
The KMT will have to mediate between the two tickets if Ma is
able to ride out the difficulties lying ahead, they suggested,
pointing out that the KMT could field Wang to run in the coming
presidential election if Ma is unable to stand for the party.
</P>
<P>
Wang, who attended an economic seminar with the KMT members in
Kaohsiung County Monday, declined to comment the proposal.
</P>
<P>
According to Wang, Taiwan's people are looking forward to a
second transfer of power in 2008, and he urged the KMT to take
full precautions against all possible scenarios in the run-up to
the next presidential contest.
</P>
<P>
In response to a rumored presidential ticket with Ma, Wang told
reporters earlier the same day in Taipei that such a format
"still has a long way to go " and refused to touch on the issue
again in the coming months.
