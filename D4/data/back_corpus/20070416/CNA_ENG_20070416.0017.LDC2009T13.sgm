Taipei,  April 16 (CNA) 04/16/07  16:39:21 (By Flor Wang)

Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng brushed aside Monday
speculation that he has agreed to form a presidential ticket with
former opposition Kuomintang (KMT) chief Ma Ying-jeou for the
2008 presidential election, saying that a final settlement is
still far way off.
</P>
<P>
Wang, also a member of the main opposition KMT, made the comments
at the Legislative Yuan while answering questions from reporters.
His remarks came after Ma said a day earlier that a KMT
presidential ticket has been in place following a March 7 meeting
during which he and Wang agreed to invite each other to team up
on a ticket if either is nominated by the party as presidential
candidate.
</P>
<P>
According to Ma, Chan Chun-po, manager of his presidential
campaign, paid a visit to Wang on his behalf last week and
reiterated his position to the legislative speaker.
</P>
<P>
In response to Ma's claim that a KMT presidential ticket of
himself and Wang has taken shape, Wang said the issue has not
been settled and that he would not touch on the issue in the
coming months.
</P>
<P>
"There is no fixed format regarding the KMT ticket in the 2008
presidential race, " Wang said, while denying that he discussed
the issue with Chan.
</P>
<P>
The formation of a ticket between Ma and Wang is expected by KMT
supporters who are gravely concerned that a split would boost the
chances of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party in the next
presidential contest.
