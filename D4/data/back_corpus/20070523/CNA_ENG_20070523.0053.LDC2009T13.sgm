EX-MUSEUM CURATOR SUBPOENAED OVER SUSPECTED SCANDAL

<P>
Former National Palace Museum curator Shih Shou-chien and seven
other museum staff members were subpoenaed Wednesday over a
suspected profiteering scandal involving a museum facelift
project.
</P>
<P>
The interrogations of the museum staff came a day after local
prosecutors led more than 60 investigators in searching their
offices and residences for evidence of suspected irregularities.
</P>
<P>
The accused also included the museum's former chief secretary
Hsueh Fei-yuan, former general affairs department chief,  Yeh
Chang-chi, and other clerks and technicians.
</P>
<P>
The interrogations at the Shihlin District Prosecutor's Office
are still ongoing as of the press time.
</P>
<P>
At issue was a NT$385 million (US$11.53  million)  museum
renovation project that got underway in July 2004 and was not
fully completed until late last year.
</P>
<P>
Media reports said judicial authorities do not ruled out the
possibility of summoning incumbent Education Minister Tu Cheng-
sheng for questioning because the facelift project was conceived
and drafted during Tu's stint as the museum's curator.
</P>
<P>
Opposition lawmakers have asked Tu to explain his role in the
case. However, Tu didn't make any response to the call. Instead,
his aide said Tu will respect judicial authorities'
investigations and if necessary, he will dutifully answer their
subpoenas.
</P>
<P>
Tu's aide said the case has been under probes for quite some
time. Given Tu's high-profile status and position, the aide said
he believes that it would have long been exposed if Tu's had any
wrongdoing in this case.
</P>
<P>
In Tuesday's massive raid,  the offices and residences of
architect Luo Hsing- hua and other contractors were also
searched. A large collection of files and documents, including
the texts of a contract between the museum and Luo's company and
blueprints for the museum's face-lift projects, were seized in
the raid.
</P>
<P>
Prosecution authorities said the raid was launched only after
nearly two years of extensive investigations. Probes got underway
after law enforcement authorities received a written petition.
</P>
<P>
Investigators  said  they  have scrutinized  many documents
concerning the open tender for the renovation project, contract
negotiations, meeting minutes and selection of qualified
contractors. Following comprehensive scrutiny, law enforcers said
they found suspected irregularities, including possible bribery
taking and favoritism.
</P>
<P>
After securing search warrants, prosecutors from Taipei's Shihlin
District Prosecutor's  Office  led agents from the Bureau of
Investigation in raiding more than 10 locations Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
According to prosecutors, the Palace Museum renovation project
was tainted by repeated cost overruns. The museum is home to one
of the largest collection of ancient Chinese art treasures.
