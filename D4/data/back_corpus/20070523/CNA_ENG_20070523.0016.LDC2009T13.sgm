ACADEMIA SINICA HEAD REPORTS ON INSTITUTE'S RESEARCH
BREAKTHROUGHS

Taipei,  May  23 (CNA) 05/23/07  14:47:57 (By Deborah Kuo)

Academia Sinica researchers have made several breakthroughs in
their research over the past two years, including producing proof
that adult lung stem cells may have played a key role in the SARS
epidemics, Academia Sinica President Chi- Huey Wong said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Reporting at the Legislative  Yuan Science and Information
Committee, Wong said that a research team led by John Yu, head of
the Stem Cell Program in Academia Sinica's Genomics Research
Center, made the discovery concerning lung stem cells.
</P>
<P>
Wong said that the research team's study shows that lung stem
cells, which are not easily spotted, were an important target of
the SARS viruses in their "decapitation strike" attacks on the
lungs.
</P>
<P>
In his research, Yu, who witnessed firsthand the SARS outbreak in
Taiwan back in 2003, noticed a lag time between the peak virus
load of SARS patients and development of acute respiratory
distress syndrome (ARDS) . Yu speculated that the lag time might
reflect the duration of a stem cell's regenerative cycle to
repair lung damage, according to Wong.
</P>
<P>
Quoting a report by Yu's research team, Wong said it has been
known that 90 percent of the lung cells contribute to lung
tissues as bubbles for gas exchange, referred to as "type I
pneumocytes" which are derived from "type II pneumocytes."
</P>
<P>
Scientists have long speculated that there are adult stem cells
in the lung which are responsible for making both type I &amp; II
lung cells in order to maintain the smooth running of the
respiratory system. Supporting proof was finally provided by Yu's
team in the in vitro study of SARS infected lung tissues, Wong
noted.
</P>
<P>
He added that the team had grown lung cells in vitro, and in a P4
lab, they noticed only one unique cell population was infected by
SARS viruses. Through various steps of verification, they found
that this specific group of cells bears the Oct-4 and SSEA-1
markers which are also markers for embryonic stem cells.
Therefore, it is very likely these cells that are targeted
specifically by SARS viruses are the pulmonary stem progenitor
cells.
</P>
<P>
"They could also be the left over 'embryonic' stem cells hidden
in the lungs, " Wong quoted Yu as saying.
</P>
<P>
The study points to the possible involvement of lung stem cells
in SARS-CoV infection, accounting for the continued deterioration
of lung tissues and apparent loss of capacity for lung repair in
the later stage of infection, Wong said.
</P>
<P>
The team's study results -- published in an issue of the
Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (103 9530-9535,
2006) , which publishes reports on cutting-edge research from
several different scientific disciplines -- have opened a door
for future manipulation of lung stem cells in cellular therapy of
ARDS, Wong asserted.
</P>
<P>
A patent application is currently in process, Wong added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Wong claimed that Academia Sinica has led other
research institutes in Taiwan over the past 10 years in terms of
the number of times their research articles or theses have been
cited. Each Academia Sinica article or thesis has been cited an
average of 8.39 times over the past decade, compared with 6.25
times for articles or theses produced by National Taiwan
University, the top university in Taiwan, he said.
</P>
<P>
By comparison, each research article or thesis produced by the
National University of Singapore has been cited 6.41 times in the
same period, each of those of the Chinese Academy of Sciences has
been cited 4.22 times on average, and each of those by Japan's
RIKEN has been cited 13.08 times, Wong said.
