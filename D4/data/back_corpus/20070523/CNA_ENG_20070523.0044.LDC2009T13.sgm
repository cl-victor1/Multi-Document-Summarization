EDUCATION MINISTRY TO SUE TAIPEI CITY GOVERNMENT

Taipei,  May 23 (CNA) 05/23/07  21:21:49 (By Flor Wang)

The Ministry of Education (MOE) will file a lawsuit Wednesday
against the Taipei city government on charges of hindering public
duty as well as damaging and illegally possessing public
property, an MOE official said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The official, who asked not to be named, said the MOE will take
legal action against the Taipei municipal authorities, which it
accused of removing two pieces of a curtain a day earlier that
were affixed last Saturday to the National Taiwan Democracy
Memorial Hall in downtown Taipei to hide from public view its
previous name -- the Chiang Kai-shek Memorial Hall.
</P>
<P>
According to the official, the MOE will erect a new curtain on
the hall Wednesday and take the case to the prosecution.
</P>
<P>
The hall -- one of Taipei's landmark buildings -- has become the
focus of a dispute between the central and local governments in
recent months after the Executive Yuan insisted on making the
building  devoted to Taiwan's democratization  in line with a
name-change  campaign rekindled early this year by the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party with the aim of ridding the country
of memories of the late President Chiang Kai-shek, described by
the DPP as a dictator.
</P>
<P>
Taipei Mayor Hau Lung-bin has vowed no compromise over the issue
and called the Executive Yuan's "downgrading" of the hall with an
administrative order to realize its name change "unlawful" --
something the Taipei city government will deal with by the book.
</P>
<P>
The municipal cultural affairs bureau has since Monday meted out
punishment amounting to nearly NT$1 million in fines. Bureau
Director Lee Yung-ping made it clear the fines will continue if
the MOE "ignores rule by law."
