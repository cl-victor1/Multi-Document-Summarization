Taipei, May 23 (CNA) 05/23/07  14:58:47 (By T.C. Jiang)

<P>
Taiwan's total export value will hit another new high of over
US$242 billion this year, and Taiwan is able to maintain a trade
surplus of over US$20 billion, according to Economics Minister
Steve R.L. Chen.
</P>
<P>
Chen made the forecast Tuesday in his report on the Ministry of
Economic Affairs (MOEA)'s major goals this year to new Premier
Chang Chun-hsiung.
</P>
<P>
The ministry will push for Taiwan's total export value to grow by
10 percent, Chen said.
</P>
<P>
In the future, the MOEA will continue to promote private
investment, to push for the formation of industrial clusters in
central and southern Taiwan, and to provide counseling to small
and medium-sized enterprises as well as traditional industries,
Chen noted.
</P>
<P>
The ministry will also promote branding in Taiwan and the
establishment of a business research institute, Chen added.
</P>
<P>
The ministry has mapped out development strategies and counseling
measures for four new industries in Taiwan -- wireless broadband,
digital life, health care, and green energies, Chen said.
</P>
<P>
It is expected that the four industries will generate a total
production value of NT$1.28 trillion (US$38.2 billion) by 2009,
Chen went on.
</P>
<P>
Chen said that the premier did not touched upon a proposal to
adjust the basic wage rate, or any major investment projects.
</P>
<P>
Chang only instructed that the ministry should take into account
both environmental protection and economic development, Chen
said.
