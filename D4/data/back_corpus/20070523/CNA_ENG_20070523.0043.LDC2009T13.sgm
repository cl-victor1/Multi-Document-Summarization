VICE PRESIDENT, EX-PREMIER WILL NOT SERVE AS AT-LARGE LEGISLATORS

Taipei,  May 23 (CNA) 05/23/07  20:44:46 (By Lilian Wu)

Both Vice President Annette Lu and former Premier Su Tseng-chang
declined an invitation Wednesday to serve as at-large legislators
of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP).
</P>
<P>
Lu expressed her appreciation for Yu's invitation, but said that
"there are so many qualified people in the party, I should
concede the seat to one of them."
</P>
<P>
Lu was responding to earlier reports that DPP Chairman Yu Shyi-
kun was mulling placing her at the top of the party's at-large
legislative seat list.
</P>
<P>
Reports said that Yu hoped the move would have helped mend fences
in the wake of the bitterly contested presidential primary May 6,
in which former Premier Frank Hsieh defeated Su, Lu and Yu
himself. Party solidarity would boost the party's chances of
winning the year-end legislative elections and the 2008
presidential election, according to Yu.
</P>
<P>
Su also declined the invitation and expressed hope instead that
the DPP will consider Ker Chien-ming, a DPP party whip in the
Legislative Yuan, saying that Ker has contributed a lot to the
party and that his coordination ability is acclaimed.
</P>
<P>
The new legislature will adopt the "single-member constituency,
two votes" electoral system and will have only 113 seats -- half
the present number of legislative seats -- including 73 regional
legislators, six aboriginal representatives and 34 seats for at-
large and overseas expatriate representatives.
</P>
<P>
The at-large legislative seats will be allocated in proportion to
the number of ballots garnered by each political party in the
legislative elections.
