Premier Chang Chun-hsiung expressed hope Wednesday that the
Central Taiwan Science Park will become a high-tech stronghold in
which several sectors will eventually register production value
of NT$1 trillion (US$29.94 million).
</P>
<P>
The premier made the remarks as he heard a National Science
Council (NSC) report on the development of the Central Taiwan
Science Park.
</P>
<P>
He asked the NSC to see to it that the park promotes the
precision machinery, electronic communications and biotechnology
sectors so that they will become the third, fourth and fifth
sectors to target a production value of NT$1 trillion after the
semiconductor and image display sectors.
</P>
<P>
Chang noted that the park is the nation's third after the Hsinchu
Science-based Industrial Park and the Southern Taiwan Science
Park. Since the ground-breaking in July 2004, the park has helped
boost economic prosperity and development in central Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
He expressed hope that the park, along with the others, will
become a high-tech industry cluster with distinctive features to
help facilitate the nation's goal of becoming a "green silicon
island."
</P>
<P>
NSC officials reported that 84 manufacturers have been approved
to set up in the Central Taiwan Science Park and that they have
invested more than NT$1.7 trillion. Thirty-three manufacturers
have begun mass production and the turnover this year is expected
to reach more than NT$240 billion.
</P>
<P>
Looking ahead, the officials said, annual turnover of the park
could break NT$1 trillion in 2015, with 150 manufacturers
employing 80,000 people.
