A design project involving the National Palace Museum (NPM) and
the Italian design company Alessi, which purports to represent a
"third culture" of East meeting West, was launched Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Inspired by a portrait of the young Chin Dynasty Emperor Qian
Long seen on a visit to the NPM, Alessi's main designer Stefano
Giovannoni created the virtual characters "Mr. and Mrs. Chin" in
The Chin Family Series, which includes salt and pepper grinders,
egg cups and kitchen timers.
</P>
<P>
The series "symbolizes a cultural dialogue between the East and
the West" and matches the essence of the NPM's "old is new"
campaign, said NPM Director Lin Mun-lee at the launch ceremony.
</P>
<P>
"The series is a crossing of eastern and western culture as well
as the old and the new ... The definition of 'modern' and 'old'
have changed, and our jobs and companies go to the East more and
more, " said Giovannoni, who said the cultural exchanges under
the impact of globalization have been a common phenomenon in
almost every field.
</P>
<P>
Merchandise of the series will arrive in NPM gift shops and some
5,000 international Alessi store locations. Customers around the
globe will have the opportunity to take home "a piece of ancient
Chinese history brought tastefully into fashion," Giovannoni
said, adding that Alessi has received three times the orders it
had expected before the launch.
</P>
<P>
The second design stage will be completed next September, when
more items will be on the market, he said.
</P>
<P>
The collaboration is like "a marriage between the greatest
Chinese culture and one of the greatest Italian designers, " said
Maria Assunta Accili, Representative of the Italian Economic,
Trade and Cultural Promotion Office (IETCPO) in Taipei.
</P>
<P>
The five items launched Wednesday were the first design works by
Alessi since signing an agreement with the NPM in 2005.
