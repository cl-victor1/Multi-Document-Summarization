KMT TO PROMOTE 'ANTI-CORRUPTION' REFERENDUM: PARTY CHAIRMAN
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  May 23 (CNA) 05/23/07  17:38:10 (By Deborah Kuo)

Opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Wu Poh-hsiung said Wednesday
that the KMT fully supports the Taipei city government's decision
to name the plaza in front of the Presidential Office as the
"Anti-Corruption Square."
</P>
<P>
The KMT will also push for a nationwide referendum on the anti-
corruption issue, aimed at eradicating corruption from public
office and retrieving national funds and assets that have been
appropriated by ranking officials, Wu said.
</P>
<P>
Taipei Mayor Hau Lung-bin confirmed a day earlier that the Taipei
city council passed an extraordinary motion earlier that day,
changing  the  name  of  the Ketagalan  Boulevard  plaza  to
"Anti-Corruption Square," effective immediately.
</P>
<P>
However, Ma Ying-jeou, Hau's predecessor and the KMT candidate
for the 2008 presidential election, said later that day that Hau
did not change the name of Ketagalan Boulevard but only added a
"supplementary name" in parentheses to let people know that the
road section in front of the Presidential Office can also be
called "Anti-Corruption Square."
</P>
<P>
Welcoming the name change, KMT Secretary-General Wu Den-yi said
the city council's decision is not only "very creative " but also
reflects what he claimed is "the people's" disappointment with
and resentment toward President Chen Shui-bian.
