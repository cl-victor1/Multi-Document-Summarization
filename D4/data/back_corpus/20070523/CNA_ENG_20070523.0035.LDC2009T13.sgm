The Center for Disease Control (CDC) alerted the public Wednesday
to an expanding epidemic of measles in eastern Japan.
</P>
<P>
Travelers with children should make sure the children have been
inoculated against measles. If they display symptoms of fever,
red spots on body and conjunctivitis after returning from Japan,
they should tell doctors they have been to Japan, CDC officials
advised.
</P>
<P>
The CDC publicized statistics compiled by Japan's National
Institute of Infectious Diseases showing that the number of
reported measles cases has increased to 467 in Japan's eastern
area so far this year, with one-third of the patients children
aged between 10-14, a new record high.
</P>
<P>
Notably, the number of measles patients aged above 15 continues
to grow, with 155 cases having so far been reported, and nearly
half of the patients living in Tokyo, according to the tallies,
which also display that the disease is infecting 20-24-year-old
adults with weak immunization.
</P>
<P>
CDC Vice Director-General Lin Ting pointed out that Japan only
gave inoculation of one dose of measles vaccine to children aged
1-7 upon parents' demand until April 2006, when the inoculation
was expanded to two doses of combined measles and rubella
vaccine.
</P>
<P>
The CDC speculated that the epidemic might have been caused by a
low inoculation rate and the fact that the measles virus can
still affect people who receive only one dose of measles
vaccination, Lin said.
</P>
<P>
In Taiwan, mandatory inoculation for measles began in 1978. Since
1997, all children have had to be inoculated with two doses of
combined vaccine for rubella, measles and mumps, Lin said, noting
that thanks to the mandatory measure, the inoculation rate has
been at the level above 95 percent in Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
The symptoms of measles include fever, coughing, runny nose and
conjunctivitis. Patients are prone to otitis media, pneumonia and
encephalitis, according to Lin.
