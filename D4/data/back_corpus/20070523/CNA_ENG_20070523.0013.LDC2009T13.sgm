<P>
The Council of Labor Affairs (CLA) has come up with a draft
package of amendments to the Labor Pension Act which, if enacted,
will extend the portable labor insurance program to cover self-
employed individuals, officials said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
According to the portable labor pension system that took effect
July 1, 2005, employed people who pay a portion of their monthly
salaries to set up individual retirement accounts can receive a
monthly pension of at least NT$3,000 after they retire at the age
of 60.
</P>
<P>
As a large number of people are not employed by any company or
organization, the officials said, the CLA plans to amend the
labor pension rules to allow those who do not have stable or
permanent employment to join the new labor pension program.
</P>
<P>
According to the CLA-proposed amendments, the officials said,
taxi drivers, street vendors and SOHO (small office, home office)
business operators will be included in the labor pension
expansion plan.
</P>
<P>
An estimated 1.4 million people in those categories are expected
to benefit from the proposed revisions, the officials said,
adding that self-employed people will be encouraged to take part
in the pension program and regularly deposit up to six percent of
their monthly wages to establish their retirement accounts.
</P>
<P>
Like other wage earners covered in the program, the officials
said, those who are self-employed will receive subsidies from the
government which will remit funds by proportion into their
accounts.
</P>
<P>
The self-employed insurance policy holders will be able to get a
monthly payment from the age of 60 if they have paid insurance
premiums for a required minimum period of years.
</P>
<P>
Noting that extending the pension coverage to self-employed
people is in line with the government's policy of providing
better care and benefits for the elderly as the country's
population is aging, the officials said, the new measure will
help provide a financial safety net for those who do not have
stable jobs.
</P>
<P>
According to the officials, the proposed amendments are still in
the initial stage, pending further discussion by a CLA review
committee. More detailed regulations need to be fleshed out
before the package is submitted to the Executive Yuan for
approval, after which the package will be referred to the
Legislative Yuan for ratification, the officials added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the officials said the amendment package also includes
draft revisions aimed at allowing those who have not paid a
sufficient amount in premiums to take out a lump-sum payment upon
retirement instead of receiving a monthly pension.
</P>
<P>
As of late March, the officials said, 4.31 million wage earners
had joined the portable pension program. In the past, insured
wage earners could only receive a lump-sum pension payment upon
their retirement.
