Ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) Chairman Yu Shyi-kun
said Wednesday that he is mulling whether to invite Vice
President Annette Lu and former Premier Su Tseng-chang to serve
as at-large legislators.
</P>
<P>
Yu said the appointments would help boost the party's solidarity
and its chances of winning the year-end legislative elections.
</P>
<P>
But he added that he had yet to inquire about the intentions of
Su and Lu. The appointments would also have to be approved by a
nomination committee that will be formed at the end of this month
with Yu serving as convener.
</P>
<P>
Noting that after the party's bitter presidential primary May 6,
in which former Premier Frank Hsieh defeated three other DPP
heavyweights -- Su, Lu and Yu himself-- he said that if both Lu
and Su would agree to serve as at-large legislators, it would
help mend fences.
</P>
<P>
As only solidarity will help election victory, he said, it would
also help the party's goal of achieving a majority in the next
legislature, which will adopt the "single-member constituency,
two votes" electoral system and halve the number of legislative
seats to 113, Yu added.
</P>
<P>
He cited Lu especially, saying that the Harvard-educated vice
president has a broad perspective and is a trailblazer of
Taiwan's feminism. If Lu ranks top of the party's at-large
legislative seats, it will definitely boost the party's chance in
winning elections, Yu said.
</P>
<P>
The new legislature will have 73 regional legislators, six
aboriginal representatives and 34 seats for at-large and overseas
expatriate representatives.
</P>
<P>
According to DPP regulations, two thirds of the at-large
legislative seats will be filled by those who are ahead in the
party's legislative primary, while one- third will be designated
by the party chairman although those designated will still have
to be approved by the party's screening committee.
</P>
<P>
DPP officials have said that while Yu is thinking of placing Lu
and Su on the "safe list" of those who will be ensured a berth in
the legislative elections, he will put himself at 18th or 19th
place in the hope that the move will solicit wider public support
for the DPP.
</P>
<P>
The at-large legislative seats will be awarded in accordance with
the ratio of ballots each political party garners in the
legislative elections.
