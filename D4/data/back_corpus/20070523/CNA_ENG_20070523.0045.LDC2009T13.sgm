Taipei, May 23 (CNA) 05/23/07  21:27:13 (By Han Nai-kuo)
</P>
<P>
The military painted a rosy picture of its combat ability
Wednesday, giving high scores to the performances by the armed
forces in the 23rd annual Han Kuang military exercises, but
lawmakers of both the ruling and opposition parties apparently
were less than happy.
</P>
<P>
After giving a report at a meeting of the Legislative Yuan's
National Defense Committee on the exercises that took place May
11-17 at Hukou in Hsinchu County, Adm. Wang Li-shen, a deputy
chief of the general staff, was asked to evaluate the performance
of the armed forces.
</P>
<P>
Wang said he would give the army, the navy and the air force each
a score of 90 out of 100 points.
</P>
<P>
However, Legislator  Ho Min-hao  of the opposition  Taiwan
Solidarity Union pointed out that the air force aircraft taking
part in the exercise demonstrated insufficient ability in missile
firing and said the commander of the navy fleet and the jet
fighter pilots should improve their communication.
</P>
<P>
Lin Yu-fang, a legislator of the opposition Kuomintang, noted
that in the anti- submarine exercise, Taiwan's four submarines
were unharmed mainly because National Defense University, which
is not familiar with China's submarine warfare strategy, acted as
the attacking force.
</P>
<P>
Lin pointed out that two Hawk surface-to-air missiles failed to
hit their targets, while pilotless target aircraft crashed into
the sea, showing that there were serious management problems.
</P>
<P>
Hsueh Ling, a legislator of the ruling Democratic Progressive
Party, also pointed out that four soldiers were killed during the
live-fire exercise.
</P>
<P>
"You gave three 90-point scores. How can this be justified? Is
there something wrong with the Ministry of National Defense? " he
asked.
