Premier Su Tseng-chang ordered the Ministry of Transportation and
Communications (MOTC) Wednesday to plan in advance for traffic
congestion that may arise during the nine-day Lunar New Year
holiday.
</P>
<P>
At a regular cabinet meeting, Su said as this year's Lunar New
Year holiday will last nine days, and the weather is forecast to
be fairer at that time, so it is expected that traffic will be
heavy.
</P>
<P>
In addition to reminding MOTC officials to make plans for traffic
beforehand, Su also expressed his gratitude to those government
officials who will remain on duty during the Lunar New Year
holiday, the most important annual family reunion for ethnic
Chinese people.

<P>
Meanwhile, Su expressed appreciation to Minister of Finance Ho
Chih-chin for his decision to continue the services at customs
offices around the country  during Lunar New Year holiday to
facilitate Taiwan's exports to foreign countries.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Su also ordered related government agencies to
thoroughly plan for the provision of medical services, garbage
disposal, and law enforcement during the festival.
