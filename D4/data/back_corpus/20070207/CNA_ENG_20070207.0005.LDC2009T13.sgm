results of an annual survey released Tuesday by an international
human resources organization.

The survey, conducted by ECA International, forecast an average
of 3.6 percent in real salary increase -- a worker's actual
salary increase after inflation is taken into account -- for the
Asian region in 2007, up approximately 50 percent from 2006 and
well above the global average.

Among the 45 economies surveyed, the five highest real wage
increases for 2007 are all expected to occur in Asia, with India
topping the list with projected real salary increases of 7
percent, according to the survey.

Rounding out the top-five list are Indonesia and China, with
projected real salary increases of approximately 6 percent each,
as well as the Philippines and Thailand, with projected increases
of 4 percent each.

Real salary increases in Japan, Taiwan, South Korea and Malaysia
are expected to range between 2 percent and 3.5 percent, and
those in Hong Kong are forecast to be 1.5 percent.

Slovakia and Russia are the two economies outside Asia that are
expected to see the highest real wage increases in 2007,
according to the survey.

Meanwhile, real wage increases in Argentina, Hungary, Germany,
New Zealand and Spain are expected to register below 1 percent,
the lowest among the 45 economies surveyed, while real wage
increases in the United States are forecast to be 1.1 percent.
