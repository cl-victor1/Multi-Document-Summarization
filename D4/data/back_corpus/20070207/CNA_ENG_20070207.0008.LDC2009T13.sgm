OVER 1.2 MILLION PEOPLE CONSIDERED SUICIDE IN 2006: SURVEY
</HEADLINE>

Taipei, Feb. 7 (CNA) 02/07/07  14:18:26 (By Elizabeth Hsu)
</P>
<P>
A total of 1.42 million people around Taiwan thought about ending
their own life in 2006, with more than 410,000 actually
attempting suicide, according to the results of a survey released
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The survey on the mental health of the Taiwan people was
conducted by the Mental Health Foundation in November on 1,122
adults from cities and counties around Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
In the survey, the Taiwan people received a score of 82.63 points
on their general mental health, with 100 points indicating
perfect mental health. The score marked an improvement over the
figure of 80.2 points in a similar survey by the foundation a
year earlier.
</P>
<P>
The scores for the four major indicators used to calculate the
overall mental health of the people -- namely "mental and
physical health, " "individual value, " "life control" and
"family health" -- also increased over the figures recorded in
the year-earlier survey, according to the private foundation.
</P>
<P>
However, the results on the two survey questions on whether the
respondent has thought about committing suicide and whether the
respondent has actually attempted suicide have triggered concerns
among experts at the foundation.
</P>
<P>
Yang Tsung-tsai, head of the mental health center of Taipei-based
Cardinal Tien Hospital and convener of the foundation's team in
charge of health indicator affairs, said that based on the survey
results, about 130,000 people around the nation attempted suicide
at least twice in 2006.
</P>
<P>
"These people need care, " Yang said, noting that the survey
results also revealed that care shown by family and friends are
crucial in maintaining one's mental health.
</P>
<P>
Yang explained that work-related and financial pressures as well
as trouble in intimate relationships are some of the main reasons
leading people to consider suicide, adding that people with the
healthiest minds tend to be those that share their thoughts with
others.
