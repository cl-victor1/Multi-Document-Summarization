'SUGAR CHIP' CAN DETECT CANCER IN ONE SECOND

Powerful "sugar chips" developed by incumbent Academia Sinica
President Wong Chi-huey and his U.S. research team for tracking
protein glycosylation have been confirmed to be capable of
detecting cancer within one second.
</P>
<P>
Powerful sugar probes and sugar chips that were developed by Wong
and researchers from the Scripps Research Institute four years
ago were confirmed recently to be capable of detecting not only
cancer within one second with a 100 percent accuracy but also the
HIV virus and avian flu virus, the Academia Sinica ENews reported
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The details of the innovative "sugar chips" -- which have great
potential for industrial use as high-throughput diagnostic tools
for the analysis of post- translational protein glycosylation in
disease states -- were published online in the internationally-
renowned journal Nature Protocols Jan. 31. They are also
scheduled to appear in the Proceedings of the National Academy of
Sciences of the United States of America Feb. 5.
</P>
<P>
According to Wong, who is the most-cited chemist worldwide
working in the area of enzymes and who assumed the post of
Academia Sinica president last October, more than 80 percent of
human proteins have sugars called glycoproteins attached to them,
and the process of protein glycosylation is known to play a
central role in mediating protein function in living organisms.
</P>
<P>
Noting that altered glycosylation is often associated with
inflammation  and cancer  metastasis,  Wong said  the detailed
correlation between glycosylation and biological or pathological
status may provide information for diagnosis and treatment of
diseases, particularly cancers.
</P>
<P>
He added that by spreading a drop of human blood on the "sugar
chip, " the researchers can almost instantly determine what kind
of cancer the patient is suffering from.
</P>
<P>
Wong, who has been a professor of chemistry with the Scripps
Research Institute, has pioneered work on the development of
effective enzymes and the design of novel substrates and
processes for large-scale organic synthesis.
</P>
<P>
The methods and strategies that Wong has developed have made
possible synthetic transformations that are otherwise impossible
or impractical, especially in areas vitally important in biology
and medicine, and have pointed the way toward new green
methodologies for use in large-scale chemistry.
