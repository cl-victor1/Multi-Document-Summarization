Researchers at Academia Sinica's Genomics Research Center have
developed two new "sugar probes" that can target abnormal
proteins in cancer cells to facilitate studies on cancer
metastasis, academic sources said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The research team led by Academia Sinica President Wong Chi-huey,
includes postdoctoral research fellow Hsu Tsui-ling and staff at
the Scripps Research Institute in the United States.

Scientists  have long known that proteins transmit genetic
information from cell to cell. If the protein responsible for
relaying information related to cancer metastasis can be spotted,
then researchers might be able to stop the metastasis by blocking
the protein. However, there are tens of thousands of proteins in
the human body, making tracking a specific one like looking for a
needle in a haystack.
</P>
<P>
However, Wong explained, the team has found that metastasis-
related proteins tend to combine with certain types of
carbohydrates, so they made two probes out of trehalose and
sialic acid analog to "trap" the proteins.
</P>
<P>
The team has also deployed agide compounds to mark those proteins
combined with the probes, facilitating the examination process.
</P>
<P>
In the process, they discovered the protein, Wong said. However,
further analysis and research is needed to better understand its
characteristics and the therapy to stop the metastasis.
