</HEADLINE>

Washington, Feb. 6 (CNA) 02/07/07  19:03:04 (By Lin Chiehyu and
Lilian Wu)

<P>
Taiwan has been communicating every day with the United States on
the case of Wang You-theng, fugitive founder of the Rebar Asia
Pacific Group, Republic of China Representative to the United
States David Ta-wei Lee said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Lee made the remarks while attending a party to mark the fifth
anniversary of the inauguration of the U.S. Congressional Taiwan
Caucus, a pro-Taiwan group in the House of Representatives.
</P>
<P>
Lee said Taiwan and the United States are cooperated closely on
the case and that both sides "have communicated daily on the case
to exchange views."
</P>
<P>
Asked when a U.S. court hearing on Wang's case will be set and
how Taiwan prosecutors traveling to the United States will
cooperate with U.S. judicial officials, Lee said only that the
case "has entered judicial process, and that it is not
appropriate for me to comment on the case."
</P>
<P>
Wang, wanted in Taiwan for his suspected involvement in a series
of fraud, accounting and embezzlement scandals surrounding his
business group, is in the custody of U.S. immigration officials.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan put Wang on its most-wanted list in mid-January. He tried
to fly to Myanmar via Singapore last Wednesday but was sent back
to the United States last Friday by Singaporean authorities as he
lacked the proper travel documents.
</P>
<P>
Wang arrived in Los Angeles Saturday and was taken into custody
because his Taiwan and Dominican Republic passports were invalid
as a result of efforts by the Taiwan authorities.
</P>
<P>
In related development in Taiwan, prosecutors continued their
probe into the case, summoning nine defendants in detention for
more questioning Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Fifty-one people related to the Rebar scandal have been listed as
defendants so far, 13 of whom have been detained. The number of
people related to the case barred from leaving the country has
increased to 91.
