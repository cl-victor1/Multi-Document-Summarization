The Central Taiwan Science Park recorded stunning growth last
year with its annual revenues reaching NT$178.5 billion (US$5.42
billion), nearly three times the NT$60.09 billion recorded in
2005, park officials said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Officials attributed the rapid increase to manufacturers newly
stationed in the park that began operations over last year; such
operations helped boost year-end revenues by more than NT$50
billion over the original estimate of NT$120 billion.
</P>
<P>
The officials estimated that the revenues of the park could
continue to climb to the NT$240 billion mark this year.
