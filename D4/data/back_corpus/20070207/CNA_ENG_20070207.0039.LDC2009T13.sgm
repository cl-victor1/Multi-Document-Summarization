U.S., TAIWAN OFFICIALS SHARE OPINIONS ON TIFA ACHIEVEMENTS

Washington, Feb. 6 (CNA) 02/07/07  20:31:35 (By Elizabeth Hsu)
</P>
<P>
U.S. and Taiwan officials recognize that the U.S.-Taiwan Trade
and Investment Framework Agreement (TIFA) is "the best platform"
for efforts to promote cooperation between the two sides in the
fields of trade and investment, although they share differing
opinions on the issue of a free trade accord (FTA).
</P>
<P>
A workshop on the proposed U.S.-Taiwan FTA was held Monday at the
Brookings Institute in Washington, D.C., with Richard Bush,
director of the Center for Northeast Asian Policy Studies of the
think tank and a former chairman of the American Institute in
Taiwan presiding over the talks.
</P>
<P>
The event drew the participation of Eric Altbach, the deputy
assistant U.S. trade representative, and U.S.-Taiwan Business
Council Chairman Rupert Hammond- Chambers, as well as Vice
Minister of Economic Affairs Shih Yen-shiang, Taiwan's Deputy
Representative to the U.S. John C.C. Deng and Taiwan Thinktank
Chairman Chen Po-chih.
</P>
<P>
During the talks, Shih voiced Taiwan's desire to forge an FTA,
saying that Taiwan needs to reinforce its cooperative
relationship with the U.S.
</P>
<P>
Chen said that while Taiwan faces political suppression by China
in the international society, economically the nation has also
been seen to have an increasing reliance on the Chinese market.
The imbalance in both politics and economics will damage the
common strategic interests of the U.S. and Taiwan, the economist
warned, adding that an FTA would get rid of the imbalance.
</P>
<P>
Chen urged Washington to realize the urgency of the issue.
</P>
<P>
Echoing Chen's remarks, Deng said that the two countries need to
take steps to integrate resources in the U.S.-Taiwan cooperation
mechanism and that with Taiwan's great efforts to seek economic
upgrading, it would be beneficial for the U.S. to sign an FTA
with Taiwan.  In response to the call, most of the American
participants pointed out that Taiwan is not listed among the
countries in the process of FTA talks with the U.S. trade and
investment departments.
</P>
<P>
While the United States has always believed Taiwan is motivated
by political need rather than economic interest in its bid for an
FTA, the U.S. enterprise sector has expressed hope that Taiwan
first lift limitations against trade between the two sides across
the Taiwan Strait and push for direct cross-strait transport
links, the U.S. experts said, with Altbach suggesting that the
two nations concentrate their energies on talks under the TIFA.
</P>
<P>
Altbach said there has been great progress in previous rounds of
U.S.-Taiwan TIFA talks in past years on many issues, including
those concerning intellectual property rights protection,
agricultural trade opening, modernization of the financial
industry and pharmaceutical trading controls.
</P>
<P>
The TIFA was signed between the American Institute in Taiwan and
the Taipei Economic and Cultural Representative Office in the
United States in 1994 to resolve bilateral trade issues and
enhance economic cooperation in the absence of formal diplomatic
relations between the two countries.
