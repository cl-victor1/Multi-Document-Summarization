Prominent foreign dignitaries and curators, including former
French Primie Minister Michel Rocard, have been invited to attend
a ceremony marking the reopening of the National Palace Museum
slated for Thursday, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs reported
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Inviting some two dozens of foreign officials and museum experts
to Taiwan to witness the reopening of the National Palace Museum
after the museum's nearly- three-year remodeling is part of the
Foreign Ministry's efforts to expand Taiwan's influence in the
international community via the cultural front, ministry
officials said.
</P>
<P>
The invited guests -- also including Gambian Tourism and Cultural
Minister Angela Colley; Stephane Martin, curator of Museum Quai
Branly of France; and Emily J. Sano, director of the Asian Art
Museum of San Francisco -- are also expected to pay a visit to
the high-profile exhibition "Grand View: Painting, Calligraphy,
Ju Ware and Rare Books from the Northern Sung Dynasty" which the
National Palace Museum has organized to mark its official
reopening Feb. 8.
</P>
<P>
Culture and the cultural development models from the Sung Dynasty
(960-1279) have tremendously  influenced  the world's cultural
development and the collections of Sung Dynasty artifacts happen
to be among the most pivotal collections of the National Palace
Museum, which is considered the world's leading Chinese art
treasures.
</P>
<P>
The three-month Grand View exhibition, which is scheduled to end
March 25, showcases a total of 42 paintings and 29 pieces of
calligraphy dating from the Northern Sung period (960-1127), as
well as five Northern Sung paintings and calligraphy works on
loan from the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York and the
Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art in Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
Also on display are Ju ceramic wares of the Northern Sung period,
fired in the early 12th century, which are renowned for the
classical beauty of their warm and glossy sky-blue glaze.
Surviving pieces of Ju ware are extremely rare, with less than 70
found in collections around the world today. The National Palace
Museum is fortunate to have 21, the most of any collection.
</P>
<P>
Renowned for its impressive collection of art works of the Sung
Dynasty, the museum is putting its collection of Sung Dynasty
artifacts in its entirety on display for the first and possibly
the last time due to the fragility of the art works. The museum
is known for its unique collection of some 654,500 imperial art
treasures brought to Taiwan at the end of the Chinese civil war
in 1949 to keep them out of the hands of the communists and Mao
Zedong's Red Guard.
