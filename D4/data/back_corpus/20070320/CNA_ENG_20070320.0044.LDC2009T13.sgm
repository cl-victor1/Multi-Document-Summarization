Foreign direct investment in Taiwan during the first two months
of this year amounted to US$437.90 million, marking a phenomenal
decrease of 77.28 percent year-on-year, the Investment Commission
under the Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) announced Monday.
</P>
<P>
A total of 238 direct investment applications filed by foreign
conglomerates and overseas businesses operated by ethnic Chinese
or Taiwan  expatriates  were approved  during the January-
February period, according to an Investment Commission official.
</P>
<P>
The official attributed the decrease in foreign direct investment
mainly to Dutch conglomerate Philips' sale of its Taiwan
subsidiary's stake in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Corp. If
the transaction is excluded from the amount, the value of foreign
direct investment during the first two months would mark an
impressive growth of 162.98 percent year-on-year, the official
said.

<P>
Meanwhile, 155 China-bound investment projects for a total amount
of US$1.22 billion were approved during the January-February
period, up 33.6 percent year- on-year, according to the official.

As for overseas investment outside China, the official said the
Investment Commission gave the green light to 51 investment
projects for a total amount of US$266.78 million, an increase of
64.64 percent over the year-earlier level.
