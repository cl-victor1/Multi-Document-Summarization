AEC INTRODUCES NEW SPENT-FUEL SOLIDIFICATION METHOD

A new method of spent-fuel solidification has been introduced to
process radioactive waste from Taiwan's second nuclear power
plant, reducing the volume of waste by up to 65% in 2006,
officials of the Atomic Energy Council said Tuesday.

Huang Ching-tsuen,  deputy director  of the Nuclear Safety
Technology Center under AEC's Institute of Nuclear Energy
Research (INER), said that up until mid-2006, the spent fuel from
the boiling water reactors at the second nuclear power plant had
been solidified with cement; however, this method results in a
large volume of waste, and waste storage has increasingly became
a problem after years in operation.

He noted that INER started establishing the new "high-efficiency
solidification system" at the second nuclear power plant in 2002,
and after three and a half years, the AEC is finally permitting
the facility to bring the system fully online.

According to INER tallies, the number of drums put into storage
dropped to 107 in 2006 from 387 in 2005, representing a reduction
of 72.35%. The new system alone contributed to a reduction of
248.8 drums, while a second, separate waste production control
program decreased the volume by a further 31.2 drums.

A parallel method -- "Pressurized Water Reactor High-Efficiency
Solidification Technology" -- was put into effect at the third
nuclear power plant a couple of years ago, AEC officials said,
adding that the annual output of radioactive waste has since been
reduced to a minimum of 25 drums per year, which number is the
lowest rate among all pressurized water reactors in the world.
