The Cabinet-level Council of Agriculture (COA) plans to
appropriate NT$150 million (US$4.5 million) from an Executive
Yuan-operated fund this year to promote agricultural development
on the Taiwan-held outlying islands, including Penghu, Kinmen and
Matsu, COA officials said Tuesday.

The COA officials explained efforts will be made to increase the
incomes of local farmers and fishermen by assisting them in
