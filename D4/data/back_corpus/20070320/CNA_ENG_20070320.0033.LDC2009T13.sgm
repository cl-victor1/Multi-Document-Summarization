TOP ENVOY-DESIGNATE TO U.S. GOOD FOR BILATERAL TIES: OFFICIAL

Taipei,  March 20 (CNA) 03/20/07  19:44:48 (By Luis Huang)

Taiwan's top representative-designate to the United States,
Joseph Wu, will be better able to "precisely and efficiently"
convey President Chen Shui-bian's ideas on bilateral relations to
the U.S. government after assuming his post, an official of the
Presidential Office said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Wu, who currently serves as chairman of the Cabinet-level
Mainland Affairs Council, the top agency in charge of drafting
Taiwan's China policy, will replace David Ta-wei Lee as Taiwan's
top envoy to the U.S., while Lee will be transferred to Canada to
serve as the nation's representative there.
</P>
<P>
China, deeply aware that the U.S. seeks its support to address
the nuclear weapons proliferation problem with North Korea and
Iran, has changed its strategy toward Taiwan by squeezing
Taiwan's international maneuvering space via the United States,
so the appointment of Taiwan's top representative to the U.S. is
of great importance, according to the official.
</P>
<P>
The official said that since Wu is familiar with cross-Taiwan
Strait  policy, Taiwan-U.S.  relations  and  the  government's
decision-making mechanism, he is competent to serve as the
nation's top envoy to the United States.
</P>
<P>
The official further said Wu's new position was determined in
early February and that the government informed the Washington
authorities about his appointment Feb. 17, with the U.S.
expressing its consent March 18.
</P>
<P>
Asked who will be Wu's successor after he assumes his new post,
the official said the government is still looking for a suitable
candidate.
</P>
<P>
Saying that the next MAC head should be familiar with the
government's cross- strait policy and related issues, the
official said the government will not rule out selecting a
candidate from the administrative system or the academic sector.
