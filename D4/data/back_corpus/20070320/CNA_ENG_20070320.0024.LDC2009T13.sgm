Over one-quarter of Taiwanese suffer from sleep problems or
insomnia, with more women being troubled than men, according to a
survey unveiled Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Taiwan Society of Sleep Medicine found that 25.5 percent of
Taiwan people, or 4.8 million, have sleep problems, according to
a survey of 4,011 people over 15 years of age.
</P>
<P>
The survey showed that more and more Taiwanese people are
troubled by lack of sleep, with 24.8 percent reporting some
manner of sleep disorder, and 11.5 percent suffering from chronic
insomnia, which translates into more than one in every 10 people
having serious difficulties sleeping on a regular basis.
</P>
<P>
For women, problems associated with sleeping are even more
common. 30 percent of women reportedly have trouble going to
sleep, but that number is far higher among women undergoing
menopause: more than half of women aged 50-59 reporting sleep
problems due to menopause, the survey found.
</P>
<P>
In addition, 20.2 percent of women reported short-term insomnia
during their monthly menstrual cycles and 26 percent of women
have trouble sleeping during pregnancy because of hormonal
changes.
</P>
<P>
Doctor Hsu Shih-chieh of Chang Gung Memorial Hospital in Linko,
Taipei County said that if people have trouble sleeping for more
than one month, they may be suffering from chronic insomnia and
should seek assistance from a physician.
</P>
<P>
He also noted that long-term insomnia is a major risk factor for
depression.
