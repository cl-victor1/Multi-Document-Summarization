Thanks to strenuous efforts by the government to create more job
opportunities, the jobless rate for 2007 is forecast to drop to
below 3.8 percent, an official with the Cabinet-level Council for
Economic Planning and Development (CEPD) said Tuesday.

According to the official, the CEPD approved a new job creation
plan for 2007 at a council meeting, during which officials from
relevant government agencies delivered reports on employment-
boosting results obtained in 2006.

Under the new job creation plan, the government will seek to add
around 71,000 job opportunities this year, the official pointed
out, adding that the Council of Labor Affairs (CLA) will also
redouble its employment matchmaking efforts to help the jobless
land positions.

Thanks to various job programs offered by related government
agencies, including the CLA and the Ministry of Economic Affairs,
a total of 72,000 employment opportunities were created last
year, thereby reducing the jobless rate by 0.18 percentage
points, the official said.

The official said that the nation's unemployment rate for 2006
dropped to 3.91 percent last year, marking a six-year low.
