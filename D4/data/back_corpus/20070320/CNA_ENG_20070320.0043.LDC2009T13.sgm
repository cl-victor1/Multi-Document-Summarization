CROSS-STRAIT EXCHANGES MIGHT REDUCE ANTAGONISM: KMT FORMER CHIEF
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,   March  20  (CNA) 03/20/07  21:19:47 (By Elizabeth Hsu)

Former opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Ma Ying-jeou said
Tuesday that comprehensive exchanges between the two sides of the
Taiwan Strait could dissolve the hostility between Taiwan and
China.
</P>
<P>
Ma made the remarks in response to questions from participants in
a forum on Taiwan's industrial and technological development that
was organized in Taipei by Merrill Lynch Taiwan, a financial
management and advisory company. Ma was invited to deliver a
keynote speech at the event.
</P>
<P>
Addressing Beijing's Taiwan policy, Ma said there were several
different stages. In 1995, he stated, China adopted the "one
China, two systems" policy, which did not succeed in winning the
support of the Taiwan people. Two years latter, China stopped
talking about the policy or any ideas proposing unification in a
peaceful manner, he said, noting that now China's policy is
simply to prevent Taiwan from declaring independence.
</P>
<P>
Ma, seen by some as the KMT's best hope for the 2008 presidency,
said that when Taiwan held presidential elections in 1996 and
2000, China not only conducted missile tests as a military
threat, but also made unfriendly statements toward Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
However, in the 2004 presidential election, the communist regime
stopped doing so because Beijing understood that the best way to
cut the distance between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait is to
go through the U.S. government, the former Taipei mayor said,
adding that the situation is an opportunity for Taiwan to
"maintain, even strengthen" the cross-strait status quo.
</P>
<P>
Citing the results of various KMT polls, Ma said 60 percent of
the respondents thought China is unfriendly toward Taiwan before
KMT Honorary Chairman Lien Chan visited China two years ago while
only 15 percent thought of China as friendly.
</P>
<P>
After Lien's visit, the ratio who thought China is unfriendly
dropped to 40 percent, while that of those who thought China is
friendly increased to 30 percent. Based on these results, Ma
said, the two sides should conduct more mutual exchanges to
reduce antagonism and eventually achieve the goal of
normalization in cross-strait exchanges in various fields,
including trade and culture.
</P>
<P>
He said Chinese high school graduates should be invited to study
in Taiwan, explaining that this would be a good way for young
people on each side to get to know each other and make friends,
while Taiwan could also convey its ideas about promoting
democracy and freedom in China.
</P>
<P>
Ma said his proposal would help relax the political tension
between the two sides.
