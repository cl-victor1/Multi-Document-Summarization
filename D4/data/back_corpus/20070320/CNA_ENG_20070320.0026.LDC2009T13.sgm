The Taipei 101 Observatory has generated over NT$800 million
(US$24 million) in total revenue from sales of entrance tickets
and souvenirs since opening two years ago, a Taipei 101 executive
said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Taipei 101's Assistance Vice President Michael Liu said that
about NT$700 million in revenue came from the sale of more than 2
million tickets.
</P>
<P>
Another NT$100 million was due to sales of over 250 kinds of
souvenirs, including NT$2 million from 95 newly presented items
of the "Damper Baby" series developed in cooperation with Japan's
SANRIO Co.
</P>
<P>
Liu said Taipei 101 is the first department store in Taiwan to
develop its own souvenir series, and that its three top selling
souvenirs are miniature crystal 101 buildings, postcards,
T-shirts printed with the 101 logo and Damper dolls.
</P>
<P>
Souvenir sales have given Taipei 101 the confidence to press
forward with a new series of the "Damper Baby" in May. It is also
considering entering into souvenir design partnerships with local
and foreign individual designers or cultural organizations, Liu
said.
</P>
<P>
Finally, Taipei 101 may launch its own online souvenir shop in
the second half of this year to test the overseas market.
