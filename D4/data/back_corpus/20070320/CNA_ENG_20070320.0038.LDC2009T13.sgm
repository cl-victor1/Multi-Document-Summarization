Premier Su Tseng-chang said Tuesday that President Chen Shui-
bian's performance over the past seven years has been an asset,
not a liability, to the contenders of the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) bidding to represent the party in the
2008 presidential election.
</P>
<P>
"Of course we think it is an asset, otherwise how can we have
confidence in this election?" the premier asked.
</P>
<P>
Su made the remarks during an interpellation session at the
Legislative Yuan when DPP Legislator Lee Chun-yee asked whether
the performance of the president will be a plus or a minus to the
four presidential hopefuls -- Vice President Annette Lu, Premier
Su Tseng-chang, former Premier Frank Hsieh and DPP Chairman Yu
Shyi-kun.
</P>
<P>
The premier said Chen was the first president elected as a result
of the first transfer of power in Taiwan from one political party
to another in five decades. The president's push for reform has
"lived up to the expectations of the public," he claimed.
</P>
<P>
Although hampered by an opposition-dominant legislature, he went
on, the president still manages to achieve substantial results.
</P>
<P>
Talking about the president's coordination among the four DPP
heavyweights, which has not seen any tangible result, the premier
also said any decision made by Chen "cannot be forced upon the
hopefuls unless it has the consensus of all."
</P>
<P>
Chen has conducted two rounds of coordination among them, but Su
refused to comment on the main hurdle in seeking a breakthrough
before the party's primary mechanism is set in motion, saying
only that it was "not convenient" for him to say anything as he
is one of the parties involved.
</P>
<P>
According to the DPP's presidential nomination mechanism, a
primary election will be held only if the mediation and
coordination approach fails to produce a single candidate. If the
primary approach has to be adopted, the candidate will be
selected based on the results of a party member vote, which will
account for 30 percent of the score, and a series of public
opinion polls to test public support of each candidate, which
will account for 70 percent.
