LABOR COUNCIL TO REVIEW MINIMUM WAGE
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  March 20 (CNA) 03/20/07  11:35:15 (By Sofia Wu)

<P>
The Council of Labor Affairs (CLA) has made reviewing the
country's minimum wage one of its priority tasks for the current
fiscal year, CLA Vice Chairman Kuo Fang-yu said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
When CLA Chairman Lee Ying-yuan delivers a report on the
council's work agenda to the Legislative Yuan Wednesday, Kuo
said, he will assure lawmakers that the council will tackle the
minimum wage issue with a new vision and new thinking.
</P>
<P>
As the country's minimum wage rate has been frozen at NT$15,840
(US$480) per month -- which translates into NT$528 per day or
NT$66 per hour -- for 10 years, Kuo said it's time to make an
overall review and consider the feasibility of an adjustment.
</P>
<P>
According to Kuo, the current minimum hourly wage is especially
unreasonable. "While the legal work week has been cut to 84 hours
for two weeks from 90 hours since 2001, the minimum hourly wage
is still based on the previous eight-hour work day formula, " he
said, adding that the present hourly wage rate fails to reflect
the shortened work week for wage earners.
</P>
<P>
Against this backdrop, Kuo said, the present basic wage rate
requires review. To ensure fair treatment for hourly wage
earners, he added,  future adjustments should also take into
account the stipulation in the Labor Standards Law that wage
earners are entitled to paid regular days off and national
holidays.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Kuo said, the CLA has yet to reach a decision on
whether to adjust the basic wage rate and by how much.
</P>
<P>
In line with the CLA's work schedule, Kuo said, Lee will hold
talks with labor union leaders from around the country in the
coming weeks to exchange views on relevant issues. After those
sessions, the CLA's basic wage screening committee will meet to
discuss the feasibility  of an upward adjustment  and the most
reasonable adjustment range.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the CLA's minimum wage adjustment proposal, Vice
Economic Affairs Minister Shih Yen-hsiang said the business
community is reserved about such a move.
</P>
<P>
"The CLA will have to communicate with business and industry
executives to seek their support if it insists on going ahead
with the plan," Shih said, adding that the Ministry of Economic
Affairs is evaluating the possible impact on local industries of
an upward minimum wage adjustment.
</P>
<P>
The ministry will also study what the adjustment range should be
to minimize its possible adverse impact on local industries'
export competitiveness, Shih added.
