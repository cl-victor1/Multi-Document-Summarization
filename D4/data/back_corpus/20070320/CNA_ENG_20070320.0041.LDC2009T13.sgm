FORMER KMT CHIEF VOWS TO REVIVE TAIWAN ECONOMY IF ELECTED
PRESIDENT
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taipei,  March 20 (CNA) 03/20/07  20:40:54 (By Flor Wang)
</P>
<P>
Former main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Ma Ying-jeou
said Tuesday that he will prioritize Taiwan's economic issues if
elected president in the March 2008 presidential election.
</P>
<P>
Ma made the remarks while giving a keynote speech in English on
how to rejuvenate Taiwan's economy at a high-tech seminar held at
Merrill Lynch Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Ma, the best bet of the opposition "pan-blue alliance" of the KMT
and the People First Party (PFP) to pursue the next presidency,
said the government's severe restrictions on foreign-bound
investment, particularly  that  bound  for China, have  reduced
Taiwan's competitiveness.
</P>
<P>
According to Ma, Taiwan's private sector is strong but its
government sector is getting weak.
</P>
<P>
Under the rule of the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) , the
country is facing "three instabilities"  on the political and
government fronts as well as instability of its policies, Ma
said.
</P>
<P>
For example, he said, the "four wants, one without" remarks made
by President Chen Shui-bian last month regarding Taiwan's
sovereignty and cross-Taiwan Strait relations caused the local
bourse to nosedive. In addition, he went on, the government's
ongoing name change drive aimed at state-run enterprises and
facilities has sparked disputes but has not benefited the
economy.
</P>
<P>
Over the past seven years of Chen's presidency, there have been
five premiers and six finance ministers, not to mention policy
flip-flops and policies that the government has failed to carry
out, he said.
</P>
<P>
Ma vowed  to wipe out these  sorts of uncertainties  and
instabilities if he wins the 2008 presidential contest.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan will be left far behind by countries such as China,
Singapore, South Korea and India if it continues "hollowing out,
" he warned, adding that Taiwan will become an outcast in the
Asia-Pacific region should it fail to serve as a springboard for
multinational companies seeking to branch into China and other
Asian countries.
</P>
<P>
In response to press inquires about whether the current 40
percent cap on China- bound investment by Taiwan's publicly
listed companies will be removed if he were elected president, Ma
said it is a discussible matter and pointed out that many have
suggested that Taiwan should limit its technology flight rather
than capital outflow.
</P>
<P>
Ma, who stepped down from the KMT's top post in February,
announced his desire to run for president in 2008 despite his
indictment on corruption charges over allegedly embezzling from a
special municipal monthly allowance while serving as mayor of
Taipei from 1998-2006.
</P>
<P>
The former KMT chairman opened a presidential campaign office in
Taipei Sunday.
