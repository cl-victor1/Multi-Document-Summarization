MAYOR RESPONSIBLE FOR PULLING DOWN STATUE
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Kaohsiung,  March 20 (CNA) 03/20/07  16:44:09 (By Flor Wang)

Kaohsiung Mayor Chen Chu vowed Tuesday to take full
responsibility for the municipal authorities' decision to pull
down a statue of the late President Chiang Kai-shek at the city's
cultural center.
</P>
<P>
Chen made the remarks after the Kaohsiung City Council decided a
day earlier to hold an extra session from March 26 and March 27
to find out who is to blame for the March 13 demolition of the
statue at the Kaohsiung Chiang Kai-shek Cultural Center.
</P>
<P>
The Kaohsiung City's decision to dismantle the huge statue and
remove  a plague bearing  Chiang's  name  stirred  up strong
dissatisfaction on the Kaohsiung City Council, which criticized
the move as "too rash" and called the process "flawed."
</P>
<P>
Pointing out that she is fully aware of the difficulties inherent
in handling such an historical event, Chen said that she looks
forward to having an opportunity to explain why she decided to
have the statue dismantled.
</P>
<P>
According to Kaohsiung City Council Speaker Chuang Chi-wang, the
Kaohsiung City Government's cultural affairs bureau failed to
live up to a promise made last year to the council that it would
hold a public hearing to assess the issue before deciding to
demolish the statue.
</P>
<P>
Stressing that the statue was public property which may not be
destroyed by executive fiat alone, Chuang stressed that it is the
council's responsibility to scrutinize municipal operations and
thus it decided to call the extra session to look into the
matter.
</P>
<P>
The council has demanded that Chen, cultural affairs bureau
director Wang Chih- cheng and police department chief Tsai I-jen
to attend the extra session to answer their questions, according
to Chang.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the more than 200 pieces of Chiang's statue were
transported to Tahsi township, northern Taoyuan County, where his
mausoleum is located.
</P>
<P>
According to Tahsi township officials, it will be difficult to
reconstruct the statue now that it has been so badly broken.
</P>
<P>
In response to queries about the difficulties of rebuilding the
statue from a main opposition Kuomintang lawmaker during a
question period, Premier Su Tseng- chang said earlier in the day
in Taipei at the Legislative  Yuan that it is within  the
Kaohsiung  City Government's powers to decide whether to keep or
tear down the statue.
</P>
<P>
"It is a normal development in an emerging democracy for statues
of past dictators to be pulled down, " Su said, adding that "he
respects the Kaohsiung City Government's authority to do so."
