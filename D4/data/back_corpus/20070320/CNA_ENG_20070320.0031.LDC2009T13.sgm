KMT RESOLUTELY OPPOSES '2ND REPUBLIC' CONSTITUTION
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taipei,  March  20 (CNA) 03/20/07  19:22:48 (By Deborah Kuo)
</P>
<P>
The main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) released a written statement
Tuesday saying that it is resolutely opposed to the draft "second
republic" constitution proposed by National Taiwan University
Professor Chen Ming-tong two days ago.
</P>
<P>
Yang Tu,  chairman  of the KMT Culture and Communications
Committee, blasted the draft constitution for its obvious
attempts to freeze the existing Republic of China Constitution
and initiate Taiwan independence by advocating a new "republic."
</P>
<P>
The draft constitution, which proposes that Taiwan change the
government from a semi-presidential to parliamentary system that
would allow legislators to assume half of the ministerial
positions in an administration, is a plot hatched to further the
ruling Democratic Progressive Party's (DPP's) chances of winning
the 2008 presidential election, Yang claimed.
</P>
<P>
Yang said it is ridiculous that the ruling DPP is scheming to
launch a new constitution, or eighth revision of the
constitution, before the seventh revision is even implemented.
</P>
<P>
If, indeed, the DPP administration considers constitutional
reforms to be an imperative, those reforms should be undertaken
after a new legislature and new president are elected, Yang said.
</P>
<P>
Besides, Yang said, President Chen's DPP administration has sunk
to record-low approval ratings of around 20 percent, and thus is
in no position to launch any kind of constitutional reform.
</P>
<P>
Yang went on that the draft "second republic" constitution is a
Taiwan independence  resolution  thinly camouflaged  by a new
constitution book cover. The move will not only invite war, it
cannot possibly win the support of the United States.
</P>
<P>
In addition, he said, the draft constitution's suggestion that
Taiwan strip the president of his powers and replace the office
with only a "nominal" president, elected by a 200-member
legislature in 2008, is tantamount to turning Taiwan into a
corrupt republic, where the important presidential election can
be manipulated by only a few people.
