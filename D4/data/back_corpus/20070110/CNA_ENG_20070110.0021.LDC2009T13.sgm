The government collected a total of NT$1.59 trillion (US$48.2
billion) in tax revenues last year, surpassing its target by
NT$124.9 billion, according to Ministry of Financial Affairs
(MOFA) tallies released Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The figure also represented growth of 1.8 percent over the 2005
level, for the third straight year of increase, according to the
MOFA tallies. Tax income in stock transactions posted the largest
year on year increase at 31.9 percent, while personal income tax
revenue also rose by 3.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
In comparison to the previous year, the government's corporate
tax revenue dipped by 1.5 percent, according to the MOFA tallies.
</P>
<P>
In December, tax revenue amounted to NT$82.8 billion, down by 5
percent compared to the year-earlier level, with corporate tax
revenue registering the largest year on year drop at NT$5.8
billion.
</P>
<P>
Fiscal experts warned that the decrease in corporate tax revenue
may be a sign of growing economic sluggishness in the domestic
market -- reflecting a lack of public confidence in Taiwan's
economy, as corporate tax revenue has always been one of the
government's most stable sources of income, rising every year
even during economic recessions.
</P>
<P>
Consumer spending is expected to further dwindle in 2007,
affecting the government's tax revenues for this year, the
experts predicted.
</P>
<P>
Lee Li-hsueh, director general of the MOFA's Department of
Statistics, ascribed the dwindling corporate tax revenue to the
credit card and cash card crunch last year.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the average tax burden rate on Taiwan's taxpayers also
decreased to 13.8 percent for 2006 from 14.1 percent in 2005.
