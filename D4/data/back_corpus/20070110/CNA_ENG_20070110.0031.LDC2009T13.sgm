THOSE RESPONSIBLE FOR CAUSING BANK RUNS WILL BE PUNISHED: VICE
PREMIER
</HEADLINE>

Taipei, Jan.  10 (CNA) 01/10/07  20:28:32 (By Han Nai-kuo)
</P>
<P>
The government will deal harshly with all unlawful behaviors that
have caused bank runs at the Chinese Bank in the past six days,
Vice Premier Tsai Ing-wen said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Tsai declared the Cabinet's determination at a late afternoon
press conference in the company of Financial Supervisory
Commission Chairman Shih Jun-ji, Minister of Justice Shih Mao-Lin
and Vice Minister of Economic Affairs Shih Yen- shiang.
</P>
<P>
She said the Cabinet will conduct a review to examine why
information obtained by certain government agencies about the
Chinese Bank's questionable financial condition was not passed to
other related departments in advance to prevent the bank runs.
</P>
<P>
Tsai acknowledged  there is much room for improvement  in
information sharing among government departments.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese Bank is owned by the financially distressed Rebar
Asia-Pacific Group.
</P>
<P>
The bank runs began Jan. 5 after the Taipei District Court
approved a restructuring request a day earlier by China Rebar Co.
and Chia Hsin Food &amp; Synthetic Fiber Co. -- two subsidiary
companies of Rebar Asia Pacific Group -- which became insolvent
after suffering losses totaling NT$25.2 billion over the past
seven years.
</P>
<P>
The government has asked the Central Deposit Insurance Corp. to
take over the troubled bank and used the Financial Restructuring
Fund -- also known as the Resolution Trust Corporation (RTC) fund
-- to cope with the crisis.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that by the end of Jan. 9, account holders had
withdrawn NT$43.08 billion (US$1.32 billion).
</P>
<P>
The vice premier took consolation from the fact that bank runs at
the Chinese Bank's 35 branches  throughout  Taiwan had eased as
of early Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
She noted that the number of account holders withdrawing money or
closing their accounts at the Chinese Bank dropped significantly
Wednesday, and that their cash withdrawal amounts were also much
smaller than in the past few days -- mostly in the range of tens
of thousands of New Taiwan dollars.
</P>
<P>
The bank runs and failure of related government regulatory
authorities to detect the poor financial condition of the Chinese
Bank in advance have prompted lawmakers of both the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party and the opposition Kuomintang and
People First Party to call for the minister of finance and
Financial Supervisory Commission chairman to step down.
</P>
<P>
The vice premier made assurances the Cabinet will find those
responsible for causing the bank runs and then take disciplinary
action to allay public anger.
