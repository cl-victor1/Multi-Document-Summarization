All past transactions between the failed Rebar Asia Pacific Group
and the Eastern Multimedia Group will be scrutinized thoroughly
to see if there were any irregularities, Shih Jun-ji,  chairman
of the Financial Supervisory Commission said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Although Eastern Multimedia Chairman Gary Wang declared his
company is totally independent from Rebar, which was founded by
his father Wang You-theng, Shih said ties between the two groups
will be examined and any irregularities prosecuted to the full
extent of law.
</P>
<P>
Two subsidiaries of the Rebar Group, the China Rebar Co. and Chia
Hsin Food and Synthetic Fiber Co. applied for bankruptcy
protection last Thursday and prompted a run on The Chinese Bank,
which is owned by the group.
</P>
<P>
Although the government-run Central Deposit Insurance Company
took over The Chinese Bank at the bank's request Friday night,
depositors scrambled to withdraw their savings from it.
</P>
<P>
Shih said the run subsided Wednesday after NT$43.08 billion
(US$1.31 billion) was withdrawn by anxious customers in three
business days until Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Although the Rebar group has failed in business,  Eastern
Multimedia Group is thriving and building a huge headquarters in
Taipei.
