Taipei,  Jan. 16 (CNA) 01/16/07  16:51:27 (By Elizabeth Hsu)

The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) is working to negotiate
with the U.S. government for possible judicial assistance in the
apprehension and repatriation of the founder of the troubled
Rebar Asia Pacific Group, MOFA spokesman David C.Y. Wang said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The MOFA has instructed its representative office in the United
States to obtain from Washington information about Rebar founder
Wang You-theng and his wife, Wang Chin Shih-ying, who both flew
to the United States from China Sunday. The couple allegedly fled
to the China Dec. 30 after two Rebar subsidiaries applied for
insolvency protection, triggering a financial tremors in Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
The Taipei District Prosecutors' Office formally issued wanted
notices for Wang You-theng and his wife Monday on charges of
embezzlement, insider trading and fraud. Acting on the notices,
the MOFA invalidated the Wangs' ROC passports and informed all
its overseas offices of the move.
</P>
<P>
David Wang confirmed at a routine press conference that Wang You-
theng and his wife are now in the United States. As to the
question of whether they hold U.S. passports, David Wang said the
MOFA is still working to check on the issue with the U.S.
government.
</P>
<P>
"It will take time, " David Wang said, noting that the MOFA hopes
to obtain an official answer from the United States soon.
</P>
<P>
Mentioning the fact that Taiwan does not maintain diplomatic ties
with the United States, David Wang said that it may be a
challenge to have the Wangs repatriated from the United States as
the two countries have not signed an extradition treaty.
</P>
<P>
However, he said that the MOFA has asked the U.S. government to
monitor whether the Wangs engage in any illegal activities, such
as money laundering, while on U.S. soil.
</P>
<P>
The Rebar group controls more than 100 subsidiaries and affiliate
businesses. The insolvency reorganization announcement of two of
its subsidiaries -- China Rebar Co. and China Hsin Food and
Synthetic Fiber Co. -- triggered a run on the Chinese Bank,
another Rebar affiliate, which lost NT$32 billion (US$977.3
million) in deposits in three days.
</P>
<P>
The bank run led to the exposure of the Rebar financial chaos,
which has triggered a domestic financial storm.
