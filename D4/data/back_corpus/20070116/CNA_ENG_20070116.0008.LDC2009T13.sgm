Taipei,  Jan. 16 (CNA) 01/16/07  13:08:13 (By Sofia Wu)
</P>
<P>
Premier Su Tseng-chang has ordered probes into financial dealings
between the troubled Rebar Asia Pacific Group and the Eastern
Multimedia Group which is headed by one of the sons of the Rebar
group founder, Cabinet spokesman Cheng Wen-tsang said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Su gave the directives at a Monday meeting of a special task
force handling the Rebar group fallout, Cheng said.
</P>
<P>
The interministerial meeting took place shortly after the Taipei
Prosecutor's Office issued wanted notices for the arrest of Rebar
group founder Wang You- theng and his wife, Chin Shih-ying, on
charges of embezzlement of corporate funds, insider trading and
fraud. The couple fled the country in late December.
</P>
<P>
According to Cheng, the premier also called for probes into the
personal assets and bank accounts of Eastern Multimedia Group
Chairman Gary Wang. While Rebar group, which controls 120-odd
enterprises, is cash-strapped, Eastern group has been thriving.
</P>
<P>
Cheng said the premier has reminded relevant authorities to see
to it that normal business operations of the two conglomerates
are not affected in the course of investigations.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) officials said the
passports of Wang You-theng and his wife have been invalidated at
the request of the Taipei Prosecutor's Office.
</P>
<P>
MOFA officials confirmed that the couple entered the United
States via San Francisco Saturday, with Wang using a Republic of
China passport and Chin using a U.S. passport.
</P>
<P>
Premier Su has instructed relevant officials to negotiate with
their counterparts at the American Institute in Taiwan (AIT)
Taipei Office for possible U.S. judicial assistance in the
apprehension of Wang and Chin.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan signed a judicial aid agreement with the United States in
March 2002, but the agreement does not cover extradition of
criminal suspects or convicts.
</P>
<P>
As Taiwan and the United States do not maintain formal diplomatic
ties and have not signed any extradition treaty, MOFA officials
said it won't be easy to repatriate the Wangs from the United
States. But they added that the possibility exists, particularly
if the Wangs are involved in money laundering on U.S. territory.
MOFA officials said the government will respect the U.S. decision
in this regard.
</P>
<P>
Following the revocation of their ROC passports, the Wangs will
face many restrictions on document verification and asset
transfer, the MOFA officials said.
</P>
<P>
Rebar's  financial  woes came to light after  two of its
subsidiaries -- China Rebar Co. and Chia Hsin Food and Synthetic
Fiber Co. --, applied for insolvency protection Dec. 29. Their
insolvency reorganization announcement prompted a run on the
Chinese Bank, another Rebar affiliate. The bank has since been
taken over by the state-run Central Deposit Insurance Corp.
</P>
<P>
Judicial probes into the group's suspected financial crimes
followed. Investigators have launched many rounds of large-scale
searches at Rebar's headquarters and offices of its subsidiaries
and private homes of the Wang family and corporate executives.
</P>
<P>
Early investigation results also prompted a decision by the
prosecutors to impose an overseas travel ban on a total of 48
Rebar group executives and Wang family members on charges of
breach of trust, forgery, fraud, insider trading, embezzlement of
corporate funds, and violations of the banking law and accounting
regulations.
