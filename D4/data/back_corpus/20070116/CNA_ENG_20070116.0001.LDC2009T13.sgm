Taipei prosecutors on Monday questioned 25 witnesses in a probe
into the Rebar Group's alleged act of setting up dummy companies
to borrow money from its own Chinese bank.
</P>
<P>
Lin Chin-tsun, Deputy Chief Prosecutor of the Taipei District
Prosecutors' Office, said the 25 were all front persons for
Rebar's subsidiary companies, and that they were all released
afterwards.

<P>
Among the questioned was Eastern Multimedia Group president Gary
Wang's mother, Chen Pei-fang, who was Rebar Asia Pacific Group
founder Wang You-theng's second wife.
</P>
<P>
Some of the questioned said they had cooperated with the Rebar
Group to assist the parent company's redeployment of funds, while
others said that their company had actually made a profit and was
not a front.
</P>
<P>
Two member companies of the Rebar Group -- China Rebar Co. and
Chia Hsin Food &amp; Synthetic Fiber Co. became insolvent and
caused financial  unrest at the turn of the year.  Prosecutors
are investigating related acts of insider trading and breach of
trust. Wang You-theng and his wife Chin Shih-ying have fled to
the United States via China.
