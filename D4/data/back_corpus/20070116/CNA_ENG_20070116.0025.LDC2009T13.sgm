The Kaohsiung city government has recently won financial
supplements from the central government for its projects aimed at
building an "English-friendly" environment in the southern port
city, city officials said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
As the 2009 World Games host and with an ambition to win the
right to organize the 2011 Universiade, Kaohsiung -- Taiwan's
second largest city -- began working in 2005 to improve its road
signs and notices indicating tourist spots by offering English
translations.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the city government has offered English courses to
taxi drivers, while organizing various activities for its
employees and workers to "enjoy" speaking and learning English.
All the efforts were taken with one goal in mind: developing the
city to become an international metropolis that is friendly and
accessible to people from all around the world, said Hsu Li-ming,
the city official in charge of research, development and
evaluation affairs.
</P>
<P>
Hsu also mentioned that an English environment is vital for the
city to play the perfect host during the 2009 World Games, at
which there will be more than 3,000 athletes, coaches and related
personnel from over 100 countries in attendance, in addition to
the thousands of visitors who are expected to crowd the city for
the sporting event.
</P>
<P>
"Any simple English greeting or small talk will help our foreign
friends enjoy Kaohsiung City's friendliness and hospitality, Hsu
said.
