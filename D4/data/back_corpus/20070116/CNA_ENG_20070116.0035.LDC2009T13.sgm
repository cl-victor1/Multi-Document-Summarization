Taipei,  Jan. 16 (CNA) 01/16/07  20:47:33 (By Flor Wang)

Despite the fact that the main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) has
initially set the date of April 15 for its presidential primary,
a key lawmaker of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)
said Tuesday that the DPP has its own mechanism for fielding a
candidate.

<P>
Yeh Yi-jin, a legislative caucus whip of the DPP, made the
remarks at the Legislative Yuan while answering questions from
reporters on the issue after the KMT announced the date for its
presidential primary earlier in the day.

According to Yeh, the DPP would prefer to produce its candidate
for the 2008 presidential election through negotiation "to avoid
friction." No matter who the party opts to support -- either
Premier Su Tseng-chang or his predecessor Frank Hsieh -- the
party has its own mechanisms for selecting a qualified candidate,
she said.

<P>
Vice President Annette Lu and DPP Chairman Yu Shyi-kun are also
likely competitors to vie for the presidential candidacy within
the DPP, in addition to Su and Hsieh.
</P>
<P>
Yeh, however, insisted that unity is the key for the DPP to
wining the 2008 presidential race -- something that is much more
important than the question of when to hold the primary.
</P>
<P>
DPP lawmaker Yu Cheng-tao said that it is better for the party to
first negotiate on which mechanism it should use and that the
question of when the primaries should be held is less important.
