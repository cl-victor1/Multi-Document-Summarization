The Department of Health (DOH) will provide methadone therapy for
drug-addicted prison inmates in northern Taiwan from Feb. 1 as
part of efforts to reduce HIV transmission among drug users, a
DOH official said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Shih Wen-yi, deputy director-general of the DOH's Center for
Disease Control, noted that 40,000 out of the total 60,000
inmates in prisons around Taiwan are serving sentences for drug-
related crime, with as many as 6,000 of them known to be HIV
carriers.

<P>
From the beginning of February, drug-addicted inmates in prisons
north of Hsinchu will be moved to a drug rehabilitation center in
Hsintien, Taipei County, where they will be able to receive daily
methadone therapy, Shih said.

Methadone is a drug used to wean addicts off heroin.

Since  the DOH started  providing  methadone  therapy  for HIV-
infected drug addicts and launched a clean needle program aimed
at reducing needle-sharing among drug users in November 2005, the
number of new HIV/AIDS patients in the country has recorded a
significant drop over the past year.
</P>
<P>
A total of 2,942 new HIV/AIDS cases were reported in 2006,
compared with 3,399 cases in the previous year, marking the first
time in 22 years that the number has fallen, according to DOH
tallies.

<P>
Meanwhile, the ratio of drug-addicted HIV carriers has also
decreased from 73 percent in 2005 to 60 percent in 2006.
