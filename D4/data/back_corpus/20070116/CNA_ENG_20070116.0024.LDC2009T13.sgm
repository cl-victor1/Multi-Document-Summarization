The Agriculture and Food Agency (AFA) under the Council of
Agriculture will soon launch a program to promote rice-growing
among school children, hoping to nurture their love of rice as a
staple food, AFA officials said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Officials said that rice used to be the staple food of local
people, but its status has been consistently undermined by the
onslaught of Western food in recent years.
</P>
<P>
They hope the program, which will have school children take part
in the growing of rice, will teach children about the
relationship between rice and life and eventually induce them to
appreciate rice.
</P>
<P>
The officials said that based on the size of each class, the AFA
will subsidize each class with between NT$180,000 (US$5,490) and
NT$240,000 to carry out the rice-growing program.
</P>
<P>
The AFA under the cabinet-level Council of Agriculture (COA) will
also coordinate with local agricultural associations,
agricultural research stations and agricultural research
institutes to help with the program.
</P>
<P>
The agency said an ideal program should include learning to grow
rice, helping to manage rice fields and observing rice growing
process. Other complementary activities may include draw weaving
and handicraft classes as well as rice cooking and outdoor
activities.
</P>
<P>
Those schools that wish to provide school children with rice
growing experience should apply to the AFA by the end of this
month, the officials said.
