Taipei, Jan.  16 (CNA) 01/16/07  22:40:59 (By Han Nai-kuo)

<P>
Taiwan's human development index (HDI) ranks 24th in the world
and second- highest in Asia, behind only Hong Kong, the
Directorate-General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics (DGBAS)
said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
DGBAS officials pointed out that although Taiwan is not listed in
the 2006 report compiled by the United Nations Development
Program (UNDP) using statistics from in 2004 or earlier, Taiwan
would have a human development index of 0.925 -- obtained by the
same standards in the survey.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan's index of 0.925 comes next to the 0.927 for Hong Kong and
Israel, which are in 22nd and 23rd places, respectively, among
the U.N. member countries.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan's HDI is ahead of Singapore's 0.916 and South Korea's
0.912 that place the two countries in 26th and 27th places.
</P>
<P>
The UNDP has been conducting a survey each year since 1990 to get
the human development index of each U.N. member country according
to three criteria: lifespan, education level and living
standards.
