The Tzu Chi Compassionate Relief Foundation has twice this month
airlifted blankets and other relief goods to the Philippines to
help victims of a disastrous fire that occurred in a slum near
Manila in early April, a Tzu Chi source said Friday.

<P>
Tzu Chi -- Taiwan's largest charity organization -- airlifted
2,000 blankets to the Philippines on April 12. Transportation was
provided free of charge thanks to the chairman of the Philippine
Airlines, Lucio Tan, who is a Tzu Chi volunteer, the Tzu Chi
official said.

Tzu Chi sent another batch of 3,000 blankets and 5,000 packs of
first-aid/relief goods to Manila April 14, again aboard a free PA
liner provided by Tan.

<P>
The slum fire left residents of over 3,000 households homeless,
according to Tzu Chi.
