BITTER RIVALRY DOES NOT HELP DPP'S ELECTION CHANCES: PRESIDENT
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  March 21 (CNA) 04/20/07  15:52:42 (By Deborah Kuo)

President Chen Shui-bian called for unity Friday among the four
contenders vying to become the ruling Democratic Progressive
Party's (DPP's) 2008 presidential candidate, saying that bitter
rivalry will not help the DPP win the election.
</P>
<P>
Chen said unity is the one and only option for the DPP to pursue
ahead of the 2008 presidential race.
</P>
<P>
He described rivals as "mirrors" from which the DPP aspirants can
discover their own shortcomings, adding that competition helps
broaden people's vision and breadth of mind.
</P>
<P>
The president said that bitter campaign moves and rhetoric will
not make the contenders more popular, adding that they are also
unacceptable to DPP members and the contenders' supporters.
</P>
<P>
Chen called for the four contenders -- Vice President Annette Lu,
Premier Su Tseng-chang, DPP Chairman Yu Shyi-kun and former
Premier Frank Hsieh -- not to underestimate the wisdom and
determination of the voters who support the DPP.
</P>
<P>
Saying that internal competition within the DPP should not be
turned into contradiction between the ruling and opposition
parties and that temporary rivals should not become eternal
enemies, Chen pointed out that only when people know how to
"yield" can they manage to "obtain" and only when they are
willing to forgo the interests of "their small selves" can they
make "big achievements" for the country.
</P>
<P>
Chen said that only one of the four aspirants will be selected to
be the DPP's presidential candidate but that this final decision
will not represent victory for only that one person chosen or
defeat for the other three. Rather, he said, producing a
successful DPP candidate who has the best chance of winning the
2008 presidential race will represent a victory for the whole
party as well as for Taiwan's democracy.
</P>
<P>
The period leading up to the DPP primary is a time when the four
aspirants' wisdom and cultivation will be tested, Chen stressed.
</P>
<P>
Chen is scheduled to travel to the southern city of Chiayi
Saturday to listen to the second televised presentation during
which the four DPP aspirants will present their views on how to
govern the country.
