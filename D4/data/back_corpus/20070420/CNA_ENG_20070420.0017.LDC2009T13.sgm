Taipei,  April 20 (CNA) 04/20/07  17:43:23 (By Elizabeth Hsu)

An environmental group called Friday for people in Taipei city
and county to write their administrators asking that a bicycle
lane on urban roads be set aside to allow cyclists to ride safely
to work every day.
</P>
<P>
The group, which is campaigning for a drive to build a 1-thousand
mile trail encircling the island, made the call while announcing
an activity slated for April 22 in downtown Taipei to mark Earth
Day, observed around the world as a day to raise public awareness
of environmental issues.
</P>
<P>
It is hoped that the "422 Bike on Road" activity will inspire
Taipei Mayor Hau Lung-bin and Taipei County Magistrate Chou Hsi-
wei to demonstrate an appreciation of cyclists' need for safe
lanes in which to ride, the group's executives said, noting that
they will propose during the Sunday event that authorities list
bicycles as a class of vehicles permitted to travel on the road.
</P>
<P>
They will also urge authorities to erase the word of "motor" from
the definition of "vehicles" in the existing regulations on road
traffic.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, they will ask city and county governments to
build a bike traffic network in the greater Taipei area to
facilitate commuting,  said  the executives  who also pointed  to
"green transportation" as part of the solution to reducing
environmental pollution and conserving energy.
</P>
<P>
The "Bike on Road" event is scheduled to begin at 2: 30 p.m. at
the National Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hall in Taipei, with
participants from there expected to ride on major roads
throughout the capital city.
