The Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) will hold a series of
social activities for Chinese spouses of Taiwanese citizens to
make counseling on everyday life issues available, beginning with
a garden party to be held at the end of May in Taichung in
central Taiwan, SEF Legal Affairs Director Ho Wu-liang said
Friday.

<P>
The party follows up on a counseling seminar held in March to
help Chinese spouses cope with the challenges they face finding a
job or residence, acquiring an identification card, or accessing
medical services, Ho said, adding that the SEF will hold other
such activities after the garden party.

<P>
Ho said the social gatherings allow local officials to learn what
problems Chinese spouses have adjusting to life in Taiwan, and to
improve services for them. For instance, the Employment Services
Center under the Council of Labor Affairs can provide job
information to those who already have working qualifications, but
needs to overcome any particular barriers that may exist, Ho
added.

<P>
The SEF initiated a special telephone line in October 2006 to
offer counseling and legal services to Chinese spouses, and since
then many spouses have made use of this service to seek help from
the SEF, Ho said.
