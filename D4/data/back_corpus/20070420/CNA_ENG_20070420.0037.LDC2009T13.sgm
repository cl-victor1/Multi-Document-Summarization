Taiwan's semiconductor industry ranks first in the world in terms
of competitiveness, with no other countries expected to rival it
over the next few years, an official from the Industrial
Technology Research Institute (ITRI) said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Tu Tze-chen, director of the ITRI's Industrial Economics and
Knowledge Center (IEK), said that the "blue ocean strategy" for
Taiwan's semiconductor industry is aimed at making other
countries think twice about challenging Taiwan's pre- eminent
position in this field.
</P>
<P>
By 2015, Taiwan will have the greatest number of 12-inch wafer
fabs in the world, Tu predicted, noting that based on current
investment proposals brought up by Taiwan companies, another 27
12-inch wafer fabs are expected to be built in the country in the
coming few years.
</P>
<P>
Chien Chi-sheng,  the IEK's research manager on the local
semiconductor manufacturing industry, said that the 12-inch wafer
has transformed the global wafter manufacturing industry. He
explained that manufacturing  12-inch wafers requires advanced
production capabilities and that Taiwan has a key advantage in
terms of lowering production costs.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan is facing less and less competition abroad in the field,
with major integrated device manufacturers (IDMs) around the
world pulling out of advanced process development and fewer new
competitors entering the market, Chien explained.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, most 8-inch wafer fabs around the world will soon be
closed down, and the world's major memory chipmaker, U.S.-based
Micron Technology Inc., has begun to shift its focus away from
the DRAM market, Chien said, adding that all these factors
represent a promising future for Taiwan manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
According to Chien's estimate, there will be 14 12-inch wafer
fabs in Taiwan by the end of 2008. By 2009, local wafer foundries
and 12-inch wafer manufacturers will be able to increase their
monthly production capacity by 387,000 units, he said, adding
that this will further boost the production value of Taiwan's
wafer manufacturing industry by NT$270 billion (US$8.1 billion).
</P>
<P>
The output of Taiwan's IC manufacturing industry will surpass
NT$1 trillion for the first time in 2009 and exceed NT$2 trillion
in the following year, he predicted.
