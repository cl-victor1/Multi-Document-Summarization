Premier-designate  Chang Chun-hsiung announced a second wave of
personnel reshuffles Thursday for his new Cabinet, which is
scheduled to be sworn in May 21.
</P>
<P>
According to a press release issued by the Government Information
Office, former Changhua County Magistrate Wong Chin-chu has been
named chairwoman of the Council for Cultural Affairs, while
Council of Indigenous Peoples Vice Chairman Yichiang Paluer will
be promoted to the council's top post.
</P>
<P>
Su Hsien-chang, vice chairman of the Atomic Energy Council, will
also get a promotion to the council's chairmanship, the statement
said.

<P>
Meanwhile,  the statement said, ministers of the interior,
education, justice and health will retain their posts.
</P>
<P>
Heads of the Council of Agriculture, the Department of Health,
the Council for Hakka Affairs, the National Science Council, the
National Youth Commission and the National Council on Physical
Fitness and Sports will also remain unchanged, the GIO
statementsaid.
</P>
<P>
In the earlier personnel appointment the day before, Chang
appointed Chiou I-jen, President Chen Shui-bian's chief of staff
or Presidential Office secretary-general, as vice premier, and
Vice Transportation  and Communications Minister Chen Ching-chun
as secretary-general of the Executive Yuan.
</P>
<P>
Chang is being allowed a very short period to shape his new
Cabinet,  political observers  said,  adding  that  the Chang
administration is expected to be on track soon, given that the
former premier and Straits Exchange Foundation chairman has no
faction affiliations and is enjoying a free hand in conducting
the personnel reshuffle.
</P>
<P>
President Chen Shui-bian appointed Chang as the new premier
Monday to succeed Premier Su Tseng-chang after Su submitted his
resignation May 12, one week after he lost the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party presidential primary to his predecessor Frank
Hsieh.
</P>
<P>
Upon appointing Chang as the new premier, Chen put forward five
directives for Chang to oversee day-to-day administration.
</P>
<P>
The five directives are: Insist on Taiwan-centric consciousness
and materialize social  justice;  secure development  with an
environmental protection mindset; promote what is beneficial and
abolish what is harmful; take good care of the central and
southern regions, middle and lower-echelons of society, and
small- and medium-sized  enterprises;  and run the government
humbly and consolidate Taiwan powerfully.
