DESIGNATING CKS HALL AS HERITAGE SITE 'A GREAT IRONY': TSU
COUNCILORS
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  May  18  (CNA) 05/18/07  14:07:55 (By Sofia Wu)

<P>
Two Taipei city councilors from the pro-independence Taiwan
Solidarity Union (TSU) questioned Thursday the city government's
plan to list the Chiang Kai-shek (CKS) Memorial Hall as a
heritage site, describing it as a "great irony in Taiwan's
democratization."
</P>
<P>
The two city councilors -- Chien Yu-yen and Chen Chien-ming --
aired their views in a news conference held after the city
government provisionally designated the hall as a heritage site
pending further study to determine whether to make the
designation permanent.
</P>
<P>
Claiming that the provisional designation  is just a city
government  trick to counter the Democratic Progressive  Party
administration's decision to rename the hall as part of its
efforts to rid the country of the legacy of the late President
Chiang Kai-shek,  the TSU city councilors said the city
government's high-handed defiance is anachronistic and ironic
when considered against the backdrop of Taiwan's democratic
development over the past two decades.
</P>
<P>
The DPP administration decided to rename the CKS hall as the
"Taiwan Democracy Hall" after President Chen Shui-bian described
Chiang earlier this year at a ceremony marking the 60th
anniversary of the 228 Incident as the "dictator and culprit"
behind the tragic incident in which many local elites and
ordinary people as well were killed for rebelling against
Chiang's authoritarian rule.
</P>
<P>
Since learning that the Ministry of Education, which oversees
management of CKS hall, is scheduled to hold a ceremony at the
hall Saturday during which a plaque bearing the hall's new name
will be unveiled, Taipei Mayor Hau Lung-bin, a member of the
opposition Kuomintang (KMT) and son of a retired general who
served under "dictator" Chiang, has said on many occasions that
he would have the police arrest anyone who dared to remove the
hall's name plate or put up a new one at the hall.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on Hau's response, the two TSU city councilors said
Hau's vociferous defiance has hurt the feelings of the families
of many 228 Incident victims.
</P>
<P>
Councilwoman Chien Yu-yen reminded Hau that his city government
team could become a laughing stock if it indeed officially
designates the hall "dedicated to a dictator" as a heritage site.
The hall was opened April 5, 1980, on the fifth anniversary of
Chiang's death when the KMT was in power and the Chiang-
proclaimed martial law was still in force.
</P>
<P>
Representatives of several associations of political refugees and
families of the 228 Incident victims were also present at the
news conference.
</P>
<P>
Tsai  Kuan-yu,  secretary-general  of a political  refugees
association, said the Taipei City government's haughty and
merciless attitude toward the controversy saddens and enrages
him.
</P>
<P>
During the infamous 40-year marital law era, Tsai said, more than
30,000 families were displaced or victimized due to political
persecution.
</P>
<P>
"All those tragedies could be traced to Chiang. How big an irony
it is to continue worshipping a dictator with such a magnificent
hall in this democratic era," Tsai said.
</P>
<P>
To the best of his understanding, Tsai said, it is rare and
unusual in the world to designate a dictator's memorial hall as a
heritage site.
</P>
<P>
For families of victims of the 228 Incident and those who were
persecuted or imprisoned during the ensuing White Terror era,
renaming the hall is "justice that comes far too late."
</P>
<P>
Claiming that the Hau-led city government's threat to arrest
anyone who dares to place a new name plate at the hall is
unacceptable to the majority of the Taiwan people, Tsai said he
looks forward to seeing martial law era political refugees come
to the CKS Memorial Hall this Saturday to fight the city
government's "arrest" threat.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on the same occasion, Chou Chen-tsai, president of
another political refugee association, said the city government
is handling the issue with a "martial law era" mindset while
showing little concern for the feelings of the families of the
228 Incident victims and White Terror political refugees.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, KMT lawmakers threatened Thursday to foil the DPP
administration's plan to rename the CKS Memorial Hall, claiming
that the central government has no legitimate power to do so.
</P>
<P>
KMT Legislator Joanna Lei, a co-convener of the legislature's
Organic Laws and Statutes Committee, said the KMT legislative
caucus will initiate a signature drive among legislators to
demand a review of the Ministry of Education's CKS hall
redesignation proposal.
</P>
<P>
Lei said the ministry should have waited until the legislature
agreed to abolish the original law governing the CKS hall before
issuing an executive order to change its name and structure.
</P>
<P>
However, Vice Education Minister Chou Tsan-der said the ministry
was legally authorized to change the administrative status of the
hall and draw up a new organizational code for the museum at the
hall.
</P>
<P>
"The CKS Memorial Hall ceased to exist the day the Executive Yuan
approved our proposal in mid-April, " Chou said, adding that if
the legislature eventually decides to keep the old museum inside
the hall and its name, we'll respect the legislature's decision,
but until then, we can't sit idly by and do nothing," he added.
</P>
<P>
However, Chou was elusive about the design of the new plaque and
how it would be displayed, only saying that the sign would be
placed somewhere "visible" and would not violate the existing
Cultural Heritage Preservation Law.
