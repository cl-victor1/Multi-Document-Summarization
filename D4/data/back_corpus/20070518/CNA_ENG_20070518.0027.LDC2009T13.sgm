PROSECUTOR REBUTS EXPERT WITNESS ON HSICHIH THREE
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taipei,  May 18 (CNA) 05/18/07  19:08:32 (By Deborah Kuo)
</P>
<P>
A public prosecutor spelled out doubts Friday of opinions given
by U.S.-based forensic scientist Henry Lee earlier this month on
the trial of the "Hsichih Trio" for the double murder and rape of
a couple in Hsichih, Taipei County in 1991.
</P>
<P>
Lee, who traveled to Taiwan from the United States to attend the
trial, appeared as an expert witness May 4 and gave his opinions
on the murder case, backing up his argument with slides showing
the crime scene and related evidence.
</P>
<P>
In a new trial held at the Taiwan High Court Friday, Prosecutor
Huang Tung-shiun rebutted Lee's opinions on the case, claiming
that the world renowned forensic expert has never been an expert
in cut marks or traces and that his speculation that the case
could have involved only one attacker using one kind of weapon
run "counter to the attitude that should be adopted by a
professional forensic scientist."
</P>
<P>
Huang claimed that it was "extremely unprofessional" of Lee to
form his opinions only after viewing pictures and limited
information provided by the trio's lawyers.
</P>
<P>
The case stems from the 1991 murder of Wu Min-han and his wife,
Yeh Ying-lan, who were found dead in pools of blood in their
Hsichih apartment in Taipei County. Their bodies had a total of
79 stab wounds.
</P>
<P>
Five months after the slayings, police arrested Wang Wen-hsiao,
who implicated three others as accomplices. Police also believe
that the four men gang-raped Yeh before killing her with a
kitchen knife taken from her house in a botched burglary.
</P>
<P>
Wang, who was a soldier at the time, was executed in 1992 after
being sentenced to death by a military court. The other three,
tried in civil court, were convicted of robbery, murder and rape
and were also sentenced to death. By 1995 the Hsichih Trio had
exhausted all their legal appeals.
</P>
<P>
However, then-State Public Prosecutor-General Chen Han was unsure
of their guilt. Acting within his power as the state's chief
prosecutor, Chen made three extra appeals to the Supreme Court to
retry the case. The high court rejected all his motions.
</P>
<P>
The Taiwan High Court, however, granted the three defendants'
appeal for a retrial in 2000, and in the ensuing retrial, the
Taiwan High Court overruled the guilty verdicts after 31
hearings, saying that the defendants' confessions gave different
accounts of the time of the crime, the motive for the crime, who
did what at the time, who used what kind of weapon to kill the
victims, how they made their getaway, and how the spoils from the
robbery were to have been split up.
</P>
<P>
After having spent more than 10 years on death row, the Hsichih
Trio were released in January 2003 by the Taiwan High Court due
to lack of evidence.
</P>
<P>
However, in August of the same year, the Supreme Court ordered
another retrial. The Supreme Court threw out the not guilty
verdict handed down by three Taiwan High Court judges, saying
that they had evaluated evidence in the case in defiance of time-
tested rules, had defied logic, had failed to observe legal
guidelines and had not done a thorough investigation into the
case before rendering a verdict.
</P>
<P>
In Friday's retrial, Huang said the three defendants could have
given different accounts on the details in their confessions due
to the prolonged period of trials over the years, but claimed
that truth and facts should not be turned around simply because
of "trivial differences" in defendants' vocal accounts.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the trio's lawyer Su You-chen argued via a written
statement Friday that it is unacceptable and unjustifiable that
the police judged that the three men -- Su Chien-ho, Liu Bing-
lang and Chuang Lin-hsun -- were Wang's accomplices simply
because of their belief that it was "impossible for a sole
predator to stab two persons 79 times."
</P>
<P>
Su said the defendants' lawyers have the same feelings and stance
as those held by the victims' family members -- that the truth
should not be distorted and that justice should not be "sold to
Satan."
</P>
<P>
Su and Hsu Wen-ping, lead defense lawyer for the trio, invited
Lee to appear in the May 4 trial as an expert witness -- which
seldom happens in Taiwan courts -- as Lee had submitted a paper
in September 2001 on his examination of the evidence.
</P>
<P>
In that report, Lee questioned a coroner's report saying that
there were two murderers who used three kinds of weapons.
</P>
<P>
In the May 4 trial, Lee said he did not exclude the possibility
that a single attacker was responsible, based on pictures showing
the crime scene.
</P>
<P>
Backing up his observation with slides showing the crime scene
and related evidence, Lee re-examined the kitchen knife that was
allegedly one of the three weapons used.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that given the different depths and angles of
wounds on the two victims, the single kitchen knife could have
produced all the cuts, stab wounds and hacks.
</P>
<P>
Examining a picture showing the condition of the couple's
bathroom after the murder, Lee also said it did not look as
though several people had cleaned up the blood after the murders
-- another clue prompting him to guess that there might have been
only one perpetrator.
</P>
<P>
Judging from the victims' blood splatter and the fact that the
cuts were so deep that almost all reached bone, Lee inferred that
the murderer could have be psychologically disordered, could have
used drugs shortly before the slaying, or could have received
military training.
