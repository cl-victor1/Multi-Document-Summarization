TAIWAN SHOULD KEEP PUSHING FOR INTERNATIONAL SPACE: EX-U.S.

Taipei, May 18 (CNA) 05/18/07  21:50:36 (By Chris Wang)

The United States understands China wants to squeeze Taiwan out
of the international arena, but Taiwan should keep pushing for
its own international space, an ex-U.S. official visiting Taiwan
said Friday while commenting on Taiwan's failed World Health
Organization (WHO) membership bid.
</P>
<P>
China has been trying to crowd out Taiwan internationally and
"friends of Taiwan should actively make sure that won't happen
again, " said Richard Williamson, who has served as ambassador
and U.S. representative to te United Nations Commission on Human
Rights.
</P>
<P>
Williamson, who was a White House assistant during the Reagan
Administration, also said he does not expect the new U.S.
government in 2008 to change its policy on cross-Taiwan Strait
issues because "Taiwan and the U.S. share the same enduring
values."
</P>
<P>
Two principles that the U.S. will never change are that the U.S.
insists on maintaining the status quo and stability of the Taiwan
Strait and that the people of Taiwan should be able to freely
determine their own future, said Williamson, who is in the middle
of his sixth trip to Taiwan, his first since 1997.
</P>
<P>
Answering a media question on whether the U.S. could show more
support to Taiwan on entering international organizations such as
the WHO, Williamson claimed that the war on terror, the war in
Iraq and Afghanistan have all "sucked the energy out" of the U.S.
and the other superpowers.
</P>
<P>
However, "in the long term, the U.S. can't lose sight of an
important friend, its important commitment and Taiwan Strait
being a potential dangerous spot, " Williamson said.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. will "respect the strategy" of the Taiwan government if
it submits the same proposal of a U.N. bid under the name of
"Taiwan" next September, Williamson said, adding that Taiwan
should keep talking to its friends and allies between now and
September.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan needs to reach a consensus between the various parties
because "any chance of success requires broad domestic support, "
he added.
