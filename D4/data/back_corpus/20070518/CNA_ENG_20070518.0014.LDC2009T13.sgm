Minister  of  Transportation  and Communications Tsai Duei said
Friday that his ministry is studying the feasibility of
implementing measures to promote cycling as a mode of commuting
as part of efforts to deal with traffic problems around the
country.
</P>
<P>
Tsai said the Institute of Transportation, a research agency
under the Ministry of Transportation and Communications (MOTC) ,
has been instructed to study the issue, adding that experts at
the institute are expected to come up with research findings and
suggestions in the near future to help the ministry shape its
policy on promoting cycling.
</P>
<P>
Tsai further said that his ministry will ask city governments to
study whether cycling lanes should be established on new roads
and whether cyclists should be allowed to use sidewalks to
facilitate the promotion of cycling as a transport means. He also
said the Taipei City government has been studying whether to make
helmets mandatory for cyclists.

Tsai made the remarks in Taitung City, eastern Taiwan during an
inspection of construction work on a highway connecting the
inland township of Yuli in Hualien County and the coastal
township of Changping in Taitung County.
</P>
<P>
Construction of the 16.26-km highway,  dubbed the Yu-chang
Highway, is nearing completion, he said, adding that the highway
may be opened to public traffic as early as the end of May if it
passes all relevant engineering and safety inspections.
</P>
<P>
The east coast area and the East Rift Valley -- encompassing the
eastern counties of Hualien and Taitung -- are separated by a
mountain range running from north to south.
</P>
<P>
Currently, it takes about two hours to drive from Yuli, which is
located inland in the north of the East Rift Valley, to Taitung's
Changping, a coastal township facing the Pacific Ocean. The Yu-
chang Highway, which will include a 2.6-km tunnel, will reduce
travel time between the two townships to only about 30 minutes,
according to Tsai.
