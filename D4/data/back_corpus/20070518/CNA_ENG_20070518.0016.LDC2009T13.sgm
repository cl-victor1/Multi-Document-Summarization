The Taiwan Railway Administration (TRA) is inviting 60 married
couples who met on trains to take part in a TRA-sponsored two
day, one night trip to Hualien, as part of celebrations marking
the TRA's 120th founding anniversary, officials said Friday.

The "second honeymoon" journey will cover free rides from Taipei
to Hualien June 26 and back June 27, with each participant only
needing to pay NT$3,500 for a Hualien package tour covering
meals, accommodations, tour bus fares, admission fees to scenic
spots and insurance, the officials said.

Each participating couple will be presented with a commemorative
album and certificate during a candle-lit party set for the night
of June 26, they said.

Eligible couples who are interested in participating should sign
up before May 30 by sending a registration form, including the
story of their railway romance, along with their photo and copies
of their identification cards to the TRA by e-mail, post or fax,
TRA officials said.
