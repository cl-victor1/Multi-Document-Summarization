The first double amputee to scale Mount Everest arrived in Taiwan
for a two-day visit Friday to send out his message to the
handicapped that everyone is able to accomplish beyond one's
limits if he is determined to do so.
</P>
<P>
Mark Inglis, a 47-year-old New Zealander who lost both legs 25
years ago, reached the summit of Mount Everest, the highest
mountain in the world, May 15 last year. His Everest expedition
was filmed for the Discovery series "Everest: Beyond the Limit."
</P>
<P>
"I can't describe how fantastic the experience was. I was very
lucky, " Inglis said in the premiere ceremony of the six-part
series, which documented the 40-day expedition.
</P>
<P>
"I came to realize that the only thing I lost was two legs, but I
had an opportunity to live a different life, " said Inglis, who
is now a motivational speaker.
</P>
<P>
Inglis was stuck in an ice cave in an intense blizzard for 14
days on Mount Cook in New Zealand in 1982 and lost both legs
below the knee to frostbite. He went back to conquer the
mountain, reaching the summit in 2002, and later started planning
the Everest climb by training for the whole of 2005.
</P>
<P>
Inglis also met a group of Taiwanese athletes who will
participate in the 2009 Deaflympics, to be hosted by Taipei City,
and encouraged them to never give up. Inglis was a torch carrier
in the 2000 Sydney Summer Olympics and won a silver medal for
cycling in the Sydney Paralympics.
</P>
<P>
Inglis is scheduled to attend a seminar at the Taipei
International Convention Center Saturday. An interactive
exhibition on his Everest expedition will be displayed in the
plaza of the Eslite Bookstore Xinyi Branch from May 18-June 15.
