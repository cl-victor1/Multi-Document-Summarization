An overwhelming majority of Chinese tourists have been satisfied
with their visits to Taiwan, according to the results of an
opinion poll released Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The survey was conducted by the Tourism Bureau as part of its
efforts to upgrade travel service quality for Chinese tour groups
and ensure their travel safety.
</P>
<P>
Copies of the questionnaire were distributed from last November
to arriving Chinese tourists at Taiwan Taoyuan International
Airport and Kaohsiung International Airport along with a tourism
publicity leaflet. As of May 18, 960 valid samples had been
collected from departing Chinese tourists at the two airports --
Taiwan's two main gateways.
</P>
<P>
According to the poll results, 95.5 percent of the respondents
said they were satisfied with overall services offered by their
travel agencies.
</P>
<P>
Local tour guides' professional attitudes and good customer
service skills received the highest approval rating of 98.1
percent, according to the survey.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the survey found that 98 percent of the respondents
were pleased with tour guides' on-the-spot explanation skills.
</P>
<P>
Up to 95.1 percent gave a thumbs-up to traffic services and
arrangements, while lodging services also received a 91.5 percent
approval rating and 89.8 percent said they were generally
satisfied with the content of local tour packages.
</P>
<P>
In comparison, food and beverage services received the lowest
rating, but the percentage of those who gave a positive
assessment still accounted for 85.6 percent of the total.
</P>
<P>
The survey also found that travel costs for a seven-day, six-
night tour package for Chinese tour groups ranges between
NT$34,482 (US$1,046) and NT$43,096 per head.
</P>
<P>
The number of shopping stops arranged by travel agencies for
Chinese tourists mostly ranged between five and six throughout
their stays, according to the survey results.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 40 percent of the respondents  said they felt the
merchandise prices were generally higher at outlets arranged by
travel agencies, while 35 percent said the prices at those
outlets were fair.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, 72.2 percent said local tour guides usually took them
to stores bearing a "secure shopping guarantee" mark, while less
than 2 percent said their tour guides took them to stores bearing
no such certificate.
</P>
<P>
The Tourism Bureau began to implement a new travel cost, service
quality and shopping guarantee system last November after a tour
bus crash Oct. 2 that year claimed six lives, including five
Chinese tourists from Dalian City. Under the new regulatory
system, the minimum travel cost for Chinese tour groups is set at
US$80 per person per day to ensure good customer service, travel
quality and safety.
</P>
<P>
In a separate survey of 508 randomly chosen Chinese tourists,
conducted by the Tourism Bureau last year to explore their
shopping and travel preferences, most respondents also gave good
reviews of their Taiwan travel experiences. The only unpleasant
thing they cited was what they described as the slowness of
Taiwan's visa processing.
