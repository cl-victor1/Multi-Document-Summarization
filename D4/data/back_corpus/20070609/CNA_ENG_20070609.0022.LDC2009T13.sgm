PINGTUNG UNIVERSITY KEEPING 17 TIGERS
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  June 9 (CNA) 06/09/07  20:29:47 (By Lilian Wu)
</P>
<P>
National Pingtung University of Science and Technology's wildlife
center, described by officials there as "the only place" in
Taiwan equipped to shelter wildlife, currently accommodates 17
tigers.
</P>
<P>
The center, set up 13 years ago, started to accept tigers
abandoned  by private breeders  two or three years after its
inauguration.
</P>
<P>
The officials said that of the 17 tigers, for which the center
has created a wildlife environment, 13 came from Taipei Sea
World.
</P>
<P>
They said the tigers have been at the center for a long time and
are now around 17 or 18 years old, considered old for tigers.
</P>
<P>
They said that because of their age and the fact that they have
become "domesticated" in view of their incarceration in circuses
or parks, the center has no intention of releasing them back to
the wild and that they will die in captivity.
</P>
<P>
Their remarks came amid reports that a "ferocious animal, "
suspected to be a tiger, mauled several goats to death on a farm
in Linkou, Taipei County a day earlier.
