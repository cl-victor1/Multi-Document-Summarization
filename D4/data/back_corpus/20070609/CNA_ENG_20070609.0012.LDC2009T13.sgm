Taipei Magistrate Chou Hsi-wei, heading a 23-member group,
launched a search Saturday in a mountainous area of Linkou rural
township in northern Taiwan for an unidentified animal that has
been killing domestic goats there.
</P>
<P>
County police received a report the previous day from a goat
farmer in Linkou saying that eight of his 100 goats had been
mauled to death by "some kind of large feline" earlier that day,
while two others had neck injuries.
</P>
<P>
A foreign worker who witnessed the incident claimed that she saw
an animal "like a tiger, " but could not be 100 percent sure it
was actually a tiger, police said.
</P>
<P>
The killing raised concerns over public safety, prompting Chou to
mobilize county officials, police and veterinarians to take part
in the search of the area.
</P>
<P>
County officials said they hoped to catch the animal alive and
that they were equipped with a cage, tranquillizer guns,
blowpipes and flashlights.
