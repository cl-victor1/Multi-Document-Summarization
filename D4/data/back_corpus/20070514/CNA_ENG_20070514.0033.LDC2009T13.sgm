BUSINESS LEADERS PIN HOPES ON NEW PREMIER FOR BETTER CHINA TIES
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  May 14 (CNA) 05/14/07  19:58:45 (By Flor Wang)
</P>
<P>
Leaders of the local trade and industry communities voiced hope
Monday for better cross-Taiwan Strait ties after Chang Chun-
hsiung was proclaimed the new premier.
</P>
<P>
President Chen Shui-bian announced Chang's appointment in a news
conference that Vice President Annette Lu and Chang also
attended.
</P>
<P>
Chang, who has served as chairman of the semi-official Straits
Exchange Foundation since 2005, will take over the post May 21
from outgoing Premier Su Tseng-chang, who offered to resign
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Chang already served as premier from October 2000 through Jan.
31, 2002 after the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) came to
power in May 2000, but business leaders said that they believe
Chang can do a better job this time around as the country's
administrative chief.
</P>
<P>
As Chang is quite familiar with cross-strait affairs, he should
seek to implement important policies that should not be further
postponed instead of coming up with new ideas or projects,
according to Republic of China General Chamber of Commerce
Chairman Chang Pen-tsao.
</P>
<P>
For instance, the opening of Taiwan to Chinese tourists and
allowing direct cross-Taiwan  Strait charter flights should be
implemented as soon as possible, as there is only one year left
for the current administration, Chang Pen-tsao said.
</P>
<P>
Chen Wu-hsiung, chairman of the Taipei-based Chinese National
Federation of Industries, also called for broader opening by the
new premier in cross-strait exchanges.
</P>
<P>
Chen Wu-hsiung described Chang as a "sedate" political veteran
and expressed his belief that the new premier does not need time
to "warm up" as this is the second time he has assumed the
premiership -- unprecedented in the country's constitutional
history.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on a planned increase in the minimum wage by the
Council of Labor Affairs, Chen Wu-hsiung said that a 5 percent
increase is the tolerable ceiling of the industry community and
added that he will reiterate this stance to the new premier.
