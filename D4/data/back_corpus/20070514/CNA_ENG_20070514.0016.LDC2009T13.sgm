The first frontal system of the plum rain season is heading
toward Taiwan and is expected to bring showers or thunderstorms
to the northern, central and eastern parts of the island by
Wednesday, the Central Weather Bureau (CWB) reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
Meteorologists forecast that the entire country will be under the
influence of the system until May 21, warning people of possible
flooding due to heavy rainfall during the period.
</P>

Wu Teh-jung, director of the Weather Forecast Center, said Taiwan
is entering the peak of the plum rain season, during which
frontal systems tend to linger around the Taiwan area and the
chance of thunderstorms and torrential rainfall gradually
increases.
</P>
<P>
The approaching frontal system is expected to affect the island
for five or six days, Wu said, adding that temperatures are
expected to drop by 2-3 degrees Celsius after Wednesday.

The cooler weather is also expected to improve the air quality
around the country, officials from the Environmental Protection
Administration (EPA) said, explaining that the wet, cloudy and
cool weather will help lower harmful ozone concentrations.
</P>
<P>
Last week, the EPA issued a warning as ground-level ozone
concentrations in the western part of Taiwan surged to over 120
ppb (parts per billion), a level which threatens human health.
</P>
<P>
Ground-level ozone is an air pollutant with harmful effects on
the respiratory system, while ozone in the upper atmosphere
protects living organisms by preventing damaging ultraviolet
light from reaching the Earth's surface.
