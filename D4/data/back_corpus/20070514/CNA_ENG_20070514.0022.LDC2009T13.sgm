Taipei, May 14 (CNA) 05/14/07  17:17:12 (By Lilian Wu)

Eighty-seven political appointees are likely to resign en masse
Wednesday, Executive Yuan spokeswoman Chen Mei-lin said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Chen made the remarks after President Chen Shui-bian named
Straits Exchange Foundation Chairman Chang Chun-hsiung earlier in
the day as the new premier to replace Su Tseng-chang, who
announced his resignation Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The spokeswoman said Cabinet aides suggested that all political
appointees resign en masse during a Cabinet meeting Wednesday and
that the changeover ceremony between Su and Chang be held May 21.
</P>
<P>
Asked whether  the new Cabinet will resubmit  the central
government's  budget bill for 2007 budget for review by the
Legislative Yuan, Chen said that the bill will definitely not be
submitted again.
</P>
<P>
Chen noted that the original budget, which should have been
passed in late 2006 but which has been stalled in the Legislative
Yuan because the major parties have been at loggerheads over the
Organic Law of the Central Election Commission, has passed the
initial reading in the legislature.
</P>
<P>
She also said that the matter of the level of the minimum wage
hike, which the Council of Labor of Affairs suggested to Su's
Cabinet should be between 7.5 percent and 9.5 percent, will be
left for the new Cabinet to decide.
