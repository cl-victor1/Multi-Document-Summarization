Exports of Taiwan's manufacturing industry totaled US$54.45
billion in the first quarter, up 8.5 precent year-on-year, thanks
to robust growth in exports to Asia and Europe, the Ministry of
Economic Affairs (MOEA) said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Officials of the Industrial Development Bureau under the MOEA
predicted that as the exports of such mainstay sectors as flat
panels, computers and machine tools continue to build momentum,
the domestic economy will continue to be brisk.

<P>
Analyzing the exports of the manufacturing industry in the first
quarter, the officials said that although exports and imports in
February decreased due to the long Chinese New Year holiday, both
exports and imports in January and March showed dramatic growth
over the same months of last year, with exports to Asia and
Europe especially good.

<P>
They said exports of the manufacturing industry in the first
quarter totaled US$54.45 billion, up 8.5 percent year-on-year,
while imports totaled US$48.18 billion, up 3.1 percent, with
Taiwan enjoying a trade surplus of US$6.3 billion, or a whopping
81.9 percent from the same period of last year.
</P>
<P>
Export orders totaled US$75.88 billion in the first quarter, up
12.73 percent year-on-year. Information,  telecommunications and
electronic products were still the mainstays of the foreign
orders.
</P>
<P>
The officials noted that the ratio of "accepting orders in Taiwan
and producing overseas" has continued to climb. The ratio of
overseas production hit 42.3 percent last year, resulting in a
widening gap between Taiwan's export order value and the real
export value.
