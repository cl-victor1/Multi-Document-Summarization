NEIHU MRT LINE TO START RUNNING IN MARCH 2009: MAYOR
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taipei,  May 14 (CNA) 05/14/07  21:46:32 (By Ruth Wang)

<P>
Taipei Mayor Hau Lung-bin promised Monday that the Neihu Mass
Rapid Transit (MRT) line will start running in March 2009 and
will begin commercial operation the following June, with no more
changes made to this schedule.
</P>
<P>
Hau made the promise in response to complaints by Taipei City
Councilor Lee Ching-yuan about construction delays on the Neihu
MRT line.
</P>
<P>
Lee said the Taipei City Department of Rapid Transit Systems
(DORTS) has allowed repeated postponements of construction by its
contractor Kung Sing Engineering Corporation without imposing any
penalties. The first delay of 278 days in 2006 and a further 122
days allowed this year has made a total of 400 days of delay, Lee
pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Lee said that although DORTS had excuses for the construction
delays, DORTS Director Tom Chang should resign to take
responsibility for causing trouble and difficulty for citizens.
</P>
<P>
Hau replied that he has asked the deputy mayor to supervise the
construction progress and that he will instruct those in charge
to step down if there is any further procrastination.
