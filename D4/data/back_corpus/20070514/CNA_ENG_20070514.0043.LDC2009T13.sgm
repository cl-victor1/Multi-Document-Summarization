All regions of Taiwan are expected to have cool weather with
occasional showers or thundershowers for the next seven days
until May 20, the Central Weather Bureau (CWB) forecast Monday.
</P>
<P>
CWB meteorologists said an approaching cold front had caused
temperatures throughout Taiwan to drop from early Monday and that
another cold front is expected to reach Taiwan May 16, bringing
more cool weather, as well as showers and thundershowers, to all
parts of Taiwan through May 20.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Environmental Protection Administration officials said
Taiwan will see improved air quality over the next week because
the cool temperatures are not conducive to ozone formation.
</P>
<P>
They said locally generated floating particles will be the only
factor affecting Taiwan's air quality in the next week.
