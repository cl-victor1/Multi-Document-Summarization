KMT WELCOMES PRESIDENT'S INITIATIVES IF THEY MATERIALIZE
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  May 14 (CNA) 05/14/07  18:08:22 (By Deborah Kuo)

An opposition Kuomintang (KMT) heavyweight said Monday that the
KMT would welcome President Chen Shui-bian's latest overtures
calling for closer cross- Taiwan Strait exchanges if they
actually materialize.
</P>
<P>
KMT Policy Coordinating Committee Deputy Director Chang Jung-kung
described most of Chen's remarks as "empty electoral rhetoric" in
which only fools would believe, but added that the KMT would
welcome them should Chen's initiatives -- spelled out earlier
that day and calling for an early completion of cross-strait
talks on the opening of Taiwan to Chinese tourists and for direct
cross-strait cargo charter flights at an early date -- be
realized.
</P>
<P>
Upon appointing  Straits Exchange Foundation  Chairman Chang
Chun-hsiung as the new premier Monday, Chen said he hopes that
Chang, with his knowledge of cross- strait affairs, will be
instrumental in pushing for the completion of cross- strait talks
on the two issues.
</P>
<P>
Responding to Chen's overtures, Chang Jung-kung recalled that the
president said last week that direct cross-strait air links will
not be opened before his tenure ends in May 2008, and in October
2003, Chang said, the president declared that if he was re-
elected, direct cross-strait air links would be opened by the end
of 2004.
</P>
<P>
All Chen's overtures have been aimed at cheating the people for
votes, Chang claimed, adding that once the elections were over
and won, Chen failed to deliver on his promises.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out, however, that Chen will sustain certain pressure
from former Premier Frank Hsieh, who is set to be nominated by
the Democratic Progressive Party as the ruling party's candidate
for the 2008 presidential race and who is known to be supportive
of closer private sector ties with China.
</P>
<P>
He lamented that while the KMT has strived to push for Taiwan's
opening to Chinese tourists and of direct cross-strait airlinks
for cargo and passengers, the DPP administration has wavered
between "open" and "not open" or has tried its best to stall.
</P>
<P>
Chang expressed hope that the new premier will help bring to
fruition the DPP promises on easier and closer cross-strait ties.
