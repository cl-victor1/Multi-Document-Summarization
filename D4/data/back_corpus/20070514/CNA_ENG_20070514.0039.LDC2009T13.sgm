PRESIDENT TO SERVE AS `SUPER CAMPAIGNER' IN ELECTION: AIDE
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

Taipei,  May 14 (CNA) 05/14/07  21:10:52 (By Lilian Wu)

<P>
The ruling Democratic Progressive Party's (DPP's) expected
presidential nominee Frank Hsieh will have President Chen Shui-
bian as his "super campaigner, " an official at the Presidential
Office said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Presidential Deputy Secretary-General Cho Jung-tai said Chen and
Hsieh will form the dual-nucleus of Hsieh's campaign
headquarters.
</P>
<P>
He said Hsieh, who beat three other contenders -- outgoing
Premier Su Tseng- chang, Vice President Annette Lu and DPP
Chairman Yu Shyi-kun -- in the May 6 member vote of the primary,
has pushed for party solidarity over the past week in view of a
possible rift within the party because of the bitterly fought
primary.
</P>
<P>
Cho, a protege of Hsieh, said Hsieh did not exchange views with
Chen during a Monday meeting on the lineup of a new Cabinet to be
headed by Chang Chun-hsiung, who the president earlier named as
premier after the resignation of Su Tseng- chang.
</P>
<P>
Hsieh visited Lu and Yu, as well as Chang Monday, hoping to forge
a"new concept" for his election in March 2008, Cho said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the DPP's campaign strategy in the 2004 election
was successful, adding that Chen served concurrently as party
chairman at that time and the party's and Chen's campaign offices
merged.
</P>
<P>
He said Hsieh's campaign headquarters will also be merged with
the party's.
</P>
<P>
Hsieh, who has been traveling around Taiwan to listen to the
grassroots since the primary, might also travel overseas, Cho
said.
</P>
<P>
"Many countries want to learn more about Hsieh's political ideals
as well as his blueprint for running the country after his
victory in the primary," he said.
</P>
<P>
Hsieh hopes to let the international community gain a better
understanding of Taiwan as well as broaden his horizons, Cho
added.
</P>
<P>
He did not directly answer reports that Hsieh has asked former
Premier Yeh Chu- lan to form a ticket with him, saying only that
there is "no hurry" to announce a running mate.
