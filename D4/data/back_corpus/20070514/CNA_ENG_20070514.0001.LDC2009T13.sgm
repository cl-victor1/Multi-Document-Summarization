</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  May 14 (CNA) 05/14/07  08:53:05 (By Sofia Wu)
</P>
<P>
President Chen Shui-bian will hold a news conference at 11 a.m.
Monday to announce his decision to appoint Chang Chun-hsiung,
chairman of the quasi- official Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF)
, as new premier of his administration, reliable sources said
over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
According to the sources, Chen will also name his resourceful
chief of staff -- Presidential Office Secretary-General Chiou
I-jen -- to serve as Chang's deputy at the Executive Yuan.
</P>
<P>
The sources further said Chang will organize a "combative action
Cabinet" that will feature determined and energetic pursuit of
the ruling Democratic Progressive Party's (DPP's) major policy
goals.
</P>
<P>
Following the change of command at the helm of the Executive
Yuan, the sources said, the Cabinet will undergo a major
reshuffle. The new lineup will include many new faces to inject
new vitality into the administration, the sources said, adding
that ministers of finance  and minister  of the  interior  as
well  as several ministers-without-portfolio are most likely to
be replaced.
</P>
<P>
In any case, the sources said, the new Cabinet will give the top
priority to maintaining political stability, boosting internal
unity, revving up the economy, pursuing social justice and
consolidating the DPP's grip on power.
</P>
<P>
Chang will succeed Su Tseng-chang, who stunned the nation with
his resignation Saturday, less than a week after he lost the DPP
primary for the 2008 presidential election to his predecessor,
Frank Hsieh.
</P>
<P>
President Chen agreed to Su's verbal resignation Saturday, but
out of his respect for Su, he withholds announcement of a
replacement until after receiving Su's written resignation early
Monday, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
Chang, 69, was no stranger to the job he will take over. He was
the first DPP premier, serving from October 2000 through Jan. 31,
2002.
</P>
<P>
Given the current circumstances, Chang could be a suitable
choice, analysts said. While Chen needs someone who has
experience, he also needs someone who has no political ambition
in order not to invite opposition from within the ruling party,
the analysts added.
</P>
<P>
Chang is known to be friendly to both Chen and Hsieh, who is set
to win the DPP's nomination for the coming presidential election
after beating Su in the May 6 primary vote.
</P>
<P>
Chang, Chen, Hsieh and Su were all dissident lawyers during
Taiwan's infamous martial law era.
</P>
<P>
Following Su's resignation, all Cabinet members will have to
resign en masse under the current government regulations.
</P>
<P>
There have been reports that incumbent Vice Premier Tsai Ing-wen
may be transferred to serve as President Chen's chief of staff,
or Presidential Office secretary-general. But DPP sources said
they see little possibility for such an arrangement.
</P>
<P>
As to who will be the new premier's chief of staff or Executive
Yuan secretary- general, media reports said the two Presidential
Office deputy secretaries- general Cho Jung-tai and Chen Chi-mai
are likely candidates. But both of them have denied the reports.
