Taipei,  May 14 (CNA) 05/14/07  20:31:44 (By Chris Wang)

<P>
The Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) signed memorandums of
understanding (MOUs) with three foreign major enterprises on the
sidelines of an annual WiMAX technology conference Monday,  with
the goal of solidifying Taiwan's position as a technology leader.
</P>
<P>
"Taiwan has been delving into the infrastructure of WiMAX
applications for years, " said Economics Minister Chen Rey-long,
who added that by signing MOUs with three key players -- NEC,
Nortel and Rohde and Schwarz -- from three different continents,
Taiwan hopes to raise its global competitiveness in the WiMAX
industry.
</P>
<P>
WiMAX technology is described as "a standards-based technology
enabling the delivery of last-mile wireless broadband access as
an alternative to cable and DSL."
</P>
<P>
Signing the memorandum were Chen, Nortel President of WiMAX and
Wireless Mesh Peter McKinnon, NEC President Kaoru Yano and Rhode
and Schwarz President and Chief Operating Officer Christian
Leicher. The three enterprises will open up their core network
system interfaces and cooperate with at least two Taiwan
manufacturers in developing the latest MIMO and other Smart
Antenna technology.
</P>
<P>
Chen said WiMAX is a key technology being promoted by the
government and that the participation of the three companies will
help create a high quality state- of-the-art wireless broadband
network, enabling Taiwan to become the world's first Wi-Fi/WiMAX
dual network services environment.
</P>
<P>
The cooperation is expected to be the catalyst for Taiwan's
expansion in the highly competitive technology, McKinnon said,
adding that Nortel established a WiMAX partnership with Chunghwa
Telecom since last December.
</P>
<P>
It is only natural for NEC to work with Taiwan, given the
company's long history of operations in Taiwan since 1940, and
its understanding of the island, said Yano, who also announced
that NEC is setting up a research and development center in
Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Asia-Pacific WiMAX Conference and Exhibition 2007 Taipei Summit,
organized by the MOEA, is taking place in Taipei May 14 - 15.
Over 400 experts are participating in the summit to share their
experience in promoting WiMAX and related technology.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the world's first mobile WiMAX exhibition is being
held, enabling visitors to get a feel for super high speed mobile
broadband and other practical applications.
