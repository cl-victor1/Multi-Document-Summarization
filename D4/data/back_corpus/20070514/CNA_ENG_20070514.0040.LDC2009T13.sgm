PILOT ERROR, WEATHER LIKELY REASONS FOR F-5F CRASH: INVESTIGATORS

Taipei,  May 14 (CNA) 05/14/07  21:21:18 (By Elizabeth Hsu)

Weather and pilot error are probably the reasons for the crash of
an F-5F jet fighter Friday that killed four people and injured
nine, according to the preliminary results of an inquiry by the
air force into the accident.
</P>
<P>
The air force investigation team in charge of the inquiry visited
the Chih Hang air base in Taitung County, southeastern Taiwan,
where investigators speculated that low visibility misled the
pilots -- instructor Maj. Wei Tzu-yuan and intelligence officer
Capt. Chang Chia-chun -- when they calculated their altitude.
</P>
<P>
Such misjudgment could make the aircraft fail to climb because of
low speed, they said, explaining that unlike other fighters, the
F-5F is not equipped with a computer-operated navigation system.
As a result, the pilot has to be experienced in calculating the
best time for the aircraft to pull up, they noted.
</P>
<P>
Asked about recent reports claiming that the crash was caused by
the air combat maneuvering instrumentation (ACMI) system used for
air combat training falling off the plane, the investigators, who
are all senior pilots, said this would be impossible.
</P>
<P>
The system is nothing but an aviation recording device, they
pointed out.
</P>
<P>
To a jet fighter, bad weather only means there is low visibility
whether or not there is rainfalls or a storm, said one of the
pilots.
</P>
<P>
According to the preliminary investigation report released by Air
Force Chief of Staff Major Gen. Liu Chen-wu earlier in the day at
the Legislative Yuan, the pilots of the F-5F are believed to have
failed to pull up safely immediately after firing their guns and
releasing bombs during a rehearsal for the Han Kuang 23 military
exercises. The result was that the fighter stalled and crashed.
</P>
<P>
During the several crucial seconds after the stall, he said, the
pilots chose not to eject in order to steer the fighter away from
an industrial zone in Hsinchu County, sacrificing themselves in
an attempt to save lives. The fighter ended up crashing into a
nearby military base in Hukou.
</P>
<P>
Along with the two co-pilots, two Singaporean troops on the
ground were also killed in the crash, which caused a fire at the
barracks housing Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) soldiers
participating in a training program. Nine other SAF personnel
were injured, sustaining varying degrees of burns.
</P>
<P>
The air force grounded all its F-5Fs and F-5Es for safety
inspections after the accident.
