Taipei,  June  1 (CNA) 06/01/07  23:24:59 (By Flor Wang)

Apart from the two major international airports in northern and
southern Taiwan, airports in other parts of the country will also
be assessed for future direct cross-Taiwan Strait charter flight
services, a Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) official said Friday.
</P>
<P>
MAC Vice Chairman Liu Te-hsun made the comment during a routine
news conference.
</P>
<P>
Liu's remarks came after President Chen Shui-bian told Taichung
City Mayor Jason Hu earlier in the day during a meeting at the
Presidential Office that the central government will definitely
include Chingchuankang Airport in Taichung County for evaluation
for its cross-strait charter service plan.
</P>
<P>
"The greater Taichung area in central Taiwan must not be excluded
from the central government's cross-strait cargo and passenger
charter service program," Chen pledged.
</P>
<P>
In response to the president's comments, Liu said that airports
in the rest of Taiwan, such as Chingchuankang Airport and Makung
Airport on the outlying island of Penghu, will also be included
in the program if their facilities can be improved to
international standards.
</P>
<P>
However, he went on, Taoyuan Taiwan International Airport and
Kaohsiung International Airport have to date been the two major
airports considered for opening direct cross-strait charter
services. Taiwan and China have held seven rounds of negotiations
concerning the issue.
</P>
<P>
"More airports in Taiwan could be included in the cargo and
passenger charter service program in the future after the ongoing
bilateral negotiations surrounding the two main airports in
Taiwan and their counterparts in China have wrapped up, " Liu
said, adding that "it will be more pragmatic to touch on other
airports only after the talks centered on the Taoyuan and
Kaohsiung airports are complete."
