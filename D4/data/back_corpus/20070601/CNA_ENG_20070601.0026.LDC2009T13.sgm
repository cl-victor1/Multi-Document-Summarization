Asian horseshoe crabs, known as one of the few "living fossil"
species in the Taiwan area, have been sighted on the coast of the
southern county of Chiayi recently, opening another wildlife
conservation door, Chiayi County officials said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Five adult and 32 young  Asian horseshoe  crab tachypleus
tridentatus, whose appearance on Earth can be dated back to 200
million years ago, have been sighted on the coast of Putai,
Chiayi, making Chiayi County the third place in Taiwan to witness
the appearance of the crabs after sightings were reported on the
outlying island of Kinmen and in the Penghu archipelago, the
officials said.
</P>
<P>
The Chiayi county authorities are collaborating with researchers
from the Research Center for Biodiversity, Academia Sinica
(RCBAS) to protect the rare species and its habitat near the
Putai coast, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
Other members of several wildlife conservationist groups will
also join the RCBAS researchers and Chiayi officials on a field
trip to a saltmarsh in Putai Saturday to witness the erection of
a netted area to allow the adult crabs to spawn and the babies to
be nurtured, making the area an exclusive breeding zone for the
crabs.

<P>
Meanwhile, the officials went on, the protection of Asian
horseshoe crabs will also be arranged as one of the activities to
attract tourists to Chiayi County.
</P>
<P>
In 2006, some 70,000 baby Asian horseshoe crabs bred in captivity
were released into the wild off the coast of Kinmen as part of
efforts to conserve the "living fossil" species.
</P>
<P>
With its distinctive domed carapace shaped like a horseshoe and a
stiff pointed tail, the Asian horseshoe crab was nearly extinct
in waters surrounding Taiwan proper as a result of development
and environmental change until it occasionally began to be seen
near Penghu a couple of years ago.
