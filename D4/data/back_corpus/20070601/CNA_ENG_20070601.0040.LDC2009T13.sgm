VECO HAILS INTERRACIAL MARRIAGE BROKERAGE BAN
</HEADLINE>

Taipei, June 1 (CNA) 06/01/07  21:38:17 (By Chris Wang)

The ban on interracial marriage brokerage to be implemented by
the government is "the right thing to do, " but accompanying
measures and enforcement of the law are even more important, a
Vietnamese representative in Taiwan said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Vietnamese government has always opposed interracial marriage
brokerage, said Nguyen Cong Manh, deputy head of the Vietnam
Economic and Cultural Office in Taipei (VECO) -- the Vietnamese
representative office in Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Nguyen was responding to an amendment to the Immigration Law in
which legislators agreed Thursday to put an end to the
controversial interracial marriage brokerage industry.  Effective
immediately, cross-border marriage brokers will be banned from
doing business and offenders will be subject to punishment.
</P>
<P>
There are approximately 100,000 Vietnamese women married to
Taiwanese men living in Taiwan at present, and one in three
foreign spouses in Taiwan comes from Vietnam, Nguyen said.
</P>
<P>
"While most of them have happy marriages, there's no denying that
problems such as abuse, fraudulent marriages and human smuggling
are happening, which is why we, as a government, agree with the
amendment, " he said.
</P>
<P>
The number of cross-border marriages between Taiwan and Vietnam
reached a very high level from 1993-2003 before the Taiwan and
Vietnam governments started implementing stricter regulations on
marriage applications, Nguyen said, adding that the number has
been stable ever since.
</P>
<P>
However, the demand was always there and Nguyen stressed that the
governments of both sides will have to cooperate and work out a
solution for those Taiwanese men who want to legally marry
Vietnamese women.
</P>
<P>
"Otherwise, most of the brokerage companies will go `underground'
and still do the same things under the guise of travel agencies
or friendship societies," he said.
