Taipei,  June 1 (CNA) 06/01/07  18:45:24 (By  Flor Wang)

<P>
President Chen Shui-bian called Friday for the quick passage of
two key bills out of grave concern over national development and
the people's livelihoods.
</P>
<P>
Chen made the remarks  during  an award ceremony  at the
Presidential Office for outstanding engineers.
</P>
<P>
Saying that economic issues must be free from political meddling,
Chen said that the 2007 central government budget bill must clear
the Legislative Yuan as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
The annual budget bill has been stonewalled for more than six
months in the Legislative Yuan due to an "irrational" boycott of
the opposition "pan-blue alliance" lawmakers of the Kuomintang
(KMT) and the People First Party (DPP), Chen said, blaming them
for tying its passage to that of the draft Central Election
Commission (CEC) Organic Law.
</P>
<P>
Now that the ruling and opposition camps have reached initial
agreement over the draft CEC Organic Law, Chen said, the budget
bill should be approved as soon as possible and he expressed his
hope that no more disputes will arise to further complicate the
situation.
</P>
<P>
The Legislative Yuan has been in a gridlock over the two bills,
which are of respective significance to the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) and the opposition "pan-blue alliance."
</P>
<P>
The KMT and the PFP made it clear that they will never agree to
the annual budget bill's passage unless the DPP is willing to
accept a proportional representation system proposed by the "pan-
blue alliance" concerning the lineup of the 17-member CEC.
