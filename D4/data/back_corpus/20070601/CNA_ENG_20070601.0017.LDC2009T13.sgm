Tokyo,  June  1 (CNA) 06/01/07  16:31:08 (By Mike Chang and Y.F.
Low)
</P>
<P>
Former Republic of China President Lee Teng-hui was awarded
Friday the first Shimpei Goto Prize by a Japanese publisher for
his contribution to Taiwan's urbanization and democratization.
</P>
<P>
The event was organized by Fijiwara Shoten's Goto Shimpei
Organization to mark the 150th anniversary of the birth of the
late Japanese colonial administrator Shimpei Goto. The prize is
awarded to people who have contributed to national or regional
development.
</P>
<P>
Delivering a speech titled "Shimpei Goto and Me" during the
ceremony, Lee noted that Goto made a great contribution to
Taiwan's modernization during his service as the chief of civil
administration under the Japanese colonial government in Taiwan
between 1898 and 1906.
</P>
<P>
Lee said that although his life hardly overlapped with that of
Goto,  he personally has been profoundly influenced by Goto's
achievements in Taiwan and his extraordinary philosophy of life.
</P>
<P>
"It is not an exaggeration to say that Taiwan's development has
moved forward along the track paved by Goto, " Lee said, adding
that the Japanese education that he received allowed him to
become mayor of Taipei City, governor of Taiwan Province, vice
president and even president.
</P>
<P>
On what he takes pride in the most, Lee pointed to his success in
transforming Taiwan's political system from a military
dictatorship into a democracy without a single drop of blood
being shed in his 12 years as president.
</P>
<P>
According to Lee, there are two kinds of politicians: those who
engage in the pursuit of power and those who aim to serve the
people. He added that politicians who are not subject to the
temptation of power do not become corrupt.
</P>
<P>
Just like Goto, Lee said, he exercised self-restraint and was
always ready to relinquish power during his presidency.
</P>
<P>
Claiming that faith is one of the most important qualities of a
leader, Lee said love and justice are what he believes in as a
Christian.
</P>
<P>
Lee further said that although he and Goto may be different in
terms of their religious beliefs, having strong faith is what
they have in common and what connects them spiritually.
</P>
<P>
This is Lee's third trip to Japan since his presidency ended in
May 2000. However, this is his first visit to Tokyo and the first
time that he has made a public speech in Japan.
</P>
<P>
In addition to receiving the prize, another highlight of Lee's
current trip is a planned "oku no hosomichi" tour covering the
prefectures of Miyagi, Yamagata, Iwate, Akita and Gunma,
retracing a similar journey made by haiku poet Matsuo Basho in
1689 based on which his famous work "Oku no Hosomichi, " or
"Narrow Road to the Interior," was written.
</P>
<P>
Lee will also visit Akita International University and Takushoku
University and has indicated his desire to visit the Yasukuni
Shrine in Tokyo to pay respects to his older brother who died
fighting for the Japanese colonial government during World War
II.
</P>
<P>
The former president is scheduled to hold a news conference in
Tokyo before his departure June 9.
