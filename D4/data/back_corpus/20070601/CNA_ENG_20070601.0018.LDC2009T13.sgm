President Chen Shui-bian met with Jason Hu, mayor of the central
city of Taichung, at the Presidential Office Friday for a hour-
long talk, during which a long-stalled plan to develop a massive
plot of land in the greater Taichung area was put on the fast
track.
</P>
<P>
Chen instructed that NT$7 billion (US$212 million) be allocated
out of a military barracks reconstruction fund to facilitate the
relocation of the Air Force Second Logistic Command Center away
from the site of the former Shuinan Airport so that development
projects on the vast plot of land covering approximately 250
hectares can kick off.
</P>
<P>
Chen instructed the Council for Economic Planning and Development
(CEPD), the Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and
Statistics, the Ministry of National Defense and the Taichung
City Government to collaborate and jointly form a task force on
the development plan so as to enable the Air Force Second
Logistic Command Center to be fully relocated by the end of this
year, paving the way for the launch of the mammoth land
development plan at the beginning of 2008 at the earliest.
</P>
<P>
The Shuinan development plan --  potentially involving the
development of a modern urban hub that will house a university
city, a trade exhibition center, an up-scale residential district
and a forest park -- put Taichung on the map in March this year
after Richard Li, a Hong Kong business tycoon whose father, Li
Ka-shing, is Asia's richest man, paid a visit to the site for a
fact-finding tour.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile,  according  to Taichung City Deputy Mayor Hsiao Chia-
chi, who was also present at the Chen-Hu meeting, the president
also instructed the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)
administration to talk with the DPP legislative caucus to reach a
consensus on the issue of whether the Act on Local Government
Systems should be further amended to enable Taichung City to be
upgraded to a special municipality.
</P>
<P>
During the Chen-Hu meeting, according to Hsiao, Mayor Hu also
suggested that the Chingchuankang Airport, now known as the
Taichung Airport, be allowed to operate cross-strait charter
flight services during the Chinese New Year and other major
holidays.
</P>
<P>
Chen instructed the Ministry of Transportation and Communications
to study the feasibility of Hu's suggestion, according to Hsiao.
