Taipei,  June 1 (CNA) 06/01/07  21:22:29 (By Flor Wang)

<P>
President Chen Shui-bian said Friday that the central government
will definitely include Taichung in its direct cross-Taiwan
Strait charter services.
</P>
<P>
Chen made the remarks while talking to Taichung Mayor Jason Hu,
whom he had invited to a meeting at the Presidential Office to
discuss the central city's long-term development.
</P>
<P>
Stressing that he will never forget promises he made to Taichung
citizens -- building an international airport, constructing a
science park and upgrading the city's administrative status --
Chen pledged that he will do his utmost to help the municipal
authorities achieve the three goals during his last year in
office.
</P>
<P>
"The greater Taichung area will never be absent from the central
government's cross-strait charter flight service program along
with Taipei and Kaohsiung, " Chen vowed.
</P>
<P>
For his part, Hu voiced his hope that Chingchuankang Airport in
neighboring Taichung County could be converted to an
international airport as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
Describing it as very important that an international airport be
built in central Taiwan for the some 6 million people living
there, Hu, however, pointed out that the Ministry of
Transportation and Communications has yet to include Taichung in
its program for opening direct cross-strait charter flights.
</P>
<P>
Hu told the president that the central government should help
upgrade Chingchuankang Airport to international standards so as
to offer both cargo and passenger charter flights between Taiwan
and China as soon as possible.
