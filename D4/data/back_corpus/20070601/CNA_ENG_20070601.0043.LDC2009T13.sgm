</HEADLINE>

Taipei, June 1 (CNA) 06/01/07  23:12:34 (By Sofia Wu)

<P>
The next legislative elections are set to take place next Jan.
12, a spokesman for the Central Election Commission (CEC) said
Friday.
</P>
<P>
CEC Deputy Secretary-General Teng Tien-you made the announcement
after a CEC commissioners meeting.
</P>
<P>
As the tenure of the current legislators will expire Jan. 31,
2008, Teng said, the next Legislative Yuan must be elected before
Jan. 21 to meet the provision of the current Public Officials
Election and Recall Act that succeeding public functionaries must
be elected 10 days before the expiration of incumbents' tenure.
</P>
<P>
According to a proposed amendment to the Public Officials
Election and Recall Act being mulled by the legislature, only
those who have resided in a specific constituency for six months
are eligible to vote.
</P>
<P>
Against this backdrop, Teng said, the voting date for the next
legislative election must be decided six months in advance. As a
result, Dec. 1 this year will have to be excluded.
</P>
<P>
A consensus reached at a special meeting held by the Executive
Yuan last October to review electoral affairs concluded that the
voting date for central and local elections should be set either
for the second or fourth Saturday of the selected month.
</P>
<P>
"Taking all these factors into account, Jan. 12 is the most
suitable day for the next legislative election," Teng explained.
</P>
<P>
As to whether the next legislative and presidential elections
should be held simultaneously, Teng said it will be put forward
for the next CEC commissioners to decide. The term of the present
CEC commissioners will expire June 16.
</P>
<P>
Lawmakers from both the ruling and opposition camps generally
approved of the CEC's choice of Jan. 12 for the next legislative
elections.
</P>
<P>
As to whether the legislative and presidential elections should
be held on the same day, Hsu Shao-ping, a main opposition
Kuomintang legislative caucus whip, said the KMT would support
either option so long as consensus is reached among lawmakers of
all political stripes.
</P>
<P>
Ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) lawmakers had yet to
reach consensus on the issue. According to DPP Legislator Wang
Shu-hui, her colleagues from southern Taiwan constituencies tend
to support the combination of the two critical elections to save
social costs, while DPP lawmakers from northern districts
generally oppose the proposal.
