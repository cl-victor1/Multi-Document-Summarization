Taipei,  June 1 (CNA) 06/01/07  18:12:28 (By Lilian Wu)

<P>
Minister of Justice Shih Mao-lin expressed hope Friday that
Taiwan can learn from the drug-control experience of other
countries and step up international cooperation to deal with its
drug problem.
</P>
<P>
Shih made the remarks when he presided over the opening of an
international drug control symposium sponsored by the ministry.
More than 30 anti-drug officials and experts from 10 countries,
including the United States, Canada, France and Australia, took
part in the symposium.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the government formulated a new policy on drug
control last year and that a major concept under the new policy
is to treat drug addicts as patients rather than criminals.
</P>
<P>
The government is also providing the drug addicts with clean
needles and taking cues from the United States, Australia and
Hong Kong to use methadone to treat heroin addicts.
</P>
<P>
Methadone is a rigorously tested medication that is safe and
efficacious for the treatment of narcotic withdrawal and
dependence, Shih claimed.
</P>
<P>
The government also divides drug control work into four major
areas: drug- prevention, drug-rejection, drug rehabilitation and
drug crackdowns.
</P>
<P>
The central government is also working with local governments,
with drug- prevention centers established in every city and
county, he went on.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the government is adopting a multi-pronged
approach to drug control, with four drug rehabilitation centers
set up in Taipei, Taichung, Kaohsiung and Taitung.
</P>
<P>
On drug crackdowns, Shih said Taiwan is working with Thailand,
Vietnam, Japan, Malaysia and Australia to form a regional drug
prevention network.
