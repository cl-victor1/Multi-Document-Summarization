<P>
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) presidential candidate Frank
Hsieh will embark on an islandwide tour in three stages starting
Saturday as a high-profile warm-up for the 2008 election.
</P>
<P>
Hsieh's campaign office staff said the first leg of the tour will
last until mid-June. He is scheduled to visit Jenwu township in
Kaohsiung County, Hsinpu township in Hsinchu County, Shengkang
township in Taichung County, Wanan township in Penghu County, and
Taitung County.
</P>
<P>
Hsieh will be showing his concern for the aboriginal and Hakka
peoples, the outlying island and the distinctive industry of each
place, according to his office.
</P>
<P>
In every place, Hsieh will speak at temples, hold a meeting under
trees or meet local people to listen to their views for reference
in chartering his platforms.
</P>
<P>
His tour will be in stark contrast to that of opposition
Kuomintang presidential candidate Ma Ying-jeou, the staff said,
noting that Ma's "bicycle around the island" tour last month,
which covered 675 km from southern Taiwan to northern Taiwan,
made only fleeting stops in each place.
</P>
<P>
Hsieh, who visited more than 200 villages and counties prior to
the May 6 DPP presidential primary, will include the remaining
villages and townships during his upcoming tour, his aides said.
