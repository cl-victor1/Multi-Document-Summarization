TAIWAN, JAPAN SHARE COMMON DESTINY: FORMER PRESIDENT

Tokyo,  June  1 (CNA) 06/01/07  18:30:20 (By Mike Chang and Y.F.

<P>
Former Republic of China President Lee Teng-hui urged Japanese
politicians Friday to recognize "the fact" that Japan shares a
common destiny with Taiwan although the two countries maintain no
diplomatic relations.
</P>
<P>
Under this circumstance, it would be in Japan's benefit to
enhance its ties with Taiwan, Lee said.
</P>
<P>
The former president said that although he has retired from
politics and does not hold any political power, he will try to
promote the relations between the two countries in a private
capacity.
</P>
<P>
Lee made the remarks during a news conference held after he was
presented with the first Shimpei Goto Prize in Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
On the question of Taiwan's democratization, Lee said the country
started to develop toward a democracy as early as 1990 when the
first round of constitutional reforms were launched, although
Taiwan's democratic transformation was not well-known to the
world until the first popular presidential election held in 1996.
</P>
<P>
The prize was awarded to Lee by the Japanese publisher Fijiwara
Shoten's Goto Shimpei Organization in recognition of his
contribution to Taiwan's urbanization and democratization.
</P>
<P>
The event attracted approximately 160 participants, including
opinion leaders from various sectors.
