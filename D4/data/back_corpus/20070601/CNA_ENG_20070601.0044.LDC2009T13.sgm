INTERNATIONAL FEDERATION OF JOURNALISTS BACKS TAIWAN COVERING WHA
</HEADLINE>

Moscow, June 1 (CNA) 06/01/07  23:16:16 (By Chang Hung-kuang and
T.C. Jiang)
</P>
<P>
The International Federation of Journalists (IFJ) passed a
resolution Friday in support of Taiwanese reporters' rights to
cover the World Health Assembly (WHA).
</P>
<P>
The IFJ also condemned the United Nations for discriminating
against Taiwanese reporters in this regard.
</P>
<P>
The moves came after the Association of Taiwan Journalists (ATJ)
initiated a proposal at the IFJ World Congress in Moscow to win
the IFJ's backing of Taiwanese reporters' rights to cover the
annual WHA, the decision-making arm of the World Health
Organization (WHO).
</P>
<P>
More than 100 member countries passed the proposal, while issuing
a condemnation on the U.N.'s refusal to give Taiwanese
journalists WHA press passes.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. has refused to issue the press passes since 2004 on the
grounds that Taiwan is not a U.N. member and is thus not allowed
to enter any U.N. building, ATJ President Chen Hsiao-yi said at
the congress.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. has violated the Universal Declaration of Human Rights
and sacrificed the freedom of the press, Chen said, adding that
the Taiwan people should be entitled to such rights.
</P>
<P>
Also noting that Taiwan withdrew from the U.N. in 1971, but the
U.N. waited until 2004 to shut Taiwan out of the WHA, Chen
attributed the reason to the fact that the U.N. came under
pressure from China.
</P>
<P>
The IFJ passed the proposal unanimously and agreed to continue to
mount pressure on the U.N. and to ask the U.N. to agree to allow
Taiwanese reporters with international press passes issued by the
IFJ to cover the WHA.
</P>
<P>
Delegates from China attended the congress but make no comments.
