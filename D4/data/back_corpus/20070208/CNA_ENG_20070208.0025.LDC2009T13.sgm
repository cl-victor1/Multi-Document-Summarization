NCTU TO DEVELOP SECOND GENERATION ELECTRONIC EYES

National Chiao Tung University (NCTU) is aiming to develop the
second generation of electronic eyes, equipped with higher
resolution and wireless power supplies, sources at the Hsinchu-
based university said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
NCTU President Wu Chung-yu said that professor Liu Wen-tai at the
University of California, Santa Cruz, invented the first
generation of electronic eyes. However, their applicability
remains limited, so Liu and NCTU have agreed to an arrangement to
expand their capacity.
</P>
<P>
Wu said the new research team would bring together experts from
both biomedical science and electronic engineering.
</P>
<P>
As for the current version, the device uses 16-pixel chips as
artificial light receptors. When implanted into the eyes, the
chips serve as light receptors on retina, enabling the visually
impaired to regain partial vision.
</P>
<P>
Seven patients that took part in the experiment at University of
California can now read alphabetical eye-charts and the outline
of objects after undergoing the procedures.
</P>
<P>
However, the field of vision is confined and the chips are
reliant on wired power supplies, both of which limit its range of
application, Wu noted.
</P>
<P>
Wu said the goal of the new team is to improve the device with
256-pixel chips to offer greater vision and employ wireless or
solar batteries as a power source, thereby reducing the
inconveniences of a hard-wired power supply.
