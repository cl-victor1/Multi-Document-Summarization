NO NEED TO ASSOCIATE `NAME-CHANGE' DRIVE WITH CHANGING NATION'S
NAME

Taipei, Feb. 8 (CNA) 02/08/07  22:59:55 (By Lilian Wu)

There is "no need" to associate the current name-change drive
with the changing of the nation's official name, President Chen
Shui-bian's top aide said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Chiou I-jen, secretary-general to the president, made the remarks
after Chen expressed his stance of supporting the drive to change
the names of state-owned companies and suggested that the name of
Chunghwa Post Co. be changed to Taiwan Post in his online
newsletter published earlier that day.
</P>
<P>
Chiou pointed out that "the assessment of the name-changes has
been going on for quite a long time, although the ball only
started rolling recently, so that the public might think the
government only thought about promoting the matter recently."
</P>
<P>
Chen first floated the name-change drive in 2004 to avoid Taiwan
enterprises being mistaken for Chinese companies.
</P>
<P>
But he also said the scope of the changes will be left to the
discretion of the state-owned enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Chiou claimed there is no need to associate the name-changes with
the changing of the nation's official name, which the president
promised not to do in his inaugural addresses in 2000 and 2004.
</P>
<P>
He said the "plight of Taiwan lies in the fact that it can't
change its official name but also can't have its official name
recognized by the international community."
</P>
<P>
"Under the circumstances, the current name-change move is the
only resort we have if we want our enterprises to enter the
international community," he said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that there is a China Steel Corp. based in Taiwan and a
Chinese company bearing similar name, which could be confusing if
both were to be members of the International Iron and Steel
Institute, adding that China Shipbuilding Corp. (CSBC) and
Chinese Petroleum Corp. (CPC) have the same problem, although the
Ministry of Economic Affairs said recently it plans to change
these to "CSBC, Taiwan" and "CPC, Taiwan" to underscore that they
are Taiwan businesses.
</P>
<P>
Asked whether Taiwan's central bank -- the Central Bank of China
(CBC) -- should also change its name, Chiou said this would be
best.
</P>
<P>
But as the CBC takes part in a great many international financial
organizations, the CBC and the Executive Yuan will have to assess
the scope of any change, he added.
</P>
<P>
Asked if the president supports "the stance of ruling Democratic
Progressive Party Chairman Yu Shyi-kun's drive to obliterate the
last vestiges of the authoritarian rule of the late President
Chiang Kai-shek," Chiou said that "there is nothing to oppose."
</P>
<P>
"The blotting out of Chiang's last vestiges in Taiwan is a
substantial move under a big concept," he said, adding that
emerging democratic countries have shown the same tendencies in
cutting all lingering influences of the past authoritarian rule.
</P>
<P>
Yu has accused Chiang of being the culprit responsible for the
2-28 incident of 1947, in which Chiang's Nationalist government
sent troops to crush a revolt in Taiwan, resulting in the deaths
of thousands, and proposed that the guards stationed at Chiang's
temporary mausoleum in northern Taiwan be removed.
