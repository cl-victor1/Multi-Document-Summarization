BEIJING DREAMS OF DPP FAILURE TO BE DISAPPOINTED: MAC HEAD
</HEADLINE>

Washington,  Feb. 7 (CNA) 02/08/07  20:48:38 (By Flor Wang) (By

Beijing would certainly be disappointed if it expects Taiwan's
ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) to fail in the 2008
presidential election, Cabinet-level Mainland Affairs Council
(MAC) Chairman Joseph Wu said here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Wu, who is currently visiting the United States, made the
comments  at  the Twin-Oaks  Garden  during  a meeting  with
Chinese-language media.
</P>
<P>
Quoting some U.S. think tank members who recently visited China,
Wu said that ranking Beijing officials displayed obvious
reluctance to see the DPP once again win in Taiwan's upcoming
presidential election.
</P>
<P>
However, Wu pointed out that Beijing seems to have become more
mature in handling its relations with Taiwan's democratization.
</P>
<P>
For instance, he said, Beijing did not halt its negotiations with
Taiwan on opening special cross-Taiwan Strait charter flights
last year when the opposition "pan-blue alliance" mobilized to
launch a recall vote against President Chen Shui-bian nor when
the mayoral elections were held in Taipei and Kaohsiung last
December.
</P>
<P>
"I prefer to assume that Beijing would observe Taiwan's future
elections, including December's legislative elections and the
March 2008 presidential election, with a more mature attitude, "
the MAC chief said, adding that "otherwise, it will be upset
again, just as it was in 2000 and 2004."
</P>
<P>
In a keynote speech delivered during a visit earlier the same day
to the Center for Strategic and International Studies, Wu said
that Beijing seems to have eased its policies toward Taiwan in
some fields, such as agreeing to launch cross-strait charter
flights on major festivals and for humanitarian purposes and
allowing Chinese tourists to visit Taiwan, while flexing its
muscle in other areas, including  further squeezing  Taiwan's
international  space and continuing its military buildup aimed at
Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Wu expressed concern that negative developments in cross-strait
relations will eliminate positive elements in bilateral
interactions.
</P>
<P>
He also forecast that two-way exchanges could slow down due to
major political events that are set to evolve in the second half
of this year, both in Taiwan and China. ENDITEM/jnc
