MAC HEAD CALLS FOR STRONGER JAPAN-US-TAIWAN ALLIANCE
</HEADLINE>

Washington, Feb. 7 (CNA) 02/08/07  17:18:33 (By Chiehyu Lin and

Mainland Affairs Council Chairman Joseph Wu on Wednesday called
for stronger alliance between the United States, Japan and Taiwan
to bolster regional security amid worries over China's recent
flexing of its military muscles.
</P>
<P>
During a speech delivered at the Center for Strategic and
International Studies think tank, Wu said China's Jan. 11
destruction of an old Chinese weather satellite by a warhead
launched from an intercontinental ballistic missile "demonstrated
that China has every intention of expanding its military power,
and even of trying to militarize space."
</P>
<P>
The anti-satellite test "sent a signal that is very clear to any
countries concerned about a possible future conflict between
Taiwan and China," Wu said.
</P>
<P>
China's destruction of the satellite also posed a threat to U.S.
efforts to protect security in Taiwan and around the Asia-Pacific
region, he asserted.
</P>
<P>
Wu said this move proved the hypocrisy of a white paper issued by
the People's Liberation Army (PLA) last year which claimed that
all of the military actions of the PLA were aimed at spurring
"peace."
</P>
<P>
Besides the United States and Taiwan, China also had Japan in
mind when it chose Jan. 11 as the date for the test, Wu said
during his speech. He said the test coincided with a trip to
Europe by Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, who cautioned
Europe's leaders that lifting an arms embargo against China could
threaten security in Asia.
</P>
<P>
Wu noted that it came as Abe's conservative government upgraded
the Japanese Defense Agency to a full ministry, which raised
worries about the state of postwar pacifism in China's
traditional rival, Japan.
</P>
<P>
"We need to consider a possible stronger alliance between the
United States and Japan, and stronger and closer cooperation in
security matters between Taiwan and the United States in order to
deal with a multipronged security threat in East Asia," he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Wu also stressed that Beijing has continued to
strangle Taiwan's activities in the international community over
the past year -- in seven incidents last year, Beijing tried to
press Taiwan to change its formal designations used in NGO
organizations.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan would not be that active in pushing for the use of
"Taiwan" as the formal name of the country in the international
community should Beijing relent in pressing Taiwan over the
issue, Wu asserted.
