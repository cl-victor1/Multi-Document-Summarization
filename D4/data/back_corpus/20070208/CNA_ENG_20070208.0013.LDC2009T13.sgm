Police seized about 320,000 weight-loss tablets containing
amphetamine in a search of a biotechnology plant in northern
Taoyuan County Thursday, detaining a 45-year-old woman identified
as Chang Wen-hsin.
</P>
<P>
Police said Chang has sold some 17 million such tablets through
various department stores in Taiwan over the last five years and
has earned more than NT$100 million (US$3.03 million) from the
sales.
</P>
<P>
Chang, who sold cosmetics, is very familiar with marketing
products through department stores, according to the police.
</P>
<P>
The police were tipped off about the possible presence of illicit
substances in the tablets by the mother of flight attendant who
became addicted to the tablets and committed suicide recently.
</P>
<P>
Chang told police that she found the medication in Shanghai
several years ago and began using it herself. After discovering
the effectiveness of the tablets, she began smuggling them into
Taiwan via various channels.
</P>
<P>
Although claiming that the tablets only contain traditional
Chinese herbal medicine, Chang revealed that she also suffered
from bouts of depression after starting to take the tablets,
which police said they believe is one of the side- effects of the
substances contained in the tablets.
