A dozen people gathered outside the Taipei office of the American
Institute in Taiwan (AIT) Thursday, requesting that the U.S.
government extradite fugitive Rebar Asia Pacific Group founder
Wang You-theng.
</P>
<P>
Accompanied by ruling Democratic Progressive Party legislator
Wang Tu-fa, several members of Taiwan Association of University
Professors (TAUP) displayed slogans in both Chinese and English
in front of the AIT office, appealing to officials within to
convey to the U.S. government the desire of Taiwan's people to
see Wangs brought home to face justice.

<P>
Wang, who was taken into custody by U.S. immigration officials
for traveling on invalid Republic of China and Dominican Republic
passports, has been put on Taiwan's list of most wanted fugitives
after beginning his fugitive tour with his wife in early January.
</P>
<P>
The tycoon is wanted by Taiwanese judicial authorities for his
suspected involvement in a series of crimes, including forgery,
fraud, insider trading, and embezzlement of corporate fund of his
gigantic group.
</P>
<P>
TAUP Chairman Tsai Ting-kuei expressed hope that the U.S.
government will extradite the Wangs based on the principles of
democracy and the rule by law.
</P>
<P>
Stressing that the United States is supposed to be in the
vanguard of democracy and the rule by law, and not a paradise for
criminals on the lam, Wang Tu-fa urged the U.S. government to
help repatriate the Wangs to Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
The TAUP members had one small conflict with police, however, the
protest ended peacefully after AIT officials accepted the
petition from the professors.
