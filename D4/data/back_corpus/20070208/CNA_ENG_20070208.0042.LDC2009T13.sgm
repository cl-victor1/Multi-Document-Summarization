Criteria for students from Hong Kong and Macau applying to study
in Taiwan have been further relaxed in a bid to allow more young
people from these two areas to receive education in Taiwan, a
Ministry of Education (MOE) official said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The relaxed regulations -- which went into effect this month --
allow Hong Kong or Macau citizens who have lived there for six
consecutive years to apply to study in Taiwan. Previously, the
criterion was eight years, said Lin Shu-chen, executive secretary
of the MOE's Mainland Affairs Task Force.
</P>
<P>
Lin, however, pointed out that the eight-year-residence criterion
is still required under the new regulations for Hong Kong or
Macau applicants wishing to study medicine, dentistry and
traditional Chinese medicine in Taiwan's colleges and
universities.
</P>
<P>
The new regulations also allow Hong Kong or Macau youths who have
finished junior high school education in Taiwan to attend Taiwan
vocational senior high schools or five-year junior colleges
without having to pass entrance exams.
</P>
<P>
According to Lin, Taiwan's colleges and universities reserve up
to 10 percent of their enrollments for overseas Chinese or
Taiwanese descendants and students from Hong Kong or Macau.

Taiwan received 154 freshmen students from Hong Kong and 513 from
Macau in the 2005 academic year, Lin said.
