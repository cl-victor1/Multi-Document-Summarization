Minister  of  Transportation  and Communications Tsai Duei said
Thursday the ministry plans to open the Hsuehshan tunnel linking
Taipei and Yilan counties to large passenger vehicles in June to
mark the anniversary of the tunnel's formal opening June 16,
2006.

During an inspection tour in Yilan County, Tsai said his ministry
will honor its promise to open the tunnel to large passenger
vehicles on the first anniversary of its opening to cars, since
the traffic situation has been smooth.

<P>
The Hsuehshan tunnel, the most difficult part in the construction
of the 54.3-km Peiyi Freeway, is the longest highway tunnel in
East Asia and the fifth-longest in the world. It was opened to
traffic June 16 last year after 15 years of construction.
</P>
<P>
As the tunnel is only open to small cars, Yilan residents have
been urging the government to open it soon to large passenger
vehicles to further boost tourism in Yilan.
</P>
<P>
According to Tsai, the ministry is planning supplementary rescue
measures to cope with possible accidents in the tunnel in
preparation for the opening.

<P>
Meanwhile, Yilan County Magistrate Lu Kuo-hua instructed related
agencies to adopt countermeasures in advance of the possible
swarm of tourists from around the country.
