TAIWAN COMMUNICATING CLOSELY WITH U.S. ON FUGITIVE TYCOON: MOFA
</HEADLINE>

Taipei, Feb. 8 (CNA) 02/08/07  19:39:08 (By Lilian Wu)
</P>
<P>
Taiwan has been communicating closely with the United States on
the case of Wang You-theng, fugitive founder of the Rebar Asia
Pacific Group, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
MOFA spokesman Wang Chien-yeh made the remarks after the U.S.
Immigration and Naturalization Service announced that a court
hearing will be set for 8 a.m. Tuesday at Wang's detention center
in Los Angeles (or midnight Wednesday Taipei time).
</P>
<P>
Wang said that Taiwan's representative office in Washington D.C.
and its office in Los Angeles have worked closely with the U.S.
on the case and the ministry has kept abreast of the latest
developments.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan also hopes to convey evidence against Wang to the United
States, hoping that the U.S. court will hand down a ruling
favorable to Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan will also work closely with related U.S. agencies through
the judicial assistance agreement signed between Taiwan and the
United States in March 2002, Wang added.
</P>
<P>
Wang said that Taiwan will respect the judicial process of the
United States, but will by no means sit by idly, stating that
Taiwan will do everything possible to facilitate the repatriation
of Wang to face justice in Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Wang is wanted in Taiwan for his suspected involvement in a
series of accounting frauds and embezzlement scandals surrounding
his business group.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan put Wang on its most-wanted list in mid-January. He tried
to fly to Myanmar via Singapore Jan. 31 but was sent back to the
United States Feb. 2 by Singaporean authorities because he lacked
the proper travel documents.
</P>
<P>
Wang arrived in Los Angeles Feb. 3 and was taken into custody
because his Taiwan and Dominican Republic passports were
invalidated as a result of efforts by the Taiwan authorities.
</P>
<P>
Wang fled to the United States shortly after China Rebar Co. and
Chia Hsin Food &amp; Synthetic Fiber Co., two subsidiaries under
the Rebar group, filed for insolvency protection late last
December. The revelations of the two financially-distressed
companies triggered a run on the Chinese Bank, another Rebar
affiliate, and a probe into the other subsidiaries of the group,
which turned up ever more irregularities in a snowballing
scandal.
