Taipei, Feb. 8 (CNA) 02/08/07  19:10:42 (By Lilian Wu)

A 29-year-old man and his girlfriend were arrested for smuggling
heroin from Cambodia into Taiwan in the guise of chocolate,
police reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Police seized more than 2,800 grams of high-purity heroin, with a
street value of NT$70 million (US$2.13 million).
</P>
<P>
The man, surnamed Shih, and his 23-year-old girl friend, surnamed
Huang, were hoping to get through the inspection when air traffic
at the Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport was thrown into chaos
Wednesday night due to heavy fog.
</P>
<P>
Police noted that they were carrying out monitoring operations
over a fraud case when they inadvertently discovered a drug
smuggling ring that solicits those who have no prior criminal
record to work as couriers, or "mules."
</P>
<P>
The couriers were asked to travel to such countries as Thailand,
Vietnam and Cambodia, and bring back the controlled substance.
</P>
<P>
To evade detection, the heroin was coated with heavy layers of
chocolate and wrapped up in tinfoil paper, making it difficult to
detect using X-rays or sniffer dogs. But police were tipped off
in advance and therefore were able to catch the couple despite
their ingenuity.
