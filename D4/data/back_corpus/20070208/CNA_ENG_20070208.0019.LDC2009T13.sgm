MUSEUM SCHOLAR REMINISCES ON TAIWAN EXPERIENCE, TALKS CHINESE
CULTURE

Taipei,  Feb. 8 (CNA) 02/08/07  17:09:33 (By Chris Wang)

As an eyewitness and a longtime observer of Taiwan's development
over the past 30 years, British Museum scholar Jan Stuart told
the CNA on the sidelines of an international academic conference
that she has been constantly amazed that it's possible for
Taiwanese identity and Chinese identity to coexist.
</P>
<P>
Currently in Taiwan for the promotion of a British Museum
artifacts exhibition and an international conference on the art
and culture of China's Northern Sung Dynasty (xxx-xxxx) , the
Asia Department keeper of the British Museum has also been busy
meeting acquaintances during his visit. And she hasn't needed a
guide.
</P>
<P>
Stuart, a U.S. citizen, speaks excellent Mandarin and is very
familiar with Taipei City because she lived in Taiwan for a total
of one-and-a-half years on two separate occasions in the 1970s
and the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
She visited Taiwan for the first time in 1976 "to see if studying
Chinese in Taiwan could be an option" and ended up staying for
six months, living with a well-educated couple in the Wanhua
district of Taipei City.
</P>
<P>
"We lived in an old community and a house with no hot water. It
was the first time I realized that people with the same education
level enjoy different living standards, " Stuart said, describing
the experience as "culture shock."
</P>
<P>
With her interest in Chinese culture growing, Stuart came back to
Taiwan in 1982 and enrolled  in a National Taiwan University
Chinese-language program, living this time on Roosevelt Road for
nine months. "I've been surprised to see how fast Taiwan has
changed as a country since that time," she told the CNA.
</P>
<P>
Based on her experience and observations, Stuart presents a
unique perspective on Taiwanese culture and Chinese culture.
</P>
<P>
There are many regions in China, such as Tibet and Xinjiang, that
have distinct cultures, Stuart said, adding that this is the
reason why she thinks the Taiwanese identity can coexist with the
Chinese identity.
</P>
<P>
"From the viewpoint of an outsider, "it's possible to be
Taiwanese and Chinese at the same time, " she said, adding,
however, that she realizes it is not easy to separate politics
from culture, especially in Taiwan's case.
</P>
<P>
Stuart said that she first fell in love with Chinese culture
after seeing Chinese paintings as a high school student and that
her experience in Taiwan facilitated her decision to pursue
Chinese culture research as a career.
</P>
<P>
Stuart obtained both her bachelor's degree and master's degree at
Yale University and worked in the field of Chinese culture
studies thereafter.
</P>
<P>
Specializing in art and culture from China's Sung Dynasty
(960-1279) to the Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) , Stuart worked in the
Smithsonian Institute before joining the British Museum three
months ago. She is now based in London.
</P>
<P>
In addition to scholastic research, Stuart enjoys "visual arts of
every country and form" as well as folk practices. During her
time in Taiwan,  she spent numerous  hours watching  outdoor
puppetry performances.
</P>
<P>
"I enjoy observing how people live, " she said.
</P>
<P>
A total of 271 artifacts collected by the British Museum valued
at more than NT$50 billion are being exhibited at the National
Palace Museum in Taipei City from Feb. 4 to May 27. This marks
the first collaboration between the two museums.
