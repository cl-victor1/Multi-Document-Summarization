Washington,  Feb.  15 (CNA) 02/16/07  13:45:15 (By Chiehyu Lin
and Y.F. Low)

Taiwan's ongoing name rectification campaign will not include
changing the country's official title or flag and thus will not
violate President Chen Shui- bian's "four noes" commitments, a
ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) legislator said here
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Hsiao Bi-khim, who is on a visit in Washington D.C., told Taiwan
reporters that she made the assurance to the U.S. side during her
meeting with U.S. officials and members of major think tanks.
</P>
<P>
According to Hsiao, the U.S. officials were surprised at Taiwan's
move and expressed concern about whether the campaign will be
further expanded to include changing Taiwan's national title and
affect President Chen's commitments to the United States.
</P>
<P>
Hsiao said she has explained to the U.S. officials that Taiwan's
efforts to change the names of state-owned enterprises containing
references to China are aimed at avoiding confusion and that the
DPP has no intention of pushing the campaign further.
</P>
<P>
Also, Hsiao said the United States is concerned about whether the
candidates to be fielded by various political parties in Taiwan
for the 2008 presidential election will take into account the
position of the United States while putting forth their policies,
especially whether the DPP's candidate will follow Chen's
commitments to the United States.
</P>
<P>
In his 2000 and 2004 inauguration addresses, Chen pledged that if
China has no intention of using force against Taiwan, he will not
declare Taiwan independence, not change the official name of the
country, not include the "state-to-state" concept on cross-strait
relations in the Constitution, and not promote a referendum to
change the cross-strait status quo.
</P>
<P>
On the corruption charges against former opposition Kuomintang
Chairman Ma Ying- jeou, Hsiao said the U.S. side is paying much
attention to Ma's ability to manage the crisis triggered by his
indictment and how he is going to cope with other challenges.
</P>
<P>
Hsiao said that although the decline in Ma's popularity following
his indictment has boosted the DPP's confidence concerning the
next presidential election, the DPP still needs to work harder to
win the people's support.
</P>
<P>
The anti-corruption center of the Taiwan High Court Prosecutor's
Office indicted Ma Tuesday on corruption charges after
determining that he had embezzled NT$11.17 million (US$337,650)
from a special allowance fund designated for his discretionary
use during his two terms as Taipei mayor from 1998 to 2006.
</P>
<P>
While resigning from the KMT chairmanship immediately after the
indictment, Ma claimed that he is innocent and announced his
decision to run for the presidency in 2008 to prove his integrity
"via voter support" in the election.
