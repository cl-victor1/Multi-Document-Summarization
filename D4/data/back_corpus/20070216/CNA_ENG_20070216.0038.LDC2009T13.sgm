years.

Guo made the announcement at Hon Hai's year-end dinner party
after outlining the group's US$ 119 million total investment in
11 subsidiary company projects in China, covering a wide
geographical range including Liaoning, Shandung, Shanghai,
Jiangsu, and Hubei provinces.

Guo said that Hon Hai's investment in Vietnam will be centered in
the country's capital Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City, with two
industrial parks to be constructed this year to house production
facilities for all of the group's product lines. Construction of
the remaining three will get under way later.
