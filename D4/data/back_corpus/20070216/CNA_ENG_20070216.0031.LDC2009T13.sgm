The risk of death among senior citizens who exercise regularly is
35 percent lower than those who do not, according to the results
of a study released Friday by the National Health Research
Institute (NHRI).
</P>
<P>
The study was based on data collected via tracking the exercise
habits and health conditions of 2,113 people aged 65 or above
over a two-year period.
</P>
<P>
The study found that the more the seniors exercise, the better
the effect of lowering their risk of death, with the risk
dropping significantly if they exhaust more than 1,000 kcal of
energy per week through exercise.
</P>
<P>
To exhaust 1,000 kcal of energy per week, a person needs to walk
at least 40 minutes per day, researchers said.
</P>
<P>
The study shows that walking is the most popular exercise among
senior citizens in Taiwan, along with tai chi, wai tan kung and
folk dance.
</P>
<P>
However, the study found that of all senior citizens in Taiwan,
only 60 percent of men and 54 percent of women exercise
regularly.
</P>
<P>
Of those who exercise regularly, only 50 percent exercise enough
to exhaust 1,000 kcal of energy per week, according to the study.
