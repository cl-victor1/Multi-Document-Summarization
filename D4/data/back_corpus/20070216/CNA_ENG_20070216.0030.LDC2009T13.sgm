The Tainan District Prosecutor's Office recently cracked a
criminal ring that produced and sold some 240,000 bottles of fake
red wine over the past two years, the prosecution said Friday,
adding that the wine was mostly sold to catering services.

The prosecutors and investigators searched several sites related
to a food company and a winery in Kaohsiung and Tainan counties
and seized counterfeit sorghum liquor and the fake red wine.
Continuing investigations  over  the next two days uncovered  the
ring's operations, the prosecutors said.

The winery used grape juice, red wine extract and flavoring to
produce the fake wine, which it sold to another company for NT$70
to NT$80 per bottle. The second company sold it for NT$120 to
NT$150 per bottle, according to the prosecutors, who added that
most of the estimated 240,000 bottles had been sold to catering
services and probably had already been consumed.
