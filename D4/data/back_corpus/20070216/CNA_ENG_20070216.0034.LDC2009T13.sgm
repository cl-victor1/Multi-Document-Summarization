Approved overseas Chinese and foreign investment in Taiwan in
January totaled US$577 million, down 87.3 percent from the same
month of last year, the Investment Commission under the Ministry
of Economic Affairs said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Commission officials attributed the decrease mainly to the high
comparison base caused by Philips acquiring Taiwan Semiconductor
Manufacturing Corp. shares at US$3.76 billion in January last
year. If this factor is excluded, inbound investment in Taiwan in
January for 2007 would show an increase of 141.54 percent from
the same month of last year.

<P>
Meanwhile, the commission approved 28 outbound investment
projects in January worth a total of US$193.8 billion, up 246
percent from the year-earlier level.
</P>
<P>
On investment in China, the commission approved 105 investment
projects worth US$809.81 million, up 46.95 percent from the same
period of last year.
