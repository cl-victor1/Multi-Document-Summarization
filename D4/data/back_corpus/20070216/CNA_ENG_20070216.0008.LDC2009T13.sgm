The percentages of adult children living with their parents on
the two sides of the Taiwan Strait have both been in steady
decline, but they remain higher than that in the United States,
an economist said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Cyrus C. Y. Chu, an academic at Academia Sinica, said in a speech
delivered at National Taiwan University that more than 60 percent
of adult children lived together with their parents in China in
the 1990s, compared with 50 percent in Taiwan and 40 percent in
the United States.
</P>
<P>
According to his study, Chu said the average number of people in
a family has also dropped on both sides of the Taiwan Strait,
from slightly more than four two decades ago to about three at
present.
</P>
<P>
In his view, Chu said, many of those who choose to live together
with their parents are not necessarily doing so because of filial
piety, but rather because they need their parents' help in caring
for their young children, particularly those aged under 3.
</P>
<P>
"Studies show that adult children tend to become less willing to
live with their parents when their income increases, " Chu said,
adding that daughters-in-law tend not to be inclined to live with
their parents-in-law when they earn more.
</P>
<P>
According to Chu, sons-in-law also tend to be less willing to
live with their parents-in-law if they have a high income.
</P>
<P>
In Taiwan, Chu said, the parental preference for sons over
daughters has been declining, with the percentage of those
wanting boys falling from 68 percent to 46 percent in a series of
his studies . A similar trend is also seen in China, Chu added
without elaborating.
</P>
<P>
Chu further said the average age of women when they give birth
for the first time is also steadily increasing on both sides of
the Taiwan Strait, with the number of women giving birth to their
first child after 30 years of age rising continuously.
</P>
<P>
In one of Chu's studies, 17 percent of all children born in China
were born to mothers aged over 30, with the figure in Taiwan
being 48 percent.
</P>
<P>
Chu's studies also found that American parents usually do not
pass all of their assets or property on to their children before
their death because, if they do so, their children may no longer
visit them regularly. In America, he said, the richer the
parents, the more frequent their children come back to see them.
</P>
<P>
In Taiwan, Chu said, the frequency of children visiting their
parents tends to remain high or even become higher after their
parents pass their assets to their children. The phenomenon is
probably related to pressure from siblings and society, he
explained.
