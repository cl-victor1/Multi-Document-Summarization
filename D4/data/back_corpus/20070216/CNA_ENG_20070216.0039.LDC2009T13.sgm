Taipei, Feb. 16 (CNA) 02/16/07  21:18:00 (By Y.C. Jou)

The amount of the country's currency issued has hit a record high
NT$1,376.7 billion (US$41.75 billion) , the Central Bank said
Friday.
</P>
<P>
The currency issued, meaning the cash in circulation, often peaks
on the day before Lunar New Years' Eve, the Central Bank said,
because companies are paying year-end bonus and people are buying
more.
</P>
<P>
The figure has been growing every year since 2003, this year
growing NT$57.7 billion, or 4.38%, over last year's amount,
according to Central Bank records.
</P>
<P>
New Year holidays this year last as long as nine days and people
need to keep more cash on hand, said Chang Hsing-wu, a Central
Bank official who oversees the business of currency issuance.
</P>
<P>
Some analysts, however,  said that the trend towards ever
increasing amounts of currency issued is, in part, due to the
ever closer cross-strait economic ties as many Taiwanese people
bring Taiwan dollars when they travel to China, where the
currency is also used in a number of cities.
</P>
<P>
The figure will go down after the New Year holidays, especially
after the Lantern Festival, when people again start banking their
money, Chang said.
