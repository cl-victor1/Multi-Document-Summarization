Over 2,500 people traveled between the two sides of the Taiwan
Strait via the "mini three links" routes linking Taiwan's Kinmen
to China's Xiamen and Quanzhou in Fujian Province, with 60
percent of the travelers  being Taiwanese businessmen operating
in China or their family members, according to Kinmen officials
in charge of port affairs.

Taiwanese travelers were on their way to return home for Chinese
New Year celebrations which begin Feb. 18 this year.

Shipments between Kinmen and the two Chinese coastal cities have
increased since Feb. 10 as part of special transportation
services between Taiwan and China during the Lunar New Year
festival, one of the most important traditional festivals in
Chinese society.

Since then, there have been over 10,000 passengers traveling from
Xiamen and Quanzhou to Kinmen, and some 730 people taking ferries
