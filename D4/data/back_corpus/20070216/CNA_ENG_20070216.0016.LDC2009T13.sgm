for the ruling Democratic Progressive Party's (DPP's) nomination
for the 2008 presidential election.

holiday to contemplate national issues such as social welfare and
taxation reform, after which he will register for the party's
primary for the election.

participation in the race and that he will reciprocate their
expectations seriously.

to Kaohsiung City.

Hsieh, who is a former mayor of the southern port city, was
greeted by crowds of local residents urging him to run for
president.

He is the first DPP politician to publicly announce his intention
of entering the race for the party's nomination for the 2008
presidential election.

According to a timetable for the presidential primary finalized
by the DPP's Central Standing Committee Wednesday, registration
for the primary will be open from March 5-9.

A vote by party members is scheduled for May 6, while opinion
