Premier Su Tseng-chang has not had any plans to resign from his
post to prepare for a bid for the presidency in 2008, Executive
Yuan spokesman Cheng Wen-tsang said in a statement Friday.
</P>
<P>
Cheng made the remarks in response to an Apple Daily report
Friday that said Su had planned to resign prior to the Chinese
New Year and to announce his presidential bid but then changed
his mind after President Chen Shui-bian asked him to enter the
race without quitting his post until after the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party's (DPP's) primary for the presidential
election.
</P>
<P>
Cheng said that the daily's  report was "based merely on
speculation" and that the newspaper failed to verify its report
before printing it.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile,  Ker Chien-ming, a DPP legislative caucus whip,
confirmed  that President  Chen will mediate  among the DPP's
presidential aspirants concerning the timetable for the party's
presidential primary.
</P>
<P>
As to whether Su should resign or not to join the DPP primary,
Ker said that these are matters for the president and the premier
to decide upon and that the DPP legislative caucus will fully
respect whatever decision they make.
</P>
<P>
DPP Legislator Lin Chung-mo, however, noted that once a DPP
official is chosen as the party's candidate for the presidential
election, he or she should resign from their post immediately to
focus on the race.
</P>
<P>
Vice President Annette Lu, Premier Su and former premiers Frank
Hsieh and Yu Shyi-kun are widely seen as "the four DPP
heavyweights" who are likely to compete to represent the party in
the election. However, none of them have publicly announced their
decision to join the race.
</P>
<P>
Registration for the DPP primary will be open March 5-9, and a
vote by party members is scheduled for May 6, while opinion polls
on the support ratings of the contenders will be conducted May
7-28. The outcome of the primary is slated to be announced May
30.
