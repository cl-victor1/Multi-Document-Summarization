GARDEN OF HOPE LAUNCHES CAMPAIGN TO HELP SEXUALLY-ABUSED CHILDREN

Taipei,  Feb. 16 (CNA) 02/16/07  17:13:35 (by Steve Bercic)

Estimating that an average of 52 children in Taiwan are sexually
abused every day, the Garden of Hope Foundation has decided to
launch a "Flying Dandelion" campaign to raise funds to help the
victims of such abuse and to work to eradicate the problem.
</P>
<P>
The foundation said that it hopes to raise NT$20 million
(US$607,902.7) to be used toward setting up victim treatment
services at its centers around Taiwan, educating the public about
the problem of sexual abuse of children, and working to prevent
such crimes.
</P>
<P>
Noting that there were more than 4,900 reported sex crimes around
Taiwan in 2005, foundation officials said the actual number of
cases could be seven to 10 times that figure. They added that
three out of every five sex crime victims were children.
</P>
<P>
Based on the estimate that the actual number of cases was seven
times the reported figure, that would mean that a child was
sexually abused every 27 minutes on average in Taiwan last year,
according to the officials.
</P>
<P>
Chi Hui-jung, chief executive officer of the foundation, said
that if child victims of sexual abuse do not receive therapy
early on, they could be scarred for life. "It's like a broken
arm, which if not treated immediately, will not heal properly,"
he added.
</P>
<P>
"If a child victim of sexual abuse can receive therapy to deal
with what they have experienced, they then have a much better
chance of recovering and leading a healthy, normal life," he
continued.
</P>
<P>
He further said that although the Garden of Hope Foundation has
centers in the north, south, east and west of the island, only
the foundation's center in Taipei has the resources to provide
the treatment that child victims of sexual abuse need to recover.
</P>
<P>
"Therefore, we hope to raise enough funds through our 'Flying
Dandelion' campaign to expand our treatment services to our
centers in other parts of Taiwan where they are urgently needed,
" he continued.
</P>
<P>
Currently, according to Chi, Taiwan's child sex crime prevention
and treatment services lag far behind those of other developed
countries. "In most developed countries, cases of sexual abuse of
children are exposed within one year on average, while in Taiwan,
the average is over three or four years," he said, adding that
"the costs of helping these victims recover are extremely high."
</P>
<P>
Through its campaign, the foundation also aims to enter schools
and local society to educate people on the problem of sexual
abuse of children and how to prevent it, Chi said.
</P>
<P>
He also urged everyone to report any cases of suspected sexual
abuse of children to authorities, noting that "one phone call can
change a child's entire life."
