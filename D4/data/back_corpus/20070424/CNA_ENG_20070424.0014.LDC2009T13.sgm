MAC

Taipei,  April  24 (CNA) 04/24/07  12:47:59 (By Lilian Wu)

Taiwan has no need to say at present whether it agrees to host a
leg of the Olympic torch relay, an official of the Mainland
Affairs Council (MAC) said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Liu Teh-hsun, vice chairman of the nation's body on charting
China policy, made the remarks one day after the news agency AFP
cited an official of the Beijing Olympic Games organizing
committee as saying that Taiwan has tentatively agreed that the
torch relay can pass through Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Liu denied the claim, saying that "discussions are still ongoing,
and we have no need to publicize our stance now."
</P>
<P>
He noted that as a participant in the Olympic Games, "Taiwan
naturally wants to have the honor of taking part in the torch
relay."
</P>
<P>
However he pointed out that Beijing, after being awarded the
right to host the 2008 Olympic Games, said that it would
designate Taiwan as part of China's "domestic" relay route,
rather than as part of the international circuit. He further
noted that Beijing has referred to the Chinese Taipei Olympic
Committee as "Taipei, China," which he said has "troubled us."
</P>
<P>
Liu said that Taiwan has only made "a request as have the other
Olympic members, " which is "to follow the protocol of the
Olympic Games." He noted that Taiwan's government must first
consent to allowing the torch relay to pass through Taiwan, and
that one of the conditions of granting consent is that Taiwan's
sovereignty will not be compromised.
