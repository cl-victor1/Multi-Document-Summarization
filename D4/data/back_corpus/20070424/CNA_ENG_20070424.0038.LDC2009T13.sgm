TRAVEL OPERATORS ANGRY AT RESTRICTIONS ON HOSTING CHINESE
TOURISTS

Scores of representatives of travel service operators rallied in
front of the Tourism Bureau Tuesday to protest what they called
"unreasonable restrictions placed on hosting Chinese tourists."
</P>
<P>
They said that the requirement that operators spend no less than
US$80 daily for each member of a Chinese tourist group should be
lifted.
</P>
<P>
The protest came one day after the Tourism Bureau slapped a fine
of NT$60,000 (US$1,820) on a local travel agent for failing to
provide minimum quality service to a group of Chinese tourists.
</P>
<P>
The MarcoPolo Travel Service was fined because it had arranged
for the tourists to stay at a substandard hotel in central
Taiwan, leading to one of the tourists being bitten by a rat.
</P>
<P>
The protestors are also angry that the Travel Agent Association
of the R.O.C. Taiwan is in charge of screening the hosting
arrangements of travel agents; the requirement that local travel
agents post a NT$2 million bond with the association is similarly
unpopular, and the association has requested that the government
handle the screening procedures.
</P>
<P>
The requirement that travel agencies which have not been
established for five years old not host Chinese tourist groups
should also be scrapped, they demanded.
</P>
<P>
Tourism  Bureau Deputy Director-general  Su Tsang-yang,  in
receiving the protestors, said that requiring minimum
expenditures for each member of Chinese groups is aimed at
ensuring quality service, and asked for the understanding of
travel service operators.
</P>
<P>
Su also urged the Travel Agent Association to be fair when
screening the itineraries travel service operators must submit to
host Chinese tour groups in order to a avoid conflict of
interest.
</P>
<P>
The protestors later went to the Legislative Yuan to make their
grievances heard.
</P>
<P>
The Tourism Bureau, in anticipation of a rush of Chinese tourists
to Taiwan on sightseeing tours, promoted a quality control
campaign with travel service operators last November. The
campaign calls for travel operators to promise to spend no less
than US$80 daily for each member of a Chinese tourist group,
requires that the age of tour buses used by Chinese tourist
groups not exceed seven years, and that there be no self-pay
tours during the journey.
</P>
<P>
The campaign came one month after a major traffic incident
involving Chinese tourists which left six dead, including s
Taiwanese tour guide, and 15 injured.
</P>
<P>
The tourists from Dalian in Liaoning Province were en route to
Shuili from Tungpu in central Nantou County when one of the two
buses they were traveling in skidded off the Central Cross-Island
Highway and plunged into a ravine.
