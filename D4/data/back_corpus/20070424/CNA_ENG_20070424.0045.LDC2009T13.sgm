National reconciliation of a democracy emerging from dictatorship
lies in the acknowledgement by the perpetrators for past cruelty
and the forgiveness of their victims, visiting Archbishop
Emeritus of Cape Town Desmond Mpilo Tutu said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a symposium organized by the Taiwan Foundation for
Democracy, Tutu, who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1984, said
reconciliation is a long process in which every citizen, in
addition to the victims and perpetrators, should be involved.
</P>
<P>
The former chief of South Africa's Truth and Reconciliation
Commission, who was invited by the Taiwan Foundation for
Democracy to offer his advice on Taiwan's search for transitional
justice and national reconciliation, said he has no ready answer
for Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
He said he was surprised by the keen desire of Taiwan to come to
terms with its past, but just as each of the other 20-some
countries in the world that have emerged from the shadows of
their past dictatorships, Taiwan has to grope for its own way out
of its historical dilemma.
</P>
<P>
However, Tutu said his country's experience in healing the rift
caused by apartheid may shed light on the way ahead for Taiwan
and may serve as a catalyst for reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
After the end of apartheid in South Africa, Tutu said, his
country faced calls to put those who perpetrated crimes under the
cover of apartheid on trial, similar to the war criminals tried
at Nuremberg after World War Two.
</P>
<P>
However, there were also calls for a general amnesty to all
perpetrators and for the country forget about the past and move
on, Tutu said.
</P>
<P>
The Truth and Reconciliation Commission headed by Tutu opted for
another way, offering pardons only to perpetrators who confessed
their crimes and apologized to the victims in public hearings.
</P>
<P>
In this way, Tutu said, old wounds were reopened, treated and
bandaged again, and South Africa avoided a division between its
people.
</P>
<P>
Wu Naiteh, a research fellow at Academia Sinica, echoed Tutu's
opinion in the symposium by calling for tolerance on behalf of
the victims toward their persecutors, which he said is the key to
national reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
Tutu, who arrived April 18, will wrap up his visit Wednesday.
