A man had 38.8 million Japanese yen (US$326,614) confiscated by
Taiwan customs authorities last week when he failed to declare
the foreign currency while trying to take the money out of the
country, customs officials said Tuesday.

<P>
Travelers are required to declare any foreign currency exceeding
an equivalent of US$10,000, and the man was discovered to be
carrying the Japanese money in his suitcase when he was going
through customs inspection at the Taiwan Taoyuan International
Airport April 20, the officials said.

<P>
The man claimed he was unaware he needed to declare the foreign
currency upon departure, even though he had declared it upon
entering the country, they said.
