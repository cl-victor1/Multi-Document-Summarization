The Consumers' Foundation called on the country's
telecommunications companies Tuesday to reduce their text
messaging rates, which the group said are three to five times
higher than those of neighboring countries.
</P>
<P>
According to foundation chairman Cheng Jen-hung, the six major
telecommunications companies in Taiwan charge users an average
NT$2.13 (US$0.06) for every text message sent within the same
network, compared with China's NT$0.4 and Hong Kong's NT$0.68.
</P>
<P>
For text messages sent outside of their networks, the six
companies charge users NT$2.53 per message on average, which is
also higher than China's NT$0.6 and Japan's NT$1.4, Cheng said.
</P>
<P>
Cheng urged the National Communications Commission (NCC) to pay
attention to the issue and work to have local telecommunications
companies rationalize their text messaging rates to NT$1.3 per
message for intra-network  service and NT$1.7 per message for
inter-network  service --  the most affordable rates currently
available through a domestic telecommunication company.
