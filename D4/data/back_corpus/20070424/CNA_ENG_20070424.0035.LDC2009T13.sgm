SIMULATED WARFARE DRILLS TARGET CHINESE MILITARY: MND
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  April  24 (CNA) 04/24/07  20:15:39 (By Elisa Kao)

Officers of the Ministry of National Defense (MND)  confirmed
Tuesday that the MND's just-concluded simulated computerized
warfare drills targeted the Chinese military with missiles in
counterattacking a mock surprise assault by China.
</P>
<P>
The five-day computerized warfare simulation formed part of the
large-scale combined forces' "Han Kuang" military exercises which
are conducted by the MND annually.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference held at the MND, Hsu Tai-sheng, director of
MND's Joint Operation Training and Doctrine Office, stressed that
the the five-day computerized warfare simulation, which began
April 16, only targeted Chinese military objectives and none of
its civilian installations.
</P>
<P>
According to MND officers, the computerized warfare simulated a
situation in which China attacks Taiwan's warfare command
centers, radar stations and missile bases with high-calibre
weapons in 2012, then makes a land assault on the island after
weakening Taiwan's air and marine combat ability.
</P>
<P>
In mock counterattacks, Taiwan's troops struck Chinese military
targets with missiles,  including airports,  missile bases and
observation and telecommunications installations.
</P>
<P>
However, the MND did not elaborate what kinds of missiles they
were using in the warfare simulation as the officials classified
them as confidential.
</P>
<P>
MND's spokesman Wu Chi-fang noted that the computerized warfare
drills only focused on the attacking and defensive sides, and did
not include an intervention by the United States. According to
Wu, the U.S. military observation delegation, which was here to
observe the process, expressed satisfaction regarding the content
of the MND's computerized mock drills.
</P>
<P>
However, Chiu Kuo-cheng, a deputy chief of MND in charge of
warfare planning, admitted that the warfare simulation also
reflected Taiwan's serious weakness in its anti-missile and anti-
submarine measures, which allowed the island's airports, radar
stations and missile bases on the west coast to be seriously
damaged by Chinese missiles in the simulated warfare, and China's
superiority in the number of submarines also posed a serious
threat to the security of the island.
</P>
<P>
A MND report said the experience obtained in the computerized
warfare simulation will serve as valuable references for Taiwan's
military preparedness in the future, but Taiwan's apparent
inferior anti-missile and anti-submarine combat ability represent
another urgent matter that the nation's military forces should
face.
