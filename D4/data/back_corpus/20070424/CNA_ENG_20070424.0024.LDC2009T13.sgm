The Ministry of Economic Affairs will announce in the near future
a decision to suspend exports of gravel and sand in order to
stabilize domestic supplies and protect natural resources, MOEA
Minister Steve R. L. Chen said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Chen said the policy to suspend exports was crafted under the
frame work of the Trade Act and will be implemented two months
after the date of its announcement to preempt efforts by other
countries to import Taiwanese gravel after China and Indonesia
made the resource relatively more scarce by suspending their
gravel exports.
</P>
<P>
Domestic demand for gravel and sand exceeded domestic supply
during the period Jan. 1-April 15 this year, with demand reaching
17.89 million cubic meters but supplies cresting at 17.39 million
cubic meters, Chen said. The shortfall in supplies was covered by
the release of reserves, Chen added.
</P>
<P>
Chen said the MOEA has increased the number of gravel mining
locations in operation from eight last year to 39 this year, and
will increase the volume of permitted river gravel dredging to 20
million cubic meters in order to ensure an adequate domestic
supply.
</P>
<P>
Domestic gravel prices have risen since the beginning of this
year, Chen said, adding that the MOEA and the Fair Trade
Commission will ensure that gravel and sand are sold at fair
prices and step up inspections to guard against price gouging and
hoarding.
