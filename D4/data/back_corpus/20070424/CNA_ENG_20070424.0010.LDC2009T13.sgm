OVER 80% PENSIONERS WANT MORE SAY ON PENSION FUND'S USE: POLL

More than 80 percent of those who have joined the two-year-old
portable pension system look forward to having a say in
determining how the reserve funds should be used for profit-
making, according to the results of an opinion survey released
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The survey was conducted by the Securities Investment Trust and
Consulting Association (SITCA) in cooperation with the Global
View Magazine between March 23 and April 1 to explore local wage
earners' knowledge and opinions about the relatively new portable
pension system. A total of 1,002 valid samples were collected in
the survey, which has a margin of error of plus or minus 3.1
percentage points.
</P>
<P>
Among the respondents, 44.5 percent said they are very supportive
of the proposal to revise the current law to allow for a say by
wage earners on the use of portable pension fund reserves for
lucrative investment deals; 36.1 percent said they somewhat
support the proposal; and only 16.2 percent gave a negative
response.
</P>
<P>
According to the survey, the number of wage earners who opted for
the portable pension system had reached 5.64 million as of April
18, with the total pension fund reserves accumulated under the
scheme exceeding NT$140.7 billion (US$4.26 billion) . Moreover,
the amount has been increasing by about NT$8 billion per month.
</P>
<P>
After more than a year of delay, the Legislative Yuan finally
passed the statute on the pension fund reserves management and
supervision earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
However, the survey results showed that 65 percent of the
respondents were not aware that only the government is authorized
to manage the fund and that pensioners are guaranteed a minimum
profit equivalent to the interest rate for two-year time deposits
at local banks. If the fund's earnings do not reach that level,
the government is obliged to make up the difference at the
expense of taxpayers, according to the statute.
</P>
<P>
A SITCA spokesman said the survey results indicated that the
government should step up a publicity campaign to help pensioners
better understand how the portable pension system operates as
well as their legitimate rights under the scheme.
</P>
<P>
According to the survey, 68 percent said they are not confident
of the government's efficacy in running the pension reserve
funds, while nearly 80 percent said it is inappropriate to use
taxpayer's money to make up the difference if the fund's earnings
fall below the set minimum.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, 74 percent said they are willing to accept the
consequences if they are allowed to choose investment targets for
their pension reserves, and 57 percent said they are confident in
their ability to make the right investment decisions.
</P>
<P>
Noting that many advanced countries allow pensioners to decide on
their own on the pension fund investment targets, the SITCA
spokesman said the government should follow suit by coming up
with draft law revisions.
