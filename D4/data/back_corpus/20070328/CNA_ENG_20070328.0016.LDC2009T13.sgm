Taipei,  March  28 (CNA) 03/28/07  14:50:08 (By Deborah Kuo)

The head of Taiwan's top cross-strait policyplanning body said
Wednesday that President Chen Shui-bian's administration  fully
supports  Legislative  Yuan Speaker  Wang Jin-pyng's plan to
visit China and that it will render whatever assistance that Wang
might need to facilitate the trip.
</P>
<P>
Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) Chairman Joseph Wu said that the
administration appreciates  Wang's  willingness  to inform and
communicate with it on the planned visit, in contrast to other
opposition leaders who had visited China in the past but refused
to inform the government beforehand or explain the details of the
visits afterwards.
</P>
<P>
Wu made the remarks in response to a China Times report
Wednesday, which speculated that Wang will visit Beijing sometime
in April and that his itinerary will include a meeting with
Chinese President Hu Jingtao and talks with Chinese officials
over the opening of cross-strait cargo charter flight services
and the opening of financial services exchanges. The daily also
said that President Chen Shui-bian has been kept abreast of
nearly all the details about Wang's forthcoming China visit.
</P>
<P>
Wu added that so far, no timetables regarding Wang's trip have
been finalized.
</P>
<P>
As to whether the government will recognize any consensus or
agreements that Wang might reach with the Chinese authorities
during his visit, Wu told journalists that it is still too early
to speculate on the matter.
</P>
<P>
On an allegation that Wang's forthcoming visit to China might
have been arranged by the Chinese authorities in an attempt to
influence developments in Taiwan's domestic politics, Wu said the
government is willing to facilitate Wang's visit in the belief
that Wang is more aware than any other opposition leader about
the possibility that Beijing may attempt to cause divisions among
Taiwan's political parties and that Wang's full cooperation with
the administration will help counter such efforts.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Wang would not confirm whether the China Times report
is true or false, only saying that he remains committed to
pursuing cross-strait efforts conducive to Taiwan's political
development and economic growth.
