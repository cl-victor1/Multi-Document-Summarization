Taipei,  March 28 (CNA) 03/28/07  21:52:14 (By Flor Wang)

The opposition Kuomintang (KMT) will do its utmost to maintain
the original appearance of the Chiang Kai-shek Memorial Hall
complex in downtown Taipei, as the ruling party wants to pull
down its walls and change its name, KMT acting Chairman P.K.
Chiang said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Chiang made the remarks while addressing the opening of a photo
exhibition at the KMT headquarters featuring the CKS Memorial
Hall. The monument, a major tourist attraction, was erected some
30 years ago by the then-KMT administration in commemoration of
the late president.
</P>
<P>
Saying that the KMT will seek to preserve the existing look of
the whole complex, which he claimed has become a location full of
beautiful memories for many Taipei citizens, Chiang accused the
ruling Democratic  Progressive  Party (DPP)  of trying to fan
confrontation in society by striving to purge Taiwan of Chiang's
influence and links to China.
</P>
<P>
Amid what the KMT claims is the DPP's "resorting to ideological
struggle to divide Taiwan society, " the party organized the
photo exhibition that will run through April 3 to help the people
refresh their colorful encounters with the CKS Memorial Hall in
their memories, Chiang said.
</P>
<P>
To express the KMT's dissatisfaction with the DPP's series of
"provocative" moves, the party will organize a march March 31 in
Taipei to "protect the country" whose official name is Republic
of China, Chiang said.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, DPP lawmakers suggested earlier the
same day during a legislative committee meeting that the cement
walls surrounding the CKS Memorial Hall be pulled down and trees
planted instead around the compound.
</P>
<P>
Officials  from the Ministry of Education  and the Public
Construction Commission (PCC) among others also attended the
meeting called to discuss a planned re-organization of the CKC
Memorial Hall in a concerted move by the central government with
the DPP to have the monument's walls demolished.
</P>
<P>
In response to the plantation  proposal,  PCC Chairman Wu Cheng-
tzeh told reporters after the meeting that a professional task
force will be set up in two months to evaluate the matter and a
detailed assessment will come out in six months regarding the
next move as what to do with the wall.
</P>
<P>
According to Wu, his commission will fully respect the decision
to be made by the ad hoc group, and the key point to reorganize
the compound's space is to make it more accessible and available
for public activities.
</P>
<P>
The general public, including both local and foreign tourists,
are welcome to offer their viewpoints on the issue to the PCC,
which will install boxes to collect public opinion in the months
ahead before a final decision has been made, Wu explained.
