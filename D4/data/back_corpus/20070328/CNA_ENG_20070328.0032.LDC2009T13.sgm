Taipei,  March 28 (CNA) 03/28/07  20:21:56 (By Flor Wang)

The Executive Yuan approved a five-year National Information and
Communication Initiative (NICI) package Wednesday during its
weekly meeting with the aim of further stepping up Taiwan's
communication  infrastructure  and fortifying  its leading
position in the field.
</P>
<P>
In the coming five years, the government will earmark NT$55.6
billion to implement the package that will build Taiwan into an
"ubiquitous network society, " Premier Su Tseng-chang said,
urging relevant agencies, such as the Cabinet-level Research,
Development, and Evaluation Commission, to pool their talent and
resources to serve that end as major world rating organizations
are to start their annual surveys soon.
</P>
<P>
As of the end of last year, about 60 percent of Taiwan's
population, or some 145.2 million people from 5.3 million
households, have logged on to the Internet, making Taiwan one of
the world's front runners in the Internet usage, Su said.
</P>
<P>
However, Su pointed out that Taiwan's indexes in some areas have
registered drops in international ratings, and said government
authorities must investigate the reasons for the falls and
strengthen regulations on Web sites and online services.
</P>
<P>
Doing so will help narrow  the digital  gap between  the
underprivileged or people living in rural areas and urban
dwellers and upgrade their living standards so as to improve
overall national competitiveness, he said.
</P>
<P>
Since Taiwan began promoting the NICI package in 2002, the
country's performance in telecommunications development has won
international acclaim from organizations such as the
International Telecommunication Union, the World Economic Forum
and the United States-based Brown University, according to
officials at the Science and Technology Advisory Group of the
Executive Yuan.
</P>
<P>
In the coming 2007-2011 period, some NT$11.3 billion of the
NT$55.6 billion in funds will be appropriated to life-improving
applications for everyday life, ranging from food, housing to
entertainment, the officials said, adding that NT$26.5 billion
will be used to expand the wireless network infrastructure, while
NT$8.8 billion will go to the promotion of an e-government,
digital opportunity and innovative hi-tech service.
</P>
<P>
The annual production value of promising start-up businesses in
the "ubiquitous network society" is estimated at around NT$1
trillion (US$30.3 billion), according to an NICI report.
