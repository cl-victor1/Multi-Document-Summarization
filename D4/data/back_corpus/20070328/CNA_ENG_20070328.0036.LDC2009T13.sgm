The ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) adopted Wednesday a
polling format aimed at excluding 30 percent of voters at the
opposite end of the political spectrum from public opinion
surveys that will help determine the outcome of the party's
presidential primary process.
</P>
<P>
DPP Chairman Yu Shyi-kun was one of the only two attendees of the
party's Central Executive Committee meeting to vote against the
format put forward by Presidential Office Secretary-General Chiou
I-jen. Advocating exclusion of more voters not in thepan-green
camp, Yu told the press after the meeting that "justice is in the
hearts of the people."
</P>
<P>
The meeting decided that the resolution shall be confirmed by the
Central Standing Committee next week to become effective.
</P>
<P>
According to DPP sources, the questionnaire will first ask those
surveyed about their party inclinations. The opinions of those
answering that they favor the DPP, the Taiwan Solidarity Union or
the pan-green  camp will be included,  while opinions  from those
identifying with the Kuomintang, the People First Party, the New
Party or the pan-blue camp will not.
</P>
<P>
Those who remain uncommitted on the first question will be asked
whether, in general, they admire the pan-green or the pan-blue
camp, with those favoring the blue again being excluded.
</P>
<P>
In the DPP's presidential primary, telephone polling of the
general population contributes 70 percent to the final outcome,
while voting by party members accounts for the other 30 percent.
