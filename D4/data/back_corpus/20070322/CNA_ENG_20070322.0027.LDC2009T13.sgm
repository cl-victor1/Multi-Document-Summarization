PFP LAWMAKER INSISTS ON RUNNING IN KEELUNG MAYORAL BY-ELECTION
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  March 22 (CNA) 03/22/07  18:55:32 (By Flor Wang)

<P>
People First Party (PFP) Legislator Liu Wen-hsing insisted
Thursday on running in the April 12 by-election for Keelung mayor
and voiced suspicion that the Kuomintang (KMT) used contentious
poll results as an excuse to nominate its own candidate to
represent the opposition "pan-blue alliance" in the race.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a news conference held by PFP legislative caucus whip
Fu Kun-chi at the Legislative Yuan, Liu said that he strongly
suspects that the polls conducted by the KMT and used as a
foundation to field Keelung City Council Speaker Chang Tung-jung,
a KMT member, to represent the "pan-blue alliance"  in the by-
election  are questionable.
</P>
<P>
Citing the results of a poll conducted by the TVBS cable TV
station, Liu said that his 34.4 percent approval rating well
exceeds Chang's 26.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
Liu asked the KMT not to use suspicious poll results to unfairly
squeeze him out and urged "a few KMT elements" not to shake KMT-
PFP unity for private gain.
</P>
<P>
The main opposition KMT and the PFP comprise the "pan-blue
alliance " and the two parties, through a KMT-PFP mechanism,
reached agreement last week to nominate a single candidate,
pending the result of public opinion polls, in the Keelung
mayoral by-election to avoid an alliance split.
</P>
<P>
But the KMT announced a day earlier the nomination of Chang as
the sole "pan- blue" candidate to contest the race following its
weekly Central Standing Committee earlier in the day, saying that
Chang enjoys a comfortable lead over Liu according to several
polls that it carried out.
</P>
<P>
Fu accused the KMT of using fake opinion polls to jockey position
for Chang, totally discarding a KMT-PFP platform upon which the
two parties agreed to conduct their joint campaign in elections.
The PFP fully backs Liu to contest the by-election for Keelung
mayor and has decided not to use polls to jointly field a "pan-
blue" nominee in future elections, he said.

Former Keelung Mayor Hsu Tsai-li died in February of heart
failure resulting from diabetes.
