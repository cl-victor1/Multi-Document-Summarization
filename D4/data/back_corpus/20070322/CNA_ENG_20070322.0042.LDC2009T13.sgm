China is an important overseas market, but not the only market
for Taiwan, Financial Supervisory Commission (FSC) Chairman Hu
Sheng-cheng said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Hu made the remarks at a forum organized by Merrill Lynch Taiwan
on the country's high-tech industry development.
</P>
<P>
Hu noted that in recent years the government has been encouraging
local enterprises to diversify their overseas investments to
reduce risk, a policy he described as having produced fruitful
results.
</P>
<P>
At present, Taiwan is the largest foreign investor in Vietnam,
the third-largest foreign investor in Thailand and Malaysia, as
well as the six-largest foreign investor in Indonesia and the
Philippines, Hu added.
</P>
<P>
In addition, he said, the government will continue to promote
mergers and consolidations among local banks, while adding that
it is also necessary to establish a cross-Taiwan Strait financial
supervisory cooperation mechanism.
