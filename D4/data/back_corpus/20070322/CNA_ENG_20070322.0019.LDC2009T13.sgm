Taipei,  March 22 (CNA) 03/22/07  16:45:32 (By Flor Wang)

<P>
A national campaign club in support of former Kuomintang (KMT)
Chairman Ma Ying- jeou's presidential bid was set up Thursday in
Taipei.
</P>
<P>
Ma and the club members -- 46 KMT-affiliated city and county
councilors as well as township and village chiefs aged below 40
from across the country -- attended a news conference marking the
establishment of the group at the Taipei City Council.
</P>
<P>
The members  vowed to act as front-runners  in soliciting
nationwide public backing for Ma's presidential campaign and
promised to help open sub-groups in their neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
Ma presented a flag to each of the 46 KMT members and they
chanted slogans to galvanize their morale and vowed to create at
least one sub-group in each of Taiwan's 309 villages and
townships.
</P>
<P>
Club members pledged to do their best to solicit KMT members'
endorsements in a display to fully back Ma's bid in the party's
presidential primary, slated from late April to early May.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the occasion, Ma said the main purpose of his desire
to run for president in 2008 is simple -- to end political
fighting, ease restrictions on cross-Taiwan Strait economic
activities, wipe out corruption, improve cross- strait relations,
rejuvenate Taiwan's economy and step up the rule of law -- to
allow the Taiwan people lead a good and secure life.
</P>
<P>
Ma encouraged the presidential campaign club members to help
promote his election goals and promised to help the Taiwan people
gain back their confidence in the government and the country.
