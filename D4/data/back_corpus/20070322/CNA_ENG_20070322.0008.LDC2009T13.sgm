TAIWAN SET TO ISSUE MEDICAL VISAS: CEPD
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  March  22 (CNA) 03/22/07  13:22:47 (By Sofia Wu)

Taiwan will issue medical visas to facilitate its drive to
develop medical tourism, an official from the Cabinet-level
Council for Economic Planning and Development (CEPD) said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
With the support of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) , the
official said, medical visa recipients will not be subject to the
maximum-six-month-stay restriction.
</P>
<P>
According to a CEPD-drafted medical tourism development plan, the
government will focus on areas in which Taiwan excels, such as
liver disease treatment, dental care and craneofacial surgery,
for market promotion in the initial stage.
</P>
<P>
"At a recent cross-department meeting, MOFA officials agreed to
extend visas for prospective  foreign  medical tourists  on a
case-by-case basis, " the official said, adding that the MOFA is
expected to come up with a detailed plan for this purpose in the
near future to allow for an early start of the new tourism
promotion campaign.
</P>
<P>
Noting that Taiwan enjoys an edge in several areas, including
treatment of various liver diseases, dental care, craneofacial
surgery, herbal medicine and health checkups, the official said
that updating the visa issuance system is critical to the
promotion of medical tourism as many patients may need to stay in
the country for long periods of time.
</P>
<P>
Another system necessary to be established is an online medical
bills pre-paid system, the official said, adding that the system
will function like a deposit guarantee system to prevent patients
from absconding in the middle of treatment without paying their
bills and to head off financial  disputes between patients and
hospital management.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the official said, the CEPD has contacted Taiwan
branches of major multinational insurance companies to seek their
assistance  for foreign tourists intending  to receive medical
treatment in Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
"Most foreign insurers have responded positively to our medical
tourism development initiative which is expected to upgrade
Taiwan's image of offering advanced medical care and to boost the
local medical service sector," the official said.
</P>
<P>
While Taiwan has edges in health and medical care technology and
prices,  the official  conceded its disadvantages  in language
proficiency and marketing talent, suggesting that the Department
of Health help nurture professionals in various fields and
strengthen Internet marketing and deregulation.
</P>
<P>
Several Asian countries, including Thailand, Singapore and India,
have a long history of medical tourism development. In 2005,
Singapore hosted 400,000 foreign patients, and the number is
expected to reach 500,000 this year, generating an estimated
US$1.5 billion in revenue.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to its colonial past, India has been a favorite medical
tourism destination for Britons. The South Asian nation expects
to rake in US$2 billion in medical tourism revenue in 2012.
