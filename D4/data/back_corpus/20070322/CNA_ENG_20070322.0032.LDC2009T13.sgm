PENGHU GROUP SAILS TO XIAMEN VIA KINMEN ON `MINI LINKS'

Taipei,  March 22 (CNA) 03/22/07  20:09:54 (By Flor Wang)

A 150-member group from outlying Penghu County headed Thursday
for Xiamen in China's Fujian Province via Kinmen Island, which
maintains direct shipping services with the opposite side of the
Taiwan Strait -- commonly known as the "mini three links."
</P>
<P>
The group, led by Legislator Lin Pin-kung and his wife Chang Jui-
mei and composed of members from a wide range of business
sectors, applied to sail to Xiamen via the "mini links" to
conduct a four-day religious pilgrimage. The Penghu group flew
into Kinmen the previous afternoon on a Far East Air Transport
charter flight.
</P>
<P>
According to Chang, the pilgrimage carries symbolic importance as
a prelude to the establishment of direct ferry services
anticipated between Penghu and Xiamen.
</P>
<P>
Before the establishment of the existing shipping links that
connect Taiwan's Kinmen and Matsu islands and the Fujian ports of
Xiamen and Mawei, Penghu people had to first fly to Kaohsiung and
than transfer through Hong Kong or Macau en route to China, Chang
said.
</P>
<P>
Now with the direct ferry service on the "mini links" routes for
China-bound travelers, a voyage via Kinmen for Penghu travelers
can help them greatly shorten their travel time, she said.
</P>
<P>
Chang expressed hope that direct "mini links" also can be put in
place between Penghu and China as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
According to a local tour agent, direct shipping links and China-
bound charter flights from Penghu via Kinmen or Matsu are being
projected by the central government.
