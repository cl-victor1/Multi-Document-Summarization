Thanks to a growth in short-term service jobs during the Lunar
New Year holiday season, February's jobless rate hit a six-year
low of 3.78 percent, the government reported Thursday.

According to officials at the Cabinet-level Directorate General
of Budget, Accounting and Statistics (DGBAS) ,  the February
unemployment rate translates into some 400,200 unemployed
workers, down by 1,000 from January's level -- or 0.01 percentage
points. The average jobless rate for the first two months of this
year also dropped to a six-year low at 3.79 percent.

In February, a total of 10.24 million workers were employed, an
increase of 4,000 compared to the January figure, DGBAS officials
said,  adding that the number of workers in the service and
agricultural sectors grew by 19,000 and 2,000, respectively,
month to month. The number of workers in the industrial sector
decreased by 18,000 from January.
