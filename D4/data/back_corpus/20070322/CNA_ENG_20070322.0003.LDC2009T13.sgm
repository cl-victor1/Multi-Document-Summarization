<P>
Former Premier Frank Hsieh said Wednesday that the case of the
Losheng Sanatorium should be reconsidered, calling the process by
which it was decided to dismantle the sanitarium to make room for
a metro maintenance depot "hasty".
</P>
<P>
Responding to a petition by several groups lobbying presidential
aspirants, Hsieh became the second former premier to support a
plan to preserve 90 percent of the now four-hectare compound,
after DPP Chairman Yu Shyi-kun did the same earlier the day.
</P>
<P>
Hsieh said his remarkswere neither targeted at nor meant to
embarrass Premier Su Tseng-chang.
</P>
<P>
He said the authority of the government should be exercised to
defend the nation's basic values and identity, and the sanatorium
represents an important part of Taiwan's history.
</P>
<P>
Asked by the press for comment, Executive Yuan Spokesman Cheng
Wen-tsang said the government will take into account different
opinions.
</P>
<P>
He added that the National Youth Commission will arrange an
occasion for preservation activists to meet with Su to further
discuss the issue.
