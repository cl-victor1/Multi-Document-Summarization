<P>
The state-owned Taiwan Power Company (Taipower) has no immediate
plans to raise the price of electricity following its previous
price adjustment last July 1, Taipower Chairman Chen Kuei-ming
said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Chen told lawmakers at the Legislative Yuan that Taipower needs
more time to observe fluctuating fuel prices on the international
market to determine whether they represent a new standard or
short-term change.
</P>
<P>
Chen delivered a written report to the legislative committee on
economics and energy resources to unveil Taipower's 2007 budget
plan which has assessed the company's total revenue to be
approximately NT$421.337 billion (US$12.708 billion) while total
expenses are about NT$454.856 billion. As a result, the company
is expected to suffer a net deficit of NT$33.519 billion,
according to the report.
</P>
<P>
Vice Minister of Economic Affairs Hsieh Fa-ta, who also attended
the committee meeting held to review Taipower's budget, explained
the budget was formed before the government activated the
floating fuel pricing mechanism Jan. 1.
</P>
<P>
Now the assessed deficit may expand to NT$42.5 billion because of
increasing fuel costs, Hsieh.
</P>
<P>
With the expected deficit, legislators expressed concerns over a
possible hike of electrical prices.
