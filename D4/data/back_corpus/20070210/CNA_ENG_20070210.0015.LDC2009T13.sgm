TAIWAN TO CONTINUE NAME-CHANGE DRIVE: SENIOR OFFICIALS
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taipei,   Feb.  10  (CNA) 02/10/07  16:16:26 (By Lilian Wu)
</P>
<P>
Senior officials said Saturday the government  will  continue  to
push  forward with  its "name rectification" campaign, calling it
an "internal matter."
</P>
<P>
They were responding to remarks by a U.S. State Department
official Friday that the United States does not support steps
that would appear to change Taiwan's status unilaterally,
including changes  in terminology  for entities administered  by
Taiwan authorities.
</P>
<P>
Several Taiwan state-owned enterprises, including the Chinese
Petroleum Corp., the China Shipbuilding Corp., the China Post
Co., have decided in their respective board meetings to remove
any reference to "China" and include "Taiwan" in their titles.
</P>
<P>
President Chen Shui-bian also said Thursday that the name-change
campaign will not be restricted to state-owned enterprises and
will include Taiwan's overseas embassies and representative
offices in the future.
</P>
<P>
Tan Sun Chen, secretary-general of the National Security Council,
said that name rectification campaign is a national policy, and
the campaign will continue.
</P>
<P>
"The matter will not affect Taiwan-U.S. relations," he added.
</P>
<P>
Yu Shyi-kun, chairman of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party,
echoed Tan Sun Chen's views.
</P>
<P>
"This is an internal matter, and foreign countries should not
interfere," Yu said.
</P>
<P>
Cho Jung-tai,  deputy secretary-general of the Presidential
Office, said that "this is the government's policy, and we have a
right to carry on the matter."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) said Saturday
that the current name-change drive is not intended to change the
status quo in the Taiwan Strait and that it is aimed at avoiding
confusion arising from the fact that many Taiwan organizations
have names that are similar to their counterparts in China.
</P>
<P>
"The government's name-change drive has nothing to do with the
unification versus independence debate or with changing the
official name of the country," MOFA spokesman Wang Chien-yeh
stressed.
</P>
<P>
Wang also said the ministry's efforts to have overseas embassies
have the word "Taiwan" added to their names in parenthesis have
been proceeding smoothly.
</P>
<P>
However, in countries with which Taiwan does not maintain
diplomatic relations, changing the name of representative offices
will require the consent of the host countries, Wang said, adding
that the matter will have to be dealt with on a case-by-case
basis.
</P>
<P>
Currently, Taiwan representative offices in Jordan, Bahrain,
Papua New Guinea, Nigeria and Bolivia have the word "Taiwan"
included in parenthesis in their names, he added.
