Taipei, Feb. 9 (CNA) 02/10/07  12:09:01 (by Lilian Wu)

Politicians reacted along party lines Friday upon learning that
former Kaohsiung acting mayor Chen Chi-mai has been appointed
deputy secretary-general of the Presidential Office, with the
ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) responding positively
and the main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) criticizing the
appointment.
</P>
<P>
President Chen Shui-bian announced several major appointments,
including that of Chen Chi-mai, earlier Friday.
</P>
<P>
This was the president's second wave of key post appointments
this week. He announced a swapping of posts between Chiou I-jen,
secretary-general of the National Security Council and Tan Sun
Chen, secretary general of the Presidential Office, earlier this
week.
</P>
<P>
The legislative caucus of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) said Chen Chi-mai's new post is "very appropriate."
</P>
<P>
Ker Chien-ming, DPP legislator and caucus whip, said that Chen
Chi-mai served three terms as a legislator and had administrative
experience given the fact that he once served as a minister
without portfolio and spokesman of the Executive Yuan.
</P>
<P>
For his part, Chen Chi-mai vowed to serve with humility, saying
that he would do his utmost to assist President Chen in cross-
Strait and diplomatic affairs.
</P>
<P>
Chen Chi-mai stepped down as the Kaohsiung acting mayor to take
responsibility for a riot in August 2005 by Thai laborers working
on Kaohsiung's mass rapid transit system to protest their harsh
treatment and inhumane management. Subsequent investigations into
the riot uncovered a series of irregularities in the MRT project
involving Chen Che-nan, former deputy secretary-general to the
president and Chen Chi-mai's father.
</P>
<P>
Chen Chi-mai reportedly has been biding his time since then, and
was said to be keen on running in the year-end legislative
elections, which will adopt a new "single-member constituency,
two votes" electoral system, and halve the 225-member legislature
to 113 seats.
</P>
<P>
As DPP Legislator Kuan Bi-ling also made known her intention to
run in the same constituency as Chen Chi-mai's, his new
appointment has certainly helped relieve internal pressures for
the DPP.
</P>
<P>
But the KMT and its ally the People First Party (PFP) criticized
the intentions of the president in appointing Chen Chi-mai, a
protege of the president and a rising star until the Thai riot
brought an abrupt stop to his otherwise smooth political career.
</P>
<P>
Hsu Shao-ping, KMT legislator and caucus whip, said that Chen
Che-nan was indicted for influence peddling and as a result the
public has a poor impression of the Chens.
</P>
<P>
"The president has total disregard for public sentiment, and is
only thinking of his own protege," she lamented.
</P>
<P>
Her colleague, legislator Alex Fai, said that the president's
latest wave of personnel appointments could signal that the
president is afraid of becoming a "lamb duck" before his second
term expires in May 2008, so to demonstrate that he is still in
command he has invited his protege to help him with the
preparations for two major elections ahead -- the year-end
legislative elections and the March 2008 presidential election.
</P>
<P>
PFP Legislator Lee Hung-chun said that the truth of the Kaohsiung
MRT probe has yet to come to light, and the president is
appointing Chen Chi-mai to his new post in return for assisting
Chen Chu in last December's Kaohsiung mayoral election.
</P>
<P>
Chen Chi-mai served as the campaign manager for Chen Chu in the
fiercely contested election, helping Chen Chu to win by a razor-
thin margin against her KMT rival Huang Chun-ying when the DPP
was mired in its lowest approval rating due to a spate of
scandals involving President Chen's family members and close
aides.
