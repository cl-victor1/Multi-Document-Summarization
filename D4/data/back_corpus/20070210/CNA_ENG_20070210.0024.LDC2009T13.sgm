Taipei,  Feb. 10 (CNA) 02/10/07  20:00:42 (By Lilian Wu)

<P>
The matter of who will be the Kuomintang's (KMT's) presidential
candidate will become clearer in April, Ma Ying-jeou, chairman of
the main opposition party, said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Ma, widely seen as the most likely bet to be the KMT's candidate
in the 2008 presidential election, made the remarks while meeting
supporters in Taipei County as part of his islandwide tour to
listen to the voice of the grass roots.
</P>
<P>
Ma noted that the party will coordinate a ticket for the March
2008 presidential election in April.
</P>
<P>
The KMT will "recover the happiness, stability and harmony that
have long been missing during the rule of the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party," Ma said.
</P>
<P>
Ma has recently been facing questions regarding reports of his
alleged misuse of the "executive's special allowance" during his
tenure as the Taipei mayor which ended last December. He has
maintained his innocence and said that it was gratifying that a
lot of people expressed faith in his integrity during his
meetings with them.
</P>
<P>
Ma has also repeatedly said that he would resign from the party
chairmanship in accordance with the KMT charter if he were to be
indicted.
