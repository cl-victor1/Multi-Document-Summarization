KMT CHIEF CRITICIZES NAME-CHANGE CAMPAIGN AS 'CHILDISH'

Taipei,  Feb.  10 (CNA) 02/10/07  16:00:18 (By Elizabeth Hsu)

<P>
The chairman of the main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) criticized
Saturday a campaign initiated by the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) to change the names of state-run
enterprises, calling the move "childish."
</P>
<P>
Ma Ying-jeou made the criticism in a press release following a
statement by the U.S. government earlier the same day that it
"does not support changes in terminology for entities
administered by Taiwan authorities."
</P>
<P>
Ma rebuked the DPP for attempting to "gloss over its incompetence
in running a country and the fact that the country's economy has
been in a state of stagnancy" by pursuing the name change
campaign, which he called "political manipulation."
</P>
<P>
"No matter what changes the DPP makes, it cannot change the fact
that the Republic of China exists, " Ma said, describing the move
to "eliminate  the ROC's existence in state-run  enterprises"  as
"childish."
</P>
<P>
Ma said the "childishness" and "political manipulation" have
harmed the people of the country. He claimed that Chunghwa Post
Co.'s decision to change its name will not only make the
employees suffer by having to engage in the time- consuming task
of changing the company designation on countless documents, it
will also cause problems for people around the country who will
have to spend a lot of time having documents issued by the postal
company, which also provides insurance and banking services,
changed.
</P>
<P>
"The losses caused by the name-change campaign will be too large
to imagine," Ma claimed, advising President Chen Shui-bian, who
gave instructions to initiate the campaign, to "refrain from
playing the game of terminology and to stop playing with the
issue of Taiwan independence at the expense of the Taiwan
people's interests and Taiwan's relations with the United States.
</P>
<P>
In their respective board meetings held Friday, the Chinese
Petroleum Corp. (CPC) decided to change its name to "CPC Corp.,
Taiwan, " China Shipbuilding Corp. (CSBC) decided to change its
name to CSBC Corp., Taiwan, " and Chunghwa Post Co. decided to
change its name to "Taiwan Post Co."
</P>
<P>
Chunghwa Post's decision triggered protests by the company's
worker's union.
