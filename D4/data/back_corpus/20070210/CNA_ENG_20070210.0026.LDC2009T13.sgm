Richard Gombrich, a professor of Buddhist studies at Oxford
University, praised the contributions of Buddhist nuns in Taiwan
to the promotion of Buddhist doctrines, saying the influence of
Buddhism has significantly increased on the island while
followers of the religion have suffered from repression in many
other countries.
</P>
<P>
Gombrich made the remarks in an interview with the CNA Saturday,
after presiding over an international conference on Buddhism held
in Bodh Gaya in Bihar Province, northeast India Feb. 4-6 to mark
the 2,550th anniversary of the passing of Buddha.

During the three-day conference, Master Chue Men of the Fo Guang
Shan Monastery in Kaohsiung County, southern Taiwan gave a
briefing on Buddhist nun's contributions in the 21st century. In
his report, Chue Men said 75 percent of the around 30,000 Dharma
masters in Taiwan are female, nuns, the highest ratio of any
country in the world.
</P>
<P>
There are eight universities and colleges, three hospitals and 28
libraries around Taiwan founded by Buddhist organizations, and
the country is home to over 5.4 million Buddhists.
</P>
<P>
Chue Men indicated that most nuns in Taiwan are highly educated,
with many of them holding  degrees from domestic  or foreign
universities. He noted that in Taiwan, nuns enjoy a high social
status, a fact which has drawn the attention of Tibetan spiritual
leader the Dalai Lama who announced on a visit to Taiwan in 1997
his plan to study the system of training female Dharma masters in
Taiwan and expressed the intention of establishing a similar
system for Tibetan Buddhism.

<P>
Chue Men stated that in Taiwan, nuns are widely respected because
of their diligence in studying the doctrines of Buddhism as well
as their active participation in charity operations. Citing the
Fo Guang Shan organization, he pointed out that nuns serve as
administrators of 95 percent of the Fo Guang Shan branches in
Taiwan and overseas.
</P>
<P>
The Bodh Gaya conference, titled "The 21st Century and Buddhism,
"drew around 1,000 leaders and representatives of Buddhism from
countries around the world, including the United States, Britain,
Germany, Estonia, Brazil, Hungary, Malaysia, Taiwan, Japan, Sri
Lanka and Thailand.
