VICE PRESIDENT SPEAKS ON QUALIFICATIONS TO BE NATIONAL LEADER
</HEADLINE>

Kaohsiung, March 24 (CNA) 03/24/07  21:23:31 (By Lilian Wu)

<P>
Vice President Annette Lu said Saturday that a national leader
should have correct historial perspective and a broad vision.
</P>
<P>
Lu also said that to let someone who thinks that Taiwan is part
of China or who has a very limited view lead the country is
dangerous.
</P>
<P>
Lu also expressed the hope that before she steps down as a vice
president in May 2008, she will be given "a four-year job" for
which she promises to seize opportunities to do more to the
country.
</P>
<P>
Lu is the only one of the four aspirants bidding to represent the
ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) in the 2008
presidential election who did not take part in a televised debate
for the DPP presidential hopefuls Saturday afternoon in Taipei,
northern Taiwan. Instead, she spent the whole day in the southern
port city of Kaohsiung.
</P>
<P>
Lu noted that there are "thousands of civic groups in Taiwan" and
that she shouldn't favor the Taiwan Society, a pro-independence
group which sponsored the debate in which the three other
hopefuls, Premier Su Tseng-chang and two of his predecessors, Yu
Shyi-kun and Frank Hsieh, took part. In addition, she said the
group had criticized her before without giving any apology.
</P>
<P>
Lu said that her three rivals are distinctive in their own ways
but that she thinks she herself has also made a mark in the areas
of human rights and democracy with an international vision.
</P>
<P>
She further said she considers herself a seasoned democrat and
long-term women's rights advocate who has provided assistance in
defense technology and industrial issues to the president.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, she said that she has already won two elections on a
ticket with President Chen Shui-bian.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at Kaohsiung Municipal Girls' Senior High School in the
morning, Lu said that the Taiwan-China relationship is one of
distant relatives and close neighbors and that the two should not
engage in war, and instead should promote normalization of ties.
</P>
<P>
She later addressed a meeting of the Taiwan Surgical Association
in the port city.
</P>
<P>
Lu was then interviewed by a radio station in Kaohsiung in the
afternoon, during which she touted her performance during her
stint as Taoyuan magistrate between 1997 and 2000, saying that
she helped with the development of three science parks, with
total production amounting to NT$280 billion (US$8.48 billion) in
the county.
</P>
<P>
Lu said she is especially gratified by her performance on the
diplomatic front during the past seven years as the vice
president, noting that she represented the president on a visit
to Hungary to attend the 51th Congress of the Liberal
International in 2002, becoming the first vice president from
Taiwan to take part in such a meeting.
</P>
<P>
Lu also helped found the Democratic Pacific Union (DPU) , an
international  non- governmental  organization aimed at promoting
democracy, strengthening maritime culture and marine technology,
and promoting soft powers, which refers to human rights,
democracy, peace, love and technological progress. The DPU will
celebrate its second anniversary this August.
