A lane on the northbound section of the Formosa Freeway in
Linnei, Changhua County may be temporarily closed between March
26 and April 6 to clear the way for large numbers of migrating
euploea butterflies, the National Freeway Bureau (NFB) said
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The NFB added that the outer northbound lane of the Linei section
may also be closed if the average number of euploea butterflies
passing over it exceeds 2,000 per minute.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the NFB said it also plans to erect protective
screens -- 200 meters in length and 2.5 meters in height each --
between the interchanges of Jhushan and Douliou,  as well as
ultraviolet lights along the Linnei section to guide the
butterflies to bypass a heavy-traffic freeway bridge.
</P>
<P>
NFB officials  noted  that these steps represent  Taiwan's first-
ever protective measures for butterfly implemented on the
freeway, at the suggestion of environmental researchers at I-shou
University in Kaohsiung County.
</P>
<P>
Even in other countries, such large-scale protective measures for
migrant butterflies are very unusual, local reports said.
</P>
<P>
According to previous surveys, at least one million euploea
butterflies migrate every year from northern Taiwan to the south
of the island to winter near Kaoshiung or Taitung before heading
back north in the spring.
</P>
<P>
The butterflies usually pass over the Linnei freeway section
between mid-March and mid-April, with a peak in numbers seen
between 9 a.m. to 12 p.m. everyday from March 26 through April 6.
In a single observation period in April 3, 2005, researchers
recorded some 11,500 euploea butterflies per minute flying over
the freeway section, equivalent to over one million in a single
day.
</P>
<P>
Lin Tie-shyong,  associate professor at I-shou University's
Department of Civil and Ecological Engineering, said his
department sent a report on euploea butterfly to the NFB in early
March and offered suggestions on tentative protective measures in
the report.
</P>
<P>
"To our surprise, the NFB did follow our suggestions," he added.
