The Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) said Saturday that it will
revise regulations soon to allow residents of outlying Penghu to
travel to China via Kinmen and Matsu and Chinese citizens to
travel to Penghu for sightseeing trips via the same "mini three
links" route at the end of this month.
</P>
<P>
Under the existing regulations, only Kinmen and Matsu maintain
direct shipping services with the opposite site of the Taiwan
Strait -- commonly known as the "mini three links."
</P>
<P>
MAC officials said that a total of 660,000 people traveled to and
from China via Kinmen and Matsu last year. In view of the heavy
passenger traffic flow between Kinmen and Xiamen,  Kinmen and
Quanzhou, and Matsu and Mawei, the government will continue to
strengthen the sea disaster rescue resources of the two outlying
islands and coordinate drills on the disaster notification
mechanism.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the government will also strengthen the effective
management of the three links, step up its crackdown on smuggling
operations, as well as ensure that inspection and quarantine work
is carried out, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
The government is currently shortening the screening time for
Chinese citizens applying to travel to Kinmen and Matsu for
pleasure trips. The Immigration Agency is also adjusting its
working staff and information facilities and has commissioned its
offices in Kinmen and Matsu to issue tourist visas to Chinese
citizens wanting to tour the two outlying islands.
