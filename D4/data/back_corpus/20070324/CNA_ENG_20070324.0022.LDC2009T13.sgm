3 DPP PRESIDENTIAL HOPEFULS CLARIFY STANCES ON MAJOR ISSUES
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  March 24 (CNA) 03/24/07  20:27:50 (By Lilian Wu)

Three aspirants bidding to represent the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) in the 2008 presidential election gave
differing responses Saturday when asked whether they would
reiterate President Chen Shui-bian's "five noes" pledges under
pressure from China if elected.
</P>
<P>
The three DPP hopefuls, including Premier Su Tseng-chang and two
of his predecessors, Yu Shyi-kun and Frank Hsieh, pronounced
their respective stances on the issue when asked by professor Lo
Chih-cheng of Soochow University in a televised debate whether
they would reiterate President Chen's famous pledges made in his
inaugural speech in 2000 and again in 2004 after he was re-
elected.
</P>
<P>
Chen promised that if China has no intention to use force against
Taiwan, Taiwan will not declare independence, not change its
official name, not include the "special state-to-state" cross-
strait relations concept into the Constitution, not conduct a
referendum on the issue of independence versus unification, and
not abolish the National Unification Council (NUC) and its
guidelines. The president announced in early 2006, however, that
the NUC would cease to function.
</P>
<P>
Yu, currently DPP chairman, said that if elected, he will "scrap
the 'five noes' pledges no matter how great the pressure might
be."
</P>
<P>
He said that the Taiwan people's rights cannot be denied. Whether
it is the issue of changing the nation's official name or the
issue of holding a referendum, these are internal matters.
</P>
<P>
"The people's decision will be the decision of democracy and will
receive the support of many democratic countries, " Yu said,
adding that regardless of how great the pressure from the United
States and Japan might be, he will stick to his guns.
</P>
<P>
Hsieh said that as far as he understands, the United States
attaches great importance to integrity, and one has to keep one's
words.
</P>
<P>
For his part, Hsieh said that he won't promise the United States
anything, because the "results of democracy are beyond anybody's
control."
</P>
<P>
On constitutional re-engineering work advocated by the DPP, Hsieh
said that the current Constitution, which was formulated in
Nanjing in 1947, is based on the concept of "one China," which he
said refers to the Republic of China, and not the People's
Republic of China as claimed by Beijing.
</P>
<P>
He said that as long as the collective Taiwan consciousness
reaches a certain level, then one has no need to worry about the
high threshold for amending the Constitution. A constitutional
amendment requires the support of three-quarters of all
legislators and half of the eligible voters in the country to be
passed.
</P>
<P>
Hsieh said that he is confident that Taiwan consciousness will
reach that level within five years and that no legislator will
dare to say that he or she is opposed to revising the
Constitution or crafting anew one.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Premier Su said that he has always thought that " we
can make it as long as our goal is correct and we keep on moving
toward that goal."
</P>
<P>
He said that Taiwan's government currently has jurisdiction over
Taiwan proper and the outlying islands of Kinmen, Matsu and
Penghu, and that the 23 million people of the country choose
their lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
As Taiwan is an independent and sovereign country, Su said that
he will insist on the right of the people of Taiwan to decide the
country's future regardless of what claims Beijing might make to
the contrary.
</P>
<P>
Noting that only 30 percent of the Taiwan people identified
themselves as Taiwanese in 2000 but that the figure has grown to
60 percent at present, Su said that as long as the DPP continues
to do a good job, the figure will rise even higher.
