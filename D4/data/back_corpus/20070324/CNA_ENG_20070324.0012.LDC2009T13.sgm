elaborated their ideals on ruling the country in an open debate
Saturday afternoon.

Premier Su Tseng-chang and two of his predecessors -- Frank Hsieh
and Yu Shyi- kun -- took part in the TV debate sponsored by the
pro-independence Taiwan Society. Vice President Annette Lu,
another presidential hopeful, was absent from the event. Lu said
before the debate that if it were sponsored by the DPP, she would
definitely take part.

Presidential Office officials said that President Chen Shui-bian

it after winding up his tour of Miaoli in the morning.

Asked if the president will begin the third round of mediation
and coordination among the four hopefuls after the TV debate, the
officials said that the president has no such plan for the time
being. President Chen's previous two mediation efforts failed to
produce any tangible results.
