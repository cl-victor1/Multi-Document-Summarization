TAIWAN TO CONSULT WITH CHINA ON GRAVEL ISSUE SOON: MOEA
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  March 24 (CNA) 03/24/07  16:25:00 (By Lilian Wu)

Taiwan can manage with its present gravel stockpile until the end
of April, the Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
MOEA officials also said that they will embark on consultations
with China on gravel supply soon. China banned the export of
gravel March 1, although it said it would have separate
consultations with Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macau on the issue.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) has designated the
Taiwan External Trade Development  Council to consult with an
association under China's Ministry of Commerce on the matter, the
officials said that they expect the consultations on China's
gravel exports and restrictions to begin soon.
</P>
<P>
The officials said that they estimate local demand for gravel
will be 67.86 million cubic meters this year, while the supply
will be 69.93 million cubic meters. As of March 18, the actual
supply was 12.57 million cubic meters -- about the same as the
amount forecast in the ministry's supply schedule.
</P>
<P>
As Taiwan's gravel stockpile will only last until the end of
April, if China has not resumed exports to Taiwan by then, the
MOEA will activate its contingency mechanism by taking several
steps, including increasing gravel mining on land as well as
importing 3 million cubic meters of gravel from the Philippines.
