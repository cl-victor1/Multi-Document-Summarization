Taiwan's foreign exchange reserves amounted to a record high of
US$267.99 billion as of the end of February, up US$2.02 billion
from the month-earlier level, according to statistics released
Monday by Taiwan's Central Bank of China (CBC).
</P>
<P>
CBC officials attributed the increase mainly to returns on
foreign exchange reserve investments and the appreciation of
foreign currencies owned by the nation. Taiwan remained the
country with the world's third-largest foreign exchange reserves
after China and Japan, the officials said.
