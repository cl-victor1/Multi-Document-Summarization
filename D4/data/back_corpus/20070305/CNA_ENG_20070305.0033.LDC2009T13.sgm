Taipei,  March 5 (CNA) 03/05/07  21:17:27 (By Y.C. Jou)
</P>
<P>
A court and prosecutor's office specially tasked with handling
intellectual property right (IPR) cases will be set up, according
to a law passed by the legislature Monday.
</P>
<P>
Fan Kuang-Chun, Secretary-General of Judicial Yuan, said the
highest judicial body welcomes the passage of the Organic Act of
Intellectual Property Court, but said it was unlikely that the
court could be set up in March as previously planned.
</P>
<P>
According to the act, the high-court level IPR Court will try
civil IPR cases for first and second instances, criminal IPR
cases for the second instance, and administrative cases for the
first instance.
</P>
<P>
The act stipulates that the IPR Court may set up branches
depending on case load and regional needs, and will hire review
officers proficient in IPR affairs to assist the judges.
</P>
<P>
A corresponding high-court level IPR Prosecutor's Office will
also be established and staffed with 15 prosecutors, including a
chief prosecutor.
</P>
<P>
On Jan. 9 the legislature passed a procedural law for the
handling of IPR litigations. A senior official of the Judicial
Yuan, which initiated the two laws, said at the time that the two
laws would make proceedings of IPR cases more efficient,
professional and sophisticated.
</P>
<P>
The Judicial Yuan said it plans to temporarily house the IPR
Court in the Banciao Rail Station building until its own building
near Linkou Station on the Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport
Access MRT System is completed.
