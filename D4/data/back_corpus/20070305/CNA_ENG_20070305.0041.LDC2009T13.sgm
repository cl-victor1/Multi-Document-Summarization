Taipei,  March 5 (CNA) 03/05/07  21:59:41 (By Flor Wang)

The National Stabilization Fund is closely watching the domestic
stock exchange and may intervene in the bourse if market
mechanisms lose control, Vice Minister of Finance Liu Teng-cheng
said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Liu, who also doubles as the fund's executive secretary, made the
comments following a Cabinet meeting of trade and finance
officials earlier the same day after the stock market opened low
and plummeted by about 300 points in reaction to the tumbling
international market -- triggered in turn by a plunge in the
Chinese stock market Feb. 27 due to various international and
local factors.
</P>
<P>
The Taipei Stock Exchanges opened the daily session at the day's
high of 7,565.95 points and closed at 7,344.56 points, a dip of
285.59 points over the previous day's finish on a transaction
volume of NT$131.66 billion (US$3.99 billion).
</P>
<P>
Stating that the National Stabilization Fund will consider
intervening in the market only when the bourse plummets under the
impact of non-economic elements, Liu ascribed the local stock
market's dwindling to declines on the Hong Kong, U.S., Japan,
South Korean and European markets in recent days.
</P>
<P>
Liu said that the National Stabilization Fund will keep a close
eye on the Taipei Stock Exchange but will not intervene in the
market at this time.
</P>
<P>
Liu called for investors to be calm as Taiwan's economic
fundamentals remain sound and healthy.
</P>
<P>
The National Stabilization Fund was set up to help stabilize the
stock market if it tumbles due to the impact of drastic
contingencies at home or abroad.
