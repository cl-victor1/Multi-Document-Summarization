<P>
The government should order any bank whose financial situation
has significantly deteriorated  to suspend operations and undergo
rehabilitation within a certain time limit, according to an
amendment to Article 62 of the Banking Act passed by the
Legislative Yuan Monday.
</P>
<P>
The amendment states that the government should order such banks
to suspend business, assign officials to take over its operations
and take other necessary actions,  including  requesting  that
the responsible persons be barred from leaving the country.
</P>
<P>
The original article said only that the government "may" take the
above actions should a bank become insolvent or pose a risk to
its depositors' interests.
</P>
<P>
Also, under an amendment to Article 64 of the Banking Act passed
the same day, when a bank has depleted more than one-third of its
capital, the regulatory bodies should order the bank to replenish
its funds within three months. If the bank fails to do so within
the allotted time, the regulatory bodies should take over the
bank or order its suspension, according to the amended article.
</P>
<P>
The original article stated only that the bank's directors or
supervisors should immediately report such information to the
authorities and that the regulatory bodies "may" order the bank
to replenish its capital or order its suspension.
