TSU CRITICIZES PRESIDENT'S NEW DOCTRINE AS SLOGANS
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  March 5 (CNA) 03/05/07  21:57:56 (By Elizabeth Hsu)
</P>
<P>
The opposition Taiwan Solidarity Union's (TSU's) legislative
caucus criticized President Chen Shui-bian's latest public
remarks, in which he declares that Taiwan wants independence, as
nothing but an attempt to "run the country with slogans."
</P>
<P>
TSU caucus whip, Tseng Tsan-teng, voiced the criticism at a press
conference held at the Legislative Yuan to condemn Chen's remarks
at a gathering of the Formosan Association for Public Affairs
(FAPA) in Taipei the previous night.
</P>
<P>
The FAPA is a non-profit organization headquartered in Washington
D.C. that aims to promote Taiwan's cause.
</P>
<P>
In his address, Chen declared that Taiwan wants independence, a
new constitution, further development, and a change to the
country's official designation, and stated that there is no
polarization of Taiwan's politics into right and left wings.
</P>
<P>
Tseng questioned why, as most Taiwan people have always believed
that Taiwan is a sovereign and independent country, the president
still "wants Taiwan to seek independence." "Does this mean that
Taiwan has never been independent?" he asked.
</P>
<P>
As to Chen's argument that Taiwan wants a new constitution, Tseng
criticized the ruling Democratic Progressive  Party (DPP)  as
responsible for making the writing of a new constitution
impossible.
</P>
<P>
It was the DPP that collaborated with the main opposition
Kuomintang (KMT) to significantly raise the barriers to bringing
in a new constitution, Tseng accused.
</P>
<P>
The pro-independent TSU was the DPP's closest ally in promoting
the writing of a new constitution. In recent months, however, it
has sought to cut political ties with the DPP after expressing
its disappointment with the DPP administration, which the TSU's
spiritual leader, former President Lee Teng-hui, criticized for
neglecting its responsibility to resolve problems concerning the
livelihood of the people to concentrate on its power struggle
with the KMT.
</P>
<P>
TSU Legislators Kuo Lin-yung and Lai Hsing-yuan said people have
tired of the confrontation between the pro-independence "pan
green camp" headed by the DPP and the pro-unification "pan-blue
alliance" led by the the KMT.
</P>
<P>
All political parties in the country should try to concentrate on
the people's problems, and give up their irrational, electoral
power struggles, they said.
