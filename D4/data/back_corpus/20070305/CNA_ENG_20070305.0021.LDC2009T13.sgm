KMT SHOULD FIELD CANDIDATE THAT HAS BEST WINNING CHANCE
</HEADLINE>

Taipei, March 5 (CNA) 03/05/07  18:19:41 (By Lilian Wu)

<P>
The main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) should field a candidate
that has the best chance of winning the 2008 presidential
election rather than a ticket of a president and vice president,
former KMT Chairman Ma Ying-jeou said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Ma said that he and Lien Chan, the KMT's honorary chairman,
agreed on this point after the two met for 90 minutes,
contradicting an earlier consensus reached by Lien, Ma,
Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng and KMT acting Chairman Wu
Poh- hsiung in mid-February that the KMT will field a ticket that
has the best chance of winning rather than a single candidate.
</P>
<P>
The ticket is generally believed to refer to a Wang-Ma team or a
Ma-Wang combination, with Wang running for the presidency with Ma
as his vice president, or vice-versa.
</P>
<P>
Ma and Lien also agreed that the party needs to unify for a
chance of victory.
</P>
<P>
Ma, a former mayor of Taipei, has been seen as the front-runner
in the 2008 race. His indictment over the alleged
misappropriation of public funds during his mayoral term Feb. 13
dealt a serious blow to the KMT and prompted him to immediately
resign as party chairman and announce his bid to join the
presidential race.
</P>
<P>
Since then,  Wang has also reportedly  shown interest  in
representing the KMT to run for the president, although he has
yet to announce his bid.
</P>
<P>
On whether Lien will again serve as the party's chairman in the
April 7 KMT chairman by-election, Ma said Lien has no interest in
doing so.
</P>
<P>
Some KMT Legislators, including Wang, have petitioned that Lien,
who served as party chairman from 2000-2005, retake the post,
given the fact that the party needs someone of Lien's stature to
coordinate the hopefuls within the party for the year-end
legislative elections and the presidential election.
