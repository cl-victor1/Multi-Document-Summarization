PRESIDENT'S REMARKS NOT AIMED AT CHANGING TAIWAN'S STATUS: DPP
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  March 5 (CNA) 03/05/07  14:19:27 (By Deborah Kuo)

President Chen Shui-bian's "four wants and one without" remarks,
including "Taiwan wants independence, " are not aimed at changing
Taiwan's existing status,  the whip of the legislative caucus of
the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Wang Tuo said Taiwan has long been a sovereign state -- as was
stated clearly in a 1999 DPP resolution on Taiwan's future,
adding that he believes that the president's reiteration of
Taiwan's need for independence was merely an attempt to win the
recognition of the international community on the issue.
</P>
<P>
Wang said Taiwan's being a sovereign state independent of China
is an undeniable fact, but this fact has not been widely
recognized in the international community because of Beijing's
persistent efforts to diplomatically  suppress Taiwan.  Even some
Taiwan politicians have not dared to declare the fact in front of
Chinese news media or Chinese political figures, he added.
</P>
<P>
Consequently, Wang said, he understands that Chen's reiteration
of the independence cause is aimed at winning recognition from
the rest of the world.
</P>
<P>
Wang added that the president's latest "four wants and one
without" doctrine -- namely Taiwan wants independence,  a new
constitution, further development, a change to the country's
official designation, and there is no polarization of Taiwan into
right and left wings -- is no different from what the ruling DPP
has strived to achieve or worked to safeguard over the past
years.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the "four wants and one without" remarks do not
represent an attempt to change Taiwan's existing status, Wang
urged the public not to be "too sensitive" to them.
</P>
<P>
Wang added that the president's latest remarks are of the same
spirit as the "five noes" pledge that he first made in his
inaugural address in 2000, including that as long as Beijing has
no intention of using military force against Taiwan,  he will not
declare independence, not change Taiwan's name, not add the
state-to-state theory to the Constitution,  not promote a
referendum on the independence versus unification issue, and not
abolish the National Unification Guidelines and the National
Unification Council.
