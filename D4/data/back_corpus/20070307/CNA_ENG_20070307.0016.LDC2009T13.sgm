Former Premier Frank Hsieh, who recently announced his bid to
seek the ruling Democratic Progressive Party's (DPP's) nomination
to represent the party in the 2008 presidential race, said
Wednesday that he is taking his lead in a recent DPP support
ratings poll in stride.

Speaking on the campaign trail in the central county of Changhua,
Hsieh, who led Premier Su Tseng-chang in the preliminary DPP
supporter opinion poll whose results were released Tuesday, said
that poll numbers change constantly in a full-fledged democratic
society like Taiwan and that he accepts the poll result without
being too concerned about it.

"What is important is that the people are respected by the
aspirants, " Hsieh said, adding that he tries hard to maintain
his advantages over other hopefuls by constantly paying heed to
the voters' opinions and visions.

On which type of poll the DPP should use to select a candidate
for the presidential election among the four aspirants, Hsieh
said that although he favored the supporter-only polls during the
last legislative elections in 2004, he is open to whatever kind
of poll that the party decides to use for the presidential
election.

The three other DPP aspirants are Vice President Annette Lu,
Premier Su Tseng- chang and DPP Chairman Yu Shyi-kun.
