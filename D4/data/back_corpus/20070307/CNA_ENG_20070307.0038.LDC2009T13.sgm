Preparations for a 12-year compulsory education system will start
this year, with a subsidy program to be implemented in September
for private high school and vocational school students who are
economically disadvantaged, Premier Su Tseng-chang said at a
Legislative Yuan session Tuesday.

Answering questions from opposition Kuomintang (KMT) lawmaker Lee
Ching-an about the subsidy program, Su said it will exclude
students whose grades allow them to enter public schools but who
choose private schools instead, because doing so would suggest
that they are able to afford the tuition fees for private
schools.

Su said his administrative report shows the main direction for
the 12-year compulsory education system and that he will instruct
the Ministry of Education to publish explanations of any details
left unclear.

Education Minister Tu Cheng-sheng said the problem of school
district zoning -- a point of concern for the public -- will be
solved within one year.
