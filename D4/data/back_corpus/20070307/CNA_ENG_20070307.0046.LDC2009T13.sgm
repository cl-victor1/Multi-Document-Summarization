TAINTED CONTACT LENS SOLUTION REMOVED FROM STORE SHELVES

Taipei, March  7 (CNA) 03/07/07  21:51:03 (By Han Nai-kuo)

The Cabinet-level Department of Health (DOH) ordered Wednesday
that Bausch &amp; Lomb's contact lens cleaning solution -- ReNu
MultiPlus --  be removed from store shelves throughout Taiwan
within 24 hours.
</P>
<P>
A DOH spokesman said the move became necessary after Bausch &amp;
Lomb announced a day earlier that it was recalling 1.5 million
bottles of ReNu MultiPlus because trace levels of iron in the
product may cause the solution to turn yellowish and lose its
effectiveness before the printed expiration date.
</P>
<P>
Bausch's recall affects 12 lots of the product, which were
produced at a plant in South Carolina and sold in the United
States, Canada, Central and South America, Korea and Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
According to the DOH spokesman, Taiwan has imported a total of
18,144 bottles of the solution, each of a 120 ml volume. They
have been sold in more than 402 convenience and chain stores,
including Watson's and Cosmed.
</P>
<P>
Executives of both Watson's and Cosmed said Wednesday that they
will ask all of their stores to remove ReNu MultiPlus from the
shelves within 24 hours.
</P>
<P>
Bausch &amp; Lomb said in a statement Tuesday that the company
initiated an investigation after receiving three customer reports
of discolored solution.
</P>
<P>
The statement explained that a single batch of raw material
sourced from an outside supplier contained an elevated level of
trace iron which could combine with other compounds in the
solution and cause discoloration and make the solution
ineffective earlier than normal.
</P>
<P>
The company stressed that the latest recall was unrelated to the
earlier recall of ReNu MoistureLoc solution, which was associated
with an outbreak of the severe fungal eye infection known as
Fusarium keratitis.
</P>
<P>
In May last year, Bausch &amp; Lomb announced a full global
recall and permanent withdrawal of ReNu MoistureLoc from shelves
in the face of mounting evidence from the U.S. Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention that the product carried a
significant risk of fungal keratitis, which could cause permanent
damage or even blindness.
