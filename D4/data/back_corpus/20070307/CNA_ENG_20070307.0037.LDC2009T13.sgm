Taipei,  March 7 (CNA) 03/07/07  20:00:20 (By Ruth Wang)

The 2006 output value of Taiwan's health food industry increased
10 percent to reach NT$38 billion (US$1.15 billion) and its 2008
output value is forecast to reach NT$46 billion if the growth
rate is maintained, a spokesman for the Industrial Development
Bureau (IDB) said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The 2006 output quantity and value of Taiwanese chlorella (green
algae) topped the rest of the world, with most of it exported to
Japan.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said health foods have already become a mainstream
part of the food industry due to consumers' rising health
awareness and the national demographic inclining toward the
middle-aged and elderly. Official tallies show the scale of the
domestic market to be about NT$50 billion, with some direct
selling traders estimating that the figure is double that.
</P>
<P>
Most of Taiwan's 140 factories producing health foods are small-
and medium- sized enterprises, and the domestic sale of their
products is about 81 percent. The government is counselling these
enterprises on expanding their export markets.
</P>
<P>
The IDB has researched a variety of health food materials to help
develop the industry, including red yeast, rice bran, bitter
gourd and blue-green algae. It will also integrate the industry,
the government and academic institutions to develop high quality
products and market them internationally.
