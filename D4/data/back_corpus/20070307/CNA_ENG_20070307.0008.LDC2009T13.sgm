Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng assumed a reserved
attitude Wednesday when asked by media about his intentions
regarding running in the 2008 presidential election following his
earlier meeting with opposition Kuomintang (KMT) acting Chairman
Wu Poh-hsiung.
</P>
<P>
Wang met with Wu for nearly 90 minutes earlier the same day
before heading to the Legislative Yuan for work. In reply to
media inquiries, Wang said the two of them discussed issues
concerning party solidarity, the selection of Control Yuan
members, and the year-end legislative elections.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that Wu did not try to persuade him to run for KMT
chairman during the meeting, noting that they did not even
discuss the upcoming party chairmanship election.
</P>
<P>
Asked whether he will give up his bid for the presidency in order
to run for the KMT chairmanship, Wang responded by saying "there
is no such issue."
</P>
<P>
Wang is a KMT stalwart who is widely seen as a strong candidate
to represent the party in the 2008 presidential election
following Ma Ying-jeou's resignation from the post of KMT
chairman Feb. 13.
