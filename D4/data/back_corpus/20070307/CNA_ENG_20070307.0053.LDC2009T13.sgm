A group of cultural luminaries and environment-conscious
business executives urged the government Wednesday to scrap a
plan to build an expressway linking Suao in northeastern Yilan
County and Hualien County in eastern Taiwan for the sake of
ecological protection.
</P>
<P>
The celebrities, including Stanley C. Yen, CEO of Landis Taipei
Hotel, Lin Hwai- min, founder and choreographer of the world-
renowned Cloud Gate Dance Theater, and Hou Hsiao-hsien, a prize-
winning film director, said the government should drop the idea
of launching such a controversial  expressway  construction
project  which would definitely inflict irreparable to the
natural ecology of picturesque eastern Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
The government should immediately stop the ongoing environmental
impact evaluation related with the project and all other
subsequent action plans while instead working on a project to
"packaging" the two eastern counties -- Taitung and Hualien --
into the Taiwan version of Bali, an Indonesian resort island that
attracts hundreds of millions of tourists annually.
