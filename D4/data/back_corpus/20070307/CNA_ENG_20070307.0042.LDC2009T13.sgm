Cabinet passed a law amendment to promote competition in the oil
industry Wednesday, which lowers the minimum oil security reserve
requirements on oil importers from 50,000 kiloliters to 10,000
kiloliters.

The amendments to the Petroleum Administration Act will provide
more incentives for domestic and foreign companies to enter the
market, improve competition mechanisms and further stabilize oil
supply, the Bureau of Energy under the Ministry of Economic
Affairs said.

<P>
The bill also takes into account recent developments in energy
technology and expands the scope of its stipulations to cover
hydrocarbon oil, ethanol-blended gasoline and bio-diesel,
officials said.

<P>
The bill will have to pass the legislature to become law, and the
Cabinet has listed it as a priority bill in the current
legislature session.
