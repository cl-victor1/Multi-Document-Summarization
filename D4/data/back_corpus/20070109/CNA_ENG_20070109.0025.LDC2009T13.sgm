President Chen Shui-bian was delighted to hear about the birth of
his fourth grandchild -- a baby girl -- while he was at a dinner
party with Taiwanese expatriates in San Francisco Monday,  the
ruling Democratic Progressive Party chairman said.
</P>
<P>
Yu Shyi-kun made the remarks in response to media queries at the
hotel where the party was held, an event also attended by other
members of Chen's entourage, including Department of Health
Minister Hou Sheng-mou and Council of Agriculture Minister Su
Jia-chyuan.

Huang Juei-chin, the wife of Chen's only son Chen Shih-chung,
gave birth to a girl at 12:17 p.m. Tuesday, Taipei time, at
National Taiwan University Hospital in Taipei. Both mother and
child are in sound health.
</P>
<P>
President Chen was informed of the good news immediately after
the birth, Yu said, noting that Chen, appearing elated, said he
has waited a long time for a granddaughter since there are only
three grandsons in the family.
</P>
<P>
Chen was making an overnight transit stop in the city en route to
Nicaragua, where he is invited to attend Nicaraguan President-
elect Daniel Ortega's inauguration Jan. 10.
</P>
<P>
The stopover marked Chen's first visit to San Francisco since he
took power in 2000. Chen was grateful for the American Institute
in Taiwan's assistance in making his transit stop in the U.S.
possible, Yu said.

<P>
The last time President Chen set foot on U.S. soil was when he
made a transit stop in Miami in 2005.
