President Chen Shui-bian's daughter-in-law gave birth to a baby
girl at about noon Tuesday at National Taiwan University Hospital
(NTUH) , and both mother and daughter are in healthy condition,
Vice NTUH President Ho Hung-neng said.

<P>
Ho, the doctor attending the delivery, said the birth came two
weeks earlier than expected. It was not considered a premature
birth, however, as the baby weighs 2,836 grams and is 48.5 cm in
length.

<P>
It took the mother, Huang Juei-chin, over six hours to give birth
since she experienced her first contractions early morning, Ho
said, noting that for a first-time mother, it was a smooth and
relatively quick delivery.
</P>
<P>
Huang is the wife of President Chen's only son Chen Chih-chung,
who stayed with his wife to experience his daughter's birth.
</P>
<P>
According to NTUH, Huang and the newborn will stay at the
hospital for at least three days.
