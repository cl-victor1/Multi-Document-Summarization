A vast majority of Taiwan office workers hope to change jobs
after the Lunar New Year, according to the results of an online
survey made public Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
With the approach of the Chinese new year, which falls on Feb. 18
this year, 85 percent of white-collar employees surveyed said
that they are planning to change jobs after the holidays, citing
poor salaries, dim career prospects and personal life planning as
the major reasons, according to the poll conducted by the 1111
manpower bank.
</P>
<P>
As to the most important considerations in accepting a new job,
"good salaries, " "working environment, " and "handsome bonuses"
were mentioned most often by the respondents, according to the
poll.
</P>
<P>
On the question of what they hope to gain from switching jobs,
69.7 percent of the office workers surveyed mentioned "a better
salary, " 39.9 percent said "stable work demands and routine,"
and 35.1 percent mentioned "a good learning environment."
</P>
<P>
As around half of the white-collar employees working in Taipei,
Taiwan's largest city, are originally from central or southern
regions, some 38 percent of these workers said that they are
considering returning to their hometown to work there, mainly
because of the convenience of being close to their families, the
lower cost of living, and the friendlier atmosphere in smaller
towns.
</P>
<P>
As to the 62 percent who said they have opted to stay in Taipei,
the reasons cited included "more job opportunities in the north,
" "higher pay" and "greater career development possibilities,"
the survey showed.
</P>
<P>
The 1111 manpower bank carried out the Internet survey Dec.
15-29, and collected 1,160 valid questionnaires. The poll had a
margin of error of 2.8 percent.
