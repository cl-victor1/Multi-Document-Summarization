LAWMAKERS WANT OFFICIALS TO BOW OUT OVER BANK RUN
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  Jan.  9 (CNA) 01/09/07  21:18:50 (By Flor Wang)

<P>
Lawmakers from both the opposition and ruling parties demanded
Tuesday that relevant officials step down to take responsibility
for a recent run on the Chinese Bank.
</P>
<P>
Tsai Chin-lung, a legislative caucus whip of the main opposition
Kuomintang (KMT), and party lawmakers Chi Kuo-tung and Lin Cheng-
feng demanded that Minister of Finance Ho Chih-chin  and
Financial Supervisory Commission (FSC) Chairman Shih Jun-chi
resign from the posts in a news conference for what the lawmakers
described as their "amazing incompetence" in handling the bank
run last Friday.
</P>
<P>
Claiming that both men must step down due to their negligence
over the matter, the accusers said their calls on the public to
have confidence in the government in the wake of the incident did
not work at all.
</P>
<P>
They accused Ho of not even knowing how much money the Financial
Reconstruction Fund controls before promising to reimburse the
bank's customer deposits from the national coffers.
</P>
<P>
The aim of the fund is to help maintain financial order in the
domestic market and its money, contributed by taxpayers, must not
be used to bail out faulty financial institutions, they said.
</P>
<P>
The government ordered the Central Deposit Insurance Corporation
to take over the troubled Chinese Bank after the run broke out
Jan. 5.
</P>
<P>
Although the FSC has listed a few questionable banks, including
the Chinese Bank, under its scrutiny for five years, Tsai accused
the government agency of turning a blind eye to the banks'
operations and insisted that relevant officials must be strictly
held accountable in accordance with the law.
</P>
<P>
In a news conference held at the Legislative Yuan, ruling
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) lawmakers Charles Chiang, Yu
Jan-daw, Wu Ming-min and Wang To-far blasted Premier Su Tseng-
chang for failing to meet the people's high expectations for
financial reform and demanded that FSC officials responsible for
the issue bow out.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese Bank still had NT$11.4 billion in assets until
recently, but the FSC now had to manage NT$40 billion in cash to
deal with the effects of the run, Chiang said, saying that it is
necessary to deal with the shortfall, worth more than NT$50
billion.
</P>
<P>
Accountants in charge of the Chinese Bank's "false accounts" must
also be held responsible according to the law, Chiang added.
</P>
<P>
Yu accused the FSC of responding too slowly to the bank run and
argued against the public having to pay for its losses. He asked
the investigation and prosecution authorities to probe whether
lawmakers or government officials were behind the bank to help
cover its misconduct.
</P>
<P>
Yu urged Su to make bold moves regarding the Chinese Bank case if
he hopes to become a front-runner in the 2008 presidential
election.
</P>
<P>
Wu, meanwhile, asked whether there is something wrong with the
immigration authorities' response system, because Wang You-tseng,
chairman of the Rebar Asia Pacific Group, to which the Chinese
Bank belongs to, has fled to China.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese Bank run broke out after two Rebar Group subsidiaries
filed for a bankruptcy protection a day earlier. Wang and his
wife reportedly left Taiwan for Shanghai last Saturday.
