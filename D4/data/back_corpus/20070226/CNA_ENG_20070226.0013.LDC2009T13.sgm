Trust indices for both President Chen Shui-bian and the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) rose in the latest public
opinion poll conducted in February, the Global Views Monthly
reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
In its Taiwan public mood index (TPMI) survey for February, the
magazine found that Chen's trust index had risen to 33.7, up 0.7
points from January, while the DPP's "ruling side trust index"
had advanced to 34.6, up one point from January.
</P>
<P>
The monthly attributed the rising trust indices mainly to the
president's and the DPP's recent steps aimed at winning back the
hearts and souls of pro- independence diehards ahead of the DPP
presidential primary, including the removal of references to the
late President Chiang Kai-shek from Taiwan and the changing of
the names of several state-owned enterprises to add "Taiwan" to
their titles.

<P>
The trust index for Premier Su Tseng-chang, however, dropped 1.5
points to 52.7 in February, the survey found. Despite the fall,
Su remained the most popular figure among the DPP heavyweights
and the only DPP official to enjoy a trust index exceeding 50,
pollsters of the monthly said.
</P>
<P>
By comparison, the survey found, the trust index for former
Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Ma Ying-jeou remained at 54.2, the same
as that posted in January. The February survey was conducted
before Ma resigned as KMT chairman Feb. 13, the day he was
indicted on corruption charges.
</P>
<P>
The trust index for the main opposition KMT dropped -- down 2.5
points to 46.5 in February, according to the survey results.
</P>
<P>
The Taiwan public mood index stood at 39.5 in February, the same
as that posted in January. That index was composed of a political
confidence index, which stood at 43.1, and an economic confidence
index, which stood at 35.8, according to the monthly.
