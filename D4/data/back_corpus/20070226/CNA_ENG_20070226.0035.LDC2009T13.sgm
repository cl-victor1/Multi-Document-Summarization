President Chen Shui-bian said Monday that foreign nationals and
Chinese tourists should be given access to direct charter flight
services across the Taiwan Strait if Taipei and Beijing finally
come to terms on relevant issues.
</P>
<P>
Chen made the remarks while attending a Lunar New Year gathering
at Taipei Grand Hotel of Taiwanese businesspeople operating in
Cina, known locally as "taishang."
</P>
<P>
After years of efforts, Chen said, progress has been made on
cross-strait negotiations over the opening of Taiwan to Chinese
tourists as well as the launch of regular cross-strait charter
flight services.
</P>
<P>
"It is hoped that bilateral talks can come to fruition in the
near future so that ordinary Chiense people can visit Taiwan to
experience diversity, openness and hospitability in local
society, " Chen said.
</P>
<P>
According to Chen, the two sides have reached consensus on
technical  details regarding the opening of Taiwan to Chinese
tourists, including the "group-in, group-out" formula, the daily
number of Chinese tourists to be allowed to enter Taiwan,
regulations governing travel agencies, delivery of travel
documents, travel quality assurance, treatment of overstaying
visitors and a mechanism for handling emergencies.
</P>
<P>
Chen said relevant government agencies will continue negotiations
with China on unsettled issues to pave the way for entry of
Chinese tourists.
</P>
<P>
As to the launch of direct charter flights, Chen said significant
progress has been made in this regard over the past two years.
"I'm convinced that convenient direct cross-strait passenger and
cargo flight services will become available on a regular basis in
the not too distant future," Chen said.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Chen said the government has completed an overall
review of the "mini three links" services between the Taiwan-held
outlying island of Kinmen and Matsu and port cities of Xiamen and
Mawei in China's Fujian province. The government will adopt some
flexible adjustments to expand availability of relevant services.
</P>
<P>
The government will also allow for conversion of Chinese currency
in small amount on an experimental basis, Chen said, adding that
all these measures are aimed at promoting development of cross-
strait relations in a constructive direction. "They are our
response to the growing force of 'taishang,'" the president
added.
