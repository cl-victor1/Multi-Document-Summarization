A planned leadership meeting between the Republic of China and
its African allies may be held in Taiwan, Minister of Foreign
Affairs James Huang said Monday but noted that the plan won't be
settled before discussions between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
Huang made the remarks in response to media inquiries on recent
news reports saying that President Chen Shui-bian may visit
Africa in March for the planned summit.
</P>
<P>
"So far, the president has no overseas travel plans for March and
the planned ROC-Africa summit may be held in Taiwan," Huang said.
</P>
<P>
Leaders of five African allies -- Burkina Faso, the Republic of
Malawi, the Democratic Republic of Sao Tome and Principe, the
Kingdom of Swaziland, and the Republic of The Gambia -- have all
said they would be delighted to come to Taiwan for the meeting,
Huang said, adding Taiwan has the proper soft- and hardware
facilities to host such an international event, and that his
ministry is currently working to come up with a plan for the
Taiwan to host the summit.
</P>
<P>
Asked about a news report that said Saint Lucia -- a Caribbean
island-state -- might sever its diplomatic ties with China after
the Chinese New Year festival, Huang declined to make a comment,
saying only that the ROC will spare no efforts to make new allies
in its drive to expand its foreign relations.
