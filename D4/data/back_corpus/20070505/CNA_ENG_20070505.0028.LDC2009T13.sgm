English proficiency is as important as professional expertise, if
not more important,  in determining Taiwanese white-collar
workers' chances of getting hired by foreign companies, a
spokesman for a job hunting service said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"The number of registered foreign companies in Taiwan has reached
more than 3,000, which accounts for only less than one percent of
all registered companies in the country. That shows you how
difficult it is to get a job with a foreign enterprise in Taiwan.
And more often than not, your English proficiency will be the
deciding factor," said Ryan Wu, vice general manager of 1111 Job
Bank.
</P>
<P>
Representatives from various leading foreign companies agreed
with Wu's view in a press conference held Saturday to announce
the results of a poll on office workers' dream foreign employers.
The survey found that over 96 percent of Taiwan's white-collar
workers want to work for foreign enterprises.

<P>
Employees of a foreign company are expected to attend at least
one English- speaking meeting a week, and in Yahoo! Taiwan's
case, it's almost a daily routine, said Lu Wen-shiou, Yahoo!
Taiwan's human resources director.
</P>
<P>
"All our e-mails, documents and reports are in English. And most
of our meetings are conducted in English, " said Chou Su-huei,
human resources manager for American Express.
</P>
<P>
Most companies do not require language proficiency certificates
from their newly-recruited employees, because most of them hold
oral interviews prior to the hirings, and "there's no place for
you to 'hide' once you're hired, " Wu said.
</P>
<P>
"To be considered proficient in English, you not only have to be
able to attend English-speaking meetings and understand what your
colleagues are saying, you also have to be able to participate in
the discussions, chair meetings and even socialize after the
meetings -- all in English, " Wu said half-jokingly.
</P>
<P>
At the press conference, "four dream foreign employers" for
Taiwanese white- collar workers in four categories were announced
according to the results of the online survey. They are: IBM
Corp. (manufacturing industry), American Express (financial
industry), IKEA (retail industry), and Yahoo Group (all other
industries).
