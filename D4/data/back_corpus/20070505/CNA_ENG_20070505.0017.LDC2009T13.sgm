BRITISH MP PROMOTES MOTION FOR WHO MEMBERSHIP FOR TAIWAN
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
London,  May 4 (CNA) 05/05/07  16:06:36 (By J.J. Hwang and Y.F.
Low)
</P>
<P>
A member of the British Parliament put forth a motion Friday to
back up Taiwan's bid to become a full member of the World Health
Organization (WHO).
</P>
<P>
The motion proposed by Nicholas Winterton, a co-chair of the
Taiwan Group in Parliament, encourages the British government to
throw its support behind the cause and to urge the WHO to invite
Taiwan to take part as an observer in the World Health Assembly
-- the WHO's highest decision-making body -- before the country's
official accession.
</P>
<P>
Edgar Lin, Taiwan's representative to the United Kingdom, said
that while countries including the United States and Japan have
so far only expressed support for Taiwan's participation in the
WHA as an observer, the proposed motion marks the first of its
kind favoring full WHO membership for Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the Holy See, Palestine and Malta have been invited
to attend the upcoming WHA gathering slated for May 14-23 as
observers, the proposed motion expresses regret at the fact that
the WHA has refused for the last ten consecutive years to include
on its agenda the issue of Taiwan's bid.
</P>
<P>
The motion says it is totally legitimate for Taiwan to request
membership in the WHO and meaningful participation in the WHA
before becoming a full member.
