</HEADLINE>

Washington,  May  4 (CNA) 05/05/07  14:04:14 (By Michelle Tsai
and Y.F. Low)
</P>
<P>
Five members of the U.S. House of Representatives have proposed a
resolution in support of the signing of a free trade agreement
(FTA) between the United States and Taiwan, a Taiwan official
said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The proposed resolution, which urges the administration of
President George W. Bush to start FTA talks with Taiwan soon for
an early conclusion of the agreement, was jointly put forth May 1
by Congressional Taiwan Caucus co-chairs Shelley Berkley
(D-Nev.), Steve Chabot (R-Ohio), Dana Rohrabacher (R-Calif.) and
Bob Wexler (D-Fla.), as well as Rep. Jim Ramstad (R-Minn.).
</P>
<P>
Stanley Kao, Taiwan's deputy representative to the United States,
noted that while this is the third time that a similar resolution
has been proposed in the House, it is the first one that has been
initiated by more than one member of Congress.
</P>
<P>
The bipartisan congressional support for the signing of a
U.S.-Taiwan FTA indicates the importance that members of Congress
attach to enhancing trade relations between the two countries,
Kao said.
</P>
<P>
He said the move has come at a "very ideal time" as the recent
conclusion of FTA talks between the United States and South Korea
is expected to impact Taiwan's industrial sector.
</P>
<P>
In addition to Congress, a number of state legislatures around
the United States have made similar moves, with 21 legislative
bodies in 15 states having adopted resolutions between January
and April this year to express their support for a U.S.-Taiwan
FTA, Kao said.
</P>
<P>
The proposed congressional resolution says Taiwan, as a member of
the World Trade Organization (WTO), should enjoy the same right
that other WTO members have to sign free trade agreements with
other countries.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan shares common values with the United States in terms of
democracy and free market economy, providing a strong foundation
for open, fair and reciprocal bilateral trade relations,
according to the draft resolution.
</P>
<P>
It says the close relations between the two countries over the
past 50 years have brought about tremendous economic, cultural
and strategic benefits to both sides
</P>
<P>
It notes that the volume of bilateral trade was valued at US$60
billion in 2006, with the United States being Taiwan's second
largest export market and Taiwan being the eighth largest export
market of the United States.
</P>
<P>
By consumption per capita, Taiwan is the largest consumer of U.S.
agricultural products, with the island being the third largest
overseas market for U.S. beef and corn, the fifth largest
overseas market for U.S. soy beans, and the eighth largest
overseas market for U.S. wheat, according to the draft
resolution.
