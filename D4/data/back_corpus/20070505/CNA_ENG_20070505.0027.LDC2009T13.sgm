GOVERNMENT CRITICIZED FOR IGNORING MANDARIN EDUCATION

The non-profit Association for the Promotion of Chinese Language
and Cultural Education, initiated by popular poet Yu Kuang-chung,
blamed the government Saturday for the deteriorating Madarin
proficiency among young Taiwan people today.
</P>
<P>
Yu and members of the association made up of scholars and experts
in the education sector held a news conference at the Legislative
Yuan during which they released a statement  criticizing  the
government's disregard of Mandarin education in schools.
</P>
<P>
This disregard has resulted in most students being reluctant to
read classic Chinese articles, and the growing demand for
education authorities to cut down on the number of classic
Chinese texts taught in schools has led to a decrease in the
standard of the country's Mandarin education, according to the
statement.
</P>
<P>
The statement also said that the Ministry of Education's multiple
language policy, which demands that elementary schools offer
English and "mother tongue" courses, has done nothing but deplete
the energy of students in learning.
</P>
<P>
The statement also asked the question whether the government's
ongoing campaign to purge the island of anything Chinese has
undermined the use of Mandarin in Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
The association, a civil group founded in May 2006 with the aim
of monitoring the government's  Chinese-language  and cultural
education policy, suggested that the Chinese-language and
cultural courses in high schools, colleges and universities cover
all kinds of classic literary works, cultural ideologies and
national identities in different historical periods in Chinese
society.
