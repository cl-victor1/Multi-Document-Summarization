Taiwan's gross domestic product (GDP) will grow by 5.4 percent and 4.9
percent for 2004 and 2005, respectively, according to a report
released Friday by the United Nations-affiliated Economic and Social
Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP).

According to the report, Taiwan's economy will perform better in these
two years. The country's GDP increased by 3.3 percent in 2003, while
mainland China and South Korea registered growth of 9 percent and 3
precent, respectively. The mainland's fast growth did not pay off the
poorer ratios posted by Taiwan and South Korea last year, with the
region's GDP averaging a ratio lower than the 2002 level of 6.4
percent.

In contrast, the overall outlook for economic development in the Asia-
Pacific region this year is optimistic, the report says, adding that
the economies of Taiwan and South Korea are steadily recovering but
pointing out that political situations may affect their economic
performance.

<P>
The economies in East Asia and Northeast Asia, including mainland
China, Hong Kong, Mongolia, South Korea and Taiwan, will register an
average GDP growth of 6.6 percent for 2004, with mainland China
expected to outperform others with an 8.5 percent growth rate.

However, the report warns that continued snowballing financial
deficits are an issue of major concern in the short term for countries
in the region. A cumulative public debt will result in stronger
pressure to push up key interest rates and lead to greater investment
risks.
</P>
<P>
The ESCAP suggests that Asia-Pacific countries launch fiscal reform
across the board to lower their debt levels in comparison with their
GDP growth rates.
