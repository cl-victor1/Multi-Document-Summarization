Scholars and experts are worried about the safety of children in
Taiwan, according to the results of an annual child safety survey
released Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The 2007 Child Safety Index survey was conducted by the Jing
Chuan Child Safety Foundation among fifth- and sixth-grade
students and parents, as well as scholars and experts in child
safety in April in rating child safety according to various
criteria, including safety in public places, homes, school campus
and playgrounds, and traffic.
</P>
<P>
In a 0-100 scoring system with 100 points featuring the best
rating, the scholars and experts responding to the poll gave an
average score of 45.51 points to child safety in public places.
The number was the lowest among the ratings, making public places
seen as the largest threat to child safety, said Lin Yue-chin,
chief executive of the foundation.
</P>
<P>
Notably, scores from professionals in the rest of the ratings
were all below 60 points, while the parents scored safety in
public places at 63.51 points, the lowest of all their ratings.
The students appeared most worried by traffic safety, with a
score of 77.37 points, the lowest among all their ratings.

<P>
Lin said that according to statistics of the Department of
Health, traffic accidents remain the major cause of child
fatalities in Taiwan.

<P>
The foundation also held a ceremony to pay homage to the victims
of a tour bus fire 15 years ago in which 20 kindergarten children
burned to death along with their teacher Lin Jing-chuan  who
sacrificed herself by staying in the burning bus in an attempt to
rescue the children.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the 20 kids and Lin, two parents were also killed.
</P>
<P>
In the solemn ceremony,  foundation Chairman Lin Chih-chia
announced that President Chen Shui-bian has agreed to designate
May 15 as national Child Safety Day in an effort to raise public
awareness of child safety.
