MOFA REGRETS SETBACK IN WHO MEMBERSHIP BID
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  May 15 (CNA) 05/15/07  09:41:37 (By Sofia Wu)

The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) expressed deep regrets and
dissatisfaction Tuesday over the results of a vote at the opening
session of the World Health Assembly (WHA) a day earlier in which
Taiwan's  bid to join the World Health Organization (WHO) as a
full member was rebuffed.
</P>
<P>
The WHA, the decision-making arm of the WHO, approved Monday a
Russian motion by a vote of 148-17 with two abstentions to strike
discussion of Taiwan's membership bid off the agenda of this
week's annual meeting of the world health regulatory body.
</P>
<P>
All major countries, including the United States, Japan, European
Union member states and Canada, didn't give their weight behind
Taiwan's WHO bid because of their "one China" policy, under which
they think Taiwan doesn't qualify a WHO seat that requires
statehood.
</P>
<P>
In the vote, only 17 of Taiwan's diplomatic allies threw their
weight behind Taiwan's cause. Much to Taiwan's disappointment,
Costa Rica cast a negative vote -- the only Taiwan ally to do so.
</P>
<P>
Four other allies -- Panama, Nicaragua, the Marshall Islands and
Saint Lucia -- were absent from the session, while Haiti
abstained from the voting. As to its remaining two allies, the
Dominican Republic has no voting right, while the Vatican is not
a WHO member.
</P>
<P>
Despite the absence of diplomatic ties, the Philippines didn't
vote against Taiwan but instead adstained from the voting.
</P>
<P>
MOFA spokesman Wang Chien-yeh said Taiwan appreciates all the
support extended by its allies in its pursuit of WHO accession.
Despite the defeat, he said the government will not be daunted by
any challenges and adversities that may lie ahead and will
continue going all out for its quest for WHO representation to
maintain local people's health rights.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Wang didn't hide the government's unhappiness and
regret over the results. He said the MOFA will study why Costa
Rica voted against Taiwan's membership bid and why the four other
allies failed to attend the session to extend a helping hand.
</P>
<P>
The vote was the first of its kind as Taiwan didn't apply for WHO
membership until this year. In the past decade, Taiwan has only
sought to gain observer status within the WHA, but such efforts
have consistently been dashed by China's obstruction.
</P>
<P>
For many years, Taiwan had to fight epidemics alone without any
assistance from the WHO due to China's objections. In recent
years, Taiwan has managed to gain limited access to WHO
activities. But all communications between the two sides must be
addressed to China, a fact that could jeopardize Taiwan's ability
to cope with major medical emergencies and create gaps in the
global health monitoring system.
</P>
<P>
Wang  said Taiwan's  continued  quest  for meaningful  WHO
participation is not only aimed at asserting Taiwan people's
health rights but also at arousing world attention to the
potential threat to the global epidemic control network with
Taiwan's exclusion from the system.
