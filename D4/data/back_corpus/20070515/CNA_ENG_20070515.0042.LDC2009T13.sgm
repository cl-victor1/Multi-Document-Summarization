Premier Su Tseng-chang presided over a meeting Tuesday on
fighting crime and improving maintaining law and order.
</P>
<P>
It was the last time that Su has presided over a crime-fighting
meeting in his capacity as premier, Cabinet spokeswoman Chen Mei-
lin said.
</P>
<P>
Su announced his resignation May 12, less than a week after
losing the Democratic Progressive Party's presidential primary.
Su and his Cabinet are scheduled to resign en masse Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Chen noted that Su has presided over every crime-fighting meeting
during his premiership.
</P>
<P>
According to Chen, Su expressed gratitude to all Cabinet members
and law enforcement officers at Tuesday's meeting. He also
expressed his hope that the public has noticed the improved
social order due to the government's efforts over the last 15
months.

<P>
Su said the government has "tried very hard" to make criminal
gangs disappear and has spent a huge amount of energy fighting
drug and gun smuggling, preventing school bullying and helping
school drop-outs, although he admitted there is still room for
improvement.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on the same occasion, Hou Yu-ih, director-general of the
National Police Agency, said Su has prompted Taiwan's police to
carry on the fight against criminal gangs.
