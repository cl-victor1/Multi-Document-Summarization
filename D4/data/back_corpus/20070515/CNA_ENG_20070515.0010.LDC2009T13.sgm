<P>
Chinese dumping of cheap bedding in Taiwan has directly impacted
the livelihood of local bedding suppliers, and the government
should address the problem, representatives of bedding makers
said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Accompanied by Legislator Gao Jyh-peng of the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party, more than a dozen representatives from the
Taipei Bedding Association and the Taipei Bedding Commerce Guild
called for the government to pay attention to the problem in a
news conference.
</P>
<P>
The representatives claimed that shoddy bedding from China is not
labeled with the place of origin in order to mislead customers.
</P>
<P>
If the government does not take steps to address the problem,
they said, more than 7,000 manufacturers will be forced to close
down and nearly 70,000 workers will lose their jobs within one
year.
</P>
<P>
Gao also said that currently, Chinese bedding is not on the list
of controlled imports, resulting in an influx of cheap bedding
from China into Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
The bedding has not undergone rigorous testing, Gao said, adding
that even official Chinese investigations have shown that up to
54 percent of the bedding produced in China has high levels of
the chemical compound methanol.
</P>
<P>
The shoddy quality of Chinese bedding poses a health threat to
the public, the representatives said, adding that its impact on
public health is even more serious than that of Chinese towels
which have also made their way into Taiwan in large quantities.
</P>
<P>
If the issue of the dumping of Chinese bedding is not dealt with,
then 7,170 manufacturers, including weavers, dyers and zipper
producers, as well as retailers will have to close down within
one year, and 66,000 laborers will lose their jobs, they said.
</P>
<P>
The representatives asked the Ministry of Economic Affairs and
the Ministry of Finance to implement "import relief" measures
just as they did for local towel manufacturers in the wake of
Chinese towel dumping.
</P>
<P>
The government should also impose an anti-dumping tax on imported
Chinese bedding to protect the rights of local manufacturers,
they added.
</P>
<P>
Wang Yi-hsien, a section chief of the International Trade
Commission under the Ministry of Economic Affairs, said that the
commission will put Chinese bedding on its monitoring list and
will activate trade relief procedures if the quantity and price
of Chinese bedding continue to undermine local bedding
manufacturers.
