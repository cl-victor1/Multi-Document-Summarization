BIGGEST TASK TO HELP DPP WIN ELECTIONS: PREMIER-DESIGNATE
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  May 15 (CNA) 05/15/07  18:33:33 (By Lilian Wu)

<P>
Premier-designate Chang Chun-hsiung said Tuesday that his biggest
task will be to help the ruling Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) win the year-end legislative as well as the presidential
elections in 2008.
</P>
<P>
Chang made the remarks while attending a DPP caucus meeting at
the Legislative Yuan in which he elaborated on his priorities
after he assumes the premiership May 21.
</P>
<P>
The return of Chang to his old post during the last year of
President Chen Shui- bian's second and last four-year term is
widely seen as playing the role of a relief pitcher who will take
up the campaigning work for the major elections.
</P>
<P>
Chang himself echoed that view, telling DPP lawmakers that he
will give priority to helping the party keep grip on power
because if the opposition "pan-blue alliance" of the Kuomintang
(KMT) and the People First Party (PFP) win the presidential
election next year, "President Chen Shui-bian's performance over
the past eight years will be dismissed as worthless."
</P>
<P>
He defended his own performance during his first premiership
2000-2002 amid criticism that Taiwan's economic growth was a
negative 2.2 percent in 2001 and that his announcement of the
suspension of construction of the fourth nuclear power plant in
October 2000 resulted in astronomical losses. The construction
only resumed the following year.
</P>
<P>
Chang noted that the U.S. electronics industry slumped by 46
percent, while Singapore's economic growth was a negative 2.3
percent during that time.
</P>
<P>
The opposition should not blame him for world economic factors,
Chang said, adding that his projects of halving the land value-
added taxes and rejuvenating CSBC Corp. Taiwan had good results.
</P>
<P>
Responding to reports that the PFP is pushing to topple his
Cabinet, Chang said he will respect the opposition for whatever
action it takes.
</P>
<P>
But he also said the opposition has "no right to do whatever it
likes" and that it should be accountable to the public.
</P>
<P>
The PFP said the Cabinet's suspension of the construction of the
fourth nuclear power plant dented Taiwan's credibility in the
business community and that Chang was listed as persona non grata
in the Legislative Yuan.
</P>
<P>
His re-appointment as premier is only to carry out Chen's will
during his last year, the PFP said, describing him as definitely
unfit for the post.
