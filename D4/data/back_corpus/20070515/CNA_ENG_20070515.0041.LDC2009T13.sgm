Japan-based Nakajima Loshto Co. has invited Changhua County
Magistrate Cho Po- yuan to join a reaping ceremony in Japan June
4 for the top-quality Japanese rice strain called "dream beauty,"
a local government official said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese firm has collaborated with a Taiwanese rice firm,
the Unionrice Co., to plant the superior strain of Japanese rice
in Taiwan under contract. The rice was planted on a trial basis
in 2006, followed by the planting of 80 hectares in Pitou
Township in Changhua County after patent rights were acquired by
Unionrice Co. this year.

According to the official, representatives of the Japanese firm
called on Cho in the company of Chuang Li-chu, chairwoman of the
Unionrice Co., to invite Cho to join the harvest ceremony and to
lead a delegation to promote Taiwan-grown "dream beauty" rice in
Japan when it enters the market.

<P>
Cho said that he has confidence in Changhua County's farm produce
and that he will make efforts to boost exchanges with Japan's
agriculture sector in the hopes that the high quality "dream
beauty" rice can also be marketed globally, according to the
official.
