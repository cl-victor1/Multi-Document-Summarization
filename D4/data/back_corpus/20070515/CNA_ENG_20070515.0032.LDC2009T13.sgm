Taiwan's household sewer connection rate as of late April had
reached 16.13 percent, which is higher than the expected year-end
goal of 15.2 percent, an official of the Council for the Economic
Planning and Development (CEPD) said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The CEPD examined the progress of sewer system construction and
found that the sewage treatment rate also exceeded the year-end
objective of 27.4 percent, reaching 34.94 percent, the official
said.

According to the official, the household sewer connection rate is
an important indicator of a country's modernization. Taiwan is
behind European and American countries and even behind Asian
countries like Malaysia,  Indonesia, South Korea and Japan in
terms of this indicator.

<P>
In order to achieve a quick improvement of this indicator, the
government included the sewer system construction in Taiwan's 10
New Major Construction, Projects program and scheduled a six-year
construction  project with a budget of NT$46 billion (US$1.37
billion).
