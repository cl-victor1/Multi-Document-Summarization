The government's efforts to battle software piracy has paid off,
as figures released by the Business Software Alliance (BSA) show
that the piracy rate in Taiwan dropped 2 percentage points in
2006 to 41 percent, a BSA head for the Taiwan area said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Sung Hung-shih, a BSA co-chairwoman for the Taiwan area, noted
that this was the first time in five years that the piracy rate
in Taiwan has recorded a drop.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan was one of 62 countries from among 102 listed countries to
have recorded a drop in their piracy rates last year.
</P>
<P>
According to Sung, Taiwan's law enforcement agents seized NT$500
million-worth of pirated software in 2006.
</P>
<P>
She said that although the piracy rate dropped, the losses caused
by pirates to Taiwan's economy rose from NT$110 million to NT$180
million, mainly because the software market continued to grow
last year.
</P>
<P>
Citing statistics compiled by the BSA, Sung said the software
piracy rate remained at 35 percent worldwide in 2006, while the
Asia-Pacific region had a rate of 55 percent.
</P>
<P>
The piracy rates for some other Asian countries were 82 percent
in China, 39 percent in Singapore and 25 percent in Japan.
