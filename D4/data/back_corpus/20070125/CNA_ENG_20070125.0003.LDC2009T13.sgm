The ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) has kicked off the
second stage of a signature campaign in its bid to hold a
national referendum on forcing the main opposition Kuomintang
(KMT) to return its "ill-gotten" assets to the state coffers.
</P>
<P>
Four DPP bigwigs -- Vice President Annette Lu, Premier Sun Tseng-
chang, DPP Chairman Yu Shyi-kun and former Premier Frank Hsieh --
took the lead in signing their names on the referendum petition
form Wednesday to show their support while attending a weekly
party meeting.
</P>
<P>
Yu, who picked up blank petition forms from the Central Election
Commission a day earlier, said the party will pull out all the
stops to collect as many signatures as possible over the next six
months.
</P>
<P>
Under the terms of the Referendum Law, the DPP must collect at
least 830,000 signatures within the next six months in order for
the issue to be put to a national referendum.
</P>
<P>
In the course of the campaign, Yu said, the DPP will collaborate
with the 1,000 member groups of the Grand Alliance for Retrieving
KMT Assets in order to realize the goal of holding a referendum
to force the KMT to relinquish its huge party assets, which the
DPP claims the KMT acquired improperly during its 55 years in
power until 2000.
</P>
<P>
Yu also urged KMT Chairman Ma Ying-jeou to deliver on his promise
to "freeze" his party's properties, unveil in detail records of
transfers of party assets to third-party groups or individuals
over the past few years, and return all of its "ill-gotten"
assets to the national treasury.
</P>
<P>
It is hoped that a national referendum on the KMT assets can be
held simultaneously with the year-end legislative elections to
save costs, Yu said.
