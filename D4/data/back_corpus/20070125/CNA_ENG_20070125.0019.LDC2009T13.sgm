A Taiwan charity foundation has promised to donate US$200,000
(NT$6,574,000) to help its counterpart in Panama establish a rest
home, said a foundation official Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Pao-Pan Hsiao-dai, the founder of the Simply Help Foundation,
inked a deal Wednesday with a representative in charge of a
Panama foundation for the elderly. The signing was witnessed by
Taiwan's ambassador to Panama, Hou Ping- fu, and Archbishop of
Panama Jose Dimas Cedeno.
</P>
<P>
Wong Yan-tien, the president of the Taiwan foundation's branch in
the U.S. state of New Jersey, said that the foundation expressed
its willingness to help build a rest home last year following his
visit in the previous year.
</P>
<P>
The rest home will be erected in Los Santos province, the
archbishop's hometown, with construction scheduled to be finished
this September.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the Simply Help Foundation inaugurated a branch in
Panama on the same day and donated clothes and toys to a local
orphanage.
</P>
<P>
During their stay in Panama, Pao-Pan and other foundation
officials contacted a local aboriginal group to establish the
basis for future cooperation, and visited a women's occupational
training center sponsored by the Republic of China embassy.
</P>
<P>
The embassy donated 10 sewing machines to the center to assist
poor Panama women in making a living, Ho said, adding that the
embassy will soon donate 1,000 computers to local schools.
