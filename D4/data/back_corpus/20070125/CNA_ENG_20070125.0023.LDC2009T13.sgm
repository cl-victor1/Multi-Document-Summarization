Hu Sheng-cheng, chairman of the Council for Economic Planning and
Development (CEPD), will be the country's new top financial
supervisor, Cabinet spokesman Cheng Wen-tsang announced Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Hu, an economist-turned-technocrat, will succeed Shih Jun-ji as
chairman of the Financial Supervisory Commission, Cheng said at a
news conference.
</P>
<P>
Shih tendered his resignation Jan. 12 to assume political
responsibility for the fallout of a run on the Chinese Bank
earlier this month and the financial fiasco of the bank's parent
compny Rebar Asia Pacific Group.

<P>
Cheng further said the post to be vacated by Hu's job transfer
will be filled by Ho Mei-yueh, a minister-without-portfolio who
once served as CEPD vice chairwoman and economics minister.

Meanwhile, Cheng said Yang Chung-ho, president of the Taipei
Physical Education College, will head the National Council on
Physical Fitness and Sports (NCPFS) . The top administrative
sport post has been left vacant since former NCPFS Chairman Chen
Chuan-shou resigned late last year to take the blame for local
athletes' worse-than-expected performance in the 2006 Doha Asian
Games.
</P>
<P>
Another vacant Cabinet post -- chairman of the Fair Trade
Commission -- will be filled by former Kaohsiung Deputy Mayor
Tang Chin-chuan, Cheng said.
