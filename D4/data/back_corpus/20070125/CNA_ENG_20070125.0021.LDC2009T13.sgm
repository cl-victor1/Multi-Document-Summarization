President Chen Shui-bian proposed Thursday that the country mark
the 60th anniversary of the 228 Incident this year by either
holding a commemorative ceremony at the site of the incident or
organizing a march to the site to mourn the victims of the
massacre.
</P>
<P>
Alternatively, temples around the country could toll bells and
beat drums simultaneously at 2: 28 p.m. on Feb. 28 to pray for
the nation, Chen suggested in the latest issue of his online
newsletter.
</P>
<P>
"We want to vow, faithfully and steadfastly, that we will not
allow this historical tragedy to be repeated. And we want to pray
for the early realization of justice,  peace,  reconciliation
and forgiveness," Chen said.
</P>
<P>
While many people in the past defined the 228 Incident as an
ethnic conflict, the nature of the incident was a suppression of
democracy, he said.
</P>
<P>
Chen noted that 40 percent of victims of the "white terror"
during the martial law era were mainlanders, although the group
accounted for only 15 percent of Taiwan's population, a fact
which he said proves that anyone challenging the authoritarian
rule of the Kuomintang (KMT)  government of the time would be
subject to relentless suppression and persecution.
</P>
<P>
In addition to learning a lesson from the incident and protecting
the country's hard-fought democratic achievements, the government
must address the issue of "transitional justice" as the country
prepares to commemorate the 60th anniversary of the incident, he
said.
</P>
<P>
According to the president, the country needs to clarify the past
authoritarian rulers' responsibility for human rights violations
before it can walk out of the shadow of authoritarianism.
</P>
<P>
The 228 Incident is named after a rebellion sparked on Feb. 28,
1947, against KMT rule. It has been estimated that some 30,000
people were killed by KMT troops in the months following the
rebellion.
</P>
<P>
According to an investigative report released by the 228 Incident
Memorial Foundation,  late Republic of China President  Chiang
Kai-shek, who dispatched the KMT troops to Taiwan, should bear
the largest share of responsibility for the tragedy.
