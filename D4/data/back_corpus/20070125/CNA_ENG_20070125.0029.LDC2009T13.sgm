The president of the Taipei Physical Education College, Yang
Chung-ho, was named the nation's top sports official Thursday,
replacing Chen Chuan-shou, who resigned late last year to take
responsibility  for Taiwan  athletes' lackluster performances in
the Doha Asian Games in November 2006.
</P>
<P>
Upon  acknowledging  his  appointment  as chairman  of the
Cabinet-level National Council of Physical Fitness and Sports
(NCPFS), Yang -- who was a national-level athlete before going to
the United States to obtain a doctorate in education -- said he
would reform the country's sports sector and improve professional
athletes' quality from the perspective of education.
</P>
<P>
A nation's strong performance in games and other sporting events
must be built on a pyramid-shaped sports development, Yang said,
adding that at present the country follows an inverted pyramid
sports development policy, where seeking scores and good
performance in international events is given top priority -- a
situation that he said will not be beneficial in the long run.
</P>
<P>
Yang is known for the Taipei Physical Education College's
nurturing of many outstanding athletes -- including New York
Yankees pitcher Wang Chien-min, Olympic taekwondo  gold medalist
Chen Shih-hsin and Liu Hsin-mei, winner of the world nine-ball
pool championship -- during his three-year tenure as the
college's president.
</P>
<P>
Chen lived up to his promise to resign from his post as the NCPFS
chairman in December 2006 if Taiwanese athletes failed to bring
home at least 15 gold medals from the Doha Asian Games. Taiwan
ended with just nine golds, 10 silvers and 27 bronzes.
