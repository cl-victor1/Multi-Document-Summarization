PRESIDENT TOUTS NEED TO FORM 'GLOBAL FORUM ON EMERGING
DEMOCRACIES'

President Chen Shui-bian said Thursday that the international
community needs to create a forum to help emerging democracies
tackle problems they face and disseminate democratic notions and
values to every corner of the planet.
</P>
<P>
Chen made the remarks while hosting a dinner at the Taipei Guest
House in honor of five former heads of state from Asia, Latin
America, Africa and Europe who have come to Taipei to attend a
conference Friday to enlist global support for his brainchild,
tentatively named the "Global Forum on Emerging Democracy."
</P>
<P>
Noting that the road from authoritarian rule to democracy is long
and arduous, Chen said that all the five former foreign
government leaders -- former South African President Frederik
Willem de Klerk, former South Korean President Kim Young Sam,
former El Salvador President Francisco Flores, former Polish
President Lech Walesa and former Mongolian President
Punsalmaagiyn Ochirbat -- have made extraordinary  contributions
to the  democratization  of their respective countries.
</P>
<P>
Like the five emerging third-wave democracies,  Chen said,
Taiwan's gradual advance toward democracy also started only
within the past two or three decades.
</P>
<P>
While all emerging democracies must bear the shock and turmoil
simultaneously engendered by the twin forces of democratization
and globalization,  Chen said, they tend to face similar problems
involving issues such as divisiveness over national and ethnic
identity, vicious rivalry of multiparty politics, difficulties in
promoting transitional justice, squabbling over the choice of a
constitutional  system,  and citizens'  weak  sense  of social
responsibility.
</P>
<P>
Stressing that such problems pose serious threats to budding
democracies and often become important factors leading to
reversal of democracy and revival of authoritarianism, Chen said
he feels the need to create a "Global Forum on New Democracies"
that will serve as a platform for dialogue and exchange.
</P>
<P>
Chen said his appeal has received a warm response from the five
outstanding politicians who had courageously led their people and
countries to move toward freedom and democracy.
</P>
<P>
The five former foreign government heads will join Chen at a
seminar Friday to recall travails and triumphs in their
countries' advance toward democracy and to solicit world support
for the establishment of the new forum.
</P>
<P>
"It is our earnest hope that forces throughout the world that
deeply care about the development of new democracies can be
united to facilitate the birth and growth of the new forum and
spread the seeds of democracy to every corner of the globe while
deepening the democratic system at home," Chen said.

<P>
Vice President Annette Lu, Premier Su Tseng-chang, Legislative
Yuan President Wang Jin-pyng and Examination Yuan President Yao
Chia-wen also attended the dinner party.
