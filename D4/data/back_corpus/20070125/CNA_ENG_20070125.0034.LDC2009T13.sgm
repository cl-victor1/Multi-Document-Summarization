KMT LAWMAKERS ATTACK DPP OVER KMT HEAD'S 'SPECIAL ALLOWANCE' CASE

Taipei,  Jan.  25 (CNA) 01/25/07  21:20:24 (By Flor Wang)

The main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) blasted the Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) Thursday for what it called "pressuring
prosecutors" over a case allegedly related to former Taipei Mayor
Ma Ying-jeou's special discretionary funds, accusing the ruling
party of meddling in the judiciary and acting as gangsters.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a news conference at the Legislative Yuan, a group of
KMT legislative  caucus members,  including KMT Central Policy
Committee Director Tseng Yung-chuan, asked prosecutors to
maintain neutrality in the case after a DPP lawmaker reportedly
claimed he would mobilize supporters to besiege the Taipei
Prosecutor's Office if Prosecutor Ho Kuan-jen fails to indict Ma
on embezzlement charges.
</P>
<P>
According to a local media report, the anti-corruption center
under the High Prosecutor's Office might conclude its probes into
Ma's alleged misue of his special mayoral allowances before
Chinese New Year, which falls on Feb. 18, prompting the DPP
lawmaker to mull the move.
</P>
<P>
Ma also serves as KMT chairman and is widely assumed to be the
opposition "pan- blue alliance's" best bet for the 2008
presidential election.
</P>
<P>
The KMT lawmakers condemned the DPP lawmaker's plan and described
it as "brazen interference in the judiciary." They accused the
DPP of seeking to play authoritarian tactics and argued that the
DPP is no better than a bunch of gangsters.
</P>
<P>
Should Ma be prosecuted, Vice President Annette Lu, as well as
former premiers Frank Hsieh and Yu Shyi-kun, should also be
indicted on the same charges, they claimed.
</P>
<P>
According to KMT lawmaker Lin Yu-fang, the DPP is publicly
stepping on the judiciary.
</P>
<P>
KMT lawmaker Wu Chih-yang said the DPP's performance so far has
fully displayed its hegemonic mindset and he urged the public to
rally behind the prosecutors and denounce political influence in
the judiciary.
