<P>
President Chen Shui-bian is very grateful for the Legislative
Yuan approving his nominee for the country's top prosecutorial
post in a vote Thursday, according to a spokesman for the
Presidential Office.
</P>
<P>
Lee Nan-yang, director of the Presidential Office's Department of
Public Affairs, said President Chen asked him to convey his
gratitude to all legislators  for their support  immediately
after the legislature approved the nomination of Chen Tsung-min
to serve as state public prosecutor-general.
</P>
<P>
The president also voiced the hope that with concerted efforts by
all sectors, Taiwan's judicial system will return to normality as
soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
The legislature voted on the appointment of Chen Tsung-min, the
chief prosecutor of the Kaohsiung Branch under the Taiwan High
Prosecutors Office, as the next state public prosecutor-general,
with more than half of the lawmakers present voting in favor of
the appointment.
</P>
<P>
A total of 126 legislators voted in support of the appointment of
Chen, while two voted against. There were a total of 87 invalid
votes.
</P>
<P>
The legislature rejected the first nominee, Hsieh Wen-ting,
currently chief of the Taiwan High Prosecutors Office, in a vote
held April 11. Hsieh failed to obtain the endorsement of half of
the legislators present, so the president had to name a new
candidate as Hsieh refused to be nominated a second time.
</P>
<P>
Under the newly revised Court Organic Law, the state public
prosecutor-general serves only a single four-year term. The new
measures are designed to enhance the democratic legitimacy and
independence of the prosecutorial system.
