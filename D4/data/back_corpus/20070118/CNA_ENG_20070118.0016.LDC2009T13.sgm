Palauan President Tommy Remengesau Jr. paid his own bill for a
health examination that was conducted in a Taipei hospital
Thursday,  Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesman Wang Chien-yeh
said later that day.
</P>
<P>
Discounting unfounded reports that questioned who would pay
Remengesau's hospital bill, Wang said the Foreign Ministry did
not foot the bill but only offered assistance in related
arrangements.
</P>
<P>
Wang pointed out that it is the Foreign Ministry's duty to offer
help to foreign heads of state during visits to Taiwan,
particularly over matters of which the country is proud, such as
its medical facilities.
</P>
<P>
He said Taiwan should offer every possible assistance to the
visiting Palauan president, who had expressed admiration for
Taiwan's medicare facilities by undergoing a health check here.
</P>
<P>
In fact, Wang added, Taiwan is proud not only of its medicare
standards at home but also for having dispatched numerous medical
missions to Africa,  Oceania and Latin America, where medical
resources are often insufficient. The Taiwan medical missions
have earned great respect and appreciation for their services
there, he said.

<P>
Remengesau, traveling at the head of a Palauan delegation,
arrived in Taiwan Tuesday for a five-day state visit.
