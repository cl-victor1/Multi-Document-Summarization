Government assistance for the financially troubled Asia Pacific
Broadband Telecom (APBT) will not lead to a takeover of the
company by the government, Cabinet spokesman Cheng Wen-tsang said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
He said the government was not planning to send a Taiwan Rail
Administration (TRA) representative to take the post of APBT
board chairman.  The TRA,  under the Ministry of Transportation
and Communication, is the biggest public sector shareholder of
APBT, holding around 12 percent.
</P>
<P>
TRA Director-General Chen Feng-nan said a day earlier that the
company will seek cooperation from other state shareholders and
creditor banks to choose a chairman.
</P>
<P>
APBT Chairwoman Chin Shih-ying has fled to the United States with
her husband Wang You-theng, founder of the APBT's parent Rebar
Asia Pacific Group, after a financial crisis and suspected
illegal activities of the group emerged. The pair have been
placed on Taiwan's most-wanted list and are accused of fraud,
insider trading and embezzlement.
</P>
<P>
The APBT board of directors and board of supervisors are
scheduled to convene an extraordinary session Friday.
Reorganization of the two bodies has been indicated by the
Ministry of Economic Affairs and the National Communications
Commission.
</P>
<P>
APBT Vice Chairman Wang Lin-tai held a news conference Thursday
and said the company will cooperate fully with the government in
order to ensure normal operation of the company and secure the
rights of shareholders and employees.
</P>
<P>
APBT, not listed, has capitalization of NT$65.68 billion and
employs 1,383 people.
