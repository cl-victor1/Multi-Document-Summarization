The Legislative Yuan gave the green light to President  Chen
Shui-bian's nominee for the nation's  top prosecutorial post in a
vote Thursday.
</P>
<P>
A total of 126 lawmakers voted for the appointment of Chen Tsung-
min, the chief prosecutor of the Kaohsiung Branch under the
Taiwan  High  Prosecutors  Office, as the next state  public
prosecutor-general, while two voted against the nomination. There
were a total of 87 invalid votes.
</P>
<P>
With Chen winning the endorsement of more than half of the
legislators present at the session, Legislative Speaker Wang Jin-
pyng formally  announced  that the nomination  was approved by
the legislature.
</P>
<P>
The legislature rejected the first nominee, Hsieh Wen-ting,
currently chief of the Taiwan High Prosecutors Office, in a vote
held April 11. Hsieh failed to obtain the endorsement of half of
the legislators present, so the president had to name a new
candidate as Hsieh refused to be nominated a second time.
</P>
<P>
The president used to have full authority to appoint a state
public prosecutor- general. However, under the newly revised
Court Organic  Law,  the  president's nomination  now requires
the legislature's approval. According to the law, an appointment
must be approved by half of the legislators present at a session,
with at least one-third  of lawmakers in the 221-seat legislature
in attendance for the vote.
</P>
<P>
Under the new law, the state public prosecutor-general serves
only a single four-year term. The new measures are designed to
enhance  the  democratic legitimacy  and independence  of the
prosecutorial system.
