A local magazine has launched a "happiness bankbook" drive aimed
at encouraging the public to share and spread happiness.

The Chinese-language Business Weekly said Wednesday that it has
invited 88 celebrities -- including business leaders, central and
local government heads, artists, singers, and writers -- to serve
as "happy ambassadors" for the drive.

In addition, the Taipei-based magazine has published a cover
story to explore the meaning of happiness as part of the drive,
which is being sponsored by Microsoft Taiwan Corp. and the Tainan
County government.

The magazine said that it will provide its subscribers of more
than five years with a "happiness bankbook" and ask them to jot
down how they share happiness with 20 friends or relatives in the
bankbook.

The lucky subscribers will have the chance to win prizes from the
magazine after signing on a designated Web site, the magazine
said.

The public can also join the drive by recording how they share
happiness with 20 of their loved ones in blogs, with the chance
of winning prizes at the Web site, according to the magazine.
