ACADEMIA SINICA DEVELOPS ONCOGENOMIC DATABASE ON LIVER CANCER
</HEADLINE>

The world's first oncogenomic database specifically designed for
hepatocellular carcinoma has been completed by research fellows
at Academia Sinica and the database -- OncoDB.HCC --   can   be
accessed   via   the   Internet   at
www.oncodb.hcc.ibms.sinica.edu.tw, academic sources said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Project manger Jou Yuh-shan, an associate research fellow at
Academia Sinica's Institute of Biomedical Sciences, said the
database is the first in the world dedicated to a single cancer
and that the accuracy when being applied to clinical cases is as
high as 96 percent.
</P>
<P>
Jou said the database can be very helpful in understanding gene
expressions and genetic mutations related to liver cancer, as
well as in terms  of the research and development  of biochips
for hepatocellular carcinoma.
</P>
<P>
In previous studies, the institute's researchers have targeted
614 oncogenes to liver cancer and the results have already been
put online as part of the database.
</P>
<P>
Currently, the database has integrated three different datasets
-- chromosome aberration studies, gene expression studies, and
hepatocellular carcinoma model organisms -- and can now be
accessed by three different search methods -- "chromosome region,
" "region around gene" and "rodent data."
