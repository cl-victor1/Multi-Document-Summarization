A group of Taiwanese mountaineers are scheduled to head for South
America Friday to scale Mount Aconcagua as part of their efforts
to challenge the world's Seven Summits, a group mountains
comprised of the highest peak on each of the seven continents.
</P>
<P>
Mt. Aconcagua, located in Argentina, has an elevation of 6,962
meters (22,841 feet), second only behind Mount Everest (8,848
meters) among the Seven Summits, which also include Mount
McKinley (6, 195m), in Alaska; Kilimanjaro (5,963m), in Tanzania;
Mount Elbrus (5,633m), in Russia; the Vinson Massif (4,897m) in
Antarctica; and the Carstensz Pyramid (4,884m) in Indonesia.

<P>
Speaking at a press conference prior to departure,  Huang Teh-
hsiung, a member of the "Seven Summit Expedition Team", said that
it is not technically difficult to conquer Aconcagua, but the
mountain climbers will have to overcome temperature and altitude
before reaching the top.

<P>
Huang, who successfully conquered Mt. Aconcagua for the first
time in 1988, further said that all members of the expedition
team have readied six types of medicine to prevent altitude
sickness, including Viagra, which has been found capable of
preventing high altitude pulmonary edema and lowering pulmonary
arterial pressure, in addition to curing impotence.
</P>
<P>
Among other members of the expedition team are Chen Chung-jen,
Hsieh Ying-su, Wu Yu-lung and Chiang Hsiu-chen. The team
successfully conquered Mt. Elbrus and Kilimanjaro last year.
