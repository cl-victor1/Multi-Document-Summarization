The number of migrant workers has broken the 340,000 mark, with
rapid increases in the numbers of foreign caregivers and family
helpers, the Council for Economic Planning and Development (CEPD)
said Friday.
</P>
<P>
As of the end of January, the number of migrant workers had
reached 341,871, marking an increase of 14,560 from the year-
earlier level.

<P>
The manufacturing industry remained the top employer of migrant
workers, with 179,002 or 50 percent of the total working in the
sector.
</P>
<P>
Foreign caregivers formed the second largest migrant worker
group, accounting for 153,396 or 44.9 percent of the total and
representing an increase of 9,337 from the same period of last
year.

<P>
The construction industry boasted the third largest migrant
workforce, with 11,782. Nevertheless, the number of migrant
workers in the sector has been on the decline since it reached a
peak of 45,446 in 1999.

Meanwhile, the number of foreign workers in the agricultural
sector stood at 3,356 at the end of January and the number of
family helpers or housemaids stood at 2,435, which marked a 1.7
percent rise from December 2006 -- the largest growth rate among
all employment categories for migrant workers.
