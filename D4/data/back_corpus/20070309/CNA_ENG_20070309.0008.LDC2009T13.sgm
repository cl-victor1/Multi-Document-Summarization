Taipei,  March 9 (CNA) 03/09/07  15:08:18 (By Deborah Kuo)

Premier Su Tseng-chang said Friday that whether Legislator Trong
Chai's serving as acting chairman of the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) during party chief Yu Shyi-kun's leave of
absence is legitimate or acceptable is an issue for the DPP
Central Standing Committee to handle.
</P>
<P>
Yu -- who on Thursday registered his candidacy for the party's
primary for the 2008 presidential election and announced his
leave of absence from March 8 through May 20 to devote all his
energy to the primary -- asked Chai to serve in his post during
this period.
</P>
<P>
Yu's action has stirred up discontent among a number of DPP
legislators, who criticized Yu for not respecting party
procedures and expressed concerns that Yu's move could undermine
the fairness of the DPP presidential primary.
</P>
<P>
On questions raised by reporters on Yu's asking Chai to serve as
acting DPP chairman without the consent of the party, Premier Su,
who also registered his candidacy for the DPP primary Thursday,
said that the issue should be tackled via a set party mechanism
and that hopefully it will be discussed by the DPP Central
Standing Committee sometime next week.
</P>
<P>
Su said he believes that Yu will be adroit and skillful enough to
follow the party norms to settle the matter.
</P>
<P>
"I don't believe anybody in the party is daring enough to violate
party rules," Su said.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, DPP Legislator Cheng Yun-peng urged Chai to resign
from the post of acting chairman immediately, saying that
assuming the job without the consent of the party has tarnished
the the DPP's image.
