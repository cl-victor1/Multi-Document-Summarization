MOFA, MAC CLARIFY PRESIDENT'S 'FOUR WANTS' REMARKS
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

Taipei,  March 9 (CNA) 03/09/07  20:06:01 (By Flor Wang)

President Chen Shui-bian's recent "four wants and one without"
remarks about Taiwan's sovereignty and cross-Taiwan Strait
relations are only meant to underscore Taiwan's distinct identity
and outline the country's future development direction, Vice
Minister of Foreign Affairs Katharine S. Y. Chang said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Chang made the comments at a breakfast gathering in response to
attacks by opposition Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU) lawmakers who
suspected that Chen aired such rhetoric to solicit voter support
as two key elections approach -- December's legislative polls and
the March 2008 presidential race.
</P>
<P>
TSU lawmakers, Lai Hsing-yuan, Yin Ling-ying and Liao Pen-yen,
said that Chen's rash speech has invited criticism from U.S.
academics, eroding Taiwan's image.
</P>
<P>
Chen proclaimed Sunday evening that Taiwan wants independence, a
change of the country's official designation, a new constitution
and development during a dinner banquet marking the 25th
anniversary of the Washington, D. C.-based Formosan Association
for Public Affairs (FAPA) dedicated to Taiwan's cause.
</P>
<P>
Arguing that Chen's "four wants" remarks are not contradictory to
his "four noes" pledge made in his 2000 and 2004 inauguration
speeches, Chang said that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs asked
its missions  overseas to immediately clarify the remarks to the
governments of their host countries after the president
proclaimed the "four wants and one without."
</P>
<P>
Speaking on the same occasion, Mainland Affairs Council Vice
Chairman Tung Cheng-yuan said that China's response to Chen's
"four wants" remarks has been "mild" and added that China might
deal with the matter "coolly" as Chen is to step down in a little
more than one year and the campaign for Taiwan's next presidency
is gathering steam.
</P>
<P>
The cross-strait situation has not deteriorated in recent days,
he said.
