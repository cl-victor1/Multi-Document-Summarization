Taipei, March 9 (CNA) 03/09/07  23:28:26 (By Sofia Wu)
</P>
<P>
The number of bullet train round trips will be increased to at
least 23 per day from March 31, with six foreign train drivers
scheduled to complete training March 20 and enter service by the
end of the month, a senior executive of the Taiwan High Speed
Rail Corp. (THSRC) said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Anticipating an increase in market demand during the upcoming
extended April 5 Tomb-Sweeping Day, THSRC Chief Executive Officer
Ou Chin-der said the company will simultaneously start to offer
many new ticket selling genres, including group tickets, package
tour tickets and business traveler tickets.  as well as providing
various discounts.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, telephone ticket booking will become available from
March 20, with booking hours from 9 a.m. through 9 p.m. every
day. Initially, passengers will only be able to pick up tickets
at bullet train stations, although ticket collection is expected
to also be available at convenience stores in two months.
</P>
<P>
According to Ou, ticket discounts will increase when the number
of daily bulltet train round trips expands to 60 or more per day.
</P>
<P>
The exact number of increased round trips from March 31 will be
announced after approval by the Ministry of Transportation and
Communications, Ou said.
</P>
<P>
He further said that as the company's 60 local train drivers will
complete their training courses in April, the number of daily
bullet train round trips will be further expanded in June.
</P>
<P>
The company now has 37 foreign train drivers and operates 19
round trips per day.
</P>
<P>
Commercial runs of the high speed railway were launched Jan. 5
between Taipei County's Banciao in the north and Zuoying,
Kaohsiung City in the south, marking the first export of Japan's
bullet train technology.
</P>
<P>
But the Taipei-Banciao section of the bullet train didn't go into
until March 2. The train has a top speed of 300 kilometers an
hour.
</P>
<P>
The government has high expectations about the economic benefits
of the bullet train service, which will cut three hours off the
previous four-and-a-half-hour train journey between Taipei and
Kaohsiung, the country's two largest cities.
</P>
<P>
The THSRC hopes to eventually run 88 round trips per day, with
the system capable of handling 100 million passengers a year.
</P>
<P>
The 345 km rail system will be managed by the THSRC for 35 years,
after which it will be turned over to state control under the
terms of the build-operate- transfer formula.
