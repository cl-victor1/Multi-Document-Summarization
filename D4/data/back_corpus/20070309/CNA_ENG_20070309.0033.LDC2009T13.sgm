Ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) Secretary-General Lin
Chia-lung called Friday for party members not to overreact to the
designation of Legislator Trong Chai by DPP Chairman Yu Shyi-kun
as the party's acting chairman, claiming that the designation
follows party precedent.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued Wednesday after registering his candidacy
for the DPP's presidential primary, Yu said he decided to take a
leave of absence from the DPP chairmanship from March 8 in order
to devote his full energy to running for the party's nomination
for the 2008 presidential election and that Chai will act for him
during his absence, which triggered a dispute among party
members.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the chairmanship is not vacant because Yu only asked
for a leave of absence, Lin said it is natural for Yu to
designate a substitute.
</P>
<P>
During his stint as DPP chairman, President Chen Shui-bian
designated then- Secretary-General Chang Chun-hsiung to preside
over the Central Standing Committee's meetings on his behalf
whenever he was unable to attend, while Yu has also asked Vice
President Annette Lu and former Premier Frank Hsieh to chair the
meeting for him, Lin explained.
</P>
<P>
As for several party members' remarks that if Chai becomes DPP
acting chairman, it will have an impact on the standing of the
party's nominees for legislators- at-large because Chai himself
is also vying for the nomination. Lin said the DPP's list of
nominees for legislators-at-large will not be available until
after the party nominates its candidate for the presidency and
candidates for the legislative election in mid-May.
</P>
<P>
Lin further said that Chai, a senior DPP member, is very familiar
with the party's operations and therefore well-suited to serve as
acting chairman.
