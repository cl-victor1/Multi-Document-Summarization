<P>
More than 2.6 million people have visited the Lantern Festival
exhibition in Kaohsiung since the event kicked off March 3,
according to statistics released Friday by the Kaohsiung city
government.
</P>
<P>
Officials at the city government's Economic Affairs Bureau
estimated that by the end of the event on March 11, more than 4
million people will have visited the nine-day exhibition.
</P>
<P>
They explained that the figure will be considerably smaller than
last year's 5.82 million, mainly because the 2006 Lantern
Festival exhibition lasted 18 days.
</P>
<P>
Kaohsiung's exhibition opened when President Chen Shui-bian
presided over a lighting ceremony on the banks of the city's Love
River March 3 on the eve of the "Year of the Pig" Lantern
Festival.
</P>
<P>
Six of Kaohsiung's sister cities -- Busan in South Korea,
Hachioji in Japan, and Portland, Macon, Colorado Springs, and San
Antonio in the United States -- have sent delegations to join a
series of celebrations in the southern Taiwan port city.
</P>
<P>
The 2007 Lantern Festival is also being celebrated in other
cities and counties of Taiwan, including Taipei, Taichung, Tainan
and Chiayi County. Most of these exhibitions will last until
March 11.

<P>
The lantern exhibition in Chiayi County, sponsored by the Tourism
Bureau under the Ministry of Transportation and Communications,
is the most extravagant event of all the celebrations, with the
centerpiece of the exhibition being a Taiwan boar standing
18-meters tall, weighing 20 metric tons and able to rotate 360
degrees.
</P>
<P>
The Chiayi county government has invited five foreign and 11
local troupes, along with street artists, to give daily
performances at the festival March 3-11. The performances will
include Indian music, Russian stunts, Taiwanese lion dances and
Beikuan music.
</P>
<P>
Chiayi County government officials estimate that the festival is
expected to attract more than 6 million visitors from both home
and abroad, provided a boost to the county's tourism industry.
