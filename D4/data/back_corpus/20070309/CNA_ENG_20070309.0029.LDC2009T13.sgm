Taipei,  March  9 (CNA) 03/09/07  20:09:30 (By Flor Wang)

Minister of National Defense Lee Jye expressed regret Friday
after being expelled from the main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) ,
but turned down an offer from a Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) lawmaker to join the ruling DPP.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the KMT's decision to suspend his party membership,
Lee said that "it will be the best for him to become free from
political affiliation in his task to make the military
politically neutral."
</P>
<P>
The KMT's Evaluation and Discipline Committee decided to revoke
Lee's membership earlier in the day on the grounds that Lee has
seriously tainted the KMT's reputation, eroded the military's
morale and political neutrality and stirred up social resentment
by agreeing with the Executive Yuan's decision to remove all
statues of the late President Chiang Kai-shek from military
facilities  around the country.
</P>
<P>
In an intepellation session at the Legislative Yuan later that
day, DPP lawmaker Hsueh Ling invited Lee to join the ruling
party, but he rejected her offer, saying that "it will be much
easier to serve in the post without any political affiliation."
</P>
<P>
Juan Kang-meng, director of the KMT's evaluation committee, said
Lee can apply for reinstatement of his party membership after one
year but will have to perform according to the KMT's expectations
if he wants his application for reinstatement to be successful.
