NO TIMETABLE SET FOR CKS MEMORIAL HALL NAME-CHANGE: OFFICIAL

Taipei,  March 9 (CNA) 03/09/07  16:23:31 (By Luis Huang)

<P>
No timetable has been set for renaming the Chiang Kai-shek
Memorial  Hall because  certain administrative procedures
required for the name-rectification have yet to be completed, an
official with the Ministry of Education (MOE) said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Chu Nan-hsien, director-general of the MOE's Department of Social
Education, made the remarks after the MOE and several other
government agencies adopted a resolution the day before to
degrade the memorial hall from the current third- level
administrative unit to the fourth level to match a planned change
of its name to "National Taiwan Democracy Memorial Hall."
</P>
<P>
For any third-level administrative unit under the Executive Yuan,
a set of "organic statutes" must be drafted and submitted to the
Legislative Yuan for approval,  while the establishment  of a
fourth-level unit is based upon "organizational  rules, " Chu
explained.
</P>
<P>
According to Chu, abolishing the existing "Organic Statutes for
Management of the Chiang Kai-shek Memorial Hall" must be approved
first by the MOE's Law and Regulation Commission (LRC) and then
by the Executive Yuan, which afterwards will ask for the
Legislative Yuan to nullify the statutes.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, an LRC official said that new organizational rules
governing the management of the "Taiwan Democracy Memorial Hall"
will come into force immediately after they are promulgated by
the Ministry of Education.
</P>
<P>
The ruling Democratic Progressive Party proposed that the name of
the Chiang Kai-shek Memorial Hall be changed to "Taiwan Democracy
Memorial Hall,  " in an effort to eliminate  symbols of the
authoritarianism associated with the late President Chiang Kai-
shek, considered a key perpetrator of the 228 Incident of 1947,
in which many elite members of local society were killed.
