The opposition Kuomintang (KMT) expelled Defense Minister Lee Jye
from the party Friday, ruling that Lee has seriously tarnished
the KMT's image by soiling the reputation of the late KMT
Chairman Chiang Kai-shek and undermining the political neutrality
of the military.

In a statement, the KMT Evaluation and Discipline Committee said
the party decided to repeal Lee's membership as punishment for
his aquiescence with the ruling Democratic Progressive Party's
plans to relocate or dismantle all statues of Chiang from
military barracks and remove the references to Chiang from
Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Lee's remarks recently made at the legislature that "he would
listen to whichever party become the ruling party" has seriously
undermined the spirit of political neutrality within the military
that the country has pursued -- remarks that prompted the KMT to
deal with Lee "squarely," the statement said.
