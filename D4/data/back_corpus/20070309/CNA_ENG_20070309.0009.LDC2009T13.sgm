President Chen Shui-bian Friday expressed hope that the annual
Taiwan International Orchid Show (TIOS) will become a platform
for sales of Taiwan- grown orchids to other countries around the
world.
</P>
<P>
Chen spoke of this expectation during his visit to the 2007
orchid exhibition held at the Taiwan Orchid Plantation, a biotech
park in Tainan County, southern Taiwan, as part of the local
government's drive to promote technological research and
development in orchid cultivation.

Chen visited the TIOS hours before its formal opening. Speaking
to the media at the venue, Chen said he is very excited to know
that the number of foreign visitors to the exhibition has been
doubling year over year since it was first opened at the park in
2005.
</P>
<P>
The boom is believed to be the best encouragement to local orchid
growers and relevant businesses, Chen said.
</P>
<P>
The TIOS, which runs through March 18, was co-sponsored by the
Tainan County government and the Taiwan External Trade
Development Council, a semi-official organization devoted in
foreign trade promotion.
</P>
<P>
According to county statistics, the orchid show received orders
worth NT$800 million (US$24.24 million) in 2005 and NT$1.3
billion in 2006. It has been predicted that orders will break the
NT$2 billion mark this year.
