Police recently raided a criminal ring in Taichung,  central
Taiwan,  arresting nine people suspected of obtaining money by
fraud, mostly from people living in China, announced the Criminal
Investigation Bureau (CIB) Friday
</P>
<P>
The criminal organization, which specialized in fraud, was headed
by a woman surnamed Hsieh who, together with her accomplices,
employed a self-developed "fishing" scheme aimed at Chinese
citizens living in inland regions, as well as major cities
including Beijing and Tienjing, according to the CIB.
</P>
<P>
The suspects were found to be based in the central county of
Taichung, from where they made a massive number of telephone
calls through Internet phone systems to mobile phone users in
China.
</P>
<P>
On the phone they portrayed themselves either as bank staffers or
police inspectors investigating credit card fraud in an attempt
to lure the person receiver the call to remit money to a dummy
bank account using an automated teller machine.
</P>
<P>
Since last July the fraud ring made more than 1 million phone
calls, thereby defrauding their victims of approximately NT$100
million (US$3 million) . The swindlers had also "laundered" the
money by wiring it back to Taiwan via an underground remittance
system, the CIB said.
</P>
<P>
The suspects have been sent to the Taipei District Prosecutors'
Office for trial on charges of fraud.
