TAIWAN ON PAR WITH OTHER COUNTRIES IN PACE OF WARMING: CWB
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  April  9 (CNA) 04/10/07  11:24:57 (By Sofia Wu)

<P>
Taiwan is on par with other countries around the world in terms
of warming, a senior official of the Central Weather Bureau (CWB)
said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Wu Teh-jung, director of the CWB's Weather Forecast Center, made
the remarks while delivering a report at the Legislative Yuan's
standing Committee on Science, Technology and Information.
</P>
<P>
During the session, lawmakers asked Wu's view on some media
reports claiming that Taiwan has outpaced the rest of the world
with climatic change causing its average temperature to rise at
double the global average in recent years.
</P>
<P>
In response, Wu said such reports are misleading. According to
Wu,  the global average temperature  incorporates  sea surface
temperatures, but rises in global surface temperatures more
double the overall average. Therefore, he said, Taiwan hasn't
surpassed any other country given its pace of warming.
</P>
<P>
On lawmakers' complaints that the CWB's weather forecasts were
not accurate enough, CWB Director-General Hsin Chiang-lin said
it's hard to achieve a 100 percent accuracy in weather
forecasting given the stochastic nature of temperature.
</P>
<P>
As a matter of fact, Hsin said the CWB has continue improving the
quality and accuracy of its weather forecasts in recent years.
The CWB no longer lags behind its counterparts in other countries
in typhoon forecasting, particularly regarding a typhoon's
course, Hsin said proudly, adding that the results of various
public opinion surveys showed that 80 percent of local residents
were satisfied with the CWB's round-the-clock weather forecasting
service.
</P>
<P>
While some people blamed the CWB for failing to forecast a squall
that struck certain parts of western Taiwan April 2, Hsin said it
is very difficult to forecast a squall the day before because
squalls tend to gather in just three to four hours.
</P>
<P>
A squall is a sudden, sharp increase in wind speed usually
associated with active weather, such as rain showers,
thunderstorms or heavy snow.
