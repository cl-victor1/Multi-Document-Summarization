Police in central Taiwan have impounded 500 pairs of name brand
shoes after searching a home in the Hsitun District of Taichung
city, a spokesman for the Criminal Investigation Bureau (CIB)
said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that the CIB's crime prevention center in
central Taiwan had received a tip in early April that students
hired by a counterfeit ring had been seen peddling fake Nike and
Adidas sports shoes in the night market outside Fengchia
University.
</P>
<P>
He said a student peddler would let would-be buyers go through a
catalogue of fake name brand shoes, and that once the customers
decided on the shoes they wanted, a runner would rush to a
distribution center by motorcycle to get the goods.
</P>
<P>
According to the spokesman, agents with the CIB's anti-crime
center in central Taiwan obtained a search warrant and raided a
distribution center quartered in a home Monday. They seized 500
pairs of fake shoes under six name brands: Nike, Adidas, Puma,
Gucci, Royal and New Balance.
</P>
<P>
The police have detained a student peddler, surnamed Lo, for
questioning and are trying to locate the leader of the
counterfeit ring.
