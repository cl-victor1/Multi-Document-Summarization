GRASS MOUNTAIN CHATEAU VERY LIKELY TARGET OF ARSON ATTACK
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  April  10 (CNA) 04/10/07  20:05:23 (By Elizabeth Hsu)

It is "very likely" that the historic Grass Mountain Chateau on
scenic Yangmingshan in suburban Taipei was destroyed by an arson
attack, Taipei Mayor Hau Lung-bin said Tuesday, adding that a
police task force will be formed to look into it.
</P>
<P>
Hau made the announcement after the City Fire Department came out
with a preliminary conclusion from its investigation into the
Friday night fire that gutted much of the 660-square-meter main
building of the chateau -- the first official residence of the
late Chiang Kai-shek in Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Hau indicated that investigators found a kind of accelerant at
the fire site and oil-stained residue outside the building. From
that evidence, experts concluded that fire was set to the house
from the outdoor dining area.
</P>
<P>
Fire Department officials said it is not usual to see a fire that
breaks out so quickly and violently damage more than half of the
structure, leaving the wooden interior completely consumed.
</P>
<P>
Hau would not offer any conjecture over the reasons why people
acted to damage the protected heritage site before police find
one. He stressed the chateau is not only a historic building, but
also a priceless cultural and tourist attraction.
</P>
<P>
A cultural spot is "innocent" in disputes over an historical
figure's conduct, the mayor said, noting the case has been listed
as a major criminal offense, and that those involved may face
punishment by imprisonment of 3 to 10 years.
</P>
<P>
The chateau was built in 1920 by Taiwan Sugar Corp.  in
preparation for a visit by then-Japanese Crown Prince Hirohito.
Historical records show that the prince stayed at the house for
only one hour and 50 minutes. Latter, the chateau was turned into
a spa villa for social celebrities during the period of Japanese
colonial rule.
</P>
<P>
In December 1949, the Republic of China seat of government moved
to Taipei and President Chiang chose to stay at the house until
May 1950 when a new residence was built in Taipei's Shihlin
district. The chateau later served as a summer villa for Chiang
and his wife.
</P>
<P>
The city government listed the house as a protected heritage site
in 2002.
