LAWMAKER DENOUNCES CHINESE OFFICIALS' PRESENCE IN TAIWAN GROUP
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  April 10 (CNA) 04/10/07  18:35:06 (By Elizabeth Hsu)

Legislator Huang Chao-hui of the ruling Democratic Progressive
Party (DPP) urged the government and Taiwanese business leaders
Tuesday "not to recognize, follow or participate in" a forming
federaton of Taiwanese businessmen's associations in China, and
to boycott the organization.
</P>
<P>
Huang made the call at a press conference at the Legislative Yuan
while suggesting businessmen operating in China withdraw their
investments back to Taiwan when Beijing shows reluctance to
protect their rights and interests. He denounced China's attempt
to ally with Taiwanese business people against Taiwan's
government by posting ranking officials in the planned business
group.
</P>
<P>
A formal ceremony marking the establishment of the controversial
federation is scheduled to be held April 15 in Beijing, with Chen
Yunlin, director of China's Taiwan Affairs Office of State
Council, to serve as honorary chairman of the new organization.
</P>
<P>
He Shizhong, director of the Chinese office's Economic Bureau,
will be the group's vice chairman and secretary-general, Huang
said, questioning the purpose of the two Chinese officials'
presence in an organization being formed to defend and safeguard
the right and interests of Taiwanese businessmen operating in
China.
</P>
<P>
Huang argued that while Taiwanese businessmen's associations
around China have been sparing no efforts to protect Taiwanese
interests on the mainland, the forming business federation is
"trapped  by Beijing's  'one China' scheme disguised  in the
federation's organic constitution' which stipulates the
leadership of the federation has to respect the "one China"
principle and advocate China's idea of unification.
</P>
<P>
Huang questioned how an organization founded for the purpose of
"national unification" will work to fight for Taiwanese business
people's rights and interests as China has never stopped trying
to annex Taiwan.
