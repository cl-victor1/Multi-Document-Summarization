KMT STRATEGIST PREDICTS UNEASY YEAR AHEAD
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  April 10 (CNA) 04/10/07  23:31:36 (By Maubo Chang)
</P>
<P>
Taiwan faces an uneasy year ahead in its relations with
Washington and Beijing, Chang Rung-kung, a Kuomintang strategist
warned Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
By naming former Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) Chairman Joseph
Wu as Taipei's representative to the United States and
nominatiing Chen Min-tung to fill the vacancy left by Wu at MAC,
Chang who serves as the deputy director of KMT Policy
Coordination Committee said President Chen is determined to push
for Taiwan's "de jure independence" and make it a center issue in
the 2008 presidential elections.
</P>
<P>
Noting that Joseph Wu is a supporter of Taiwan independence,
Chang said his appointment is a deviation from the country's
long-lasting tradition of having someone loyal to the Republic of
China to defend Taiwan's interest in Washington, and is sure to
aggravate Washington's concerns that Taiwan's movement toward
independence will strain ties with China.
</P>
<P>
Those concerns will inevitably undermine Taiwan's ties with the
United States, Chang warned.
</P>
<P>
By nominating Chen Min-tung, author of the so-called second
republic constitution for Taiwan, to be the MAC chief, Chang said
the president betrayed his intention to make constitution
rewriting an issue in his last year of office.
</P>
<P>
These appointments as well as the president's declaration March 4
that Taiwan wants independence and a new constitution, which
Chang claimed is the closest the president has ever gone to
formally declaring Taiwan's independence since taking office
seven years ago, highlight the president's campaign to push for
Taiwan's de jure independence and bode ill for the country's
future in the year ahead, Chang said.
