<P>
The National Communications Commission (NCC) will appeal against
the Executive Yuan's decision to sack two of its members, NCC
Vice Chairman Liu Tsung-teh said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Liu said the order issued by the Executive Yuan the previous day
has not yet been delivered to the NCC, however, the NCC believes
that the Executive Yuan has exceeded its power to order the sack
of two NCC members and thereby will not take the decision lying
down.
</P>
<P>
The two NCC members were sacked for using their relatives as
chauffeurs of their cars at the expense of the NCC.
