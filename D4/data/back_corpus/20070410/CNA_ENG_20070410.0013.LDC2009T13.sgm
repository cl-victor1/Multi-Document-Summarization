The late President Chiang Kai-shek's first official residence in
Taiwan, which was badly damaged in a fire late Friday night, will
be restored to its past glory within two years, Taipei City's
culture chief said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Lee Yung-ping, director of the Department of Cultural Affairs of
the Taipei City government, said an emergency response panel has
been formed in line with the cultural properties protection law
and other regulations to prepare for the restoration of the Grass
Mountain Chateau on scenic Yangmingshan in suburban Taipei.
</P>
<P>
According to an initial estimate, Lee said, the restoration
project will cost between NT$30 million (US$909,090) and NT$50
million.
</P>
<P>
She added that Lee Chung-yao, an authority in historical relics
and heritage site restoration, has agreed to take charge of the
Grass Mountain Chateau rehabilitation project.
</P>
<P>
The 83-year-old traditional architectural restoration master also
played a leading role in the chateau's first large-scale face-
lift a few years ago, Lee said.
</P>
<P>
The special panel is also composed  of legal experts and
specialists familiar with Japanese architectural styles and
features, Lee said, adding that she is confident that the
rehabilitation project will proceed smoothly and be successful in
fully restoring the building's charm and glory.
</P>
<P>
The style of the 660-square-meter main building, on an estate
covering  about 1,815 square meters,  is typical  of Japanese
architecture of the 1920s. The wall of the entrance to the main
building is made of stone, with Japanese wooden structure inside.
</P>
<P>
The fire destroyed more than half of the main building, with the
wooden interior being completely burnt. The stone wall remains
intact. Total damage is estimated at roughly NT$36 million
(US$1.09 million), Lee said.
</P>
<P>
The city government listed the building as a protected heritage
site in 2002, and it has since served as a cultural activity
center that encompasses an exhibition hall, a small-scale
showroom, a multifunctional auditorium, a performance area, a
semi-open air coffee shop, and a management center. The mid-
night fire damaged the exhibition hall, known as Meilu Hall, and
the coffee shop, known as Yingho Hall.
</P>
<P>
The city government commissioned the Buddhist Fo Kuang University
to manage the chateau in 2002, and the cooperation contract is
scheduled to expire at the end of June this year.
</P>
<P>
The chateau was built in 1920 by Taiwan Sugar Corp.  in
preparation for a visit by then-Japanese Crown Prince Hirohito.
Historical records show that Hirohito stayed at the house for
only one hour and 50 minutes. The chateau later served as a spa
villa for social celebrities during the period of Japanese
colonial rule.
</P>
<P>
In December 1949, the Republic of China government moved its seat
to Taipei, and President Chiang Kai-shek chose to stay at the
chateau,  making it Taiwan's first presidential residence. The
president and his wife lived at the house until May 1950 when a
new house was built in Taipei's Shihlin district. The chateau
later served as the first couple's summer villa.
