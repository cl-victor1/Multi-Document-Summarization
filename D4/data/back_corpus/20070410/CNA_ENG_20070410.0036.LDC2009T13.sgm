GOVERNMENT ACTIVATES MECHANISM TO ENSURE STABLE SUPPLY OF GRAVEL

Taipei,  April 10 (CNA) 04/10/07  20:48:27 (By Lilian Wu)

<P>
The government has activated a mechanism to ensure a steady
supply of sand and gravel on the market, the Public Construction
Commission of the Executive Yuan said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Commission officials said the Ministry of Justice has closely
monitored price fluctuations of gravel in the construction market
and acted severely in cases of hoarding.
</P>
<P>
The government also encourages imports from the Philippines to
help relieve the shortage of gravel resulting from China's export
ban of its sand and gravel, which came into effect March 1,
commission officials said.
</P>
<P>
Officials noted that the government knew last December that China
would soon ban its gravel exports. The Mainland Affairs Council,
the nation's top China policy charter, has commissioned the semi-
official Taiwan External Trade Development Council to discuss the
matter with China.
</P>
<P>
As construction companies complained that they could only manage
until the end of this month at most, and that "one fourth of
planned housing complexes cannot begin construction because of
the shortage of the main building material, " the government has
taken several measures to ensure a steady supply on a long-term
basis.
</P>
<P>
Those measures include assistance to construction companies to
import 3 million cubic meters of gravel from the Philippines and
coordinating with water resource officials to urgently increase
river dredging to supply an additional 4.5 million cubic meters
of gravel.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan began to import sand and gravel from China six years ago,
and until recently nearly one-third of its market needs were
filled by imports from China.
</P>
<P>
China's Ministry of Commerce and General Administration of
Customs announced in April 2006 that it would ban the export of
natural sand starting May 1, 2006, but postponed the date to
March 1 this year after Chinese suppliers asked for more time to
cushion the impact on their businesses.
</P>
<P>
The supply shortage has caused the prices of sand and gravel in
Taiwan to rise steadily in recent months, according to market
analysts.
