Taipei,  Jan. 20 (CNA) 01/20/07  18:20:04 (By Flor Wang)

President Chen Shui-bian urged Rebar Group Chairman Wang You-
theng, who is on the run in the United States after allegedly
embezzling corporate funds, to return to Taiwan and clear up the
mess he has made of his group.
</P>
<P>
Chen issued the call during a visit to a semiconductor firm in
the Hsinchu Science Park in northern Taiwan, accompanied by
Premier Su Tseng-chang, Minister of Economic Affairs Chen Ruey-
lung and ruling Democratic Progressive Party lawmaker Ker Chien-
ming.
</P>
<P>
Chen expressed worry that the Rebar case has dealt a heavy blow
to Taiwan's financial market order and has rocked the public's
confidence.
</P>
<P>
Saying that the government's financial reform drive has not
failed but is still in process, Chen added that business groups
also have to assume their share of social responsibility. He
urged Wang to return to Taiwan as soon as possible and deal with
his group's financial woes.
</P>
<P>
The president also instructed relevant government agencies to
help Rebar Group workers in need and provide the public with a
clear explanation of the Rebar case.
</P>
<P>
Wang and his wife Chin Shih-ying fled Taiwan Dec. 30 to the
United States via China Jan. 15 after a run broke out on the
Rebar-affiliated Chinese Bank early this month. Customers rushed
to the bank to withdraw their deposits following a bankruptcy
protection filed by two other Rebar subsidiaries.
