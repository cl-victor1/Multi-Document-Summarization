PRESIDENT CALLS FOR ACCEPTABLE CONCLUSION ON SANATORIUM DISPUTE
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taipei,  March 23 (CNA) 03/23/07  17:58:27 (By Deborah Kuo)
</P>
<P>
President Chen Shui-bian expressed hope Friday that controversies
surrounding the fate of the 77-year-old Losheng Sanatorium will
be resolved soon, or that, at a minimum, a resolution acceptable
to all parties concerned will be reached shortly.
</P>
<P>
Chen, who visited Losheng to offer an apology on behalf of the
government in 2004,  said Premier Su Tseng-chang  has already
instructed some officials to accelerate negotiations among
Losheng inhabitants, social activists who have been fighting for
the leprosy patients' rights, and the Taipei City Department of
Rapid Transit Systems in the hope that a mutually satisfactory
conclusion can soon be reached.
</P>
<P>
Chen made the remarks during a ceremony held at the Presidential
Office, where he conferred medals on 86-year-old American citizen
Ruth Duncan and her Taiwanese husband, Lin Cheng-hui, for their
unselfish long-term care to less- privileged groups in Taiwan,
such as leprosy patients, for nearly six decades.
</P>
<P>
The Losheng Sanatorium, a Japanese colonial building compound
located in Taipei County, is scheduled to be torn down in mid-
April to make way for the construction  of a greater Taipei metro
maintenance depot.
</P>
<P>
The Losheng inhabitants and Losheng Sanatorium preservationists
have staged numerous protests to prevent the eviction of
residents from the leprosarium and prevent the building compound,
which is considered by some activists as part of the nation's
cultural legacy, from being dismantled.
</P>
<P>
On the same day, Premier Su Tseng-chang said it is not too late
now to refocus on dialogue, adding that everybody expects that a
solution can be worked out that would preserve much of the
building compound while minimizing the impact on the construction
of the MRT maintenance depot.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a lawyer with the non-profit Legal Aid Foundation
approached the Taipei High Administration Court Friday to seek an
injunction against tearing down the Losheng Sanatorium, saying
that the foundation is willing to compensate those organizations
requiring compensation, if only the leprosarium's building
complex can be preserved.
</P>
<P>
Also on Friday, Lee Tien-pei, head of a Losheng Help-Self
Organization, urged the Legislative Yuan to pass quickly a draft
bill designed to compensate leprosy patients, protect their human
rights and preserve the sanatorium.
</P>
<P>
The leprosarium was built in 1930 by Japanese colonizers to
segregate and treat patients with Hansen's disease, and the
former Kuomintang administration in its early years in Taiwan
inherited the policy.  In later years,  patients were allowed to
leave the sanitarium, but many who lived in chronic isolation and
faced discrimination had little choice but to stay, and have long
since grown accustomed to the settings.
</P>
<P>
Forty-odd elderly patients still live in the compound and resist
the government's plan to relocate them to a nearby high-rise
hospital.
</P>
<P>
Preservationists have been advocating for the patients' right to
stay and say that as the only leper colony in Taiwan, and one of
a few still remaining around the world, the institution provides
living testimony to past indignities endured by the patients and
is thus of great historical and cultural value.
