The NGO Taiwan Fund for Children and Families (TFCF) is seeking
sponsors to financially support Mongolian children from poor
families.
</P>
<P>
TFCF Executive Director Wang Ming-jen said since the foundation
established a TFCF branch in Ulan Bator two years ago,  the
organization has sponsored over 3,200 Mongolian children.

<P>
The growing list of Mongolian recipients of aid has prompted the
foundation to seek more Taiwan sponsors, hopefully 2,000 in a
short period of time, to take part in the program, Wang said.
</P>
<P>
Sponsors need only provide NT$700 (US$21.2) per month to help one
Mongolian child, Wang said, adding that the NT$700 will allow the
parents of the Mongolian child to buy a sufficient amount of rice
and lamb -- staples of the Mongolian diet -- as well as coal for
cold winter days, which extends for eight months a year in the
north Asian country.
</P>
<P>
Many Mongolian children have benefited from the program, Wang
said, citing the example of an 11-year-old boy who has bought a
new school jacket with money provided by his sponsor. The boy
cherishes the jacket so much that he wraps it in cloth every
night after wearing it. He also washes it carefully by himself
during holidays for fear that his mother may damage it, according
to Wang.
</P>
<P>
The TFCF -- the Taiwan version of the U.S. Christian Children's
Fund and a member of the International Union for Child -- is
currently sponsoring 33,000 children from poor families in 30
countries and areas around the world, according to Wang.
