Vice President Annette Lu and Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-
pyng co-chaired a ceremony Friday marking the start of a
benevolent program for poor school children at the Presidential
Office.

<P>
Speaking on the occasion, Lu said that it is extremely important
to take care of the needs of Taiwan's youngsters and build a
positive learning environment for them.
</P>
<P>
"The younger generation's happiness is far more important than my
personal career when it comes to whether or not I could succeed
in my presidential bid, although I have registered with the
Democratic Progressive Party to take part in the presidential
primaries, " Lu said.
</P>
<P>
The vice president also called on more private companies to join
forces with her to help bail out poor school kids, and thanked
Advanced Semiconductor Corp and Compal Electronics Corp. for
their ongoing donations -- NT$10 million each per year.
</P>
<P>
Lu initiated the program last year and invited Wang and the
business community to jointly promote the program aimed at
providing after-school assistance to children from
underprivileged families across the country.
</P>
<P>
The program aims to offer 1,000 after-school classes nationwide,
with at least one class in each village or township.
</P>
<P>
Up to now, a total of 134 after-school classes have been opened
around  Taiwan, offering  scholastic  assistance  to  2,621
underprivileged children.
</P>
<P>
Wang voiced his admiration for Lu's endeavor in carrying out the
program and said that he is more than willing to continue
cooperating with Lu in the future.
