Former Kuomintang (KMT) acting Chairman Wu Poh-hsiung and
Legislator Hung Hsiu- chu became officially eligible Friday to
compete in the party's by-election for chairmanship after a KMT
screening panel approved their qualifications.
</P>
<P>
KMT Secretary-General Wu Duen-yih made the announcement after
panel members gave their go-ahead in a screening meeting earlier
the same day for the two to take part in the April 7 by-election
for the party's top post.
</P>
<P>
Wu, who quit as acting chairman last week to fully dedicate
himself to the by- election, promised to do his utmost if elected
KMT chief, although he acknowledged that it would be a very
difficult task.
</P>
<P>
For her part, Hung expressed her hope that the KMT could
transform into an open, broad-minded and democratic political
party.
</P>
<P>
Hung expressed her hope of being able to write a glorious page
for the KMT's history through a fair competition between Wu and
herself.
</P>
<P>
Former KMT Chairman Ma Ying-jeou resigned from the top post in
February after he was indicted by Taipei prosecutors on
corruption charges over allegedly embezzling  a special monthly
municipal allowance during his two mayoral terms from 1998-2006.
</P>
<P>
At the same time Ma announced his presidential bid and vowed to
win back power for the KMT in the March 2008 presidential race.
