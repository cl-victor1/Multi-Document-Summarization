NEW ENVOY TO UNITED STATES WILL FACE TOUGH CHALLENGES: FAPA
</HEADLINE>

Washington,  March 19 (CNA) 03/19/07  18:10:20 (By Jorge Liu and

<P>
Mainland Affairs Council Chairman Joseph Wu, who has been
appointed representative to the United States, will face tough
challenges in his new post, an official of a pro-Taiwan
independence group said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Chen Wen-yen, executive director of the Washington-based Formosan
Association for Public Affairs (FAPA) , noted that China has
risen rapidly recently and that its clout in the international
community has increased.
</P>
<P>
This, coupled with the U.S. solicitation of China's cooperation
or assistance on such issues as North Korea, Iraq and Africa, has
made Taiwan's representative office to the United States face an
even greater challenge, Chen said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) has ruled
the nation for seven years and that this is the first time that
it has been able to send an envoy that it has nurtured to the
United States.
</P>
<P>
He welcomed Wu to the United States, describing him as competent
and well-versed in cross-strait affairs and with experience in
dealing with the U.S. government.
</P>
<P>
He also praised outgoing U.S. Representative David Ta-wei Lee,
saying that although he belongs to the opposition Kuomintang, he
has acted without any party affiliation in exercising his duty
and has done his best to safeguard Taiwan's interests.
</P>
<P>
Lee's performance will be up for the Presidential Office and the
Ministry of Foreign Affairs to judge, Chen said, adding however
that the U.S. government, think tanks and Taiwanese expatriates
have spoken highly of him.
</P>
<P>
Lee and his predecessor Chen Chien-jen are professional career
diplomats.
