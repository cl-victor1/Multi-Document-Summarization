A new cruise boat named Queen of the Great River and built for
sightseeing tours on the Danshui river in northern Taiwan is
ready for delivery to its owner, with a launch ceremony scheduled
to take place in southern Taiwan's Kaohsiung Harbor March 21.

The 500-ton boat, built by San Yang Shipbuilding Co. and carrying
a price tag of NT$150 million, will be turned over to the Great
River Tourism Co., which will use the boat to operate cruise
tours on the Danshui river.

Measuring 40.5 meters long and 10 meters wide, with a maximum
designed speed of 12 knots, the boat can accommodate up to 300
passengers.

A spokeswoman for the company told CNA in a telephone interview
that the boat will join the company's boat tour operations in
early May.

She said that a two-hour boat ride will cost NT$1,500 per head on
weekdays and NT$1,800 on holidays, and that a discount will be
allowed for children and people over 65. The price will cover
food and drinks consumed on the boat.

The spokeswoman also said the Sheraton Taipei Hotel -- noted for
its gourmet cooking -- has agreed to provide chefs to prepare
food and delicacies for lunch and dinner during the boat tours,
so that passengers can enjoy delicious meals while listening to
live music and enjoying the views along the river.

She added that in addition to lunch, afternoon tea and dinner
cruises, there will be a narrated sightseeing tour every morning
to let students and social groups understand the history and
unique ecology of the river.
