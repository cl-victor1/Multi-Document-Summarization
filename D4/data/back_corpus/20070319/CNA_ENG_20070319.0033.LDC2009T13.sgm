KMT LAWMAKERS BLAST APPOINTMENT OF NEW REP TO U.S.

Taipei,  March 19 (CNA) 03/19/07  20:22:33 (By Flor Wang)

The main opposition Kuomintang's (KMT's) legislative  caucus
blasted  Monday President  Chen Shui-bian's appointment of one of
his proteges to serve as new representative to the United States,
claiming that Chen's use of his power marks a setback to Taiwan's
democracy.
</P>
<P>
The group of KMT lawmakers, including legislative caucus whip Lo
Shih-hsiung and lawmakers Su Chi, John Chiang, Shuai Hua-ming and
Ting Shou-chung, made the comments at a Legislative Yuan news
conference after it was reported a day earlier that Mainland
Affairs Council (MAC) Chairman Joseph Wu has been tapped to serve
as Taiwan's top liaison official to the United States, taking
over the post from the outgoing Representative David Ta-wei Lee.
</P>
<P>
Lo claimed that Wu's removal from the MAC's top post is aimed at
blocking ongoing Taiwan-China negotiations on the establishment
of direct cross-Taiwan Strait transport links and on Taiwan's
full opening to Chinese tourists.
</P>
<P>
According to Lo, the prime purpose of Wu's appointment as the top
representative to the United States is to "sell" Chen's "four
wants" remarks to Washington.
</P>
<P>
Lo said he is deeply concerned that the representative office in
the United States will soon become no more than a "lobby center"
for Taiwan independence, which might cause cross-Taiwan Strait
relations to deteriorate but will help solicit pro-independence
votes for the December's legislative elections and the March 2008
presidential contest.
</P>
<P>
Pointing out that Wu is not a professional diplomat, Chiang said
that he does not expect an improvement in bilateral relations as
a result of Wu's appointment.
</P>
<P>
For his part, Su voiced grave concern that Taiwan's democratic
and civil service systems have been seriously undercut by Chen's
appointments of many ranking officials and military chiefs over
the past seven years to extend his grip on power on the military
and diplomatic fronts.
</P>
<P>
Chen has promoted 24 officers to the rank of general and many
designations of ranking government appointees have been his
cronies, Su said, adding that Chen's firm grip on military and
diplomatic power represents a major setback for the country and
its democratic system.
</P>
<P>
Shuai accused Chen of having shaken the military's system by
promoting the record high of 24 generals, who have served less
than 15 months in their posts on average -- something that puts
national security at grave risk and has damaged the
professionalism of the military.
