'FOUR WANTS' REMAINS LIVE ISSUE IN TAIWAN-U.S. TIES: OUTGOING
ENVOY
</HEADLINE>

Washington, March 18 (CNA) 03/19/07  12:47:54 (By Jorge Liu,
Chiehyu Lin and Sofia Wu)
</P>
<P>
The "four wants, one without" doctrine recently touted by
President Chen Shui- bian remains an issue of concern between
Taiwan and the United States, the outgoing Taiwan representative
to Washington, D.C. said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
David Ta-wei Lee made the remarks prior to his departure for
Dallas, Texas to accompany Foreign Affairs Minister James Huang
in attending a board meeting of the World Federation of Taiwanese
Chambers of Commerce.
</P>
<P>
Lee, a career diplomat of the opposition Kuomintang, confirmed
that Taiwan's top China policy planner -- Mainland Affairs
Council Chairman Joseph Wu -- will soon replace him as Taiwan's
top representative to the United States and that he himself will
be transferred to serve as the country's representative to
neighboring Canada.
</P>
<P>
Noting that Wu has participated in the formulation of Taiwan's
policy toward China, Lee said it is befitting to get Wu to
communicate with the U.S. administration about the "four wants,
one without" doctrine.
</P>
<P>
Wu, who has a doctoral degree in political science from Ohio
State University, will be the first politician from the ruling
Democratic  Progressive  Party (DPP)  to  serve  as  Taiwan's
representative to the United States.
</P>
<P>
According to Lee, Wu is scheduled to assume his new post around
April 10. Lee himself is also scheduled to fly directly to Ottawa
from Washington, D.C. around April 10 to take up his new post.
</P>
<P>
As Wu is known to be well-versed in Taiwan-U.S. affairs, Lee
said, the U.S. government gave a positive response when he
informed it of the Taiwan government's plan to replace him with
Wu earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
"The process of conveying our government's personnel reshuffle
plan to the U.S. authorities proceeded pretty smoothly. The U.S.
administration welcomed Wu's appointment in the first place, "
Lee recalled, adding that "the new personnel arrangements are
good to both our government and myself."
</P>
<P>
During his brief news conference at Ronald Reagan Washington
National Airport, Taiwan journalists asked Lee what the first and
foremost mission Wu may face upon assuming office and whether the
"four wants, one without" controversy remains alive and
developing.
</P>
<P>
The "four wants, one without" refers to President Chen's March 4
statement that Taiwan wants "independence, a new constitution,
further development and a change of its official name" and that
there will be no polarization in local society.
</P>
<P>
Lee said the "four wants" doctrine indeed remains an issue in
Taiwan-U.S. engagement. "Given his role in Taiwan's cross-strait
policy formulation, Wu will do a good job in communicating with
U.S. authorities about this issue," he added.
</P>
<P>
In his view, Lee continued, Taiwan-U.S. relations are very
complicated and encompass a wide range of issues. As Wu has made
frequent visits to the United States during his stints as deputy
chief of staff to President Chen and as the MAC chief to meet
with U.S. officials and think tank scholars on the DPP
administration's major policy initiatives, Lee said Wu will be
able to take up his new job in stride.
</P>
<P>
Reviewing his stint as Taiwan's top envoy stationed in the U.S.
capital, Lee said he has largely fulfilled one of his two major
work goals -- strengthening communications between the executive
branches of the two countries.
</P>
<P>
As to the other goal -- beefing up mutual trust between Taiwan
and U.S. authorities, Lee conceded that even though he has pulled
out all the stops to work for this end during his 32-month
tenure, there is still ample room to improve in this regard. "It
is hoped that my successor will continue working hard for this
goal," he added.
</P>
<P>
Touching on his new job, Lee said he is no stranger to Taiwan-
Canadian affairs. In 1990, Lee recalled that he accompanied the
then-head of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' Department of North
American Affairs to conduct four rounds of negotiations with
Canada on the exchange of representative offices between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
"After a 20-year hiatus, Taiwan and Canada finally agreed in that
year to exchange representative offices to facilitate development
of substantive relations in the absence of formal diplomatic
ties, " Lee recalled. Canada switched diplomatic recognition from
Taipei to Beijing in 1970.
</P>
<P>
Lee continued his involvement in affairs with Canada during his
tenure as deputy director and later as director of the ministry's
North American Affairs Department. Given all these experiences,
Lee said confidently that he will be able to "do something" for
the country after taking up his new assignment.
