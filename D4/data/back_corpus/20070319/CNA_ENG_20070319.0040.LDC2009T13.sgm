COA TO MONITOR PORK PRICES: CHIEF
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taipei,  March 19 (CNA) 03/19/07  21:36:47 (By Flor Wang)

<P>
The Cabinet-level Council of Agriculture (COA) will take measures
to monitor hog production and set up a monitoring system to
maintain stable pork prices, COA Chairman Su Jia-quan said
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Su made the comments during a legislative session while answering
questions from independent Legislator Chang Li-shan, who inquired
about the government's countermeasures to tackle dwindling pork
prices over the past eight months.
</P>
<P>
Noting  that  the  hog  industry  has encountered  certain
"irresistible" elements over the past eight months,  such as
astounding surges in corn prices and the problem of substandard
pork found in the domestic market, Su said that the COA has
assisted hog farmers in controlling the number of animals raised
and set up a price stabilization fund to maintain pork prices
above NT$45 per kilogram.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile,  Kaohsiung County's agricultural and farm bureau
officials opined that pork prices will soon rebound in mid-June
as the number of pigs being raised across Taiwan has dropped.
</P>
<P>
Citing the results of an investigation conducted last November,
officials reported that the number of pigs being raised by
Taiwanese farmers declined to 7.09 million, down by about 130,000
from last May. The number of hog farmers also decreased by over
360 to 12,600 during the same time.
</P>
<P>
Affected by a glut of hogs, wholesale pork is currently fetching
NT$4,300 or NT$4,400 per 100 kilograms: lower than the average
production cost, which is NT$5,000 per each 100 kilograms.
</P>
<P>
Provincial central farming and distribution authorities are
slated to sponsor 10 rounds of promotional activities around the
country beginning April 1 to help boost the price of pork, the
officials said, adding that the first event will be held in
Kaohsiung County.
