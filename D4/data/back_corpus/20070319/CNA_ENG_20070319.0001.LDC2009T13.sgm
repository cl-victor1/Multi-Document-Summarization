Taipei,  March 18 (CNA) 03/19/07  10:53:59 (By Sofia Wu)

<P>
Mainland Affairs Council Chairman (MAC) Joseph Wu, who has been
tapped as Taiwan's new representative to the United States, said
Sunday he will go for broke to quickly get into the swing of
diplomatic job after assuming his new post.
</P>
<P>
Wu made the remarks while briefing the media on the backgrounds
of his upcoming job transfer and his future work agenda nad major
goals.
</P>
<P>
Before meeting with the media over a cup of tea, Wu said he had
phoned the top U.S. representative in Taiwan -- Stephen Young,
director of the American Institute in Taiwan Taipei Office -- to
make sure Washington's stance on his new assignment.
</P>
<P>
Wu, a political scientist with a doctorate from Ohio State
University in the United States, will be the first official from
the ruling Democratic Progressive Party to serve as the country's
top representative to the U.S. since the party took power in
2000.
</P>
<P>
According to Wu, President Chen Shui-bian invited him to the
Presidential Office Feb. 15 to inquire about his interest in
serving as the country's representative to the United States,
Taiwan's most important ally.
</P>
<P>
"It's a great job for me. After overnight consideration, I
informed the president of my decision to take on the new
assignment the following day, " Wu recalled, adding that he made
the decision based on his conviction that if the country needs
his service, he should never dodge or flinch from his duty.
</P>
<P>
As Wu once served as presidential deputy chief of staff in charge
of international affairs, Wu said it won't be a problem for him
to grasp President Chen's political notions and doctrines.
</P>
<P>
For the past three years, Wu is the country top China policy
planner.
</P>
<P>
"During my stint at the MAC, I have noticed China's growing clout
in the South Pacific, Southeast Asia, Africa and Latin America,"
Wu said, adding that many democratic countries have also agreed
that China's economic and political strength have grown
substantially.
</P>
<P>
Against this backdrop, Wu said Taiwan is facing a new situation
far different from the past. "And I'm convinced that my work
experience at the MAC would be conducive to my new job.
</P>
<P>
After taking up his new post, Wu said he will help the United
States get a better understanding  of Taiwan's  policy toward
cross-Taiwan Strait relations.
</P>
<P>
"I'll brief American officials on the most important parts of the
MAC work as well as our fundamental stance and policy on cross-
strait relations," Wu added.
</P>
<P>
While  opposition  politicians  tend  to brand  him  as a pro-
independence activist or even a diehard fundamentalist, Wu said
such a judgment is biased.
</P>
<P>
"My work achievements as the MAC chief, including a cross-strait
agreement reached last June on the opening of four categories of
direct cross-strait flight services, are telling proof that I'm a
pragmatist," Wu said, adding: "To me, only Taiwan's interest
counts. I'll go for broke for whatever is in Taiwan's interest."
</P>
<P>
As the MAC chief, Wu said he has visited the United States many
times. "I have met with U.S. officials during my every visit. I
have had no problems with communicating with them, " Wu said,
adding that he believes he can easily win U.S. trust after taking
up his new post.
</P>
<P>
Wu will replace David Ta-wei Lee, a career diplomat from the
opposition Kuomintang who will take over as Taiwan's
representative to Canada after ending his U.S. stint.
