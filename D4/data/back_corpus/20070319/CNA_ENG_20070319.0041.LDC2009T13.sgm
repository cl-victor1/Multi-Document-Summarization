The wife of an entrepreneur in central Taiwan and her friends
presented NT$1.05 million to the Taiwan Fund for Children and
Families Monday,  asking that the charitable organization use the
money to build drinking water facilities for children in
Mongolia.

Wang Ming-jen, executive director of the fund, said that his
organization had received the donation from Shih Shu-mei, whose
husband Lin Chang-chou is the owner of a reputed pharmaceutical
enterprise.

According to Wang, Shih, encouraged by her husband, invited her
friends -- mostly wives of industrialists -- to extend a helping
hand after learning from workers at the Taiwan Fund for Children
and Families that many children were living in such poor
conditions that they did not even have clean drinking water.

Wang said the housewives pooled their money and made the NT$1.05
donation to the Fund, asking that the money be used to improve
the health of poor children in Mongolia's remote areas.
