Taipei,  March  19  (CNA) 03/19/07  16:01:35 (By Flor Wang)

The appointment of Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) Chairman Joseph
Wu as Taiwan's top liaison official in the United States is
designed to help Washington better understand Taiwan's position,
lawmakers of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) said
Monday.
</P>
<P>
DPP legislative caucus whip Wang Hsing-nan and lawmaker Hsiao Bi-
khim made the comments at a Legislative Yuan news conference.
</P>
<P>
Wang hailed the efforts and work of outgoing Representative David
Ta-wei Lee during his stint in the United States that began in
2004, but urged the public not to view Wu's replacement of Lee as
an attempt by the government to purge Taiwan of the influence of
the opposition "pan-blue alliance" or of the late President
Chiang Kai-shek.
</P>
<P>
According to Wang, the adjustment is necessary because it is
tremendously important to have someone who is fully aware of the
DPP's core philosophy and who fully represents a Taiwanese regime
serving as Taiwan's representative to the United States during
the remaining year of President Chen Shui-bian's second four-year
term.
</P>
<P>
"Doing so will help the United States gain a better understanding
of Taiwan's thinking, " Wang said, claiming that "although Lee
has done his best, he sometimes missed the key point and the
government is somewhat concerned about this."
</P>
<P>
But he argued that this is not a move aimed at getting rid of Lee
and said that such rhetoric is very unfair to Lee.
</P>
<P>
Lee, a professional career diplomat, is a member of the main
opposition Kuomintang (KMT). He will take over as top
representative to Canada.
</P>
<P>
Hsiao praised Wu as the best choice for Taiwan's de-facto
ambassadorial post in the United States and said that he is
capable of bolstering mutual understanding and communication.
</P>
<P>
Wu can help bring greater vigor and creative ideas out of the box
and honestly reflect the Taiwan government's viewpoint to the
U.S. authorities, according to Hsiao.
