Taipei,  Oct.  29 (CNA) (By Sofia Wu)

<P>
None of the 50 influenza cases that meet the requirements for avian
flu testing were tested H5N1 positive, the Center for Disease Control
(CDC) under the Department of Health said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
CDC Deputy Director Lin Ting said the CDC's Kunyang laboratory and its
12 contract laboratories have established a speedy screening and
testing system that can complete initial testing in three hours to
determine whether a suspicious case belongs avian flu infections.
</P>
<P>
According to Lin, local medical institutions have been required to
send specimens to the above-mentioned laboratories whenever they treat
patients showing respiratory symptoms or high fever or having visited
avian flu-affected areas or having come into contacts with birds or
poultry.
</P>
<P>
"So far, 50 suspicious cases have been collected and none of them were
tested avian flu positive, " Lin said, adding that Taiwan now
maintains its avian flu-free status, with none of humans and animals
on its territory have infected the virus.
</P>
<P>
Avian flu is a highly infectious virus among both wild and domestic
birds. H5N1 is the most virulent strain of bird flu and has killed
more than 60 people in Asia since 2003. Experts are closely watching
the disease for fear that it could mutate into a form easily
transmitted among humans and cause a pandemic that could kill
millions. Taiwan's quarantine and public health agencies have been on
full alert against the disease.
