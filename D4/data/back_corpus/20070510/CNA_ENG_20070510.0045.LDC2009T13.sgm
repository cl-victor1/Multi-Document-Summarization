The nation's top economic policy planner said Thursday that the
local tourism industry's quality of service requires improvement.
</P>
<P>
Ho Mei-yueh, chairwoman of the Council for Economic Planning and
Development, noted that there were 3.52 million foreign visitors
last year, compared with 8.67 million outbound tourists. The fact
that outbound tourists far outnumbered inbound tourists shows
that there is ample room for improvement in the quality of
service offered in Taiwan's tourism sector.
</P>
<P>
She also said that local people made around 100 million visits to
scenic destinations around Taiwan last year.
</P>
<P>
Tourists are mostly drawn from the middle-class, and were
generally unsatisfied with ticket prices, transportation and
hygienic facilities, as well as the general level of convenience
experienced at scenic destinations.
</P>
<P>
Ho also said that international tourism has grown steadily over
the past decade and that the Asia-Pacific region has recorded
some of the most rapid growth in international tourist visits,
rising between 7.6 percent and 8 percent over the past three
years, next only to Africa.
</P>
<P>
Ho made the remarks while delivering a speech on the development
and strategic outlook of Taiwan tourism at Leader University in
Tainan, southern Taiwan.
