The Taiwan High Speed Rail Corp. (THSR) will start running six
more trains in addition to its existing 25 one-way trains daily
and will shorten the running time of trains from June 1, High
Speed Rail Bureau Chief Pang Chia-hua said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The increase in the number and speed of runs in June is the
second adjustment by the THSR after an earlier adjustment made in
late March, Pang said, adding that the Ministry of Transportation
and Communications might approve the new schedule this week.
</P>
<P>
Most of the additional six trains will be scheduled for non-rush
hours for balanced operation.
</P>
<P>
According  to Pang,  the running  time of trains  on the Taipei-
Kaohsiung route with only one stop in Taichung will be shortened
from 100 minutes to 96 minutes. Trains that stop at every station
between Taipei and Kaohsiung will have their running times
shortened from 130 minutes to 120 minutes.

<P>
Departure times will also be adjusted, Pang said. Trains will
depart from Taipei on the hour, with departure time of the first
train from Taipei changed from 6:50 a.m. to 7 a.m.
</P>
<P>
Pang said there might be a third adjustment in July and a fourth
in September to give a total of 61 trains. When 88 trains are
running, the THSR will run non- stop trains between Taipei and
Kaohsiung with running times of only 90 minutes.
