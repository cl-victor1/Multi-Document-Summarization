Former President Lee Teng-hui is scheduled to travel to Japan in
early June to receive a prize marking the 150th anniversary of
the birth of the late Japanese colonial administrator Shinpei
Goto, according to Lee Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Lee said he is honored to be awarded the Shinpei Goto Prize by
the Shinpei Goto Society of Tokyo, and his health leaves him
perfectly able to make the trip to Japan.
</P>
<P>
Lee said he plans to arrive in Tokyo in early June for a 10-day
visit, which will mark his first visit to the Japanese capital
since the end of World War II.
</P>
<P>
He will deliver a speech upon receiving the prize at the
presentation ceremony.
</P>
<P>
Members of the Shinpei Goto Society said President Lee was
selected as one of the recipients of the First Shinpei Goto prize
on the grounds that he had fully displayed the philosophy and
spirit of "Gotoism" during his time as Taipei mayor and president
of the Republic of China on Taiwan, as demonstrated in Lee's
extraordinary contributions to Taiwan's modernization.
</P>
<P>
Lee is also expected to give a speech at Akita International
University and visit Takushoku University.
</P>
<P>
Lee had planned to visit Japan in September 2006, but that trip
was canceled due to health concerns.
</P>
<P>
After his retirement, the former president first visited Okayama
Prefecture in April 2001 to receive treatment for heart disease,
and made a second trip December 2004 - January 2005 to visit
several Japanese cities, including Nagoya and Kyoto.
