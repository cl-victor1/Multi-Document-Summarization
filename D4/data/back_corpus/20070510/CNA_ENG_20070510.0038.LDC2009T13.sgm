Taipei,  May 10 (CNA) 05/10/07  21:41:33 (By Luis Huang)

The National Immigration Agency (NIA) under the Ministry of the
Interior announced Thursday that it will issue forgery-proof
smart alien resident certificates in two stages, beginning in
July this year, to satisfy anti- counterfeiting and anti-terror
requirements.
</P>
<P>
An NIA official said that during the July 1-Dec. 31 period,
forgery-proof integrated circuit (IC) alien resident cards will
be issued to those applying for alien resident cards and
permanent resident cards.
</P>
<P>
The official further said that current paper alien resident
cards, permanent resident cards, and Taiwan area resident cards
will all be replaced by new IC resident cards between Jan. 1 and
Dec. 31, 2008.
</P>
<P>
According to the official, given growing terrorist threats,
several countries, including Belgium and Italy, have issued e-ID
cards, while e-passports are being issued in Norway, Hong Kong,
the United States and Germany.
</P>
<P>
Using international electronic card technology for reference, the
NIA has integrated basic data and various identity recognizing
systems, such as facial images and finger-prints in accordance
with a resolution adopted by the International Civil Aviation
Organization (ICAO) at a Berlin meeting held in June 2002, to
facilitate the provision of services to citizens, the official
said.
