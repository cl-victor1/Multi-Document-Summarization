Taipei, Jan. 27 (CNA) 01/27/07  16:42:55 (By Y.F. Low)

<P>
The government will continue to promote its housekeeper training
project this year to boost the labor force participation rate of
women, Council of Economic Planning and Development (CEPD)
officials said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The labor force participation rate of Taiwan women stood at 48.68
percent in 2006, up slightly from 48.12 percent in 2005 and 47.71
percent in 2004.
</P>
<P>
The 2004 figure of 47.71 percent compares with the United States'
59.2 percent, Singapore's 54.2 percent, Hong Kong's 52.9 percent,
South Korea's 49.8 percent and Japan's 48.3 percent for the same
year.
</P>
<P>
CEPD officials attributed the low labor force participation rate
to the fact that most Taiwan women still retain the traditional
view that it is women's responsibility to stay at home to take
care of the elderly and children and do housework.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, jobs opportunities that are suitable for housewives,
such as part- time jobs, jobs with flexible work hours and
temporary jobs, are limited in the job market, the officials
noted.
</P>
<P>
They pointed out that the "good housekeepers" project introduced
by the CEPD in April 2006 is aimed at providing women with
training in senior care, child care and home management to
enhance their employment rate, with the goal of training 100,000
professional housekeepers over a two-year period.
</P>
<P>
While the government plans to train a total of 27,600 workers
specializing in senior care and care for the physically or
mentally challenged, 13,600 people had completed the training as
of October 2006, they said.
</P>
<P>
The target for child care workers is 60,000, with 30,000 having
completed training, they said.
</P>
<P>
For workers specializing in home management, the target is 8,600,
with 4,700 having completed training, they added.
