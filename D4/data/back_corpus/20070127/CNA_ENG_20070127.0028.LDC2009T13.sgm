PRESIDENT VOWS TO MAKE TAIWAN A 'NORMAL, COMPLETE COUNTRY'
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  Jan.  27 (CNA) 01/27/07  20:42:38 (By Elizabeth Hsu)
</P>
<P>
President Chen Shui-bian vowed to "make Taiwan a normal country"
in an interview on the "Talk Asia" show on the CNN International
(CNNI) channel while talking about his final year in office.
</P>
<P>
"Even though Taiwan is an independent, sovereign country, it is
not yet a normal and complete country, " Chen told Anjali Rao in
the interview that was conducted Jan. 23 and broadcast Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Chen explained that only when Taiwan becomes a member of the U.N.
family and of the World Health Organization (WHO) can he call
Taiwan a normal country and that only when the country  has a new
constitution approved by its people can he say it is a complete
country.
</P>
<P>
Chen reiterated what he has always told foreign politicians and
friends as well as media representatives and workers, namely that
"Taiwan is an independent, sovereign country," whose territory
covers 36,000 square kilometers and whose population stands at 23
million.
</P>
<P>
Asked why he made remarks on such "provocative" issues as
territory re- definition, Chen argued that "it is China that is
provoking Taiwan" and that "it is China that has never renounced
the use of force against Taiwan, " noting that China passed in
2005 its 'anti-secession law' in an attempt to lay a legal basis
for invading Taiwan some time in the future.
</P>
<P>
"It would be provocative if we were to claim that our national
sovereignty and our jurisdiction extended to mainland China, "
Chen said, noting that China has never recognized the fact of the
Republic of China's existence and that even their constitution
states that the ROC ceased to exist in 1949.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan's territory only covers Taiwan proper and several outlying
islands, including Penghu, Kinmen and Matsu, Chen said, adding
that "this is a fact, and there is no need to redefine it."
</P>
<P>
Asked about China's massive missile deployment targeting Taiwan,
Chen told the chat show host that the correct number is 988
missiles. He also noted that the number of missiles deployed
along the mainland's southeastern coast has increased "five-fold"
since he became president in 2000 and that he believes the
hostile deployment has been expanding at a rate of at least 120
missiles per year.
</P>
<P>
According to intelligence Taiwan has gathered, Chen added, China
has completed its preparations to use force against Taiwan in
three stages, namely to establish contingency-response combat
capabilities by 2007, to build up its combat capability for a
large-scale military engagement by 2010, and to ensure victory in
a decisive battle by 2015.
</P>
<P>
In the face of this military intimidation, the president said, it
is imperative for Taiwan to increase its self-defense capability
while trying to increase the number of people truly identifying
themselves with Taiwan. "It is not possible for Taiwan to defend
itself against external military threats without solidarity among
people," he added.
</P>
<P>
Talking about his efforts over the past seven years to strengthen
"Taiwan- centric consciousness," Chen said there is still a lot
to do, citing surveys that showed that only 36 percent of the
Taiwan people considered themselves Taiwanese in 2000, with the
figure rising to over 60 percent at the end of 2006.
</P>
<P>
"I hope that by the time my term ends, this number will have
increased to 70 percent or even 75 percent," Chen said.
</P>
<P>
In the CNN interview, the president, who has just gotten through
a year full of controversies and challenges, including a
nationwide campaign to depose him, also explained away a spate of
corruption charges against him and his family, stressing that he
believes in the country's judicial system which he claimed will
vindicate him and clear his name.
</P>
<P>
Asked about his work plans after finishing his term as president,
Chen said he wants to be a "happy volunteer" dedicating his
efforts to helping "continue, consolidate and deepen" Taiwan's
democratic reform.
