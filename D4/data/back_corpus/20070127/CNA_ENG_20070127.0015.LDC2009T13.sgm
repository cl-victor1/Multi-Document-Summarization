<P>
Approximately 200,000 people are looking for jobs in January
through 104 Job Bank -- the country's leading online employment
service provider, up 34.5 percent compared with the same month
last year, company officials said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
They said the trend is consistent with the results of a survey
released by the job bank last month, which shows that more than
50 percent of office workers are planning to change jobs after
the Lunar New Year holiday.
</P>
<P>
According to Chiu Wen-jen, the company's marketing director, the
decrease in year-end bonuses this year and the insolvency of two
subsidiaries of the Rebar Asia Pacific Group have raised workers'
sense of crisis, prompting them to seek opportunities for better
jobs.
</P>
<P>
As a result, a larger number of job seekers have appeared in
January this year than last year, although the Lunar New Year
holiday starts 20 days later this year than last year, Chiu said.
</P>
<P>
Attracted by the high bonuses offered by high-tech companies,
25,000 job seekers are targeting openings in these companies in
January, according to the job bank's tallies.
</P>
<P>
The five most popular fields among the job seekers are the
electronic parts and components industry, the semiconductor
industry, the software and Internet- related industries, the
optical industry as well as the computer  and consumer
electronics  manufacturing industries.
</P>
<P>
Of the job openings available in the information technology
industry, those related to mobile phones, semiconductor, IC
design, flat panel displays and games have drawn the largest
number of job seekers.
</P>
<P>
In terms of the employment demand in the information technology
industry in January, there are 15,000 openings for research and
development engineers, 8,400 openings for process engineers,
2,400 openings for semiconductor engineers, 1,200 openings for
software engineers, and 1,200 openings for photonics engineers.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Chiu said that besides workers who are planning to
change jobs, many job seekers in January are those who have just
completed their military service, 73.2 percent of whom are
college or university graduates.
</P>
<P>
The positions targeted by this group of job seekers are mainly in
research and development, process planning, software engineering
and sales, Chiu said.
