The Ministry of Justice (MOJ) said Saturday that a hotline for
reporting corruption has borne fruit since being set up over two
years ago.
</P>
<P>
MOJ officials said that they handled 3,383 reports of corruption
between October 2004 and December 2006, with six of the leads
resulting in convictions.
</P>
<P>
The ministry has also handed out a total of NT$4.1 million
(US$124,200) in reward money to informants, they added.
</P>
<P>
The officials noted that the hotline (02-23167586) was set up in
2004 and patterned on the Independent Commission Against
Corruption's hotline in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
The officials said that all reports of corruption received via
the hot line will be handled swiftly and that if administrative
negligence or government procurement are involved in the cases,
the MOJ will take timely preventive measures.
</P>
<P>
They invited the public to come forward to report on any
corruption in the civil service in order to help build a clean
society,  adding that all information provided  will be kept
confidential.
</P>
<P>
Informants can claim cash rewards of up to NT$6 million, they
said, adding that the maximum reward will be raised to NT$10
million after a revision of the relevant regulations.
