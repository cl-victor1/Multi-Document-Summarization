<P>
A national women volunteer service network of the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) was launched in Taichung,
central Taiwan Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Lin Chia-lung, DPP secretary-general, said at the launching
ceremony that with the dawning of a graying society in Taiwan,
the volunteer service network will enable the party to be more in
step with the pulse of society.
</P>
<P>
Lin also said that the party has been the most supportive of
women but that it has also been the least popular among women
because of their impression of the party formed through street
clashes and demonstrations.
</P>
<P>
"Volunteer service will serve as a good start for change, " Lin
said.
</P>
<P>
Hsu Chia-tien, director of the Department of Women Affairs, noted
that the department has set up DPP women volunteer service groups
in every city and county since last August.
</P>
<P>
Hsu noted that the volunteer groups have sponsored 27 activities
in communities, including visiting nurseries and seniors living
alone as well as holding blood drives.
</P>
<P>
It is hoped that support for the DPP will be turned into
community service, Hsu added.
</P>
<P>
Heads of the volunteer groups islandwide attended the gathering.
Also on hand were Liao Wan-chien, director of DPP's Taichung
branch, and Taichung Councilors Tseng Mu-chuan and Chi Li-yu.
