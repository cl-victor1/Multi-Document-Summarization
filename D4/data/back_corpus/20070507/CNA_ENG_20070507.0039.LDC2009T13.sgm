Non-profit organizations will be able to bid for funding support
from the British Trade and Cultural Office (BTCO) for Taiwan-
based projects under the theme of climate change and human rights
protection, BTCO said in a press release Monday.
</P>
<P>
Priority will be given to projects that take a strategic approach
to both of these areas, and which are likely to make a sustained
difference. Projects must be completed by March 2008, and
preference will be given to projects that are scheduled for
completion by December this year, BTCO said.

<P>
"This is the first year that we have used open competition to
invite bids for project work. We plan to use the projects to
strengthen our ties with non-profit organizations and to promote
our objectives of increasing awareness of climate change and
driving progress towards a low-carbon economy here in Taiwan, "
said BTCO Director Michael Reilly.

<P>
Funding of up to NT$ 300,000 per project is available. The
deadline for applications is May 30.
