Taipei,  May 7 (CNA) 05/07/07  19:02:12 (By Han Nai-kuo)

<P>
A bus driver and 21 passengers were injured in a four-bus pile-up
in downtown Taipei during the morning rush hour Monday.
</P>
<P>
The accident occurred at the intersection of Linsen North Road
and Nanking East Road when a No. 282 bus belonging to the Chih
Nan Bus Co. rear-ended a bus of the Taipei Bus Co., setting off
crashes involving another two buses owned by the Kuo Kuang Motor
Transport Co.
</P>
<P>
The impact was so strong that Wang Chia-ching, driver of the No.
282 bus, and 21 passengers were injured, including some in the
Taipei Bus Co. vehicle who suffered whiplash injuries.
</P>
<P>
The Taipei fire brigade dispatched 12 ambulances and took the
injured to four different hospitals for treatment.
</P>
<P>
Police were still trying to find the cause of the accident but
ruled out alcohol as a factor because all four drivers have
passed breath tests.
</P>
<P>
Because the No. 282 bus was almost totaled, the police were
unable to determine whether its brake system had failed. They
were also investigating the possibility that the driver of the
No. 282 bus might have dozed off at the wheel because he appeared
to have crashed at normal driving speed.
