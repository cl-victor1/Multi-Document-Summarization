The biggest ever international conference on plant vascular
biology opened Monday at Academia Sinica -- Taiwan's top research
institution -- with about 350 biologists from all over the world
attending, according to the event conveners.

<P>
The five-day "Plant Vascular Biology 2007" -- organized by the
institution's Agricultural Biotechnology Research Center -- will
cover the key structural and functional systems of the higher
plants, the plant vascular system and communications between
different parts of the plant, according to the conveners.

The symposium is co-chaired by William Lucas -- a professor at UC
Davis and also a Member of the French Academy of Science -- and
Yang Ning-sun -- a research fellow at the Agricultural
Biotechnology Research Center.

Yang said in a statement released ahead of the conference that
research on plant molecular and cell biology has been advancing
rapidly in recent years and that the meeting "could help
encourage and inspire many local students and scientists to
engage in plant and agricultural research. "
