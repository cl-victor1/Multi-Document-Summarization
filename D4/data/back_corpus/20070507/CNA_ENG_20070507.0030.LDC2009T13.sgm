The ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) will revoke the
opinion poll phase of its presidential primary, DPP acting
Chairman Chai Trong-rong said Monday.
</P>
<P>
At a news conference held by all four contestants in the primary,
Chai said the Central Executive Committee would meet later in the
day to revise the regulations for the presidential primary to get
rid of the opinion polls after three of the contestants dropped
out of the race, leaving Frank Hsieh, who won the primary party
vote Saturday, as the only candidate still in the contest.
</P>
<P>
DPP Chairman Yu Shyi-kun, who took a leave of absence from his
post to run in the primary only to land in a distant third place
in Saturday's vote, said at the news conference that he and the
two other contestants -- Premier Su Tseng- chang and Vice
President Annette Lu -- decided to quit the race in recognition
of the party members' decision in the vote.
</P>
<P>
Yu said he will motion at the party's next congress to revise the
regulations for choosing party candidates in all elections and do
away with opinion polls, which are supposed to be conducted among
people friendly toward the DPP.
</P>
<P>
The opinion polls for choosing the 2008 presidential nominee were
originally set to take place May 9-11 and were supposed to
account for 70 percent in deciding the final winner.
