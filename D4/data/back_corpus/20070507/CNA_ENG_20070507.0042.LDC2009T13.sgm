EX-KMT CHIEF SEEKS QUICK MEETING OVER PRESIDENTIAL BID
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taipei, May 7 (CNA) 05/07/07  21:57:41 (By Flor Wang)
</P>
<P>
Former Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Ma Ying-jeou is seeking a
meeting with Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng as soon as
possible so as to fix their cooperation in the 2008 presidential
race, KMT Secretary-General Wu Duen-yih said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Wu Duen-yih made the comments to reporters following a meeting
with Ma and KMT Chairman Wu Poh-hsiung to discuss the issue.
</P>
<P>
According to Wu Duen-yih, the KMT has to pick up its pace in
aligning  Ma and Wang in view of a much faster-than-expected
consolidation of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)
electoral efforts following former Premier Frank Hsieh's victory
in the DPP's primary in a vote by party members Sunday.
</P>
<P>
In a news conference called Monday afternoon, three of Hsieh's
rivals in the primary -- Vice President Annette Lu, Premier Su
Tseng-chang and DPP Chairman Yu Shyi-kun -- displayed their full
support of Hsieh and called for party solidarity to secure
victory in the upcoming presidential poll despite their fierce
competition before the vote.
</P>
<P>
As Wang has demanded that trust-worthy third parties be present
during his tete-a-tete with Ma, KMT Honorary Chairman Lien Chan
and incumbent Chairman Wu will be invited to take part, Wu Duen-
yih said, adding that a meeting involving Ma, Wang, Lien and Wu
is expected to take place in the coming days.
</P>
<P>
Admitting that Hsieh would be a formidable opponent in the 2008
presidential election, Wu Duen-yih said that Ma's "Mr. Clean"
image would be his greatest asset in pursuit of the presidency,
despite being dogged by controversial corruption charges. "Ma
must bear down to prove his innocence in the case," Wu Duen-yih
asserted.
</P>
<P>
Ma stepped down as KMT chairman in mid-February after he was
charged by DPP lawmakers over allegedly embezzling some NT$11
million from funds in a special monthly municipal allowance
designated for his discretionary use when he served as mayor of
Taipei from 1998-2006.
</P>
<P>
Ma has maintained his innocence and defended himself in Taipei
District Court, which already held two hearings on his case in
April.
