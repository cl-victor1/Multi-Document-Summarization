EX-NEW TIDE FACTION SUFFERS DRUBBING IN DPP LEGISLATIVE PRIMARY
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taipei, May 7 (CNA) 05/07/07  14:02:10 (By Sofia Wu)
</P>
<P>
The once all-powerful New Tide faction in the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) suffered a drubbing in the just-concluded
first phase of the party's primary for the year-end legislative
elections, party sources said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Some 250,000 DPP members went to the polls Sunday to elect the
party's candidates for regional and at-large legislative seats to
be up for grabs in the coming elections.
</P>
<P>
Although factions inside the DPP were all officially disbanded
last year in a move to promote party reform and enhance unity,
factional influence and strife remain in the party ranks.
</P>
<P>
As the year-end legislative elections will mark the first time
that a "single- member constituency, two vote" electoral system
will be adopted to elect a total of 113 legislators to form the
largely downsized legislature, the DPP decided to field only one
candidate in each constituency and hold a primary vote by its
members to determine its candidates for 27 of the 73
constituencies around the country.
</P>
<P>
In many of these electoral districts, former New Tide members
were pitted against their non-New Tide rivals. And Sunday's vote
count showed that only three New Tide members -- William C.T.
Lai, Chen Chin-de and Kuo Chun-ming -- managed to claim victory
in those races.
</P>
<P>
In other constituencies, New Tide members, including Lin Cho-shui
-- a four-term lawmaker -- as well as Lin Shu-fen, Chien Chao-
tung, Wei Ming-ku, Lee Wen-chung and Lin Shu-shan, were all
defeated by large margins by their non-New Tide in various
constituencies.
</P>
<P>
Another New Tide member, Lee Kun-tse, was beaten by his non-New
Tide peer Lin Chin-hsing by a small margin, and Hsiao Bi-khim,
who leans toward the New Tide, also lost to her rival by a
moderate margin.
</P>
<P>
Under the DPP's primary mechanism, the outcome of the member vote
accounts for a mere 30 percent of a regional-seat aspirant's
final score, with the remaining 70 percent to be determined by
the results of a series of public opinion polls to be conducted
between May 11 and June 17. The final nomination list will be
announced June 20.
</P>
<P>
Party analysts attributed the New Tide faction's resounding
defeat  in the primary  vote mainly to key faction  members'
controversial  deeds and words when the DPP was mired in an
unprecedented crisis arising from opposition- initiated
corruption allegations against the first family last summer.
</P>
<P>
While opposition parties repeatedly mounted motions in failed
attempts in the legislature to recall President Chen Shui-bian
over his alleged misuse of a "special state affairs fund, " some
outspoken New Tide members either overtly or covertly echoed
opposition lawmakers' push for Chen to step down. Two New Tide
lawmakers -- Lin Cho-shui and Lee Wen-chung -- even resigned from
their posts in an attempt to enhance pressure on Chen to quit
voluntarily to pave the way for what they called major political
reform.
</P>
<P>
Some New Tide leading figures' scathing criticism against the
first family during the unprecedented round-the-clock sit-in on
Ketagalan Boulevard near the Presidential Office by crowds of
"red-clad" protesters led by former DPP Chairman Shih Ming-teh
last September also enraged many DPP core supporters.
</P>
<P>
"With those bitter memories remaining vivid in their minds, many
of the DPP faithful got their revenge by voting against New Tide
legislative hopefuls, regardless of their personal
qualifications, " a party analyst said.
</P>
<P>
Against this backdrop,  New Tide members and leaners also
performed poorly in the fray for party nomination for 34 at-large
legislative seats to be up for grabs. Only two of them -- Hung
Chi-chang, a New Tide bigwig who has served as lawmaker for four
terms, and Tien Chiu-chin, an incumbent lawmaker -- managed to
secure a spot on the top 10 list.
</P>
<P>
The number of at-large seats will be allotted among political
parties in proportion to the ratio of votes they garner in the
party-based vote. Only the top 10 listed DPP candidates will be
guaranteed an at-large seat.
</P>
<P>
As many New Tide hopefuls, including both incumbent and former
lawmakers, enjoy high popularity among ordinary citizens, it
remains to be seen whether some of them still have a chance to
emerge as final victors in the wake of the second phase of the
primary.
</P>
<P>
For the at-large seat hopefuls, the outcome of the member vote
accounts for 40 percent of their final score, with the results of
opinion polls making up the remaining 60 percent.
</P>
<P>
The New Tide faction's poor showing has also taken toll on
Premier Su Tseng- chang's presidential bid. Su formed an alliance
with the faction in the hopes of gaining leverage from its
stringent factional organization and discipline to boost his
quest for the party's nomination to run in the 2008 presidential
election.
</P>
<P>
The faction, however, turned out to be a liability for him,
particularly after last autumn's "red-clad" anti-Chen campaign.
Despite his possession of administrative resources, Su lost to
former Premier Frank Hsieh in Sunday's primary vote held
simultaneously with the vote for legislative hopefuls.
</P>
<P>
Su captured only 33.4 percent of the vote, far lower than Hsieh's
44.66 percent. Before the end of the vote count, Su conceded
defeat and announced his withdrawal from the presidential
primary. Su pledged to support whoever wins the party's
presidential primary.
</P>
<P>
By garnering one-third of the votes, party analysts said, Su will
remain a key power player in the DPP. It remains unclear whether
he is likely to team up with Hsieh in the next presidential
election.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, two legislative aspirants with close ties to Su -- Lee
Wen-chung and Shen Fa-hui -- were also defeated in the primary
vote, but one of his proteges, Wu Ping-jui, managed to defeat his
rival, Tsao Lai-Wang,  a close ally of Hsieh, in a Taipei  County
constituency.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to Hsieh's brilliant presidential primary poll numbers,
nearly all of his proteges in the legislature outgunned their
rivals by large margins in the first phase of the party primary.
Among them are Kao chien-chih, Kuan Bi-ling, Hsieh Hsin-ni, Huang
Chien-hui and Wang Shih-chien.
</P>
<P>
Equally noteworthy were the gains made by the loosely grouped
former Justice Alliance which was founded by President Chen
during his tenure as legislator in the 1990s. Key figures of the
faction, including Chuang Shou-han, Lin Chung-mo, Chiang Chao-yi
and Yu Cheng-hsien, all outperformed their rivals in the race for
party nomination for regional seats elections.
</P>
<P>
In the contest for at-large seats, Justice Alliance members, such
as Gao Jyh- peng, Chiu Yi-ying, Yu Cheng-tao and Tsai Huang-
liang, all made the top 10 list.
</P>
<P>
Three former DPP members -- Shen Fu-hsiung, Luo Wen-jia and Fan
Hsun-lu -- all finished far back in the race for at-large
legislative seats because in the eyes of DPP loyalists, they
failed to defend the party's core values during critical moments,
particularly during last year's "red-clad" protest crisis,
analysts said.
