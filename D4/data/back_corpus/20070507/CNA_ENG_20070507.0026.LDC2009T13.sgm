<P>
Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) Vice Chairman Tung Chen-yuan
called Monday for permanent peace in the Taiwan Strait, saying
that it is not beneficial for Taiwan to continue confronting
China.
</P>
<P>
Tung made the remarks while elaborating on the government's China
policy to youth leaders during a seminar in Tainan City sponsored
by the municipal authorities in southern Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
According to Tung, Taiwan faces a huge squeeze in its dealings
with China. Beijing will keep on bullying Taiwan in the
international community if Taiwan remains tight-lipped, but
Taiwan's continued resistance against China might lead to
military conflict in the strait, he said.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan has to build perpetual peaceful and cooperative relations
with China based on goodwill and reconciliation while
safeguarding its independent sovereignty, democracy and mutual
trust, Tung said.
</P>
<P>
As Taiwan's reliance on the Chinese market hit 27.5 percent of
the country's total foreign trade, Taiwan worked out the "active
management, effective opening" directive to govern local
businesses' trade and economic activities in China, Tung said.
</P>
<P>
At present, China absorbs 40 percent of Taiwan's exports, while
70 percent of Taiwan's outbound investment goes to China, Tung
pointed out, adding that more than 500 Taiwanese economic
criminals, including over 70 serious violators, are hiding out in
China.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on the same occasion, Tainan Mayor Hsu Tian-tsair said
that it is not necessary for Taiwan to treat China as an enemy
but that it would also be risky to treat China as a good friend.
"We cannot hobble national security and dignity in search of
business interests in China," he said.
</P>
<P>
Hsu called Taiwan-China relations one of the thorniest issues in
history and contended that China will not stop its intimidation
and invasion of Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
At a time when China is continuing its military buildup, it will
pose a constant uncertainty and threat to Taiwan, which must
properly handle its ties with China.
