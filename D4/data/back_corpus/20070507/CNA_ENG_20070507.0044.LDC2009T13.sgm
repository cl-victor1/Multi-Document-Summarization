Premier Su Tseng-chang, who lost the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party's (DPP) presidential election primary, said
Monday that he will respect the DPP selection mechanism and the
decision of former Premier Frank Hsieh on his running mate in the
2008 presidential election.

<P>
Su made the remarks after a meeting with Legislative Yuan Speaker
Wang Jin-pyng to push for early passage of the 2007 budget of the
central government.

During their meeting, Wang praised Su for his decision to quit
the race in order to bolster DPP party unity. Su replied that
what he did is consistent with long- standing DPP tradition and
that he will be glad to support Frank Hsieh in next year's
presidential election.

<P>
Hsieh is now the only DPP presidential candidate. The other three
contestants -- Su, Vice President Annette Lu, and DPP Chairman Yu
Shyi-kun -- announced their decisions at a news conference
earlier in the day to drop out of the race and eliminate the need
for apublic opinion poll in the primary's second phase.
