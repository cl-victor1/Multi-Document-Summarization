Forty-six traffic accidents occurred on the Tungao section of the
Suao-Hualien Highway along the northeastern coast in 2006,
meaning that an accident occurs, on average, more frequently than
once every 10 days -- a figure making this the most dangerous
section of the rugged highway, according to tallies released by
Suao police Monday.

Statistics show that approximately 350 traffic accidents were
reported on the 64 km-long stretch of highway connecting Yilan's
Suao township and Hualien in eastern Taiwan, causing four deaths
and another 87 injuries.

<P>
Although no accidents on the Tungao section have claimed lives,
the 14 percent accident occurrence rate is too high to be
ignored, the police said, advising motorists to strictly respect
speed limit while navigating the road's steep downgrade and sharp
curves.

The Suao-Hualien Highway come to the spotlight recently after the
government's plan to construct an expressway connecting the two
places stirred up the debate between Hualien residents who want
the expressway and those advocating for environmental protection
in the region. Poor traffic conditions have been one of the
motives behind the construction of the new road, which is widely
considered as a significant threat to the natural environment of
the northeastern coast.
