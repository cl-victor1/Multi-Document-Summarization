Legendary Hong Kong-based kung fu novelist Jin Yong, whose
knight-errant novels are devoured by Chinese readers around the
world, is scheduled to come to Taipei May 18, mainly to receive
an honorary doctorate from National Chengchi University (NCCU), a
publishing source said Monday.
</P>
<P>
The 83-year-old Jin Yong will be conferred an honorary doctorate
by NCCU May 18 in recognition  of his outstanding  long-term
contribution to Chinese-language writing and literature, as well
as his assiduous attitude toward learning.
</P>
<P>
Jin Yong will be one of three people to be awarded honorary
doctorates  by NCCU in an event marking NCCU's 80th founding
anniversary. The other two are Cloud Gate Dance Theater founder
Lin Hwai-min and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. founder
Morris Chang.
</P>
<P>
Jin Yong, whose real name is Louis Liang-yung Cha, entered the
Diplomacy Department of the Central Academy of Political Science
in 1944 when the academy's operations were still in China. The
academy was renamed NCCU after it moved to Taiwan in 1950.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai-born Jin Yong -- Hong Kong's most eminent man of letters
-- has written 15 best-selling martial arts novels, most of which
have been adapted for film and television.
</P>
<P>
The soft-spoken, quintessentially Chinese man is renowned not
only as the author of 15 kung fu novels but as a veteran
reporter, publisher and political commentator. He founded Hong
Kong's Ming Pao newspaper and its sister publications.
</P>
<P>
A man of letters who is also an expert in law, history and
Buddhism, Jin Yong was conferred an honorary doctorate by
Cambridge University in 2005. He applied to go to the history
institute of Cambridge the same year, with Dr. David McMullen as
his mentor.
</P>
<P>
Jin Yong is scheduled to receive his master's degree from
Cambridge May 12 before heading to Taiwan for the NCCU honorary
doctorate.
</P>
<P>
His 15 novels, written between 1955 and 1972, are considered more
than just kung fu stories.  Their pages burst with fantastic
knight-errant tales of heroic swordsmen and beautiful heroines,
intermingling romance, tragedy and comedy with Chinese and
religious values.
</P>
<P>
Universities around the Chinese-speaking world have formed Jin
Yong fan clubs, sponsored seminars or opened classes on his
classic novels, in which Chinese readers can immerse themselves
in their cultural heritage from the language, calligraphy, art,
music, traditional costume, cuisine and martial arts that they
find in the novels. Traditional Chinese culture, fantasy and
history form the colorful backdrops for his works.
