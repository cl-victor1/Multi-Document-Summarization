TAIWAN REPORTERS `HAVE RIGHT TO WORK ANYWHERE:' RWB
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  Jan. 28 (CNA) 01/28/07  18:24:33 (By Deborah Kuo)

Taiwan journalists and camera crews "have the right to cover news
at any international organization" and it is unacceptable that
they have been barred from the United Nations and related groups,
the founder of Reporters Without Borders (RWB) said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
RWB Secretary-General  Robert Menard,  who established  the
association in France in 1985 aimed at fighting for freedom of
the press and freedom of expression and ensuring the protection
of journalists by denouncing human rights breaches, said RWB will
resolutely and continuously throw its support behind Taiwan
reporters to cover news anywhere in the world.
</P>
<P>
Speaking during a ceremony in which he received the 2006 Asia
Democracy and Human Rights Award presented by the Taiwan
Foundation for Democracy -- the first of its kind -- Menard said
RWB will continue to render its support to Taiwan reporters.
</P>
<P>
Menard said the US$100,000 prize money that comes with the award
will be used to finance the establishment of a new RWB Web site
in Chinese aimed at allowing more Chinese-speaking people to be
better informed and helping those journalists who have been
persecuted.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the Taiwan authorities have been criticized and
prejudiced by local media outlets and their workers, but said
media criticism is like the oxygen of democracy -- it may be
critical or irrational, but it is the price for democracy.
</P>
<P>
He said Taiwan has set the best example of democracy in Asia as
its people enjoy press freedom and the country has a strong and
independent media regime.
</P>
<P>
Although "Taiwan democracy" is not perfect and Taiwan faces all
kinds of problems that other democratic  countries  have also
encountered, there are always solutions to the problems, he said.
</P>
<P>
Menard said he would like to remind those who he claimed have
been "deceived" by the vision of China's huge market that there
are still over 80 journalists or Internet users in China who are
imprisoned. Despite China's reforms and opening in recent years,
the Chinese media and Internet communications are still censored
and controlled, he added.
</P>
<P>
He said that during a recent visit to China by several RWB
officials, including himself, they handed the Chinese authorities
a name list of Chinese journalists who have been imprisoned and
asked Beijing to take concrete steps in response to their
expressed concerns on the matter before 2008, when the Olympics
will be held in the Chinese capital.
</P>
<P>
RWB is kept on constant alert via its network of over 100
correspondents and rigorously condemns any attack on press
freedom around the world by keeping the media and the general
public informed through press releases and public- awareness
campaigns.
</P>
<P>
The association currently maintains 16 branch operations in 15
countries in Asia, Europe and the American and African
continents.
