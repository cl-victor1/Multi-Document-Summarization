Taipei, Ja. 28 (CNA) 01/28/07  23:57:35 (By Sofia Wu)

The Central Election Commission (CEC) plans to announce Wednesday
a complete redistricting scheme for the next legislative election
late this year, a CEC official said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The seventh Legislative Yuan will be elected in accordance with a
new "single- member constituency, two-vote" electoral system,
replacing the "multi-member constituency" system of the past.
Moreover, the number of the seats will be cut from 225 to a mere
113.
</P>
<P>
According to the Election and Recall Law of the Public
Functionaries, the Legislative Yuan has to pass a redistricting
scheme worked out by the CEC 13 months before the term of the
current legislature expires in January 2008.
</P>
<P>
But as the lawmakers could not agree on some parts of the plan
before a Friday deadline, the premier and the legislative speaker
have to meet to thrash out the differences according to the law.
</P>
<P>
During a Jan. 24 meeting between Premier Su Tseng-chang and
Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng, they came to agreement on
the redistricting scheme for 17 cities and counties around the
country, but remained divided on eight cities and counties.
</P>
<P>
Su and Wang met again two days later, but no progress was
achieved.
</P>
<P>
It remains unclear when the two heavyweights will meet again on
the issue.
</P>
<P>
The CEC official said all CEC commissioners will meet Wednesday
to discuss the redistricting issue and announce their final
decision at the end of the meeting.
</P>
<P>
According to the existing law, the official said, if the premier
and the legislative speaker fail to come to terms on the issue
before the Jan. 31 deadline, the CEC commissioners have a final
say on the redistricting scheme.
</P>
<P>
"The CEC is abided by the law to promulgate the final
redistricting scheme by the end of this month. If the CEC fails
to make an announcement Jan. 31, it would breach the existing law
provision," he added.
