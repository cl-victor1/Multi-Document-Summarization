LAWMAKERS DO NOT THINK KMT HEAD SHOULD BE ABSENT FROM 2008 RACE

Taipei,  Jan.  28 (CNA) 01/28/07  17:22:02 (By Deborah Kuo)

An opposition Kuomintang (KMT) lawmaker said Sunday he disagrees
with speculation that KMT Chairman Ma Ying-jeou may withdraw from
the 2008 presidential race if he is indicted on corruption
charges involving a special allowance budgeted by the government
for his discretionary use during his eight- year tenure as Taipei
mayor.
</P>
<P>
Legislator Wu Yu-sheng said it would not be "right" if Ma does
not run in the 2008 presidential race simply because of the
controversy surrounding the special allowance, which has already
turned into a source for "political bickering."
</P>
<P>
Wu, who worked as one of Ma's top aides when Ma was Taipei mayor,
said he has no authority to comment for Ma, but added that Ma,
who he said has always attached great importance to the people's
welfare, should enter the 2008 race.
</P>
<P>
The key issue is whether or not the Taiwan voters will favor Ma,
Wu noted.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, KMT Legislator Joanna Lei said that while Ma is unable
to alter the methods his political foes adopt to deal with him,
he can decide to face his enemies' plotting with a firm stance.
</P>
<P>
Saying that Taiwan's fate hinges on the 2008 presidential
election, Lei said that as an opposition leader, Ma should stand
tall and bear the sacred responsibility of turning the situation
around.
