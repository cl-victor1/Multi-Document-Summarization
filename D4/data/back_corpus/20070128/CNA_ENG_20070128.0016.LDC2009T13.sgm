The China-based Tianshi Group, the world's fifth-largest health
products direct selling conglomerate,  has ventured into Taiwan,
opening its regional headquarters in the landmark Taipei 101
tower.
</P>
<P>
Following a recommendation from Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang
Jin-pyng, the group's founder, Li Jinyuan, toured Taipei 101
during a visit to Taiwan in mid-2006 and was quoted as saying
that he would locate his group's Pacific Rim headquarters in
Taipei 101.

<P>
Because of restrictions on direct Chinese investment in Taiwan,
the group's Taiwan headquarters is established under the name of
its U.S. branch.
</P>
<P>
The Tianshi health products direct selling supermarket in Taipei
101 includes a zone available for testing products and a training
center, as well as a spa, a yoga classroom and fitness
facilities.
</P>
<P>
The group  plans to establish  six to 10 direct  selling
supermarkets around Taiwan and open four to five franchised
selling points in every county and city.
