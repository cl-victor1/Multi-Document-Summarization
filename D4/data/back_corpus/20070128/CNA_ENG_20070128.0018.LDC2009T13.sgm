<P>
Vice President Annette Lu has encouraged local women to shoulder
more responsibilities for their country.
</P>
<P>
Lu made the call Saturday during her address to more than 100
female business executives at a Democratic Pacific Union-
sponsored activity held in southern Tainan County.
</P>
<P>
The vice president noted that there have been female leaders on
the world's five major continents. France will soon see a female
presidential candidate, while in the United States, a woman, an
African American and a Mexican American have joined one party's
primary for the 2008 presidential election.
</P>
<P>
She was referring to Democratic Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton,
Senator Barack Obama, and New Mexico Governor Bill Richardson,
who all have announced their bids for the White House.
</P>
<P>
This shows that the world trend has begun to change, according to
Lu.
</P>
<P>
She added that the focus of the women's rights campaign has
shifted from the pursuit of gender equality to gender harmony and
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Lu said she is not encouraging women to jostle with men for
power. Rather, women should shoulder the same responsibilities as
men do, she said.
