Yang Chuan-kwang, the decathlon silver medal winner at the 1960
Rome Olympics and a Taiwan legend, died of a stroke in California
Saturday at the age of 74.

<P>
Yang was at his son's home near Los Angeles when he was hit by a
stroke and rushed to the hospital a few days earlier, where his
condition deteriorated.

Yang, a member of the indigenous Ami tribe who was born in 1933,
won gold in the decathlon at the 1954 Asian Games in Manila.
Dubbed the "Iron man of Asia, " he took silver six years later at
the Rome Olympics after a duel with his UCLA schoolmate Rafer
Johnson of the United States. It was the first Olympic medal
Taiwan had ever won.

<P>
In 1963, Yang set a final world record of 9,121 points in
California before the grading formula for the decathlon was
changed.
