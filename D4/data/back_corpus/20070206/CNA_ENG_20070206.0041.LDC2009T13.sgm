PRO-INDEPENDENCE HEAVYWEIGHT CLARIFIES EX-PRESIDENT'S STANCE
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  Feb.  6 (CNA) 02/06/07  21:42:32 (By Flor Wang)
</P>
<P>
Former President Lee Teng-hui has not changed his pro-Taiwan
independence stance and will take part in a special  activity  in
commemoration  of the 228 Incident,  a pro-independence
heavyweight said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Ng Chiau-tong, head of the Hand-in-Hand to Safeguard Taiwan
Alliance, made the remarks at a news conference in which he said
Lee remains firm on promoting Taiwan independence and supports
the idea of writing a new constitution and changing the country's
official title in order to make Taiwan a normal country.
</P>
<P>
Examination Yuan President Yao Chia-wen and Chin Mei-ling, a
Japan-based pro- independence backer who once served as a
national policy advisor to the president, were also at the news
conference to endorse Lee's stance.
</P>
<P>
According to Ng, who met Lee for over an hour earlier in the day
to discuss controversy arising from Lee's remarks about Taiwan
independence in recent days, the former president has also
promised to participate in the commemorative activities slated to
be held Feb. 28 to which President Chen Shui-bian will also be
invited.
</P>
<P>
Ng claimed that Lee has never deviated from his pro-Taiwan
independence stance and called for the public's "continued
support" for the cause.
</P>
<P>
Lee told Next Magazine and the TVBS cable station the previous
week that he had never backed Taiwan independence and claimed
that there is no need for the government to pursue formal
independence since Taiwan is already an independent sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
Lee's comments stirred up strong criticism from pro-independence
groups and "friends of Lee Teng-hui" groups, prompting some of
them to consider disbanding.
