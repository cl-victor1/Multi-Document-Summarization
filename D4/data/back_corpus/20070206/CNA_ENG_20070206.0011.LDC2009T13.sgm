Nauru is set to establish an embassy in Taiwan next month, an
official of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Lee Chuan-tung, director-general of the MOFA's Department of East
Asian &amp; Pacific Affairs, also said that Nauruan Ambassador to
the Republic of China Ludwig D. Keke, who arrived in Taiwan
recently, will present his credentials to President Chen Shui-
bian soon.
</P>
<P>
Lee noted that since the two countries re-established diplomatic
relations in 2005, exchange activities and cooperation projects
between the two countries have been proceeding smoothly.
</P>
<P>
After Nauru sets up the embassy in March, relations between the
two countries will be further boosted, he added.
</P>
<P>
Nauruan President Ludwig Scotty, who is currently on a five-day
visit in Taiwan, met with President Chen Monday. His itinerary
also includes signing a memorandum of understanding on
cooperation in labor affairs with Council of Labor Affairs
Chairman Lee Ying-yuan and inspecting the preparation work for
the establishment of the embassy.

<P>
Nauru, which switched diplomatic recognition to Beijing in July
2002, re- established formal diplomatic relations with Taiwan on
May 14, 2005 after Scotty was elected president of the South
Pacific nation.
</P>
<P>
Scotty made an official visit to Taiwan in March 2006 and made a
private stopover visit in Taiwan between late August and early
September the same year on his way to Palau for the first
leadership summit between Taiwan and its Pacific allies.
