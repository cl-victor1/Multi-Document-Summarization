PRESIDENT BRIEFS PREMIER ON RESHUFFLING KEY POSTS
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  Feb.  6 (CNA) 02/06/07  19:36:34 (By Lilian Wu)
</P>
<P>
Premier Su Tseng-chang said Tuesday that President Chen Shui-bian
has explained to him his reasons for reshuffling several key
Presidential Office posts.
</P>
<P>
Su made the remarks one day after an announcement by the
Presidential Office regarding a swap of posts between
Presidential Office Secretary-General Tan Sun Chen and National
Security Council Secretary-General Chiou I-jen.
</P>
<P>
Other changes include the appointment of National Security Bureau
Director Hsueh Shih-min as a strategy adviser to the president
and the promotion of Deputy Director Shi Hwei-yow to Hsueh's
post.
</P>
<P>
Su said that "we have kept abreast of the personnel change. I
expressed appreciation to the president for telling me about his
intentions in detail."
</P>
<P>
But the premier added, "it is inappropriate for me to disclose
the president's intentions."
</P>
<P>
Asked if the personnel change is aimed at preparing the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) for the March 2008
presidential election, Su only said that both Chiou and Tan Sun
Chen have solid political backgrounds and that they are capable
of "shouldering great responsibilities."
</P>
<P>
Chiou served in the posts of secretary-general to the Executive
Yuan, the Presidential Office and the National Security Council
between 2000 and now, while Tan Sun Chen served as legislator,
Tainan county magistrate and foreign affairs minister between
1992 and 2006.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, DPP legislators said the new lineup, which will take
effect Wednesday, means that the DPP has taken up combat
positions for the year-end legislative  elections  and the March
2008 presidential election.
</P>
<P>
Ker Chien-ming, DPP caucus whip in the legislature, noted that
President Chen has relied on Chiou's resourcefulness in many
ways, and that Chiou served as the chief strategist in Chen's two
presidential elections.
</P>
<P>
Chiou's return to the post of secretary-general to the president,
in which he first served between January 2003 and May 2004, will
assist the president in dealing with many thorny issues, Ker
said.
</P>
<P>
He also said that Tan Sun Chen, who holds a Ph. D. in geophysics
from Purdue University, spent more than 20 years in the United
States and has developed an international perspective. He is also
well versed in local and central government affairs given that he
served as both a magistrate and foreign minister.
</P>
<P>
DPP Legislator Wang Hsin-nan also said that the president has
made appropriate adjustments, noting that Tan Sun Chen excels in
administrative ability, while Chiou, an adept who usually
maintains a low profile, will be capable of coordinating various
factions before the upcoming  primaries  for the legislative  and
presidential elections.
</P>
<P>
Opposition legislators generally agreed that the president took
the latest move "out of concern with winning the elections."
</P>
<P>
The main opposition Kuomintang said Chiou's new appointment means
that the president wants Chiou to serve as his chief strategist
in the two major elections ahead, and that the president's
announcement last year that he would loosen his grip on power and
"delegate his executive power" was nothing but "a joke."
</P>
<P>
They were referring to the president's announcement last May that
he would give full power to Premier Su to control the Executive
Yuan and refrain from meddling with the affairs of the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) amid rising calls in both the
DPP and the opposition for the president to take responsibility
for a series of scandals embroiling his family members and close
aides.
</P>
<P>
KMT Legislators Hsu Shao-ping, Fai Hrong-tai and Lin Teh-fu
speculated that Chiou would resort to anything just to win the
election, and his return to the main strategic post for upcoming
elections may mean that the president fears that he will face
persecution if the DPP loses in the 2008 presidential elections
in 2008.
</P>
<P>
First lady, Wu Shu-jen, is currently one of the defendants in the
"state affairs fund" trial. The president was named along with
his wife as a "joint perpetrator" in the embezzlement of funds
available for his discretionary use, but is protected by
constitutional immunity until he steps down in May 2008. The
president has consistently maintained his innocence in the case.
