<HEADLINE>
NATIONAL SECURITY BUREAU TO GET 1ST CIVILIAN DIRECTOR
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taipei,  Feb.  5 (CNA) 02/06/07  10:48:21 (By Sofia Wu)
</P>
<P>
Shi Hwei-yow, deputy director of the National Security Bureau
(NSB) , will soon become the bureau's first civilian head.
</P>
<P>
The Presidential Office announced Monday that NSB Director Hsueh
Shih-min will be transferred to serve as a strategy adviser to
the president and that the post to be vacated following his job
transfer will be filled by Shi. The personnel reshuffle will take
effect Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Up until now, the NSB, the country's top intelligence agency, has
been headed by senior officials with military backgrounds.
</P>
<P>
Shi, a judge-turned-politician, will be the first non-military
NSB chief when he assumes office Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Shi, who has a Ph.D. in law from National Chengchi University,
had been a Tainan and Taipei district court judge before joining
the quasi-official Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) in the early
1990s. During his stints as SEF's deputy secretary-general and
later SEF secretary-general and vice chairman, Shi took part in
many important rounds of negotiations with Chinese officials to
lay down a framework for institutionalized engagements across the
Taiwan Strait.
</P>
<P>
Shi later served as vice chairman of the Mainland Affairs Council
which charts Taiwan's policy toward China. When the Coast Guard
Administration was established in 2004, Shi became its inaugural
chief, a post that provided him with further opportunities to
deal with the military and intelligence units.
</P>
<P>
In February 2006, Shi was "demoted" to serve as NSB deputy chief.
The unexpected job transfer caused wide attention at that time.
Shi has consistently kept a low profile since then.
</P>
<P>
Sources close to the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)
said Shi's "demotion" a year ago was actually an arrangement to
prepare  him for taking up a heavier  duty in the country's
intelligence system.
</P>
<P>
Many DPP lawmakers have expressed high expectations of Shi's new
assignment, expecting him to streamline the country's
intelligence operations. They said they are hopeful that Shi's
promotion will mark a major step forward toward the goal of
having a civilian to lead the country's military.
</P>
<P>
In contrast, opposition Kuomintang legislators, including Ting
Shou-chung, were skeptical about Shi's qualification and
competence, saying they doubt Shi's ability to head the county's
mammoth intelligence and security system.
