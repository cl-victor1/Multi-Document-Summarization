Professor Bernard Cole of the National War College in Washington
D.C. reminded Taiwan Tuesday that it faces a great military
threat from China, advising that the island should never neglect
this factor in its military strategic analyses.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. expert in war affairs sounded the warning at a forum on
regional security and national defense, organized by the Ministry
of National Defense, to explain his previous remarks which cast
doubt on the combat capability and will of Taiwan's military
force.
</P>
<P>
Last month Cole expressed concerns in his speech at the Brookings
Institute in Washington D.C. that Taiwan's air force could lose
its air superiority in the Taiwan Strait as it has not moved
forward while Beijing's air force has been improving by leaps and
bounds.
</P>
<P>
Cole said he voiced his concerns to remind Taiwan of the
existence of China's military threat.
</P>
<P>
During the Taipei forum, Cole also spoke of his opinions on
Taiwan's plans to engage in organization adjustment and to expand
the recruitment of voluntary military personnel. "It is a long
way to go, " he said, noting that Taiwan needs to first make
efforts to resolve its financial and military investment
problems.
</P>
<P>
Also participating in the two-day forum opened Tuesday are Randy
Schriver, former U.S. deputy assistance secretary of state for
East Asian and Pacific affairs, and Dan Blumenthal, vice chairman
of the U.S.-China Security and Economic Review Commission and
former senior director for China, Taiwan and Mongolia in the U.S.
Office of the Secretary of Defense, as well as many retired
military officers from Japan, U.S. and India.

<P>
Cole visited Taiwan during the Cold War era in his capacity as a
U.S. Navy officer.
