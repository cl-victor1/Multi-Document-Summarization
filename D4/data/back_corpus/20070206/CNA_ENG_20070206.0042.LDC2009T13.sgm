The European Chamber of Commerce Taipei (ECCT)  and the London-
based Oxford Business Group (OBG) will collaborate to make the
Taiwan Economic Almanac available around the world from June with
the aim of helping European companies become more acquainted with
Taiwan's investment environment.
</P>
<P>
ECCT Chief Executive Officer Guy Wittich and OBG Taiwan Director
Karolien Holsters signed an agreement Monday in Taipei City to
seal the deal on their cooperative venture.
</P>
<P>
The almanac will be compiled by the OBG, which presently has
105,000 subscribers and publishes economic yearbooks for emerging
countries in Eastern Europe, Africa and the Middle East,
according to Holsters.
</P>
<P>
She said Taiwan is the 25th country to be included on its almanac
publishing list, adding that South Africa, Jordan, Egypt and
Malaysia are also on the list.
</P>
<P>
Holsters said the group will station researchers in Taiwan for
six to eight months who will highlight the characteristics of
Taiwan and make comprehensive, in-depth reports on the economy.
She estimated that a total of 65,000 copies will be issued.
</P>
<P>
She said that in the eyes of investors, Taiwan is a market with
great potential, adding that Taiwan's commercial advantage lies
in sharing a common language and culture with China, doing
business with companies from the United States and European
countries, and yet remaining small enough for investors to deal
with easily.
</P>
<P>
Wittich  said  foreign  investors  find a lot of business
opportunities in Taiwan, although he added that there is much
room for improvement in its cross- Taiwan Strait relations and
politics.
</P>
<P>
He noted that European enterprises fare quite well in the retail,
traffic and transport, and pharmaceutical industries in Taiwan,
while Taiwan also has the advantage of a better living
environment than that of China.
</P>
<P>
He expressed hope that the yearbook can help foreign investors
explore  more business  opportunities  in  Taiwan,  including
non-traditional areas such as tourism.
