Pingtung County,  Feb. 6 (CNA) 02/06/07  19:46:09 (By Han Nai-

<P>
The Pingtung District Prosecutor's Office on Tuesday released 11
suspects on bail after law enforcement officers detained them a
day earlier on charges of selling tainted pork from sick and dead
hogs.
</P>
<P>
Environmental police busted the ring the previous day in Pingtung
County's Changchih township and in the city of Pingtung, seizing
5,500 kg of tainted pork. The ring's members included seven
people with a license to transport sick and dead hogs for safe
disposal, as well as several hired hands.
</P>
<P>
The law enforcement agents found that the licensees had actually
been butchering the sick and dead hogs and selling the tainted
meat to consumers.
</P>
<P>
Police officers removed 5,500 kg of frozen pork, sausage and
preserved pork from a large walk-in freezer. Because the freezer
was built 10 years ago, they estimated that the illegal operation
might have gone on for a decade and were working to find out the
ring's distribution network.
</P>
<P>
The latest crackdown  in Pingtung  County  came after law
enforcement agents in Yunlin County, central Taiwan, raided five
illegal slaughterhouses Feb. 1, arresting one suspect and seizing
30 metric tons of tainted pork believed to have been stashed to
meet the increased demand for meat during the Lunar New Year
holiday.
</P>
<P>
In accordance with the Waste Disposal Act, those who ignore
health concerns and sell questionable meat from sick and dead
hogs can be sentenced to a maximum of five years in prison, plus
a fine of up to NT$3 million.
