A Taiwanese medical university and its Japanese counterpart
inaugurated a co- founded research center Monday, which aims to
enhance bilateral academic exchanges and research standards, a

The inauguration came after China Medical University, based in

In the wake of the agreement, the Japanese university donated

Tsuzuki group across Japan, which has a total number of students
exceeding 50,000.

The university is located in a suburban area of Tokyo and offers
six-year programs in Chinese medicine, medical pharmacy, and
health pharmacy, the spokesman added.
