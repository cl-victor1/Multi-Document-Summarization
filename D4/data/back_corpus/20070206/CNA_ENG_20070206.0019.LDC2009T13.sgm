Taipei,  Feb.  6 (CNA) 02/06/07  17:03:18 (By Y.F. Low)

<P>
Sixty-seven percent of hair dye products sold on the Taiwanese
market contain p-phenylenediamine (PPD) , an irritating chemical
that can lead to allergies and even cancer, according to the
results of a survey released Tuesday by the Consumers'
Foundation.
</P>
<P>
The survey was conducted on nine hair dye products purchased by
the foundation from cosmetics and beauty product stores in the
Taipei area on Feb. 5, foundation officials said.
</P>
<P>
The survey found that six of the products contained PPD, and four
of these did not issue any warnings for consumers, the officials
said.
</P>
<P>
Hsu Wan-sheng, a member of the foundation's medical disputes
committee, noted that PPD can trigger allergic reactions such as
swelling, itching and rashes in many people and result in a
greater roughness and darkening of the scalp.
</P>
<P>
Hsu advised people experiencing an allergic reaction to wash
their hair every day, warning that the problem can cause cell
death of the hair follicle if it is not dealt with properly over
a long period of time.
</P>
<P>
PPD can also damage blood cells in human bodies and hamper
metabolism, which can lead to anemia, breast cancer and bladder
cancer, Hsu said.
</P>
<P>
Yu Kai-hsiung, secretary-general of the foundation, pointed out
that Germany, France and Switzerland have banned the use of PPD
as an ingredient for hair dyes, while Taiwan has set the
concentration limit of PPD at 4.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
Yu urged the government to require hair dye manufacturers to
include relevant warnings on the labels of their products and to
stop using the chemical if there are safer substitutes available.
