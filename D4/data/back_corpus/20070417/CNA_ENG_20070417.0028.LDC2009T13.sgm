MA APPEARS IN COURT AGAIN TO FACE TRIAL ON CORRUPTION CHARGE
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  April 17 (CNA) 04/17/07  19:55:56 (By Elizabeth Hsu)

Former Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou appeared at the Taipei District
Court Tuesday for a second court session in his trial on charges
of embezzlement.
</P>
<P>
In response to media inquiries on the session, Ma said he and his
lawyers questioned the admissibility of evidence that anti-
corruption prosecutor Hou Kuan-jen had submitted to support his
indictment of Ma Feb. 13 on charges of embezzling from a special
allowance fund designated for his discretionary use while he
served as Taipei mayor from 1998 to 2006.
</P>
<P>
Ma told reporters that he had never noticed that he was listed as
a "defendant" before appearing at a probe on the mayoral
allowance Nov. 14 at the Taiwan High Prosecutors Office's anti-
corruption center until the inquiry took place. On the notice for
him to answer the questioning, Ma said he was classified as a
"person of interest."
</P>
<P>
Therefore, he did not arrive with his own lawyer to defend his
rights and interests during questioning, Ma claimed.
</P>
<P>
Asked whether he had been "misled" to face an "ambush-like probe"
without the protection of lawyers, Ma declined to comment, only
asking that people following case look into reports of the probe
before coming to a decision.
</P>
<P>
Asserting his innocence,  Ma claimed he has never stopped
demanding of himself that he stay clean and follow the law since
he began his political career two decades ago. His reputation was
smeared after the prosecution ignored the evidence in his favor
during the probe, said the politician, who has portrayed himself
as a political "Mr. Clean."
</P>
<P>
Soon after being indicted on charges of corruption, Ma resigned
from the post of chairman of the opposition Kuomintang and
announced his bid to run for the presidency in 2008. He argued if
he is found guilty, the same fate will befall almost all
government executives and everyone who has ever served as a mayor
or county magistrate.
</P>
<P>
Ma was charged with embezzling NT$11.17 million (US$337,650) from
the mayoral special allowance funds by taking advantage of his
position. Hou, who brought the high-profile indictment against
Ma, rejected an interpretation by the Ministry of Justice last
November that special allowance funds for executives of
government departments are actually meant as salary subsidies.
</P>
<P>
At the court, Ma urged the judges to review the long-existing but
faulty special allowance fund system and his decision to trust
the collective wisdom of "common practices" concerning the use of
the funds.
