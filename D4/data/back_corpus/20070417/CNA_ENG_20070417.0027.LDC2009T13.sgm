The Department of Health (DOH) warned the public Tuesday that
epidemic cerebrospinal meningitis has entered peak season with 17
notified cases so far, among which 11 have developed the full-
blown disease and two have died.
</P>
<P>
Lin Ting, deputy director of the DOH Center for Disease Control,
said the early symptoms of this form of meningitis, which is
caused by a specific bacterium, could be missed, saying that the
public should pay attention to such symptoms as fever and skin
rashes.

<P>
Treatment with antibiotics and other drugs is usually effective
against this infection in the initial stage, he added.
</P>
<P>
Lin said the disease is most prevalent between March and April,
noting that there were only four reported cases in the same
period of last year with only one confirmed case. There were 25
reported cases in the whole of 2006, among which there were 13
confirmed cases and two deaths.
</P>
<P>
Lin said that among the 11 confirmed cases this year, three cases
are babies not yet a month old, with the remaining eight cases
aged between 11 and 86. They are sporadic cases rather than
cluster cases, Lin added.
</P>
<P>
He advised the public to stay away from crowded places such as
military barracks or school dormitories and to pay attention to
personal hygiene.
</P>
<P>
People should also get vaccinated if they travel to Africa or
other regions listed as infectious places, he added.
