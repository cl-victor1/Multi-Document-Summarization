<P>
Former Premier Frank Hsieh vowed Tuesday to make no concessions
in the presidential primary of the ruling Democratic Progressive
Party (DPP) , despite fierce competition from his three rivals.
</P>
<P>
Hsieh made the pledge in a speech to supporters in Sanchung City,
Taipei County, which was also attended by several DPP lawmakers
and former government officials.
</P>
<P>
According to Hsieh, victory in the 2008 presidential election is
the ultimate goal of the DPP, which cannot be compromised by lack
of party harmony. Vice President Annette Lu, Premier Su Tseng-
chang and DPP Chairman Yu Shyi-kun are also competing  for the
party's nomination.
</P>
<P>
"It is true that every one of us wants to win the nomination, but
each should also be open-minded and get ready to form a ticket
with the successful candidate, " Hsieh said, adding that "lack of
party unity must not hobble the DPP's chances of election
victory" and that "the party must field the most qualified
hopeful."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, DPP members are slated to vote for the party's
presidential candidate May 6 along with a vote for legislative
candidates, the outcomes of which will be combined with public
opinion poll results to decide the candidates.
</P>
<P>
Hsieh and Su have a noticeable lead over Lu and Yu, according to
public opinion polls.
</P>
<P>
DPP officials have estimated that some 60 percent of party
members will take part in the vote, equivalent to around 150,000
ballots.
</P>
<P>
The largest number -- around 35,000 eligible party voters -- is
in Taipei County, followed by Kaohsiung City and Taipei City,
each with some 33,000.
