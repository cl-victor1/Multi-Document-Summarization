DPP TO INITIATE REFERENDUM LAW AMENDMENTS TO LOWER LEGAL
THRESHOLDS
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  April  17 (CNA) 04/17/07  11:56:34 (By Sofia Wu)

The legislative caucus of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) will initiate draft amendments to the Referendum Law aimed
at lowering the legal thresholds for holding a popular vote on
issues of national concern, a party whip said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Ker Chien-ming, the DPP legislative caucus convener, made the
remarks a day after the caucus and the Executive Yuan reached a
consensus on the steps to realize the goal of overhauling the
Referendum Law.
</P>
<P>
According to Ker, the DPP legislative caucus will discuss how the
legal thresholds should be adjusted in the coming few days and
come up with a final package of draft amendments by April 23.
</P>
<P>
The package will then be referred to the legislative floor for
deliberation and approval. "Hopefully, the package can be
assigned to a relevant standing committee to screen by April 27,"
Ker added.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the existing legal thresholds for holding a national
referendum are prohibitively high, Ker said critical revisions
are needed to make the law relevant and viable.
</P>
<P>
Besides lowering the legal thresholds, Ker said the mandatory
referendum review committee should also be abolished.
</P>
<P>
The current law stipulates that the signatures of at least 0.5
percent of eligible voters in the last presidential election are
needed for a referendum proposal to be initiated. After passing
the threshold, the signatures of 5 percent of the eligible voters
must be collected within six months for a referendum to be held.
Moreover, half of the total number of eligible voters must cast
ballots for the referendum result to be declared valid.
</P>
<P>
An anti-nuclear group known as the Nuke-4 Referendum Initiative
Association, led by former DPP Chairman Lin Yi-hsiung, has
proposed that the legal threshold for making the petition for a
referendum valid be lowered to 100 eligible voters and that the
number of signatures needed to be collected to put the proposal
to a referendum be cut to 1.5 percent of eligible voters.
</P>
<P>
In response, Ker said the 100 signatures-threshold for proposing
a referendum is too low. "Should that be adopted, I'm afraid
there could be an astronomical list of topics to be put to a
popular vote," he cautioned.
</P>
<P>
Ker said the DPP legislative caucus will make a thorough review
before drawing up new legal thresholds.
</P>
<P>
President Chen Shui-bian said last week that he has given his
full support to the ongoing campaign relaunched by the Nuke-4
Referendum Initiative Association to push for an overhaul of the
Referendum Law.
</P>
<P>
Stressing that referendums are a manifestation of the universal
value of democracy and the fundamental exercise of human rights,
Chen said the current Referendum Law virtually deprives local
people of their democratic rights and should therefore be revised
to live up to its promise. He urged the Legislative Yuan to amend
the law and get rid of all unreasonable stipulations by the end
of this year.
