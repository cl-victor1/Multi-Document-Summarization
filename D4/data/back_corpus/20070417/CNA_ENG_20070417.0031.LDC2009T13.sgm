WHO APPLICATION FOR 'TAIWAN' NOT CONTRARY TO 'FOUR NOES' PROMISE
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  April 17 (CNA) 04/17/07  20:40:13 (By Elisa Kao)

<P>
President Chen Shui-bian stressed Tuesday that the government's
application  to join the World  Health Organization (WHO) as a
full member under the name of "Taiwan" is not contrary to his
previous "four noes" promise.
</P>
<P>
Chen made the remarks during a meeting at the Presidential Office
with Henry Hyde, ex-chairman of the International Relations
Committee of U.S. House of Representatives.
</P>
<P>
Chen's "four noes" promise, made at his 2000 inauguration, means
not declaring Taiwan independence, not changing the ROC's
official name,  not  pushing  forth the  inclusion  of the  so-
called "state-to-state" description in the Constitution, and not
promoting a referendum to change the status quo in regards to the
question of independence or unification.
</P>
<P>
Chen said he wrote a letter to Margaret Chan, director general of
the World Health Organization (WHO) April 11, applying to join
the WHO as a full member under the title of "Taiwan."
</P>
<P>
Noting that Taiwan has encountered great difficulty joining
international organizations under its official title "ROC," Chen
said the name of "Taiwan" is the term most used on international
occasions and supported by the majority of Taiwanese people.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan has sought to join the World Health Assembly, the policy-
making body of the WHO, as an observer for the last decade, but
has failed to gain entrance due to the opposition of China.
</P>
<P>
According  to Chen,  China signed a secret memorandum  of
understanding (MOU) with the WHO Secretariat in 2005, imposing
more limits on Taiwan's entry into the world organization.
</P>
<P>
Chen said the government's application to join the WHO as a full
member under the name of "Taiwan" has been endorsed by more than
half of the country's legislators, and according to a survey
conducted in March, 94.9 percent of the respondents supported the
country's decision to apply to join the WHO under the name
"Taiwan."
</P>
<P>
The president stressed that the health concerns of 23 million
people in Taiwan should not be deprived, and disease control
efforts should find no loophole in Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan suffered significantly during the Severe Acute Respiratory
Syndrome (SARS) outbreak in 2003, and therefore should not be
excluded from the world disease prevention system, Chen added.
