CARLYLE CALLS OFF PLAN TO ACQUIRE TAIWAN'S ASE GROUP

Taipei, April 17 (CNA) 04/17/07  23:12:05 (By Maubo Chang)

<P>
The U.S.-based Carlyle Group has abandoned a plan to acquire
Kaohsiung-based Advanced Semiconductor Engineering Inc (ASE)
because of the difficulty in arriving at a price with ASE for its
stocks, an ASE official said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The anonymous ASE official said that after five months of
negotiations, the final price offered by Carlyle-- NT$39.5 per
share--- was not accepted by ASE whose stock closed at NT$41 per
share at Taiwan Stock Exchange Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Carlyle initially offered to acquire all of ASE's 4.6 billion
outstanding common shares at NT$39 per share in November. That
means it would have purchased the world's No.1 chip packaging and
test company for NT$18 billion, which would have been the
largest-ever buyout in Taiwan.
