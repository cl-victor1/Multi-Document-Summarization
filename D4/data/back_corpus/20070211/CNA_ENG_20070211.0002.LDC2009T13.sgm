</HEADLINE>

Changing the name of Taiwan's state-owned companies to make them
more identifiable with their country of origin doesn't conflict
with President Chen Shui-bian's "four noes" pledge, Chen's chief
of staff said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Chiou I-jen, secretary-general to the president, was responding
to a U.S. State Department statement that the United States does
not support Taiwn's ongoing move to rectifying  the names of its
state-owned companies.
</P>
<P>
"The U.S. statement reflects more of its concern about whether
Taiwan would move a step further toward embracing the 'four noes'
rather than the current move to change the names of our state-
owned companies," Chiou said.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on the sideline of a spring gathering of senior
govenrment and ruling Democratic Progressive Party officials in
Sanhsia, Taipei County hosted by President Chen, Chiou said the
government will continue communication with U.S. authorities to
let them understand that changing the name of Taiwan's state-
owned companies is not in conflict with the "four noes"
commitments.
</P>
<P>
"We'll reassure U.S. authorities that our government will
continue upholding the 'four noes' commitment," Chiou said.
</P>
<P>
The "flour noes" refer to commitments made by Chen in his 2000
inaugural address, in which he pledged not to declare
independence, not to change the national title, not to push for
inclusion of sovereignty themes in the Constitution, and not to
promote a referendum to change the status quo regarding
independence or unification.
</P>
<P>
Noting that redesignation of state-owned companies is an internal
affairs, Chiou said the government will continue implementing
this policy without any pause.
</P>
<P>
Quoting President Chen's previous statement, Chiou said the
state-own enterprises' name rectification need not be associated
with change of Taiwan's national title.
</P>
<P>
In their respective  board meetings held Friday,  Taiwan's state-
owned Chinese Petroleum Corp. decided to change its name to "CPC
Corp., Taiwan, " China Shipbuilding Corp. decided to change its
name to "CSBC Corp., Taiwan" and Chunghwa Post Co. decided to
change its name to "Taiwan Post Co."
</P>
<P>
The Executive Yuan said the name rectification is mainly aimed at
avoiding confusion resulting from Taiwan-based organizations
carrying similar names to organizations in China.
</P>
<P>
Expressign  concern  about  the  three  Taiwan  state-owned
enterprises' name- change decisions, the U.S. State Department
issued a statement Friday reminding President Chen of the
importance of fulfilling his "four noes" commitments, saying that
the "fulfillment will be a test of leadership, dependability and
statesmanship, as well as ability to protect Taiwan's interests,
its relations with others, and to maintain peace and stability in
the strait."
</P>
<P>
The statement also said that the United States does not support
administrative steps by the Taiwan authorities that would appear
to change Taiwan's status unilaterally or move toward
independence. "The United States does not, for instance, support
changes in terminology for entities administered by the Taiwan
authorities," it added.
