KMT GIVES COLD SHOULDER TO PFP'S CALL FOR SUMMIT
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  Feb. 11 (CNA) 02/11/07  20:02:34 (By Maubo Chang)

Opposition Kuomintang (KMT) lawmakers gave the cold shoulder to
their political allies in the People First Party (PFP) Sunday
over the PFP's call for a summit between the two parties to field
jointly a pair of candidates in the 2008 presidential election.
</P>
<P>
In response to PFP lawmaker Lee Hung-chun's call earlier that day
for a meeting of leaders of the two parties, KMT lawmaker Wu
Chih-yang said that as no PFP politician has thus far expressed
any interest in running in the presidential election only KMT
Chairman Ma Ying-jeou and KMT Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-
pyng are likely to enter the race.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the KMT has its own process to choose candidates, Wu
said the competition between Ma and Wang for the chance to stand
for the presidency on the KMT ticket should be dealt with via
this process,  or through discussions between  the two
contestants themselves, rather than a summit involving current
and former leaders of the KMT and PFP.
</P>
<P>
Wu's statement referred to Lee's suggestion that the summit
include former KMT Chairman Lien Chan, PFP Chairman James Soong
in addition to the two hopefuls of Ma and Wang.
</P>
<P>
KMT lawmaker Hsu Shu-po claimed the summit should be held only
after the KMT chooses its presidential candidate according to its
own rules, adding that a decision reached at a KMT-PFP summit may
not be acceptable to the New Party and the Non-Partisan
Solidarity Union -- two tiny political groups also included in
the "Pan-blue alliance" -- unless they too are invited to the
summit.
</P>
<P>
Another KMT lawmaker, Lai Shih-bao was also not in favor of the
summit, arguing that as the existing alliance between the two
parties has provided both sides with channels of communications,
"there is no point of bypassing these to hold a summit."
</P>
<P>
In addition to the 2008 presidential election, Lee Hung-chun
urged the two parties take advantage of the summit to discuss
putting forth a united front on the ruling Democratic Progressive
Party's push to purge the words "China" and "Chinese" from the
names of all state-own companies, but his call drew a blank from
his KMT counterparts.
