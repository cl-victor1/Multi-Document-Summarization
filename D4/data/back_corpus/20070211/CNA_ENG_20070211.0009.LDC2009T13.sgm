Taiwan's legendary hand puppet show master Huang Hai-tai passed
away at his home in Yunlin, central Taiwan early Sunday. He was
107 years old.
</P>
<P>
Huang checked  into the Yunlin branch of National  Taiwan
University Hospital last month due to the accumulation of fluid
on his lungs as a result of influenza. He had been placed under
intensive care for about 10 days, hospital authorities said.
</P>
<P>
Huang celebrated his 107th birthday in his hometown Jan. 2.
Celebrities attending  his birthday party included Premier Su
Tseng-chang. On that day, the Yunlin County Council passed a
resolution designating the date the "Yunlin Hand Puppet Show Day"
in recognition of Huang's contribution to hand puppet show
development and related traditional folk arts in Taiwan.

<P>
Hand puppetry is not just a choice of entertainment, it helps
preserve traditional theater, sculpture and embroidery. Since
Yunlin started organizing biennial international hand puppet
festivals in 1999, the county has helped revitalize the
traditional art form.
