A close aide of Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng confirmed
Sunday that Wang does not exclude the possibility of his running
the 2008 presidential race "to live up to the people's
expectations."
</P>
<P>
Although running in the presidential race, continuing to be the
legislative speaker and retiring to become a farmer are all
options for Wang in the coming two years, the aide said that
since there are so many voices from the grass- roots calling on
him to run, Wang will probably throw his hat in the opposition
Kuomintang primary after Chinese New Year to try to win the
party's nomination.
</P>
<P>
The aide said once Wang wins in the KMT primaries, he will then
appoint a vice presidential candidate as his running-mate,
hinting that Wang will not be running with KMT Chairman Ma Ying-
jeou on the 2008 KMT presidential ticket, as many have
speculated.
</P>
<P>
Ma, widely viewed as the KMT's best bet in the 2008 presidential
race, has until Sunday said no word about his presidential bid,
although he has intensified grass-roots visits since late last
year.
