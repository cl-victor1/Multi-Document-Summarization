Taichung,  Taiwan,  June  5  (CNA) (By Sofia Wu)
</P>
<P>
A rookie army soldier at the Chengkungling military training center in
the central Taiwan county of Taichung might have died from
meningococcal meningitis earlier this month, health officials said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Lin Jui-hsin, director of the Bureau of Public Health of the Taichung
city government, said Chiu Chieh-chiao, 21, is suspected of having
died from the killer disease.
</P>
<P>
Chiu was rushed to the Chung Shan Medical College Hospital in Taichung
May 31 for emergency treatment and was transferred to China Medical
College (CMC) Hospital early June 1. He died three hours later that
day.
</P>
<P>
Lin said doctors at CMC Hospital suspected that Chiu might have been
infected with the killer virus. Doctors have sent Chiu's blood samples
to the Center for Disease Control under the Cabinet-level Department
of Health (DOH) for analysis.
</P>
<P>
"The disease control center is expected to announce the true cause of
the soldier's death after the examination results come out," Lin said.
</P>
<P>
A young woman in neighboring Changhua County was also confirmed to
have died from the disease in May.
</P>
<P>
Against this background, military authorities have heightened alert
over a possible outbreak of the terrible epidemic. Twenty-four
soldiers at Chengkungling who had close contact with Chiu have been
sent to CMC Hospital for observation.
</P>
<P>
Military authorities said the move was mainly a precautionary measure
to prevent any spread of the disease that is caused by a virus that
can spread through the respiratory tract and via airborne
transmission.
</P>
<P>
DOH officials said there have been 28 confirmed cases of the disease
throughout the island so far this year.
