Taiwan's outgoing deputy representative to the European Union and
Belgium will soon leave for Geneva to assume his new post as
deputy representative to the World Trade Organization (WTO).
</P>
<P>
Wei Ko-ming, a seasoned trade negotiator who once served as
deputy head of the Board of Foreign Trade, will depart Brussels
Friday, ending his more than four years of stint as Taiwan's
second highest-ranking official stationed in the E.U. and
Belgium.
</P>
<P>
Wei is no stranger to WTO affairs as he was deeply involved in
negotiations for Taiwan's WTO accession during his tenure as
deputy director of the Board of Foreign Trade.
</P>
<P>
Wei will fill the post left vacant by John C. Deng who has been
serving as Taiwan's deputy representative to the United States
since late last June.
