The Ministry of Education (MOE) will begin in 2008 an annual
national campaign, marking May 15 as "National Family Day" in a
drive to promote parenthood education, MOE officials said Friday.

With the planned "National Family Day" campaign, the MOE hopes to
assist people in efforts to organize a "healthy and happy"
family, the officials said, indicating that during this year, the
MOE will first work to promote 10 major related programs with the
cooperation of family education centers in cities and counties
around the country.

The programs cover education for the parents of newborns, and
those of pre- school children, elementary schoolchildren or
teenagers, as well as educational assistance to certain families,
including single-parent families, families with members who are
physically or mentally challenged, and families of new
immigrants.
