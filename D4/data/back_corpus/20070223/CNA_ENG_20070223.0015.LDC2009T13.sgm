BACKLOG OF CASES BUILDS AS CONTROL YUAN SEATS REMAIN UNFILLED

Taipei, Feb. 23 (CNA) 02/23/07  17:08:25 (By Sofia Wu)
</P>
<P>
More than 24,000 cases have piled up at the office of the Control
Yuan, which has not been operating since Feb. 1, 2005 because of
the opposition-controlled legislature's refusal to endorse
President Chen Shui-bian's  nominees for seats in the country's
supreme watchdog body.
</P>
<P>
According to Control Yuan administrative staff, 40,000-plus cases
were filed with the watchdog body between February 2005 and
January 2007,  including petitions  from  ordinary  citizens,
public functionaries'  assets disclosure reports,  and cases
involving conflict of interests and political contributions.
</P>
<P>
Some of these cases have been addressed in accordance with a
package of expedient measures approved by former Control Yuan
President Fredrick Chien, but more than 24,000 cases remain in
backlog because they can only be investigated and tackled by
Control Yuan members.
</P>
<P>
Over the past two years, a Control Yuan administrator said, a
spate of high- profile scandals and irregularities  have caused
widespread concern about official corruption and deterioration of
business ethics.
</P>
<P>
Those cases include sales of pork products from sick and dead
hogs, illegal money lending and leaks of confidential personnel
data in the military, controversies surrounding the Kaohsiung
mass rapid transit construction project, "stock vulture" insider
trading, prosecutorial coverup of drug trafficking, and ethical
problems involving judicial personnel.
</P>
<P>
With no Control Yuan members available to probe whether any
government official should be held responsible for dereliction of
duty or violation  of law in those cases,  the Control Yuan
administrator said, people's trust in the government has been
affected.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the official said, 67 cases involving censure or
punishment of individual government employees are pending
approval of Control Yuan members. "Any delay in finalizing probes
into those cases is unfair to all those involved," he added.
</P>
<P>
The absence of Control Yuan members has had an even more serious
result, namely inaction on suspected infractions in assets
disclosure reports by public office holders as well as cases
involving conflict of interests and irregularities in political
donations, the official said, adding that the inaction is like
offering "a legal break" to those who violate various "sunshine
laws" designed to promote clean politics.
</P>
<P>
The official also lamented the large backlog of petitions filed
by individual citizens over alleged infringements on human rights
or personal property rights.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the International Ombudsman Institute (IOI) is one of
the few international organizations that Taiwan has been admitted
to under its official title -- the Republic of China, the
official said Taiwan has missed three IOI meetings over the past
two years because of the absence of Control Yuan members.
According to the official, China has repeatedly tried, although
in vain, to have Taiwan expelled from the organization.
</P>
<P>
Claiming that the Control Yuan has been incapacitated by the
Legislative Yuan's refusal to exercise its power of consent to
the president's nominations to the watchdog body, the official
said the memberless Control Yuan poses an "unprecedented strange
phenomenon in the country's constitutional history."
</P>
<P>
It is keenly hoped that all the Control Yuan seats can be filled
as early as possible to resume the watchdog body's normal
operations in addressing individual  citizens' petitions  and
grievances, protecting their legitimate rights and interests,  as
well as correcting  wrongdoings  of government agencies and
individual officials, and supervising operations of law
enforcement officers.
</P>
<P>
President Chen has agreed to redraw a list of nominees for the
Control Yuan seats and asked various political parties to
recommend qualified candidates. But the opposition "pan-blue
alliance" of the Kuomintang and the People First Party, which
holds a slim majority in the legislature, has so far given a
lukewarm response to Chen's call.
</P>
<P>
With no signs of reconciliation between the ruling and opposition
camps in sight, it remains unclear when the Control Yuan will
resume normal operations, the analysts said.
