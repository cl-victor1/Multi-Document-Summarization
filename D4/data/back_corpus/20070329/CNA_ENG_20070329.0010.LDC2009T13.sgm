</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  March 29 (CNA) 03/29/07  13:31:55 (By Sofia Wu)
</P>
<P>
Peter Arnett, a Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist well known for
his news reporting from the front lines, is set to visit Taiwan
next month at the invitation of the Lung Yingtai Cultural
Foundation, a spokesman of the foundation said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Arnett is scheduled to arrive April 21 for a lecture tour, the
spokesman  said, adding  that  the  New Zealand-American  war
correspondent will deliver a speech, titled "America, from Saigon
to Baghdad Battlefield,  " to share his legendary war zone work
experiences with local youths.
</P>
<P>
The foundation will also arrange for aspiring students to hold
conversations with Arnett to get tips on war zone news coverage,
other special journalistic assignments, world affairs,
developments in the Middle East and other subjects of mutual
interest, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Students from local senior high schools,  universities and
graduate institutes are welcome to file applications with the
foundation before April 10, the spokesman said, adding that 30
vacancies  are  available.  Applications  can  be e-mailed  to
civictaipei@hotmail.com.
</P>
<P>
Arnett first worked for National Geographic magazine, and later
for various television networks, most notably CNN. He is well
known for his coverage of war, including the Vietnam War and the
Gulf War. He was awarded the 1966 Pulitzer Prize in International
Reporting for his work in Vietnam, where he was present from 1962
to 1975, most of the time reporting for the Associated Press news
agency.
</P>
<P>
In 1994,  Arnett published  a book titled "Live from the
Battlefield: From Vietnam to Baghdad, 35 Years in the World's War
Zones."
</P>
<P>
Some of Arnett's early days in journalism were in Southeast Asia,
particularly Bangkok. Eventually he made his way to Vietnam where
he was a reporter for the Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
He went on dozens of missions with troops, including the
traumatic battle of Hill 875 in which a group of soldiers went to
try to rescue another group of soldiers that were stranded in
hostile territory. They themselves were nearly killed during the
rescue. In September 1972, he accompanied a group of U.S. peace
activists to Hanoi, North Vietnam to bring three prisoners of war
back to the United States.
</P>
<P>
Arnett got into trouble for writing in an unvarnished manner when
trying to report the stories of ordinary soldiers and civilians.
This style of writing often was perceived as negative. At the
time, U.S. Gen. William Westmoreland, President Lyndon B.
Johnson, as well as others in positions of power had battles with
the AP over trying to get Arnett removed from his assignment.
</P>
<P>
Arnett was one of the last reporters in Saigon after its fall to
the North Vietnamese Army (NVA) . He met with NVA soldiers who
showed him how they had come into the city.
</P>
<P>
Arnett worked for CNN for 18 years up to 1999. During the 1991
Gulf War, he became a household name worldwide when he became the
only reporter covering the events live directly from Baghdad. His
dramatic reports were accompanied by air raid sirens blaring and
the sound of Baghdad bomb explosions in the background.
</P>
<P>
The week after the start of the war, Arnett was able to obtain an
uncensored interview with Saddam Hussein.
</P>
<P>
In March 1997, Arnett was able to interview Osama bin Laden, as
the first Western journalist to do so.
</P>
<P>
One of Arnett's most controversial reports during the Gulf War
was a report on how the coalition had bombed a baby milk factory.
Shortly after the report, a U.S. Air Force spokesman stated that
"numerous sources have indicated that [the factory] is associated
with biological warfare production".
</P>
<P>
An Iraq survey group visited the facility in May of 2004 and
found that it was inoperable and had been out of operation for
some time prior to the invasion. The plant was searched
extensively, and no evidence was found of production of weapons
of mass destruction (WMD) , although the production facilities
and factory floor were littered with remnants of baby milk
production, including large piles of powdered baby milk.
</P>
<P>
On assignment for NBC and National Geographic, Arnett went to
Iraq in 2003 to cover the U.S. invasion. After a press meeting
there, he granted an interview to state-run Iraq TV on March 31,
2003, in which he stated: "Now, America is reappraising the
battlefield, delaying the war against Iraq, maybe a week, and
rewriting the war plan. The first plan has failed because of
Iraqi resistance."
</P>
<P>
When Arnett's remarks sparked a "firestorm of protest, " NBC
initially defended him, but a day later, NBC, MSNBC and National
Geographic all severed their relationships with Arnett.
</P>
<P>
Later that day, Arnett was hired by the British tabloid newspaper
the Daily Mirror, which opposed the war.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the subsequent developments proved the correctness
of Arnett's prediction about the Iraq war, which also highlighted
his professionalism and guts in challenging mainstream values and
people in power.
