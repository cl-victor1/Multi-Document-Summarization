Two suspects were arrested at Kaohsiung International Airport in
southern Taiwan late Wednesday for allegedly bringing 3.54 kg of
heroin from Thailand, police said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Police said the narcotics, which they described as having a
street value of more than NT$100 million (US$3.03 million), were
concealed in coffee powder bags.
</P>
<P>
Police found the drugs in the luggage of Wang Ching-shun, 53, who
has previous drug convictions, and Yen Hui-ying, 40. The two were
among a tour group of 25 passengers returning from a six-day
visit to Thailand.

As both claimed to know nothing about the drugs, police were
investigating who hired them to serve as mules.
