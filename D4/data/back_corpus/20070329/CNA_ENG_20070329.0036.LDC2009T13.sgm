</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  March  29  (CNA) 03/29/07  21:07:11 (By Flor Wang)

A group of ruling party legislators Thursday visited the National
Communications Commission (NCC), asking the media supervisory
body revoke the license of TVBS -- a cable TV station that
recently aired staged footage featuring a gangster seeking
revenge on a rival thug.
</P>
<P>
Lawmakers of the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) , including
Wang Hsing-nan and Lin Kuo-ching, referred a letter to NCC
Chairman Su Yeong-chin asking the commission to suspend the
operating license of TVBS within three days.
</P>
<P>
According to the group of DPP lawmakers, it was not the first
time that TVBS has been found to broadcast fake footage,
seriously tainting  Taiwan's international  image and creating a
social disturbance.
</P>
<P>
Insisting that TVBS be shut down and that the NCC not just mete
out monetary punishment, the DPP lawmakers said that they will
call for protests in front of the NCC headquarters if it fails to
act decisively.
</P>
<P>
Su promised to unearth the facts behind the incident and called
on local media to be more self-disciplined.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the same issue, main opposition Kuomintang (KMT)
Legislator Joanna C. Lei said that she agrees that the media must
be responsible and better regulated, but argued that political
influence would not help rectify the matter, only hinder freedom
of speech in Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
KMT Legislator Wu Yu-sheng said that the party's legislative
caucus very much regretted news of the fabricated story and added
that the incident has cast a cloud over the local media sector.
</P>
<P>
The media's hunger to score a scoop may be the main reason behind
the TVBS' rash decision to broadcast the video film, Wu said,
calling on media outlets  to be more self-disciplined  while
handling sensationalist incidents and expressing hope that the
NCC would render a fair and impartial judgment in the issue.
