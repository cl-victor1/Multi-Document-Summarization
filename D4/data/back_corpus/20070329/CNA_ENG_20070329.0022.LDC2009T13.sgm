LULIN OBSERVATORY TO INSTALL 2-METER TELESCOPE

Taiwan's first two-meter telescope will be fully operational by
2009 at the Lulin Observatory on Jade Mountain -- the highest
mountain in Southeast Asia -- according to Taoyuan County-based
National Central University (NCU).
</P>
<P>
Daisuke Kinoshita,  assistant  professor  at NCU's Graduate
Institute of Astronomy, emphasized Thursday that once the new
telescope joins the existing array of equipment, the facility's
research capacity will expand a great deal.

<P>
Kinoshita explained that Lulin Observatory at present has a one-
meter telescope -- the largest in diameter in Taiwan -- and the
instrument has helped so far in discovering 11 supernovas,
hundreds of asteroids and dozens of variable stars. However, its
functions are limited to visible light and it lacks full-spectrum
capturing ability.

"Against this backdrop," he added, "the staff often miss the best
observations at the first appearance of novas and comets, while
further research also relies unduly on data provided by other
observatories to cover the shortfall in the images produced by
the one-meter telescope."
</P>
<P>
The two-meter telescope possesses four-fold light-gathering power
compared  with the one-meter,  as well as a set of advanced
instrumentation, including a spectrometer and an infrared camera.
