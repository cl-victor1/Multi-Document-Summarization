Police authorities must quickly arrest the criminal who
threatened to murder a rival thug in news footage that was
broadcast in recent days by several cable TV stations, Premier Su
Tseng-chang said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Su was speaking at a news conference called to assuage public
concern after the footage was aired since Monday. National Police
Administration  Chief Hou Yu-ih, Criminal Investigation Bureau
Commissioner Huang Mao-sui and Government Information Office
Minister Cheng Wen-tsang also were present.
</P>
<P>
Su demanded that police apprehend Chou Cheng-pao  and his
accomplices as soon as possible and urged the media to throw
their support behind the government and the public desire for
better social order. "The media must not pull the plug on
government's effort to fight crime."
</P>
<P>
Noting that improving  social  order has been one of the
government's priorities since he assumed the premiership in March
last year, an angry Su claimed that the orchestrated news footage
could have written off all the hard work of the police and could
have left a terrible impression of public order among the public.
</P>
<P>
"I have also asked the National Communications Commission to deal
with the irresponsible media outlets strictly in accordance with
the law," the premier said.
</P>
<P>
The news footage broadcast by TVBS and other cable TV stations
showed Chou, a criminal from central Taiwan, showing off his
handguns and threatening to murder another gangster boss.
</P>
<P>
The incident provoked debate and stirred up grave public concern
after police discovered that two TVBS reporters helped make the
film. One of the pair was released on bail while the other was
set free on his own recognition after being questioned by the
prosecution early Thursday.
