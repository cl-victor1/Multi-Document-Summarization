Senior immigration officials will be punished for the
disappearance of 200 blank, alien multiple-entry permits,
Ministry of the Interior (MOI) officials said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
According to a press release issued by the MOI's National
Immigration Agency (NIA) , the missing blank re-entry permits for
foreign nationals bear serial numbers from E0076201 - E0076300
and from E0146201 - E0146300.
</P>
<P>
The press release said the missing permits were originally kept
by Chen Fang- ling, a clerk at the immigration agency's service
outpost in Taipei County who has been transferred to another post
following the incident. Chen's direct boss has also been
reassigned to a less senior position.
</P>
<P>
MOI officials said the immigration agency has so far failed to
learn both how the blank permits were lost and why the case was
not immediately reported to police authorities.
</P>
<P>
The NIA officials to be punished will include NIA Director Wu
Chen-chi, Deputy Director Tsai Chen-jung and Chang Tseng-liang,
head of the NIC's Taipei County outpost, MOI officials said.
