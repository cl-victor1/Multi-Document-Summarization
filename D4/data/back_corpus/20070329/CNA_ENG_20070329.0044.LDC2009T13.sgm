The Taiwan Forrest Gump Spirit Society, founded by visually-
impaired marathoner Chang Wen-yen, donated 1,000 pairs of
athletic socks Thursday in a fund-raiser, hoping that these socks
will solicit cash donations which can be used to help physically
and mentally-challenged youths.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the fund-raiser, Chang said that today there are
still children and youths in materially-affluent Taiwan today who
have no proper socks or shoes to wear and so cannot run or engage
in physical exercise.
</P>
<P>
It is hoped that these socks will serve as "minnows which will
attract whales" bringing in enough money that physically  and
mentally-challenged youths not only in the Taipei area but also
in Taichung and Hsichu cities can be helped, Chang said.
</P>
<P>
Donors can also make donations online via the Taiwan Forrest Gump
Spirit Society's e-mail address at: http:www.ahgan.org, Chang
added.
