The tern sanctuary in the outlaying Matsu islands shall be off-
limits to any human activity for half a year from Apr. 1 to
protect the birds, the county government said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Several species of terns come to Matsu to breed during the
summer, so eight uninhabited reefs in the area have been
designated as a sanctuary.
</P>
<P>
Fishermen are allowed to land on these reefs from October to
March to collect shellfish and seaweed, but are prohibited from
doing so for the other half of the year, the county's
construction bureau said.
</P>
<P>
The bureau said traveling to the reefs during the period is
punishable with a fine ranging from NT$50,000 to NT$250,000,
while hunting protected species could bring a sentence of six
months to five years in jail.
