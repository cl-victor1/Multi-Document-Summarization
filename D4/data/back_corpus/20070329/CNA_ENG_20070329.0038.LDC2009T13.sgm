Taipei March,  29 (CNA) 03/29/07  21:37:03 (By Y.C. Jou)

<P>
The Fair Trade Commission (FTC) approved Thursday the acquisition
of community website Wretch.cc by Yahoo! Taiwan Inc. on a
conditional basis, requiring that the web giant not hinder fair
competition in the industry.
</P>
<P>
A merger of Yahoo! Taiwan and Wretch has shown no signs of
disadvantaging competition or distorting the market's
structure,the FTC concluded in a statement.
</P>
<P>
Addressing outcries that the combined market share enjoyed by the
two companies will be too great, a FTC spokeswoman Huang Mei-ying
said that in defining market share in the website industry,
revenues earned from advertising should be used as the major
reference.
</P>
<P>
Citing data published  by Brain Magazine and the Internet
Advertising and Media Association of Taipei (IAMA), widely
consulted in the industry, the FTC estimated that the market
share of Yahoo! Taiwan stands at 57 to 59.54 percent while Wretch
1.67 to 1.75 percent, Huang said.
</P>
<P>
Yahoo! Taiwan's competitors who objected the merger had claimed
that the web pages of the two companies together accounted 80
percent in terms of visitation rates in Taiwan's top 10 websites,
saying the merger would enable Yahoo! Taiwan to manipulate prices
in internet advertising and distort market development.
</P>
<P>
The FTC in a statement added that Wretch is not operating online
shopping or auctions, major services run by Yahoo! Taiwan, and
while the two companies are highly overlapping in their user
population, the mergeris not likely to bring significant changes
to online shopping or online auction markets.
</P>
<P>
Besides, the FTC said that ever changing technologies have been
creating opportunities  for emerging web media to develop new
operation patterns and challenge business leaders, while the
trend of digital  convergence  is also expected  to make
operators  of telecommunications and digital television future
contenders in the field.
</P>
<P>
The FTC said, it therefore had no grounds on which to prohibit
the merger sincethe  overall economic benefit of the merger
outweighs the disadvantages resulted from competition restraint,
as stipulated by Article 12 of the Fair Trade Act.
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, the FTC attached three conditions to its approval of
Yahoo! Taiwan's takeover. First, the company cannot take
advantage of its new market status derived from the merger to
improperly interfere with its competitors' services such as page
linking or e-mail; second, it can not demand that parties trading
with it not deal with other online entities; and third, it can
not impose improper pricing, exclusive deals or other
undertakings that would disrupt fair competition or involve an
abuse of its market advantages.
</P>
<P>
Yahoo! Taiwan announced the merger in December. It has been
reported that the purchase was worth NT$700 million (US$21
million).
