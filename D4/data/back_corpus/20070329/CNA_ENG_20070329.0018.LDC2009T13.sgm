TSU LAWMAKERS DEMAND SUSPENSION OF TVBS BROADCASTING

Taipei,  March 29 (CNA) 03/29/07  17:01:44 (By Flor Wang)

Opposition Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU) lawmakers demanded
Thursday that the authorities suspend TVBS's operations after the
cable TV station shot and broadcast footage of a gangster showing
off his handguns and threatening to murder a rival thug.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a Legislative Yuan news conference, TSU legislative
whip Tseng Tsahn-deng called the TVBS airing of the film a "big
mistake that cannot be forgiven. " He also voiced suspicion that
the TV station is fully funded with Chinese capital and that
broadcasting the footage was aimed at eroding Taiwan's rule of
law and shaking the country's economic stability and development.
</P>
<P>
TSU Legislator Yin Ling-ying accused the National Communications
Commission (NCC) of attempting to cover up the TVBS "mistake, "
and demanded that NCC members step down for negligence and urged
the public to boycott TVBS.
</P>
<P>
TSU Legislator Lin Chih-chia demanded that the NCC, in compliance
with the Satellite Broadcasting Act, impose the harshest
punishment on the TV network.
</P>
<P>
The people should take to the streets if the NCC fails to carry
out its obligations as the country's sole independent supervisor
of the local telecommunications and media industries, Lin said.
</P>
<P>
In contrast to TSU lawmakers' anger over the TVBS handling of the
footage, the opposition People First Party (PFP) urged the
government to face up to the reality  that social  order in
Taiwan is deteriorating and that the government must not use TVBS
as an excuse to hide its incompetence in fighting crime.
</P>
<P>
PFP lawmaker Daniel Y. J. Hwang said the government must not turn
a blind eye to worsening social order by trying to use the TVBS
as an excuse to hide from its own responsibility and to shift
public attention away from its failure to reinforce rule of law.
"Doing so will just make it even more conspicuous," he said.
</P>
<P>
According to initial police investigation, the news footage was
produced by two TVBS reporters stationed in central Nantou
County, who were later detained by cops.
</P>
<P>
One of them was released on bail, while the other was released on
his own recognition after being questioned by the prosecution
early Thursday.
