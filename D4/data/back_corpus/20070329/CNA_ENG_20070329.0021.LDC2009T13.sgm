GANGSTER FOOTAGE REFLECTS PROBLEMS IN MEDIA: JOURNALISTS' GROUP

Taipei,  March  29 (CNA) 03/29/07  18:09:41 (By Deborah Kuo)

The Association of Taiwan Journalists (ATJ) said Thursday that
the filming and televised broadcasting of video footage featuring
a gangster demonstrating an array of firearms and threatening to
kill his estranged boss reflects the chronic problems in Taiwan
media outlets and the journalists they employ.
</P>
<P>
ATJ President Chen Hsiao-yi denounced the recent shooting and
broadcasting of the gangster footage by local cable television
station TVBS Sunday, saying that it exposed the chronic problems
of Taiwan media outlets that fail to verify or check sources
before broadcasting programs and of reckless muckraking for
ratings.
</P>
<P>
Chen said the incident in which TVBS reporter Shih Chen-kang
allegedly filmed the video also reflects that lower-echelon news
workers do not hesitate to compromise their professionalism in
the drive for ratings.
</P>
<P>
The incident has not only destroyed the reputation of a reporter,
it has also left TVBS's journalistic authority and reputation
damaged, Chen said, adding that all members of the media should
conduct serious soul-searching on the matter.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the ATJ head said it is unfair that only the reporter
was fired while his superiors, including the TVBS management,
have got off scot-free.
</P>
<P>
Chen noted that two high-level superiors of a New York Times
reporter who faked a news incident several years ago resigned
after the flap was disclosed.
</P>
<P>
By comparison, she added, members of the TVBS management have
failed to face the impact that the video footage has had on
Taiwan society and the fact that TVBS has sunk to the level of no
more than a tool of criminals.
