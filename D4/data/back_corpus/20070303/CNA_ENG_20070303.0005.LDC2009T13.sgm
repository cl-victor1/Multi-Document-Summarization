ORGANIC LAW FOR LABOR PENSION SUPERVISORY BODY CLEARS LEGISLATURE
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  March 2 (CNA) 03/03/07  11:02:36 (By Sofia Wu)
</P>
<P>
The Legislative Yuan finally passed a bill Friday paving the way
for the establishment of a new body to manage and supervise a
labor pension fund that has been accumulating rapidly since the
launch of a portable pension system in July 2005.
</P>
<P>
The opposition-controlled legislature passed the bill after a
nearly two-year delay. Opposition lawmakers endorsed the bill
only after the Executive Yuan accepted their stance that the new
labor pension fund supervisory commission is defined as a third-
tier administrative organ and thus subject to parliamentary
surveillance.
</P>
<P>
The Executive Yuan originally intended to make the commission a
non-profit corporation,  an arrangement that opposition parties
claimed would exempt the body from legislative supervision.
</P>
<P>
Due to the delay in approving the organic law, the huge labor
pension fund has been deposited at banks because no institution
can manage the fund for better profits or yields.
</P>
<P>
Since the long-sought portable pension system for all wage
earners took effect July 1, 2005, more than 4 million of them
have opted for the new pension system.
</P>
<P>
In line with the portable pension system regulations, local
employers have to deposit a total of about NT$8.2 billion into
their employers' individual retirement accounts (IRAs) per month
and consequently the accumulated labor pension fund has amounted
to NT$120 billion.
</P>
<P>
With the passage of the new bill, a new commission can now be
installed to mange the huge cash stash for higher yields for wage
earners that have opted for the portable pension system.
</P>
<P>
According to the provisions of the newly passed organic law, the
labor pension fund supervisory commission will have 21
commissioners.
</P>
<P>
While the chairman and vice chairman must be appointed in
accordance with the organic law, the remaining 19 commissioners
will be recruited by the Council of Labor Affairs (CLA).
</P>
<P>
The commissioners will include six representatives of various
nationwide labor unions, one representative of employer groups,
10 scholars and experts as well as one representative from both
the Financial Supervisory Commission and the Ministry of Finance.
</P>
<P>
CLA Minister  Lee Ying-yuan  said the labor council  will
immediately start preparations for the establishment of the labor
pension fund supervisory commission now that the newly passed
organic law has provided a legal basis for the new body.
</P>
<P>
If all goes smoothly, Lee said the pension fund supervisory
commission will become operational in six months.
</P>
<P>
Lee also made the assurance that the labor pension fund will have
a 4 percent rate on investment return after the commission begins
formal operations.
</P>
<P>
According to CLA tallies, 4.29 million wage earners had opted for
the portable pension system as of the end of last year,
accounting for 76.82 percent of workers subject to the Labor
Standards Law.
</P>
<P>
The labor pension fund accumulated under the portable pension
system had reached NT$140.7 billion as of Feb. 9, CLA officials
said, adding that the cash stash has all been deposited at banks.
After the supervisory commission becomes operational, the
officials said, the fund  will be used more efficiently through
more profitable investment.
