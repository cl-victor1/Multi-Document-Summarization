Taiwan's first Shaolin cultural center and kungfu school is
scheduled to be constructed in Taipei County's Pinghsi township,
the founder of the Shaolin Development Corp. said at a press
conference Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The corporation's founder, Tzou Yung-hsiang, said the corporation
changed the site from Taoyuan County's Tahsi township to Pinghsi
because the Pinghsi site has 168 hectares available compared to
the two hectares available at the Tahsi location. The site is in
the mountains north of the Pinghsi railway station.
</P>
<P>
The construction, with total investment of about NT$5 billion,
will be completed in 2012. Tzou has commissioned architect Liu
Pei-seng to design the center, which will include the kungfu
school, a "culture street" and other facilities.
</P>
<P>
Tzou said the idea of building the center, the 18th Shaolin
ritual place in the 1,512 years of Shaolin kungfu's history, is
to fulfill the hope expressed by Shaolin Abbot Shih Yongxin
during a 2004 visit to Taiwan. Shih will visit Taiwan again in
July to introduce Shaolin kungfu.
</P>
<P>
Tzou said the center will boost Pinghsi's tourism industry.
