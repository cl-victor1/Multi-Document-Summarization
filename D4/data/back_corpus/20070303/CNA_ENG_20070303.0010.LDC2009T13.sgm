SNIFFER DOGS FIND 78 TONS OF CONTRABAND FARM PRODUCE

Sniffer dogs at Taoyuan International Airport, Taiwan's main
gateway, have managed to detect 78 tons of contraband farm
produce over the past four years, inspection officials said
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Under quarantine regulations, incoming passengers are prohibited
from bringing in fresh vegetables, fruit, live animals and plants
as well as meat (both raw and cooked) and related processed
foodstuffs.
</P>
<P>
However, many local people bring back fresh fruit and meat after
overseas trips. In an attempt to halt the practice, the Bureau of
Animal and Plant Health Inspection and Quarantine (BAPHIQ) under
the Council of Agriculture has installed trash bins along the
walkway leading to immigration and customs counters for arrivals
on international flights.
</P>
<P>
Some people have been willing to dump their contraband,
quarantine officials said, adding that during the just-concluded
Lunar New Year holiday, BAPHIQ- installed garbage cans received
221 kg of discarded fresh farm produce and meat products.
</P>
<P>
To enhance inspection efficiency, the BAPHIQ also employs sniffer
dogs to detect contraband. Over the past four years, the dogs
have sniffed out 55,000 packages of contraband products brought
in by arriving passengers for a total of 78 tons.
</P>
<P>
The confiscated products cover a wide range of items, quarantine
officials said, adding that the most common are South Korean
pears, Japanese apples, European sausages, Chinese hams and meat
dumplings. Various kinds of spices, including Sichuan peppers,
are also frequently discovered in passengers' carry-on luggage.
</P>
<P>
Since October 1998,  the government  has banned individual
passengers from bringing in foreign fresh farm produce and
processed foodstuffs to prevent invasion of exotic animal and
plant viruses, insects and diseases. Violators may be slapped
with fines ranging between NT$30,000 and NT$150,000. However,
customs and quarantine officials have seldom fined rule-breaking
passengers because of such a heavy monetary penalty and have
tended to just confiscate contraband goods.
</P>
<P>
Environmental  activists have blamed customs and quarantine
authorities for lax law enforcement, which they said has
contributed to increasing prevalence of the smuggling of
contraband farm produce and meat products.
</P>
<P>
Against this backdrop, the Council of Agriculture (COA) has
decided to revise the law by cutting the fines to between
NT$3,000 and NT$15,000 per case. Once the proposed amendment
clears the legislature, COA officials said violators will be
fined accordingly in addition to having their contraband goods
confiscated.
</P>
<P>
"It is hoped that the revised rules can be put into force in the
near future," said a COA official.
