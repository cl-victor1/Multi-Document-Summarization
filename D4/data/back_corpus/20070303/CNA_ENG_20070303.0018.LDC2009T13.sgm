CAMBODIAN WIVES OF TAIWANESE PROTEST AGAINST UNFAIR TREATMENT
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  March 3 (CNA) 03/03/07  16:29:51 (By Elizabeth Hsu)

Nearly 20 Cambodian brides of Taiwanese wept Saturday at the
Legislative Yuan while denouncing the Ministry of Foreign Affairs
(MOFA) for depriving them of the "right" to apply for Taiwan
citizenship.
</P>
<P>
The women, mostly carrying their young children, held a press
conference with Wu Shao-wen, secretary-general of the Kaohsiung
County-based TransAsia Sisters Association, and Huang Nai-huei,
chairman of the Foreign Spouse Care Association, to protest
against unfair treatment compared with that of Japanese women who
are married to Taiwanese.
</P>
<P>
Wu stated that under the ROC law of nationality, foreigners must
give up their original nationality before they can apply for
naturalization. However, some countries, including Cambodia,
Thailand and Japan, do not allow their citizens from renouncing
their nationality.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, 22 Japanese wives so far have been naturalized
after their citizenship applications were managed as special
cases, in which they had to prove that the responsibility for
failing to obtain a certificate of renunciation of original
nationality did not rest with them, with the reason for the
failure verified by the MOFA.
</P>
<P>
Wu noted, however, that none of the Cambodian wives in Taiwan
have had the chance to apply for naturalization based on the
Japanese model because the MOFA has refused to grant them similar
verification after declaring that all Cambodian certificates will
be regarded as fake because so many documents from Cambodia are
forged.
</P>
<P>
Currently there are over 2,800 Cambodian wives who have not been
able to obtain citizenship, even though they have been living in
the country for many years, Wu said, adding that the women have
to renew their residence permits every year, while they are also
subject to surprised checks by police attempting to crack down on
illegal immigration.
</P>
<P>
The Cambodian enjoy no protection of their human rights, Wu
claimed.
</P>
<P>
At the news conference, Chen Yueh-mei from Cambodia said she has
lived in Taiwan for seven years and has a six-year-old son and a
two-year-old daughter. In January, she was driven out of her home
by her Taiwanese husband, who has since then banned her from
visiting her children, while refusing to assist her with
residency renewal.
</P>
<P>
She is afraid she will be separated from her children forever if
she is sent back to Cambodia, Chen said.
