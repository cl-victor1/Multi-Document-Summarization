KMT LAWMAKERS DEMAND CORRUPTION CHARGES AGAINST DPP BIGWIGS
</HEADLINE>

Taipei, March 3 (CNA) 03/03/07  14:15:13 (By Flor Wang)

A group of main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) lawmakers have
demanded that embezzlement charges be leveled against several
major figures of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)
over alleged misuse of the president's special "state affairs
fund" while holding Presidential Office posts.
</P>
<P>
KMT lawmakers, including Hsu Shao-ping, Chu Feng-chih, Alex Fei
and Lin Teh-fu, lodged the petition with the Taiwan High
Prosecutor's Office Friday, demanding that prosecutors
immediately indict Vice President Annette Lu, Premier Su Tseng-
chang and Presidential Office Secretary-General Chiou I-jen on
embezzlement charges. Su once served as Presidential Office
secretary-general.
</P>
<P>
The legislators demanded that Chen Jui-jen, a prosecutor with the
anti- corruption center under the Taiwan High Prosecutor's
Office, immediately begin an investigation into the three
officials' alleged false reimbursements from President Chen Shui-
bian's special "state affairs fund" with invoices for the
purchase of personal items.
</P>
<P>
Chen Jui-jen must indict the three DPP heavyweights by applying
the same criteria used in investigating President Chen's alleged
misuse of the "state affairs fund" and former KMT Chairman Ma
Ying-jeou's alleged mishandling of a special municipal allowance
fund assigned every month for his discretionary use during his
two terms as Taipei mayor from 1998-2006, they argued.
</P>
<P>
Prosecutor Chen Jui-jen will face criminal charges of negligence
of duty if he fails to do so, they claimed.
</P>
<P>
Ma resigned from the KMT chairmanship and immediately announced
his presidential bid after he was indicted last month over
alleged misuse of the fund.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Su has unveiled his bid to seek the DPP's nomination
for the 2008 presidential election, while Lu is expected to do
likewise in the coming days. Su was reportedly slated to register
for the DPP's presidential primary March 8.
</P>
<P>
According to the law, the "state affairs fund" is exclusively
budgeted for the president to carry out special missions, such as
purchasing gifts and hosting parties for foreign dignitaries or
dispersing cash bonuses to his aides or security guards.
</P>
<P>
But local media reported  that the president  appropriated
NT$150,000 for Lu and NT$25,000 for Chiou each month, allowing
them to claim expenses for public functions from his special
"state affairs fund."
</P>
<P>
Lu is alleged to have claimed reimbursement from the fund using
receipts for buying preserved cucumbers, garments and books,
while Su was discovered to have made claims to reimburse himself
for the purchase of furniture and books for his home.
</P>
<P>
First lady Wu Shu-jen was indicted by Chen Jui-jen late last year
on embezzlement charges for allegedly using the fund to buy
watches, a diamond ring and expensive scarves.
