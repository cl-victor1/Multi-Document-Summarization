Kaohsiung City's six sister cities will send delegations to join
the city's 2007 Lantern Festival celebrations that start from
March 3 this year, a city government spokesman said Saturday.

According to the spokesman, the six sister cities are Busan in
South Korea, Hachioji in Japan, and Portland, Macon, Colorado
Springs, and San Antonio in the United States. Of these,
delegations from Busan and Hachioji will present musical
performances to visitors to the lantern exhibition.

Hachioji Mayor Ryuichi Kurosu led a delegation of 30 people to
visit Kaohsiung City's river and port; delegations from the
United States also sent official representatives to join the
festival. Kaohsiung City Mayor Chen Chu will feast all the
visiting delegations from sister cities and introduce the city's
development to them.

The spokesman pointed out that Kaohsiung City is entering the
seventh year of its Lantern Festival celebrations, which started
in 2001. Each year's activities have drawn more than five million
people visitors, and have thus brought great benefit to the
city's tourism industry.

The city government is also taking advantage of this opportunity
to promote the World Games 2009 in Kaohsiung City by having 12
animals of the Chinese Zodiac, represented as engaging 12
competition sports from the World games, set up around the "Light
of Eternity", the main theme lantern of this year's festival, the
spokesman said.
