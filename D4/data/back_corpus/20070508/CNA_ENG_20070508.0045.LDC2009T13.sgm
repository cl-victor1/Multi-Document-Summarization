DRIVERS IN TAIPEI URGED TO CURB VEHICLE IDLING

Taipei, May 8 (CNA) 05/08/07  21:40:38 (By Han Nai-kuo)

Taipei Mayor Hau Lung-bin said Tuesday that from May 14, drivers
of all vehicles belonging  to the city government, municipal
schools and organizations will be asked to turn off their engines
while stationary and not let their vehicles idle for longer than
three minutes.
</P>
<P>
The Cabinet-level Environmental Protection Administration (EPA)
announced a plan last week to enforce the Air Pollution Control
Act to curb vehicle idling from Jan. 1 next year, but the mayor
said he wants municipal government agencies to begin the practice
first and set an example for Taipei residents.
</P>
<P>
Officials from the city government's Department of Environmental
Protection said it is time to impose the rule on vehicles engaged
in official duties because the Tainan city government in southern
Taiwan began the practice in October last year.
</P>
<P>
The officials added, however, that police vehicles, garbage
trucks, ambulances and fire trucks will be exempt from the rule.
</P>
<P>
They noted that New York City, the State of California and
Toronto in Canada have all implemented laws stipulating that
drivers idling their vehicles longer than three minutes are
liable to a fine.
</P>
<P>
The officials pointed out that excessive vehicle idling not only
wastes fuel, but can actually damage engine components, in
addition to polluting the environment with exhaust emissions.
</P>
<P>
The EPA has indicated that after the new measure is put into
practice next year, motorists who idle their vehicles longer than
three minutes can be fined between NT$5,000 and NT$100,000 under
Article 31 of the Air Pollution Control Act.
</P>
<P>
For those drivers who are used to warming up their cars, experts
suggested that the best way to warm up a car is by driving it
because, with modern computer- controlled, fuel-injected engines,
a driver needs no more than 30 seconds of idling on winter days
before driving away.
