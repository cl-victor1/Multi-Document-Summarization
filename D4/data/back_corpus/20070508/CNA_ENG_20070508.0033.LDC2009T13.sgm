Ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) Chairman Yu Shyi-kun
said Tuesday that he has no desire to serve as the running mate
of the party's candidate in the 2008 presidential election.
</P>
<P>
Yu made the comments during an interview with a local radio
station in Taoyuan County after former Premier Frank Hsieh won
the DDP's presidential primary Sunday in a vote by party members.
</P>
<P>
Yu, who also took part in the primary, competing with Hsieh, Vice
President Annette Lu, and Premier Su Tseng-chang, said that it is
Hsieh's right to select his running mate and that he personally
has no intention of playing that role.
</P>
<P>
"I do hope that someone else, who possesses complementary
qualities of Hsieh, would take the opportunity to help garner
greater voter backing for Hsieh," Yu said.
</P>
<P>
After Hsieh's win in the party member vote, Lu, Su and Yu
announced withdrawal from the race and threw their support behind
Hsieh in a news conference Monday, calling for party unity to
secure victory in the coming presidential race.
