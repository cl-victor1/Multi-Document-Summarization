Leaders of five of Taiwan's diplomatic allies in Africa will
attend a summit meeting scheduled to held in Taipei in September,
a Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) official said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Jacques Teh-yang Wu, director general of MOFA's Department of
African Affairs, said the five African allies are Burkina Faso,
Malawi, Swaziland, Gambia, and Sao Tome and Principe.
</P>
<P>
Issues to be discussed during the summit will include how to help
the five African countries keep up with the pace of globalization
in the areas of information technology, environmental protection
and energy technology, Wu said.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that China spent about US$20 billion when it
hosted the Forum on China-African Cooperation last year, adding
that such "dollar diplomacy" has posed a major challenge to
Taiwan in its diplomatic work in Africa.
</P>
<P>
Facing such a challenge, Taiwan has excelled in its superb
cooperation programs, Wu said. Moreover, the African allies have
realized that China has failed to deliver on its promises and
that it has an unbridled ambition to exploit Africa's natural
resources.
</P>
<P>
"Overall, the allies have realized the benefits of establishing
relations with Taiwan," he said.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Foreign Affairs James Huang also said recently that
the theme of the summit will be to help Taiwan's allies cope with
the challenges of globalization, with the issues to be discussed
to include the development of solar energy, as well as
biopreservation and ecotourism.
