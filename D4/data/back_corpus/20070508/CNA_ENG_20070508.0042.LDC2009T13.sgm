KMT MULLING LEGAL ACTION AGAINST CABLE TV STATION

Taipei,  May 8 (CNA) 05/08/07  21:13:25 (By Flor Wang)

The opposition Kuomintang (KMT) is weighing legal action against
SET TV, a local cable station, over what it claims is an
"incorrect" documentary recently aired that accuses the party of
massacring Taiwanese people in the 228 Incident of 1947, a KMT
official said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
According to Yang Du, director of the party's Culture and
Communications Committee, the party will demand that the National
Communications Commission, a national watchdog that oversees
local media, properly deal with the station. The party is also
considering suing the station for damages.
</P>
<P>
Yang's remarks came after the United Daily News reported in its
headline news earlier that day that documentary footage used by
SET TV in a special report of the 228 Incident is actually a
segment depicting executions of communists in Shanghai by KMT
troops in 1948 during the Chinese civil war.
</P>
<P>
SET TV has misrepresented the footage to pin the blame on the
KMT, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
The "false fabrication" of historical events reflects a deep lack
of journalistic professionalism and basic ethics by local media
outlets, Yang said.
</P>
<P>
Using such methods to mislead the public and create hatred of the
KMT has dealt a serious blow to the party, Yang said.
