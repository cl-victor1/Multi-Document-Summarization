Taiwan's reliance on the United States for its exports has
decreased, but its reliance on Asia has increased, the Ministry
of Finance (MOF) said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Statistics released by the MOF showed that Taiwan's exports to
the United States accounted for 23.42 percent of its total
exports in 2000, but the ratio slipped to 14.67 percent in 2005,
14.45 percent in 2006 and 13.44 percent in the first four months
this year.
</P>
<P>
In comparison, Taiwan's exports to Asia accounted for 52.07
percent of its total exports in 2000. Over the last two years the
ratio hit 65.03 percent in 2005, and 65.5 percent in 2006. The
ratio in the first fourth months of 2007 was 65.83 percent.
</P>
<P>
Among Taiwan's Asian exports, those to Hong Kong and mainland
China increased to 39.81 percent in 2006 from 24.44 percent in
2000, 26.61 percent in 2001 and 39.15 percent in 2005. The ratio
was 39.36 percent in the first four months this year.

<P>
Finance officials attributed the diminished reliance on the U.S.
market and increased reliance on Asian market to the booming
economic development in Asian countries.
