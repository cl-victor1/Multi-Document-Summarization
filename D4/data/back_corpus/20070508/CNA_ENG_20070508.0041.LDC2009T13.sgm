A strict police crack down on traffic violations effectively
lowered the traffic accidents related death rate and reduced
insurance claims in 2006 on a year-on- year basis, a National
Police Agency (NPA) officer said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The officer reported that the number of traffic violations dealt
with by police increased from 10.41 million in 2005 to 10.64
million in 2006, but insurance claims on traffic accidents
dropped by NT$300 million (US$9.02 million).
</P>
<P>
Most of the increased cases of traffic violations were related
with speeding and parking irregularities, the officer said,
adding that violations on the wearing of motorcycle helmets
increased 46 percent, while seat belt violations moved up 35
percent, and drunk driving increased 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
The officer said that the NPA will focus on helmet violations in
future clampdown, for most traffic death in Taiwan are due to
motorcycle accidents.
</P>
<P>
Reductions in insurance claims are significant in terms of more
than just the money saved: it also means that fewer people will
be hurt or killed in traffic accidents, and more families remain
intact, the officer said.
</P>
<P>
The officer added that NPA Director-general Hou Yu-ih will
accompany Sha Ko- hsing, secretary-general of the Non-Life
Insurance Association of the R.O.C., to call on Interior Minister
Lee Yi-yang to express gratitude on behalf of the association for
the hard work of the police.
