12 BANKS IN TAIWAN REQUIRED TO INCREASE CAPITAL OR ELSE
</HEADLINE>

The Cabinet-level Financial Supervisory Commission (FSC) has
asked 12 banks in Taiwan to submit plans to inject fresh funds
and increase their capital, FSC Chairman Hu Sheng-cheng said
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Answering a question from an opposition lawmaker at a meeting of
the Legislative Yuan's Finance Committee, Hu said the
government's finance regulatory bodies will examine the capital
increase plans before deciding whether they are reasonable and
acceptable.
</P>
<P>
Hu was responding to Lee Chi-chu, a Kuomintang legislator, who
raised the point that one-quarter of the banks in Taiwan have
suffered losses exceeding one-third of their paid-in capital, and
that according to Article 64 of the nation's Banking Law, these
banks must increase their capital within three months.
</P>
<P>
Without naming the 12 banks, Lee urged the government to fulfill
its oversight responsibility by ordering the banks to replenish
their capital by injecting new funds, as failure to do so could
lead to a government takeover.
</P>
<P>
Article 64 of the Banking Law -- an amendment passed in March --
says any bank whose losses exceed one-third of its capital must
immediately  report its financial  condition to the regulatory
authorities, which will order the bank to replenish its funds. If
the bank fails to do so within three months, the government will
take over its operations.
