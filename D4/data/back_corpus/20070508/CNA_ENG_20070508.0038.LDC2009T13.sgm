The majority of people in Taiwan support the government's
decision to reject China's offer to include Taiwan in the 2008
Olympic torch relay as a stop on its domestic route, according to
the results of asurvey released Tuesday by the Mainland Affairs
Council (MAC).
</P>
<P>
A total of 61.1 percent of the respondents to the survey said
Taiwan should not accept any torch-relay plans that would
downgrade its status as a sovereign country, with 64.2 percent
expressing disapproval of China's plan to include Taiwan as the
first stop of a "domestic" torch-relay route for the 2008 Olympic
Games and its reference to Taiwan as "Taipei, China" which
implies Taiwan is part of China.
</P>
<P>
However, they were split over whether Taiwan should negotiate
with China over the issue, with the ratios of people for and
against the idea accounting for 42.7 percent and 45.7 percent,
respectively.
</P>
<P>
According to China's plan, the Olympic torch would travel from
Vietnam's Ho Chi Minh City to Taipei and then continue on to Hong
Kong, Macau and several other Chinese cities before arriving in
the host city, Beijing.
</P>
<P>
The government rejected the offer last month on the grounds that
the proposed route purposely downgrades Taiwan's status to that
of a local administrative region of China.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile,  on an economic and cultural forum between the
opposition Kuomintang and the Communist Party of China held late
last month in Beijing, 59.2 percent of the respondents said the
consensus reached  by  the  forum  cannot  be realized   without
government-to-government negotiations.
</P>
<P>
On the World Health Organization (WHO) Secretariat's refusal to
process Taiwan's application for membership on the grounds that
"Taiwan is not a sovereign country, " 84.7 percent of the
respondents said the way the WHO has handled the matter is
unreasonable, and 87.7 percent said the government should
continue to promote the country's bid to join the WHO under the
name of "Taiwan."
</P>
<P>
The survey was conducted by Berkeley Opinion Research Ltd. for
the MAC from May 4-6 via telephone among 1,067 people aged
between 20 and 69. It had a margin of error of 3 percentage
points.
