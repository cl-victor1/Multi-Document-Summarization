KMT CHAIRMAN SUGGESTS MA, WANG MEET FIRST
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  May 8 (CNA) 05/08/07  19:49:20 (By Flor Wang)
</P>
<P>
Main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Wu Po-hsiung  suggested
Tuesday that the party's two presidential hopefuls meet first to
build a tacit understanding over their bids before he and
Honorary Chairman Lien Chan help mediate over the details at a
later time.
</P>
<P>
Wu made the remarks while answering reporters' questions after
bigwigs of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) ,
including Vice President Annette Lu, Premier Su Tseng-chang and
DPP Chairman Yu Shyi-kun -- all of whom vied for the party's
nomination -- Monday pledged their full support to former Premier
Frank Hsieh, who won the party's presidential primary Sunday in a
vote by party members.
</P>
<P>
Stating that the DPP's swift consolidation should give KMT
members "pause for thought, " Wu said that his predecessor,
former Chairman Ma Ying-jeou, who was nominated last week by the
KMT as its presidential candidate,  stands firm in his promise to
invite Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng to serve as his
running mate.
</P>
<P>
Wu expressed the hope that Ma and Wang would first contact each
other to boost their mutual understanding and said that he and
Lien would get involved in mediation at an appropriate time "in
the near term."
</P>
<P>
Wu called on the public not to pressure Wang over a proposed
presidential ticket with Ma, and urged Wang to pay more heed to
the opinions of the party's rank and file.
</P>
<P>
Hsieh's emergence as the DPP's presidential candidate has put
greater pressure on the KMT, members of which are hoping for a
Ma-Wang meeting, or a meeting involving the four party leaders as
soon as possible to settle upon their 2008 presidential election
strategies.
</P>
<P>
But Wang, who has been low-key about his willingness to form a
Ma-Wang presidential ticket, said a day earlier that no one from
Ma's camp has yet contacted him on the issue.
