The quasi-official Taiwan External Trade Development Council
(TAITRA) is planning to establish a special zone for Central
American states that have signed free trade agreements (FTAs)
with Taiwan to display their products during the upcoming Taipei
food exhibition, a TAITRA official said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
According to the official, Panama, Guatemala and Nicaragua have
agreed in principle  to send delegations  to the 2007 Taipei
International Food Show, scheduled for June 21-24.
</P>
<P>
During the three-day exhibition, manufacturers from the three
diplomatic allies will display various products, including
coffee, sweet wine, seasoning, dried fruit, ostrich meat, frozen
beef and cigars, the official said.
</P>
<P>
As most of the prospective exhibitors from the three countries
have neither experience in exporting products to Taiwan nor trade
agents, the official said, CETRA will organize a face-to-face
consultation meeting June 22 so that they can seek agents in
Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Those wishing to serve as agents are welcome to attend the
meeting, the official went on.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, TAITRA is also inviting El Salvador and Honduras,
which signed a multilateral FTA with Taiwan May 7, to participate
in the exhibition, according to the official.
