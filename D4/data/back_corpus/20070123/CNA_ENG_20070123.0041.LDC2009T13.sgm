Before the Taipei International Book Exhibition 2007 kicks off
Jan. 30, the organizer -- the Taipei Book Fair Foundation (TBFF)
-- has launched activities aimed at promoting reading across
Taiwan through cooperation with local libraries and bookstores.
</P>
<P>
The exhibition will be held at the Taipei World Trade Center
halls, featuring Russian culture, philosophy, writers, movies,
arts, and lifestyles, the foundation said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Before the annual event starts, the public can learn about
Russian literature and culture at Eslite and Kingstone
bookstores, as well as other bookshops, the foundation said.
</P>
<P>
The foundation pointed out that it began collaborating with the
two large bookstore chains in the previous year in the promotion
of reading, adding that the collaboration has borne fruitful
results.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the foundation took a step further to work with Taipei
City's public libraries, Taoyuan County's Cultural Affairs
Bureau, and other bookstores and publishers.
</P>
<P>
This year, the foundation plans to invite even more libraries,
bookstores, and social groups to participate in the drive to
increase the influence of the fair.
</P>
<P>
This year also marks the first time the foundation has worked
with Yilan County government's education bureau in promoting
reading for schoolchildren in remote areas, according to the
foundation.
