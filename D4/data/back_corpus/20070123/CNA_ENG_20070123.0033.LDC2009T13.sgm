<P>
The Center for Disease Control (CDC) confirmed Tuesday that a man
aged 46 died Jan. 2 after contracting influenza, the first
patient to die of severe complications caused by flu this year,
and the second since the beginning of this winter.
</P>
<P>
The man suffered multiple myeloma and had a history of allergies.
He was reported to be infected with flu Dec. 26 and was admitted
to hospital the next day, where he was at once sent to the
intensive care unit.
</P>
<P>
CDC Deputy Director-General Shi Wen-yi said the patient's immune
system was weak due to chemotherapy for his myeloma and that he
had been reluctant to be vaccinated against flu.
</P>
<P>
According to CDC statistics, since the winter's approach, clinics
and hospitals around the country have reported a total of 84
serious flu cases, with 18 cases confirmed.
</P>
<P>
The dominant virus for the cases is influenza B, which caused the
death of an 18 -year-old university student in the southern
county of Kaohsiung in December.
</P>
<P>
The CDC has warned of a constant increase in the number of
influenza-like illness (ILI) cases. According to data from the
CDC's point-to-point monitoring system, the consultation rate for
ILI reported by sentinel physicians in the past week recorded
5.77 percent, posing a growth of 4.3 percent compared with the
level a week ago, and a 56.9 percent rise year on year.
</P>
<P>
The CDC predicted a flu peak in the next two weeks.
