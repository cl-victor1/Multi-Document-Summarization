Taipei,  Jan. 23 (CNA) 01/23/07  19:59:10 (By Flor Wang)

Main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Ma Ying-jeou visited
Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jing-ping, a KMT stalwart, Tuesday,
with the two agreeing not to change the name of the party and to
include several key bills in a proposed extra legislative
session.
</P>
<P>
Ma met Wang at Wang's official residence for an hour and a half
as the two exchanged views on issues related to a proposed KMT
name change, the draft Organic Law of the Central Election
Committee (CEC) , creation of a formal alliance between the KMT
and the People First Party (PFP) , holding an extra legislative
session and the government's expenditure bill.
</P>
<P>
The Legislative Yuan ended its latest session Jan. 19 amid open
fighting between the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)
and KMT lawmakers over the draft CEC Organic Law, which was to be
the first issue addressed.
</P>
<P>
Speaking following his meeting with Wang, Ma said that the KMT
will not alter its official designation although some party
members did raise such a proposal.
</P>
<P>
According to the KMT chairman, a senior party member made the
proposal to him at a seminar last week in southern Taiwan, to
which he replied that it would be better to discuss the issue
after the KMT regains power.
</P>
<P>
This does not mean that the party will definitely change its name
if it wins the next presidential election, he stated, pointing
out that there has been a noticeable misinterpretation of what he
meant regarding the party name change issue.
</P>
<P>
Ma also denied a rampant rumor that he has a "sore point" with
Wang, claiming that he has long shared with the legislative head
the idea that a capable opposition party must rationally and
effectively check and balance the administration.
</P>
<P>
Regarding a proposal to call an extra legislative session on Jan.
29 to continue dealing with several significant bills and issues
that remained unresolved, Ma revealed that the KMT will soon
discuss the matter with the PFP.
</P>
<P>
If the proposed extra legislative meeting is held beginning Jan.
29, the KMT agrees to screen about 20 key issues and bills,
including the draft CEC Organic Law and the government
expenditure bill on which ruling and opposition lawmakers have
forged common ground.
</P>
<P>
For his part, Wang voiced his support for the proposed formation
of a formal KMT-PFP alliance, saying that the two parties have to
demonstrate an ability to accomplish their aims to satisfy their
supporters' high expectations.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, KMT lawmakers seem unhappy with Ma's shifting in his
insistence that the draft CEC Organic Law be listed as the top
priority in the extra legislative session's agenda following his
meeting with Wang.
</P>
<P>
KMT lawmaker Lee Chia-chin opined that the KMT's caucus at the
Legislative Yuan must not give way to the DPP over the draft law
on the grounds that DPP lawmakers went so far as to resort to
violence to block a vote on the draft law during the Jan. 19
meeting.
</P>
<P>
Lee suggested that the KMT legislative caucus hold a meeting to
forge a consensus if it is genuinely going to relax its stand in
this regard.
</P>
<P>
Lee said that he does not feel it necessary to call an extra
legislative meeting as the next meeting is slated to open in
February.
</P>
<P>
KMT lawmaker Lai Shyh-bao contended that if the DPP does not want
the KMT to place the draft law at the top of the agenda, it too
must compromise by agreeing to finish dealing with the draft CEC
Organic Law during the proposed extra session.
</P>
<P>
Another KMT lawmaker Huang Chao-shun urged her party not to
insist on first dealing with the draft law in the extra
legislative session, because the KMT must act rationally for the
sake of public interests and because the public are watching.
