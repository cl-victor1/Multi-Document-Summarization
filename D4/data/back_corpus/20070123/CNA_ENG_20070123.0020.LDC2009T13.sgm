VATICAN URGED NOT TO YIELD ITS PRINCIPLES IN CONTACTS WITH CHINA

Taipei,  Jan.  23 (CNA) 01/23/07  16:57:24 (By Elizabeth Hsu)

Taiwan exhorts the Vatican not to easily give up its principles
of "divine construction" and "religious freedom" while seeking
normalization of engagements with Beijing, the spokesman of the
Ministry of Foreign Affairs said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
David C. Y. Wang made the call in response to media inquiries
after the Vatican announced the establishment of a committee of
Chinese affairs following a weekend high-level meeting on issues
concerning Holy See-China ties.
</P>
<P>
The Vatican has also urged China to engage in a "constructive"
dialogue.
</P>
<P>
Wang said it is understandable that the Holy See has been sparing
no efforts to better engage China for the sake of millions of
Chinese faithful.
</P>
<P>
However, Beijing has been insisting that the Vatican break off
official ties with Taiwan before opening an embassy in China.
Such a request reflects Beijing's insincerity in matters
concerning the millions of Chinese who are denied the exercise of
religious freedom in their acts of worship, Wang noted.
</P>
<P>
Wang said that according to a statement  released by the
Secretariat of State of the Holy See Saturday on its future
relations with Beijing, the Holy See still holds tightly to its
principles on the issue, which includes an insistence that only
the pope -- not a local church -- has the power to appoint
bishops, and that it will not yield on so crucial a point as the
religious freedom of Chinese Catholics in China.
</P>
<P>
At present, around 15 million of Catholics in China are allowed
to worship only within the state-sanctioned church, the Chinese
Patriotic Catholic Association.
</P>
<P>
Wang also indicated that the communications between Taiwan and
the Vatican are free and unobstructed.
