<P>
The Center for Disease Control (CDC) confirmed Monday Taiwan's
first imported malaria case of this year.
</P>
<P>
CDC officials said the patient, a 48-year-old man, went to
Madagascar, located off the southeastern coast of Africa, Jan.
1-18 on a business trip. He developed high fever Jan. 4 and
sought medical treatment after his return to Taiwan Jan. 19. The
hospital alerted the CDC after suspecting that he had contracted
malaria.
</P>
<P>
The officials noted that the center received notification of 132
confirmed malaria cases between 2002 and 2006, with 130 of those
being imported cases, mainly from Indonesia, the Solomon Islands,
Myamar and Malawi.
</P>
<P>
Since Taiwan rooted out the mosquito-borne disease in 1965, most
of the malaria cases have been imported, with an average of about
30 such cases per year.
