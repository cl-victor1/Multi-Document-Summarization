Taipei, Jan. 23 (CNA) 01/23/07  19:55:42 (By Elizabeth Hsu)

Premier Su Tseng-chang attended an official ceremony held Tuesday
at the Hualien railway station to celebrate the delivery of
tilting trains fabricated by a Japanese company under contract to
the Taiwan Railway Administration (TRA).
</P>
<P>
The new trains, named "Taroko," will be commissioned to run
between Taipei and the eastern county of Hualien, which is
separated by mountains from the economically-flourishing west.
The TRA revealed that the special trains can significantly reduce
the time required to travel from the capital city to the east.
</P>
<P>
In his address, Su said railway transportation between the west
and east is expected to undergo a significant change after the
new trains, which will allow passengers in Taipei to travel to
Hualien within two hours, begin operating in March as scheduled.
</P>
<P>
In the future, the eastern county, famous for scenic landscapes,
is expected to flourish economically as the new infrastructure
helps bring in more tourists, said Su, who rode the Taroko to
Hualien for the ceremony, along with Hualien County Magistrate
Hsieh Shen-shan, Minister of Transportation and Communications
Tsai Duei and TRA Director-General Chen Yi-nan, and several
lawmakers and Hualien county councilors.

The Executive Yuan agreed to the TRA purchase of tilting trains,
also called free-go trains, in March 2003. Chen said compared
with traditional trains, the tilting trains can run at a speed of
20-25 km per hour faster on curves.
</P>
<P>
As a traditional train rounds a curve at speed, passengers
experience centrifugal force because their inherent momentum
forward no longer lies along the line of the train's course. This
normally causes packages to slide about on the floor and people
seated to feel squashed against their neighbors or outboard
armrest.
</P>
<P>
Tilting trains are designed to counteract such discomfort by
tilting several degrees in the direction of the curve,  thus
compensating for the centrifugal force.
