The Council of Agriculture (COA) Monday expressed concern over
the low price of Taiwanese oranges in China, calling on Chinese
dealers to act in accordance with market mechanisms.
</P>
<P>
Several Chinese companies, in cooperation with China's State
Council Taiwan Affairs Office, recently offered to buy a total of
1,200 metric tons of Yunlin County oranges for which there was no
domestic market given a glut of oranges in Taiwan. The first
60-ton batch has arrived in Shanghai and will be sold for around
RMB$6.6 per kilogram, according to the Shanghai Fruit Company.
</P>
<P>
The depressed price has sparked an outcry from Taiwanese fruit
merchants in Shanghai, who criticized the Shanghai Fruit Company
for deliberately bringing the price down to an unreasonable
level.
</P>
<P>
The market order will be disrupted, said Lin Chi-hung, a
Taiwanese merchant. He said the oranges he imported from Taiwan's
Nantou County are sold around RMB$14 per kilo at supermarkets in
Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
In response to the situation, the COA said it welcomes any
political party or organization willing to help expand foreign
markets and benefit Taiwan's fruit growers, however, if civil
organizations cooperate with Chinese authorities and suppress
prices through political manipulation, the operations of the
market will be hindered and Taiwan's agriculture harmed.
</P>
<P>
The cross-strait purchase was made possible by the opposition
Kuomintang (KMT), which sent delegates to Beijing earlier this
month after its chairman Ma Ying- jeou heard complaints of Yunlin
fruit growers about the orange glut.
