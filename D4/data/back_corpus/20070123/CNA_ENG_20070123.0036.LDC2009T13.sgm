The Ministry of Education (MOE) will step up diversified cultural
education amid the increasing number of mixed-race children at
local schools, an official said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Pan Wen-chung, director of the MOE's Department of Elementary
Education, made the remarks at a two-day conference being held in
central Nantou County. City and county education bureau chiefs
from across the country are attending the conference.

According to the ministry, the number of children born to foreign
mothers who are studying at local elementary schools and junior
high schools reached 80,000 last year. The figure is likely to
exceed 150,000 in 2009.

Citing statistics from the Ministry of the Interior, Pan said
that one in every 6.6 marriages in Taiwan involves a foreign
spouse. The rising number of foreign spouses has had a noticeable
impact on Taiwan's society and culture, he added.
</P>
<P>
"Against this backdrop,  the government has attached great
importance to their children's education and their abilities to
integrate into Taiwan's culture," Pan noted.
</P>
<P>
From this year through 2011, Pan said, the MOE will launch
various measures to promote diverse cultural education and
support packages for mixed-race children.
</P>
<P>
For instance, he said, the ministry will give these children
priority in entering public elementary  schools' kindergartens,
combine social workers and resources to provide assistance, and
organize parent-child education activities and seminars on
diverse cultures for teachers.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the ministry will assist elementary schools and
junior high schools in organizing activities to educate students
about other cultures as part of efforts to promote cultural
exchanges and integration.
