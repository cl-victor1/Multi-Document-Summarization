CHINA HAS DEPLOYED 980 MISSILES AGAINST TAIWAN
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  Jan.  23 (CNA) 01/23/07  21:46:49 (By Lilian Wu)

China has deployed about 980 missiles, positioned so that the
whole of Taiwan is within their range, the Ministry of National
Defense (MND) said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Maj. Gen. Wang Cheng-hsiao, an MND intelligence official, noted
that China had 190 ballistic missiles in 1996, a number that
increased by 50 every year until the number reached 540 in 2003.
</P>
<P>
He said China then increased production and upgraded the capacity
of the missiles, adding that 880 strategic ballistic misiles and
over 100 cruise missiles are presently deployed.
</P>
<P>
He said Taiwan's military has continued to upgrade its combat
readiness and combat capacity should China launch a first-strike
attack, and that in the event of a Chinese missile attack,
advanced jetfighters would be hidden in hangars or bunkers so
that the air force would retain at least part of its combat
capacity.
</P>
<P>
He disagreed with Bernard Cole, a professor of the National War
College in Washington, who expressed concern in an article that
Taiwan's air force could lose its air superiority in the Taiwan
Strait as it has not moved forward while China's air force has
been improving by leaps and bounds. Were China to launch a first
round of missile attacks, the air force would no longer be able
to provide adequate air defense, according to Cole.
</P>
<P>
Maj. Gen. Ke Hsi-hsiung, deputy director of the MND's Integrated
Assessment Office, claimed that China's missiles are not as
precise as has been thought.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan's military intelligence believes that if China attacks
with 70 percent of its missiles, Taiwan would retain over 50
percent of its combat capacity, Ke said, although he added that
the figure could rise to more than 70 percent if measures to
protect combat capacity are taken. He did not elaborate.
