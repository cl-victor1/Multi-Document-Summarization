Council of Agriculture (COA) Minister Su Jia-Chyuan said Tuesday
that stepping up marketing of agriculture produce at home and
overseas will be one of the council's major tasks this year.
</P>
<P>
Su made the remarks during a news conference to report on the
performance of the COA over the past year and its prospects for
this year.
</P>
<P>
Su said the COA has set the goal of increasing Taiwan's
agriculture produce export value by 20 percent within three
years.
</P>
<P>
The COA will also promote a project to market Taiwan's fruits,
including an activity of selecting the nation's top 10 classic
fruits, Su said.
</P>
<P>
Increased protection of agricultural intellectual property rights
will also be one of the council's priorities, he added.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the COA handled 79 technology transfer cases last
year, up 93 percent from the previous year, with technology
transfer revenue totaling NT$32.53 million (US$991,770) , up 116
percent from the year-earlier figure. The COA will continue its
efforts in this regard, with the hope of achieving technology
transfer revenue growth of 300 percent within three years, he
added.
</P>
<P>
He noted that when Taiwan joined the World Trade Organization
(WTO) five years ago, many had expressed concerns that Taiwan's
agricultural sector would collapse. But with the concerted
efforts of the government  and the people,  the production value
of the agricultural  sector and the household income of farmers
have increased rather than decreased since Taiwan's accession to
the WTO in January 2002, he said.
</P>
<P>
The production value of the agriculture sector in 2006 has
initially been estimated at NT$380.3 billion,  representing an
increase of 8 percent over the figure for the year prior to
Taiwan's WTO entry, he said.
