opportunities per year, Environmental Protection Administration

According to EPA tallies, Taiwan recycles 150,000 metric tons of
glass containers per year, or the equivalent of 300 million
600-ml alcohol bottles, which can be used to reproduce glass
containers, become an ingredient in the manufacture of bricks, or
an aggregate in asphalt.

EPA officials said the country imports or manufactures more than
240,000 metric tons of glass containers per year and that almost
all of these are recyclable with the exception of some colored
glass products.

The electricity conserved by reproducing glass products from used
glass containers is enough to run 730,000 households for a month,
the officials said.
