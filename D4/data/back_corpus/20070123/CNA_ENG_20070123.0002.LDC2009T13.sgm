National Chiayi University (NCYU) in southern Taiwan has sent 50
second-hand computers to the Republic of China Embassy in
Paraguay for donation to schools in that country, NCYU President
Lee Min-jen said Monday.

The ROC Embassy presented these computers to schools in Paraguay
at a donation ceremony hosted recently by ROC Ambassador David
Hu, Lee said.

According to Lee, the university started working toward the
donation of old computers in August 2006. The school's Computer
Center installed software in Spanish on these computers to
benefit teachers and students in Paraguay. Schools in Paraguay
expressed their sincere gratitude for this generosity.

Universidad Nacional de Asuncion, one of the schools accepting
donated computers, is NCYU's sister school, Lee said, adding that
the school's president, Ing. Pedro Gonzalez, showed his thanks
for NCYU's donation at the ceremony, saying that the computers
function very well and will be used to improve library
information facilities.

NCYU's donation was reported by Paraguay's local press, including
ABC Color, and Ultima Hora, Lee said.
