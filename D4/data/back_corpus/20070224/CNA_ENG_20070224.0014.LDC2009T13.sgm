KMT-PFP ALLIANCE MULLING TASK FORCE TO COUNTER DPP TACTICS
</HEADLINE>

Taipei, Feb. 24 (CNA) 02/24/07  18:12:35 (By Flor Wang)
</P>
<P>
In response to a name change campaign and a new constitution
drive rekindled by the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)
, the People First Party (PFP) and the main opposition Kuomintang
(KMT) are considering setting up a task force to tackle the DPP's
electioneering offensive, a core PFP aide said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
According to the aide, the KMT-PFP alliance, established in
January, will study ways to fight the DPP's ideological tactics
aimed at reinforcing "deep green" voter support in the December
legislative elections and the March 2008 presidential polls.
</P>
<P>
As the KMT-PFP alliance vowed in its founding declaration to play
a key stabilizing force in case of contingencies across the
Taiwan Strait, the two parties will not sit idly by should the
DPP try to rehash ideological issues to fuel confrontation in
society and shift public attention away from its corruption
scandals, the aide said.
</P>
<P>
The KMT-PFP alliance's planned task force is expected to focus on
observing the cross-strait situation and political developments
at home so as to prevent the DPP from scoring political points,
the aide said.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, PFP spokesman Lee Hung-chun said a day
earlier that the PFP insists that no matter whether former KMT
Chairman Ma Ying-jeou or Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng
represents  the  opposition  "pan-blue alliance"  in the next
presidential election, whoever is picked must also be endorsed
and jointly fielded by the KMT-PFP alliance.
</P>
<P>
The KMT, the PFP and the New Party are partners in the loose
"pan-blue alliance" against the pro-independence DPP and the
Taiwan Solidarity Union.
</P>
<P>
Although PFP Chairman James Soong is currently in the United
States, Lee said that Soong has been carefully watching political
developments in Taiwan but is in no hurry to pledge his support
for either Ma or Wang.
</P>
<P>
Soong will cautiously gauge which of the two he will support
despite the fact that Ma seems to enjoy a comfortable lead over
Wang, Lee said.
</P>
<P>
Lee quoted PFP lawmakers as expressing worry that Ma's public
approval ratings might continue to drop after he was indicted on
corruption charges earlier this month over his alleged
mishandling of a special municipal fund allocated for his
discretionary use during his eight-year term as mayor of Taipei
from 1998 to 2006.
</P>
<P>
Under the terms of an accord clinched by the KMT and the PFP upon
forming their alliance, the two parties must closely cooperate in
the coming legislative and presidential elections, which is the
reason behind the PFP's insistence that any "pan-blue" candidate
hoping to run in the 2008 presidential race must also be approved
by the new KMT-PFP alliance.
