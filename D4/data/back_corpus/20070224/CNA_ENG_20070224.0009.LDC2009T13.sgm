Total trade at Taiwan's five free trade zones (FTZs) reached
NT$15 billion (US$455 million) for 2006, an encouraging figure
that has led the government to take more active steps to try to
attract more foreign investment in the FTZs, the vice chairman of
the Council for Economic Planning and Development said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Yeh Ming-feng revealed that relevant officials, including those
at the Ministry of Economic  Affairs  and the  Ministry  of
Transportation and Communications, have been working together to
come up with new incentives to attract businesses to invest in
the FTZs.
</P>
<P>
The  planned  incentives  will  target  businesses  in the
international logistics,  manufacturing  and technical services
sectors,  Yeh said, noting that his council believes the new
incentives will bring in a "considerable" amount of investment
which is expected to create numerous job and trade opportunities.

<P>
As part of efforts to attract more foreign investment, Yeh
further said, the officials also plan to organize at least 13
presentations  overseas this year to introduce  the investment
environment in Taiwan's FTZs.
</P>
<P>
According to the council's statistics, as of the end of January,
there were a total of 93 businesses based in the FTZs, which are
situated at the Taipei and Keelung ports in northern Taiwan, the
Taichung port in central Taiwan, and the Kaohsiung port in the
south, as well as at Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport.

<P>
As of the end of 2006, total investment in the FTZs had surpassed
NT$9.9 billion, according to statistics.
