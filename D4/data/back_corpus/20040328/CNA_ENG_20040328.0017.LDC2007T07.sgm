Taipei,  March 28 (CNA) (By Sofia Wu)

Amid a domestic economic recovery, five state-owned banks will recruit
a total of 446 clerks this year, financial sources said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The five banks -- Bank of Taiwan, Taiwan Cooperative Bank, Land Bank
of Taiwan, Central Trust of China, and the Export-Import Bank of the
Republic of China -- have commissioned the Taiwan Academy of Banking
and Finance (TABF) to handle a joint examination for hopefuls, the
sources said.

<P>
"This marks the first time in nearly a decade that the five state-
owned banks have held such a large-scale employee recruitment drive,
"a TABF executive said.
</P>
<P>
As of Saturday, about 30,000 hopefuls had registered for the
examination. The registration deadline is April 2. Hopefuls must be
aged under 28 years and have at least a senior high school diploma to
qualify.
</P>
<P>
Among the five banks, Land Bank and Taiwan Cooperative Bank will each
recruit 150 new clerks; Bank of Taiwan will recruit 120 clerks;
Central Trust of China will recruit 25 clerks; while the Export-Import
Bank will only recruit one.
</P>
<P>
Except for the Export-Import Bank, the four other banks will all be
privatized soon. Taiwan Cooperative Bank will complete its
privatization process by the end of this year, while Bank of Taiwan,
Land Bank of Taiwan and Central Trust of China will be privatized by
the end of 2006. In order to retain their status as civil servants,
many staff members of these four banks have transferred to other
government agencies, thus leaving a number of job positions vacant,
banking sources said.
