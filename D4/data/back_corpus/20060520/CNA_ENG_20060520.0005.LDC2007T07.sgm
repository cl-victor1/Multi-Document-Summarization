PRESIDENT ACCENTUATES URGENCY OF TAIWAN'S WHO ACCESS(repeat)
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taipei,  May 19 (CNA) (By Sofia Wu)
</P>
<P>
President Chen Shui-bian accentuated the urgency of Taiwan's inclusion
in the Geneva-based World Health Organization (WHO) Friday, saying
it's unfair and unethical to continue excluding Taiwan from the global
disease prevention system.
</P>
<P>
Chen made appeal in a videoconference with prominent European opinion
leaders in Geneva, including European Parliament members, academics
and journalists. The videoconference was organized by the European
Union's center for Asian study.
</P>
<P>
Because of China's relentless opporession, Chen said, Taiwan has been
left as a missing link in the global health and medical system. As a
result, he said, the 23 million Taiwan people are being denied their
human right to health and the nearly 400,000 foreign residents in
Taiwan are being denied their rights and assurances regarding health
and security.
</P>
<P>
"This is completely unfair, and might even be called unethical," Chen
lamented.
</P>
<P>
Noting that Taiwan fully understands the reality of international
politics, Chen said Taiwan has, with humility and sincerity, seek
observer status in the World Health Assembly (WHA) -- the decision-
making arm of the WHO -- rather than formal membership in the WHO.
</P>
<P>
"This avoids disputes concerning sovereignty and politics, and seeks
to minimize the trouble it could cause to those allies supporting us,
" Chen said. Although the United States and Japan both adhere to the
so-called one-China policy, out of professional considerations
relating to health and disease prevention, they support Taiwan's
gaining observer status at the WHA, Chen continued.
</P>
<P>
The president added that he believes this line of thinking provides a
worthy reference for the member governments of the European Union.
</P>
<P>
Pointing out that the European Union has wielded more influence in the
world community with its further enlargement and integration, Chen
said he looks forward to an even more important role for the European
Union in the expansion of democracy globally, protection of human
rights, and preservation of peace.
</P>
<P>
"In particular, I would like to call on the E.U. to exert its power to
facilitate China's democratization and to urge China to become a
responsible stakeholder in the international community, " Chen said.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Chen said he hopes the E.U. will give its strong
support to democratic Taiwan's participation in international affairs
with the same status as other nations.
</P>
<P>
"This includes support for our inclusion in the Geneva-based WHO, so
that Taiwan can contribute more to the international community, " Chen
said, adding that Taiwan's Center for Disease Control (CDC) should
also be included in the WHO Global Outbreak and Alert Response Network
(GOARN).
</P>
<P>
Chen further said Taiwan was one of the original advocates for the
establishment of the WHO. In 1945, Taiwan and Brazil jointly advocated
establishing a new international health body at the United Nations
Conference on International Organization.
</P>
<P>
Subsequently, in 1948, the United Nations formally ratified the WHO
Constitution, which declared that the WHO's objective is the
attainment by all peoples of the highest possible level of health. The
International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights
recognizes that health is an essential element of human rights, and
that no nation should obstruct the right to health of other nations.
</P>
<P>
"The WHO has an obligation, therefore, to provide all peoples with the
best medical health services irrespective of their nationality. It
should not sacrifice its noble ideals on the altar of brute political
force," Chen continued.
</P>
<P>
It was painfully regrettable that Taiwan has been shut out of the WHO
since 1972, a year after the United Nations gave the China seat to
Beijing at its expense, Chen recalled.
</P>
<P>
Although Taiwan has long been excluded from the world health system
because of China's unrelenting oppression, Chen said Taiwan has
continued to seek opportunities through various appropriate channels
and means to contribute to international medical care as well as
public health.
</P>
<P>
At present, he said, Taiwan has technical missions and medical teams
stationed in nations in Central and South America, Africa, and the
South Pacific to help boost local agricultural development as well as
to improve medical services in those countries.
</P>
<P>
"In Africa, we offer AIDS prevention assistance to our allies Malawi
and Swaziland. In Sao Tome and Principe, the Missao Medica de Taiwan
helps local people exterminate malaria mosquitoes, " the president
added.
</P>
<P>
Over the past 10 years, Chen said, Taiwan has contributed more than
US$450 million in emergency medical and health relief, including aid
distributed to people affected by the South Asian tsunami and
humanitarian assistance given to refugees in Iraq, Iran and
Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
"We also established 'Taiwan International Health Action' (TaiwanIHA)
this year to effectively integrate the medical resources of the public
and private sectors, so that we can make more contributions to the
health of peoples around the world," Chen said.
</P>
<P>
In July of 2003, Chen said, a sum of US$10 million donated by Taiwan
people for SARS prevention was appropriated to establish the Taiwan
Urbani Foundation, named in honor of Carlo Urbani, the Italian doctor
who first identified and then died of SARS, for his contributions and
self-sacrifice in the quest to promote health.
</P>
<P>
"The foundation will spare no effort to help prevent new epidemics and
increase Taiwan's exchanges with the international community," Chen
went on.
</P>
<P>
In recent decades, Chen said, Taiwan has never been absent from the
process of improving and strengthening the quality of international
medical care and sanitation.
</P>
<P>
"The tragic experience of SARS in 2003 taught us that, with the
continuous flow of people and commodities between countries in this
era of globalization, the international community should endeavor to
realize the goal of a global disease prevention network without any
gaps," Chen said, adding that the continued spread of avian flu has,
in particular, elicited a high level of concern worldwide, and Taiwan
is acting with extreme caution in facing this situation.
</P>
<P>
Stressing that it is imperative and, above all, in the interest of all
nations that Taiwan be fully incorporated into the global disease
prevention system, Chen said that on May 15, Taiwan's Center for
Disease Control (CDC) has announced voluntary early compliance with
the International Health Regulations 2005, as Taiwan want to shoulder
its duty as world citizens by complying with international standards.
</P>
<P>
"Even though Taiwan still remains excluded from the global disease
prevention network, we insist on applying the highest standards to
ourselves. We also hope other countries, particularly China, can
follow suit, and become more open and transparent in its disease
information," Chen said.
</P>
<P>
In three days, Chen said, Taiwan will be knocking on the WHO's door
for the 10th time as the WHA will hold its annual meeting in Geneva
May 22-27.
</P>
<P>
"All eyes will be focused on whether our efforts will succeed this
year. The result is important, of course, but our efforts are no less
meaningful if, during the course of the appeal, the global community
can come to better understand the unfair and unreasonable treatment
that Taiwan's people receive in the world arena, and if we can make
more friends and win greater support," Chen added.
