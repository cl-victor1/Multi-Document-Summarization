U.S. NOT AGAINST WHO MEMBERSHIP FOR TAIWAN: MOFA
</HEADLINE>

Taipei, May 11 (CNA) 05/11/07  14:25:55 (By Y.F. Low)

Taiwan's failure to win U.S. support for its bid to become a full
member of the World Health Organization (WHO) does not mean the
United States is against the move, a Ministry of Foreign Affairs
official said Friday.
</P>
<P>
According to Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs Yang Tzu-pao,
while the administration of President George W. Bush does not
oppose Taiwan's application for WHO membership, it has not
offered its support for the bid because of certain restrictions
in Taiwan-U.S. relations.
</P>
<P>
Despite the lack of support from the administrative branch, the
U.S. Congress has clearly expressed its support for the move,
Yang said.
</P>
<P>
He said Taiwan will continue to work with its diplomatic allies
to push for the inclusion of its membership application on the
agenda of this year's  World Health  Assembly  (WHA)  --  the
WHO's decision-making arm.
</P>
<P>
Yang made the remarks while briefing a group of Taiwan Solidarity
Union legislators on the country's bid for WHO membership.
</P>
<P>
Although in favor of Taiwan's participation as an observer in the
WHA, the United States has adopted a position of not supporting
Taiwan's pursuit for membership in international organizations
where statehood is required.
</P>
<P>
The Bush administration recently refused to receive a mission led
by Joanne J.L. Chang, deputy secretary-general of the National
Security Council, who was sent by Taiwan's government to lobby
for U.S. support for the country's effort to apply for WHO
membership under the name of "Taiwan" this year.
</P>
<P>
Republic of China Representative to the United States Joseph Wu
confirmed Thursday that the U.S. government had clearly indicated
to Taipei that it would not support the bid even before the
application was filed in April.
</P>
<P>
To promote the bid ahead of the annual WHA gathering -- slated to
open May 14 in Geneva, President Chen Shui-bian will hold a video
conference with international media members posted in Geneva
Friday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Chen has on many occasions cited the precedent of the former East
Germany to make a case for Taiwan's application, which was turned
down unilaterally by the WHO Secretariat on the grounds that
Taiwan is not a sovereign country.
</P>
<P>
Chen noted that the status of East Germany as a "country" was
challenged when it applied to become a member of the WHO in 1968
but that the request was nonetheless included on the WHA's agenda
for consideration by the organization's member nations.
</P>
<P>
The WHO invited East Germany to participate in the 1972 WHA
gathering as an observer, and during the 1973 gathering, East
Germany's application for WHO membership was approved, Chen
pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Rejecting China's sovereignty claim over Taiwan, Chen asserted
that Taiwan's status as an independent country is
"unquestionable" because Taiwan maintains diplomatic relations
with 23 official members of the WHO and one observer in the
organization.
