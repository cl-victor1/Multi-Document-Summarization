CHEN INVITES CHINESE PRESIDENT TO VISIT TAIWAN

Taipei,  May  11  (CNA) 05/11/07  14:27:53 (By Deborah Kuo)

President Chen Shui-bian extended an invitation during an
interview with a U.S. media outlet Thursday to Chinese President
Hu Jintao to visit Taiwan, saying that his invitation to Hu does
not come with any conditions.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Bloomberg reporters James Peng and Stephen
Engle, Chen said that Hu "wouldn't have to acknowledge Taiwan's
sovereignty as a condition for accepting my invitation to visit."
</P>
<P>
It was the third time that Chen extended an invitation to Chinese
leaders to visit Taiwan or offered to meet with Chinese leaders
since 2000, when he proposed a cross-strait summit with Hu's
predecessor, Jiang Zemin. In 2001, Chen offered to meet with
Jiang in Hong Kong. China ignored both overtures, according to a
report carried at Bloomberg.com Friday.

<P>
Meanwhile, discounting an earlier Bloomberg report describing
Taiwan's stock market as "the world's worst performer since 2000,
" Chen said that next year will be much better, adding that
"before the 2008 presidential election, our stock market will
have a great performance," according to Bloomberg.
</P>
<P>
Chen predicted in the interview that the Taiwan bourse will rise
as much as 11 percent next year, saying that "I believe and
expect that in the latter half of this year, the stock market
will climb to 8,500 or even 9,000 points."
</P>
<P>
Chen defended his administration's handling of the economy in the
interview  and said  that Taiwan  couldn't  be compared  with
higher-growth places such as China and Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
He said Taiwan had pretty good economic performance last year,
with a growth rate of 4.6 percent, which he said was better than
his government had expected.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that Taiwan suffered from two curbs on higher growth,
namely domestic  political  turmoil,  including  months  of anti-
government demonstrations calling for the president to resign
over corruption allegations, and China's efforts to "marginalize"
Taiwan on the international stage, according to Bloomberg.
</P>
<P>
The president said that the China market is huge and attractive,
but Taiwan cannot afford to put its economic lifeline and all its
resources in a single market. "We cannot afford to become a
subsidiary," Chen was quoted as saying in the interview.
</P>
<P>
Chen rejected calls for the government to loosen restrictions on
Taiwan companies investing in China, saying that "the issue is
not whether we should loosen the investment cap, the issue is
that Taiwan's investment in China is too high. It's not normal."
</P>
<P>
He said an opposition politician or a businessperson may choose
to ignore the existence of 988 ballistic missiles deployed on the
southeast coast of China and aimed at Taiwan, but "as the
president of Taiwan, you can't pretend that these missiles don't
exist."
