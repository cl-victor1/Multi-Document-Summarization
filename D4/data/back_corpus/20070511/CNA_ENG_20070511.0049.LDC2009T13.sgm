From next week, drug addicts in Tainan County will be able to get
syringe kits and needles from vending machines in 16 locations,
Tainan County Deputy Magistrate Yen Chun-tzuo announced Friday.
</P>
<P>
Yen said the vending machines will supply a package containing a
pair of syringes with needles, two condoms and some rubbing
alcohol swabs for the price of NT$10 (US$0.30).
</P>
<P>
He added that the county government will sign agreements with
convenience stores to also provide free syringes and needles on a
24-hour basis to drug addicts.
</P>
<P>
The Tainan county government implemented a program in October
2005 to supply free needles to drug abusers in an attempt to curb
the spread of AIDS.
</P>
<P>
Although some critics see the measure as an encouragement for
drug abusers to continue their habits, the county government has
decided to expand the program by setting up the vending machines
and distributing through convenience stores.
</P>
<P>
Yen described the service as successful, saying that the number
of HIV carriers in Taiwan dropped from 3,392 in 2005 to 2,981 in
2006 and is expected to drop further to below 2,000 by the end of
2007.
</P>
<P>
He said Tainan county has recorded only 13 new HIV carriers this
year and that this achievement has been recognized by Nature
magazine in the United States.
