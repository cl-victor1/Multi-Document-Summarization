SIX-YEAR INDIGENOUS LANGUAGE REVITALIZATION PLAN IN THE OFFING
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  May 11 (CNA) 05/11/07  17:26:30 (By Deborah Kuo)

The government is planning to launch a six-year indigenous
language revitalization plan aimed at conserving and revitalizing
dying aboriginal mother tongues, the Council of Indigenous People
(CIP) reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Under the language revitalization plan, expected to kick off next
year, efforts will be made to help convert indigenous people's
verbal languages to written texts, said Wang Chiou-i, chief of
the CIP Education and Culture Department.
</P>
<P>
Wang said it would take immense government resources to collect
and preserve the indigenous mother tongues, some of which are on
the brink of extinction, before transforming them into
dictionaries or digital archives.
</P>
<P>
Only by transforming the indigenous mother tongues into written
texts and digital archives can these languages be preserved for
the use by generations to come, Wang said.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan has the largest number of languages associated with the
Austronesian- language group, which probably underwent the widest
physical dispersion of any single language family prior to
European colonial expansion in the wake of Columbus's voyages,
Wang said, being spoken from the island of Madagascar off the
east coast of Africa, all the way to the tiny, isolated Easter
Island (Rapa Nui) and extending to Taiwan, Vietnam, Northern
Australia, New Zealand and most of the Melanesian and Polynesian
islands.
</P>
<P>
The simultaneous existence of more than 20 kinds of Austronesian
languages on a single island of Taiwan is a rarity in the world
in terms of history and philological diversity, Wang pointed out.
</P>
<P>
It is hoped that after the six-year language revitalization plan
is carried out, Taiwan will turn out to be a stronghold of
Austronesian language research and development and a paradigm of
native language development, Wang added.
</P>
<P>
Tasks to be accomplished over the course of the six-year plan
include implementing measures to regenerate indigenous languages,
enacting relevant statues, setting up a promotional agency to
compile dictionaries and language teaching materials, training
teachers, creating language immersion environments, using high-
technology teaching tools, establishing a certification system
for language proficiency  and encouraging  the learning of
traditional  and contemporary folk songs.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan's indigenous people -- the native groups that predate all
other communal groups in Taiwan -- could have originated either
from the southern part of China or from the vast Austronesian-
language region.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan's aborigines are considered the northernmost Austronesian
people. The government currently divides them into 13 major
mountain tribes and 10 Pingpu groups. While elements of the
languages and cultures of the 10 mountainous races have been
maintained, most of the native languages of the Pingpu people
have died out and no traces remain.
</P>
<P>
Among the mountainous aborigines, the Saisiat and the Atayal are
believed to have migrated to Taiwan some 3,000 years ago.
</P>
<P>
The 13 major mountain tribal groups in Taiwan are the Amis,
Atayal,  Bunun, Kavalan, Paiwan, Pinuyumayan, Rukai, Saisiyat,
Sakizaya, Thao, Truku, Tsou, and Yami. Each is recognized as
having its own dialect and distinct culture.
