The Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) will help the family of a
murdered Taiwanese businesswoman travel to Shanghai to deal with
her affairs, a SEF spokesman said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The 30-year-old jeans designer from Taipei City, identified as
Chen Yi-chun, was found dead at her residence in Shanghai earlier
that day and a preliminary investigation by Shanghai police shows
that she was murdered during the course of a robbery, the
spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The SEF will help the family members with paperwork and other
requirements so that they can get to Shanghai as soon as
possible.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said the SEF has asked its Chinese counterpart, the
Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait, to urge the
Shanghai police to fully investigate Chen's death.
</P>
<P>
The SEF is a quasi-official organization authorized to handle
exchanges with China in the absence of official ties with
Beijing.
