'NORMAL COUNTRY' RESOLUTION TO LIVE UP TO PUBLIC EXPECTATIONS:
DPP
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taipei,  May 11 (CNA) 05/11/07  16:43:21 (By Lilian Wu)
</P>
<P>
The ruling Democratic Progressive Party's (DPP's) promotion of a
"normal country resolution" will live up to the expectations of
the public and will be favorable to the party's chances of
winning the presidential election next year, DPP Chairman Yu
Shyi-kun said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Yu made the remarks one day after DPP officials said the party
will soon form a task force to draw up the "resolution on making
Taiwan a normal country" to replace its current "Resolution on
Taiwan's Future" to update the party's policy. The officials hope
that the new resolution will be passed at the party's congress
June 30.
</P>
<P>
The party's "Resolution on Taiwan's Future" was incorporated into
the party platform in 1999 in a bid to woo middle-of-the-road
voters. The drastic change from the party's original advocacy of
building an independent country played a role in Chen Shui-bian's
winning the presidential election the following year, ending more
than five decades of rule by the Kuomintang (KMT).
</P>
<P>
Yu, who made "making Taiwan a normal country" one of his
platforms during his campaign in the party's presidential primary
in early May, has continued to push the idea in the hopes of
making it a party policy despite his defeat in the primary.
Former Premier Frank Hsieh emerged as the top winner in the
primary and is set to be nominated as the party's presidential
candidate after winning the primary vote.
</P>
<P>
Yu stressed that the promotion of the "normal country' resolution
will proceed in an "open, democratic and supra-faction" manner so
as to forge consensus within the party.
</P>
<P>
Sources said the planned resolution could trigger new debates and
anxiety over the nation's status as stipulated in the
Constitution as well as the future course on whether to seek
formal independence or unification with China.
</P>
<P>
Yu criticized Hsieh's "one China" framework during the heat of
the DPP's presidential primary campaign, which refers to Hsieh's
reasoning that Taiwan's current Constitution is based on "one
China' framework in which the "one China" refers to the Republic
of China. Hsieh has therefore advocated wiping away the "one
China" concept through constitutional reform.
</P>
<P>
Yu dismissed the question that Hsieh was not supportive of the
planned resolution, saying that Hsieh, as well as other
contenders for the presidential primary -- Premier Su Tseng-chang
and Vice President Annette Lu -- all agreed to making Taiwan a
normal country during their platform presentations prior to the
primary.
</P>
<P>
Both Yu and Hsieh came to Keelung Friday to canvass support for a
DPP candidate in the port city's mayoral by-election that will
take place Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Asked if Yu's proposed resolution is aimed at him, Hsieh said
that "one should not be too suspicious, " adding that he is now
stressing "love and trust."
</P>
<P>
Saying that the DPP congress passed the "Resolution on Taiwan's
Future" in 1999 to win the presidential election the following
year, he said the planned resolution "should work the same way."
</P>
<P>
He noted that the DPP passed the "Taiwan Independence Clause" in
1991, which states that the party's stance is that "the residents
on Taiwan will build a sovereign, independent Taiwan Republic
through self-determination. "
</P>
<P>
But in 1999, the DPP made a drastic change by passing the
"Resolution on Taiwan's Future, " which states that Taiwan is
already a sovereign, independent country whose name is the
"Republic of China," that Taiwan and China are independent of
each other, as well as that any change to the status quo will
require the consent of the 23 million people on Taiwan through a
referendum.
</P>
<P>
Yu's aides said that the party has already invited political
commentator Lin Chien-lung as well as Cheng Cheng-yu and Tseng
Kuei-hai of the pro-independence Taiwan Society to serve as
members of a task force to draw up the planned "normal country
resolution."
</P>
<P>
The aides said that as a native ruling party, it should have
"broad vision" and make "the defining decision at a critical
time.'
</P>
<P>
They said that after the party forges consensus over the planned
resolution, the party will use it as a base to rally public
support and beat the KMT in elections.
</P>
<P>
"This will be crucial to the Taiwan's future as well as the
development of the party and will not be meant to benefit Yu
himself," they added.
