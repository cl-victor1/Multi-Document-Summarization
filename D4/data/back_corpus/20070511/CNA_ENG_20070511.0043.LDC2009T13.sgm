PRESIDENT PITCHES FOR WHO SEAT FOR TAIWAN
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taipei,  May 11 (CNA) 05/11/07  21:26:29 (By Lilian Wu)
</P>
<P>
President Chen Shui-bian expressed the ardent hope in an
international news conference via satellite Friday of Taiwan
becoming a member of the World Health Organization (WHO).
</P>
<P>
Chen appealed for a seat for Taiwan prior to the annual
conference of the World Health Assembly (WHA), the decision-
making arm of the WHO, which is slated to open in Geneva,
Switzerland May 14.
</P>
<P>
In his brief opening remarks, he cited the threat of SARS and
avian flu to add force to his call that only by accepting Taiwan
as a member of the WHO can the missing link in the global disease
prevention network be filled.
</P>
<P>
Chen noted that when SARS affected Taiwan four years ago, medical
experts from the WHO only arrived six weeks later due to
relentless obstruction by China. A total of 346 Taiwan people
were infected, 73 of whom died during the outbreak.
</P>
<P>
The prevalence of avian flu is another reason why Taiwan must
join the WHO, the president said, noting that WHO statistics show
that 230 people have been infected by H5N1, a virulent strain of
avian flu, in China, Indonesia, Vietnam, Thailand, Myanmar and
Cambodia, 144 of whom had died as of the end of March.
</P>
<P>
He noted that Taiwan has frequent exchanges with the six
countries due to their geographical proximity and said that if
the disease spreads to Taiwan, it could spread quickly to other
countries.
</P>
<P>
He added that three Taiwanese SARS survivors will travel to
Geneva later in the day in the hope of calling attention to the
unfair treatment Taiwan receives and the potential risks and
threat posed by Taiwan being left out of the global health
network.
</P>
<P>
Chen said this is the first year the nation has applied for full
membership of the WHO under the name of "Taiwan."
</P>
<P>
Taiwan has wanted to join the WHA as an observer for a decade,
but its attempts ts to enter the organization under the
designation of "health entity" have been repeatedly thwarted by
China, despite the fact that Taiwan's diplomatic allies and its
major trade partners the United States and Japan have supported
the bid.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, the United States, Japan and the European Union
have supported Taiwan's "meaningful participation " prior to
becoming an observer, Chen said.
</P>
<P>
"Meaningful participation" has been suggested by some countries
to refer to the opportunity for Taiwan to participate in as many
WHO-related meetings as possible, regardless of official title or
circumstance.
</P>
<P>
But he noted that a memorandum of understanding signed between
China and the WHO in 2005 allows China to have a final say on
Taiwan's interactions with the WHO, rendering the "meaningful
participation" meaningless.
</P>
<P>
He cited the precedent of the former East Germany to make a case
for Taiwan's application, which was turned down unilaterally by
the WHO Secretariat on the grounds that Taiwan is not a sovereign
country.
</P>
<P>
Chen noted that the status of East Germany as a "country" was
challenged when it applied to become a member of the WHO in 1968
but that the request was nonetheless included on the WHA's agenda
for consideration by the organization's member nations.
</P>
<P>
The WHO invited East Germany to participate in the 1972 WHA
gathering as an observer, and during the 1973 gathering, East
Germany's application for WHO membership was approved, Chen
pointed out.
</P>
<P>
During the question-and-answer session, he also said Taiwan's bid
to join the WHO or the United Nations under the name of "Taiwan"
will have nothing to do with his "four noes" pledges -- no
declaration of Taiwan independence, no changing of the official
name of the country, no inclusion of the "state-to- state"
concept on cross-strait relations in the Constitution, and no
promotion of a referendum to change the cross-Taiwan Strait
status quo.
</P>
<P>
Chen said that if Taiwan pursues the right path and sticks to its
guns it will succeed and noted that the Legislative Yuan passed
unanimously a resolution to join the WHO as full member under the
name of "Taiwan" earlier in the day.
