BELGIAN MEDICAL LEADER SUPPORTS TAIWAN MEDIA'S RIGHT TO COVER WHA
</HEADLINE>

Brussels,  Belgium,  May 10 (CNA) 05/11/07  11:52:17 (By P.C.
Tang and Y.F. Low)

<P>
The leader of a Belgian medical group offered his support
Thursday for an international petition campaign promoted by
Taiwan journalists to uphold their right to cover the annual
World Health Assembly (WHA).
</P>
<P>
In addition to signing the petition, Roland Lemye, head of the
Association Belge des Syndicats Medicaux, also helped forward the
petition to Belgian media.
</P>
<P>
Since 2004, the United Nations has refused to issue press cards
for Taiwan journalists to cover the WHA -- the decision-making
arm of the World Health Organization. This year's WHA is
scheduled to open May 14 in Geneva.
</P>
<P>
The petition campaign, launched by the Association of Taiwan
Journalists to protest the U.N. practice, has been endorsed by 31
news organizations and 36 influential media professionals in
Taiwan. The association is now seeking international support for
the drive.
