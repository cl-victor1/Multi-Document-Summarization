PRESIDENT REAFFIRMS SUPPORT FOR ABOLISHING DEATH PENALTY
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taipei,  May 11 (CNA) 05/11/07  14:31:01 (By Sofia Wu)
</P>
<P>
President Chen Shui-bian has reaffirmed his resolve to gradually
phase out the death penalty and eventually enshrine the idea in
the country's Constitution.
</P>
<P>
Chen spelled out his stance on capital punishment Thursday during
a meeting with Theodoor C. Van Boven, a world-famous Dutch human
rights expert who is visiting Taipei along with his wife.
</P>
<P>
On mounting calls from human rights advocacy groups at home and
abroad for abolition of the death penalty, Chen said he
personally favors doing away with such a drastic form of
punishment.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Chen told his guest that Taiwan society has yet to
reach a consensus on the issue, with as many as 80 percent of
ordinary citizens surveyed in various opinion polls unfailingly
opposing any calls for the outlawing of the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
However, if complementary measures are put in place, such as
raising the ceiling on prison sentences or tightening up parole
restrictions for those sentenced to life imprisonment, Chen said,
about 40 percent of the respondents in the opinion surveys would
support the death penalty abolition proposal.
</P>
<P>
Against this backdrop, Chen said his administration has adopted a
gradual manner in addressing relevant issues. As the first step,
many laws have been revised in recent years to reduce the number
of capital offenses or crimes punishable by death.
</P>
<P>
"Nowadays, crimes for which the only punishment is death are few,
" Chen said, adding that in most cases, judges now can use their
discretion on either sentencing a serious offender to death or
life imprisonment without probation and parole.
</P>
<P>
In less than 10 years, Chen said, the number of convicts executed
per year has dropped to nil. He noted that in 1998, 32 convicted
felons were executed, and the number has since declined steadily,
particularly after he assumed the presidency May 20, 2000.
</P>
<P>
"Only 17 death-row inmates were executed in 2000, and the number
dropped to 10 the following year and further down to three in
2005, " Chen said, adding that no one was executed last year.
</P>
<P>
Noting that his administration is pushing for constitutional re-
engineering, Chen said it is hoped that a national consensus on
abolishing capital punishment can be forged gradually to pave the
way for enshrining relevant notions and provisions in the revised
Constitution.
