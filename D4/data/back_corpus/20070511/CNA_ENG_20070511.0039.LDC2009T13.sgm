The World Taiwanese Congress (WTC) announced Thursday that it
will team up with the World Federation of Taiwanese Associations
(WFTA) to form an umbrella group to support former Premier Frank
Hsieh's presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
WTC Convener Kuo Chung-kuo said that once established, the
umbrella organization will hold a series of campaign rallies
around the world to drum up support for Hsieh and will organize
delegations to attend campaign rallies in Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the 2008 presidential election will have a great
impact on Taiwan's future, Kuo claimed that the election results
will decide whether Taiwan will be an independent country
belonging to the people of Taiwan or whether it move towards
unification with China.
</P>
<P>
He called for all Taiwanese associations around the world to
establish umbrella groups in support of Hsieh's presidential bid.
</P>
<P>
Hsieh is set to be nominated by the ruling Democratic Progressive
Party (DPP) to run for the presidency, as the party has decided
to scrap the second phase of its presidential primary.
</P>
<P>
In the first phase of the primary held May 6, Hsieh obtained
44.66 percent of votes cast by party members, beating the three
other contenders -- Vice President Annette Lu, Premier Su Tseng-
chang and PDP Chairman Yu Shyi-kun -- all of whom expressed their
decision the next day to back Hsieh's presidential bid.
