AIR QUALITY TO GET WORSE DUE TO HIGH OZONE CONCENTRATION

Taipei, May 11 (CNA) 05/11/07  16:03:50 (By Elizabeth Hsu)

The ozone concentration has been much higher than normal over the
past several days owing to the recirculation of a high pressure
system over the western part of Taiwan, with the health-
threatening situation likely to remain for one more week if there
is no change in the current weather pattern, an Environmental
Protection Administration (EPA) official said Friday.

Yeh Fang-lu, an EPA inspector in air protection, indicated that
the ozone density was detected at 222 ppb (parts per billion) at
the EPA Kuting surveillance station in Taipei last week, marking
the highest level in the past decade. In comparison, a level of
60 ppb is usually recorded in the winter and a level of 20 ppb in
the summer in northern Taiwan, Yeh said.

<P>
The ozone concentration was detected at 161 ppb in the central
and southern areas of Taiwan covering the counties of Yulin,
Chiayi and Tainan and at 176 ppb in Kaohsiung City and Kaoshiung
County and in Pingtung County this week, Yeh said, warning people
in these areas against heading outdoors between noon and 2:00
p.m.
</P>
<P>
As ozone concentrations above 95 ppb can cause respiratory
distress in humans, the EPA has instructed affected local
governments to be on alert over air quality changes and advised
seniors and those who have weak immune systems to refrain from
going outside or to wear surgical masks if they go outside, Yeh
said.
