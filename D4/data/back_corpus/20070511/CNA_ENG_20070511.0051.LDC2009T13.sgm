The government is capable of settling all technical details that
would be involved in a visit to Taiwan by Chinese President Hu
Jintao if President Chen Shui-bian's invitation stands "any
possibility of materializing, " Mainland Affairs Council (MAC)
Vice Chairman Liu Te-hsun said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Liu made the comments in a routine news conference after Chen
told the U. S.-based Bloomberg news agency a day earlier in an
exclusive interview that he is willing to invite Hu to Taiwan
with "no specific conditions attached" if Hu is sincere.
</P>
<P>
In response to Chen's remarks, Liu said that preparations and
arrangements by government authorities on the two sides should be
quite possible, as Taiwan and China have arranged similar matters
in the past.
</P>
<P>
According to Liu, the prime purpose of Chen's invitation would be
to allow Hu to gain a better understanding of Taiwan society's
pluralistic and diversified facets -- something that would be
very helpful to bolstering understanding and stability across the
Taiwan Strait.
