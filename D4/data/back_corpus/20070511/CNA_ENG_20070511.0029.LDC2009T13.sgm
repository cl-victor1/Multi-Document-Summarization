The Air Force F-5F twin-seat fighter that crashed in the northern
county of Hsinchu Friday morning was the military's 17th F-5E/F
to be downed in an accident since 1988, according to data from
Legislator Hsueh Ling of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party.

<P>
Eighteen military officers were killed by the crashes, which also
caused one serious injury and left four missing, the data showed.

The F-5E/Fs began service as the backbone of the ROC Air Force
arsenal in the 1970s. In 2000, the government-owned Aerospace
Industrial Development Corp. proposed a "Tiger2000" project in an
attempt to upgrade the F-5E/Fs. However, the plan failed to win
military support, according to Hsueh.

<P>
Currently,  the aging aircraft  is used in pilot training
operations, having receded from front line service.

The Friday accident also killed two Singaporean troops on the
ground and injured two other Singaporean soldiers after it caused
a fire to break out at the barracks housing Singaporean soldiers
training in Taiwan.
