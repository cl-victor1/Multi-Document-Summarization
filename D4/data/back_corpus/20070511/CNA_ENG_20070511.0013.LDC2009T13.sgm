DANISH LAWMAKER CALLS FOR SUPPORT FOR TAIWAN'S WHO BID

A Danish parliamentarian called for support Thursday for Taiwan's
bid to join the World Health Organization (WHO) as a full member.
</P>
<P>
Jens Hald Madsen, chairman of the Danish Parliament's Taiwan
Friendship Group, said in his letter published in Thursday's
Berlingske Tidende, one of the most influential newspapers in
Denmark, that Taiwan has extended its humanitarian help to
peoples in more than 90 countries around the world over the past
10 years.
</P>
<P>
Barring Taiwan -- a country with solid economic strength and
commendable medical achievements -- from joining the WHO family
is unjustifiable, Madsen said.
</P>
<P>
Madsen urged that Denmark first seek a consensus within the
European Union on an initiative pushing for observer status for
Taiwan in the World Health Assembly (WHA) , the top decision-
making body of WHO.
</P>
<P>
He said he believes that Taiwan will free itself from the
shackles of China's suppression sooner or later and then play a
key role on the international stage as well as in China's
development.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Cheng Wen-tsang, who recently resigned from the post
of minister of Taiwan's Government Information Office, also made
a pitch for Taiwan's WHO bid in a letter published by Berlingske
Tidende on the same day, asking the Danish government to support
Taiwan's endeavor to play amore active role in the global health
and disease prevention systems.
</P>
<P>
Cheng said all Taiwan's efforts over the past 10 years to join
the WHA as an observer have failed due to China's obstruction.
</P>
<P>
Citing the results of a recent public opinion poll conducted in
Taiwan, Cheng said that 95 percent of the Taiwan people agree
that Taiwan should be admitted into the WHO as a full member.
</P>
<P>
The WHO's excluding of the 16th largest economic entity in the
world from its ranks has obviously gone against the norms and
spirit of the world health regulatory body, Cheng added.
