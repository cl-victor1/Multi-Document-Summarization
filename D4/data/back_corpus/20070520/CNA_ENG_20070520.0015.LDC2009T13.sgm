NEW PREMIER MAY ASK LEGISLATURE TO RECONSIDER CONTROVERSIAL BILLS

Taipei,  May  20 (CNA) 05/20/07  18:51:23 (By Luis Huang)

Premier-designate Chang Chun-hsiung is likely to ask the
Legislative Yuan Tuesday to reconsider two controversial bills
concerning the employment of local farmers and fishermen
associations' secretaries-general after he is sworn in Monday, a
whip of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party's (DPP's)
legislative caucus said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
During an interview with reporters,  Ker Chien-ming, chief
convener of the DPP caucus, said that should the legislature
decide to put the Executive Yuan's reconsideration proposal to a
vote, legislators of the "pan-green camp" of the DPP and the
Taiwan Solidarity Union will vote in favor of it.
</P>
<P>
The Legislative Yuan, controlled by the Kuomintang (KMT) -led
"pan-blue alliance",  passed draft amendments  to the Farmers
Association Law and the Fishermen Association Law May 11, which
according to "pan-green" lawmakers would pave the way for the
"return of black gold politics."
</P>
<P>
The controversial  amendments  not only  cancel  three-term
restrictions for secretaries-general of farmers and fishermen
associations but also stipulates that association staff standing
trial should not be discharged until a final verdict is delivered
in their cases. Under the existing laws, indicted staff members
from farmers and fishermen associations should be relieved of
their posts following conviction in their second trials for
criminal activities.
</P>
<P>
Ker said that after assuming his post, Chang will pay a courtesy
visit to Legislative Yuan speaker Wang Jin-pyng and that he will
meet with the premier to exchange views on the issue prior to the
Chang-Wang meeting.
</P>
<P>
According to Ker, the legislature will deal with a KMT-drafted
amendment bill on the organization of the Central Election
Commission and the central government's 2007 budget plan during
its May 22 session, the first to be attended by Chang after
taking the helm of the Executive Yuan.
