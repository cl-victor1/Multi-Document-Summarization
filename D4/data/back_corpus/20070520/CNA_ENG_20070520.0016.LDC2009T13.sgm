Taipei,  May 20 (CNA) 05/20/07  18:55:23 (By T.C. Jiang)

<P>
President Chen Shui-bian has hailed the inauguration of a new
rescue boat in the northeastern county of Yilan, saying it will
better protect Taiwanese fishermen's lives and property.
</P>
<P>
Chen made the remarks while presiding over the inauguration
ceremony for the "Yi An No. 6" in Yilan Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The boat is the result of a collaborative project between the
Fisheries Agency and the Yilan County government to replace a 17
-year-old rescue boat.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 1,000 large and small fishing boats operate off Yilan
County all year long, officials from the Suao Fishermen's
Association said.
</P>
<P>
Prior to the inauguration of the "Yi An No. 6., " fishermen had
to rely on the old boat, which was poorly equipped and often
broke down, to rescue them when they were involved in accidents
or their boats malfunctioned, the officials stated.
</P>
<P>
Chen said in his remarks that he learned about local fishermen's
need for a new boat during an inspection tour of the eastern
county in 2004 and therefore promised at that time that the
central government would provide subsidies to the Yilan County
government for the construction of a new boat.
