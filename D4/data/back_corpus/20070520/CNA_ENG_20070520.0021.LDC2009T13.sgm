The Chilean government will send a delegation to Taiwan next week
to explain issues regarding the presence of a codling moth larva
in its apple shipment to Taiwan early this month and its
compensation plan, a Chilean agriculture official said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The announcement  was made some two weeks after  Taiwan's
government halted Chilean apple imports following the discovery
of the moth larva in the apple shipment.
</P>
<P>
The delegation, to be made up of ranking agriculture officials,
will deal with issues related to Taiwan's suspension of apple
imports from Chile, Chilean Agriculture Minister Alvaro Rojas
Marin said in a news release, adding that as low-priced Chilean
apples are popular in Taiwan, he believes that the problem can be
worked out soon.
</P>
<P>
On May 4, Taiwan quarantine inspectors discovered a live codling
moth larva inside a Chilean apple in a shipment at Keelung Harbor
in northern Taiwan and immediately decided that the entire
shipment, which included four containers with 4,992 boxes of
apples, should either be destroyed or returned to the country of
origin according to plant quarantine regulations.
</P>
<P>
Chile is the second apple exporter this year to be suspended from
shipping the fruit to Taiwan after New Zealand, whose Fuji apple
exports were suspended April 12 after a codling moth larva was
found in a shipment at Taichung Harbor in central Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Council of Agriculture (COA) officials said that after the larva
was discovered, Taiwan told the Chilean government that it would
suspend imports until the Chilean government determined the
reason why the larva was present and implemented effective
measures to prevent a similar occurrence and inform Taiwan for a
confirmation inspection .
</P>
<P>
Rojas said that the Chilean government has gathered relevant
information and asked Taiwan authorities to allow the delegation
to give explanations on the issue.
</P>
<P>
He said that the apple found to have a codling moth larva inside
was from an orchard in southern Chile and that the orchard has
undergone pesticide treatment and its apples are now free of
codling moths. He further said that agriculture authorities will
look into the case thoroughly and mete out penalties to those
responsible.
</P>
<P>
Chile is Taiwan's second largest apple supplier, accounting for
33.9 percent of the country's total apple imports, while New
Zealand is the fourth largest supplier, accounting for 12.3
percent of the total, according to Taiwan officials.
