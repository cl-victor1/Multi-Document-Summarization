United Airlines of the United States is scheduled to resume
direct flight services between Taipei and San Francisco June 8, a
company executive announced Monday.
</P>
<P>
Andrea Wang, general manager of United Airlines Taiwan, said at a
press conference held in Taipei that Boeing 777 passenger
aircraft will be used on the route, which was closed in April
2003 due to the outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome.
</P>
<P>
There will be one flight per day after the direct flight services
begin, Wang added, explaining that the resumption of the service
is in response to customer demand -- California is one of the
most attractive destinations for Taiwanese tourists.
</P>
<P>
In 2006, around 594,000 people traveled from Taiwan to the United
States, many of whom flew to the east coast to begin their trip,
Wang said.
</P>
<P>
Currently, only two Taiwanese carriers -- the China Airlines and
EVA Airways -- operate direct flight services between Taipei and
San Francisco.
