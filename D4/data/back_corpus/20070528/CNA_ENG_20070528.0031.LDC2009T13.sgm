Taipei,  May 28 (CNA) 05/28/07  19:54:02 (By Flor Wang)

<P>
Scores of fishing boats from the Keelung area gathered Monday and
sealed off the Patouzhu port in a protest against the rules
imposed by coastal patrol authorities on Chinese fishermen
working for them.
</P>
<P>
Fishing boat skippers carried out the protest because of a safety
inspection in the port, demanding that local and central
governments ease the existing rules governing the Chinese
fishermen often hired to crew the boats.
</P>
<P>
To help local fishermen better unload their catches and take
advantage of their manpower, Keelung patrol authorities had
agreed to allow Taiwanese fishermen to bring Chinese workers from
their off-shore accommodation to their ships to help unload
catches.
</P>
<P>
Chinese workers hired by Taiwan fishing ships are not permitted
to enter Taiwan, which is why they have to be housed off the
coast.
</P>
<P>
But Keelung patrol authorities implemented a rule requiring
Chinese fishermen to immediately return to their temporary
residences off the coast -- so-called floating "hotels" -- upon
returning from operations after several Chinese fishermen, in two
incidents, ran off and disappeared.
</P>
<P>
Angry local operators said that the restriction has greatly
affected their business, and they tried to hinder customs
clearance by other vessels entering the port.
</P>
<P>
To avoid confrontation from breaking out, hundreds of policemen
and patrol officers were mobilized to maintain order and ease
tensions between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
The protesters finally agreed to disperse after Keelung Mayor
Chang Tung-lung, leading municipal and local fishermen's
association officials, also rushed to the site to help settle the
dispute.
</P>
<P>
Chang promised to negotiate with the Fisheries Agency under the
Cabinet-level Council  of Agriculture  and  the  Coast  Guard
Administration to push for a revision to the regulation, bringing
an end to the confrontation.
