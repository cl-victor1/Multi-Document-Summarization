HEALTH OFFICIAL TO BE DICIPLINED FOR UNAUTHORIZED USE OF BACTERIA
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  May 28 (CNA) 05/28/07  14:47:25 (By Deborah Kuo)

The Department of Health (DOH) official who acquired samples of
Burkholderia pseudomallei -- a bacterium which could be used as a
biochemical weapon -- from a public hospital for use in her own
research without obtaining official permission in advance will be
dealt with soon, DOH Minister Hou Sheng-mou said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Answering questions at a meeting of the Legislative Yuan Health,
Environment and Social Welfare Committee, Hou said that the DOH
will take appropriate disciplinary action against Su Hsun-pi, a
senior official of the DOH Center for Disease Control, within the
next two weeks for her unauthorized acquisition of B.
pseudomallei samples from a Taipei hospital more than four months
ago.
</P>
<P>
Hou said that although B. pseudomallei is an important cause of
acute fulminant pneumonia and septicaemia in tropical regions and
could be used by terrorists as a biochemical weapon, the
bacterium's isolates are not spread person to person.
</P>
<P>
Hou made the remarks in response to criticism leveled against the
DOH by opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Legislator Tsai Chin-lung, who
accused the DOH of negligence for condoning the actions of Su,
who is the younger sister of Yunlin Magistrate Su Chih-fen.
</P>
<P>
Tsai said the DOH authorities have yet to do anything to
discipline Su -- who had apparently taken advantage of her
position to facilitate the acquisition of the samples -- four
months after the incident was exposed by media.
</P>
<P>
KMT Legislator Lai Shyi-bao lashed out at Su for creating a
"hole" in Taiwan's disease prevention network by rashly acquiring
strains of B. pseudomallei from a hospital for her own research
without following normal control procedures.
</P>
<P>
"How could the DOH think of joining the World Health Organization
should the incident be reported abroad?" he asked.
