Taiwan businessmen in Shanghai said Monday that they and the
Pingtung county government in southern Taiwan will hold
simultaneous bluefin tuna cooking contests June 16 on both sides
of the Taiwan Strait, linked through video conference.
</P>
<P>
Lin Chih-hung, one of the businessmen, said his company will
bring in a 200-kg bluefin, worth more than NT$2 million
(US$60,105) for the contest in Shanghai, and that Taiwanese cooks
in Shanghai who specialize in Japanese cuisine will be invited to
show off their skills.
</P>
<P>
The contest in Pingtung County is being organized by the county's
fishermen's association, according to Lin.
</P>
<P>
He said renowned chefs from both sides of the Taiwan Strait and
other gourmets will be invited as guests to observe the contests
and that they will be treated to delicious bluefin dishes
prepared by the contestants.
</P>
<P>
The contests will be held as part of the Pingtung County's annual
celebration of its bluefin festival that takes place in May and
June at the Tungkang fishing harbor.
</P>
<P>
Tungkang held its first bluefin festival in 2001 and achieved
great success. Since then, the domestic market's demand for
bluefin has continued to rise, while bluefin cuisine has also
diversified beyond simple sashimi.
</P>
<P>
The bluefin tuna is probably the world's most expensive fish,
with its top quality meat easily fetching US$200 per kilogram. It
is also under very heavy pressure from overfishing.
