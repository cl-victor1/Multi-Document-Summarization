A number of the country's grand justices are billionaires, while
several others have seen their family assets increase
substantially over the past year, according to the latest asset
disclosure reports filed with the Control Yuan, the country's
supreme watchdog body.
</P>
<P>
A newly published Control Yuan report shows that all grand
justices have filed their 2006 assets disclosure reports, and
most of them are in clover.
</P>
<P>
The report shows that Judicial Yuan President Weng Yueh-sheng,
who concurrently serves as a grand justice, ranks among the three
richest grand justices in terms of family assets. Weng's bank
deposits increased NT$3.28 million to reach NT$19.25 million at
the end of last year.
</P>
<P>
Weng was one of the senior government officials who came under
fire last year over alleged misuse of special allowance funds set
aside for their discretionary use. The asset disclosure report
shows that Weng continued to deposit his special allowance fund
into his bank account last year.
</P>
<P>
Over the past year, Weng's state bond holdings decreased by more
than NT$10 million,  while his real estate holdings  remained
unchanged.
</P>
<P>
According to the asset disclosure report, grand justice Tseng
You-tien should be very interested in real estate investment. He
reported possession of four houses and two plots of land in
metropolitan Taipei in 2005 and his real estate holdings have
increased significantly in 2006 by securing five plots of land in
Hsinchu County's Chupei City where land prices have skyrocketed
in recent years thanks to industrial development and the opening
of high-speed Bullet Train services.
</P>
<P>
Grand justice Hsu Pi-hu also reported an enormous increase in
family assets in the past year. In the 2005 report, Hsu had just
NT$738,544 in bank deposit plus NT$102,181 securities holdings.
In 2006, his bank deposit swelled to NT$5.67 million and his
securities holdings also zoomed to NT$5.36 million.
</P>
<P>
Grand justice Lai Ying-jaw posted a nearly NT$8 million increase
in his bank deposit last year, with the amount reaching NT$58.07
million at the end of 2006. He didn't have any securities or real
estate holdings.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Academia Sinica President Chi-huey Wong is also a
wealthy man, possessing a house and two plots of land in the
United States in addition to nearly NT$40 million in bank
deposits and securities holdings.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Economic Affairs Steve R.L. Chen has more than
NT$13.65 million in bank deposits, marking an increase of NT$4
million from his 2005 deposits. In line with Premier Su Tseng-
chang's demand, Chen already placed part of his stock holdings
into trust. His overall stock holdings remained almost same at
NT$12.75 million, of which NT$59.49 million worth of stocks have
been put into trust.
</P>
<P>
According to the asset disclosure report, many of Taiwan's
overseas envoys are also wealthy. All of the 12 ambassadors or
overseas representatives who filed their annual assets disclosure
reports recently possess more than NT$10 million (US$303,030) in
family assets.
