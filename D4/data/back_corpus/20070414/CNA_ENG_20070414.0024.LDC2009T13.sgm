Taipei,  April 14 (CNA) 04/14/07  19:16:53 (By Lilian Wu)

<P>
Lawmakers from the ruling and opposition parties traded barbs
Saturday over the soon-to-be  inaugurated Taiwanese chamber of
commerce in China.
</P>
<P>
Legislators from the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)
asked if the establishment of the first national-level
association of Taiwan businessmen investing in China is scheduled
Monday to coincide with a China visit by Lien Chan, honorary
chairman of the main opposition Kuomintang (KMT), that day.
</P>
<P>
DPP Legislator Gao Jyh-peng asked if this means that the KMT is
singing a duet with the Communist Party of China (CPC) to help
the latter's "united front" campaign against Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Gao noted that Chang Han-wen, a Taiwanese businessman operating
in Guangdong Province in southern China who headed a supporters
group for Lien's presidential bid in the 2004 presidential
election, will serve as the chairman of the group.
</P>
<P>
High-ranking Chinese officials will also play roles in the
association, Gao said, noting that Chen Yunlin, the director of
China's Taiwan Affairs Office under the State Council, has been
chosen to serve as honorary chairman of the new organization,
while He Shizong, director of the office's Economic Bureau, will
be the group's vice chairman and secretary-general.
</P>
<P>
Gao said that Lien has only announced his itinerary for one day
in China and asked what he plans to do for the remaining days of
his stay in China.
</P>
<P>
Lien's visit reportedly will mainly be to attend the third Cross-
Strait Economic and Cultural Forum in Beijing from April 28-29
and to meet Chinese President Hu Jintao.
</P>
<P>
"China has obviously completed its scheme to control Taiwanese
businessmen investing in China," Gao said.
</P>
<P>
DPP Legislator Kao Chien-chih claimed that the KMT has promoted
absentee voting in the legislature in an attempt to collaborate
with the CPC and is using every means to try to win the 2008
presidential election.
</P>
<P>
But Hsu Shao-ping, KMT caucus whip in the legislature, pointed
out that this is not Lien's first trip to China and said that if
the DPP is pointing fingers whenever KMT officials visit China,
the government "should not discuss cross- strait policy any
more."
</P>
<P>
She also claimed that the KMT is promoting absentee voting mainly
for those voters in Taiwan who cannot make it to polling stations
and not for Taiwanese businessmen operating in China.
</P>
<P>
She cited the examples of policemen, military personnel, jail
wardens and election officials who sometimes cannot vote because
of their work. As for Taiwan businessmen in China.  the KMT is
considering pushing for charter flights for them to make it
easier for them to return to Taiwan to vote in elections, she
added.
