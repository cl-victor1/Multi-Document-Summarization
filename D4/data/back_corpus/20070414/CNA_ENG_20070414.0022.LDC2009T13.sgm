MOI URGED TO APOLOGIZE FOR GRAFT IN M-TAIWAN PROJECT
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taipei,  April 14 (CNA) 04/14/07  18:25:40 (KMT)  demanded
Saturday  that  the Ministry  of the Interior  (MOI) (By
Elizabeth Hsu)
</P>
<P>
Lawmakers of the opposition Kuomintang explain how alleged graft
involving its official will affect the country's future
competitiveness, and apologize to the public.
</P>
<P>
KMT legislative caucus whips made the call at a press conference
at the Legislative Yuan after prosecutors discovered that the
"M-Taiwan" broadband Internet network construction project, one
of the government's 10 new major national construction programs,
might have been stained by graft. The project includes a
broadband channel construction plan aimed at overcoming the
"LastMile" establishment challenge.
</P>
<P>
The MOI's Construction and Planning Agency (CPA) has budgeted
NT$30 billion (US$906.48 million) to subsidize local governments
in "fanning out" broadband wires and cables for the "LastMile"
project.
</P>
<P>
The suspected malfeasance was discovered during an investigation
by the Taipei District Prosecutors Office and the Civil Service
Ethics Department under the Ministry of Justice into another
graft allegation involving CPA official Chang Ho-ping.
</P>
<P>
Chang was detained Friday on suspicion of allowing certain
contractors to make profits after receiving dinner invitations
from them.
</P>
<P>
Legislator Hsu Shao-ping, a KMT caucus whip, said the "M-Taiwan"
plan, with its government budget of over NT$60 billion and
numerous trading opportunities, has become a machine that is
vacuuming "sweat money" out of the pockets of the public.
</P>
<P>
According to Hsu, the "M-Taiwan" project is aimed at establishing
a high-quality broadband Internet network throughout the country
to provide cheap high-speed Internet connection services in
efforts to boost the production value of Taiwan's
telecommunication sector.
</P>
<P>
KMT Legislator Joanna Lei pointed out that the project, comprised
of many smaller construction programs, has being carried out on
loans of more than NT$60 billion.
</P>
<P>
Out of concern that Chang might be guilty of other similar
malpractice while serving as the head of the CPA public
construction division, the KMT legislative caucus urged the
Executive Yuan to take steps to cleanse all other major public
construction projects of graft.
</P>
<P>
In response to the call, Executive Yuan spokeswoman Chen Mei-ling
said the alleged graft case will not affect the "M-Taiwan"
project, which is being implemented as scheduled.
</P>
<P>
Chen noted that the prosecution has begun a probe into the case
and said if evidence shows the CPA official had actually accepted
improper dining invitations, it would be "only his personal
conduct."
