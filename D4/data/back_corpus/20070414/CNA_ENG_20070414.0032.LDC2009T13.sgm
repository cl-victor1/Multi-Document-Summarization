DPP PRESIDENTIAL ASPIRANTS PUBLICIZE SOCIAL WELFARE INITIATIVES
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  April 14 (CNA) 04/14/07  21:26:06 (By Elizabeth Hsu)

The four presidential aspirants of the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) outlined their various social welfare
promotion initiatives Saturday at a televised platform
presentation.
</P>
<P>
The DPP hosted the first of two platform presentations for its
four presidential hopefuls -- Vice President Annette Lu, DPP
Chairman Yu Shyi-kun, Premier Su Tseng-chang and former Premier
Frank Hsieh -- who are bidding to represent the party in the 2008
election. Each hopeful had six minutes to present their political
ideas and administrative plans followed by a question-and-answer
session.
</P>
<P>
During the session, Minister without Portfolio Fu Li-yen brought
up three questions concerning social welfare practice -- asking
what are the DPP's core ideas in the promotion of social policies
and what are the hopefuls' core ideas on the issue, as well as
what kinds of social welfare would they promote as priority if
elected in 2008.
</P>
<P>
Hsieh, a former premier, said the DPP government has placed
social welfare, care for the less-privileged, economic growth,
social fairness and justice as priorities. He said economic
growth, social justice and fairness, as well as culture and
environment, should be treated equally in the formation of social
welfare policies.
</P>
<P>
He said that while serving as premier, he raised the government
stipend for elderly farmers from NT$4,000 (US$120) per month to
NT$5,000. However, the stipend is still smaller than a similar
subsidy of NT$13,000 for veterans.
</P>
<P>
If he wins the presidential election, Hsieh said he will make
efforts to push for the legislation of a national pension system
to ensure more equitable distribution of national resources,
Hsieh said.
</P>
<P>
Yu, who served as premier from 2002 to early 2005, said that
during his premiership, a draft national pension bill was
referred to the legislature but has since been shelved due to
partisan strife. According to that bill, a monthly pension of
NT$7,500 was proposed for every retiree. As social conditions
change, he said, the amount is now no longer able to support a
pensioner. Against this backdrop, he adovated that the pension be
raised to NT$10,000 per month.
</P>
<P>
Yu also proposed a "Happiness in Taiwan" program during the
presentation as part of efforts to promote a so-called green
economy.
</P>
<P>
Lu, the only female presidential aspirant in the DPP, spoke of
the "Good Housekeeping Project" she put forward in 2005 and which
was adopted by the Council for Economic Planning and Development
in April 2006 to provide women with training in care for the
elderly, child care, and home management to enhance their
employment opportunities as professional housekeepers for working
mothers.
</P>
<P>
Lu also said if she becomes president in 2008, she will try to
resolve problems including a dropping birth rate, which is
changing the population structure of the country.
</P>
<P>
The problem of the aging society was also touched upon by Su, who
revealed that Taiwan has currently 2.29 million senior citizens
aged over 65, over 200,000 of whom suffer from dementia.
</P>
<P>
If he is elected president, Su said, he will continue efforts to
implement the ongoing "Mega Investment, Mega Warmth" project
covering care for the elderly and less-privileged.
