Taipei,  April 13 (CNA) 04/14/07  10:46:55 (By Y.C. Jou)

The Bank of Taiwan Friday sold by tender 11 plots of land across
Taiwan, with one in the downtown Taipei Zhongzheng  District
hitting  an  NT$880,300 (US$26,540)  per square-meter record for
the district's residential area, the bank said.

<P>
According to information released by the bank, the plot of land
at Taipei's Guling Street measuring nearly a thousand"pings"- a
unit of area each equaling around 3.3057 square meters - was won
by the listed Rich Development Co. Ltd with an NT$2,789 million
bid, NT$1,229 million higher than the upset price.
</P>
<P>
Bank officials said such a high price was largely a result of the
recent release of the government's 12-year compulsory education
policy,  because the plot of land containing residential  and
commercial areas is expected to fall within the catchment area of
the nearby, highly rated Jianguo High School.

11 of the 17 plots of land available sold for a total of NT$3,132
million, bank officials said.
