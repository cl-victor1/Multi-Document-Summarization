Taipei,  April,  14 (CNA) 04/14/07  16:28:32 (By Elisa Kao)

<P>
Former ruling Democratic Progressive Party Chairman Lin Yi-hsiung
said Saturday that the president to be elected in 2008 should be
a non-partisan politician and he urged possible candidates to
work toward ending the bitter strife among the various political
parties.
</P>
<P>
Lin made the remarks while leading a group of nuclear-free
activists in distributing leaflets in Taichung City, central
Taiwan, to solicit support for his campaign to seek revisions to
the Referendum Law.
</P>
<P>
Lin claims that a cap in the Referendum Law makes proposing a
referendum and passing it very difficult.
</P>
<P>
Lin noted that the law stipulates that a referendum proposal
should obtain the endorsement of more than 5 percent of the
country's citizens, much higher than the 1.5 percent required to
present a presidential candidate.
</P>
<P>
Lin's ultimate goal is to allow the public to have a say in
deciding the future of the country's Fourth Nuclear Power Plant.
He has been a staunch  supporter of the policy to make Taiwan
nuclear-free.
</P>
<P>
According to Lin, the implementation of referendums will be the
next step in Taiwan's democratization.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the fighting among the political parties, Lin said
it is no surprise, especially when elections are approaching.
</P>
<P>
Saying that a reduction of political conflicts is vital for the
presidential election in 2008, Lin called for the election of a
supra-party leader who can contribute to benign competition among
the political parties rather than to fuel more partisan
confrontation.
</P>
<P>
Lin said he has no plans to run in the 2008 election himself, but
he did not totally exclude the option of running in the future.
