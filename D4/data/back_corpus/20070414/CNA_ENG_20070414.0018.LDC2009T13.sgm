NO TIMETABLE FOR RESUMPTION OF NEW ZEALAND APPLE IMPORTS: COA
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taipei, April 14 (CNA) 04/14/07  17:00:58 (By Lilian Wu)

<P>
There is no timetable on any resumption of New Zealand apple
imports to Taiwan, an official of the Council of Agriculture
(COA) said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Yeh Ying, deputy director of COA's Bureau of Animal and Plant
Health Inspection and Quarantine, made the remarks after Taiwan
suspended New Zealand apple imports due to a codling moth larvae
found in a batch of New Zealand apples that arrived Thursday at
Taichung Harbor, central Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
The 1,029 cartons of Fuji apples from New Zealand were determined
to have failed the quarantine inspection.
</P>
<P>
Yeh said the COA notified the New Zealand Commerce and Industrial
Office in Taipei and that the office sent staff to investigate
the matter.
</P>
<P>
"Taiwan will decide when to resume imports of New Zealand apples
after reviewing its progress in the eradication of agriculture
pests," she said.
</P>
<P>
According to regulations concerning the handling of apples
imported from countries and regions with codling moths, the
contaminated apples will be either returned or destroyed.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan will also temporarily suspend imports of New Zealand
apples until Wellington looks into the reasons for the pest's
presence, adopts measures to improve inspections and notifies
Taiwan that it is free of codling moths. Until such steps are
taken, its apples will not be allowed to enter Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Yeh noted that the codling moth lays eggs on apples and the
larvae feed on the fruit, burrowing into the fruit before leaving
to overwinter and pupate elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
If the moth adapts to Taiwan's climate, it could attack apples,
pears and peaches, causing great damage, Yeh added.
</P>
<P>
She pointed out that the United States has imported a lot of
tropical fruit from Central and Southern America, which often
carries the Mediterranean fruit fly, so that California and
Florida see their fruit crops affected from time to time.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan has no Mediterranean fruit fly, but does have the oriental
fruit fly, which affects more than 30 fruits. Taiwan fruit has
therefore to be fumigated before export to kill any oriental
fruit fly larvae.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that in 2006, apples from New Zealand accounted
for 12.3 percent of all apples imported into Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan has imported New Zealand apples for more than a decade,
and this is the first time that codling moth has been found, COA
officials said. Taiwan has not found this pest in apples from
other countries this year, COA officials added.
