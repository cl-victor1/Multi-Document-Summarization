<P>
Former President Lee Teng-hui underwent minor heart surgery
Saturday at the Veterans General Hospital in Taipei.
</P>
<P>
Doctors inserted a balloon to help open his narrowed arteries to
allow them to implant stents more easily. Altogether, the former
president, 84, has had 11 stents implanted.
</P>
<P>
Doctors said the surgery went smoothly  and that Lee was
recovering well, although he will stay in the hospital for two or
three days for observation.
</P>
<P>
Lee has had heart surgery three times before. Doctors considered
his age would not allow a coronary bypass surgery and conducted
less invasive cauterization surgery.
</P>
<P>
Lee went to the hospital for a checkup last month and was
diagnosed with a narrowed coronary artery.
