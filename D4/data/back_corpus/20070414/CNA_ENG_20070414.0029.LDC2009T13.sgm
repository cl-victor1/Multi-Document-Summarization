ALL DPP PRESIDENTIAL ASPIRANTS OPPOSE UNIFICATION WITH CHINA
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  April 14 (CNA) 04/14/07  20:11:44 (By Lilian Wu)

The four presidential aspirants of the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) might differ on many issues, but they all
agree that Taiwan is a sovereign, independent country that should
not unify with China.
</P>
<P>
The four hopefuls -- Vice President Annette Lu, DPP Chairman Yu
Shyi-kun, Premier Su Tseng-chang and former Premier Frank Hsieh
-- echoed the views in response to questions on whether they
favor unification with China and on their views on promoting the
nation's diplomatic work, in the first of two forums sponsored by
the DPP to give the public a chance to hear a little about their
respective platforms.
</P>
<P>
Yu said unification with China is not an option and that it would
mean Taiwan being swallowed up by China and being relegated to a
province.
</P>
<P>
He also said Taiwan enjoys important strategic value and should
forge alliances with other democratic countries.
</P>
<P>
"There should be an Asia-Pacific strategy before a China
strategy," he added.
</P>
<P>
Su said Taiwan's future should be decided by its people and that
no Taiwanese will favor unification with China. If elected
president, he will continue to push for Taiwan-centric
consciousness, he added.
</P>
<P>
Su also said that although Taiwan maintains diplomatic relations
with only 24 countries, Taiwan's economic muscle should help it
on the difficult diplomatic front.
</P>
<P>
Hsieh claimed that Ma Ying-jeou, former chairman of the main
opposition Kuomintang (KMT) and the most likely bet of the party
in the 2008 presidential election, is now echoing the DPP's long-
standing stance that Taiwan's future should be decided by its
people.
</P>
<P>
But he said the distinction between the DPP and the KMT is that
that the former advocates moving toward independence, while the
KMT advocates eventual unification with China.
</P>
<P>
Hsieh said that although the number of countries that maintain
diplomatic ties with Taiwan is limited, Taiwan has a vibrant
economy that will help it seek a diplomatic breakthrough amid
China's relentless obstruction.
</P>
<P>
Lu said that there is no question about Taiwan being a sovereign,
independent country, noting that its first popular presidential
election was held in 1996.
</P>
<P>
She also said that democracy is what makes Taiwan stands out and
that the nation should promote its democratic ideals, which,
combined with the vibrant private sector, will make Taiwan shine
in the international community.
