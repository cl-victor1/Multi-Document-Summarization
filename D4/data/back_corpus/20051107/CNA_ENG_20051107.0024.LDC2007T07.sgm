Taipei,  Nov.  7 (CNA) (By Deborah Kuo)

Taiwan will consider tightening its bird flu-response measures,
particularly on passengers from China, if cases of bird flu spreading
from poultry to humans are confirmed in China, a Department of Health
(DOH) official said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Lin Ting, deputy director-general of the DOH's Center for Disease
Control, said that so far 16 Chinese provinces and administrative
districts, including Anhui, Liaoning and Inner Mongolia, have been hit
by bird flu outbreaks with hundreds of thousands of poultry being
destroyed to stem the animal disease from spreading.

<P>
In the southern Chinese province of Hunan, Lin said, three people
reportedly have been infected with a pneumonia for unknown reasons.
Among them, a young girl was suspected of having contracted bird flu
carrying the deadly H5N1 strain. The cause of her death is not
expected to be discovered as her body has already been cremated, Lin
added.

<P>
Currently, Taiwan is bird flu-free but is preparing to battle a
possible bird flu pandemic, taking bird flu-response measures
including seeking to mass produce the influenza medicine Tamiflu from
its patent holder, Roche Pharmaceuticals AG, Lin noted.
</P>
<P>
Liu said that in a bid to keep bird flu at bay, Taiwan visitors to
China are advised not to come into direct contact with poultry, live
or dead. For those returning or coming to Taiwan from China, it is
advised that they conduct a 10-day self-health monitoring program,
including daily temperature taking, after their arrival, he added.
