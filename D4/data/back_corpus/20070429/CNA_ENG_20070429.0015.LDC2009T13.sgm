Taiwan's brand name textile manufacturers are setting their eyes
on China's vast market where consumers' purchase power has been
steadily increasing.
</P>
<P>
A delegation representing 10 well-known garment companies in
Taiwan, led by officials from the Taiwan Textile Federation
(TTD), visited department stores in three of China's major cities
-- Chengdu, Tianjin and Beijing -- in mid-April before returning
to Taiwan last week.
</P>
<P>
TTD officials  told reporters  Sunday that members of the
delegation have felt after the trip that China, with its vast
population, is a market full of business opportunities and one
that Taiwan's textile producers cannot afford to neglect.
</P>
<P>
The officials added that if Taiwan's garment producers want to
make inroads into the Chinese market, they should distinguish
themselves from textile producers of other countries by supplying
high-end elegant, tasteful, brand name products.
</P>
<P>
They said the Taiwan Textile Federation will organize another
trip to Beijing by Taiwan brand name garment manufacturers in
November and present a fashion show there to allow them to
promote their products.
