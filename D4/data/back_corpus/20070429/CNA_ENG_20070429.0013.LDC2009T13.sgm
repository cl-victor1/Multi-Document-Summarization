STOP BICKERING OR FACE BOYCOTT: DPP WHIP
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  April  29  (CNA) 04/29/07  16:36:09 (By Deborah Kuo)

The legislative caucus whip of the Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) on Sunday called for the four DPP presidential aspirants to
immediately stop bickering among themselves or they will risk
being boycotted by the ruling party in the upcoming DPP
presidential primary.
</P>
<P>
Wang Sing-nan said that grass-roots DPP members have become
"extremely upset" about the smear and mudslinging campaign
tactics that the four hopefuls -- Vice President Annette Lu,
Premier Su Tseng-chang, DPP Chairman Yu Shyi-kun and former
Premier Frank Hsieh -- have engaged in their attempts to broaden
their support prior to the DPP primary next month.
</P>
<P>
If these four continue to conduct undesirable and tasteless
campaign schemes, they will be dumped by DPP supporters sooner or
later, Wang claimed.
</P>
<P>
Wang added that the DPP legislative caucus will publicize at a
news conference Monday its "countermeasures" against those who
continue to lodge personal attacks on rivals.
</P>
<P>
The DPP whip made the remarks after Lu, Yu and Hsieh teamed up at
a news conference Friday in criticizing Su for allegedly using
public resources in his campaign for the party's presidential
primary.
</P>
<P>
Lu, Yu and Hsieh reportedly called for mayors and county chiefs
of the seven cities and counties in southern Taiwan --
traditionally DPP ballot barns in major elections -- to keep
neutral in the upcoming DPP presidential primary.
</P>
<P>
Unexpectedly, all the seven southern mayors and county chiefs
appeared at Su's speech dais when Su was on campaign trail in
southern Taiwan Saturday.
