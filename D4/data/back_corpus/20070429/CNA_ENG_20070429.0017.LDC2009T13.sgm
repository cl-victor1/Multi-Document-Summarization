A qualifying round for the 2007 Mahjong World Championship began
in Taipei Sunday, with 150 contestants taking part in three days
of competition.
</P>
<P>
The competition in Taipei is part of a series of regional
qualifying tournaments in Asia, Europe and North America.
</P>
<P>
The eight top winners in the Taipei event will qualify to move on
to the semi- finals, to be held in June in either Denmark or
Japan. A total of 20 finalists will earn the right to join the
grand finale, the Mahjong World Championship, in November in the
city of Chengdu in China's Sichuan province.

GigaMedia Global Limited, a provider of online entertainment
software and services, has secured a five-year exclusive right to
co-host the Mahjong World Championship in conjunction with the
World Mahjong Organization -- the official international body
that sets the rules of the game and competition standards.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for GigaMedia said the company plans to hold a
Mahjong World Championship in Taipei within the next five years.
</P>
<P>
Mahjong is said to have originated in China about 2,500 years
ago, but the four- person game assumed its current form in the
19th century.
</P>
<P>
Organizers of the Mahjong World Championship have indicated that
they plan to turn the competition into an event "as big as the
World Series of Poker," with television programming, corporate
sponsorships and awards totaling millions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
They said that playing the game for fun should also be accepted,
instead of merely focusing on it as a form of gambling.
