STUDENT LABOR RIGHTS GROUP CALLS FOR LARGER HOURLY WAGE HIKE
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taipei,  April 29 (CNA) 04/29/07  16:45:03 (By Sofia Wu)

<P>
A student labor rights advocacy group urged the government Sunday
to set a higher minimum hourly wage for part-time workers than
what the Council of Labor Affairs (CLA) has recommended.
</P>
<P>
A spokeswoman for the activist group known as the Young Laborers
95 Alliance said the minimum hourly wage should be raised to
between NT$101 and NT$103 in terms of the new CLA-proposed hourly
wage calculating formula, not the CLA- recommended NT$93 to
NT$95.
</P>
<P>
After a three-hour meeting on Friday, the CLA's wage reviewing
committee came up with a package of recommendations to adjust the
country's minimum monthly and hourly wages, both of which have
been frozen for 10 years.
</P>
<P>
According to the committee's recommendations, the minimum monthly
wage should be raised by 7.5 percent to 9.5 percent. That means
the minimum monthly wage will be adjusted upwards to between
NT$17,028 and NT$17,345 from the current NT$15,840.
</P>
<P>
In response to calls from part-time workers, the committee also
suggested that the minimum payment for those paid by hour be
raised to between NT$93 and NT$95 from the present NT$66.
</P>
<P>
The recommended minimum hourly wage reflects a shortened work
week that has been in place for monthly wage earners for several
years. The new calculating formula also allows for a weekly off
day for part-time workers. At present, the minimum hourly wage is
calculated on a 30-work-day-per-month and eight-work-hour-per-day
formula. The new calculating formula is based on a criteria of
182.66 work hours per month.
</P>
<P>
The 95 Alliance spokeswoman claimed that the minimum hourly wage
calculated in terms of the CLA recommended new formula should
range between NT$101 and NT$103, rather than between NT$93 and
NT$95.
</P>
<P>
If the rise in the consumer price index over the past decade is
taken into account, the spokeswoman said a more reasonable
minimum hourly wage would be NT$125.
</P>
<P>
The most unbearable point in the CLA-proposed adjustment package
lies in its failure to allow hourly wage earners to ask for
double pay when they work on national holidays, the spokeswoman
said.
</P>
<P>
"The CLA has violated the Labor Standards Law in its ban on part-
time workers or hourly wage earners to claim double pay for
working on national holidays since the law has such a provision,"
she said, adding that the 95 Alliance will organize a protest at
the Executive Yuan Monday to push for a removal of such an
illegal ban.
