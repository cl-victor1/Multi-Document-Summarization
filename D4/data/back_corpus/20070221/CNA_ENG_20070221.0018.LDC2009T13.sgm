The annual flower season at Yangmingshan National Park is now in
full swing, attracting nearly 100,000 visitors daily during the
Lunar New Year holiday and causing serious traffic jams on roads
leading from the city of Taipei to its "back garden".
</P>
<P>
The flower festival formally began Feb. 20 and will last 34 days
until March 25. It is one of Taipei's five major flower shows
throughout the year.

More than 2,000 cherry trees in the park are in full bloom. Other
flowers presently  blooming are camellia,  peach and Hydrangea
chinensis.

<P>
In addition to opening during normal day-time hours, the park
will provide sufficient lighting to allow visitors to view cherry
blossoms between 6 p.m. and 9 p.m. daily.

Officials at the Taipei city government's Parks and Street Lights
Office urged people planning a trip to the park to use public
transport and avoid having their trips spoiled by traffic
congestion.

<P>
Related activities, including performances by street artists,
will be held during the festival to entertain the visitors, said
officials.
