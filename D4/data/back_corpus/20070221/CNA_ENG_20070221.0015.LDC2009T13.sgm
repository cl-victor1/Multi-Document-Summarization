The new housing market in the central Taiwan city of Taichung
recorded growth of more than 7 percent last year and is expected
to grow even more rapidly in 2007, market experts said Wednesday.

Wang  Chung-cheng,  chairman  of the Taichung  Real Estate
Development Association, quoted statistics showing that new
housing projects launched in Taichung during 2006 amounted to
NT$117.15 billion (US$3.54 billion) in total value, an increase
of NT$9.5 billion, or 7.7 percent, from 2005.

<P>
According to Wang, the city's Hsitun District was the most
sought-after neighborhood for house buyers because of its close
proximity to the city's amenities, including the new civic
center, the Taichung Opera House and the Central Taiwan Science
Park.

<P>
Statistics show that new housing projects launched in Hsitun
District in 2006 totaled NT$31.25 billion, accounting for 35
percent of the new housing market in Taichung.

Wang attributed  Taichung's  booming new housing market to
increased employment opportunities brought by the Central Taiwan
Science Park and a number of newly opened hypermarkets, as well
as the launch of the first high speed railway traversing Taiwan's
west corridor.

He predicted that 2007 would see even more rapid growth in
Taichung's new housing market, with the total value of new
projects launched in the year reaching NT$150 billion.
