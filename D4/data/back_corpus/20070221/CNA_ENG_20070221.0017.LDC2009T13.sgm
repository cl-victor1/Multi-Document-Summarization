U.S. CONGRESSMAN PUSHES FOR PASSAGE OF TAIWAN ARMS BILL
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  Feb.  21 (CNA) 02/21/07  19:30:59 (By Deborah Kuo)

Visiting U. S. Congressman Steve Chabot (R-Ohio) said Wednesday
that as a close friend of Taiwan, he will continue to offer
Taiwan his resolute support in Congress, but also hopes that
Taiwan's legislature would pass the long-stalled arms bill to
demonstrate the island's determination to defend itself.
</P>
<P>
Chabot, co-chairman of the U.S. Congressional Taiwan Caucus, made
the statement during a visit to Joseph Wu,  chairman of the
Cabinet-level Council of Mainland Affairs, who is Taiwan's top
China policy planner.
</P>
<P>
A bill on an arms procurement package from the United States --
which includes eight diesel-electric submarines, a squadron of 12
P-3C anti-submarine aircraft and six Patriot PAC III anti-missile
batteries  --  has been  blocked  by the opposition-controlled
legislature over 70 times since it was first submitted in
mid-2004.
</P>
<P>
The budget for the arms procurement package from the United
States was slashed from NT$610.8 billion to NT$480 billion in
2005 to placate opposition lawmakers. It was further reduced to
NT$340 billion to cover only the purchase of the submarines and
sub-hunting aircraft.
</P>
<P>
During the visit, Wu said, he expressed appreciation on behalf of
the government to Chabot for the congressman's long-standing,
staunch support for Taiwan's cause and also called for continued
U.S. support of Taiwan's bid to join the World Health
Organization and other major international organizations.
</P>
<P>
In response to Chabot's inquiries about Taiwan's reaction to
China's Taiwan policies, Wu said that Beijing has been adept at
employing two-pronged strategy -- showing so-called "goodwill" to
the people of Taiwan on one hand while marginalizing Taiwan on
the world stage and building up its military forces targeting
Taiwan on the other.
</P>
<P>
Beijing has relentlessly strangled Taiwan's attempts to gain
maneuvering room in the international community, most recently
barring Taiwan from joining the World Health Organization and
many other NGOs, organizations supposedly least influenced by
politics and completely concerning people's well-being, Wu said.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Wu said, despite China's relentless efforts to
choke off Taiwan, militarily and diplomatically, the Mainland
Affairs Council has done its utmost to improve bilateral
relations with China in order to maintain peace across the Taiwan
Strait.
</P>
<P>
Council efforts to help alleviate tensions across the strait
included persistent  calls for cross-strait  negotiations  and
stepped-up exchanges; the opening of direct cross-strait cargo
and passenger  charter  flight  services; as  well  as  Taiwan's
cross-the-board opening up to Chinese citizens for leisure trips,
Wu told Chabot.
</P>
<P>
Wu said to Chabot that it is keenly hoped that all Chinese
citizens will be allowed to travel to Taiwan for tourism and to
experience Taiwan society and its democracy for themselves so
that people from the two sides will better understand each other,
indirectly enhancing peace and stability across the strait.
