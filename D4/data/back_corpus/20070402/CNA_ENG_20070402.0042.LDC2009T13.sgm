Sex-related studies are greatly beneficial to Taiwanese society
as many social problems are related to sex, according to a
professor at Shu-Te University's Graduate School of Human
Sexuality.
</P>
<P>
Lin Yen-chin, the director of the only school of its kind in
Taiwan and Asia, made the remarks Saturday at a press conference
aimed at recruiting new doctorate students.
</P>
<P>
The graduate school opened last year and recruited three students
for its doctorate program -- two of whom are medical doctors
while the other is an instructor at an air force college.
</P>
<P>
Two students present at the press conference said that Taiwanese
society is too conservative and that people in Taiwan have many
misperceptions regarding sex.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the general public has a limited understanding of
studies of sexuality, Lin said that sex plays a very important
role in human relationships, and in some pressing problems.
</P>
<P>
Lin pointed out that her school conducts research on the impact
of sex among humans. The scope of the research includes sex
education, sex therapy, sex consultation, as well as sex and
society, she noted.
</P>
<P>
Sex assaults, sexual harassment and domestic violence are also
covered, she added, adding that all such research can produce
benefits for society.
