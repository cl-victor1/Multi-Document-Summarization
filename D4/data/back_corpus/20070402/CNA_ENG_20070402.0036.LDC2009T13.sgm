KMT LAWMAKERS TO PROPOSE AMENDMENT TO COURT ORGANIC LAW
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  April 2 (CNA) 04/02/07  21:58:55 (By Elizabeth Hsu)

<P>
The legislative caucus of the opposition Kuomintang (KMT) will
propose an amendment to the Court Organic Law to endow the
Prosecutors' Personnel Review Committee (PPRC) with the
substantial right to review planned personnel adjustments in the
prosecutorial system, two KMT lawmakers said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Legislators Kao Su-po and Joanna C. Lei made the announcement at
a press conference at the Legislative Yuan, explaining that they
proposed the amendment after the Ministry of Justice (MOJ)
decided March 28 to replace 12 chief prosecutors in high and
district prosecutors offices, including high-profile Hsieh Wen-
ting, chief prosecutor of the Taiwan High Prosecutors Office,
without seeking a consensus from the PPRC.
</P>
<P>
Kao said no one knew Hsieh would be subject to the reshuffle
before March 28, noting that the move is directly responsible for
the absence of nine of 17 PPRC members from a committee meeting
debating the MOJ decision.
</P>
<P>
Kao described the reshuffle as the "Wednesday Massacre, "
comparing it with the "Saturday Night Massacre" of Oct. 20, 1973,
when then president of the United States, Richard M. Nixon,
compelled the attorney general and his deputy to resign due to
his own alleged involvement in the Watergate scandal.
</P>
<P>
Kao said that the existing Article 51 of the Court Organic Law
states that the minister of justice has the right to make
decisions on personnel adjustments, but needs to consult with the
PPRC in advance.
</P>
<P>
Justice Minister Shih Mao-lin, however, nullified the PPRC's
consultative function in accordance with an attempt by the
Democratic Progressive Party government to line up chief
prosecutors whose legal opinions favor the first lady, Wu Shu-
jen, who is on trial for indictment on charges of embezzlement
from a special state affairs fund set aside for the president's
discretionary use, the lawmaker accused.
</P>
<P>
In this regard, Lei said, the KMT legislative caucus has decided
to push for an amendment to the article to endow the PPRC, which
is at present only a consultant organization to the minister of
justice, with the power to screen personnel before a proposed
reshuffle.
</P>
<P>
Lei added that the KMT caucus will submit the bill on the
amendment to the legislative procedures committee for it to be
placed on the agenda of the legislative session.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, in response to media inquiries on the move to transfer
Hsieh away from his current position, Shih explained that the
High Prosecutors Office needs to reinforce its operations in the
fields of sexual offense monitoring, prisoners' human rights, and
protection of the victims of crimes, which will collectively
require the promotion of a new leader.
</P>
<P>
Shih also expressed his gratitude to Hsieh for his contributions,
while denying that Hsieh is being replaced because of his alleged
inability to fulfill recent orders.
</P>
<P>
Media reprots speculated that Hsieh's transfer might be the
result of political interference, as the chief prosecutor is in
charge of a probe into the first lady's alleged embezzlement.
Media reports claimed that the Presidential Office had applied
pressure to the prosecutor in an attempt to make him drop the
case.
