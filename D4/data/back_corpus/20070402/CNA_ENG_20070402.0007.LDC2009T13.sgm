CAMPAIGN AGAINST FOOT-AND-MOUTH DISEASE ENTERS CRITICAL PERIOD
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  April  2 (CNA) 04/02/07  13:32:14 (By Sofia Wu)
</P>
<P>
The campaign to rid the country of foot-and-mouth disease (FMD)
has entered a critical period, with hog ranches around Taiwan
gradually halting the vaccination of their pigs in five phases
beginning Monday.
</P>
<P>
Council of Agriculture (COA) officials in charge of animal health
inspection and quarantine urged local hog and swine farmers to
cooperate with the government in efforts to wipe out the highly
contagious animal disease once and for all.
</P>
<P>
FMD is one of the most contagious diseases among mammals and has
a great potential for causing severe economic losses. It affects
cloven-hoofed animals.
</P>
<P>
A major FMD outbreak in March 1997 dealt a severe blow to
Taiwan's hog industry, as FMD-affected countries are banned from
exporting pork and related products.
</P>
<P>
The outbreak 10 years ago led to the culling of millions of hogs,
and all pig farmers have since been required to have their
animals vaccinated regularly. Thanks to the concerted efforts of
the public and private sectors, no further FMD cases have been
reported since February 2001.
</P>
<P>
On May 22, 2004, the Paris-based World Organization for Animal
Health  (OIE) recognized  Taiwan  as an "FMD-free  zone with
vaccination."
</P>
<P>
The government's ultimate goal is to obtain OIE certification as
an "FMD-free zone without vaccination" in two years, COA
officials said, adding that to attain this goal, local hog
ranches must stop vaccinating their livestock in a gradual manner
beginning this month.
</P>
<P>
On an experimental basis, inoculation of pigs raised on the
outlying island of Penghu has been suspended since March 2006. As
the program has proceeded smoothly, the COA has decided to expand
the experiment to hog farms on Taiwan proper in five stages.
</P>
<P>
Each stage will last for four months. In the first stage, only
hogs raised in the center pen of each ranch should stop receiving
FMD inoculation. Those hogs will be subject to close surveillance
for health checks.
</P>
<P>
In the second stage, inoculation should stop for pigs in one pen
in each barn, and in the third stage, vaccination should cease
for pigs in one-third of pens in each barn. In the fourth stage,
inoculation should stop for pigs in half of the pens in each
barn.
</P>
<P>
In the first four states,  inoculation  of stud pigs and grass-
eating herbivores, including cattle, goat and deer, will not be
ceased. If all goes well, the vaccination cessation project will
enter the fifth  and final stage in August  2008,  with an
across-the-board suspension of inoculation.
</P>
<P>
According to OIE regulations, a country can be listed as "FMD-
free without vaccination" only if no vaccination has been
administered for a full year and if no new FMD cases have been
reported during that period, which means that Taiwan may reclaim
"FMD-free zone without vaccination" status in 2009 at the
earliest.
</P>
<P>
After Taiwan was declared an "FMD-free zone with vaccination" in
2004, pork exports to Japan were partially resumed -- for cooked
or processed pork products -- with an annual value of about
NT$100 million (about US$3.03 million).
</P>
<P>
Prior to the 1997 epidemic, Taiwan raised more than 14 million
hogs a year, with annual production value amounting to NT$100
billion, half of which was generated from pork exports to Japan.
</P>
<P>
The disease has had a seriously adverse impact on Taiwan's
livestock and foodstuff industries. Over the past decade,
Taiwan's annual hog production has dropped steadily, to only 7.09
million hogs last year, with the industry's total annual
production value falling to below NT$60 billion.
