LEGISLATIVE SPEAKER NOT TO RUN IN KMT PRIMARY
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taipei, April 2 (CNA) 04/02/07  17:01:51 (By Sofia Wu)

<P>
Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng said Monday he will not
run in the main opposition Kuomintang's (KMT's) primary for the
2008 presidential election because the party's rules are custom-
made to cater to a "certain individual" and therefore cannot
ensure a fair contest.
</P>
<P>
Wang, a former KMT vice chairman, made the announcement in an
unusual reading out of a statement at a news conference held at
the Legislative Yuan a day after former KMT Chairman Ma Ying-jeou
said he will run in the next presidential election even if he is
convicted of corruption in the first trial.
</P>
<P>
As the KMT charter stipulates that any party member who is
convicted in the first trial is not eligible to run in any
political election under the party's banner, Ma's insistence on
joining the presidential election would require a revision to the
party charter.
</P>
<P>
Wang lamented that the KMT has been dominated by a minority
ethnic group since it moved its seat to Taiwan from China in
1949. As this phenomenon has never been addressed, he said, the
party has failed to win grass-roots majority support, which
eventually resulted in its loss of power in the 2000 presidential
election.
</P>
<P>
If the party continues to ignore this problem, Wang said, this
will definitely affect the party's performance in the upcoming
legislative and presidential elections.
</P>
<P>
Anticipating that Ma will register his candidacy for the KMT
presidential primary in the coming days, Wang reminded his party
that the district court will also begin proceedings on Ma's
alleged special allowance fund misappropriation case this week.
</P>
<P>
Warning that the court proceedings could cast clouds over the
party's prospects in the 2008 presidential election, Wang said
the party should urgently establish a crisis management mechanism
to ensure that the KMT-led "pan-blue alliance" will not be absent
from the 2008 race because of judicial or political factors.
</P>
<P>
At this  critical  moment,  Wang  said,  the party  needs
forward-looking planning. As to Ma's announcement of his
intention to invite Wang to serve as his running mate, Wang said
he will not consider such an offer at the moment.
</P>
<P>
Ma was indicted Feb. 13 on charges of embezzling NT$11 million
(US$332,684) from a special allowance fund budgeted for his
discretionary use during his term as Taipei mayor from 1998-2006.
