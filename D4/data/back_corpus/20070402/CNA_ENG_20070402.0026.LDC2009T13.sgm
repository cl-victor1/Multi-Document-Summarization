Imprinting identification numbers on motorbikes has greatly
reduced thefts, the Taipei City Police Department (TCPD) said
Monday.
</P>
<P>
The National Police Agency last March launched a program that
provides motorcycle owners with free imprinting of a serial
engine number or license plate number on several parts of their
bikes, with the aim of discouraging thieves by making disposal of
their loot more difficult.
</P>
<P>
TCPD tallies showed that it has assisted in the imprinting of
215,000 motorcycles since the beginning of the program. Officials
said the reported number of motorbike thefts from July 2006 to
Feb. 2007 in its precinct has dropped by 12.62 percent compared
to the same period a year earlier: specifically, from 6995 cases
to 6112.
</P>
<P>
The government has this year made motorbike imprinting compulsory
by making it a condition for vehicle license renewal and ordering
that motorbike manufacturers put identification numbers on their
products firsthand.
