Taipei,  Jan.  8 (CNA) 01/08/07  19:45:59 (By Flor Wang)

Although Minister of Finance Ho Chih-chin has repeatedly vowed
that all depositors at the Chinese Bank will have their money
reimbursed from the national coffers, opposition and ruling
lawmakers Monday demanded that Ho resign for what they described
as dereliction of duty over a bank run earlier that day.
</P>
<P>
Ho again offered his assurance while responding to questions from
lawmakers at a legislative committee after a run on the Chinese
Bank last Friday. Customers rushed to the bank, an operational
unit of the Rebar group, to withdraw their deposits after two
Rebar subsidiaries filed for bankruptcy protection last Thursday.
</P>
<P>
According to Ho, customers' deposits at the Chinese Bank, no
matter whatever the amount,  will be fully protected  by the
government. The Ministry of Finance has asked the Central Deposit
Insurance Corp. (CDIC) to take over the bank in compliance with
the law, he said.
</P>
<P>
In total, the CDIC and the Financial Reconstruction Fund have
managed to acquire NT$30 billion in cash from the Central Bank
and other banks to deal with the Chinese Bank case, he pointed
out. The CDIC has taken over the Chinese Bank following a bank
run last Friday.
</P>
<P>
Main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) lawmakers Lo Ming-tsai and Chen
Chih-ping argued that Ho must step down, claiming that he has no
idea of how severe the incident is.
</P>
<P>
Their KMT counterpart Alex Fai also claimed that Ho is not
qualified to hold the post.
</P>
<P>
Regarding Ho's response that he did not underestimate or neglect
the seriousness of the bank run, Yu Cheng-tao, a lawmaker of the
ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), said that he felt
ashamed of Ho's answer and demanded that the minister step down.
</P>
<P>
Until Monday noon, as much as NT$7.6 billion in cash were
withdrawn by Chinese Bank clients across Taiwan. The bank has 37
branches around the country.
