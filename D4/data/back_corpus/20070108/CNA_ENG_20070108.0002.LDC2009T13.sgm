Taiwan's diplomatic allies are not likely to take advantage of
its diplomatic tug-of-war with rival China to "extort" an
astronomical amount of aid out of its national coffers, the
Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) said in a press statement.
</P>
<P>
The ministry was responding to a newspaper report that claimed
that some of Taiwan's Latin American allies have become good at
using a double-handed strategy to squeeze diplomatic aid from
Taiwan by cashing in on its diplomatic standoff with China.
</P>
<P>
The report was sheer speculation and not factual, the statement
said, adding that diplomatic relations between Taiwan and its
allies have been built on a long-term trust and sincere
friendship.
</P>
<P>
Stressing that Taiwan's allies are unlikely to take advantage of
its longstanding diplomatic rivalry with China to "extort" an
exorbitant sum of aid, the statement said the government's
foreign aid projects have been transparent and subjected to
legislative approval and supervision.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the statement said Taiwan's financial aid for its
diplomatic allies have focused on those conducive to recipient
countries' economic development and improvement of their people's
livelihoods and welfare services.
</P>
<P>
Despite China's intensified diplomatic offensive, the ministry
said Taiwan has long refrained from engaging in checkbook
diplomacy.
