PRESIDENT HEADS FOR SAN FRANCISCO EN ROUTE TO NICARAGUA
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  Jan.  8 (CNA) 01/08/07  23:23:43 (By Sofia Wu)
</P>
<P>
President Chen Shui-bian headed for San Francisco  Monday en
route to Nicaragua to attend Nicaraguan President-elect Daniel
Ortega's Jan. 10 inauguration.
</P>
<P>
Chen and his entourage will make an overnight transit stop in the
California city before heading to the Nicaraguan capital,
Managua, for Wednesday's inauguration.
</P>
<P>
The last time President Chen set foot on U.S. soil was when he
made a transit stop in Miami in 2005.
</P>
<P>
In his pre-departure speech at Taiwan Taoyuan International
Airport, Chen thanked the U.S. government for granting him
courteous treatment and other assistance during his transit stay,
in line with the principles of safety, convenience, comfort and
dignity.
</P>
<P>
Because of China's relentless diplomatic suppression, Chen said,
Taiwan faces a tall order in its diplomatic work. The situation
has become even grim and arduous under China's new diplomatic
offensive of aiming to lure away all of Taiwan's diplomatic
allies, shutting Taiwan out of all international organizations
and activities and denying Taiwan any opportunity for talks on an
equal footing.
</P>
<P>
Despite all the challenges and tribulation, Chen said, Taiwan
must not be daunted by any diplomatic setbacks and should instead
reach out to the world courageously and with perseverence.
</P>
<P>
"We should grasp every opportunity to reach out to the world so
the international community will understand Taiwan's existence as
an independent, sovereign state, and that the two sides of the
Taiwan Strait exist as two countries that do not belong to each
other, " Chen said.
</P>
<P>
Denigrating the government's foreign aid projects as "checkbook
diplomacy" is unfair and unreasonable, Chen said, adding that
financial aid and technical assistance to diplomatic allies are
based on goodwill and sincere friendship.
</P>
<P>
"All our aid projects are prudently designed to help boost the
national development of our allies and improve the livelihoods of
their people, " Chen said, adding that those mutually beneficial
programs must not be dismissed as "dollar diplomacy."
</P>
<P>
During his two-day visit to Nicaragua Jan. 10-11, Chen is
scheduled to meet with leaders of the Taiwan expatriate
community, Taiwan volunteers  and Taiwan military  conscripts
working in Nicaragua. He will also hold two news conferences,
Presidential Office officials said.
</P>
<P>
Vice President Annette Lu, Premier Su Tseng-chang, Legislative
Yuan President Wang Jin-pyng and other ranking government
officials were on hand at the airport to bid farewell to the
president.
</P>
<P>
Chen's entourage includes ruling Democratic Progressive Party
Chairman Yu Shyi- kun, Taoyuan Magistrate Chu Li-lun, Tainan
Mayor Hsu Tien-tsai, Kaohsiung Magistrate Yang Chiu-hsing and six
business leaders, including Taiwan Power Co. President Chen Kuei-
ming.
</P>
<P>
Shortly after Ortega's electoral victory in November last year,
Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Hou Ching-shan visited Nicaragua
at the head of a working-level delegation  to hold talks  with
ministers-designate of the incoming Ortega administration.
</P>
<P>
As Ortega said during the presidential campaign that if elected,
he would switch diplomatic recognition from Taipei to Beijing,
Chen's visit to Nicaragua is considered a fence-mending effort to
shore up bilateral relations.
