High-quality rice grown in Taiwan has gained in popularity in
Japan, with 180 metric tons of rice cultivated in eastern Taitung
county to be exported to the country by later this year, a
government official said Monday.

<P>
According to a spokesman for the Agriculture and Food Agency
under the Cabinet- level Council of Agriculture (COA), some 180
metric tons of Chihshang and Kuanshan rice produced in Taitung
will be exported to Japan, with the first half batch of 90 metric
tons slated to be shipped Friday.
</P>
<P>
The two categories of locally grown rice have already passed
Japan's food safety quarantine scrutiny, and the shipment to the
quality-conscious Japanese market will come after a shipment to
Japan of Fulee rice in 2004 from Hualien county, which borders
Taitung county, the spokesman noted.

<P>
Encouraged by the success of Taiwan rice in Japan, Taiwan farmers
are seeking to further explore the Japanese market in a bid to
build a fine-quality image for their crops, the spokesman said.

<P>
Most Taiwan rice exported to Japan is purchased by restaurants or
sold in small packs at retail stores to the general public.
