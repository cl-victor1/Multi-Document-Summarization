A woman in Taipei donated five violins and a cello to the
Taichung-based Taiwan Fund for Children and Families Monday and
asked the charity organization to use the instruments to help
underprivileged children with musical talent.
</P>
<P>
Workers at the fund said they received a large parcel from Ms. Wu
Fu-mei, a resident of Taipei, and found that inside were five
violins and a cello.
</P>
<P>
The donor said in an accompanying note that she is a retired
public servant and life-long violin player, and that she no
longer needs the violins and cello because her children only play
the piano.
</P>
<P>
She asked the Taiwan Fund for Children and Family to use the
instruments to help children who want to learn how to play the
violin or cello, but cannot afford to buy one.
</P>
<P>
Liao Chih-wen, a spokesman for the fund, noted that of the 38,000
underprivileged children sponsored by donors through the fund, at
least 75 have special talents, including some with musical
talent.
</P>
<P>
He said the instruments will be sent separately to Kaohsiung,
Tainan and Taipei to allow selected children to develop their
musical gifts.
