Slippery floors were listed as one of many household hazards in a
report released Monday by the Taipei City Department of Health,
after an investigation was carried out to help people spot what
can easily cause life-threatening accidents at home.
</P>
<P>
The department conducted the investigation last year, with 4,264
households around the city examined by home safety experts based
on a list of 198 household hazards, in places including the
living room, kitchen, bedroom, restroom, balcony and the front
doors.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, the most frequent household hazards are
glassy and slippery floors, no installation of smoke detectors,
no facilities for the elderly to call for help and outdated fire
extinguishers.

Also, automatic gates were often unequipped with object
detectors, and electric fans were not covered with shelter nets.
