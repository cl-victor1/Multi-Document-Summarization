Three more international artists have taken residence in the
Taipei Artist Village to join some 20 other artists from Taiwan
and abroad, officials from the Taipei Cultural Affairs
Department, which manages the village, said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The three artists are Dutch poet Erik Lindner, American sculptor
William Attaway and Japanese visual artist Tetsushi Higashino.
They are scheduled to present their work at the village in
February, according to department officials.
</P>
<P>
Lindner, who visited Taipei for one month in 2001 but did not
have much chance to experience Taiwan outside of Taipei, has
indicated that in addition to meeting people and observing Taipei
street life, this time he intends to see other parts of Taiwan to
find inspiration for his work.
</P>
<P>
Attaway is an accomplished large-scale ceramicist who owns a
studio in California. Examples of his grand and colorful work can
be seen in the neighborhoods of Los Angeles and Venice,
California. He was invited to Taiwan by former Taipei Mayor Ma
Ying-jeou during Ma's visit to Los Angeles last year.
</P>
<P>
Higashino came to Taiwan through an exchange program between
Taipei and Yokohama, Japan.  His work tends to focus on the
characteristics of victimized objects and often demonstrates a
deep interest in things that are usually deemed insignificant,
unimportant and valueless.

<P>
The Taipei Artist Village is a four-story building located in
Taipei's "governmental district." It was formerly the office
building of the the Taipei city government's Public Works
Department.
</P>
<P>
In October  2001, the city's Cultural  Affairs  Department
transformed the abandoned building into Taiwan's first
international Artist Village and followed with setting up
exchange programs with other cities around the world.
</P>
<P>
Since then more than 100 visual artists, performing artists and
writers from more than 30 countries have used the village as a
base to create and publicize their work.
