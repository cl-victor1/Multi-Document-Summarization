<P>
Taiwan proper now has only one detention facility to accommodate
illegal Chinese immigrants with the inauguration a day earlier of
the upgraded National Immigration Agency, officials said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Previously, there were two detention houses -- one in eastern
Yilan County's Lotung township and the other in northern Hsinchu
County's Nanliao township, the officials explained.
</P>
<P>
A total of 209 illegal Chinese immigrants were transferred from
the Hsinchu facility to the Lotung center late last December.
</P>
<P>
After the transfer, the Lotung center now has 505 illegal Chinese
immigrants -- 366 males and 139 females, the officials said,
adding that the center can accommodate up to 2,000 people.
</P>
<P>
There are also detention centers for illegal Chinese immigrants
on the outlying islands of Kinmen and Matsu.
