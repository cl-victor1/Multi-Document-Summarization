Eighty-two percent of Taiwan businesses will issue year-end
bonuses to their employees this year, according to the results of
a survey released Wednesday by an online employment service
provider.
</P>
<P>
The survey conducted by 104 Job Bank shows that bonuses offered
by businesses average 1.45-months' salary this year, down from
1.62-months' salary recorded in a similar survey conducted last
year.
</P>
<P>
The five sectors that offer the highest bonuses this year are the
financial, investment consultant and insurance industries, which
will issue 2.21-months' salary; the medical care, environmental
protection and health industries, which will issue 1.55-months'
salary; the wholesale and retail industries, which will issue
1.51-months' salary; the electronics and information technology
industries, which will issue 1.48-months' salary; and the
manufacturing industry, which will issue 1.45-months' salary.
</P>
<P>
The survey shows that 9.3 percent fewer large-sized businesses
will issue year- end bonuses to employees this year than last
year, while the number of medium- sized businesses, small-sized
businesses and micro-sized businesses that will do so this year
has declined 8 percent, 7.7 percent and 3.3 percent,
respectively.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the number of businesses in northern Taiwan that will
issue year-end bonuses this year has decreased by 7 percent, and
those in central Taiwan and southern Taiwan have slipped by 6.8
percent and 4.6 percent, respectively.
</P>
<P>
By contrast, the survey found that 90.5 percent of China-based
Taiwan businesses will issue year-end bonuses to their employees
this year, up 9.5 percent from last year.
</P>
<P>
These China-based businesses are offering bonuses of 1.78-months'
salary on average, which is also higher than the average amount
offered by businesses in Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
This not only reflects the business performance of China-based
enterprises over the past year but also the highly competitive
business environment in China that requires these businesses to
attract talent with good benefits and pay, job bank officials
said.
</P>
<P>
The survey was conducted among 1,304 businesses and 1,178 workers
from Dec. 20-26, with a margin of error of 2.71 percentage
points.
