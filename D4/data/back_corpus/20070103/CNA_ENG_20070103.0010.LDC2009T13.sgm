The Criminal Investigation Bureau (CIB) has asked Chinese
security authorities to help apprehend the driver of a cash
transporting van who is thought to have fled to China after
making away with NT$56 million (US$1.72 million).
</P>
<P>
Lee Han-yang, 45, reportedly stole the cash that he and a
security guard for the private security company Group 4 Securicor
were supposed to transport to two local banks in Taipei city
Tuesday morning.
</P>
<P>
Lee, who has worked with Group 4 Securicor for some four years,
reportedly drugged his colleague before making away with the huge
sum of money and fleeing to Hong Kong the same day.
</P>
<P>
Lee reportedly phoned Group 4 Securicor several hours later from
Hong Kong, telling the company that he was in Hong Kong and that
he had left his co-worker, Lin Jung-teh, passed out in the
armored vehicle.
</P>
<P>
CIB officials, who believe that Lee has since gone into hiding in
China, have asked Chinese public security authorities to help
track Lee down.
</P>
<P>
The money that Lee stole is believed to have been brought into
China via underground money exchange channels, CIB officials
said.
</P>
<P>
Lee's wife and younger brother, who were interrogated by police
after the heist, told investigators that they had perceived no
signs beforehand that Lee was considering committing such a
crime.
