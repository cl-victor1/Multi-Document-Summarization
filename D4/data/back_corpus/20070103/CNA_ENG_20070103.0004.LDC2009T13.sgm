Taipei,  Jan.  3 (CNA) 01/03/07  12:42:22 (By Y.F. Low)

The number of knowledge workers in Taiwan totalled 3.2 million
between January and November 2006, up 3.2 percent over the year-
earlier level, according to tallies released Tuesday by the
Council for Economic Planning and Development (CEPD).
</P>
<P>
The figure compares with 2.35 million in 1996 and 3.07 million in
2005, CEPD officials said.
</P>
<P>
During the first 11 months of 2006, the number of knowledge
workers accounted for 31.7 percent of the country's total
employed population, up from 25.9 percent recorded in 1996 and 31
percent in 2005, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
Among Asia's four little dragons, the number of knowledge workers
as a percentage of the employed population in 2005 in Taiwan was
lower than Singapore's 37.3 percent and Hong Kong's 34.2 percent
but higher than South Korea's 20.9 percent, they said.
</P>
<P>
A knowledge worker refers to someone who works primarily with
information or who develops and uses knowledge in the workplace,
such as lawyers, doctors, diplomats, lawmakers, marketeers,
software developers, managers and bankers.
</P>
<P>
CEPD officials pointed out that over the past 10 years, knowledge
workers have played a crucial role in boosting Taiwan's
industrial development and enhancing the country's employment
opportunities.
</P>
<P>
In particular, knowledge workers have been the prime mover of the
country's information and communications technology (ICT)
industry, with the number of knowledge workers as a ratio of the
total work force of the ICT industry increasing from 43.9 percent
in 1996 to 49.1 percent in 2005, they said.
</P>
<P>
However, they said while the increase in the number of knowledge
workers is favorable to the development of the country's
innovative industries, Taiwan businesses need to work harder in
developing their own brand names.
</P>
<P>
According to the results of a survey jointly released by the
Bureau of Foreign Trade, Taiwan External Trade Development
Council, the Business Next biweekly magazine and Interbrand
Corp., although the total value of the top 10 Taiwan- owned
international brand names rose from US$3.546 billion in 2003 to
US$5.145 billion in 2006, the figure accounted for only 1.4
percent of the country's gross domestic product.
