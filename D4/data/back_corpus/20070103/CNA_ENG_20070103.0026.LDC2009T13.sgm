<P>
Taiwan investors regained their confidence in the domestic stock
market in December with a "mood index" hitting a 30-month high,
according to the results of a recent public opinion poll released
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The poll, conducted by Business Today weekly and Shih Hsin
University's Department of Finance in Taipei, found that the
Taiwan stock investors' mood index stood at 0.28 points in
December, marking the first positive figure since June 2004. A
similar index stood at -12.3 points in November.
</P>
<P>
The pollsters attributed the investors' confidence recovery to
the facts that most of the bourses around the world have regained
momentum, there has been an inflow of increased foreign funds
into Taiwan's stock market and the mayoral and city councilor
elections are over.
</P>
<P>
The poll conducted between Dec. 11-26 found that the influx of
foreign funds played a major role in revving up the local bourse
-- a factor far surpassing the impact of other factors
influencing changes in the stock market, including domestic
politics, cross-Taiwan Strait relations and the "state affairs
fund" scandal.
</P>
<P>
The pollsters found that foreign funds constituted 30 percent of
all funds that had been channeled into the Taiwan bourse as of
December 2006, marking a new high in this regard.
</P>
<P>
The poll of investors who had made transactions in the Taiwan
stock market over the past year received 1,068 valid response
samples, with a margin of error of 3 percentage points.
