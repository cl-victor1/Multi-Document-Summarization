Kaohsiung,  Jan.  4 (CNA) 01/04/07  21:13:53 (By Deborah Kuo)

<P>
Newly elected Kaohsiung Mayor Chen Chu promised Ron Froehlich,
president of the International World Games Association (IWGA) ,
Thursday that the 2009 World Games will be held perfectly in
Kaohsiung as scheduled.
</P>
<P>
Froehlich and three senior IWGA officials visited the southern
port city of Kaohsiung again that day, indicating the great
importance that the IWGA is attaching to Kaohsiung regarding the
games to be held two years from now.
</P>
<P>
Froehlich and his group visited Kaohsiung last July and again in
October.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting with the IWGA president, Chen vowed that she
will work through her entire four-year term as Kaohsiung mayor to
ensure that the Kaohsiung Organizing Committee (KOC) will make
the games a success.
</P>
<P>
She said the central government will throw its full support
behind Kaohsiung and that she will spare no efforts to enable the
KOC to organize all the competition events to international
standards.
</P>
<P>
Chen said she met recently with KOC Executive Director Chen Yi-
heng, who told her construction of some stadium projects have not
yet begun, but she claimed that neither budgets nor construction
techniques will be problems.
</P>
<P>
Froehlich and the KOC officials were again briefed by the KOC
authorities on three major facilities for the games -- a
55,000-seat main stadium, a 15,000-seat multi-function stadium
for gymnastic and athletic dancing events, and a venue for water
sports, which will include a dragon boat race.
</P>
<P>
The games are scheduled to take place July 16-26, 2009.
</P>
<P>
For his part, Froehlich said he was satisfied with the work the
KOC has done so far, including warm-up events and the building of
the stadiums.
</P>
<P>
He said the KOC, as well as the Kaohsiung city government, have
the full support of both himself and the IWGA because it is the
first time Taiwan will have hosted such a major large-scale
international event.
