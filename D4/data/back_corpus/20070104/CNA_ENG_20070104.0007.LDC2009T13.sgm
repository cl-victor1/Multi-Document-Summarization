Only 18.3 percent of businesses in Taiwan will raise their
employee salaries in 2007, with 33 percent having no plans to
boost salaries, according to the results of a survey released
Wednesday by an online employment service provider.

The figures compared with 33.3 percent of China-based Taiwan
businesses that have indicated their intention to increase
employee salaries, with the hikes averaging 8.4 percent, the
survey shows.

Of the businesses that will boost employee salaries this year,
4.1 percent are located in northern Taiwan, 4.2 percent in
central Taiwan and 4.9 percent in southern Taiwan.

Although most businesses in Taiwan have no plans to raise
employee salaries, 75.5 percent of the businesses said they will
not cut employee benefits, and another 11.8 percent said they
will offer better benefits.

While it remains a mainstream practice in Taiwan for businesses
to offer uniform benefits for all their employees, the survey
found that 15.4 percent of businesses have started to provide
various options for workers to better serve their needs.

Of these businesses, 19.9 percent are micro-sized businesses,
12.4  percent  are small-sized  businesses,  12.8 percent  are
medium-sized businesses, and 13.5 percent are large-sized
businesses, according to the survey.

Also, 42 percent of businesses are planning to adjust the pay of
their employees based on their performance in the future, instead
of offering equal pay hikes for all workers.

The survey, conducted by 104 Job Bank on 1,304 businesses and
1,178 workers from Dec. 20-26, has a margin of error of plus or
minus 2.86 percentage points.
