Taipei,  Jan. 4 (CNA) 01/04/07  19:01:30 (By Maubo Chang)

The Group 4 Securicor security company was fined NT$1 million
Thursday for mismanagement one day after it lost NT$56 million
(US$1.72 million) in a heist that was engineered by a driver of
one of the company's armored vehicles.
</P>
<P>
The Criminal Investigation Bureau --  which supervises the
country's security firms -- imposed the fine on the Hsintien,
Taipei County-based company and removed it from the bureau's list
of excellent security companies on grounds that serious human
errors were made by the company's management in Wednesday's
heist.
</P>
<P>
In line with a statement made earlier in the day by National
Police Chief Hou You-ih that the company may have its license
revoked if it is found to have been reckless in carrying out its
operations, the bureau said more serious punishment might be
meted out pending an investigation by the Taipei county police
department.
</P>
<P>
In order to prevent similar accidents in future, the bureau said
it will start a sweeping check-up on the nation's 500-odd
security companies in the leadup to the Lunar New Year shopping
season.
</P>
<P>
The heist took place Wednesday morning when a driver of a Group 4
Securicor's cash-transporting vehicle drugged his co-driver and
made away with NT$56 million.
</P>
<P>
The driver, identified as Lee Han-yang, flew to Hong Kong from
Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport Wednesday at noon, and the
heist came to light only after Lee alerted his company by phone
from Hong Kong that his unconscious co-worker was still locked in
the deserted van.
</P>
<P>
In a related development Thursday, a getaway car used by Lee's
accomplice to pick him up after he stole the cash was found in a
private parking lot near the Taoyuan airport.
</P>
<P>
Police found Lee's flak jacket and helmet in the vehicle, which
led investigators to believe the case was carried out by a
criminal group rather than by Lee Han-yang acting independently.
