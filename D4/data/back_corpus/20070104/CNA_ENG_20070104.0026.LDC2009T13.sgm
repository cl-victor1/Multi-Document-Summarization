LAWMAKER SERVING AS KMT SECRETARY-GENERAL A PLUS: SPEAKER
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taipei,  Jan. 4 (CNA) 01/04/07  18:53:08 (By Lilian Wu)

<P>
Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng said Thursday that if
Legislator Wu Den- yih of the Kuomintang (KMT) can serve as the
party's secretary-general, it would help KMT Chairman Ma Ying-
jeou keep abreast of developments within the legislature.
</P>
<P>
Wang made the remarks amid reports that a major reshuffling
within the KMT is imminent, that Wu has been tipped as the
party's secretary-general and that he will immediately face two
major challenges of holding primaries for the legislative
elections at the end of this year, and for the March 2008
presidential election.
</P>
<P>
Asked whether Wu's appointment will be a big boost to the party,
Wang said that "Ma must have carefully thought about the
question."
</P>
<P>
Wang said there had been precedents for KMT legislators serving
concurrently as the party's secretary-general, which he said
would be an advantage to the KMT by helping facilitate the party
chairman's use of operations in the legislature, especially since
the KMT is currently the largest party in the legislature.
</P>
<P>
He also said that Wu and Chan Chuen-po, the current KMT
secretary-general, have "their respective merits," but that Wu
should be more clear about operations in the legislature as he
has served as a legislator for the past five years.
</P>
<P>
On reports that Wu's appointment will mean he is practically out
of the race involving a long-rumored "Ma-Wu" KMT presidential
ticket in the 2008 election, Wang said he was unaware of the
situation.
</P>
<P>
Asked if Wu would be playing the role of both player and umpire
if he takes part in the KMT primary to choose party candidates
for the 2008 presidential race, Wang also declined to give
comment.
</P>
<P>
On the ruling Democratic Progressive Party's plan to hold
primaries for the presidential and legislative elections in May,
Wang said the KMT "has to make necessary preparations, but does
not have to follow suit to complete the nomination so early in
May."
