KEY KMT MEMBER OPTIMISTIC ABOUT PLANNED ALLIANCE WITH PFP
</HEADLINE>

Taipei, Jan. 4 (CNA) 01/04/07  21:23:52 (By Flor Wang)
</P>
<P>
The main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) and the People First Party
(PFP) should seek to forge unity through sincere cooperation, and
a much-expected merger of the two parties will take place when
conditions are ripe, a KMT lawmaker predicted Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Legislator Wu Duen-yih, who once served as mayor of Kaohsiung and
Nantou county magistrate, made the comments at the Legislative
Yuan while answering reporters after it was reported that Wu
would replace Chan Chuen-po as the new KMT secretary-general.
</P>
<P>
Saying that he will do his best to coordinate with the PFP to
pave the way for December's legislative election if he takes the
post, Wu said that he hopes to push for the two parties to
jointly field the most qualified candidates through a quota
control mechanism to help secure a greater chance of victory for
the "pan-blue alliance" in the race.
</P>
<P>
The KMT-PFP cooperation is aimed at obtaining victory in upcoming
elections and neither can afford to lose possible chances of
victory in the face of aggressive challenges from the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) , which is very good at
electioneering, he said.
</P>
<P>
Wu also pledged that the KMT, as a responsible and capable
opposition party, will demand that its lawmakers act rationally
at the Legislative Yuan to serve the people's best interests, and
he outlined major reform goals for the party -- making the KMT
into a "lean, mean but wise" political party, handling the issue
of the party's assets, recruiting fresh blood and meeting the
needs of the people.
</P>
<P>
He also stressed the importance of mending differences within the
KMT to build consensus regarding critical issues.
</P>
<P>
The KMT's powerful Central Standing  Committee  unanimously
approved a draft a day earlier on forming a formal political
alliance with the PFP, despite the fact that the two parties
already form a loose "pan-blue alliance" along with the New Party
against the "pan-green camp" of the DPP and the Taiwan Solidarity
Union.
</P>
<P>
KMT Chairman Ma Ying-jeou said following Wednesday's weekly CSC
meeting that the draft will take effect immediately after the
chairmen or representatives of the two parties sign the document.
</P>
<P>
Ma promised to step up cooperation with the PFP in all future
elections and on all major issues of national concern.
</P>
<P>
Ma and PFP Chairman James Soong agreed in early December to build
a formal alliance amid high expectations of "pan-blue"
supporters.
</P>
<P>
PFP spokesman and lawmaker Lee Hung-chun urged the two parties
Wednesday to accelerate their pace in ironing out mechanisms for
nominating joint candidates in the year-end legislative
elections.
</P>
<P>
According to PFP Policy Center Director Chang Hsien-yao, the
proposed  KMT-PFP alliance  would prioritize  issues regarding
December's elections, the 2008 presidential election and
significant cross-Taiwan Strait issues.
</P>
<P>
Although some people might be unhappy to see the formation of a
new KMT-PFP alliance, Chang said that he thinks it is an
irreversible trend and one of the "pan-blue" supporters' biggest
desires.
