</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  Jan. 4 (CNA) 01/04/07  14:54:41 (By Lilian Wu)
</P>
<P>
Kuomintang (KMT) Legislator Wu Den-yih said Thursday that he'll
do the best job possible as secretary-general of the main
opposition party if KMT Chairman Ma Ying-jeou insists on having
him serve in the post.
</P>
<P>
Wu was responding to reports that Ma, whose term as Taipei mayor
ended Dec. 25, is carrying out a major reshuffle within the
party, with Wu, a former Kaohsiung mayor, replacing the current
party secretary-general, Chan Chuen-po, who reportedly will "take
another major post."
</P>
<P>
"Ma did inquire about my intentions regarding serving as his
chief of staff on more than one occasion," Wu said.
</P>
<P>
Wu added that whether he will take the post will hinge on three
factors: his own intentions, Ma's considerations and approval of
the KMT Central Standing Committee.
</P>
<P>
He also said that if he does take the post, he'll not resign from
his post as a legislator.
</P>
<P>
Wu further said that the Taiwan people have been experiencing
tough times in recent years and that the KMT has not been doing
enough to deal with the problem, adding that if he takes the job,
he'll work with Ma as well as other party members to monitor the
government.
</P>
<P>
According to KMT's charter, the party's Central Committee has the
power to appoint the secretary-general,  although it generally
respects the decision of the chairman.
</P>
<P>
The KMT Central Standing Committee, which represents the Central
Committee, should finalize the matter in its next meeting Jan.
10.
</P>
<P>
"The period before Jan. 10 will be a time for Chairman Ma and I
to think about the matter seriously," Wu said.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that if Ma decides to have him serve as the
secretary-general, "I'll be delighted to accept it."
</P>
<P>
"As a party member and Ma's friend for many years, if he gives
the order, I'll do my best," he added.
</P>
<P>
On media reports there will be no possibility of a KMT ticket of
Ma and Wu in the next presidential election if Wu takes the post
of secretary-general, Wu said that no one can say whether there
will be such a ticket and that it is not possible for him to
comment on the matter at this point in time.
