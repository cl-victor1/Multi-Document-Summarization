MIDDLEMAN

Taipei,  Jan. 3 (CNA) 01/04/07  17:50:42 (By Lilian Wu)
</P>
<P>
President Chen Shui-bian rejected Thursday an offer by opposition
Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Ma Ying-jeou to act as a go-between for
the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) and the Communist
Party of China (CPC), terming it as "unnecessary."
</P>
<P>
The president also said that rather than acting as a middlemen
between the DPP and the CPC, Ma should serve as a bridge between
his party and the DPP, which have been engaged in constant
bickering in Taiwan's polarized political environment.
</P>
<P>
Chen made the remarks while receiving a pro-Taiwan parliamentary
group from Britain.
</P>
<P>
The president noted that Ma has recently gone out of his way to
express a willingness to mend fences with the DPP as he has said
that the differences between the KMT and the DPP are not as great
as those between the KMT and the CPC and that KMT-DPP
reconciliation and cooperation will take precedence over KMT-CPC
cooperation. Ma also offered to act as a middleman between the
DPP and the CPC.
</P>
<P>
The president said he welcomes Ma's change on cross-strait
policy, noting that KMT Honorary Chairman Lien Chan, while
visiting Beijing two years ago, had proposed "joining forces with
the CPC to suppress the pro-Taiwan independence force." A leading
KMT spokesman also said two years ago that there  would never be
KMT-DPP reconciliation and that only the KMT and the CPC would
have reconciliation, according to the president.
</P>
<P>
If Ma is willing to promote cross-strait reconciliation, this
will meet the expectations of the 23 million people on Taiwan,
Chen said.
</P>
<P>
The president also said that rather than promoting a KMT-CPC
forum, it is better to promote a KMT-DPP forum. A KMT-CPC forum
was arranged after then KMT Chairman Lien met with his
counterpart Hu Jintao, CPC general secretary and president of
China, in April 2005 to serve as a platform of exchanges between
the two parties.
</P>
<P>
President Chen further said that "it is not necessary for Ma to
act as a go- between between the DPP and the CPC, mainly because
there is currently no consensus within the country on cross-
strait issues."
</P>
<P>
"If there are big differences within Taiwan on cross-strait
issues,  it  is impossible  to  embark  on  cross-strait
government-to-government dialogue and coordination," he added.
</P>
<P>
He said that cross-strait  dialogue must be conducted via
government-to- government contact or coordination and that a
political party as a private organization cannot take the place
of the government and exercise its authority in this respect.
</P>
<P>
He also said that cross-strait reconciliation and dialogue have
to be based on four principles -- namely "sovereignty, democracy,
peace and reciprocity."
</P>
<P>
By sovereignty, the president said he means that China must
respect, accept and attach importance to the fact of the
existence of Taiwan, and the reality and the status quo of the
Republic of China on Taiwan as a sovereign state.
</P>
<P>
As to the principle of democracy, he said that Taiwan's future
course and possible changes in cross-strait relations must
respect the free will of the 23 million people on Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
He further said that any disputes in the Taiwan Strait as well as
cross-strait differences should be solved through dialogue and by
peaceful means, and not by the use of force.
</P>
<P>
As to the principle of reciprocity, Chen expressed the hope of
promoting direct cross-strait contact, dialogue and coordination
based on the consensus reached between the two sides in a 1992
Hong Kong meeting, which was widely considered to have paved the
way for the first high-ranking cross-strait talk in nearly five
decades in the following year, also known as the Koo-Wang
meeting.
