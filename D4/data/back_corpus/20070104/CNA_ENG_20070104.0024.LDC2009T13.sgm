<P>
The Republic of China Embassy in Nicaragua has been preparing
over the past month for a possible Nicaragua visit by President
Chen Shui-bian to attend President-elect Daniel Ortega's
inauguration ceremony, ROC Ambassador Hung Ming- ta said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Hung told a CNA reporter in a telephone interview that the
Ministry of Foreign Affairs has not informed his embassy about
whether President Chen will personally take part in the new
Nicaraguan president's inauguration slated for Jan. 10.
</P>
<P>
Touching on the development of future relations between the two
countries, Hung said Taiwan is more than willing to expand
various cooperation projects with the incoming Ortega
administration under the principle of reciprocity.
</P>
<P>
Expressing  his confidence that Nicaragua will continue to
maintain diplomatic ties with Taiwan, Hung said his embassy will
also seek to create a closer relationship with the Central
American country.
</P>
<P>
As for the ROC diplomatic mission's future work, Hung noted that
his embassy will step up sharing with the new Nicaraguan
government Taiwan's development experience in the fields of
agriculture, public health and education, rather than increasing
financial aid to that country.
</P>
<P>
Hung  also  disclosed  that  he  has  met  with  several
ministers-designate of the incoming Ortega administration to
exchange views on various bilateral cooperation projects to be
carried out in the future.
</P>
<P>
He further said the Nicaraguan government and people are quite
satisfied with existing agricultural and medical cooperation
projects between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
According to the ambassador, Taiwan manufacturers have invested
around US$270 million in Nicaragua and created more than 30,000
jobs for the Nicaraguan people since the two countries restored
formal diplomatic relations in 1990.
