</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  Jan. 4 (CNA) 01/04/07  23:31:57 (By Sofia Wu)
</P>
<P>
The period for half-price ticket sales for the country's first
high-speed railway will be extended for five days until Jan. 19,
a spokesman for Taiwan High Speed Rail Corp. (THSRC), the
system's operator, announced Thursday.
</P>
<P>
THSRC Chief Executive Officer Ou Chin-der made the announcement
on the eve of the inauguration of the new railway system -- the
world's first outside Japan based on "bullet train" technology --
for limited service.
</P>
<P>
The company originally intended to offer half-price rides,
described as "commercial test runs" by THSRC, for just 10 days
from Jan. 5 through Jan. 14.
</P>
<P>
However, as the half-price ticket sales have been marred by many
embarrassing technical glitches since sales began Tuesday, the
company decided to extend the "commercial test runs" for five
more days.
</P>
<P>
Ou said discounted tickets for the period from Jan. 5 through
Jan. 19 will go on sale at the system's various stations Friday.
</P>
<P>
Advance sales for full-price tickets for trips after Jan. 20 will
start a week before travel day, Ou said, adding that tickets for
trips Jan. 20 will go on sale Jan. 13.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of passengers are expected to join the bullet train's
first commercial runs from 7: 00 a.m. Friday, shrugging off
safety concerns about the high-tech train which will carve
through the countryside at up to 300 kilometers per hour.
</P>
<P>
The NT$480 billion rail system will cut travel time between
Taipei and the southern port city of Kaohsiung by more than half,
from four hours to 90 minutes.
</P>
<P>
The 345-kilometer rail system, first conceived of more than 20
years ago, represents strenuous efforts to provide state of the
art transportation solutions to Taiwan's 23 million people, while
saving energy and preserving the environment.
</P>
<P>
A seven-kilometer section linking Panchiao, Taipei county with
Taipei City is expected to be approved for commercial runs next
month.
</P>
<P>
Despite safety worries and criticism over delays from the
original  start date, the initial  public response  has been
enthusiastic. More than 80,000 tickets have been sold for
discounted trips over the first 10 days.
</P>
<P>
THSRC Chairwoman Nita Ing has apologized for the embarrasing
ticketing glitches in the past few days. "We are not satisfied
with the way things are going, " she said, adding that the
situation will improve day by day.
