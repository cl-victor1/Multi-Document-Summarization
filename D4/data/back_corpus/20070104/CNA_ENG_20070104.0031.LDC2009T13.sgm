NCHU DEVELOPS NEW BIOCONTROL METHOD AGAINST RED MITES
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  Jan.  4 (CNA) 01/04/07  19:42:12 (By Zep Hu)
</P>
<P>
A research team at National Chung-hsing University (NCHU) in
Taichung has devised a new biological control method against the
red mite, a common pest that causes serious damage to local fruit
and flower crops, university sources said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The new technique employs amblyseius womersleyi, a species of
predatory mite, to inhibit the spread of the red mite, both
reducing the use of insecticides and increasing net profits,
according to NCHU.
</P>
<P>
Shien Jien-ying, a professor at the university's Department of
Entomology, explained that although amblyseius have long been
known as a natural enemy of the red mite, scientists have long
had problems cultivating them in sufficient numbers and keeping
them alive in containers long enough for transportation to
distribution points.
</P>
<P>
Shien said they now have the know-how to keep amblyseius
womersleyi alive for at least five days and that the next step of
the research is to prolong the period to 14 days.
</P>
<P>
According to previous field experiments, 10 percent of a hectare
of fruit farm needs some 10,000 amblyseius per release, while 20
releases are required to cover the whole growing season.
</P>
<P>
Shien added that using the new biocontrol technique, a hectare of
strawberries could yield a net profit up to NT$12 million more
than usual.
