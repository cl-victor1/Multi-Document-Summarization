Police uncovered 22.8 kilos of compressed bricks of marijuana as
well as several seeds and one kilo of ketamine in a search of the
office of a freight company in Kinmen County Thursday,  detaining
a 34-year-old  suspect identified as Chen Kuan-hau.

The police are still trying to track down the head of the drug
ring, surnamed Chuang, who they said had smuggled marijuana
bricks and ketamine from China into Kinmen several times, with
the drugs later being transported to Kaohsiung. It has been
reported that Chuang is now in China.

<P>
Chen, who has a criminal record for burglary and amphetamine use,
is suspected of being responsible for transporting the smuggled
drugs from Kinmen to Kaohsiung.

The police said they believe that the drug ring smuggled their
goods via the ferry service between Taiwan's outlying islands of
Kinmen and Matsu and the Chinese ports of Xiamen and Fuzhou,
adding that they are currently investigating how the smugglers
passed through the security checks in those cities.
