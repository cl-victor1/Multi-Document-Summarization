<P>
Fast food franchises around Taiwan were urged by the Consumer's
Foundation Thursday to stop using unhealthy trans fatty acids.
</P>
<P>
The foundation urged major fast food franchises, including
McDonald's and Starbucks, to take the lead in stopping the use of
trans fatty acids, commonly termed "trans fats, " in preparation
of their food.
</P>
<P>
Trans fats are created during an industrial process to transform
natural liquid plant oils into solids. The process is called
partial hydrogenation.
</P>
<P>
Both foreign and domestic research documents show that trans fats
are neither required nor beneficial for health and indicate that
consuming trans fat increases the risk of cardiovascular disease
due to its effect on cholesterol levels.
</P>
<P>
For these reasons, the governments of Denmark and the United
States have restricted or banned all restaurants and food stands
from using trans fats in preparing fried foods.
</P>
<P>
Foundation officials said McDonald's, Starbucks and Kentucky
Fried Chicken outlets in the United States have announced that
they have stopped using trans fats since November 2006.
</P>
<P>
The foundation suggested that the government  should exert
controls on trans fats by requiring  foodstuff  producers and
processors to state the quantity of trans fatty acids on food
packaging.
</P>
<P>
It also urged consumers to avoid trans fats and to pay extra
attention to food labeling.
