Washington,  Jan.  31 (CNA) 02/01/07  14:08:48 (By Chiehyu Lin
and Y.F. Low)

<P>
Former Premier Frank Hsieh expressed confidence Wednesday in his
possible bid to run for the presidency in 2008.
</P>
<P>
Hsieh, who is in Washington D.C. to attend the National Prayer
Breakfast on behalf of President Chen Shui-bian,  told Taiwan
reporters that he is an outright optimist who has confidence in a
lot of things, including his possible presidential bid.
</P>
<P>
However, Hsieh said he has no plan to discuss with the U.S. side
his presidential visions during his current visit, because he has
not officially become  the ruling Democratic  Progressive
Party's presidential candidate.
</P>
<P>
Hsieh said he will meet with U.S. officials during the trip to
discuss issues such as Taiwan's plan to reform its Constitution
and the delayed arms procurement package from the United States.
</P>
<P>
Hsieh said it may be hard for foreigners to understand why Taiwan
cannot place national security before partisan differences, but a
lot of things are not under the government's control now that
Taiwan is a democratic country.
</P>
<P>
Hsieh said the Cabinet has tried very hard but failed to have the
legislature pass the budget for the arms procurement during the
last legislative session and that he will try to explain the
matter properly to the U.S. side.
</P>
<P>
During an interview with SET TV in Taipei Monday, Hsieh said he
is seriously considering whether to run for the presidency in
2008 and when to announce his bid if he decides to do so.
</P>
<P>
Hsieh said he first needs to complete a tour of Taiwan's 23
counties and cities to assess his own ability to shoulder such a
great responsibility and to evaluate his support among the people
before making a decision.
