Moderate exercise such as yoga, tai chi, and constitutionals, is
good for the health of cancer patients, improving their immunity
against minor diseases and reducing the side effects caused by
chemotherapy, medical sources said Thursday.

<P>
Many patients and their families wrongly believed that the
patient should stay still in bed after undergoing an operation or
chemotherapy, said Hsieh Ruey- kuen, an oncologist at Mackey
Memorial Hospital. However, supportive exercise is recommended as
it can aid in the recovery process.

Citing recent research results from the U.S. National Cancer
Institute, Hsieh said researchers have proven that yogic exercise
can improve patients' immunity. The institute also recommended
that patients practice yoga for 20 to 60 minutes per session, at
least three times per week to boost their strength.

Hsieh noted that exercise like yoga, tai chi, and constitutionals
is similar in essence, helping people to moderate their body's
condition and improve health. Therefore, daily, supportive
exercise could help cancer patients recover more quickly.
