<P>
About 80 percent of the dried lily buds sold in Taoyuan County
contain excessive amounts of sulfur dioxide residue, county
health officials said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The officials at the Taoyuan county government's Public Health
Bureau said they had tested 15 samples of dried lily buds
collected from stores in the county and found 12 of them to
contain sulfur dioxide residue exceeding legal limits.
</P>
<P>
Dried lily buds -- the unopened buds of the lily flower -- are
also called "golden needles" because of their color. They are a
common ingredient in various Chinese dishes.
</P>
<P>
Some suppliers of the product use sulfur dioxide for bleaching
and as a preservative.
</P>
<P>
The health officials indicated that the manufacturers of the
problem goods were each fined between NT$30,000 and NT$150,000,
while the stores selling such products were told to remove the
goods from their shelves.
