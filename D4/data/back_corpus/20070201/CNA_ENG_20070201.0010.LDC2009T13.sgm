TAIPEI CITY TO HAVE 8 CONSTITUENCIES FOR LEGISLATIVE ELECTIONS
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taipei,  Feb.1  (CNA) 02/01/07  12:07:32 (By Sofia Wu)
</P>
<P>
Taipei City will be divided into eight constituencies for the
year-end legislative elections, according to the newly
promulgated districting scheme.
</P>
<P>
After many twists and turns, the Central Election Commission
(CEC) managed to secure 11th-hour compromises to complete
electoral redistricting shortly before the legal deadline
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Redistricting is necessary for the new Legislative Yuan elections
because a new "single-member constituency, two vote" electoral
system will be adopted and the number of legislative seats will
be cut to 113 from 225 in line with a package of constitutional
amendments passed in 2005.
</P>
<P>
According to the new districting blueprint, Taipei City's first
constituency will cover the Peitou administrative district and 13
boroughs in the Shihlin district.
</P>
<P>
The second constituency will be comprised of Tatung district and
38 boroughs in the Shihlin district; the third constituency will
include the Chungshan district and 20 boroughs in the Sungshan
district.
</P>
<P>
The fourth constituency will encompass both the Neihu and Nankang
administrative districts, while the fifth constituency will cover
Wanhua district and 21 boroughs in the Chungcheng district.
</P>
<P>
The sixth constituency  will cover the Taan administrative
district, and the seventh constituency will contain the Hsinyi
district and 13 boroughs in the Sungshan district, while the
eighth constituency will incorporate the Wenshan district and 10
boroughs in the Chungcheng district.
</P>
<P>
Taipei was among the 10 cities and counties where electoral
redistricting was not finalized until Wednesday. Six of them
upheld the CEC-drafted redistricting plans, including Taipei
City, while disputes over the remaining four were finally settled
by way of lot drawing.
</P>
<P>
The  opposition-controlled  Legislative  Yuan  approved  the CEC-
drafted redistricting designs for 15 cities and counties around
the country before its winter session concluded Jan. 19.
</P>
<P>
As the next legislative elections could result in major changes
in the domestic political landscape, major political parties are
reluctant  to surrender  even the smallest  advantage,  making
compromises difficult to reach.
</P>
<P>
After grueling negotiations between Premier Su Tseng-chang and
Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng in accordance with legal
provisions, decisions were finally reached Wednesday evening that
the CEC-drafted redistricting  blueprints for six other cities
and counties -- Taipei City, Taichung County, Taichung City,
Tainan County, Changhua County and Miaoli County -- will also be
upheld.
</P>
<P>
With Su and Wang's assent,  redistricting designs for the
remaining four -- Taipei County, Taoyuan County, Kaohsiung City
and Pingtung County -- were determined by way of drawing lots
based on versions presented by legislative caucuses of individual
political parties or versions previously worked out by the
legislature through consensus.
</P>
<P>
Among them, Kaohsiung City will take up the redistricting plan
fleshed out through previous consensus; Taipei County will apply
the blueprint initiated by the opposition Taiwan Solidarity Union
(TSU) ; Taoyuan County will embrace the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party's proposal; and Pingtung County will adopt the
version agreed upon by the main opposition Kuomintang (KMT), the
People First Party (PFP) , the Non-Partisan Solidarity Union
(NPSU) and the TSU.
</P>
<P>
The southern port city of Kaohsiung, which is the country's
second largest city after Taipei, will be divided into five
electoral constituencies, according to the new districting
scheme.
</P>
<P>
Taipei County, the county's most populous administrative region,
will be divided into 12 constituencies according to the TSU-
drafted blueprint.
</P>
<P>
The northern county of Taoyuan will be subdivided into six
constituencies according to the DPP-initiated plan,  while the
southernmost  county of Pingtung will be divided  into three
constituencies based on the proposal agreed upon by the KMT, the
PFP, the NPSU and the TSU.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the central counties of Taichung and Changhua will be
divided into five and four constituencies, respectively; and
Tainan County and Taichung City will have three constituencies
each.
</P>
<P>
Tainan City and the southern counties of Kaohsiung, Yunlin,
Chiayi, Nantou and Miaoli will each have two constituencies,
while the remaining seven counties -- Yilan, Hsinchu, Hualien,
Taitung, Penghu, Kinmen and Matsu -- and three cities, namely
Hsinchu, Keelung and Chiayi, will each have one constituency.
