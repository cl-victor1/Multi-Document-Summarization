Taipei,  Feb. 1 (CNA) 02/01/07  17:52:28 (By Lilian Wu)

The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) said Thursday that
Taiwan's donation of US$5 million to Panama was part of the
bilateral humanitarian cooperation program and not an example of
checkbook diplomacy as claimed by some media.
</P>
<P>
Yeh Fei-bi, vice director general of MOFA's Department of
Information and Cultural Affairs, said the donation to the
Panamanian first lady's office was held in an open ceremony Jan.
17.

<P>
She was responding to reports by a local newspaper, the China
Times, which quoted La Prensa, Panama's major newspaper, as
saying that Taiwan Ambassador Hou Ping-fu donated the sum to the
office of first lady Vivian Ferenandez de Torrijos via Panamanian
First Vice President and Foreign Affairs Minister Samuel Lewis
Navarro Jan. 17, one week after President Chen Shui-bian and
Panamanian President Martin Torrijos Espino met at the
inauguration ceremony of Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega Jan.
10.

<P>
Following La Prensa's report, the Panamanian Ministry of Foreign
Affairs stated Wednesday that the donation ceremony was held
openly, but was unknown to others until reported in the press.
</P>
<P>
Yeh stressed that the donation is part of a humanitarian
cooperation program between the two nations.
</P>
<P>
The donation was intended for a charity project presided over by
the first lady's office, chiefly to help establish barrier-free
facilities for the disabled and provide them with vocational
training and counselling.
</P>
<P>
Yeh noted that the first lady's office has stated that the
donation will not be managed by the office, but by a bureau for
the nation's physically challenged under the Presidential Office.
</P>
<P>
She noted that Lewis, while accepting the donation in a ceremony
Jan. 17, said that the money would be channeled into the nation's
coffers in an efficient and transparent way. The management will
be subject to the supervision of the auditing agency, and Taiwan
has no need to worry that the funds would end up lining the
pockets of certain individuals, according to Lewis.
