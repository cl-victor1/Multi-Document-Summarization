FORMER PRESIDENT LEE CLARIFIES STANCE ON TAIWAN'S FUTURE
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taipei,  Feb. 1 (CNA) 02/01/07  11:55:52 (By Sofia Wu)
</P>
<P>
Former President Lee Teng-hui has clarified his stance on
Taiwan's development goal, saying Taiwan's urgent task lies in
"normalization of its national identity " rather than
independence.
</P>
<P>
Speaking in an interview with cable TV channel TVBS Wednesday,
Lee claimed that he has never advocated de jure Taiwan
independence because Taiwan is already an independent sovereign
country.
</P>
<P>
"It's wrong to pursue independence now that Taiwan is already an
independent country. But it is still not a normal country. Its
constitution does not originate in Taiwan and is irrelevant to
Taiwan's needs and situation," Lee explained.
</P>
<P>
He further said that what Taiwan needs most lies in making it a
normal and complete country, with rectifying its name and writing
a new constitution relevant to its unique circumstances and
cultural and social context as its daunting challenges.
</P>
<P>
Lamenting that the country has become increasingly divided over
the "independence versus unification" debate, Lee said it's
unwise to waste time and energy on such a "false" issue.
</P>
<P>
"It will do no good and is in fact very detrimental to Taiwan, "
Lee warned.
</P>
<P>
He further explained that since Taiwan is already democratized,
with the people electing their own government and top leader,
time need not be wasted on debating the issue of independence or
unification.
</P>
<P>
Claiming that bickering over the issue in the past few years has
impeded improvement of the people's livelihood, Lee said major
domestic political parties should shift their focus from such
senseless squabbles to more meaningful issues, such as economic
development.
</P>
<P>
Lee also rebutted criticism that the discord over the country's
future was fueled by his controversial definition of relations
between Taiwan and China as a "special state-to-state"
relationship near the end of his 12-year presidency.
</P>
<P>
The former president clarified that he has never characterized
cross-Taiwan Strait relations as "one country on each side" of
the strait nor has he advocated a so-called "two states" theory.
</P>
<P>
"What I have said is that cross-strait ties are a special state-
to-state relationship. The word 'special' implies profound
meaning," Lee said.
</P>
<P>
He argued that Taiwan differs from China in many ways. "For one
thing, the two sides have different lifestyles. We in Taiwan can
develop our own culture. We don't want ethnic rifts which would
hinder social progress," he added.
</P>
<P>
In the interview, Lee also clarified his description of Taiwan's
previous Kuomintang (KMT) government as an alien regime. "That
was because the KMT government was not popularly elected. Under
its authoritarian rule, people didn't enjoy freedom and political
rights. But gone are those days. We now have freedom of speech,
freedom of the press, freedom of assembly and freedom of
expression as well as democracy, and we need not highlight the
sins or injustices of that era anymore," he contended.
</P>
<P>
Lee further clarified a Next Magazine report which said that he
intends to visit China. "The report is problematic and incorrect.
I see no need for me to propose a visit to China," he said.
</P>
<P>
With China growing ever stronger economically and militarily, Lee
said, Taiwan has much to do by using the platform provided by the
World Trade Organization (WTO) which is one of the few
international organizations that admit both Taiwan and China.
</P>
<P>
Noting that Taiwan's service industry has been hit hardest by the
exodus of manufacturing companies and the flow of investment
capital to China over the past decade, Lee said the government
should craft a mechanism for capital to flow back to Taiwan from
China.
</P>
<P>
"As far as the economy is concerned, nothing should be unilateral
or a one-way track. Capital flow always needs a two-way track to
facilitate balance," Lee said.
</P>
<P>
For this issue, Lee said, Taiwan must formulate a sound system
and use the WTO as a conduit for constructive economic exchanges
with China.
</P>
<P>
Asked about his views on Chinese President Hu Jintao, Lee
refrained from making any comments.  He instead said he sees
differences between Hu and Hu's predecessor, Jiang Zemin, in
their strategies toward Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
"When Taiwan held its first-ever direct presidential election in
1996 as a critical step toward democratization, Jiang ordered
test-firing of missiles to intimidate Taiwanese voters and
adopted other saber-rattling strategies against Taiwan. Such
practices were not constructive, " he said, adding that cross-
strait issues should be addressed with a moderate approach and
that Taiwan itself should also think how to better deal with
China with vision and foresight.
