Taipei,  Feb.  1 (CNA) 02/01/07  22:06:59 (By Flor Wang)

<P>
Political figures from the ruling and opposition parties were
mixed Thursday in their reactions to the latest remarks made by
former President Lee Teng-hui, who claimed that he never backed
Taiwan independence.
</P>
<P>
Lee told Next Magazine, in its latest edition, that he hopes to
visit China and forswears Taiwan independence. The former
president and spiritual leader of the opposition Taiwan
Solidarity Union (TSU) also urged the government and the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) to open up to Chinese capital
and tourists, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
Vice President Annette Lu expressed her "astonishment" when asked
for her opinion regarding Lee's denouncement of Taiwan
independence. She then argued that the public must judge a
political figure's words and deeds over a long term.
</P>
<P>
In response to reporters' inquiries, Premier Su Tseng-chang
insisted that Taiwan is already an independent sovereignty,
though he claimed that he was not fully aware of Lee's remarks.
</P>
<P>
Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng, a stalwart in the main
opposition Kuomintang (KMT), however, said that Lee has always
been consistent in his stance regarding Taiwan independence and
that Lee was never active in the movement.
</P>
<P>
KMT Legislator John Chiang, who once served as KMT secretary-
general when Lee was president and the party's chairman, doubted
that the prime purpose of Lee's denouncement of the Taiwanese
independence movement was aimed only at fortifying the TSU's
position in domestic politics.
</P>
<P>
This was by no means the first time that Lee has changed his
stance regarding major national issues, Chiang claimed, adding
that Lee's statement highlights the fact that independence is no
longer supported by the mainstream of Taiwanese society and that
the cause will attract few voters.
</P>
<P>
Lee Hung-chun, spokesman of the opposition People First Party
(PFP) , accused Lee of seeking to score political points with the
interview. The former president's changing attitudes only follow
the various twists in his political line, Lee Hung-chun said.
</P>
<P>
Sheng Fu-hsiung, a former DPP legislator who is widely viewed as
a moderate in Taiwan's polarized politics, praised what he called
the former president's frank comments in the interview.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a news conference, Sheng urged the public not to
interpret Lee's remarks negatively. He claimed that Lee was only
opposed to unworthy politicians scheming to manufacture an
artificial confrontation by rehashing old issues.
</P>
<P>
Sheng  hailed  Lee's pragmatic  attitude  toward  Taiwanese
independence and pointed out that it does not mark a departure
from the ruling DPP's resolution on Taiwan's future.
</P>
<P>
However, Sheng also called on Lee to provide the public with a
clear explanation for his changing attitudes on the independence
issue by discarding his personal concern for the TSU's future or
the 2008 presidential election.
</P>
<P>
Doing so will help the former president better dispel public
misconceptions about him and encourage social elites to join
forces with him, Sheng said.
