Taipei, March 15 (CNA) 03/15/07  20:04:11 (By Lilian Wu)

The Far East Air Transport Corp. announced a major air fare cut
Thursday in a bid to cope with steep competition from the
nation's high-speed rail.
</P>
<P>
Several air carriers operating domestic routes said they would
follow suit or take other measures.
</P>
<P>
Officials of the Far East Air Transport Corp. said passengers
ordering air tickets for Taipei-Kaohsiung on Saturdays and
Sundays via Internet will pay NT$1,510 (US$45.75), a nearly 30
percent discount on the present NT$2,120. The price of a ticket
on the high-speed rail system for the same destination costs
NT$1,490.
</P>
<P>
The air fare for a Taipei-Tainan route will be cut to NT$1,350
from NT$1,960, making it the same price for the high-speed rail
system, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
Starting Thursday, those who order air tickets via the Internet
on weekends will enjoy the special offer, which will last until
May 30, they said.
</P>
<P>
They noted that following the inauguration of the Taipei station,
the last northern stop of the 345-km high-speed rail system --
which reduces the travel time between Taipei and Kaohsiung to 90
minutes from the previous four hours -- earlier this month, air
routes in western Taiwan suffered a serious blow.
</P>
<P>
Faced with the steep competition from the high-speed rail system,
Far East Air Transport, which has the largest number of domestic
air routes, has to adopt different management strategy, they
said.
</P>
<P>
They predicted that after the fare cut, they will be able to
retrieve most of their lost customers.
</P>
<P>
UNI Airways Corp., another air carrier, announced Thursday that
starting March 17, air fare for the Taipei-Kaohsiung route will
be reduced to NT$1,510 on weekends from the present NT$2,200, and
Taipei-Chiayi route to NT$1,425 on off- peak time and NT$1,080 on
weekends.
</P>
<P>
Trans Asia Airways also announced that staring Thursday, air fare
for Taipei- Kaohsiung will be cut to NT$1,490 from NT$2,110, and
tickets on the Taipei- Tainan route will be reduced to NT$1,350
from NT$1,914.
</P>
<P>
Mandarin Airlines said that it will announce its own proposal to
cut air fares in due time.
