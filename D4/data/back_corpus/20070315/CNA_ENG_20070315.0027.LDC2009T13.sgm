Huafan University, a local Buddhist school, is studying the
feasibility of forging sisterhood ties with the Marylhurst
Catholic University in the United States, a spokesman for Huafan
University said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The remarks came after Roy Ghazimorad, director of Marylhurst
University's Pacific International Academy, was invited to
deliver a speech in Taiwan a day earlier.
</P>
<P>
The two schools have a lot in common due to their religious
backgrounds, Huafan University President Yan Wei-mon said, adding
that both schools attach great importance to moral education in
addition to professional skills.
</P>
<P>
Huafan University came up with the cooperation plan after its
chairman, a Buddhist master, visited Marylhurst University last
year, Yan noted.
</P>
<P>
The chairman will visit the school again this July for further
discussions about the cooperation, according to Yan.
