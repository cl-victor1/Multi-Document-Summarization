PUBLISHING NAMES OF DEFAULTERS WON'T HELP DEBT COLLECTION: BANKER
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  March 15 (CNA) 03/15/07  20:18:41 (By Maubo Chang)

The government's decision to force local banks to publish the
names of those defaulting on major loans won't help banks to
recoup their losses, an executive of a local bank said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Financial Supervisory Commission's order, made in hopes of
bringing public pressure to bear on defaulters who have run up
non-performance loans of over NT$100 million (US$3.02 million)
won't do the lenders any good as most of those borrowers are
businessmen who have already fled the country, said the anonymous
executive.
</P>
<P>
Citing Chen You-hao, founder of the Tuntex Group, and Tseng
Cheng-jen, founder of the Kuang San Group, who top the list of
major defaulters disclosed Wednesday by local banks to prove his
point, the executive said they all are tarnished businessmen who
have gone into hiding, either in China or some other countries.
</P>
<P>
Most of these defaulters are already known to the public, the
executive said, adding that he doubts publication will subject
them to any additional pressure.
</P>
<P>
Instead of flogging dead horses,  the executive  said the
government should authorize the banks to publish the names of
major borrowers who have been overdue in the repayment of debts
for more than three months, but have not yet had their debts
listed as non-performing loans, and thus a part of banks' losses.
</P>
<P>
The executive said most of those lenders are still active in
business and thereby may have the ability to repay their loans if
they were pressured to do so.
</P>
<P>
The banks are obliged by law to respect the privacy of their
customers and are forbidden to disclose information concerning
the money borrowed from them.
</P>
<P>
However, the Financial Supervisory Commission ordered the banks
to publish the names of major defaulters after the Rebar Group
applied for bankruptcy protection on Dec. 29 last year, causing a
financial storm in Taiwan.
