MOFA URGES TAIWAN TOURISTS TO OBSERVE VISA CONDITIONS IN JAPAN

Taiwanese visitors to Japan must adhere to the stated purpose of
their entry or risk deportation from Japan, an official at the
Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Liao Chin-pang, deputy chief executive officer at the MOFA's
Committee on Japanese Affairs, issued the call at the ministry's
routine news briefing.
</P>
<P>
Although Japan grants visa-free privileges to Taiwanese tourists,
Liao called on visitors to only engage in tourist activities
while staying in that country -- one of the major overseas
destinations for local tourists.
</P>
<P>
Anyone intending to visit relatives, pursue short-term academic
courses or do volunteer work in Japan or those who had been
denied entry or had overstayed their visas in the past may not be
entitled to visa-free entry to Japan, Liao said, urging them to
enquire about detailed visa information and regulations with
Japan's representative office in Taiwan -- the Interchange
Association -- prior to departure.
</P>
<P>
Last year, more than 600 people from Taiwan were denied visa-free
entry to Japan for these reasons, Liao said.
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, Liao encouraged Taiwanese tourists to visit Japan
more frequently as 2007 has been designated as a year of cultural
exchange between the two countries.
