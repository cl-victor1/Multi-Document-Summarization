Premier Su Tseng-chang said Thursday that the signing of a
memorandum of understanding (MOU) on cooperation between the
Taiwan Financial Services Roundtable (TFSR) and its U.S.
counterpart will help cooperation between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Su made the remarks while attending a signing ceremony involving
TFSR Chairman Chien Hung-wen and Steve Barlett, president and CEO
of Financial Services Roundtable, in Taipei.
</P>
<P>
The premier noted that through the exchanges of information and
assistance with resources, the MOU will help enhance bilateral
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the government hopes to improve order in its
financial market and that efforts to write off bad loans since
April 2002 have borne fruit.
</P>
<P>
Su said the overall overdue loan ratio of banks has since dropped
to 2.28 percent from a high of 8.09 percent, adding that the
publishing of the names of big defaulters earlier in the day was
another sign of the government's determination in this regard.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the government has recently unveiled a "Mega
Investment, Mega Warmth" economic stimulus project covering the
financial market, infrastructure, industrial development, human
resources and social welfare aspects, he said this will require
the assistance of the financial sector.
</P>
<P>
The TFSR was established in 2005 with the aim of promoting
prosperity in the nation's finance industry and facilitating the
consolidation of the overcrowded banking sector.
