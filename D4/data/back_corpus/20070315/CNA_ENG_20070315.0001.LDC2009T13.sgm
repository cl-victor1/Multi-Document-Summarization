Taipei, March 14 (CNA) 03/15/07  00:03:58 (By Sofia Wu)

The Ministry of Justice Investigation Bureau (MJIB) investigated
43 cases of underground cross-border money transfers between 2002
and 2006, with more than NT$136.21 billion in accumulated amount
involved, an official said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Among them, 31 cases involving an aggregate sum of 77.78 billion
were transmitted across the Taiwan Strait, the MJIB official said
while delivering a report on the domestic crime situation at a
weekly Cabinet meeting.
</P>
<P>
According to the official, Taiwan's central bank has been closely
monitoring money flow across the Taiwan Strait. Whenever central
bank officials detected suspicious outbound money transmissions
from specific bank accounts, they would transfer the cases to the
MJIB for further investigations.
</P>
<P>
The MJIB has adopted a "speedy investigation, speedy prosecution
and harsh punishment" principle in dealing all those cases, the
official said, adding that the Financial Supervisory Commission
has also stepped up an education campaign to encourage bank
clients to use legal financial channels for foreign currency
exchanges and money transmissions and thus prevent
irregularities.
</P>
<P>
As to the mounting call for the government to lift the ban on
direct cross- strait money transmission, central bank and
Mainland Affairs council officials present at the meeting said it
would be possible only after the two sides of the Taiwan Strait
hold negotiations and sign a bilateral currency settlement
agreement.
