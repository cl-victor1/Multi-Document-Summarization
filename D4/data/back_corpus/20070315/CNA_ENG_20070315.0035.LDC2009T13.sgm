Nearly 85 percent of the respondents to a recent poll think a
national referendum should be held whenever Taiwan signs
agreements related to its sovereignty with China, according to
the results of the poll released Thursday by the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP).
</P>
<P>
The poll results show that 84.8 percent of the respondents said
such agreements should be decided by national referendum,
compared with 9.7 percent who said that national referendums are
not necessary.
</P>
<P>
In addition, 83.2 percent said only Taiwan people are entitled to
define the status quo across the Taiwan Strait, compared with 1.7
percent who said the Beijing government should define it and 6.4
percent who said both sides should define it.
</P>
<P>
The polls also show that 69.2 percent think Taiwan is an
independent and sovereign country, compared with 14.6 percent who
said Taiwan is part of China.
</P>
<P>
On whether to apply to join the United Nations under the name of
Taiwan, 70.6 percent said that they agree with such an approach,
compared with 19.6 percent who said they do not agree.
</P>
<P>
Lai I-chung, director of the DPP's Department of Chinese Affairs,
said the poll highlights the fact that the "one China" policy
touted by China has no market in Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
The Taiwan people want to decide their own future, Lai said,
adding that this shows that a resolution passed by the DPP on
Taiwan's future in 1999 has become mainstream opinion. The
resolution states that Taiwan is an independent, sovereign
country and that any changes in its status should be decided by
national referendum.
</P>
<P>
The poll was conducted March 7-8. A total of 1,034 effective
samples were collected with a margin of error of 3.1 percentage.
