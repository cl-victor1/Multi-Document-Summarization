Taipei,  March 15 (CNA) 03/15/07  17:40:40 (By Flor Wang)

A group of ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) lawmakers
visited the Central Election Commission (CEC) Thursday, where
they picked up a form to initiate an endorsement campaign aimed
at calling for a public referendum on the country's entry into
the United Nations in the name of "Taiwan."
</P>
<P>
CEC Chairman Chang Cheng-hsiung met the lawmakers, who included
Trong R. Chai, Kuo Wen-cheng and Cheng Chao-ming.

Chai, a staunch supporter of Taiwan independence, told Chang that
they hoped to initiate the endorsement campaign to call for a
public referendum on Taiwan's U.N. cause, to be held along with
the December's  legislative  elections  or next year's
presidential election, in response to a goal outlined by
President Chen Shui-bian that the country should join the U.N. as
"Taiwan."
</P>
<P>
Holding a referendum would allow the public to have the final say
on the issue and it would also help the international community
to gain a better understanding of the Taiwan people's strong
desire to enter the U.N., Chai explained.
</P>
<P>
"Why cannot Taiwan, with it's marked economic and education
achievements, join the world body as other nations in the world?
" he asked, adding that "the Taiwan people must strive to
accomplish the task already approved by the DPP's Central
Standing Committee and we hope to hold the public  referendum
along with the year-end legislative elections or the March 2008
presidential race."
</P>
<P>
In a democracy, it is normal to hold referendums to allow people
to have their say on issues of major national concern or public
interest, Chang said.
</P>
<P>
According to the CEC chief, the public referendum law requires
that at least 85,000 people -- or 0.5 percent of the eligible
voters in last presidential election -- must endorse the campaign
initiated by Chai in the first phase before a CEC panel can give
the go-ahead for a second-phase endorsement to call a proposed
referendum.
