Taipei,  April 27 (CNA) 04/27/07  21:53:41 (By Ruth Wang)

<P>
The government's decision to refuse to allow the Olympic torch
relay of the 2008 Beijing Olympic Games to pass through Taiwan
was made after group discussions and not by any individual,
Premier Su Tseng-chang said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Su said after a Legislative Yuan session that the National
Security Council (NSC), the Mainland Affairs Council, the
National Council on Physical Fitness and Sports and the Chinese
Taipei Olympic Committee met to discuss the issue before deciding
that the proposed route planned by China "dwarfed Taiwan's
status."
</P>
<P>
The NSC then reported the decision to President Chen Shui-bian
before notifying the Chinese Olympic Committee in Beijing and the
International Olympic Committee (IOC), Su said.
</P>
<P>
Su insisted that China's moves of downgrading Taiwan's
sovereignty in the route plan will not be accepted by the
government, including a name change from the commonly used title
"Chinese Taipei" to "Taipei, China" and calling the relay route
from Taipei to Hong Kong a domestic route rather than an
international one.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan rejected the plan to guard its sovereignty and rights as
an independent sports entity in the Olympic games, Su added.
</P>
<P>
He said the government will come up with solutions to deal with
the consequences following Taiwan's refusal of the route plan,
such as the possibility of being denied IOC membership.
