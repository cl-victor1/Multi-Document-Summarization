NATIONAL COUNTER-DENGUE FEVER WORKING MEETING HELD IN KAOSHIUNG
</HEADLINE>

Kaohsiung,  April 27 (CNA) 04/27/07  16:40:04 (By Elizabeth Hsu)

Local officials in charge of health affairs from around the
country gathered Friday at the Kaohsiung city hall for a national
working meeting to review efforts in the prevention and control
of dengue fever outbreaks.
</P>
<P>
The annual event came three months earlier this year after signs
appeared showing that the mosquito-born disease has been well
placed to create an outbreak on the island since the beginning of
this year.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics of the Department of Health (DOH) -- the
meeting organizer -- 16 indigenous cases of dengue were recorded
Jan. 1 - April 24, and a further 22 cases were imported during
that period.
</P>
<P>
It is necessary for Taiwan to hold meetings of this kind earlier
than usual schedule, said Lin Ting, deputy director of the Center
for Disease Control, explaining that World Health Organization
online data show increasing dengue outbreaks in countries in
Southeast Asia and Latin America.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan needs to be well prepared in the face of the possible
inflow of overseas dengue virus and to strengthen its risk
management against viral stowaways, Lin said.
</P>
<P>
The working meeting was presided over by DOH chief Hou Sheng-mou,
who said in his address to the event that he is confident in
existing dengue prevention and control measures.
</P>
<P>
Over the past years Taiwan has been successful in stemming
outbreaks of dengue fever. That success has been most obvious in
Kaohsiung county, southern Taiwan, one of the most dengue-
affected areas of the country. In 2002 the county was hit by over
1,900 dengue cases, but five years later, only 185 cases were
reported, according to the DOH.
</P>
<P>
Kaohsiung County Magistrate Wu Yu-wen attributed the successful
disease control to cooperation between the Kaohsiung county and
city in efforts to wipe off sources of disease-carrying
mosquitoes.
</P>
<P>
However, Wu suggested that governments must continue to make a
coordinated effort to reinforce and promote the strategy of
"regional joint defense" in the fight against dengue epidemics.
</P>
<P>
Dengue fever is a flu-like viral disease spread by the bite of
infected mosquitoes which often breed in stagnant water close to
human dwellings.
</P>
<P>
The disease usually begins suddenly and is characterized by high
fever, rash, severe headache, pain behind the eyes, muscle and
joint pain, accompanied by nausea, vomiting and loss of appetite.
It may take a month for a patient to recover.
</P>
<P>
The most severe and potentially fatal infection by the virus is
the hemorrhagic type.
