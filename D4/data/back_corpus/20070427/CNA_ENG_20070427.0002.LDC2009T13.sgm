Taiwan rejected China's offer Thursday to include the island on
the torch-relay route for the 2008 Beijing Olympic Games, saying
Beijing's proposed route purposely denigrates Taiwan's sovereign
status.
</P>
<P>
According to China's plan, the Olympic torch would travel from
Vietnam's Ho Chi Minh City to Taipei, Taiwan's capital, and the
torch would then continue on to Hong Kong, Macau and several
other Chinese cities before arriving in the host city, Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Yang Jong-her, Minister of the National Council on Physical
Fitness and Sports, and Chinese Taipei Olympic Committee Chairman
Thomas W. Tsai quickly decided to reject Beijing's offer on the
grounds that Taiwan's sovereign status would be compromised.
