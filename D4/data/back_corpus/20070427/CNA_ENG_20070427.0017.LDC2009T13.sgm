PREMIER CALLS FOR EARLY PASSAGE OF NATIONAL PENSION BILL
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,   April  27  (CNA) 04/27/07  16:35:42 (By Y.F. Low)

<P>
Premier Su Tseng-chang urged the Legislative Yuan Friday to pass
a draft law on the national pension program as soon as possible
to facilitate an early start to the program.
</P>
<P>
Stressing that the program will provide a complete system to take
care of disadvantaged citizens, Su said the Cabinet will finalize
the bill next week and submit it to the legislature for review.
</P>
<P>
However, Su would not indicate if the government will increase
the monthly allowance for elderly farmers in the event of the
bill failing to pass the legislature.
</P>
<P>
If the law is not enacted, the government has a responsibility to
take some other measures to take care of disadvantaged citizens,
especially elderly farmers, he said.
</P>
<P>
The premier made the remarks during a question period in the
Legislative Yuan, when asked to comment on President Chen Shui-
bian's proposal that the monthly allowance for elderly farmers be
raised by NT$1,000 (US$30.12) to NT$6,000 if the national pension
bill does not pass the legislature by July.
</P>
<P>
Cabinet spokesman Chen Mei-ling said Thursday that the Executive
Yuan will not hike the monthly allowance for elderly farmers even
if the law is not enacted by July, sparking speculation that
there are differences between the Cabinet and the president on
the issue.
</P>
<P>
Currently, three kinds of monthly allowances are provided for
senior citizens 65 or over: NT$3,000 per month for those who have
registered their households in Taiwan and have lived in the
country for more than 183 days per year over the past three years
and who are not receiving government-subsidized shelter placement
or retirement pensions for military personnel; NT$5,000 per month
for those who made a living from farming or fishing; and between
NT$3,000 and NT$6,000 per month for low-income families.
</P>
<P>
Officials tallies show that the government paid out NT$71.2
billion between January and November 2006 in allowances for the
senior citizens, with the number of beneficiaries totalling 1.63
million.
