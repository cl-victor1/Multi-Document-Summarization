A Taipei city government official said Friday that a bus driver
who posted online the contents of videotapes from the bus video
camera had broken the law by violating the privacy of the
passengers.
</P>
<P>
Loh Hsiao-hsien, director of Taipei city government's Department
of Transportation, made the remarks after a public bus driver
working for Shin-Shin Bus Corp. posted the video content on the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
The bus driver argued that he made the video to protect himself
in the event of disputes with passengers or misconduct by
passengers. He added that he did it mainly to change the public's
impression of bus drivers.
</P>
<P>
Chen stressed that the video content from the monitors is usually
offered by bus companies to judicial authorities when there is an
accident or dispute between drivers and passengers.
</P>
<P>
However, the Shin-Shin Bus driver posted the video content on the
Internet, and the video has now become entertainment for Web
browsers, Chen said, adding that this has seriously violated the
passengers' privacy.
</P>
<P>
Liu Chi-hwa, general manager of Shin-Shin Bus Corp., said that
his company's monitors are generally aimed at drivers and the
view outside the bus. Noting that he was surprised by the
driver's move, Liu said his company has suspended him from his
job.
</P>
<P>
Chen urged all managers of bus companies to improve their
supervision of their drivers, adding that, otherwise, any
misbehavior by their drivers will result in demerits for the bus
companies in their evaluation reports.
