Taiwan's top China policy planner said Friday that when Chinese
citizens will be allowed to visit Taiwan as tourists hinges on
Beijing's attitude.
</P>
<P>
Mainland Affairs Council Chairman Chen Ming-tong said during a
question-and- answer session at the Legislative Yuan that Taiwan
and China have engaged in five rounds of talks on the matter and
he believes that cross-strait negotiations over the issue have
entered the final stage.
</P>
<P>
It is now up to Beijing to determine when Chinese citizens will
be allowed to travel to Taiwan for sightseeing this year, Chen
said, adding that so long as Beijing gives a green light, the
program could be implemented within the year.
</P>
<P>
Chen made the remarks in response to opposition Kuomintang
Legislator Huang Chien-ting, who said that Chinese tourists would
be a major force helping to rev up Taiwan's sagging tourism and
asked Chen when the government will open Taiwan's doors to
Chinese tourists.
</P>
<P>
Also answering questions at the Legislative Yuan on this issue,
Premier Su Tseng-chang said that welcoming Chinese citizens to
make sightseeing tour of Taiwan is an established governmental
policy, although some related issues, including the exercise of
Taiwan government's public authority, should first be discussed.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Su also said that opening Taiwan to Chinese tourists
is a part of the country's strategy to attract international
tourists, but not the whole of it, pointing out that welcoming
the Chinese in no way minimizes Taiwan's resolve to attract more
tourists from around the world.

<P>
The pop group F4, which has recently visited Japan and South
Korea to promote Taiwan's tourism industry at the invitation of
the Tourism Bureau, drew 5,000 of its Japanese and Korean fans to
Taipei last week, Su added.
