Taipei,  April 27 (CNA) 04/27/07  20:06:29 (By Elisa Kao)

<P>
President Chen Shui-bian said Friday that the 2008 Beijing
Olympic Games' torch relay route should follow the practices
adopted at 1964 Tokyo Olympics so that Taiwan will not be
downgraded by representation as a part of China.
</P>
<P>
Chen made the remarks after Chinese organizers of 2008 Olympic
Games announced Thursday night that Taipei would be included as a
stop in torch relay's domestic route.
</P>
<P>
According to Beijing's announcement, the Olympic torch would
arrive in Taipei from Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam before heading to
China-controlled areas of Hong Kong and Macau.
</P>
<P>
The government of Taiwan rejected being included on China's
domestic  torch relay  route  several  hours  after Beijing's
announcement.
</P>
<P>
Intent on not being downgraded, Chen, while presiding an opening
ceremony for a digital and electric products exhibition in
Taipei, said the 2008 Olympic torch relay should adopt the
practices used at 1964 Tokyo Olympics, in which the torch entered
Taipei from the Philippine, before traveling to Japan.
</P>
<P>
Chen expressed the hope that the 2008 Olympic torch would enter
and depart Taiwan via a third country other than China.
</P>
<P>
Chen said the government's refusal to be included on China's
domestic route protects Taiwan's dignity, and urged the public
not to speculate overly regarding the issue.
