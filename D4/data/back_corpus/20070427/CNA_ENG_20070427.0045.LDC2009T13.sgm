<P>
The European Chamber of Commerce in Taiwan (ECCT) expressed
approval Friday of the government's sincerity in making efforts
to improve the investment environment.
</P>
<P>
ECCT  representatives  made  the remarks  after  a two-day
government-ECCT annual coordination meeting, co-chaired by Thomas
M.F. Yeh, vice chairman of the Cabinet-level Council for Economic
Planning and Development (CEPD), and ECCT Chairman Ralf Scheller.
</P>
<P>
Discussions in the meeting focused on issues listed in the ECCT
2006-2007 report of its proposals for the government.
</P>
<P>
The ECCT participants praised the authorities' efforts in the
past year to answer various calls from the business organization,
including those for an amendment to the Civil Aviation Act to
allow liberalization  of the aviation market,  reinforced efforts
in intellectual property rights protection and the formation of
the National Communications Commission.
</P>
<P>
Yeh said the European business representatives expressed concern
over the promotion of cross-Taiwan Strait trading, as well as
other issues concerning whether Taiwan will remove excessive
economic restrictions, accelerate the development of the service
sector and build a preferential taxation system.
</P>
<P>
While some of the issues touch political concerns, the government
will adopt a deliberate attitude in dealing with the ECCT's
requests, Yeh said, adding that the CEPD will continue efforts to
push for solutions in an open manner.
</P>
<P>
The CEPD was commissioned to serve as the coordinator between the
government and foreign chambers of commerce in 1997, working to
promote communication and assist foreign businesses in resolving
investment problems.
</P>
<P>
According to the CEPD, there is a close bond between the
Taiwanese and European trade and economic sectors, with
statistics showing that bilateral trade amounted to 40 billion
euros in 2006.
</P>
<P>
European Union investment in Taiwan reached US$14.6 billion last
year, making it the largest foreign investor and the country's
fourth-largest trade partner, according to CEPD tallies.
