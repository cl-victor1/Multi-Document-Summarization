A group of scholars and professionals appealed to the major
political parties Friday to change the goverment's system to a
parliamentary system through the implementation of constitutional
amendments.
</P>
<P>
Lu Ya-li, professor emeritus of Political Science at National
Taiwan University, and Chou Yan-shan, professor of political
science at the Chinese Cultural University in Taipei, urged the
ruling and opposition parties of the legislature to initiate a
motion to revise the Constitution and change the system of
government.
</P>
<P>
Claiming that their opinions represent those of more than a
hundred political science scholars and professionals, Lu and Chou
said the general provisions of the current constitution, which
deals with the sensitive issues of the country's name and
territory, should remain intact.
</P>
<P>
However, they said at a news conference the central government's
system should be converted to a parliamentary system, with its
members chosen by a popular election system under which the
voters cast one ballot for their favorite candidates and one for
their favorite political parties.
</P>
<P>
They also called for an relaxation of the current criteria for
amending the Constitution.
</P>
<P>
Noting that both the ruling Democratic Progressive Party and the
major opposition Kuomintang have been in favor of a system of
parliamentary government, Lu and Chou urged them to come up
jointly with a motion for constitution revisions before May 5 and
put it to a national referendum held in conjunction with either
the legislative elections at the year end or the presidential
elections early next year.
