Taiwan's foreign exchange reserves stood at US$266.54 billion as
of the end of April, representing a decline of US$945 million
from the level of the previous month, according to statistics
released Friday by Taipei's Central Bank of China.

<P>
The decrease, however, did not shake Taiwan from its position as
the world's third-largest foreign exchange holder, bank officials
said, attributing the drop to the bank's selling of greenbacks in
an attempt to shore up the new Taiwan dollar's value.

<P>
The tallies also show that South Korea recorded foreign currency
reserves of US$246.8 at the end of April, while Russia's gold and
foreign exchange reserves totaled US$369 billion.

<P>
In the region, the foreign exchange reserves of India stood at
US$196.6 billion in April, while those of Singapore registered
US$138.1 billion for March, ahead of Hong Kong's US$131.5 billion
for the same month.
