DGBAS WARNS OF BUDGET BILL FAILURE
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taipei,  May 4 (CNA) 05/04/07  21:37:23 (By Flor Wang)
</P>
<P>
The Cabinet-level Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and
Statistics (DGBAS) warned Friday of an adverse impact on Taiwan's
economy if the 2007 government budget bill continues to be
blocked in the Legislative Yuan.
</P>
<P>
Should the budget bill fail to clear the Legislative Yuan soon,
the country's economic growth, gross domestic product and job
market will be negatively affected and ensuing ramifications will
arise, the DGBAS stated in a press release.
</P>
<P>
According to the DGBAS,  the failure of the bill in the
legislature will markedly hobble the normal operations and
policies of the central and local governments on a broad front,
ranging from national security and science development to subsidy
programs for underprivileged groups and urbanization plans.
</P>
<P>
The bill has been stonewalled for five months, some NT$31.2
billion in government spending has been slashed and NT$181.7
billion has been frozen, the DGBAS said.
</P>
<P>
The statement coincided with an ad run by the Executive Yuan in
three leading local newspapers,  accusing  the main opposition
Kuomintang (KMT) of maliciously killing the bill.
</P>
<P>
The Executive Yuan took the issue to public attention and
appealed for a speedy passage of the bill as lawmakers are slated
to address the bill and the Central Election Commission (CEC)
organic law next Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
KMT Secretary-General Wu Duen-yih blasted Su for running the ad,
accusing the premier of "lacking class and dignity" and of lying.
</P>
<P>
"It is deplorable that the country's highest administrative chief
could lie in public with the intention of passing the buck to the
KMT," Wu said in a press release issued later that same day.
</P>
<P>
In the Jan. 16 legislative meeting, ruling Democratic Progressive
Party (DPP) lawmakers disturbed the session to vent its anger
with the CEC organic law being listed before the 2007 government
budget bill on the Procedure Committee's agenda, Wu said. DPP
lawmaker Wang Shu-hui went so far as to throw her shoes at
Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng, he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
In the Jan. 19 legislative meeting, the last day of the winter
session, DPP lawmakers locked Wang out of the conference
auditorium and forcibly dismissed the meeting against the KMT's
will, leading to an impasse of the budget bill to date, Wu said,
adding that "it is the DPP that does not want to have the bill
approved, not the KMT."
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a Legislative Yuan news conference earlier in the
day, KMT lawmakers described the Executive Yuan's inability to
make the 2007 government budget bill clear the legislature as "an
unprecedented shame in Republic of China history."
</P>
<P>
The newspaper ad, with only two days to go before the ruling
DPP's presidential primary, is a clear indication that Su is
incapable of negotiating with opposition parties and that he only
has his party's election on his mind, they claimed.
</P>
<P>
"Su must be fully held accountable for the situation," KMT
legislative caucus whip Hsu Shao-ping said.
</P>
<P>
KMT lawmaker Alex Fai warned the Executive Yuan not to seek to
pass the buck to the KMT, because the bill's failure is a result
of the uncouth and brutal tussles intentionally staged by DPP
lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
"The KMT hopes for swift approvals of the two key bills, but the
DPP has blocked their passage in an attempt to have the KMT held
liable for the situation," Fai said.
</P>
<P>
In response to the KMT's attacks, DPP lawmaker Wang Sing-nan
threatened to mobilize supporters from southern Taiwan to protest
before the Legislative Yuan Tuesday if the 2007 government budget
bill is again blocked by the KMT.
</P>
<P>
Wang Sing-nan lashed out at the KMT for its insistence that the
CEC organic law must be addressed before the budget bill, calling
it extortion that should be condemned by the public.
