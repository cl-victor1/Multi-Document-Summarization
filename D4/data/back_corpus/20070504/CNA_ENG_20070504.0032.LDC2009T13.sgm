Taipei, May 4 (CNA) 05/04/07  20:34:43 (By Han Nai-kuo)

<P>
A river water treatment plant using gravel contact oxidation
technology went into operation Friday in Taipei with the aim of
reducing pollution in the Keelung river and removing the stench
from its water.
</P>
<P>
Taipei Mayor Hau Lung-bin presided over a ceremony inaugurating
the plant beside the Nanhu bridge in Taipei's Neihu district.
</P>
<P>
The plant's facilities include an effluent pond, a tank to catch
silt, drainage trenches and underground gravel contact oxidation
tanks that can process 55 million cubic meters of river water a
day.
</P>
<P>
Hau said the technology utilizes biofiltration -- a natural
metabolic activity of microorganisms -- and the oxidation process
to convert pollutants into carbon dioxide and water and get rid
of bad odors.
</P>
<P>
The mayor added that construction will begin soon on another
plant using the same technology at the Chenmei bridge in Nankang
to further purify the water in the Keelung river before the
tributary meets the Danshui river at Guandu.
</P>
<P>
Ni Shih-piao, director of the city government's Public Works
Department, noted that the technology has been proven to be
effective because about 80 percent of Japan's more than 200 river
water purification plants are using the method with great
success.
</P>
<P>
Wu Chun-hsien, head of the Sewage Systems Office under the city
government's Public  Works  Department,  said the river water
purification plant beside the Nanhu bridge will be equipped with
an observation room for visitors to see the purification process
and that the turf above the underground gravel contact oxidation
tanks will be turned into a croquet court.
