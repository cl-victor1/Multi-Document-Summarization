Taipei,  May 26 (CNA) (By Y.F. Low)
</P>
<P>
Premier Frank Hsieh on Thursday expressed the hope that the launch of
the Agricultural Bank of Taiwan (ABT) will help set up a complete
system of agricultural finance in Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Hsieh made the remarks when addressing the opening of the bank, which
is aimed at offering easier credit access to farmers and fishermen and
is in charge of guiding the credit operations of farmers' and
fishermen's associations nationwide.
</P>
<P>
Hsieh said that the establishment of the bank has been one of the
government's promises to enhance the well-being of farmers and
fishermen and that he hopes the bank's profits will be used to assist
in the development of farmers' and fishermen's associations.
</P>
<P>
The premier pledged that the government, which holds a 49 percent
stake in the bank, will monitor the operations of the bank to protect
the interests of farmers and fishermen.
</P>
<P>
According to Lee Chin-lung, chairman of the Council of Agriculture
(COA), the need to establish an agricultural bank was one of the
conclusions reached during the national conference on agricultural
finance held Nov. 30, 2002.
</P>
<P>
To pave the way for the bank's establishment, the government enacted
the agricultural finance law on Jan. 30, 2004, and set up the Bureau
of Agricultural Finance to supervise the credit operations of farmers'
and fishermen's associations, Lee pointed out.
</P>
<P>
He said the government's efforts have improved the financial quality
of these associations' credit operations significantly over the past
year, with their overdue loan ratio falling from 17.71 percent in
early 2004 to 13.97 percent at the end of March 2005.
</P>
<P>
Also, the COA is planning to set up an agricultural assets management
company to assist the farmers' and fishermen's associations in
handling non-performing loans in the hope that their overdue loan
ratio will be lowered to 5 percent, he added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, ABT Chairman Lin Peng-lang pledged that the bank will serve
its function to stabilize agricultural finance, improve the operations
of agricultural finance institutions and provide financing for major
agricultural development projects in line with the government's
agricultural policy.
</P>
<P>
The bank will also manage the deposits transferred from the credit
operations of farmers' and fishermen's associations, provide them with
financing, develop marketable financial products, and form a strategic
marketing alliance with farmers' and fishermen's associations, Lin
said.
