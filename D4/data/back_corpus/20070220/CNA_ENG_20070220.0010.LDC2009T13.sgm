The Ministry of Justice (MOJ) will strengthen its supervision of
narcotic hazard prevention and control centers nationwide this
year to ensure that they operate efficiently, ministry officials
said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the ministry will work with the Ministry of the
Interior, Department of Health, Ministry of Education and Council
of Labor Affairs to step up anti-drug publicity, improve the
social relief and rehabilitation services available to drug
addicts, and supervise the Taiwan After-Care Association's
establishment of a half-way home to shelter drug-addicted ex-
convicts and provide them with religious counseling, the
officials said.
</P>
<P>
The government has designated the five years 2004 - 2008 as the
"National Anti- Drug Combat Years" and has implemented a series
of measures with the goal of eliminating the hazards posed by
narcotic use.
</P>
<P>
Among these measures are the establishment of narcotic hazard
prevention and control centers in various counties and cities --
begun July 2006 --  to promote drug awareness,  provide drug
rehabilitation services, prevent drug abuse and help former drug
addicts avoid falling back into their old habit.
