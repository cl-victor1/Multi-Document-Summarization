The Taichung-based National Museum of Natural Science (NMNS) has
launched a "Viva the Pig" exhibit in celebration of the Year of
the Pig, as well as revealing many of the true facets of pigs,
museum official said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
NMNS Director Lin Tzong-shyan noted that there are some long-held
prejudices against pigs, such as laziness and stupidity, however,
pigs are smart, clean, and diligent, as their way of living shows
visitors.
</P>
<P>
According to some previous studies, the average intelligence
quotient of pigs trails after only humans, monkeys, whales and
dolphins. Pigs also possess a good ability to learn and a
significant long-term memory.

<P>
The exhibition covers several themes, including the 19 kinds of
wild boar existing on earth, the history of the domestication of
the pig, pig-related Chinese characters, and specimens of pigs
and boars from around the world.

The exhibit started Feb. 16 and runs thru May 15, and is open 9
a.m. - 5 p.m. everyday.
