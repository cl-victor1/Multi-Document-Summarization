President Chen Shui-bian traveled to the eastern city of Hualien
Tuesday to meet with bereaved families of the 228 Incident
victims.
</P>
<P>
Chen exchanged Lunar New Year greetings with the families at the
office of the Concern for 228 Incident Victims Association and
wished them a prosperous, auspicious new year.
</P>
<P>
Noting that he has come to gain a better understanding of the
living conditions of the families of the 228 Incident victims,
including the schooling and employment of their children, Chen
said his administration has spared no efforts to pursue the facts
concerning the events in the hopes that such a tragedy will never
be repeated.
</P>
<P>
"The 228 Incident" refers to a series of events in 1947 that led
to a brutal crackdown by the former Kuomintang (KMT) government
against the local population, particularly the intelligentsia.
</P>
<P>
"It is hoped that the historical facts concerning the 228
Incident will come to light in full to serve as a part of our
democratic education and help avoid any repetition of the
tragedy, " Chen said, adding that the pursuit of transitional
justice is an issue in all emerging democratic countries seeking
to resolve the sad legacies of authoritarian rule.
</P>
<P>
During the talks, Lin Lien-ming, president of the Concern for 228
Incident Victims Association, expressed worries that a 228
Incident memorial monument in Peipin Park in Hualien City may be
toppled because of a highway expansion project to link the nearby
Hualien Harbor Bureau to other parts of the city.
</P>
<P>
In response, Chen promised to ask relevant government authorities
to include the building of an even more magnificent monument in
commemoration of the tragic incident as part of the road
expansion project.
</P>
<P>
The bloody 228 Incident took place during a turbulent period of
Taiwan's history. In 1945, the mainland China-based KMT
government reclaimed Taiwan, which had been a Japanese colony.
But the KMT's rule was brutal and corrupt, leading to a massive
protest Feb. 28, 1947, by the native Taiwanese. More troops were
sent from the mainland to crush the demonstrations and in the
following months, soldiers arrested and killed thousands of
people whom they claimed were communists or saboteurs trying to
overthrow the government.
