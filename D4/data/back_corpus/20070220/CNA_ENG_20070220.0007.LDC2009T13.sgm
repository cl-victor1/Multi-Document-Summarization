Taipei,   Feb.  20  (CNA) 02/20/07  15:36:04 (By Y.F. Low)

Electoral authorities have decided tentatively to hold a by-
election on May 12 for the post of Keelung mayor, which has been
rendered vacant by the death of Hsu Tsai-li, an official said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Hsu, 60, who suffered from diabetes and cardiovascular disease,
died of related complications Monday after serving barely more
than one year of his second four- year term as Keelung mayor.
</P>
<P>
Teng Tien-yu, spokesman for the Central Election Commission,
noted that according to the country's election laws, a by-
election should be held within three months after an elective
post becomes vacant if the original office holder has not yet
served half of the term.
</P>
<P>
With a by-election due by May 19 in this case, the election
committee of Taiwan Province is planning to schedule the by-
election for May 12, as elections in the country are usually held
on the second Saturday of a month, Teng said.
</P>
<P>
He said the committee will call a meeting after the Chinese New
Year holiday to finalize the date for the election and other
related details.
</P>
<P>
Political observers said the upcoming by-election will be a
litmus test of the coalitions formed by the "pan-blue alliance"
and "pan-green camp" for the year- end legislative elections and
next year's presidential election.
</P>
<P>
Opposition People First Party (PFP) Legislator Liu Wen-hsiung
remains the most likely candidate to stand for the "pan-blue
alliance, " but the support of the party's ally -- the opposition
Kuomintang -- will be crucial for victory if he is to run for the
post, the observers said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, although the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) -led
"pan-green camp" is widely seen as enjoying weaker voter support
in the northern port city than the "pan-blue alliance, " DPP
officials said the party will take the by-election very
seriously.
</P>
<P>
Even if the DPP loses the by-election, the DPP will learn from
the results whether the people are disappointed in the party and
how it should adjust its strategies for the upcoming legislative
and presidential elections, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
It remains to be seen as to whether DPP Legislator Wang Tuoh, who
has expressed his intention to leave politics, will take part in
the by-election.
</P>
<P>
Hsu, who ran under the banner of the KMT in the last Keelung
mayoral election in December 2005, won with 76,162 votes, while
Taiwan Solidarity Union's Chen Chien-ming, who represented the
"pan-green camp," took 58,243 votes.
</P>
<P>
PFP's Liu garnered 47,932 votes, and the DPP's Wang got 2,771
votes despite his withdrawal from the election.
</P>
<P>
The KMT expelled Hsu from the party after he was found guilty of
corruption by the Keelung District Court in September 2006 for
trying to sell a plot of land he bought from a businessman to the
city's bus service department for a windfall profit.
</P>
<P>
The KMT had since urged Hsu to resign from the mayoral post and
launched a drive to recall him after the request was ignored.
