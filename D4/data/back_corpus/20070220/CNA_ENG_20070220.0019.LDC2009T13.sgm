Taipei,  Feb.  20 (CNA) 02/20/07  23:09:23 (By Sofia Wu)

The ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) will definitely
nominate a qualified aspirant to run for the Keelung mayorship
following the death of the northern port city's embattled Mayor
Hsu Tsai-li, the party's top leader said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
DPP Chairman Yu Shyi-kun made the remarks while visiting the
famous Lungshan Temple in Taipei to pray for national well-being
as part of his community outreach activities during the Chinese
New Year holiday.
</P>
<P>
Yu said he will meet with the leading figures of the DPP's
Keelung chapter and opinion leaders familiar with Keelung
politics in the next few days to exchange views on the party's
candidacy issue.
</P>
<P>
As to whether DPP Legislator Wang Tuoh, a veteran politician in
the Keelung constituency, will likely represent the DPP in the
upcoming Keelung mayoral by- election, Yu said he would not rule
out any possible candidate.
</P>
<P>
Wang garnered 2,771 votes in the last mayoral election in
December 2005, albeit he announced his withdrawal from the race a
few weeks before the election  and threw his support behind Chen
Chien-ming, the candidate of the Taiwan Solidarity Union, a DPP
ally in the legislature, who eventually captured 58,243 votes.
</P>
<P>
Hsu, who ran under the banner of the main opposition Kuomintang
(KMT) in the last mayoral election, won with 76,162 votes. He was
expelled by the KMT last September after being found guilty of
corruption for trying to sell a plot of land he bought from a
buisnessman to Keelung's city bus service department for a
windfall profit. The deal of called off after prosecutors began
probes into the case.
</P>
<P>
Hsu died from complications from chronic heart disease Monday a
the age of 60. According to the current public functionary
election law, a by-election must be held within three months
because Hsu had not yet serve out half of his term. A by-election
is tentatively set on May 12.
