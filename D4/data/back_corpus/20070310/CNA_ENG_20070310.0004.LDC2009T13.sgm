The total production value of Taiwan's flat panel display
industry in 2006 posted a 30.8 percent increase to reach NT$1.27
trillion (US$38.6 billion), thanks to rising demand, according to
statistics released Friday by the Industrial Technology Research
Institute (ITRI).

<P>
The total production value this year is likely to reach NT$1.45
trillion, ITRI analysts forecast.

The demand for large TFT-LCD panels is expected to rise, as the
market for Microsoft's new operating system, Vista, is expanding,
which will boost the demand for wide screen panels of LCD
monitors, notebooks and PCs, the analysts said.
</P>
<P>
As the price of liquid-crystal TVs is falling, the sales are
expanding, the analysts went on, adding that this will also help
increase sales of large TFT- LCD panels.

<P>
The analysts pointed out that to cope with falling prices,
manufacturers need to have flexible production capabilities and
improve their supply efficiency, which will also become the focus
of future competition.
