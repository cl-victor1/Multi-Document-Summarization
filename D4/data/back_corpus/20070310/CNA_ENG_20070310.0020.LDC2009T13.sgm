President Chen Shui-bian presented a state citation Saturday in
recognition of the contribution of the late hand puppet master
Huang Hai-tai to the development and promotion of the classic
folk art in Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Huang's  second  son,  Huang  Chun-hsiung,  who is also a
distinguished Taiwanese puppet master, received the citation on
behalf of his father at a grand funeral ceremony held in Yunlin
County, central Taiwan for the senior Huang.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the president, Premier Su Tseng-chang, Legislative
Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng and former opposition Kuomintang
Chairman Ma Ying-jeou also attended the funeral to pay tribute to
the folk arts master who was praised as a "treasure of the
nation."
</P>
<P>
During the ceremony, Government Information Office Minister Cheng
Wen-tsang, Minister of Cultural Affairs Chiu Kun-liang, Yunlin
County Magistrate Su Chih- fen, as well as Yunlin County Council
Speaker Su Chin-huang jointly draped Huang's coffin with the
national flag.
</P>
<P>
Huang Hai-tai passed away at his home in Yunlin Feb. 11 due to
pulmonary edema caused by the flu. Just two months ago, he had
celebrated his 107th birthday on Jan. 2. The Yunlin County
Council passed aresolution designating the date as "Yunlin Hand
Puppet Show Day" in recognition of Huang's contribution to the
development of hand puppet theater and related traditional folk
arts in Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Huang Hai-tai was born in 1901 in Hsiluo township, Yunlin County.
At the age of 15, he joined his father's hand puppet troupe to
begin a career as a puppeteer. In 1942, his own hand puppet
group, named Wu Chou Yuan, was recognized by the Japanese
colonial government as one of the few professional hand puppet
troupes in Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Huang, the father of eight sons and two daughters, was the
creator of a popular hand puppet drama "Yunchou Hero, " which was
later transformed into a successful TV series by Huang Chun-
hsiung.
</P>
<P>
Through the Huang family's efforts, classic hand puppet theater
was officially named in 2006 as a representative of Taiwan's
national image.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, Huang Hai-tai was awarded by the Ministry of Education
with the honorary title of folk arts master. In the following
year, he won the Global Chinese Culture and Arts Award and a
lifetime achievement award. He received the National Literary
Award in 2000.
</P>
<P>
As a result of Huang's advocacy, hand puppetry has become more
than just an entertainment choice, helping preserve several
aspects of traditional Taiwanese culture, including theater,
carving and embroidery. Since Yunlin started organizing biennial
international hand puppet festivals in 1999, the county has
helped revitalize the traditional art form.
