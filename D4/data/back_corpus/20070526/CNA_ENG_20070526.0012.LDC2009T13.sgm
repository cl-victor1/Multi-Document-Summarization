DYNAMIC MANAGEMENT TO REPLACE QUOTA SYSTEM IN FOREIGN LABOR
POLICY

<P>
Dynamic management will replace the existing quota system in the
government's foreign labor policy, Council of Labor Affairs (CLA)
Chairman Lu Tien-lin said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Explaining that dynamic management refers to basing the number of
foreign workers allowed into the country on the local
unemployment rate and general job market situation, Lu said the
CLA will invite representatives of employers, wage earners,
government agencies and academic groups to flesh out guiding
principles and technical details for the implementation of the
new policy.
</P>
<P>
Under the new policy, Lu went on, the door will open wider for
selected local industries to import more foreign workers when the
domestic  jobless  rate falls below a certain  level and the
introduction of more foreign laborers would have little impact on
local workers' job opportunities.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Lu said, the new policy will divide international
migrant workers into two groups -- "industry foreign laborers"
and "welfare service laborers" -- to be subject to different
management rules.
</P>
<P>
As the Ministry of the Interior is carrying out a 10-year
professional caregiving industry development  project aimed at
training a large number of qualified native caregivers, Lu said,
the number of foreign caregivers to be imported will gradually
decrease and the quota saved in this category will allow for the
import of more foreign workers for industry.
</P>
<P>
If the project fails to live up to expectations, Lu said, the
door will remain open for foreign caregivers. In an effort to
reduce the financial burden on low- income families that need to
employ foreign caregivers, Lu said, the CLA is considering
cutting down the "employment stabilizing fund" that each would-be
foreign caregiver employer is required to pay.
</P>
<P>
On the "industry foreign laborers" front, Lu went on, the CLA has
offered a 30,000-member quota for the backbreaking, dirty and
dangerous "3K" industries and industries that require round-the-
clock shifts, and a 23,000-member quota for major investment
projects. Neither of the quotas for these two categories of
foreign workers has been filled, Lu said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Lu said, the percentage of foreign workers for each
NT$10 billion infrastructure construction project has been
flexibly adjusted from 20 percent of the total to 40 percent.
</P>
<P>
To achieve a balance between local industries' demand for foreign
laborers and native workers' job opportunities, Lu said, the CLA
will set the foreign-native workers ratio for individual
industries in terms of their differing demand.
</P>
<P>
Quoting Executive Yuan tallies, Lu said the government has
sanctioned a quota of 391,926 for foreign workers. So far, local
employers have imported only 347,172, leaving an unused quota of
44,754.
</P>
<P>
In 2006, Lu said the government also approved a quota of 23,000
for foreign laborers for major investment projects. "So far, only
5,500, or 24 percent of the total, has been imported, "he added.
</P>
<P>
Hopefully, Lu said, companies that benefit from the introduction
of foreign workers should "show some social responsibility" by
giving priority to local workers, even though local laborers
command a much higher pay rate.
