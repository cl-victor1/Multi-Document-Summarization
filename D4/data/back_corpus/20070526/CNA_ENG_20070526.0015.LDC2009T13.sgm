LEGISLATIVE SPEAKER WANTS TO MEET KMT HEAD ON ELECTION TICKET
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  May 26 (CNA) 05/26/07  16:47:07 (By FLor Wang)

Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng said Saturday that he
would like to meet Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Wu Po-hsiung before
talking with the party's candidate, Ma Ying-jeou, on forming a
ticket for the 2008 presidential election.
</P>
<P>
Wang, a heavyweight in the main opposition KMT, said that he will
first meet Wu before deciding whether to meet Ma, as KMT Honorary
Chairman Lien Chan hopes Wu can help mediate the presidential
ticket issue between Ma and Wang.
</P>
<P>
Ma, who was nominated early this month by the KMT as its
presidential candidate, told reporters following a visit to Lien
Friday that Wang had better make his stance on the issue known by
the end of May as the KMT cannot afford to take any losses and
further procrastination on the matter will stir up greater
sentiment among supporters.
</P>
<P>
Ma also said that he will make substantial efforts to invite Wang
to serve as his running mate rather than just paying lip service.
</P>
<P>
In response to Ma's request, Wang said that he will come up with
a clear answer by the end of the month. "No matter what decision
I make, the KMT's overall interests will take precedence over my
personal wishes," he added.
</P>
<P>
Wang and Ma have failed to see eye to eye on a number of issues
and Wang appears reluctant to share a ticket with the KMT former
head.
</P>
<P>
As Wang will leave Sunday for a two-day visit to Malaysia, it is
expected that he will have to meet Ma next Tuesday at the
earliest.
