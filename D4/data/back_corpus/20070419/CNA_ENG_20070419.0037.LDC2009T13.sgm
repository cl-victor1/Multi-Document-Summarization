DPP CAUCUS APOLOGIZES TO NTU, PUBLIC
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  April  19 (CNA) 04/19/07  21:45:15 (By T.C. Jiang)
</P>
<P>
The legislative caucus of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) offered an apology Thursday to teachers and students at
National Taiwan University (NTU) , and the public, after two DPP
lawmakers unexpectedly staged an unauthorized emergency drill on
campus a day earlier.
</P>
<P>
Caucus whips Wang Sing-nan and Wang Tuoh, as well as DPP
Legislator Lin Kuo- ching issued the apology during a press
conference at the Legislative Yuan.
</P>
<P>
Wang Sing-nan said that the caucus did not approve of, nor
authorize the two lawmakers' call to police with a false report
that a gunman had seized two student hostages at NTU to test the
police response.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the lawmakers chose the wrong time to stage the
unauthorized drill, which came just days after a student shot 32
people to death before killing himself at Virginia Tech
University in the United States.
</P>
<P>
Wang Tuoh, for his part, stressed that the lawmakers were well-
intentioned, but did not think the matter through carefully.
</P>
<P>
Lin, who initiated the drill with fellow legislator Lee Chen-nan,
claimed that they were simply concerned about campus safety and
that schools in Taiwan did not conduct drills to guard against
terrorist attacks.
</P>
<P>
Lin apologized to NTU students for causing a disturbance at the
university, saying that Lee asked him to go there and that he did
not know beforehand that the students were having midterm exams.
</P>
<P>
Lee did not attend the press conference.
