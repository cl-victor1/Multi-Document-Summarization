Taiwan's household debt situation will take a turn for the better
later this year in light of rising household incomes and other
factors, said a credit card company Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The sitution is easing thanks to a rising per capita income, the
continuing appreciation of the New Taiwanese dollar against the
U.S. dollar, and a six-year low in the country's unemployment
rate -- all of which contribute to a stronger domestic economy,
said Wang Yue-hun, a chief researcher with MasterCard Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Wang said Taiwan's household debt reached its apex between 2004
and 2005 when each credit card holders held on average four to
five credit cards and household debt rose to 95.5 percent of
total household income.
</P>
<P>
In December 2005, said Wang, credit card spending totaled
NT$494.7 billion, and by February 2006, about 520,000 consumers
faced a combined debt of NT$160 billion in credit or cash card
debt.
</P>
<P>
The situation has noticeably improved since early 2006 in the
wake of strong intervention by the government, Wang said.
</P>
<P>
Wang added that after financial reforms were implemented over the
past two years, the overhead and operational costs of lenders and
other financial institutions have fallen, which has contributed
to shoring  up  Taiwan's substantive  foreign  exchange  rate
competitiveness.
