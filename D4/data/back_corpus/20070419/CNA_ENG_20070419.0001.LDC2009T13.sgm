The heads of three local governments agreed Wednesday to form a
task force to study the feasibility of building a light rail
rapid transit system for the region covering the city of Hsinchu
and the counties of Hsinchu and Miaoli.

<P>
Hsinchu Mayor Lin Junq-tzer, Hsinchu County Magistrate Cheng
Yung-chin and Miaoli County Magistrate Liu Cheng-Hung held a
meeting on the matter, which was also attended by Huang Der-ray,
director of the Hsinchu Science Park Administration.

<P>
They  reached  consensus  at the meeting  that  the three
administrative areas naturally form a large community and should
have a rapid transit system to serve the region and make the life
of its residents more convenient.
</P>
<P>
They decided to set up a NT$6 million fund to allow the task
force to conduct a feasibility study on the proposed project,
with the four parties each providing NT$1 million and the
shortfall of NT$2 million to be filled through a request for aid
to the central government.
</P>
<P>
The three local government heads agreed that regional planning
and strategic alliances are trends that will shape the future of
Taiwan's administrative areas, and that for the sake of the
common interests of the city of Hsinchu and the counties of
Hsinchu and Miaoli, it is necessary to assess the feasibility of
the light rail transit system as soon as possible.
