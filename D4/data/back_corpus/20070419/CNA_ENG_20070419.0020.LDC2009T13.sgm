SHANGHAI MAN RECEIVES TZU CHI BONE MARROW DONATION

Shanghai,  April 19 (CNA) 04/19/07  17:00:28 (By Kuo Mei-lan and
Deborah Kuo)
</P>
<P>
A 19-year-old Shanghai man underwent bone marrow transplant
surgery at a Shanghai hospital early Thursday, receiving 700 ml
of stem cells provided by Taiwan's Tzu Chi Bone Marrow and Stem
Cell Center.
</P>
<P>
Fang Dongwei, who suffers from inherited anemia, was doing fine
after the surgery, doctors from the Shanghai Xinhua Hospital
said.
</P>
<P>
In a telephone conversation, Fang told CNA that although he does
not know who the donor is, he is profoundly grateful to the
unnamed donor and to Taiwan's Tzu Chi Buddhist Compassionate
Relief Foundation, which made the transplant possible.
</P>
<P>
Fang checked into the hospital last November with anemia, which
doctors said could be treated only with a bone marrow transplant.
</P>
<P>
Three months later, the Tzu Chi Bone Marrow and Stem Cell Center
said it had found a compatible Taiwan donor.
</P>
<P>
Before Fang received the bone marrow transplant, he underwent six
rounds of chemotherapy over the past four months to prepare for
the donated bone marrow.
</P>
<P>
According to Liang Hui,  director of the hospital's blood
department, Fang's body is expected to adapt to the transplanted
stem cells in about three weeks and he will be discharged from
the hospital after two months of observation if no signs of
infection or rejection show during that period.

<P>
In late March, a three-year-old Chinese boy received a bone
marrow transplant from a Taiwanese donor.
</P>
<P>
The boy, surnamed Chiu, who also suffers from an inherited form
of anemia, received 600 ml of stem cells provided by the Tzu Chi
Bone Marrow and Stem Cell Center.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai doctors previously predicted that without a bone marrow
transplant, the child would not have lived beyond the age of 12.
</P>
<P>
So far the boy has been doing fine, according to hospital
authorities.
</P>
<P>
The Tzu Chi Bone Marrow and Stem Cell Center -- the largest of
its kind in Asia -- has built a databank of nearly 300,000 bone
marrow samples since its inception in 1993. It has helped more
than 300 victims of blood diseases to find donors.
</P>
<P>
The center now has access to data on more than 10 million donors
worldwide after linking with two bone marrow databanks in the
United States and Germany late last year.
