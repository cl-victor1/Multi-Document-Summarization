The Yungling Compassionate and Cultural Foundation, established
by the chairman of Hong Hai Precision Industry Company, Terry
Guo, decided Thursday to spend a fortune to initiate a "hope
engineering" project aimed at providing "equal opportunity
educations" to children in remote areas.

<P>
Guo, founder of the group and one of the 10 richest persons in
Taiwan, announced Thursday that he will channel another NT$700
million (US$21.21 million) over the following two years into the
foundation  to help finance the establishment  of schools  or
after-school classes in rural areas around the island that will
enable children in remote areas to access an education that is
equal to that available in the cities.
</P>
<P>
Guo and his daughter, Guo Hsiao-ling, who is chairwoman of the
foundation, are scheduled to jointly preside over a ceremony
April 22 to mark the opening of the "Hope Schools."

<P>
The "Hope Schools" will be established by the Yungling Foundation
in cooperation with a charity organization founded by Prof. Lee
Chia-tung, National Taitung University and nine other
universities around the country.
