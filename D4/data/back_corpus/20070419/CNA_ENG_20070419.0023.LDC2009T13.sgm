Taipei,  April  19 (CNA) 04/19/07  18:01:35 (By Nick Huang)

A 28-year-old South African man was diagnosed with malaria after
arriving in Taiwan from Singapore in late March, making him the
first malaria case reported in Taipei County this year, officials
of the county's Public Health Bureau said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The man, who arrived in the county's Tamsui township March 30,
developed fever April 9 and was diagnosed with malaria, for which
he was treated in hospital. He was discharged from the hospital
April 16 after recovery from the disease. It was an imported
malaria case, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
There were four imported malaria cases in the county last year,
the officials said, adding that the people contracted the disease
in Papua New Guinea, Myanmar and Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
Malaria, a sometimes fatal disease carried by mosquitoes, has
been eradicated in Taiwan for more than 40 years, but tallies
compiled by the Center for Disease Control under the Department
of Health show that between 30 and 50 imported cases are still
reported every year.
</P>
<P>
People intending to visit malarial areas such as Africa and
Southeast Asia should go to public health offices to get free
prophylactic medicine before traveling and should try to avoid
being bitten by mosquitoes while overseas.
