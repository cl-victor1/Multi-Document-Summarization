Premier Su Tseng-chang was furious at an unannounced campus
emergency drill launched by two lawmakers Wednesday that caused
unrest at a local university, Cabinet spokeswoman Chen Mei-ling
said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Chen made the remarks after ruling Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) legislators Lee Chen-nan and Lin Kuo-ching made a hoax call
to police that a gunman had taken two students hostage at
National Taiwan University (NTU).
</P>
<P>
The lawmakers, accompanied by officials from the Ministry of
Education (MOE) and the National Police Agency (NPA), claimed at
the school that the surprise drill was a test of the university
and the police ability to handle such a crisis.
</P>
<P>
However, Su was furious after learning of the lawmakers'
publicity stunt, Chen said, stressing that the act was
inappropriate and blaming the lawmakers for forcing education and
police officials to cooperate.
</P>
<P>
In view of an armed student's recent shooting rampage at Virginia
Tech university in the United States that claimed 33 lives, Su
had already instructed at a Cabinet meeting earlier Wednesday
that a set of standard operating procedures be established to
protect students' safety, Chen pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Chen also called on the relevant  government  agencies to
investigate the lawmakers' legal responsibility in causing such
chaos and disturbances.
</P>
<P>
Joyce Feng, dean of NTU's Student Affairs Division, offered her
apology after students complained about being startled by the
drill, which was held during the school's midterm exam week.
