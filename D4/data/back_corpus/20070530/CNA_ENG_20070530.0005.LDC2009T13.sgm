`APPEASEMENT BREEDS AGGRESSION': PRESIDENT
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taipei,   May  29  (CNA) 05/30/07  10:37:39 (By T.C. Jiang)
</P>
<P>
President Chen Shui-bian urged the international community
Tuesday not to "overlook China's irrational demands and
unreasonable behavior, " claiming that history shows that
"appeasement breeds aggression."
</P>
<P>
Chen made the appeal in his opening remarks at a videoconference
with the National Press Club (NPC) in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
Also present at the videoconference were House Representative
Lincoln Davis, former American Institute in Taiwan Chairman
Richard Bush, former Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Randall
Schriver, U.S.-Taiwan Business Council Chairman Rupert Hammond-
Chambers and NPC President Jerry Zremski.
</P>
<P>
International media, including the Associated Press, Reuters,
Agence France- Presse, the Voice of America, Kyodo News Agency,
Jiji Press, Sankei Shimbun, and Washington-based Taiwanese media,
also attended the conference.
</P>
<P>
The core issues between the U.S. and Taiwan always revolve around
ensuring peace in the Taiwan Strait,  Chen said, adding that
increasing  evidence  indicates "the  major  factors  for the
intensification and escalation of cross-strait tension do not
stem from Taiwan's continued efforts to deepen its democracy, but
rather from China's rapid military expansion."
</P>
<P>
Quoting the results of an annual report released by the U.S.
Defense Department May 25 on China's military power, Chen said
that "the aim of China's military modernization surpasses the
need to resolve a conflict in the Taiwan Strait. China has upset
the military balance not only in the Taiwan Strait, but also in
all of East Asia."
</P>
<P>
"It has enabled the People's Liberation Army (PLA) to launch
military activities outside of the Taiwan Strait, and could start
with activities in its peripheral regions. China is marching
toward becoming a global military hegemony," Chen went on.
</P>
<P>
He also used the recent World Health Assembly (WHA) annual
meeting held in Geneva and the General Assembly of the World
Organization for Animal Health (OIE) held in Paris as examples to
show that China's unreasonable suppression has long excluded
Taiwan from participating in the World Health Organization (WHO).
</P>
<P>
Chen further said that the OIE succumbed to pressure from China
and passed a draft resolution to downgrade Taiwan's status from
that of a sovereign country to that of a non-sovereign regional
member.
</P>
<P>
"The OIE's rationale was based solely on China's unilateral
assertion that the PRC includes Taiwan and that the PRC
government is the sole legitimate government representing the
whole of China," Chen said.
</P>
<P>
Describing  the argument as "unprecedented,  surpassing and
replacing Beijing's past official position, " Chen emphasized
that "Taiwan has never been under the jurisdiction of China and
that Taiwan and China are two independent nations on each side of
the Taiwan Strait."
</P>
<P>
"Taiwan is Taiwan, and China is China; there is one country on
each side of the Taiwan Strait. Taiwan currently has official
diplomatic relations with 25 countries around the world.
Therefore, to include Taiwan as part of PRC not only ignores a
historical fact, but also directly challenges the status quo in
the Taiwan Strait by attempting to change and damage that status
quo," Chen stressed.
</P>
<P>
He further said the international community, especially the free
democratic camp led by the United States, Japan and the European
Union,  should not pverlook China's  irrational  demands  and
unreasonable behavior simply becasue of its size and power.
</P>
<P>
"To maintain lasting peace in the Taiwan Strait and ensure
security and stability in the Asia-Pacific region, the
international community must send the right message to China, "
Chen said, adding that the world must guide China towards
political democratization.
