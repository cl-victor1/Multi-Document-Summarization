Chiayi County public health bureau officials warned Wednesday
that a growing number of young people are taking up smoking and
called for widespread public efforts to build a 100 percent
smoke-free environment in public places.
</P>
<P>
Citing the results of a telephone survey, the officials said that
20.8 percent of Chiayi County residents are smokers -- a level
lower than the Taiwan average of 22.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
Among Chiayi smokers aged over 18, the 18-19 age group accounts
for the largest ratio of about 24.9 percent, followed by 19.7
percent in the 50-64 age group and 19.3 percent in the 30-39 age
group, respectively -- an indication that more and more young men
and women are smoking, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
In terms of educational levels, smokers with an elementary
education or less make up 41 percent of the total, ahead of 28
percent of senior high school graduates. Men and women account
for 53 percent and 47 percent, respectively.
</P>
<P>
The public places where people are most often disturbed by
second-hand smoke are streets (30.6 percent) , restaurants (19.1
percent), bus stops and train stations (15.4 percent), markets
(11.5 percent) and parks (8.3 percent), the officials said.
</P>
<P>
As May 31 has been designated World No Tobacco Day, the officials
urged the public to cooperate with county authorities in helping
build a 100 percent smoke-free environment in indoor and outdoor
places, including restaurants and at home, as well as on campus
and in the workplace.
