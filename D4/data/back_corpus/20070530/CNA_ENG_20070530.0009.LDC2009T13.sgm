Former President Lee Teng-hui, accompanied by his wife, Tseng

Lee and his wife were  seen  off at the Taiwan  Taoyuan

including National Security Council Secretary- General Tan Sun
Chen, several opposition Taiwan Solidarity Union lawmakers, and
supporters of Lee.

According to the itinerary released by Lee's office, Lee will
spend the first three days visiting Tokyo,  culminating in a
prize-presentation ceremony to be held on June 1, when he will be
presented with the first Shinpei Goto Prize by Tokyo's Shinpei
Goto Society and deliver a speech titled "Shinpei Goto and Me"
during the ceremony.

The prize was established to mark the 150th anniversary of the
birth of the late Japanese colonial administrator Shinpei Goto.
It is awarded to people who have contributed to national or
regional development.

From June 2-5, Lee will make an "oku no hosomichi" tour covering
the prefectures of Miyagi, Yamagata, Iwate,  Akita and Gunma,
retracing a journey made by Basho in 1689 based on which his
famous work "Oku no Hosomichi, " or "Narrow Road to the Interior,
" was written.
