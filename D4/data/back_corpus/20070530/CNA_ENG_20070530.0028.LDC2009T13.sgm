Taipei,  May  30 (CNA) 05/30/07  20:24:42 (By Chris Wang)

Resolutions to a substantial number of industry issues were
reached in discussions between the European Chamber of Commerce
Taipei (ECCT) and the government, although little progress was
made on cross- Taiwan Strait issues, the ECCT announced
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"In all, around a dozen issues were conclusively resolved, while
over 40 other issues were either close to being resolved or
substantial  progress had been made toward achieving  workable
solutions that were acceptable to both the government and the
ECCT, " said ECCT Chairman Ralf Scheller after a series of
meetings hosted by the Council for Economic Planning and
Development (CEPD) that discussed around 150 issues that were
raised in the ECCT's 2006-2007 Position Papers.
</P>
<P>
Normalization of cross-strait business relations, which the ECCT
views as essential to Taiwan's future economic prosperity,
however, was among a number of unresolved issues, ECCT officials
said, noting that around 2,300 items remain on list of banned
items for import into Taiwan from China.
</P>
<P>
The organization also pointed out that Taiwan is still not in
compliance with a number of its World Trade Organization (WTO)
commitments and said excessive regulation is hampering the
development of the economy, especially in the service industry.
</P>
<P>
One of the good signs  of the discussions  is that some long-
standing issues facing the automotive, retail and transportation
industries were resolved. In addition, the ECCT recognized that
the government has been instrumental in urging various ministries
and departments to work harder to improve the business
environment.
</P>
<P>
The ECCT released its 2006-2007 Position Papers in October 2006,
stating that normalizing Taiwan's economic relations with China
is crucial to Taiwan's future prosperity.
