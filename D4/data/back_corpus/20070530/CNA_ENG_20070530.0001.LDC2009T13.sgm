Taipei, May 29 (CNA) 05/30/07  00:45:48 (By Sofia Wu)

<P>
President Chen Shui-bian warned Tuesday that a Taiwan ruled by
any political party that upholds the goal of "ultimate
unification with China" would pose a severe challenge and trial
to the mutual trust and foundation for cooperation with the
United States.
</P>
<P>
Chen made the remarks while holding a videoconference with the
U.S. National Press Club in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
Noting that May 20 marked the seventh anniversary of his
inauguration  as Taiwan's  president,  Chen  said  he finished
reorganizing and swearing-in the new Cabinet the following day.
</P>
<P>
"Although there is only one year left of my presidency, it
doesn't signify the end of an era, but instead, the advent of a
new beginning," Chen said.
</P>
<P>
Describing the Taiwan-U.S. relations over the past seven years
with the saying: "A friend in need is a friend indeed, " Chen
said Taiwan and the United States have enjoyed a solid
camaraderie over the years.
</P>
<P>
With their shared values of freedom and democracy as the bedrock
of their relations, Chen said both Taiwan and the United States
are committed to maintaining and defending Taiwan's democracy and
the status quo of peace in the Taiwan Strait and to preventing
any unilateral changes.
</P>
<P>
He further said that it is in the long-term interest for both
Taiwan and the United States to see to a Taiwan that is growing
ever-more free, more democratic, and fully protects human rights,
a Taiwan whose national sovereignty is independent from the PRC,
and a Taiwan that is committed to enhancing its self-defense
capabilities.
</P>
<P>
The videoconference was moderated by NPC Vice Chairman Peter
Hickman.
</P>
<P>
Also present at the occasion were House Representative Lincoln
Davis, former American Institute in Taiwan Chairman Richard Bush,
former Deputy Assistant Secretary  of State Randall Schriver,
U.S.-Taiwan Business Council Chairman Rupert Hammond-Chambers and
NPC President Jerry Zremski.
</P>
<P>
Major news media, including the Associated Press, Reuters, Agence
France-Presse, the Voice of America, Kyodo News Agency, Jiji
Press, Sankei Shimbun, and Washington-based Taiwanese media, also
sent reporters to cover the event.
