Tainan prosecutors raided the National Space Program Office
(NSPC) in northern Taiwan Wednesday, seizing documents and
bringing in six staff members, including office Director Lance
Wu, for questioning over allegations related to its satellite
procurement.

Officials of the National Applied Research Laboratories, which
scrutinizes the NSPC's operations, said that several NSPC
satellite procurement packages were carried out according to due
process but added that they will cooperate with the prosecution
in the probe.

According to the officials, the NSPC's satellite development
plan, worth NT$1.5 billion and aimed at manufacturing a satellite
designed independently by Taiwan, forms part of a long-term space
technology development project and was initiated by Wu when he
assumed the post in 2004.

personnel to collect evidence in the NSPC office in the Hsinchu
Science-based Industrial Park.
