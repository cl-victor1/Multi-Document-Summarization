Taipei county government officials announced Wednesday  that the
county will hold an economic  development conference June 6-8
with the aim of injecting fresh momentum into its economy.

<P>
Taipei Magistrate Chou Hsi-wei made the announcement in a news
conference that was also attended by representatives from the
local hi-tech, service and tourism sectors. Taipei County, which
encircles Taipei City -- Taiwan's capital --  is the country's
largest administrative district both in terms of population and
geographic size.
</P>
<P>
According to Chou,  Taipei County has great potential for
developing hi-tech and service-oriented business. To create
business opportunities and lure tourists, the county authorities
are to assume responsibility for creating an environment suitable
for sustainable growth to serve that end, he said.

Chao Teng-hsiung, chairman of the Far Glory Group, which is a
prominent construction concern, said that Taiwan has increasingly
been cast aside economically on the world market due to the
country's special political situation and a lack of continued
progress -- evidenced in that Ireland and South Korea have in
recent years surpassed Taiwan in economic terms.
</P>
<P>
The authorities' ambitions to develop the economy must be
visionary and their policy making must be transparent so as to
court greater investment, Chao said.
