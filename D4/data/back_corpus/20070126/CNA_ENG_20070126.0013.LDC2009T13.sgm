Paris,  Jan. 25 (CNA) 01/26/07  13:00:27 (By Y.S. Lo and Deborah
Kuo)
</P>
<P>
Republic of China President Chen Shui-bian, on behalf of the
Taiwan Foundation for Democracy (TFD), is scheduled to confer the
2006 Asia Democracy and Human Rights Award on Reporters Without
Borders (RWB) at a ceremony to be held in Taipei Sunday.
</P>
<P>
RWB Secretary-General Robert Menard -- who established the
organization in 1985 aimed at fighting for freedom of the press
and freedom of expression and ensuring the protection of
journalists by denouncing human rights breaches -- is preparing
to depart for Taipei Friday to receive the award in person.
</P>
<P>
Menard said it is extremely significant for him and the RWB that
officials from the association were invited to visit China and to
receive an important award to be conferred by Taiwan within a
single week.
</P>
<P>
It reflects the fact that the RWB's clout and the values that the
RWB has insisted on have also been recognized in Chinese-speaking
areas, Menard said.
</P>
<P>
Menard said the prize money that comes with the award will be
used to finance the establishment of a new RWB website in Chinese
aimed at allowing more Chinese-speaking people to enjoy the
benefits of freedom of the press and to be better informed.
</P>
<P>
Menard and two RWB officials just returned to Paris the day
before from China. They had been invited by the Chinese
authorities to visit Beijing and Shanghai for the first time.
</P>
<P>
He said that during their visit, they handed the Chinese
authorities a name list of Chinese journalists who have been
imprisoned and asked Beijing to take concrete steps in response
to their expressed concerns on the matter before 2008 when the
Olympic Summer Games will be held in the Chinese capital.
</P>
<P>
RWB,  an association  officially recognized  by the French
government and committed to serving the public interest, has been
defending press freedom globally on a daily basis since its
founding.
</P>
<P>
It has kept on constant alert via its network of over 100
correspondents and has rigorously condemned any attack on press
freedom around the world by keeping the media and the general
public informed through press releases and public- awareness
campaigns.
</P>
<P>
The association defends journalists and other media professionals
who have been imprisoned or persecuted for doing their work. It
speaks out against the abusive treatment and torture that is
still common practice in many countries.
</P>
<P>
It supports journalists who are being threatened in their own
countries and provides financial and other types of support to
their needy families.
</P>
<P>
RWB is also fighting to reduce the use of censorship and to
oppose laws designed to restrict press freedom and working to
improve the safety of journalists world-wide, particularly in war
zones.
</P>
<P>
Since January 2002, when it created the Damocles Network, RWB has
acquired a judicial arm. In order to ensure that murderers and
torturers of journalists are brought to trial, the network
provides victims with legal services and represents them before
the competent national and international courts so that proper
judicial procedures can be implemented.
