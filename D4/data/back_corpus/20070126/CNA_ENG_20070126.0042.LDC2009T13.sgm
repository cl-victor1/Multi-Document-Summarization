Six fruit farmers from central and southern Taiwan received
Friday EurepGAP certificates for the Taiwanese papayas and Indian
dates they took great pains to cultivate.
</P>
<P>
These are the first Taiwan-grown papayas and dates certified
under the global system,  developed  by a European  group of
representatives  from all sectors of the fruit and vegetable
industries to ensure the safety and high quality of produce, and
to encourage sustainable agriculture.
</P>
<P>
The certificate presentation took place at the Kaohsiung District
Agricultural Improvement  Station operated  by the Council of
Agriculture (COA) , with the honored farmers: Yang Chien-teh,
Yang Chien-jen, Yuan Ruei-ho, Wu Chien-min and Ho Yung-fu from
Pingtung county, as well as Chiu Chun-nan from Nantou county.
</P>
<P>
In addition to EurepGAP, their products have also been certified
under ISO09001:2000, Japan's traceability system for agricultural
produce, according to the Kaohsiung station dedicated to
improving agricultural production.
</P>
<P>
Describing the certification as the sweet fruit of a year's hard
work, Yang Chien-jen said that of a crowd of farmers who answered
the COA's call to pursue the international certificate, only they
were able to complete all of the challenging  and energy-
consuming EurepGAP-required tasks, which includes a great deal of
paper work to thoroughly document the planting process.
</P>
<P>
It was necessary to undergo health tests, send samples of water
and soil from the grounds in which they grew the fruits, Yang
noted, adding that the only reason for them to pursue this goal
was that only  safety-guaranteed  fruits are  permitted  to enter
the international market.
