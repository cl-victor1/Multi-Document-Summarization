PRESIDENT SUGGESTS REVISING LAW ON OFFICIALS' SPECIAL ALLOWANCES
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  Jan. 25 (CNA) 01/26/07  23:33:51 (By Maubo Chang)

President Chen Shui-bian said Friday that the controversies
arising from the president's "special state affairs funds" and
senior officials' special allowances are more of a political
issue than a legal one, and suggested resolving these issues by
revising the law currently regulating them.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the "Towards a Global Forum on New Democracies" event
in Taipei, the president--whose wife was indicted for helping him
claim special state affairs funds with other people's invoices--
quoted Premier Su Tseng-chang as saying that both the funds and
senior officials' special allowances are practices "developed
over many years".
</P>
<P>
He also cited Vice President Annette Lu as saying that the funds
and the allowances are part of the problems that cropped up
during the country's painful transformation from an authoritarian
regime to democracy.
</P>
<P>
Noting that he had tried to tide over his troubles by asking the
Council of Grand Justices to reconfirm his constitutional
immunity from any criminal investigation and indictment, the
president said the congroversies arising from special allowances
budgeted by the government for discretionary use by senior
officials might have to be settled through a revision of the law.
</P>
<P>
Chiu I-jen, the president's chief security aide, said afterward
that Chen made the suggestion out of a fear that more public
officials would be probed for their use of special allowances,
particularly given the fact many prominent officials, including
former Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou, had already been questioned by
prosecutors over their allowances.
</P>
<P>
Although the allowances were supposed to be used by senior
officials at their discretion, the rules do not allow officials
to line their won pockets with the allowances, and therefore many
officials were unwittingly violating the rules by funneling their
allowances into their persoanl bank accounts.
