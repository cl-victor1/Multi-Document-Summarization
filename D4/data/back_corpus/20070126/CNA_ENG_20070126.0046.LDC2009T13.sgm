Agricultural and farm goods produced in central Taichung county
have been hard hit by Taiwan's  entry  into the World Trade
Organization, and Magistrate Huang Chung-sheng has been keen on
selling local products in foreign markets to help improve the
livelihood of the affected farmers, the spokesman explained. In

Malaysia.

Oranges produced in Taichung county are considered to be one of
Taiwan's best fruits and are very popular among Chinese in

of prosperity and good luck during Chinese New Year holidays.

worth NT$172 million (US$5.23 million) during the 2003-2005
