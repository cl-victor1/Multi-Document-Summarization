Twenty-five Taiwan fugitives who had fled to China were
repatriated to the Taiwan-held outlying island of Matsu Friday in
accordance with the Kinmen Agreement signed by the Red Cross
societies on the two sides of the strait in 1990.

Following the repatriation Thursday of two key suspects in a Jan.
2 armored truck heist who were apprehended by Chinese security
authorities after fleeing Taiwan to Yunnan Province, 25 other
Taiwan fugitives -- mostly suspected members of cross-strait
fraud rings -- were repatriated to Matsu under escort by Chinese
public security officers.

The 25 criminal suspects will be airlifted back to Taiwan proper
soon following their interrogation by Matsu police.

Meanwhile, 198 illegal Chinese immigrants nabbed in Taiwan were
repatriated from Matsu back to China aboard the same vessel that
had carried the 25 Taiwan fugitives from Fujian Province.

The armored truck heist suspects -- Lee Han-yang, the driver of
the vehicle owned by Group 4 Securicor, a private security
company in Taipei City, who alleged drugged his colleague and
made off with NT$56 million (US$1.7 million) -- and his younger
brother, Lee Chin-tsan, an accomplice in the case who once did
business in Yunnan, were repatriated from China to Matsu Thursday
before being airlifted to Taiwan proper later the same day.
