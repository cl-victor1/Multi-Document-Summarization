PRESIDENT URGES EMERGING DEMOCRACIES TO DEEPEN DEMOCRACY
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  Jan.  26 (CNA) 01/26/07  15:18:11 (By Y.F. Low)

<P>
President Chen Shui-bian said Friday emerging democracies need to
consolidate and deepen their democratic systems to overcome a
common danger that they all face -- the possible restoration of
authoritarianism.
</P>
<P>
"The dangers and problems that democracies face can only be
overcome through the consolidation and deepening of democracy.
Backtracking is never the answer, " Chen said while addressing a
Taipei conference aimed at paving the way for the formation of
the "Global Forum on Emerging Democracies."
</P>
<P>
Chen pointed out that since the 1970s, approximately 30 countries
around the world have transformed from authoritarian to
democratic nations, kickstarting the so-called "third wave of
democratization."
</P>
<P>
Unlike mature democracies whose democratic development has been
"incremental,  " most emerging  democracies  have undergone  a
"leapfrogging" democratization, with democracy achieved virtually
overnight amid the passionate shouts of the crowds, Chen noted,
pointing to the collapse of the Berlin Wall as an example.
</P>
<P>
As a new order has yet to be established following the abrupt
deposition of the old authoritarian  system in these emerging
democracies, conflicts that were covered up in the past tend to
surface rapidly, he said.
</P>
<P>
With democratization  bringing about more confrontation and
conflicts, the people's aspirations for democracy also turn into
doubt and even disappointment, he said.
</P>
<P>
"This provides an opportunity for the regression of democracy and
the restoration of the old authoritarian forces, which is a
common problem faced by all emerging democracies, " Chen said.
</P>
<P>
While there isn't any one so-called "correct" answer to the
problem, the respective experiences of these countries and the
observations of their leaders are important assets that can help
them further consolidate and deepen their democracy, the
president said.
