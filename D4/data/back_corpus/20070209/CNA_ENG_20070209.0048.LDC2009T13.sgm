NAME CHANGE OF CPC TO TAKE EFFECT IMMEDIATELY: ECONOMICS MINISTER

Taipei,  Feb.  9 (CNA) 02/09/07  23:38:39 (By Lilian Wu)

Two state-owned enterprises -- Chinese Petroleum Corp. (CPC) and
China Shipbuilding Corp. (CSBC) -- are set to change their names
in line with the nation's "name rectification" campaign, Minister
of the Economic Affairs Steve Ruey-long Chen said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Chen said that the name of the CPC, which will be changed to
Taiwanese Petroleum in Chinese and "CPC Corporation, Taiwan"(or
CPC in short) in English, will take effect immediately.
</P>
<P>
A ceremony marking the new name of the CPC will be held Feb. 12,
Chen said, while the name of the CSBC, which will be changed to
CSBC Corporation, Taiwan (or CSBC in short), will only take
effect after the decision -- approved by its board of directors
earlier Friday -- is endorsed at an upcoming shareholders'
meeting March 1.
</P>
<P>
Chen noted that the name-change of the state-owned enterprises
aims at avoiding confusion with similarly named businesses in
China.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the name-change will positively impact the
image, brand and market identification of the companies,
providing an upgrade in their international competitive edge, and
will by no means affect the rights of the employees in the two
companies.
</P>
<P>
On the cost of "name-rectification,' Chen said the ministry has
clearly instructed the two companies to change their names in the
most "simple, efficient and cost-saving" way.
</P>
<P>
For example, the sign boards of the CPC petrol stations will not
have to be changed completely, and the ID passes of the employees
will only require stickers, which he said will incur only a "very
limited cost."
</P>
<P>
President Chen Shui-bian first proposed the "name-change"
campaign in December 2004, saying that state-owned enterprises
that bear the names of "China" or "Chinese" should change their
names to highlight that they are Taiwanese companies.
</P>
<P>
The Executive Yuan has recently announced that it would promote
the name changes in a "reasonable and pragmatic" way.
