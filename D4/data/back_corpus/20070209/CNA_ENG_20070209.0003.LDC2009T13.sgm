POST OFFICE TO CHANGE NAME

Taipei,  Feb. 8 (CNA) 02/09/07  10:44:34 (By Y.C. Jou)

Chunghwa Post Co., the state-owned postal service, will change
its name Friday to show its Taiwan identity in a wave of name
changes among state enterprises.
</P>
<P>
The word "Chunghwa" means China. A new Chinese name translated as
"Taiwan Post Co." will be applied after a board meeting Friday
passes the proposal, although an official English name has yet to
be decided, company officials said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Chunghwa released Thursday a position paper and said the change
of its title is actually a restoration with historical
significance, because  Taiwan's  postal service was first named
Taiwan Post Administration when founded in 1888 by Liu Ming-
chuan, the first Governor of Taiwan appointed by China's Ching
Dynasty.
</P>
<P>
The position paper denies claims that a change of name can only
be legal if the legislature amends the law governing the
service's establishment, pointing out that as a company it can
change its name upon a resolution by its board of directors.
</P>
<P>
Not everyone in the company was happy with the change and union
Chairman Tsai Liang-chuan said he will lead colleagues in a
protest at the board meeting Friday.
</P>
<P>
We don't see any good the name change can bring to the company's
business, he said, adding that "it's regrettable for the name-
changing  of state enterprises to be used for political
purposes."
</P>
<P>
Lai Ching-chi, chairman of Chunghwa Post, said a new signboard
will be in place as soon as Monday.
</P>
<P>
He said the cost of the change won't be as much as some have
claimed, estimating it to be around NT$67 million. "Old
signboards are scheduled to be replaced anyway," he said.
