Taiwan's representative office in Germany protested against the
organizer of the 57th Berlin International Film Festival
Thursday for continuing  to label Taiwan's films in competition
as Chinese film products.
</P>
<P>
In a press release handed to the Berlin film festival organizer,
officials of Taiwan's representative office in Germany said the
country is proud of being invited to participate in the festival.
However, the organizer's labeling of Taiwanese films as "Taiwan,
China" has seriously insulted Taiwan's democracy, as the island
is a democratic and sovereign country in its own right, while
China has never exercised sovereignty over Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
The officials noted that the festival organizer' move contrasted
with those of the organizer of the Cannes Film Festival and the
Venice International Film Festival, which introduced Taiwanese
films simply as Taiwanese.
</P>
<P>
The protest letter has obtained the attention of major European
media, including Germany's Der Spiegel weekly magazine, which
published the whole letter in its online edition.
</P>
<P>
The weekly magazine noted that the German government adopts a
"one China" policy, which means Taiwan can only promote its
diplomacy through a representative office rather than an embassy.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the Berlin film festival explained to Der Spiegel
that they adopted the German Foreign Ministry's policy of
maintaining close relations with Taiwan without recognizing it
diplomatically.
</P>
<P>
Switzerland's Neue Zurcher Zeitung said in its international
edition that the fact that the cultural achievements of the most
democratic country in Asia has been included in the products of
autocratical China reflect the political ignorance of the film
festival organizer, and said Taiwan's anger is understandable.
</P>
<P>
Officials of Taiwan's representative office in Germany said it
was not the first time that the organizer of Berlin film festival
had labeled Taiwan as "Taiwan, China."
</P>
<P>
Last year, Taiwanese officials also protested against the label,
which resulted later in a correction by the film festival
organizer.
