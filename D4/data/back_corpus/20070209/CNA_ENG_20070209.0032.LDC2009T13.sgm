Beijing  should  speed up its democratization to appeal to the
people of Taiwan if it expects Taiwan to unify with China, a
Taiwan official said in the U.S. capital Thursday.
</P>
<P>
According to Mainland Affairs Council Chairman Joseph Wu, the
government of Taiwan respects its people's choice on whether the
country should unify with China or declare independence.
</P>
<P>
However, the undemocratic practices adopted by China are making
unification an increasingly undesirable choice for the Taiwanese
people, Wu said.
</P>
<P>
For example, he said,  the Chinese people under Beijing's
totalitarian rule enjoy no press, religious or political freedom,
and democracy in Hong Kong has regressed after its handover to
China from the British colonial government.
</P>
<P>
In addition, China's relentless suppression of Taiwan in the
international community is also abominable to the people of
Taiwan, Wu said.
</P>
<P>
As a consequence, results of various opinion polls indicate that
the vast majority of people in Taiwan are opposed to Chinese
rule, with more and more people supporting independence for
Taiwan, he said.
</P>
<P>
Wu made the remarks in response to a question on the issue of
Taiwan independence after an interview with U.S. cable television
station C-SPAN.
</P>
<P>
Asked about the necessity of Taiwan spending big money on arms
procurements, Wu said the purpose of Taiwan's arms procurement is
to defend itself from a Chinese invasion, not to attack China,
because Taiwan needs to equipped with strong self-defense ability
to protect its economic prosperity.
</P>
<P>
Wu pointed out that China has been building up its military power
over recent years, with the number of missiles targeting Taiwan
increasing year after year.
</P>
<P>
While Beijing has continued to upgrade its fighter aircraft,
China's submarines have appeared more and more frequently in
waters close to Taiwan, Wu said.
