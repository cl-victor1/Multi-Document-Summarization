CHUNGHWA POST LABOR UNION RESISTS COMPANY NAME CHANGE
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  Feb. 9 (CNA) 02/09/07  14:51:10 (By Deborah Kuo)

Members of the labor union of Chunghwa Post Co. resisted Friday a
plan to have the state-owned postal service's name changed and
blockaded the office of Chunghwa Post chairman to bar him from
attending a board meeting aimed at endorsing the name change
plan.
</P>
<P>
Unable to attend the meeting, Chunghwa Post Chairman Lai Chin-chi
called Chunghwa Post President Wu Min-you to convene the meeting
at another location.
</P>
<P>
Labor union members burst into the meeting room and disrupted the
meeting, causing Wu to call the police in to maintain order.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Lai managed to escape from his office and attended the
meeting as the standoff came to an end and the police pulled back
from the scene.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting, Lai stressed that the change of the company's
name is actually a restoration with historical significance
because Taiwan's postal service was first named Taiwan Post
Administration when founded in 1888 by Liu Ming-chuan, the first
Governor of Taiwan appointed by the Ching Court
</P>
<P>
Union leader Tsai Liang-chuan argued that the union sees nothing
good about changing the name of the company in terms of
increasing its business, adding that it's regrettable that the
issue of changing the names of state enterprises is being used
for political purposes.
</P>
<P>
Tsai claimed that the name change will probably make Chunghwa
Post a fully privatized company overnight without the workers'
interests being protected.
</P>
<P>
Tsai also lambasted Chunghwa Post Chairman Lai for initiating the
name change drive and implementing the plan without consulting
anybody or notifying any of the company's workers in advance.
</P>
<P>
Chunghwa Post Co. said it was planning to change its name Friday
to show its Taiwan identity in a wave of name changes among state
enterprises.
</P>
<P>
The word "Chunghwa" means China. A new Chinese name translated as
"Taiwan Post Co." will be applied after Friday's board meeting
passes the proposal, although an official English name has yet to
be decided upon, company officials said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Lai said a new signboard with the new name will be in place as
soon as Monday.
