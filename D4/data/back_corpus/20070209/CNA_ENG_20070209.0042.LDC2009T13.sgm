Taiwanese prefer traveling in the Asia-Pacific area, for 60
percent of a total NT$52 billion (US$1.57 billion) in Taiwanese
spending in 2006 transactions was spent outside the country in
this area, a Visa International spokesman said Friday.

Visa Taiwan Managing Director Marco Ma pointed out that of the
top five destinations for Taiwanese travelers, four are in the
Asia-Pacific: America, China, Hong Kong and Japan; only fifth-
place England is outside the region.

Some 44 percent of transactions went to purchases of retail
products, after which came housing, transportation, professional
services, sports, and food and drinks. The average single
transaction amounted to NT$5,700.

Ma said that highest-value single transactions were made in Italy
(NT$113,600) , Macau (NT$10,780) , and France (NT$10,730) . Most
transactions  in Italy and France are conducted  in retailing
boutiques, while most transactions in Macau focused on sports and
recreation.

Visa International has designed special traveling programs for
the growing high- consumption group of Visa Infinite and Platinum
Card holders, a group whose transactions accounted for 66 percent
of the overall total of NT$ 52 billion.
