Some 70 percent of perms on the market in Taipei do not meet
labeling requirements when spot-checked by the Consumer
Protection Commission (CPC) under the Executive Yuan and the
Department of Health (DOH), a CPC spokesman said Friday.
</P>
<P>
At the CPC's request, the DOH asked the Taipei City and Taipei
County health bureaus to examine samples at salons and stores
selling hairdressing materials. The DOH found that while the
labels for 14 out of 20 samples did not meet regulatory
requirements, samples taken gave no reason for quality-related
concerns.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that pharmaceutical perms should follow
regulations and be labeled correctly to provide important
information regarding ingredients, expiration dates and notices
relevant to the health and safety of consumers.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman reminded consumers to check the DOH's Website to
verify the authenticity of product licenses, purchase only
properly labeled perm products, and cease using any product that
causes problems.
