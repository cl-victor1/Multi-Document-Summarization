SUHUA HIGHWAY AT RISK OF `BECOMING DANGEROUS': OFFICIAL
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  Feb. 9 (CNA) 02/09/07  17:52:06 (By Lilian Wu)

The Suhua highway linking Suao and Hualien in eastern Taiwan has
become a "dangerous" highway that requires costly maintenance, an
Executive Yuan official in charge of public construction works
said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Wu Tze-cheng, chairman of the Public Construction Commission
under the Executive Yuan, said the road, which was built
alongside steep cliffs, has been eroded by the sea and that it
experiences subsidence and rockfalls whenever there is heavy
rain.
</P>
<P>
The highway is dangerous, requires constant maintenance and could
"even disappear someday," Wu claimed.
</P>
<P>
Premier Su Tseng-chang claimed in Hualien early this year that
"Hualien residents harbor high expectations" that a Suhua freeway
will be built and said that as soon as the project has an
environmental difference analysis report ready that will
reinforce an earlier environmental impact assessment,
construction can start.
</P>
<P>
An environmental impact assessment on the proposed freeway did
pass several years ago, but construction failed to start in the
stipulated time because of continued controversy surrounding its
construction.
</P>
<P>
Wu said that after the Chinese New Year holiday it will become
clear whether the freeway will be built.
</P>
<P>
In any case, out of safety considerations as well as the
establishment of an islandwide traffic network, another highway
linking Suao and Hualien should be built, he said.
</P>
<P>
Faced with the pros and cons of its construction, Wu said the
government should provide more information in a transparent way
for the public to make its judgment, including the safety of the
present highway, annual maintenance costs, as well as the impact
on the environment after its completion.
