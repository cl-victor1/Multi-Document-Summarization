Minister  of  Transportation  and Communications Tsai Duei urged
domestic entrepreneurs Thursday to develop land near high-speed
rail stations, as the development efforts are sure to be
profitable.
</P>
<P>
Tsai made the call as he delivered a speech on the prospects of
Taiwan's transportation development, at the invitation of the
National Association of Industry and Commerce. Also present was
association President Theodore Huang.

<P>
Entrepreneurs could help develop land near stations on the
country's first high- speed railway that was inaugurated Jan. 5,
under the build, operate, transfer model that would allow them to
make huge profits, according to Tsai.

<P>
Huang echoed Tsai's remarks, saying that entrepreneurs could
follow America's and Japan's successful examples by building
hotels and department stores in the stations for tourists and
shoppers.
