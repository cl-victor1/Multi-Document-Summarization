Geneva,  Feb.  8 (CNA) 02/09/07  13:06:51 (By Neil Lu and Deborah

Since Taiwan is not a member of the International Criminal Police
Organization (Interpol) , the largest worldwide body established
to assist international criminal police cooperation, Taiwan can
only rely on bilateral judicial cooperation pacts for
apprehending criminals who have fled the country.
</P>
<P>
An Interpol spokesman said during a telephone interview with the
CNA that the fact that Taiwan cannot seek Interpol assistance to
extradite fugitive Rebar Asia Pacific Group founder Wang You-
theng from overseas epitomizes the difficulties that Taiwan has
faced in trying to apprehend criminals on the lam.
</P>
<P>
Interpol is the world's third largest international organization,
after the United Nations and FIFA, with 186 member countries and
an annual contributions of about US$41.7 million from its member
countries. The Lyon, France- headquartered organization's work
focuses primarily on public safety, terrorism, organized crime,
war crimes, illicit drug production,  drug trafficking, weapons
smuggling, trafficking in human beings, money laundering, child
pornography, white-collar crime, high-tech crime and corruption.

<P>
Wang, who was taken into custody by U.S. immigration authorities
at the beginning of February for traveling without valid travel
documents, was put on Taiwan's list of most wanted fugitives
after fleeing the country with his wife in early January.
</P>
<P>
The tycoon is wanted by Taiwanese authorities for his suspected
involvement in a series of crimes, including forgery, fraud,
insider trading, and embezzlement of corporate funds from his
group.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. government has been asked by Taiwan law enforcement
authorities to help extradite the Wangs as the two countries
maintain a judicial cooperation pact.
</P>
<P>
Fifty-one people related to the Rebar scandal have been probed as
suspects, 13 of whom have been detained. The number of people
related to the case barred from leaving the country has increased
to 91.
