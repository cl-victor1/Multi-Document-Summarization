China Airlines (CAL), Taiwan's largest carrier, will donate money
from the sale of duty free products to World Vision Taiwan (WVT)
to help poor children, CAL President Philip Wei said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
CAL will donate NT$20 from the sale of each duty free product on
flights from March 1, 2007-Feb. 29, 2008. The donated funds will
be used to improve the basic needs of poor kids, including their
living environments, education, medical treatment, and housing.
</P>
<P>
WVT President Tu Ming-han said over one billion kids in the world
live below absolute poverty line-- a condition defined by the
severe deprivation of basic human needs. Nearly 10 million kids
will not live to age five, while approximately 73 million
children under the age of 10 spend their days as laborers. Tu
hopes that people will demonstrate their care for the world's
poor children.

<P>
Wei said China Airlines has invited S.H.E.--a Taiwanese pop music
group--to advocate for this activity by visiting poor kids in
Calcutta slums in India with him March 13-17.
</P>
<P>
CAL spent half a year explaining the program to bring its local
and foreign partner companies on board. Half of the donated NT$20
from selling one product will come from China Airlines' partner
companies. China Airlines hopes its passengers will also support
this effort to improve the lives of poor children.
