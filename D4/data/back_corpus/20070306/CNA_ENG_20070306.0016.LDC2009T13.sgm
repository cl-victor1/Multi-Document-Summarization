PRESIDENT'S LATEST REMARKS COULD RAISE U.S. IRE: SCHOLAR

Washington,  March  5 (CNA) 03/06/07  16:23:43 (By Jorge Liu and

<P>
President Chen Shui-bian's latest pro-independence remarks could
anger Washington, a U.S. expert on cross-Taiwan Strait relations
said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Alan Romberg, director of East Asia Program of the Henry L.
Stimson Center, made the remarks in an interview with the CNA.
</P>
<P>
"Whatever the U.S. government chooses formally to address his
remarks, this cannot help diminishing even further the level of
trust that Washington has in Mr. Chen," he said.
</P>
<P>
On President Chen's remarks to a pro-independence group Sunday
that Taiwan must seek independence, must ratify its official
name, must craft a new constitution and must seek further
development, Romberg said that the statement "is consistent in
important respects with his long-standing insistence that Taiwan
is a sovereign, independent state separate from the People's
Republic of China, and that the Constitution should be changed to
reflect present-day realities."
</P>
<P>
But "there are some significant differences from Mr. Chen's past
positions  that will likely  cause significant  irritation  in
Washington," Romberg said.
</P>
<P>
The president's latest remarks are not in direct violation of his
"four noes" pledge, but advocacy of these positions is a
violation of his pledges to maintain the status quo and to
promote peace and stability and is at direct odds with America's
national interests, he said.
</P>
<P>
Romberg also said that Chen's statement is not an "action plan, "
and one should not over-read the practical significance of his
remarks. "It is no more realistic now than before to expect he
can bring about the changes he calls for, nor is it clear whether
he actively plans to seek most of these measures in the remaining
year of his term," he said.
