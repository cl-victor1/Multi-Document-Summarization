PANEL OF JUDGES TO HANDLE FORMER MAYOR'S CORRUPTION CASE
DETERMINED
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taipei,  March 6 (CNA) 03/06/07  20:14:43 (By Lilian Wu)
</P>
<P>
The three-member panel of judges that will sit for the trial of
former Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou on corruption charges was
determined Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Taipei District Court spokesman Liu Shou-sung said that as a
result of the drawing of lots, Wu Ting-ya will serve as the
commissioned judge, while Tsai Shou-hsun will serve as the
presiding judge and Hsu Chien-hui the associate judge.
</P>
<P>
Much to his surprise, Liu said, the composition of the judge
panel for Ma's case is identical with that of the panel handling
the trial of first lady Wu Shu-jen in the "state affairs fund"
case. The only difference is that Wu Ting-ya will serve as the
commissioned judge with Hsu Chien-hui serving as the associate
judge in the Ma case. Wu Ting-ya serves as the associate judge
and Hsu serves as the commissioned judge in the "state affairs
fund" trial.
</P>
<P>
The court usually assigns cases to commissioned judges via
computer, but in view of the high-profile nature of this case,
the district court decided to hold a manual open drawing of lots
to select the judges.
</P>
<P>
Liu noted that a total of 41 judges are qualified to serve on the
trial for Ma, former chairman of the main opposition Kuomintang.
</P>
<P>
The chance of choosing an identical three-member panel to that on
the "state- affairs fund, " which was opened on Dec. 15, 2006, is
actually "slim, " said Liu, who expressed "great surprises" at
the outcome.
</P>
<P>
Tsai, who also serves as the presiding judge in the "state
affairs fund," has served as a judge since 1996. Hsu, who has
served as a judge for the past five years. Wu has served as a
judge since 1999.
</P>
<P>
The prosecution charged the first couple last November with using
712 receipts provided by members of the first family and other
individuals to illegally claim reimbursements totaling NT$14.8
(US$450,000) million from the president's discretionary "state
affairs fund" between 2002 and 2006.
</P>
<P>
The first lady was indicted on corruption and forgery charges,
while Chen himself is immune from prosecution while in office,
but prosecutors have claimed that there is sufficient evidence to
pursue similar charges against him. The president has maintained
his innocence.
</P>
<P>
Ma was indicted Feb. 13 on charges of embezzling from a special
allowance fund designated for his discretionary use while he
served as Taipei mayor from 1998 to 2006.
</P>
<P>
The anti-corruption  center  under  the Taiwan  High Court
Prosecutor's Office formally indicted Ma Ying-jeou on charges
that he embezzled NT$11.17 million from the mayoral special
allowance during his two mayoral terms.
</P>
<P>
Prosecutor Hou Kuan-jen said in the indictment that Ma received
NT$10.23 million in special allowances during his first term
December 1998-December 2003.
</P>
<P>
However, expenditure records from Ma's bank accounts show that he
spent only NT$3.49 million of that amount and failed to return
the unspent portion -- NT$6.74 million -- to the national
coffers, Hou continued.
</P>
<P>
From January 2004 through July 2006, Ma used NT$630,000 of the
NT$5.06 million fund and kept the remaining NT$4.43 million in
his account.
</P>
<P>
Hou contends that the unspent money during his two terms,
totaling  NT$11.7 million,  should  be considered  "gain from
embezzlement."
</P>
<P>
Hou rejected an interpretation by the Ministry of Justice last
November that special allowance funds for executives of
government departments are actually meant as salary subsidies.
</P>
<P>
"The view raised by the Ministry of Justice alone is not shared
by others and contradicts the rules and regulations set by the
Cabinet and the Ministry of Finance governing the use of special
allowance funds," Hou said.
</P>
<P>
Although taking note of the fact that Ma and his wife donated
tens of millions of dollars to charitable organizations during
his mayoral terms, Hou argued that those donations came mostly
from Ma's unspent election campaign funds rather from his special
allowance funds.
