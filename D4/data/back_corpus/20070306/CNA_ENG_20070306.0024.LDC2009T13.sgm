Taipei,  March 6 (CNA) 03/06/07  17:44:13 (By Lilian Wu)

<P>
Former Premier Frank Hsieh said Tuesday that joining the United
Nations under the name of Taiwan is a long-term goal and wish of
Taiwanese people in their pursuit of national dignity.
</P>
<P>
Hsieh, a strong contender to represent the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) in the 2008 presidential election, also
said that the time is now ripe for putting the issue to a
referendum in order to help forge a national consensus.
</P>
<P>
He noted that DPP Legislator Trong Chai proposed, in a recent
meeting of DPP Central Standing Committee, that a referendum be
held to decide whether to join the United Nations under the name
of Taiwan. All four DPP presidential aspirants, including Vice
President Annette Lu, Premier Su Tseng-chang, DPP Chairman Yu
Shyi-kun and Hsieh himself, endorsed the proposal then.
</P>
<P>
Chai called a news conference Tuesday during which he said that
Hsieh had telephoned him during the recent Chinese New Year
holiday to suggest that he again propose the matter in the DPP
Central Standing Committee meeting.
</P>
<P>
Chai noted that the DPP will have to amass 830,000 signatures to
put the proposal to a national referendum in tandem with the
year-end legislative elections or March 2008 presidential
election, inviting all to work toward the goal.
</P>
<P>
Hsieh noted that Taiwan's bid to join the United Nations will
involve international, Chinese, and Taiwanese solidarity factors,
which, he said, won't be "achieved in one or two years."
</P>
<P>
"But so long as we keep on in our efforts, then the international
community will come to know that there is a country called Taiwan
and that it wants to join the United Nations," he added.
