Bilateral trade between Taiwan and Denmark set a new record of
US$907.8 million in 2006 thanks to the signing of a double
taxation avoidance treaty between the two countries in August,
2005, according to Taiwan's representative to the North European
country.

Republic of China Representative to Denmark Frederic P.N. Chang
made the remarks while attending a Lunar New Year party in
Copenhagen Sunday to wish a group of Taiwanese expatriates
residing in the country a Happy Chinese New Year.

During the party, Chang touted Taiwan's economic success, saying
that the economy registered a 4.62 percent year-on-year growth
last year. It is expected that the inauguration of both the Peiyi
Expressway in 2006 and Taiwan's first high speed railway system
earlier this year will exert a favorable influence to the
country's future economic development.
