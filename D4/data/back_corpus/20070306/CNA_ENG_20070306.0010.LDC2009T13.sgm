The enactment of the Gender Equality in Employment Law five years
ago has contributed to the removal of barriers  to employment
for local  women  and increased  job opportunities for them, a
Council of Labor Affairs (CLA) official said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Quoting the results of a recent COA opinion poll on the law's
impact on the job market, the official said that up to 70 percent
of women respondents to the survey recognize the positive effect
of the gender equality law on employment opportunities for women.
</P>
<P>
According to CLA tallies, the number of employed women has
increased by 10.1 percent over the past five years, rising from
3.907 million in 2002 to 4.301 million in 2006. The figure was
higher than the 4.74 percent growth in the number of men employed
over the same five-year period.
</P>
<P>
The women's labor participation rate also saw an increase, from
46.59 percent in 2002 to 48.68 percent in 2006. In contrast, the
men's labor participation rate dropped 0.87 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
The CLA conducted a survey on employers in November 2006 and a
survey on female employees in January 2007 to explore whether
women have suffered inequality or discrimination in the
workplace. A total of 3,050 valid samples were collected in the
employers survey, while the survey of female employees received
3,074 valid replies. Both surveys have a margin of error of 1.79
percentage points.
</P>
<P>
According to the survey results, 70 percent of women employees
said they feel the workplace gender equality law has contributed
to the removal of employment barriers for women.
</P>
<P>
On the measures to promote workplace gender equality, 31.8
percent of employers or companies surveyed now provide paid
menstrual leave for female employees, up 13.7 percentage points
from 2002; 43.4 percent now offer a certain period of paid
miscarriage leave, up 1.8 percentage points from five year ago;
45.6 percent provide paternity leave, up 16.6 percentage points;
and 41.1 percent offer family care leave, up 7.1 percentage
points.
</P>
<P>
On sexual harassment prevention, 65.2 percent of companies with
30 or more employees have implemented relevant measures, channels
for filing complaints and penalties in accordance with provisions
of the Gender Equality in Employment Law, up 29.7 percentage
points from 2002.
</P>
<P>
On the prevention of sexual discrimination, only 16.1 percent of
companies still have gender-based differential pay scales and 5.5
percent still take gender into account in determining job
promotion.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, 9 percent of female employees interviewed said they
feel they have received unfair treatment in salary adjustment;
6.2 percent said they have suffered discrimination in job
assignment; and 5.3 percent said they have suffered unequal
treatment in terms of promotion.
</P>
<P>
According to the results of the female employees survey, 17
percent of those who were either pregnant or gave birth in 2006
said they have experienced discrimination or unequal treatment,
such as shortened maternity leave, a pay cut or verbal
discrimination.
</P>
<P>
Among companies with 250 or more employees, 41.7 percent have
either set up day care facilities or provided day care measures,
up 5.4 percent from 2002.
