Minister of Education Tu Cheng-Cheng said Tuesday that his
ministry will seek to complete drawing new school district
catchment boundaries  in one year to facilitate  the
implementation of the 12-year compulsory educational system in
2009.
</P>
<P>
Tu made the remarks while fielding questions from main opposition
Kuomintang Legislator Wu Yu-sheng during a question period at the
Legislative Yuan.
</P>
<P>
Wu said various education officials' opinions on how to promote
the 12-year educational system have been inconsistent since the
new system was unveiled by Premier Su Tseng-changa, especially on
the lack of supplementary measures required for defining the
boundaries of school districts.
</P>
<P>
In response, Tu said that the government has set up an office in
charge promoting the 12-year compulsory educational system and
has drafted 12 projects and 22 schemes, which he said are being
separately implemented.
</P>
<P>
Touching on defining the boundaries of new school districts, Tu
admitted that it is a very delicate matter, but that the Ministry
of Education will do its utmost to finalize relevant plans in one
year.
</P>
<P>
He further said that since the premier announced that the new
educational system will not come into effect until 2009, junior
high school students who will graduate prior to July 2009, or
current first, second and third graders, will still be required
to take part in the basic competence test.
</P>
<P>
The premier announced his decision last Tuesday to extend the
compulsory educational system from current nine years to 12
beginning 2009.
