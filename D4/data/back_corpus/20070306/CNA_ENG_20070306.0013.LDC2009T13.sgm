Taipei,  March  6 (CNA) 03/06/07  15:26:56 (By Elizabeth Hsu)

Vice President Annette Lu registered Tuesday for the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party's (DPP's) primary for the 2008
presidential election, becoming the first presidential aspirant
in the party to do so.
</P>
<P>
At the DPP headquarters, Lu presented the registration fee of
NT$6 million (US$182,300) as well as NT$1 million to cover the
cost of polls during the registration process. She then
cheerfully shook hands with those present and answered questions
from reporters.
</P>
<P>
Lu told reporters that she informed her boss, President Chen
Shui-bian, of her decision to join the race the previous day.
Asked whether she asked Chen for tips on how to win the election,
Lu said she did not because everybody in the party expects the
president to play the role of a fair and just 'coordinator' in
the party's efforts to select its presidential candidate.
</P>
<P>
Prior to registering, Lu announced her decision at the Grand
Hotel, saying that she is doing so in order to have the chance of
completing President Chen's work of promoting the "normalization
of the country."
</P>
<P>
In the statement, Lu also stated that it is time for Taiwan and
China to end their long conflict, pointing out that the two sides
"are not only neighbors but also relatives." She suggested that
the two sides work to promote "constructive engagement" based on
the principles of 3C -- co-existence, co-operation and co-
prosperity.
</P>
<P>
Lu said that since the DPP defeated the Kuomintang (KMT) in the
2000 presidential election to end the KMT's reign of nearly five
decades, she and Chen have spared no efforts to promote the
country's normalization.
</P>
<P>
"However, it is difficult to achieve such a historic task in
eight years," Lu said, noting that the cause needs more time and
that this is why she is seeking the presidency.
</P>
<P>
The DPP on Monday began its registration for the presidential
primary which will be held May 6.
</P>
<P>
According to DPP officials, Premier Su Tseng-chang, DPP Chairman
Yu Shyi-kun and former Premier Frank Hsieh have all decided to
register for the primary March 8.
</P>
<P>
Under a DPP timetable for the primary, party members will vote on
presidential hopefuls May 6, after which a series of public
opinion polls will be held May 7-28.
</P>
<P>
The votes of party members are weighted to comprise 30 percent of
a hopeful's score, while the public opinion polls counting for 70
percent. The presidential aspirant who receives the highest
approval rating will be named the party's presidential candidate
May 30.
