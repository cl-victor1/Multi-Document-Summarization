CHINA'S INCREASED MILITARY BUDGET THREATENS REGIONAL PEACE:
OFFICIAL

Taipei,  March 6 (CNA) 03/06/07  17:17:09 (By Luis Huang)

<P>
China's increasing military spending poses a great threat to
regional peace and stability, Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA)
spokesman Wang Chien-yeh said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Wang made the remarks after China's National People's Congress
spokesman Jiang Enzhu announced recently that Beijing's defense
budget for 2007 will increase by 17.8 percent over the year-
earlier level.
</P>
<P>
The US$45 billion increase in China's annual military budget is a
historic high, triggering concerns in the international
community, Wang said during a routine press briefing.
</P>
<P>
The reason why the international community has focused on China's
military spending is mainly due to the long-term lack of
transparency in its military buildup, Wang said.
</P>
<P>
He further said that although Beijing has repeatedly hailed
China's modernization as a "peaceful rise, " the large increase
in its defense spending and the lack of transparency go against
Beijing's claims of aiming at promoting a "peaceful society, " a
"peaceful world" and "peaceful development."
</P>
<P>
In addition to delivering on its promises, China should seek to
make its military modernization more transparent and give the
international community a reasonable explanation for the
substantial hike in its 2007 defense budget, Wang continued.
</P>
<P>
Wang also cited a recent report issued by Amnesty International,
an organization working to protect human rights worldwide, as
saying that China has continued to export weapons to several
civil war-ridden countries, such as Sudan, Myanmar and Nepal, and
that these weapons are used to oppress citizens in those
countries.
