CONSCIOUSNESS

Taipei,   March  6  (CNA) 03/06/07  13:24:01 (By Lilian Wu)

President Chen Shui-bian's  latest pro-independence remarks do
not go against his earlier pledges and are intended to express
his concern for Taiwan-centric consciousness, the Ministry of
Foreign Affairs (MOFA) said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
MOFA spokesman Wang Chien-yeh also said that Taiwan and the
United States have a consensus on maintaining peace in the Taiwan
Strait. Taiwan has repeatedly stressed that it has no intention
of changing the status quo in the Taiwan Strait, he added.
</P>
<P>
Wang was responding to remarks made the day before by U.S. State
Department spokesman Sean McCormack who called any comments
supporting Taiwan independence "unhelpful" and noted that the
United States expects President Chen to uphold the pledges he
made in his 2000 inaugural speech.
</P>
<P>
"The United States does not support independence for Taiwan, "
McCormack  said, adding  that "President  Bush has repeatedly
underscored his opposition to unilateral changes to the status
quo by either Taipei or Beijing because these threaten regional
peace and stability, U.S. national interest and Taiwan's own
welfare."
</P>
<P>
Wang said that "Taiwan understands the United States' concerns."
</P>
<P>
The president's remarks Sunday to a pro-independence group in
which he said that Taiwan must seek independence, must rectify
its name, must craft a new constitution and must seek further
development are things that he has explained on public occasions
before, Wang said.
</P>
<P>
"These remarks reflect his consistent concern for Taiwan-centric
consciousness, with the intention of giving a clearer description
of Taiwan-centric consciousness," Wang said.
</P>
<P>
Wang further said that President Chen's latest remarks do not go
against his "four noes" pledge made in his 2000 inaugural speech
that as long as China has no intention of using force against
Taiwan, he will not declare independence, not change the island's
official name, not include special state-to-state cross- strait
relations into Constitution and not hold a referendum on the
independence versus unification issue.
