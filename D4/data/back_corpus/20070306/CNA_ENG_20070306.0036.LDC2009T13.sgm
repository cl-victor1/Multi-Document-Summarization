Taiyen Biotech Co. will sponsor another White Ocean Music
Festival in Tainan County's Chiku township in July to allow
independent song writers and music composers to present their
works, Taiyen Chairman Lin Ching said Tuesday.

<P>
Lin said that following up on the company's success last year in
sponsoring a music festival at the Salt Hills in Chiku township,
Taiyen is prepared to support another music festival of a even
larger scale this year.
</P>
<P>
The date of the festival has not been finalized yet, Lin said,
adding that Taiyen plans to schedule the event for the same date
as the Gungliao Ho-Yai-Yan Rock Festival in Taipei County "just
to show the world that there are good independent musicians in
southern Taiwan too."
</P>
<P>
Noting that last year's music festival cost only several million
New Taiwan dollars, Lin said the spending was worthwhile. He
added that Taiyen will spend more this year to make the music
festival a larger-scale event than the Gungliao Rock Festival.
