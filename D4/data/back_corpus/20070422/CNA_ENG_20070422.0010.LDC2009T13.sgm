MAC CLARIFIES STANCE ON OLYMPIC TORCH RELAY
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

Taipei,  April  22  (CNA) 04/22/07  17:26:09 (By Deborah Kuo)

The Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) spokesman reiterated Saturday
the council's stance on the 2008 Olympic torch relay and denied
having said that the torch, if were to pass through Taiwan,
should "arrive" and "depart" from different locations.
</P>
<P>
In a statement carried on the British Broadcasting Corp's (BBC)
Chinese-language website Saturday, Liu Te-hsun said he did not
say during a news conference held April 20 that the Olympic torch
relay must pass one place beyond Hong Kong or Macau to enter
Taiwan and depart from Taiwan via another place also other than
Hong Kong and Macau.
</P>
<P>
Liu said in the BBC online report that he was recently
"misquoted" by a Chinese website, which claimed that Liu had
spelled out "four major conditions" for the 2008 Olympic torch
passing through Taiwan, including that the torch shall not pass
through Hong Kong or Macau on its way to and from Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Liu said he made known at last Friday's news conference the four
"requests" of the MAC regarding the notion about the 2008 Olympic
torch relay passing through Taiwan, and adding that the four
"requests" were just requests and they should not be interpreted
as "conditions."
</P>
<P>
He reiterated the four requests: the torch must be handled
following the protocol of the International Olympic Committee;
China must seek Taiwan's permission to have the 2008 Olympic
torch relay pass through Taiwan; China must guarantee that
Taiwan's sovereignty will not be belittled or compromised; and
the torch relay event should be a move conducive to constructive
interactions between Taiwan and China.
</P>
<P>
Explaining the third request, that Taiwan's sovereignty not be
belittled or compromised, Liu said that Taiwan belongs to the
International Olympic Committee as an independent sports entity
and has for years taken part in Olympic competitions under the
title of "Chinese Taipei."
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, he argued, China has stubbornly insisted on calling
Taiwan "China Taipei" -- a title that is unacceptable to Taiwan
and its athletes.
</P>
<P>
Liu called for China to once again to address Taiwan with the
title that has been traditionally used by the IOC.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Liu stressed that as a full IOC member, Taiwan would
be proud to be part of the 2008 Olympic torch relay and will
cooperate with the IOC in this regard in accordance with IOC
traditions and formalities.
</P>
<P>
President Chen Shui-bian's Chief of Staff Chiou I-jen expressed
April 17 that Taiwan will definitely not accept a plan that the
2008 Olympic torch relay pass through Hong Kong or Xiamen in
Fujian Province on its way to and from Taiwan, saying that the
plan would belittle Taiwan by implying that it is a province of
China.
</P>
<P>
Chiou added, nevertheless, that it would be acceptable to Taiwan
if the torch passes a third country before it reaches Taiwan,
including Taiwan in an international route, instead of a
"domestic" route.
</P>
<P>
The IOC is in the midst of a 10-day meeting in Beijing, which
began April 16, and the torch relay matter is expected to be one
of the hottest issues under discussion.
</P>
<P>
The 2008 Olympic Games are scheduled to be held in Beijing Aug.
8-24.
