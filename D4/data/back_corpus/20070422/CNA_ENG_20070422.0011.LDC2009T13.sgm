PFP RESERVED ABOUT ADVANCING COOPERATION WITH KMT
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

Taipei, April 22 (CNA) 04/22/07  18:27:43 (By Flor Wang)
</P>
<P>
The People First Party (PFP) was low keyed Sunday about an
agreement reached late last week with the main opposition
Kuomintang  (KMT)  regarding cooperation  in coming elections,
but called for bilateral talks on the issue as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
Chang Hsien-yao, a PFP lawmaker and director of the party's
central policy center, opined that the two parties should first
discuss how to coordinate on regional-seat candidacies in
December's legislative election two weeks before holding
negotiations on further cooperation or a merger -- as was laid
out in a pledge that he inked with KMT Secretary-General Wu Duen-
yih last Friday.
</P>
<P>
PFP lawmaker Daniel Hwang Yih-jiau, who also serves as executive
director of the party's central policy center, said that the PFP
will not rule out the possibility of stepping up cooperation in
any form or merging with the KMT.
</P>
<P>
"No terms or conditions have been fixed or settled with regard to
future collaboration between the two parties, " Hwang said and
called for two-way talks on the issue as quickly as possible so
as to lay a solid foundation for victory in December's
legislative election and the 2008 presidential election.
</P>
<P>
However, both Chang and Hwang were reserved about whether or not
all the PFP lawmakers will definitely take part in the next
Procedure Committee Tuesday to help the KMT block two draft bills
of major concern to it as last Friday.
</P>
<P>
PFP lawmaker Liu Wen-hsiung, who has registered to take part in
the May 12 by- election for Keelung mayor, urged the KMT to
display greater sincerity on bilateral negotiations, ranging from
the Keelung mayoral by-election to the year-end legislative
election.
</P>
<P>
"Trying to do away with the PFP will do no good to the KMT, "Liu
warned.
</P>
<P>
PFP lawmakers and their peers from the Non-Partisan Solidarity
Union attended Friday's committee meeting to help kill the two
bills, after Chang and Wu signed the agreement earlier that day,
crushing efforts by the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)
and its ally, the Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU), to ram through
the two bills for a second reading.
</P>
<P>
The first bill, initiated by the DPP, is widely believed to take
aim at former KMT Chairman Ma Ying-jeou, who continues to pursue
his presidential bid despite corruption charges against him. The
bill would ban individuals convicted in the first trial from
running in presidential elections, while the second proposed by
the TSU seeks to force the KMT return its "ill-gotten" assets to
the nation's coffers.
</P>
<P>
Ten PFP lawmakers showed up in the Friday Procedure Committee
meeting and cast "no" votes against the two bills after Chang and
Wu signed a 7-point pledge early that same day, agreeing to
jointly field the most electable candidates  in December's
legislative elections, based on a framework established by the
two parties on Jan. 22, when they decided to create a closer
alliance to reinforce collaboration.
</P>
<P>
According  to PFP sources,  the KMT agreed to allot five
constituencies for the PFP to manage in the coming legislative
election, while negotiations on cooperation in the rest of the
constituencies must be wrapped up within two weeks.
</P>
<P>
Although the signing of the pledge has temporarily defused
tensions between the two parties with regard to the legislative
election, observers said that it will take more time to judge
whether the two parties have effectively come to a cease fire.
</P>
<P>
It is extremely difficult to forge across-the-board collaboration
between the two parties due to a lack of mutual trust and a
conflict of partisan interests, observers said.
</P>
<P>
According to KMT sources, the eventual goal of the KMT is to
secure a majority of the legislature so as to secure Ma's win in
the 2008 presidential race, while the PFP is focusing its efforts
on bailing out the political careers of PFP lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
The signing of the 7-point pledge just marked the very beginning
of afierce challenge for both parties, the KMT source said.
