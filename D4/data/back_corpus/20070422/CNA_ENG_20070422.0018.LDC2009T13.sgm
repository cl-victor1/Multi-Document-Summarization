In line with an international "Spank Out Day" April 30, the
Humanistic Education Foundation announced Sunday that it will
mark the day April 29 in Taiwan by organizing activities in
Taipei, Taichung and Kaohsiung.
</P>
<P>
According to foundation officials, street parades and garden
fairs will be held in the three major Taiwan cities on the same
day to observe the international movement launched by the Center
for Effective Discipline with an aim of raising awareness among
Taiwanese parents that corporal punishments are not the only way
to discipline children.
</P>
<P>
Foundation officials expressed hope that Taiwanese parents will
find ways to teach and educate their children without physical
punishment after attending their activities which suggest local
parents get along with their kids through a wide range of games
helpful in improving their interactions.
