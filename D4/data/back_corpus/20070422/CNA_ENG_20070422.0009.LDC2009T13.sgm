Former South African Anglican Archbishop Desmond Tutu and his
wife Leah Nomalizo Tutu were greatly impressed by the gorgeous
bead decorations displayed by aboriginal Paiwan people during a
visit to the tribe in Sandimen township in the southernmost
county of Pingtung.
</P>
<P>
Tutu, winner of the Nobel Peace Prize in 1984, accompanied by his
wife, headed to Sandimen Saturday for an introduction to
aboriginal Paiwan culture after concluding a tour of Meinung
Township in Kaohsiung County earlier the same day.
</P>
<P>
The couple called on a workshop to experience the art of glass
bead making and take a close look at various glass bead exhibits.
</P>
<P>
During their stay, workshop chief Shih Hsiu-chu briefed the
visitors on the significance of glass beads in Paiwan tribal
culture, while the couple also expressed their admiration for the
tribal people's achievements integrating traditional aboriginal
culture into the modern economy and even reaching markets
overseas.
</P>
<P>
Tutu and his wife were so pleased by the splendid glass beads
that they purchased several pieces of glass bead necklaces and
bangles at the store.
</P>
<P>
In a goodwill gesture, Tutu presented a Swaziland necklace to
Shih as a souvenir, while Shih also offered a glass bead necklace
in return.
</P>
<P>
Tutu said that he has greatly enjoyed his current visit to Taiwan
and feels that the Taiwanese are very nice, but as he is old and
tired he has to cancel a trip to Wanchin Catholic Church in
Pintung County scheduled for later that day.
