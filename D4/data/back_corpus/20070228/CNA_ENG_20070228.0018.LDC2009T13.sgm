U.S. SCHOLARS DISCUSS 228 INCIDENT
</HEADLINE>

Washington,  Feb. 28 (CNA) 02/28/07  17:17:53 (By Chiehyu Lin

<P>
Two U.S. scholars said on the eve of the 228 Incident of 1947
that historical evolution has transformed Taiwan into a
completely democratic country.
</P>
<P>
James Mann, a scholar at Johns Hopkins University, and John J.
Tkacik Jr., a senior research fellow in Asian studies at the
Washington D.C.-headquartered Heritage Foundation, were invited
by Taiwan media Tuesday to comment on the tragic incident.
</P>
<P>
Mann, who has served as the Los Angeles Times Beijing bureau
chief,  said democracy has developed  in completely  different
directions on the two sides of the Taiwan Strait.
</P>
<P>
There has been a flourishing democratic movement in Taiwan since
the 228 Incident, which saw the brutal crushing of local people
by the then-Kuomintang government, Mann said.
</P>
<P>
In contrast, he said democratic development in China remains a
"mirage" even though the country has managed to achieve a boom in
economic development since Beijing's brutal military suppression
of democracy advocates during protests in Tiananmen Square in
1989.
</P>
<P>
Tkacik said it is understandable that Taiwan's present Democratic
Progressive Party government has been working to eliminate all
facilities and symbols that mark the image of late President
Chiang Kai-shek as a great man, while accusing him of being
responsible for the 228 Incident that caused the deaths of
thousands of Taiwanese.
</P>
<P>
He said the movement to eradicate  Chiang's  memory is a
declaration that Taiwan is totally different from the Taiwan of
the Chiang regime and described the 228 Incident as a terrible
moment in history.
</P>
<P>
When reviewing history, the government should answer calls for a
complete revelation of the truth behind the tragedy, the scholar
suggested.
</P>
<P>
The 228 Incident refers to an uprising against the Chiang-led
Kuomintang administration that began Feb. 28, 1947 and was
followed by a bloody crackdown that resulted in the death of tens
of thousands of civilians.
</P>
<P>
A so-called "White Terror" ensued, which involved the suppression
of political dissent and of public discussion of the massacre.
