KMT SHOULD ADMIT MISTAKE OVER 228 INCIDENT: PREMIER
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taipei, Feb. 28 (CNA) 02/28/07  18:25:38 (By Sofia Wu)
</P>
<P>
The main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) should eat humble pie, admit
its mistake over the 228 Incident and hand over all relevant
archives to the government, Premier Su Tseng-chang said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a plaque-unveiling ceremony for the National 228
Incident Memorial Hall, Su said the families of the victims yearn
to learn the historical facts about the tragic event.
</P>
<P>
Claiming that only a complete revelation of the truth behind the
tragedy can comfort the souls of the victims, Su said the KMT
should turn over to the government all documents relating to the
incident kept at its party history hall.
</P>
<P>
The 228 Incident refers to uprising against the corrupt KMT
administration under the late President Chiang Kai-shek that
began Feb. 28, 1947 and was followed by a bloody crackdown
resulting in the deaths of tens of thousands of civilians.
</P>
<P>
The ensuing "White Terror" -- involving the suppression of
political dissent and of public discussion of the massacre -- was
conducted under martial law declared following the incident.
</P>
<P>
The 228 Incident remains a sensitive subject for millions of
Taiwanese -- particularly the older generation -- and a key
source of acrimony between the ruling Democratic Progressive
Party (DPP) and the KMT-led opposition.
</P>
<P>
Although former KMT Chairman Ma Ying-jeou, who is widely seen as
the KMT's best bet for victory in the 2008 presidential election,
has apologized for the 228 Incident on behalf of his party, Su
said he did not feel the party's sincere repentance.
</P>
<P>
"The KMT is saying one thing while doing another. For one thing,
the KMT still refuses to hand over its 228 Incident archives to
the government,  " Su said, adding that many important documents,
including those detailing how the then-KMT Taiwan chapter
contacted the KMT government in Nanjing and asked it to send
troops to Taiwan to crush the uprising.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Su went on, the KMT and its "pan-blue" ally, the People
First Party, have continued to block the passage of a bill
calling for people who committed atrocities during the 228
Incident to stand trial.
</P>
<P>
The bill is aimed at amending the Statute for Handling of and
Compensation for the 228 Incident, enacted in April 1995. The
statute details a series of steps to help the victims and their
families.
</P>
<P>
Dissatisfied with the statute because it focuses mainly on
compensation issues, the DPP proposed an amendment that is aimed
at determining legal responsibility for the incident and
replacing the word "compensation" with "indemnification" as well
as enacting a special law entitling 228 Incident victims to seek
indemnification from the people who injured them and demand that
those people face justice.
</P>
<P>
DPP lawmakers suggested Tuesday that the amendment bill be put on
the legislative agenda for discussion at Friday's plenary
session, but the proposal was voted down by the KMT-led "pan-blue
alliance, " which controls a slim majority in the legislature.
</P>
<P>
Su said that if the KMT truly repents its past mistakes as Ma has
claimed, it should return its billions of dollars-worth of ill-
gotten party assets amassed during its five decades of
authoritarian rule of Taiwan to use as compensation to the
families of the victims.
</P>
<P>
President Chen Shui-bian, Vice President Annette Lu and many
other govenrment officials and representatives of the families of
the 228 Incident victims also attended the ceremony, which also
marked the inauguration of an exhibition commemorating the 60th
anniversary of the tragic incident.
