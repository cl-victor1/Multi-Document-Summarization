PREMIER DEMANDS TRUTH FROM KMT ON 228 INCIDENT
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taipei,  Feb. 28 (CNA) 02/28/07  19:24:36 (By Flor Wang)

Premier Su Tseng-chang demanded Wednesday that the main
opposition Kuomintang (KMT) publish the truth behind the 228
Incident and compensate the families of the victims of the
tragedy with money from sale of its assets.
</P>
<P>
Su issued the demand at a central government-sponsored ceremony
at the 228 Memorial Park in downtown Taipei to mark the 60th
anniversary of the incident, in which thousands of Taiwan's elite
were massacred by KMT government troops controlled by the late
President Chiang Kai-shek.
</P>
<P>
President Chen Shui-bian, Vice President Annette Lu, Examination
Yuan President Yao Chia-wen, Taipei Mayor Hau Lung-bin and ruling
Democratic Progressive Party Chairman Yu Shyi-kun were also
present at the ceremony.
</P>
<P>
Insisting that nothing but the truth will allow reconciliation,
Su demanded that former KMT Chairman Ma Ying-jeou, the most
likely contender of the "pan-blue alliance" in the 2008
presidential election, apologize in public again for the massacre
and make the KMT unveil historic facts behind the incident.
</P>
<P>
Su denied that public demand for digging out the 228 Incident
truth is a politically motivated move, describing it instead as a
way of serving justice and helping younger generations learn from
history. He added that the KMT should compensate the families of
the victims with money earned from the sale of its ill-gotten
party assets, instead of having the government pay the
reparations.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Ma paid his respects to the 228 Incident victims at a
memorial monument at the 228 Memorial Park in Hsinying City in
southern Tainan County -- the home of President Chen Shui-bian.
</P>
<P>
Claiming that he is willing to bear the burden of the KMT's past,
Ma said that the historic tragedy can be forgiven but never
forgotten and that present-day Taiwan youth must keep this in
mind and do their best to prevent any recurrence.
