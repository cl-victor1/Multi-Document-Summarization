A delegation from China led by He Shizhong, director of the
Economic Bureau under the Taiwan Affairs Office of the State
Council, paid a visit Friday to the Taipei-based Chinese National
Federation of Industries (CNFI) and exchanged views with CNFI
Chairman Chen Wu-hsiung on various issues of mutual concern.

According to Chen, this is He's third visit to Taiwan with the
aim of boosting bilateral relations. The Chinese economic
official also led a delegation to Taiwan 10 years ago when Uni-
President Group Chairman Kao Chin-yen served as CNFI chairman,
Chen said.

During Friday's meeting, issues concerning Beijing's financing of
Taiwanese manufacturers, small- and medium-sized enterprise (SME)
development in China, as well as China's planned reforms, were
discussed, Chen said.

For his part, CNFI Secretary-General Wang Ya-kang said that He
and his delegation showed great interest in the various measures
adopted by the Taiwan government to help boost local SME
development, such as the establishment of a SME credit guarantee
fund and incubation centers.

As for the question of whether Beijing's tax reforms will lead to
the elimination  of preferential  tax treatment  to Taiwanese
manufacturers operating in China, Wang quoted Chinese tax
officials as saying there will be a grace period before the
Chinese authorities launch any tax reforms.

<P>
Later in the day, He and his delegation visited several business
groups such as Cathay Financial Holdings, Uni-President Group and
Formosa Plastics Group.

<P>
The delegation  members are mostly officials in charge of
screening investment by Taiwanese businessmen in China, including
economic officials, executives from the China Development Bank
and the People's Bank of China who are in charge of granting
loans to Taiwanese businessmen operating in China.

The delegation will also tour several of local economic and
cultural establishments before concluding their visit next week.
