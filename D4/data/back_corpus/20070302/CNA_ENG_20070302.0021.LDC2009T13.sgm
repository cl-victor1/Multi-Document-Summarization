The 2007 Taipei International Furniture Show will be held March
3-7 at the Taipei World Trade Center under the auspices of the
quasi-official Taiwan External Trade Development Council (TAITRA)
and the Taiwan Furniture Manufacturers' Association.
</P>
<P>
The annual trade show is expected to bring together 226 domestic
and foreign furniture and related equipment manufacturers  and
suppliers who will set up a total of 1,083 booths to exhibit
their products, according to the organizers.
</P>
<P>
Leading Taiwanese enterprises such as Aurora Group and CK Chair
Co., as well as international brand-name giants, including
U.S.-based Herman Miller and American Hardwood, and Germany-based
Grahl Working Well and Interstuhl, will take part in the
exhibition, the organizers said.
</P>
<P>
The five-day show is expected to attract over 16,000 visitors,
including 1,000 foreign buyers. TAITRA has also invited Japan-
based Okamura Co., whose annual turnover surpasses US$1.7
billion, to conduct procurement during the show.
</P>
<P>
Due to fierce competition  from China and Southeast Asian
countries, Taiwan's furniture exports amounted to only US$1.25
billion in 2006, while furniture imports totaled US$405 million,
according to a TAITRA official.
