The world-renowned Cloud Gate Dance Theater, directed by
Taiwanese choreographer Lin Hwai-min, will present four
performances at the Hong Kong Cultural Center, a spokesman for
the Leisure and Cultural Services Department of the Hong Kong
Special Administrative Region said Friday.

The spokesman said the performances will include five excerpts
from 1975-1998 performances such as Tale of the White Serpent and
Moon Water, and two from White X3 trilogy of 2006 and will run
from April 25-26 and April 28-29.

According to the spokesman, Lin kept exploring variations of
white for eight years after the first episode of White made its
successful debut in 1998. Lin created White 2 and White 3 in 2006
to express what was left unsaid in the first episode.

Established in 1973 by Lin, Cloud Gate became Taiwan's first
modern dance group and the first to come out of a Chinese-
speaking community. It has presented a rich repertoire of more
than 160 choreographies, blending its roots in folklore,
classical literature, Taiwan history and the avant garde.

Its performances have earned it a reputation as the top
contemporary dance group in Asia and one of the best modern dance
troupes in the world, the spokesman said.
