The Ministry of Education (MOE) has unveiled the framework of a
plan to implement a 12-year compulsory educational system in
2009, education officials said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The system, prolonged from nine years, is part of the
government's drive to increase national competitiveness.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the ministry announced a schedule for the new plan.
Between March and May, the ministry will consult with school
administration staff, experts and academics. Between June and
August, the ministry plans to hold public hearings on the matter,
the officials noted.
</P>
<P>
The major details of the plan are set to be finalized in
September, the officials went on, adding that the plan will be
submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval.
</P>
<P>
The officials said the ministry will decide on how students will
be admitted into senior high schools by the end of this year, an
issue that has also drawn widespread concern as there is talk of
scrapping the high school entrance exam in favor of a system of
neighborhood catchment areas.
