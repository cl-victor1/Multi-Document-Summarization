REVISED RULES FOR CHINESE TOUR GROUPS TAKE EFFECT
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  March 2 (CNA) 03/02/07  15:27:21 (By Sofia Wu)
</P>
<P>
A package of amendments to the existing regulations governing
entry of Chinese citizens for sightseeing purposes took effect
Friday to facilitate security management and upgrading of travel
service quality.
</P>
<P>
National Immigration Agency (NIA) officials said the amendments
have been drawn up in line with the government's "active
management, effective opening" policy toward trade and economic
relations across the Taiwan Strait.
</P>
<P>
Highlights of the revised rules include authorizing the Travel
Agent Association to determine the number of Chinese tour groups
each local agency can host. This new rule is expected to
facilitate prior screening of Chinese tourist identity, cut red
tape and promote standardization of travel agency operations, the
NIA officials said.
</P>
<P>
The amended rules raise the security deposit each travel agency
eligible to host Chinese tour groups has to pay to NT$2 million
(US$60,606) from the original NT$1 million. The increase is aimed
at imposing heavier security duties on tour operators, the
officials said, adding that travel agencies which have already
been allowed to host Chinese tour groups must pay the additional
NT$1 million security deposit within three months.
</P>
<P>
Under the updated rules, travel agencies will have NT$200,000
deducted from their security deposit for each Chinese tourist who
overstays his or her visa or absconds from the tour group after
entering Taiwan. If the Chinese tourist's legal infractions are
very serious, such as impairing Taiwan's national interests, the
host travel agency may have its business license revoked and see
a cut in the number of Chinese tour groups it can host.
Previously, travel agencies would only be required to stop
operations over Chinese tourists' overstaying visas or
absconding.
</P>
<P>
The revised regulations  also give clear provisions  on a self-
discipline convention to be signed by all travel agencies
intending to handle Chinese tour groups. Those who fail to sign
the convention will be deprived of the right to host Chinese tour
groups.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile,  the amended rules ease restrictions on Chinese
tourists intending to visit Taiwan's science-based industrial
parks.
</P>
<P>
The new rules require travel agencies to report to relevant
government agencies in the event of any changes to the itinerary
during a visit by a tour group in order to maintain travel
service quality and facilitate security management.
</P>
<P>
The amended regulations also simplify reporting procedures and
introduce new measures to prevent repetition of document
screening and  inspection,  the NIA officials  said,  adding
that  the implementation of the updated rules is part of the
preparations for the much-anticipated full opening to Chinese
tourists.
</P>
<P>
At present, only certain categories of Chinese citizens can come
to Taiwan for sightseeing, including those who have made pleasure
trips to a third nation.
</P>
<P>
Negotiations for ordinary Chinese citizens to come to Taiwan
directly for sightseeing purposes are still ongoing. The two
sides have reached consensus on almost all major technical
details and may come to terms on certain key points in the near
future, government sources said last week.
