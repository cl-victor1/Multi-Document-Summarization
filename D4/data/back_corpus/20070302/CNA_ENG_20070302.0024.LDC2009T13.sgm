PRESIDENT URGES CHINA STEEL TO CHANGE ITS NAME

President Chen Shui-bian has prodded China Steel Corp. to follow
the examples of several state-owned enterprises to remove "China"
and add "Taiwan" to its official name.
</P>
<P>
The president told China Steel Corp. Chairman Chiang Yao-tsung
Thursday that if other state-owned enterprises can change their
names, China Steel can too.
</P>
<P>
He cited the example of Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport,
which was originally called Chiang Kai-shek International
Airport, pointing out that it took only eight days to process the
change.
</P>
<P>
Chen made the remarks during a Chinese New Year gathering with
supporters from his hometown in southern Tainan County.  Also
attending were Premier Su Tseng- chang, ruling Democratic
Progressive Party Chairman Yu Shyi-kun, former Premier Frank
Hsieh and Council of Labor Affairs Chairman Lee ying-yuan.

<P>
In line with the government's "name rectification" campaign,
which it claims is being carried out to "avoid confusion" with
similarly named counterparts in China, three Taiwanese state-
owned enterprises have recently removed the words of "China" or
"Chinese" from their official titles and added "Taiwan" to
underscore that they are Taiwanese companies.
</P>
<P>
The three are Taiwan Post Co. (originally Chunghwa Post Co.), CPC
Corp. Taiwan (originally Chinese Petroleum Corp.) and CSBC Corp.,
Taiwan (originally Chinese Shipbuilding Corp.).
</P>
<P>
But reports said that former China Steel Chairman Lin Wen-yen had
assessed that a name change for China Steel would be costly, at
an estimated NT$1 billion (US$30.3 million).
</P>
<P>
China Steel executives also reportedly said that the government
only controls about 22.6 percent of China Steel shares, meaning
that it is not an absolute majority and that the promotion of a
name-change for the company is therefore not as easy as the
government thinks.
