Boosted by steady global economic growth and strong demand from
the Chinese market, export orders totaled US$25.93 billion in
January, up US$3.82 billion from the same month of last year, the
Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) said Friday.

The figure represents an increase of 17.26 percent year-on-year,
MOEA officials said.

In terms of products,  export orders for information  and
telecommunications products in January increased by US$1.08
billion, or up 22.68 percent, from the year-earlier level, with
the greatest contribution coming mainly from orders for notebook
computers.

<P>
They were followed by orders for electronic products, which
increased by US$980 million, or up 19.6 percent from the same
month of last year.
</P>
<P>
Export orders for basic metals and basic metal products also
increased by US$380 million, or up 21.74 percent from the same
month of last year, due mainly to increased international prices
for steel products.
</P>
<P>
In terms of region, the United States (US$6.7 billion) continued
to be the largest source of export orders in January, followed by
Hong Kong and China (US$6.63 billion.)
</P>

In a survey of domestic manufacturers, those who expected export
orders to increase accounted for 14.42 percent, while 49.98 said
they would decrease and 35.6 percent said they would remain the
same.

Economic officials said that affected by the cut in working days
due to the nine-day Chinese New Year holiday, export orders might
only stay the same in February without registering an increase.
