Taipei,  March 2 (CNA) 03/02/07  18:56:24 (By Flor Wang)

<P>
Premier Su Tseng-chang said Friday that he is willing to accept
mediation by President Chen Shui-bian regarding forming a ruling
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) ticket to run in the 2008
presidential election.
</P>
<P>
Su made the remarks while answering questions from reporters
about whether he is willing to pair up with Frank Hsieh, a former
premier and former Kaohsiung mayor, in the next presidential
race.
</P>
<P>
Su said that he would accept the outcome of Chen's mediation as
long as the process is "smooth and satisfactory."
</P>
<P>
Apart from Su and Hsieh, incumbent DPP Chairman Yu Shyi-kun has
also announced his presidential bid, making Vice President
Annette Lu the last possible contender in the DPP who has yet to
do so.
</P>
<P>
The  DPP headquarters  will  accept  registration  for its
presidential primary from March 5-9.
</P>
<P>
It has been widely reported that Chen might negotiate between
Hsieh and Su to have them form a DPP presidential ticket.
</P>
<P>
For his part, Hsieh said in a seminar with DPP members at the
party's southern Tainan county chapter later the same day that he
would respect the DPP's negotiation result and added that the
party will have to resort to its primary mechanism to decide on
who should be the party's presidential candidate if negotiation
efforts fail.
</P>
<P>
According to Hsieh, Chen is very likely to play the role of go-
between to help produce a presidential ticket for the DPP.
</P>
<P>
Tainan County Magistrate Su Huan-dji voiced concern on the same
occasion that it might be very difficult to campaign for the DPP
and solicit voter support in the 2008 presidential race because
the ruling party has failed to materialize major public
construction projects in Tainan -- Chen's home county -- since it
came to power in 2000.
</P>
<P>
Tainan Deputy Magistrate  Yen Chun-tsou  urged the central
government in Taipei to revise its appropriation of a special tax
allocation fund in order to give more construction grants to
local governments.
