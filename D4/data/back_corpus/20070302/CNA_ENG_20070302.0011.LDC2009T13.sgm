Taipei,  March 2 (CNA) 03/02/07  15:12:46 (By Deborah Kuo)

<P>
New York-based veteran Taiwan journalist Chang Chao-ying and the
Washington- based Formosan Association for Public Affairs (FAPA)
have jointly established a "freedom of speech prize" aimed at
helping Taiwan media improve their professional quality and
ethics.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a news conference held at the Legislative Yuan, FAPA
Chairman C.T. Lee said the prize, formally named "the FAPA Chang
Chao-ying Prize" for freedom of speech and media ethics, is
envisaged as eventually becoming "a Pulitzer Prize of Taiwan."
</P>
<P>
Noting that the media are "an index showing a country's freedom
and democratic situation, " Lee said Chang, 74, has donated NT$1
million for the establishment of the prize for the purpose of
encouraging members of the Taiwan media to perform well in their
profession so as to promote freedom of speech and help improve
Taiwan people's understanding of the values of democracy.
</P>
<P>
Lee said the FAPA will help select the prize winners and organize
the prize presentation ceremony annually for individuals whose
actions promote freedom of speech and champion the values of
democracy.
</P>
<P>
Lee said a ceremony is scheduled to be held in Taipei March 4 to
mark the FAPA's 25th founding anniversary.
</P>
<P>
Former President Lee Teng-hui is slated to deliver a keynote
speech at the opening of the ceremony, while President Chen Shui-
bian and Vice President Annette Lu are expected to attend a
dinner party at which the first "FAPA Chang Chao-ying prizes" for
freedom of speech and media ethics will be presented.
</P>
<P>
Also speaking at the news conference, Chuang He-tzu, who is a
ruling Democratic Progressive Party legislator representing
overseas Taiwanese communities and a FAPA member, said the FAPA
will strive to achieve eight major tasks this year, including
pushing for the exchange of high-level military personnel between
Taiwan and the United States; the signing of a U.S.-Taiwan Free
Trade Agreement; enhancing Taiwan's Security;  abolishing
Washington's  one-China policy; pushing for Taiwan's joining the
World Health Organization; and helping bolster the influence of
the U.S. congressional Taiwan caucus.
</P>
<P>
Established  in 1982,  the FAPA is a worldwide non-profit
organization resolved to promote international support for the
right of the people of Taiwan to establish an independent and
democratic country and to join the international community.
