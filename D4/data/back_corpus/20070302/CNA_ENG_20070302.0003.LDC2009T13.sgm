VP DENIES KNOWLEDGE OF ALLEGED FUND MISUSE

Taipei,  March  1 (CNA) 03/02/07  10:46:24 (By Y.C. Jou)

<P>
Vice President Annette Lu denied all knowledge Thursday about her
alleged use of a "special state affairs fund" to buy pickled
cucumbers, as claimed by Next magazine a day earlier.
</P>
<P>
In a news release, she also said the media should verify its news
and should not intervene in election-related disputes.
</P>
<P>
The weekly claimed that Lu used the special state affairs fund
for her private use and published photos of receipts that
allegedly belonged to Lu, claiming that the vice president bought
clothes as well as the controversial cornichons and filed the
receipts with Presidential Office accountants to get
reimbursement from the fund.
</P>
<P>
The vice president does not enjoy a special allowance in her own
name, so President Chen Shui-bian follows long-established
practice and appropriates NT$150,000 per month to her from the
president's state affairs fund for her discretionary use, the
magazine said.
</P>
<P>
Responding to the press before attending a TV interview, Lu said
all previous vice presidents' use of the special state affairs
fund should also be made open if there is now the need to
investigate her. "Don't pick on me," she complained.
</P>
<P>
The High Court Prosecutor's Office denied that day any leak of
information on its part related to the magazine coverage. As the
magazine said Lu's deeds it reported had been uncovered during
court proceedings relating to Chen's special state affairs fund
case, Lu had demanded  that the prosecution  explain whether it
leaked information to the media.
</P>
<P>
Asked by the press whether she believed that the leaking of the
receipts, which she had claimed she never saw, were related to
the race for the ruling Democratic Progressive Party's
presidential candidate nomination, Lu said she had no idea.
</P>
<P>
She also declined to answer whether or when she would declare her
bid to run for the  presidency.  Registration  for the DPP's
presidential primary is set to take place March 5-9, and Lu is
the only one of the four top DPP heavyweights expected to compete
for the party's nomination that has not announced a bid.
