Taipei,  March 2 (CNA) 03/02/07  22:10:06 (By Elizabeth Hsu)

Taiwan's economic performance showed signs of improvement in
January due to growth in the value of exports, with monitoring
indicators in the government's five-color rating system turning
"yellow blue" from "blue, " the Council for Economic Planning and
Development (CEPD) reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
In the five-color measurement system, yellow-blue means an
economic slowdown while blue represents an economic recession.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference, Hung Rei-pin, the CEPD official in charge
of economic research affairs, revealed the official ratings of
the nation's economic performance in the first month of the year.
He said the total score of overall economic performance increased
to 17 points in January from 16 in the previous month.
</P>
<P>
Additionally, the leading indicators recorded a monthly increase
of 0.6 percent to 108.4 points in January, with five of seven
indexes making up the indicators seeing improvement, including
exports, manufacturing sector work hours, new manufacturing
orders, total area available for the construction of new
buildings, and the annual growth of M1B money circulation.
</P>
<P>
Indicators of wholesale prices and stock prices posted falling
scores in January compared with the previous month, the CEPD
report indicated.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, coincident indicators posted a 0.4 percent growth to
109.2 points in January, which was contributed to by factors
including a steady increase of monthly earnings of workers in the
manufacturing sector and smaller decreases in manufacturing
production and industrial production.
</P>
<P>
Hung said although  there was an improvement  in economic
performance, there were also signs pointing to a recession in
industrial production, and expressed cautious optimism on the
issue of future economic development.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Hung also indicated there were more manufacturing
businesses around the country in January that were optimistic
regarding the country's economic development over the next three
months than there were pessimists.
</P>
<P>
In a January survey, 15 percent of the responding manufacturers
predicted the economy will take a turn for the better in the next
three months, down from 17 percent registered in a similar survey
in the previous month, while 70 percent expected that the economy
will remain unchanged, up from 64 percent.
</P>
<P>
Only 13 percent of the manufacturers predicted a recession, Hung
said.
