</HEADLINE>

Geneva,  Switzerland,  March 1 (CNA) 03/02/07  19:14:59 (By Neil
Lu and T.C. Jiang)
</P>
<P>
Taiwan's travel and tourism competitiveness was ranked 30th in
the world and fourth in Asia, according to the results of a
survey recently released by the Geneva-based World Economic
Forum.
</P>
<P>
It marks the first time Taiwan has been included in a global
tourism rating.
</P>
<P>
Previous similar surveys did not include Taiwan, as the country
is not a member of the World Tourism Organization or the World
Travel and Tourism Council.
</P>
<P>
The survey, the first of its kind published by the forum, covered
124 economies.
</P>
<P>
"Our study is not a `beauty contest' or a statement about the
attractiveness of a country. On the contrary, we aim to measure
the factors that make it attractive to develop the travel and
tourism industry of individual countries, " said Jennifer Blanke,
Senior Economist of the forum's Global Competitiveness Network.
</P>
<P>
In Asia, Taiwan is behind only Hong Kong, Singapore and Japan,
the survey shows.
</P>
<P>
In the global rankings, Japan took 25th, South Korea 42nd,
Thailand 43rd, Indonesia 60th, and China 71st.
</P>
<P>
The top ten list includes Switzerland, Austria, Germany, Iceland,
the United States, Hong Kong, Canada, Singapore, Luxembourg and
the United Kingdom.
</P>
<P>
The survey further indicates Taiwan in 8th place in terms of
environmental regulation and 14th in terms of information and
communication technology (ICT) infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
However, Taiwan is weak in terms of prioritization of travel and
tourism and natural and cultural resources -- 78th and 63rd,
respectively, according to the survey.
</P>
<P>
Global tourism income has increased from US$2.1 billion in 1950
to US$622.7 billion in 2004, the forum said, adding that by 2006,
the income is predicted to account for 10.3 percent of the
world's gross domestic product (GDP).
</P>
<P>
By then, a total of 234 million jobs will have been created,
occupying 8.2 percent of the world's employment population, the
forum forecast.
</P>
<P>
Attaching great importance to the development of tourism, the
Taiwan government has recently launched plans aimed at doubling
the number of visitors to Taiwan to 5 million this year.
