U.S. UNIVERSITY NAMES COLLEGE AFTER FORENSIC EXPERT FROM TAIWAN

<P>
The University of New Haven honored world-renowned Taiwan
forensic expert Henry C. Lee by naming a college after him
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to well-wishers attending the christening ceremony of
the Henry C. Lee College of Criminal Justice and Forensic
Sciences, Lee jokingly said that he joined the university in 1975
because the students had discerning eyes.
</P>
<P>
Lee recalled that after he earned his doctoral degree from New
York University (NYU) in 1975, he applied to teach at the
University of New Haven. The screening team comprised of school
faculty as well as students interviewed him for the job. The
students found him to be the top candidate, while the faculty
placed him second.
</P>
<P>
Three years later, the professors that served on the screening
team revealed that they were concerned about whether he spoke
English well enough to teach in the classroom, he said.
</P>
<P>
Lee helped found the university's forensic science program, which
has since gained fame, attracting students from all over the
United States and nearly 40 countries around the world over the
past three decades. The forensic science college also has
exchange and cooperation programs with police and education
departments in Taiwan, China and Italy.
</P>
<P>
Lee was born in China and grew up in Taiwan. When he came with
his wife to the United States in 1965, he had only US$50 and
hardly knew any English.
</P>
<P>
He earned his bachelor's degree in forensic science from John Jay
College in 1972, then continued his studies in biochemistry at
NYU where he earned his master's degree in 1974 and his doctorate
in 1975.
</P>
<P>
Cracking a joke in fluent English, Lee said that the United
States is country full of opportunities, and he now leads a good
life, although he "still can't speak English."
</P>
<P>
Over the years, Lee has taught many students who have later
served in prominent posts in various fields.  Among the many
dignitaries attending the ceremony, quite a few were his former
students, including James A. Amann, speaker of Connecticut's
House of Representatives.
</P>
<P>
Steven Kaplan, president of the University of New Haven, said
that the school will construct a building for the Henry C. Lee
College of Criminal Justice and Forensic Sciences and that it has
solicited US$10 million so far, with Dr. Lee being the largest
contributor.
</P>
<P>
Lee, who has been invited to speak in countries around the world,
has donated all of his earnings from his lectures to the
university, Kaplan said, adding that Lee's prestige should also
help attract more donations.
</P>
<P>
Kaplan said that the university had wanted to name the college
after Lee three years ago but that Lee initially refused and then
only agreed after repeated attempts to persuade him to change his
mind.
</P>
<P>
Lee is currently the Chief Emeritus for the Scientific Services
and was the commissioner of Public Safety for the State of
Connecticut for over two years and has served as the state's
Chief Criminalist between 1979-2000. He was the driving force
behind the establishment of a modern State Police Forensic
Science Laboratory in Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
Lee's testimony figured prominently in the high-profile O.J.
Simpson trial as well as hundreds of other murder cases. He has
also assisted police in their investigations of other famous
crimes, such as the 1993 suicide of White House Counsel Vincent
Foster, and the reinvestigation of the Kennedy assassination.
</P>
<P>
He has been the recipient of numerous medals and awards,
including the 1996 Medal of Justice from the Justice Foundation
and the 1998 Lifetime Achievement Award from the Science and
Engineer Association.
