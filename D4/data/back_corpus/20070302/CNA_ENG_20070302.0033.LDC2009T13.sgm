HALF KMT LAWMAKERS REPORTEDLY LONG FOR EX-CHAIRMAN'S LEADERSHIP

Taipei,   March  2  (CNA) 03/02/07  19:05:36 (By Maubo Chang)
</P>
<P>
More than half of the opposition Kuomintang's (KMT's) lawmakers
support the idea of giving the party's former chairman, Lien
Chan, the reins of the party again, KMT lawmaker Hsu Shu-po
claimed Friday.
</P>
<P>
Hsu, who took the initiative in calling for Lien's assumption of
the party leadership again, told a news conference that 47
elected KMT lawmakers had already signed his appeal in addition
to 20 party-appointed lawmakers, which would account for more
than half of the party's 111 lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
Claiming that more party lawmakers promised to support but
refused to sign his appeal, the number of elected party lawmakers
supporting his idea is "sure to exceed 50," he claimed.
</P>
<P>
He refused to disclose the appeal supposedly signed by the
purported supportive lawmakers, saying only that he would vouch
for the truth of his claim.
</P>
<P>
Hsu said the appeal would be presented to Lien when he returned
from an overseas trip later that day and thereby spare the party
a crisis in leadership stemming from the resignation of Ma Ying-
jeou Feb. 13 after he was indicted on corruption charges.
</P>
<P>
The KMT is slated to hold a by-election to select Ma's successor
April 7 but there is fear that it might trigger a new round of
inner-party power struggle and jeopardize the party's unity ahead
of the year-end legislative elections.
</P>
<P>
Lien led the party between 2000 and 2005 and was given the
ceremonial title of KMT honorary chairman when he retired.
