KMT HEAVYWEIGHTS TO MEET OVER PRESIDENTIAL BID
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taipei,  Feb.  15 (CNA) 02/15/07  16:30:14 (By Flor Wang)

Kuomintang (KMT) Honorary Chairman Lien Chan and four another
party heavyweights are to meet Friday in an effort to build a
consensus and encourage cooperation within the party prior to its
presidential primaries, KMT Secretary-General Wu Den-yih said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a news conference at the Legislative Yuan, Wu Den-yih
said that Lien is to call a meeting the next day with KMT Acting
Chairman Wu Po-hsiung, Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng and
former KMT Chairman Ma Ying-jeou to coordinate presidential
candidacy within the party.
</P>
<P>
Lien's Wednesday decision to mediate the issue came one day after
Wu Po-hsiung, leading five KMT vice chairmen, paid a visit to
Lien to express their hope that Lien, a respected figure in the
party, could assist in coordinating the matter before he leaves
Taiwan Saturday to spend the Chinese New Year holiday overseas.
</P>
<P>
Lien is expected to push Ma and Wang to form a single ticket,
avoiding a KMT split in the coming presidential polls.
</P>
<P>
As to a media report that the two Wus have formed an alliance to
help Ma outgun Wang in seeking the KMT's nomination for the 2008
presidential race, Wu Den-yih said that Wu Po-hsiung will lead
the party in accordance with its regulations after Ma stepped
down as KMT chairman Tuesday over an indictment againsh him on
corruption charges earlier the same day.
</P>
<P>
Ma immediately  announced  his decision  to quit  the KMT
chairmanship  and officially made public his presidential  bid
following the indictment over his allegedly mishandling of a
special municipal allowance allocated for his discretionary use
when he served as mayor of Taipei from 1996 to 2006.
</P>
<P>
Ma's announcement of his intention to take part in the next
presidential election has placed Wang, who is also keenly
interested in vying for the KMT's nomination, in an awkward
position.
</P>
<P>
In a bid to secure Ma's right to participate in the party's
presidential primaries, the KMT's powerful Central Standing
Committee removed a special clause banning indicted members from
running in elections during its weekly meeting Wednesday,
provoking criticism that it is a tailor-made measure to bail out
Ma.
</P>
<P>
KMT-affiliated Taipei Mayor Hau Lung-bin, who met Lien earlier
Thursday, said that Lien strongly believes that unity is the key
to securing the party's victory in the 2008 presidential race.
</P>
<P>
Hau quoted Lien as saying that both Ma and Wang are valuable
assets to the KMT but that the two men need to cooperate to win
the election.
</P>
<P>
According to Hau, Lien contended that there absolutely is room
for coordination to work out a solution between Ma and Wang given
the precondition that party unity be maintained.
