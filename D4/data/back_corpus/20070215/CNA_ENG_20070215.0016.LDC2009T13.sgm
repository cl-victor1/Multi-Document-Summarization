A survey conducted by 1111 Manpower Bank, an online job search
firm, shows that over 80 percent of working men and women believe
financial means are a prerequisite for marriage, a spokesman for
the manpower bank said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Wu Juei-ying, vice general manager and spokesman for 1111
Manpower Bank, said that the online survey, conducted Jan. 30-
Feb. 13, on working class attitudes towards love and money,
elicited 1,957 valid responses.
</P>
<P>
The results of the survey show that 80.71 percent of working
women would not marry to those with poor financial resources, and
80.37 percent of working men admit that they would not make a
commitment to a girlfriend under similar conditions.

<P>
Wu pointed out that three ideal indications of financial ability
that women look for in men are a monthly income of NT$100,000
(US$ 3,043) --31.56 percent, home ownership--25.80 percent, and
NT$1 million in available funds--13.86 percent.
</P>
<P>
Working  men ranked highest the following  three threshold
conditions for entering into marriage: available cash of NT$1
million--33.11 percent, stable monthly income of NT$ 100,000--
20.78 percent, and a car--16.89 percent.
</P>
<P>
Overall, the three top ranked considerations when considering
stepping out of a love affair and into a marriage, for both
unmarried men and women, are a stable relationship (78.83
percent), financial ability (71.17 percent), and stable
employment (44.67 percent).
</P>
<P>
Wu said only less than 20 percent of working people believe in
love without money.
