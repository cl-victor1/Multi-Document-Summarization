Preliminary tallies show that individual income tax revenues
amounted to NT$334.3 billion last year, business income tax
revenues totaled NT$311.8 billion and securities transaction tax
revenues topped NT$89.9 billion due to a 30 percent annual
increase in accumulated securities trading volume over the past
year.

To sum up, Hsu said, the government's tax revenues surpassed its
original target by more than NT$120 billion last year compared to
