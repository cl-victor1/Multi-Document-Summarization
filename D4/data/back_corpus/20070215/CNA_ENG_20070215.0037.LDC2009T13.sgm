A concert titled "Spirit of Taiwan" will take place Feb. 28 at
the Chungshan Soccer Stadium in Taipei City, a concert organizer
said at a press conference Thursday.

<P>
Lin Hsu-tzuo, a member of local band Chthonic, which will perform
at the concert, said the concert is being organized by people
from the music, art, film and academic circles to "express non-
government, civic voices about solutions to social problems in
Taiwan" and to mark the 60th anniversary of the 228 Incident, in
which thousands of Taiwanese were murdered by troops of the then-
ruling authoritarian Kuomintang headed by the late President
Chiang Kai-shek.

<P>
The concert aims to convey the idea and call for people's
recognition of "transitional justice" that it is believed can
bring Taiwan on the road of reconciliation to its history of
authoritarian rule giving way to democracy.

Wang Dan, a leader of China's 1989 pro-democracy movement that
later led to the tragic Tiananmen massacre, said at the
conference that he admires Taiwan's democratic society but still
sees that its civic society is not well developed yet.
</P>
<P>
Lin said that in addition to groups from Taiwan, bands from other
countries have been invited to perform, including the U.K.'s
Muse, Plastic People of the Universe from the Czech Republic and
Akiakane from Japan. There will also be speeches and a film on
human rights and democracy.
