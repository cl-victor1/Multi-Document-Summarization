President Chen Shui-bian said Wednesday the campaign to rename
state-owned companies to remove Chinese reference and add the
word "Taiwan" to their titles to avoid confusions with similarly
named Chinese counterparts has nothing to do with changes of the
country's official title.
</P>
<P>
The corporate redesignation campaign is also by no means in
violation of his "four noes" commitment to the United States,
whcih includes no change to the country's official title during
his presidency, Chen added.
