CARLYLE AGREES TO TERMINATE ASE BUYOUT EXCLUSIVE CLAUSE
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  Feb.  15 (CNA) 02/15/07  20:17:06 (By Deborah Kuo)
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Carlyle Group has agreed to terminate an exclusive
clause that it signed late last year with Taiwan's Advanced
Semiconductor Engineering, Inc. (ASE) concerning Carlyle's
proposed buyout, ASE officials announced Thursday.
</P>
<P>
ASE announced that the exclusive clause -- signed by ASE Chairman
Jason Chang and the Carlyle Group management Nov. 16 -- along
with agreements on buyout costs and contract-breaching
compensation, became null and void with immediate effect.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the termination complies with U.S. stock market
regulations and norms, the officials said the company sought the
termination of the exclusive clause aimed at protecting the
interests of ASE investors from Taiwan and abroad.
</P>
<P>
The Carlyle Group, one of the world's largest private equity
firms, offered in early January to purchase ASE, the world's
largest chip packaging and testing company, for approximately
US$5.5 billion, or NT$39 per share for ASE's entire stocks, and
make it private.
</P>
<P>
ASE said it was not sure whether NT$39 per share is a reasonable
price for the buyout and that there are probably other companies
willing to acquire ASE at a higher price.
</P>
<P>
The Carlyle Group's ASE acquisition case, however, is still being
reviewed by an assessment group headed by Cheng Tien-cheng, a
member of the ASE board, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
So far, ASE is still uncertain as to whether the Carlyle Group
will still be interested in continuing the acquisition bid, they
added.
</P>
<P>
The U.S.-Taiwan Business Council, a non-profit association that
groups companies involved in business between Taiwan and the
United States, said Feb. 1 in a news release that the potential
deal highlights the ability of Taiwan companies to attract
substantial foreign investments, greatly benefiting Taiwan's
economy.
</P>
<P>
It also underscores the attractiveness of Taiwan's semiconductor
market, which the council has predicted will become the world's
largest market for chip equipment spending and for DRAM
production in 2007,  due largely to new partnerships  and a
number of new investments, the press statement said.
</P>
<P>
Responding to the U.S. council's comments, a Ministry of Economic
Affairs official in charge of investment affairs said the buyout
application is still in the opinion-soliciting stage.
</P>
<P>
According to the U.S.-Taiwan Business Council, the Carlyle
Group's intention to enter Taiwan's semiconductor market reflects
the high caliber of Taiwan businesses and a desire to link the
U.S. and Taiwan -- arguably the two most important semiconductor
markets in the world.
