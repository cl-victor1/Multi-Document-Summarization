</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  Feb.  15 (CNA) 02/15/07  14:22:29 (By Y.F. Low)
</P>
<P>
Vice President Annette Lu said Thursday that she has no plans at
present to take part in the ruling Democratic  Progressive
Party's (DPP's)  primary for the 2008 presidential election.
</P>
<P>
Lu dismissed as "groundless" a media report claiming that
President Chen Shui- bian has tried to dissuade her and DPP
Chairman Yu Shyi-kun from running for the presidency in 2008 in
an effort to "simplify" the presidential competition within the
DPP.
</P>
<P>
"How could President Chen possibly have dissuaded me as I have
never told him that I want to join the race?" Lu asked.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, Chen is trying to reduce the number of
DPP contenders to just two, namely former Premier Frank Hsieh and
incumbent Premier Su Tseng- chang, and has offered to arrange
some other positions for Lu and Yu in exchange for them agreeing
not to run.
</P>
<P>
Lu,  Yu, Hsieh and Su are widely seen as "the four DPP
heavyweights" who are likely to compete to represent the party in
the next presidential election.
</P>
<P>
Asked about the same report Thursday, Yu denied any knowledge of
the president's reported efforts to dissuade him and Lu from
joining the race.
</P>
<P>
While expressing his support for efforts within the DPP to try to
mediate among the presidential aspirants, Yu, however, said such
efforts, if excessive, might create misunderstanding that the DPP
is making some kind of under-the-counter deals with the
aspirants.
</P>
<P>
Yu confirmed that President Chen has consulted with him about the
possibility of his taking over the premiership, but he stressed
that the offer has nothing to do with the presidential election.
</P>
<P>
Yu said he has no intention of leaving his present position,
because as the DPP chairman, he can do a lot of things for the
country, especially those related to the country's development
and future.
</P>
<P>
Also commenting on the report, Wang Shu-huei, a deputy whip of
the DPP legislative caucus, said that the DPP has a complete
primary system to guide the nomination of candidates for public
offices and that it is unlikely the president will try to
dissuade anyone from running for the presidency when no one has
publicly announced their decision to join the race.
</P>
<P>
According to a timetable for the presidential primary finalized
by the DPP's Central Standing Committee Wednesday, registration
for the primary will be open from March 5-9.
</P>
<P>
A vote by party members is scheduled for May 6, while opinion
polls on the support ratings of the aspirants will be conducted
from May 7-28. The outcome of the primary is slated to be
announced May 30.
