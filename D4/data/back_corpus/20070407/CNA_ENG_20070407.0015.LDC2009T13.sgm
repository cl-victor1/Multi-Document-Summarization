World Vision Taiwan has recently begun its annual campaign aimed
at raising funds for educational aid to aboriginal children
living in remote mountain areas in central Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
This is the ninth year that the charity organization is holding
the campaign in cooperation with Starbucks Taiwan, a joint
venture between U.S. coffee giant Starbucks Corp. and the Taiwan-
based Uni-President Enterprises Corp., to help kids living in
poverty to receive an education.

A donation of NT$1,000 (US$30) allows an aboriginal child to take
after-school courses, while a donation of NT$2,500 can help one
poor child pay tuition for one semester, according to World
Vision Taiwan.

For this year, a World Vision Taiwan executive said Saturday, the
organization plans to assist 3,650 aboriginal children living in
the educational resources- poor Hoping village in Taichung
County, as well as in Hsinyi and Jenai villages in Nantou County,
to go to school and take after-school courses.

<P>
Last year, the campaign raised over NT$4.2 million, which allowed
1,900 aboriginal children living in the three remote villages to
go to school, World Vision Taiwan said.
