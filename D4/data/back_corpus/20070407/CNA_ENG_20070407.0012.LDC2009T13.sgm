Taipei,  April 7 (CNA) 04/07/07  14:06:41 (By Elizabeth Hsu)

The main opposition Kuomintang's (KMT's) chairmanship by-election
was held Saturday, with over 337,000 members around Taiwan and
overseas casting ballots for one or the other of the two
candidates -- former KMT acting Chairman Wu Poh- hsiung and
Legislator Hung Hsiu-chu.
</P>
<P>
Honorary Chairman Lien Chan cast his ballot along with Wu and
Hung.  He called the  election  a milestone  in the party's
democratization, praising the candidates for showing respect for
each other in their campaigning for the sake of the party unity.
</P>
<P>
"Both candidates have demonstrated what a decent election is, and
that makes the election significant, " Lien said, adding that
regardless of who wins, the person chosen as the new head of the
party is expected to be able to push for cooperation between
former KMT Chairman Ma Ying-jeou and Legislative Yuan Speaker
Wang Jin-pyng -- two KMT aspirants for the presidency.
</P>
<P>
According to the KMT regulations, the person who wins will assume
the post April 11 and serve until August 2009 when the party
holds its 18th national congress.
</P>
<P>
Out of concerns about a possible low turnout due to cloudy
weather and a four- day holiday, Ma urged party members to vote,
while casting his ballot.
</P>
<P>
The number of eligible voters in this chairmanship by-election is
much lower than that of the previous election in July 16, 2005,
when 524,488 of the over 1 million eligible voters cast ballots.
There are fewer eligible voters this time around because the KMT
amended its election regulations under Ma's leadership, making
only those party members who have paid their membership fees
eligible to vote.
</P>
<P>
A total of 486 voting stations were set up around the country for
Saturday's by- election, with the largest located at Changho
Middle School in Taipei County, for 5,057 voters, and the
smallest in Wushiu on the outlying island of Kinmen, for 15
voters.
</P>
<P>
Huang Chung-hsien, chief of the KMT organization and development
department, expressed the hope that the turnout for this by-
election will be around 40 percent and thus surpass the 19
percent turnout for the chairmanship election of the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party on Jan. 15, 2006.
