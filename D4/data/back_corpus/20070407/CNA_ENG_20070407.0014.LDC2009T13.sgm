Lee Shu-ken, a successful alumnus of Yung An Elementary School in
eastern Taitung County, has been offering scholarships to the
school's students for 20 years to encourage them to utilize their
talents, study and achieve, the school's principal, Yang Huei-
mei, said Saturday.

Lee, who started his own homestay business in his hometown of
Taitung County decades ago,  offers NT$200,000  (US$6,046)  in
scholarship money annually, Yang said.

The school set up the Lee Shu-ken Scholarship and a strict
scholarship committee to examine which students are qualified to
receive scholarship money. Nearly 70 percent of students at the
school have received scholarship money, ranging from NT$100 to
NT$5,000.

The scholarship money is used to help students pay their
registration fees or school lunches and to award students who
perform well, Yang said, adding that eight students have received
over NT$10,000 in scholarship money.

<P>
For example, fifth-grade student Wang Wei-chin, has been awarded
NT$34,875 in scholarship money for her excellent performance in
school and sports.

Some students are able to relieve the financial burden on their
families with the scholarship money, Yang said.
