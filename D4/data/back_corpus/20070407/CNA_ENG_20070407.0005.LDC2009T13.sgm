FEMALE OFFICER TRANSFERRED ON MERIT: COAST GUARD UNIT
</HEADLINE>

Kinmen,  April 6 (CNA) 04/07/07  10:28:59 (By Maubo Chang)

A Coast Guard Administrative unit on the frontline island of
Kinmen stated Friday that a female officer posted to a harbor
position here was transferred in recognition of her excellent job
performance rather than any other reason.
</P>
<P>
The statement issued by the 9th Corps of the Central Coastal
Patrol Office of the Coast Guard Administration said Lieutenant
Pai Tsai-rung was transformed last month from her position as
chief of the Shuitou wharf security post to be chief of staff for
the 3rd Corps in Taichung, central Taiwan, to satisfy her desire
to work near her Taichung home.
</P>
<P>
That wish was granted because her excellent job performance stood
her in good stead during the Coast Guard Administration's regular
staff reshuffle, the statement read.
</P>
<P>
The statement contradicts a feminist group's complaint that Pai,
who assumed her job at Shuitou seven months ago, was forced to
leave Kinmen after her male next- in-command at the check station
was discovered stealing her underwear as a fetish.
</P>
<P>
According to the statement, reassignment from chief of a security
post to the chief of staff of a corps is a promotion for Pai
rather than a disciplinary action.
</P>
<P>
As for that male officer who stole Pai's underwear, the statement
made clear that for demonstrating behavior unbecoming a military
leader he has been transferred to a non-leadership position, but
will not be otherwise disciplined.
