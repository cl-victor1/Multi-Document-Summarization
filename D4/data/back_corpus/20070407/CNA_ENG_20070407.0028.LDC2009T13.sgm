VP URGES NEW KMT CHIEF NOT TO BOYCOTT 2007 BUDGET BILL

Taipei, April 7 (CNA) 04/07/07  22:45:27 (By Sofia Wu)

Vice President Annette Lu said Saturday she looks forward to
seeing the main opposition Kuomintang no longer boycott the
central government's 2007 budget bill under its new chairman.
</P>
<P>
Lu made the remarks after Wu Poh-hsiung, a seasoned politician,
won a landslide in his party's chairmanship by-election earlier
in the day.
</P>
<P>
Noting that a number of critical bills have been stalled in the
opposition- controlled Legislative Yuan, Lu said she keenly hopes
that the Wu-led KMT will no longer boycott the Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) administration's policy initiatives at
every turn.
</P>
<P>
The KMT and its "pan-blue alliance" ally -- the People First
Party, jointly control a slim majority in the legislature and
have often blocked the Cabinet- proposed bills from even being
discussed on the legisaltive floor over the past seven years.
</P>
<P>
Lu, who is bidding to represent the DPP in the 2008 presidential
election, said it is hoped that the KMT can from now on act as
the country's loyal opposition and engage in peaceful and
rational competition with the ruling DPP with visionary policy
proposals. As the first step, Lu said, Wu can help manage an
early passage by the legislature of the central government's 2007
budget bill which should have been approved before the last
legislative session ended in late January.
</P>
<P>
Responding to Singaporean Minister Mentor Lee Kuan Yew's recent
criticism that Taiwan's pursuit of independence and a new
constitution is a dead-end that would lead to nowhere, Lu said
Taiwan has long been an independent sovereign country and need
not waste time any more on a debate over whether it should seek
independence.
</P>
<P>
As to constitutional re-engineering, Lu said it's all too common
in a democratic country where the government is entitled to
tailor its constitutional system to cater to its changing
political and social situations.
</P>
<P>
Lu further said the drive to promote Taiwanese identity is not
aimed at confronting with China. "Instead, we treat China as a
distant relative and a close neighbor that both can benefit from
peaceful engagement in various fields,: she added.
