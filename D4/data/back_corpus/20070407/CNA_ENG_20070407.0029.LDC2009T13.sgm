CITY COUNCILOR CALLS FOR NO HASTE IN DECIDING CHATEAU'S FATE
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  April 7 (CNA) 04/07/07  23:42:47 (By Sofia Wu)

<P>
An opposition Taipei City councilor urged the municipal
government Saturday to refrain from hastily deciding to restore a
badly damaged chateau "to its past glory" simply because a late
president once briefly lived there.
</P>
<P>
Chien Yu-yen, a first-time councilwoman from the tiny Taiwan
Solidarity Union (TSU) , made the remarks after Lee Yung-ping,
director of the city government's Department of Cultural Affairs,
said earlier in the day that the Grass Mountain Chateau on Yang
ming shand in suburban Tipei, which was partially destroyed by a
fire just after midnight Friday, will definitely be restored
since it is listed as a protected heritage site.
</P>
<P>
Chien advised Lee of the main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) to wait
at least until after an investigation report on the cause of the
fire is completed to evaluate whether the 87-year-old chateau
should be rebuilt with taxpayers' money.
</P>
<P>
While the KMT-controlled  city government  has touted  the
Japanese-style chateau as the late President Chiang Kai-shek's
first official residence in Taiwan, Chien said that to the best
of her knowledge, Chiang had lived at a villa in Tahsi in
northern Taoyuan County for nearly two months after fleeing to
Taiwan from the Chinese mainland in June 1949 before moving to
Grass Mountain Chateau.
</P>
<P>
During Chiang's authoritarian rule of Taiwan, Chien said, he had
built more than 37 chateaus in scenic spots around Taiwan, with
the exception of Granss Mountain Chateau which was built in 1920
during the era of Japanese colonial rule.
</P>
<P>
"It is worth thinking whether we should presever so many legacies
of a 'dictator' whom the Democratic Progressive Party
administration has branded as the key perpetrator of the infamous
228 Incident of 1947, " Chien said, adding that it is hoped that
the municipal cultural bureau can refrain from adopting an
ideology-based approach to deal with the "heritage sites" issue.
</P>
<P>
In her view, Chien said, the city government has not attached
similar importance to the preservation of the city's other
cultural heritage sites, such as Chungshan Bridge, Taiwan railway
relics and Talungtung cultural relics.
</P>
<P>
"The cultural affairs department should give the top priority to
all city dwellers' interest in deciding the chateau's fate and
should not blindly spend huge public funds to preserve anything
related with the late dictator," she added.
</P>
<P>
The cause of the fire that engulfed the Grass Mountain Chateau's
main building is still under investiogations.
</P>
<P>
The city government has commissioned the Buddhist Fo Kuang
University to manage the chateau since 2002 and the cooperation
contract is scheduled to expire at the end of June this year.
Chien said whether  the university  should be held responsible
for compensation for the fire damage also deserves a study.
