Taipei,  April 7 (CNA) 04/07/07  13:19:14 (By Lilian Wu)

<P>
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) has arranged a
birdwatching trip for ambassadors and representatives in Taiwan,
MOFA spokesman Wang Chien-yeh said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Affairs Minister James Huang will accompany them to the
scenic Aowanda National Forest Recreation Area in Nantou County
in central Taiwan late this month, Wang said.
</P>
<P>
The ministry hopes that they will gain a greater appreciation of
Taiwan's beautiful landscape and learn more about the island's
environmental protection efforts, he added.
</P>
<P>
He noted that Aowanda is famous for its autumn scenes of colorful
maple trees, adding that every March and April, it is also one of
the best places in Taiwan for birdwatching.
</P>
<P>
"The diplomatic personnel will surely be impressed by Taiwan's
natural beauty during their visit to Aowanda," Wang said.
</P>
<P>
He added that during their visit, they will have the chance to
see Formosa Magpie, which briefly appear in Aowanda every April.
</P>
<P>
The Formosa Magpie is a leading contender to be chosen as
Taiwan's national bird in a contest being sponsored by the Taiwan
Association of Sustainable Ecological Engineering Development.
The other three top contenders are the Yellow Tit, the Swinhoe's
Pheasant and the Mikado Pheasant.
</P>
<P>
The MOFA arranges for diplomats and representatives to travel
around Taiwan every year, with the aim of introducing the natural
beauty of the island to foreign friends, Wang said. In recent
years, trips have been arranged to the outlying Kinmen Island and
Green Island.
</P>
<P>
The birdwatching trip was originally scheduled to take place at
the end of March, but because Huang visited St. Lucia during that
time, the trip was rescheduled for April 26-27.
</P>
<P>
Ambassadors and representative from 25 countries are expected to
join the birdwatching trip, Wang said.
