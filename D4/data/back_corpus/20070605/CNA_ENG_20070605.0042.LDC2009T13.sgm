Departing Malaysian Representative to the Republic of China Ku
Abdul Rahman visited the outlying island of Kinmen Tuesday and
described it as a "unique and fantastic place."
</P>
<P>
Ku Abdul Rahman, president of the Malaysian Friendship and Trade
Center in Taiwan, and his deputy, Shahril Effendi Abd. Ghany,
were greeted on the island by Kinmen Magistrate Lee Chu-feng.
</P>
<P>
It was the Ku Abdul Rahman's first visit to Kinmen since he
assumed the post nearly 30 months ago, and his last before he
steps down and returns to Malaysia June 10.
</P>
<P>
After visiting traditional villages, relics left from the war
between Taiwan and China and popular tourist spots, Ku Abdul
Rahman said he was very impressed by Kinmen, especially upon
learning of the deep relations and links between Kinmen and
Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
Lee told Ku Abdul Rahman that many Malaysian people, including
several well- known business leaders, are descendants of
immigrants from Kinmen.
</P>
<P>
According to Lee, more than 100,000 Malaysian nationals are
descended from Kinmen immigrants -- a number that well exceeds
the present number of Kinmen residents.
