Taipei,  June 4 (CNA) 06/05/07  11:06:42 (By Sofia Wu)

A local environmental group launched a "plant a tree for me"
program Monday to encourage local people and corporations to make
donations for tree planting as part of efforts to protect
Taiwan's climate and natural environment.
</P>
<P>
Under the program,  National  Taiwan  University's  (NTU's)
Experimental Forest Administration will plant a tree for every
individual or corporation who makes a donation of NT$500
(US$15.15) , said a spokesman for the Environmental Quality
Protection Foundation (EQPF).
</P>
<P>
According to EQPF Chairman Liu Ming-lung, the foundation will
cooperate with the NTU Experimental  Forest Administration  in
encouraging local people to join forces to help slow global
warming and protect Taiwan's climate by contributing funds for
tree planting.
</P>
<P>
The "plant a tree for me" program is also a response to the
"Plant for the Planet: Billion Tree Campaign" launched by the
United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) earlier this year
aimed at encouraging countries around the world to plant a total
of 1 billion trees in the fight against global warming, Liu said.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the program spotlights the vital importance of
voluntary collective action in the fight against climate change,
Liu said that taking small but practical steps to combat global
warming by planting trees is critical to protecting Taiwan's
climate from drastic changes.
</P>
<P>
Wang Ya-nan,  director  of the NTU's  Experimental  Forest
Administration (EFA) , said tree planting can bring about
multiple benefits, including reducing carbon dioxide, promoting
the ecological balance, providing additional tourist attractions,
slowing global warming and facilitating soil and water
preservation.
</P>
<P>
According to Wang, the EFA has designated a plot of land covering
55 hectares for the "plant a tree for me" program under which a
seedling of Taiwan endemic plant species will be planted for
anyone who donates NT$500.
</P>
<P>
"All the trees planted under the program will be incorporated
into the national forestry system to ensure their survival for at
least 40 years, " Wang explained, adding that a hectare of land
can accommodate 1,500 trees.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the first five months of the year are the best period
for planting trees, Wang said the EFA will not begin carrying out
the program until next March.
</P>
<P>
A single tree can reduce an average of 465 kg of carbon dioxide
during a 40-year life span, Wang said, adding that the forest to
be created under the "plant a tree for me" program will be
tentatively named "Protect Taiwan Climate Commemorative Forest."
</P>
<P>
Prospective donors are welcome to deposit donations in the EFA's
bank account at the Chang Hwa Commercial Bank's Chushan Branch
with aoount number 59490400372610.
</P>
<P>
Donors will be presented with a "Friends of Climate Protection"
card on which each specific tree's carbon dioxide reduction rate
will be recorded. Donors will also be invited to take part in
EFA's tree planting activities March 12 -- Taiwan's Arbor Day --
every year.
