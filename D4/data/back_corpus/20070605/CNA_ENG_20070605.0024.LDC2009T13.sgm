Taipei-based Trans Asia Airways will from July 3 start offering
charter flight services from Taipei to Vladivostok in Russia's
far east, company officials said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The aviation company will use 147-seat A320 planes on the route
between Taipei and Vladivostok, Russia's largest port city on the
Pacific Ocean, providing Taiwan tourists with another exotic
option, company officials said.

<P>
The flights, twice a week on Wednesday and Saturday, will take
around four hours. The aviation company is also cooperating with
a travel agency to market a group tour during the July-October
period for Taiwanese tourists hoping to experience something very
different.
