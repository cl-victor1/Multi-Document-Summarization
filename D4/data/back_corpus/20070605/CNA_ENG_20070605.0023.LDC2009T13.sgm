EXECUTIVE YUAN ASKS TAIWAN SALT NOT TO RAISE PRICES
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  June 5 (CNA) 06/05/07  18:15:49 (By Lilian Wu)

<P>
The Executive Yuan has asked Taiwan Salt Industrial  Corp.  not
to raise  the price of salt,  Cabinet Secretary-General Chen
Chin-jun said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Chen was responding to reports that quoted Taiwan Salt Vice
President Huang Ching-ju as saying that the company is
considering hiking salt prices by between 10 percent and 15
percent.
</P>
<P>
Huang noted that the company has not raised the price of salt for
over 20 years. Even after the company became privatized, it has
continued the no price hike policy, although soaring world raw
material prices have pushed the cost of production higher since
early this year, according to reports.
</P>
<P>
Chen said he called Taiwan Salt Chairman Lin Ching that day to
point out that salt is a basic daily necessity and that if the
price is raised, it could trigger a wave of price increases of
other daily necessities.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan Salt promised not to raise the price and will explain
other complementary measures, Chen added.
</P>
<P>
According to reports, Taiwan people consume around 100,000 tons
of salt a year. Even after the opening to foreign salt imports in
2004, salt produced by Taiwan Salt still has a domestic market
share of 85 percent.
</P>
<P>
Salt products account for only 47 percent of Taiwan Salt's
revenues. But as the prices of salt have been kept low, low net
profits have been registered for salt, although products the
company has diversified into, such as cosmetics, have seen much
healthier profits.
