The Legislative Yuan gave its final approval to a law amendment
Tuesday, allowing the police to devote more manpower to stepping
up rule of law.
</P>
<P>
Lawmaker Wu Yu-sheng, who proposed the draft amendment, said that
its passage will permit the police authorities to shift more
manpower to maintaining social order from their previous
household population checks.
</P>
<P>
According to Wu, police officers spend at least 20 hours per
month checking households. With the policy shift, an additional
3,341 policemen can be deployed each month to help maintain
public order, he said.
</P>
<P>
In the future, he said, policemen will strengthen their checks of
criminals on parole, those who have had sentences commuted and
those who are listed as prone to crime, instead of spending time
on checking up on families.
