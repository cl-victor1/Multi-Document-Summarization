Taipei,  June 5 (CNA) 06/05/07  19:12:58 (By Y.F. Low)
</P>
<P>
The Legislative Yuan passed an amendment to the Mental Health Law
Tuesday to protect the rights of mental patients.
</P>
<P>
The amendment saw the removal of an article in the original law
that allowed for the chemical castration of mental patients.
</P>
<P>
The amended law forbids people from deserting mental patients,
abusing patients physically or mentally, leaving mental patients
with self-care disability in dangerous environments, coercing or
beguiling the patients into marriages, committing crimes against
the patients and using the patients to commit crimes.
</P>
<P>
Offenders can be fined up to NT$150,000, with their names being
publicized, while the authorities can also require that offenders
accept domestic education and guidance lessons for up to 50
hours, the law stipulates.
</P>
<P>
In addition,  the  law  prohibits  the media  from  using
discriminatory references and descriptions while making reports
about mental illness.
</P>
<P>
Reports that are not based on fact and those that can mislead
their readers or audience into discriminating against mental
patients are also forbidden, according to the law.
</P>
<P>
Media organizations that violate these rules can be fined up to
NT$500,000 and can be ordered to make corrections. Those who fail
to comply within a deadline can be fined repeatedly, the law
stipulates.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the law states that health authorities around the
country should set up community mental health centers that will
be responsible for educating the public about mental health,
training mental health professionals,  providing counseling and
transfer services for mental patients and carrying out the
prevention and control of suicide and substance abuse.
</P>
<P>
Ruling Democratic Progressive Party Legislator Wang Jung-chang
said the amendment is the first step toward the development of
community-based mental health care, in the hope that an up-to-
date model can be established to serve the needs of mental
patients.
