<P>
Taiwan is expected to retain its third-place ranking in terms of
foreign exchange reserves, ahead of South Korea's, officials of
the Taipei-based Central Bank of China (CBC) said Monday.
</P>
<P>
CBC officials made the prediction on the eve of its announcement
of the nation's foreign exchange reserves as of the end of May.
</P>
<P>
As the CBC has in recent days continued to sell its U.S. dollars
to stem a further slide in the New Taiwan dollar against the
greenback, May's foreign exchange reserves are expected to be
further down from those in April, although still be higher than
South Korea's, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
South Korea announced Monday that its foreign exchange reserves
stood at US$250.74 billion as of the end of May, up US$3.48
billion from the end of April.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan's foreign exchange reserves stood at NT$266.54 billion at
the end of April, ranking third in the world behind only China --
which stood at US$1.2 trillion at the end of March -- and Japan's
US$915.6 billion at the end of April.
