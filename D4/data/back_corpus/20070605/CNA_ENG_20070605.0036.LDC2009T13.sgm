Taipei,  June  5 (CNA) 06/05/07  20:36:01 (By Sofia Wu)

A majority of respondents to a public opinion poll complained
about lingering economic doldrums, declining income, inflating
consumer prices and the widening wealth gap, pollsters said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
According to the results of the survey conducted by the China
Times, a Taipei- based Chinese-language daily, 69 percent of the
respondents said they feel the domestic economy is in bad shape,
while 21 percent said the economy is "so-so," and only 4 percent
gave the economy a positive review, with 6 percent refusing to
answer the question.
</P>
<P>
The telephone poll was conducted from May 30-June 1 among
randomly chosen adults, with 829 valid samples collected and a
margin of error of 3.5 percent recorded.
</P>
<P>
Compared with the findings of a similar survey conducted by the
newspaper in mid-February, the ratio of those who perceived the
economy as "sluggish" rose 21 percent while the percentage of
those who felt the economy was "in good shape or robust"
decreased 13 percent.
</P>
<P>
The survey findings marked a sharp contrast to official growth
figures. According to statistics released by the government, the
country's gross domestic product (GDP) posted a 4.15 percent gain
year-on-year in the first quarter of this year.
</P>
<P>
Superficially, Taiwan's economy has continued to grow, but the
poll found that few respondents are upbeat about their economic
well-being. According to the poll results, 47 percent said they
are worried about a possible decrease in their real household
income; 36 percent said they expect their family income to remain
almost the same as last year; while only 9 percent said they
think their income is likely to increase.
</P>
<P>
While the government has often touted a steady decline in the
unemployment rate, but fear of job losses has continued to haunt
many wage earners. The survey results show that 54 percent of the
respondents said they are afraid of losing their jobs, compared
to 43 percent who said they have no such worries.
</P>
<P>
Asked about their views on the current consumer price levels, 56
percent said they can hardly endure the present upward spiral; 32
percent said they perceive the price hikes to be moderate; 7
percent said they feel the price levels have remained almost
unchanged; and only a tiny number of respondents said they feel
consumer prices are falling.
</P>
<P>
The increasing wealth gap between rich and poor is now widely
perceived, according to the poll. Up to 88 percent of those
surveyed said they think the rich-poor gap has been widening
seriously while only 5 percent said the problem is not very
serious.
</P>
<P>
Asked about Taiwan's current socio-economic structure, 56 percent
perceived themselves as middle class in the social hierarchy,
compared to 1 percent who perceive themselves as upper class and
35 percent who said they are at the bottom of society.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, 81 percent said they agree with the comment that
Taiwan's middle class has disappeared, with wealth getting more
concentrated among fewer people, while the poor are getting
poorer. However, 11 percent said they disagree with the
observation.
</P>
<P>
Generally speaking, 46 percent said their current livelihoods are
roughly same as the previous year; 40 percent said their living
standards have declined and only 13 percent said their living
quality has improved.
</P>
<P>
As for major obstacles to Taiwan's economic development, 42
percent said "government inaction due to partisan strife" is the
most serious problem hindering economic development; 32 percent
said official corruption and incompetence  is to blame;  7
percent attributed the current woes to international competition;
and 6 percent said cross-Taiwan Strait issues are the main
hindrance.
</P>
<P>
Economists also attributed the gap between bright economic growth
figures and bleak popular perception to a combination of factors,
including the country's excessive reliance on exports for
economic growth, relocation of a number of manufacturing
industries to China and other areas to lower production costs,
flagging private consumption and investment, zero growth in
salaries for a large number of wage earners; and most of the
economic growth benefits enjoyed by capitalists and corporate
owners.
