INT'L COMMUNITY URGED TO BACK TAIWAN'S WHO BID
</HEADLINE>

New York,  May 5 (CNA) 05/06/07  17:10:09 (By Huang Chao-ping and

A Taiwanese diplomat stationed in New York has called on the
international community to throw its support behind Taiwan's bid
to join the World Health Organization (WHO), saying that as a
sovereign state, Taiwan has the right to become a WHO full
member.
</P>
<P>
Andrew L.Y. Hsia, director-general of the Taipei Economic and
Cultural Office (TECO) in New York, made the remarks at a news
conference he called after attending an annual urban hiking
activity organized by a local ramblers association to back
Taiwan's WHO bid.
</P>
<P>
As Taiwan is making a bid for entering the international health
body under the name of "Taiwan" this year, Hsia said the TECO has
organized Taiwanese expatriates to join the annual Hudson River
Valley ramble to help the international community better
understand Taiwan's current situation and the need for the nation
to become a member of the WHO.
</P>
<P>
Led by Hsia and two TECO deputy directors-general, over 200
Taiwanese expatriates took part in the ramble around Manhattan
Island, wearing black T-shirts printed with "WHO + Taiwan" and
"Be WHO" to show Taiwan's determination to pursue WHO membership.
</P>
<P>
While passing China's general consulate in New York,  the
participants waved Republic of China banners and chanted "Cheer
up! Taiwan, " and "WHO needs Taiwan." Officials from the
Government Information Office's outpost in New York also made and
distributed leaflets on Taiwan's WHO bid to passers-by.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the New York branch of the North American Taiwanese
Medical Association (NATMA) and the TECO in New York are
scheduled to co-sponsor a seminar on Taiwan's bid to join the WHO
May 11 at the Donnell branch of the New York City Library.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan's former Health Minister Twu Shiing-jer  and ruling
Democratic Progressive Party's international affairs department
head Chen Chung-hsing will also attend the seminar to discuss
issues related to the importance of Taiwan's full membership in
the Geneva-based international health body.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan has sought to join the World Health Assembly (WHA) , the
WHO's decision- making arm, as an observer since 1997, but has
seen little progress due to China's obstruction. At the WHA
gathering last year, Taiwan's hopes of joining the organization
were dashed for the 10th consecutive year when the WHA General
Committee decided not to include Taiwan's bid on the assembly's
agenda.
</P>
<P>
This year, Taiwan decided to apply for full WHO membership under
the name of "Taiwan, " in addition to continuing pursuit of WHA
observership. The annual WHA conference is scheduled to open May
14 in Geneva.
