The digital divide between male and female citizens over 50 years
of age in the country has increasingly widened despite the
government's efforts to narrow the gap between cities and rural
areas, officials from the Council for Economic Planning and
Development (CEPD) said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
CEPD officials  quoted  the results  of a 2006 survey on
individual/household digital divide conducted by the Research,
Development and Evaluation Commission as indicating that the
Internet penetration rate among female citizens aged over 50 was
roughly 10 percent lower than that of male citizens in the same
age group.
</P>
<P>
The digital divide between female and male citizens aged between
21 and 50 was 2 percent, according to the same survey, CEPD
officials said.
</P>
<P>
Due to the fact that most female citizens aged over 50 have
focused their time and energy on the home, the government will
take the initiative in pushing the private sector to sponsor more
training courses or workshops for female citizens to enable them
to learn to surf the Internet so that they can share information
and knowledge via Web portals and even craft their own careers
through the Internet, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
They noted that 61 digital  opportunity  centers  are now
operational islandwide, and it is expected that another 62 will
be established this year under a sub-plan included in the 2015
Economic Development Project.
</P>
<P>
The officials added that age and gender differences are major
factors determining the character of the digital divide, although
other  factors, including  personal  incomes  and  educational
backgrounds, have also played decisive roles in Internet
penetration rates.
