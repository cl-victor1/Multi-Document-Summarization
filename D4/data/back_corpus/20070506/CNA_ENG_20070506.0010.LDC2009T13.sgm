LEGISLATIVE COMMITTEE TO REVIEW ABSENTEE VOTING AMENDMENT
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taipei, May 6 (CNA) 05/06/07  17:04:06 (By Deborah Kuo)
</P>
<P>
The legislative Home and Nations Committee is scheduled to review
a draft amendment Monday calling for the inclusion of regulations
governing absentee voting in the President and Vice President
Election and Recall Law.
</P>
<P>
The opposition Kuomintang (KMT) and the People First Party (PFP)
have co- authored six versions of the draft amendment, including
a version calling for the inclusion of absentee voting and a
version calling for studies on whether an administrative vote
recounting mechanism should be activated in the event that one
candidate wins the presidential election by a razor-thin margin.
</P>
<P>
Both the KMT and the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)
claim that they will mobilize all resources and go all out to
defend their positions on the draft amendments.
</P>
<P>
KMT Legislator Wu Chih-yang, a convenor of the Home and Nations
Committee, said that although all of the KMT and the PFP
legislators will be present at Monday's review, the KMT still
hopes that the ruling DPP will engage in discussions with the
opposition parties on the six versions in a rational manner,
instead of engaging in an irrational battle against the draft
amendment.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, DPP Legislator Chang Ching-hui, another Home and
Nations Committee convenor, said that none of the six versions is
acceptable to the DPP given their controversial content.
</P>
<P>
Chang added that the DPP will not budge an inch in the face of
the KMT-PFP attempt to force passage of the draft amendment with
a majority that would also be bolstered by the votes of
independent legislators.
