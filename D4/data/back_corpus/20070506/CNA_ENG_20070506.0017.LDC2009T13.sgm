Day, which falls on May 13 this year.

He encouraged local people to take action to help others and draw
inspiration through helping others.

will join forces to create a warmer society and lead to a happier
life for all of the people in Taiwan.

He stressed that although most of the award winners are from
impoverished families, they have never cared much about what they
possess but rather about helping others, adding that the spirit
of sacrificing oneself for others is commendable.
