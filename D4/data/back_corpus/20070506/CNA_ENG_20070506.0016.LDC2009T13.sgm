A fire that broke out on the Pengjia Islet off the northern port
city of Keelung around Saturday noon and lasted for 11 hours
damaged an estimated of 40 hectares of land, an area equivalent
to one-third of the islet, city firefighting department officials
said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The cause of the fire is still unclear, but according to a
preliminary investigation, experts have not ruled out the
possibility that it was caused by the high-temperature exhaust of
low-flying military aircraft crossing the area, or induced by
discarded cigarette  butts,  according to officials of the
Keelung City Department.
</P>
<P>
The department  personnel  sent fire engines to the scene
immediately after receiving an emergency call around 12:10 p.m.,
but due to insufficient water supplies, the fire spread very
quickly, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
The fire was brought under control after nearly 11 hours with
assistance from the national airborne emergency relief center.
</P>
<P>
As the fire spread so rapidly that a large amount of land was
burned. Nevertheless, the officials said, lighthouses,
Meteorological Stations, and coastal patrol facilities in the
area were unaffected, adding what the fire consumed was mostly
wild grasses and weeds.
