<P>
President Chen Shui-bian urged all Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) members to cast their votes Sunday in the DPP presidential
primary, thereby enabling the ruling party to field the strongest
candidate in the 2008 presidential election.
</P>
<P>
Chen appealed to the DPP members, who number 254,000, to make a
wise choice in the presidential primary so that the DPP can field
a candidate capable of enabling the DPP to remain in power.
</P>
<P>
The ruling DPP launched  its presidential  and legislative
primaries simultaneously Sunday, with 60 percent, or around
150,000 of the DPP members, expected to turn out to vote.
</P>
<P>
Chen cast his votes at a polling station located at the Zhongshan
Football Stadium in downtown Taipei in the company of his son and
daughter-in-law.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the polling station, Chen reminded the four DPP
presidential hopefuls and all party members that rivals in the
primary would be comrades and partners to form a united front
against the opposition challenger in the presidential election
since there will only be one DPP hopeful nominated to represent
the DPP in the 2008 race.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated the importance of unity,  saying that while
competition is within party members' rights, unity is both their
duty and their responsibility.
</P>
<P>
Balloting for the presidential and legislative primaries are
scheduled to wrap up at 4 p.m. Sunday while the results of the
member voting should be known by 10 p.m. the same day, DPP
officials said.
</P>
<P>
Members' votes in the presidential and legislative primaries
Sunday will account for 30 percent of the hopefuls' total score,
while a string of public opinion polls to be conducted between
May 9-11 will account for the remaining 70 percent in deciding
the party's candidates for the presidential and legislative
elections.
</P>
<P>
In selecting the party's candidates for at-large legislative
seats, member voting will account for 40 percent of the hopefuls'
score, while the public opinion polls will account for 60
percent.
</P>
<P>
The results of the DPP's presidential primary should be known by
May 12 at the earliest, DPP officials said.
</P>
<P>
The four DPP presidential aspirants -- Vice President Annette Lu,
Premier Su Tseng-chang, DPP Chairman Yu Shyi-kun and former
Premier Frank Hsieh -- have gone all out to win the primary as
results of the primary voting are expected to influence the
results of subsequent public opinion polls.
</P>
<P>
Of the four, Su and Hsieh have traded barbs and insults with each
other on the eve of the primary in a spate of heated political
rhetoric.
</P>
<P>
In terms of numbers of DPP members, Taipei County tops the list
with more than 35,000 members, followed by the municipalities of
Taipei and Kaohsiung, with more than 30,000 members each.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the ruling DPP has established desks at the 126
polling stations nationwide to collect signatures of supporters
for holding of national referendums on the issues of retrieving
the "ill-gotten" assets held by the opposition Kuomintang and on
Taiwan's bid to join the United Nations under the name of
"Taiwan."
