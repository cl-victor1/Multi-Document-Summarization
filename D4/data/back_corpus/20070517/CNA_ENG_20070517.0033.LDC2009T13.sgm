<P>
A six-year project to survey deep-ocean biodiversity has produced
fruitful results, recording 80 new species and 523 species found
for the first time around Taiwan, the National Science Council
(NSC) announced Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The project, under the auspices of the NSC, has deployed
oceanologists from local universities and research institutes
aboard four ocean  research  ships conducting  375 specimen-
gathering expeditions since 2001, according to the NSC.
</P>
<P>
Among the 603 species documented, 40 new species and 207 newly
found in Taiwan are fish, while crustaceans account for 43 new
species and 170 newly found ones, mollusks for 57 new or newly
found species, and echinodermata for 78 newly found species.
</P>
<P>
Chen Tian- jen, a professor at the Institute of Marine Biology of
Taiwan Ocean University and also a co-author to the project
report, noted that the results indicate the versatility of
maritime species around Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
"The number of species of caelorinchus and munidopsis found near
Taiwan tops the world, " he continued. "Taiwan has also recorded
one- fourth to one-third of all lobster and panulirus species
discovered so far, while the number of hermit crab species found
near Taiwan equals to one-eighth of all recorded to date."
</P>
<P>
Chen added that there four major international projects on
biodiversity -- Census of Marine Life, Barcode of Life, Tree of
Life and Encyclopedia of Life -- and that the NSC project has
applied to join the first two and to notify the latter two of its
findings.
