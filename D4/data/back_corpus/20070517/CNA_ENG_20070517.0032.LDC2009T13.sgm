The Taipei-based drumming group U-Theater will present its
revised production of "A Touch of Zen" May 17 and 20 at the
National Theater in Taipei City, the group's Artistic Director
Liu Ruo-yu said Thursday.

<P>
The performance, which had an original but imperfect production
in 2005, tries to create a combination of the group's drumming
and the martial arts of Shaolin Temple monks, Liu said.
</P>
<P>
In order to better mingle the music and martial arts, Liu gave
the Shaolin members the task of counting the beats, which was
difficult, as it disturbed their kung fu performance during
rehearsals.
</P>
<P>
Liu said she hopes audiences will see the new production, which
she said has new ideas,  better  stage  effects  and perfect
performances.
</P>
<P>
The group will tour Hsinchu, Taichung, Tainan and Kaohsiung after
its Taipei performances, Liu said.
