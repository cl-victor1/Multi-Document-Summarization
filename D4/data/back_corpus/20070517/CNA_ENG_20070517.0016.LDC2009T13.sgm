The first front of this year's plum rain season is expected to
bring a wet week to most parts of Taiwan and raise the curtain on
the spring rainy season, the Central Weather Bureau (CWB)
forecast Thursday.
</P>
<P>
CWB meteorologists noted that as a result of the stationary
front, rain had already begun to fall in central and northern
Taiwan Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The plum rain fronts usually occur in spring through early to
mid-summer. Formed by moist air over the Pacific meeting the
cooler continental air mass, it often brings prolonged
precipitation to Japan, Korea, Taiwan and eastern China.
</P>
<P>
The CWB weather experts predicted that from May 19, heavy rain
will fall in northern, northeastern, eastern and central Taiwan,
as well as on the outlying islands of Penghu, Kinmen and Matsu.
</P>
<P>
They warned that these areas may see gusty winds and lightning
strikes.
</P>
<P>
They also said that a tropical depression that formed south of
Guam Wednesday was moving westerly at 15 kph and that CWB staff
will monitor its movement.
