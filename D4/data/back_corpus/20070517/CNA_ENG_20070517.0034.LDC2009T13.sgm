Outgoing Premier Su Tseng-chang traveled to the southern county
of Tainan Thursday, where he vowed to his supporters and friends
that he will engage in closer contact with members of the "deep
fabric of Taiwan society" once he quits office.
</P>
<P>
Su, who stunned the nation with his resignation last Saturday,
less than a week after he lost the ruling Democratic Progressive
Party (DPP) primary for the 2008 presidential election to his
predecessor Frank Hsieh May 6, paid a visit to Yen Chun-min, head
of the Su Tseng-chang's Friends Society in Tainan County.
</P>
<P>
Su told Yen that after losing the DPP primary, he conceded defeat
peacefully, saying that he did not try hard enough in the
contest.
</P>
<P>
He said that now the primary is over, all the hatchets should be
buried and added that he will wholeheartedly throw his support
behind Hsieh to enable the DPP to retain power after the 2008
presidential race.
</P>
<P>
President Chen Shui-bian appointed former Premier and Straits
Exchange Foundation Chairman Chang Chun-hsiung Monday to succeed
Su after accepting Su's resignation. A change-over ceremony is
scheduled to be held at the Executive Yuan May 21.
