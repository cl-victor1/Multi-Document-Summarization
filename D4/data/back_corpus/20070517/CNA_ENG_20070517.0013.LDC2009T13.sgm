Taipei,  May 17 (CNA) 05/17/07  16:37:22 (By Y.F. Low)

President Chen Shui-bian announced Thursday his plan to join a
group of young volunteers in cleaning up marine oil spills near
Hsiaoliuchiu, an islet off southern Pingtung County, to mark the
anniversary of his inauguration May 20.
</P>
<P>
Making the announcement in the latest issue of his online
newsletter, Chen said he wants to offer his encouragement to the
volunteers  for their  unselfish devotion  to protecting  the
environment.
</P>
<P>
Chen noted that more and more people in Taiwan, including a
number of young people and students, have begun taking part in
volunteer services since the government started to promote the
idea of "volunteer Taiwan" in 2001.
</P>
<P>
The trend is reflected in National Youth Commission (NYC) tallies
that show that the number of people under the age of 30 involved
in NYC volunteer activities increased from 8,963 in 2002 to
27,071 in 2006, Chen pointed out.
</P>
<P>
"Obviously, being a happy volunteer is no longer just a slogan.
Instead, it's becoming a very important part of many of our
schedules," he said.
</P>
<P>
The president said that like in past years, he will not hold any
grand celebrations and will instead do volunteer work on his
inauguration anniversary this year.
</P>
<P>
Chen noted that besides helping clean up the Paishawan Beach
resort last year, he has engaged in various types of volunteer
work over the past seven years, including serving at a car wash
center, a nursing home for the elderly, a home for the mentally
challenged, a mental development center for mentally challenged
children and teenagers, and a recycling station.
</P>
<P>
"With respect for life and care for others, every drop of sweat
from engaging in volunteer work has turned into the sweetest
fruit, " he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Chen said that after doing volunteer work near
Hsiaoliuchiu during the daytime on May 20, he will return to his
hometown -- Tainan County's Kuantien township --  to watch a
children's drama that night.
</P>
<P>
The event is part of the Paperwindmill Theater's performance tour
around Taiwan's 319 townships under the charitable "First Mile,
Kid's Smile" project aimed at enhancing rural children's exposure
to performing arts, Chen noted.
</P>
<P>
The tour, which began in Chiayi County's Alishan township Jan. 3,
is scheduled to reach its 20th stop in Kuantien township May 20,
Chen said.
</P>
<P>
The president said he has contributed NT$10,000 for each of the
performances staged or scheduled to be staged in 19 townships,
including Kuantien, in the hopes that more people will take part
in the sponsorship program.
