TAISUGAR URGED TO RELEASE STOCK TO MEET LOCAL DEMAND

Taipei,  May  17  (CNA) 05/17/07  23:26:41 (By Elizabeth Hsu)

Economics Minister Steve R. L. Chen instructed the state-owned
Taiwan Sugar Corp. (TaiSugar) Thursday to release its maize and
soybean stocks and increase its cooking oil output to help the
government stabilize commodity prices.
</P>
<P>
Chen gave the order during a meeting of the Ministry of Economic
Affairs (MOEA) for talks about recent price fluctuations in the
country due to raw material price increases in the international
market.
</P>
<P>
Factors including the new Taiwan dollar's depreciation against
the U.S. dollar and the euro, and international wholesale crop
price fluctuations caused by weather and supply-demand changes,
have affected sales of raw materials, Chen said, indicating that
this is what has been driving increases in local consumer product
prices.
</P>
<P>
According to MOEA statistics, the wholesale price of maize in the
international market increased by 48.33 percent in April compared
with the same month of the previous year, while that of barley
grew by 50.38 percent, that of soybean rose by 20.21 percent and
that of wheat jumped by 38.01 percent.
</P>
<P>
Prices of waste paper and paper pulp also increased, the tallies
show. Counting in US dollars, the prices of imports posed a year-
on-year growth of 7.61 percent in April, and if counted in NT
dollars, import prices recorded a 10.41 percent rise.
</P>
<P>
As a result, prices of household products like instant noodles,
cooking oil and toilet paper have risen quietly, Chen said,
noting that thanks to international sugar price drops, as well as
declines in prices of locally produced fruit and vegetables, the
consumer price index registered a slight year-on-year growth of
0.67 percent in April.
</P>
<P>
While the current prices of domestic agricultural products are
stable, the government will respect market mechanisms, allowing
reasonable commodity price adjustments based on international
price fluctuations, Chen said, although he warned that price
ramping will be punished.
