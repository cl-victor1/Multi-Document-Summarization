CABINET SECRETARY-GENERAL-DESIGNATE VOWS TO SOLVE BUDGET IMPASSE
</HEADLINE>

Taipei, May 17 (CNA) 05/17/07  18:18:41 (By Lilian Wu)

Executive Yuan Secretary-General-designate Chen Chin-jun said
Thursday he is confident that he can help break the impasse
between the ruling and the opposition parties over the central
government budget.
</P>
<P>
Chen, a three-term legislator before he became deputy minister of
Transportation and Communications April 23, was seen as a
surprise choice in the latest round of Cabinet  members  unveiled
by Premier-designate Chang Chun-hsiung.
</P>
<P>
Chen, widely seen as a protege of President Chen Shui-bian, said
Chang inquired about his intentions a day earlier. He said he was
unaware that his designation was the result of wrangling between
different factions within the ruling Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) amid reports that Lin Hsi-yao, who is closely associated
with outgoing Premier Su Tseng-chang, was replaced by him at the
last minute.
</P>
<P>
Noting that one of the main tasks of his new post will be to
coordinate with the Legislative Yuan, Chen vowed that he will
communicate with his former colleagues in the legislature with
"the utmost sincerity" and that he will "promote cooperation to
replace confrontation."
</P>
<P>
Chen said he is not thinking of his appointment in terms of a
promotion and said he will do his best in every post.
</P>
<P>
The 2007 budget should have been passed at the end of last year
by the legislature, but remains stalled until now because the
ruling and opposition parties have been at loggerheads over the
Organic Law of the Central Election Commission.
