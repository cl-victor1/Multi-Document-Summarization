SANATORIUM WILL SURVIVE, FOR AT LEAST A WHILE
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  April  11 (CNA) 04/11/07  23:33:59 (By Y.C. Jou)

<P>
The Losheng Sanatorium will not be immediately demolished after
the previously set April 16 deadline, Taipei County Magistrate
Chou His-wei said Wednesday after Premier Su Tseng-chang promised
in a meeting with patients and preservationists to find
solutions.
</P>
<P>
However, Chou claimed that the Executive Yuan should take full
responsibility for any delay in the opening of Hsinchuang Line of
the Taipei metro system caused by its policy change.
</P>
<P>
The Hsinchuang leprosarium, which still houses several dozen
patients, was completed in 1930 by Japanese colonizers; it is now
in the way of a Taipei metro depot construction project.
</P>
<P>
The campaign to preserve the leprosarium for the sake of the
patients' human rights and its own historical and cultural value
has increasingly gathered momentum over the past few weeks, as
April 16 was set as the date after which the Taipei County
Government could, at any time, conduct a forceful demolition of
most of the buildings and relocate those patients who refuse to
move.
</P>
<P>
Patients and preservationist were able Wednesday to speak face to
face with Su after holding three protests outside of the
premier's residence since early March.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting Su promised that the government would do its
utmost to promote the adoption of a project option that would
retain 90 percent of the existing compound while still avoiding a
delay to the opening of the metro line, Cabinet spokeswoman Chen
Mei-ling said.
</P>
<P>
Chen said it will take one or two months for the Cabinet-level
Public Construction Commission to communicate with Taipei County
Government and Taipei City's Department of Rapid Transit Systems
(DORST) to work out a solution acceptable to all parties
concerned.
</P>
<P>
The current plan would retain 41.6 percent of the existing
4-hectare compound, but preservationists argued that it would
destroy the oldest and most valuable parts of the sanatorium.
</P>
<P>
Preservationists welcomed Su's response, but said the plan to
hold a parade this coming Sunday afternoon, starting at the
Chiang Kai-shek Memorial Hall, to voice support for the
preservation of Losheng will not be changed.
