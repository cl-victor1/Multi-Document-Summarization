KMT HEAVYWEIGHTS CALL FOR UNITY
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Taipei,  April 11 (CNA) 04/11/07  19:41:09 (By Flor Wang)
</P>
<P>
Main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Honorary Chairman Lien Chan
called Wednesday for "unity and cooperation" among party members
to embrace victory in future elections.
</P>
<P>
Lien issued the call during a ceremony at the KMT headquarters in
which Wu Poh- hsiung took over the helm of the party after
winning a landslide in a chairmanship by-election last week.
Former Chairman Ma Ying-jeou and KMT- affiliated Legislative Yuan
Speaker Wang Jin-pyng were also present.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the 2008 presidential election, Lien stressed the
need for unity if the KMT hopes to take back power. Taiwan has
markedly moved backwards over the past seven years, he said.
</P>
<P>
"As long as every party member is able to speak out frankly and
sincerely for the sake of Taiwan's interests, democracy and
future, there is nothing which cannot be achieved, " Lien said,
expressing his hope that all party members will fully support the
yet to be formed KMT presidential ticket.
</P>
<P>
Lien hailed Wu as a "wise,  broad-minded,  courageous and
enthusiastic" man capable of leading the KMT forward.
</P>
<P>
Ma praised the recent KMT chairman by-election as a "gentleman's
race," and called Wu's election a deep reflection of the party's
wide ethnic diversity. Wu is a Hakka Taiwanese.
</P>
<P>
Ma, who enjoys widespread public support and is the most likely
KMT candidate to run in the next presidential contest, reiterated
that he will invite Wang to serve as his running mate -- in
keeping with an agreement forged between Ma and Wang in prior
negotiations mediated by Lien and Wu -- if he wins the party's
nomination.
</P>
<P>
"The KMT cannot afford another split in the 2008 presidential
election," Ma insisted.
</P>
<P>
For his part, Wu promised to make an all-out effort to serve the
KMT and the country and called for all comrades' backing and
cooperation as fierce challenges are ahead of the party.
</P>
<P>
"The KMT should apologize to the Taiwan people who have suffered
setbacks in many fields due to its defeat to the Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) in the 2000 presidential election due to
a split, " Wu said, adding that he is prepared "to help pair up a
most qualified KMT ticket in the coming presidential race."
</P>
<P>
"Both Ma and Wang are fair-minded and the KMT's great assets," Wu
said.
</P>
<P>
"From now on, let's forget all the unpleasant in the past and
embark on a new beginning," he added.
</P>
<P>
Wang, who said a day earlier that he would issue a statement
clamoring for continuous and visionary KMT reform Wednesday at
Wu's inauguration ceremony, fell short of doing so, and only
congratulated Wu on his election and voiced hope that the KMT
could secure a victory in December's legislative election and the
2008 presidential election.
</P>
<P>
The legislative speaker said Tuesday that he would spell out to
the KMT, for its own good, something from the depths of his heart
because the party cannot apply one set of rules to others but a
different set for itself.
</P>
<P>
Ma and Wang were strong  opponents  vying  for the KMT's
presidential nomination, but Wang failed to pick up a
registration form to take part in the party's presidential
primary while Ma did -- a development which means that Wang is
out of the primary. But it remains unclear whether Wang would
form with Ma a KMT presidential ticket.
</P>
<P>
Speculation has arisen that Wang might choose to run as an
independent in the 2008 presidential election.
