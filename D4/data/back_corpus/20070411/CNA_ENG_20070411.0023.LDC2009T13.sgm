Taipei,   April  11  (CNA) 04/11/07  19:24:27 (By Han Nai-kuo)

<P>
The Legislative Yuan's Sanitation, Environment  and Social
Welfare Committee passed Wednesday  an amendment to the Mental
Health Law of 1990, seeking to provide better protection of the
rights of mental patients.
</P>
<P>
The amendment would add new clauses to penalize those who abandon
family members with mental illnesses, mistreat them physically or
spiritually, keep them in an environment where they could easily
be harmed, or force them to marry.
</P>
<P>
Violators of the proposed new clauses would be subject to a fine
of between NT$30,000 and NT$150,000. In addition, authorities may
publicize the names of the offenders and require that they
receive eight to 50 hours of counseling on family education at a
fee.
</P>
<P>
The amendment would also abolish a provision in Clause 30 that
allows teaching hospitals to perform chemical castrations on
mental patients through a long- acting implant of hormonal drugs.
</P>
<P>
The proposed change is based on arguments that forced chemical
castration violates the rights of mental patients, and new drugs
are available to provide more effective treatment.
