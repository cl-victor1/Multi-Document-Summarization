The outcomes of the U.S. and Taiwan presidential elections in
2008 will not change the United States' longstanding "one China"
policy, U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice said Tuesday
</P>
<P>
Responding to reporters' questions at the State Department, Rice
said the United States expects that neither China nor Taiwan will
take any steps to unilaterally change the status quo in the
Taiwan Strait.

<P>
The news conference was held for journalists from around the
world taking part in the Edward R. Murrow Program for Journalists
sponsored by the International Visitor Leadership Program.

Asked if the U.S. policy of providing Taiwan with weapons for its
self-defense needs would change if cross-strait tensions were
triggered by moves by Taiwan toward de jure independence, Rice
said that Washington expects both sides of the Taiwan Strait to
respect the "one China" policy, adding that "we have obligations
under the Taiwan Relations Act to help Taiwan defend itself, and
we will carry out those obligations through the military
cooperation that we have with Taiwan."
</P>
<P>
Rice said she does not believe that anyone would benefit from the
outbreak of conflict in the Taiwan Strait, adding that Washington
has repeatedly stated its polices regarding the Taiwan Strait and
has made clear that it supports cross- strait dialogue and cross-
strait interactions.
</P>
<P>
"There actually is a lot of trade and economic development across
the straits, and I think that is also a buffer against conflict,"
she continued.
</P>
<P>
"It's my very strong view that this should not and will not
change as a result of '08 because it's been a standing policy of
the United States for many, many years," she added.
