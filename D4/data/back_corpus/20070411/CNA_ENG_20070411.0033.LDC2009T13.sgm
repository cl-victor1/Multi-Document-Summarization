TAIWAN ASTRONOMERS OBSERVE STAR FORMATION TRIGGERED BY MASSIVE
STARS

Two local astronomers have observed and proved for the first time
that existing massive stars can trigger the formation of a series
of new stars, verifying a longstanding hypothesis of such a
possibility, sources at National Central University (NCU) said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The findings have been published by the U.S.-based monthly "The
Astrophysical Journal" in its March issue.
</P>
<P>
Lee Hsu-tai and Chen Wen-ping, both from NCU's Institute of
Astronomy, had searched the skies for evidence supporting the
hypothesis for several years before discovering in early 2006
that two separate stars, in the constellations Orion and Lacerta,
had "helped" the formation of young stars within a radius of
several hundred light-years.

<P>
During an interview with members of the local press earlier this
week, Lee explained that the astronomers have long proposed the
possibility that the radiation emitted by a massive star -- which
by definition means one with a mass of at least ten times that of
the sun -- could compress the molecular clouds around it and
prompt the formation of low- and intermediate-mass stars inside
the condensed clouds.
</P>
<P>
In independent observations of the two massive stars, the
astronomers found that the massive stars had each "pushed" back a
vast patch of cloud -- leaving traces of either bright-rimmed
clouds or comet-shaped ones, and that some stars already existed
in between the massive stars and the vast clouds, with other
stars forming inside the bright-rimmed and comet-shaped clouds.
</P>
<P>
Lee noted that the age of the new stars are in inverse proportion
to their distance from the massive star, which means those nearer
to the massive star have existed for a longer period of time.
</P>
<P>
"Such a distribution of age-distance demonstrates that these
smaller stars are gradually brought into existence by the massive
one, " Lee added.
