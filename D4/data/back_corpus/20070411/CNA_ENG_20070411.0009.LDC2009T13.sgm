Several executive members of the state-run Chunghwa Telecom Co.
Workers' Union petitioned Wednesday against the management's
ongoing "inhumane" movement to lay off workers in a drive to
streamline the company.
</P>
<P>
In front of the Legislative Yuan, the protesters chanted slogans,
such as "foreign investors profiteering, workers wailing, " while
calling for the Ministry of Transportation and Communications
(MOTC), which holds a 36-percent stake in the company, to replace
its designated chairman, Ho Chen-tan, who they claimed has been
using "inhumane" means of all kinds since 2006 to lay off workers
in order to "please" foreign investors.
</P>
<P>
In the streamlining movement, Ho ordered that 1,600 workers be
laid off in a two-week period at the start of this month,
Chunghwa Telecom Workers' Union Secretary-General Chuang Ping-
tang said.
</P>
<P>
Under the directive, Chuang noted, executives of various Chunghwa
Telecom units were assigned "a layoff quota" which forced them to
press "targeted" workers to leave by all possible means,
including changing workers' positions at will and forcing public
service personnel into marketing the company's products.
</P>
<P>
Chuang said a 48-year-old technician at Chunghwa Telecom's
generator room in Fengshan, Kaohsiung County committed suicide by
hanging last September because of the workplace pressures. Tan
left behind a wife, young daughters and elderly parents.
</P>
<P>
Legislator Lai Shin-yuan of the opposition Taiwan Solidarity
Union received the petition on behalf of her party and criticized
the company which generates annual profits of around NT$40
billion (US$1.2 billion) for its violation of an agreement that
it signed with the workers' union in 2005 when it began the
process of privatization. The agreement stipulates that no
workers are to be laid off within five years of its signing.
</P>
<P>
The Chunghwa Telecom Workers' Union demanded that the MOTC
replace Ho at once, otherwise it will mobilize 5,000 members to
stage a protest at the ministry headquarters May 1.
