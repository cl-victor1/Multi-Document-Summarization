New  York,  Sept.  20  (CNA) (By Huang Kwang-chun)
</P>
<P>
The European Atomic Energy Community (EURATOM), the atomic energy arm
of the European Union, on Sept. 19 became a member of the Korean
Peninsula Energy Development Organization (KEDO), the international
organization which is supplying a light-water reactor project,
including two nuclear reactors, to North Korea.
</P>
<P>
A press release issued by KEDO says that EURATOM's accession to KEDO
sends a strong signal of EU support for the organization and its
activities. EURATOM will contribute 75 million ECUs to KEDO over five
years, it reveals.
</P>
<P>
With this support, it continues, EURATOM will be represented on KEDO's
executive board, which had previously consisted of the organization's
original members -- the United States, Japan and South Korea.
</P>
<P>
KEDO was established in 1995 for implementing most of the "Agreed
Framework" signed by the US and North Korea in 1994.
</P>
<P>
The Agreed Framework addresses international concerns about nuclear
activities in North Korea. If implemented, it will assure both North
Korea's full compliance with its safeguards agreement with the
International Atomic Energy Agency and the complete dismantlement of
those aspects of North Korea's nuclear program, including
reprocessing-related facilities that have undermined the viability of
the international nuclear non-proliferation regime and the stability
of the Asia-Pacific region.
