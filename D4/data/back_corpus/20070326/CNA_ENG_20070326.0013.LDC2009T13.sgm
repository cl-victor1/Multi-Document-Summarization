Local manufacturers are generally more reserved about Taiwan's
economic situation, but they are more optimistic about the
economy in the latter half of the year, according to the results
of a survey released Monday.

The Taiwan Institute of Economic Research (TIER), a local think
tank which conducted the survey, said manufacturers who said the
economy will improve were down by 0.9 percent from a similar
survey conducted in January, while those who said the economy
will worsen increased by 11.6 percent.

<P>
Asked about their predictions for the economy in the latter half
of the year, the manufacturers who said it will improve increased
to 56.7 percent from 36 percent in January, while those who felt
it will deteriorate slipped to 10.5 percent from 12.4 percent in
January.

<P>
The officials noted that as prices of raw materials have slumped,
purchasing costs are not as heavy as previously expected.
