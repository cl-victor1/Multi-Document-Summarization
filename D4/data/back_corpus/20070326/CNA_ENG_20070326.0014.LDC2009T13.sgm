The intersection of Roosevelt Road and Keelung Road was the most
dangerous one in Taipei City, with over 45 traffic accidents
recorded there in 2006, the Taipei City Police Department
reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The figure drew criticism from Taipei City Councilor Chen Chien-
min, who blamed the high frequency of accidents at the
intersection -- with 54 cases recorded so far since the beginning
of this year -- on the installation of a bus lane on Roosevelt
Rd.
</P>
<P>
Chen said the bus lane has resulted in even more congestion at
the traffic circle and accused the city government of failing to
properly plan the bus lane.
</P>
<P>
Noting that there were over 1,000 traffic accidents at the city's
36 most dangerous intersections last year, Chen said the figure
proves the flaws in the installment of traffic facilities in
Taipei and demanded an overall review of city traffic.
</P>
<P>
Also rounding out the top-10 dangerous intersections list were
Zhongshan North Road and Civic Boulevard, Civic Boulevard and
Chengde Road, Renai Road and Dunhua Road, and Civic Boulevard and
Chongqin North Road, with each registering more than 45 traffic
accidents last year.
</P>
<P>
The others were the intersection of Zhongshan North Road and the
Jiantan MRT station, Minguan West Road and Yanping North Road,
Chongqin South Road and Aiguo West Road, Dingzhou Road and Shida
Road, and Changan East Road and Jianguo North Road.
</P>
<P>
The city road with the most traffic accidents in 2006 was
Zhongzheng Road with 299 cases, followed by the sixth section of
Minguan East Road, Minguan West Road, Beian Road, the fourth
section of Bade Road, the fifth section of Zhongxiao East Road,
Minsheng West Road, the fourth section of Chengde Road, the
fourth section of Zhongxiao East Road, and Songjiang Road,
according to the police report.
