Former opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Ma Ying-jeou

also declared that he will stump for Wu in the round-up to the
April 7 chairmanship by- election in his capacity as a "party
member."

The seat was left vacant after Ma resigned from the post Feb. 13
following his indictment on charges of embezzling from a special
allowance fund designated for his discretionary use while serving
as Taipei mayor from 1998 to 2006.

Ma has claimed his innocence, argued that he had no intention of
breaking the law, that he considered the fund to be "private
money" as it has been regarded by other government executives who
receives similar funds.

In the news release, Ma said the by-election will determine
whether or not the KMT will win the year-end legislative
elections, and that it is a key to having the largest opposition
party win the presidential election in 2008. "No party members
have the right to be absent in the campaign, nor to stand aside,
" he said, calling for other members' support of Wu, an
experienced politician.

Wu is facing a challenge from Legislator Hung Hsiu-chu, who is a
member of the KMT Standing Committee, in the chairmanship battle.
