The domestic manpower supply in the biotechnology industry in the
three-year period from 2007 to 2009 is expected to exceed demand,
with 8,810 people expected to be fighting for 3,105 positions, an
assistant researcher at the government-run Development Center for
Biotechnology (DCB) said Monday.

Chen Li-min made the assessment at a conference attended by
representatives of the Executive Yuan's Science and Technology
Advisory Group, the Industrial Technology Research Institute, the
Institute for Information Industry and the DCB to conduct a
general review into the supply and demand of technology talent in
Taiwan's semiconductor, visual display, digital content,
telecommunications, biotech and information services sectors from
2007-2009.

Chen said that although the future manpower supply in the biotech
sector will not have a problem of insufficiency, basic research
will take the lion's share of manpower, which will need to
undergo an improvement in their professional skills.

In addition, the sector has long suffered a lack of marketing and
management talent experienced  in promoting  business  in the
international market, she said, suggesting that biotech
businesses set up practice training channels with overseas
companies and research institutes while seeking professionals
overseas in an effort to address the problem.
