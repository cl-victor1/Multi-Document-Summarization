<P>
The central government will provide NT$20 million (US$603,682)
needed for the Keelung mayoral by-election slated to be held May
12, Premier Su Tseng-chang said over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
The remarks came after the premier visited acting Keelung Mayor
Chen Chung-kuang Sunday at the Keelung city government building
in northern Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Su promised Chen that the government will provide the budget for
the by-election and any necessary assistance the acting mayor
requires to ensure the smooth operations of the city government.
</P>
<P>
Chen took the post after Mayor Hsu Tsai-li died of a stroke last
month.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the by-election was unexpected and requires a large
amount of money, Su said that he made the decision to contribute
after discussions with the chief of the Directorate General of
Budget, Accounting and Statistics (DGBAS).
