A Japanese man, his wife and his daughter found dead in their
rented house in Taipei City probably died from carbon monoxide
poisoning, police reported Monday.

Police said the man, whose name was not divulged, was an
executive stationed in Taiwan by a leading Japanese company.

A prosecutor, coroner and officials from the Japan Interchange
Association, the quasi-official organization authorized to handle
relations with Taiwan in the absence of official ties, were also
enlisted to help with the incident.

Police said neighbors of the Japanese family alerted police after
becoming aware of an offensive odor over the course of several
days.

Police said that as the deceased showed no signs of external
injuries, they suspected that carbon monoxide could be the cause
of death.
