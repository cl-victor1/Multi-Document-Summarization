The business and industry sectors do not oppose a government plan
to raise the minimum wage, but hope that the government  will
make local laborers its top priority,  Chang Ping-chao, chairman
of the General Chamber of Commerce of the Republic of China, said
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Chang noted that the chamber does not want to see the minimum
wage hike benefit only foreign laborers.
</P>
<P>
The Council of Labor Affairs has invited representatives from
business and industry sectors, as well as laborer representatives
to attend a meeting slated for early April to discuss the issue,
Chang added.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Chang proposed to the Executive Yuan that it
establish a business research institute, which he claimed would
be beneficial to developing Taiwan's economy, upgrading the
quality of the service industry, and raising business production
values.
