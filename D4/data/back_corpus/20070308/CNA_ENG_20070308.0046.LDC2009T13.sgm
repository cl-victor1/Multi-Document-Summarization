Taipei,   March  8  (CNA) 03/08/07  23:59:14 (By Sofia Wu)
</P>
<P>
Government Information Office (GIO) Minister Cheng Wen-tsang said
Thursday he is optimistic that the controversy over a recent AP
report on Vice President Annette Lu's presidential bid will soon
be brought to a happy end.
</P>
<P>
Cheng was referring to a March 6 AP story that quoted Beijing's
derogatory criticism of Lu in reporting her bid to become
Taiwan's first female presdient.
</P>
<P>
The article, written by Min Lee, an AP reporter from Hong Kong,
sparked a local political storm after it was posted on the CNN
Web site under the headline "Taiwan's 'scum of the nation' runs
for president."
</P>
<P>
The legislative  caucuses  of both  the ruling  Democratic
Progressive Party and its pro-independence ally -- the Taiwan
Solidarity Union -- have urged relevant government agenices to
revoke Lee's work visa and expel him as a persona non grata.
</P>
<P>
Cheng  said  the GIO has lodged  protests  with  the two
internationally renowned U.S.-based news organizations and has
received initial positive response from them.
</P>
<P>
According to Cheng, AP has expressed willingness to give Lu an
interview which would allow her to expound on her presidential
campaign themes.
</P>
<P>
On the proposal to expel the AP reporter, Cheng said neither the
GIO nor the vice president thinks the government should adopt
such a drastic move at the moment since the government has
consistently upheld the freedom of the press and respected media
professionals' rights to news coverage.
</P>
<P>
Lu said earlier in the day that her protest has received initial
response from the two media outlets, with CNN's chief executive
officer in charge of its online edition agreeing to write her a
letter on its handling of the incident and AP promising to give
her an interview.
</P>
<P>
As to the proposal to expel the reporter, Lu said extremism could
miss the mark.
