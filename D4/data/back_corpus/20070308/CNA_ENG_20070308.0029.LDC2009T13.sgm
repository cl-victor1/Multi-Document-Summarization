DPP LAWMAKERS WANT CKS MONUMENT RENAMED DEMOCRACY HALL

Taipei,  March 8 (CNA) 03/08/07  19:49:28 (By Flor Wang)

The Chiang Kai-shek (CKS) Memorial Hall in downtown Taipei must
be renamed as the "Taiwan Democracy Memorial Hall," a group of
ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) lawmakers demanded
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The lawmakers, including Yu Cheng-tao, Lee Ming-hsien and Huang
Wei-cher, issued their demand at a Legislative Yuan news
conference.
</P>
<P>
Demanding that the CKS Memorial Hall be re-designated as the
"Taiwan Democracy Memorial Hall" April 5 -- the 31st anniversary
of the death of the late President Chiang Kai-shek, the DPP
legislators also demanded that the massive statue of Chiang be
removed from within the hall.
</P>
<P>
Lee urged John Chiang, Chiang's grandson and a lawmaker of the
main opposition Kuomintang (KMT), to relocate the statue to
Chiang's mausoleum in Tahsi township in northern Taoyuan County.
</P>
<P>
The Taipei city government's decision to list the CKS Memorial
Hall -- which is only 27 years old -- as a "historic monument" is
ridiculous and a reflection of a politically motivated move, Lee
said.
</P>
<P>
In line with a name change campaign recently rekindled by the DPP
and the central government to underscore Taiwan's distinct
identity, the Ministry of Education has been studying the
feasibility of pulling down the walls of the CKS Memorial Hall
complex, supposedly to make it "more accesible to the public."
</P>
<P>
But the plan has met resistance from the city government, which
argues that the central government would be violating law if it
insists in pressing ahead with it without city government
approval.
</P>
<P>
The CKS Memorial Hall is a major tourist attraction and leisure
area in Taipei.
