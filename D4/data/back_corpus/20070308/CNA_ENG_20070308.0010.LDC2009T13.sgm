Taipei,  March 8 (CNA) 03/08/07  13:00:17 (By Maubo Chang)

Opposition Kuomintang acting Chairman Wu Poh-hsiung announced in
Hsinchu City Thursday that he will enter the party chairmanship
race to fill the shoes of Ma Ying-jeou who resigned from the post
in early February.
</P>
<P>
Wu said that he originally had no intention of joining the race
but then decided to throw hat in the ring when he realized he had
an obligation to make the sacrifice.
</P>
<P>
Wu's decision spares the party the embarrassment of having no
candidates vie for the post of party chairman as yet in the by-
election slated for April 7. Ma resigned from the chairmanship
Feb. 13 just hours after being indicted on corruption charges.
</P>
<P>
As the first KMT vice chairman, Wu was forced to take the reins
of the party as the acting chairman until the by-election.
</P>
<P>
Pointing  out that being party  chairman  means a lot of
responsibility and pressure, Wu said he will do the best job he
possibly can if elected to the post. He further said that if
elected, it will be the last public post that he holds.
