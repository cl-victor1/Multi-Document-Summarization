<P>
Former Premier Frank Hsieh pledged Thursday that he will seek to
help maintain Taiwan's stability and peace by promoting reform
and cooperation, and by putting an end to political bickering.
</P>
<P>
Hsieh made the promise while speaking to a group of supporters
after registering his candidacy for the presidential primary of
the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP).
</P>
<P>
Accompanied by his wife, former vice premier Yeh Chu-lan and 10
DPP founding members, Hsieh completed his registration for the
party's presidential primary at the DPP headquarters.
</P>
<P>
Claiming that it is a part of Taiwan's spirit to make the best of
"limited resources" to create "unlimited chances", Hsieh cited
himself as an example as saying that although he is now jobless,
he will nonetheless put his limited resources to good use in
order to win the DPP's nomination for the 2008 presidential
election.
</P>
<P>
Hsieh said it was he who proposed that the party be named the
"DPP" and that whenever the DPP faced difficulties, he has always
offered to help the party overcome adversity by bringing the
party's founding spirit fully into play.
