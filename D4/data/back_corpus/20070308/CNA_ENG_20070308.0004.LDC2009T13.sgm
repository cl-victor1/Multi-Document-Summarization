Premier Su Tsen-chang bestowed stems of colorful eustomas to Vice
Premier Tsai Ying-wen and other female members of the Cabinet
Wednesday on the eve of Women's Day.
</P>
<P>
Noting that eustoma symbolizes warmth, Su said he wants to convey
his respect and gratitude to all of his female colleagues by
presenting them with the beautiful Eustoma grandiflorum.

<P>
In connection with celebrations of March 8 Women's Day, the
Cabinet reviewed the government's campaign for better protection
of women's rights at its weekly meeting Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
After a briefing by Interior Ministry officials on progress in
the promotion of women's rights and interests, Su said the
campaign for better welfare services for women and upgrading of
women's status has made substantial progress since the Democratic
Progressive Party took power in 2000.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Su said there is still ample room for improvements
in women's rights protection and promotion. For one thing, Su
said, an innovative way of thinking and measures should be
adopted to achieve a breakthrough in ensuring gender equality in
the workplace. While many women are equally capable as their male
counterparts, they tend to enjoy less financial remuneration and
far fewer promotion opportunities compared to their male
colleagues.
</P>
<P>
Relevant government agencies should also come up with more
considerate, attentive measures to effectively protect women from
falling victim to violence and other criminal activities.
</P>
<P>
The premier also encouraged local citizens to buy flowers as
gifts for their loved ones or friends in celebration of upcoming
Women's Day.
</P>
<P>
"By so doing, we are also supporting our floral farmers to expand
their market turnover," Su said, adding that thanks to local
farmers' efforts, Taiwan's flower exports have grown
significantly in recent years. Annual production of butterfly
orchids, oncidium orchids, lilies and eustomas -- Taiwan's four
major floral export items -- has exceeded NT$4 billion, with
floral plantation acreage exceeding 13,000 hectares.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan's flower production amoutned to NT$12.5 billion in 2006
and floral exports totaled about NT$2.53 billion, both marking a
9 percent year-on-year growth.
