Taipei, March 8 (CNA) 03/08/07  15:39:59 (By Deborah Kuo)
</P>
<P>
Taipei prosecutors Thursday sought a prison sentence of 30 years
and an unprecedented fine of NT$1.71 billion (US$52.13 million)
for fugitive tycoon Wang You-theng.
</P>
<P>
Wrapping up their investigation into the high-profile scandal
involving  Wang's Rebar  Asia Pacific  Group and the alleged
embezzlement of billions of dollars by Wang and his wife from
Rebar assets that left a number of Rebar Group companies
bankrupt, the prosecutors also indicted 106 other people involved
in the scandal on charges of violating stock trade law and other
irregularities.
</P>
<P>
The prosecutors are also seeking a prison term of 28 years and a
fine to the tune of NT$710 million for Wang's wife, Wang Chin
She-ying.
</P>
<P>
Two of Wang's sons -- Wang Ling-yi and Wang Ling-tai -- also face
28 years in jail, while Wang Shih-chan, a younger brother of
Wang, faces 15 years.
</P>
<P>
Wang and his wife first fled to China late last year and then to
the United States in January.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan officials have tried in vain to persuade the U.S.
authorities to deport Wang from Los Angeles so he can face
charges, but he remains in detention at a San Pedro immigration
holding center for illegal entry into the United States, where he
has been incarcerated since Feb. 2.
