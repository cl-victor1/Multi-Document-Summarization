CHINESE ANTI-SECESSION LAW BACKFIRES: US STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Washington,   April   15   (CNA) (By Oliver Lin &amp; Maubo Chang)
</P>
<P>
Chinese enactment of its Anti-Secession Law has backfired on the
Chinese government, an official from the State Department said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Under Secretary for Political Affairs R. Nicholas Burns, told the
Congress's Committee on Armed Services and Committee on International
Relations that the Anti-Secession Law is very much against the spirit
of what should promptly be the relationship across the Taiwan Straits,
and that's the peaceful means of resolving disputes, not the threat of
force or the use of force.
</P>
<P>
Burns said the law had the impact of creating some doubt within the
European Union (EU) about whether or not the embargo of arms sales to
China should be lifted, and added US argument that the embargo should
be maintained.
</P>
<P>
Burns said the EU has now taken the time to consider the larger
implications of lifting the embargo, and the US State Department
doesn't belief that the EU is close to a decision to lifting the
embargo.
</P>
<P>
Burns said the US response to the Anti-Secession Law is vigorous and
very clear, and the Chinese government is aware of US interest in
seeing that the disputes across the Taiwan Straits are handled only in
a peaceful manner, and therefore there is no need at this point to
take any punitive action in the economic realm to express US
unhappiness with the Anti-Secession Law.
