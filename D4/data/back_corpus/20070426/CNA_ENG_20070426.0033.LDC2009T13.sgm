TAIWAN CONCERNED WITH EU ANTI-DUMPING TAXATION AGAINST PET
</HEADLINE>

Geneva,  April 26 (CNA) 04/26/07  19:46:02 (By Neil Lu and

<P>
Taiwan has expressed concern to the World Trade Organization
(WTO) over the European Union's decision to continue imposing
anti-dumping tax against polyethylene terephthalate (PET)
imported from Taiwan, officials from Taiwan's Representative
Office to the WTO said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
In a WTO anti-dumping committee meeting earlier in the week,
Taiwan also refused to accept a decision formed early this year
in the EU's sunset review of anti- dumping duties on Taiwan-
produced PET, and denied what the EU claims is deliberate dumping
by Taiwan, the officials noted.
</P>
<P>
The EU began the anti-dumping taxation against Taiwan PET in
2000, with PET imports from Taiwan's Far Eastern Textile Co.
facing a 3.5 percent tariff and those from Shinkong Textile Co.
slapped with a 6.5 percent tariff.
</P>
<P>
In 2005, the EU started the sunset review targeting the ruling.
