TAIWAN FIRM ON WHO MEMBERSHIP BID: DOH OFFICIAL
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Taipei,  April 26 (CNA) 04/26/07  19:03:29 (By Flor Wang)

<P>
Taiwan stands firm on its bid to pursue membership of the World
Health Organization (WHO) , despite remarks made by a WHO
official denouncing Taiwan's application, a government official
said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
According to Chang Wu-shiu, director-general of the Bureau of
International Cooperation under the Cabinet-level Department of
Health (DOH) , the government will not deviate from its goal of
becoming a full WHO member, even though its latest bid was
crushed by the WHO a day earlier.
</P>
<P>
A WHO official called Taiwan's application a "non-issue" late
Wednesday and said that the WHO will not deal further with it
after thorough study and legal consultation, on the grounds that
Taiwan is ineligible  to apply for membership, which requires
statehood recognized by the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the DOH has yet to verify the remarks by the WHO
official to determine whether his comments represented the WHO's
official stance concerning Taiwan's membership bid, Chang said
that the government will continue soliciting support of its bid
from the member states of the World Health Assembly (WHA) -- the
WHO's highest decision-making unit.
</P>
<P>
The issue pertaining to Taiwan's WHO membership is up to the WHA
member states to decide, Chang said.
</P>
<P>
In an April 11 letter sent to WHO Director-General Margaret Chan,
President Chen Shui-bian stated the country's desire to join the
WHO as a full member under the name of Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) Acting Spokeswoman
Yeh Fei-bi said that the ministry had not received WHO
notification of the bid rejection.
</P>
<P>
Despite the setback, Taiwan remains committed to pursuing its WHO
membership and seeking support from allied countries to back its
bid, Yeh said in a routine news conference.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time the government has applied to enter the
WHO in the name of Taiwan in more than a decade, she added.
