The Bureau of Investigation (BOI) burned 265 kg of various drugs
seized by law- enforcement personnel over the past year Thursday
as a prelude to the 2007 National Anti-Drug Conference slated for
June 3.

<P>
Minister of Justice Shih Mao-lin presided over a public ceremony
at the incineration, which was monitored by Chien Han-liang of
the Taiwan High Prosecutor's Office, as well as Ling Li-yi, a
consultant to the John Tung Foundation, Miao Yi-fan, deputy
secretary-general of the Consumers' Foundation and Teng Chao-
fang, chief executive officer of the Foundation for Poison
Control.

<P>
According to the BOI, the drugs named as criminal evidence by the
court which ordered their destruction included 242.54 kg of
heroin, 21.29 kg of marijuana, 691.24 g of morphine and 1,175.86
g of cocaine.
</P>
<P>
It was the largest amount of drugs the BOI has destroyed since
1993, when the bureau opened an office to store and manage
narcotic evidence. The destruction has been since then conduced
once per year in accordance with the annual anti- drug
conference, the BOI said.

<P>
A BOI analysis on drug offenses shows that the amount of ketamine
recovered in the past two years recorded two-fold growth, while
marijuana gained in popularity among office workers and people in
show business.
