FOREIGN MINISTER CONFIRMS RE-ESTABLISHMENT OF TAIWAN-ST. LUCIA
TIES
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  April 26 (CNA) 04/26/07  16:22:27 (By Elizabeth Hsu)

Minister of Foreign Affairs James Huang reconfirmed Thursday a
revelation the day before that his Saint Lucian counterpart  has
announced the eastern Caribbean island nation's decision to re-
establish diplomatic ties with Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Huang expressed the hope that the two nations can sign a
communique marking the official re-establishment of ties as soon
as possible and said his ministry is working to complete all the
relevant follow-up procedures.
</P>
<P>
Premier Su Tseng-chang said Wednesday that Saint Lucia has become
Taiwan's 25th diplomatic ally after Saint Lucia's minister of
foreign affairs announced the news. Su described the resumption
of diplomatic ties with Saint Lucia as one of the most
encouraging news events since he assumed the premiership early
last year.
</P>
<P>
In response to reporters' questions, Huang said that while
negotiating for the resumption of Taiwan-Saint Lucia ties, Taiwan
never once asked the island nation to severe its diplomatic
relations with China. And Saint Lucia has no intention of doing
so, he added.
</P>
<P>
Asked about the anticipated protest from Beijing, Huang stressed
that diplomacy is "not a zero-sum game." He added that Taiwan
does not want to compete with China, its political rival, in the
diplomatic field, pointing out that "all we hope is that the two
sides of the Taiwan Strait will expand their respective
diplomatic territory on their own."
</P>
<P>
Huang said it is no secret that Taiwan has been seeking to re-
establish diplomatic relations with Saint Lucia.
</P>
<P>
Over the past four months, Huang said, he made two separate
visits to the country, including one in March at the invitation
of his Saint Lucian counterpart.
</P>
<P>
The East Caribbean nation first established diplomatic ties with
Taiwan in 1984 but then switched diplomatic recognition to China
in 1997.
