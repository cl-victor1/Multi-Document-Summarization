Taipei, April 26 (CNA) 04/26/07  18:03:48 (By Deborah Kuo)

Defense Minister Lee Jye said Thursday that it is not within the
Ministry of Defense's assessment whether U.S. forces will come to
Taiwan's aid in the event of military conflict across the Taiwan
Strait.
</P>
<P>
Saying that the Republic of China military will defend the
country independently without depending on any outside support,
Lee said the U.S. forces would be welcomed if the United States
is willing to extend a helping hand, but that Taiwan will never
harbor that kind of expectation.
</P>
<P>
Lee made the remarks in an interpellation session at the
Legislative National Defense Committee, during which opposition
Kuomintang Legislator Su Chi asked Lee about the Defense
Ministry's countermeasures to the Chinese military's "lean and
mean, limited but precise" warfare mindset.
</P>
<P>
The defense minister responded that the ROC military has the same
mindset, adding that "we have always planned and prepared based
on the tactical targets that have been maintained by the Chinese
military."
</P>
<P>
As to the design of the annual Han Kuang Exercise program, Lee
said, the military has taken drill policies against the worst-
case scenario in order to hone the armed forces' combat ability
to handle the most undesirable situations.
</P>
<P>
In response to Su's accusation that the war games conducted by
the military have been tampered with politically, Lee said the
military has kept its political neutrality and has allowed no
"backstage manipulation."
