CABINET HOPES LEGISLATURE WILL PASS PENSION PROGRAM BILL
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taipei, April 26 (CNA) 04/26/07  19:06:58 (By Lilian Wu)
</P>
<P>
The Executive Yuan will send a draft bill on a national pension
program to the Legislative Yuan next week, hoping that it will
pass the bill quickly, Cabinet spokeswoman Chen Mei-ling said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Chen Mei-ling made the remarks after President Chen Shui-bian
said earlier the same day during an inspection tour in Kaohsiung,
southern Taiwan that he has asked the Executive Yuan to study the
issue of raising the monthly allowance for elderly farmers by
NT$1,000 (US$30) to NT$6,000 if the proposed bill fails to clear
the legislature by July.
</P>
<P>
The Executive Yuan recently said that in view of current
financial strain and the promotion of a national pension program,
it would not favor an increase of the monthly stipend for elderly
farmers.
</P>
<P>
Asked if President Chen's remarks run counter to that of the
Executive Yuan's stance as well as a resolution reached at a
national economic development conference last year, the
spokeswoman said the Cabinet's stance on "no increase prior to
the implementation of the national pension program" remains
unchanged.
</P>
<P>
She said the Executive Yuan will do its best to communicate with
the Legislative Yuan, hoping for speedy passage of the draft
bill.
</P>
<P>
The Council of Agriculture (COA) has estimated that around
700,500 elderly farmers receive monthly allowances of NT$5,000.
If they were to get an additional NT$1,000, it would cost the
government an extra NT$8.4 billion annually.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, lawmakers from across the party spectrum were
unanimous in supporting the increase for farmers.
</P>
<P>
Legislator Ker Chien-ming, a caucus whip of the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party, said the party still hopes that the national
pension program should be given priority, but added that if the
bill cannot clear the legislature by July, then raising the
monthly allowance for farmers is also an option.
</P>
<P>
Legislator Hsu Shao-ping, a caucus whip of the main opposition
Kuomintang, said a hike of NT$1,000 is acceptable to the party.
</P>
<P>
Recent reports said the Executive Yuan hopes the draft pension
bill can clear the Legislative Yuan by November so that the
program can be put into practice in January 2008.
</P>
<P>
Under the draft bill, insured persons who start to pay a monthly
premium of NT$618 at the age of 25 will be entitled to a monthly
pension of NT$7,603 when they reach 65.
</P>
<P>
The bill will cover those aged 25-65 who are currently not paying
military, civil servant, teacher or labor insurance, as well as
farmers under 65. It is estimated that 3.53 million will be
included in the national pension program.
</P>
<P>
The draft bill also calls for the integration of four current
monthly allowances -- the NT$3,000 monthly allowance for seniors,
the NT$5,999 for elderly farmers, the NT$3,000 for aboriginal
seniors and the NT$6,000 for seniors in low-income households.
</P>
<P>
Once the national pension program is implemented, the allowances
for the four groups will be scrapped so as to prevent political
parties from proposing increases in allowances ahead of every
election to curry favor with voters, thus exacerbating the
government's already strained financial situation.
