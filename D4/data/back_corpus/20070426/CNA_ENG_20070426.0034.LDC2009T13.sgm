Taipei,  April 26 (CNA) 04/26/07  20:02:58 (By Lilian Wu)

<P>
A long-term dispute over the funding of a Tainan underground rail
project was settled Thursday after Premier Su Tseng-chang gave
his word Thursday that the Tainan city government will only have
to shoulder 12.5 percent of the cost.
</P>
<P>
Su, who is bidding to represent the ruling Democratic Progressive
Party (DPP) in the 2008 presidential election, met with Tainan
Mayor Hsu Tain-tsair and legislators from the southern city.
</P>
<P>
The premier said the city government will only have to shoulder
12.5 percent, or NT$3.7 billion of the total budget, with the
central government providing the balance.
</P>
<P>
According to an estimate by the Ministry of Transportation and
Communication (MOTC) , a budget of NT$29.58 billion (US$896.36
million) is required to make a 7.55-km section of the railway in
the city run underground.
</P>
<P>
Su expressed hope that construction of the project can start soon
so that further city development will not harm the preservation
of the numerous heritage sites in the city, which is dubbed as
Taiwan's "cultural old city."
</P>
<P>
Tainan proposed the project to the Executive Yuan in 2004 but it
never got off the ground because both the central and city
governments could not afford the cost.
</P>
<P>
The MOTC asked the city to put up NT$7.14 billion, but the
financially strapped local government complained that it could
not afford to.
</P>
<P>
The city government even suggested that the central government
make available the full amount needed for the project, or else
allow the city government to repay the central government at a
rate of either NT$2.5 billion over 15 years or NT$4 billion over
25 years.
