EPA TO SCREEN EXPRESSWAY CONSTRUCTION PROJECT NEXT MONTH
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,    April   21   (CAN) 04/21/07  18:24:35 (By Lilian Wu)
</P>
<P>
The  Environmental  Protection Administration (EPA) said Saturday
that it will convene another meeting to screen a controversial
expressway construction project in eastern Taiwan next month at
the earliest.
</P>
<P>
EPA officials made the remarks after President Chen Shui-bian
said earlier the same day at the opening of an environmental
protection conference that construction of the Suhua expressway
linking Suao and Hualien is necessary for the sake of balanced
development of western and eastern Taiwan but that a prerequisite
for its construction is the project passing an environmental
impact assessment.
</P>
<P>
The president's remarks drew flak from the representatives of
environmental protection groups taking part in the conference,
who vowed to step up lobbying of the members of a 21-member
environmental impact task force in an effort to stop the project
from going forward.
</P>
<P>
EPA officials noted that during the first screening meeting in
January, 10 members on the environmental impact assessment task
force raised questions about the project's impact on the local
ecology, geographic fault, economy and culture.
</P>
<P>
The EPA has therefore asked the Ministry of Transportation and
Communications (MOTC) to address their misgivings before April
30, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
They further said that if the MOTC can provide the necessary
details by next week, the second screening meeting will be held
as early as the beginning of May.
</P>
<P>
Chiou Lin-bin, director general of the MOTC's National Expressway
Engineering Bureau, said Saturday that if the Suhua expressway
project is aborted, the goal of establishing an islandwide
expressway network will not be able to be achieved.
</P>
<P>
He said that his bureau has envisioned the National Expressway
No. 5, which currently runs between Nankang, Taipei and Suao,
Yilan, stretching to cover the section between Suao and Hualien
and then extending to Taitung in the long run.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the current railway transportation system in
eastern Taiwan can hardly relieve the traffic congestion on the
present Suao-Hualien Highway and that upgrading the railway
system will not solve the problem.
