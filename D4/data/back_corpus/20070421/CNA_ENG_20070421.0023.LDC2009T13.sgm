A 29-year-old Taiwan man will kick off a cross-continent "Bike-
To-Protect-Our- Planet" cycling journey from Beijing Sunday to
help raise public awareness of the need for joint efforts to slow
global warming, organizers said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Hsueh Teh-jui said he plans to cycle across Asia and most of
Europe to reach Paris in six months to promote his cause.
</P>
<P>
The "Eurasia cycle tour" has been jointly organized by himself
and the Taipei- based Environmental Quality Protection Foundation
(EQPF) to inspire more people to contribute to global efforts to
lower greenhouse gas emissions so as to slow global warming,
Hsueh said.
</P>
<P>
In June 1901, Hsueh said, five people drove from Beijing to Paris
to spread the message that the age of the automobile has dawned.
</P>
<P>
Over the past century, Hsueh said, excessive carbon dioxide
emissions from motorized vehicles has led to drastic climate
changes that may threaten the sustainability of humans and other
lviing species.
</P>
<P>
"This time around, I want to travel the same route by bicycle to
draw attention to the danger that global warming poses and invite
concerted efforts from members of the general public to improve
the situation," Hsueh said.
</P>
<P>
Hsueh, who has completed cycling journeys around Taiwan and
France over the past few years, will start his Eurasia cycling
tour from Tiantan, a Beijing heritage site also known as Temple
of Heaven, and travel westward along the Silk Road to reach
Kazakhstan via Urumqi, capital of the Chinese province of
Xijiang.
</P>
<P>
Traveling at a speed of 80 to 120 kilometers per day, Hsueh said
he is scheduled to arrive at Eiffel Tower in Paris Oct. 15 after
cycling through Russia, Ukraine, Poland,  Germany, Holland and
Belgium.
</P>
<P>
An EQPF spokesman said the foundation throws full support behind
Hsueh's Eurasia concycling journey because they share a common
cause of slowing global warming to protect the natural ecological
systems on the Earth.
</P>
<P>
Up-to-date information about Hsueh's cycling journey will be
posted online at http: //www.deray.org, the spokesman said,
adding that individuals interested in his adventurous tour are
welcome to browse the Web site.
