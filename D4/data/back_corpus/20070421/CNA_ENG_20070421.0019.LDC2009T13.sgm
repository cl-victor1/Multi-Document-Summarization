Taipei,   April  21  (CNA) 04/21/07  20:58:20 (By Elizabeth Hsu)
</P>
<P>
Former opposition Koumintang (KMT) Chairman Ma Ying-jeou
registered Saturday to join the party's primary for the 2008
presidential election.
</P>
<P>
Ma said that if elected president, he will devote himself to
creating a "New Taiwan, " totally different from the one shaped
over the past seven years, by using the power given to the
president by the law and constitutional system. He described his
ideal Taiwan as a country that is "liberal, optimistic, open, and
keen on development."
</P>
<P>
For the registration, Ma handed over NT$7 million (US$211,300), a
sum of money to serve as primary operation fees, and a name list
of 215,168 KMT members who gave their support for his bid to
represent the party in the presidential election.
</P>
<P>
So far, Ma is the only person to register for the KMT primary.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, KMT Chairman Wu Poh-hsiung reiterated his party's
sincerity in carrying out proposals listed in an agreement forged
by the KMT and its political ally, the People First Party (PFP),
Friday.
</P>
<P>
The agreement came after two weeks of negotiations between the
KMT and PFP on the matter of jointly selecting candidates from
the two parties with the best chances of winning in the year-end
legislative elections.
</P>
<P>
Wu made the declaration in response to media inquiries at the KMT
headquarters where he witnessed Ma's primary registration.
</P>
<P>
Wu said  that KMT Secretary-General  Wu Den-yih  has full
authorization to deal with issues concerning the KMT-PFP
cooperation in terms of the upcoming legislative elections and
that the KMT has nothing but sincerity in carrying out every
agreement between the two parties.
</P>
<P>
The KMT and the PFP forged alliance relations Jan. 22 and agreed
to jointly work to select candidates who have the best chances of
winning seats in the legislative elections.
</P>
<P>
The PFP had earlier expressed doubts about the KMT's willingness
to carry out the January agreement and therefore acted not to
cooperate with the KMT during Monday's legislative session,
leading to several draft bills against the KMT, including one on
ill-gotten party assets, being placed on the legislative agenda.
