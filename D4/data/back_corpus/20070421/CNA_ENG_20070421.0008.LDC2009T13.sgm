Taipei,  April 21 (CNA) 04/21/07  14:17:19 (By Sofia Wu)

Taiwan's military has concluded a series of simulated cyber
warfare maneuvers in which the various branches of the armed
forces conducted mock counterattacks on China's coastal military
targets after a simulated surprise attack by China, military
sources said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The round-the-clock five-day computerized warfare simulation that
ended Friday was part of the annual "Han Kuang" series of
combined services military exercises aimed at honing combat
strategies and battlefield management tactics, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
This year's cyber war games also marked the first time that
Taiwan's armed forces have practiced counterattack strategies and
skills in simulated warfare drills, the sources said, adding that
in the mock counterattacks,  Taiwan troops struck coastal Chinese
military targets and booming cities with such weapons as cruise
missiles and short-range ballistic missiles.
</P>
<P>
The military's Joint Operations Command Center,  the Joint
Operations Training Center, and tactical command offices at
various strategic military units took part in the computerized
maneuvers, the sources said, adding that a U.S. delegation,
headed by former Pacific Command Commander-in-Chief Adm. Dennis
C. Blair, was on hand to observe the whole process.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of National Defense is scheduled to brief the press
on the details of the "Han Kuang 23" cyber warfare maneuvers at
its routine news conference next Tuesday, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
According to the sources, the war game scenario was set in 2012
when China, frustrated by Taiwan's long-term resistance against
unification  talks,  decides to  take  advantage  of Taiwan's
procrastination in military arsenal upgrading to accelerate its
push for cross-strait unification by launching an all-out
surprise attack on Taiwan proper and its outlying island of
Penghu.
</P>
<P>
In the first three days of the simulated Chinese invasion, Taiwan
incurred severe human and material losses from China's saturated
ballistic missile assault as well as naval and aerial
bombardment. Afterwards, Taiwan's armed forces managed to get up
to steam to stage counterattacks on China's coastal military
targets and its major cities, causing heavy human casualties and
major destruction.
</P>
<P>
In the warfare scenario, the military strikes not only took a
heavy toll on the economic well-being of both sides of the Taiwan
Strait but also adversely impacted the global economy and caused
a worldwide panic. In the end, the United States and other
Western countries jointly mediated a ceasefire.
</P>
<P>
The simulated war games didn't cover the use of nuclear weapons
or Taiwan military attacks on China's aircraft carrier battle
groups as some media outlets had speculated, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the sources said, the U.S. observation group focused
in particular on assessing the Taiwan military personnel's
"combat spirit" to see whether their morale has been affected by
the prolonged political infighting that has cast a shadow over
society since the transition of power between different political
parties back in 2000.
</P>
<P>
In weighing the military's "combat spirit," the sources said, the
U.S. delegation wanted to determine whether Taiwan would likely
lean toward China and whether any advanced U.S.-built weaponry
systems or sophisticated defense strategies would end up in the
hands of the Chinese communists.
</P>
<P>
Following the completion of the cyber warfare maneuvers, the
sources said, the military will start a five-day psychological
warfare training program aimed at enhancing service members'
combat morale, battlefield adaptability and stress management
abilities.
</P>
<P>
The "Han Kuang" series is the largest-scale combined services
military exercise to be staged in Taiwan every year. In addition
to the computerized war games, it also covers live-fire military
maneuvers, which will be held later this year.
