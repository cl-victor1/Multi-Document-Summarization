Visiting former South African Anglican Church Archbishop Desmond
Tutu and his wife visited Meinung Township in Kaohsiung County
Saturday to have better understanding of Taiwan's Hakka culture
at the invitation of Magistrate Yang Chiu-hsing.

Tutu, awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1984 for his leading role
in the anti- apartheid movement, arrived in Taiwan Wednesday for
a weeklong visit at the invitation of the Ministry of Foreign
Affairs and the Taiwan Foundation for Democracy.

Accompanied by Yang, Tutu and his wife visited producing sites of
oil paper umbrellas, and a cultural center to learn traditional
Taiwanese toys. The couple were treated Hakka food by Yang. The
couple then paid another visit to neighboring Pingtung County at
Magistrate Taso Chi-hung' invitation.

On Friday, Kaohsiung City Mayor Chen Chu hosted a dinner for
Tutu, during which the two of them exchanged ideas on peace and
ethnic reconciliation of harmony.
</P>
<P>
During the dinner, Chen told Tutu that she understands Tutu's
efforts in seeking transitional justice in order to step on the
path of peace in post-apartheid South Africa, as she herself had
served time in prison in the struggle to bring democracy to
Taiwan.

In a prayer at the start of the banquet, Tutu urged the Taiwan
people to face their painful history in order to heal their
wounds and wished for peace and justice for the people of the
country, according to Chen.

Tutu will return to Kaohsiung City Sunday to attend a seminar
with representatives of various religious groups, during which he
and Chen will have a further opportunity to engage in dialogue,
according to the Kaohsiung mayor.
