SPEAKER DENIES CHINA VISIT REPORT
</HEADLINE>

Taipei, Feb. 22 (CNA) 02/22/07  19:56:47 (By Sofia Wu)
</P>
<P>
Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng said Thursday a newspaper
report about his plan to visit China in March is not factual.
</P>
<P>
Wang, who is widely seen as a potential candidate in the 2008
presidential election, made the denial during a community
outreach visit to offshore Penghu County.
</P>
<P>
"I have long worked on a China travel plan, but the timing has
not yet been ripe to make such a visit, " Wang said, adding that
he is still waiting for an opportune time to realize such a plan.
</P>
<P>
Wang was responding to a China Times report that Wang would visit
China in March in his capacity as the head of Taiwan's top
legislative body. According to the Chinese-language newspaper,
Wang would meet with Chinese President Hu Jintao during his
Beijing visit.
</P>
<P>
Wang, a former vice chairman of the main opposition Kuomintang
(KMT), said the report "deviates from truth."
</P>
<P>
The report came a week after a Taiwan prosecutor filed corruption
charges against former Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou, prompting Ma to
quit his post as KMT chairman. Ma has formally announced his bid
for the 2008 presidency.
</P>
<P>
Asked whether he would declare his candidacy for the KMT primary
for the 2008 presidential election after the current Lunar New
Year holiday, Wang said he is still pondering the issue.
</P>
<P>
"I think I need to solicit opinions and views from various social
quarters and grassroots groups before I come to a decision on
whether to throw my hat in the ring," Wang said.
</P>
<P>
The legislative speaker said his visit to Penghu is part of his
grass roots outreach activities during the Lunar New Year
holiday. At noon, he had a lunch meeting with volunteer
firefighters in the Penghu area in his capacity as the head of
the national volunteer firefighting corps.
</P>
<P>
In the company of Penghu County Magistrate Wang Chien-fa and
other local political figures, Wang visited the county's popular
temples to pray for national well-being. Later in the day, he
visited the county government and county council on foot,
receiving a warm welcome from crowds of local residents along the
way.
