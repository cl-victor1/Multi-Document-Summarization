Local biotechnology industry's 2006 turnover reached an estimated
NT$177.2 billion (US$5.37 billion) , marking an 11 percent year-
on-year rise, an Industrial Development Bureau spokesman said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Of the amount, NT$65 billion came from the pharmaceutical sector,
NT$43.2 billion belonged to emerging sectors of the biotechnology
industry, and NT$69 billion came from the medical device industry
which grew rapidly with help from Taiwan's information-technology
industry, the spokesman said.

<P>
The preliminary statistics also show that over the past five
years the yearly growth rate of the island's biotechnology
industry reaches an average of 12 percent. Annual investment in
the industry has remained above NT$20 billion since 2001, and
increased to 25.3 billion in 2005. The 2006 amount was estimated
to be NT$21.013 billion.

The spokesman pointed out that biotechnology was a part of the
"two trillion, twin star" plan. The government set up dozens of
incubation centers to nurture biotechnology companies, and plans
to establish several technology parks to bring the benefits of
the clustering effect to this industry.
</P>
<P>
The government's  three policies  to improve  the island's
competence in this industrial sector include introducing foreign
pharmaceutical  factories to Taiwan,  availing the industry of
advantages derived from the electronic and chemical industries to
produce more and better products, and expanding the international
market for Taiwan's medicines.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that in order to help make Taiwan a powerhouse
in the industry, the government established a number of goals,
including realizing investment of approximately NT$150 billion by
2008, achieving a 25 percent yearly revenue growth rate,
establishing more than 500 biotech companies within 10 years, and
having 18 successful companies in this industry by 2010, the
spokesman said.
