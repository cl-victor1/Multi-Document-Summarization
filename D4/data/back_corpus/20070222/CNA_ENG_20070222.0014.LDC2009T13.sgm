RENEWABLE ENERGY TO COMPRISE 10% OF TOTAL CAPACITY BY 2010: MOEA
</HEADLINE>

Taipei, Feb. 22 (CNA) 02/22/07  17:57:22 (By Zep Hu)

The government has set a goal of increasing the output of
renewable energies to contribute 10 percent of the nation's total
electricity output by 2010, according to the Ministry of Economic
Affairs (MOEA).
</P>
<P>
MOEA officials said Thursday that the 10% goal would require some
5.13 megawatts of electricity capacity, most of which would come
from wind power -- with an estimate output of 2.15 megawatts by
2010.
</P>
<P>
Energy from hydropower, biofuels, and solar power would fill the
remaining supply gap, they said.
</P>
<P>
According to MOEA, taking into account the fluctuations inherent
in wind power, by 2010 that output might result in the generation
of 5.74 billion kilowatt- hours per year, translating into a
market value of NT$11.48 billion.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the annual energy output from wind power would be the
equivalent to that generated by 1.43 million kiloliters of oil.
</P>
<P>
Wind power facilities could also help eliminate the emission of
some 3.45 million tons of carbon dioxide, they added.
