DPP HOPEFUL VOWS TO USE NEW THINKING TO TACKLE CROSS-STRAIT TIES

Taipei,  Feb. 22 (CNA) 02/22/07  23:28:15 (By Sofia Wu)
</P>
<P>
Ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) Chairman Yu Shyi-kun
said Thursday he will use new thinking to address the deadlocked
relations across the Taiwan Strait if he manages to win the 2008
presidential election.
</P>
<P>
Yu, who served as premier between 2002 and 2005, made the remarks
after announcing his decision to run in the DPP primary for the
2008 presidential election earlier in the day.
</P>
<P>
Noting that a country's head of state must be resolute and
visionary, Yu said he believes he is the best person to move
Taiwan forward.
</P>
<P>
While upholding Taiwan's core values, Yu said he will adopt new
thinking and innovative strategy to break the lingering cross-
strait limbo for the sake of national security and stability.
</P>
<P>
Yu is the second DPP bigwig to throw his hat in the ring after
another former premier, Frank Hsieh, declared his candidacy for
the DPP presidential primary last Friday.
</P>
<P>
To ensure electoral fairness, Yu said he will apply for a leave
of absence from the DPP chairmanship after he formally registers
for the party primary.
</P>
<P>
As to his running mate, Yu said he has yet to ponder the issue.
Asked whether he is likely to serve as other DPP aspirant's
running mate, Yu said since he has declared his intention to join
the presidential race, he will not give a thought to such a
possibility for the moment.
</P>
<P>
Yu announced his bid during a visit to the Taoist Tingan Temple
in Tungshan township in northeastern Yilan County where he served
as magistrate for two terms from 1989-1997.
</P>
<P>
"I choose to make the important announcement in Yilan because
friends in my homeland have always been my best support
throughout my political career," Yu said.
</P>
<P>
Registration for the DPP presidential primary will be open from
March 5-9, according to a timetable passed by the party's Central
Standing Committee last Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Party members will vote on both presidential and legislative
hopefuls May 6, after which public opinion polls will be held.
The votes of party members are weighted to comprise 30 percent of
a would-be candidate's score, while the public opinion poll
counts for 70 percent. The presidential aspirant who receives the
highest approval rating will be named as the party's presidential
candidate May 30.
</P>
<P>
It remains to be seen whether  or when another  two DPP
heavyweights -- Vice President Annette Lu and Premier Su Tseng-
chang -- will announce their presidential bid.
</P>
<P>
In the opposition camp, only former Kuomintang Chairman Ma Ying-
jeou has thrown his hat in the ring.
