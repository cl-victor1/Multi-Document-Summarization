TAIWAN'S NAME RECTIFICATION CAMPAIGN NOT U.S. CONCERN:
CONGRESSMAN
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Washington,  Feb. 21 (CNA) 02/22/07  21:51:59 (By Lin Chiehyu and
Sofia Wu)
</P>
<P>
U.S. Congressman Tom Tancredo has sent a letter to Secretary of
State Condoleezza Rice criticizing what he called the State
Department's  overreaction to Taiwan's "name rectification"
efforts.
</P>
<P>
In his Feb. 20 letter to Rice, Rep. Tancredo writes: "First, it
is rather difficult to understand how a decision about what the
name of a local business might be in Taiwan is any of the State
Department's concern. Second, for the State Department to equate
the renaming of a gas station with a change Taiwan's
international status is, to say the least, rather puzzling."
</P>
<P>
Tancredo was referring to Taiwan's recent decision to rename
three of its state- owned enterprises to get rid of Chinese
reference in their titles and add the word "Taiwan" to make them
more identifiable with their country of origin and avoid
confusion with similarly named Chinese counterparts.
</P>
<P>
Referring to China's passage of the anti-secession law in 2005,
Rep. Tancredo writes: "Clearly, this act represented a change in
the "status quo" - yet the strongest and most direct rebuke to
China that State Department spokesman Richard Boucher could
muster was "[W]e think it's important for both sides to focus on
dialogue." The best then-White House spokesman Scott McClellan
could do at the time was to characterize the law as "unhelpful."
</P>
<P>
The congressman concludes:  "We often hear that the State
Department is concerned about unilateral actions by either China
or Taiwan that might change the 'status quo.' In practice,
however, the department seems more than willing to criticize
Taiwan's leaders (often for quite trivial things) , yet very
reluctant to rebuke the leadership in Beijing."
</P>
<P>
Tancredo is a member of the U.S. Congressional Taiwan Caucus, a
Taiwan-friendly subgroup in the House of Representatives. He has
promoted many bills in U.S. Congress in support of Taiwan's cause
in the past few years.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, C.T. Lee, president of the Formosan Association for
Public Affairs, a Washington-based non-profit organization
dedicated to promote international support for Taiwan's  cause,
echoed Tancredo's view, saying the State Department reaction to
Taiwan's "name rectification" campaign is an irony.
</P>
<P>
Lee said in a written statement that reads: "State Department
guidelines over the past decade clearly state that U.S. officials
can and may not refer to Taiwan as the "Republic of China" - only
"Taiwan" - since the United States and Taiwan do not maintain
diplomatic relations. (E.g. Taiwan Relations Act, American
Institute in Taiwan, Taiwan desk a the State Department etc...)
Now Taiwan no longer uses "China" but starts using "Taiwan, " and
the State Department criticizes Taiwan for that! It is the
ultimate irony!"
