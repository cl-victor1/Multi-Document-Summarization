The Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) is expected to reach the
second stage of its biofuel development scheme by June 2007,
supplying B1 biodiesel to two cities, government officials said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The two cities, which are yet to be selected, will have biodiesel
supplied to all gas stations within the city limits, with the
more expensive biodiesel sold at the same price of normal diesel,
thanks to MOEA subsides.
</P>
<P>
Biodiesel is classified according to the amount of ethanol mixed
into the diesel. For example, diesel containing 1 percent ethanol
is B1 biodiesel, while B2 biodiesel has a 2 percent ethanol
content.
</P>
<P>
Biofuel development scheme aims to lead biofuels into local
people's everyday live, they said.
</P>
<P>
The first stage was implemented last January by mandating that
all 428 buses in Kaohsiung City begin using B1 biodiesel, MOEA
officials said.
</P>
<P>
The MOEA will obligate all filling stations in Taiwan to offer B1
biodiesel by 2008 in the third stage, while in the fourth stage,
the biodiesel supplies will be upgraded to B2 biodiesel by 2010.
