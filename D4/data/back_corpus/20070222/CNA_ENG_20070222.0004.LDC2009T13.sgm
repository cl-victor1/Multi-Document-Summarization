PRESIDENT REITERATES TAIWAN PEOPLE'S RIGHT TO FREE CHOICE

Taipei,   Feb.  21  (CNA) 02/22/07  13:06:02 (By Sofia Wu)

President Chen Shui-bian reiterated Wednesday that only the
people of Taiwan have the right to determine their country's
future and the form of relationship between the two sides of the
Taiwan Strait.
</P>
<P>
"In tandem with the spirit of popular sovereignty and the
principle of democracy, nobody else can arbitrarily conclude that
ultimate unification is the only available choice for the
development of cross-strait relations," Chen said.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks while receiving visiting U.S. Congressman
Steve Chabot (R-Ohio) at the Presidential Office. Also present at
the occasion was Stephen Young, director of the Taipei Office of
the American Institute in Taiwan, which represents U.S. interests
in Taiwan in the absence of formal diplomatic ties between the
two countries.
</P>
<P>
During a Lunar New Year's Day gathering in his southern hometown
in 2006, Chen unexpectedly announced his intention to cease the
functioning of the National Unification Council (NUC) and the
application of the National Unification Guidelines, both of which
were created in the early 1990s when the pro- unification
Kuomintang was in power. His announcement immediately drew strong
reaction from the United States and China as they were skeptical
whether Taiwan would move toward formal independence following
the abolishment of the two symbols of Taiwan's commitment to
eventual cross-strait unification.
</P>
<P>
To the best of his knowledge, Chen said, Young was concerned
whether he would announce sensitive policy initiatives of a
similar gravity during the current Lunar New Year festive season.
</P>
<P>
Chen said he had assured Young of "no surprise" this time around.
"I have honored my promise. I just savored sweet dumplings and
other festive snacks as well as exchanged New Year greetings
with townsfolk during my homecoming visit three days ago.  You
can now feel relieved and need not be in a stew any more," Chen
told Young.
</P>
<P>
During the NUC dispute, Chen said Chabot didn't hesitate to throw
support behind his decision. Calling Chabot "Taiwan's best friend
and my dearest brother, " Chen said he is grateful for Chabot's
resolute support for Taiwan's cause. "Your generosity has helped
us withstand hardships and challenges."
</P>
<P>
Claiming that he remains open and doesn't harbor any preset
stance on the future development of cross-strati relations, Chen
said what he insists is that only the 23 million Taiwan people
have a final say on Taiwan's future.
</P>
<P>
"And this is why the NUC should cease to function and its
guideline should cease to apply," Chen stressed, adding that his
administration managed to do away with the NUC and its guidelines
within one month following his revelation of his plan.
</P>
<P>
Touching on Taiwan-U.S. relations, Chen said he appreciates
Chabot's ardent efforts to push for the signing of a bilateral
free trade agreement between the two countries. It is hoped that
both sides can continue working together to realize this goal, he
added.
</P>
<P>
Chen further expressed his heartfelt gratitude for Chabot's call
for the U.S. government to agree to senior Taiwanese officials'
visits to major U.S. cities, including Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
"We also wholeheartedly admire and appreciate your courage to
push the U.S. government to review its so-called 'one China'
policy on the ground that the policy is outdated and unfit for
today's situation as Taiwan has fully democratized," Chen added.
