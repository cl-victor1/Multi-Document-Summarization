Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) spokesman Wang Chien-yeh
confirmed Sunday that the U.S. authorities have consented to the
appointment of Mainland Affairs Council Chairman Joseph Wu as
Taiwan's top representative in the United States, replacing David
Ta-wei Lee.
</P>
<P>
Wang said the Foreign Ministry currently plans to have Wu succeed
Lee, who has been reassigned as Taiwan's representative to
Canada, replacing Thomas Chen, who is retiring.
</P>
<P>
At the moment, Lee's assignment to Canada is on hold pending the
consent of the Canadian government, Wang added.
</P>
<P>
These arrangements are part of a regular reshuffle of the
country's diplomatic missions overseas, Wang noted.
</P>
<P>
Wang described Wu as a seasoned official who is familiar with
mainland China affairs and who maintains good contacts with U.S.
officials and members of major think-tanks in the United States.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Wang said, the fact that Wu once served as President
Chen Shui- bian's deputy chief of staff in charge of foreign
relations and is fully trusted by Chen will be a plus in terms of
ensuring "precise" bilateral communications between the two
countries.
