<P>
Premier Su Tseng-chang said Sunday that he will go all-out to
help the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) win the 2008
presidential election.
</P>
<P>
Su, one of the four DPP presidential primary contenders, made the
remarks while addressing a ceremony held in Taipei County to mark
the inauguration of a "friends of Su Tseng-chang Association" in
support of his presidency bid. Also present at the event was Lee
Hung-hsi, a mentor of President Chen Shui-bian and honorary
professor at National Taiwan University.
</P>
<P>
Voicing his gratitude to his support, Su, who once served as
Taipei County magistrate, echoed Lee in saying that the DPP
should nominate a candidate capable of winning the presidential
election and accomplishing great things for the nation.
</P>
<P>
Su said he has set the goal of "winning" the DPP's primary and
presidential race and that he will seek to achieve these goals by
improving administrative performance and boosting morale, rather
than launching verbal attacks and tarnishing the reputation of
other contenders.
</P>
<P>
Describing the other DPP presidential aspirants as "magnificent
hopefuls, " Su voiced his hope that the president's efforts to
mediate in the selection of a DPP presidential ticket will work
out well. He also called for unity and harmony among all party
members to help secure victory in the 2008 presidential election.
</P>
<P>
The premier also promised that if he wins the presidential
primary, he will invite the other three contenders to jointly
strive for the party's victory in the presidential race, and if
he loses his primary bid, he will definitely support the party's
presidential nominee.
</P>
<P>
In addition to Su, three other DPP bigwigs -- Vice President
Annette Lu, DPP Chairman Yu Shyi-kun and former Premier Frank
Hsieh -- have thrown their hats into the ring for the party's
nomination for the presidential race. Under a DPP timetable for
the presidential primary, party members will vote on presidential
and legislative hopefuls May 6, to be followed by a series of
public opinion polls to test their public support.
</P>
<P>
The votes of party members will account for 30 percent of a
would-be candidate's score, while public opinion poll results
will account for 70 percent. The presidential aspirant who
receives the highest approval rating will be named the party's
presidential candidate May 30.
