VIETNAM'S WTO ACCESSION FAVORABLE TO TAIWANESE INVESTMENT: MOEA

Taipei,  March 18 (CNA) 03/18/07  15:56:44 (By Luis Huang)

Vietnam's accession to the World Trade Organization  (WTO)  will
create  a more favorable  investment environment  in  the
Southeast  Asian  nation  for Taiwanese manufacturers, an
official with the Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) said
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
After its accession to the WTO as its 150th member in January
this year, Vietnam agreed to lower import tariffs and open its
market to foreign businessmen, thus opening the door to numerous
trade opportunities for Taiwanese manufacturers, said Chiu Po-
ching, director-general of the MOEA's Industrial Development and
Investment Center.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the Vietnamese government has brought an end to export
subsidies on farm products and the textile export quota for
Vietnam has also been eliminated since its WTO entry, Chiu
pointed out, adding that the Southeast Asian country also agreed
to open up its service industries, such as computer and
telecommunication services, as well as banking, insurance and
securities services.
</P>
<P>
Chiu also disclosed that several domestic financial institutions,
including Cathay Financial Holding Co., Hua Nan Commercial Bank
and Chinatrust Commercial Bank, are bidding to opening branches
in Vietnam, while a number of insurance companies are waiting for
the Vietnamese government's final approval to make inroads into
that country.

<P>
Touching on Taiwanese manufacturers'  future investment  in
Vietnam, Chiu said domestic entrepreneurs are well-suited to
invest in such sectors as electronics, information technology,
textile, car-making and related parts and components.
</P>
<P>
However, Chiu suggested that domestic manufacturers intending to
invest in Vietnam should conduct risk evaluations before carrying
out their investment projects, due to the lack of infrastructure,
skilled labor, and as yet incomplete industrial supply chains in
certain areas.
</P>
<P>
According to official statistics, the accumulated amount of
investment  by Taiwanese manufacturers  in Vietnam had reached
approximately US$8.26 billion as of December 2006, making Taiwan
the largest foreign investor in the Southeast Asian nation.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, investors from elsewhere are taking advantage of
opportunities in Vietnam. In 2006, new Taiwanese investment in
Vietnam amounted to US$226 million, ranking ninth among foreign
investors, far behind those from South Korea (US$2.83 billion),
Hong Kong (US$1.23 billion), Japan (US$1.04 billion) and the
United States (US$780 million).
