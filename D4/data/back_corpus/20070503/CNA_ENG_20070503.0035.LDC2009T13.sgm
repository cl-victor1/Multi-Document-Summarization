Taipei,  May 3 (CNA) 05/03/07  19:54:32 (By Lilian Wu)

<P>
Around 6,000 residents of Hualien staged protests in downtown
Taipei Thursday to demand the immediate construction of freeway
linking Suao and Hualien in eastern Taiwan, while students from
there voiced opposition to its construction.
</P>
<P>
Led by legislators Fu Kun-chi of the opposition People First
Party, Lu Po-chi of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party,
Hualien County Council Speaker Yang Wen-chi and representatives
of the tourism sector, the protesters started their journey to
Taipei at around 6 a.m. aboard more than 130 coaches.
</P>
<P>
The poor road conditions and the large number of coaches caused
serious jams, so that the vehicles were still trapped on the
Suhua Highway even after 9 a.m.
</P>
<P>
Yang said that "this is exactly why Hualien people want to fight
for a freeway that will not be so easily disrupted," referring to
the fact that the Suhua Highway is vulnerable to disruptions
whenever there are typhoons or landslides.
</P>
<P>
The fleet of coaches was scheduled to arrive at the Presidential
Office at 11:30 a.m. but did not arrive until 1:30 p.m.
</P>
<P>
The Hualien residents unfurled protest banners and shouted
slogans on Ketagalan Boulevard in front of the Presidential
Office.
</P>
<P>
The Presidential  Office  had prepared  to meet with  the
representatives of the protestors, but they didn't send
representatives and later went to the Executive Yuan and the
Environmental Protection Administration to highlight their cause.
</P>
<P>
Both Lu and Fu urged the government to start construction
immediately and blasted the administration for going to eastern
Taiwan only when it wants cement, gravel or military bases.
</P>
<P>
"The only humble wish of the Hualien residents is a freeway that
can allow uninterrupted traffic flow around the clock," they
said.
</P>
<P>
They also said that the only highway -- the Suhua Highway -- has
been rated by the Ministry of Transportation and Communications
as an F-level perilous road. Hualien's misery index and divorce
rate topped the 25 cities and counties around the country and the
high jobless rate and the slumping economy have been ignored by
the government, they added.
</P>
<P>
Tien Chi-shuen, chief of Chian village in Hualien, said there are
freeways, expressways and a high-speed train in western Taiwan,
but not even one in eastern Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Hualien students called a news conference in
Taipei to convey their opposition to the building of the freeway.
</P>
<P>
Yang Chi-huan, a member of the Youth Action Alliance, said that
to protect their homeland from being polluted by the proposed
freeway, they launched an online petition in early March, which
has been signed by nearly 25,000 people in less than two months.
</P>
<P>
Yang said the alliance has solicited the support of more than 300
private groups,  adding that they will mobilize  more Hualien
youngsters and private groups to join their cause.
</P>
<P>
Another  member,  Tsai Chung-yueh,  said they support  the
development of Hualien, but not through a freeway, claiming that
no-one can predict its impact on the ecology.
</P>
<P>
The Suhua Freeway was one of the platforms of President Chen
Shui-bian when he first campaigned for the presidency in 2000 and
again in 2004, but the project has never gotten off the ground,
as several government environmental impact assessment reports
have not deemed it as feasible.
</P>
<P>
The 89-km freeway would pass through 11 tunnels that could
undermine underground water resources.
</P>
<P>
The controversy over the freeway has centered on economic
development and environmental protection, and it has become a hot
topic of debate recently among the four DPP presidential hopefuls
-- Vice President Annette Lu, Premier Su Tseng-chang, former
Premier Frank Hsieh and DPP Chairman Yu Shyi-kun.
