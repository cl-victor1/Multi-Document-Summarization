ATJ LAUNCHES PETITION TO BID FOR WHA COVERAGE RIGHT
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taipei,  May 3 (CNA) 05/03/07  17:58:01 (By Luis Huang)
</P>
<P>
The Association of Taiwan Journalists (ATJ) kicked off a petition
Thursday aimed at protecting  Taiwanese reporters' right to cover
the annual meeting of the World Health Assembly (WHA) ,  the
decision-making arm of the World Health Organization.
</P>
<P>
ATJ President Chen Hsiao-yi said the United Nations General
Assembly designated May 3 as World Press Freedom Day in 1993.
However, the U.N. has banned Taiwan's reporters from covering the
annual WHA meeting held in May in Geneva by refusing to issue
press cards to Taiwanese reporters since 2004.
</P>
<P>
A resolution on world press freedom promotion introduced by the
U.N. Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization in 1991
states that a free, pluralistic and independent press is
essential to any democratic society, Chen noted, adding that as
an organization advocating democracy and press freedom, the U.N.
has deprived Taiwanese reporters of their news coverage rights
out of fear of China.
</P>
<P>
Ironically, Chen pointed out, a total of 125 reporters have been
arrested by Chinese authorities, 31 of whom are still in prison,
according to a report released by the Paris-based Reporters sans
Frontieres.
</P>
<P>
She continued that Taiwan's reporters have been denied press
cards by the U.N. for three years in a row because of the
international organization's desire to kowtow to China.
</P>
<P>
"To show our determination to pursue press freedom and make the
international community aware of our situation, the ATJ has
decided to stage the petition, " Chen explained, adding that her
association has collected signatures from 30 media organizations,
including 11 newspapers, 10 TV companies, four journals and four
radio stations.
</P>
<P>
According to Chen, the ATJ has also asked several international
journalist organizations, such as Reporters sans Frontieres and
the International Federation of Journalists, to push the United
Nations to allow Taiwanese reporters to cover the WHA meeting.
