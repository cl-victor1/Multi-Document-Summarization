housing, ITRI officials said.

The NTUST has also charted a Taiwan architecture technology

technologies and applications, according to university officials.

NTUST Associate Professor Wei Hao-yang also noted that the
center, as a showcase of eco- and smart-housing,  will focus
especially  on features  like moisture proofing  or heat and
ventilation. "Meanwhile, we can screen out possible faults in the
processes and refine them," he added.
