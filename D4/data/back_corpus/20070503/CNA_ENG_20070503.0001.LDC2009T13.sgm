PRESIDENT WRITES WHO HEAD AGAIN ON TAIWAN'S MEMBERSHIP BID
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Geneva,  May 2 (CNA) 05/03/07  00:00:06 (By Sofia Wu)
</P>
<P>
President Chen Shui-bian has once again sent a letter to World
Health Organization (WHO) Director-General Margaret Chan
conveying Taiwan's desire to join the organization under the name
"Taiwan," sources at WHO headquarters said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Chen filed Taiwan's WHO membership application for the first time
in a April 11 letter to Chan. WHO legal advisers said shortly
afterwards that as Taiwan is not a sovereign state, it is not
eligible to apply for the U.N.-affiliated WHO whose membership
requires statehood. Therefore, the legal advisers claimed that
the WHO need not take any further step to address Taiwan's
application.
</P>
<P>
The WHO Secretariat's legalistic handling of this politically
sensitive issue enraged Taiwan, which insists that the
determination should be made by the collective body of all WHO
members, for only they  are entitled  to determine the fate of
its membership application.
</P>
<P>
Stressing that the WHO Secretariat  is not authorized  to
unilaterally reject Taiwan's membership bid, President Chen
stated his determination to file an application again on behalf
of Taiwan's government and people.
</P>
<P>
Chen provided  an even more comprehensive  and unequivocal
explanation of Taiwan's stance and attitude toward its WHO
membership bid in his second letter to Chan.
</P>
<P>
Chen also demanded in his second letter that Taiwan's membership
application be put on the agenda of the upcoming annual
conference of the World Health Assembly (WHA) -- the WHO's
decision-making arm -- for all WHO members to decide.
</P>
<P>
As the WHO's stance on the issue is not expected to change
overnight, the sources said, the fate of Taiwan's membership bid
will hinge on the attitude of Taiwan's 25 diplomatic allies.
</P>
<P>
According to WHO sources, more than 10 of Taiwan's diplomatic
allies have written to the WHO Secretariat demanding that it deal
with Taiwan's membership application in a fair, impartial and
unbiased manner. Taiwan's allies also demanded that the issue be
included into the agenda of the WHA for all WHO members to
resolve. The WHA is set to open its annual session in Geneva May
14.
</P>
<P>
It remains unclear how much impact Taiwan allies' request would
have on the development of the case. The most likely scenario is
that the two sides of the Taiwan Strait will have a showdown on
the WHA's opening day, WHO sources said.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan's allies are expected to file a proposal on the WHA's
opening day asking that the WHA steering committee put the issue
on the agenda for the WHA's plenary session. As in the past with
Taiwan's WHA applications for observer status, China would
mobilize its allies at the WHA steering committee to block
Taiwan's new bid from being place on the plenary session agenda,
the sources predicted.
