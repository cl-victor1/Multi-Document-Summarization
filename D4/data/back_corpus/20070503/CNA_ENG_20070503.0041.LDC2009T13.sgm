<P>
Veteran Taiwanese swimmer Wang Han, who became the first ethnic
Chinese to swim across the Straits of Gibraltar in 1986, plans to
challenge the Taiwan Strait later this year.
</P>
<P>
The Taiwan Strait swim will be Wang's first attempt in nine years
since he and his team swam across the Messina Strait in June
1998.
</P>
<P>
Between 1986 and 1998, Wang and his team have swum across 12
channels or straits around the world, making him a major "strait
challenger" in the world's Chinese communities.
</P>
<P>
Wang, 55, said at a news conference that the cross-strait swim is
scheduled to be accomplished by swimmers from both sides of the
strait in three stages between August 2007 and August 2009.
</P>
<P>
He lamented that despite economic prosperity, the Taiwan people
are not familiar with the oceans surrounding their island and
that maritime leisure activities have never been popular.
</P>
<P>
He said he was once asked which channel or strait in the world he
considers the most difficult to challenge. He answered after a
long thought that the Taiwan Strait provides the biggest
challenge.
</P>
<P>
He added that he began to plan the cross-strait swim in September
2005, although concrete action did not start until last month
after the cooperating party on the other side of the strait was
finally determined -- the Exchanges Department of the Taiwan
Affairs Office under China's State Council.
</P>
<P>
According to Wang, 25 swimmers led by himself will launch the
first round of the swim between August and October this year,
depending on weather and current conditions.
</P>
<P>
The swimmers plan to swim from Tamshui, Taipei County or Nanliao,
Hsinchu County to Pingtan in China's Fujian Province in a relay
fashion, with each swimmer in the water for one hour.
</P>
<P>
Wang said that although the shortest distance between Taiwan
proper and Fujian is 170 km, it is more like 250 km in terms of
swimming.
</P>
<P>
The second round of the swim is scheduled to be launched between
April and May 2008, also departing from Taiwan's Tamshui or
Nanliao for Fujian's Pingtan, Wang said.
</P>
<P>
He added that for the third round, the 25 swimmers will depart
from Pingtan for Tamshui or Nanliao, to be held between July and
August of 2009.
