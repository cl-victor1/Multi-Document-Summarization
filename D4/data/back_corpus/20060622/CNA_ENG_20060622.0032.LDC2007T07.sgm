OPPOSITION URGES GOVERNMENT TO SECURE CONTROL OVER MEGA HOLDINGS
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  June 22 (CNA) (By Han Nai-kuo)
</P>
<P>
Premier Su Tseng-chang and Minister of Finance Joseph Lyu should
resign if the government loses its majority to private shareholders in
the board election of Mega Financial Holding Co., legislators of the
main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Mega Financial will hold its next board election Friday and there is
concern that the government, as the single largest shareholder with 22
percent of the shares in the company, might no longer have a majority
eight seats representing government shares on the 15-member board.
</P>
<P>
Legislator Pan Wei-kang, a whip of the KMT legislative caucus, said at
a news conference that if the government fails to secure its board
majority, thus losing operational control over Mega Financial's
NT$2.13 trillion (US$65.23 billion) in capital, the premier and the
finance minister should step down to take responsibility.
</P>
<P>
Echoing Pan's call, KMT Legislator Alex Fai claimed that if the number
of board members representing government shares should fall from eight
seats to seven in Friday's election, it would mean that the premier
and the finance minister are no longer qualified to remain in their
posts.
</P>
<P>
KMT Legislator Lai Shyh-bao claimed that the election is of great
concern to all the people in Taiwan because if the government loses
its control over Mega Financial, it would represent an average loss of
NT$100,000 to each person.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, James Soong, chairman of the opposition People First Party
(PFP), said if the premier and the finance minister "give up the
government's control" over Mega Financial, it will be tantamount to
their support for what he described as the "corrupt leadership" of
President Chen Shui-bian, who has been accused by the opposition
parties for "fleecing the national treasury" under the guise of
privatizing state-owned banks.
</P>
<P>
Soong vowed that the PFP will do everything possible to topple the
Cabinet if the government suffers a defeat in Mega Financial's board
election.
</P>
<P>
Mega Financial, Taiwan's second-largest financial service company, was
formed by state-owned Chiao Tung Bank and International Securities Co.
through exchange of shares in 2002 under the government's financial
reform program.
</P>
<P>
Chiao Tung Bank Chairman Cheng Shen-chih became chairman of Mega
Financial, supposedly because of his good relationship with Chen,
although he owned fewer than 2 million shares at the time. The
privatization process triggered opposition suspicion that it was a
scheme by the president and the DPP to "fleece the national treasury."
</P>
<P>
According to news reports, Cheng has obtained the support of
Chinatrust Financial Holding Co., which owns 12 percent of the shares
in Mega Financial, and that he appears certain to continue serving as
chairman, even if control of the board falls into the hands of private
shareholders.
