</HEADLINE>

<P>
Washington,  June 6 (CNA) 06/07/07  18:57:18 (By Michelle Tsai
and T.C. Jiang)
</P>
<P>
The United States will send two senior officials to Taiwan later
this month to hold preparatory talks with their local
counterparts for a sixth round of Trade and Investment Framework
Agreement (TIFA) negotiations scheduled for the second half of
the year, a Taiwanese official said in Washington, D.C.
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Huang Chih-peng, director-general of the Bureau of Foreign Trade,
made the remarks at a press conference before leading a
delegation to visit the Office of the United States Trade
Representative (USTR) and U.S. lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. and Taiwan plan to convene the TIFA meeting in
Washington later this year, Huang said, adding that John C.C.
Teng, the chief negotiator of Taiwan's Office of Trade
Negotiations, will lead adelegation to the U.S. for the event.
</P>
<P>
It is not clear that whether the U.S. Congress will extend the
Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) , which will expire June 30,
Huang pointed out.
</P>
<P>
The TPA gives President George W. Bush the authority to negotiate
trade agreements with other nations.
</P>
<P>
In this situation, Taiwan will continue to express willingness to
sign a free trade agreement (FTA) with the U.S., Huang noted,
adding that the sixth round of TIFA talks is critical because its
success can further U.S.-Taiwan substantive relations.
</P>
<P>
Both sides have fully discussed the agenda for the TIFA talks,
while the specific date for the negotiations will be announced
following confirmation with the U.S., according to Huang.
</P>
<P>
Despite no progress having been made in the bid for an FTA, Huang
said both sides are satisfied with the results of last year's
TIFA meeting.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan has assured the U.S. that it takes the interests of U.S.
companies seriously with regard to intellectual property rights
and drug reimbursement costs of Taiwan's National Health
Insurance (NHI) program, Huang said.
</P>
<P>
The TIFA negotiations will focus on the signing of a bilateral
investment agreement, an avoidance of double taxation agreement
and a government procurement agreement, Huang continued.
</P>
<P>
Aside from face-to-face meetings, both sides have also held three
videoconferences on the bilateral investment agreement, and will
also hold videoconferences on the two other agreements, Huang
said.
</P>
<P>
There is no timetable for the signing of the three agreements,
according to Huang, although he added that the two sides are
willing to carry on the talks.
