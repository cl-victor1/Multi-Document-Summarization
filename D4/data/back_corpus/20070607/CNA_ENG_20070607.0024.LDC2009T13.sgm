The Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) initiated Thursday an
"LED lighting standards and quality R&amp;D alliance" both to
boost the market share of locally made LED lighting equipment and
to integrate the upstream and downstream manufacturers in the
industry, Economics Minister Steve R.L. Chen announced at a press
conference that day.
</P>
<P>
Chen also announced that the ministry has appropriated NT$170
million (approximately US$5 million) to establish Taiwan's first
comprehensive LED lighting measuring system that will facilitate
technological improvements in LED packaging and lighting.
</P>
<P>
LEDs, or light emitting diodes, are described as an eco-friendly
and energy- saving method of lighting. As the global demand for
LED lighting equipment has surged in recent years, Taiwan's total
production value for LED lighting topped NT$21 billion last year,
representing 10 percent of the global market value.
</P>
<P>
Chen also noted that LED lighting equipment can be a niche for
Taiwan-based manufacturers, as well as a superb instrument for
better energy efficiency around the nation.
</P>
<P>
"If all traffic lights were replaced with LEDs, it would mean
power savings of 85 percent, " Chen continued. "If all
streetlamps were replaced with LEDs, it would lead to power
savings of 41 percent," he added.
</P>
<P>
"The energy saved in both areas could equal 10.7 billion
kilowatt-hours, or the annual output volume of an entire nuclear
power generating unit," Chen said.
