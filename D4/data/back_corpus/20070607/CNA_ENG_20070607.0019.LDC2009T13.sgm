TAIWAN WORKS WITH U.S. TO BUST CROSS-BORDER HUMAN TRAFFICKERS

Taipei, June 7 (CNA) 06/07/07  17:27:25 (By Lilian Wu)

<P>
Taiwan has cooperated with the United States to break up a cross-
border human trafficking ring and arrest 12 suspects, the
Criminal Investigation Bureau (CIB) reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
CIB agents said the ring is suspected of smuggling Taiwan women
to the United States and other countries for prostitution and
other forms of sexual exploitation.
</P>
<P>
The agents said the ring's mastermind, Lin Ming-tang, his
accomplice Chen Jung- kee and 10 others were arrested in raids in
Taoyuan, Taipei and Keelung a day earlier.
</P>
<P>
The suspects included those who are from Tu's group, a major
pornography ring associated with Lin's ring.
</P>
<P>
They noted that U.S. customs and immigration authorities in San
Francisco have since February 2006 caught 12 Taiwanese women
engaging in prostitution, leading them to suspect that these
women might have been "exported" by human traffickers.
</P>
<P>
The United States, which has stepped up screening measures on
foreign visitors in the wake of the 911 terrorist attacks, sent
officials to call on CIB Commissioner Huang Mao-sui to seek his
assistance in helping to track down the human traffickers.
</P>
<P>
The American Institute in Taiwan (AIT), which represents U.S.
interests in Taiwan in the absence of diplomatic relations, also
looked into the visa application and auditing procedures of the
women.
</P>
<P>
The CIB set up a task force which confirmed that the women were
cheated and threatened by the ring and that they used forged
papers to get visas under the name of tourists or students,
allowing them to travel to major U.S. cities.
</P>
<P>
The task force also found that women repatriated by the United
States and Japan numbers more than 100, although the actual
number could be higher.
</P>
<P>
Agents found that Lin's ring set up "phantom" companies between
2005 and 2006 that helped the women use forged work papers to
apply for visas from AIT. The task force found that the ring had
used the method to obtain more than 100 U.S. visas.
</P>
<P>
Lin also extended his operations to Britain, Canada, Japan,
Australia and Guam, and collaborated with Tu's group, the
country's largest pornography supplier.
