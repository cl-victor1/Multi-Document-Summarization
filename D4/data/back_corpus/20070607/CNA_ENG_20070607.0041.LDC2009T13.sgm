Two of Taiwan's diplomatic allies in Central America, Guatemala
and El Salvadore, have each announced that they will maintain
diplomatic relations with Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
The two countries made their announcements after Costa Rica,
formerly another ally of Taiwan in Central America, switched its
diplomatic allegiance from Taipei to Beijing Wednesday.

<P>
According to Spanish news reports by the Associated Press,
Salvadoran President Antonio Saca said at a news conference
Wednesday that his nation would like to develop relations with
China, but only on the condition that China not ask his country
to cut its ties with Taiwan.

<P>
Guatemalan Presidential Office Spokeswoman Crista Kepfer told the
EFE--the leading Spanish news agency-- that Guatemala's
government has no comments on Costa Rica's diplomatic decision,
but added that Guatemala will maintain diplomatic relations with
Taiwan. She also said that Guatemalan President Oscar Berger will
visit Taiwan June 17 at the invitation of the Taiwanese
government.
</P>
<P>
Berger's visit to Taiwan later this month aims to strengthen
relations with Taiwan and to enhance bilateral cooperation on
infrastructure construction and free trade, Kedpfer said, adding
that the two countries signed a free trade agreement last year.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Kepfer said Berger has indicated repeatedly that
Guatemala will not sacrifice its ties with Taiwan to seek better
trade relations with China.
