Videoland Movie Channel, Taiwan's first cable television channel
dedicated to showing Chinese-language films, announced Thursday
that it will set aside NT$1 billion (US$30.18 million) to produce
100 digital films over the next five years.

Hu Kuan-chen,  president of Videoland Movie Channel,  told
reporters that her company will also spend millions to recruit
writing talent.

Hu, 38, is a former actress who has starred in 18 films. She made
the announcement two days after the channel celebrated its 15th
anniversary.

Her deputy, Yao Ching-kang -- a playwright who has written 36
plays -- said Videoland will begin to shoot films in different
genres in Hong Kong, Taiwan and China this year, and that the
company will place more emphasis on good plays than on the latest
stars.

Videoland has a library of more than 1,200 Chinese-language films
and shows an average of about 120 titles each month. In 2004, the
channel ventured into the production of digital films and scored
success with two titles -- "Bodyguard for a Corpse" and "Dear
Corpse" -- followed by two more hits in 2005 -- "Playful Ghost"
and "Ghost Mama." In 2006, Videoland Movie Channel produced
"Puppy Love" and "My Schoolboy's Day."

The company plans to produce about 20 titles a year in various
categories including comedy, kung-fu, puppet theater and
children's movies.
