BEIJING, DPP BLAMED FOR COSTA RICA FIASCO

Taipei,  June  7 (CNA) 06/07/07  20:47:30 (By Flor Wang)

<P>
The main opposition Kuomintang's (KMT) presidential candidate
Thursday expressed his deep regret over the termination of
Taiwan-Costa Rica diplomatic ties, blaming both Beijing and
Taiwan's ruling party for the development.
</P>
<P>
Ma Ying-jeou, a former KMT chairman who stepped down from the
post in February and was nominated in early May to run as the
party's candidate in the 2008 presidential election, made the
comments in a press release issued by his campaign office.
</P>
<P>
Calling it a major setback for Taiwan to sever its 63-year-long
diplomatic partnership with the Central American state known
worldwide for its democracy and openness, Ma ascribed the event
to China's ubiquitous suppression of Taiwan and to the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party's (DPP) populist brand of diplomacy.
</P>
<P>
Ma blamed China for hurting the feelings of the Taiwanese people
by using its growing economic  clout to block Taiwan in the
international arena, and also criticized the DPP for practicing
so-called "hit-and-run" diplomacy since it came to power in 2000.
</P>
<P>
China's relentless efforts to muscle Taiwan off of the world
stage have seriously shaken the foundation of mutual trust, while
the populist diplomatic strategy adopted by the DPP has caused
many of the country's diplomatic allies to lose faith in Taiwan,
Ma claimed.
</P>
<P>
While urging Beijing to stop bullying Taiwan and try to build
better two-way relations, Ma also urged the DPP to take the
initiative and contact China in a pragmatic and professional
style so as to best serve the Taiwan people's interests.
</P>
<P>
Speaking earlier the same day at a Legislative Yuan news
conference, KMT lawmaker John Chiang, a former minister of
foreign affairs, voiced grave concern that Panama and Nicaragua
might follow in Costa Rica's footsteps by breaking off diplomatic
ties with Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Following the loss of Costa Rica, Taiwan maintains diplomatic
links with 24 countries, most of whom are in Latin America, the
South Pacific and Africa.
