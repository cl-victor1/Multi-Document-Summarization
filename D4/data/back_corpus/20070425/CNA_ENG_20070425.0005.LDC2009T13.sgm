More than 70 students from a middle school in Hualien County will
be tested for tuberculosis Wednesday after a teacher who had
frequent contact with them was found last week to have contracted
the disease.
</P>
<P>
Health officials with the Hualien County government confirmed
Tuesday that the female teacher developed a cough in early April
but thought it was merely a cold symptom at the time.
</P>
<P>
The officials, who declined to name the teacher, said that on
April 18, the teacher's cough became so bad she had to go to the
Tzu Chi General Hospital  in Hualien for treatment, where doctors
diagnosed her with opening pulmonary tuberculosis.
</P>
<P>
Tuberculosis bacteria can spread through the air. The phlegm of
patients with opening pulmonary tuberculosis carries the highly
contagious bacteria.
</P>
<P>
The teacher has been isolated at the hospital for further
treatment, the officials said, adding that the more than 70
students who were in close contact with her will be given chest
X-rays and will have their phlegm tested.
