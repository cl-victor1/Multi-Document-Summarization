CABINET TO DISCUSS DRAFT AMNESTY BILL NEXT WEDNESDAY: PREMIER
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taipei, April 25 (CNA) 04/25/07  18:39:48 (By Lilian Wu)
</P>
<P>
The Executive Yuan will discuss a draft amnesty bill for prison
inmates in its next Cabinet meeting, Premier Su Tseng-chang said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The premier made the remarks one day after President Chen Shui-
bian announced that he had instructed the Executive Yuan to study
commuting some sentences to coincide with the 20th anniversary of
the lifting of martial law and the 60th anniversary of the 228
Incident, which refers to a civil revolt against the then-ruling
Kuomintang in 1947 that led to a bloody crackdown.
</P>
<P>
Su noted that the Ministry of Justice worked out a draft bill on
the commutations a day earlier that will be sent to the Executive
Yuan after more discussion with the Judicial Yuan and other
related government agencies.
</P>
<P>
The premier  noted  that Chen instructed  last week  that
commutations should be studied for inmates serving time for minor
transgressions so as to relieve the overcrowded prisons.
</P>
<P>
He said such commutations are carried out both here and abroad,
but added that those who have committed major or financial
crimes, or who have been convicted of corruption, should be
excluded.
</P>
<P>
Asked if the proposed amnesty is part of the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party's strategy to win the year-end legislative
elections and the 2008 presidential election, Su said the public
should only make a judgment after seeing the draft bill.
</P>
<P>
He said that not every inmate is "unforgivable" and that some
should be given the opportunity of a fresh start.
