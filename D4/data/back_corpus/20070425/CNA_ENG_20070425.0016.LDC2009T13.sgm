Taipei, April 25 (CNA) 04/25/07  15:04:03 (By Elizabeth Hsu)

A senior researcher at the Academia Sinica urged the government
Wednesday to be more active in working to reduce the amount of
greenhouse gas emissions in Taiwan, as the country's image has
been deteriorating in the international community due to what he
called the record-high rate of increase of such emissions in the
country in recent years.
</P>
<P>
Liu Shaw-chen, chief of the Academia Sinica's Research Center for
Environmental Change, made the call while delivering a report on
Taiwan's preparations against climate change and global warming
at the Legislative Yuan.
</P>
<P>
Liu indicated that Taiwan's per capita greenhouse gas emissions
is now double the level in 1990.
</P>
<P>
Citing the results of a survey on the amount of greenhouse gas
emissions produced in countries with over 10 million people, Liu
said Taiwan's per capita carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions was half
those of France and Britain in 1990.
</P>
<P>
However, Taiwan surpassed the industrialized European nations in
2003 in terms of per capita CO2 emissions, Liu said. He added
that although Taiwan's per capita CO2 emissions is lower than
those of the United States, Canada and Australia, Taiwan tops the
global list in terms of the rate of increase in greenhouse gas
emissions.
</P>
<P>
"Because  of this,  Taiwan's international  image is being
tarnished, " Liu claimed.
</P>
<P>
The scientist stressed that Taiwan possesses the technological
know-how to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, adding that he
believes it is the government's duty to strive to do so.
