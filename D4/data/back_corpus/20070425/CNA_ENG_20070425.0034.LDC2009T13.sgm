PRESIDENT URGES GERMANY TO SUPPORT TAIWAN'S WHO BID
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  April 25 (CNA) 04/25/07  20:17:40 (By Y.F. Low)
</P>
<P>
President Chen Shui-bian called on the German government
Wednesday to speak up on behalf of Taiwan's bid to join the World
Health Organization (WHO) , a goal which has remained unfulfilled
over the past 10 years owing to China's obstruction.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the issue during video conference with a group of
German politicians, academics and media representatives, Chen
suggested that Germany make a case for Taiwan during the upcoming
annual World Health Assembly (WHA) -- the highest decision-making
body of the WHO -- based on the precedent of the former East
Germany.
</P>
<P>
Chen pointed out that the status of East Germany as a "country"
was challenged when it applied to become a member of the WHO in
1968, but the request was nonetheless included on the WHA's
agenda for consideration by the organization's member nations.
</P>
<P>
The WHO invited East Germany to participate in the 1972 WHA as an
observer, and during the 1973 WHA, East Germany's application for
WHO membership was approved, Chen noted.
</P>
<P>
Chen said he requested that Taiwan be allowed to become a member
of the WHO in a letter addressed to WHO Director-General Margaret
Chan April 11, and hopes that Germany will offer Taiwan its
support so that the country's application could be put on the
WHA's agenda and be discussed by WHO member nations.
</P>
<P>
Also, Taiwan hopes that Germany will help Taiwan take part in the
WHA as an observer before it gains membership in the WHO, Chen
said.
</P>
<P>
"I hereby sincerely urge the international community, especially
European Union countries, to pay attention to China's diplomatic
suppression and military intimidation of Taiwan, and speak up for
Taiwan so as to promote the values of freedom, democracy, peace
and human rights that we share," Chen said.
</P>
<P>
The president said China's obstruction of Taiwan's bid to take
part in the WHO has deprived the island's 23 million people of
their rights to life and health.
</P>
<P>
While China has never renounced the use of force against Taiwan
and has been increasing its military budget over last 20 years,
there is no collective security mechanism or platform for
dialogue that would allow for international mediation of cross-
Taiwan Strait disputes, Chen pointed out.
</P>
<P>
"It is extremely unfair to the 23 million Taiwanese people that
Taiwan must face the increasingly strong military threat by
China. This also poses a latent hazard to the security and
stability of the Asia-Pacific region," he said.
</P>
<P>
Calling the international  community's attention to China's
military threat a result of the emergence of China as a super-
power, Chen said the number of missiles China has deployed to
target Taiwan has increased from 200 in 2000 to nearly 1,000 in
2007.
</P>
<P>
Also, Beijing enacted the so-called Anti-Secession Law targeting
Taiwan in March 2005, despite opposition from the international
community, Chen noted.
</P>
<P>
He urged the German government to exert its influence and lobby
the European Union to maintain its arms embargo against China
until China democratizes its political system and improves its
human rights record.
