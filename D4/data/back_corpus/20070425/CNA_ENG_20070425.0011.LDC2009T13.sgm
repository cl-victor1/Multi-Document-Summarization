Taipei,  April 25 (CNA) 04/25/07  12:27:01 (By Elizabeth Hsu)

<P>
Former South African Anglican Archbishop Desmond Tutu, who won
the 1984 Nobel Peace Prize, departed Taiwan Wednesday after an
eight-day visit to the island.
</P>
<P>
At the Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport, Tutu expressed his
thanks for the Taiwan people's hospitality and gave them his
blessing.
</P>
<P>
Tutu, in the company of his wife, Leah Nomalizo Tutu, arrived in
Taiwan April 18 for a visit at the invitation of the Taiwan
Foundation for Democracy. During his stay, he met with President
Chen Shui-bian, Vice President Annette Lu, former ruling
Democratic Progressive Party Chairman Lin Yi-hsiung, and family
members of the victims of the 228 Incident of 1947, one of the
most tragic chapters in Taiwan's history.
</P>
<P>
Tutu also attended a forum held by the foundation Tuesday on the
subject of transitional justice and national reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
Tutu said that Taiwan is in a situation similar to that of South
Africa during apartheid. In those days, he recalled, it was
difficult for him to obtain a visa with a South African passport.
</P>
<P>
Nowadays, the Taiwan people's rights and interests are still
ignored by the international community, Tutu said, adding that he
will speak up for Taiwan at gatherings  of any international
organizations when the opportunity presents itself.
</P>
<P>
Tutu, rising to worldwide fame during the 1980s as an opponent of
apartheid, is recognized for his contribution to ending the
inhumane system and facilitating reconciliation in his country.
</P>
<P>
As head of South Africa's Truth and Reconciliation Commission,
Tutu has played a leading role in his country's post-apartheid
campaign to heal its historical wounds and boost ethnic harmony.
