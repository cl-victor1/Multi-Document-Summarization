Premier Su Tseng-chang  expressed opposition Wednesday to "pork
barrel" draft bills that have been put forth by individual
legislators or legislative caucuses of political parties.
</P>
<P>
At a regular Executive Yuan meeting, Su instructed Cabinet
agencies to stay firm on carrying out government policies but to
do their utmost to consult and communicate  with members of the
legislature in the face of "pork barrel" draft bills.
</P>
<P>
Su said these draft bills -- projects that are given a lot of
government money in order to win votes -- should be avoided, as
they will have a profound and longstanding impact on the nation's
finances.
</P>
<P>
Su issued  the instruction  after  the opposition-dominated
Legislative Health and Environment Committee passed 23 amendments
to a law governing higher annuity payments for the elderly. The
committee meeting decided later that the ruling and opposition
parties should consult with each other and negotiate before
referring final amendment proposals to the legislative floor for
debate.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Su lamented that the legislature has passed only 30
bills so far this legislative session, with 90 other "priority"
draft bills submitted by the Executive Yuan remaining up in the
air. The session is scheduled to wrap up May 1.
