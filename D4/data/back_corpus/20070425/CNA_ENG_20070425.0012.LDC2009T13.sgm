U.S. REAFFIRMS COMMITMENT TO TAIWAN
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Washington,  April 24 (CNA) 04/25/07  12:48:26 (By Chiehyu Lin
and Y.F. Low)
</P>
<P>
A high-ranking U.S. military official reaffirmed Tuesday the
United States' commitment to provide Taiwan with the necessary
assistance to defend itself against possible Chinese invasion.
</P>
<P>
The United States is examining Taiwan's defense needs by sending
observers  to survey the island's annual "Han Kuang" military
exercise, according to Timothy Keating, commander of the U.S.
Pacific Command (USPACOM).
</P>
<P>
"USPACOM will continue to make available to Taiwan advice,
training and support for congressionally-approved equipment to
defend against the potential military aggression by the PRC, "
Keating said during a Senate Committee on Armed Services hearing.
</P>
<P>
He said the United States is monitoring cross-Taiwan Strait
relations closely and that the country's military interactions
with Taiwan and China focus on efforts to preserve cross-strait
stability.
</P>
<P>
"We continue to encourage Taiwan to improve its own defenses and
create a credible deterrent to any attack. We have advocated
inexpensive hardening practices as well as the acquisition of a
combination of defensive weapons and systems," he said.
</P>
<P>
However, Keating emphasized the United States' position remains
that Taiwan's actions should be defensive, rather than offensive,
in nature, and he expressed confidence that Taiwan understands
this point clearly.
</P>
<P>
"But it is very much in their interest not to conduct themselves,
either by speech or by action, in a way that could be
misconstrued by China in unfortunate ways," he said.
</P>
<P>
Keating said that while China's military modernization efforts do
not yet challenge U.S. military capabilities in the Asia-Pacific
region, the opaqueness of Chinese defense budgets and intentions,
as well as the introduction of new capabilities, are causes for
concern.
</P>
<P>
The military-to-military interaction between the United States
and China is aimed at increasing  transparency  between their
respective militaries, breaking down barriers to understanding
and reducing the potential for miscalculation, he said.
