MAC WARNS AGAINST RISKS OF FOCUSING INVESTMENT ON CHINA
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  April 25 (CNA) 04/25/07  19:27:46 (By Lilian Wu)

The Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) warned Wednesday that Taiwan
businessmen should think about the risks of focusing too much on
the China market.
</P>
<P>
Liu Te-hsun, vice chairman of the body in charge of Taiwan's
China policy planning, made the remarks during a meeting in the
central city of Taichung with 300 Taiwanese businessmen wanting
to invest or having invested in China.
</P>
<P>
Liu noted that in recent years, Taiwan businessmen have listed
China as their main investment destination or the major market
for their products instead of diverting their investments and
exports to other countries.
</P>
<P>
"Focusing on a single market has potential risks, " Liu said,
adding that Taiwan businessmen should seriously consider the
negative impact of such a move.
</P>
<P>
Businessman Lee Jung-fu, speaking on the same occasion, said
China no longer welcomes all enterprises. Those enterprises that
are highly polluting and high- energy consuming might be told to
move to China's hinterland instead of staying in the more
prosperous coastal provinces, he said.
</P>
<P>
Labor-intensive enterprises are no longer suitable for investing
in China and Taiwan businessmen should take heed of this trend,
Lee added.
</P>
<P>
He said that the digital  and service sectors still have
development opportunities in China, although they will be hard to
develop if they are small- scale.
