'CHINESE SPIES' ARE ACTUALLY ESCAPED ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS: NSB
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  April 25 (CNA) 04/25/07  14:44:14 (By Deborah Kuo)

The "5,000 Chinese spies" alleged to be operating in Taiwan are
actually "escaped illegal immigrants," rather than "genuine"
spies, a National Security Bureau (NSB) official said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Wang Hsi-tien, a deputy secretary-general of the NSB, said during
an interpellation session at the Legislative Yuan that there are
roughly 5,000 Chinese citizens who have been living a clandestine
existence in Taiwan since entering the country illegally.
</P>
<P>
Wang said the figure of "5,000" was arrived at based on
cumulative calculations over the past several years, stressing
that these illegal immigrants are not spies.
</P>
<P>
The NSB official made the remarks in response to a question
raised by opposition Kuomintang Legislator Lin Yu-fang about
whether former Deputy Defense Minister Lin Chong-pin's recent
claim that there are more than 5,000 Chinese spies operating in
Taiwan is true.
</P>
<P>
Lin Chong-pin was quoted in the latest edition of the U.S. weekly
"Defense News" as saying that he believes more than 5,000
mainland Chinese spies are operating in Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Lin Chong-pin was also quoted as saying in the weekly report that
he himself had stumbled upon one "Chinese spy" who was working as
a cab driver in Taiwan in 1995. He said the driver spoke in
perfect Pekingese and admitted that he was from Beijing, that he
had been briefed by the Taiwan Research Institute (affiliated
with the People's Republic of China's National Security
Ministry), that he had a master's degree in hydraulic dynamics
from Tsinghua University, and that he was in Taiwan to 'serve the
broad masses by comparing the strengths and weaknesses  between
the capitalist and socialist systems."
</P>
<P>
When asked by Legislator Lin Yu-fang whether it was possible that
Chinese authorities, unable to send spies to Taiwan from Xiamen,
Fujian Province -- which lies across the Taiwan Strait from
Taiwan, had decided to send spies from Beijing, Wang responded by
saying that if he were a Chinese official in charge of espionage
work, he would have sent spies from Fujian Province, rather than
from Beijing.
