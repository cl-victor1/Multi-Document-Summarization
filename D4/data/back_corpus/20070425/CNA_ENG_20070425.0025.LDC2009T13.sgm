DRAFT AMENDMENTS ON ELDERLY STIPENDS PASS PRELIMINARY SCREENING
</HEADLINE>

Taipei, April 25 (CNA) 04/25/07  17:34:20 (By Elizabeth Hsu)

<P>
The legislative committees of health, the environment  and social
welfare passed 23 amendment  proposals targeting provisional
regulations on welfare stipends for the elderly Wednesday,
despite strong opposition from several social welfare
organizations.
</P>
<P>
Nine of the controversial amendment bills focus on a raise in the
stipend, with some proposals suggesting a boost in the amount
from the present NT$3,000 (US$90) per month to NT$4,000,
NT$5,000, NT$6,000, or even NT$10,000.
</P>
<P>
The draft  bills also propose  striking  off the existing
regulations that ban repeated issuance of various stipends, as
well as a provision that excludes rich people from stipend
programs.
</P>
<P>
A group of social welfare organization representatives described
the bills a day earlier as "money pits, " accusing some
politicians of attempting to "buy votes" through raising the
stipends ahead of the year-end legislative  elections  and the
2008 presidential election.
</P>
<P>
At the committee meeting, Vice Minister of the Interior Lin
Chung-sheng said that any increases in welfare subsidies have to
take the government's finances into account, must exclude rich
persons and must ban repeated issuance.
</P>
<P>
If the elderly stipend were to be expanded to NT$6,000 a month,
the government would have to find an extra NT$157.9 billion per
year, Lin warned.
</P>
<P>
The draft bills will undergo negotiations between the ruling and
opposition parties before being delivered to the Legislative
Yuan's plenary session for further screening.
