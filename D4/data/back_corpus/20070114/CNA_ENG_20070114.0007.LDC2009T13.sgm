Taipei,   Jan.   14  (CNA) 01/14/07  16:00:12 (By Deborah Kuo)

<P>
President  Chen Shui-bian  denied categorically Sunday newspaper
reports that he is planning to replace Premier Su Tseng-chang in
the wake of the Rebar Asia Pacific Group financial scandal.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a ceremony held in Tainan County, southern Taiwan to
mark a groundbreaking for the building of a Matou port historic
and cultural park, Chen said that he has not made any remarks
regarding changing premiers in recent days and that Su has been
doing a good job.
</P>
<P>
Chen said he is satisfied with Su's performance and appealed to
the public to continue supporting the premier.
</P>
<P>
Su went to see the president hours after Chen returned Saturday
from his four- day state visit to Nicaragua.
</P>
<P>
Chen reportedly expressed support for Su and his administration's
handling of the Rebar scandal and instructed them to get to the
bottom of the matter.
</P>
<P>
The scandal triggered a run on the Chinese Bank, an affiliate of
the Rebar Group, which lost NT$32 billion (US$977.3 million) in
deposits in three days. The country's chief financial regulator,
Shih Jun-ji, who is chairman of the Financial Supervisory
Commission (FSC) and a member of Su's Cabinet, resigned Saturday
over the incident.
</P>
<P>
Two subsidiaries of the Rebar Group, which consists of 120-odd
subsidiaries, applied for insolvency protection Dec. 29, and the
group's founder, Wang You- theng, fled to China Dec. 30.
Investigators have been probing into suspected embezzlement,
insider trading and fraud involving the group.
