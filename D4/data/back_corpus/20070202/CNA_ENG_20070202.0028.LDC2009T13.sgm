Taipei,  Feb. 2 (CNA) 02/02/07  18:16:00 (By Elizabeth Hsu)

The incidence rate of colorectal cancer has increased 43.5
percent during the period between 1994-2003, according to a
survey released Friday by the Bureau of Health Promotion (BOHP).
</P>
<P>
Every year there are more than 8,000 people diagnosed with
colorectal cancer in Taiwan on average, according to the results
of the survey, which also indicated that over 4,000 people around
the country die every year from this form of cancer.
</P>
<P>
Hsiao Chu-chun, head of the BOHP team in charge of cancer control
and prevention, said that despite the high mortality that makes
colorectal cancer the third largest cancer killer in Taiwan, most
Taiwan people having little awareness of the disease.
</P>
<P>
Citing data the BOHP collected from 29 hospitals around Taiwan in
2004, Hsiao said that over 53 percent of the total colorectal
cancer patients reported that year were either in the second or
third stage.
</P>
<P>
The number of colorectal cancer patients diagnosed at its early
stage only accounted for 17 percent of the entire population of
patients suffering from the disease, lagging behind the ratio of
29 percent recorded by the U.S. National Cancer Data Base in
2003, Hsiao said.
</P>
<P>
There were also relatively fewer colorectal cancer patients in
Taiwan living through the first five years since they were
diagnosed than in the United States, the BOHP official added,
saying they found that most Taiwan people do not have regular
health checks, which poses a threat to Taiwan's efforts in cancer
control and prevention.
</P>
<P>
The BOHP began a free stool test service in 2004 for people aged
50-69, but only 460,000 people have taken the test so far,
according to the bureau, which indicated that such a test, if
done regularly, could reduce the mortality rate of colorectal
cancer by 18 percent- 33 percent.
