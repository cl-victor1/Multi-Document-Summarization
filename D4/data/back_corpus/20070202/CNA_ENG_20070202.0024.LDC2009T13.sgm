PRO-INDEPENDENCE GROUP CLAIMS NEED TO CONTINUE INDEPENDENCE
PURSUIT

Taipei, Feb. 2 (CNA) 02/02/07  17:24:57 (By Y.F. Low)

<P>
The pro-independence Taiwan Society released a statement Friday
claiming the urgency and necessity for Taiwan to continue its
pursuit of independence in order to make Taiwan a "true country."
</P>
<P>
The statement appeared intended to reject a recent claim by
former President Lee Teng-hui that there is no need for Taiwan to
pursue independence  because "Taiwan is already an independent
country."
</P>
<P>
According to Lee, seeking independence is not only a "regressive"
and "dangerous" move that will downgrade Taiwan's status from a
sovereign independent state to a country that has not achieved
independence, but also a denial of Taiwan's democratic
achievements.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan needs to change its name, enact a new constitution and
"seek membership in the United Nations" to become a "normal
country, "Lee argued.
</P>
<P>
However, the Taiwan Society said Taiwan is only a sovereign,
independent "political entity" but "not a country."
</P>
<P>
"This is not a self-degrading statement, but a cruel reality, "
the group said.
</P>
<P>
Recognizing this fact long ago, pro-independence forerunners in
Taiwan ignited the flame of Taiwan independence when the country
was still under authoritarian rule, the group pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Claiming that democratization is a "sufficient condition" but
"not a necessary condition" to establish a new country, the group
said democratization does not automatically make Taiwan a
country.
</P>
<P>
"Democratization has only allowed the people of Taiwan to
retrieve their autonomy from an alien regime. The people of
Taiwan must exercise their autonomy correctly before they can
turn Taiwan into a true country," the group said.
</P>
<P>
As Taiwan has so far been unable to abandon the national title of
Republic of China or terminate the Constitution, Taiwan can only
remain a "political entity" that is struggling for its survival
in the international community, it said.
</P>
<P>
It said changing the name of Taiwan and enacting  a new
constitution are steps that will make Taiwan a true country and
achieve the goal of independence for Taiwan, adding that Taiwan
must first become a true sovereign, independent country before it
can become a "normal country."
