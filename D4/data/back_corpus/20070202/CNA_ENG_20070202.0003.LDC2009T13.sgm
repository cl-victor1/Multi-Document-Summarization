BALLOTS IN KAOHSIUNG MAYORAL ELECTION TO BE RECOUNTED
</HEADLINE>

Kaohsiung, Feb. 1 (CNA) 02/02/07  11:09:15 (By Y.C. Jou)
</P>
<P>
Ballots cast in last December's Kaohsiung mayoral election will
be recounted beginning March 12, Kaohsiung District Court
officials said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The ruling received praise from Huang Chun-ying, the opposition
Kuomintang (KMT) mayoral candidate defeated by Chen Chu of the
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) by just 1,114 votes, or 0.14
percent of the total, and filed a lawsuit seeking to nullify both
the election and Chen's victory.
</P>
<P>
"We trust the judiciary, " Huang said at a news conference, with
his lawyer adding that a recount is expected to overturn the Dec.
9 election result. Chen said the same day that the court ruling
was "unacceptable," claiming that Huang did not offer sufficient
evidence to merit a recount.
</P>
<P>
Based on the 2004 presidential election recount, which found
every polling station had at least five controversial ballots on
average, debatable ballots across Kaohsiung City's 839 polling
stations could be several times the narrow margin -- in an
election that counted more than 6,000 invalid votes, according to
the court ruling.
</P>
<P>
Tu Yu-to, a court spokesman, said the complainant had reported
nearly 100 irregularities involving nearly 100 polling stations.
</P>
<P>
He said the court had started preparations for the recount and
that 20 judges will each lead teams that will include election
affairs officials to conduct the recount, which is estimated to
take a week.
</P>
<P>
In his lawsuit, Huang contended that Chen's camp not only
violated election law by continuing campaign activities after the
10 p.m. election-eve deadline,  but also held a late-night press
conference to spread a rumor to smear his name.
</P>
<P>
The KMT candidate added that on the day of the election, even
President Chen Shui-bian made use of specific news media outlets
to accuse him of vote buying and to claim that even if Huang was
elected, his election results would be invalidated.
</P>
<P>
Huang insisted that the DPP's false accusation against him was in
disregard of the electoral law and "apparently" influenced the
results of the election and caused his defeat.
</P>
<P>
Huang has filed a separate lawsuit against Chen Chu's camp over
the vote-buying allegation.
