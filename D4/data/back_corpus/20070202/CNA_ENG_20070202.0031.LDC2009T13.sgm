Vice President Annette Lu expressed hope Friday that local
governments will do their utmost to preserve the ecology while
seeking technological development in an effort to maintain a
clean living environment for future generations.
</P>
<P>
Lu made the remarks during a meeting with Taoyuan county
officials on an inspection visit to County Hall.
</P>
<P>
In her address, Lu proposed the idea of dividing Taiwan into
"four provinces" -- Taipei, Taichung, Tainan and Taitung -- and
"two administrative districts" covering mountainous areas and
outlying islands.
</P>
<P>
The idea could serve as an inspiration to the central government
for plans to adjust administrative areas, she said.
</P>
<P>
In response to questions on her intention to take part in the
2008 presidential election, Lu claimed she has "never thought" of
participating.
</P>
<P>
Lu served as Taoyuan magistrate before taking her present post.
