CHINA

Taipei,  Feb. 2 (CNA) 02/02/07  20:56:01 (By Flor Wang)

The Cabinet-level Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) refused to
comment Friday about a reported hope of former President Lee
Teng-hui to visit China, saying that a ban on travel to China is
restricted to high ranking government officials and agents
involved in national security operations.
</P>
<P>
MAC Vice Chairman Liu Teh-hsun made the remarks at a regular news
briefing in response to reporters' questions about a recent
report by the Next Magazine that Lee hopes to visit China and
that he wants the government to open Taiwan to Chinese tourists
and capital.
</P>
<P>
Lee, now the so-called "spiritual leader" of the opposition
Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU) , also told the magazine that he
never supported Taiwan independence as Taiwan is already an
independent sovereignty and there is no need for the country to
pursue formal independence.
</P>
<P>
According to Liu, the MAC will not comment on the issue as every
individual in a democratic society is free to air his or her
views.
</P>
<P>
In response to speculation that Lee has once again changed his
attitude toward Taiwan's future, TSU Secretary-General Lin Chih-
chia said that Lee will clearly explain his stance on the issue
in the local media, including print media and radio stations, in
the coming days.
</P>
<P>
According to Lin, Lee will also take part in a TSU-sponsored
concert in commemoration of the 228 Incident to make his stance
on the issue well known to the party and the public.
</P>
<P>
Many supporters of the TSU and Lee have called the party and
relevant organizations to protest over Lee's remarks in the Next
Magazine.
</P>
<P>
In an effort to assuage the public anger provoked by Lee's latest
statement about Taiwan's future, the TSU ran an advertisement in
major print media Friday in which it said that "the former
president still insists on writing a new constitution for Taiwan
and on changing the country's official title to make it a normal
nation."
</P>
<P>
To allow the public to gain a comprehensive understanding of the
party's stance and ideals in this regard, TSU lawmakers will
increase their presence through call-in programs and letters to
newspapers, Lin said.
</P>
<P>
It was also reported that many backers of the Association of Lee
Teng-hui's Friends at home and abroad were very disappointed with
Lee's words and have suggested disbanding their units.
</P>
<P>
According  to an official  at the  association's  national
headquarters, Lee is not against Taiwan independence and everyone
has "misunderstood" his remarks. She said that many of Lee's
backers have accepted her explanation and have agreed not to
dissolve their local branches.
