SITUATION UNDER CONTROL REGARDING REBAR FOUNDER'S FLIGHT: MOFA
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  Feb.  2 (CNA) 02/02/07  21:53:56 (By Elizabeth Hsu)

The government remains in control of the situation surrounding
wanted Rebar Asia Pacific Group founder Wang You-theng and his
wife, despite Singapore's move to repatriate the pair back to the
United States, according to a statement released Friday by the
Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA).
</P>
<P>
MOFA Deputy Director General of Information and Cultural Affairs
Yen Fei-pi read a three-point statement at a press conference
held by the MOFA to explain the government's efforts to stop the
suspects, who allegedly embezzled billions of dollars in
corporate funds before going on the lam, from fleeing to Myanmar.
</P>
<P>
The statement first stated that the government had held accurate
information regarding the Wangs' movement before they boarded on
a Singapore-bound flight in Los Angeles Thursday, and had
therefore successfully frustrated the couple's attempt to flee to
a third country.
</P>
<P>
Second,  the  government  had conducted  negotiations  with
Singaporean authorities concerning the Wangs' case and provided
them with all the relevant information before those authorities
decided to repatriate the couple back to the United States, a
decision which Taiwan respects.
</P>
<P>
Third, the government is keeping the situation under control, and
will continue to apply all of its power to manage the issue.
</P>
<P>
Asked whether the government has been at a loss as to what to do
during the pursuit to nab the Wangs, Yeh answered that the Wangs
would have been successful in fleeing to Myanmar if the
government were at a loss.
</P>
<P>
The wanted couple arrived at Singapore's Changi International
Airport Friday morning after leaving the U.S. the previous day.
They fled to the U.S. from China late last year after two of the
Rebar group's  120-odd  member  companies applied  for
insolvency restructuring.
</P>
<P>
The fallout triggered a run on the Chinese Bank, another of the
group's affiliates. Subsequent judicial investigations found that
the couple, other family members and corporate executives were
involved in many suspected irregularities, including fraud,
embezzlement, breach of trust and insider trading.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Taiwan's judicial authorities and liaison officials
posted in the city- state engaged in intensive negotiations with
the Singaporean immigration authorities over the Wangs'
extradition.
</P>
<P>
The Singaporean authorities said before the negotiations that
there was no reason for them to take the Wangs into custody as
the couple had used authentic passports and normal travel papers
to enter the country.
