Taipei,  Jan. 6 (CNA) 01/06/07  18:15:55 (By Y.F. Low)

The Financial Supervisory Commission (FSC) urged clients of the
Chinese Bank Saturday to stop withdrawing their deposits,
stressing that their savings are secure now that the government
has taken over the bank.
</P>
<P>
The FSC decided late Friday to have the Central Deposit Insurance
Corp. (CDIC) take over the Chinese Bank -- a member of the Rebar
Asia Pacific Group -- in the wake of a bank run triggered by
insolvency of two other companies under the group.
</P>
<P>
FSC tallies show that clients withdrew a total of NT$15 billion
(US$xxxxx) from the bank on Friday.
</P>
<P>
During a news conference held on the issue Saturday, FSC Chairman
Shih Jun-ji said that the Chinese Bank is no longer a member of
the Rebar Group and has become a national bank, with all deposits
of clients enjoying unlimited protection from the government.
</P>
<P>
Shih said business of the bank will not be affected because the
CDIC has prepared more than NT$20 billion in cash to cope with
the needs of the bank's operations when it reopens Monday.
</P>
<P>
Claiming that Taiwan's financial system is very healthy with the
average overdue loan ratio of domestic financial institutions
having dropped to 2.35 percent, Shih said it is unlikely that any
large-scale financial crisis will occur in the country.
