PREMIER REAFFIRMS NEED FOR CONSTITUTIONAL REFORM
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  Jan. 6 (CNA) 01/06/07  13:39:51 (By Sofia Wu)

<P>
Taiwan indeed needs sweeping constitutional reform even though
pursuing it may ruffle China's feathers and touch a raw nerve in
America, Premier Su Tseng-chang said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Premier made the remarks while meeting with an academic group
composed of five scholars from Harvard University's Taiwan Study
Club, including Allan Romberg.
</P>
<P>
During their talks, the American academics asked Su about the
ruling Democratic Progressive Party's future development and
issues regarding Taiwan's two key elections in the coming two
years -- the legislative elections slated for later this year and
the 2008 presidential election.
</P>
<P>
Su said the DPP has managed to restore its reputation and morale
following its better-than-expected performance in the Dec. 9
mayoral and city council elections in Taiwan's two largest cities
-- Taipei and Kaohsiung.
</P>
<P>
The party now must cautiously and prudently deal with three
critical issues -- the year-end legislative elections which will
for the first time apply a "single-member constituency and two
votes" electoral system,  constitutional reform and presentation
of a presidential/vice presidential ticket for the 2008 election.
</P>
<P>
While constitutional reform topics are likely to irritate China
and strike a raw nerve in the United States, Su said Taiwan badly
needs to overhaul its constitutional system to ensure good
governance and maintain a competitive edge in the global market.
</P>
<P>
According  to Su,  some of Taiwan's current constitutional
provisions  no longer suit its national situation  and needs,
particularly its outdated demarcation of administrative districts
and ambiguous relationships among the president, the Executive
Yuan and the Legislative Yuan.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the country's Constitution has undergone several
rounds of amendments over the past decade, including adoption of
direct popular presidential elections, adoption of a referendum
system and the abolishment of the National Assembly, Su said the
smooth and successful implementation of all these reforms
embodies Taiwan's democratic maturity and its capability  to deal
with constitutional reform issues rationally.
</P>
<P>
Given the high threshold for any constitutional reform proposal
to be approved, Su said forging a national consensus is key to
success of any future constitutional overhaul plan.
</P>
<P>
In addition to upgrading administrative efficiency, Su said, a
new round of constitutional reforms is necessary for Taiwan to
sustain its national development, adding that it can also
contribute to Taiwan's democratic education and inspire local
people's interest and participation in Taiwan's political
development.
</P>
<P>
For the 2008 presidential election, Su said, the DPP has primary
and consultation mechanisms to choose its candidate. "We must
seek the best way to produce our ticket to ensure party unity and
electoral victory," he noted.
</P>
<P>
As to relations across the Taiwan Strait, Su said the DPP
administration has consistently strived to improve cross-strait
ties under the premise that Taiwan's national security, interests
and sovereignty cannot be compromised.
</P>
<P>
Su said that during his 12 months as premier, Taiwan has adopted
many "open- door" measures, including allowing lower-end wafer
fabs to relocate to China and pushing for cross-strait
negotiations to pave the way for Chinese citizens to make
sightseeing trips to Taiwan.
