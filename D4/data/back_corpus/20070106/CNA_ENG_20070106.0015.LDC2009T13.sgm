KMT CHAIRMAN STRESSES RESOLVE TO PROMOTE CLEAN POLITICS

The Kuomintang (KMT) is determined to promote clean politics,  a
stable administration and clear-cut policies if it regains power
in the future, KMT Chairman Ma Ying-jeou said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Ma made the pledge during a seminar with KMT members at the
party's branch in Chiayi county in southern Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
In response to some comrades' criticism that the KMT lost the
hard-fought Dec. 9 Kaohsiung mayoral election because of its
"wrong" electioneering strategy, Ma stressed that "clean
politics" is the party's core value and pointed out that he would
rather lose an election than resort to buying votes.
</P>
<P>
Although the KMT lost the Kaohsiung mayoral race by only a very
slim margin, Ma said that he does not believe that sticking to
the principle of clean elections is wrong.
</P>
<P>
He said that he is content with the fact that the KMT seized 17
seats in the Kaohsiung City Council election which was held
alongside the mayoral election -- becoming the largest party in
the city council and successfully changing the past impression
held by the public about the KMT.
</P>
<P>
Ma also criticized the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)
for its poor performance since it came to power in 2000, claiming
that the DPP's incompetence in terms of maintaining political
stability has seriously hurt the country -- something which he
said is even worse than corruption.
</P>
<P>
The KMT is resolved  to become  a "righteous,  clean and
competitive" political party so as to win greater support from
the people, he pledged.
</P>
<P>
The KMT now is Taiwan's largest opposition party after losing
power to the DPP in 2000.
