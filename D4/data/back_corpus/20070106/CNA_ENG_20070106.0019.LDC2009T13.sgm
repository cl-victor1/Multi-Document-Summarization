The number of long-distance passengers on railway system has
declined 20 percent following the formal launch of the much-
heralded high-speed rail service Friday, Chen Feng-nan, director-
general of the Taiwan Railway Administration (TRA), said
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Chen noted that the Taiwan High-Speed Rail Corp. (THSRC) , the
operator of the 345-km high-speed rail service, is offering a
50-percent discount to attract passengers. The real impact on the
TRA will only be seen after ticket price returns to normal, he
added.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Transportation and Communications has asked the
TRA to study whether to give a 30-percent discount to long-
distance passengers during off- peak hours to deal with the
fierce competition from the high-speed rail service.
</P>
<P>
However, Chen said that "this idea has to be studied further."
Noting that if long-distance passengers are given a 30-percent
discount, then an increase in passenger traffic of 43 percent
will be needed to offset the cost.
</P>
<P>
"The questions of whether to offer discounts and how much of a
discount to offer will have to await further assessment of the
real impact of the high-speed rail service on the TRA," he added.
</P>
<P>
The THSRC had originally decided to give a 50-percent discount
between Jan. 5-14. However, a faulty ticket booking system
resulted in overbooking, so the THSRC promised to add train
service, offer free tickets as well as extend the ticket-discount
period to Jan. 19 to appease disgruntled passengers

The high-speed rail service between Banciao, Taipei and Zuoying,
Kaohsiung has reduced travel time between the two points to 90
minutes from four hours in the past.
