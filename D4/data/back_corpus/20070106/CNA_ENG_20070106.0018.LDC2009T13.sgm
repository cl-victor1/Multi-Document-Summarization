MAJORITY WANT REFERENDUM ON TAIWAN'S U.N. BID: SURVEY
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  Jan.  6 (CNA) 01/06/07  17:04:10 (By Elizabeth Hsu)
</P>
<P>
A majority of the Taiwan people are concerned about the long-
stalled arms procurement bill as well as the setback in Taiwan's
bid to join the United Nations, according to the results of
Taiwan Thinktank's latest survey.
</P>
<P>
The non-profit public policy research organization held a press
conference Saturday in Taipei to reveal the results of the
survey, titled "Arms Procurement Project and Taiwan's U.N. Bid, "
which was conducted by telephone Dec. 27-28 on 1,085 randomly
selected people aged over 20 around the island.
</P>
<P>
Four scholars and experts were invited to interpret the results
in the press conference hosted by Taiwan Thinktank executive
member Lo Chih-yuan. They were Liu Shih-chung, deputy chief of
the Research and Planning Committee under the Ministry of Foreign
Affairs; Huang Wei-fung, a former vice chairman of the Mainland
Affairs Council; Hsu Yung-ming, an assistant researcher at the
Academia Sinica's Research Center for Humanities and Social
Sciences; and Lin Shih-chia, chief executive of the Foundation of
Medical Professional Alliance in Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
According to the poll, 44.8 percent of the respondents answered
"yes" when asked whether Taiwan's national security will be
affected if the arms procurement bill continues to be blocked in
the legislature, while 33.7 percent responded "no."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, 65 percent said that it will affect Taiwan-U.S. ties,
and 46.1 percent said the legislature should pass the bill for
the purchase of an arms package from the United States.
</P>
<P>
Hsu said that supporters of the ruling and opposition parties
seem to have different views on the arms bill's role in terms of
national security but appear to be in more agreement on the
question of whether the Taiwan-U.S. relationship will be harmed
if the bill continues to be blocked.
</P>
<P>
He said this may because of public remarks made by Stephen M.
Young, head of the Taipei Office of the American Institute in
Taiwan, at the end of October last year revealing the U.S.
government's impatience  with Taiwan's continued delay in passing
the arms procurement bill.
</P>
<P>
On the issue of Taiwan's U.N. bid, the survey showed that more
than 73 percent of the respondents are concerned that Taiwan's
international competitiveness will be badly eroded by the fact
that Taiwan is not a U.N. member. Meanwhile, over 50 percent said
that Taiwan's lack of U.N. membership will affect its national
security, and 62.9 percent said that Taiwan gaining membership
would help cross-Taiwan Strait relations.
</P>
<P>
The survey also showed that 47.9 percent support the idea of
applying for U.N. membership under the name "Taiwan, " while 37.6
percent said it's better to use the name "Republic of China."
</P>
<P>
Despite the different opinions, 77 percent of the respondents
expressed support for the idea of holding a national referendum
on Taiwan's U.N. bid.
</P>
<P>
Liu said the survey results reveal three important facts, namely
that a majority of the Taiwan people have feelings of discontent
toward the United Nations for shutting Taiwan out, most of the
Taiwan people support the government's U.N. bid despite the
difficulties, and most are in favor of holding a national
referendum on the issue.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, when asked about China's efforts to suppress Taiwan's
voice in the international community, 47.1 percent of the
respondents said this will only strengthen their resolve to rally
behind the government's U.N. bid, while 33.6 percent said this
will make it less likely that Taiwan's bid will succeed.
</P>
<P>
The survey has a margin of error of plus or minus 2.97 percentage
points.
