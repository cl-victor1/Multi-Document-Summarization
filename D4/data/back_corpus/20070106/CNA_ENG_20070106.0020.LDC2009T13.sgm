Environmental Protection Administration (EPA) Minister Chang Kuo-
lung took part in a clean-up activity on Mashan Beach on the
outlying island of Kinmen Saturday on the nation's first
environment clean-up day.

Accompanied by Kinmen County Magistrate Lee Chu-feng and main
opposition Kuomintang lawmaker Wu Cherng-dean, Chang participated
in the clean-up activity with nearly 500 soldiers stationed on
the island -- which lies just two kilometers from the mainland
Chinese city of Xiamen in Fujian province.

Chang's move was part of an EPA campaign aimed at clearing away
the increasing amounts of trash floating to the beach from China.
</P>
<P>
According to Chang, the Cabinet-level EPA has allocated over NT$4
million per year to help Kinmen authorities clear away the
garbage accumulating on the beach.

<P>
The EPA is also assessing concrete measures to prevent more
garbage from China from landing on Kinmen's coast, including
setting up nets off the coast to block the flow of garbage, Chang
said, expressing the hope of developing Kinmen into a popular
tourist destination to boost the local economy.
</P>
<P>
According to Lee, Kinmen has been facing the problem of growing
amounts of garbage floating in from China, mainly from Xiamen
city, which he said poses a serious threat to public health on
the outlying island. Last year, Kinmen authorities cleared away a
total of 800 metric tons of trash, he noted.
