FAILED CHINESE BANK TO BE LIQUIDATED: VICE PREMIER
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,   Jan.  13  (CNA) 01/13/07  15:18:57 (By Sofia Wu)
</P>
<P>
The government will accelerate an assessment of the failed
Chinese Bank's assets and liabilities in preparation for its
liquidation, Vice Premier Tsai Ing-wen said Friday.
</P>
<P>
"The Financial Reconstruction Fund Management Commission will
authorize the Central Deposit Insurance Corp. (CDIC) to handle
the assessment and tender invitation matters," Tsai said at a
Friday news conference in which she announced Premier Su Tseng-
chang's assent to the resignation of Financial Supervisory
Commission (FSC) Chairman Shih Jun-ji over the recent Chinese
Bank fiasco.
</P>
<P>
The state-run CDIC took over the Chinese Bank, an affiliate of
the financially troubled Rebar Asia Pacific Group, after a run on
the bank broke out Jan. 5 following two other Rebar subsidiaries'
applications for insolvency reorganization a day earlier. The
bank run eased only after the CDIC and the Financial
Reconstruction Fund stepped in with full cash support.
</P>
<P>
Tsai said the government hopes the Chinese Bank liquidation or
sell-off can be finalized in six months.
</P>
<P>
As the Rebar group reportedly controls more than 120 companies
spanning manufacturing, communications, media, banking, financial
and other services, Tsai said, the Executive Yuan will keep close
tabs on its affiliates' operations.
</P>
<P>
"The government will help structurally or financially healthy
Rebar affiliates maintain normal operations for the benefits of
their employees, clients and up- and downstream suppliers," Tsai
said.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Tsai went on, the FSC will be required to cooperate
closely with judicial authorities in investigating whether there
were any irregularities in Rebar dealings with Eastern Multimedia
Group, which is headed by a son of the Rebar Group founder Wang
You-theng, as well as whether Rebar's three major financial
service offshoots -- the Great Chinese Bills finance Co., Union
Insurance Co. and the Chinese Bank -- have been involved in any
illegal dealings in the past decade.
</P>
<P>
"We are determined to get to the bottom of the matter and bring
to justice all those accountable for the group's recent financial
fiasco," Tsai said.
</P>
<P>
In addition to Shih's resignation over the Chinese Bank run
crisis, Tsai said Tseng Kuo-lieh, director of the FSC's Bureau of
Banking Affairs, has also been relieved of his post.
</P>
<P>
At his own request, Tseng has been transferred to an advisory
post, Tsai said, adding that FSC Vice Chairwoman Susan Chang will
concurrently take over the vacant position.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the Rebar financial storm involves very complicated
elements and has been brewing for a long time, Tsai said the
Executive Yuan will form a special task force to probe who should
be held responsible for the group's many suspected irregularities
before determining disciplinary measures.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on the same occasion, outgoing FSC Chairman Shih Jun-ji
said he will do his utmost to maintain domestic financial
stability until he passes the helm to his successor.
</P>
<P>
The scholar-turned-official said he regrets the recent bank run
that has caused public misgivings about the country's financial
well-being.
</P>
<P>
"I must step down to take the blame and shoulder the political
responsibility for the mess, " Shih said, adding that the FSC
will continue assisting the judicial authorities in probing the
hollowing out of Rebar corporate assets to stave off any future
financial scandals.
</P>
<P>
Shih,  originally an FSC commissioner,  took over the FSC
chairmanship last August, making him the shortest-serving FSC
head.
</P>
<P>
The authorities are investigating Rebar's suspected financial
crimes,  including insider trading, phony accounting practices,
embezzlement  of corporate funds and violations  of accounting
regulations and banking law.
