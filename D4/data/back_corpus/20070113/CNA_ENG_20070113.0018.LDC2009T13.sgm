The Taiwan External Trade Development Council (TAITRA) is
organizing a business delegation that will make a fact-finding
visit to Vietnam in March, TAITRA officials said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The number of trading opportunities have been boosted in Vietnam
-- the World Trade Organization's (WTO's) 150th member -- in the
past few years, attracting many foreign investors, including
Taiwan's Hon Hai Group, a high tech manufacturer.
</P>
<P>
According to the TAITRA officials, Vietnam enjoyed an 8.4 percent
economic growth rate in 2005, one of the world's best
performances in terms of economic development.  With its newly
acquired  WTO membership, the country is expected to attract even
more foreign investment.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan is one of the largest investors in Vietnam and reports
have said that many Taiwan enterprises are intent on following in
Hon Hai's footsteps and making inroads into the emerging market.
</P>
<P>
TAITRA plans to recruit representatives from 20 local businesses
to join the delegation that will visit Ho Chih Minh City and
Hanoi March 25-31, the officials said, noting that during the
trip, Vietnamese officials will be invited to attend TAITRA-
organized presentations to introduce the country's investment
environment.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the semi-official trade promotion unit will also
invite food producers and traders to attend the 2007
International Food Fair slated for April 24-27 in Seoul, South
Korea.
</P>
<P>
The event is regarded as a good opportunity for local businesses
to enter the South Korean food market, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
The Seoul food fair, the 25th of its kind, is expected to attract
900 businesses from 30 countries around the world and around
30,000 people, including 1,200 potential buyers, according to the
officials.
</P>
<P>
TAITRA plans to open a Taiwan image presentation center at the
fair to promote Taiwan products.
