President Chen Shui-bian asked Premier Su Tseng-chang  and his
administration to deal with the scandal surrounding the Rebar
Group rigorously and to prosecute those responsible to the full
extent of law, a spokesman for the Executive Yuan said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Cheng Wen-tsang, minister of the Government Information Office,
said Su went to see the president hours after Chen returned to
the country after a four-day visit to Nicaragua.
</P>
<P>
Cheng said the president, who had cautioned the premier to be
more vigilant in preventing financial crises, backed the premier
and his administration's handling of the scandal and instructed
them to get to the bottom of the matter.
</P>
<P>
The scandal triggered a run against the Chinese Bank, an
affiliate of the Rebar Group, which lost NT$32 billion (US$977.3
million) in deposits in three days, and the country's chief
financial regulator Shih Jun-ji, who is chairman of the Financial
Supervisory Commission (FSC) and a member of Su's Cabinet,
resigned over the incident.
</P>
<P>
Cheng said the premier briefed the president on the latest
developments in the scandal but did not raise the question of who
should fill the vacancy left by Shih.
</P>
<P>
After his meeting with the president, Cheng said, the premier
huddled with his chief economic officials over the scandal and
asked them to cushion the scandal's impact on the country's
finances and help the normal operation of Rebar's subsidiaries,
while bringing those responsible for the scandal to justice.
</P>
<P>
The Rebar Group which consists of 120-odd subsidiaries, declared
insolvency Dec. 29 and its founder, Wang You-theng, fled to China
the next day leaving behind a financial mess of embezzlement,
insider trading and fraud.
</P>
<P>
In a related development Saturday, FSC Vice Chairwoman Susan
Chang said the commission had referred evidence of Wang You-
theng's involvement in insider trading to prosecutors.
