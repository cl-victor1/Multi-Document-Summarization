The Sinjan Auto Auction (SAA), an affiliate of the Yulon Group,
has launched Point of Sale (POS) electronic auction system under
a collaboration with Acer Computer aimed at the local and
international market for used cars, SAA Chairman Su Ching-yang
said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Acer and SAA, the nation's largest used car auctioneer, intend to
introduce the system to China, Japan and Thailand, according to
Su.
</P>
<P>
Instead of using a Japanese system, SAA worked with Acer in order
to acquire its own technology platform, Su said, adding that the
newly launched system will help expand the auction scale for used
cars in Taiwan and help it enter the international market,
especially China.
</P>
<P>
China has unlimited market development for second-hand vehicles,
with used car sales there increasing for three consecutive years
and only a 26.4 percent growth rate in new car sales in 2006, Su
quoted statistics of the China Automobile Dealers Association as
saying.
</P>
<P>
Su vowed to make SAA a leading brand in the second-hand car
business in Chinese speaking areas and added that the POS system
will be introduced to China as long as related regulations can be
approved.
