RAPID TRANSIT LINE IN PINGTUNG COUNTY TO BE ELEVATED
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Pingtung County,  April 18 (CNA) 04/18/07  20:34:16 (By Han Nai-
kuo)
</P>
<P>
A 19-km rapid transit rail line linking Pingtung County with the
greater Kaohsiung area will be entirely elevated so that there
will not be any level crossings causing traffic congestion,
Pingtung County Magistrate Tsao Chi-hung announced Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Tsao told a press conference that the Cabinet-level Council for
Economic Planning and Development (CEPD) has agreed to the county
government's request to change the CEPD's original plan by
elevating the entire rapid transit line and increasing the budget
from NT$5.96 billion to NT$15.25 billion (US$459 million).
</P>
<P>
The revised plan will not only make 24 level crossings in
Pingtung County redundant, but also allow a new highway to be
constructed under the rapid transit line, according to Tsao.
</P>
<P>
He said the project is scheduled for completion in June 2011, and
that eventually this rapid transit line will be served by 220
trains a day, linking Pingtung County with the greater Kaohsiung
area's rapid transit system and the Taiwan High Speed Rail's
terminal at Zuoying.
</P>
<P>
Many real estate brokers sent representatives to the press
conference to learn about the new, revised project because the
elevated railway is expected to increase local property values.
