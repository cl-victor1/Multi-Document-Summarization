TAIWAN-U.S. FTA WOULD BE MUTUALLY BENEFICIAL: CLA CHIEF
</HEADLINE>

Washington,  April 18 (CNA) 04/18/07  19:26:59 (By Jorge Liu and

Taiwan's top labor affairs official said Tuesday that the signing
of a free trade agreement (FTA) between Taiwan and the United
States would be mutually beneficial for the United States, China
and Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Council of Labor Affairs (CLA) Chairman Lee Ying-yuan made the
remarks as he wound up a visit to the United States in which he
pushed for the signing of an FTA between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Lee, who arrived in Washington Sunday, said it is still difficult
for the United States to sign an FTA with Taiwan, but added that
the situation is "not completely hopeless."
</P>
<P>
According to Lee, if both sides were to sign an FTA, it would be
beneficial for the United States, China and Taiwan and that China
should have no reason to oppose it.
</P>
<P>
He noted that Taiwan is a major investor in China and that each
year a great number of Taiwan tourists visit China, spending tens
of billions of dollars there. China would indirectly benefit from
a Taiwan-U.S. FTA, he said.
</P>
<P>
Lee noted that the present political atmosphere in the United
States is more conservative and that the Democrat-controlled U.S.
Congress is more reserved about signing FTAs with other
countries. But he added that there are still a lot of U.S.
congressmen who sympathize with and support Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
With the Trade Promotion Authority (TPA)-- a fast-track
arrangement that allows the Bush administration to negotiate
trade deals and present them to Congress for a simple yes-or-no
vote -- approaching its expiration date at the end of June, it is
believed that it will be even more difficult for the United
States to sign FTAs with other countries after that.
</P>
<P>
But Lee said he learned from think tanks that Nancy Pelopsi,
speaker of the U.S. House, might leave room for compromises on
bills that are not related to ideological issues. The possibility
that the TPA will be extended cannot be ruled out, he added.
</P>
<P>
Lee delivered speeches to think tanks and lobbied congressional
support for the signing of an FTA during his visit, which will
wrap up April 19.
