Taipei,  April  18 (CNA) 04/18/07  23:36:39 (By Nick Huang)

A junior high school in Yilan County dismissed as "sheer
speculation" Wednesday a media report claiming that
electromagnetic waves from a high-voltage power transmission
facility in the school's vicinity might be related to the
relatively high susceptibility of cancer among its students.
</P>
<P>
According to the report carried in the Taipei-based China Times
daily Tuesday, the Nanao Junior High School has only 200-plus
student, but four of its students have been diagnosed with cancer
over the past four years, prompting school authorities to wonder
whether electromagnetic waves from the nearby high-voltage power
transmission facility should be blamed for the phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
In response, Nanao school principal Wu Ling-mei said the report
was full of mistakes.
</P>
<P>
Wu said that a Nanao student indeed died of cancer eight years
ago, not four years ago as reported. As for the remaining three
ailing students, Wu said, they were all diagnosed with cancer
during their elementary schools and one of them was relocated to
Yilan from Taoyuan County.
</P>
<P>
It requires verification by professional medical experts and
scholars to determine whether their illnesses have anything to do
with the power transmission facility, Wu said.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Wu said, the school has never taken the initiative to
collect information about its students' illness for supply to the
media nor has it bother to speculate on the possible cause of
their diseases.
</P>
<P>
To the best of her knowledge, Wu said, the China Times reporter
had never visited the school before writing the article. Wu said
the school has asked the newspaper to correct its misleading
report.
