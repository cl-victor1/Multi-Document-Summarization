President Chen Shui-bian Sunday declared "Four Wants and One
Withoutconcerning Taiwan's status and its relations with China.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan wants independence, wants name rectification, wants a new
Constitution, and wants development, Chen said at a dinner in
Taipei celebrating the 25th anniversary of the Washington-based
Formosan Association for Public Affairs (FAPA) ,  a non-profit
organization promoting Taiwan's cause.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan faces no such problem as to leftist or rightist policy
lines, he continued, saying there are only the problem of
national identity, and the problem of whether to unify with China
or to secure Taiwan's formal independence.
</P>
<P>
Chen said Taiwan is a sovereign state independent of China, and
its independence is Taiwan people's common goal.The pursuit of
Taiwan's independence is not a dangerous regression but the
noblest undertaking,he said.
</P>
<P>
He saidTaiwanis the best name to be used in the country's bid to
join the United Nations and other international organizations.
</P>
<P>
To become a normal and complete state, he said, Taiwan needs a
new Constitution that suits the country. He said the high
conditions set for an amendment to the Constitution are not
something to be worried about, andwe will succeed as long as
everybody works together with concerted efforts and one goal.
</P>
<P>
In his 2000 inaugural address Chen pledged that as long as
Beijing had no intention of using military force against Taiwan,
during his time in office, he would not declare independence, not
change Taiwan's name, not add the state-to- state theory to the
Constitution, not promote a referendum on the independence versus
unification issue, and there would not be the problem of whether
to abolish the National Unification  Guidelines  and the National
Unification Council -- positions collectively known as the "Five
Noes" doctrine.
