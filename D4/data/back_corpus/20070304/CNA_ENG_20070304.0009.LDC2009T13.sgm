People throughout Taiwan are joining a series of celebrations
marking the "Year of the Pig" Lantern Festival, which falls on
March 4.
</P>
<P>
The main event of the 2007 Taiwan Lantern Festival is an
exhibition in Chiayi County, southern Taiwan. The lantern
exhibition is organized by the Tourism Bureau and the Chiayi
county government.

The centerpiece of the exhibition is a Taiwan boar standing
18-meters tall, weighing 20 metric tons and able to rotate 360
degrees. President Chen Shui-bian will light up the main lantern
at a ceremony Sunday night to formally inaugurate the exhibition.

The Chiayi county government has invited five foreign and 11
local troupes, along with street artists, to give daily
performances at the festival March 3-11. The performances will
include Indian music, Russian stunts, Taiwanese lion dances and
Beikuan music.

County government  officials estimate that the festival is
expected to attract more than 6 million visitors from both home
and abroad and provide a shot in the arm to the county's tourism
industry.

The 2007 Lantern Festival is also being celebrated in other
cities and counties around Taiwan, including Taipei, Taichung,
Tainan Kaohsiung, and Taitung.

The city of Taipei kicked off its 2007 Lantern Festival Feb. 24
with the lighting of a "Lantern Tunnel" stretching 4.5 kilometers
along the Renai Road -- a boulevard linking the City Hall to the
Chiang Kai-shek Memorial Hall square, where a lantern exhibition
is being held March 3 - 11.

The Taipei city government will give away 60,000 small lanterns
to the public at the exhibition site during the festival on a
first-come-first-first-served basis.

<P>
Other cities will distribute a total of 120,000 small lanterns as
gifts to visitors to their lantern exhibitions.

President Chen presided over a lantern lighting ceremony for
Kaohsiung on March 3 on the bank of the city's Love River.

Kaohsiung's six sister cities -- Busan in South Korea, Hachioji
in Japan, and Portland, Macon, Colorado Springs, and San Antonio
in the United States -- have sent delegations to join Kaohsiung's
2007 Lantern Festival celebrations from March 3. The delegations
from Busan and Hachioji will present musical performances to
visitors at the lantern exhibition.

The Kaohsiung city government has indicated that it will use the
annual event to help promote the 2009 World Games, to be hosted
by the southern Taiwan port city.

The city of Taichung in central Taiwan began its Lantern Festival
celebrations Feb. 26 at a forest park, with a 20-meter-tall
