EXPLOITING ETHNIC RIFT SHOULD BE CONDEMNED: LEGISLATIVE SPEAKER
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Nantou County, March 4 (CNA) 03/04/07  18:53:17 (By Han Nai-kuo)
</P>
<P>
The main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) should be bold to condemn
those who exacerbate rifts between Taiwanese and "mainlanders,"
Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Wang, who has not yet declared his candidacy for president in the
2008 election but acknowledges that he is preparing for the race,
stressed that he is "absolutely not the person" who has tried to
fragment Taiwanese society by provoking a confrontation between
natives and those who hail from the mainland.
</P>
<P>
Wang made the remarks when asked to respond to reports that some
KMT members had criticized him for being so blunt as to say that
former KMT Chairman Ma Ying- jeou would have little chance of
being elected as president because voters in southern Taiwan
would not vote for a mainlander.
</P>
<P>
He said he was not trying to provoke a rift between Taiwan's
people, but was merely urging the KMT to pay attention to a
strategy the ruling Democratic Progressive Party might use
against Ma in the run-up to the 2008 presidential election.
</P>
<P>
"The Kuomintang should face the issue bravely," he said, adding
that the nation can expect to have stability and prosperity again
only when the KMT is back in power.
</P>
<P>
Wang is seen as a major rival of Ma in the KMT's presidential
primary election.
</P>
<P>
Ma declared his candidacy for president when announcing his
resignation as KMT chairman on Feb. 13 after he was indicted by a
Taipei prosecutor on charges of embezzlement involving the use of
special Taipei city government funds during his terms as Taipei
mayor.
</P>
<P>
Wang claimed last week that Ma may not be able to take the
presidency even if he wins the election because the Central
Election Commission  may initiate litigation  to deprive  a
successful presidential candidate of his office if he is
convicted and sentenced to a prison term.
</P>
<P>
He later said further that he does not believe a defendant in a
corruption  case should run for president.  He also made the
observation that voters in southern Taiwan would not vote for a
mainlander as their next president, although he did not mention
Ma by name.
</P>
<P>
Ma, a native of Hunan province, was born in Hong Kong in 1950
while his parents were staying in the former British colony
before moving to Taiwan after the KMT government lost the Chinese
mainland to the Chinese Communists.
