Taipei, March 12 (CNA) 03/12/07  18:49:46 (By Lilian Wu)
</P>
<P>
Minister of National Defense Lee Jye said Monday that he will not
seek to have his membership of the main opposition Kuomintang
(KMT) reinstated.
</P>
<P>
Lee, whose membership was revoked last week by the KMT, made the
remarks while fielding questions at a legislative committee.
</P>
<P>
Lee also dismissed a suggestion by legislators of the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) that he should join the DPP
and serve as the running mate of Premier Su Tseng-chang should Su
be chosen as the DPP's candidate in the 2008 presidential
election.
</P>
<P>
"I'm not going to enter politics," Lee said.
</P>
<P>
Lee earlier said that "it will be best for me to become free from
political affiliation in my task to make the military politically
neutral."
</P>
<P>
He said the policy of military neutrality will continue.
</P>
<P>
He also said that as a KMT member for the past 50 years, he had
"an attachment" to the party, and he would not be hard on the
party.
</P>
<P>
Lee's membership was revoked by the KMT the previous week on the
grounds that he had seriously tainted the KMT's reputation and
eroded the military's morale by agreeing with an Executive Yuan
decision to remove all statues of the late President Chiang Kai-
shek from military facilities around the country.
</P>
<P>
The KMT noted that the late Chiang was president of the Huangpu
Military Academy, the predecessor of Taiwan's military academy
aimed at nurturing elite military officers.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the legislative caucus of the opposition Taiwan
Solidarity Union (TSU) said it will propose revising the law
requiring generals to withdraw from political parties.
</P>
<P>
Tseng Tsang-teng, a TSU caucus whip, said the move would help
achieve the goal of military neutrality in politics.
