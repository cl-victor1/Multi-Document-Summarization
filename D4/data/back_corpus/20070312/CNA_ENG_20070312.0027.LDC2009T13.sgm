Language study is the first choice for further education for
workers in both Taiwan and China, followed by management study,
professional certification and higher education, a spokesman for
job search Web site 104 Job Bank said Monday.

According to the spokesman, the survey conducted by the Web site
Jan. 15-31 on white collar learning trends on both sides of the
Taiwan Strait, received 1,843 valid replies from Taiwan
respondents and 424 from China.

The results of the survey show that 66.5 percent of respondents
on both sides of the straits studied outside office hours in
2006, and 84.7 percent expressed willingness to do so in 2007 so
that they can compete better. Some 8.3 percent in Taiwan said
they would like to choose art and design, because the aesthetics
industry is becoming popular, the spokesman said.

About 78 percent of Taiwan's top management took further
education in 2006, higher than China's 62.5 percent. Some 71.3
percent of Taiwan's middle management, 68.1 percent of
supervisors, and 64.8 percent of workers pursued further studies.
However, 77.3 percent of China's respondents have professional
certificates, much higher than Taiwan's 40.1 percent.

ability" ranked first at 62.5 percent, followed by "learning
second special skill" at 53.3 percent, "interest" at 40.6 percent
and "higher salary" at 31.4 percent.
