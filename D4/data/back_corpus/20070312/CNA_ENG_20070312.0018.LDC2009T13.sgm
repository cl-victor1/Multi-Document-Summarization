China's People's Liberation Army (PLA) has continued to beef up
its contingency response capability and conducted more than 30
military exercise drills targeting Taiwan last year, Defense
Minister Lee Jye said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Reporting at the Legislative National Defense Committee, Lee the
PLA -- having honed its combat abilities through numerous war
games --  is  now  capable  of launching  a  quick,  "triphibian,
three-dimensional" landing assault on Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Lee said China now has over 20 satellites on orbit tracks for
military intelligence gathering, telecommunications,  navigation,
scientific research and meteorological monitoring, allowing it to
conduct round-the-clock,  all-weather surveillance  of Taiwan's
military activities.
</P>
<P>
On the PLA's naval combat ability, Lee said the number of PLA
warships and submarines has continued to increase, with their
weapons' ranges growing simultaneously.
</P>
<P>
In addition, he went on, the PLA has been building and acquiring
aircraft carriers -- all aimed at keeping foreign military forces
at bay and from entering the Taiwan Strait so that Taiwan "can be
attacked front and rear" by the PLA.
</P>
<P>
In his report, Lee said China has increased its budget for
military build-up for 2007 to 350.9 billion yuan, up a whopping
17.8 percent over the year-earlier level.
</P>
<P>
Lee went on that the PLA has over 900 ballistic and guided
missiles aimed at Taiwan, with the number increasing by 75-100
year-on-year,  in addition to some 500 new-generation fighters
equipped with long-distance or cross-continental assault weaponry
systems.
</P>
<P>
Noting that military might across the Taiwan Strait has developed
unequally, with the edge tipping tremendously toward China, Lee
said Taiwan's national security will be in irreparable jeopardy
should no action be taken to beef up the country's military
preparedness.
