Academia Sinica President Wong Chi-huey and his predecessor,
Nobel laureate Lee Yuan-tseh, arrived in Israel Sunday at the
head of an Academia Sinica delegation to attend a bilateral
science and technology seminar.

<P>
The Academia Sinica delegation is taking part in the bilateral
seminar on science and technology exchanges and cooperation at
the invitation of the Israel Academy of Sciences and Humanities
(IASH).
</P>
<P>
Wong, Lee and other members of the delegation met with IASH
President Menachem Yaari and Aaron Ciechanover -- co-winner of
the 2004 Nobel Prize in chemistry -- as well as Daniel Zajfman,
president of Israel's Weizman Institute of Science, at a dinner
party Sunday hosted in their honor by Terry Ting, Taiwan's
representative in Israel.

Speaking at the dinner party, Lee, co-winner of the Nobel Prize
in chemistry in 1986 who served as Academia Sinica president from
1994-2006, said he visited IASH during the first year of his
tenure as president of Taiwan's top research institute and signed
a cooperative agreement on behalf of the institute with IASH
during that visit.

For his part, Wong, an internationally acclaimed biologist who
took the helm of Academia Sinica in October 2006, said Israel is
a country with a well-developed science and technology sector
that is worthy of emulation by Taiwan. "It is hoped that Taiwan
and Israel will maintain closer bilateral ties by further
enhancing their science and technology exchanges," he added.
</P>
<P>
Also addressing the dinner party, Ting said it is an honor to
host a dinner attended by two Nobel laureates and other top-notch
scientists.
</P>
<P>
Aaron Ciechanover, who won the 2004 Nobel Prize in chemistry
along with two other Israeli scientists, said that he visited
Taiwan twice last year and that each time was amazed by how
members of the general public worshipped Lee wherever he went.
</P>
<P>
"Scientists are not worshipped to the same extent in Israel or
any other country," he added.
