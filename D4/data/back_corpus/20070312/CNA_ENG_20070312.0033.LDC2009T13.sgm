The Ministry of Education (MOE) will set up a Web site
exclusively aimed at introducing a new 12-year compulsory
educational system, Minister of Education Tu Cheng-sheng said
Monday.
</P>
<P>
According to Tu, the site will offer a huge amount of information
concerning the new educational system that will formally be
implemented in 2009.
</P>
<P>
Tu made  the  remarks  while  delivering  a speech  at a plaque-
unveiling ceremony for an office in charge of promoting the
12-year educational system.
</P>
<P>
The direction of development for the new educational system has
been determined, but relevant details have yet to be discussed by
MOE officials and the public, Tu pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Tu said the office was set up in April 2006 but he added that its
manpower has increased since Premier Su Tseng-chang announced in
late February that the system will come into force in 2009 to
extend the period of compulsory education from nine years to 12.
