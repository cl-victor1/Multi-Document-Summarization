KAOHSIUNG HARBOR INDUSTRIES OPPOSE MUSIC CENTER PLAN
</HEADLINE>

Kaohsiung,  March  12  (CNA) 03/12/07  21:03:27 (By Y.C. Jou)

Eleven associations of Kaohsiung Harbor-based industries Monday
rallied against the Kaohsiung City Government's plan to build a
pop music center in the harbor area, saying the project would
hamper industrial development.
</P>
<P>
What the Kaohsiung Harbor needs now is the building of more dock
facilities rather than that of water parks, Yen Ming-chuan,
President of the Kaohsiung City Association of Shipping Agents,
said at a news conference held jointly by the eleven
associations.
</P>
<P>
He said that the harbor has been the country's economic lifeblood
for decades, but is declining in competitiveness compared to
Chinese harbors, which have been undergoing rapid construction
development in recent years.
</P>
<P>
The city government plans to build the NT$4 billion (US$121.3
million) music center at the harbor's Wharf No. 10 but has faced
opposition since the release of the plan earlier this year from
the Kaohsiung Harbor Bureau, under the Ministry of Transportation
and Communications.
</P>
<P>
The city government had said it hoped to make the music center a
new landmark of Kaohsiung, and that the Wharf No. 10 was chosen
because of its proximity to the estuary of the Love River and the
city center, as well as its topography.
</P>
<P>
Yen said the Wharf No. 10 is a bulk cargo wharf, that such wharfs
are already in demand, and that such shortages already keep ships
waiting outside the harbor, thus raising costs.
</P>
<P>
He said the associations would only accept the city government's
proposal if one or more other wharfs are set aside as
substitutes. Otherwise, he said, they may adoptradical measuresin
protest.
</P>
<P>
Kaohsiung Mayor Chen Chu had said a few days before that the city
government would continue to persuade its opponents and might
find an alternative location if the negotiation fails.
