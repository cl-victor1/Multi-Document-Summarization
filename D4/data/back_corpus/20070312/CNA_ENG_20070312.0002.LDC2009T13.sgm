Ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) Chairman Yu Shyi-kun
clarified his stance Sunday on the selection of the party's
candidate for the 2008 presidential election, claiming that he
didn't oppose President Chen Shui-bian's mediation as a solution
to the party's nomination fray.
</P>
<P>
Yu said media reports about his opposition to the president's
mediation as a solution to the selection of the DPP's
presidential candidate were a misunderstanding of his stance.

<P>
Noting that mediation is an integral part of the DPP's primary
system, Yu said he definitely supports the approach of spawning
the party's presidential candidate through negotiations or
mediation.

"What I wants to accentuate is that mediation or negotiation
should start with talks about all the hopefuls' political
notions, convictions and policy lines. We should not determine
who should represent our party in the next presidential race
before each contender clearly expound on their poltiical
convictions and policy lines; otherwise, it would be risky and
dangerous," Yu said, adding that the party's candidate should
expalin their stance on Taiwan's future and national identity.
