Conflict erupted at the Losheng Sanatorium Friday when Taipei
county government officials and police went there to post a
notice formally announcing that the compound, a sanatorium for
leprosy sufferers, will be demolished in a month and encountered
protesters and residents who demanded that the site be preserved.
</P>
<P>
The county government sent 180 police officers to ensure that the
notice would be posted.
</P>
<P>
Slogan-chanting protesters, many of them students, tried to stop
the officials from posting the notice. Police dragged away
several protesters and arrested three who tore up the notice
shortly after it was posted.

The sanatorium was built in 1930 to treat patients with Hansen's
disease and now stands in the way of a Taipei Mass Rapid Transit
depot project. A large part of it has already been destroyed over
the past few years and the government is set to further shave off
nearly 60 percent of the remaining four hectares. But
preservationists argue that there are alternatives and that the
depot and the sanatorium can co-exist.
</P>
<P>
Around 40 patients still live in the sanatorium, while more than
300 have moved to a new hospital nearby or have been rehoused
elsewhere over the past few years.
