Taipei, March 16 (CNA) 03/16/07  20:30:02 (By Lilian Wu)

China might react in a low-key manner toward whatever campaign
strategy the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) might
adopt for the presidential election next year, a senior China
analyst speculated Friday.
</P>
<P>
Willy Lam, a professor at the Chinese University of Hong Kong who
is a long-term observer of Beijing-Washington-Taipei relations,
claimed that this is because China has gradually learned that
heightened cross-strait tensions could work in the DPP's favor in
its bid to win the 2008 presidential race.
</P>
<P>
During a speech at the European Chamber of Commerce Taipei, Lam
also noted that Beijing has studied Taiwan's election tactics and
that it is used to the election ploys employed by the DPP.
</P>
<P>
He admitted that Chinese President Hu Jintao has prepared for all
possible scenarios and that the People's Liberation Army (PLA)
has also conducted military drills, but predicted nonetheless
that Beijing might only respond in a low-key manner to any
"extraordinary" gambits the DPP might adopt.
</P>
<P>
China is in fact worried that the pro-independence DPP might use
the heightened cross-strait relations to galvanize the public
into throwing its support behind the DPP in elections, he said.
</P>
<P>
Thus, Beijing will on one hand keep a low profile and on the
other hand continue its "united front" strategy toward Taiwan, he
went on.
</P>
<P>
He observed that President Chen Shui-bian, who has played the
anti-China card before, will step down May 20, 2008 after his
second term expires. Even if Chen continues to make provocative
rhetoric, China will not make a strong response to give the DPP
an edge in election, he forecast.
</P>
<P>
He also said that since the 911 terrorist attack on the United
States in 2001, Washington feels that China could be a partner of
cooperation on such issues as Iraq and North Korea. For this
reason, he predicted, the United States will cement its relations
with China as much as possible, and the possibility of the United
States seeking further breakthrough in its ties Taiwan is lower.
</P>
<P>
He also said that Hu will enter his second five-year term as
China's leader. With his usually cautious manner, he will not
venture into political reforms, Lam claimed.
</P>
<P>
Seeking his legacy in history, Hu will be active on the
diplomatic fronts, Lam said, noting that China has increased its
presence in Africa and Southeast Asia with a charm offensive.
</P>
<P>
On China's domestic front, Hu will follow the path of past
leaders such as Mao Tsedong and Deng Xiaoping to step up control
over the military police, the army and the media, Lam predicted.
