Police arrested Friday one of two men who raped a medical
institute student earlier this week after abducting her from near
the Chientan mass rapid transit (MRT) station in the Shihlin
district of Taipei City.
</P>
<P>
The task force in charge of the investigation announced at a
press conference that they had arrested  the alleged rapist,
identified as Hung Chie-hung, 30, at his home in Sanchung, Taipei
County earlier in the day.
</P>
<P>
The police said Hung, who has a record of drug offenses, had
worked part-time as waiter at a restaurant at the Shihlin night
market. DNA tests found that he was involved in the rape.
</P>
<P>
According to police report, the victim was walking in the rain
from the Shihlin night market toward a motorbike parking lot
opposite the MRT station's No. 2 exit shortly after midnight
Sunday when a man forced her into a car. Another man then drove
the car to the Tachia Riverside Park beside the Keelung River.
</P>
<P>
Both men raped her in the park and then drove off, leaving behind
the young woman naked and helpless in the dark. She was later
rescued by a couple driving through the park.
</P>
<P>
The police said a tap with a clear fingerprint of Hung that they
discovered at the site where the alleged rapists abducted the
victim, is the key clue that led them to the suspect. After
screening Hung's mobile phone records,  the task force also found
that Hung's accomplice was a 38-year-old man identified as Lin
Shih-chie, who has a criminal history of sexual harassment.
</P>
<P>
Police said they are now hunting for Lin.
</P>
<P>
Taipei Mayor Hau Lung-bin visited the Shihlin police station
after hearing of Hung's arrest. He attributed the success in
cracking the case in such a short time to good police
coordination and cooperation, as well as security monitors on
street corners and in stores around the night markets and MRT
stations, as police obtained images of the suspect from video
footage taken by the monitors.
</P>
<P>
Hau revealed that the city government has decided to work out a
four-year program aimed at installing security monitoring
facilities in every community around the capital as part of the
efforts to eliminate "dead zones" in the city's security
management.
