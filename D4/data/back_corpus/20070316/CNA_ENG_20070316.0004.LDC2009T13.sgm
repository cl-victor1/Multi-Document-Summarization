The international community should pay more heed to China's human
rights violations and take immediate steps to prod China on
improvement of its human rights records, Taiwan's top China
policy planner said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Mainland Affairs Council Chairman Joseph Wu made the appeal while
receiving Dr. Jan Grotheer, president of the Tax High Court of
Hamburg, Germany who arrived in Taipei earlier this week for a
visit.
</P>
<P>
Grotheer told Wu that he visited Taiwan for the first time in
1987 when Taiwan was just ready to lift its decades-old martial
law. Grotheer said he admires Taiwan's tremendous progress in
democratic development over the past two decades.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, Grotheer said China has continued suppressing
freedom of speech, freedom of expression and human rights.
China's suppression of human rights activists and lawyers in the
past few years are extremely regrettable, he added.
</P>
<P>
Wu echoed Grotheer's views, saying that China' human rights
records deteriorated significantly last year as numerous cases of
human rights violations have been reported in China, including
arrests, prosecution and conviction of several prominent human
right lawyers.
</P>
<P>
"The world community should show more concern about human rights
conditions in China and press Beijing leaders to take improvement
measures," Wu added.
