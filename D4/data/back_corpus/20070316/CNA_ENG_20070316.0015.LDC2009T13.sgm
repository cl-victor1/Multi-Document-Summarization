Taipei,  March 16 (CNA) 03/16/07  16:57:32 (By Luis Huang)

The Taiwan Futures Exchange (TAIFEX) has succeeded in its bid to
host the Third Futures Industry Association (FIA) Asia
Derivatives Conference,  which will be the largest international
futures seminar to be held in Taiwan since the establishment of
TAIFEX in 1998, a TAIFEX official said Friday.
</P>
<P>
According to the official, TAIFEX's bid to host the 2007 FIA Asia
Derivatives Conference was approved by the FIA board of directors
March 14 thanks to lobbying efforts by TAIFEX Chairman Wu Rong-i,
who led a delegation March 12 to attend the 32nd Annual
International Futures Industry Conference in Boca Raton, Florida.
</P>
<P>
The Second FIA Asia Derivatives Conference took place in Mumbai,
India in 2006 and since then TAIFEX has been seeking to win the
right to host the 2007 conference,  the official said, adding
that immediately after their arrival in Boca Raton, Wu and his
entourage began to lobby actively for TAIFEX's bid.
</P>
<P>
FIA's approval  of TAIFEX's  bid to host the Third Asian
Derivatives Conference, tentatively set for November, not only
reflects  its recognition  of efforts to promote international
exchanges, but also marks a milestone in the internationalization
of Taiwan's futures market, the official pointed out.
</P>
<P>
With the brisk development of regional derivatives markets over
the past few years, Asia has recorded one of the fastest growth
rates in terms of derivatives trading volume, with its trading
volume accounting for one-third of the global total, according to
the official.
</P>
<P>
Since differences in the structures of Asian national laws and
the operations of derivatives markets were hindering efficient
cooperation among regional futures exchanges, in 2004 FIA began
to organize derivatives seminars in Asia to establish mechanisms
which aimed at boosting the development of regional futures
markets, the official explained.

<P>
While in the United States, Wu also met with New York Mercantile
Exchange (NYMEX) General Manager James Newsome to exchange views
on NYMEX's recent introduction of the GLOBEX trading system from
the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and a planned listing of TAIFEX.
</P>
<P>
In addition to expressing his support for TAIFEX's planned
listing, Newsome also accepted Wu's invitation to visit Taiwan in
the near future to share his professional experience with local
futures dealers.
