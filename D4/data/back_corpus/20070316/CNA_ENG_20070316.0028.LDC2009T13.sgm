The Kaohsiung city government has launched an "adoption service"
to encourage colleges and communities to get behind the various
sports and participating countries of the 2009 World Games as a
means of drumming up local identification with and support of the
Games, a local official said Friday.

Chen Yi-heng, Chief Executive Officer of Kaohsiung Organizing
Committee (KOC) , said such adoptions will help citizens better
understand  the World Games, which will bring together 3,200
competitors from more than 100 participating countries to compete
in 26 official and 12 invitational events from July 16-26, 2009.

Colleges and communities that adopt events or participating
countries will be responsible for cheering on adopted countries
and hosting athletes during the 11-day event.

In preparation for the Games, the Kaohsiung city government has
received NT$5 billion (US$1.51 billion) from the central
government to build 22 sport venues and renovate other public
facilities.
