Taipei, March 16 (CNA) 03/16/07  18:46:47 (By Luis Huang)

Taiwan's foreign aid projects are not only transparent, but are
carried out under strict supervision by the legislature, Ministry
of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) spokesman Wang Chien-yeh said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Wang made the remarks after U.S. Deputy Assistant Secretary for
East Asian and Pacific Affairs Glyn Davies, in a report to
Congress, highlighted the "lack of transparency" in financial aid
packages offered by the two sides of the Taiwan Strait to Pacific
island countries.
</P>
<P>
Davies stated that the U.S. government is very concerned that the
cross-Taiwan Strait competition for winning diplomatic
recognition from Pacific island states has hindered
democratization processes. He added that the problem of financial
aid from Taiwan and China to those nations lies in their "non-
transparency."
</P>
<P>
In response, Wang said Taiwan's technical and economic assistance
</P>
<P>
to its diplomatic allies in South Pacific is conducted, for the
most part, to satisfy specific local needs, and the nation will
also take into consideration its own limitations before offering
such aid.
</P>
<P>
As a democratic country, the nation's budget for all foreign aid
projects  is subject to legislative  approval,  ensuring  that
non-transparency will not be an issue, Wang stressed
</P>
<P>
In addition to sharing its economic development experience with
its diplomatic allies, Taiwan's democratic achievement serves as
a good model for South Pacific island countries looking to step
up their own democratization efforts, Wang explained, adding that
Taiwan will not be an hindrance to democratization processes in
those countries.
