DOH TO REQUIRE LABELING OF TRANS FATS ON FOOD PACKAGING

The Department of Health (DOH) will give advance notice, by
mid-2007, of a new requirement that foodstuff producers and
processors state the quantity of trans fatty acids on packages of
foods containing the health-threatening substance, DOH officials
said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Trans fatty acids, commonly termed 'trans fats', are created
during an industrial process to transform natural, liquid plant
oils into solids. This process is called partial hydrogenation.
</P>
<P>
Both foreign and domestic research documents show that trans fats
are neither required nor beneficial for health and indicate that
consuming trans fat increases the risk of cardiovascular diseases
due to its effect on cholesterol levels.
</P>
<P>
For these reasons, the New York city government has decided to
ban all restaurants and food stands from using trans fats
beginning July, 2008.
</P>
<P>
Cheng Huei-wen, chief of the DOH Bureau of Food Sanitation, said
the bureau recently sent letters to 11 chain restaurants,
including McDonald's and Kentucky Fried Chicken, to inquire about
the use of partially hydrogenated oils as part of the bureau's
efforts to assess the possibility of reducing their usage.
</P>
<P>
The DOH has also encouraged businesses to label the amount of
trans fats on the package of their products, Cheng said, noting
that in the future the department will refer to U.S. regulations
and local businesses' opinions on foodstuff labels and make such
labels mandatory.
