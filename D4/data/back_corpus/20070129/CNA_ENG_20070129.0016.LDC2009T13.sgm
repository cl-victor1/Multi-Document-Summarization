Mass production of flu vaccine against the virulent H5N1 avian
flu strain is expected to begin at the end of this year, the
National Health Research Institute (NHRI) reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The institute launched a bird flu research program in August 2005
and collected H5N1 cultures from patients in Vietnam for the
development of flu vaccine after the new resistant strain of the
highly pathogenic H5N1 virus deadly to humans and poultry was
found to have spread through Asia since 1997.

<P>
By the end of 2006, NHRI officials said, researchers at the
institute's labs had completed the preparation of H5N1 vaccine
and found in experiments on small animals that the NHRI-developed
H5N1 vaccine can effectively induce protective antibodies.
</P>
<P>
According to the bird flu and vaccine research program, the top
goal for 2007 is filing for approval for clinical tests on humans
in the last quarter of the year and launching clinical tests on
humans in 2008, the NHRI authorities said.

<P>
Avian flu was first known to have jumped from chickens to humans
in 1997. The disease has killed millions of birds in China and
Southeast Asia since 2003 and has registered a 70 percent
mortality rate among the first 70 people known to have been
infected. There is widespread concern in the international
community that the next outbreak of a lethal global flu pandemic
might kill millions of people. So far, more than 40 countries
around the world have been affected by bird flu.
</P>
<P>
While the NHRI is striving to develop enough flu vaccine against
the virulent H5N1 avian flu strain, the Center for Disease
Control under the Department of Health has secured enough flu
vaccine -- the level suggested by the World Health Organization
(WHO) at 10 percent of the population -- from abroad to allow
Taiwan to be ready for an avian flu pandemic.
