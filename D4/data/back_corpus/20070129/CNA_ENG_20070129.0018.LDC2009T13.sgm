PREMIER CONDEMNS KMT OVER DELAY OF 2007 BUDGET BILL'S PASSAGE

Taipei,   Jan.  29  (CNA) 01/29/07  15:33:29 (By Y.F. Low)

<P>
Premier Su Tseng-chang accused the opposition Kuomintang (KMT) of
ignoring the people's livelihood and the country's economic
development Monday over the stalling of the government's 2007
budget bill.
</P>
<P>
Directing the blame at KMT Chairman Ma Ying-jeou, Su urged the
people to pay attention to this problem and condemn Ma for
allowing such a matter to occur under his leadership.
</P>
<P>
Su made the remarks in response to the Legislative Yuan's
decision not to hold an extra legislative session, after
legislators failed to agree on its agenda.
</P>
<P>
While the ruling Democratic Progressive Party wanted to make the
2007 budget bill the first item on the agenda, the KMT insisted
that a controversial draft law on the organization of the Central
Election Commission (CEC) should be dealt with before the budget
bill.
</P>
<P>
The budget bill, which was supposed to be passed in the last
legislative session which ended Jan. 19, was stonewalled as a
result of partisan bickering over the CEC bill.
</P>
<P>
Noting that it is stipulated in the Budget Law that the central
government's budget proposal should be passed one month before
the next fiscal year starts, namely by the end of November, Su
said it will be five months late now that the legislature will
only deal with the budget bill in March.
</P>
<P>
According to Su, as the budget bill has not been passed, the
government has no way of making the necessary investment in the
country's development projects, which he said will hamper
economic development and increase the unemployment rate.
</P>
<P>
While the government's budget bill was always placed at the top
of the legislature's agenda in the past, this was the first time
that the bill was not passed during the designated session, Su
said.
