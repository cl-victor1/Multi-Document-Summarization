Taipei,  Jan.  29 (CNA) 01/29/07  18:28:28 (By Elizabeth Hsu)

<P>
Taiwan should take the interests of the United States into
account while forming efficient strategies to seek international
support for the existence of the country, an academic at Soochow
University said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Luo Chih-cheng, chief of the Taipei-based university's department
of politics, said democracy is not the only bargaining chip
Taiwan has in efforts to seek support from the world's democratic
powers in the fight against China's suppression in the
international community.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan must think of how to work out more aggressive strategies
that "meet with the U.S.'s national interests in the fields of
security, economy and diplomacy, " Luo advised during a
conference organized by the ruling Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP).
</P>
<P>
Political scholars and experts were invited to attend the
conference  to discuss the reality and prospects  of Taiwan's
democracy.
</P>
<P>
Luo also said the DPP administration's vacillation on the issue
of constitutional reform has often surprised the U.S. government,
resulting in what he described as "communication problems"
between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
Because of this, Taiwan should make more effort to establish a
durable and clear channel for communication between the two
sides, Luo said.
</P>
<P>
"It is important to make the international community understand
that democracy in Taiwan plays a key role in maintaining the
country's status quo," he added.
</P>
<P>
Participants in the conference also included Association of East
Asian Relations Chairman Lo Fu-chuan, Academia Sinica researcher
Lin Cheng-yi, as well as Hao Pei-chi, an assistant professor in
public administration of National Taipei University.
