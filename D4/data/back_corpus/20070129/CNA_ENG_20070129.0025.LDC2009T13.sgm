</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  Jan. 29 (CNA) 01/29/07  17:26:44 (By Lilian Wu)

<P>
The Department of Health (DOH) said Monday that it will compile
the views of experts before convening a meeting to decide on
whether to lift a ban on imports of Canadian beef.
</P>
<P>
The subject of whether to lift ban became a focus after President
Chen Shui-bian spoke to a group of Canadian parliamentarians Jan.
15 and told them that DOH Minister Hou Sheng-mou would soon
travel to Canada to assess whether to resume the imports.
</P>
<P>
Hou led a five-member group comprised of experts in meat
quarantine, veterinary and neural internal medicine on a visit to
Canada Jan. 21 for an eight-day on- site inspection. The group
returned to Taiwan Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Cheng Huei-wen, director-general of the DOH Bureau of Food
Safety, said the group inspected Canada's cattle registration
system, slaughterhouses and meat packing factories.
</P>
<P>
Cheng said the DOH is compiling the views of the group into an
initial written report.
</P>
<P>
The DOH will also convene a consultative meeting soon to discuss
whether to lift the ban and give recommendations.
</P>
<P>
But Cheng also said the final decision lies with inter-agency
communication as well as the Cabinet, adding that the decision
could come after the Chinese New Year, which falls on Feb. 18, at
the earliest.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan used to be the fifth-largest market for Canadian beef. It
imposed the ban in the wake of a case of mad cow disease in
Canada in May 2003.
