The annual event is an unofficial, non-political and private

representatives from all walks of life from more than 150
countries to attend.

prayer breakfast.

Members of the Taiwan delegation will include Wu Li-pei, a former
senior adviser to President Chen Shui-bian, several ruling
Democratic Progressive Party lawmakers, including Hsieh Hsin-ni
and Hsu Kuo-yung, as well as Chen Chien- chung, a commissioner of
the Coordination Council for North American Affairs.
