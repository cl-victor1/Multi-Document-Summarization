San  Francisco,   Jan.  28  (CNA) 01/29/07  13:39:23 (By Jih-chun

<P>
U.S.-China-Taiwan relations, regardless of the state of
Washington-Taipei, Washington-Beijing or cross-Taiwan Strait
ties, are currently stable, American Institute in Taiwan Chairman
Raymond Burghardt said here Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Communications between Taipei and Washington have been close and
smooth, Burghardt said at a news conference held prior to a
lecture dinner hosted by a Bay Area Taiwanese chamber of
commerce.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan has economic strength and is an important trading partner
of the United States, Burghardt said. Besides bilateral business
cooperation, Taiwan's achievement in democratization is even more
worthy of respect, he said, adding that Taiwan's strenuous
efforts to accelerate democratization have strengthened the U.S.
commitment to supporting Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Burghardt, who accompanied President Chen Shui-bian on a flight
from San Francisco to Nicaragua in early January, said the U.S.
government does its best to accommodate Taiwan leaders' requests
for transit stops in the United States if their requests are
reasonable.
</P>
<P>
He said Chen's most recent U.S. transit stops during his visit to
Nicaragua at the start of the year were very smooth, adding that
Chen met with several U.S. scholars and former U.S. officials,
including former U.S. Secretary of Defense William Perry, during
his stopovers.
</P>
<P>
During the talks at Chen's presidential suite during his 16-hour
transit stop in San Francisco, Perry told Chen that the U.S.
government had done the right thing when it dispatched two
aircraft carrier groups to the Taiwan Strait in response to
China's missile tests in the area in March 1996 ahead of Taiwan's
presidential election because the election was important to both
the U.S. and Taiwan governments.
</P>
<P>
Burghardt reiterated the United States' stance that it expects
President Chen to stick faithfully to his "five noes" pledge made
in his inauguration speech in May 2000 that as long as Beijing
has no intention to use military force against Taiwan, he will
not declare independence, not change Taiwan's name, not add the
state-to-state theory into the Constitution, not promote a
referendum to change the status quo on independence or
unification, and not scrap the National Unification Guidelines
during his term of office.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, on Chen's plans to enable Taiwan to enter the United
Nations under the title of "Taiwan," Burghardt said he does not
think it is a realistic idea, not at least in the current
international political situation. He said this kind of issue,
due to sovereignty disputes between Taipei and Beijing, is not an
issue for the United States to tackle.
</P>
<P>
Burghardt also reiterated Washington's "one China" policy and
added that the United States will not play the role of
"intermediary" between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait.
</P>
<P>
He also declined to comment on Taiwan's next presidential
election in 2008, saying it is Taiwan's own business and it is
still too early to tell which party will field who in the race.
</P>
<P>
Burghardt is expected to pay a visit to Taiwan after the Lunar
New Year in a bid to push for passage of the long-stalled arms
procurement bill.
