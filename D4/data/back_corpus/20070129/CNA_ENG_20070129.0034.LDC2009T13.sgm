The National Palace Museum's southern branch in Chiayi County is
scheduled to open in 2011, Premier Su Tseng-chang said over the
weekend.

Su made the remarks Sunday after conducting an inspection tour of
the construction project, accompanied by National Palace Museum
director Lin Mun- lee, Council of Agriculture (COA) Chairman Su
Jia-chyuan, Minister Without Portfolio Ho Mei-yueh, and Chiayi
County Magistrate Chen Ming-wen.

Su said that the project is underway  and that the main
construction will begin early next year at the earliest, urging
locals not to worry.

In addition, Su promised to earmark a budget of NT$680 million
(around US$21 million)  for the construction  of the museum's
surrounding roads.

Stressing during a briefing that the project is being carried out
as planned and that the central government has continued to step
up its efforts, Lin said the branch will be a world-class museum,
featuring Asian culture and arts.

"The opening of the branch in 2011 will lead the county into a
new era," Lin said.

Meanwhile, the magistrate said that when the branch opens, it
will help form a special cultural area.

The county government plans to attract Taiwan Broadcasting System
(TBS) to set up a base in the county by providing a piece of
land, Chen noted, adding that a national archives center and a
national library may also be built near the base.
