The stalemate over the government's 2007 budget bill will require
extra efforts within the central government to ensure employees
of local governments get their year-end bonus, a Ministry of
Finance official said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Blockage of general budget bill in the legislature could freeze
the  central government's  appropriation  of grants  to local
governments, while year-end bonuses included in salaries or as a
part of recurrent expenditures should not, in theory, be
affected, said Liu Teng-cheng, Administrative Vice Minister of
Finance.
</P>
<P>
However,  he said,  the  situation  may create  additional
difficulties for local governments, as these governments commonly
face shortages in ready money.
</P>
<P>
Cabinet spokesman Cheng Wen-tsang said Monday that as Lunar New
Year is drawing near,  funding requests by money-hungry local
governments have totaled NT$68 billion.
</P>
<P>
Liu said the Finance Ministry will work hard in joint efforts
with the Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics
to meet the need of local governments.
</P>
<P>
The central government budget bill failed to pass the legislature
in the last session that ended Jan. 19 due to partisan disputes
over a draft law on the organization of the Central Election
Commission. Legislators decided Monday not to hold an extra
legislative session after they failed to agree on its agenda,
leaving the budget bill for the next regular session beginning in
March.
