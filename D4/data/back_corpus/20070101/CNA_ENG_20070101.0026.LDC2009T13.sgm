CEPD TO KICK OFF MAJOR DOMESTIC INVESTMENT PLANS: CHAIRMAN
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  Jan.  1 (CNA) 01/01/07  19:30:46 (By Flor Wang)

In response to President Chen Shui-bian's four economic goals set
in his New Year's Day speech for 2007, the Council for Economic
Planning and Development (CEPD) is set to launch major investment
plans around Taiwan, CEPD Chairman Hu Sheng-cheng said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Hu's remarks came after Chen said in his New Year's address
earlier the same day that the administration should do its utmost
to create jobs, reduce the wealth gap, narrow regional
differences and bolster investment in the domestic market with
concrete measures during the coming year.
</P>
<P>
According  to Hu,  the CEPD will soon start a series of
preparations  with local governments  before kicking off prime
investment plans around the country under the Cabinet's banner of
"mega-warmth" and "mega investment" projects initiated by Premier
Su Tseng-chang late last year.
</P>
<P>
The CEPD has set an annual economic growth rate of 4.6 percent
for Taiwan in 2007, higher than the 4.14 percent target set by
the Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics, Hu
said, adding that the CEPD made the estimate basing its optimism
on the "mega-warmth" and "mega investment" projects.
</P>
<P>
With the easing of a credit card crunch that hard hit Taiwan last
year and forecast booming exports in the coming year, Taiwan
should be able to manage a brisker economic growth rate this year
than 2006, Hu said.
</P>
<P>
He also expressed his belief that the wealth gap between rich and
poor will be reduced to six-fold for 2007 from last year's
6.04-fold, boosted by dropping unemployment and increasing
investment at home.
