TAIWAN MORE THAN WILLING TO ASSIST IN HK DEMOCRATIZATION: MAC
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  Dec.  31 (CNA) 01/01/07  11:19:20 (By Sofia Wu)

Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) Chairman Joseph Wu said Sunday
Taiwan has rich experience in democratic development and is more
than willing to support and assist in Hong Kong's
democratization.
</P>
<P>
Wu made the remarks in a video conference with a group of pro-
democracy activists in Hong Kong organized by the Taipei-based
Friends of Hong Kong and Macau Association and the Hong Kong-
based Network of Democracy.
</P>
<P>
While he was pleased to learn that 83 percent of candidates
fielded by pro- democracy groups in Hong Kong succeeded in the
recent vote for the territory's Election Committee -- an
electoral college that will elect the next Hong Kong chief
executive, Wu said he still felt regret that Hong Kong citizens
cannot directly elect their chief executive.
</P>
<P>
Noting that both Taiwan's and Hong Kong's democratic developments
face the challenge of China, Wu said Taiwan has come a long way
in its pursuit of liberal democracy despite China's persistent
threat. "We are willing to offer our experience in the regard for
your reference, " Wu said, adding that Taiwan will also never
hesitate to lend support and assistance to Hong Kong in this
respect.
</P>
<P>
Wu further said Taiwan's political disturbances in recent years
have mainly arisen from flaws and deficiencies in its political
system.
</P>
<P>
"Our current system tends to encourage confrontation. In the
future, we should forge a system that is more conducive to
dialogue, consultation, reconciliation and compromise to
facilitate a further deepening of our democratic system," Wu
said.
</P>
<P>
Touching on the recent Taipei and Kaohsiung mayoral elections, Wu
said even though the competition was heated and sometimes became
emotionally charged, the whole proceedings were peaceful. Even
though the loser in the Kaohsiung mayoral race disputed the
electoral results after the electoral results were officially
announced, he sought judicial remedies through due process of the
law.
</P>
<P>
"The practice of seeking a solution to political disputes within
the legal framework exactly embodies the democratic spirit and
indicates a further consolidation of our young democracy, " Wu
explained.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on the same occasion, Government Information Office
Minister Cheng Wen- tsang said Taiwan's democracy was achieved
through peaceful election without any bloody incidents. "Our
democracy is built on a solid foundation. Our political arenas
may sometimes get a bit chaotic, our people have never flinched
in their support and confidence in democracy.  We have feel that
our democracy is backpedaling," he added.
