The number of tourists to the Alishan Forest Park year almost hit
1 million last year, officials from the Forestry Bureau's Chiayi
office reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The officials said that as of midnight Sunday, the number of
tourists visiting the park reached more than 994,000, a record
since the park first opened in 1982.
</P>
<P>
They said that in the year following the opening of the park,
950,000 people visited the park. The number had been maintained
at between 500,000 and 600,000 every year since then.
</P>
<P>
After a devastating earthquake that hit Taiwan Sept. 21, 1999,
the number of visits plunged significantly to 360,000.
</P>
<P>
The number of tourists then increased gradually, the officials
said, increasing from 699,000 in 2003 to 724,000 in 2005.
</P>
<P>
The officials said they will continue to work hard, hoping that
the number will hit 1 million this year and adding that they will
prepare gifts for the 1 millionth visitor.
