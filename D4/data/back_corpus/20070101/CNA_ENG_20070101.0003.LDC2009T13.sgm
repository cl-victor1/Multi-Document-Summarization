Phasing out death penalty is a policy goal of the Ministry of
Justice (MOJ) and the ministry has consistently exercised utter
prudence in executing death row inmates, Vice Minister of Justice
Lee Chin-yung said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
In 2006, Lee said, no death row convict has been executed. "This
is the results of our cautious action rather than the results of
our deliberate act to create a zero execution record," he added.
</P>
<P>
In the future, Lee said, the ministry will step up public
education and launch a new drive to raise public awareness of the
global trend of abolishing capital punishment. Local people
remain far divided over the issue.
