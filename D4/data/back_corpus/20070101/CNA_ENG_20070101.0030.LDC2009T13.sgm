POLICE WILL ACT FURTIVELY TO CATCH BAD DRIVERS: INTERIOR MINISTER
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taipei, Jan.  1 (CNA) 01/01/07  20:26:09 (By Han Nai-kuo)

Police will no longer adopt a high profile when enforcing traffic
regulations in 2007, but will act furtively to weed out dangerous
and reckless drivers in an attempt to reduce fatalities on
Taiwan's public roads, Minister of the Interior Lee Yi-yang said
Monday.
</P>
<P>
At a ceremony to examine traffic police equipment, Lee defended
the change in tactic, saying there is nothing unlawful about the
decision because no traffic regulations in Taiwan or anywhere
else in the world stipulate that teams of traffic police cannot
lurk furtively anywhere along a road to catch bad drivers.
</P>
<P>
Citing statistics, Lee said that Taiwan recorded a death toll of
4,322 on public roads in 2002.
</P>
<P>
However, after the National Police Agency bowed to public
pressure  in July 2003 to require  police to enforce traffic
regulations in an open and conspicuous manner, the death toll
soared to 4,735 in 2005 and broke the 5,000 mark in 2006.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan's road fatalities in 2006 were tantamount to a rate of
21.8 deaths per 100,000 people, or three times as high as Japan's
seven deaths per 100,000 people, he added.
</P>
<P>
Lee urged car drivers and motorcyclists to observe traffic rules
at all times, instead of being law-abiding citizens only when
they know they are being watched by traffic police.
</P>
<P>
According to the EPA, its plan to crack down on irresponsible
drivers will deal harshly with serious traffic violations,
including drunken driving, running red lights, exceeding the
legal speed limit by 40 km, driving on the shoulder of the road,
large vehicles not using the right lane for slower traffic, and
weaving and swerving through traffic.
</P>
<P>
The plan will allow the use of hidden cameras at strategic
locations to photograph violations and let unmarked police
vehicles mix into traffic to find those bad drivers.
