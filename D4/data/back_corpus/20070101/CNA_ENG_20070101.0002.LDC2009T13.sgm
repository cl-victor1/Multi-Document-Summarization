The Council of Agriculture (COA) has decided to cut the country's
whale shark, Rhincodon typus, fishing quota for 2007 to 30 from
this year's 60 to underscore its commitment to fishery resources
conservation, an official said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the international community has attached great
importance to the conservation of whale shark -- the largest
shark and largest fish in the world, the official said the COA
Fisheries Administration's shark resources management panel has
come to the decision to halve next year's whale shark fishing
quota in support of the global campaign to protect this precious
fish species.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the official said, the panel restricts the catch to
those bigger than 4 meters and bans the use of darts in catching
whale shark.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Fisheries Administration will offer a cash reward
ranging between NT$250,000 and NT$1.74 million for each live
whale shark presented by their catcher if the fisherman offers
his catch for release into the sea for scientific study purposes.
</P>
<P>
If fishermen accidentally catch a whale shark smaller than 4
meters and release it into the sea after reporting to the COA,
the Fisheries Administration will offer NT$30,000 in reward.
</P>
<P>
A whale shark is up to 12 meters long and weighs up to 15 tons.
