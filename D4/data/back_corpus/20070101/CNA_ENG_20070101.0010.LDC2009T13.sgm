PRESIDENT'S REMARKS DISPEL CONFUSION ABOUT CHINA INVESTMENT: MAC

Taipei,  Jan.  1 (CNA) 01/01/07  16:07:11 (By Flor Wang)

President Chen Shui-bian's New Year's Day remarks  on  Taiwan-
China  ties  were helpful  in  dispelling misconceptions about a
much-talked-about modified policy allegedly being adopted by
Premier Su Tseng-chang, Mainland Affair Council (MAC) Chairman
Joseph Wu said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Wu made the remarks after Chen said in his New Year's Day address
that he feels there is nothing wrong with Taiwan's existing trade
and economic policy toward China and claimed that there is no so-
called "Su's modified approach" in Taiwan's dealings with China.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan's present trade and economic policy focuses on "Taiwan
first" and "Taiwan identity," Chen said.
</P>
<P>
According to Wu, the so-called "Su's modified approach" was
dreamed up by media outlets with an aim of distinguishing between
Chen's and Su's positions in terms of Taiwan's links with China.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan's existing China policy is a result of the government's
overall assessment of the cross-Taiwan Strait situation, Wu said,
adding that no individual or agency in the government can deviate
from that position and forge a different cross-strait policy.
</P>
<P>
The media concept of a "Su's modified approach" has no basis in
fact, Wu concluded.
</P>
<P>
Citing the government's recent decision to allow Taiwan-based
0.18-micron chip makers to open manufacturing plants in China as
an example, Wu also called it a result of a government policy
evaluation that shows that such investments are beneficial to
Taiwan, will not damage Taiwan's interests,  and are in line with
the "active management, effective opening" China investment
policy heralded by Chen in his last year's New Year's Day speech.
</P>
<P>
The MAC will report to the president, the Executive Yuan, and the
chairman, secretary-general and legislative caucus whips of the
ruling Democratic Progressive Party every time it makes a policy
adjustment after thorough study and discussion, Wu said.
