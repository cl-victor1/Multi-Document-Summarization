Taipei, Jan. 1 (CNA) 01/01/07  16:18:21 (By Deborah Kuo)

<P>
President Chen Shui-bian said Monday that it is still uncertain
whether he will attend the inauguration of Nicaraguan President
Daniel Ortega Jan. 10, although the Ministry of Foreign Affairs
has been making plans in that direction.
</P>
<P>
The foreign ministry is currently making arrangements and a final
decision will not be announced until all arrangements have been
settled, including consent by countries in which transit stops
will have to be made during the Taiwan- Nicaragua round trip,
Chen said.
</P>
<P>
Chen made the remarks while talking with reporters during a ride
aboard the "bullet train" from Panchiao in Taipei County to Wujih
in central Taiwan, where he awarded a plaque for the Taiwan High
Speed Railway's inaugural train.
</P>
<P>
Chen expressed confidence in Taiwan's first "bullet train, "
describing it as on a par with Japan's Shinkansen trains and
France's TJV bullet trains.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the president commended what he described as "the
spirit of the son of Taiwan, " saying that it reflects the spirit
of the 23 million people of Taiwan, who have followed a "bottom-
up, rags to riches" track to create the greatest possible
achievements with the least resources and most impossible
conditions.
</P>
<P>
He said he has experienced the most challenging moments of his
political career last year, with his son-in-law being given a
six-year jail term for insider trading and his wife indicted on
charges of corruption and forgery.
</P>
<P>
He said he appreciates society for its concern and advice given
to him and his family. "It provides us a golden opportunity to
reflect and conduct soul- searching," he said.
</P>
<P>
The president also offered his appreciation to doctors at
National Taiwan University Hospital for their tireless efforts in
taking care of his wheelchair- bound wife, who has reputedly been
in poor health for several months.
