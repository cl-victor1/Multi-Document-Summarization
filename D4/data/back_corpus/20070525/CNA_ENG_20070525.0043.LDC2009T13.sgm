Taipei, May 25 (CNA) 05/25/07  22:34:16 (By Han Nai-kuo)

Two lawmakers of the opposition Kuomintang (KMT) mustered
NT$300,000 (US$9,000) to help the winning team in Taiwan's Little
League Baseball Series compete in an Asia-Pacific regional
tournament in Hong Kong July 8-14.
</P>
<P>
At a ceremony in the Legislative Yuan, Legislator Chen Chao-jung
and his colleague, KMT legislative caucus whip Hsu Shao-ping,
presented the cash gift to Fang Cheng-wei, principal of the
Taiyuan Elementary School in Taitung County, whose baseball team
defeated eight teams to emerge champion.
</P>
<P>
Chen noted that the school has been struggling to make ends meet
and has been seeking donations to pay the NT$1.2 million needed
each year to cover the team's expenses.
</P>
<P>
He said the school needs urgent financial support to allow its
30-member baseball team to compete in Hong Kong in July.
</P>
<P>
Chen urged the government to re-examine its sports policy and ask
itself why a school sending a sports team to an international
competition is left on its own to meet its financial demands.
</P>
<P>
Hsu invited the public to extend a helping hand to the team to
help it win honor for Taiwan in the Asia-Pacific tournament and
advance to the Little League Baseball World Series at
Williamsport, Pennsylvania, in August.
</P>
<P>
In addition to Taiwan and Hong Kong, countries involved in the
Asia-Pacific regional tournament will include China, Guam,
Indonesia, South Korea, New Zealand and the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
From 2007, Japan, which has nearly 300 chartered Little League
programs, will be designated as a separate region and its
champion will advance directly to Williamsport.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan, known in the competition as Chinese Taipei, rejoined the
Little  League Baseball  in 2003 after absenting  itself from
competition for five years.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan dominated the world of Little League Baseball for the
better part of three decades. From 1969 to 1997, Taiwan sent 21
teams to the Little League World Series. Of the 21 teams, 17
returned as World Series champions, including a string of four
straight title holders from 1971-74 and a run of five consecutive
championship teams from 1977-81.
</P>
<P>
After not sending a team to South Williamsport in 1997, Taiwan
voluntarily withdrew from the Little League because it refused to
accept Little League Baseball zoning rules.
