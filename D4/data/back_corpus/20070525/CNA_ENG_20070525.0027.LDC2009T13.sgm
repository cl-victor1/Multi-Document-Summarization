KMT DENIES SCRAPPING 'UNIFICATION' AS PARTY OBJECTIVE
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  May 25 (CNA) 05/25/07  18:13:07 (By Y.F.  Low)
</P>
<P>
An opposition Kuomintang (KMT) official denied Friday that the
party's efforts to revise its charter will result in the
renunciation of unification with China as an objective of the
party.
</P>
<P>
KMT spokesman Yang Tu said the planned amendment to the KMT
charter is designed to ensure that the party is keeping pace with
the mainstream values in the country and will not involve any
changes to the general principles of the charter.
</P>
<P>
For example, Yang noted, there will not be any alteration to the
foreword of the charter, which states the KMT adheres to the
concept of constitutional democracy and to the pursuit of a
"prosperous, strong and unified nation."
</P>
<P>
"The basic spirit of the charter will remain unchanged. It is
totally mistaken to say that the KMT is scrapping its objective
of pursuing unification, " Yang said, adding that the KMT is
opposed to Taiwan independence.
</P>
<P>
At issue is the KMT's plan to amend an article on party
membership in the party charter, which, according to a local
media report, will scrap "national unification" as a party
objective.
</P>
<P>
While the present article stipulates that residents of China who
are willing to strive with the KMT for "the goal of national
unification" are considered "members of the party in spirit, "
the KMT is planning to change the article so that other non-ROC
citizens will be considered KMT members "in spirit" as long as
they are willing to work with the KMT for "the peace and
development of the country," the China Times said.
</P>
<P>
The draft of the amendment, which was finalized by the KMT early
this week, is expected to be approved by the party's national
congress slated for June 24.
</P>
<P>
In what would mark the first time that the word "Taiwan" has been
written into the charter of the China-originating KMT, supposedly
to facilitate the KMT's "transformation into a Taiwanized party,
" the draft  amendment  states  that the KMT will  "stick  to the
`Taiwan-centric, pro-people' philosophy to fight for the general
interests of ethnic Chinese," according to the report.
</P>
<P>
Expressing opposition to the planned amendment Friday, KMT
Legislator Hung Chiu- chu called the move an unnecessary one that
will create an issue that is unfavorable to the KMT.
</P>
<P>
Hung claimed  that if the KMT is to remove  mention  of
"unification" from its charter,  the party will have problems
differentiating itself from the ruling Democratic Progressive
Party (DPP) and thus have difficulty persuading the people to
vote for the KMT in the upcoming legislative and presidential
elections.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Ker Chien-ming, convener of the DPP legislative
caucus, pointed out that simply changing the wording of its party
charter will not help the KMT succeed in making the people
believe it is "transforming itself into a Taiwanized party."
