TAIWAN'S EXPORTS TO BE AFFECTED BY U.S.-KOREA FTA: TRADE OFFICIAL

Taipei,  May 24 (CNA) 05/25/07  10:49:06 (Deborah Kuo)

<P>
Taiwan will be affected by the signing of a free trade agreement
(FTA) between the United States and South Korea, the head of the
Bureau of Foreign Trade (BOFT) said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Huang Chih-peng said that U.S. and Korean negotiators completed
their negotiations over a U.S.-South Korea FTA in April and that
the agreement is expected to be signed in June, paving the way
for its implementation in 2009 at the earliest.
</P>
<P>
Huang estimated that Taiwan's exports to the United States might
decline by 1 percent or roughly US$300 million each year based on
a 2006 level of US$38.2 billion, as a result of lower import
tariffs that the United States and South Korea offer to each
other after the FTA takes effect.
</P>
<P>
According to results of an analysis conducted by the Chung-Hua
Institute for Economic Research via the GTAP global trade model,
Taiwan's exports to South Korea are expected to decline by 3.14
percent annually, based on a 2006 level of US$7.1 billion, upon
the implementation of the FTA, Huang said.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan's overall export trade is expected to fall by 0.05 percent
each year once the FTA goes into force, according to the
analysis.
</P>
<P>
Huang, nevertheless, said that although the FTA will put Taiwan
at a disadvantage, as South Korea is a major rival of Taiwan in
terms of export trade, Taiwan need not be too concerned. "Taiwan
will fare well even without an FTA with the United States," Huang
claimed.
</P>
<P>
He said Taiwan will continue to engage in bilateral  and
multilateral World Trade Organization talks for trade
globalization, take part in activities related to the Asia-
Pacific  Economic Cooperation forum to promote regional
integration, and pay attention to the prospects of the
feasibility of a Free Trade Area in Asian-Pacific (FTAAP) in the
months to come.
