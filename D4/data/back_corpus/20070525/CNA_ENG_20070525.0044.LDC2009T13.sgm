The first group of locally trained Taiwanese high speed train
drivers will soon join the high speed rail service, a senior
transportation official said Friday.

Hu Hsiang-lin, deputy head of the Bureau of High Speed Rail under
the Ministry of Transportation and Communications, disclosed that
10 Taiwanese train drivers have completed their training and
passed their examinations.

He said the drivers are expected to get their licenses next week
and to join the high speed rail service from June 1.

He pointed out that at present, the Taiwan High Speed Rail Corp.
(THSRC) employs 51 foreign drivers to operate the trains that ply
the 345-km high speed rail link between Taipei and Kaohsiung --
the two largest cities in the north and south of Taiwan,
respectively.

According to Hu, the THSRC hopes to train enough Taiwanese train
drivers to take over all high speed train operations by the end
of 2008.
