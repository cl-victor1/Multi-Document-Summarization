YUNLIN ACTS TO SAVE REPUTATION AS 'ORIGINAL HOME OF TAIWAN
COFFEE'

Taipei, May 25 (CNA) 05/25/07  18:03:15 (By Elizabeth Hsu)

Officials and councilors of Yunlin County in southern Taiwan
gathered together at the county council square Friday in an
attempt to assist the rural township of Kukeng in saving its fame
and restoring its credibility as the "original home of Taiwan
coffee."
</P>
<P>
County Magistrate Su Chih-fen and Council Speaker Su Chin-huang
jointly endorsed the genuineness of "Kukeng Coffee" products from
the county-run Kukeng Farmers' Association (KFA) after a former
KFA executive was recently found to have been involved in a
scandal that revealed that so-called Kukeng instant coffee powder
produced by the KFA was made not exclusively with coffee beans
grown in the township Kukeng.
</P>
<P>
The KFA chief executive, Yuan Chih-hsien, made a public apology
Thursday for an unclear ingredient marking on the package of the
association's coffee products after inspectors of the Yunlin
District Prosecutors Office launched a search of the KFA's office
Wednesday. After the search, the KFA was accused of using
imported materials to make products advertised as being made with
local ingredients.
</P>
<P>
During the search, many bank account documents were seized, while
Yuan's predecessor, Yuan Ching-hsiung, as well as the owner of
two coffee importing companies, were taken in for questioning.
Yuan Ching-hsiung was later released on bail of NT$750,000
(US$22,550).
</P>
<P>
According to the preliminary inquiry, the KFA has been purchasing
imported coffee beans and powder from the two suppliers since
2003 at twice the wholesale price. The prosecution has also found
that not all of the KFA-produced instant coffee products labeled
as Kukeng Coffee are made with ingredients from Kukeng. Such
labeling could be seen as in violation of fraud laws, according
to the inquiry.
</P>
<P>
The investigation is still ongoing. However, the case has badly
damaged the image of the rural township, which began establishing
coffee plantations between 1624-1662 when Taiwan was under Dutch
rule.
</P>
<P>
In 1945, a large-scale coffee plantation was established on Hopau
Hill in Kukeng for the production of premium Taiwan coffee,
according to the rural township administration.
</P>
<P>
At Friday's event, Su described Kukeng coffee beans as "magic
beans" that have been grown for several hundred years, saying
that she believes the recent scandal will never blemish the time-
honored Kukeng coffee's special taste and flavor.
