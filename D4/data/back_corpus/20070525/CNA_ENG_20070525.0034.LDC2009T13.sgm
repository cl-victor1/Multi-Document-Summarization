KMT PRESIDENTIAL TICKET NEEDS SETTLED BY LATE MAY: CANDIDATE
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  May 25 (CNA) 05/25/07  19:35:28 (By Flor Wang)
</P>
<P>
The formation of a presidential ticket for the opposition
Kuomintang (KMT) had better be settled by late May, former  KMT
Chairman  Ma Ying-jeou,  who is also the party's presidential
candidate, said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Ma made the remarks while answering questions from reporters
following a visit to KMT Honorary Chairman Lien Chan, who tried
earlier this year to mediate between Ma and Legislative Yuan
Speaker Wang Jin-pyng in the hope of persuading them to pair up
on a ticket to run in the 2008 presidential election.
</P>
<P>
According to Ma, he told Lien that the issue must not be further
procrastinated over because the KMT cannot "afford to take on the
loss. It's better to fix the matter by the end of this month so
as to avoid creating greater sentiment among supporters, " he
said, adding that he will contact Wang as soon as possible to
talk over the issue.
</P>
<P>
As to the question of what will be his next move if the Ma-Wang
ticket fails to materialize, Ma said only that he "would prefer
to take concrete action than just pay lip service." He did not
elaborate.
</P>
<P>
Ma was nominated early this month by the KMT as its candidate in
the 2008 presidential race, and has repeatedly said that he would
live up to his previous promise to ask Wang to be his running
mate if he won the party's nomination.
</P>
<P>
A Ma-Wang ticket is widely hoped for in the KMT out of fear that
a split might ruin the party's chances of victory in the next
presidential polls. Wang, however, has consistently refused to
even countenance the idea of working with Ma.
