An investigation into the dumping of Chinese footwear on the
local market is entering its final stage and the case is expected
to be closed in mid-July, the International Trade Commission
(ITC) under the Ministry of Economic Affairs said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan imposed a provisional anti-dumping tax of up to 43.46
percent on footwear imported from China March 13 after Taiwan-
made footwear manufacturers filed a complaint with the ITC last
August and the ITC ruled last November that imported cheap
Chinese footwear had inflicted substantial damages on Taiwan
shoemakers.

<P>
Meanwhile, an investigation by the ITC into uncoated paper
imported from Japan, China and Indonesia is also entering its
final stage and is expected to close in late July.
</P>
<P>
The Taiwan Paper Industry Association demanded last August that
anti-dumping measures be imposed on uncoated paper imported from
the three countries.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Finance initially ruled a dumping margin of 37.74
percent for Japan, 2.26 percent for Indonesia and 22.41 percent
for China, but has yet to impose a provisional anti-dumping tax
on the three countries.
