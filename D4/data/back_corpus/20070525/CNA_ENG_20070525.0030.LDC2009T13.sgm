A Tungshan township coffee sampling activity was held at the
Tainan county council headquarters in southern Taiwan Friday, in
which County Magistrate Su Huan-chih pledged that all coffee
products from the Tungshan farmer's association are 100 percent
made of locally grown beans.
</P>
<P>
Su advised local coffee farmers and relevant businesses to take
heed of the recent Kukeng coffee scandal that saw coffee products
from the farmer's association of the Kukeng rural township in
Yunlin, also in southern Taiwan, allegedly adulterated with
imported coffee despite being labeled "Kukeng Coffee. "
</P>
<P>
The Yunlin District Prosecutor's Office has launched an inquiry
into the case and a former executive of the Kukeng farmer's group
has been questioned and released on bail.
</P>
<P>
According to the Tungshan Farmer's Association,  there are
currently six coffee farming groups working for the association,
with 1,500 hectares of land in total. With favorable weather,
total output could reach 80,000 pounds of coffee per year.
</P>
<P>
An agreement between the association and the groups strictly bans
adulteration of local coffee with imported coffee to ensure the
purity of local coffee products, the association said.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan-grown coffee is not cheap in domestic and overseas markets
due to its small output.
