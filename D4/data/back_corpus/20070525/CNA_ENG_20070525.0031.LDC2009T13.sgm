The temperature in Tawu township in eastern Taitung County soared
to 37.4 degrees Celsius Friday, a new high for Taiwan so far this
year, the Central Weather Bureau (CWB) reported that day.

The high temperature, which was recorded at 12: 16 p.m., was
caused by fohn winds, CWB officials said, adding that a fohn wind
occurs when a deep layer of prevailing wind is forced over
mountain range -- in this case, the Central Mountain Range.
