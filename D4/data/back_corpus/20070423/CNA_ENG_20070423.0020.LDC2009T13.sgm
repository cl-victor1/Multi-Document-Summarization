Bilateral trade between Taiwan and the European Union (EU)
increased 6.8 percent to 39.4 billion euros (US$53.4 billion)
last year, making Taiwan the EU's 14th- largest trading partner
worldwide, according to figures released Monday by the European
Economic and Trade Office in Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
In its EU Newsletter for April, the office quoted figures by
Eurostat, the EU's statistics office, as showing that Taiwanese
exports to the EU for 2006 recorded a growth of 9.7 percent,
reaching 26 billion euros.
</P>
<P>
In contrast, EU exports to Taiwan, valued at 13 billion euros,
were far less dynamic, representing growth of only 1.5 percent
and leaving a deficit of 13 billion euros for the EU -- almost 20
percent larger than in 2005.
</P>
<P>
In 2006, Taiwan was the EU's 10th-largest supplier of goods and
its 23rd-biggest customer.
</P>
<P>
Compared with 2005, Taiwan fell four notches last year to become
the EU's 14th- largest trading partner worldwide. In Asia, Taiwan
was the EU's fifth-largest trading partner, behind China, Japan,
South Korea and India.
</P>
<P>
In 2005, Taiwan was the EU's fourth-largest partner, but last
year Taiwan was replaced by India, which recorded a two-way trade
of 46 billion euros with the EU.
</P>
<P>
Citing statistics compiled by Taiwan's Ministry of Economic
Affairs, the European Economic and Trade Office pointed out that
new EU investment in Taiwan totaled US$7 billion in 2006,
accounting for more than half of all new foreign investment in
Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
As a result, accumulated EU direct investment in Taiwan has more
than doubled to US$15 billion, accounting for 20 percent of all
foreign direct investment in Taiwan and making the EU the largest
foreign investor in Taiwan, ahead of the United States and Japan.
</P>
<P>
The number of Taiwanese visitors to the EU reached a record high
of 330,000 last year, representing an increase of 10 percent over
2005.
</P>
<P>
Approximately 25,000 Taiwanese students are studying in Europe
today, including more than 12,000 who enrolled in 2006. Many
students from Taiwan have taken advantage of opportunities
offered by EU member states  and the EU Commission to obtain
grants  and scholarships.
</P>
<P>
Guy Ledoux, head of the European Economic and Trade Office in
Taiwan, who assumed office in March, said in the newsletter that
his office will continue to promote a healthy trade environment
in Taiwan for the 25-state EU.
</P>
<P>
"Dialogue and willingness to resolve trade issues will continue
to be the most productive approach," Ledoux said.
