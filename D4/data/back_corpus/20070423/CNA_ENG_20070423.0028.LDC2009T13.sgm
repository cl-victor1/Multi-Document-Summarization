FOUR TAIPEI COUNTY TOWNSHIPS OBJECT TO PROPOSED NUCLEAR FUEL
STORAGE

Residents from four of Taipei County's townships voiced strong
opposition Monday to a plan by Taiwan's Nuclear Power Plant No. 1
to build a dry-storage facility at the plant site to keep its
spent nuclear fuel.
</P>
<P>
The heads of Wanli, Shihmen, Chinshan and Sanchih townships and
some  200 residents  gathered  in front  of the Cabinet-level
Environmental Protection Administration (EPA) to protest the
proposal by Taiwan Power Co. (Taipower) to build the storage
facility within the grounds of Nuclear Power Plant No. 1 in
Taipei County.
</P>
<P>
The EPA's Department of Comprehensive Planning is currently
assessing the construction plan's possible impact on the
environment.
</P>
<P>
Tsai Chang-ming, president of an inter-township association for
the promotion of nuclear power plant safety, said it is not fair
to residents of Taipei County because three of Taiwan's four
nuclear power plants are located in their county, with the No. 1
plant in Shihmen township, the No. 2 plant in Wanli township, and
the No. 4 plant -- still under construction -- in Kungliao
township.
</P>
<P>
Tsai said Taipei County residents  are firmly opposed  to
Taipower's plan to build a spent fuel dry-storage facility at the
site of Nuclear Power Plant No. 1.
</P>
<P>
Shihmen township head Liang Yu-hsueh noted that Taipower has held
some 200 briefings in Taipei County in an attempt to convince its
residents of the safety of the facility.
</P>
<P>
"Those Taipei County residents who attended the briefings have
not the slightest idea of what a dry-storage facility is about
when Taipower asked them whether they would accept the plan, yet
Taipower has claimed to EPA officials that the Taipei County
residents have demonstrated a high level of acceptance of the
plan," Liang said.
</P>
<P>
Spent nuclear fuel -- a byproduct of the fission of uranium in
commercial nuclear plants -- is highly radioactive.
</P>
<P>
Currently, spent nuclear fuel is stored in deep pools of water at
most nuclear power plants. However, by designing facilities for
spent nuclear fuel dry storage, the need for maintaining high
cost pools can be eliminated.
