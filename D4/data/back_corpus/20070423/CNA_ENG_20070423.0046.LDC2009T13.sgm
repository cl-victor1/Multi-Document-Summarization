TWO DPP PRIMARY FRONTRUNNERS SPAT OVER 'ONE CHINA'\
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  April  23  (CNA) 04/23/07  23:44:46 (By Sofia Wu)

<P>
The two frontrunners in the ruling Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP)  primary fray for the 2008 presidential election continued
squabbling Monday over the "one China" framework of the country's
Constitution.
</P>
<P>
Premier Su Tseng-chang, who is seeking for the DPP nomination to
run for next presidency, said in an interview with CNA that Frank
Hsieh, Su's predecessor who is also bidding to represent the DPP
in the 2008 election, should clarify his "one China" Constitution
framework rhetoric because none of those aspiring for presidency
should dodge the issue regarding the country's status.
</P>
<P>
Su on Hsieh has said on numerous previous occasions that Taiwan's
current Constitution has a "one China" framework in which China
refers to the Republic of China -- Taiwan's official title.
</P>
<P>
Claiming  that Hsieh's rhetoric has caused confusions  and
misgivings among many DPP politicians and grassroots supporters,
Su said Hsieh should expound on the content of his "one China"
framework doctrine.
</P>
<P>
The pro-independence DPP has been very sensitive to the term "one
China" because Beijing has never hesitated to tell the world its
ultimate goal of unify Taiwan under the "one China" principle and
the almost the entire world perceives "one China" as the People's
Republic of China, Beijing's national title.
</P>
<P>
Su said Hsieh must clarify his stance on the issue; otherwise, he
claimed that the DPP would be identical with the main opposition
Kuomintang (KMT) with regard to Taiwan's status and the country's
future.
</P>
<P>
Su trailed behind the top-ranking Hsieh in an opinion poll
conducted by alocal newspaper immediately after Saturday's second
round of policy debates among the four DPP presidential
contenders which also include Vice President Annette Lu and DPP
Chairman Yu Shyi-kun. In Saturday's debate, Su and Hsieh already
spatted over the "one China" framework issues.
</P>
<P>
In the interview with CNA, Su was asked whether he is willing to
pair with Hsieh if he wins DPP primary, su said the issue
regarding "one China" framework should be resolved first.
</P>
<P>
"For me, political conviction is most important and relevant. It
should come first before the pairing-up issue will be addressed.
Position, power or fame is not so important for me. I can
withdraw from the race if my political ideals and convictions
have to be compromised," he added.
</P>
<P>
In response to Su's challenge for a further explanation of the
doctrine, Chao Tien-lin, spokesman for the Hsih campaign, said it
is Su himself most obliged to explain his stance on the
constitutional reform issues.
</P>
<P>
"Su had vowed on previous occasions, such as when he assumed
office as presidential secretary-general and the DPP
chairmanship, not to touch on such sensitive issues as the
independence vs. unification  debate,  change  of national  title
and territory boundaries, " Chao said, adding that Su should
explain why he is now so eager to address the constitutional
framework issues.
</P>
<P>
"Hsieh has repeatedly explained that the 'one China' framework is
an issue Taiwan must face squarely because it's the shackles
Taiwan should cast off and break free, " Chao said, adding that
Hsieh called attention to the issue in an aim to have the "one
Chian" framework revised, scrapped or overturned, not to uphold
it.
