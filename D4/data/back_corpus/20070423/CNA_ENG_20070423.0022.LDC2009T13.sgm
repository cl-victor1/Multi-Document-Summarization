The Executive Yuan will release the results of an investigation
into the main opposition Kuomintang's (KMT) "ill-gotten" party
assets April 25, and a Web site publishing the survey outcome
will go online that same day, an Executive Yuan official said
Monday.

According to the official, the survey on the KMT's illegally or
improperly acquired party assets during its authoritarian rule of
Taiwan, was completed recently by agencies under the Executive
Yuan coordinated by Minister without Portfolio Hsu Chih-hsiung.

The official said the investigation results will include many
categories, including real estate owned by the KMT or its
affiliates, revenues of the party's business, and surplus
retirement payments for retired  KMT personnel whose party
employment  was considered equivalent to government seniority.

Quoting  statistics  conducted  by  the  National  Property
Administration under the Ministry of Economic Affairs, the
official said the KMT has 685 plots of land registered of a total
of 148 hectares, valued at about NT$24.32 billion. Another NT$168
million comes from the party's ownership of the Chientan Youth
Activity Center.

Statistics of the Ministry of Economic Affairs show that seven
main businesses owned by the KMT gained net revenue of NT$87.1
billion from 1994-2005, the official said, adding that NT$100
million has been paid to 267 retired KMT personnel who were
allowed to count their party employment toward their government
seniority and received pensions accordingly.
