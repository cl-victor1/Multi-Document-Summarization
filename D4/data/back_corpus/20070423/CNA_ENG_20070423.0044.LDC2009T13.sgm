Taipei, April 23 (CNA) 04/23/07  22:44:44 (By T.C. Jiang)

Taiwan will continue to exert its "soft power" and dedicate
itself to democracy, peace, human rights, love and the
development of advanced technologies to win the world's
recognition, Vice President Annette Lu said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Lu made the remarks at an assembly of an association promoting
cultural and trade exchanges between Taiwan and Mongolia. She
also presented credentials to the association's newly elected
directors and supervisors at the assembly.
</P>
<P>
Before its independence from China, Mongolia was able to
withstand a great threat from China and eventually became a
democratic country, Lu said, adding that this was not an easy
task and that Mongolia deserves praise from the people of Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
She also noted that the Mongolian government and people use
modernization to promote democracy and human rights, as well as
sharing its culture with the world.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan, on the other hand, is small, but uses "soft power" to
stand strongly in the international community and take great
leaps forward in this highly competitive era, the vice president
continued.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan has been under a grave military threat from China for 50
years, but the people of Taiwan have never compromised and face
the challenges squarely, Lu said.
</P>
<P>
As a result, Taiwan has been able to sustain its development and
create prosperity and progress, Lu went on, describing Taiwan as
"a miracle in the world."
</P>
<P>
Saying that Taiwan is willing to cooperate and exchange
experiences with Mongolia, Lu noted that although the two nations
are geographically apart, the distance can be narrowed through
the help of the association.
</P>
<P>
She said Taiwan faces many difficulties in the international
arena.  However, she added,  the 21st Century is an era of
globalization and Taiwan will expand its presence wherever there
is friendship and justice.
