Defying the traditional concept that physically and mentally
disabled people are not competitive in the high-tech industry,
executives of three local electronic firms hailed them Monday for
their efficiency.
</P>
<P>
The chief executive officers of three companies made the remarks
at a press conference held in Taipei to mark the 10th anniversary
of the promulgation of the country's Physically and Mentally
Disabled Citizens Protection Act.
</P>
<P>
The CEO of Siliconware Precision Industries Co., the world's
third-largest provider of semiconductor assembly and test
services, noted that they now hire 139 physically and mentally
disabled persons in comparison with the total number of 11,505
employees of the company.
</P>
<P>
The executive admitted that although physically and mentally
disabled people learn things relatively slowly, they are more
likely to concentrate.
</P>
<P>
Citing the example of some aurally impaired employees, the CEO
said they can totally focus on their work since they are less
likely to be bothered by outside noise.
</P>
<P>
In addition, they will treasure their jobs more and perform
excellently if given the opportunity, the CEO added.
</P>
<P>
The Chipbond Technology Corp., which is a leading provider of
wafer bumping services, was fined for several years for failing
to hire a sufficient percentage of physically and mentally
disabled persons as stipulated by the law, until it finally hired
the required ratio early this year.
</P>
<P>
A Chipbond executive said the company found the lifetime of the
production machines increased, which the firm attributed to the
care of the disabled employees. Among the current 1,937 employees
of Chipbond, 24 are disabled.
</P>
<P>
A section chief of Coretronic, a 1,000-employee company dedicated
to offering projection and display solutions, said the firm
employs 33 physically and mentally disabled persons.
</P>
<P>
With adequate arrangements,  the Coretronic executive said,
disability does not cause a hindrance to working ability.
</P>
<P>
Lee Ying-yuan, chairman of the Council of Labor Affairs (COA) ,
said on the same occasion that the COA's goal for this year is to
train some 3,000 physically or mentally disabled persons and to
help 3,000 of them to find work in public organizations or
private corporations.
