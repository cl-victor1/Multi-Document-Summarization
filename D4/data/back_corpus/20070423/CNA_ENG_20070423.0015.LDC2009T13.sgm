NATIONALITY LAW WOULD BECOME 'IMMIGRATION FAST TRACK:' DPP
LEGISLATOR
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taipei,  April 23 (CNA) 04/23/07  17:39:34 (By Deborah Kuo)

<P>
A ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) legislator expressed
worry Monday that an article of the existing Nationality Law
could provide a fast track for foreign nationals to become
Republic of China citizens.
</P>
<P>
DPP Legislator Wang Hsin-nan was basing his concern on Item I of
Article Three of the Nationality Law, which he said stipulates
that foreigners or non-ROC citizens who stay over 183 days per
year in Taiwan for five consecutive years are allowed to apply
for Republic of China citizenship.
</P>
<P>
This item, he claimed, might open a convenient door to foreign
nationals, particularly foreigners who are hired to work aboard
Taiwan fishing vessels; foreign household helpers or caregivers;
and foreign laborers hired to work on major national  development
projects, since these type of people are allowed to stay in
Taiwan for up to six years per contract in accordance with a
newly passed amendment to an article in the employment services
law.
</P>
<P>
Wang said the legislature must do something on what he described
as this contradiction caused by two articles from two different
laws.
</P>
<P>
The Legislative Yuan's Home and Nations Committee will study
whether Nationality Law should be revised as proposed by Wang.
