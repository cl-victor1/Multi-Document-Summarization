The newly-formed landmine clearing brigade of the Kinmen Defense
Command began formal operations Monday, with expectations that it
will eliminate the threat of landmines from the outlying island,
officers of the command said.

<P>
The brigade was expanded April 1 from a small team put together
by the command last September in a drive to train local talent
with mine clearing knowledge and skills.

According to the command there are currently 189 mined areas on
Kinmen, and over 4.1 million square meters of land concealing
approximately 70,000 explosive units.
