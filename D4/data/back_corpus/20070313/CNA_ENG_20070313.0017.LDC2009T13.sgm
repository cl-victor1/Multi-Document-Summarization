PRESIDENT CALLS FOR TRI-PARTY MANAGEMENT OF PEACE IN TAIWAN
STRAIT
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

Taipei, March 13 (CNA) 03/13/07  15:19:15 (By Lilian Wu)
</P>
<P>
President Chen Shui-bian made a four-point appeal Tuesday on the
eve of the second anniversary of the enactment of China's so-
called Anti-Secession Law, including a call for three-party
management among Taiwan, the United States and China of peace in
the Taiwan Strait.
</P>
<P>
President Chen said that Taiwan is against U.S.-China management
of Taiwan and that Taiwan, the United States and China should
jointly manage peace, security and stability in the Taiwan
Strait.
</P>
<P>
The president made the appeal when he received John Hamre,
president and CEO of the Center for Strategic and International
Studies (CSIS) , a U.S. think tank based in Washington D.C., at
the Presidential Office.
</P>
<P>
Noting that China passed the Anti-Secession Law on March 14, 2005
to provide a legal basis for the use of "non-peaceful means"
against Taiwan should the island move toward formal independence,
Chen said the law highlights China's bellicose and hegemonic
nature, which he said poses the greatest threat to the democratic
community in the Asia-Pacific region.
</P>
<P>
He noted that China fired missiles in the Taiwan Strait just 55
km off Taiwan proper in March 1996 ahead of the island's first
popular presidential election.
</P>
<P>
Beijing's military spending has continued to grow by double-digit
figures since the 1989 Tiananmen Square Massacre, including a
17.8-percent increase in its military budget for this year, Chen
noted, adding that this is well above the amount needed for
China's self-defense.
</P>
<P>
Given China's  passage of the Anti-Secession  Law and its
completion of preparations to use force against Taiwan in three
stages, Chen called for the European Union not to lift its arms
embargo against China, imposed shortly after the 1989 Tiananmen
Square Massacre, until China's human rights situation improves
and Beijing renounces the use of force against Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
China's three-stage military preparations refers to establishing
contingency- response combat capabilities by 2007, building up
its combat capability for a large-scale military engagement by
2010, and building up its forces to ensure victory in a decisive
battle by 2015.
</P>
<P>
He also called for China to learn from Taiwan's policy of a
neutral military, saying that China's People's Liberation Army
should be the nation's army, instead of serving the Communist
Party of China.
</P>
<P>
In addition, China should conduct democratic elections so that
the Chinese people can choose their national leader, and
opposition parties should be recognized and given a fair chance
to win the elections, he added.
