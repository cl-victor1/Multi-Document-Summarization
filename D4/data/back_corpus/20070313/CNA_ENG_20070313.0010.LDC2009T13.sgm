MOFA URGES LOCAL NGOS TO USE 'TAIWAN' AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE

Taipei,  March  13  (CNA) 03/13/07  14:33:16 (By Lilian Wu)
</P>
<P>
Local non-governmental organizations (NGOs) should use the name
"Taiwan" in the international community as much as possible, a
Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) official said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Chiang Kuo-chiang, vice chairman of the NGO Affairs Committee
under the MOFA, made the remarks against the backdrop of BirdLife
International, under pressure from China, having recently asked
Taiwan's wild bird federation to change its name.
</P>
<P>
The name "Taiwan" should be used by local NGOs as much as
possible to "safeguard Taiwan's rights and to avoid confusion, "
Chiang said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that Taiwan, the habitat of five rare birds in the
world, has played a vital role in bird conservation.
</P>
<P>
"Faced with the irrational request by China, Taiwan will not
budge, " he said, noting that BirdLife International officials
are scheduled to come to Taiwan this week and that the ministry
will help the Wild Bird Federation Taiwan to communicate with
them.
</P>
<P>
Noting that China has relentlessly stifled Taiwan in the
international community, Chiang expressed the hope that when a
local NGO joins an international organization in which China is
not yet a member, the NGO should use the name "Taiwan." Local
NGOs should also request that the stipulation that a new member
should not affect the rights of existing members be included in
the organization's charter, he added.
</P>
<P>
If an NGO from Taiwan joins an international organization in
which China is already a member, the NGO should engage in more
contact with the international directors or even vie for a seat
on the board of directors to ensure that its rights will not be
compromised.
</P>
<P>
"Taiwan hopes to take part in NGO affairs along with China, and
China should respect also the rights of Taiwan," Chiang stressed.
