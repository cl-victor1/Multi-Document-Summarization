ANTI-SECESSION ENACTMENT FAILED CHINESE POLICY: MAC OFFICIAL
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  March 13 (CNA) 03/13/07  20:20:54 (By Luis Huang)

Cabinet-level Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) Vice Chairman Tung
Chen-yuan described China's enactment of its so-called Anti-
Secession Law targeting Taiwan as a "failed" policy Tuesday,
saying it has hindered the positive development of bilateral
relations.
</P>
<P>
Tung made the remarks while speaking at a symposium on the
development of cross- Taiwan Strait relations organized by the
Taiwan Thinktank on the eve of the second anniversary of the
enactment of the Anti-Secession Law, which authorizes Beijing to
use non-peaceful means against Taiwan if it moves toward formal
independence.
</P>
<P>
According to the results of a public opinion survey conducted by
the thinktank and released during the seminar, 80.2 percent of
those polled said the law is not in the Taiwan people's
interests, while 79.5 percent said Taiwan's future should be
decided by the Taiwan people, instead of by the people on both
sides of the Taiwan Strait.
</P>
<P>
Claiming that China has committed a serious error in its Taiwan
policy, Tung cited many Chinese scholars and officials as saying
that Beijing's Taiwan policy is likely to be erroneous due to its
lack of understanding about the former Kuomintang-led government.
After the Democratic Progressive Party came to power in 2000,
China still committed the same error, drafting its cross-strait
policy based upon an illusory fundamental that will not help
promote cross-strait peace and stability.
</P>
<P>
Tung said China seriously harmed the Taiwan people's feelings,
interests and values by enacting the Anti-Secession Law March 14,
2005. The Beijing leadership claims that "cross-strait relations
should be subject to approval by people on both sides of the
Taiwan Strait, " but the survey shows it is the Taiwan people's
consensus that Taiwan's future should be decided by the Taiwan
people, he added.
</P>
<P>
President Chen Shui-bian has repeatedly described Taiwan as a
democratic, independent country with sovereignty and will not
rule out developing any form of relations with China in the
future with prior approval by the people of Taiwan, according to
Tung.
</P>
<P>
It is also a joint consensus of both Taiwan and the international
community that the Taiwan issue must be settled in a peaceful,
democratic way,  Tung said, expressing hope that the Beijing
authorities will respond positively to appeals from the
international community and to Taiwan mainstream opinion.
