Taipei,  March 13 (CNA) 03/13/07  16:54:55 (By Lilian Wu)

<P>
The Ministry of National Defense (MND) denied Tuesday that Taiwan
is scheduled to produce 500 Hsiungfeng 2E missiles that will
bring Shanghai within its firing range.
</P>
<P>
MND spokesman Wu Chi-fang said the reports carried in the latest
issue of Defense News, a U.S. weekly magazine, "were untrue."
</P>
<P>
The weekly quoted Taiwanese media to report that President Chen
Shui-bian and National Defense Minister Lee Jye recently
inspected a secret test firing of Hsiungfeng 2E missiles in
Pingtung, southern Taiwan. The missiles, which have a range
between 600 kilometers and 1,000 kilometers, could threaten parts
of eastern China, including Shanghai, it said.
</P>
<P>
Wu noted that the MND has repeatedly clarified before that
Hsiungfeng-series missiles are "ship-to-ship" missiles.
</P>
<P>
Minister Lee also clarified during a question-and-answer session
at a legislative committee Monday that related reports about the
test firing of Hsiungfeng 2E missiles were false.
</P>
<P>
The MND did not categorically denied the reports earlier because
it hopes to hoodwink the enemy, Lee said.
