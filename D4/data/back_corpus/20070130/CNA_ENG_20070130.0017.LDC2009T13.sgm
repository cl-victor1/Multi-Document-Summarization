A Taiwan product catalog exhibition and business meeting, jointly
sponsored by the Taipei Mission in Korea and the Korea Importers
Association, opened here Tuesday with the aim of narrowing
Taiwan's growing trade deficit with South Korea.
</P>
<P>
On display are catalogues of more than 300 types of Taiwan-made
products offered  by  around  160  manufacturers,  including
optoelectronic products, LED apparatus, electronic components and
parts, auto parts and accessories, hand tools, plastic products,
medical instruments, body building equipment, and processed
foods.

Yao Hung-cheng, director of the Economic Division under the
Taipei Mission in Korea, as well as other officials from the
division and the Taiwan Trade Center in Seoul were present at the
exhibition on the opening day to offer their services, including
answering questions from visitors.

Yao said that the two countries have enjoyed increasingly close
trade exchanges over the past several years, with the two-way
trade volume for 2006 amounting to US$22.15 billion, up 15.9
percent year-on-year. Taiwan exported US$7.15 billion worth of
products to South Korea, up 21.7 percent from the previous year's
level, while imports from South Korea totaled US$15 billion, up
13.3 percent year-on-year, he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
As a result, Taiwan recorded a trade deficit of US$7.85 billion,
Yao said.
</P>
<P>
Noting that two-way trade for the current year is forecast to
reach US$26 billion, Yao voiced the hope that Taiwan will be able
to reduce its trade deficit with South Korea to less than US$8
billion.
</P>
<P>
Having listed South Korea as one of the promotional targets for
Taiwan exports, the Ministry of Economic Affairs will continue to
help Taiwan manufacturers explore trade opportunities with their
South Korean counterparts this year, according to Yao.
