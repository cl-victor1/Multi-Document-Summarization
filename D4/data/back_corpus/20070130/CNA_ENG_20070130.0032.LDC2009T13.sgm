<P>
Transportation authorities will begin Feb. 1 to correct unclear
and inappropriate road signs around the country, for which they
say they need people's assistance.
</P>
<P>
There are tens of thousands of road signs of various types around
Taiwan, installed  by  the  Ministry  of  Transportation  and
Communications (MOTC) which recently instructed its researchers
to correct those causing confusion.
</P>
<P>
People often sent messages to the MOTC claiming that they could
not understand the instructions provided by specific road signs,
MOTC officials said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
With this in mind, the MOTC Institute of Transportation was
commissioned to set up a toll-free telephone hot line for people
to report "unclear and improper" road signs.
</P>
<P>
Beginning Thursday, people who wish to file a report can call
0800-231-900, extension 5, or visit the MOTC institute's Web site
at "http: //safety.iot.gov.tw, " officials said, urging the
public to help they identify all unclear or confusing road signs.
</P>
<P>
Each of problematic signs will be corrected within 15 days,
according to the MOTC.
