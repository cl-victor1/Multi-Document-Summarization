Vice President Annette Lu expressed satisfaction with the
performance of China Shipbuilding Corp. (CSBC) when she visited
the company's Kaohsiung shipyard Tuesday.

Lu was briefed on the company by CSBC President Fan Kuang-nan
before taking a gondola to see a 200,000-ton freighter that the
company has been commissioned to build.
</P>
<P>
Fan said the company's revenues totaled NT$19.8 billion (US$600
million) last year. This year, in addition to working toward an
increase in revenues to NT$24.4 billion, the company also plans
to raise the volume of shipbuilding to 180,000 tons from 120,000
tons last year.

<P>
The company also wants to improve building processes, shorten
building time, make early delivery of vessels to upgrade
operation efficiency and cut building costs, Fan added.
</P>
<P>
The CSBC, founded in 1976, has seen its operations improve in
recent years after being in the red for years.
