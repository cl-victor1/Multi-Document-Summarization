BUYING CHINESE TOBACCO LEAVES TO TAP INTO CHINESE MARKET: LOCAL
FIRM
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  Jan.  30 (CNA) 01/30/07  19:27:20 (By Elizabeth Hsu)

Faced with criticism over an import of tobacco leaves from China,
the general manager of the state-operated Taiwan Tobacco and
Liquor Corporation (TTL) explained Tuesday that the import was
made for the sole purpose of developing and producing a "Chinese
market-oriented" tobacco formula.
</P>
<P>
Lai Shun-tang offered the explanation in a press conference after
Legislator Chiang Lien-fu of the opposition Kuomintang revealed
the TTL has purchased 20 tons of tobacco leaves from China over
the past month despite of the government's reluctance to
promoting commercial exchanges between the two sides of the
Taiwan Strait.
</P>
<P>
Denouncing the purchase as a move designed to profit the
government, which has set restrictions against private cross-
strait commercial trading, Chiang wondered aloud why the state-
run company has been reluctant to buy locally-grown tobacco
leaves.
</P>
<P>
It is like saying that "one man may steal a horse, while others
are not allowed to look over the hedge," Chiang criticized.
</P>
<P>
Lai explained the TTL has to work out a special tobacco flavor
for Chinese consumers, whom the company has found are not fond of
their most popular product in Taiwan, the "Long Life" series of
cigarettes.
</P>
<P>
In the future the "China market-oriented" product, containing
locally-grown and imported tobacco leaves, will only be shipped
to the mainland, Lai said, noting they will only use locally-
grown leaves to produce cigarettes for the local market.
</P>
<P>
"No local farmers will be affected by the company's imports," Lai
stressed.
</P>
<P>
The TTL is permitted to sell its Long Life-brand cigarettes to
China and the exports are expected to begin this year, according
to the company, which has also applied to open an office in the
mainland.
</P>
<P>
Lai said the TTL is still waiting for the government's approval
for the application.
