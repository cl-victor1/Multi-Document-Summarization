The Chung Hwa College of Medical Technology, located in in Jenteh
township, Tainan County, has received the green light from the
Ministry of Education to upgrade itself to a university from Feb.
1.

Lin Shou-hung, who has served as chancellor of the college for 11
years, invited Vice Minister of Education Chou Tsan-teh and local
dignitaries to a ceremony Tuesday to inaugurate the university.

<P>
The institution was originally founded in 1968 as the China
Junior College of Medical Technology to offer a five-year daytime
program in three departments for junior high school graduates. In
1988, it added a daytime program and a night school program --
both lasting two years -- for senior high school graduates.

The school was upgraded to a regular college in 1999 and after
further development over the past seven years, won approval to
become a university consisting of three colleges -- the College
of Life Sciences and Medicine, the College of Human Ecology,
Science and Technology, and the College of Health Administration.
</P>
<P>
Altogether, the university has 13 undergraduate departments and
two graduate programs.

<P>
According to Lin, the university will phase out its current two-
year and five- year junior college divisions in a few years and
then concentrate on its undergraduate and graduate programs.
