Taipei,  Jan. 30 (CNA) 01/30/07  20:10:13 (By Y.C. Jou)

The remains of Yang Chuan-kwang, Taiwan's legendary decathlete
who died of a stroke in California at the age of 74 last
Saturday, will be cremated in the United States after his last
wish of being buried at Taiwan's national sports training center
was rejected by the Taiwan authorities, Yang's wife said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The government and Taiwan sports organizations, however, will
form a funeral committee, with Premier Su Tseng-chang serving as
honorary chairman, to assist Yang's family and hold a memorial
ceremony in Taiwan, Chinese Taipei Olympic Committee Vice
Chairman Tsai Szu-chung said that day.
</P>
<P>
Yang had been cited by his family and friends as having expressed
the wish to be buried in the National Sports Training Center in
Zuoying, Kaohsiung, but this is not allowed under current laws
and regulations, according to sports affairs officials.
</P>
<P>
Another suggestion that Yang be laid to rest in the Martyr's
Shrine in Taipei was also rejected as the shrine only accepts
those who sacrifice their lives serving the country or the
public. Yang, though a national hero, died of illness, Tsai said.
</P>
<P>
Yang's wife said after discussions with government officials that
the family understands the government's concerns and decided to
hold Yang's cremation near Los Angeles Feb. 3.
</P>
<P>
The government has agreed to the Yang family's request to have
his coffin covered with the national flag and Taiwan's Olympic
flag, and will send delegates to pay tribute to him at the
funeral, a National Council on Physical Fitness and Sports
(NCPFS) official said.
</P>
<P>
Tsai said the government will bear the cost of all the funeral
expenses.
</P>
<P>
Yang, a member of the Ami tribe born in 1933, won gold in the
decathalon at the 1954 Asian Games in Manila. Dubbed the "Iron
man of Asia, " he won gold again at the 1958 Tokyo Asian Games
and took silver at the 1960 Rome Olympics after a duel with his
UCLA schoolmate Rafer Johnson of the United States. It was the
first Olympic medal Taiwan had ever won.
