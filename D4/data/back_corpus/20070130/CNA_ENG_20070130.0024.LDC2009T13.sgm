The 2007 Taipei International Book Exhibition (TIBE), featuring
Russian miniature books, opened Tuesday at the Taipei World Trade
Center halls and will run though Feb. 4.
</P>
<P>
The focus of the Asia's largest book fair is on some 130 such
books brought by Russian collector Yaroslav Kostyuk, according to
the organizers.
</P>

Kostyuk was quoted as saying that he has collected some 3,000
miniature books. At the beginning, he just thought they were
light, pretty, and easy to take with him as he found that he was
able to tuck them into a pocket and read them at his convenience.

Among the books, a 1996 edition of "Chameleon" by Russian author
Chekhov, was recorded in the Guinness Book as the "smallest book
in the world", the organizers said.
</P>
<P>
The "Chameleon", measuring just 0.09 cm x 0.09 cm, was fabricated
by Anatoliy Konenko of Russia, the organizer said, adding that in
2006, Konenko remodeled two even smaller books, measuring 0.08 cm
x 0.08 cm, as he prepared again to challenge the Guinness record.
