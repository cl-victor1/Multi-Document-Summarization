The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) formally announced Tuesday
morning that Taiwan has re-established diplomatic relations with
Saint Lucia.

The MOFA made the announcement in a telephone hook-up with
Foreign Affairs Minister James Huang, who is currently visiting
the eastern Caribbean island nation.

Premier Su Tseng-chang said last Wednesday that Saint Lucia has
become Taiwan's 25th diplomatic ally after Saint Lucia's minister
of foreign affairs announced the news.

St. Lucia first established diplomatic ties with Taiwan in 1984
but then switched diplomatic recognition to China in 1997.
