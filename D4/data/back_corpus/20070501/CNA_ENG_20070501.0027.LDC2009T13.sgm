Taipei,  May 1 (CNA) 05/01/07  18:16:11 (By Lilian Wu)

<P>
Premier Su Tseng-chang dismissed reports Tuesday that he will
soon leave his post, which he characterized as "misinformation."
</P>
<P>
The premier said that he has no intention of stepping down at the
moment. Furthermore, as both assuming and leaving the premiership
are significant events, such matters should not be undertaken
"rashly," he said.
</P>
<P>
The premier, one of the front runners bidding to represent the
ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) in the 2008
presidential election, was responding to reports in the China
Times.
</P>
<P>
The local newspaper cited sources close to former Premier Frank
Hsieh, another DPP presidential hopeful, as saying that if Su
resigns from his post after a defeat in the primary, he will
"look bad." The sources said that the DPP member vote will be
held May 6, and that if Su garners only 15,000 more votes than
Hsieh, he could announce his resignation May 7 or May 8, using
the act to boost his approval ratings in the subsequent public
opinion polls to be held May 9-11.
</P>
<P>
The votes of DPP members will account for 30 percent of the final
score while the results of a series of public opinion polls will
account for the remaining 70 percent.
</P>
<P>
With the primary  drawing  near,  three other presidential
aspirants, which also include Vice President Annette Lu and DPP
Chairman Yu Shyi-kun, have launched blistering attacks on Su for
remaining in his post and using administrative resources to
engage in "pork barrel" campaign tactics, a charge which Su has
angrily denied.
</P>
<P>
Asked whether he will resign after the primary, the premier said
only, "As of now, I have no intention to resign."
