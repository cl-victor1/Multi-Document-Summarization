Taipei,  May 1 (CNA) 05/01/07  23:42:58 (By Sofia Wu)

The Mainalnd Affairs Council (MAC) urged the Hong Kong government
Tuesday to open a representative office in Taipei as soon as
possible to facilitate its services and assistance for Hong Kong
citizens residing or traveling in Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
The MAC, a Cabinet-level body which charts Taiwan's policy toward
China, made the appeal after three Hong Kong tourists were
slightly injured in a traffic mishap in Alishan, a scenic
mountain resort in the southern county of Chiayi the day before.
</P>
<P>
While the MAC immediately informed the Hong Kong authorities of
the accident, the Hong Kong government didn't send any personnel
to help the Hong Kong tour group. It instead asked a travel
agency executive to come to Taipei to help with relevant affairs.
</P>
<P>
As the Hong Kong tourists sustaned only minor wounds, they
already went back to Hong Kong with 10 other members of the tour
group Tuesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
An MAC official said the accident has once again highlighted the
need for the Hogn Kong government to open a permanent
representative office or liaison office in Taipei to facilitate
bilateral exchanges and assistance to Hong Kong expatriates or
tourists in Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Given the close civilian exchanges and booming commercial ties
between the two sides, the official said, Hong Kong authorities
should not hestitate to open a permanent office in Taipei any
longer.
