Taipei, May 1 (CNA) 05/01/07  17:17:23 (By Flor Wang)

The legislative caucus of the main opposition Kuomintang (KMT)
Tuesday urged the government to pay heed to the results of an
economic forum held recently between the KMT and the Communist
Party of China (CPC) in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
KMT legislative caucus whip Hsu Shao-ping said that 13 agreements
were reached during the third KMT-CPC economic forum ending
Sunday in Beijing, and called on the administration of the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) to recognize the KMT's efforts
and to focus its energy on taking care of the people's needs.
</P>
<P>
If the ruling DPP is really concerned about the people's
livelihoods, it should stop governing the country with a mainland
phobia and refrain from engaging in verbal wars with opposition
parties, Hsu said.
</P>
<P>
Hsu said that they plan to visit relevant government officials
over the next two days and hold seminars to explore the
possibility of cooperation between Taiwan and China based on the
13 agreements.
</P>
<P>
KMT lawmaker Pan Wei-kang expressed her regret that the ruling
DPP has failed to accept these positive results from the KMT-CPC
economic forum due to ideological strife prior to two key
elections.
</P>
<P>
Rebutting remarks made by Council for Economic Planning and
Development (CEPD) Chairwoman Ho Mei-yueh that an opening to
Chinese tourists will do little to help improve Taiwan's economy,
Pan said that the measure will bring in 365,000 Chinese tourists
per year to Taiwan, amounting to some 11 percent of the current
foreign tourist arrivals.
</P>
<P>
The people's concern for the opening measure could be detected in
the domestic stock market, which plummeted by 74 points Monday on
the news that the opening of Taiwan to Chinese tourists will not
be implemented in the coming months, Pan said.
