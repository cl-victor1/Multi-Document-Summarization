A run for Taiwanese people's health and Taiwan's bid to join the
World Health Organization (WHO), jointly sponsored by the Seattle
branch of the North American Taiwanese Medical Association
(NATMA) and 17 Taiwanese expatriate associations, took place in
the U.S. city of Seattle Monday, with around 300 people
participating.

Headed by Chen Chun-ming, director of the Taipei Economic and
Cultural Office (TECO) in Seattle, the participants jogged around
Green Lake, wearing sports caps printed with "run for Taiwanese
health and Taiwan's WHO bid" to highlight the country's efforts
to join the international health body.

Chen thanked the NATMA Seattle branch for organizing such a
meaningful jogging activity in support of Taiwan's bid to join
the WHO, saying that President Chen Shui-bian has sent a letter
to WHO Director-General Margaret Chan expressing the nation's
desire to become a WHO full member under the name of "Taiwan."

<P>
Stressing that the right of the 23 million people of Taiwan to
join the WHO should not be ignored, the TECO director called for
the international community to support Taiwan's WHO bid so that
the country "will not become a hole in the global epidemic
prevention system."
</P>

Taiwan has sought to join the World Health Assembly (WHA) as an
observer since 1997 but has seen little progress in its bid due
to China's obstruction. At the WHA gathering last year, Taiwan's
hopes of joining the organization were dashed for the 10th
consecutive year when the WHA General Committee decided not to
include Taiwan's bid on the assembly's agenda.
