The opposition Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU) will stage a sit-in
in front of the Legislative Yuan May 3 as part of its efforts to
push for an early passage of the central government's 2007 budget
plan, Chiang Yueh-chin, executive director of the TSU's publicity
department, said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Chiang told reporters that TSU Chairman Huang Kun-hui will lead
all party lawmakers and members of the TSU Central Executive
Committee in the planned sit- in, adding that they will attend
the sit-in in rotation until the budget plan clears the
legislature.
</P>
<P>
According to Chiang, the TSU will not rule out staging a hunger
strike to push for lawmakers from across the political spectrum
to deal with and pass the Executive Yuan's budget plan for 2007.
</P>
<P>
The Legislative Yuan's delay in passing the budget plan has not
only hindered the implementation  of several  major  national
development projects but has also affected the central
government's allocation of various subsidies to local
governments, Chiang said.
</P>
<P>
The central government's budget plan for 2007 failed to pass in
the legislative session that ended Jan. 19 due to incessant
bickering between the ruling and opposition  parties over an
opposition Kuomintang (KMT) -drafted amendment bill on the
organization of the Central Election Commission (CEC) , according
to which CEC members would be recommended by political parties in
proportion to the number of their legislative seats.
</P>
<P>
The KMT legislative caucus insisted that the draft amendment to
the CEC Organic Law should be dealt with ahead of the central
government's 2007 budget plan during a proposed extra legislative
session, while the ruling Democratic Progressive Party caucus
disagreed.
