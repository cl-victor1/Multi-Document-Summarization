The global market value for botanical medicines is expected to
surpass US$26 billion in 2011, compared to a total of US$19
billion in 2006, staff at the Development Center for
Biotechnology (DCB) reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The center also estimated that while drugs for respiratory
diseases is currently the leading category in botanical medicine
-- with a share of 24 percent -- cancer drugs will become the
largest category by 2011, with an estimate share of 25 percent.
</P>
<P>
Citing a World Health Organization report, Hsu Ya-fen -- a DCB
analyst in charge of the Industry and Technology Intelligence
Services (ITIS) project initiated by the Ministry of Economic
Affairs -- noted that 45 percent of the global population have
already taken botanical or herbal medicines for health care or
disease treatment, representing an increased demand for the
medication.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, some reports indicated an annual increase of 6.6
percent in the market value of botanical medicine and the rate
could remain at that level at least through the period leading to
2011.
</P>
<P>
Hsu suggested that Taiwan has a long tradition in herbal medicine
production, and that Taiwan pharmaceutical companies should
utilize that existing advantage to boost their share of global
botanical medicine sales.
