E.U. URGED NOT TO LET 'ONE CHINA' BLOCK SUPPORT FOR TAIWAN'S WHO
BID

Brussels,  Jan.  18 (CNA) 01/19/07  12:42:13 (By P.C. Tang and

The European Union should not let its "one China" policy restrict
it from supporting Taiwan's bid to join the World Health
Organization (WHO) , the head of the Foundation of Medical
Professionals Alliance in Taiwan said here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Because of its "one China" policy, the E.U. has for long failed
to support Taiwan's efforts to join the world health body, said
Wu Shu-min, chairman of the non-profit foundation which has
played a leading role in pushing for Taiwan's WHO accession.
</P>
<P>
Wu is currently in Brussels to meet with media and medical
leaders in Belgium to drum up support for Taiwan's WHO bid.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a gathering attended by about 30 media members and
medical leaders, Wu noted that the E.U. has not supported
Taiwan's WHO bid and has just agreed to allow "significant
participation" by Taiwan in WHO-related activities, apparently
because of its "one China" policy.
</P>
<P>
Pointing out that both the United States and Japan have expressed
support for Taiwan's bid to join the World Health Assembly (WHA),
the WHO's top decision- making body, as an observer, while at the
same time maintaining their "one China" policies, Wu said he
doesn't have a clue why the E.U. has remained inactive on the
issue.
</P>
<P>
"It's a pity that while Taiwan has continued to be excluded when
the world needs esprit de corps in the battle against the H5N1
bird flu epidemic, the E.U. has only been talking about
'significant participation' for Taiwan," Wu said.
</P>
<P>
Wu added that over the past decade, Taiwan has limited itself to
only pursuing WHA observer status in an effort to avoid touching
a raw nerve in China over the sovereignty issue. "But even this
modest request by Taiwan has been rejected," he lamented.
</P>
<P>
Also speaking at the gathering was Taiwan's representative in
Belgium, Michael Ying-mao Kau, who said that Taiwan's bid for
access to the WHO is critical at present, pointing out that the
recent report of H5N1 cases in Japan underscores that public
health security is not only a challenge to Taiwan, it is also a
challenge to other countries around the world.
</P>
<P>
Wu and Lin Shih-chia, a foundation executive director, and Huang
Wei-feng, a former vice chairman of the Cabinet-level Council of
Mainland Affairs, are currently on a two-day visit in Brussels.
