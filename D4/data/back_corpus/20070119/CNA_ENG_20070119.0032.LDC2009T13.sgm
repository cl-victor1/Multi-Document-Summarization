Taipei,   Jan.  19  (CNA) 01/19/07  19:15:42 (By Y.F. Low)

The Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) expressed approval Friday for
China's relaxation of its control over Internet access to Taiwan
news Web sites.
</P>
<P>
According to MAC Vice Chairman Johnnason Liu, news Web sites run
by Taiwanese media such as the China Times and the United Daily
News, which were blocked by Chinese authorities in the past, are
now accessible in some areas of China, including Beijing and in
Dongguan, Guangdong Province.
</P>
<P>
Liu said the MAC welcomes the development and hopes Beijing will
remove its Internet control completely in the near future so that
all Internet users in China can obtain information about Taiwan
freely and get to know Taiwan better.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan  will  consider  restoring  a  permit  for  China's state-
controlled Xinhua News Agency and People's Daily to post
correspondents in Taiwan if Beijing responds positively to the
call, Liu said.
</P>
<P>
He said Taiwan encourages China to continue to make progress in
terms of press freedom and human rights protection and hopes the
Chinese people can truly enjoy freedom, democracy and human
rights.
</P>
<P>
In April 2005, the MAC suspended permits allowing the two media
outlets to post correspondents in Taiwan on the grounds that they
had repeatedly turned out "misleading reports" about Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
As a condition for resuming the permits, the MAC said China must
remove its blockade against the China Times' and the United Daily
News' Web sites.
