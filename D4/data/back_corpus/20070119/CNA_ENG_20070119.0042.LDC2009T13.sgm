The government's budget for 2007 remains tied up in the
legislature which recessed Friday in chaos as the opposition
Kuomintang (KMT) and the ruling Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) lawmakers squabble fiercely over a draft bill on the
organization of the Central Election Commission.
</P>
<P>
At the center of their arguments is the composition of the
Central Election Commission which according to the bill initiated
by the KMT should be made up by members recommended by political
parties in proportion to their legislative seats with the
stipulation that no single party could control more than two-
fifths of the seats on the 17-member commission.
</P>
<P>
However, the ruling party, which enjoys exclusive power to name
all members through the premier currently, opposed the new
formula and tried to stonewall the bill which is ready for the
third reading.
</P>
<P>
As Friday is the last day of the current session, the KMT which
controls the legislature with the help of its political ally the
People First Party motioned for a vote on the bill Friday in a
desperate attempt to push it through, prompting a group of DPP
lawmakers to occupy the podium and block the vote.
</P>
<P>
In response to the ruling party's filibuster, KMT lawmakers
refused to act on the government's general budget before the bill
on the election commission's organization is enacted.
</P>
<P>
KMT members even resolved to extend Friday's sitting until
midnight, claiming that they were ready to debate the budget
which is urgently needed by the DPP administration, should the
DPP stop blocking a vote on the election commission bill.
</P>
<P>
Instead of accepting the KMT's offer the ruling party asked for
an extra session to deal with the government's budget, denouncing
the KMT for what they claim amounts to holding hostage the
government's budget in pursuit of a partisan interest in
controlling the Central Election Commission.
