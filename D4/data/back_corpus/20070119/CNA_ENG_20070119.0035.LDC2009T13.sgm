PRESIDENT'S SIX DIPLOMATIC MISSIONS NOT SECRET: COURT
</HEADLINE>

Taipei  Jan.  19  (CNA) 01/19/07  19:44:43 (By Y.C. Jou)

Six diplomatic missions cited by the Presidential Office as
having used the controversial state affairs funds are not "state
secrets" as the law defines and are thus subject to partial
disclosure if President Chen Shui-bian fails to offer evidence
before Monday, the Taipei District Court ruled Friday.
</P>
<P>
The court said the documents in question will be made open to
court procedure next Tuesday. In its notice to the Presidential
Office, the court ruled that the six diplomatic projects are not
state secrets as defined by the Classified National Security
Information Protection Act.
</P>
<P>
The decision came after the Presidential Office, citing national
security reasons, twice since December rejected the court's
demand to provide documents related to the diplomatic missions.
The court said Friday that the information it previously
requested is not protected by the president's privilege and that
the Presidential Office cannot hide behind the Classified
National Security Information Protection Act.
</P>
<P>
The prosecution welcomed Friday's court decision, while the
defense said it is not final until Chen replies Monday. The
prosecutors earlier petitioned to the court for a warrant to
search the Presidential Office, but the request was dismissed.
</P>
<P>
The target of the disclosure is being commonly referred to by the
local media as "the three folders", which includes interrogation
records of the president being questioned by Prosecutor Chen Jui-
jen last August, as well as documents submitted by the president
to the prosecutor at that time.
</P>
<P>
The folders have been classified since, even after first lady Wu
Shu-jen and four close aides to the president were indicted on
embezzlement and forgery charges last November.
</P>
<P>
According to the Presidential Office, the folders contain secrets
relating to the six diplomatic missions and should not be
unveiled in the trial in order not to undermine national
interests and endanger secret agents. The prosecution, however,
argued that whether the six projects are really state secrets
needed clarification and should not be determined by the
Presidential Office itself.
</P>
<P>
The prosecution said what it requested is only procedural
information that can tell whether the six diplomatic projects
were really state secrets -- namely, whether all the procedures
involved conformed to the Classified National Security
Information Protection Act.
