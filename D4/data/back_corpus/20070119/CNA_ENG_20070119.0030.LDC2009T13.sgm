The Chinese Taipei women's softball team is scheduled to depart
Taiwan Saturday for China for intensive training to prepare for a
regional Olympic qualifier slated for Feb. 1-5, the Chinese
Taipei Amateur Softball Association reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The four-day training in Guangzhou will mainly feature several
competitions against the Chinese national softball team and a
Guangdong provincial softball team, said an association official.
</P>
<P>
If the Chinese Taipei softball team fares well in the qualifier
-- to be held in Tainan City, southern Taiwan -- softball will be
the first competition event in which Taiwan will field players in
the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing, the official said.
</P>
<P>
To prepare for the Olympics, the Chinese Taipei softball team has
been training since the spring of 2005 and the team's efforts
bore fruit when it took the silver medal in the Doha Asian Games
last year.
</P>
<P>
Olympic softball is played only by women, while men compete in
baseball, and the International Olympic Committee has voted to
remove softball from the program for the 2012 Olympics.
</P>
<P>
Eight teams will compete in the softball tournament in a two-
round competition. The eight teams will qualify through a series
of tournaments. China, as the host nation, is guaranteed
automatic entry, while the top four finishers in the 2006
Softball World Championships -- the United States, Japan,
Australia and Canada -- will also qualify for the Olympic
tournament.
</P>
<P>
In addition, there will be continental qualifying tournaments for
Europe/Africa, Pan-America, and Asia/Oceania, with the winners of
each tournament earning a spot in the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
Six national teams -- Chinese Taipei, North Korea, South Korea,
New Zealand, the Philippines and Singapore -- will compete in the
Asia/Oceania Olympic qualifying tournament, which will be the
first of the three regional Olympic qualifiers.
</P>
<P>
The Olympics will be held over a 10-day period from Aug. 12.
