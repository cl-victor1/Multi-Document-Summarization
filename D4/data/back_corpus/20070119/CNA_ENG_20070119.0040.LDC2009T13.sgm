Construction of a planned expressway between Suao Harbor and
Hualien city in eastern Taiwan is expected to cost over NT$100
billion (US$3.05 billion) , a 30 percent increase over original
estimates  due to rising prices for materials, government
authorities said Friday.
</P>
<P>
According to a spokesman for the Department of Railways and
Highways under the Ministry of Transportation and Communications
(MOTC) , following a new assessment by the department,
construction fees for the 114-kilometer highway are likely to
exceed NT$100 billion.

<P>
The construction project continues to meet fierce opposition from
environmentalists despite the fact that it was approved in Dec.
2002.
</P>
<P>
As construction has been delayed for more than three years, the
Environmental Protection Administration has asked the department
to provide it with the latest environmental impact evaluation in
addition to reports on its adverse effects on the cultural and
soil conservation fronts, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Since the project was approved,  the cost of construction
materials have risen by more than 30 percent, he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
In an effort to minimize grave public and expert concerns
regarding noise pollution and the environmental impact on
villages along the planned Suao- Hualien expressway,  the
department has adjusted the route of the highway to take into
account new urban development plans and geological structures, he
explained.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman dismissed concerns raised by many ecology-friendly
activists that fragile ecosystems will be affected because 90
percent of the planned expressway will pass through national
conservation areas at higher altitude, saying that the expressway
reaches its highest point at about 1,500 meters above sea level.
