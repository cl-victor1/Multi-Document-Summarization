Five Chinese fishermen who were rescued at sea and brought to
Taiwan after their boat sank off Hong Kong early this month were
escorted Friday to Taiwan's outlying island of Kinmen, where they
boarded a ferry to their homes in Zhangzhou, Fujian Province.
</P>
<P>
The five crewmen were escorted to Kinmen via air by Huang Kuo-
jui, a section chief of the quasi-official Straits Exchange
Foundation (SEF) and an immigration officer from Taichung Harbor
and were seen off on the ferry at Kinmen's Shuitou Port,
concluding an ordeal that began Jan. 3.

The Fujian-registered fishing boat Mindongyu 4020 capsized and
sank after being rammed by an unidentified vessel off Hong Kong's
southeast coast. All eight crew members fell overboard after the
mishap, but only five of them managed to cling to a life raft,
which drifted for more than 20 hours before the survivors were
rescued by a passing Vietnamese freighter.
</P>
<P>
The freighter brought the men to Taichung Harbor before heading
for Japan. The five then stayed in a Taichung Harbor dormitory
while the SEF made contact with the Chinese authorities to
arrange for their repatriation.
</P>
<P>
They hugged Huang and the Taichung immigration officer upon
departure at Shuitou and expressed their appreciation to the SEF
for its help and to the Buddhist Tzu Chi Compassionate Relief
Foundation for providing them with aid during their stay in
Taiwan.
