Washington,  Jan. 19 (CNA) 01/19/07  17:55:09 (By Jorge Liu and

<P>
China has been working to improve its relations with the United
States, Europe, Japan and other neighboring countries over the
past year, which has lowered the possibility of conflict across
the Taiwan Strait, the U.S. intelligence chief claimed Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Testifying before a hearing in the House of Representatives,
Director of National Intelligence John D. Negroponte noted that
Beijing made it a priority last year to develop positive
relations with the United States and at the same time tried to
strengthen its relations with other superpowers such as the
European Union and Russia.
</P>
<P>
In addition,  China's leaders also put great emphasis  on
developing friendships with neighboring countries to ensure
border peace and prevent containment by other superpowers,
Negroponte said.
</P>
<P>
He said Beijing has made significant progress in improving its
relations with Japan since the inauguration of Japanese Prime
Minister  Shinzo  Abe and has engaged  with many multilateral
organizations, including the Association of Southeast Asian
Nations.
</P>
<P>
All these developments lower the possibility of conflict between
China and Taiwan, he claimed.
</P>
<P>
However,  Negroponte  pointed  out  that  China's  military
modernization has been going on rapidly since 1999 and is not
going to stop even if the so-called "Taiwan question" is
resolved.
</P>
<P>
He said that in addition to developing  medium-range  and short-
range ballistic missiles, China is developing a long-range strike
system that is capable of attacking American frigates and naval
bases.
