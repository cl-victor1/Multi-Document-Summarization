U.S. OFFICIAL URGES E.U. NOT TO TILT MILITARY BALANCE WITH CHINA
</HEADLINE>

Washington,  June  1 (CNA) (By Oliver Lin and Sofia Wu)
</P>
<P>
U.S. Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs R. Nicholas Burns
has recently urged the European Union not to unduly affect in a
negative way the military balance between the United States and China,
particularly concerning the Taiwan Strait.
</P>
<P>
Burns made the call in a speech delivered at the Translatic Democracy
Network Conference held in Brussels May 26. The State Department
issued text of the speech Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
In his speech, Burns said that managing relationship with a rising
China and continuing to ensure stability and peace in East Asia is a
major American preoccupation.
</P>
<P>
Since the European Union announced that it was going to lift its arms
ban on China, imposed for human rights reasons just following the
Tiananmen Square Massacre in June 1989, Burns said, there has been a
very vigorous debate between the United States and the E.U. about
that.
</P>
<P>
The core of the American argument has been that Europe needs to
understand that not only did America have security commitments in
Europe over the last 60 years, it has the same commitments in Asia.
</P>
<P>
"We are the guarantor of stability in Asia. In the Taiwan Straits and
in the entire Asia Pacific region, through our treaty relationships
with Japan and South Korea, Australia, and our security commitments to
the Philippines and Thailand, an American naval and air presence in
Asia has been the single greatest factor. That has meant there has
been no major regional war in Asia since the 2nd World War. Certainly
no conflict that would directly pit the interests of the great powers
in Asia itself," Burns said.
</P>
<P>
Against this backdrop, Burns said, Europe had to und erstand how
important it was that Europe not unduly affect in a negative way the
military balance between China and the United States, particularly
concerning the Taiwan Straits as well as the wider responsibilities.
</P>
<P>
"We're very pleased now that the European Parliament has spoken out so
clearly on this arms sales issue. It's a difficult one. We understand
the motivations of the European Union, but we cannot accept that
Europe would move forward when we are alliance partners and we have
such profound security interests in East Asia itself.
