Mexico canceled its permission for President Chen Shui-bian's
plane to fly through its flight information region Thursday under
pressure from China, causing delay in the president's planned
transit stop in Los Angeles on his way back home after a visit to
Nicaragua, a Taiwan official said.

<P>
Liu Shih-fang, deputy secretary-general of the Presidential
Office, said Beijing pressured Mexico to do so because it was
unhappy with President Chen's successful visit in Nicaragua, a
move which she criticized as "shameful."
</P>
<P>
According to Liu, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs had asked the
United States and Nicaragua to help negotiate with the Mexican
government over the matter but to no avail.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the president's plane was forced to make a detour
around Mexican air space, adding four hours and 37 minutes to the
flight time to Los Angeles, Liu said.

Owing to the delay, the president has canceled his planned
attendance at a dinner reception hosted by the Taiwanese
expatriate community in Los Angeles as well as his scheduled
meetings with U.S. politicians  and academics there,  Liu said,
adding that the president's scheduled arrival in Taipei will also
be put off until the early morning of Jan. 13.
