LONG COURT HOURS MAY BE RISKY TO FIRST LADY'S HEALTH: LAWYER
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  Jan.  12 (CNA) 01/12/07  13:54:55 (By Deborah Kuo)

<P>
Long court hours may pose a risk to the health of first lady Wu
Shu-jen, who has been in poor health due to low blood pressure,
Wu's chief lawyer said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Lawyer Ku Li-hsiung, who represented Wu during her fourth
scheduled appearance in her embezzlement trial held at the Taipei
District Court Friday, quoted Wu's physicians as saying that
given the first lady's frail condition, sitting for extended
periods could pose a risk to her health.
</P>
<P>
Wu, who has been paralyzed from the waist down and confined to a
wheelchair since she was hit by a truck in 1985, did not appear
at court Friday as her lawyers had asked for sick leave.
</P>
<P>
Ku expressed disgruntlement at the prosecution's request for Wu's
medical records in order to better understand the first lady's
health condition, saying that the request infringes upon Wu's
privacy rights.
</P>
<P>
He told the presiding judge that he will have to assume full
responsibility if Wu's health condition worsens as a result of
long court appearances as requested by the prosecution.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile,   Prosecutor  Chang  Hsi-huai,  leading  six
government-appointed prosecutors,  expressed a different opinion
concerning Wu's third consecutive absence from a scheduled
appearance in court backed up only by a note from doctors from
National Taiwan University Hospital (NTUH) that only contained
information on the first lady's blood pressure readings and
temperature.
</P>
<P>
Chang said the information  in the doctor's note was not
sufficient to give the court a clear understanding of the first
lady's health condition.
</P>
<P>
Chang asked the panel of judges to request Wu's medical records
dating back to July 1, 2006 from NTUH so that the court can
determine a suitable time to schedule the first lady's next court
appearance.
</P>
<P>
Wu was indicted Nov. 3, 2006 on charges of embezzlement and
forgery as Taipei prosecutors had come to the conclusion that Wu
had used other people's invoices to claim reimbursements from the
special "state affairs fund" budgeted  for President  Chen Shui-
bian's discretionary use.
</P>
<P>
In her first court appearance on Dec. 15, Wu suffered a fainting
spell and had to be rushed to hospital for treatment. Prior to
being rushed to hospital, Wu entered a plea of not guilty on
charges that she and three former and incumbent aides of
President Chen Shui-bian had skimmed NT$14.8 million (US$450,000)
from the special "state affairs fund" budgeted for the
president's discretionary use.
</P>
<P>
The three other defendants -- former and present presidential
aides -- have been charged with embezzlement, forgery and perjury
in the case.
</P>
<P>
Wu has not appeared in court since her fainting spell, taking her
doctors' advice and missing her scheduled appearances on Dec. 22
and Dec. 29.
</P>
<P>
When Wu was indicted, prosecutors said President Chen could also
face trial on corruption charges after his term ends and he no
longer enjoys immunity as the head of state.
</P>
<P>
Chen has denied any wrongdoing and pledged to resign if his wife
is convicted on the embezzlement charges.
