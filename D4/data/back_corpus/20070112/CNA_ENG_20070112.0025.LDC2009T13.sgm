Taiwan Foreign Affairs Minister James Huang and his Nicaraguan

The MOU was the first document signed between Nicaragua and a
foreign government since Ortega's inauguration a day earlier.

The MOU seeks to promote direct foreign investment in high-tech

health issues; and the upgrading of the competitive edge of
Nicaraguan products at home and overseas.

Santos will lead a high-level delegation to Taiwan in three
months, during which period the details of the cooperation
agreement will be finalized, Huang said.

Nicaragua.
