<P>
The Council of Hakka Affairs (CHA) will begin accepting
applications for publishing grants,
</P>
<P>
subsidizing winning proposals with awards of up to NT$500,000, an
official said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The grant was created to encourage the development of outstanding
publications that promote Hakka culture, the official said,
adding that the scope for subsidies this year include academic,
professional, standard printing, audio, video and Internet
publications, as well as Hakka language teaching materials for
the Hakka major and instructors' teaching materials.
</P>
<P>
Every institution can apply for the grants -- whether a school,
university or publishing organization with legal registration,
academic group, social group or individuals. The application
deadline is Jan. 30.
</P>
<P>
The highest award for a single publication or Hakka language
teaching materials is NT$200,000. The highest award for Hakka
language teaching materials and serial publications -- such as
community newspapers, journals and magazines -- is NT$500,000.
</P>
<P>
Both subsidy amounts cannot be higher than 70 percent of the
publication's cost. If the confirmed total expenditure is lower
than the amount disclosed in the application -- thus making the
award amount higher than 70 percent of the total publication's
cost -- or the publication quantity and costs do not follow the
approved plans, the subsidy amount will be reduced accordingly.
