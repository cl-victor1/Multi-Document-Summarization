Taipei, Jan. 12 (CNA) 01/12/07  19:50:22 (By Lilian Wu)

The Cabinet-level Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) contacted the
Taiwan Affairs Office (TAO) under China's State Council Friday,
requesting assistance in repatriating a Taiwan business tycoon
and his wife for their involvement in a series of financial
scandals.
</P>
<P>
MAC Vice Chairman Liu Teh-hsun said that he called related
agencies of the TAO, passing them reports on Asia Pacific Group
founder Wang You-theng, who fled to China late last month with
his wife, China Rebar Co. Chairwoman Wang Shih-ying.
</P>
<P>
The MAC told the China side that the Wangs' stay in China gives
Taiwan's public "a bad impression of China," Liu said, adding
that it seems to him that Chinese officials also felt that it
will be unfavorable to them with their stay in China."
</P>
<P>
"The TAO will probably explain its stance on the case next week,"
Liu said.
</P>
<P>
The scandals surrounding Wang came to light last week after the
group's China Rebar Co. and Chia Hsin Food &amp; Synthetic Fiber
Co. filed for bankruptcy protection due to insolvency, triggering
a run on The Chinese Bank, another Rebar affiliate.
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors have questioned and barred more than 40 group
executives, among them Wang family members, from leaving the
country following a search of Rebar's headquarters and other
subsidiary offices and the seizure of key evidence.
</P>
<P>
The MAC also called the TAO for news about Lee Han-yang, a driver
of an armored truck for Group 4 Securicor, a private security
company. Lee reportedly was nabbed in Kunming, southwestern China
after making away with NT$56 million (US$1.72 million) in Taipei
earlier this month.
