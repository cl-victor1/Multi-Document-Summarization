WARNING ON OTC DRUG USAGE SHOULD BE PLACED IN PROMINENT PLACE:

Taipei,  Jan. 12 (CNA) 01/12/07  18:04:21 (By Lilian Wu)

The Department of Health (DOH) said Friday that it will instruct
a pharmaceutical company to make improvements after it was found
that the company had failed to print a usage warning on a
prominent part of the package.
</P>
<P>
Liu  Li-ling,  deputy  director  of the DOH's  Bureau  of
Pharmaceutical Affairs, said the DOH would give a three-month
grace period for the manufacturers to make the necessary
improvement.
</P>
<P>
She noted that the DOH has agreed that pharmaceutical companies
can print information on the drug in the interior of the package
if they are non- prescription drugs.
</P>
<P>
But since it is not easy for consumers to see the information,
the DOH will tell the manufacturer to improve the situation, she
said.
</P>
<P>
Liu was responding to Legislator Hsieh Hsin-ni of the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party who said a cold medicine sold by a
noted manufacturer has information and a warning concerning
product use printed on the inside of the package.
</P>
<P>
Unless consumers tear open the package, they cannot see the
instructions, she said.
</P>
<P>
The warning reads that unless otherwise instructed by a doctor,
people with heart disease, high blood pressure, diabetes or who
have taken MAOI -- an anti- depressant -- within the last two
weeks should not use the drugs, Hsieh said, adding that MAOI has
no Chinese translation or explanation.
</P>
<P>
She further claimed that a promotional ad for the cold medicine
could mislead some readers to think it is a vitamin, and noted
that all the information printed on the outside of the package
boasts only of the product's merits.
</P>
<P>
Wu Cheng-hsueh, a member of a consumer protection committee under
the Executive Yuan, also said it is unreasonable to put the
warning and side-effects on the interior of the package, adding
that safety should be the prime concern.
