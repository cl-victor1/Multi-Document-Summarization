Ma Ying-jeou,  the main opposition Kuomintang's (KMT's) candidate
for the 2008 presidential election, said Thursday that he
respects Legislative  Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng's decision to
continue serving at the legislature despite his disappointment
about Wang's rejection of his offer to serve as his running mate.

<P>
Ma made the remarks after the two met earlier the same day to
discuss the issue of the party's presidential ticket.

<P>
The development means that a Ma-Wang ticket is out of the
question despite the fact that it was much hoped within the KMT
that the two men could pair up to boost the party's chances of
victory in next year's presidential election, analysts said.
