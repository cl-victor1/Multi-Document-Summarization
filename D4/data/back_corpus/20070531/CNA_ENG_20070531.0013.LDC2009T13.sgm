The government will set up a special project office in July to
promote globalization of the local medical service sector, a
senior official said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The decision was reached at a meeting of the Executive Yuan's
finance and economics task force held a day earlier, the official
said, adding that the special project office will be jointly
managed by the Department of Health (DOH) and the Council for
Economic Planning and Development (CEPD).
</P>
<P>
In the initial stage, the official said, the office will focus on
promoting globalization of several medical areas in which Taiwan
enjoys a competitive edge, such as liver transplant, craniofacial
surgery, cardiovascular surgery, artificial insemination and
joint replacement surgery.
</P>
<P>
During the first three years from 2007 through 2009, the official
said, the special project office will assist 10 selected
hospitals to provide medical and health-care services to patients
from abroad.
</P>
<P>
According to a CEPD estimate, the medical service globalization
project will create NT$7 billion (US$212 million) worth of
business, inspire an additional NT$6.8 billion in private
investment, and create 1,500 jobs over three years.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at Wednesday's  special task force meeting,  CEPD
Chairwoman Ho Mei- yueh said that by 2015, the medical service
globalization project will generate about NT$50 billion in
business annually, accounting for 0.5 percent of the gross
domestic product (GDP) , and provide medical services to 800,000
foreign patients per year.
</P>
<P>
Intangible  benefits  will include upgrading  the country's
international image,  facilitating medical diplomacy with such
countries as Vietnam and Mongolia, as well as stimulating
development in relevant industries and services, Ho said.
</P>
<P>
Analyzing Taiwan's competitive edge in the global medical service
and health care market, Tsai Su-ling, a DOH counselor, said
Taiwan outpaces major forerunners in this field, including India,
Thailand, Malaysia and South Korea, in terms of service quality,
adding that Taiwan's service charges are very reasonable and even
cheaper.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Tsai said, Taiwan can offer very convenient and highly
efficient medical services, and local medical institutions and
travel service agents are keenly interested in getting into this
market.
</P>
<P>
Also, because of language and cultural factors, Tsai said, Taiwan
also stands a good chance of attracting patients of Chinese
descent, particularly white-collar Chinese citizens.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Tsai also outlined several disadvantages that
Taiwan needs to overcome, including inadequate English-speaking
skills of medical workers, a lack of platforms for the medical
sector to cooperate with other service industries, and legal
restrictions.
</P>
<P>
Generally speaking, Tsai said, local medical institutions remain
inexperienced in packaging and marketing their professional
services and in associating or collaborating with other service
sectors. "More efforts must be devoted to this," she added.
</P>
<P>
Noting that globalized medical services cover two areas, namely
tourism plus health care and special medical treatment, Tsai said
Taiwan will focus on tapping the latter category, with Southeast
Asian and ethnic Chinese people as the main service targets.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Tsai said, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has
instructed its overseas offices to include medical service on the
list of items for short-term stay visa eligibility. Chinese
patients can be issued special visas on a case- by-case basis in
accordance with existing regulations, she said, adding that over
the long run, the law must be revised to facilitate entry of
white-collar Chinese people for medical treatment.
</P>
<P>
Tsai further said the plan to attract foreign patients is not
expected to have a "squeeze effect" on services for local
citizens since only 70 percent of the country's 90,000-plus
hospital beds are in use at one time, and foreign patients are
only expected to occupy about 5 percent of all hospital beds at
any one time.
