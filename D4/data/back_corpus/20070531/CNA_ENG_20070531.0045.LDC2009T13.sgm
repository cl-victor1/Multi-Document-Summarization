Academia Sinica President Chi-huey Wong has won the 2008 F.A.
Cotton Medal for Excellence in Chemical Research, a renowned
award named after one of the greatest chemists of the 20th
Century, according to a press release issued Thursday by the
institution.

<P>
Wong will attend the formal award ceremony -- to be held next
spring at Texas A&amp;M University (TAMU) -- and give a speech at
the event, according to the press release.

Wong went into chemistry  in the 1970s,  when he was an
undergraduate at National Taiwan University. He received a
doctoral degree in chemistry from Massachusetts Institute of
Technology in 1982 and then joined the faculty of TAMU, where he
became a professor in 1987.

Wong returned to Taiwan in 2003 to take the position of director
of the Genomic Research Center at Academia Sinica. Late last
year, he succeeded Lee Yuan-tseh as the head of Academia Sinica,
Taiwan's top research institution.

Frank Albert Cotton (1930V2007) -- the former chair of the W.T.
Doherty-Welch Foundation and a Distinguished Professor of
Chemistry at TAMU -- is widely recognized for his research into
the chemistry of transition metals.

Cotton authored more than 1,600 scientific papers and received 29
honorary doctorates and important awards such as the U.S.
National Medal of Science, the Wolf Prize and the Priestley
Medal, as well as the American Chemical Society's highest
recognition.

The F.A. Cotton Medal was initiated by the American Chemical
Society and TAMU in 1995. Every year, one chemist with
distinguished achievements is selected by the board to receive
the award.
