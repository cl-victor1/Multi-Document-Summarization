PRC SOVEREIGNTY CLAIM VIOLATES TAIWAN RELATIONS ACT: PRESIDENT
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taipei, May 30 (CNA) 05/31/07  10:03:11 (By Sofia Wu)
</P>
<P>
President Chen Shui-bian said Wednesday that China's unilateral
assertion that the People's Republic of China includes Taiwan is
non-factual and violates provisions of the U.S. legislation known
as the Taiwan Relations Act (TRA) of 1979.
</P>
<P>
Chen made the remarks while receiving a delegation organized by
the U.S. Congressional Black Caucus, an organization representing
African-American members of the U.S. Congress.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the TRA is the U.S. law regulating U.S. engagements
with Taiwan in the absence of formal diplomatic ties, Chen said
some of China's actions are in stark violation of TRA
stipulations.
</P>
<P>
For instance, China has repeatedly blocked Taiwan's applications
for representation in the World Health Organization (WHO), the
World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) and the United Nations
on the grounds that Taiwan does not have statehood.
</P>
<P>
Such a claim runs counter to the TRA spirit, Chen said, adding
that Article 4 of the TRA reads that whenever the laws of the
United States refer to foreign countries, nations, states or
governments, such terms shall include and such laws shall apply
with such respect to Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
The article also stipulates that none of the TRA provisions
should be employed as a basis to deny or squeeze Taiwan's access
or accession to international organizations, Chen said.
</P>
<P>
Since the TRA treats Taiwan as or equivalent to a sovereign
country, Chen said China's boycott of and obstruction to Taiwan's
WHO and U.N. bids completely defy the spirit and principles of
the TRA.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he went on, China's claim at recent OIE and WHO annual
meetings that the PRC includes Taiwan is a lie with no factual
backing and completely unacceptable to the Taiwan people.
</P>
<P>
"None of Taiwan's citizens dare to say Taiwan is part of the PRC,
" Chen said, adding that the PRC has never ruled Taiwan for a
single day.
</P>
<P>
In the past, he said, China has just said that both sides of the
Taiwan Strait are part of China.
</P>
<P>
As Taiwan's president and head of state, Chen said he is
obligated to defend Taiwan's national dignity and safety. "I must
rebut and clarify any of China's specious claims of jurisdiction
or sovereignty over Taiwan, " Chen said, adding that he hopes the
international community will pay heed to his appeal.
</P>
<P>
According to Article 2 of the TRA, Chen went on, the U.S.
government's concern for global human rights conditions should
include those of the Taiwan people and the U.S. government should
consider any effort to determine Taiwan's future by other than
peaceful means a threat to the peace and security of the region
and of grave concern to the U.S.
