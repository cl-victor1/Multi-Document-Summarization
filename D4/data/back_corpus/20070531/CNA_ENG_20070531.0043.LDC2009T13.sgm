AMCHAM MIGHT HAVE INTERFERED IN TAIWAN'S INTERNAL AFFAIRS: CEPD
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taipei,  May 31 (CNA) 05/31/07  22:06:32 (By Deborah Kuo)

Officials from the Council for Economic Planning and Development
(CEPD) said Thursday that the American Chamber of Commerce
(AmCham) in Taipei might have interfered with Taiwan's internal
affairs by blasting the government in its 2007 Taiwan White
Paper.
</P>
<P>
Responding to the just-released  Taiwan White Paper,  CEPD
officials admitted that problems such as "inconsistent
enforcement of regulations and inadequate governmental
transparency" that the White Paper criticized might well be true,
but said its urging for direct cross-Taiwan Strait transport
links -- which is not a matter the government can control -- made
CEPD officials feel that AmCham is trying to back-seat drive in
terms of Taiwan's own business.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a news conference unveiling the 2007 AmCham Taiwan
White Paper, AmCham Executive Director Richard Vuylsteke warned
that Taiwan's economy will "get into a big trouble" next year if
the government still refuses to deregulate cross-strait exchanges
and remove trade barriers, and said that he sees neither of the
two candidates the ruling and opposition parties might field for
the 2008 presidential election as determined to turn Taiwan's
sagging economy around.
</P>
<P>
Regarding direct cross-strait transport links, the White Paper
says that "nothing can be said that hasn't been said repeatedly
before about how the failure to act on this issue has isolated,
constrained and damaged Taiwan's economy."
</P>
<P>
"So on cross-strait links, the AmCham message to the Taiwan
government remains clear and unequivocal: Just do it!"
</P>
<P>
The White Paper stresses Taiwan's regulatory morass and said that
AmCham's complaints  fall into several  categories,  including
inadequate transparency, violation of due process,  legislator
interference  on  behalf  of  private interests,  insufficient
consultation with industry players, inconsistent interpretations
and enforcement, and regulations inconsistent with international
best practices.
</P>
<P>
Describing the 2007 AmCham Taiwan White Paper as a record of a
"health checkup for the Taiwan tiger, " AmCham President Jane
Hwang said in a press conference that AmCham is concerned that
Taiwan appears to be falling behind the other "aging" Asian
tigers -- Hong Kong, Singapore and South Korea -- in economic
competitiveness, while other "new" Asian tigers, including China,
India and Vietnam, are rapidly gaining strength.
</P>
<P>
Hwang said she will be leading  an AmCham delegation  to
Washington, D.C. in 10 days to discuss the 2007 AmCham Taiwan
White Paper with American officials and elected representatives
in a projected 30 meetings with the goal of encouraging stronger
trade and business links between the United States and Taiwan.
