The state-run CPC Corp., Taiwan announced Thursday that domestic
prices of liquefied natural gas (LNG) have been raised by 2.99
percent on average.
</P>
<P>
The price hike was attributed to LNG price increases in the
international market, CPC officials explained, noting that the
cost of LNG imports stood at NT$12.8 (US$0.4) per cubic meter in
May, up from the average level of NT$11.3 per cubic meter in the
first four months of this year.

<P>
LNG users, including local gas suppliers and those in the
industrial, power generation and cogeneration sectors, will all
be affected by the price hike, the CPC said.
</P>

Under the adjustment, the price of LNG for the industrial sector
(combined with locally-produced and imported natural gas) has
been increased to NT$13.8279 per cubic meter from NT$13.4272,
while that of imported industrial LNG has been increased to
NT$15.3816 from NT$14.9359.

<P>
In terms of LNG for supply companies in cities and towns, the
price of the combined gas has been increased to NT$12.89 per
cubic meter from NT$12.51, while that of imported LNG has been
increased to NT$14.2741 from NT$13.8605.

The price of combined LNG for power cogeneration has been hiked
to NT$12.8323 per cubic meter, while that of imported LNG for use
in the sector has been increased to NT$14.2741.

The price of imported LNG for power generation in winter has been
hiked to NT$11.85 per cubic meter, while that of imported LNG for
power generation in summer has been hiked to NT$13.825.
