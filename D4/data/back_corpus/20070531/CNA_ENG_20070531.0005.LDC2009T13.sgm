DPP CAUCUS OPPOSES EASING REGULATIONS ON INVESTING IN CHINA
</HEADLINE>

Taipei, May 30 (CNA) 05/31/07  10:03:56 (By Lilian Wu)

<P>
The legislative caucus of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) claimed Wednesday that easing regulations on high-tech
industry investment in China will cut Taiwan's economic lifeline.
</P>
<P>
The DPP caucus made the remarks one day before a legislative
committee was scheduled to review a draft amendment to a major
law governing exchanges between Taiwan and China, which was
initiated by opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Legislator Lee Chih-chu.
</P>
<P>
DPP Legislator Wang Hsin-nan said the KMT is trying to amend the
Statute for Relations Between the People of Taiwan Area and the
People of Mainland Area so that Taiwan's high-tech industry --
the country's golden goose -- will be able to invest in China.
</P>
<P>
He claimed that once the amendment clears the legislature, around
60,000 workers for 13 wafer foundries and packaging and testing
manufacturers, which recorded a combined production value of
NT$1.06 trillion (US$32.12 billion) in 2006, 40,000 workers in
the high-end flat panel display industry, which registered a
production value of NT$1.22 trillion, and 17,000 workers in two
naphtha crackers, which have registered a production value of
NT$150 billion, will "immediately lose their jobs."
</P>
<P>
At least 1 million workers in related upstream and downstream
industries will be affected, he claimed.
</P>
<P>
DPP Legislator Lai Chin-teh said that as of the end of April,
Taiwan's investment in China had reached US$57.5 billion and that
China has accounted for 55.4 percent of Taiwan's outbound
investment. If only counting the years between 2002 and 2006, the
ratio was as high as 62.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
Lee expressed the hope for rational discussion in Thursday's
legislative committee meeting, saying that the amendment is not
aimed at cutting Taiwan's economic lifeline. Instead, she said,
it is "considering the division of labor on both sides of the
Taiwan Strait for the sake of their future development of Taiwan
high-tech companies."
</P>
<P>
She said that Taiwan's high-tech industry is short of 22,000
workers every year and predicted that the shortage could climb to
49,000 every year in the future. Additional investment in China
would not lead to job losses, she claimed.
</P>
<P>
Noting that leading high-tech manufacturers from other countries
have already invested in China, she said Taiwan should not be
excluded from this cluster market.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the amendment stipulates that Taiwan can only invest
in sectors where China has been able to mass produce, and there
is "no question of technology being leaked out," she claimed.
