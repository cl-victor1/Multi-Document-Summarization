<P>
Of a sample batch of 50 Chinese medicines available in Taiwan, 14
percent was adulterated with Western medicine, while 2.2 percent
contained heavy metals, Consumers' Foundation Chairman Cheng Jen-
hung said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Cheng said the foundation was commissioned to do tests on 50
samples of Chinese medicine in February and March and found that
seven of the samples were adulterated with Western medicine.
</P>
<P>
Examination of another 45 samples showed that one contained more
than 3,000 ppm of mercury, or 30 times the level allowed by
Department of Health regulations, which state that the level of
heavy metal contained in Chinese medicine should not exceed 100
ppm.
</P>
<P>
Cheng pointed out that long-term consumption of heavy metals can
lead to chronic poisoning.
</P>
<P>
He urged consumers not to buy Chinese medicine of unclear
provenance, not to trust Chinese medicine as an "elixir" and not
to take Chinese medicine that makers claim have "speedy
miraculous effects."
</P>
<P>
Consumers should also make sure that those who prescribe their
Chinese medicine are qualified to do so, he added.
