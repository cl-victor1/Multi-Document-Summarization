The Center for Disease Control (CDC) on Thursday listed the
deadly H5N1 influenza as a "category  1" communicable disease
under the Communicable Disease Control Act (CDCA).
</P>
<P>
The avian H5N1 flu was previously listed as a "category 4"
communicable disease. With the revision, anyone who appears to be
infected by some unknown acute respiratory disease and displays
symptoms like fever and labored breathing may be subject to
mandatory quarantine if they are categorized  as a "suspected
case" by hospitals, Chiu Chan-hsien, head of the CDC fourth
division, said.
</P>
<P>
Chiu explained that it is widely believed that if the H5N1 flu
develops into a type of communicable disease via human-to-human
transmission, a major epidemic is unavoidable.
</P>
<P>
Against this backdrop, the CDC has acted to designate the flu as
the top health threat in the country to facilitate  relevant
authorities' efforts to adopt efficient and strict measures
against a possible outbreak, Chiu added.
</P>
<P>
Other diseases listed in "category 1" by the CDC include cholera,
yellow fever, the bubonic plague, rabies, Ebola hemorrhagic
fever, anthrax and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS).
</P>
<P>
According to the most recent World Health Organization report on
H5N1 cases, a total of 308 people have been infected with the
H5N1 influenza virus to date, 186 of whom have died.
</P>
<P>
By country, 79 H5N1 cases have been reported in Indonesia, with
77 deaths, making it the most seriously affected area in the
world, followed by Vietnam, which has reported 93 cases, with 42
deaths, and Egypt, which has reported 34 cases, with 14 deaths.
