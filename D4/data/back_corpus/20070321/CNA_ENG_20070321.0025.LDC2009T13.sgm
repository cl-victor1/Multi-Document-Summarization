Northern Keelung city police officials announced Wednesday that
they had smashed two human trafficking rings and arrested 51
suspects after a four-month tracking.

According to the Keelung police authorities, 35 Indonesian women
who had been forced into prostitution or illegal work were
rescued in the operation.

The women were lured by a brokerage group in their country under
the pretext of providing them with jobs in Taiwan. Each of them
were sold for between NT$180,000 and NT$250,000 to two human
trafficking rings in the central Taichung area, Keelung police
said.

The results  of the initial investigation  found that the
Indonesian women entered Taiwan on marriages of convenience and
their passports were detained by the traffickers, who forced them
to sign unlawful contracts to work illegally in Taiwan. The women
told Keelung police that they were forced to work as many as 18
hours a day.

The 51 Taiwanese suspects were turned over to the Keelung
Prosecutor's Office on charges of hindering personal freedom and
for further investigation, while the Keelung police have
contacted the Indonesian police authorities to discuss issues
related to the repatriation of the women.
