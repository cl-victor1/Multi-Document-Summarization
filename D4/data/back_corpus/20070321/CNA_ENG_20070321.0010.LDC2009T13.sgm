The three surviving members of a group of four mountaineers
stranded on Mount Nanhu since last week due to bad weather
conditions were helicoptered Wednesday to Fengyuan in central
Taichung County for treatment.
</P>
<P>
The body of the fourth mountaineer, Lai Shan-chieh, 48, who died
when temperatures in the area suddenly dropped during the group's
attempt to scale Mount Nanhu and the Central Range Point, was
transported along with the three survivors to Fengyuan Hospital.
</P>
<P>
Ting Ching-chun, 47, and Chou Mei-chu, 37, were suffering from
hypothermia and altitude sickness. Ting was also reportedly
suffering from snow blindness, or temporary loss of vision due to
exposure to bright sunlight. The fourth climber, Ho Hsin-yen, 38,
was only experiencing fatigue.
</P>
<P>
A seven-member rescue team from a detachment of the Taichung
County Fire Department set off from Lishan Tuesday after
receiving an emergency call from a climber who passed a mountain
lodge in Nanhu early Tuesday morning where Ting, Chou and Ho were
awaiting medical assistance.
</P>
<P>
The fire department requested a helicopter for the rescue mission
Tuesday after the rescue team set off. The helicopter, however,
failed on three occasions to reach the lodge due to bad weather
conditions.
</P>
<P>
The four mountaineers embarked on their mountain-climbing trip
March 17 from the Siyuan Entrance located on the border of Yilan
County and Taichung County. They had planned to spend seven days
scaling the 3,740-meter Mount Nanhu, which is the fourth highest
mountain in Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
The team encountered heavy snowfall on the second day of their
climb. Lai was found unconscious in the morning of the third day
and later died of hypothermia.
