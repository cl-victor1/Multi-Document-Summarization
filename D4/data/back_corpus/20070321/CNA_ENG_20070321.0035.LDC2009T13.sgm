Taipei,  March 21 (CNA) 03/21/07  20:05:38 (By Lilian Wu)

The Council for Economic Planning and Development (CEPD) said
Wednesday that in view of the huge potential of medical tourism,
its promotion is now one of the major policies of the government.
</P>
<P>
Officials from the nation's highest economic planning agency also
said that the government will target such fields as hepatitis,
dental and craneofacial reconstruction surgery, in which Taiwan
excels, to promote medical tourism.
</P>
<P>
Taking a cue from other countries, officials said that it will be
government policy to upgrade Taiwan's image of offering superb
medical care and to strengthen local medical service industry.
</P>
<P>
They noted that Taiwan's  record in hepatitis  and dental
treatment, craneofacial surgery and physical checkups is on par
with other industrialized countries.
</P>
<P>
This, coupled with Taiwan's edge in prices, will be advantageous
to developing a medical tourism sector, they said.
</P>
<P>
But they also voiced concerns that Taiwan has insufficient
language and marketing talent, suggesting that the Department of
Health help nurture professionals in various fields, strengthen
Internet marketing and deregulation.
</P>
<P>
They noted that other countries are jumping on the bandwagon of
medical tourism with tangible results.
</P>
<P>
Taking Thailand as an example, they noted that it benefits from
the stringent approach adopted by the United States in the
issuing of visas to foreigners after the 911 terrorist attacks in
2001.
</P>
<P>
Thailand reported that 730,000 foreign nationals visited the
country in 2003 for medical tourism, bringing in US$488 million
for the country.
</P>
<P>
Singapore  also  attracts  white-collar  professionals  from
Indonesia and Malaysia seeking anti-aging treatments, cosmetic
surgery and cheap physical checkups. It is estimated that
Singapore welcomed 400,000 foreign patients in 2005, and the
number is expected to reach half of a million visitors, with
related revenues of US$1.5 billion this year. Those revenues
could reach US$3 billion by 2012, they said.
</P>
<P>
India, because of historical factors, has been the favorite
destination for tourism and medical care among Britons. India
estimated in 2005 that revenues related to the country's medical
tourism sector will reach US$2 billion in 2012.
