NO INSTRUCTION TO PROMOTE U.S. `CROSS-STRAIT DUAL RECOGNITION':
WU

Taipei,  March 21 (CNA) 03/21/07  19:38:27 (By Luis Huang)

Taiwan's representative-designate to the United States, Joseph
Wu, said Wednesday that he has not received any government
instruction that promoting "dual recognition" of the two sides of
the Taiwan Strait by the United States will be a top priority of
his diplomatic work.
</P>
<P>
Wu, who currently serves as chairman of the Cabinet-level
Mainland Affairs Council, the top agency in charge of drafting
Taiwan's China policy, made the remarks while fielding questions
from lawmakers of the opposition Kuomintang (KMT) at a committee
session of the Legislative Yuan.

<P>
Referring to a recent proposal by former senior presidential
advisor Wu Li-pei that the government should go all out to push
for the U.S. to forge diplomatic relations with Taiwan by
adopting a "dual recognition" strategy, KMT legislators Ting
Shou-chung and Wu Yu-sheng asked Wu whether or not his strategic
thoughts over Taiwan will be affected by Wu Li-pei, who is his
uncle, and whether he can promise not to promote the so called
"dual recognition" after assuming his new post in the U.S.
</P>
<P>
In response, Wu said it was his uncle's individual proposal, but
added that upgrading Taiwan's relations with the U.S. and other
nations is a common goal toward which all citizens are working.
</P>
<P>
As for Ting's doubt that the former presidential advisor is
advocating establishing diplomatic ties with the U.S. under the
name of "Taiwan, " Wu said that "our nation's official title is
Republic of China according to the Constitution."
</P>
<P>
Asked whether he will persuade the U.S. government to promote the
establishment of a military mutual-trust mechanism across the
Taiwan Strait, Wu said that if cross-strait military
confrontation continues to escalate in the future, it will not be
in the interest of the two sides of the Taiwan Strait and United
States, so he will do his utmost in this regard.
