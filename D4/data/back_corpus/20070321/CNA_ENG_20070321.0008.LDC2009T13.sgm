Washington,  March 20 (CNA) 03/21/07  12:36:17 (By Chiehyu Lin

The U.S. State Department, in its first official comment on the
replacement of Taiwan's representative in Washington, D.C., said
Tuesday that the United States looks forward to continued close,
beneficial ties with the people of Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
State Department spokesman Sean McCormack made the remarks during
a routine press conference in which he was asked about his view
on Taiwan's latest decision to appoint Mainland Affairs Council
Chairman Joseph Wu to replace David Ta-wei Lee as the head of its
mission in the United States.
</P>
<P>
Wu, who is widely seen as having a very close relationship with
President Chen Shui-bian, will be the first political appointee
from the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) to be posted
in the U.S. capital.
</P>
<P>
Asked whether the personnel reshuffle will make U.S.-Taiwan
dialogue easier, McCormack responded by saying that "we look
forward to continued close, beneficial relations with the people
of Taiwan."
</P>
<P>
During the press conference, McCormack was also asked about his
view on the DPP administration's plan to promote a bill that
would elevate a local Taiwan dialect to the level of official
language, currently being Mandarin, that is also spoken in China.
</P>
<P>
In response, McCormack said: "We have seen reports that the
Taiwan Cabinet is considering a draft law that would confer equal
status on Mandarin, the Taiwanese dialect, the Hakka dialect, and
several aboriginal languages in use on the island. We have no
further information at this time."
