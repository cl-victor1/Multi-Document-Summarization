DPP CHAIRMAN SUPPORTS PRESERVATION OF SANITARIUM
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  March  21 (CNA) 03/21/07  19:40:34 (By Y.C. Jou)

The chairman of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party, Yu Shyi-
kun Wednesday threw his support behind a plan to better preserve
the 77-year-old Losheng Sanatorium, which is scheduled to be
demolished in mid-April to make way for a Taipei Metro
construction project.
</P>
<P>
Yu was responding to a petition by several groups which have
begun visiting presidential aspirants to demand their backing for
the proposal that would preserve 90 percent of the current four-
hectare site.
</P>
<P>
Yu said he would seek to discuss the matter with the Executive
Yuan in the near future.
</P>
<P>
According to the Cultural Heritage Preservation Act amended under
my premiership, the central government has the power to designate
historical sites if local governments fail to do so, Yu said.
</P>
<P>
Preservationist groups have recently appealed to Premier Su
Tseng-chang and protested against his inaction.
</P>
<P>
Su said the decision to opt for a plan to dismantle nearly 60
percent of the leprosarium lay with the Taipei City's Department
of Rapid Transit Systems (DORTS) and the Taipei County
Government, while the preservationist groups argued that under
the amended Cultural Heritage Preservation Act the Cabinet- level
Council for Cultural Affairs (CCA) holds the key to saving the
sanatorium.
</P>
<P>
The groups demanded that the CCA temporarily designate the
sanatorium  a historical  site,  so to allow a half-year for
reconsideration of the 90 percent preservation plan, which was
proposed by the CCA itself but has since been rejected by the
DORTS.
</P>
<P>
Lobbying groups, including the Losheng Self-Help Organization,
Losheng Youth Alliance, Taiwan Association for Human Rights, and
Legal Aid Foundation, welcomed Yu's Wednesday response.
</P>
<P>
The leprosarium was built in 1930 by Japanese colonizers to treat
in segregation patients with Hansen's disease, and the Kuomintang
regime in its early years in Taiwan inherited the policy. In
later years, patients were later allowed to leave the sanitarium,
but many who lived in chronic isolation and faced discrimination
had little choice but to stay, and have long since grown
accustomed to the settings.
</P>
<P>
40-odd elderly patients still live in the compound and resist the
government's plan to relocate them to a nearby high-rise
hospital.
</P>
<P>
Preservationists have been advocating for the patients' right to
stay and say that as the only leper colony in Taiwan, and one of
a few still remaining around the world, the institution provides
living testimony to past indignities endured by the patients and
is thus of great historical and cultural value.
