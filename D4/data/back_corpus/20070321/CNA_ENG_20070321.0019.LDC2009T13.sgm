LABOR COUNCIL PROPOSES 11-PERCENT HIKE IN MINIMUM WAGE
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  March 21 (CNA) 03/21/07  16:35:17 (By Deborah Kuo)
</P>
<P>
The Council of Labor Affairs (CLA) has decided to review the
country's minimum wage between April and May, with the target of
raising the minimum wage to about 40 percent of Taiwan's current
salary average, which would represent a hike of 11 percent, CLA
Chairman Lee Ying-yuan said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Fielding questions at the Legislative Yuan, Lee said that at
present, the minimum wage is NT$15,840 (US$480) per month --
which translates into NT$528 per day or NT$66 per hour -- a
figure that has remained unaltered for a decade.
</P>
<P>
Lee said that if the minimum wage rate were to be hiked to reach
40 percent of the salary average, which is NT$44,107 per month,
the new minimum wage rate would be around NT$17,643 per month.
</P>
<P>
The current rate equals 35.9 percent of the current salary
average.
</P>
<P>
Some 2 million workers would benefit from the rate raise should
it be approved, Lee said.
</P>
<P>
Noting that nothing has yet been settled as the minimum wage rate
adjustment plan is just in the planning stages, Lee said that
while reviewing the plan, the CLA's basic wage screening
committee will take into account the livelihoods of general blue-
collar workers and their families, as well as the impact on the
export competitiveness of domestic industries.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Legislator Lai Shyh-bao
told Lee that the industrial and business sectors have said that
a 5 percent raise in the minimum wage is acceptable, but no
higher.
</P>
<P>
KMT Legislator Lin Hung-chih and opposition People First Party
Legislator Lin Hui-kuan proposed an adjustment to the minimum
hourly wage, saying that more and more people are working for
hourly wages that are unreasonably low.
