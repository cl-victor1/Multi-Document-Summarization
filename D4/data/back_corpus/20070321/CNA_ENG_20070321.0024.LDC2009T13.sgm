Taipei,  March 21 (CNA) 03/21/07  17:48:29 (By Y.L. Kao)
</P>
<P>
More than 40 environmental conservation groups launched a
petition Tuesday to show their support for saving the Losheng
sanatorium and called on Premier Su Tseng-chang to review once
again a proposal to retain 90 percent of the compound.
</P>
<P>
In the petition, the groups voiced opposition to tearing down the
sanatorium to make way for a mass rapid transit depot, while
demanding that the Cabinet deliberate a proposal by the Council
for Cultural Affairs last month to retain 90 percent of the
compound.
</P>
<P>
The sanatorium is located in Taipei County's Hsinchuang City, and
has been treating patients with Hansen's disease, or leprosy,
since 1930.
</P>
<P>
The petition added that under the alternative project, 90 percent
of the sanatorium would be preserved as "a landmark for human
rights, " but will also serve as a "green lung" for residents of
Taipei County.
</P>
<P>
According to the statement, dismantling the sanatorium to make
room for a metro maintenance facility "once again shows" that
Taiwan is going to sacrifice its precious ecology for short-term
profits from land development.
</P>
<P>
The groups urged Su to take into account of "the transportation
and environment rights" of the people of greater Taipei.
</P>
<P>
The groups include the Taiwan Environmental Protection Union, the
Taiwan Academy of Ecology, the Green Party Taiwan, the Homemakers
Union and Foundation and the Green Formosa Front.
</P>
<P>
The MRT system that is being held up by the controversy over the
sanatorium will hugely cut pollution and greatly add to the
transport convenience of the people of Taipei city and county,
proponents of the MRT project said.
