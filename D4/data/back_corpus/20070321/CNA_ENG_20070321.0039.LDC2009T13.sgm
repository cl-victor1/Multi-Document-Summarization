The main opposition Kuomintang approved Wednesday the nomination
of Keelung City Council Speaker Chang Tong-rong as the party's
candidate in the by-election for Keelung mayor, which became
necessary following the death of embattled Mayor Hsu Tsai-li.
</P>
<P>
Following the approval of Chang's candidacy at a weekly meeting
of the KMT Central Standing Committee, KMT spokesman Su Chun-pin
said that since Chang beat Legislator Liu Wen-hsiung of the
opposition People First Party in two polls testing their public
support, the KMT decided to nominate Chang to run in the northern
city's mayoral race.

<P>
According to Su, the secretaries-general of the two parties, as
well as Chang and Liu, agreed at a coordination meeting that a
joint candidate for the mayoral by-election slated for May 12
would be selected based upon the results of public opinion
surveys.

<P>
As for Liu's decision to persist in running for the Keelung
mayor's office, Su said it is up to Keelung citizens to decide
who will be most suitable to serve.

Hsu, who was sentenced to seven years in prison on a graft
conviction, died of complications from chronic heart disease Feb.
19 at the age of 60. The Ministry of the Interior has named Hsu
Ching-kun, chief secretary of the Keelung city government, to
serve as acting mayor.
</P>
<P>
According to the country's public functionaries election law, a
by-election should be held within three months of an elective
post becoming vacant if the original office holder has not yet
served half of the term.
