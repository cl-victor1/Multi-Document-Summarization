DPP CITY, COUNTY CHIEFS URGE PRESIDENT TO CONTINUE MEDIATION
EFFORTS
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taipei,  March 21 (CNA) 03/21/07  17:47:52 (By Lilian Wu)
</P>
<P>
All seven city and county chiefs of the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) issued a joint statement Wednesday,
calling for President Chen Shui-bian to continue his mediation
among the four DPP presidential aspirants.
</P>
<P>
Kaohsiung Mayor Chen Chu,  who initiated the petition for
"cooperation, solidarity and victory in the election, " said they
are worried that stiff competition among the four heavyweights --
Vice President Annette Lu, Premier Su Tseng-chang, former Premier
Frank Hsieh and DPP Chairman Yu Shyi-kun -- will result in the
splintering of the party.
</P>
<P>
Amid reports that the president, after presiding over two rounds
of mediation and coordination without achieving any tangible
results, might give up his efforts, Chen Chu urged the president
not to lose heart.
</P>
<P>
Chen Chu expressed the hope that the president will continue to
mediate so that a DPP ticket can be formed that will live up to
public expectations and win the 2008 presidential election.
</P>
<P>
Chen Chu also expressed hope that the four will be appreciative
of the merits of the others and that they will engage in "a
gentleman's battle."
</P>
<P>
Joining Chen Chu in the petition were Yunlin Magistrate Su Chi-
fen, Chiayi Magistrate Chen Ming-wen, Kaohsiung Magistrate Yang
Chiu-hsin, Pingtung Magistrate Tsao Chi-hung, Tainan Magistrate
Su Huan-chi and Tainan Mayor Hsu Tien-tsai.
</P>
<P>
They said the president should conduct the mediation as he has a
clear picture of the nation's development and is under no
pressure for re-election after completing his two terms.
</P>
<P>
Yang said that if the four compete and mobilize too much, it will
be difficult to integrate the party.
</P>
<P>
Su and Tsao said that if the DPP can produce a candidate before
the primary mechanism is set in motion in May, then the public
will be positive about the party and its chances of winning the
2008 election will be greater.
</P>
<P>
Chen Chu noted that they had not notified the president or the
four aspirants before issuing the statement.
</P>
<P>
The four DPP hopefuls have tacitly accused the other rivals of
various transgressions recently.
</P>
<P>
Lu said on a TV program a day earlier that one of the four
hopefuls forced the president to announce that if first lady Wu
Shu-jen, who was indicted last November for alleged embezzlement
from a "state affairs fund" for the discretionary use of the
president, were found guilty at her first trial, he would step
down.
</P>
<P>
DPP Chairman Yu Shyi-kun echoed her words by saying Wednesday
that "Lu's remarks were close to the truth, " But he refused to
confirm whether Lu was referring to Premier Su.
</P>
<P>
Yu, who was criticized by rivals as tilting too much toward the
"hard-core green camp, " said he is reverting to the spirit and
core values of the DPP when it was founded in 1986, adding that
some party members have forgotten them.
