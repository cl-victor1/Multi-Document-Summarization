The Taiwan High Speed Rail Corp. (THSRC) warned travelers Friday
against using modified high speed rail (HSR) tickets, emphasizing
that doing so is illegal and that violators will face up to a
year in jail.
</P>
<P>
The THSRC issued the warning in a news release after discovering
on-line trading of modified HSR tickets originally sold as half-
price tickets for children. Some people have bought tickets from
the ticket machines at the HSR Taipei Station and have forged the
ticket price and type before marketing them on the Internet,
according to the news release.
</P>
<P>
The company has asked police to launch an investigation into the
case while demanding that Internet service providers stop
allowing advertising of the illegal trading, according to the
news release.
