PENALTIES FOR TVBS FALL SHORT OF PUBLIC EXPECTATIONS: PREMIER
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  March  30 (CNA) 03/30/07  23:33:40 (By Sofia Wu)

Penalties handed down by the National Communications Commission
(NCC) to a local cable TV company that aired a video of a
gangster threatening to kill his formal mob boss fell short of
public expectations, Premier Su Tseng-chang said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Su made the remarks after the NCC decided earlier in the day to
fine the company's two cable channels -- TVBS and TVBS-N -- NT$1
million each for broadcasting the controversial five-minute tape
produced by a TVBS journalist in which the gun-toting gangster
made a death threat against his formal mob boss. The firearms
appeared in the film turned out to be toys.
</P>
<P>
The NCC also demanded that the TV company replaced its president
within seven days of receiving the NCC ruling and that its top
two executives should no longer be allowed to host any programs.
</P>
<P>
Claiming that the case has caused serious social chaos and has
wasted public money to nab the gangster, Su said the NCC-
initiated penalties for TVBS are too lenient and have let down
the public.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the Council of Grand Justices has declared the NCC's
formation based on a party-based  proportional  principle  as
unconstitutional and has set a "sunset clause" for its closure,
Su said the NCC has taken many controversial measures since its
establishment over a year ago.
</P>
<P>
Su further said the Executive Yuan has formed a special task
force to investigate the NCC's controversial decisions and moves
taken in the past one- plus year.
