The Government announced Friday the establishment of the Office
of Trade Negotiations as an agency specially tasked and committed
to dealing with international trade talks, with current Deputy
Representative to the United States John C.C. Deng set to
formally assume office as its first chief in April.
</P>
<P>
President Chen Shui-bian, in the opening ceremony, called the
establishment of the officeproof of the government's creative and
progressive thinking, which has put together a professional team
to build momentum for conducting the nation's trade negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Deng said the launch is significant in that it demonstrates to
the  world Taiwan'sresolution  to  actively  participate  in
international economic and trade affairs, its will to pursue the
cause of liberalization and its sincere wish to improve
cooperative relations with trade partners and friendly countries.
</P>
<P>
The office, under the Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA), will
draft an overall strategy in trade negotiations,  ensure that
government policies are in line with international norms,
integrate the positions of various agencies, and carry out trade
talks, the MOEA said in a news release.
</P>
<P>
To serve those ends, the MOEA said, the office will be comprised
of a Chief Negotiator with the rank and title of Ambassador, two
Deputy Chief Negotiators, ten Senior Negotiators including three
in charge of market opening issues and seven dedicated to
specific topics, a special assistant to the Chief Negotiator, and
15 secretaries.
</P>
<P>
Deng said that Taiwan is facing both grave challenges and
abundant opportunities, one of which is the progress of World
Trade Organization's (WTO) Doha Round negotiations.As  the
world's seventeenth-largest trading power and one of the WTO's
150 members, Taiwan is entitled and obligated to do its utmost to
contribute to the success of the Doha Round of talks,he said.
</P>
<P>
Citing the proliferation of regional trade agreements as another
important trend in world economy, one especially evident in East
Asia, Deng said the necessity for Taiwan to engage itself in
economic integration with world's major economies has become even
more apparent.
</P>
<P>
Last May's Presidential Office National Security Report pointed
to the need  to appoint  a trade  representative  with  full
responsibility for handling and coordinating trade talks.  The
Conference on Sustaining Taiwan's Economic Development held in
July also reached consensus urging the government to set up a
specialized trade negotiation agency.
</P>
<P>
President Chen said he was pleased to see the plan realized,
calling itan achievement  resulting from cooperation  between
government agencies and a fulfillment of people's expectations.
</P>
<P>
Previously, Taiwan's major trade negotiators have been officials
drawn  from various  agencies  who are heavily  loaded  with
administrative tasks,therefore, though as excellent civil
servants and the nation's most important asset, they were not
entirely devoted to negotiations,said Vice Premier Tsai Ing-wen
in her address.
</P>
<P>
With the creation of the office, she said,Taiwan's negotiation
efforts will be smarter and more aggressive, as now we have a
team always ready to represent Taiwan and defend the nation's
interests.
</P>
<P>
She said that Deng possesses qualities required of a successful
negotiator and is the best person to take up the new position.
</P>
<P>
Deng had been Director of the Economic Division of the Taipei
Economic and Cultural Representative Office in the U.S.A, Vice
Chairman of the Mainland Affairs Council and Deputy Permanent
Representative to the WTO.
