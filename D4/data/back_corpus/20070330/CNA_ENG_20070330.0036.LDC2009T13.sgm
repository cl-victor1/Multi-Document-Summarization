LAWMAKERS MULL MECHANISM FOR RECALL OF PROSECUTOR-GENERAL
</HEADLINE>

Taipei, March 30 (CNA) 03/30/07  21:33:05 (By Han Nai-kuo)

Opposition lawmakers said Friday they will try to amend the law
to allow the nation's rank-and-file public prosecutors to have
the power to recall their boss, the state public prosecutor-
general.
</P>
<P>
Legislator Hsu Shao-ping, a whip of the opposition Kuomintang
(KMT) legislative caucus, claimed at a press conference that
State Prosecutor-General Chen Tsung- ming apparently violated the
law and lost his neutrality when he tried to muster support from
the Prosecutors' Personnel Review Committee for a Ministry of
Justice decision to replace more than 10 chief prosecutors in
lower and high courts -- about 40 percent of the chief
prosecutors in Taiwan's courts.
</P>
<P>
The reshuffle was announced a day earlier, although nine of the
17 committee members refused to attend a meeting deliberating the
decision, on the grounds that "political influence interfered in
the proposed reshuffle."
</P>
<P>
Ministry of Justice officials claimed later that they had
completed the procedure required by law by consulting committee
members individually on the telephone, but the nine members who
opposed the move rebutted with a statement in which they said the
decision was made in violation of Article 59 of the Organic Law
of the Courts, which requires a legal quorum for any decision at
a meeting to become effective.
</P>
<P>
Also speaking at the press conference, KMT Legislator Chou Shou-
hsun demanded that the Ministry of Justice publish all the
records of its telephone contacts with the committee members for
public scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
Another KMT legislator, Shuai Hua-ming, urged the newly appointed
chief prosecutors to safeguard judicial independence and
neutrality by refusing to report for duty.
</P>
<P>
Opposition legislators have claimed the reshuffle was politically
motivated because the Democratic Progressive Party government,
dogged by an embezzlement case involving the first lady's alleged
misuse of the president's special state affairs fund, is
attempting to line up chief prosecutors whose legal opinions are
favorable to the case.
</P>
<P>
The Association  for Prosecutors  also issued  a statement
condemning the Ministry of Justice for subjugating to political
pressure in its decision to make the reshuffle.
</P>
<P>
The Justice Ministry, however, has denied the allegations,
claiming that the reshuffle was made purely based on the courts'
needs.
