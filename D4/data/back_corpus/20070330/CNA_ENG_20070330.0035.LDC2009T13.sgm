TAIWAN IDENTITY WILL SOLVE RIFTS ON TRADE POLICIES: PRESIDENT
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taipei,  March 30 (CNA) 03/30/07  21:00:36 (By Lilian Wu)
</P>
<P>
President Chen Shui-bian predicted Friday that once the ratio who
identify themselves as Taiwanese increases to 75 percent, all
differences on cross-Taiwan Strait trade policies will "be worked
out naturally."
</P>
<P>
The president made his prediction in a speech at a national
congress of the Taiwan Securities Association.
</P>
<P>
Chen said there is no question of whether to allow the opening of
cross-strait trade, only the question of "national identity,"
just as he said March 3 that there is no question of the nation
pursuing "the path of right or left, " only the question of
"unification vs. independence."
</P>
<P>
He said that as long as the public identify with Taiwan, then
"they will naturally adopt a more cautious and more serious
attitude toward the direction of cross-strait trade."
</P>
<P>
"When we have become more clear about who we are, then we will be
more firm and tenacious regarding which way to thread," Chen
said.
</P>
<P>
He said that in 2000, the ratio of those who identify themselves
as Taiwanese was only 36.9 percent, but the ratio rose to 60
percent in 2006, and currently stands at 68 percent.
</P>
<P>
He claimed that more people will subscribe to what he described
as the "mainstream view" of "Taiwan first" and forecast that when
the ratio of those who identify themselves as Taiwanese rises to
75 percent, then all disputes or differences on cross-strait
trade policies will be "worked out naturally."
</P>
<P>
"There won't be any controversy," he forecast.
</P>
<P>
Chen said the government attaches great importance to economic
prosperity, noting that several government-managed funds will
soon enter the stock market, giving further impetus to the
bourse.
</P>
<P>
He also said that some individuals, out of ideological
considerations, want to make Taiwan into another Hong Kong and
resist using the name of Taiwan, and are pulling out all the
stops to encourage Taiwan businesses to move west to China.
</P>
<P>
He described Taiwan's investment in China and exports to China as
"too high" and "not a normal phenomenon, " and said this has
resulted in high employment in Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
But after the adjustment of policy over the past two years, the
government was able to cut the jobless rate to 3.9 percent last
year, a new low in six years. Unemployment was cut further to
3.78 percent in February, he added.
</P>
<P>
The government was able to achieve its first fiscal balance in
eight years in 2006, showing that the government's trade and
industrial policies are correct, he said.
