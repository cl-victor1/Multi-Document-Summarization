Taipei,  March 30 (CNA) 03/30/07  21:37:37 (By Flor Wang)

<P>
Ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) Chairman Yu Shyi-kun
voiced satisfaction Friday after the Taiwan Supreme Court
recently ruled that a land plot transfer registration by the main
opposition Kuomintang (KMT) was invalid.
</P>
<P>
Yu made the comment at a news conference held to solicit public
endorsement for a campaign to push the KMT to return its
unlawfully acquired assets and property to the national coffers.
</P>
<P>
Saying that he was upbeat with the court verdict that will help
the Taiwan people regain some of their belongings, the DPP chief
called for public backing for the campaign and expressed hope
that over 1 million people will sign up so that a public
referendum can be held to demand that the KMT return its ill-
gotten companies and land plots.
</P>
<P>
Proceeds and property regained from such lawsuit successes
against the KMT will be exclusively used to take care of the
needs of the underprivileged and minority groups, including the
elderly, mentally and physically challenged and students,
according to Yu.
</P>
<P>
According to Yu, he instructed the Ministry of Transportation and
Communications in his capacity as premier in 2004 to take legal
action to force the KMT to return eight land plots in Panchiao,
Taipei County that the KMT had transferred to the KMT-affiliated
Broadcasting Corporation of China (BCC).
</P>
<P>
He accused former KMT Chairman Ma Ying-jeou of illegally selling
his party's assets at unfairly low prices for more than a year
when holding the KMT's top post and claimed that the DPP will
never allow Ma, a likely contender in the March 2008 presidential
election, to sell Taiwan out to China.
</P>
<P>
Ma resigned from the KMT chairmanship in February after being
indicted by Taipei prosecutors on corruption charges over alleged
mishandling of a special municipal monthly allowance designated
for his discretionary use when he served as mayor of Taipei from
1998-2006.
</P>
<P>
Despite the embezzlement charges, Ma has proclaimed his desire to
take part in the next presidential race.
