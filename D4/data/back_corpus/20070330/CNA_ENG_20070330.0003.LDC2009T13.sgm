Taipei,  March 29 (CNA) 03/30/07  10:50:52 (By Flor Wang)

<P>
In response to a protest slated by the main opposition Kuomintang
(KMT) Saturday in Taipei against a government plan to remove the
walls surrounding Chiang Kai- shek (CKS) Memorial Hall, lawmakers
of the ruling party said they will consider mobilizing supporters
to pull down the walls themselves.
</P>
<P>
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) lawmakers, including Trong R.
Chai and Tien Chiu-chin, made the comments at a news conference
at the Legislative Yuan, which was also attended by
representatives from the Taiwan 228 Care Association.
</P>
<P>
Chai insisted that the DPP must reckon with the crimes committed
by Chiang, the main culprit responsible for murdering some 20,000
Taiwanese elite in the 228 Incident of 1947.
</P>
<P>
"Why can the walls of the CKS Memorial not be torn down? " Chai
questioned, pointing to the now demolished world famous and
scenic Berlin Walls and accusing the KMT of deceiving the
Taiwanese people.
</P>
<P>
According to Tien, the protest initiated by KMT Legislator John
Chiang, a grandson of the late president, will only worsen ethnic
tensions and further split Taiwan society.
</P>
<P>
The KMT's failure to hold Chiang accountable for the 228 Incident
and its planned protest against the government's demolition plans
will again inflict harm on the families of the 228 Incident
victims, she argued.
