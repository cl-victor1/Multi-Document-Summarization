CONSENSUS KEY TO COMBINING ELECTIONS: PREMIER
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  March 30 (CNA) 03/30/07  19:33:46 (By Flor Wang)

Premier Su Tseng-chang said Friday that a consensus must first be
built between ruling and opposition parties if the upcoming
legislative and presidential elections are to be combined.
</P>
<P>
Su made the comments at the Legislative Yuan while answering
lawmakers' questions on the issue after the United Daily News,
citing sources from the opposition Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU)
, reported that the ruling Democratic Progressive Party is
considering combining the presidential election -- slated for
March, 2008 -- December's legislative election, and a national
referendum, on Jan. 19 next year.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, the DPP thinks that it could win big in
southern regions in the legislative election by doing so.
</P>
<P>
Despite the fact that the Central Election Commission (CEC) has
the authority to make the final decision  on combining  the
presidential and legislative polls, and his own willingness to
back the proposal if it is cost-effective, Su said that forging a
consensus between the various political parties is vital to such
a move as the CEC is required to come up with a decision at least
six months ahead of the original legislative election date.
</P>
<P>
Later the same day, the opposition People First Party (PFP)
voiced its disagreement with the idea of holding the three
elections at the same time on the grounds that a CEC organic
draft bill has yet to clear the Legislative Yuan to legalize its
establishment.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a Legislative Yuan news conference, PFP policy center
director Chang Hsien-yao said that his party is opposed to
combining the elections prior to the legislative passage of the
draft bill. Political influence must be kept away from electoral
affairs and the CEC's operations, he insisted.
