</HEADLINE>

<P>
Taipei, March 30 (CNA) 03/30/07  18:38:51 (By Lilian Wu)
</P>
<P>
President Chen Shui-bian has added four life insurance policies,
but has no more stocks under the name of first lady Wu Shu-jen,
according to the latest Control Yuan's public officials assets
disclosure report released Friday.
</P>
<P>
This was the first time that President Chen has filed a report of
life insurance policies. The three policies issued by Taiwan Post
Co. will return NT$1.5 million (US$45,450) to the president after
five years, while another policy by Cathay Life Insurance Co.
will return NT$30 million after 15 years.
</P>
<P>
The president filed the latest declaration of assets Dec. 1,
2006.
</P>
<P>
The assets of the president and the first lady included eight
pieces of land, eight housing properties and deposits in four
bank accounts under the name Wu amounting to NT$2.82 million.
</P>
<P>
The first lady also put her deposits of NT$65.9 million in trust,
while the president put NT$2.27 million in trust. In the previous
filing in April 2006, the president put deposits of NT$494,295 in
trust, while the first lady put NT$745,798 in trust.
</P>
<P>
In the last filing, there were 13 stocks under the name of Wu. If
counted at their face value of NT$10 per share, they were worth a
combined total of NT$48.32 million.
</P>
<P>
Concerning other valuables, the president filed the same report
as his corrected version in August 2006, showing that the first
family had 15 pieces of jewelry, earnings, rings and necklaces as
well as luxury watches, with a total value of NT$3.72 million.
</P>
<P>
The first family filed the corrected version last August at the
request of the Control Yuan after opposition legislators produced
photos of 31 pieces of jewelry worn by the first lady on various
occasions.
</P>
<P>
According to the Public Functionary Assets Disclosure Law, any
piece of jewelry, including watches, owned by public
functionaries and worth over NT$200,000 should be listed with the
Control Yuan.
</P>
<P>
The first couple said that they filed reports on their jewelry
but had not reported on jewelry "borrowed from relatives or
friends" because the relatives and friends were not being audited
and should have the privacy of their assets protected.
