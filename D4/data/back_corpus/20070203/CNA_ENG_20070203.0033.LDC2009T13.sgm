UNIFICATION NOT KMT'S PRESENT POLICY GOAL: PARTY CHIEF
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  Feb.  3 (CNA) 02/03/07  23:52:23 (By Sofia Wu)

<P>
Opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Ma Ying-jeou said Saturday
that promoting unification of the two sides of the Taiwan Strait
is not the party's policy goal at the present stage.
</P>
<P>
Even the Chinese mainland doesn't make cross-strait unification
its present goal, Ma claimed in an interview broadcast on CNN
International channel's "Talk Asia" program.
</P>
<P>
As to whether the two sides will unify in the future, Ma said
nobody knows whether there will be conditions or circumstances
conducive to such a development.
</P>
<P>
Noting that Taiwan's future must be determined by its 23 million
people out of their own free will, Ma said that at the moment,
the majority of Taiwanese citizens opt for maintaining the status
quo.
</P>
<P>
Asked about his views on cross-strait relations, Ma said that
economically, China is an opportunity for Taiwan, but
politically, it is a threat to Taiwan. What Taiwan should do is
to maximize the opportunity presented by China while working to
minimize its threat, Ma suggested.
</P>
<P>
The Harvard-trained politician acknowledged that China is a
security threat to Taiwan as it has deployed 800 ballistic
missiles aimed at the island. Nevertheless, he said the Chinese
mainland offers business opportunities for Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Quoting official tallies, Ma said cross-strait trade exceeded
US$100 billion last year, with China and Hong Kong accumulatively
taking up 40 percent of Taiwan's overall exports.
</P>
<P>
In the interview, Ma also expounded on the KMT's stance toward
cross-strait relations. While the KMT, which originated in China
and ruled Taiwan for more than five decades until May 2000,
accepts the "one China" principle, Ma said the party insists on
"separate definition" of China by the two sides of the Taiwan
Strait.
</P>
<P>
For the KMT, Ma said, "one China" refers to the Republic of China
-- Taiwan's official title. The Chinese mainland may not accept
the KMT's "one China" definition and likewise, the KMT could not
agree to Beijing's defining "one China" as the People's Republic
of China -- the Chinese mainland's official title.
</P>
<P>
Ma said he believes the KMT-coined  "one China,  separate
interpretation" discourse is the best strategy for this extremely
contentious and sensitive issue. In his view, Ma said Taiwan need
not challenge China's definition in this regard and should
instead simply shelve it for the moment.
</P>
<P>
Ma, who ended his eight-year stint as Taipei mayor last December,
is widely seen as the KMT's best bet for the 2008 presidential
election.
