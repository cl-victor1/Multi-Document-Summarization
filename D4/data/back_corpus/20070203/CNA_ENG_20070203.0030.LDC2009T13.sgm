PUBLIC WARNED NOT TO BRING IN ILLEGAL ANIMALS OR PLANTS FROM
CHINA

Taipei,  Feb.  3 (CNA) 02/03/07  20:38:29 (By Elisa Kao)

Council of Agriculture (COA) officials warned the public Saturday
not to use the "mini three links" routes between the two sides of
the Taiwan Strait to bring in from China live animals, plants or
farm produce that are not allowed to enter Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
The officials issued the warning in the runup to the Lunar New
Year festival, during which "mini three links" traffic usually
reaches its annual peak.
</P>
<P>
The "mini three links, " implemented in 2001, originally referred
to direct postal, transport and trade links between Taiwan's
outlying islands of Kinmen and Matsu, and Xiamen and Fuzhou
harbors in China's Fujian Province.
</P>
<P>
As transport via the links has increased significantly, a new
route from Kinmen to the port city of Quanzhou, also in Fujian
Province, was opened last year.
</P>
<P>
Quarantine officials on Kinmen said that as China still has many
infectious plant and animal diseases, the majority of its fresh
agricultural products and live animals are not allowed to enter
Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
The officials said they had recently confiscated a lot of cured
meat, ham and fresh fruit, which are popular gifts at Lunar New
Year, and they warned travelers that violators will have their
contraband goods confiscated and destroyed, with serious
violators facing fines of between NT$30,000 and NT$150,000, in
addition to jail terms of up to three years.
</P>
<P>
The officials said quarantine inspections will not be relaxed
during the Lunar New Year festival period.
