World Vision Taiwan (WVT) , a Christian charity dedicated to
humanitarian relief, called on the public Saturday to help some
40,000 children around the island whose parents are too poor to
pay their school tuition fees.
</P>
<P>
A WVT official noted that thanks to the help of many individuals
and enterprises last year, these children were able to attend
school that year, and he said WVT hopes more people will help
this year, particularly in the run up to the Lunar New Year
festival.
</P>
<P>
According to the official, the children come mainly from families
with unemployed parents or from single-parent families.

<P>
In cooperation with Far EasTone Telecommunications Co. this year,
people who donate more than NT$2,500 to the program can receive a
souvenir from Far EasTone, the official said.

Prospective donors can visit WVT's Web site at:
www.worldvision.org.tw or call 02-2585-6300 for more information.
