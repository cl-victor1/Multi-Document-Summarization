WANTED REBAR FOUNDER FLEES AGAIN TO U.S.

Los Angeles,  Feb.  2 (CNA) 02/03/07  12:13:25 (By Chu Lu-sheng
and Y.F. Low)
</P>

Disgraced Rebar Asia Pacific Group founder Wang You-theng and his
wife, who face arrest in Taiwan for their roles in a series of
financial scandals within the business group, returned to Los
Angeles Friday after their attempt to flee to Myanmar via
Singapore was thwarted by the Singapore authorities.
</P>
<P>
As both the Republic of China and Dominican Republic passports
held by Wang have been canceled, Wang was held by U.S.
immigration authorities upon his arrival at the Los Angeles
International Airport.
</P>
<P>
However, Wang's wife Wang Chin She-ying, who holds a U.S.
passport, is not expected to face any problems entering the
United States.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan officials posted in the United States said they are still
negotiating with the U.S. authorities in the hope that Wang can
be returned to Taiwan. The two countries do not have an
extradition treaty.
</P>
<P>
In Taipei, Minister of Foreign Affairs deputy spokeswoman Yeh
Fei-pi said Taiwan is maintaining close communication with the
United States to try to make the United States understand that
Wang's case is not a simple immigration case.
</P>
<P>
However, it is up to the United States to decide how it will
handle the case, and Taiwan will respect the decision made by the
United States, Yeh said.
</P>
<P>
The Wangs, who have allegedly embezzled billions of dollars in
corporate funds, fled to China late last year just before the
scandal broke, from where they flew to the United States.
</P>
<P>
The couple departed from Los Angeles Wednesday for Myanmar via
Singapore and immediately  fell under close scrutiny from the
Singapore authorities upon their arrival at Singapore's Changi
International Airport early Friday.
</P>
<P>
Through intensive negotiations with the Taiwan authorities,
Singapore originally agreed to facilitate Wang's extradition by
arranging for the couple to take a Singapore-Los Angeles flight
that would include a stopover in Taiwan so that they could be
arrested by the Taiwan authorities.
</P>
<P>
However, the couple refused to cooperate and demanded to return
to the United States on a direct flight to Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
The Rebar scandals came to light early last month after the Rebar
group's China Rebar Co. and Chia Hsin Food and Synthetic Fiber
Co. applied for insolvency restructuring, triggering a run on the
Chinese Bank, another Rebar affiliate.
</P>
<P>
The Taipei District Prosecutor's Office accused the couple Jan.
12 of violating the Securities Transaction Act and breach of
trust and put them on Taiwan's most-wanted list Jan. 15.
