President Chen Shui-bian, during his inspection tour of military
facilities on a front line islet, Friday criticized the
opposition for blocking government budget bills in the
legislature and delaying the delivery of new arms to the forces.
</P>
<P>
Chen made his visit to Wuchiu, a small group of islets near
Kinmen island with a total area slightly over 1 square kilometer,
to boost the morale of garrison soldiers.
</P>
<P>
Chen, in his address to the soldiers, stressed the importance of
Wuchiu as holding a key position on Taiwan's front line with
China.
</P>
<P>
He said the strategic value of Wuchiu is not just relevant to the
place itself, but to Taiwan's overall national security. He told
them that"the assurance of Taiwan's national security and the
safeguard of Taiwan's democratic system is a cornerstone for the
safety and stability of the Asia-Pacific region."
</P>
<P>
He then pointed to the awkward situation encountered in dealing
with arms purchases and other government budgetary measures.
</P>
<P>
"Certain opposition party insisted on putting at the very top of
the list the so-called  'Organic Act of the Central Election
Commission',  a highly politicized and party-centric bill, and
therefore obstructed the whole legislative agenda,"he said.
</P>
<P>
He said the opposition's move"froze out the central government
general budget bill and another couple of dozen bills, including
the major arms purchases, seriously hampering the forces' renewal
of arms and again hampering military preparations, "a result he
called" regrettable".
</P>
<P>
The opposition Kuomintang (KMT) in last legislative session
initiated a bill to restructure the Central Election Commission.
According to the bill, the commission is to be made up by members
recommended by political parties in proportion to the parties'
legislative seats, with the limitation that no single party could
control more than forty percent of the seats on the 17-member
commission.
</P>
<P>
The ruling Democratic Progressive Party, which currently enjoys
exclusive power to name all members through the premier, opposes
the new formula. Disputes over the bill resulted in a total lack
of progress on the general budget and other bills.
