Nearly 60 percent of health clubs in 12 randomly chosen cities
and counties around the country have failed building safety
management inspection, a spokesman for the Consumer Protection
Commission (CPC) under the Executive Yuan said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
A total of 61 health clubs, gyms &amp; spas, or fitness centers
in 12 administrative regions,  including Taipei City,  Taipei
County, Kaohsiung City, Kaohsiung County, Taoyuan County, Hsinchu
City, Miaoli County, Hualien County, Taichung City, Chiayi City,
Yilan County and Keelung City, were examined, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The review covered building safety management, fire safety
management and use of standardized contract documents, the
spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
According to the spokesman, 36 health clubs, or 59 percent of the
total,  failed building safety management inspection, while 25
percent, or 15 health clubs, failed fire safety examination.
</P>
<P>
Of those failing the building safety management inspection, 25
percent illegally expanded their operation spaces; 15 percent
failed to properly install emergency exits; and 23 percent failed
to apply for regular building safety inspection with proper
government agencies.
</P>
<P>
Among those failing fire safety inspection, 11 percent were found
to have defective fire alarm equipment; and 13 percent failed to
meet the requirements in emergency lighting, emergency exit
signage or evacuation facilities.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, 15 health clubs, or 25 percent of the total, were
found to have not used standardized documents in their contracts
with clients. Among the 46 health clubs that use standardized
contracts, 33 failed to meet the stipulation set forth by the
National Council on Physical Fitness and Sports with regard to
contract narrative terms. As a result, the number of gyms that
failed to use officially sanctioned contract forms reached 48 or
79 percent of the total.
</P>
<P>
Officials from the CPC under the Executive Yuan joined consumer
protection staff at city and county governments  as well as
construction administrators, fire fighting and physical education
departments officials in conducting the extensive safety
inspection last month, the CPC spokesman said.
