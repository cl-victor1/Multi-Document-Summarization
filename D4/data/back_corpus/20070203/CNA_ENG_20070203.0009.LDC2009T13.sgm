GRAND JUSTICES TO HOLD EXPLANATORY SESSIONS ON PRESIDENT'S
REQUEST
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taipei, Feb. 3 (CNA) 02/03/07  12:42:29 (By Sofia Wu)
</P>
<P>
The Council of Grand Justices (CGJ) will meet Feb. 13-14 to
review documents relating to President Chen Shui-bian's request
for a constitutional interpretation aimed at blocking the
continuing trial of the "state affairs fund" case in which his
wife is a defendant, a Judicial Yuan spokesman said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Constitutional law scholars and experts will also be invited to
the two-day explanatory session to give opinions and views on the
high-profile case involving the head of state's immunity and
right to confidentiality, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Presidential Office Deputy Secretary-General Cho Jung-tai filed
the interpretation request with the CGJ Jan. 25 on behalf of Chen
in hope of clarifying the constitutionality of the court
proceedings of the "state affairs fund" case.
</P>
<P>
Cho also filed an injunction petition asking the Judicial Yuan to
order the Taipei District Court to immediately stop the trial and
repeal its previous ruling on opening supposedly "secret" files
relating to the case.
</P>
<P>
"The grand justices feel the need to collect more information and
about the issue, " the Judicial Yuan spokesman said, adding that
the invitation of academics to present their views and insights
is in compliance  with  the Enforcement  Rules  for the Law of
the Interpretation Procedures for Grand Justices.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman  further said the convening  of the two-day
explanatory session does not necessarily mean that the CGJ will
come to a conclusion on the case soon.
</P>
<P>
First lady Wu Shu-jen, along with three former and incumbent
senior aides at the Presidential Office, is facing trial at the
Taipei District Court after she and Chen were named by a public
prosecutor as "joint perpetrators" in an embezzlement case
involving the alleged misuse of the president's discretionary
"state affairs fund."
</P>
<P>
In a lengthy document submitted to the CGJ Jan. 25, the
Presidential Office said the interpretation request is aimed at
defending the constitutional status of the presidency,
maintaining the  democratic  system  and protecting  the sanctity
of the Constitution.
</P>
<P>
Since the president  is protected  by Article  52 of the
Constitution, the statement argued that the court cannot ask the
president to testify during the investigation process and court
hearing or to surrender secret documents or to even hear the
case. The president must also be entitled to litigation immunity
and cannot be prosecuted until his term expires, the statement
added.
</P>
<P>
It further said the Taipei District Court had infringed upon the
president's executive privileges and risked leaking state secrets
by opening the secret files relating to the "state affairs fund"
case.
</P>
<P>
Chen has denied any wrongdoing with regard to the special "state
affairs fund " and has claimed he has not lined his pockets with
the fund. He has promised to resign if his wife is found guilty
in the first trial and has said history will return justice to
him and the judicial process will clear his name.
