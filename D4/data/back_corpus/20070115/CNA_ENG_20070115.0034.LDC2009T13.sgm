Fruit farmers in Yunlin County will deliver 60 metric tons of
oranges Tuesday, the first batch that will go toward filling the
1,200-ton order placed by China, Yunlin United Logistics Corp.
announced Monday.

<P>
A spokesman for the company said the 60 tons of oranges, to be
shipped to Shanghai, will help ease stagnation in Taiwan's
domestic market for oranges, and that the purchase price was set
at NT$15 per kg.
</P>
<P>
He said the rest of the order, to be filled by oranges produced
in Yunlin and Nantou counties, will supply markets in Shanghai
and cities in the coastal province of Zhejiang.

<P>
The spokesman added that the company will call a meeting Tuesday
among Yunlin County's orange farmers to discuss requirements in
the procurement process to ensure the quality of the produce.

Meanwhile, the legislative caucus of the opposition Kuomintang
told reporters in Taipei that China placed the order for 1,200
metric tons of Taiwanese-produced oranges as a goodwill  gesture
in accordance with an emergency procurement agreement aimed at
easing Taiwan's fruit glut.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the caucus noted that the purchase price of NT$15
per kg will bring handsome profits for the orange farmers, whose
production cost is estimated at about NT$10 per kg.
