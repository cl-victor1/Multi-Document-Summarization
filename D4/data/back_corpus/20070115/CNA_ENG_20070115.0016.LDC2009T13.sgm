Two Chinese organizations are planning to purchase a total of
1,200 metric tons of oranges from the central county of Yunlin at
NT$15 (US$0.46) per kilo in the coming days, the opposition
Kuomintang (KMT) legislative caucus reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The purchase was made possible after KMT Chairman Ma Ying-jeou
visited Yunlin Jan. 11 and met with local fruit growers, who
complained that an orange glut has driven the price down to an
average of below NT$10 per kilo, according to Tseng Yung-chuan,
executive director of the KMT Central Policy Committee.
</P>
<P>
Ma instructed Chen Wu-hsiung, a member of the National Policy
Foundation, which is a KMT think-tank, and Chang Shuo-wen, who is
a KMT legislator representing the Yunlin constituency, to depart
for China Jan. 11 to meet with Beijing authorities and discuss a
possible purchase of Yunlin oranges by China.
</P>
<P>
According to Chen, the Taiwan Affairs Office of the State Council
then arranged a meeting between the two delegates and executives
from the two Chinese marketing organizations.
</P>
<P>
The two sides agreed that the two Chinese companies would
purchase 1,200 metric tons of Yunlin oranges at of NT$15 per
kilo, the first shipment of which -- three containers -- was
scheduled to leave for Shanghai Tuesday, according to Chen.
</P>
<P>
Chen said prices of Yunlin oranges have plunged below production
cost, to an average of NT$8 per kilo, as a result of glut,
leaving growers in dire straits, adding that the KMT's emergency
measure to sell the fruit to China has only the goal of
protecting fruit growers' interests.
