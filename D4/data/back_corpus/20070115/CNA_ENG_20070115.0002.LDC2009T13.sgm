PROSECUTORS CHECKING WHETHER REBAR FOUNDER HAS FLED TO U.S.
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  Jan.  14 (CNA) 01/15/07  03:12:44 (By Sofia Wu)
</P>
<P>
Prosecution authorities said Sunday they are checking whether the
founder of the troubled Rebar Asia Pacific Group has fled from
China to the United States or any other country as claimed by
some media reports.
</P>
<P>
Lin Chin-tsun, spokesman for the Taipei Prosecutor's Office, said
there were reports claiming that the 82-year-old Rebar founder,
Wang You-theng, had departed China and slipped into the United
States along with his wife Chin Shih- ying, while other reports
said only Chin had gone to the United States.
</P>
<P>
"We have received many wildly divergent reports about the Wangs'
whereabouts. We are working to verify relevant reports, but no
'wild reports' would affect the investigative team's probes into
the snowballing corporate scandals allegedly involving the
troubled Rebar group," Lin said.
</P>
<P>
Sources close to the investigative team said Wang left Taipei for
Hong Kong a day after two ailing Rebar affiliates -- Chian Rebar
Co. and Chia Hsin Food and Synthetic Fiber Co. -- applied for
insolvency reorganization Dec. 29, while Chin didn't left Taipei
until Jan. 1. The couple later appeared together in Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
Investigators said the Wangs obviously had no intention to return
to Taiwan as Chin had remitted part of their cash stash abroad
before her departure.
</P>
<P>
According to investigators, the Wangs bought into Omni Bank in
Los Angeles in 1990. One of Wang's son, Wang Lin-hsing, now
serves as the bank's chairman while Chin is its vice chairwoman.
Prosecutors are probing whether Chin had remitted money through
Rebar's overseas figurehead companies to Omni Bank or other
foreign banks before she fled Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
The Taiwan High Prosecutor's Office has formed a special task
force to investigate a spate of corporate crimes allegedly
involving many of the Rebar's 120-odd subsidiaries after China
Rebar and Chia Hsin applied for insolvency protection late last
year which triggered a run on the Chinese Bank, also a Rebar
offshoot.
</P>
<P>
The investigative team launched two rounds of massive searches at
Rebar group headquarters and offices of its affiliates as well as
private homes of the Wang family and corporate executives. A
large collection of documents, including some "very useful files
and computer discs," have been confiscated.
</P>
<P>
Investigators said they have pored over many seized data during
the weekend and may start to subpoena suspects or witnesses
Monday at the earliest.
</P>
<P>
The crimes allegedly committed by Rebar affiliates included
insider trading, embezzlement of corporate funds, phony
accounting practices, fraud, hollowing out of corporate assets,
forgery and violations of the banking law and accounting
regulations.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Financial Supervisory Commission (FSC) denied a
media report Sunday that a leak by its officials had allowed Wang
to flee Taiwan amid snowballing scandals involving his
conglomerate.
</P>
<P>
"An investigation by the FSC, the Taipei Prosecutor's Office and
the Ministry of Justice Investigation Bureau (MJIB) has shown
that there was no leak by officials which allowed Wang You-theng
to slip out Taiwan, " the country's top financial regulatory body
said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
Before China Rebar and Chia Hsin filed for restructuring their
businesses Dec. 29 after years of losses hurt their ability to
repay debts, the statement said the FSC's inspection bureau and
the Taiwan Stock Exchange Co. didn't conduct any field survey on
the two companies. Against this backdrop, it added, there was no
such thing as to any FSC official had tipped off Wang.
</P>
<P>
The MJIB also issued a statement stressing that no leads or
evidence are available at the moment to prove that any official
has tipped off Wang to flee quietly before prosecution
authorities issued an overseas travel ban against Wang and his
wife early this month. Prosecutors have later issued arrest
warrants for the couple.
</P>
<P>
So far, more than 40 other Rebar group managers and Wang family
members, including Wang's eight children, have been barred from
traveling abroad.
</P>
<P>
Wang's son Wang Lin-yi and his brother Wang Shih-chan, both
managers of Union Insurance Co., also a Rebar affiliate, were
taken into custody Thursday on charges of violating the
Securities and Exchange Law, prosecutors said.
</P>
<P>
The scandal claimed its first government casualty Friday when FSC
Chairman Shih Jun-ji resigned to assume political responsibility
for the Rebar fiasco. Since the breakout of the Rebar scandal,
Shih had come under fire for lax supervision of the financial
sector.
</P>
<P>
Premier Su Tseng-chang accepted his resignation but has not yet
named his replacement.
