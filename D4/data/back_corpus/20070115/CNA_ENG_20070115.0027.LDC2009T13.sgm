TAIWAN TO ASSESS WHETHER TO RESUME CANADIAN BEEF IMPORTS:
PRESIDENT
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  Jan. 15 (CNA) 01/15/07  18:48:06 (By Lilian Wu)
</P>
<P>
President Chen Shui-bian said Monday that Department of Health
Minister Hou Sheng-mou will travel to Canada at the end of this
month to assess whether to resume imports of Canadian beef.
</P>
<P>
Chen made the remarks when he received a delegation of Canadian
parliamentarians at the Presidential Office.
</P>
<P>
He said Canadian agriculture suffered a serious blow after
several countries, including China, Japan and Taiwan, banned
Canadian beef in the wake of a case of mad cow disease in Canada
in May 2003.
</P>
<P>
Hou will lead a delegation to Canada to learn about related
inspection and quarantine measures for beef there and make an
assessment on whether to resume imports, Chen said, noting that
Taiwan used to be the fifth-largest market for Canadian beef.
</P>
<P>
He also said Taiwan is Canada's 11th-largest trading partner,
with two-way trade amounting to US$4.3 billion last year and
Taiwan enjoying a US$2.1 billion surplus.
</P>
<P>
The president also expressed concern about a bill, titled the
Taiwan Affairs Act, which is patterned on the U.S. Taiwan
Relations Act and currently being reviewed in the Canadian
parliament.
</P>
<P>
He invited the visiting Canadian parliamentarians to speak up for
Taiwan, support Taiwan's bid to join the World Health
Organization, and promote substantial relations between the two
countries with regard to customs, taxes, health and mutual
judicial assistance.
</P>
<P>
Chen also noted that while Canada's Ministry of International
Trade has barred officials from attending Taiwan's Double Ten
National Day celebrations in the past, several ministerial-level
officials attended the Oct. 10 celebration last year, which he
said was a "good and welcome change."
