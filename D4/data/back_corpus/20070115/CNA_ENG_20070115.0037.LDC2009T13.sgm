Taiwan's first evercoin-castingmould has been found at a
prehistoric site in the southeast part of the country, though use
ofcurrency in the culture 1,300 years ago is doubtful.
</P>
<P>
The 1,300 years old stone-made device was excavated from Tuoliang
Site, Taitung County, on December 30, 2006. Lee Kun-shou,
assistant curator  of National Museum  of Prehistory,  said that
while archaeologists believe it is a mould for making bronze
objects resembling ancient Chinese coins - the type with a
circular edge and a square hole in the middle - the use to which
the materials cast were put is unknown, but it is unlikely that
they served as money.

<P>
As far as we know, the prehistoric society here had not yet
developed the practice of currency circulation,Lee said.
</P>
<P>
He said nothing cast in the mould was found.

<P>
Another prominent prehistoric site, Shihsanhang in Taipei County,
has seen excavation of many ancient Chinese coins, over a period
spanning more than a thousand years, including the same era as
the mould found in Tuoliang - that of the Tang Dynasty. Scholars
believe that coins brought from China to Shihsanhang were used by
natives as ornaments.
</P>
<P>
Lee said the ancient Tuoliang people might have had direct or
indirect contact with Shihsanhang and tried to copy what they had
seen.

Moulds for knife handles and objects in the shape of dogs,
turtles and other items have been found at another site in
Taitung County.
