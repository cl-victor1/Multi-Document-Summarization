EPA
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Taipei, Jan. 15 (CNA) 01/15/07  17:31:54 (EPA)  said Monday that
if the Taiwan High-Speed  Rail Corp.  (THSRC) (By Lilian Wu)
</P>
<P>
The Environmental Protection Administration fails to deliver on
promises it made with regard to noise levels when the system was
having its environmental impact assessment, local governments
along the route can issue tickets to the company in the event of
excessive noise from the railway.
</P>
<P>
EPA officials made the remarks after the Miaoli county government
fined the THSRC NT$1.5 million (US$45,700) over noise and
demanded that it make improvements before Feb. 28 or face further
fines. It was the first fine for excessive noise received by the
THSRC since the bullet train started operations Jan. 5.
</P>
<P>
The officials noted that since the commercial test run of the
train, which cuts the travel time between Taipei in northern
Taiwan and Kaohsiung in southern Taiwan to 90 minutes from the
four hours on the conventional railway, there have been
continuous complaints from the public about the noise.
</P>
<P>
The officials said that existing noise pollution laws do not
regulate traffic noise, but if the THSRC fails to live up to the
noise levels it promised to stay below during the environmental
impact assessment, then local governments can fine the company.
</P>
<P>
Tsai Lin-yi, a section chief of EPA's Department of Comprehensive
Planning, said the THSRC made a promise on the noise level it
would adhere to. If the noise level comes above the promised
level, then it will be fined for being in violation of the
environmental impact assessment.
</P>
<P>
Hsieh Ping-hui, another section chief of the EPA's Department of
Air Quality Protection and Noise Control, said that a revised
noise regulation law is currently being reviewed in the
legislature, adding provisions for fines on traffic noise.
</P>
<P>
The EPA has also set levels for background noise at 206 sensitive
points along the route of the bullet train.
</P>
<P>
If the high-speed train's noise exceeds the levels, the company
will have to improve in 180 days or face fines of between
NT$100,000 and NT$500,000 for each violation.
