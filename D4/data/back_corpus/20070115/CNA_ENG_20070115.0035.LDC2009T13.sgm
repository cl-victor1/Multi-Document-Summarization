DOMESTIC DEMAND TO REBOUND AS BAD LOANS WRITTEN OFF: THINK TANK
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  Jan. 15 (CNA) 01/15/07  21:00:10 (By T.C. Jiang)
</P>
<P>
Taiwan's domestic demand is set to pick up this year as most
banks have written off their bad loans and lending to the private
sector and investments are also increasing, according to Taiwan
Thinktank Chairman Chen Po-chih.
</P>
<P>
Chen made the remarks recently at a forum organized by the
Ketagalan Institute in an attempt to dispel misgivings that the
economy will be dragged down by poor export performance this year
due to a possible global economic slowdown.
</P>
<P>
According to forecasts made by the Cabinet-level Directorate
General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics (DGBAS) and the
Taiwan Institute of Economic Research, this year's economic
growth rate is likely to reach between 4.08 percent and 4.21
percent.
</P>
<P>
However, Chen expressed an optimistic view, saying that the DGBAS
expects domestic demand to rebound after a long stagnant period,
as most banks have written off their bad loans created by the
1998 financial crisis, while statistics show an increase in
private loan volume and investment.
</P>
<P>
In addition, he claimed that the recent Rebar Group scandal will
have only limited impact on the economy as the problems are
confined to the group itself.
</P>
<P>
The scandal did not come as a surprise, according to Chen, who
added that most banks had long known that the Chinese Bank, a
Rebar affiliate, had been in bad shape.
</P>
<P>
During the past five years, the government and local banks took
action to write off bad loans amounting to nearly NT$2 trillion.
these actions hurt the overall economy, in particular domestic
demand, he said.
</P>
<P>
Local banks, for instance, had to increase capital and reduce
bonuses, while the government lowered business tax rates for
banks to raise funds for bad loan write-offs, Chen remarked,
adding that these measures squeezed other budgets and
consequently weakened domestic demand.
</P>
<P>
Chen explained that the government lost NT$4 trillion in total --
NT$2 trillion in business tax revenues and NT$2 trillion in bad
loans.
</P>
<P>
In other words, during the past five years, the government and
citizens had an average annual decrease of NT$800 billion at
their disposal, which accounted for 8 percent of the gross
domestic product (GDP).
</P>
<P>
These losses inevitably caused the national economy to decline,
Chen went on.
</P>
<P>
The think tank chairman also explained that before the 1998
financial crisis, private loans had increased almost NT$1
trillion every year. However, the period between 1998 and 2002
only saw a rise of NT$100 billion, he noted.
</P>
<P>
This indicates that local banks almost ceased to issue private
loans, which made it difficult for companies to acquire capital,
he said.
</P>
<P>
Yet, during the last year, the private loan volume surged to
NT$770 billion, representing signs of recovery of bank lending to
the private sector, according to Chen.
</P>
<P>
In addition,  the figures  indicate  that local  financial
institutions increased their investments in the private sector
and will continue to do so, Chen said, adding that last year
posted an increase of NT$130 billion in their total investments.
