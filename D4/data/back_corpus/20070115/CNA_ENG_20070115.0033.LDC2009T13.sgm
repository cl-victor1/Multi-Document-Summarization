The world first draft genome sequence of a common parasite,
Trichomonas Vaginalis, has been generated by an international
research team, a professor of the Chang Gung University in
Kuishan, Taoyuan County said in Taipei, Monday.
</P>
<P>
Chiu Cheng-hsun, a professor at Chang Gung's Bioinformatics
Center and Molecular Medicine Research Center and the Taiwanese
Coordinator of the project, said at a news conference Monday that
their work has made the cover story of the Jan. 12 issue of
Science magazine, published by the American Association for the
Advancement of Science.

Chiu said Trichomonas Vaginalis is the second most common
parasite after malaria, and affects more than 180 million people
worldwide.

Wang Chih-hao, a gynecologist from the Chang Gung Memorial
Hospital in Kuishan, said Trichomonas Vaginalis are spread
through sex. Men who engaged in sex with women who carry this
parasite have a 70 percent chance of getting the parasite,
although they might not know it because the parasite does not
produce obvious symptoms in men.
</P>
<P>
However, Wang said, in women the pest will cause an increase in
vaginal discharge, soreness and inflammation in and around the
vagina. Left untreated, Wang said, it will predispose the women
to HIV infection, and to giving birth before term.
</P>
<P>
Although  this parasite could be easily cured if patients
undertake treatment with their sexual partners, Wang said the
sequencing of the parasite's genome will help scientists to find
the particular gene responsible for the disease caused by the
parasite, and thereby help in the development of preventative
vaccine.
