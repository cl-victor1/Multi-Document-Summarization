An 18-year old student has died of serious complications triggered by
type B influenza, becoming the first case of flu-related death
recorded this year, the Center for Disease Control (CDC) reported
Saturday.

The victim was a Changhua County resident who studied in Kaohsiung
County and started to display symptoms of flu and fever Nov. 26,
according to CDC Deputy Director-General Chou Chih-hao.

Despite medical visits and medication, the patient's symptoms did not
improve and he fell unconscious and was rushed to the hospital Nov.

The hospital reported the patient as a suspected case of SARS Dec. 1
after he was diagnosed with pneumonia, along with shortness of breath
and multiple organ failure, he said.

Chou said the patient died Dec. 3 and test results indicated that he

With Taiwan having entered its annual flu season, 3.83 percent of
patients making outpatient visits over the past week displayed flu-

influenza being most prevalent, Chou said.
