Taipei,  Jan. 11 (CNA) 01/11/07  19:53:43 (By Flor Wang)

Premier Su Tseng-chang called Thursday for a quick law revision
to allow the government to publish the names of major bad loan
holders and urged the Beijing authorities to deport Taiwanese
economic criminals who have fled to China to escape justice.
</P>
<P>
Su made the remarks at a Legislative Yuan meeting in response to
a run on the Chinese Bank that broke out Jan. 5, after two
subsidiaries of their parent company, the Rebar Asia Pacific
Group, filed for bankruptcy protection a day earlier.
</P>
<P>
Pointing out that many Taiwanese economic criminal have taken
refuge in China in the last decade, Su said that Article 48 of
the Banking Law should be modified to provide the government with
the authority to publish the names of individuals or vested
interest groups that fail to pay off huge bank loans.
</P>
<P>
As the Legislative Yuan is slated to review several draft
amendments to the Banking Law Friday, Su appealed to lawmakers to
prioritize the draft law revisions on the agenda.
</P>
<P>
He also expressed the hope that China will help Taiwan detect
economic criminals hiding out there and send them back.
</P>
<P>
The premier also promised that relevant financial supervisory
officials will be strictly dealt with according to the law after
the Chinese Bank run has been fully investigated.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, legislative caucus members of the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) echoed Su's comments at a news conference
held at the Legislative Yuan, saying that they are poised to
promote a law revision to authorize the Financial Supervisory
Commission (FSC) to publish the names of bad borrowers who owe
over NT$30 million to banks.
</P>
<P>
The proposed law amendment will meet the people's expectations
and put such borrowers under public scrutiny, they said.
</P>
<P>
According to DPP Legislator Tang Bi-a, these much-discussed
borrowers include former Tungtex Group Chairman Chen You-hau,
former Legislative Yuan Speaker Liu Sung-fan,  former Pingtung
County Magistrate Wu Tseh-yuan and former KMT lawmaker You Huai-
yin, in addition to Rebar Group Chairman Wang You-theng.
</P>
<P>
Most of these borrowers were big business group owners or held
public office and have fled Taiwan to China, Tang said, adding
that she will ask the FSC publish the names of other borrowers
who owe banks more than NT$30 million and have not repaid their
debts.
</P>
<P>
Yeh Yi-jin, a DPP legislative caucus whip, contented that the FSC
needs to improve its handling of the Chinese Bank run, because
runs still occurred even after the Central Deposit Insurance
Corporation took over the troubled bank and because Rebar Group
Chairman Wang was able to leave the country.
</P>
<P>
Relevant government authorities must provide a clear explanation
to the public over the incident, she added.
