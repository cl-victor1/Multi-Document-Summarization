Three Formosan wild boar nests have been sighted in a major
forestry research area in northern Taiwan over the past two
months, which officials from the Taiwan Forestry Research
Institute (TFRI) claimed Thursday marked the "first sightings" of
the endemic animals in 15 years.
</P>
<P>
The sightings of the nests in the area surrounding the Fu-Shan
Research Station in Yilan County, northeastern Taiwan, marked the
first sightings by TFRI officials since the TFRI closed the
research station in 1991 to allow the environment to regenerate,
the officials said.
</P>
<P>
The sightings indicate that ecological conditions at the Fu-Shan
Research Station -- the jewel in the crown of Taiwan's forestry
research -- have improved significantly over the past 10 years,
the officials said.

Formosan wild boars, an subspecies endemic to Taiwan, have a
large head, small ears, a long snout flanked by a white stripe
along each side, and two sharp narrow tusks growing from their
lower jaw.
</P>
<P>
Formosan wild boars are omnivorous and migratory, moving to lower
elevations when winter comes. They use their narrow snouts and
tusks to dig up the earth in search of food, and in the process,
often destroy cropland -- so that farmers consider them a serious
pest. As they do not have sweat glands, the pigs will often roll
in muddy wetlands near mountain streams to keep cool and get rid
of parasites.
</P>
<P>
They usually inhabit mountainous regions at elevations below
3000m and higher than 700m, including hills, grasslands,
croplands and woodlands.
</P>
<P>
Females give birth to their young in a nest constructed of thin
branches, leaves and wire grass, similar materials used by
Taiwan's early inhabitants to build houses and shelters.
