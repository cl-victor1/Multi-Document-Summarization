London,  Jan. 10 (CNA) 01/11/07  19:05:39 (By Jeniffer Huang and

Taiwan is willing to share with the world its successful
experience of using information and communication technology
(ICT) to narrow the domestic digital divide, visiting Taiwanese
Minister of Education Tu Cheng-sheng said in London Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Tu made the remarks at an international meeting of education
ministers that began Jan. 8 in London, where 183 participants --
including 56 education ministers from nearly 70 countries -- took
part in the three-day event, which is now in its fourth year.
</P>
<P>
Tu said during an interview with the Central News Agency (CNA)
Wednesday that the conference did not just focus on technology
per se, but also discussed innovative applications and their
influences.
</P>
<P>
Tu said the British government deserves recognition for its
vision in education.
</P>
<P>
Tu pointed out that although Taiwan has a prosperous information
industry, there still exists a digital divide between cities and
rural areas.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan's government has attached great importance to solving this
problem, and established digital opportunity centers in 168
remote townships and towns, a measure that has proven highly
effective, the education minister added.
</P>
<P>
He suggested at the meeting that a support mechanism be set up
amongst participating countries, since countries around the world
are facing similar problems.
</P>
<P>
Tu stressed that Taiwan is very willing to share its experience
and to assist other countries.
</P>
<P>
Tu's announcement received high praise and positive responses
from the audience, and the Malawi education minister in
particular spoke to thank Taiwan for its assistance in the
African country's promotion of ICT education.
</P>
<P>
Representatives from Afghanistan, Swaziland, Trinidad-Tobago,
Bahrain, Malaysia, and El Salvador expressed hope of cooperating
with Taiwan in this regard.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Tu also visited local middle and elementary schools to
understand how technology is applied during instruction.
</P>
<P>
Tu said he was especially impressed by the teachers' efforts to
motivate students by using well-designed digital teaching
materials.
</P>
<P>
The minister said that Taiwan, with its sound information
infrastructure and mechanism, should nevertheless learn from UK
teachers and change their teaching styles.
</P>
<P>
Later in the evening, Tu was invited to deliver a speech at the
London School of Economics  and Political Science on Taiwan's
educational reforms and the future of Taiwan.
