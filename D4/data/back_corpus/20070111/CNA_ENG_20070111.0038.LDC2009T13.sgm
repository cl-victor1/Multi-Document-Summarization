President Chen Shui-bian telephoned Premier Su Tseng-chang
Thursday from the capital city of Nicaragua and instructed him to
investigate a recent run on the Chinese Bank and hold any
government officials in charge accountable.
</P>
<P>
Chen told Su to fully investigate the incident that has shaken
Taiwan's financial market and disturbed the public's confidence.
He also made it clear that relevant financial regulatory
officials must assume full responsibility for the run.
</P>
<P>
Chen is visiting Nicaragua to attend the inauguration  of
President Daniel Ortega. He is slated to return to Taiwan Jan.
12.

<P>
Chen Ching-jun, a legislative caucus whip of the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), expressed concern that the
government's mechanisms and officials' ability to fend off such
irregularities have become useless.
</P>
<P>
Saying that "government incompetence is even worse than official
corruption, " Chen questioned why the government authorities and
officials in charge were blind to the irregularities occurring in
the Chinese Bank, an operation unit affiliated to the Rebar Asia
Pacific Group, before the run broke out Jan. 5.
</P>
<P>
"How could Rebar Group Chairman Wang You-theng and his wife have
been able to flee to China before the run began?" he asked.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the number of customers rushing to withdraw their
deposits from the Chinese Bank had dropped Thursday after the
Central Deposit Insurance Corporation (CDIC) took over the bank
Monday and promised to reimburse all customers.
</P>
<P>
Bank executives said they are hopeful that the run will end now
that the CDIC has stationed officials at the bank.
