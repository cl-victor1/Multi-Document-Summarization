KMT EXPELS REBAR GROUP FOUNDER OVER FINANCIAL SCANDALS
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,   Jan.  11  (CNA) 01/11/07  20:25:41 (By Y.F. Low)

The opposition Kuomintang's (KMT's) Evaluation and Discipline
Committee expelled Rebar Asia Pacific Group founder Wang You-
theng Thursday over his alleged role in a series of financial
scandals within the business group.
</P>
<P>
The committee also decided to expel China Rebar Co. Chairwoman
Wang Chin Shih- ying -- Wang's wife -- and to suspend the
membership rights of Union Insurance Co. President Wang Shih-chan
-- Wang's younger brother. Both companies are subsidiaries of the
Rebar Group.
</P>
<P>
Luan Kang-meng, head of the committee, said the KMT took the
measure because their "irresponsible conduct" and "wrongdoing"
have seriously impacted the party's image.
</P>
<P>
Luan said the KMT will seek to contact the Beijing authorities to
get Wang You- theng and Wang Chin Shih-ying -- both of whom fled
to China before the scandals broke -- returned to Taiwan to face
investigation.
</P>
<P>
Their alleged crimes involve breach of trust, forgery, fraud,
insider trading, embezzlement of corporate funds and violations
of the banking law and accounting regulations.
</P>
<P>
The KMT made the move the same day prosecutors detained Wang
Shih-chan as part of their investigation into the scandals, which
came to light last week after the group's China Rebar Co. and
Chia Hsin Food &amp; Synthetic Fiber Co. petitioned with the
court for insolvency reorganization, triggering a run on The
Chinese Bank, another Rebar affiliate.
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors have forbidden 47 Rebar group executives and Wang
family members from leaving the country following a search of
Rebar headquarters and other subsidiary offices and seizure of
key evidence unfavorable to those who stand accused.
</P>
<P>
In addition to Wang Shih-chan, Chia Hsin Food &amp; Synthetic
Fiber Co. President Wang Ling-yi -- one of Wang You-theng's sons
-- was also detained by prosecutors that day.
