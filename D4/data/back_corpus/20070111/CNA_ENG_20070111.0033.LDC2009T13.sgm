Small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) proteins have been
discovered to play an important role in germ- cell meiosis,
malfunctions that might lead to Down syndrome and miscarriage or
sterility, sources at Academia Sinica said Thursday.

Other independent research at the institute shows another new
aspect of SUMO's function. The researchers found that Daxx, a
transcriptional corepressor, would target proteins modified by
SUMO and seek combination with them, which would inhibit normal
gene expressions and lead to leukemia.

The first study was conducted by the Academia Sinica's Institute
of Biological Chemistry and the findings have already been
published by U.S.-based journal Genes &amp; Development last
August.

The second research was done by the Institute of Biomedical
Sciences and the science journal Molecular Cell published the
paper in its November issue.

Wang Ting-fang, an assistant researcher at the Institute of
Biological Chemistry, explained that in the process of meiosis,
SUMO can modify and connect chromosomes to facilitate DNA
exchanges. However, if SUMO fails to carry out its function, that
would result in underdeveloped embryos -- most of which would die
but a few of which would develop into children with Down
syndrome.

As for the other research,  Shih Hsiu-ming,  an associate
researcher at the Institute of Biomedical Sciences, said that
under normal circumstances, white blood cells should divide and
reproduce. However, when SUMO-modified proteins are connected
with Daxx, the genetic expression is inhibited and leukocytes
lose their normal function, leading to leukemia.
