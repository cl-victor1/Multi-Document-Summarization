Kinmen Garrison Command warned Wednesday that fishing boats
should steer clear of waters near the Tsaoyu Islet northeast of
the outlying island of Kinmen during daylight hours from now
until Feb. 15 to avoid danger from an operation to dispose of
obsolete ammunition.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the command said the operation, undertaken by a
brigade in eastern Kinmen, will destroy unsafe, unserviceable and
obsolete ammunition by burning and detonation on open sites from
6 a.m. to 4 p.m. everyday until Feb. 15.
</P>
<P>
He said blasts could project shrapnel up to a height of 2,000
meters and may pose a danger to fishing boats operating in nearby
waters.

<P>
The spokesman warned owners of fishing boats from both Kinmen,
adjacent islets and China's Xiamen port across the Taiwan Strait
to avoid the waters near the Tsaoyu Islet during the operation.
