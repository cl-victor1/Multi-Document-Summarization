SCAM

New York, Jan. 23 (CNA) 01/24/07  13:01:02 (By Jaw-pyng Hwang and

U.S. Treasury Department officials have begun monitoring the
operations of Omni Bank in California at the request of Taiwan's
finance officials amid the snowballing Rebar Asia Pacific Group
scandal.
</P>
<P>
Officials  from the Treasury  Department's  Office  of the
Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) said Tuesday that the office
has so far found no signs of a bank run or money-laundering at
any of the three branches or headquarters of Omni Bank, in which
the family members of scandal-ridden Rebar group founder Wang
You-theng and his wife Chin Shih-ying reportedly hold a
96-percent stake.
</P>
<P>
OCC officials said the office will take no action on Omni Bank
until Wang Ling- hsing -- chairman of Omni Bank and elder son of
Chin Shih-ying -- and Wang Ling- chiao -- an Ommi Bank board
director and second son of Chin -- are formally indicted by
Taiwan prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
The OCC will take legal action against the Wang brothers -- at
least one of whom is a U.S. citizen -- when the "appropriateness"
of their being executives of the U.S.-based bank is considered by
the OCC as "in doubt," the OCC officials said.
</P>
<P>
The Wang brothers' mother, Chin Shih-ying, had quit her post as a
vice chairwoman of Omni Bank soon after the Rebar financial
scandal erupted in early January.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan's judicial and financial authorities have been in contact
with their U.S. counterparts concerning the investigations into
the Rebar scandal for assistance in the probe into the financial
status and personal assets in the United States of Rebar group
founder Wang and his wife, as well as into whether there are any
connections between the Rebar group and the California-based Ommi
Bank.
</P>
<P>
Omni Bank --  headquartered  in Alhambra,  California  was
established in 1979. It was acquired by the Wang family in 1990.
Omni Bank currently maintains three branches in San Jose,
Monterey Park and Roland Height.
</P>
<P>
Wang You-theng and Chin Shih-ying are at the center of the
snowballing financial scandal and are believed to have stolen
billions of dollars in corporate funds before going on the lam.
They have been placed on Taiwan's most-wanted list and stand
accused of embezzlement, insider trading, fraud and breach of
trust.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan and U.S. authorities have been communicating in accordance
with a Taiwan-U.S. judicial assistance accord signed in March
2002, under which the two sides can help each other in the
obtaining of witness testimonies, delivery of legal documents,
ascertaining of the identities of criminal suspects and their
whereabouts, as well as the search and impounding of evidence and
freezing of assets of those who stand accused.
</P>
<P>
Under that accord, Taiwan can ask the United States to help
investigate the whereabouts and assets of Wang and Chin there but
must respect the decisions and considerations that the U.S. side
makes. Taiwan does not know yet how the U.S. authorities will
choose to handle the case, according to a Ministry of Foreign
Affairs (MOFA) official.
</P>
<P>
Wang and Chin fled Taiwan to China Dec. 30, one day after two
Rebar subsidiary companies applied for insolvency protection,
which in turn triggered a run on the Chinese Bank, another Rebar
affiliate corporation.
</P>
<P>
After the Wangs reportedly flew to San Francisco Jan. 13, the
Taipei Prosecutor's Office issued wanted notices for the couple
Jan. 15 which will remain valid for 25 years, followed by a MOFA
move that invalidated their Republic of China passports.
</P>
<P>
According to the MOFA official, the U.S. judicial officials have
answered the Taiwan authorities, saying that Taiwan should
provide documents and evidence indicating that the Wangs have
committed crimes, including fraud, money- laundering and insider
trading, if they want any help from the United States.
