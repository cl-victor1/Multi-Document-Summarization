MND URGES LEGISLATIVE SUPPORT FOR DEFENSE BUDGET
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taipei,  Jan. 23 (CNA) 01/24/07  12:22:54 (By Sofia Wu)
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of National Defense (MND) has stepped up efforts to
urge the legislature to support increasing the defense budget to
finance major military procurement projects in the face of
China's mounting military threat.
</P>
<P>
As part of the campaign, the MND held a news conference Tuesday
to elaborate on China's intensified military buildup and reminded
lawmakers from across the political spectrum of the importance of
passing the government's defense budget for 2007 during the
planned extra legislative session.
</P>
<P>
Aided by China's fast growing economic clout, the People's
Liberation  Army's naval  and  airborne  combat  capabilities,
particularly its space and undersea capabilities, have grown by
leaps and bounds in recent years, threatening to tilt the
regional military balance and causing grave concerns among
neighboring countries, Tung Hsiang-lung, director of the MND's
training and standard development department, said at the start
of the news conference.
</P>
<P>
In the standoff with China, Tung said, Taiwan may lose its
qualitative edge if it fails to accelerate its military
modernization and establish an elite deterrent force.
</P>
<P>
While the Executive  Yuan has earmarked  NT$323.4  billion
(US$9.8 billion) for defense purposes in its 2007 budget plan,
Tung lamented that the Legislative Yuan's Defense Committee not
only slashed NT$18.5 billion but also proposed freezing NT$22.7
billion of the defense budget during the budget bill's first
reading in the just-concluded legislative session.
</P>
<P>
He said the committee's move, if maintained in the subsequent
screening during the plenary session, would gravely hobble
execution of the MND's major military procurement projects aimed
at upgrading the country's arsenal.
</P>
<P>
Tung was referring to the three long-stalled military procurement
projects -- eight diesel-electric submarines, six Patriot PAC III
anti-missile batteries and a squadron of 12 P-3C submarine-
hunting aircraft.
</P>
<P>
If the three procurement projects falter, Tung warned, the
China/Taiwan military strength ratio will widen to 2.8 to 1
between 2020 and 2035, which he claimed could tempt China into
trying to take Taiwan by force.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the commissioning of four U.S.-built Keelung-class
destroyers, formerly known as Kidd-class destroyers, into service
last year has helped narrow the China/Taiwan military power ratio
to 1.43 to 1 from 1.53 to 1 for the period from 1995 through
2005, Tung said investment in advanced weaponry systems will
contribute to the advancement of the country's military muscle
while slowing a further tipping in China's favor of the cross-
Taiwan Strait military balance.
</P>
<P>
If all the three procurement projects are carried through, Tung
said, Taiwan's combat capabilities will be largely reinforced and
upgraded, particularly after the projected commissioning of the
eight submarines into service in 2017.
</P>
<P>
Tung  further  said  he  believes  that  acquisition  of state-
of-the-art weaponry systems could be an effective deterrence and
thus prevent a cross- strait conflict.
</P>
<P>
Over the past decade, Tung continued, the country's defense
budget has invariably hovered around NT$260 billion with defense
spending as a percentage of gross domestic product (GDP)
declining steadily to 2.17 percent in 2006.
</P>
<P>
With the Executive Yuan's approval, Tung said, this year's
defense budget share has been raised to 2.85 percent of GDP. In
addition to the three big-ticket weaponry procurement projects,
the budget bill also includes funds needed for procuring advanced
F-16C/D jet fighters to cope with a possible tilting in air
supremacy in favor of China from 2008.
</P>
<P>
Pointing out that the United States agreed to sell eight
conventional submarines to Taiwan only after 20 years of
intensive lobbying  and planning  by Taiwan, Tung said  he hopes
the opposition-controlled legislature can speed up passage of the
budget bill.
</P>
<P>
"Otherwise, the deal could be aborted due to Taiwan's long delay.
Should that be the case, the cross-strait military balance would
quickly tilt in China's favor," Tung cautioned.
</P>
<P>
The news conference, chaired by the MND's Political Warfare
Bureau Director Gen. Wu Ta-peng, came amid reports of China's
anti-satellite test and deployment of its advanced Jian-10 jet
fighters at an air base approximately 500 kilometers from Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Several senior intelligence officers at the MND, including Maj.
Gen. Wang Cheng- hsiao, were also present at the news conference.
</P>
<P>
Wang said China's actions in developing space weaponry and
deploying more ballistic missiles targeting Taiwan are
endangering regional peace.
</P>
<P>
Wang also confirmed reports that Beijing has built up a huge
arsenal of missiles facing Taiwan, up from 190 ballistic missiles
in 1996.
</P>
<P>
"China has stockpiled 880 ballistic missiles and more than 100
cruise missiles, placing the whole of Taiwan within their range,
" Wang said, adding that these missiles "pose a serious threat to
Taiwan."
</P>
<P>
Taiwan has deployed  three U.S.-made  Patriot  anti-missile
batteries to defend the densely populated greater Taipei area,
and it is seeking to purchase more to shield the entire island.
</P>
<P>
Wang also called attention to the fact that China's military has
recently added about 60 J-10 aircraft, whose combat capabilities
are tipped to be on par with those of the F-16 A/Bs used by
Taiwan's Air Force.
</P>
<P>
"Armed with these airplanes, as well as Russian-built Su-27s and
Su-30s fighters, China will have supremacy over Taiwan in the
air, " he warned.
