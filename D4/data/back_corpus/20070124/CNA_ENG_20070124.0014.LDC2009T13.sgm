The Ministry of National Defense is planning to recruit some
15,000 young people, including about 3,000 young women, this year
to serve voluntarily in the military, defense ministry sources
said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Officials from the defense ministry's talent recruitment center
said that the ministry intends to recruit 15,153 young people,
including 2,928 women, this year.
</P>
<P>
Center officials said owing to the enthusiastic response, the
center met its target for volunteer soldier recruitment in 2005,
the first year of the program, which is part of the nation's
ambitious military modernization project.
</P>
<P>
The center reached 95 percent of its target for 2006, the
officials said.
</P>
<P>
The defense ministry began to recruit women to serve as volunteer
soldiers in 2006, a practice which ministry officials said that
not only expands and diversifies the channels for the military to
acquire talented people but also provides opportunities for young
women to bring their talent into full play in the military.
</P>
<P>
Volunteer privates will receive a monthly wage of NT$27,105
(US$826) and various stipends, and they will have half the amount
of their water and electricity bills covered during the period of
their service. After they complete their military service, they
are eligible for a pension, and government agencies will assist
them in gaining professional licenses related to their training
in the military.
</P>
<P>
Under a conscription system reform program,  the mandatory
military service period has been shortened from the previous 22
months to 14 months, while recruitment of volunteer soldiers will
be accelerated in the years to come.
</P>
<P>
It is hoped that volunteers rather than conscripts will gradually
form the bulk of the nation's armed forces, defense ministry
officials said.
