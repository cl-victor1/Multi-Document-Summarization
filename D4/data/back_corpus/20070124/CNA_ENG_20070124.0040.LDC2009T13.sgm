<P>
Certified and traceable agricultural products will go on sale in
June and from next year, they will be available in all major
supermarket and hypermarket chains around Taiwan, the Cabinet-
level Council of Agriculture (COA) said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
COA officials made the announcement at a press conference on the
achievements and prospects of a campaign the council launched
last year.
</P>
<P>
Previously, the COA implemented a traceability system to manage
information related to individual agricultural products on a
trial basis.
</P>
<P>
The officials said the council is planning to include 125 items
of agricultural, fishery, and livestock products as part of the
Taiwan Good Agricultural Practice (TGAP) by the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
The COA has commissioned the internationally authorized Taiwan
Accreditation Foundation to take charge of accrediting
certification institutions.
</P>
<P>
It is expected that Taiwan will have the first accredited
certification institution in April or May and that the number
will increase to eight by the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
In addition, foreign agricultural products that are labeled as
organic products will be covered by a domestic law within two
years governing the production of agricultural products and
certification management.
