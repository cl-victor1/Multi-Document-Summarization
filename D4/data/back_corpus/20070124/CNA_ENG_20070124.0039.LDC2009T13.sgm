The Water Resources Agency (WRA) under the Ministry of Economic
Affairs began a two-day seminar on environmental protection and
sustainable growth Wednesday on the outlying island of Kinmen,
with experts and representatives from around Taiwan attending the
seminar.
</P>
<P>
WRA Deputy Director Wu Yueh-hsi presided over the meeting and
hailed the Kinmen authorities' forest and water resource
conservation efforts in the opening ceremony, which was also
attended by more than 70 representatives from across the country,
including experts from 12 aboriginal tribes and local government
officials.
</P>
<P>
Wu encouraged other city and county authorities to follow the
good example set by Kinmen in its environmental protection
despite the fact that the outlying island county lacks abundant
soil and sufficient rain and is buffeted by strong winds in
autumn and winter.
</P>
<P>
Compared to the rest of the country, rainfall on Kinmen averaged
only 1,047 centimeters per year, far behind the average of 2,467
centimeters for other regions, Wu pointed out.
</P>
<P>
As water resources are key to any country's sustainable growth,
it is a top priority for governments at all levels to dedicate
their energy to conservation and environmental protection, Wu
said.
</P>
<P>
Kinmen Deputy Magistrate Yang Chuan-chung welcomed all the water
resources activists and officials and called for more frequent
and in-depth exchanges of opinions and experience  on eco-
friendly activities.
</P>
<P>
Yang took pride in Kinmen's forestry success but still expressed
his desire to learn from exchanges with other city and county
authorities.
</P>
<P>
Kinmen county government officials are slated to give a series of
reports on forestry, river and reservoir rehabilitation and
national conservation projects in the second-day meeting
Thursday.
