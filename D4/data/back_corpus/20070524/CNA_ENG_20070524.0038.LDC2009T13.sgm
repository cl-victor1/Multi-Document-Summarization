MAMMUTHUS FOSSIL DISCOVERED IN CENTRAL TAIWAN

<P>
Fossil remains of the once-indigenous mammuthus -- a species of
prehistoric elephant -- have been unearthed for the first time in
central Taiwan by an amateur archaeologist at the Taichung
Mountainview  Community University,  local sources reported
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The fossil -- part of an upper molar tooth -- belonged to a
newborn calf that lived in the area around Shih-kang village in
Taichung County some 1.6 million years to 2.2 million years ago,
they said.
</P>
<P>
Mammuthus fossils were first found in 1961 in a village in the
southern county of Tainan. The mammuthus was dubbed initially the
"ancient Taiwan elephant" but officially renamed the "grassland
mammuthus" last year.
</P>
<P>
No mammuthus fossils had previously ever been found other than in
Tainan, and the finding in Taichung gives new evidence as to the
possible distribution of the animal.
</P>
<P>
The molar fossil, along with other 1,000 pieces, is being
exhibited at the Hakka Culture Hall in Shih-kang village until
June 30.
