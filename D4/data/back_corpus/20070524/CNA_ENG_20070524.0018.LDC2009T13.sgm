Defense Minister Lee Tien-yu confirmed Thursday that beginning
July 1, members of the country's armed forces will follow a
simplified "three convictions" as their spiritual and behavioral
guidance.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of National Defense recently worked to simplify the
"five convictions" -- doctrine, leadership, nation,
responsibility and honor -- that have been followed by the
Republic of China armed forces for over six decades. The ministry
decided to omit the notions of "doctrine" and "leadership" on the
grounds that the two are already enshrined in the Constitution
and the National Defense Act, Lee said.
</P>
<P>
Speaking for the first time at the Legislative Yuan as the
defense minister, Lee also confirmed that he indeed met with
President Chen Shui-bian at the president's residence May 17 for
an hour-long talk.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Lee said, the president talked with him about
the need for Taiwan to purchase F-16 jet fighters from the United
States, in addition to discussing his new position.
</P>
<P>
According to Lee, the president expressed to him the hope that he
will strive to dissolve the differences between the Democratic
Progressive Party administration and opposition parties over the
long-stalled arms procurement plan.
</P>
<P>
Lee said that the president told him that his top task after
assuming the post of defense minister will be to upgrade the
armed forces' defense capabilities through the purchase of new
weapon systems and equipment.
