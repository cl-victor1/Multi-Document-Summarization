SURVEY REVEALS MOSS AND LIVERWORT SPECIES DIVERSITY IN TAIWAN

Mosses and liverworts are everywhere in Taiwan, adding color and
interest to both the most mundane and the most extreme of
habitats.
</P>
<P>
A two-year flora resources survey by a research team at the
Council of Agriculture's Endemic Species Research Institute has
revealed that Taiwan is home to a wide variety of moss and
liverwort species, with more than 1,500 different species being
recorded.
</P>
<P>
Some of those species are rare in the world, and several others
are limited to only a few regions, often geographically distant
from one another, a research team member said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
According to Yang Chia-tung, the institute launched a six-year
moss and liverwort species survey project in 2005, with the first
phase of the research being completed recently.
</P>
<P>
Over the past two years, Yang said, the research team has
collected more than 3,000 moss and liverwort specimens. An
analysis of those samples reveals that Taiwan has more than 1,500
moss and liverwort species, comparable to the number documented
in Japan, which is famous for its flora conservation in the
international community, Yang said.
</P>
<P>
A more encouraging finding is that Taiwan possesses 300 moss and
liverwort species that are hailed by global botanists as rare
species, Yang said, adding that 150 of them are endemic only to
Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
As Taiwan's land area is only a quarter of that of Japan, Yang
said, Taiwan ranks near the top of the world list in terms of
moss and liverwort diversity and density.
</P>
<P>
Mosses and liverworts are collectively known as Bryophytes. They
are usually green and small,  and are among the simplest of land-
dwelling plants. Only a few are aquatic. They lack some of the
complex structures seen in other types of plant -- for example,
they do not produce flowers or seeds, and most have no internal
means for transporting water or nutrients. Most are confined to
areas which are damp and sheltered.
</P>
<P>
In the modern world, Yang said, the economic uses of mosses and
liverworts are not immediately obvious. "But they have an
important and subtle ecological role, both in water-retention and
stabilization of mobile surfaces, like landslips, scree slopes
and sand dunes, " he explained.
</P>
<P>
Examination of any handful of moss will also reveal another
important ecological role -- that of providing shelter and
humidity for a remarkable diversity of invertebrates, Yang said,
adding that this is an integral part of the food web in many
important habitats.
</P>
<P>
Among the rare moss species found in Taiwan is Riccio carpos,
Yang said. In most areas around the world, this strain can now
only grow in greenhouses with attentive care. The species is
found in the wild in wetlands in Nantou County's Puli township in
central Taiwan where water rice, or Zizania latifolia, is grown.
</P>
<P>
An even more precious liverwort species is Takaki, which has been
flourishing at the north peak of Jade Mountain in central Taiwan
at an elevation of more 3,000 meters. Takaki is reputed as a
living fossil as it has existed for tens of millions of years.
The species can now only be found in a very few highland regions
in the world, Yang said.
</P>
<P>
Another rare liverwort species that can still be found at certain
mountainous localities is Lejeuneaceae, which usually grows on
tree leaves, Yang said.
</P>
<P>
With its abundance in moss and liverwort species, Taiwan has
emerged as a "hot spot" for Bryophytes study and appreciation,
Yang said. A botanical garden in the U.S. state of Missouri sent
research fellows to Taiwan last year. They managed to bring home
more than 400 moss and liverwort specimens for display at their
exhibition hall.
</P>
<P>
"Many nature science museums in Japan have also sent personnel to
Taiwan to collect moss and liverwort specimens, and they have
often been amazed by Taiwan's biodiversity," Yang said.
</P>
<P>
In contrast, Yang said, local people do not seem as fully aware
of this Taiwan treasure. As a matter of fact, he said, industrial
development, air and water pollution, as well as global warming
are threatening the survival of many moss and liverwort species.
</P>
<P>
According to Yang, the Council of Agriculture is planning to
review its Red Book of threatened wildlife species next year, and
certain rare moss and liverwort species are likely to be
included.
