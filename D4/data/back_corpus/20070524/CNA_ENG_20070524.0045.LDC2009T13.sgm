Former President Lee Teng-hui will leave for Japan May 30 for an
11-day visit during which he will visit Tokyo and give speeches
in academic exchanges for the first time since leaving the
Presidential Office, an organizer said Thursday.

<P>
The president of Japan's Akita International University, Mineo
Nakajima, who drafted Lee's itinerary in Japan, said his schedule
has been decided but might change according to his physical
condition.
</P>
<P>
Nakajima said Lee has named his visit a "trip of Okunohosomichi,"
since he will follow the route of a journey taken by Basho
Matsuo, a Japanese haiku poet who wrote poems based on the
journey known as Okunohosomichi in the 17th Century.

<P>
According to Nakajima, Lee will arrive at Narita Airport May 30
accompanied by his family and will visit the Basho Memorial
Museum May 31.

He will begin his "Okunohosomichi trip" June 1 and will visit
many scenic places, temples and universities en route. He will
also give speeches at Akita International University and at a
Tokyo hotel before returning to Taipei June 9, Nakajima said.
