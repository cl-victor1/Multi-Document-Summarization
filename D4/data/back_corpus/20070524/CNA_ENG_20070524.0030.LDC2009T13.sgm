ECONOMICS MINISTER WARNS OF LEGISLATION ON CO2 EMISSIONS
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  May 24 (CNA) 05/24/07  18:37:54 (By Flor Wang)

"Precipitous" legislation on setting limits on Taiwan's  carbon
dioxide emissions  will hinder investment willingness and
employment, Minister of Economic Affairs Steve R. L. Chen said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Chen made the remarks while giving a keynote speech on the impact
of global warming on Taiwan's  industry  and the government's
countermeasures after a draft law requiring Taiwan's CO2
emissions level for the 2025-2030 period to be reduced to the
2005 level recently passed initial screening at the Legislative
Yuan.
</P>
<P>
Stating his opposition to the draft law, Chen said that hasty
legislation will negatively affect investment and job creation.
</P>
<P>
Currently, Taiwan produces some 4 million metric tons of carbon
dioxide every year even without major investment projects in
place, Chen said.
</P>
<P>
If the country's annual CO2 emissions level is fixed below the
2005 level, it would mean that industrial development would be
strictly restricted or businesses forced to relocate out of
Taiwan, Chen said,  adding that this would lead to further
economic slugnishness and fewer jobs.
</P>
<P>
According to Chen, the government has since late 2005 been
implementing a campaign to assist companies with energy-effective
and industrial upgrading programs amid worldwide efforts to
reduce the greenhouse effect and global warming.
</P>
<P>
Thomas M.F. Yeh, vice chairman of the Cabinet-level Council for
Economic Planning and Development, said that Taiwan registered an
average increase rate of 5.85 percent in CO2 emissions per year
during the 1990-2005 period, higher than its average annual
economic growth rate of 5.36 percent.
</P>
<P>
As Taiwan is not a signatory of the Kyoto protocol, a law
limiting the country's greenhouse gas emissions would affect the
country's competitive edge, Yeh said.
</P>
<P>
Wang Tu-fa, a lawmaker of the ruling Democratic Progressive
Party, accused the government of turning a blind eye to Taiwan's
rising CO2 emissions despite a cutting-emissions drive that fails
to even bother to mention its reduction goal to local industry.
