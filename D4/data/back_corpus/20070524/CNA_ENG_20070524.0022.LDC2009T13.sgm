The Cabinet will continue with and strengthen the second phase of
financial reforms to enhance the competitiveness of domestic
financial institutions and stabilize the country's financial
market, a Cabinet official said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Executive Yuan Secretary-General Chen Chin-jun said that the
direction of the reforms is correct and that the Cabinet will
refer to the conclusions  of the conference on economic
sustainable development held last year in carrying out the
reforms.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, President Chen Shui-bian stressed the necessity for
the government to continue pushing forward with the second phase
of financial reforms, although he admitted there are many aspects
of the reforms that require improvement.
</P>
<P>
Repeating the objectives of the reforms, the president said the
government will help at least three financial institutions to
grab a market  share of at least 10 percent,  halve the number
of publicly-owned banks to six, halve the number of financial
holding companies to seven, and help at least one financial
institution to list their shares on overseas stock markets or be
operated by a foreign owner.
</P>
<P>
According to Chen Chin-jun, most of these objectives have been
attained.
</P>
<P>
Chen said that while the merger of Taiwan Cooperative Bank (TCB)
with Farmers Bank of China has boosted the market share of TCB to
above 10 percent, the scheduled merger of Bank of Taiwan with
Central Trust of China in July is expected to have a similar
effect.
</P>
<P>
On the efforts to reduce the number of publicly-owned banks, Chen
said seven out of the total of 12 publicly-owned banks have
merged or will be merged with other banks, namely Mega
International Commercial Bank, Hua Nan Commercial Bank, First
Commercial Bank, Bank of Taiwan, Land Bank of Taiwan, Taiwan
Cooperative Bank and Taiwan Business Bank.
</P>
<P>
On the efforts to half the number of financial holding companies,
Chen said the government will provide various incentives to
encourage merger of privately- owned financial holding companies.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, on the foreign ownership of domestic banks, Standard
Chartered Bank has bought out Hsinchu International Bank, while
Citibank has also announced its plan to buy out Bank of Overseas
Chinese, Chen said.
