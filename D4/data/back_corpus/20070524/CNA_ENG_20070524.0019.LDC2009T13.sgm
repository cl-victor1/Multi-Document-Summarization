IMMIGRANT REPS DEMAND REPLACEMENT OF IMMIGRATION AGENCY HAED

Dozens of representatives of new immigrants and human rights
activists petitioned the Executive Yuan Thursday to replace
National Immigration Agency (NIA)  Director General Wu Chen-chi,
accusing him of incompetence.
</P>
<P>
The group of protesters gathered at the Executive Yuan, claiming
that NIA inspectors often harass new immigrant families in a way
that display their disrespect for the human rights of new
immigrants.
</P>
<P>
Commissioned to crack down on illegal employment of foreigners
and marriages of convenience, NIA inspectors have the power to
stop any new immigrants on the street for questioning and to
enter the homes of new immigrants without appointment for
surprise checks, according to Wu Chia-pei, vice chairwoman of the
Taiwan Association for Human rights.
</P>
<P>
Claiming that the human rights of new immigrants are not properly
protected, Wu said several civil groups, including her
association, have drafted their own version of amendment to the
Immigration Act to strengthen human rights protection.
</P>
<P>
However, Wu claimed that both the Ministry of the Interior and
the NIA, appearing reluctant to accept that, have expressed they
will only accept parts of the proposed articles in the amendment.
</P>
<P>
NIA Secretary-General Ho Jung-tsun accepted the petition on
behalf of his boss but declined to make any comment.
</P>
<P>
Wu said that if their petition fails to receive a positive
response from the government authorities, they will organize
larger protest rallies or marches.
</P>
<P>
Beginning in the late 1990s, an increase in the number of
marriages between Taiwan nationals and foreign citizens has led
to an influx of new immigrants into Taiwan. Most of them come
from China, Vietnam, Indonesia or Thailand. People in this group
are referred to as new immigrants, to distinguish them from those
who came to the country after 1949 or even earlier.
