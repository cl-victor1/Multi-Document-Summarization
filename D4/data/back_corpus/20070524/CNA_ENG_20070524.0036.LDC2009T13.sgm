medical care center and listed 10 areas in which Taiwan could
have a competitive edge.

They are live liver  transplant,  bone marrow  transplant,
cardiovascular medicine, microsurgery and cosmetic surgery,
breast magnetic resonance imaging and other advanced medical
examinations, knee surgery,  brain  tumor medicine and immunology

one of its flagship projects in its three-year economic
