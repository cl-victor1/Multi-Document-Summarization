COSTA RICA NOT CONSIDERING CHANGING TIES WITH TAIWAN: OFFICIAL
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
San  Jose,  Costa  Rica,  May  23  (CNA) 05/24/07  10:10:50 (By
Ramon Huang and Sofia Wu)
</P>
<P>
Costa Rica has never considered changing its longstanding
diplomatic relations with the Republic of China, Costa Rican
acting Foreign Minister Edgar Ugalde Alvarez said Wednesday in an
interview with CNA.
</P>
<P>
Ugalde further said that Costa Rica has maintained cordial
diplomatic ties with Taiwan for more than 60 years and that
bilateral relations have continued growing steadily.
</P>
<P>
Nothing that Costa Rica has done warrants Taiwan's suspicion of
its motivations, according to Ugalde.
</P>
<P>
Noting that all bilateral cooperative projects have been very
conducive to Costa Rica's national development, Ugalde said Costa
Rica has never had any complaints or discontent. Stressing that
Costa Rica is grateful for Taiwan's aid, he said any report about
Costa Rica's dissatisfaction  with Taiwan's  aid projects  are
sheer speculation.
</P>
<P>
On behalf of Costa Rican Foreign Minister Bruno Stagno who is
currently on a diplomatic tour of Europe, Ugale will soon head
for Belize to attend the May 25 meeting with ROC Foreign Minister
James Huang and counterparts from Taiwan's allies in the region.
</P>
<P>
He further clarified his country's stance on Taiwan's bid to join
the World Health Organization (WHO) , claiming that his country
has never opposed Taiwan's WHO membership bid.
</P>
<P>
In a May 14 at the WHO headquarters in Geneva, Costa Rica
unexpectedly voted against the proposal initiated by Taiwan's
other allies to include Taiwan's WHO membership bid on the agenda
of the ongoing World Health Assembly (WHA) -- the WHO's decision-
making arm.
</P>
<P>
Ugalde argued that what Cost Rica opposed was "rearrangement of
the WHA meeting agenda, " not Taiwan's WHO entry. "We did not
want to see the annual conference paralyzed by a change of the
agenda, therefore we opposed the proposal," he said.
</P>
<P>
Ugalde also expressed dissatisfaction about Taiwan's failure to
explain its stance to its allies before it filed an application
for WHO membership.
</P>
<P>
Over the past decade, he said, Taiwan has applied to join the WHA
as an observer. This year, Taiwan applied for WHO full membership
under the name of Taiwan. As this was a significant change, he
said, Taiwan should have discussed its stance with its allies in
advance. "Without prior discussion, misunderstanding arose
between Taiwan and its allies, " he said.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the Costa Rican government explained in a news
statement issued last week that its policy on Taiwan's fight for
equal health rights for its people is similar to that of the
United States, Japan, the European Union, Ugalde said Costa
Rica's support for Taiwan's equal health rights is beyond doubt
and unswerving.
</P>
<P>
He also denied any correlation between Costa Rica's bid to become
a non- permanent member of the U.N. Security Council next year
and its vote on Taiwan's membership in a major international
organization.
