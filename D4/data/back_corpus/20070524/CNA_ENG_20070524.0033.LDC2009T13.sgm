Over half of the respondents to a recent poll are opposed to the
idea of toppling the new Cabinet headed by Premier Chang Chun-
hsiung, according to the results of the survey published by the
ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) Thursday.
</P>
<P>
In comparison, only 24 percent are in favor of toppling Chang's
Cabinet, the poll found.
</P>
<P>
The poll came amid reports that the opposition People First Party
(PFP) is mulling whether to topple Chang's Cabinet. The PFP
regards him as incompetent, noting that Chang, who served as
premier 2000-2001, was declared persona non grata in the
Legislative Yuan in the wake of his announcement of the
suspension of the construction of the fourth nuclear power plant
in late 2000, which caused billions of dollars-worth of losses
for the nation.
</P>
<P>
If the opposition does propose the toppling of the Cabinet, 40
percent of the respondents said they would be in favor of
dissolving the legislature, compared with 42.3 percent who
expressed opposition to the idea.
</P>
<P>
According to the DPP poll results, the party's approval rating
has climbed to a new high in recent years, lagging behind that of
the Kuomintang by 4 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
The approval rating for the KMT was 32.1 percent, leading all
other parties, followed by the DPP at 28.1 percent, the Taiwan
Solidarity Union at 3.8 percent and the PFP at 2.8 percent,
according to the poll results.
</P>
<P>
In a similar survey conducted by the DPP early this year, the
approval rating for the party was only 19.1 precent, lagging
behind the KMT by 24 percent.
</P>
<P>
The DPP conducted the survey by phone May 22. A total of 873
effective samples were collected with a margin of error of 3.4
percentage points.
