Taipei,  May 24 (CNA) 05/24/07  18:26:24 (By Elizabeth Hsu)

The National Police Agency (NPA) deployed four more bodyguards
two weeks ago to protect the safety of two presidential
candidates, as each of them had been guarded by only two NPA
personnel since being named to run in the 2008 election, NPA
Director-General Hou Yu-ih said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
As a result, Frank Hsieh of the ruling Democratic Progressive
Party and Ma Ying- jeou of the opposition Kuomintang now each
have protection from four NPA security guards, Hou said in
response to media inquiries after a Taipei county councilor's
murder triggered politicians' concerns over their own safety.

<P>
Talking about the shooting of County Councilor Wu Shan-chiu of
the opposition People First Party, who was killed by a lone
gunman at his service office Wednesday, Hou said a task force has
been organized to investigate the case.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that as the case looks to be an assassination,
police are trying to find out whether the shooting was related to
Wu's recent work that had brought to light collusion over illegal
gravel and sand trading.
</P>
<P>
Asked whether the gunman is a hired assassin from overseas, Hou
said efforts are still underway to identify the killer, and that
in an attempt to block the man from sneaking out of the country,
security at all airports and ports has been reinforced.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Prosecutor Chen Chien-teh of the Taipei District
Prosecutors Office, who was commissioned to deal with the case,
said an autopsy will be carried out to recover the bullets that
killed Wu.
