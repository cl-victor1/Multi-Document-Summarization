A program to allow draft-age males to serve in research and
development positions as an alternative to mandatory military
service will be implemented from 2008, the Ministry of the
Interior (MOI) said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Ministry officials made the remarks while presiding over a
ceremony marking the 64th Conscription Day.
</P>
<P>
The officials said that to make the best use of the R&amp;D
capacity of the enlisted men and to help upgrade the R&amp;D
capacity of domestic industry, the statute governing alternative
military service has been revised to give the planned program a
legal basis.
</P>
<P>
They noted that the alternative military service program was
first put into practice in 2000 in the areas of administration,
education, medical care, environment, traffic, police,
agriculture, culture and diplomatic work.
</P>
<P>
They noted that over the past year, the ministry has been
actively promoting community service as an alternative to
military service, including distributing meals to seniors living
alone, providing learning assistance to aboriginal children and
children from disadvantaged families, and engaging in the anti-
drugs cause.
</P>
<P>
The officials said that working in tune with the government's
"say no to drugs" campaign, the MOI set up in 2006 a goodwill
ambassador group comprised of those performing their alternative
military service to promote the anti-drugs public awareness drive
islandwide.
