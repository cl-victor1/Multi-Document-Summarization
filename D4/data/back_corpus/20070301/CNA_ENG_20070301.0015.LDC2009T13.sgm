</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  March 1 (CNA) 03/01/07  16:17:31 (By Lilian Wu)
</P>
<P>
A by-election to select the Kuomintang's chairman in early April
will be held in a fair and transparent way, Wu Den-yih,
secretary-general of the main opposition party, said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Wu made the remarks when he posted the by-election notice at the
party's headquarters one day after a meeting of the KMT Central
Standing Committee in which the proposed schedule was approved.
</P>
<P>
According to the schedule, the aspirants will register March 18.
There will be a 10-day campaign period starting March 28 before
KMT members vote directly to choose the new chairman April 7.
</P>
<P>
The by-election has been made necessary by Ma Ying-jeou's
resignation as party chairman Feb. 13 immediately after he was
indicted on corruption charges for his alleged misuse of a
special allowance fund for the Taipei mayor's discretionary
during his two terms as mayor of Taiwan's capital between 1998
and 2006. Ma also announced simultaneously that he will run in
the 2008 presidential election.
</P>
<P>
Amid reports that KMT Acting Chairman Wu Poh-hsiung and Taoyuan
County Magistrate Chu Li-lun are keen on running for the party's
top post, Wu Den-yih said that he has not heard about the reports
and that no one has come forward yet to announce a bid to run for
chairman.
</P>
<P>
Wu Den-yih said that the KMT will conduct the chairmanship by-
election in a "just and transparent" manner in line with the
party's charter.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, KMT Acting Chairman Wu Poh-hsiung has yet to announce
whether he will run in the by-election.
</P>
<P>
While wishing all a prosperous Year of the Pig at the KMT's
Hsinchu chapter, Wu Poh-hsiung said that the public should not
dwell too much on whether he will run for the chairmanship,
noting that pursuing party unity is the more urgent task at
present.
</P>
<P>
"If there's no party cohesion, whoever serves as chairman will
find the task difficult," he added.
</P>
<P>
On remarks by Hsinchu County Magistrate Cheng Yung-chin that he
is the most qualified to serve as KMT chairman given his stature
within the party, Wu Poh- hsiung said that he understands Cheng's
good intentions.
</P>
<P>
However, he added that the party is already occupied with many
urgent tasks, including coordination work for the Keelung mayoral
by-election,  the year-end legislative  elections and the 2008
presidential election. He expressed the hope that others "will
not give him extra pressure."
</P>
<P>
In related developments, KMT Legislator Hsu Shu-po said that he
is inviting his colleagues in the legislature to sign a petition
asking Lien Chan, the KMT's honorary chairman, to return to the
chairmanship post. Lien served as the party's chairman between
2000 and 2005.
</P>
<P>
Hsu said that he will hand the petition to Lien at Taiwan Taoyuan
International Airport upon the latter's return from his Australia
visit Friday to show that the proposal is "by no means the
thinking of just a few KMT members."
