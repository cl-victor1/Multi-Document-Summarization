Taipei,  March 1 (CNA) 03/01/07  21:08:27 (By Flor Wang)

The Public Construction Commission (PCC) under the Executive Yuan
will call a task force meeting Saturday to assess the question of
whether a compound commemorating the late President Chiang Kai-
shek should be transformed to better relate to the public, PCC
Chairman Wu Tze-cheng said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Wu made the remarks after Premier Su Tseng-chang said in a
chairmanship changeover ceremony of the Chungcheng Cultural
Center that the compound's vast space should be better used to
allow the public to gain greater access to it and make it more
approachable.
</P>
<P>
The Chungcheng Cultural Center refers to the National Concert
Hall and the National Theater housed in the Chiang Kai-shek
Memorial Hall complex.
</P>
<P>
Clarifying media reports that Su was "hinting at" a dismantling
of the walls surrounding the hall -- one of the major tourist
attractions in downtown Taipei, Wu said that is only one of the
possible options and Su was referring to something "more
visionary."
</P>
<P>
According  to Wu,  the PCC will convene a meeting of an inter-
department task force Friday with officials from the Council for
Economic Planning and Development and the Ministry of Education.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Chu Nan-hsien, director of the Education Ministry's
Social Education Department, who just took over the post, said he
needs some time to gain a better understanding of the matter as
he has no knowledge of the matter. He added that the Education
Ministry must await the Executive Yuan's instructions and follow
its orders.

<P>
The government and the ruling Democratic Progressive Party have
kicked off a series of moves in line with a name change campaign
aimed at state-run companies or public establishments that carry
"China" or "Chinese" in their official designations.
</P>
<P>
President Chen Shui-bian said recently that the Chiang Kai-shek
Memorial Hall must be transformed into a public space with all
references to the late strongman removed and that his remains
embalmed at a temporary mausoleum in Tahsi township in northern
Taoyuan County should be relocated to a military graveyard on the
outskirts of Taipei.
