People First Party (PFP) lawmaker Liu Wen-hsiung, who lost his
Keelung mayoral bid in 2005 to Hsu Tsai-li, who died last month,
voiced hope Thursday of running a joint campaign with the main
opposition Kuomintang (KMT) in order to win the May 12 Keelung
mayoral by-election.
</P>
<P>
As the PFP and the KMT have recently established a closer
alliance  to further solidify voter support for the "pan-blue
alliance" that also includes the New Party, Liu said that he will
temporarily hold back from launching his Keelung mayoral bid
until after Hsu's funeral has been held.
</P>
<P>
Liu said he favors the idea of the two parties jointly fielding a
candidate who leads other hopefuls in cross-party public opinion
polls to better secure chances of victory in the Keelung mayoral
by-election.
</P>
<P>
The KMT and the PFP must fully collaborate in the coming Keelung
mayoral by- election to pave the way for the 2008 presidential
race, Liu said.

<P>
Hsu Shao-ping, a KMT legislative whip, announced her decision
Wednesday to seek the KMT's nomination to take part in the
Keelung mayoral by-election, bringing to five the number of
aspirants within the KMT.
</P>
<P>
The KMT is slated to receive party members' registration for the
Keelung mayoral by-election from March 3-5, and will hold a
public opinion poll from March 8-10 before party members vote on
possible contenders March 11. The KMT will select the winner to
run in the pending election based on its analysis of the public
opinion poll and outcome of the party vote.
</P>
<P>
KMT Secretary-General Wu Den-yih, who met his PFP counterpart
Chin Chin-sheng Wednesday evening to discuss jointly nominating a
candidate in the race, said that a common KMT-PFP candidate would
be decided up on by March 18 -- the deadline set by the Central
Election Commission to register for running in the May 12 mayoral
by-election in the northern port city.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Chen Chung-kuang, who once served as Keelung deputy
mayor, was appointed by the Executive Yuan to become Keelung's
acting mayor. Chen took the oath in a ceremony witnessed by more
than 100 officials from the central and local governments.
