Taipei,  March  1 (CNA) 03/01/07  19:53:19 (By Luis Huang)

Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng described opposition
Kuomintang (KMT) Honorary Chairman Lien Chan Thursday as the most
suitable person to serve as the party's top leader, saying if
Lien can assume the KMT chairmanship, that will help integrate
the forces of the opposition "pan-blue alliance."
</P>
<P>
Wang, a KMT stalwart, made the remarks during an interview with
local reporters after KMT Secretary-General Wu Den-yi announced
the same day that a by-election to select the party's chairman
will take place April 7.
</P>
<P>
The by-election has been made necessary by Ma Ying-jeou's
resignation as KMT chairman Feb. 13 immediately after he was
indicted on corruption charges for his alleged misuse of a
special allowance fund for his discretionary use during his two
terms as Taipei mayor from 1998 - 2006. Ma simultaneously
announced that he will run in the 2008 presidential election.
</P>
<P>
Asked when he will announce his decision to take part in the
KMT's presidential primary, Wang, who is widely viewed as a
potential contender for the 2008 presidential race, said he is
soliciting the views of various sectors concerning such a bid and
will choose an opportune date to announce whether or not he will
run for the presidency.
</P>
<P>
The legislative head also voiced his hope that Lien will seek to
mediate among the KMT's presidential aspirants to help ensure
that the party fields only one presidential candidate and thus is
well placed to win the presidential election.
