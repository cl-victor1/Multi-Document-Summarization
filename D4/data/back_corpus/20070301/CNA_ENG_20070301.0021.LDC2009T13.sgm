GOVERNMENT TO COMMEMORATE 20TH ANNIVERSARY OF LIFTING OF MARTIAL
LAW

The government will sponsor a series of commemorative activities
later this year to mark the 20th anniversary of the lifting of
martial law in Taiwan, an Executive Yuan official said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan experienced martial law from May 20, 1949 through July 14,
1987, during which local people's basic freedoms, including
freedom of assembly, association and speech, were subject to
stringent control.
</P>
<P>
Martial law was lifted July 15, 1987, along with the bans on
setting up new media outlets and new political parties. The ban
on travel to China was also lifted for those with relatives on
the mainland.
</P>
<P>
The lifting of martial law set the stage for Taiwan's democratic
reform, leading eventually to the holding of the country's first
direct presidential election in 1996.
</P>
<P>
To commemorate the 20th anniversary of the lifting of martial
law, the Council for Cultural Affairs unveiled a documentary
earlier this year as a warm-up to the inauguration of a memorial
park commemorating a spate of high-profile political persecution
cases, including the Lei Chen case and the "Kaohsiung Incident"
case, during the infamous martial law era.
</P>
<P>
The memorial park will be located at the site of the old Chingmei
military detention house in suburban Taipei which was under the
jurisdiction of the now defunct Taiwan Garrison Command during
the martial law era. Many noted prisoners of conscience were
detained and tried at the detention house.
</P>
<P>
The memorial park is scheduled to open in May as part of the
activities commemorating the 20th anniversary of the lifting of
martial law, the official said.
</P>
<P>
The martial law was imposed two-plus years after the infamous 228
Incident, which refers to uprising against the corrupt Kuomintang
(KMT) administration under the late President Chiang Kai-shek
that began Feb. 28, 1947 and was followed by a bloody crackdown
resulting in the deaths of tens of thousands of civilians.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a national memorial service at Taipei City's 228 Peace
Park commemorating  the 60th anniversary  of the 228 Incident
Wednesday, President Chen Shui-bian said the 1947 massacre was
not an ordinary historical event and that anyone who had suffered
under the KMT's authoritarian reign was also a victim of the
incident.
</P>
<P>
Chen further said on the occasion that the KMT should publicly
apologize for the atrocities committed during the 228 Incident
and the ensuing 38-year matrial law era. He also urged the KMT to
turn over all documents concerning the 228 Incident and return
its ill-gotten assets to the national coffers rather than selling
them off at bargain prices.
</P>
<P>
During the martial law era, talks about the 228 Incident is
taboo. The study of truth behind the tragedy received due
attention only after the lifting of martial law. With many
documents about the indicent held by the KMT, certain key facts
about the tragic event have not yet been fully revealed.
</P>
<P>
The Executive Yuan official said the commemoration of the 20th
anniversary of the lifting of martial law is expected to help
inspire further study of the 228 Incident and major political
persecution cases during the infamous martial law era. "Only when
the truth is known can fairness and justice be served," he said,
adding that other commemorative activities will be fleshed out
later.
