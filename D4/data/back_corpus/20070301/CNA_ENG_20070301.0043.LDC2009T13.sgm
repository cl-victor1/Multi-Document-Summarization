CEPD POSITIVE ON GAMBLING INDUSTRY
</HEADLINE>

The head of the Cabinet-level Council for Economic Planning and
Development (CEPD) said Thursday that the council has a positive
attitude toward opening up the gambling industry.
</P>
<P>
CEPD Chairwoman Ho Mei-yueh met that day with economists from
several think tanks and research institutes to discuss economic
prospects for 2007.
</P>
<P>
She told the media later that the CEPD is "open" on the gambling
industry issue, which had been rasied by some scholars in the
meeting.
</P>
<P>
Ho said the CEPD would prefer to include gambling in its general
policy on recreational  industries  rather than to develop it
separately.
</P>
<P>
She added, however, that more research is needed to win support
from the public and to mitigate the negative impact on society.

<P>
Whether or not to allow setting up casinos -- on outlaying
islands, according to most proposals -- has been a heated issue
for years, with proponents saying casinos would create jobs and
income and opponents  worrying  about harm to social  order and
the environment.
