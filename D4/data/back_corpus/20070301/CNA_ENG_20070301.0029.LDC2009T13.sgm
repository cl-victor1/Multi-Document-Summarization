Minister of Economic Affairs Steve Ruey-long Chen said Thursday
that to relocate Taiwan Power Co. and CPC Corp., Taiwan to
southern Taiwan would be difficult, but the ministry will
continue to study the matter.
</P>
<P>
He also said that although  the headquarters  of the two state-
owned enterprises are not in southern Taiwan, they attach great
importance to serving the residents in southern Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Chen's remarks came after President Chen Shui-bian said recently
that instead of talking about relocating the capital to
Kaohsiung, southern Taiwan, it is better to study the feasibility
of relocating such government agencies as the Council of
Agriculture (COA) or the Council of the Labor Affairs to southern
Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Premier Su Tseng-chang  also said that the government  is
considering relocating the Fisheries Administration under the COA
to Kaohsiung to boost fishery development.
</P>
<P>
The headquarters of five out of seven enterprises under the MOEA
-- Taiwan Sugar Co. (Taisugar), Taiwan Water Corp. CSBC Corp.,
Taiwan, Tang Eng Stainless Steel Plant, and Aerospace Industrial
Development Corp. -- are currently located in central or southern
Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Only the headquarters of Taipower and CPC Corp. Taiwan under the
MOEA remain in Taipei.
</P>
<P>
Chen noted the government does encourage state-owned enterprises
to relocate to southern Taiwan, with Taisugar responding to the
call last year.
</P>
<P>
The ministry has in the past studied relocating Taipower and CPC
Corp. Taiwan to southern Taiwan, although the studies had shown
great difficulties in relocating them.
</P>
<P>
Chen also denied reports that the ministry's Small and Medium
Enterprises will be relocated to southern Taiwan, saying that the
major operations of the agency are in Taipei, although it serves
the whole nation.
