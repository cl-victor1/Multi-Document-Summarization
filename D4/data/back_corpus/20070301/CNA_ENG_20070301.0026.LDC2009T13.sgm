The government has decided to increase the acreage dedicated to
biofuel crops -- soybean, rape, sunflower, and sweet potato --
from 1,721 hectares in 2006 to 4,550 hectares this year, the
Council of Agriculture (COA) announced Thursday.
</P>
<P>
COA officials said that 3,280 hectares will be used in soybean
cultivation, 1,240 hectares will go to raising sunflowers, and an
additional 30-hectares of cropland is designated to raise sweet
potatoes on a trial basis. Soybeans, rape seed, and sunflowers
can be turned into ethanol used in biodiesel, while sweet
potatoes have been chosen to supply the ethanol to be blended
with gasoline during manufacturing trials.

The government started its "biofuel development project" two
years ago, in an attempt to reduce reliance on imported fuels.
According to a recent survey released by the Ministry of Economic
Affairs, of 2006 national energy supplies -- amounting to the
equivalent of 138 million kiloliters of oil -- 98.22 percent was
imported.
</P>
<P>
Officials explained that some 220,000 hectares of farmland around
the island are left fallow every year, the COA has thus decided
to utilize this land to produce biofuel-related raw materials,
for which demand is increasing.
</P>
<P>
At the beginning of the project in early 2005, agricultural
agencies chose three 30-hectare experimental sites -- in
northern, central and southern Taiwan respectively -- for
cultivation of soybean, rape, and sunflower.
</P>
<P>
The land involved was expanded to 1,721 hectares in 2006 --
located in counties of Yunlin, Chiayi, and Tainan -- and the
produce has been entirely used in biodiesel production.
</P>
<P>
Officials noted that the scale of the project not only expanded
in terms of cropland utilized, but also in the number of counties
involved -- Taipei County and Taoyuan County have decided to
join, rising the number from three to five.
