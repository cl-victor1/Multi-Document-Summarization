<P>
Stricter security screening measures were brought into practice
at Taiwan's airports Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Passengers were warned to report to check-in counters early to
cope with possible delays caused by the stringent new security
screening procedures, and although passengers began arriving at
Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport before 4 a.m., long lines
nonetheless formed at many check-in counters.
</P>
<P>
The peak time for outbound passengers falls between 6 a.m. - 9
a.m. when typically 10,000 passengers are preparing to leave
Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Under the new procedures, passengers are forbidden to bring
containers holding more than 100ml of liquid, gel or spray on
international flights, and bottles containing less than 100ml
must be sealed in a see-through plastic bag and checked by
security officials before boarding.
</P>
<P>
The plastic bags -- sized 24 cm x 17 cm -- are provided by the
aviation police and no more than one plastic bag will be allowed
per passenger. 20,000 such bags were handed out by the Taiwan
Taoyuan International Airport, which quickly ran out due to
strong demand.
</P>
<P>
Before entering controlled areas, passengers were asked to dump
any containers of liquid, beverage or gel, with a volume of more
than 100 cc into waste baskets.
</P>
<P>
Some passengers were seen rushing to gulp down hot coffee, tea or
other beverages they had just purchased.
</P>
<P>
The Civil Aeronautic Administration has advised passengers
departing on international flights to check in three hours prior
to their scheduled departure to cope with new security measures.
</P>
<P>
Overall, the situation at Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport
was orderly, although some passengers complained about the long
wait, saying that related government agencies should send extra
staff given the new measures.
</P>
<P>
At the Kaohsiung International Airport, aviation police officials
reported that on the first day, the liquids most commonly
discarded by passengers were beverages, mineral water, or contact
lens solution.
