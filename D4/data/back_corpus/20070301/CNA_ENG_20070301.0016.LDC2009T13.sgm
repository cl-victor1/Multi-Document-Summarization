Washington,  Feb.  28 (CNA) 03/01/07  16:29:22 (By  Lin Chiehyu
and Maubo Chang)

<P>
The United States will sell 218 Advanced Medium Range Air-to-Air
Misiles (AMRAAMs) and 135 Maverick missiles to Taiwan, according
to the Defense Security Cooperation Agency under the Ministry of
Defense.
</P>
<P>
In a press release issued here Wednesday, the agency said it has
notified Congress of the possible sale which also includes
training versions of the two proposed missiles, 48 AMRAAM
launchers, spare parts, technical assistance and logistical
support.
</P>
<P>
If all options are exercised, the agency said, the price for the
sale could be as high as US$421 million.
</P>
<P>
The proposed sale is part of Taiwan's plan to modernize its armed
forces and enhance its defensive ability to counter air and
ground threats, said the release, adding that the U.S. is
committed to providing military assistance under the terms of the
Taiwan Relations Act.
</P>
<P>
The AMRAAM and Maverick missiles to be produced by Raytheon
Missile Systems Corporation in Tucson, Arizona will augment
Taiwan's F-16 fleet; Taiwan already has the two types of these
missiles in its inventory and is certainly capable of absorbing
and utilizing the additional missiles effectively, the agency
said.
</P>
<P>
The Maverick missile is a tactical, air-to-surface guided missile
designed for close air support, interdiction and defense
suppression mission, while the AMRAAM is a fire-and-forget
missile which has replaced the AIM-7 Sparrow as the U.S.
military's standard Beyond Visual Range intercept missile.
