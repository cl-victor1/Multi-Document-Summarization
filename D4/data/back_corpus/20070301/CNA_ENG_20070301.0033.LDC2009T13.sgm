Taiwan's top economic planner called Thursday on domestic stock
market investors not to panic at the nosedive of share prices on
the Taiwan Stock Exchange (TSE), saying that the nation enjoys a
sound economic fundamentals.

<P>
Ho Mei-yueh, chairwoman of the Cabinet-level Council for Economic
Planning and Development, made the remarks after the bourse's
weighted index moved down 223.29 points to close at 7,678.67 due
to the previous day's slump across global stock markets.

<P>
Attributing the TSE share price plunge mainly to falls on the
stock markets in the United States, China and other Asian
nations, Ho said the slump had nothing to do with Taiwan's
economic foundation.
</P>
<P>
Ho said the fact that the TSE recorded a huge turnover of around
NT$136 billion (US$4.1 billion) shows there were still a lot of
investors willing to invest in the domestic stock market.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese stock market's share price slump was mainly due to a
measure adopted by the Chinese government to cool its overheated
economy, Ho explained, adding that Taiwan's bourse will return to
normal once investors understand the reason behind the nosedive.

Meanwhile, Chang Hsiu-lien, deputy chairwoman of the Financial
Supervisory Commission, also called on investors to have
confidence in the domestic bourse, adding that there are no
problems with the operations of the companies listed on the TSE.
