Taipei,  March 1 (CNA) 03/01/07  21:10:39 (By Sofia Wu)
</P>
<P>
Shareholders of the state-controlled China Shipbuilding Corp.
(CSBC) approved a proposal Thursday to change the company's name
to get rid of its Chinese reference and include the word "Taiwan"
in its title.
</P>
<P>
The CSBC's board of directors agreed Feb. 9 to change the
company's Chinese name to "Taiwan International Shipbuilding
Corp." and its English title to CSBC Corp., Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
As the company has some private shareholders, the name-change
proposal needed to be approved at a CSBC shareholders meeting
before the redesignation could take effect under the Corporation
Law.
</P>
<P>
Some of the private shareholders did not agree with the board
directors, but the name-change proposal was nonetheless passed
after a vote.
</P>
<P>
CSBC President Fan Kuang-nan said the company will file a
redesignation application with the Ministry of Economic Affairs
soon. If all goes well, Fan said, the company will begin to use
its new name plaque March 3 at the earliest.
</P>
<P>
The CSBC name change is part of a government campaign to remove
references to China from the titles of state-owned enterprises
and institutions while adding the word "Taiwan" to signify
Taiwan's distinct identity.
