PRESIDENT'S SON-IN-LAW BEGINS WORK IN TAINAN HOSPITAL
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  March  1  (CNA) 03/01/07  22:41:33 (By Sofia Wu)
</P>
<P>
President Chen Shui-bian's disgraced son-in-law Chao Chien-ming,
an orthopedic surgeon, began practicing medicine at a hospital in
his home county in southern Taiwan Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Chao kept a low profile as he began outpatient clinical services
at Sinlau Hospital's branch in Matou township in Tainan County,
one of Taiwan's most important agricultural strongholds.
</P>
<P>
More than 60 patients registered for treatment from Chao, mostly
were seniors, including the president's neighbors from
neighboring Kuantien township.
</P>
<P>
All of the patients, including a TV reporter supposedly troubled
with backache, were satisfied with Chao's competence as well as
his kind and amicable attitude.
</P>
<P>
Chao told reporters before starting his clinical services at 1:30
p.m. that he takes pleasure in serving the townsfolk from his
home county in the "spirit of volunteerism." Chao has promised to
donate his entire salary to charity.
</P>
<P>
A hospital spokesman said Chao will offer outpatient clinical
services every Tuesday morning and Thursday afternoon. It
remained unclear whether Chao, the father of three young sons,
will commune between Taipei and Tainan or take up residence in a
hospital dormitory, the spokesman added.
</P>
<P>
Chao was suspended from duty at National Taiwan University
Hospital in Taipei immediately after he was indicted in July 2006
on charges of insider trading of Taiwan Development Corp. (TDC)
stock. The hospital voted down his request to return to his job
last October on the grounds that he "seriously violated medical
ethics." Chao then tendered his resignation, which took effect
last month.
</P>
<P>
The Taipei District Court sentenced Chao to six years in prison
and fined him NT$30 million (US$909,090)  last December after
determining that he had taken advantage of his influence to
obtain important information regarding TDC share prices, based
upon which he traded TDC shares for huge profits.
</P>
<P>
Chao has appealed his case to the Taiwan High Court.
