DOH VOWS TO HALVE TAIWAN'S TUBERCULOSIS INCIDENCE RATE IN 10 YEARS
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  March 20 (CNA) (By Sofia Wu)
</P>
<P>
The Department of Health (DOH) will join forces with the private
sector to halve the domestic tuberculosis (TB) incidence and death
rate in 10 years, a senior official said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Lin Ting, deputy director of the DOH's Center for Disease Control,
made the remarks at an award-presentation ceremony honoring those who
have contributed to local TB prevention as part of the activities to
mark the March 24 World Tuberculosis Day.
</P>
<P>
Quoting DOH tallies, Lin said about 15,000 new TB cases are reported
in Taiwan each year and that an average of 1,300 local people succumb
to the disease annually.
</P>
<P>
"Although tuberculosis is an old disease, it is the most serious
statutory communicable disease in Taiwan, " Lin said, adding that the
TB death rate is the highest among all communicable illnesses in
Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Lin said Taiwan's TB incidence rate is 13 times that of the United
States.
</P>
<P>
"In the United States, the TB incidence rate is 5.1 people out of
every 100,000, compared to 66.67 people in Taiwan and 24.8 people in
Japan," Lin said.
</P>
<P>
In terms of the TB death rate, Lin said, the ratio is 0.3 people out
of every 100,000 in the United States, 1.9 people in Japan and 5.8
people in Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Noting that Taiwan still has ample room to improve TB prevention and
control, Lin said the DOH hopes to join forces with the private sector
to lower the disease's incidence and death rate by 50 percent in the
coming 10 years.
</P>
<P>
He acknowledged that it will not be easy to realize these goals.
"Strenuous efforts and close coordination between medical and public
health personnel will be necessary to realize our goals," he added.
</P>
<P>
As far as TB prevention is concerned, Lin said identification of TB
patients is a very important and difficult task.
</P>
<P>
"We cannot just rely on chest X-rays. Examination of sputum is equally
important. The DOH has designated nine sputum examination centers
around the island with a view to identifying TB patients in the
shortest possible period of time," Lin said.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to the establishment of a comprehensive negative-pressure
quarantine ward system during the fight against the severe acute
respiratory syndrome epidemic in 2003, Lin said those well-equipped
quarantine wards have become an important resource in the fight
against TB.
</P>
<P>
Lin further said a particular problem in the TB-fighting campaign lies
in the fact that more than half of the patients are over 65 years of
age and have often stopped taking medication, hindering the treatment
of the disease and enhancing the risk of spread.
</P>
<P>
According to Lin, TB patients can fully recover so long as they take
prescription drugs regularly for six to nine months.
