President Chen Shui-bian is scheduled to visit Central America
and the South Pacific in the latter half of the year, Ministry of
Foreign Affairs (MOFA) spokesman Wang Chien-yeh said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Wang made the remarks when he reported on the ministry's major
tasks in the second half of 2007.
</P>
<P>
Wang said that Foreign Affairs Minister James Huang, who just
returned home from the 13th Conference of the Mixed Commission of
Cooperation Between Central American Countries and the Republic
of China (Taiwan) in Belize, discussed with his counterparts the
holding of a summit between President Chen and Central American
heads of state.
</P>
<P>
He added that the summit has been tentatively scheduled for
August or September in one of the Central American countries with
which Taiwan maintains formal diplomatic ties.
</P>
<P>
In mid-September, Taiwan will host a summit meeting between Chen
and the leaders of African countries that maintain diplomatic
ties with Taiwan, Wang said.
</P>
<P>
He added that Huang will extend invitations to the leaders of the
African allies when he attends the National Day celebrations of
Malawi and Sao Tome and Principle in July.
</P>
<P>
The leaders of the five African allies, including Swaziland, the
Gambia, Sao Tome and Principe, Malawi, and Burkina Faso, are
expected to attend the meeting.
</P>
<P>
In addition, President Chen will attend a leadership meeting
between the Republic of China and its South Pacific allies to be
held in the Marshall Islands in October, Wang said.
</P>
<P>
President Chen expressed the hope earlier Tuesday that New
Zealand will send observers to the meeting.
</P>
<P>
The MOFA is also planning to invite Australia to send observers
to join the meeting and discuss issues of mutual concerns in the
region.
