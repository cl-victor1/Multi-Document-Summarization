Taiwan High Speed Rail Corp. (THSRC) officials announced Tuesday
that from June 1, the company will increase the number of trains
in both directions on the north-south high speed railway between
Taipei and Kaohsiung from 25 to 31 daily.
</P>
<P>
It will be the second time the THSRC will have enhanced its
passenger services by adding more trains. On March 31, it
increased the number of trains going in each direction from 19 to
25 per day.
</P>
<P>
The officials said the departure and arrival times in the current
train schedule will be changed from June 1 and that passengers
can find the new schedule by accessing the company's Web site on
www.thsrc.com.tw/tw/ticketing/timetable.asp.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the first group of six locally trained high speed
train drivers, including a woman, received their driver's
licenses Tuesday after passing written and practical tests.
</P>
<P>
THSRC executives said that from June 1, the six new drivers will
join the 43 drivers hired from abroad to operate the trains that
ply the 345-km high speed rail link between Taiwan's two largest
cities.
</P>
<P>
They added that 68 driver-trainees will take their written and
practical tests after receiving 1,326 hours of training and that
the aim is to have enough Taiwanese train drivers to take over
all high speed train operations by the end of 2008.
