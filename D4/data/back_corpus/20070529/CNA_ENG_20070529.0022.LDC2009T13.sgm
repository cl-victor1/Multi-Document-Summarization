An opposition Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU) legislator urged the
Ministry of Education Tuesday to serve as a vigorous watchdog
while reviewing tuition fee hike plans for the next academic year
put forth by several local colleges and universities.
</P>
<P>
Legislator  Tseng Tsahn-deng  made the call during a news
conference held by the TSU legislative caucus at the Legislative
Yuan.
</P>
<P>
A total of 38 colleges and universities recently put forward
their plans to the ministry for tuition fee hikes, Tseng said,
adding that several of their faculty members and many of their
school facilities are substandard.
</P>
<P>
In response to the suggestion, an education ministry official
said later the same day that the ministry is sure to refuse to
allow schools with poor performance records to increase their
tuition fees, adding that the ministry may in fact demand that
they lower fees.
