KMT THREATENS TO TOPPLE CABINET IF PREMIER FAILS TO BREAK
GRIDLOCK
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Taipei,  May 29 (CNA) 05/29/07  21:56:39 (By Flor Wang)
</P>
<P>
The main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) may back a proposal  to
topple the Cabinet led by Premier Chang Chun-hsiung in Friday's
legislative meeting or boycott his policy speech if he fails to
make efforts to break the current gridlock in the Legislative
Yuan, KMT legislative caucus whip Hsu Shao-ping said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Hsu made the remarks after Chang held a news conference earlier
in the day in which he outlined five adverse impacts of the
legislature's long delay in passing the government's 2007 budget
bill, including threatening national security, public health and
flood-control projects.
</P>
<P>
Hsu said Chang should not have attributed all of the Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) administration's woes to the delay in
budget bill passage.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, she claimed that the DPP should be blamed, not the
opposition camp, for the delay which she said mainly resulted
from the DPP's boycott of a draft bill on the composition of the
Central Election Commission (CEC).
</P>
<P>
Hsu said that the KMT and its "pan-blue" ally -- the People First
Party (PFP) -- would welcome the DPP to put forward a no-
confidence vote to get rid of Chang if he continues to fuel
tension between ruling and opposition parties in the Legislative
Yuan.
</P>
<P>
She called on Chang to help mediate bilateral negotiations as
soon as possible to resolve the deadlock caused by disputes over
the CEC organic bill, and said that the KMT may counteract the
premier by joining the move to call a no- confidence vote or
prevent him from giving a policy speech in Friday's legislative
meeting -- Chang's first since he assumed the post May 21.
</P>
<P>
DPP Legislator Chen Chin-de proposed earlier the same day a no-
confidence vote in Friday's session if the 2007 central
government budget bill remains blocked in the session.
</P>
<P>
DPP legislative caucus whip Wang Sing-nan responded that the
caucus will not rule out the possibility of putting forward a no-
confidence vote to topple the Cabinet and will then ask President
Chen Shui-bian to dissolve the legislature, paving the way for
legislative elections and allowing the new lawmakers to vote on
the budget bill.
</P>
<P>
KMT and PFP lawmakers voiced their strong suspicion after Chen
Chin-de made the proposal.
</P>
<P>
Tseng Yung-chuan, a KMT lawmaker and director of the party's
Policy Coordination Committee, said that Friday's legislative
meeting is not slated to address the budget bill, as Chang has
been asked to give a policy speech in the session. Pointing out
that the DPP's no-confidence vote proposal is not included on the
Friday legislative agenda, Tseng said that he wonders whether the
DPP is sincere in suggesting the proposal.
</P>
<P>
The KMT is still closely assessing as to when to call a motion to
topple Chang's cabinet if he fails to push for detente and ease
tension between the executive and legislative branches.
</P>
<P>
PFP legislative caucus whip Fu Kun-chi also responded positively
to a DPP- proposed no-confidence vote should the ruling party
itself have no confidence in Chang's "dummy-head Cabinet."
</P>
<P>
PFP lawmaker Fung Ting-kuo said that the PFP and KMT lawmakers
will not agree to the 2007 central government budget bill's
passage if the KMT-PFP draft of the CEC organic law proposing
proportional representation does not clear the Legislative Yuan.
</P>
<P>
Chang told a news conference earlier that same day that the
failure of the annual budget bill is damaging national security,
public health, children's rights, traffic development and flood
control, in addition to slowing the economic growth rate.
