Levels in soft drinks of sodium benzoate, a preservative used to
prevent the growth of microorganisms, pose no risk to health, a
spokesman for the Department of Health (DOH) said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The use of sodium benzoate in drinks is so far limited to less
than 0.6g/kg in line with international standards, and is not
harmful, according to the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman made the remarks in response to a recent British
research report that sodium benzoate in carbonated beverages can
cause serious cell damage.
</P>
<P>
The DOH spokesman said that a review of sodium benzoate by the
World Health Organization in 2000 stated that the acceptable
daily intake for sodium benzoate is 0-5mg/kg body weight. For
example, a 60 kg adult is permitted to take 300 mg per day.
</P>
<P>
At present, the levels of sodium benzoate in carbonated soft
drinks on the market range between 150-200 mg/kg, he spokesman
said, adding that according to the current established safe
threshold for sodium benzoate, it is safe for everyone to consume
up to 1 kg of carbonated beverages a day.
</P>
<P>
Sodium benzoate is a common preservative used globally in
everything from soft drinks and barbecue sauce to many other
processed foods, the spokesman explained, claiming that there is
a lack of scientific evidence to support the British report and
that the DOH will keep a close eye on new developments and
information.
