A new drug developed by Taiwan-based GlycoNex Inc. has proven
effective against colorectal cancer in tests on rodents, with a
cure rate of 50 percent for ordinary colorectal cancer and 57
percent for metastatic colorectal cancer, company officials
reported Tuesday.

The drug, dubbed GNX-8, can "target and terminate" colorectal
cancer cells without damaging normal human cells, because
colorectal cancer cells carry a specific kind of antigen and
because the drug employs a human antibody cultivated in vitro to
locate the antigen and thus kill the cancer cells precisely, the
officials explained.

During  experiments  on rodents,  the researchers  injected
colorectal cancer cells into two groups of mice and gave the
antibodies only to one group after the cells grew to a weight of
100 milligrams. After 30 days, the group under treatment carried
nearly no cancer cells, while the mice in the other group had
cancer cells with an average weight of 1,600 milligrams.

In separate in vitro experiments, GlycoNex researchers found that
the density of the antibody can affect the activity of human
colorectal cancer cells, with higher concentrations of antibodies
correlating with lower survival rates for cancer cells, according
to the officials. "At a concentration of 100 percent, the cell
number was reduced almost to zero," they added.

Furthermore, in a preparation test before human testing, the
research fellows extracted colorectal cancer cell samples from
183 patients and applied the antibody to the cells. The antibody
successfully targeted and terminated the cancer cells in 94 of
the samples, which translates into a possible cure rate of 51.4
percent in humans -- better than that of any other similar
medication on the market, they said.
