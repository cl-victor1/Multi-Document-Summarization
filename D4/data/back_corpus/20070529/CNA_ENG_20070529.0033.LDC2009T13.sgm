<P>
An Annual consultation conference between Taiwan and the European
Union will be put off until September, Ministry of Foreign
Affairs (MOFA) officials said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The 19th Taiwan-EU economic and trade consultation conference was
originally set to take place in June in Taipei, but has been
postponed because of clashes in the itineraries of the officials
of the two sides who would be taking part.
</P>
<P>
The annual conference  takes place in Taipei and Brussels
alternately. The 18th conference took place in Brussels June 26
last year, when Economic Affairs Minister Steve R. J. Chen, then
a vice economics minister, and Herve Jouanjean, deputy director-
general of External Relations of the European Commission, co-
chaired the conference.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan and EU officials in charge of national security, trade and
economics will take part in this year's conference and discuss
Taiwan's participation in international organizations, as well as
bilateral trade and economic issues, the officials said.
