Premier Chang Chun-hsiung urged the Legislative Yuan Tuesday to
pass the national budget bill for 2007 swiftly, saying that the
delay of its passage has caused great damage to the nation.
</P>
<P>
The premier made the appeal in a news conference on the last day
of the legislative's current session, which is set to end Tuesday
but has been extended to June 15. Both the Organic Law of the
Central Election Commission (CEC) and the 2007 national budget
bill have been put on Tuesday's agenda.
</P>
<P>
The budget bill, which should have been passed in late 2006, has
been bogged down in the opposition-controlled legislature mainly
because the ruling and the opposition parties have been at
loggerheads over the composition of the CEC, which the opposition
wants to be comprised of members in proportion to the member of
seats each party has in the legislature.
