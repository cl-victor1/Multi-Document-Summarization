NO REASON TO DEFER NOMINATION OF PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: DPP WHIP
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  May 29 (CNA) 05/29/07  10:56:08 (By Sofia Wu)

<P>
The ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) should formally
nominate Frank Hsieh as its presidential candidate as soon as
possible to facilitate factional integration within the party
ranks, the party's top legislative whip said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Ker Chien-ming was responding  to media reports that some
influential DPP figures plan to suggest a delay in party
nomination of Hsieh as its presidential candidate to avoid
troubles that may arise provided that Hsieh were to be indicted
over any legal disputes or graft charges.
</P>
<P>
The DPP Central Executive Commission (CEC) is set to nominate
Hsieh as the party's candidate for the 2008 presidential election
at its regular meeting this afternoon.  But the China Times,  a
Chinese-language daily, quoted Huang Ching- lin, a CEC member, as
having said that he will ask the CEC to defer its nomination plan
to save the party any trouble that could arise from the worst-
case scenario in which Hsieh were to be involved in any judicial
case.
</P>
<P>
Ker said Huang's suggestion is unjustified and absurd. "There is
no reason to make a fuss over such an unjustifiable presumption.
Huang's suggestion  presumes somebody would be indicted.  It's
ridiculous. The reason for Huang's misgivings is non-existent, "
Ker said.
</P>
<P>
Now that Hsieh has scored a landslide victory in the party
primary, Ker said the party should nominate Hsieh as soon as
possible.
</P>
<P>
"We should not drag our feet on the issue and should instead
nominate Hsieh as soon as possible. The sooner the better, " Ker
said, added that the party should stand united to secure a final
victory in the year-end legislative election and the presidential
election next year.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the party must seek suitable candidates to run in 19
"tough" legislative constituencies where the party is widely seen
to face uphill battles,  Ker said the party should finalize its
presidential candidate nomination as early as possible to
facilitate the search of fittest hopefuls in those legislative
districts.
</P>
<P>
To consolidate party ranks and boost internal unity in the wake
of the intense presidential and legislative primary fray, Ker
said he firmly believes that it is imperative to settle the
presidential nomination as early as possible.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Ker said, all party members should believe in Hsieh's
integrity. "Hsieh has made it clear that he can withstand any
severe test for its political integrity. We should have
confidence in his words," he added.
