Scores of foreign experts on electronic passports have been
invited to attend a seminar to be sponsored Tuesday by the
Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) to offer tips on Taiwan's
e-passport issuance plan, a diplomatic official said Monday.
</P>
<P>
According to the official, the MOFA is organizing the Taiwan
ePassport Forum in cooperation with the Asia Pacific Smart Card
Association in preparation for its planned issuance of
e-passports from next year.
</P>
<P>
Electronic passport specialists from Germany, France, Australia,
the Netherlands and several other countries will deliver keynote
speeches at the forum, the official said, adding that foreign
participants will also exchange views and technological know-how
with relevant local software and hardware manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the MOFA's Bureau of Consular  Affairs  began
preparations for the e-passport issuance in 2005, the official
said the ministry hopes to obtain expert views and counseling on
Taiwan's e-passport program through the forum.
</P>
<P>
In addition to MOFA staff members, the official said senior
officials from 10-plus relevant government agencies have also
been invited to attend the seminar to keep them abreast of the
latest development and technological know- how in related fields.
</P>
<P>
Stressing that the issuance of an e-passport is an integral part
of passport renewal to stamp out forgery and other related
frauds, the official said e-passport issuance will not affect
existing passport application procedures and will follow the
principles of convenience and accessibility.
</P>
<P>
The official  further said the data to be stored in the
e-passport's integrated circuit or memory chip will be same as
those recorded in the present version of passport.
</P>
<P>
"The chip embedded in the back cover of the passport will not
carry such controversial items as fingerprints and iris scans, "
the official said, adding that special devices will also be
introduced to prevent stealing or hacking of information stored
in the chip.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the official said the MOFA has referred a package of
amendments to the passport statute to the Legislative Yuan for
approval to provide a legal basis to the issuance of e-passports.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to active promotion by the United States and formulation
of relevant standards and regulations by the international civil
aviation  organizations, 37  advanced  countries  have  issued
e-passports.
</P>
<P>
As sophisticated technologies have been introduced to protect the
personal information of e-passport holders, the official said the
issuance of e-passport will help prevent passport falsification
and even help speed up immigration procedures.
