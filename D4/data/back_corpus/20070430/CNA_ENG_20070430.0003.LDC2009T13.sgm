Taipei,  April  29  (CNA) 04/30/07  13:00:55 (By Maubo Chang)

<P>
China's open policy toward Taiwan, announced in a forum in
Beijing between the Communist Party of China (CPC) and Taiwan's
opposition Kuomintang (KMT) , was greeted with a cold reception
in Taiwan Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Notable in Beijing's announcement was the opening of six more
destinations, namely Chendu in Sichuan Province, Nanjing in
Jiangsu Province,  Hangzhou in Zhejiang Province, Shenzhen in
Guangdon Province, Dalian in Liaonin Province and Guilin in
Guangxi Province, for direct charter flights to and from Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
However, Taiwan's minister of transportation and communications,
Tsai Duei, said that no direct charter flights between Taiwan and
these six destinations can be launched without the approval of
Taiwan authorities.
</P>
<P>
He said the announcement made by Beijing at the CPC-KMT forum
which was not attended by Taiwan officials will not automatically
translate into Taiwan's policy, adding that an agreement must
first be reached between Beijing and Taipei.
</P>
<P>
Also notable in Beijing's announcement was that Chinese citizens
will be allowed to study at Taiwan's colleges and universities,
which suffer from a shortage of students.
</P>
<P>
Liu Chao-hsuan, president of Soochow University in Taipei, said
that an agreement must first be reached between Beijing and
Taipei on this issue before Taiwan's universities and colleges
will be allowed to recruit students from China.
</P>
<P>
Much as local universities and colleges like to recruit talented
students from China, Liu, who also serves as the president of the
Association of Private Universities and Colleges, Taiwan,
Republic of China, said Taiwan's government must first agree to
recognize degrees issued by Chinese schools before Chinese
students will be able to enroll in Taiwan schools.
</P>
<P>
Vice Education Minister Lu Mu-lin referred journalists who asked
for his ministry's comment on the issue to the Mainland Affairs
Council, noting that the council has the authority to decide
whether local schools will be allowed to recruit students from
China.
