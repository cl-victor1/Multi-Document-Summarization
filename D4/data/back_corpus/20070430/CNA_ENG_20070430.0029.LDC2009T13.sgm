Construction work on the main stadium for the 2009 World Games in
Kaohsiung is ahead of schedule, an executive of Fu Tsu
Construction Co., which won the bid to build the stadium, said
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Laio Nien-chi, vice chairman of Fu Tsu, told Kaohsiung Deputy
Mayor Cheng Wen- lung  during  the later's  inspection  of the
construction site that the project is now 16.17 percent complete,
slightly ahead of the scheduled progress of 16.08 percent.
</P>
<P>
The stadium, covering an area of 19 hectares, will cost N$5
billion (US$150.6 million). It will have world-class track and
field facilities, and a seating capacity to accommodate 55,000
people.
</P>
<P>
The stadium  has been designed  to be the world's  first
multifunction stadium powered by solar energy. Its solar power
generators will be capable of supplying 1 million kilowatts of
electricity a year.
</P>
<P>
The generators can meet the stadium's power needs for lighting
and air conditioning during the World Games. When no sports
events are taking place, the surplus electricity can be sold to
Taiwan Power Co. and net NT$5 million per year in revenue for the
Kaohsiung city government,  according  to officials from the
Kaohsiung  city government's Public Works Bureau.
</P>
<P>
The project is scheduled for completion by January 2009, allowing
enough time to prepare for the World Games, to be held July
16-26, 2009.
