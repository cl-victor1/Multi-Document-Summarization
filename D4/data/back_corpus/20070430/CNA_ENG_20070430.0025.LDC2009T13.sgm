PFP LAWMAKERS TAKE WAIT-AND-SEE ATTITUDE IN COMMITTEE MEETING

Taipei,   April  30  (CNA) 04/30/07  18:55:57 (By Flor Wang)
</P>
<P>
Because  of discontent  with the Kuomintang's (KMT) delay in
furthering coordination on the coming legislative polls, People
First Party (PFP) lawmakers will attend Tuesday's Procedure
Committee meeting but might not vote on a bill aimed at ex-KMT
Chief Ma Ying-jeou, a PFP lawmaker said Monday.
</P>
<P>
The decision was made during a PFP legislative caucus meeting
earlier in the day,  in a gesture to express PFP lawmakers'
dissatisfaction with the KMT's postponement of two-way talks to
better coordinate candidacies in December's legislative
elections.
</P>
<P>
The Procedure Committee is slated to address the bill designed to
squeeze Ma out of the 2008 presidential election for the third
time Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The KMT fails to control a majority in the Legislative Yuan and
needs PFP collaboration to kill the bill, which carries
tremendous significance for the party's future as the
presidential election approaches.
</P>
<P>
According to PFP legislative caucus whip Fu Kun-chi,  PFP
lawmakers will attend Tuesday's meeting after several of them
expressed displeasure with the KMT's attitude, but they will
refrain from voting on the Ma bill.
</P>
<P>
Since PFP lawmakers joined forces with their KMT peers during the
April 17 Procedure Committee in blocking "the Ma exclusion bill"
put forward by the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)
after the two parties reached an initial seven-point  agreement
on the legislative elections, the KMT has not held new talks with
the PFP to advance cooperation, despite pledging that it would do
so within two weeks.
</P>
<P>
PFP lawmakers will certainly take part in the coming Procedure
Committee meeting, but how they will act depends on how the
meeting progresses, PFP lawmaker Feng Ting-kuo said.
</P>
<P>
"There will be room for negotiations if the KMT honors its
promise to allot seven constituencies to the PFP in the seven-
point agreement," Feng said.
</P>
<P>
Ma  is viewed as the opposition's  best bet for the 2008
presidential race, but the former KMT chairman has been indicted
on corruption charges by Taipei prosecutors in a case related to
allegations that he embezzled over NT$11 million from a special
monthly municipal allowance earmarked for his discretionary use
when he served as mayor of Taipei from 1998-2006.
</P>
<P>
Ma stepped down from the KMT's top post in mid-February and
announced his desire to run for president immediately after being
indicted.
