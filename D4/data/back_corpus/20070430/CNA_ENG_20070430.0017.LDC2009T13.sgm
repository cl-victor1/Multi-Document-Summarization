Taipei,  April  30 (CNA) 04/30/07  16:55:05 (By Y.F. Low)

The Bureau of Health Promotion urged people over 50 years of age
Monday to receive yearly screening for colon cancer, which is the
third-most common kind of cancer among people in Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Kung Hsien-lan,  head of the bureau's  Cancer Control and
Prevention Division, noted that colon cancer is the result of
colorectal polyps turning malignant and that there is a 46
percent chance of malignant cells existing in polyps larger than
two centimeters in diameter.
</P>
<P>
While 90 percent of colon cancer patients can survive if the
cancer is discovered at stage I, the survival rate is less than
20 percent if it is discovered only at the terminal stage, Kung
pointed out.
</P>
<P>
According to Kung, colon cancer is most prevalent in people over
50 years of age, and experiences of Europe and the United States
show that receiving fecal occult blood tests every one to two
years can help early discovery of colon cancer and reduce the
death rate by 18 percent to 33 percent.
</P>
<P>
Advising people over 50 to receive screening every year, Kung
said the government now subsidizes fecal occult blood tests for
citizens 50-69 years of age every two years.
</P>
<P>
Tallies from the Department of Health indicate that colon cancer
has the third- highest cancer-related death rate in Taiwan. While
3,898 of 7,366 people diagnosed with colon cancer in 2002 died
within two years, 4,111 of 8,238 people diagnosed in 2003 died
within two years, according to the tallies.
