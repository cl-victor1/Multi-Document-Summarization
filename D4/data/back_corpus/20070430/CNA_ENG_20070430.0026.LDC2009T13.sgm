Beijing, April  30 (CNA) 04/30/07  19:28:25 (By Chang Ming-kun

A senior Chinese official said Monday that he would like to see
the 2008 Cross- Strait Economic, Trade and Cultural Forum between
the opposition Kuomintang (KMT) and the Communist Party of China
(CPC) held in Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Chen Yunlin, director of the Taiwan Affairs Office of China's
State Council, expressed the wish while he was seeing off Lien
Chan, honorary KMT chairman, at the airport after the KMT and the
CPC held their third cross-strait forum in Beijing April 28-29.
</P>
<P>
Chen said that each time the two sides prepare to hold the annual
forum, there are people in Taiwan who heap negative or abusive
remarks on the meeting.
</P>
<P>
"Yet we have been going from strength to strength, and I would
hope that the next forum can be held in Taiwan," he said.
</P>
<P>
Lien, who led a delegation consisting of more than 100 senior KMT
officials and Taiwan business leaders, told reporters at the
airport that the people of Taiwan "will welcome the achievements
of the 2007 forum."
</P>
<P>
He urged the government in Taipei to "reap the forum's fruitful
results" for the sake of the Taiwan people.
</P>
<P>
Some 500 participants attended the two-day forum and discussed
various issues, including cooperation in education, sightseeing
trips by Chinese tourists to Taiwan and direct flights across the
Taiwan Strait.
</P>
<P>
Among the new measures announced by Beijing during the forum was
a decision to allow students from China to apply to study in
Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Lien met with Chinse President Hu Jintao at the opening of the
forum. It was the third time they had met since the KMT and the
CPC held their first forum in Beijing in April 2005 -- the first
top-level talks between the two political parties in 60 years.
