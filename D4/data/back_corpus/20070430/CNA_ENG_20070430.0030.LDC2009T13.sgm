Chairman of the Taiwan Friendship Group in the European
Parliament, Georg Jarzembowski, suggested Monday that Taiwan's
government better communicate to the international community its
reasons to reject the Beijing-proposed Olympic torch relay route.
</P>
<P>
Noting that he was not in an appropriate position to comment on
whether or not letting the torch in would be more advantageous
for Taiwan, Jarzembowski said it is clear that Taiwanshould avoid
any situation as to present the image to a third country that
Taipei is of the same status as Hong Kong and Macau.
</P>
<P>
Jarzembowski made the remarks while talking with a number of
reporters at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. He and other three
European Parliament members, also from the Group of the European
People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, are
on a six-day visit in Taiwan and met with President Chen Shui-
bian earlier the day.
</P>
<P>
Jarzembowski said he does not consider the government's decision
to reject the torch route to be election-driven as some elements
in Taiwan claim. Rather, he said he believes that Chen made the
decision in order to defend the status quo and Taiwan's status as
a sovereign state.
</P>
<P>
China announced next year's Olympic torch relay route Thursday,
in which Taipei is defined by Beijing as the first stop on
Chinese soil, after Vietnam's Ho Chi Minh City and before China's
Hong Kong. Taiwan quickly rejected the plan, insisting the torch
should enter and exit Taiwan via third countries.
</P>
<P>
Over the issue of Taiwan applying for full membership to the
World Health Organization (WHO) , Jarzembowski said although no
positive answers can be expected in near future, the issue of
Taiwan's participation in the WHO should be kept on the table.
</P>
<P>
Jarzembowski said it is always important for Taiwan toraise the
flagshowing that Taiwan is a sovereign state and has the right to
contribute its expertise in health regulations. As for what the
best strategy to achieve those goals will be, he said it is a
decision best left to the country's government.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated that at the moment the European Parliament, the
United States and Japan support the idea of Taiwan becoming a
World Health Assembly observer, and the European Commission is in
favor of the arrangement  allowing for Taiwan to engage in
"meaningful participation."
</P>
<P>
He said he hopes Margaret Chan, the new WHO Director-General from
Hong  Kong, will not hinder  Taiwan's  cooperation  with the
organization.
</P>
<P>
Jarzembowski said there needs to be official dialogue between the
government of People's Republic of China and the government of
Republic of China if cross- strait tensions are to be eased.
</P>
<P>
Europe is closely watching human rights situation in China,
Jarzembowski said, China has to know that it is not a question of
'Western stylehuman rights requirement, but a question of China's
own destiny, because in the long run it can not have economic
prosperity while depriving people of their liberty.
