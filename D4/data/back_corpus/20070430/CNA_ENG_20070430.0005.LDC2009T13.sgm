The government will conduct careful planning before allowing
Chinese citizens to study in Taiwan, Mainland Affairs Council
(MAC) officials said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
In particular, the government needs to break through the current
legal restrictions and work out a management plan to regulate the
students' stay in Taiwan, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
The officials were responding to a proposal, put forth during a
Beijing forum between the Communist Party of China and Taiwan's
Kuomintang, that Taiwan colleges and universities recruit
students in China to promote cross-Taiwan Strait educational
exchanges and cooperation.
</P>
<P>
According to the MAC, although allowing China students to study
in Taiwan will help some Taiwan universities increase their
student numbers and enhance understanding of Taiwan by China's
younger generation, the policy involves a number of issues, such
as requiring the students to find a guarantor, providing them
with guidance on life in Taiwan, permitting them to accept part-
time jobs and including them in insurance programs.
</P>
<P>
There will also be other issues that will arise after the
students' graduation, including their residence, employment,
marriage and over-staying of their visas, as well as these
issues' impact on national security, MAC officials said.
</P>
<P>
Noting that most Taiwan universities still rely on government
funding and do not set different tuition rates for domestic and
foreign students, the officials said that allowing Chinese
students to study in Taiwan under these circumstances will not
help increase the universities' financial resources but will
dilute Taiwan's higher education resources.
</P>
<P>
While the government has always supported exchange activities
that are helpful to promoting positive cross-strait interaction
and expects cross-strait exchanges in all areas, it will not help
if China only targets some selected activities, they said.
</P>
<P>
The officials pointed out that there are a lot of problems in
cross-strait exchanges that remain unresolved and urged China to
resume talks with Taiwan as soon as possible to resolve the
problems.
