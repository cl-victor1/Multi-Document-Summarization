LABOR AFFAIRS CHIEF EMBARKS ON 'JUSTICE AND CONSCIENCE' WALK
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taipei,  May 2 (CNA) 05/02/07  14:27:21 (By Deborah Kuo)
</P>
<P>
Council for Labor Affairs (CLA) Chairman Lee Ying-yuan, who
announced his decision to resign from the Cabinet Tuesday,
embarked on a three-day, 100-kilometer walk "for justice and
conscience" from a temple in central Taiwan Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Lee, whose resignation has yet to be approved by Premier Su
Tseng-chang, said before his departure from Chaotien Temple in
Peikang, Yunlin County, that the walk is aimed at reflecting the
"milk of human kindness" and pursuing justice.
</P>
<P>
He added that the walk is also the first step of his open support
for former Premier Frank Hsieh, who is one of the four contenders
vying for the ruling Democratic  Progressive  Party's  (DPP's)
nomination to represent the party in the 2008 presidential
election.
</P>
<P>
Lee was accompanied by former Vice Premier Yeh Chu-lan and Yunlin
Magistrate Su Chih-fen for the first several kilometers on his
walk toward the southern counties of Chiayi and Tainan.
</P>
<P>
In a hastily called news conference Tuesday, Lee said he was
quitting because of the Cabinet's decision the day before to put
on hold a CLA plan to announce a raise in the minimum wage. He
was also concerned by Premier Su's suggestion April 16 that
former Premier Frank Hsieh is "crafty."
</P>
<P>
Lee stopped short of saying at the news conference that he is
quitting to give himself a free hand to support Hsieh in the
DPP's presidential primary. The three other candidates bidding
for the party's nomination are Vice President Annette Lu, Premier
Su and DPP Chairman Yu Shyi-kun.
</P>
<P>
The CLA has proposed raising the minimum wage by between 7.5
percent and 9.5 percent beginning July 1.
</P>
<P>
However, the premier decided in a meeting with DPP leaders Monday
that the plan should be shelved for the time being on the grounds
that it may lend credibility to the accusation by the other DPP
presidential hopefuls that he is engaging in pork barrel politics
to woo voters in the primary.
