TAIWAN, JAPAN, S. KOREA TO SUBMIT FISHERY SUBSIDIES DRAFT
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taipei,  May 2 (CNA) 05/02/07  16:10:50 (By Deborah Kuo)
</P>
<P>
Taiwan, Japan and South Korea will again submit a draft text for
eventual disciplines for fisheries subsidies under the World
Trade Organization (WTO) framework,  Fisheries Administration
officials said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Unwilling to accept a U.S.-proposed draft text that retains an
overall "top- down" broad ban on fisheries subsidies, Taiwan,
Japan and South Korea -- all of which have large fishing fleets
-- are working to re-submit a joint draft text to facilitate WTO
talks on fisheries subsidies, which has been one of the key
stumbling blocks in the WTO's Doha round of trade negotiations,
the officials said.
</P>
<P>
Fishing sectors of the three countries decided to re-submit a
draft text in the wake of a warm response at a WTO discussion
Tuesday in Geneva to the U.S. proposal that suggests a broad ban
on fisheries subsidies -- subsidies to help enhance fishing
boats' fishing capacities  as  well  as their  operational costs,
Fisheries Administration officials said.
</P>
<P>
In addition to Taiwan, Japan and South Korea, Norway and the
European Union have also adopted a more conservative  stance,
considering  that a "bottom-up" approach,  which proposes that
fisheries subsidies be retained first and then identify specific
fisheries-related subsidies for prohibition, would be more
realistic, according to the officials.
</P>
<P>
Fishery officials from the three countries have intensively
exchanged views on the new "bottom-up" draft text, which will be
authored by Japan.
</P>
<P>
The three countries will also seek support from other WTO member
countries for their proposal.
</P>
<P>
Japan, South Korea and Taiwan elaborated on a "bottom-up"
approach in their first submission last year that would identify
specific fisheries-related subsidies for prohibition, in contrast
to the overall ban with negotiated exemptions sought by the
Friends of Fish group.
