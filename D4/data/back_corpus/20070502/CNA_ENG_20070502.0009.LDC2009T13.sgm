OFFICIAL CLARIFIES TAIWAN'S DEFENSE SITUATION
</HEADLINE>

Washington,  May 2 (CNA) 05/02/07  13:28:37 (By Y.F. Low)

Taiwan is fully committed to upholding both its defense and
democratic ideals in the face of China's military threat, a
Taiwan official posted in the United States said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Eddy Tsai, director of the Press Division at the Taipei Economic
and Cultural Representative Office, said the stability and
security that the United States brings to the Asia-Pacific region
in the form of the sale of defensive armaments to its allies and
its firm support for freedom sends a message not only to China
but also to others who question America's resolve to stand up for
democracy overseas.
</P>
<P>
"Suggesting that it may be better to abandon Taiwan's 23 million
citizens to the tender mercies of Beijing serves only to dilute
this message and increases the chances of miscalculation, " Tsai
argued in a letter to the editor printed in The Wall Street
Journal.
</P>
<P>
The letter, titled "Three Myths About Taiwan's Defense, " was a
response to an April 23 article titled "Taiwan's Free Ride on
U.S. Defense" authored by Ted Galen Carpenter, vice president for
defense and foreign policy studies at the Cato Institute.
Carpenter claimed that the Taiwan legislature's reluctance to
pass a special budget for arms procurement from the United States
"leaves America in the unenviable position of having an implicit
commitment to defend a fellow democracy that doesn't seem
especially interested in defending itself."
</P>
<P>
According to Tsai, Carpenter's argument was based on three
"regrettable myths" about Taiwan's defense situation, namely that
Taiwan's defense investment continues to shrink as China's rises,
that Taiwan seems intent on starting a shooting war with China
through provocative policies, and that the long-stalled arms
package would have been passed by now if Taiwan were still an
authoritarian party-state.
</P>
<P>
Tsai noted that Taiwan's defense budget will increase from 2.2
percent of its gross domestic product (GDP) last year to a
proposed 2.85 percent this year and to 3 percent in 2008.
</P>
<P>
Citing a 2006 report by the U.S. Congressional Research Service,
Tsai said Taiwan received US$13.9 billion in arms deliveries from
various sources from 1998 to 2005, making it the third largest
such recipient among developing countries.
</P>
<P>
Also, much of Taiwan's defense budget has been spent on expensive
military software that often costs even more than the missile
hardware the country purchases, Tsai said.
</P>
<P>
On the allegation that the administration of President Chen Shui-
bian is following a provocative cross-Taiwan Strait policy, Tsai
pointed out that Taiwan has tried to reach out to China with
initiatives such as a proposed demilitarized zone along the
middle of the  Taiwan  Strait,  confidence-building measures  to
avoid miscalculation, and direct charter flights between the two
sides.
</P>
<P>
He said the standoff over the arms procurement bill in the
legislature is a testimony to Taiwan's commitment to democracy
because "long gone are the days when an authoritarian government
in Taipei could pass laws by executive fiat regardless of
political opposition."
