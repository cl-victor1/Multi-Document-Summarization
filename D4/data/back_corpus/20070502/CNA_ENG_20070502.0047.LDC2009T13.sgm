PREMIER RULES OUT WORKING UNDER BEIJING'S 'ONE CHINA' FRAMEWORK

Taiwan will never engage in cross-Taiwan Strait dealings under
the "one China" framework set by Beijing, Premier Su Tseng-chang
said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking in a weekly Cabinet meeting, Su said that the government
will not give way to Beijing's attempts to make Taiwan one of
China's provinces and that it refuses to take the responsibility
for setbacks in bilateral exchanges given the "one China"
precondition.
</P>
<P>
Beijing's  political  meddling  in two-way  activities  and
negotiations will only restrict Taiwan-China interactions, Su
said, adding that Beijing's 2008 Olympic Games torch relay plan,
which would include Taiwan as part of its domestic route, is an
example of its schemes to undermine Taiwan's sovereignty and
national dignity.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on a recent economic cooperation forum held between
Taiwan's main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) and the Communist Party
of China (CPC) ending April 29 in Beijing, Su called the
conclusions reached between the two sides under the skewed "one
China" framework "absurd, " and labeled them as "united front
tactics" aimed at eroding unity within Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Su also accused the KMT of singing to Beijing's tune by holding
the forum with the CPC while overlooking China's threats against
Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
In response to Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) Chairman Chen Ming-
tong's reply in the Legislative Yuan that there is little chance
that Chinese tourists will be allowed to sightsee in Taiwan in
the short term due to Beijing's political interference, KMT
Legislator Shuai Hua-ming said that the Taiwanese people would
not buy the MAC's story.
</P>
<P>
After the MAC ruled out the "92 consensus" as Taiwan's highest
principle in conducting talks with China, all these kinds of
rhetoric are just a pretext to cover up the MAC's true intentions
to skip contacts with the Chinese side, Shuai criticized.
</P>
<P>
The "92 consensus" permits Taiwan and China to freely interpret
the so-called "one China" meaning, providing ambiguous room for
the two sides to engage in pragmatic exchanges, Shuai claimed,
accusing the government of ignoring national interests by
reneging on the tacit agreement to deal with the thorny "one
China" issue.
</P>
<P>
Shuai lashed out at the government's present China policy, saying
that it fails to serve the Taiwanese people in the midst of
frequent and close civilian exchanges between the two sides.
