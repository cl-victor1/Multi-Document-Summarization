REJECTING TORCH WILL NOT MEAN REVOCATION OF IOC MEMBERSHIP: NCPFS
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  May  2 (CNA) 05/02/07  17:29:46 (By Luis Huang)

Taiwan's rejection of China's offer to include its capital city
of Taipei on the 2008 Olympic torch relay route will not result
in the International Olympic Committee's (IOC's) revocation of
Taiwan's membership, the nation's top official in charge of
sports affairs said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Fielding questions at the Legislative Yuan, Yang Jong-her,
chairman of the Cabinet-level National Council on Physical
Fitness and Sports (NCPFS) , said Taiwan will take part in the
2008 Beijing Olympic Games as long as the nation's sovereign
status is not undermined.
</P>
<P>
As to a plan of winning at least seven gold medals at the
upcoming Olympics Games aired by President Chen Shui-bian and
former NCPFS Chairman Chen Chuan- shou, Yang said his council
will go all out to achieve the goal.
</P>
<P>
During the interpellation session, KMT Legislator Lee Ching-an
asked Yang why the government changed its original decision to
allow the passage of the 2008 Olympic torch through Taiwan,
saying that prior to China's April 26 announcement of the torch
relay route, the Chinese Taipei Olympic Committee (CTOC), the
NCPFS and the Executive Yuan all agreed to it, while CTOC
Chairman Thomas W. Tasi also signed a preliminary pact with his
Chinese counterpart.
</P>
<P>
In response, Yang said it was because while selling tickets
online, the Beijing Olympic Committee referred to the nation as
"Taipei, China, " which he said represents a downgrading of
Taiwan's status as a sovereign country. In addition, he said the
Beijing authorities refused to allow Kaohsiung Deputy Mayor Cheng
Wen-lung to enter China to give a briefing on the city's
preparations for the 2009 World Games.
</P>
<P>
Hours after Beijing's announcement of what would be the longest
torch relay in Olympic history -- a 137,000-km route that would
cross five continents and scale Mount Everest, Taiwan rejected
being included on the route.
</P>
<P>
According to Beijing's announcement, the Olympic torch would have
arrived in Taipei from Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam before traveling
to China-controlled areas of Hong Kong and Macau.
</P>
<P>
"It is something that Taiwan's government and people cannot
accept because the route is defined by Beijing as a domestic
route, which constitutes an attempt to downgrade our country's
sovereignty," CTOC Chairman Tsai said at a news conference.
</P>
<P>
To safeguard Taiwan's sovereign status, the government insists
that the torch should come from a third country and leave for
another third country.
</P>
<P>
It marked the first time since the Olympic torch relay was
inaugurated for the 1920 Brussels Olympic Games that an IOC
member has rejected being part of the torch relay.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan returned to the IOC in 1981 under the name of "Chinese
Taipei" after a 10-year hiatus following its ouster from the
United Nations in 1971.
