A collection of 28 photos featuring Taiwan's endemic butterfly
species is going on display at the Smithsonian National Museum of
Natural History in Washington, D.C. as part of the institution's
arts festival exhibition, an official said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The life-like butterfly images were shot by Tsai Bae-chung, a
local nature photographer better known as "Mr. Butterfly" as he
has been tracking and photographing the beautiful creatures for
28 years.
</P>
<P>
Tsai is the first to document many of Taiwan's most elusive
butterfly species, including Taiwan's magnificent  broad-tailed
swallowtail butterfly, or Agehana maraho.
</P>
<P>
Crowned as the "kingdom of the butterfly, " Taiwan is home to
nearly 400 butterfly  species --  one of the world's largest
concentrations of butterfly species.
</P>
<P>
Officials  from the Forestry  Bureau under the Council of
Agriculture (COA) said Tsai has photographed 340 of Taiwan's some
400 endemic  butterfly  species,  a record  in Taiwan's
butterfly photographing history.
</P>
<P>
The prestigious Smithsonian museum decided to display Tsai's
butterfly photos after stringent screening, COA officials said,
adding that Tsai is first Asian art photographer allowed to
exhibit nature photos at the U.S. museum.
</P>
<P>
The COA and the non-profit Taipei-based Public Network Foundation
helped organize the exhibition of Tsai's butterfly images at the
Smithsonian museum slated to be held May 2-18.
</P>
<P>
Tsai is also scheduled to give an illustrated lecture May 10 at
the museum to share his stories of decades spent tracking and
photographing Taiwan's alluring butterfly species.
</P>
<P>
Tsai said prior to his departure for the United States Monday for
the event that he is hopeful that the exhibition will not only
showcase the beauty of Taiwan's butterflies but will also help
attract world attention to the Taiwan's initial success in
conserving its butterfly species and natural ecology.
</P>
<P>
For  tracking  the  wonderful  butterfly  species,  the
businessman-turned- nature photographer has sold off three luxury
houses over the past two decades to cover his travel expenses,
research expenses and photographic equipment costs.
</P>
<P>
"I feel no regret in terms of the money I have spent to pursue
the dazzling beauty of butterflies and their multifaceted place
in nature, " Tsai said. "I have incurably fallen in love with
these intricate creatures. I have always felt compelled to record
their charming images at any cost."
</P>
<P>
Tsai has not only filmed butterflies but has also done extensive
research into their living habits, mating habits, interactions
with one another, and various other aspects of their behavior.
</P>
<P>
He has even designed special photographic equipment, including
three-dimensional flashlight and microscopic lenses, to take the
clearest pictures of butterflies at very short distances.
</P>
<P>
In his search for some very precious butterfly species, Tsai has
traveled extensively around Taiwan, mostly in remote mountainous
regions.
</P>
<P>
After 10 full years of searching, Tsai finally caught sight of
the broad-tailed swallowtail butterfly during a hiking trip in
the Taiping Mountain region in Yilan County in 1988. To get the
perfect shot of this winged wonder, Tsai recalled that he had to
stand on one foot for more than half an hour and almost collapsed
before getting the photograph he wanted.
</P>
<P>
Noting that he has often "danced together with butterflies" in
nature, Tsai said he has always endeavored to photograph
butterflies with goals in mind that go far beyond simply
capturing their beauty.
</P>
<P>
"I hope my photographic works can inspire the audience to think
deeply about beauty -- its meaning as well as its fragility. I'm
also hopeful that my works can serve as an eloquent plea for
environmental awareness, with butterflies cast as a potential
victim of humankind's often blind irresponsibility and overall
lack of vision," he added.
