The three-day contest was held at the Grand Hotel in Taipei City,

A total of top 20 finalists will be eligible to join the 2007

Contestants displayed rapid reactions and extensive knowledge,
although some needed to read manuals on international standard
Mahjong rules while playing, and all enjoyed playing without
gambling, which was prohibited in the contest, the spokesman
said.

The GigaMedia Global Limited acquired five-year authorization
from the World Mahjong Organization and the World Mahjong Contest
