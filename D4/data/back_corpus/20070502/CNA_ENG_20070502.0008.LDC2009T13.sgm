Taiwan's top China policy planner said Wednesday that the
prospect of Taiwan opening to Chinese tourists does not look
promising under "Beijing's frame of political mind."
</P>
<P>
Noting that when Chinese citizens will be allowed to visit Taiwan
as tourists hinges on Beijing's attitude, Mainland Affairs
Council Chairman Chen Ming-tong said Taiwan cannot be too
optimistic about the opening while Beijing imposes a political
frame and use political language referring to the negotiations on
the proposed opening.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a discussion sponsored by the opposition Kuomintang
legislative caucus on the opening of direct cross-strait air
links and Taiwan tourism to Chinese citizens, Chen said that the
private Taiwan Strait Tourism Association has engaged in five
rounds of negotiations with its Chinese counterpart, the Cross-
Strait Tourism Exchange Association, since late last year on
technical details regarding Taiwan's opening to Chinese tourists.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Chen noted, from the fourth round of talks, the
Chinese have begun "to tamper with the negotiations with
political rhetoric." He noted that in a cross-strait business and
cultural forum held April 28-29, Jia Qinglin, chairman of the
rubber stamp Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference,
even stated that cross-strait tourism is not leisure trips
"between two countries."
</P>
<P>
Jia's remarks were the most obvious "frame of political mind, "
Chen claimed.
</P>
<P>
As to why the Chinese authorities have changed their attitude to
Taiwan's proposed opening to Chinese tourists, Chen said he has
no idea and has been trying to gain an understanding.
</P>
<P>
Chen said in late April that he believes that cross-strait
negotiations over the issue have entered the final stage. It is
now up to Beijing to determine when Chinese citizens will be
allowed to travel to Taiwan for sightseeing this year, Chen said,
adding that so long as Beijing gives the green light, the program
can be implemented before the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
According to Taiwan's plan, a maximum of 1,000 Chinese tourists
will be allowed to enter Taiwan per day for a maximum 10-day
stay. Chinese tourists are required to "enter and leave in a tour
group, " and the host Taiwan travel agency will be fined
NT$200,000 for any absconding Chinese tourist.
