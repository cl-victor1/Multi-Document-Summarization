TAIWAN HAS RIGHT TO JOIN WHO: PREMIER
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Taipei,  May 2 (CNA) 05/02/07  17:32:34 (By Y.F. Low)
</P>
<P>
Premier Su Tseng-chang said Wednesday that Taiwan should have the
right to join the World Health Organization (WHO) and reiterated
that there should not be boundaries or gaps in the world's health
network.
</P>
<P>
Su expressed strong protest and regret at a statement by a WHO
spokesman late last month that as Taiwan is not a sovereign
state, it is not eligible for membership in a specialized agency
of the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
"Taiwan, which maintains diplomatic relations with 23 official
members of the WHO and one observer in the organization, is
definitely an independent sovereign country," Su said during a
weekly Cabinet meeting.
</P>
<P>
Su stressed  that Taiwan's application  for WHO membership
represents the collective human rights of the country's 23
million people and that the issue should be included on the
agenda of the upcoming  annual World Health Assembly --  the
WHO's highest decision-making body -- for discussion and decision
by WHO members.
</P>
<P>
Noting that this year marks the first year that Taiwan has
applied for WHO membership under the name of "Taiwan, " Su
instructed the Ministry of Foreign Affairs,  the country's
embassies and representative offices overseas, and health-related
agencies to continue their efforts to promote the WHO bid.
</P>
<P>
The premier extended his appreciation to the European Parliament
for offering its support for Taiwan's WHO bid on many occasions
over the years and for adopting a resolution last month to
express its objection to China's refusal to renounce the use of
force against Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Also Wednesday, the Government Information Office released an
advertisement, printed materials and films to publicize the
country's bid to join the WHO, in which the government argued
that the WHO will be incomplete if Taiwan continues to be
excluded.
