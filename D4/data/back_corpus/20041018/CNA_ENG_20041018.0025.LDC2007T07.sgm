NEW DISEASE CONTROL CHIEF VOWS TO BOOST INTERNATIONAL COOPERATION
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taipei,  Oct. 18 (CNA) (By Sofia Wu)
</P>
<P>
The Center for Disease Control (CDC) under the Department of Health
(DOH) will step up international cooperation to avert outbreaks of any
contagious diseases, the center's new chief said Monday.
</P>
<P>
New CDC Director Kuo Hsu-sung made the remarks after taking over the
center's official seal from DOH Minister Chen Chien-jen at a
changeover ceremony.
</P>
<P>
Kuo said the CDC will greatly increase international exchanges,
particularly with the United States and Japan in the prevention of
communicable diseases.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Kuo said the CDC plans to transform one of its divisions
into a special task force responsible for promoting cooperation with
other countries in blocking the import of exotic diseases.
</P>
<P>
Noting that Taiwan has long faced a severe shortage of professional
disease control personnel, Kuo said the CDC will give priority to
recruiting and cultivating competent infectious disease experts.
</P>
<P>
Chang recalled that when severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) hit
Taiwan between March and June of last year, the saying that "battling
outbreaks of an infectious disease is like waging a war" was often
mentioned.
</P>
<P>
"This indicates that a disease control system requires strategic
thinking, teamwork, discipline, mobility, obedience and a spirit of
self-sacrifice, " Kuo said, adding that the CDC will reinforce
training of its staff in line with these principles in the future.
</P>
<P>
Kuo graduated from National Yangming University's medical department
and has a doctorate in public health policy from Yale University. He
once served as director of the DOH's planning department and played an
important role in the SARS-fighting campaign last year.
