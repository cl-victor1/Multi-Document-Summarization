Restrictions on China-bound businesses should be based on the
merits of the respective category of business to allow more
flexible management, the nation's top China policy planner said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Mainland Affairs Council Chairman Chen Ming-tong said the present
40-percent ceiling on China-bound investment by local companies
has become "political language" that does not necessarily help
effective management.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks when he reported on "direct cross-strait
transportation links and opening to Chinese  tourists"  to a
Legislative Yuan committee.
</P>
<P>
Chen noted that the local companies investing in China cover a
wide area of categories and said that "for some businesses, there
shouldn't be such a strict 40-percent ceiling."
</P>
<P>
He also said the government discussed the issue of lifting the
40-percent cap in the hope of achieving more flexible management.
</P>
<P>
Chen was responding to questions by Legislator Ting Shou-chung of
the main opposition Kuomintang, who said the public is most
concerned about six major issues -- regular cross-strait
passenger and cargo charter flights, full opening of Taiwan to
Chinese tourists, the 40-percent cap on investment in China,
direct air links between Taipei's Sungshan Airport and Hong Kong
and Macau airports, Taiwan banks investing in China, and Taiwan
colleges and universities recruiting Chinese students.
</P>
<P>
He noted that China's political mindset has hindered progress in
the talks on cross-strait charter flights as well as the opening
to Chinese tourists.
</P>
<P>
On allowing Taiwan colleges and universities to recruit Chinese
students, Chen said the nation's educational resources are
limited and that an influx of Chinese students would strain local
students' scholarships and subsidies as well as job
opportunities.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the Chinese students could get married and have
children in Taiwan, making the issue more complex, he said.
</P>
<P>
"Of the six issues, this one is the least feasible" he added.
