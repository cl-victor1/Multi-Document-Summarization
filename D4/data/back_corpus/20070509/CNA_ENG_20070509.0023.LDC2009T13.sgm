GENEVA

Taipei,  May  9 (CNA) 05/09/07  16:52:10 (By Luis Huang)

<P>
Department of Health (DOH) Minister Hou Sheng-mao has sent a
letter to his Chinese counterpart Gao Qiang, calling for talks on
an equal footing on the sidelines of an upcoming annual  meeting
of the World Health  Assembly  (WHA) , the decision-making arm of
the World Health Organization (WHO) , a health official said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Hou wrote in his May 4 letter that with cross-Taiwan Strait
exchanges getting more frequent in this era of globalization,
over 10,000 people traveling across the Taiwan Strait each day,
the need for the two sides to consult and cooperate in addressing
public health-related issues, including communicable diseases,
has risen accordingly.
</P>
<P>
"As such, Taiwan is not only willing to initiate talks with China
on epidemic prevention and other public health-related issues but
is also ready to share its valuable experience and upgrade each
other's medical treatment systems through exchanges of visits by
medical professionals from both sides, Hou worte.
</P>
<P>
In addition to initiating cross-strait talks, the official said,
the DOH also hopes that the nation's bid to become a full WHO
member under the name of "Taiwan" will be fairly discussed with
no political interference during the upcoming WHA conference.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan has sought to join the WHA as an observer since 1997, but
has seen little progress due to China's obstruction. At the WHA
gathering last year, Taiwan's hopes of joining the organization
were dashed for the 10th consecutive year when the WHA General
Committee decided not to include Taiwan's bid on the assembly's
agenda.
</P>
<P>
This year, Taiwan has decided to apply for full WHO membership
under the name of "Taiwan, " in addition to continuing its
efforts to gain observer status in the WHA. The annual WHA
conference is scheduled to open May 14 in Geneva.
