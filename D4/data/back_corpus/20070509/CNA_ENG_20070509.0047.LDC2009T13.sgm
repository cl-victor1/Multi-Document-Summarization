Taipei,  May 9 (CNA) 05/09/07  21:42:57 (By T.C. Jiang)

<P>
The Government Information Office (GIO) has been pushing the
United Nations to allow Taiwanese journalists to cover the
upcoming World Health Assembly (WHA) , GIO Acting Minister
William Yih said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The U.N.  has refused to issue press passes to Taiwanese
journalists over the past three years on the grounds that Taiwan
is not a U.N. member, Yih noted.
</P>
<P>
Yih called on the U.N. to safeguard freedom of the press and to
allow the people of Taiwan to enjoy their rights to health and
information.
</P>
<P>
The Association of Taiwanese Journalists has sent a petition,
which is signed by 31 local media outlets, to U.N. Secretary-
General Ban Ki-moon and the World Health Organization (WHO)
Director-General Margaret Chan to urge them to respect the rights
of Taiwanese reporters, Yih said.
</P>
<P>
In addition, over 20 major international organizations have
voiced support for Taiwan journalists' rights to cover the WHA
activities, Yih stated.
</P>
<P>
Reporters without Borders Secretary-General Robert Menard wrote a
letter to Margaret Chan, saying that the WHO should not bow to
China's pressure and refuse to allow Taiwanese journalists to
attend the annual meeting of the WHO, Yih said.
</P>
<P>
Robert Menard said in the letter that Taiwan's rights to assess
health and information should not be sacrificed for political
reasons, Yih added.
</P>
<P>
Also, the International Press Institute (IPI) expressed its
support for Taiwanese reporters in an annual report last week,
Yih said.
</P>
<P>
The institute stressed that reporters from every country should
enjoy freedom of the press and have the right to cover the WHA,
Yih noted.
</P>
<P>
Several media in Taiwan have filed applications to the U.N. for
press passes, but have not yet received a response, Yih said.
