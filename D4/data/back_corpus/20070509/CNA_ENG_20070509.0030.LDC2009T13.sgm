Premier Su Tseng-chang said Wednesday that he and other relevant
figures will take charge of paying for running an ad in three
local newspapers calling for the quick passage of the 2007
central government budget at the Legislative Yuan.
</P>
<P>
Speaking during the weekly Executive Yuan meeting, Su expressed
appreciation for the donations made by ranking government
officials to run the ad in three major newspapers and added that
he and several enthusiastic figures will pay the NT$800,000.
</P>
<P>
According to Su, the Executive Yuan drafted the ad with the aim
of telling the public that the 2007 budget bill has been
stonewalled in the Legislative Yuan for more than five month --
an unprecedented record in history.
</P>
<P>
Stating that he later felt it is better for him to pay the bill
for the ad, Su said that he is willing to do so instead of making
political appointees share the expenditure.
</P>
<P>
The premier also voiced his discontent after the bill again
failed a day earlier in the Legislative Yuan, attributing the
bill's failure to filibustering  by lawmakers of the main
opposition Kuomintang (KMT) and its ally, the People First Party
(PFP).
</P>
<P>
The insistence of KMT and PFP lawmakers that a bill concerning
the formation of the Central Election Commission (CEC) must be
addressed  before the 2007 budget bill's passage has put the
legislature in total deadlock, Su said.
</P>
<P>
According to Executive Yuan spokesman Chen Mei-ling, Su has
returned the donations to each government official who joined the
fund-raising for the ads that appeared May 4.
</P>
<P>
Along with the ad, notification reading: "The ad spending of
NT$800,000 was donated by political appointees" also appeared. To
date,  donations from ranking government officials amounted to
NT$480,000.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, the Executive Yuan issued a press
release earlier that same day clarifying a report that Su and
Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng would invite the
legislative caucuses of the KMT and the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) to discuss the draft CEC organic law
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Calling the report groundless, the Executive Yuan said that the
DPP's Central Standing Committee has created a task force to deal
with the situation  in the Legislative  Yuan and that it is
inappropriate for the premier to meet legislative caucus whips
for the time being.
