New York,  May 8 (CNA) 05/09/07  20:47:12 (By Huang Chao-ping and

The Taipei Economic and Cultural Office (TECO)  in New York and
the North American Taiwanese Medical Association (NATMA) will
sponsor a seminar May 11 on Taiwan's bid to join the World Health
Organization (WHO) to seek international support for the cause.
</P>
<P>
According to TECO Press Division Director Shao Ping-yun, the
seminar, to be held at the Donnell branch of the New York City
Library, will be chaired by TECO Director-General Andrew L.Y.
Hsia.

<P>
Former Department of Health Minister Twu Shiing-jer, Legislator
Chen Chung-hsin, as well as Wang Cheng-ching, a professor at
Mount Sinai School of Medicine, and Swaziland's Ambassador to the
U.N. Phesheya Mbongeni Dlamini have been invited to attend the
event, Shao said.

<P>
Taiwan is not only a major personnel and commodity transshipment
center in East Asia but also a "transit station" for the
migration of around 350 species of birds, Shao said, adding that
Taiwan's exclusion from the WHO has become a loophole in the
global health system.
</P>
<P>
Shao stated that as a WHO founding member, the Republic of China
had made great contributions to the international health
regulatory body, but after Taiwan pulled out of the U.N. in 1971,
it was also forced to leave the WHO, which he said damaged the
Taiwanese people's human rights.
</P>
<P>
Noting that Taiwan has been rated as the world's  second
healthiest by The Economist, Shao said that over the past 10
years, the nation has offered around US$450 million-worth of
humanitarian and medical assistance to over 90 countries around
the world.
</P>
<P>
However, the official went on, Taiwan suffered serious human
losses during the outbreak of enterovirus in 1998 and the severe
acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreaks in 2003 only because
of its failure to receive relevant information and immediate
assistance from the WHO.
</P>
<P>
Stressing that diseases know no boundaries, the official called
on the international community to throw its support behind
Taiwan's bid to join the international health regulatory body.
