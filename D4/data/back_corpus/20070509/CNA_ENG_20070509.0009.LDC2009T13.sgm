NATURE OF 'SPECIAL FUND' FOCUS OF HEARING ON EX-TAIPEI MAYOR'S
CASE
</HEADLINE>

Taipei, May 8 (CNA) 05/09/07  11:08:40 (By Lilian Wu)

<P>
The nature of a "special allowance fund" for senior officials'
discretionary use was the focus of debate in the third hearing at
the Taipei District Court Tuesday on a corruption case involving
former Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou.
</P>
<P>
Ma, a former chairman of the main opposition Kuomintang who was
recently nominated by the party to run in the 2008 presidential
election, claimed in court that the "special allowance fund" was
a "personal subsidy."
</P>
<P>
His lawyer also cited the views of the Ministry of Justice (MOJ)
in November 2006, which state that the "special allowance fund"
has been appropriated by the government for years and is in
nature a "practical subsidy" to back Ma's claim.
</P>
<P>
According to MOJ views, If the recipients overspend, the
government will not give them extra funds, but if the fund is
unspent after being claimed with receipts, the government will
not ask for the unspent money to be returned. Overscrutiny of the
use of the fund was not the original idea in creating the fund.
</P>
<P>
The lawyer also asked the court to summon 14 witnesses, including
former Taipei Deputy Mayor King Pu-tsung, as well as cashiers
during Ma's stint in the Taipei city government, to shed light on
Ma's perception of the fund and testify that he did not take part
in the process of the reimbursement of the fund with receipts and
hence did not embezzle public funds as stated in the indictment
against him.
</P>
<P>
But Public Prosecutor Huang Huei-min said the Directorate General
of Budget, Accounting and Statistics under the Executive Yuan
should be in charge of the installation, claiming and
reimbursement of the fund, and that the Ministry of Justice only
provides views for reference, which might not count as legal
views.
</P>
<P>
Presiding Judge Tsai Shou-hsun ruled that the legal counselling
views of the Ministry of Justice, as well as Ma's interview with
a local cable station Sept. 7, 2006 and his response during a
question-and-answer session at the Taipei City Council Sept. 18,
2006 will all be valid evidence.
</P>
<P>
The court will hold its next hearing May 22.
</P>
<P>
The prosecution indicted Ma Feb. 13 for embezzling NT$11.17
million (US$338,500) of public funds that went directly into Ma's
bank accounts during his two-term stint as Taipei mayor
1998-2006.
</P>
<P>
But the prosecution in Tainan, while probing a similar special
allowance fund for Tainan Mayor Hsu Tain-tsair, dropped the case,
ruling that the fund is in nature a "subsidy" for senior
officials.
</P>
<P>
For this reason, the Supreme Prosecutors Office convened a
seminar on legal issues and election graft Tuesday, inviting
chief prosecutors and representatives from accounting and
auditing offices to express their views on the "special allowance
fund."
</P>
<P>
State Public Prosecutor-General Chen Tsung-ming said before the
seminar that it is hoped that a set of guidelines will be
produced via open discussion.
</P>
<P>
But the views of the participants were divergent and the only
thing they agreed upon was that probes into "special allowance
funds" should be determined on a case by case basis and it is not
appropriate to give a uniform interpretation.
</P>
<P>
The participants in the meeting decided that the court's right to
exercise its duty in each case should be respected and that it is
not appropriate for the chief prosecutors to make unified
guidelines. The evidence of each case is unique, they said,
adding that objective facts as well as subjective consciousness
will have to be weighed equally.
</P>
<P>
All executives holding public office are given a special
allowance fund every month. Although the money is left up to the
administrative chief's discretion, half of the fund can be spent
without any proof of spending, while use of the other half must
be substantiated with receipts.
</P>
<P>
The prosecution said Ma received NT$10.23 million in special
allowances during his first term from December 1998 to December
2003.
</P>
<P>
However, the expenditure records of Ma's bank accounts show that
he spent only NT$3.49 million of that amount but did not return
the unspent portion -- NT$6.74 million -- to the national
coffers.
</P>
<P>
From January 2004 to July 2006, Ma used NT$630,000 of the NT$5.06
million fund and kept the remaining NT$4.43 million in his
account. The prosecution said that the unspent money during his
two terms, totaling NT$11.17 million, should be considered "gain
from embezzlement."
</P>
<P>
Although taking note of the fact that Ma and his wife donated
tens of millions of dollars to charitable organizations during
his mayoral terms, the prosecution argued that those donations
came mostly from Ma's unspent election campaign funds rather from
his special allowance funds.
