Chou reminded people planning to visit the region to pay
attention to hygiene and to avoid raw food.

He added that the CDC has sent notices to the Tourism Bureau
under the Ministry of Transportation and Communication, travel
agencies and tour guide groups informing them to take
environmental sanitation into account when drawing up tour plans
and to provide tourists with hygiene knowledge.
