While Singapore was still the world's busiest container port,
handling 6.58 million TEUs of containers in the first quarter of
2007, Shanghai outshined Hong Kong with a container throughput of

container traffic compared with the previous year, with Guangzhou
seeing the highest growth at 40.9 percent.

Zhoushan had the second highest growth at 34.9 percent, and
Tianjin, Qingdao, Dalian, Xiamen and Shanghai also saw their
growth rate register more than 20 percent, they said, predicting

good performance in 2007.

Kaohsiung's container traffic ranking dropped from third in 1999
to fourth in 2000 and further to fifth in 2002, when it was
outperformed by Shanghai for the first time. Kaohsiung has held
sixth place since 2003.
