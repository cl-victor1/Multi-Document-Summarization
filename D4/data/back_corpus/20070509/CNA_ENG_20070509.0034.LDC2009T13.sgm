Taiwan's representative office in Japan will provide any
necessary assistance to facilitate a planned Japan visit by
former President Lee Teng-hui, Republic of China Representative
to Japan Koh Se-kai said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Koh told Taiwanese media posted in Japan that his office had not
received Lee's detailed itinerary but had been informed that six
to seven people will accompany Lee on his trip.
</P>
<P>
Messages passed on by friends close to Lee indicate that Lee
hopes to tone down the political implication of his trip and does
not want people to make a fuss over his visit, Koh said.
</P>
<P>
Lee is planning to leave for Japan in late May for a 10-day
visit, during which he will receive a prize marking the 150th
anniversary of the birth of the late Japanese colonial
administrator Shinpei Goto and deliver a speech during the
ceremony, according to sources close to Lee.
</P>
<P>
Lee will also give a speech at Akita International University and
visit Takushoku University, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
Before his return to Taiwan, the former president will host a
social gathering to express his gratitude for his Japanese
friends, with a number of Japanese politicians, including former
Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi, invited to attend the event,
they said.
</P>
<P>
Lee had planned to visit Japan in September 2006 but canceled the
trip because of health concerns.
</P>
<P>
He first visited Okayama Prefecture in April 2001 to receive
treatment for heart disease and made a second trip between
December 2004 and January 2005 to several Japanese cities,
including Nagoya and Kyoto.
