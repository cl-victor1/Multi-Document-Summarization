A round-the-island torch relay to show the world of Taiwan
people's determination to safeguard their country's independent
sovereignty and rectify their country's title and enact a new
constitution drew to an end Sunday after the torch reached the
central city of Taichung.

A spokesman  for  the  908 Taiwan  Republic  Campaign,  a pro-
independence advocacy group which organized the activity, said
the group chose May 13, which happened to be Mother's Day this
year, as the relay's concluding day to highlight their belief
that "Taiwan is everybody's mother who will protect every one of
us all the time."

The relay started Feb. 28 to coincide with the 60th anniversary
of the tragic 228 Indicent of 1947 -- a civilian uprising that
led to a bloody crackdwon by the then-corrupt Kuomintang
government, with Oluanpi on the southernmost tip of the island as
the starting point.

Over the past two and half months, the spokesman said, the torch
has passed through 6,000 stops across the country, receiving
support and encourage from many like-minded people.

"We are grateful that the event has proceeded smoothly with many
people's support and assistance," the spokesman said, adding that
the group will continue working hard to win support from more
people for its cause of making Taiwan a normal country where
freedom, democracy, peace and justice prevail and national
sovereignty faces no threat.
