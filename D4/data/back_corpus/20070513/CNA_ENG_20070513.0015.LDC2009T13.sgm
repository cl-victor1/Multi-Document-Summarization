DPP LAWMAKER SEES HSIEH-SU PRESIDENTIAL TICKET SHAPING

Taipei,  May 13 (CNA) 05/13/07  17:52:01 (By Deborah Kuo)

Chances are increasing that former Premier Frank Hsieh, who is
set to be nominated by the ruling Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) as its presidential candidate, will seek to form a
presidential ticket with outgoing Premier Su Tseng-chang for the
2008 election, a DPP legislator claimed Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Gao Jyh-peng said at a news conference at the Legislative Yuan
that a Hsieh-Su presidential ticket has begun to take shape since
Su resigned from the premiership a day earlier.
</P>
<P>
Su, who suffered a surprise defeat in the DPP's presidential
primary vote May 6, announced his resignation Saturday, saying
that he would step aside to allow President Chen Shui-bian a free
hand to deal with the changing political situation during the
last year of his tenure.
</P>
<P>
Gao added, however, that he does not think Su submitted his
resignation for the purpose of teaming up with Hsieh, although he
claimed it has "become clearer" that the chances of Su
cooperating with Hsieh in the presidential election have
increased since the former stepped down from the premiership.
</P>
<P>
However, Gao's speculation runs counter to previous reports that
Hsieh would choose former Vice Premier Yeh Chu-lan as his running
mate.
