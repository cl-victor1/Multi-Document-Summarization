The Consumer Price Index (CPI) in the first quarter of this year
rose 0.97 percent over the same period of 2006, lower than the
projected 1.4 percent growth rate, an official from the
Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics (DGBAS)
said Wednesday.

<P>
If the core consumer price is eliminated, the annual growth rate
of the CPI would be 0.68 percent, the official said at a press
conference, adding that this represents moderate growth.

<P>
The CPI saw an annual increase of 0.83 percent in March, the
official said, attributing the rise to higher prices of fuel,
cigarettes, oil, and some Chinese herbal medicines.
