Taipei,  April 4 (CNA) 04/04/07  18:26:08 (By Lilian Wu)

<P>
The Far East Air Transport Corp. announced Wednesday a second
wave of air fare cuts, although the cuts will not be as great as
those in the first wave.
</P>
<P>
Trans Asia Airways announced that it would follow suit, cutting
air fares next week at the earliest, while Mandarin Airlines and
Uni Airways Corp. said that they will act after observing market
response.
</P>
<P>
Far East Air Transport officials said that the price cut will be
limited to Taipei-Kaohsiung and Taipei-Tainan flights between
Mondays and Thursdays.
</P>
<P>
Between April 9 and May 31, air fares on the Taipei-Tainan route,
between 9 a.m. and 5 p.m. will be cut by 19 percent to around
NT$1,588 (US$48). Air fares for Taipei-Kaohsiung flights after 6
p.m. will be cut to NT$1,688, or around 24 percent discount.
</P>
<P>
The officials said that all discount air fares will have to be
booked via the Web site of the Far East Air Transport or an on-
site travel service operator www.ezfly.com.
</P>
<P>
Far East announced its first wave of discount air fares last
month,  saying that  passengers  ordering  air  tickets  for
Taipei-Kaohsiung on Saturdays and Sundays via Internet, will pay
NT$1,510, a nearly 30 percent discount on the NT$2,120 ticket
price. The price of a ticket on the high-speed rail system for
the same destination costs NT$1,490.
</P>
<P>
The air fare for a Taipei-Tainan route will be cut to NT$1,350
from NT$1,960, making it the same price for the high-speed rail
system, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
Far East officials  said that the first wave of discount
promotions has borne positive results, raising the average
occupancy rate on weekends by around 25 percent.
</P>
<P>
Whether the first wave of air fare discounts, targeting tourists,
will be extended remains to be seen, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
Faced with the steep competition from the 345-km high-speed rail
system which was inaugurated early this year, all air carriers
have resorted to air fare cuts on long-haul routes. The high-
speed rail system reduces the travel time between Taipei and
Kaohsiung to 90 minutes from the previous four hours and half.
