OPPOSITION LAWMAKER QUESTIONS CPC'S FLOATING OIL PRICING SYSTEM
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

Taipei,  April  4 (CNA) 04/04/07  18:40:38 (By Lilian Wu)
</P>
<P>
A lawmaker of the opposition Taiwan Solidarity  Union  (TSU)
questioned whether  there  are  any irregularities involved in
the state-owned CPC Corp., Taiwan's floating pricing mechanism.
</P>
<P>
Tseng Tsahn-deng, DPP caucus whip in the Legislative Yuan, noted
that since the CPC adopted the floating pricing mechanism earlier
this year, the company's surplus has jumped to NT$3.63 billion
(US$110 million) from losses of around NT$1.36 billion in January
and February.
</P>
<P>
Tseng raised the question as the CPC announced that the petroleum
price would be raised by NT$0.4 per liter, and the diesel price
would be raised by NT$0.7 per liter starting Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the CPC originally listed its losses for 2007 as
NT$3.42 billion, but then adjusted its budget estimates for this
year to show a surplus of NT$14.43 billion.
</P>
<P>
But Tseng also pointed out that the CPC recorded a surplus of
NT$16.53 billion in 2006, even though it wasn't yet practicing
the new system.
</P>
<P>
He said that he worried that the CPC has used the floating
pricing mechanism to frequently and unnecessarily adjust the oil
price, adding that the real problems of the company may lie with
its "poor management."
</P>
<P>
In response, CPC officials said that the floating pricing system
better reflects petroleum market fluctuations, and has helped
make the company profitable.
</P>
<P>
They also said that compared with neighboring countries in Asia,
Taiwan still maintains the lowest petroleum prices.
