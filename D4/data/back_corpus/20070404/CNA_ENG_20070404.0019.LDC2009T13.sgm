Lawmakers of the opposition Kuomintang (KMT) criticized Wednesday
a plan to relocate five Cabinet units from Taipei City to
Hsinchuang in Taipei County, northern Taiwan, while the plan
triggered a strong protest from Kaohsiung Mayor Chen Chu.
</P>
<P>
Minister of the Interior Lee Yi-yang told the Legislative Yuan in
a briefing the previous day that a preliminary plan has been
worked out to relocate the Council of Labor Affairs (CLA), the
Department of Health, the Council for Hakka Affairs, the Council
of Indigenous Peoples, and the Public Construction Commission to
Hsinchuang.
</P>
<P>
KMT Legislator Huang Chao-shun said at a press conference held at
the Legislative Yuan that the plan shows the Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) administration has no intention of
carrying out its proposal to relocate the capital city to
southern Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
While mentioning that Chen had promised during her mayoral
election campaign last December to do her utmost to push for the
relocation of the CLA to the southern port city, Huang urged the
mayor to stand up and fight for her promise to be realized.
</P>
<P>
At Kaohsiung City Hall, Chen, who initiated the idea to relocate
the CLA to Kaohsiung while serving as CLA chairwoman, expressed
her strong opposition to the central government's relocation
proposal while pledging to fight for her cause.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the legislative caucus of the opposition Taiwan
Solidarity Union (TSU) suggested that the relocation of the
Cabinet units be carried out based on geographic and functional
concerns.
</P>
<P>
TSU caucus whip Tseng Tsang-teng questioned why the government
doesn't want to move the CLA and the National Council on Physical
Fitness and Sport to Kaohsiung, when the southern city has the
highest number of industrial workers in the country and as
Tsoying in the city is famous for producing national athletes.
