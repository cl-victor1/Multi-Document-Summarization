Kaohsiung,  April  3 (CNA) 04/04/07  12:13:18 (By Sofia Wu)

The black box from an army UH-1H helicopter that crashed into a
radio tower in bad weather in the mountainous region of southern
Kaohsiung County Tuesday afternoon was recovered later the same
day, officials said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The black box has been turned over to the Army Command for
decoding in the hopes of securing valuable clues into how the
crash happened, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
The chopper crashed onto a road in mountainous Chishan township
in Kaohsiung County after hitting a radio tower owned by the
police-operated Public Radio System amid heavy fog and rain,
killing five senior officers and leaving three missing. No
civilians were injured in the mishap.
</P>
<P>
More than 100 firefighters,  police officers  and military
personnel have been mobilized for the search and rescue mission.
They braved inclement weather to search for the missing
throughout Tuesday night. Helicopters from the National Airborne
Service Corps joined the search mission at 6 a.m. Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The chopper from the Army's Airborne and Special Operations
Command took off from the Kueijen air base in southern Tainan
County at 3: 52 p.m. Tuesday for an airborne surveillance drill.
It lost contact eight minutes later and the military received a
report of its crash at 4:30 p.m.
</P>
<P>
The deceased officers were all from an army airborne cavalry
brigade, one of the country's most elite military units. Among
them were Col. Chen Ming-tung, head of the Airborne Cavalry
Brigade 601 who was known for his diligence and was expected to
be promoted to the rank of major general soon.
</P>
<P>
The other four were Lt. Col. Ma Wen-pin, head of an attack
battalion; Lt. Col. Lai Yu-hung, a chief staff officer; Capt. Wu
Ming-chung,  a co-pilot; and Sgt. Maj. Luo Ming-hua, a chief
technician.
</P>
<P>
Military spokesman Wu Chi-fang said that although the cause of
the crash has yet to be determined, the army has grounded all of
its UH-1H helicopters, pending thorough security checks.
</P>
<P>
An initial investigative report said the crash was probably
caused by bad mountain weather leading to low visibility.
Analysts said the age of the aircraft may have also be a factor.
</P>
<P>
The bodies of the deceased officers were first sent to a hospital
affiliated with I-Shou University in Kaohsiung County's Yenchao
township. Defense Minister Lee Jye visited the hospital to pay
tribute to the deceased and extend his condolences to their
bereaved family members.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the deceased had sacrificed their lives while flying
a training mission, Lee said the military will offer the best
possible pecuniary aid for their bereaved families. Lee also said
the military will continue the search for the three missing
officers.
</P>
<P>
Tuesday's crash was the third mishap involving the U.S.-built UH-
1H chopper model since it was introduced into Taiwan in the early
1970s.
</P>
<P>
On Dec. 27, 1974, a UH-1H crashed in Lungkang in northern Taoyuan
County, killing three lieutenant generals and leaving then-Army
Commander-in-Chief Gen. Yu Hao-chang seriously injured. Another
lieutenant general on board also sustained severe injuries in the
accident.
</P>
<P>
The second mishap occurred May 3, 1986 when two UH-1Hs collided
in mid-air during a military review, killing all 18 paratroopers
aboard. The disaster has come to be known as the "503 Calamity."
Then-paratroop brigade chief Teng Chu- lin, who is now the
country's representative to Poland, didn't take a single day off
for three months as he insisted on accompanying the emotionally
traumatized paratroop unit in passing their darkest days
following the tragedy.
