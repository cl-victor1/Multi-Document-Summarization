The Child Welfare League Foundation laid out Wednesday its three
core pursuits: the "survival, health and safety" of Taiwan's
minors, and its hope that all youngsters will be happy and safe
on Women's and Children's Day.
</P>
<P>
Foundation officials urged parents to spend at least 30 minutes
daily with their children, hug them for at least three minutes
every day, praise them three times every day and listen to them
for three minutes every day.
</P>
<P>
Most importantly, if children are to feel secure, they must be
able to access adult assistance within three minutes, in a safe
environment, if need arises, foundation officials urged.
</P>
<P>
According to a nationwide  investigation  conducted by the
foundation on Taiwanese children's human rights in 2006, the
index for local children's survival rights scored only 49 points,
the worst score among all the areas surveyed and markedly below
the 60-point passing threshold.
</P>
<P>
Last year, a total of 10,094 children and teenagers were reported
as abused to relevant authorities, 13 of whom died as a result of
abuse and 31 of whom were killed along with their parents in
incidents of filicide-suicide, statistics compiled by the
Children's Bureau of the Ministry of the Interior showed.
</P>
<P>
This means that on average, one child would be abused by an adult
every 52 minutes in Taiwan, and one child would be killed every
eight days, according to the bureau's tallies.
</P>
<P>
In the first quarter of this year, five children in Taiwan died
from maltreatment, nearly one-third of last year's number,
foundation officials said, expressing their grave concern that
many Taiwanese children find themselves in similar situations
given that some 20 percent of children surveyed acknowledged that
they are often beaten or harshly punished by their parents.
</P>
<P>
Citing the investigation's findings, foundation officials said
that 46 percent of Taiwanese children often feel upset, that 70
percent worry about infectious diseases and a similar percentage
are concerned about threats to their personal safety, such as
kidnapping. On average, one child dies from accident every 1.4
days in Taiwan, they added.
</P>
<P>
Earlier the same day, opposition Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU)
lawmakers asked the government to pay greater heed and provide
greater assistance to issues pertaining to children's interests
and rights at a news conference in the Legislative Yuan.
</P>
<P>
Some 3.17 million Taiwanese children face safety threats stemming
from poor facilities at school, deteriorating public order,
traffic disorder,  and school yard  bullying,  in addition  to
physical deficiencies,  family economic straits,  scholastic
burdens and corporal punishment.
</P>
<P>
According to TSU legislative caucus whip Tseng Tsahn-deng,
nationwide there are some 40,000 local children are being raised
by their grandparents, 100,000 mentally or physically retarded
children, and 200,000 children being reared in single-parent
households.
</P>
<P>
Last year, 6,602 sexual offenses cases involving minors under 18
years old were reported to the authorities, and 1.28 million
children were concerned that they might be kidnapped, Tseng said,
pointing out that these relatively high numbers indicate that
Taiwan children are not growing up in a safe and secure
environment.
