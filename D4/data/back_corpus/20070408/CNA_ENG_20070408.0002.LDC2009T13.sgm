KMT LAWMAKERS' REACTIONS MIXED TO REVISING PARTY 'EXCLUSION'
RULES
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taipei, April 8 (CNA) 04/08/07  20:36:10 (By Flor Wang)
</P>
<P>
Lawmakers of the main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) had mixed
responses Sunday to a proposal that the party modify a rule
excluding indicted members from taking part in any elections,
with some expressing concern that doing so would erode the
party's image and affect its chances in December's legislative
polls.
</P>
<P>
Light was shed on the issue after Legislative Speaker Wang Jin-
pyng  issued Saturday  a  statement  congratulating  KMT
Chairman-elect Wu Poh-hsiung and warning the KMT central about
revising its "exclusion rules."
</P>
<P>
The KMT central should refrain from making the revision, as the
move might spark a split within the party and push it to
backtrack, Wang argued in the statement.
</P>
<P>
Wang issued the call, aimed at Wu, who has long been viewed as
supportive of former KMT Chairman Ma Ying-jeou -- the most likely
KMT candidate in the March 2008 presidential election despite his
embezzlement charges in mid-February, which prompted him to
resign from the party's top post.
</P>
<P>
Despite corruption charges, Ma has repeatedly expressed his
desire to run in the next presidential election, and last week
picked up a registration form for the KMT's presidential primary.
</P>
<P>
Wang, also a KMT heavyweight who harbors his own presidential
ambitions, did not pick up the registration form, meaning that he
would not join the party's presidential primary and will miss out
on the chance to be nominated by the KMT.
</P>
<P>
Taoyuan Magistrate Chu Li-lun, a member of the KMT who maintains
good relations with Ma, said the same day that it is up to the
party's delegates to decide whether or not a rule change should
be implemented.
</P>
<P>
"It is necessary to continue with party reform which should be
dictated by the KMT's actual needs rather than the ruling party's
election strategies, " Chu said, adding that the matter must be
jointly determined by party delegates.
</P>
<P>
Chu said he does not agree with Wang's viewpoint that a
regulation amendment will push the KMT to split, but added that
every member in the party is free to air his or her own opinion
for discussion.
</P>
<P>
Echoing Chu's comments, KMT Legislator Lai Shyh-bao, who is
widely taken to be a protege of Ma, opined that no one, neither
the party central, could determine whether or not the regulations
should be modified.
</P>
<P>
As a democratic political party, the issue must be decided after
being fully studied by delegates in the party's national congress
slated for June, Lai said, adding that it is still too early to
discuss the matter now.
</P>
<P>
In contrast, KMT Legislator Ho Tsai-feng urged Wu to carefully
and wisely deal with the proposal regarding an amendment to the
party's "exclusion" regulations, as it may hinder the party's
chances in the year-end legislative election, which also will
serve as a litmus test for the March 2008 presidential election.
</P>
<P>
Yu Shyi-kun, chairman of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) , commented later the same day in southern Kaohsiung City
that the KMT's intention to revise the party's regulations to
firm up Ma's chances of participating in the next presidential
election clearly showed that the party does not deserve the
people's trust.
</P>
<P>
Former Premier and former Kaohsiung Mayor Frank Hsieh, a DPP
heavyweight  vying for the party's nomination  for the coming
presidential, said during a campaign stop in Kaohsiung County
that the KMT's rule change plan fully reflects the party's
hopelessness, and that the people of Taiwan must not allow such a
corrupt political party to regain power in 2008.
