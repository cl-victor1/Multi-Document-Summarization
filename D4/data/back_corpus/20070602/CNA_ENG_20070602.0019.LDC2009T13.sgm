More than 80 volunteers will start paying home visits in July to
new immigrant families in Taipei City and Taipei County in a
program that seeks to help new arrivals adjust to Taiwan's
environment and culture, organizers said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The volunteers, who are mostly retired workers, will try to
collect information and learn about the problems that foreign
spouses face and tell stories to children in their upcoming home
visits under the program organized by the Eden Social Welfare
Foundation, said Huang Juo-sung, executive director of the
foundation.
</P>
<P>
Four foreign spouses -- three from Vietnam and one from Indonesia
-- and two men who are married to Vietnamese women are among the
most notable volunteers in the program.
</P>
<P>
Huynh Trang Phuong Thuy, who came to Taiwan five years ago when
she was just 20, said she decided to join the program because she
understands how difficult it is adjusting to a new environment.
As happy and comfortable as she is now, Huynh said she felt the
urge to reach out a helping hand to her "Vietnamese sisters."
</P>
<P>
Lin Jian-chung, who is married to a Vietnamese women, also joined
the program, determined to help thousands of new immigrant
families like his own.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Yen Wei-te, a graduate student at National Taiwan
University, said he joined the program "to involve myself more in
social activities, rather than just focusing on studying."
</P>
<P>
Volunteers like Huynh Trang, Lin and Yen will be assigned to
different regions, such as Sanchong and Sindian,  and provide
counseling,  story-telling  and Chinese-language  learning  book
distributing services. Having received just three days of
training and being fully aware of the possibility of being turned
away at the door on their visits to the homes of new immigrants,
the volunteers said they are still upbeat about the task they
will embark upon Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"This is only the beginning of a massive and important project
that tries to respond to a national issue, " said Huang.
</P>
<P>
According to Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) statistics, an
estimated average of 12,000 Vietnamese women arrive in Taiwan
every year in mixed marriages, Huang said, adding that currently,
one out of every four babies born in Taiwan is born into a new
immigrant family.
</P>
<P>
"The new immigrant issue has been ranked in the top three of the
ten most important social issues of the future by analysts and
observers, which means the government and civil groups have to
look at and deal with the issue seriously as soon as possible, "
he noted.
</P>
<P>
The program is mainly being sponsored by Cathay Life Charity
Foundation.
