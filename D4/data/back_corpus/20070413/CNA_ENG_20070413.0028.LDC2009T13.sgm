ULTRA RUNNER PROMOTES SPORT WITH 'ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION'
MINDSET

Taipei,  April 13 (CNA) 04/13/07  18:47:19 (By Deborah Kuo)

<P>
Taiwan's ultra-endurance marathoner Kevin Lin called for the
public Friday to adopt an environmental protection mindset while
engaging in sports.
</P>
<P>
At a colloquium sponsored by the Government Information Office
(GIO), Lin, 30, who has been running over the past 20 years and
set many world records by crossing the Sahara Desert's grueling
7,300 kilometers by foot with two other marathoners early this
year, called for professional and amateur athletes alike to help
protect natural resources around the globe.
</P>
<P>
Noting that some 10,080 liters of air will be compromised by the
combustion of each liter of gasoline, Lin said it is everybody's
responsibility to protect the environment and cherish global
natural resources, especially now when the environment is
increasingly being compromised.
</P>
<P>
Lin, along with an American and a Canadian, ran 111 consecutive
days to cross the Sahara, enduring strong winds, which can
abruptly raise sandstorms, making it difficult to see and
breathe, and extreme temperatures, which might peak as high as 38
degrees Celsius during the day but dip below freezing at night,
on the trek, which was originally scheduled to finish in 80 days.
</P>
<P>
At several points in their trek, Lin said, the trekkers stopped
near sparsely populated wells to talk with villagers and nomads
about the difficulties they face finding water -- prompting them
to plan a fund-raiser for the non-profit group H2O Africa, which
was established to raise awareness about the need for clean water
throughout the African continent.
</P>
<P>
Lin said peoples around the world should love and help each other
and in particular, help African peoples to secure access to clean
water.
</P>
<P>
He said that running in "extreme" places around the world,
including the North Pole, has helped him realize that one does
not know how big the world is without going out to experience it,
and that one does not realize how valuable life is without
risking it.
</P>
<P>
Lin said he will see to it that a life foundation for athletes is
established within 10 years as a means to thank his mentor, Pan
Jui-keng, to give back to Taiwanese society, and to financially
help top-level athletes so that they can devote themselves to
competitions abroad without worry.
