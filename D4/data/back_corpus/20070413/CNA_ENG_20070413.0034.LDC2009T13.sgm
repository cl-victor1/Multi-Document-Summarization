An audit showing that total revenues of state-run Taiwan Tobacco
and Liquor Corp. (TTL) in 2005 decreased by NT$4.9 billion
(US$148 million) over the previous year, with revenues in tobacco
and liquor both falling, Auditor-General Su Chen-ping said
Friday.
</P>
<P>
The decline in TTL's 2005 business turnover was caused by the
implementation of the Tobacco and Liquor Tax Act in 2002 that
allowed for private breweries and distilleries, and the market
was flooded by counterfeit and smuggled products, Su said, adding
that TTL's failure to expand into global markets is also a reason
for its decline.
</P>
<P>
The report shows the TTL's total revenues from tobacco sales
declined by more than NT$2.1 billion, falling 7.5 percent, while
revenues from best-selling tobacco products dropped by 20
percent, and sales of new products fell by 50-80 percent year-on-
year. While total revenues from liquor decreased NT$2.4 billion,
or 19.35 percent, mostly in sales of Kaoliang liquor.
</P>
<P>
The report shows that rice wine breweries owned by TTL are
operating at less than 20 percent of capacity, a decline
apparently greater than that in 2004.
</P>
<P>
Su said the Ministry of Audit has urged the TTL to come up with
solutions for better operations, and marketing strategies to
improve its revenues.
