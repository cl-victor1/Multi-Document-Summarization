Tainan County Magistrate Su Huan-chih said Friday that the county
should merge with Tainan City to form a single municipality and
be placed under the direct authority of the Executive Yuan.
</P>
<P>
Su told a press conference that Tainan County and City should
follow the example of Taichung City and County in central Taiwan
by reqquesting that Tainan City and County become a special
municipality under the Cabinet.
</P>
<P>
Taichung County and City councils formally requested in 2002 that
the two administrative areas be allowed to merge into a single
municipality under the direct jurisdiction of the Cabinet, but
the central government has not yet reached a final decision.
</P>
<P>
Su said it is important that Tainan City and County be merged and
upgraded to the same status as Taipei and Kaohsiung, otherwise
the area will eventually become a satellite of the southern
Taiwan port city, Kaohsiung.
</P>
<P>
Tainan Mayor Hsu Tien-tsai echoed Su's call, saying that he too
has long called for a merger between Tainan City and County.
</P>
<P>
Hsu pointed out that as a city rich in history and culture,
Tainan deserves to be a municipality under the direct control of
the Cabinet, just as Kyoto, Japan, enjoys a higher status than
other cities due to its cultural heritage.
