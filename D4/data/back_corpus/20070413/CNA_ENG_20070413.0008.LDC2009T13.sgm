Joseph Wu, who just stepped down as Mainland Affairs Council
chairman, was sworn in Thursday as Taiwan's new representative to
the United States, and promised to strengthen Taiwan's relations
with the U.S.

The swearing-in ceremony was held at the office of the Ministry
of Foreign Affairs (MOFA), with Foreign Minister James Huang
standing as witness.

Huang expressed hope that Wu would strengthen communications with
both the U.S. government and the American private sector to
reduce misunderstandings between the two countries and build
mutual trust for bilateral benefit.

Hailing Wu as an experienced and well educated public servant,
Huang said Wu was responsible for foreign affairs when he served
as Presidential Office deputy secretary-general.

During his tenure as chairman of Mainland Affairs Council (MAC),
Wu was in charge of explaining Taiwan's policies toward China to
the United States, Japan and European countries, Huang added,
