A zoo veterinarian whose left forearm was bitten off by a
crocodile Wednesday has undergone a successful limb reattachment
operation, Kaohsiung Medical University Hospital said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, officials of the Kaohsiung municipal Shou Shan Zoo
said the male Nile crocodile, which had to be shot twice with a
police officer's pistol before it would let go of the severed
arm, appeared to be intact thanks to its thick armor, though a
more thorough check will need to be conducted later. It was
previously assumed to have been shot dead.
</P>
<P>
The incident  took place Wednesday  afternoon  when senior
veterinarian Chang Po-yu was trying to remove anesthetic needles
from the crocodile, which seemed inactive and anorectic for about
a week, prompting Chang to check its health, according to zoo
officials.
</P>
<P>
While Chang was rushed to the hospital, a police officer was
called to shoot the crocodile in order to retrieve the severed
arm still held in its mouth. Upon being shot the second time, the
crocodile violently swung its head and flung the limb over the
railing and out of the compound.
</P>
<P>
The medical team said it was fortunate that the forearm was
retrieved quickly enough to attempt a reattachment operation.
</P>
<P>
An overnight operation successfully reconnected most of the blood
vessels, nerves and muscles, a hospital spokesman said, adding
that infection is the primary risk facing the patient, who will
remain in the Intensive Care Unit for at least the next week or
two.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman also said that it would take several years of
rehabilitation to bring the injured arm back to even 80 percent
of functionality, which is the best that can hoped for.
</P>
<P>
Kaohsiung City Mayor Chen Chu Thursday morning visited Chang, who
was able to wave with his healthy right hand to cameras from his
sickbed after the operation.
</P>
<P>
The city's Labor Standards Inspection Office has ordered the zoo
not to allow its staff to enter the crocodile compound before it
produces a report on improving its working practices.
</P>
<P>
The incident made the crocodile a popular attraction, drawing
more-then-usual visitors to the scene, many of whom crossed the
security cordon around the compound to get a better view.
</P>
<P>
In related events, several newspapers published graphic images
featuring the crocodile holding a severed arm in its mouth,
sparking outcry by lawmakers, scholars and the Government
Information Office (GIO).
</P>
<P>
Wang Hsing-nan, the ruling Democratic Progressive Party's (DPP)
legislature whip, said the press has shown no self-constraint at
all and the DPP caucus will not rule out drafting a new law to
regulate the print press.
</P>
<P>
An act governing publishing, seen as a relic of the authoritarian
era, was abolished in 1999.
</P>
<P>
Kuomintang lawmaker Hsu Shao-ping said three out of the four
national major daily newspapers, the China Times, the United
Daily News and the Apple Daily, should apologize to the public
for running the bloody pictures. Only the Liberty Times blurred
the broken arm in its publication.
</P>
<P>
Kuan Chung-hsiang, a communications scholar and Chairman of the
Media Watch Foundation, said such a "disgusting" lack of
discretion will only cause public resentment of the newspapers.
</P>
<P>
Lo Shih-hung, associate professor at the Graduate Institute of
Telecommunications of the National Chung Cheng University,
encouraged readers to call newspapers to voice protest.
</P>
<P>
The GIO, in a news release, called on the media to exercise self-
restraint, and for civil society groups to help monitor media
practices.
</P>
<P>
The release said the GIO had previously suggested that the
Ministry of the Interior draft an amendment to the Child and
Juvenile Welfare Law to ban media practices of this sort, which
may harm the nation's youth.
