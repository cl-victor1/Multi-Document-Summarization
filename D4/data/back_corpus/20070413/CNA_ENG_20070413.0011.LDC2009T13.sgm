The legislative caucus of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) called Friday for solidarity among the party's four
presidential aspirants and urged their close aides to show
restraint by not attacking other hopefuls.
</P>
<P>
Ker Chien-ming, caucus whip of the DPP in the legislature, said
that with the party's upcoming presidential primary, attacks
among the hopefuls -- Vice President Annette Lu, Premier Su
Tseng-chang, DPP Chairman Yu Shyi-kun, and former Premier Frank
Hsieh -- have become more fierce.
</P>
<P>
Ker noted that the party's presidential primary is set to kick
off in May, with a party member vote and a series of public
opinion polls to be held before the party's presidential
candidate is announced May 30.
</P>
<P>
He urged the presidential hopefuls to stop their close aides from
attacking other hopefuls, adding that rifts caused now by such
attacks may prove too large to heal later.
</P>
<P>
He said that the DPP will only survive with solidarity, noting
that the Kuomintang is "waiting in the wings" to take advantage
of any errors the DPP may make.
</P>
<P>
He also expressed the hope that President Chen Shui-bian will
continue to coordinate among the four DPP heavyweights after they
take part Saturday  in the first  of two scheduled  platform
presentations.
</P>
<P>
Legislator Wang Sing-nan, another DPP caucus whip, said that
continued  fighting among the four aspirants  will disappoint
supporters and have disastrous consequences.
</P>
<P>
DPP Legislator Yeh Yi-jin said that the four hopefuls should not
forget that the primary will produce only one candidate to
represent the party in the 2008 presidential election.
</P>
<P>
A prospective national leader should display a graceful manner,
she said, expressing regret that the four aspirants have resorted
to attacking one another. She added that such attacks will make
it difficult to convince voters that they can trust the DPP
candidate in the presidential election, regardless of who that
candidate may be.
