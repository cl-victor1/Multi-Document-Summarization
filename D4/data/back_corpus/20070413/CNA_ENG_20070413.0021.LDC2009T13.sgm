Taipei,  April,  13 (CNA) 04/13/07  16:39:34 (By Elizabeth Hsu)

Premier Su Tseng-chang said Friday that he will step aside to let
Lin Yi-hsiung -- one of the pioneers of the democratic movement
in Taiwan who is widely respected within the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) -- run for the presidency of the country
if Lin decides to do so.
</P>
<P>
Su made the remarks in a question-and-answer session at the
Legislative Yuan when asked by Legislator Lee Chia-chin of the
opposition Kuomintang whether or not he would support a
presidential bid by Lin by withdrawing from the DPP primary for
the 2008 presidential election.
</P>
<P>
Su said Lin is the politician he respects the most and that Lin
has made a great contribution to the development of Taiwan's
democratic politics while sacrificing a great deal for the
democratic movement. He said he admires Lin's great tolerance and
his charitable manner toward those who harmed him and his family,
noting that if Lin decides to run for president, he will step
aside and give Lin his full support.
</P>
<P>
Lin served as DPP chairman from 1998-2000, during which time he
helped Chen Shui-bian win the 2000 presidential election, ending
the Kuomintang's five- decade hold on power. However, since that
election, Lin has gradually pulled himself out of the political
scene.
</P>
<P>
Lin renounced his DPP membership Jan. 24, 2006 in a statement, in
which he said constant inter-party conflict and hostility over
the past several years has led to ethnic divisions and social
unrest. Expressing his disappointment with the DPP and other
domestic political parties, Lin declared that he has no intention
of serving in the DPP's administration or running for public
office for the party.
</P>
<P>
Earlier on Friday, a "Lin's Friends" association was founded in a
bid to gather support around Taiwan for a planned move to
persuade Lin to participate in the presidential election next
year.
</P>
<P>
Asked about the new campaign, Vice President Annette Lu, one of
the four DPP aspirants for the presidency, declined to make a
comment, only saying that if Lin decides to run for president in
2008, he won't represent the DPP because he has already quit the
party.
