Five companies competed Monday in a qualification preview session
for the soon- to-be-released government shareholdings in the
Taiwan Television Enterprise (TTV) , but the proceedings  were
marred in controversy over transfers of the terrestrial
television broadcaster's Japanese holdings.
</P>
<P>
The tender and award of 25.77 percent of the TTV's shares will be
postponed from Mar. 30 to Apr. 11 to allow bidders to supply more
detailed materials and thereby ensure that the public interest is
well served, said Vice Premier Tsai Ing-wen.
</P>
<P>
Want Want Group's representative, Wang Lin-hsiang raised concerns
during the session over the sale of TTV shares by its Japanese
investors toa particular buyer,and called on the preview panel to
act in accordance with the rules and not disappoint the bidders.
</P>
<P>
Another bidder, Hung Bang Construction is widely seen to be
closely connected with the Liberty Times Group.  Hung Bang's
representative Lan Tzu-wei, who is also a high-ranking manager of
the Liberty Times, said the two companies have no connections in
business or capital, adding that the only connection is thatthe
founders of the two companies are old friends.
</P>
<P>
However, Lan said, Hung Bang would not rule out cooperating with
the newspaper to run the TV station if it wins the tender.
</P>
<P>
An official of Japan's Fuji Television Network held a news
conference a day earlier to accuse Government Information Office
(GIO) Minister Cheng Wen-tsang of lobbying in January the
Japanese TV broadcaster to sell its holdings in the TTV to the
Liberty Times Group because the group is close to the Democratic
Progressive Party administration.
</P>
<P>
Fuji TV later sold its holdings in the TTV to a company privately
set up by TTV chairman Lai Kuo-chou, who was last week replaced
for purchasing TTV shares from Japanese investors including Fuji
TV.
</P>
<P>
Responding to the media before attending the preview session,
Cheng denied the accusation of Fuji TV official Sumio Hasegawa,
saying that the government did not favor any company.
</P>
<P>
At the Legislative Yuan, lawmakers from the Committee of Finance
questioned the equity and transparency of the government holding
sale and adopted a resolution to demand a halt to the sale of the
TTV shares controlled by the Ministry of Finance until rumors of
government intervention are put to rest.
