Despite dwindling domestic air traffic last year as a whole,
passenger numbers at Chingchuankang Airport in central Taichung
County increased slightly in 2006, Civil Aeronautics
Administration (CAA) Director-General Chang Kuo-cheng said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
According to Chang, the number of passengers using the airport
rose slightly year on year by 1,000 to 693,000 for the whole of
last year, which he described as a "rare" increase compared to an
average decline of 10 percent registered by the rest of the
airports in western Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Chang attributed the growth in the last two years to the
airport's short-haul outbound charter flight services to Japan,
Hong Kong, South Korea and Vietnam, which helped offset a drop in
the number of passengers flying domestic routes as a result of
the increasingly comprehensive highway infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
Most of the outbound charter flights departing Chingchuankang
Airport were 90 percent full during the period, he noted.
</P>
<P>
But the CAA head was reserved about the proposal of making
Chingchuankang Airport fully international,  mainly because its
facilities have a long way to go before they will be able to
serve long-haul international charter flights.
