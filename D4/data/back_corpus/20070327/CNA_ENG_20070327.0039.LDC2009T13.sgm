`HARSH PROSECUTION' WRONGS MATSU PEOPLE: LAWYER
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

Taipei March,  27 (CNA) 03/27/07  21:09:35 (By Y.C. Jou)

A legal aid foundation claimed Tuesday that what it described as
"harsh" prosecution made 10 percent of Matsu island's 5,000
residents defendants in voting irregularity cases and it called
on law enforcement agencies to "improve their practice" to better
protect human rights.
</P>
<P>
Speaking via videophone at a conference held by the Legal Aid
Foundation, a Matsu single mother of two claimed that she was
indicted on the charge of interfering with voting only because
the police visited her home three times and found no one home
during the day because she was at work as a taxi driver.
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors ruled that she failed to "live for four consecutive
months at her Matsu residence as required by the Public Officials
Election and Recall Act in order to be allowed to vote, she said.
</P>
<P>
The woman was acquitted with help from the foundation, but there
are still many Matsu people involved in litigation, said Joseph
Lin, chief of the foundation's Taipei branch.
</P>
<P>
A small constituency, the outlaying Matsu islands have been
troubled by the problem of so-called "ghost population,"
referring to people with their residency registered in the
constituency but who do not actually live there and only show up
to vote or even get others to impersonate them during elections.
</P>
<P>
Voting with an intended "deceptive" residency registration is
punishable by up to five years in jail.
</P>
<P>
According to Lin, the net of enforcement is too wide both in
practice and stipulation. After the December 2001 lawmaker and
magistrate election, 502 people among the island's 5,000 people
were indicted, Lin said.
</P>
<P>
He claimed that prosecutors are too strict in deciding whether
the defendants live there, making people "excessively vulnerable
to prosecution."
</P>
<P>
He further claimed that the requirement of "habitation for four
consecutive months" is also unfair. "People with Matsu origin
move to Taiwan for various reasons but that should not deprive
them of their right to participate in the public affairs of their
home," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said prosecution should be confined to those who have no
connection with the constituency.
