<P>
Nearly US$50,000 in cash has been stolen from a heavily guarded
warehouse at Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport's cargo
terminal, police said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The money was part of a stash confiscated by Taipei Customs from
passengers carrying excessive amounts of money while entering or
exiting the country.
</P>
<P>
Customs officials stored the money in an Evergreen Warehouse
special vault pending sending the money to the national treasury,
as they believed the warehouse to be the safest place for the
money.
</P>
<P>
However, an Evergreen manager noticed Tuesday that the cash was
packaged differently and reported it to the Customs office.
</P>
<P>
With the presence of police detectives, the package was unpacked
and Customs officials found that of the 900 US$100 bills
deposited in the vault, 498 were missing.
</P>
<P>
Police said they were scrutinizing security videotapes in the
hope of finding suspects in the rare theft case.
