A group of academics and experts from Taiwan and Japan called
Monday for the two nations to strengthen bilateral cooperation in
order to promote peace and stability in the Asia-Pacific area.
</P>
<P>
They made the appeal at the 34th Asia-Pacific Seminar held that
day in Tokyo under the auspices of the Japan-based Society of
Chinese Studies and the Institute of International Relations
(IIR) under Taiwan's National Chengchi University.
</P>
<P>
Around 80 academics and experts from the two countries attended
the seminar, which focused on political activity in East Asia,
China's economic development and regional security protection.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the opening ceremony, IIR Director Cheng Jui-yao, who
headed the Taiwan delegation at the seminar, said China's
increasing defense spending and military buildup have triggered
great concern in the international community.
</P>
<P>
According  to Cheng,  East Asia is full of vitality  and
opportunities  but is facing  severe  challenges  in resolving
energy-related problems.
</P>
<P>
Republic of China Representative to Japan Ko Se-kai, who also
attended the seminar, said China's increasing military spending
poses a great threat to the stability of Taiwan, Japan and
Southeast Asia. He called on the Japanese government to continue
to support Taiwan's bid to join the United Nations and the World
Health Organization.
</P>
<P>
Japanese Dietman Tamazawa Tokuichiro said the U.S.-Japan alliance
is aimed mainly at deterring China's military ambition, but he
added that its ultimate goal is to prompt China's
democratization.
</P>
<P>
Tokuichiro also stressed the importance of Taiwan's strategic
position, urging Japan, the United States and Taiwan to step up
trilateral cooperation to help maintain regional peace and
stability.
</P>
<P>
Nakajima Mineo, president of Akita International University,
pointed  out China's  unsound  economic  fundamentals  and its
increasingly serious environmental protection problem, which he
said will have a negative impact on global economic development.
</P>
<P>
According to Mineo, Taiwan's democratization has enhanced the
Taiwan people's consciousness of Taiwanese identity and the
country's 2008 presidential election will be of great
significance for Asia and the whole world.
</P>
<P>
Yang Yung-ming, a professor at National Taiwan University, said
Taiwan-Japan relations have seen significant improvement since
2000, mainly thanks to President Chen Shui-bian's strenuous
efforts to step up bilateral exchanges and Japan's Taiwan policy
adopted by former Prime Minister Koizumi Junichiro.
