The Taipei District Court Monday sentenced two Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) lawmakers to detention for slander
against a former DPP chairman who launched a protest movement in
September last year against government corruption.
</P>
<P>
DPP Legislator Lin Kuo-ching was sentenced to 50 days in
detention, while his colleague Huang Chao-hui received a lesser
term of 30 days imprisonment.
</P>
<P>
Both sentences may be commuted by paying a fine calculated at
NT$1,000 per day, according to the court's ruling.
</P>
<P>
The court held the two DPP legislators responsible for using
offensive language against former DPP Chairman Shih Ming-teh at a
press conference on Sept. 7 last year.
</P>
<P>
The presiding judge ruled that as the press conference was
unrelated to their legislative duties, the two DPP legislators do
not enjoy the immunity extended to all lawmakers to shield them
from legal redress for remarks made during a legislative session.
</P>
<P>
When informed of the court ruling, Lin said he will consult his
lawyer about what he will do next.
</P>
<P>
Huang also said he will consider later whether he will appeal the
ruling to a higher court.
