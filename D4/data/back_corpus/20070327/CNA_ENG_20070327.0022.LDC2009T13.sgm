Taipei, March 27 (CNA) 03/27/07  18:24:54 (By Ruth Wang)

<P>
President Chen Shui-bian has said that relations between Taiwan
and south Pacific island nation Nauru will strengthen further on
the existing diplomatic basis.
</P>
<P>
Chen made the statement Monday when he met with Nauruan Foreign
Affairs, Trade, and Finance Minister David Adeang at the
Presidential Office.
</P>
<P>
Adeang is visiting Taiwan to attend the opening of Embassy of the
Republic of Nauru, which began operations after a grand opening
cocktail party Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Chen pointed out that Nauru expressed its willingness to set up
an embassy in Taiwan during his visit to that country in 2006,
the first by a Taiwanese president. As a result, Nauruan
Ambassador Ludwig D. Keke presented his credentials to Chen March
7 this year, thereby becoming Nauru's first ambassador to Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Chen expressed gratitude on behalf of Taiwan's people and
government to Adeang and Nauruan President Ludwig Scotty for
their firm,  unstinting  support of Taiwan in its attempts to
join international organizations such as the United Nations, the
World Health Organization, and the Pacific Islands Forum.
</P>
<P>
Chen said he was satisfied with diplomatic developments between
the two countries after the resumption of formal diplomatic ties
in May 2005.
</P>
<P>
Adeang's visit to Taiwan, and the previous visit by President
Scotty and Nauruan Parliament Speaker Valdon Dowiyogo March 20,
shows that  the  two  countries are enjoying  frequent,  high-
level interactions, Chen said.
