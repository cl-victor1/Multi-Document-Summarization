The National Communications Commission (NCC) said Tuesday that it
might fine several television stations for airing footage
produced by a gangster showing himself wielding guns and
threatening to kill his rival.
</P>
<P>
The NCC in a news release said such airing could have violated
stipulations that the content of TV programs should not be
against public order and good morals and that images in TV news
should be of the "general" grade, meaning they are suitable for
all ages. It added that the matter will be discussed in a
consultancy committee before a decision is made.

Chou Cheng-pao, a 33-year-old Taichung criminal, had appeared on
several TV broadcasts since late Monday. In the footage that he
shot and mailed to a TV station, the flak-vest-wearing Chou sits
behind a table on which two M-16 rifles and two handguns are
displayed.
</P>
<P>
Chou in the footage claims that he conducted three recent
shootings that injured his former gang boss Liu Juey-jung and two
accomplices.
</P>
<P>
He accused Liu of masterminding the March 23 murder of gangster
Lin Chen-hsing and betraying followers. Lin had been released on
controversial bail for his role in a kidnapping of Taichung City
Council Speaker Chang Hung-nien in 2001.
</P>
<P>
Chou claimed that he will continue to hunt Liu. He pointed a
handgun at the camera and said: "I'll kill you when I see you."
</P>
<P>
According to the NCC, some television stations obtained the video
from the Taichung city police. Minister of the Interior Lee Yi-
yang said officials responsible for the leak will be "severely
punished" if the investigation proves the NCC claim to be true.
