CASINO DECISION DUE IN SIX MONTHS: CEPD CHIEF
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taipei,  March 27 (CNA) 03/27/07  21:59:15 (By Flor Wang)
</P>
<P>
The government will come up within six months with a decision on
whether to allow the opening of casinos, Cabinet-level Council
for Economic Planning and Development (CEPD) Chairwoman Ho Mei-
yueh said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Ho made the remarks while fielding questions at the Legislative
Yuan from main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Legislator Chao Erh-
chung, who complained about a rumor that the central government
has set its sights on one of four cities and counties that
include Taichung and Yunlin counties in central Taiwan, as a
possible location for a casino.
</P>
<P>
Chao argued that such a decision, if true, will deal a heavy blow
to several offshore counties long hoping to vie for the
opportunity to bolster their economic development, such as Kinmen
and the Penghu islands.
</P>
<P>
Firmly denying the rumor that the CEPD has targeted any
particular city or county, Ho said the council is still working
on the project and is slated to come up with a comprehensive
evaluation report within six months.
</P>
<P>
The key point for the CEPD in evaluating the contentious issue,
Ho said, is that the establishment of casinos, no matter whether
on Taiwan proper or the outlying islands, must create greater
added value to the development of the local economies.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on the same occasion, Premier Su Tseng-chang said the
central government has always given equal attention to
development in different regions, including the outlying islands.
</P>
<P>
For instance, he said, the Kinmen and Matsu islands have opened
direct shipping services with two ports in China's Fujian
Province, injecting significant momentum to local economic
development.
