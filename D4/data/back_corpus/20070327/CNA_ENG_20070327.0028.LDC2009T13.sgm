Taipei,  March 27 (CNA) 03/27/07  19:38:08 (By Luis Huang)

National Council on Physical Fitness and Sports (NCPFS) Chairman
Yang Chung-ho said Tuesday that at present it is impossible to
use the term "Taiwan" as the designation of the nation's sporting
delegations taking part in international events.
</P>
<P>
Yang  made  the  remarks  while  fielding  questions  from
Legislator-at-large Huang  Chih-hsiung  of the main opposition
Kuomintang during a question session at the Legislative Yuan,
during which he questioned the government's motivation to push
for a national campaign aimed at name rectification.
</P>
<P>
Huang, who won a silver medal in the men's taekwondo event in the
2004 Athens Olympic Games, said he also looks forward to Taiwan's
independence, but asked whether or not the nation's athletes will
be deprived of their qualifications to participate in
international events because of the issue.
</P>
<P>
He further asked Yang whether it is viable for Taiwan's athletes
to take part in the 2008 Beijing Olympic Games using "Taiwan" as
the official name of the nation's sport delegation.
</P>
<P>
In response, Yang said Taiwan used the name "Chinese Taipei" to
sign an agreement on its entry bid with the International Olympic
Committee, so the nation's sports teams or athletes are required
to compete in international events under the name "Chinese
Taipei" rather than "Taiwan."
</P>
<P>
For his part, Premier Su Tseng-chang, who was also present at the
question session, said that the government will protect the
nation's interests  in the international  arena  while  promoting
the name-rectification campaign.
</P>
<P>
The name-change movement is by no means an issue of ideology but
aims at promoting the brand name of "Taiwan", Su stressed, adding
that the government will do its utmost to safeguard Taiwan's
sovereignty, but the nation should abide by relevant
international regulations while take part in international
activities.
