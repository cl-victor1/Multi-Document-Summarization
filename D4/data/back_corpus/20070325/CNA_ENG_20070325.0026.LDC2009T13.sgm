Hong Kong is unfriendly toward Taiwan which has negatively impact
on bilateral ties, the Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) said Sunday
amid a dispute over Hong Kong's denial of entry to a MAC
official.
</P>
<P>
In the press release, the MAC rebutted an Hong Kong official's
claims that Hong Kong denied MAC commissioner Chang Chih-yu entry
because his working visa expired last July.
</P>
<P>
The MAC said that Chang holds a multiple-entry visa valid until
May despite his Hong Kong working visa expired last July.
</P>
<P>
Besides, the MAC said Chang had asked Hong Kong immigration
officials about his trip before his departure for Hong Kong March
23 and was given a positive answer although he was cautioned
against engaging in certain activities during his stay.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, the press release said Chang, following an Hong Kong
immigration official's suggestion, had applied for an electronic
visa at the airport on his arrival after being told that his
working visa fell due, however, Chang's application were rejected
by Hong Kong authorities for unknown reasons.
</P>
<P>
The MAC said Chang and another MAC official Huang Chien-liang
were to accompany a Taiwan press corps to Hong Kong to cover the
March 25 election of Hong Kong's chief executive. Huang's
application for visa was turned down only hours before his
scheduled departure and Chang was turned back on his arrival in
Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong authorities' flipflop on the matter has exposed its
unfriendliness toward Taiwan which has negatively impacted
bilateral ties, the MAC said.
