MOST INVESTORS IN TAIWAN UNABLE TO REAP PROFIT: SURVEY
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

Taipei,  March 25 (CNA) 03/25/07  16:58:40 (By Han Nai-kuo)

<P>
A great majority of Taiwan's investors have failed to reap a
profit from their investments despite a good grasp of world
trends, according to results of a opinion poll released Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The survey by the Chinese-language Business Weekly magazine
involved 7,543 subscribers of its online edition between Feb. 15
and March 3.
</P>
<P>
Results of the study show that while 77.3 percent of the
investors are confident of their grasp of world trends, only 2.5
percent made money from each of their investments.
</P>
<P>
Some 50 percent said they have made profit occasionally, but
another 34.2 percent acknowledged they have never made any money
from their investments.
</P>
<P>
More than 94 percent of those interviewed admit that although
they are knowledgeable of world trends, they entered the
investment market at the wrong time, resulting in their failure
to reap a profit.
</P>
<P>
That percentage  included  50 percent  who said they have
occasionally made the wrong decision on the timing to enter the
investment market and 20 percent who indicated that they have
made mistakes  frequently.  Another  3.6 percent said their
choices concerning when to enter the market have been wrong all
along.
</P>
<P>
Analysts at HSBC Investments (Taiwan) Ltd., which sponsored the
survey, said that most investors obtain their knowledge of the
global trends from newspapers, magazines and TV programs. These
trends, they added, include rising new markets, alternative
energy sources and world population aging.
</P>
<P>
However, the analysts said that in order to take advantage of the
transient, fast-changing investment opportunities, investors
should let financial market experts handle their investment
portfolios.
