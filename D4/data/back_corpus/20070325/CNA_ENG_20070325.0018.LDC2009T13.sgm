The Bureau of Investigation (BOI) announced Sunday that it had
uncovered a ketamine manufacturing plant and seized 30 kg of
ketamine in the southern county of Pingtung, marking the first
time that such a drug factory has been uncovered by law-enforcing
authorities in Taiwan.

With the help of a sniffer dog, bureau investigators stationed in
southern Taiwan successfully spotted the factory inside a private
house in the wee hours of Sunday morning and arrested three
suspects, identified as Wang Cheng-yu, Wang Chih-hsiung and Cheng
Sheng-yuan, a BOI official said.

The official said while cracking down on the plant,  the
investigators witnessed the suspects producing drugs.

According to the official, the 30 kg of ketamine, which has a
street value of more than NT$10 million, can be made into at
least one million ecstasy pills.

Ketamine is a non-barbiturate narcotic. As it costs far less than
heroin or amphetamine, it has become the favorites of drug
traffickers.
