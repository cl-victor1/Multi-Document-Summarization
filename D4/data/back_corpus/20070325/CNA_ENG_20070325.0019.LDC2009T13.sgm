President Chen Shui-bian lauded recipients of the National Youth
Public Service Award Sunday for their unselfish services and
devotion to society, saying that their endeavors constitute a
"sustainable strength" propelling Taiwan's development and
progress.
</P>
<P>
Chen said contrary to the popular myth that charity or public
interest services are specially reserved for wealthy people with
much time to spare, those young men and women cited were not
necessarily from wealthy families -- some have experienced
financial difficulties and others are physically-challenged.
</P>
<P>
Driven by their compassion and perseverance, these National Youth
Public Service Award recipients have infused new blood and
vitality into Taiwan society, making them models of the
"Taiwanese Spirit," Chen said.
</P>
<P>
The president made the remarks in a speech delivered at the 2007
National Youth Public Service Award presentation ceremony, where
14 individuals and groups were cited and conferred with the
awards for their contributions to public interests.
</P>
<P>
A total of 315 individuals and groups were recommended for the
National Youth Public Service Award this year.  After careful
examination and evaluation, judges from the Cabinet-level
National Youth Commission selected 52 people and groups to enter
the finals and out of the 52, selected 14 that were particularly
outstanding others to be given the prestigious award.
</P>
<P>
The 14 individuals and groups were recognized for outstanding
performances in five areas: voluntary service, community action,
running non-profit organizations, international representation
and deliberative democracy, according to commission officials.
