Taoyuan County is cooperating with a private design company to
market a series of souvenirs featuring late President Chiang Kai-
shek with an eye to wooing Chinese tourists who are expected to
descend on Taiwan in flocks during the May 1 holiday, an tourism
official from the Taoyuan County said Sunday.

<P>
Bucking  the political  trend  prompted  by the Democratic
Progressive Party administration to get rid of anything related
to Chiang Kai-shek, Taoyuan County, which houses Chiang's
mausoleum, is trying to persuade Chinese tourists to dig into
their pockets with lovable souvenirs designed by a private
company ran by Chiang You-poh, a grandson of Chiang Kai-shek.
</P>
<P>
The presentation of the souvenirs,  including watches, and
fountain pens, is set for the end of the month.
</P>
<P>
In addition, a limited number of memorial liquors, stored in
bottles bearing Chiang's image, will also be available before
May, said the official.
</P>
<P>
The souvenirs will be sold at a heritage park set up by the
county outside Chiang Kai-shek's mausoleum in Tahsi and Chiang's
Chiaopanshan villa, which are must sees for Chinese tourists,
said the official.
