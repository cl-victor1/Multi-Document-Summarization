<P>
In view of a slump in hog prices, the National Animal Industry
Foundation held an event to promote pork consumption Sunday in
Kaohsiung County, inviting the public to sample pork delicacies.
</P>
<P>
The foundation has organized 10 promotional events to be staged
around the country, the first of which was held in the southern
county with the participation of several central and local
government officials.
</P>
<P>
During the event, the foundation chairman Huang Chin-rong and a
Council of Agriculture official, Lee Chin-chun, called on
consumers to purchase pork products carrying the CAS label at
meats products markets.
</P>
<P>
Some 1,000 people, who were divided into 30 teams, joined forces
to prepare a wide range of pork recipes, including baked sausages
and meats, salted pork, smoked bacon and roasted suckling pig,
had a good time at the event.
</P>
<P>
At present, the annual average hog trading price is between
NT$4,300-NT$4,500 per 100 kilograms, much lower than last year's
NT$5,000 per 100 kilograms, and lower than the cost of
production, which is NT$4,800-NT$5,000 per 100 kilograms.
