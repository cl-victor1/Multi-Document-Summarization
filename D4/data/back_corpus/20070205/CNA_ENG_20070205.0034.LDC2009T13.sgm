Taitung, Feb. 5 (CNA) 02/05/07  18:21:30 (By T.C. Jiang)
</P>
<P>
Members of the indigenous community called Sunday for more
attention to be paid to the memory of Yang Chuan-kwang, Taiwan's
legendary decathlete, also known as the "Iron man of Asia," who
died of a stroke in California recently.
</P>
<P>
The remark came after Yang's funeral in the United States, where
his wife and children insisted that he be buried. A memorial
service was also held simultaneously at his hometown in Taitung
County, eastern Taiwan, which few people attended.
</P>
<P>
Aboriginal Legislator Liao Kuo-tung of the opposition Kuomintang
(KMT), who assisted Yang's family in organizing Sunday's memorial
service in Taitung, said he hoped the government and the media
will attach greater importance to the "Iron man of Asia."
</P>
<P>
He lamented that since Yang's death, the media has focused a
great deal of attention on Hsu Wei-lun, a 28-year-old actress who
died on the same day as Yang following a serious car crash.
</P>
<P>
Liao said the government will hold another memorial service for
Taiwan's first Olympic silver medal winner in Taipei Feb. 9 and
added that the National Council on Physical Fitness and Sports
and the Council of Indigenous Peoples will also organize yet
another one in the county.
</P>
<P>
Lin Ching-long, a student of Yang's and a member of Taiwan's
national pole vaulting team, said Yang made an irreplaceable
contribution toward raising Taiwan's international profile but
did not receive much attention from the media.
</P>
<P>
Yang, a member of the Ami tribe born in 1933, won a gold medal in
the decathalon at the 1954 Asian Games in Manila and in 1960,
took silver at the Rome Olympics.
