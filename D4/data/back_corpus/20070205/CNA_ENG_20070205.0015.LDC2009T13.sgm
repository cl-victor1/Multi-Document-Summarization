NAURUAN PRESIDENT ON PRIVATE VISIT IN TAIWAN: MOFA
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  Feb.  5 (CNA) 02/05/07  15:04:00 (By Y.F. Low)

<P>
Nauruan President Ludwig Scotty's current visit in Taiwan is
mostly private in nature, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA)
said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Releasing a news statement concerning Scotty's visit the same day
that he met with President Chen Shui-bian, the MOFA said Scotty
arrived in Taiwan Saturday for a five-day visit.
</P>
<P>
Although Scotty's trip is mainly for private purposes, his
itinerary includes meeting with President Chen, signing a
memorandum of understanding on cooperation in labor affairs with
Council of Labor Affairs Chairman Lee Ying- yuan, and inspecting
the preparation work for the establishment of a Nauruan embassy
in Taiwan, the MOFA said.
</P>
<P>
Nauru, which switched diplomatic recognition to Beijing in July
2002, re- established formal diplomatic relations with Taiwan on
May 14, 2005 after Scotty was elected president of the South
Pacific nation.
</P>
<P>
Scotty made an official visit to Taiwan in March 2006 and made a
private stopover visit in Taiwan between late August and early
September the same year on his way to Palau for the first
leadership summit between Taiwan and its Pacific allies.
</P>
<P>
The stopover visit, which was not disclosed until Scotty had
left, sparked rumors that he engaged in some kind of "diplomatic
extortion" of Taiwan during the visit.
</P>
<P>
According to MOFA spokesman Wang Chien-yeh, the ministry usually
does not release information concerning transit stops or private
visits by heads of state or government officials of its
diplomatic allies.
</P>
<P>
However, to avoid unnecessary speculation by the media this time,
the ministry is releasing some information about Scotty's private
visit after obtaining his permission, Wang said.
