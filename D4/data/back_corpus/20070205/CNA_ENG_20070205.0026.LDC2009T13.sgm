The U.S. government expects a productive partnership with Taiwan
on issues concerning intellectual property rights (IPR)
protection, the director of the American Institute in Taiwan's
(AIT's) Taipei office said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Stephen M. Young made the remarks in an address to the opening of
an IPR protection workshop, a two-day event organized by National
Chengchi University's Graduate Institute of Intellectual
Property, the Licensing Executive Society.
</P>
<P>
In addition to Young,  several U.S. Department of Justice
officials and judges from Thailand, as well as Minister of
Justice Shih Mao-lin and professionals from Taiwan's judicial
sector also took part in the workshop titled "Meeting the
Challenges of IPR Protection in Taiwan and Beyond."
</P>
<P>
Young praised Taiwan for its efforts to establish a new IP court
and expressed hope that judges and prosecutors in the district
courts will have the resources and training they need to deal
with IPR-related cases.
</P>
<P>
He also said the U.S. welcomes Taiwan's efforts that see the
Legislative Yuan in the process of reviewing legislation to
regulate peer-to-peer file sharing, and a plan to put forth
legislation on Internet Service Provider (ISP) liability.
</P>
<P>
Young said Taiwan's economic future depends on IPR, explaining
that as Taiwan's economy continues to evolve into "one of the
most technologically advanced in the world, " strong IPR
protection and enforcement means more choices for consumers, more
opportunities for Taiwan businesses, and more jobs for Taiwan's
workforce.
</P>
<P>
The workshop is supported by the U.S. Department of Justice/U.S.
Overseas Prosecutorial Development, Assistance and Training, as
well as Taiwan's Judicial Yuan,  the Ministry  of Justice and the
Intellectual Property Office under the Ministry of Economic
Affairs, according to an AIT press release.
