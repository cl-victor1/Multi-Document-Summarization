New York,  Feb. 27 (CNA) 02/27/07  17:49:48 (By Lillian Lin and

A former government information officer has established a prize
worth US$30,000 annually for individuals whose actions promote
freedom of speech.
</P>
<P>
74-year-old Chang Chao-ying said he and his family set up the
"Freedom of Speech Prize" in order to improve Taiwanese people's
understanding of this democratic value.
</P>
<P>
Chang, now living in New York, said the prize money, and an
equivalent amount for administration expenditures, have been
donated by his American son-in-law Brian Scanlan, a computer
software businessman.
</P>
<P>
The Washington-based, Taiwanese group Formosan Association for
Public Affairs (FAPA) is cooperating in selecting the prize
winner and organizing the awards ceremony, which will be held in
Taipei Mar. 4. at FAPA's 25th anniversary event. Scanlan will
present to award the prize as Chang, who is receiving
chemotherapy for cancer, will not be able to attend.
</P>
<P>
Chang was an information officer for Taiwan's government in New
York between 1967 and 1980, in Tokyo from 1980-1985, and again
from 1994-1998. Among his legendary achievements was his
acquiring of intelligence shortly before the Carter
Administration of the United State announced that it would cut
diplomatic relations with Taiwan in December 1978.
</P>
<P>
Brought up in a millionaire family in Taipei at the turn of
Japanese colonization and Kuomintang rule, Chang benefited from
broad international experiences that his contemporaries rarely
enjoyed, which were featured in his 2006 prize-winning and best-
selling dictated autobiography "90-banchi, Miyamae- cho".
</P>
<P>
Chang said his concerns for Taiwan go beyond party lines.
"Taiwanese people have the right to decide their own future, " he
said, "while people may be different in their preference for
unification or independence, everybody's freedom of speech should
be respected."
