The Southern Taiwan Science Park registered business turnover of
NT$451.6 billion (US$13.68 billion) for 2006, up 28 percent over
the year-earlier figure, the park's director-general, Chen Chun-
wei, said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Chen said that the original target for 2006 was NT$500 billion
but that the park failed to attain the goal due to market and
price factors, although it still recorded robust growth of around
NT$100 billion over the previous year's level.
</P>
<P>
Looking ahead, Chen said that the park has set the goal of NT$520
billion in business turnover and of 52,000 employees for 2007.
The park employed 47,371 workers in 2006.
</P>
<P>
He said that if the market continues to grow steadily, the park's
turnover will be even higher in the coming years.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that the park's annual business turnover
will reach NT$1 trillion by 2011, led by the booming
optoelectronics, semiconductor, precision machinery and
biotechnology sectors.
</P>
<P>
He said the park had approved 198 manufacturers to invest in the
park as of the end of 2006, among which 93 have started mass
production. The optoelectronics and integrated circuit sectors
are the two dominant sectors in the park, he added.
