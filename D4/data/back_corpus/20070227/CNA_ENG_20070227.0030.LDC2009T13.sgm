Taipei,  Feb. 27 (CNA) 02/27/07  20:11:46 (By Flor Wang)

A group of ruling party lawmakers proposed Tuesday a law revision
which would ban citizens under indictment from pursuing
presidential election, a move inexplicitly aimed at former main
Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Ma Ying-jeou, who is widely viewed as a
strong contender in the 2008 presidential election.
</P>
<P>
Democratic Progressive Party lawmakers Cheng Kuo-chung, Chiu
Chuang-chin and Chen Ching-teh unveiled the idea and called for
widespread legislative support for their proposed amendment in a
Legislative Yuan news conference.
</P>
<P>
According to Chen, it is unbelievable that Ma will pursue the
presidency  after he was indicted  in mid-February  by Taipei
prosecutors on corruption charges over alleged misuse of a
special municipal fund earmarked for his discretionary use when
he served as mayor of Taipei from 1998-2006.

The Presidential and Vice Presidential Election and Recall Law
currently forbids those who have been given a death sentence, a
term of life-long imprisonment, or a jail term of more than 10
years from registering to run in a presidential race.
</P>
<P>
If Ma still wanted to pursue the presidency, Chen argued, the
country may have to choose a president again if Ma were given a
sentence of over 10 years after he was elected.
</P>
<P>
The proposed amendment would ban indicted aspirants, even if not
yet convicted in their first trial, from registering to run in
presidential polls, Chen said, urging lawmakers from different
parties to back the initiative and have the proposal be included
on the agenda for the procedural committee.
</P>
<P>
If the revision were made law, it would be a milestone in the
government's efforts to promote clean politics, Chen said.
</P>
<P>
Now, with presidential hopefuls subject to the strictest public
scrutiny, it is necessary to push through the proposed amendment
to the law and bolster public confidence, Cheng said.
</P>
<P>
Echoing Cheng's view, Chiu said that such a revision would
reflect the people's high expectations for political integrity.
