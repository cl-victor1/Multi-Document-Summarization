Taipei,  Feb.  27 (CNA) 02/27/07  16:50:44 (By Deborah Kuo)

Digital student identification cards are being made available to
some 374,000 high school, junior high and elementary school
students around Taipei City and will be ready for use beginning
March 1, the Taipei City Department of Education reported
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The digital student IDs -- modified from the Easy Cards that are
sold by the Taipei Rapid Transit Corp. -- can be used by the
students as electronic tickets for Taipei metro systems and city
buses, library cards, and as ordinary student IDs. They will
carry their owners' names, student numbers and photos, said Han
Chang-tze, director of the Education Department's computer
office.
</P>
<P>
Nearly all of Taipei City's high schools, junior high schools and
elementary schools have been requested  to install electronic
card-reading machines to facilitate use of the digital student
IDs.
</P>
<P>
Beginning April 1, Han said, the school will notify the student's
parents or legal guardians by text message free of charge should
the student not report to school during the day.
</P>
<P>
However, parents or legal guardians should pay a charge if they
want to be notified on regular basis when their children arrive
and leave school, according to Han.
</P>
<P>
There are still 25,000 students from 25 schools that are yet to
have their traditional student cards upgraded to digital student
IDs, Han added.
