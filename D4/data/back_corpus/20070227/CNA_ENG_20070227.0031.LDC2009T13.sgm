Taiwan created an economic growth rate of 4.62 percent in 2006,
while the growth of commodity prices was controlled at a moderate
scale of 0.6 percent, according to statistics released Tuesday by
the Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics
(DGBAS).

<P>
The tallies also show that average monthly earnings amounted to
NT$44,107 (US$1,335) in 2006, representing a growth of 1.13
percent from the previous year.
</P>
<P>
Because the salary growth was not offset by the growth of
commodity prices, real earnings recorded a year-on-year growth of
0.64 percent last year, a new high for the past five years, DGBAS
officials said.
