Minister of Finance Ho Chih-chin has been recuperating well since
undergoing surgery last week to have a cancerous kidney removed,
a National Taiwan University Hospital (NTUH) source said Tuesday.

Ho is expected to be released from hospital March 2, said Yu
Hung-cheng, director of NTUH's Department of Urology.

According to Yu, Ho's doctors found a tiny malignant tumor on his
left kidney during a routine health check-up before the Lunar New
Year holiday. At the doctors' advice, Ho underwent surgery during
the holiday to have the kidney removed.

Yu said Ho will be asked to return to the hospital for post-
surgery follow-up examinations.

Ho has also been advised to adhere to a healthy, balanced diet,
featuring less intake of salt, fat and high protein, after he
returns home for rehabilitation, Yu said.
