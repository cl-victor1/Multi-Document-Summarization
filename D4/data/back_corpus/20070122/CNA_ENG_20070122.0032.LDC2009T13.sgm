Taipei,  Jan.  22  (CNA) 01/22/07  19:19:30 (By Elizabeth Hsu)

<P>
A women's affairs organization urged police, judicial and social
welfare authorities Monday to review and upgrade their facilities
and measures for the protection of women's safety, while
expressing concern over the seriousness of sexual assaults.
</P>
<P>
The non-profit Modern Women's Foundation held a press conference
to reveal the concerns on the 10th anniversary of the
promulgation of the Sexual Assault Prevention Law, which took
effect in January 1997.
</P>
<P>
Despite the law's existence, Kao Chung-yi, known as the "wolf
hunting for betel nut girls, " committed 11 crimes of sexual
assault in the past seven years before being nabbed recently by
police in Pingtung, southern Taiwan, said foundation chief
executive Chang Chin-li, who also warned that there are still
several serial sex attackers "running at will between
communities."
</P>
<P>
Expressing the public's fear,  Chang suggested that police
reinforce their alert system, which is supposed to be activated
right after a crime is reported, in an effort to raise the alarm.
</P>
<P>
The foundation also urged law-enforcement units to upgrade the
database management system on sexual assaults and to organize
task forces to crack down on such crime.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics of the Sexual Violation Prevention
Committee under the Ministry of the Interior, the number of
sexual assault cases reported to police around the country
totalled 6,601 in 2006, meaning that on average there were at
least 18.8 cases per day.
</P>
<P>
The foundation said most victims of sexual assault are unwilling
to come forward and the true number of cases is seven to 10 times
higher than the number reported.
