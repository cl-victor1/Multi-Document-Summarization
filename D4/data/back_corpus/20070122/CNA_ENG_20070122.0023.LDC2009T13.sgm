The Ministry of Education (MOE) released Monday a set of travel
guides for students wishing to go on study tours around the
country in an effort to encourage local young people to see and
feel the natural, historical and cultural beauty of Taiwan.

The four-volume set of books, titled "Inland Study Tour: 100
Discover Formosa Roads, " was released at a national meeting of
directors of educational affairs in local governments, which
opened earlier in Nantou County, central Taiwan.

Vice Minister of Education Wu Tsai-shun said the tour covers all
25 counties and cities around Taiwan, as well as all its outlying
islands.  They were designed as referenced  for culture-  and
knowledge-oriented field trips by schools and families.

Wu said he expects local students to "use the natural environment
as their classroom " to learn about the country's wildlife and
ecology, folk customs and local industries.
