ACCOUNTANT DETAINED OVER REBAR SCANDAL

Taipei,  Jan.  22 (CNA) 01/22/07  17:36:24 (By Y.C. Jou)
</P>
<P>
The Taipei District Court ruled in the early hours Monday that
one accountant involved in the Rebar Asia Pacific Group scam be
held incommunicado and that another be released on bail of NT$5
million.
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors said Shan Shih-ta -- who was detained -- and Hao Li-
li had dishonestly certified financial statements of China Rebar
Co. and Chia Hsin Food and Synthetic Fiber Co. Insolvency
petitions by the two Rebar subsidiaries triggered a Jan. 5 run on
the Chinese Bank, another Rebar affiliate.
</P>
<P>
The two companies suffered losses totaling NT$25.3 billion over
the past seven years, with the debt ratio of both companies
climbing over 85 percent by last September, and acquired no
extensions from creditor banks. However, according to the
prosecution, Shan and Hao failed to state the situation in their
auditing opinion or produce proper auditing reports.
</P>
<P>
Investigators  searched the two accountants' homes and the
accountancy firm where they work Jan. 20 after finding that they
had moved related documents, including financial statements, in
an attempt to conceal or destroy evidence, the prosecutors said.
</P>
<P>
The investigators said Shan and Hao may have also certified other
affiliates of the Rebar Group and that further probing is needed
to clarify  whether there are any irregularities  in other Rebar
companies' financial reports.
</P>
<P>
Three suspects have now been detained in relation to the Rebar
case, while Rebar Group founder Wang You-theng and his wife Wang
Chin Shih-ying, are wanted, having fled the country.
