A Japanese company has decided to channel some 20 billion yen
(US$164 million) into Taiwan to establish a mask/reticle
manufacturing plant for the semiconductor industry, Japan's Nihon
Keizai Shimbun newspaper reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
Dai Nippon Printing Co. (DNP) , the second-largest photomask
manufacturer in Japan, is planning to build the plant in the
Hsinchu Science Park in northern Taiwan, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Construction of the plant, which will occupy an area of 10,000
square feet, is scheduled to begin this April and commercial
operations are expected to begin in May next year.
</P>
<P>
Business turnover of the plant is expected to top 5 billion yen
by March 2009, increasing to 12 billion yen by the end of the
first quarter of 2010, according to the report.

<P>
Mask/reticle is an important technology used by the semiconductor
industry. An ordinary silicon chip needs eight layers of
reticles, while DRAM chips require 20-30 layers of reticles.
</P>
<P>
DNP, whose design, development and production of reticles and
photomasks have contributed about 20 percent of the world's
photomask market, worth roughly 300 billion yen per year,
according to the report.
