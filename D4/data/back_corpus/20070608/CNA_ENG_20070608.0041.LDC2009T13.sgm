Taipei,  June 8 (CNA) 06/08/07  22:52:45 (By Lilian Wu)

The Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) said Friday that a Chinese
official's remarks that Hong Kong's high degree of autonomy has
come from the authorization of the central government indicates a
"regression of Hong Kong democracy."
</P>
<P>
MAC spokesman Liu Teh-shun was referring to remarks by Wu
Bangguo, chairman of the Standing Committee of the National
People's Congress in a seminar on Hong Kong Basic Law in Beijing
Wednesday during which he said that "the high degree of Hong Kong
autonomy comes from the authorization of the central government"
and is not "inherent."
</P>
<P>
How much power the special administrative region of Hong Kong
gets is solely dependent on how much power the central government
allows it, Wu pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Liu said that since the return of the former British colony to
Chinese rule in 1997, the authoritarian nature of the Chinese
regime and what he described as the democratic system in Hong
Kong have run contradictory courses.
</P>
<P>
Even though China proposed that "Hong Kong people rule Hong Kong
and have a high degree of autonomy, " the contradiction of "one
country, two systems" is all too apparent, and the conflicts have
deepened, according to Liu.
</P>
<P>
He noted that it has been a decade since Hong Kong reverted to
China, but said that "the 10 years have passed in vain in terms
of democracy, " adding that what democracy Hong Kong might have
had has regressed.
</P>
<P>
He said the international community, including Taiwan, is willing
to offer Hong Kong assistance, but added that the voice of the
Hong Kong people for freedom has become weaker.
</P>
<P>
"We worry that Hong Kong residents have become accustomed to the
situation after 10 years," he said.
</P>
<P>
He expressed hope that the Hong Kong people will fight for
democracy and their rights, saying that "their task has yet to be
completed and they have ample room for further efforts."
