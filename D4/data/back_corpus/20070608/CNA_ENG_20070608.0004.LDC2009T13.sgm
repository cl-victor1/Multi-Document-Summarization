Taipei,  June  8  (CNA) 06/08/07  13:28:14 (By Deborah Kuo)

Taiwan will not at present consider establishing any other
liaison office in Costa Rica now that the two countries have
severed formal diplomatic relations, Deputy Foreign Minister
Chang Hsiao-yue said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a question and answer session at the Legislative
Yuan, Chang said Taiwan announced Thursday that it was severing
formal diplomatic  relations with Costa Rica and ceasing all
cooperation projects between the two countries immediately after
the Costa Rican government's "extremely unfriendly" move of
switching diplomatic recognition to Beijing earlier the same day.
</P>
<P>
Despite the diplomatic fiasco, Chang said, the day-to-day lives
of Taiwan expatriates in Costa Rica, including Taiwan students
studying there, will not be affected.

Answering a question raised by opposition Taiwan Solidarity Union
Legislator Kuo Lin-yung on whether the Foreign Ministry will
continue to strive to maintain certain number of countries
maintaining formal diplomatic relations with its allies following
Costa Rica's decision to sever ties "simply for money, " Chang
said the ministry will not engage in a "dollar diplomacy" battle
with China.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Chang said, in addition to continuing to work to
safeguard Taiwan's formal relations with its diplomatic allies,
the Foreign Ministry will also strive to deepen ties with the
United States, Japan and other countries with which Taiwan does
not maintain formal diplomatic relations.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Foreign Affairs James Huang accused Costa Rica the
day before of repeatedly "cheating" Taiwan in the process of its
forging diplomatic relations with China. Huang said it is ironic
that Costa Rican President Oscar Arias, who is a Nobel Peace
Prize winner, chose to switch diplomatic recognition to Beijing
simply because of China's promise to offer "better financial
help."
