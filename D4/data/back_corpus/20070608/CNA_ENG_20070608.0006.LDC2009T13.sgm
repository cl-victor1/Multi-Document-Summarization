Washington,   June  7  (CNA) 06/08/07  13:57:21 (By Michelle
Tsai, Chiehyu Lin and Y.F. Low)
</P>
<P>
Two agricultural and industrial delegations from Taiwan signed
letters of intent with their American counterparts Thursday for
various procurement plans.
</P>
<P>
The signing ceremony took place on Capitol Hill in Washington
D.C., with many members of the U.S. Congress witnessing.
</P>
<P>
The deals concern a plan by the state-owned Taiwan Power Co. to
procure US$100 million worth of nuclear power plant equipment
from Westinghouse Electric Corp. and plans by Taiwan's
agricultural sector to procure a combined US$3.9 billion worth of
soybeans, corn, wheat and beef from the United States.
</P>
<P>
The Taiwanese signatories of the agricultural deals included the
Taiwan Vegetable Oil Manufacturers Association, the Taiwan Feed
Industry Association and the Taiwan Flour Mills Association. The
American signatories were the U.S. Grains Council, the U.S. Wheat
Associates, the American Soybean Association and the U.S. Meat
Export Federation.
</P>
<P>
Sun Ming-hsien, an ambassador-at-large for agricultural affairs
who serves as leader of the agricultural delegation, noted that
Taiwan and the United States not only maintain close agricultural
relations but also share a lot of common values.
</P>
<P>
Sun expressed the hope that the strong agricultural relations
between the two countries will lead eventually to the
establishment of a Taiwan-U.S. free trade agreement (FTA).
</P>
<P>
Bureau of Foreign Trade Director-General Huang Chih-peng, leader
of the industrial delegation, noted that all the members of his
delegation are representatives  of important Taiwan state-owned
enterprises and that they are expected to further procure
products worth a total of US$11.34 billion from the United States
over the next few years.
</P>
<P>
During the current U.S. visit, the state-owned CPC Corp. signed a
memorandum with Honeywell  International  in Houston  for the
procurement of petrochemical processing and control equipment
worth US$1 billion, while Aerospace Industrial Development Corp.
signed various contracts in Los Angeles and New York for the
procurement of aircraft components and chemicals worth a total of
US$28 million.
</P>
<P>
Asked during a news conference held in the U.S. capital Thursday
whether the U.S. visit by the two procurement delegations will be
helpful in paving the way for the establishment of a Taiwan-U.S.
FTA, Taiwan's representative to the United States, Joseph Wu,
said the visit has helped the United States reconfirm Taiwan's
status as an important trade partner.
</P>
<P>
Wu pointed out that during their visits to various U.S. states,
the delegations were received by state governors, members of
state legislatures and members of Congress elected from the
concerned states, which he said shows that the U.S. side attaches
great importance to the country's trade relations with Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Wu admitted that establishing a Taiwan-U.S. FTA involves some
difficulties and that progress isn't expected in the foreseeable
future, adding, however, that this does not mean the goal is
unattainable.
</P>
<P>
According to Wu, U.S. administration officials agree that the
United States is not reluctant to start FTA talks with Taiwan but
that the timing is a problem.
</P>
<P>
Wu said Taiwan should continue to work on getting the message
across to Washington that a Taiwan-U.S. FTA is not only important
to Taiwan but also in the best interests of the United States.
