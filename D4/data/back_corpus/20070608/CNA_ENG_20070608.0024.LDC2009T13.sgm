Taipei,   June  8  (CNA) 06/08/07  19:23:37 (By Maubo Chang)

<P>
Democratic Progressive  Party (DPP) presidential candidate Frank
Hsieh was questioned by prosecutors Friday in connection with
political donations he received between September and December
2002 while serving as the mayor of Kaohsiung City in southern
Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Accompanied by Lee Ying-yuan, manager of his presidential
campaign, Hsieh arrived at the office of the Supreme Prosecutors
Office at 9.55 a.m. and left at 11 a.m.
</P>
<P>
In response to questions from journalists waiting outside the
office, Hsieh said the funds at the center of the investigation
were donated to an organization of his supporters for the use of
his election campaign.
</P>
<P>
All those funds have been retained in a special bank account
since being received and have neither been spent nor transferred
to his personal account, which corroborates his claims that this
funds were not given in return for any specific favor, Hsieh
said.
</P>
<P>
As the DPP's standard bearer in the upcoming 2008 presidential
election, Hsieh said he is willing to subject his integrity to
the public scrutiny, and promised to cooperate with the
investigators.
</P>
<P>
However, Hsieh took issue with some media outlets which have
urged the prosecution not to drag feet on their probe of Hsieh in
light of the fact that former Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Ma Ying-
jeou who is set to run on the KMT's party ticket in the 2008
presidential elections has been indicted for alleged lining his
pocket with public funds.
</P>
<P>
He urged his critics to come up with convincing evidence when
they file complaints with prosecutors against him in order to
spare prosecutors the trouble of searching evidence.
</P>
<P>
Hsieh reportedly sought political donations from businessmen who
had been awarded with contracts by the Kaohsiung City government
while he served as the city's mayor.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile an aide to Hsieh cried foul that some media outlets
have been urging prosecutors to accelerate their probe into the
case, and that the prosecutor's office leaked its decision to
question Hsieh on Friday to the media.
</P>
<P>
Chao Tien-lin, a spokesman at Hsieh's campaign headquarters, said
the leak is obviously an attempt to dampen Hsieh' election
campaign and that Hsieh is mulling whether to retain a group of
lawyers to defend his interests in the lead up to the
presidential elections.
