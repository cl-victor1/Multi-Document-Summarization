Five Japanese who worked for the Taiwan Railway Administration
(TRA) during Japanese colonial rule of Taiwan attended a ceremony
Friday to celebrate the TRA's 120th founding anniversary.

Premier Chang Chun-hsiung presented awards to TRA employees who
have worked for 50 years or more at the ceremony.

Hikoichi Takahashi, one of the five Japanese former workers, said
he came to Taiwan in 1939 to work for the TRA and returned to
Japan before the end of World War II.

<P>
After the war, he often revisited Taiwan, Takahashi said, adding
that he has witnessed the progress Taiwan has made over the years
from post-war recession to today's prosperity.

The TRA workers have made a major contribution to the country's
prosperity, he noted.

The Minister of Transportation and Communication Tsai Duei, for
his part, said the opening of Taiwan's high speed railway this
year has impacted the TRA's longer routes.

Overall,  however, services have not decreased, Tsai said,
although he still urged the TRA to complete its transformation
soon to meet the needs of passengers.
