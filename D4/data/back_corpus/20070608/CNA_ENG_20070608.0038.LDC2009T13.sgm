PROBE WILL NOT ERODE CHANCES OF PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: DPP HEAD
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
San Francisco,  June 7 (CNA) 06/08/07  21:59:25 (By Josie Chou
and Flor Wang)
</P>
<P>
Yu Shyi-kun, visiting chairman of Taiwan's ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) ,  predicted Thursday that a prosecutor's
probe into the party's 2008 presidential candidate will not erode
his chances of election victory.
</P>
<P>
Yu made the comments in San Francisco -- the first leg of a swing
through  the United States to solicit support  from Taiwanese
expatriates for the DPP in the presidential race.
</P>
<P>
Yu said he strongly believes in Frank Hsieh's innocence and
called for unity to ensure a DPP victory in the election. Hsieh
served as premier from 2005 to early 2006 and won the party's May
6 presidential primary.
</P>
<P>
"I strongly believe that Hsieh's reputation will also be cleared
this time around, just like several similar cases in the past, "
Yu said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Hsieh was questioned by prosecutors in Taipei over his
alleged role in a case in connection to political donations he
received while serving as mayor of Kaohsiung from 1998-2005.
</P>
<P>
Hsieh was questioned by prosecutors of a special investigation
unit under the Supreme Prosecutors Office for the first time over
monetary donations remitted to his special election bank account
during the September-December period of 2002.
</P>
<P>
Speaking after a one-hour probe, Hsieh maintained his innocence
and said that he is willing to be subject to the highest
standards of scrutiny  and that the political  donations  he
received when campaigning for Kaohsiung mayor have so far not
been used. He also denied allegations of having received bribes
during his nearly two full terms as mayor from 1998-2005.
</P>
<P>
Hsieh also expressed dissatisfaction with certain media outlets,
which he accused of having urged the prosecution to charge him
after Ma Ying-jeou,  the main  opposition  Kuomintang's
presidential candidate, was indicted in February on embezzlement
charges.
</P>
<P>
Ma was charged by Taipei prosecutors in a case related to his
alleged mishandling  of a special municipal  monthly allowance
designated for his discretionary use when he served as mayor of
Taipei from 1998-2006.
