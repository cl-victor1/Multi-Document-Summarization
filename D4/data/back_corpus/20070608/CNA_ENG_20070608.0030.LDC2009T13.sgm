safe and comfortable  lodging,  ROCCOC Director-general Chang

Taiwan's Bed and Breakfast establishments have mushroomed in
recent years. Nearly 10,000 such small lodgings were established,
but only 1,939 were legally registered, of which 1,886 are in
operation, Chang added.

Chang said only legal Bed and Breakfasts will be recognized in
the evaluation system.
