San Jose, Costa Rica, June 8 (CNA) 06/08/07  20:18:06 (By Ramon

Taiwanese expatriates in Costa Rica urged the Republic of China
government Friday to open a representative office here following
the severance of diplomatic ties between the two countries the
day before.
</P>
<P>
Out of a concern that their interests might be affected because
of the termination of the 63-year-old diplomatic partnership
between Taiwan and Costa Rica, Taiwanese nationals in the Central
American state asked the ROC government to set up an economic and
cultural office in San Jose to take charge of consular and
document verification affairs.
</P>
<P>
"Establishing a representative office here will help Taiwanese
people maintain close links and strong affiliation  with the
motherland," said one Taiwan businessman.
</P>
<P>
According to Ku Chung-hsiao, head of a Taiwanese association, the
closure of the ROC Embassy and the departure of the ambassador is
of great concern to them. "We will feel deserted by the
government if it fails to open a representative office here," he
said.

<P>
Currently, there are some 60,000 ethnic Chinese in Costa Rica,
some 4,000 of whom are immigrants from Taiwan and mainly work in
the foreign trade, restaurant, sundry and tourism-related
sectors.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan decided to terminate its diplomatic ties with Costa Rica
Thursday, hours after Costa Rica announced its establishment of
diplomatic links with China.
</P>
<P>
Following the loss of Costa Rica,  Taiwan still maintains
diplomatic relations with 24 countries.
