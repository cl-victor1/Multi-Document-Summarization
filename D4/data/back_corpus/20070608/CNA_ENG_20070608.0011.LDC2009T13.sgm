TAIWAN HAS NO PLAN TO DEVELOP MEDIUM-RANGE MISSILES: ENVOY
</HEADLINE>

Washington,  June 7 (CNA) 06/08/07  14:29:26 (By Chiehyu Lin and
Sofia Wu)

Taiwan doesn't have any plan to develop medium-range missiles or
deploy weapons of mass destruction, the Republic of China
representative to the United States said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Joseph Wu reminded the United States and the
international community that the military balance in the Taiwan
Strait is tilting in favor of China whose intensified military
buildup is threatening regional peace and stability.
</P>
<P>
Noting that China is a menace while Taiwan is a defender, Wu said
the United States and the international community should demand
that China halt its threatening military deployment rather than
impose various restrictions on Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Wu made the remarks during the representative office's routine
monthly news conference.
</P>
<P>
When Taiwan conducted computerized war games as part of its
annual Han Kuang military exercise in late April, then-Defense
Minister Lee Jye mentioned that "Taiwan should use medium-range
missiles."
</P>
<P>
However, the United States reportedly disagreed with Lee's views
and dissuaded Taiwan from launching such a development project.
</P>
<P>
At the news conference, Wu was asked whether the representative
office has received any information from U.S. authorities
concerning the issue. In response, Wu said that he met with
Pentagon officials recently, but neither side brought up the
medium-range missile issue. Nonetheless, Wu said he has come to
know through indirect channels that U.S. officials have indeed
expressed concerns about the reported project.
</P>
<P>
Wu said that to the best of his understanding, Taiwan has no plan
to develop any medium-range missiles or deploy or stockpile
weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
According to Wu, the issue regarding Taiwan's military build-up
should be considered from two angles. First of all, he said,
Taiwan needs to consult with its strategic partners, particularly
the United States, to cope with any possible Taiwan Strait
conflicts.
</P>
<P>
Second, Wu said, the reasons behind Taiwan's mulling of acquiring
some offensive or strategic weapons lies in the fact that China
has deployed various types of missiles along its southeastern
coastline targeting Taiwan and that many of its new naval
weapons, such as new destroyers and submarines, are also targeted
at Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Against this backdrop, Wu said it's unfair to unilaterally
restrict  Taiwan's access to offensive  weaponry systems while
assisting or turning a blind eye to China's menacing military
build-up moves.
</P>
<P>
Wu further cited a recent Pentagon report on China's growing
military strength and sophistication to stress the gravity of
China's military threat to Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
According to the annual Pentagon report, Wu said, China's success
in destroying a satellite in low-Earth orbit early this year
represents a threat to the interests of all space-faring nations.
The Pentagon also said the People's Liberation Army is building a
greater capacity to launch pre-emptive strikes. It cited as
examples China's acquisition of long-endurance submarines,
unmanned combat aircraft and additional precision-guided air-to-
ground missiles. By 2011, China will have aircraft carriers, the
report also said.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan has consistently conveyed similar information to U.S.
authorities over the past several years, Wu said, adding that
hopefully, the United States and the international community will
no longer question Taiwan's strategic thinking about its self-
defense plans and instead ask China to cease moves that pose a
threat to Taiwan.
