presidential candidate Frank Hsieh, will be named as DPP deputy
secretary-general replacing Tsai Huang-liang who has tendered his
resignation, DPP sources said Sunday.

The sources said, Hsu who acts as chief of Hsieh's Southern
Taiwan Office had served as DPP deputy secretary-general during
Hsieh's term as DPP chairman between 2000 and 2002. His new post
at DPP headquarters will provide Hsieh a better grip on the party
apparatus during his presidential campaign.

Tsai who was a four-term lawmaker before being named by DPP
Chairman Yu Shyi-kun as DPP deputy secretary-general in 2006
tendered his resignation last week. He has been listed by DPP as
DPP first choice for lawmaker at large and thereby is almost
certain to resume his role as a lawmaker after Jan. 12
legislative elections, according to the sources.
