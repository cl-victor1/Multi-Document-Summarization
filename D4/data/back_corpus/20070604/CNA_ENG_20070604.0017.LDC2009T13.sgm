The public approval rating for the main opposition Kuomintang's
(KMT) presidential candidate, Ma Ying-jeou, is rising and has far
surpassed that for Frank Hsieh, his ruling Democratic Progressive
Party (DPP) rival, according to poll results released Monday by a
local newspaper.

<P>
After Ma promised to set up direct transport links within one
year upon his election and his recent announcement that he will
not pair up on a presidential ticket with Legislative Yuan
Speaker Wang Jin-pyng after Wang rejected his offer to act as his
running mate, the public approval rating for Ma has recently
surged to 59 percent, from 43 percent in early May, the United
Daily News reported.

<P>
At the same time, Hsieh's public approval rating has dropped to
17 percent from the 28 percent he enjoyed in early May when he
won the DPP's presidential primary, according to the report.

Upon learning of the poll results, Ma said following a seminar
with  40 chairmen and representatives  of China-based  Taiwan
businessmen's associations that he will find out the reasons
behind the change and work out a policy framework on major issues
and select a suitable running mate based upon that foundation.
