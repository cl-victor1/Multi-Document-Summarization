Taipei,  June  4 (CNA) 06/04/07  21:38:22 (By Flor Wang)

The presidential candidate of the main opposition Kuomintang
(KMT) vowed Monday to implement direct charter flight services on
weekends between Taiwan and China should he be elected president
in 2008.
</P>
<P>
Former KMT Chairman Ma Ying-jeou, who was nominated May 2 by the
KMT as its candidate for the 2008 presidential election, made the
pledge after attending a seminar with more than 40 chairmen and
representatives of China-based Taiwan businessmen's associations.
</P>
<P>
As opening direct transportation links across the Taiwan Strait
has become an issue of major concern among a variety of Taiwan
people, Ma said that he will do his best to implement direct
charter flights between the two sides should he win the election
and that he will immediately start two-way talks on establishing
full airlinks across the strait.
</P>
<P>
If the KMT regains power in 2008, Ma said, the party will get rid
of ideological strife and bear down to implement a wholly liberal
economic policy.
</P>
<P>
Under the rule of the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) over the
past seven years, Taiwan's economy has rapidly worsened, taking
the country to the bottom among the four "Asian Little Dragons,"
he claimed.
</P>
<P>
According to Ma, if he is elected president, the KMT will aim to
boost the annual economic growth rate from the current level of 5
percent to 6 percent and raise the per-capita annual income to
US$20,000 by 2011. The KMT harbors an ambition to make the
country a global business operations hub for Taiwan businessmen
and an Asia-Pacific operations center for foreign businessmen, he
said.
