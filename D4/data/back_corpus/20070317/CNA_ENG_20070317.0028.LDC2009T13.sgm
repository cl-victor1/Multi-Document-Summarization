The semi-official Taiwan External Trade Development Council
(TAITRA) is planning a Taiwan electronics show to take place in
Chennai, southern India in September to introduce Taiwan's
electrical and electronic technology to the market that has the
world's second-strongest potential consumption power, behind
China, a TAITRA official said Saturday.

Chan Chia-hui of the TAITRA department of exhibition affairs told
of the plan in an interview with CNA during a visit to New Delhi
to inspect the local marketing environment. He said the rising
Indian middle class offers the best potential for Taiwan-made
electrical and electronic products and suggested that Taiwan
businesses in the sector take the market into account in their
investment projects.

But Chan also advised Taiwanese entrepreneurs to conduct field
investigations into the investment environment there before
making any decisions to invest in the world's seventh-largest
country by geographic area and the second-most populous nation in
the world, pointing out that India has different languages and
cultures, as well as laws and taxation regulations, from Taiwan.

According to TAITRA, the number of Taiwan businesses operating in
the Indian market has increased to nearly 50, including China
Airlines, EVA Airways Corp., China Trust Commercial Bank and
Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company. In recent years,
there have been more and more exchanges between religious,
cultural and arts groups of the two countries, while Taiwan
offers scholarships to some 20 Indian students each year to study
in Taiwan.

Taiwan is currently the 25th-largest trading partner of India,
with mutual trade reaching US$2.4 billion in 2005, marking a
yearly growth of over 20 percent. The amount, however, was only a
small part of Taiwan's foreign trade, TAITRA said, adding that
there is still ample room for the two sides to expand trade.
