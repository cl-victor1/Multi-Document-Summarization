The second of two men who raped a medical school student earlier
this week after abducting her in the Shihlin district of Taipei
City, was arrested Saturday.

<P>
Police nabbed Lin Shih-chie, 38, on Chungchin North Road in
northern Taipei during a morning patrol operation after they saw
him attempting to board a bus bound for southern Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Lin, who has a criminal history of theft and sexual harassment,
was wanted by police not only because of his involvement in the
rape but also on a charge of theft. He is suspected of
masterminding the medical student rape. His accomplice Hung Chie-
hung, 30, was arrested the previous day.

<P>
According to the police report, Lin and Hung met each other often
to "have fun" together since they became acquainted two years ago
at a night market. Since then, they made eight excursions around
Taipei city and county seeking victims.
</P>
<P>
They abducted their latest victim near the Chientan mass rapid
transit station shortly after midnight Sunday, drove her to the
Tachia Riverside Park beside the Keelung River and raped her.
