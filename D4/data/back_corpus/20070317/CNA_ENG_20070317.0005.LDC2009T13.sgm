A 43.46 percent temporary anti-dumping duty on China-made shoes
and boots, announced three days ago, does not apply to sports
shoes, work shoes and slippers, the Ministry of Finance (MOF)
said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The task of identifying whether shoes imported from China belong
to categories on which the duty is levies will be left to customs
official, the MOF said.
</P>
<P>
The measure began Friday and will remain in effect for up to four
months, with future adjustments depending on further
investigations.
</P>
<P>
The MOF said an initial investigation conducted by the Ministry
of Economic Affairs since last year has found evidence indicating
damage to Taiwan's shoe industry caused by the dumping of Chinese
shoes on the domestic market.
