The chiefs of three local governments in southern Taiwan issued a
declaration Saturday calling for joint development in the region.

and Pingtung Magistrate Tsao Chi-hung clinched the agreement at
the end of a two-day meeting held at Liouchiou township in
Pingtung County.

The three local leaders promised to join forces in promoting the
yachting sector and building a "southern ocean park" to take
advantage of the rich maritime resources in southern Taiwan and
in line with the central government's "blue ocean" strategy to
make the ocean biotech industry the center of Taiwan's hi- tech
and sustainable growth business in the 21st Century.

They also expressed willingness to integrate their traffic
network and natural resources and expressed welcome to central
government agencies to relocate to the region.

Backed by central government policy and support, they also vowed
to build the three southern areas into a "golden triangle" that
can take advantage of the surrounding vast ocean.
