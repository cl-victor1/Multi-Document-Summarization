TSU CHAIRMAN REITERATES `CENTER-LEFT' POLICY LINE FOR PARTY
</HEADLINE>

Changhua County, March 16 (CNA) 03/17/07  11:55:31 (By Han Nai-

<P>
The opposition Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU) will transform
itself into a "center-left" political party and become the voice
of the less-privileged and more vulnerable sectors of society,
TSU Chairman Huang Kun-hui said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Addressing TSU party workers at a New Lunar Year gathering in
Changhua County, central Taiwan, Huang said the TSU has presented
its own "four wants and one without" -- in contrast to a similar
package of demands advocated by President Chen Shui-bian.
</P>
<P>
Huang said the TSU's "four wants" is for jobs, well-being,
justice and clean government for the people and that the "one
without" refers to a Taiwan without a government that tells lies
and cheats its people.
</P>
<P>
The TSU chairman also said that Taiwan is already an independent
sovereign country and that there is no question of either
declaring independence or being united with China.
</P>
<P>
The only thing Taiwan needs is "normalization" of its name
through the adoption of a new national constitution, he said.
</P>
<P>
He suggested that the job should not be completed in a hurry but
should instead be achieved gradually, one step at a time.
</P>
<P>
Although the TSU has been the ruling Democratic Progressive
Party's partner in the "pan-green camp," Huang's remarks showed
that the TSU is determined to take a different path from that of
the DPP.
</P>
<P>
In early March, Chen declared his "four wants and one without,"
saying that Taiwan wants independence, a change of the country's
official designation, a new constitution and development.
</P>
<P>
He also said "Taiwan faces no such problems as to leftist or
rightist policy lines and the only problem for Taiwan concerns
national identity and whether to unify with China or secure
Taiwan's formal independence."
