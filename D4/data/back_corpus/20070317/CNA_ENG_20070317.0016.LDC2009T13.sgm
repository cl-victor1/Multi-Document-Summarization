LEGISLATIVE SPEAKER LEAVES FOR THAILAND

Taipei, March 17 (CNA) 03/17/07  17:17:25 (By Lilian Wu)

Legislative Speaker Wang Jin-pyng left for Thailand Saturday for
a three-day private visit.
</P>
<P>
Prior to his departure, Wang said he and former main opposition
Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Ma Ying-jeou have "worked together
closely," when asked about his exchanges with Ma.
</P>
<P>
Ma, who announced his bid to run for the presidency last month
upon being indicted on charges of misusing a special allowance
fund during his two-term Taipei mayorship between 1998 and 2006,
attended a birthday bash Friday thrown by entrepreneurs to
celebrate Wang's 66th birthday.
</P>
<P>
Wang has been reluctant to announce his own bid for the
presidential election, saying only that he will accept mediation
by KMT Honorary Chairman Lien Chan.
</P>
<P>
Lien presided over the first such mediation meeting between Wang
and Ma last month but to no avail, and further mediation efforts
have stalled, while a recent party chairman by-election seems to
have added more uncertainty to the mediation.
</P>
<P>
Shortly after KMT Acting Chairman Wu Poh-hsiung announced his bid
for the by- election, Legislator Hung Hsiu-chu also took the
party by surprise by announcing her bid. Wu vs. Hung is widely
believed to be a battle between the proxies of Ma and Wang.
</P>
<P>
The registration for the KMT primary for presidential deletion
will begin in early April and the coming two weeks are expected
to be a crucial time for mediation between Wang and Ma.
</P>
<P>
Wang's aides said Wang will meet with Taiwan businessmen, visit a
subsidiary of Taiwan's Delta Electronics, Inc. and a Chinese
school in Thailand before returning to Taiwan Monday.
