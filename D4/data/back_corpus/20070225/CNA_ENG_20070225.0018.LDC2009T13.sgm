Beijing Olympics commemorative coins issued by People's Bank of
China have been approved for sale in Taiwan, a trade official
said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Huang Chih-peng, chief of the Foreign Trade Bureau under the
Ministry of Economic Affairs, said his office had given a green
light for sale of the coins in Taiwan without bothering to
consult the opinion of the Mainland Affairs Council, after
deciding that there was no political motives behind the sales.
</P>
<P>
Huang made the remarks after a coin salesman took out ads in
local newspapers touting the coins that day.
</P>
<P>
As commemorative coins are not actual currency, permits for their
sale fall under the authority of the Ministry of Economic Affairs
rather than the country's central bank, a financial official
pointed out.
