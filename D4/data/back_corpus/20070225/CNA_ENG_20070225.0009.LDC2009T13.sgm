State Public Prosecutor-General Chen Tsung-ming said Sunday that
members of a soon-to-be-established special investigation task
force are expected to be finalized in early March, paving the way
for the group to formally become operational in April.
</P>
<P>
Chen, who was nominated by President Chen Shui-bian for the top
prosecutorial post and confirmed in January by votes from 126
legislators, said he has probed the intentions of several dozen
prosecutors who were seeking to be candidates for the special
investigation task force.
</P>
<P>
The operations of the special investigation task force to be
established under the State Public Prosecutor-General's Office
will be mainly based on the operations of the Anti-Corruption
Center under the Taiwan High Prosecutor's Office and Chen touted
it as a "high-efficiency  team" of 40 experts,  including eight
to 10 prosecutors, a number of prosecutorial affairs officers and
a few dozen clerks.
</P>
<P>
Although the new task force will have the authority to deal with
crimes committed by top government officials or their relatives,
it will also include top prosecutors with knowledge and
experience of dealing with financial and economic crimes, as well
as computer and high-technology crimes, Chen added.
