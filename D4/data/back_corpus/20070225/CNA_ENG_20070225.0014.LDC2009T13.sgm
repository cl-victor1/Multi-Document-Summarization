Taipei, Feb.  25 (CNA) 02/25/07  18:58:16 (By Han Nai-kuo)

<P>
More than 50 hotel construction projects have been launched
throughout Taiwan or are being contemplated by various financial
groups in anticipation of a government decision to allow more
Chinese tourists to visit the country.
</P>
<P>
Officials  at the Tourism  Bureau  under the Ministry  of
Communication and Transportation said Sunday that most of the
construction projects are scheduled for completion within three
years, with some hoteliers indicating that they will build a new
hotel at a different location in Taiwan each year.
</P>
<P>
The officials acknowledged that the construction  boom has
triggered worry among some existing hoteliers that three years
from now, Taiwan will be dogged by an oversupply of hotel rooms.
</P>
<P>
They noted that many conglomerates, including the Uni-President
Group, the Shin Kong Group, the Pou Chen Group, the Leofoo Group
and the Ambassador Hotel chain, are planning to launch new hotel
construction projects.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan reached an agreement with China last year to launch
regular direct cross- Taiwan Strait charter passenger flights for
holidays and case-by-case charter passenger and cargo flights,
paving the way for the establishment of regular transport links.
</P>
<P>
The two sides are expected to hold talks on allowing Chinese
tourists to visit Taiwan, as the Cabinet-level Mainland Affairs
Council has indicated that the planned full opening of Taiwan to
Chinese tourists is an established policy of the government.
</P>
<P>
China has also urged Taiwan to respond to its proposal to begin
consultations on the issue.
