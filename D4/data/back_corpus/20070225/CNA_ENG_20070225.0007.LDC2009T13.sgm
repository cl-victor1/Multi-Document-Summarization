Representatives of Taiwanese groups based in Washington urged the
people of Taiwan Saturday to unite to seek transitional justice
and a fair society during an event to commemorate the 60th
anniversary of the 228 Incident.
</P>
<P>
The commemoration was organized by the Taiwanese Presbyterian
Church of Washington in conjunction with the Taipei Economic and
Cultural Representative Office in the U.S. and other Taiwanese
groups in the greater Washington, D.C. area.
</P>
<P>
A series of activities was included in the commemoration,
including a choir performance, a call to worship, keynote
speeches and music performances, as well as a minute's silence
for the victims of the 228 Incident.
</P>
<P>
David Tawei Lee, Taiwan's top representative in the U.S., said
everyone who loves Taiwan should have better knowledge of the
history of the 228 Incident of 1947, saying that people should
learn from history to avoid any repetition of the tragedy.
</P>
<P>
The 228 Incident refers to a series of events in 1947 in which
thousands of people, particularly the intelligentsia, were killed
by troops of the then- ruling Kuomintang which brutally
suppressed a rebellion against the late President Chiang Kai-
shek's iron-fisted rule over Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Professor Sung Chuan-sheng, who was invited to deliver a speech
titled "Taiwanese Self-Help Movement," called on the Taiwanese
people to move forward toward democracy and freedom and forsake
the historical sorrow.
</P>
<P>
He claimed that the key problem in Taiwan is not an ethnic
problem but a problem of national identity and said the people of
Taiwan need to unite to fight for justice in society.
