Taiwan's deputy representative to the United States, John C.C.
Deng, who has recently been appointed as the country's first top
international trade negotiator, is scheduled to return to Taiwan
April 18 to assume his new post.
</P>
<P>
Deng, who has served in the past as director of the Economic
Division of the Taipei Economic and Cultural Representative
Office in the United States, vice chairman of the Mainland
Affairs Council and deputy permanent representative to the World
Trade Organization, is expected to formally assume his new post
as head of the Office of Trade Negotiations under the Ministry of
Economic Affairs -- a position with the rank and title of
ambassador, soon after his return to Taipei.
</P>
<P>
The Office  of Trade  Negotiations,  which  was officially
established March 30, is tasked with dealing with international
trade talks,  including talks on the Trade and Investment
Framework Agreement between Taiwan and the United States and
talks on the signing of free trade agreements (FTAs) with foreign
countries under the framework of the World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
Deng said that his most immediate tasks will be making various
mechanisms  of his office  operational;  sorting  out ways of
coordinating with relevant Cabinet agencies;  accelerating work
associated with FTA talks with the Dominican Republic and pushing
forward work to contribute to making the Doha Round of talks
succeed.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Deng said, he envisages establishing a consultation
and communication mechanism with the business and industrial
sectors with the aim of tapping the ideas and visions of members
of these sectors.
</P>
<P>
In his new post, Deng will head a staff of 25, including two
deputy chief negotiators,  three senior negotiators  and seven
negotiators.
</P>
<P>
In the future, Deng said, he will also be required to give
reports directly to an Executive Yuan international affairs
strategy task force headed by Vice Premier Tsai Ing-wen. The task
force, grouping heads of eight to nine Cabinet agencies, will be
responsible for discussing and shaping Taiwan's positions in all
international talks and negotiations, he added.
