DPP BACKS OPENING OF CAR AND HORSE RACING: PARTY CHAIRMAN
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  April  6 (CNA) 04/06/07  18:45:03 (By Flor Wang)

Responding to a media report that the Cabinet is planning to open
sports car racing and horse racing in central and southern
Taiwan, the ruling party chief said Friday that his party will
back the project as long as it stimulates local economies and
benefits the people.
</P>
<P>
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) Chairman Yu Shyi-kun made the
comments while answering questions from reporters after it was
reported a day earlier that the Executive Yuan is expected to
allow competitive race events to be held in central and southern
Taiwan beginning in June.
</P>
<P>
Chang Ching-sen, vice chairman of the Cabinet-level Council for
Economic Planning and Development, told CNA Thursday that opening
sports car racing and horse racing will be a boon for seven
cities and counties in central and southern regions as well as
the offshore county of Penghu, but particularly the central
Yunlin County.
</P>
<P>
Car racing is likely to be opened first as it requires no
revisions to existing laws, Chang said.
</P>
<P>
Pointing  out that the Executive  Yuan must  first  craft
comprehensive complementary measures to mitigate the impact of
the planned opening measure on public order and social morals, Yu
said that the DPP would certainly support the plan as long as it
is beneficial to society.
</P>
<P>
DPP legislative caucus whip Wang Hsing-nan said the same day that
the party's caucus in the Legislative Yuan is in favor of the
idea, and contended that the measure should be able to help
revitalize local economies and strike a balance in regional
development.
</P>
<P>
He opined that the government should follow the example set by
Hong Kong and Macau by allocating a certain percentage of
earnings to helping minorities and the underprivileged.
</P>
<P>
Kuo Su-chun, a member of the main opposition Kuomintang's
legislative  caucus, criticized  the  DPP government  for its
near-slightness in announcing the car racing and horse racing
opening policy.
</P>
<P>
No wonder that the announcement stirred up public suspicion that
this plan is aimed at soliciting votes for the ruling DPP in
coming elections, as the government as yet lacks a concrete
blueprint, Kuo said.
</P>
<P>
Over the past seven years, she said, the DPP administration has
been incompetent when it comes to bolstering Taiwan's economy
because it lacks an across-the- board stimulation package, but it
now wants to bolster economic development in central and southern
Taiwan by allowing profiteering businesses.
</P>
<P>
The government  has to provide the pubic with a detailed
explanation of its plans to step up law enforcement if the
opening leads to a deterioration in social order, she argued.
</P>
<P>
Lee Hung-chun, spokesman for the opposition People First Party,
questioned why the Executive Yuan unveiled the policy now instead
of working  with opposition lawmakers  to delve further  into a
long-stalled bill aimed at allowing the establishment of casinos
on outlying islands.
</P>
<P>
Lee said that he wonders why the Executive Yuan suddenly agreed
to open sports car racing and horse racing after having long
opposed the proposal to set up casinos on offshore islands due to
national security concerns.
</P>
<P>
The PFP lawmaker suggested the DPP administration not go too far
just to solicit votes in the coming legislative and presidential
elections.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU)  legislative caucus whip Yin Ling-
ying  urged  the government  to  thoroughly  assess  all tourism-
related opening issues, and carefully gauge possible adverse
effects.
</P>
<P>
The government must not focus its attention only on economic
benefits while turning a blind eye to possible negative side
effects, such as the deterioration in public order, she said.
</P>
<P>
Following in others' footsteps does not guarantee success if the
government's planned opening measures lack the vision to
integrate local features and characters, she argued, adding that
such efforts may actually lead to greater problems down the road.
