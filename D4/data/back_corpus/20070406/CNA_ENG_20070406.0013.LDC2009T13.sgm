RELOCATION OF FIVE AGENCIES TO HSINCHUANG A 'MISCONCEPTION':
PREMIER

Premier Su Tseng-chang said Friday that it is a misconception
that five Cabinet agencies, including the Council of Labor
Affairs (CLA) , will be relocated from Taipei City to Hsinchuang
of Taipei County under an Executive Yuan plan.
</P>
<P>
Su said it is still too early to speculate whether the CLA,
Department of Health,  Council for Hakka Affairs,  Council of
Indigenous Peoples and the Public Construction Commission will be
relocated to Hsinchuang, since the administration has just begun
information  collection  and investigations  to look  into the
feasibility of the relocation project.
</P>
<P>
Su noted that Minister of the Interior Lee Yi-yang said recently
in a briefing at the Legislative Yuan that the administration has
been pondering how plots of state-owned land in Taipei County
should be used after being taken back by the government --
remarks that probably have been misconceived as the
administration was planning to have those five Cabinet agencies
relocated to Hsinchuang.

<P>
The premier quoted Lee as saying that some NT$600 million
(US$18.18 million) could be saved in rent if the state-owned land
can be developed to house the five Cabinet agencies, which are
"snails without shells" -- meaning they don't have any offices
that are their own property.
</P>
<P>
Lee reportedly told the legislators last week that a preliminary
plan has been worked out to relocate the five agencies to
Hsinchuang after the plots of land are retrieved.  Lee's remarks
drew a strong protest from Kaohsiung Mayor Chen Chu, who
initiated the idea of relocating the CLA to the southern port
city of Kaohsiung while serving as CLA chairwoman.
</P>
<P>
Expressing her strong opposition to the central government's
relocation proposal, Chen pledged to fight for her cause, saying
that Kaohsiung is the most worthy and suitable city to host the
CLA as it has the largest proportion of laborers of any city in
Taiwan, with 80 percent of its residents being working class.
