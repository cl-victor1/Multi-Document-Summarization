Taiwanese tennis player Lu Yen-hsun, defeated China's Sun Peng in
the first round play-offs of the 2007 Davis Cup Tennis
Tournament, at the National Taiwan University's Sports Center
Friday.

Lu, in high spirits and enjoying the home court advantage, beat
Sun in five sets 3-6, 6-2, 3-6, 6-4, 6-2 to take the first match
of the contest, clenching Taiwan's first victory after losing to
Thailand 3-2 in February in the first round.

The victory came at a heavy price as Lu -- competing with pre-
existing injuries -- saw his condition deteriorate throughout the
day, said Kan Su-yuan, the team's athletic trainer. He added that
Lu will not compete during the rest of matches against China out
of concern that he might further aggravate his injures.

<P>
China and Taiwan will continue their on court battles until April
8 in Taipei, with four more single's matches remaining to
determine the overall winner.
