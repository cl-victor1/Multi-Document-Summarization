Taipei,  April 6 (CNA) 04/06/07  19:16:19 (By Flor Wang)

Premier Su Tseng-chang denied Friday a media report that the
government will soon open sports car racing and horse racing,
saying that there is not even the slightest possibility of this
happening in the near future.
</P>
<P>
Su made the remarks during an inspection of central Yunlin County
after CNA reported a day earlier that the government is planning
to allow sports car racing and horse racing in central and
southern Taiwan, beginning in June.
</P>
<P>
Chang Ching-sen, vice chairman of the Cabinet-level Council for
Economic Planning and Development, was quoted as saying that car
racing is expected to be allowed before horse racing, and that
Yulin County stands a good chance of first benefiting from the
planned opening.
</P>
<P>
Stressing that the reported opening is still very far away from
being realized, Su said that the government has to craft a
comprehensive program and revise laws first.
</P>
<P>
Although Yunlin County is very keen to host car racing or horse
racing events, Su said that the issue must be fully explored on
the legal,  tourism,  animal protection and gambling-related
fronts in advance.
</P>
<P>
In addition, he said, the sentiment of the local residents on the
outlying Penghu County also must be heeded as Penghu has long
sought government permission to set up casinos. ENDITEM/jnc
