LEGISLATIVE SPEAKER WARNS KMT ON ETHNIC, PARTY ASSETS ISSUES
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  April  6 (CNA) 04/06/07  21:02:20 (By Flor Wang)

Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng warned Friday the main
opposition Kuomintang (KMT) on issues related to ethnicity and
its assets, suggesting that the party must iron out response
mechanisms to deal with all possible scenarios.
</P>
<P>
Wang made the comments while answering questions from reporters
in central Changhua County, where he attended a seminar on
preventing domestic violence sponsored by county authorities.
</P>
<P>
According to Wang, the KMT faces three major thorny issues in the
short term and must ready itself for possible consequences
arising from issues of ethnicity, party assets and former KMT
Chairman Ma Ying-jeou's embezzlement trial, as the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) will undoubtedly rehash these
issues to secure victory in the coming legislative and
presidential elections.
</P>
<P>
As the DPP has been promoting a public endorsement campaign on
what it called the KMT's illegally acquired party assets in hopes
of putting the issue to a national referendum to be held along
with the March 2008 presidential election, the KMT must not sit
idle. The party has to properly handle these issue in the face of
the DPP's predictable electioneering, Wang said.
</P>
<P>
Additionally, Wang said, the KMT also must be wary of negative
developments in Ma's trial on corruption charges, and should set
up a fast-response team to deal with issues arising from this
case.
</P>
<P>
Wang, a KMT stalwart, also wished Ma the best in the party's
presidential primary, in which Wang will not be participating.
