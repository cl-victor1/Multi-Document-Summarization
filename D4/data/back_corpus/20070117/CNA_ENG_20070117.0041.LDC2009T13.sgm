China Steel Corp., Taiwan's largest steelmaker, made NT$47.6
billion (US$1.45 billion) in before-tax profits in 2006 despite
investment losses in another company, a spokesman for the company
said Wednesday.

<P>
The spokesman stated the profits from a total revenue of NT$177.6
billion last year would translate into before-tax earnings of
NT$4.31 per common share.
</P>
<P>
China Steel is looking forward to more than NT$50 billion in
before-tax profits this year, the spokesman added.
</P>
<P>
He said that China Steel was able to reap such profits despite
declining sales for its steel products in November and December
last year and the company's investment loss in the Asia Pacific
Broadband Telecom Co.
</P>
<P>
Twenty-three listed enterprises held shares in telecommunication
service operator Asia-Pacific Broadband Telecom Co., which has a
capitalization of NT$7.749 billion but has recently suffered
losses amounting to NT$2.8 billion.

<P>
China Steel and an affiliate have written off NT$1 billion of
their NT$1.6 billion investment in that company.
