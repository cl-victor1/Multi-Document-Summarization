Stressing  that integrity has always been the Taipei city
government's most valuable asset, Hau vowed to preserve the
tradition and pointed out that he is poised to take a series of
concrete measures to step up clean politics.

Setting up an anti-corrpution center under the city government
jurisdiction was one of Hau's campaign promises. Hau said the
city government's planned anti- corruption center will welcome
private-sector participation and surveillance to serve its ends
and further reinforce the public's confidence in municipal
officials, he said.

The Taipei city government hopes to build an environment in which
officials are free from interference so as to better serve Taipei
residents, he added.

Commenting on recent cases of irregularities committed by Taipei
policemen, Hau insisted that those black sheep must be harshly
punished to maintain strict discipline and protect the image of
the municipal government.
