The appointment of a new State Public Prosecutor-General is
likely to pass the legislature on Thursday despite the opposition
Kuomintang's (KMT's) resistance, said ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) legislature whip Ker Chien-ming
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The KMT caucus conducted a straw vote on the issue Wednesday
afternoon, with 52 out of 75 votes going against Chen Tsung-ming,
the nominee  of President  Chen Shui-bian  for the country's  top
prosecutorial post. A day earlier, KMT Chairman Ma Ying-jeou said
he opposed the nomination.
</P>
<P>
Ker said Ma's stance over the nomination contradicted his own
previous talk of harmony between the ruling and opposition
parties. He said Ma's political future willbe buriedif the State
Public Prosecutor-General nomination and Central Government
General Budget Bill fail to pass during this legislature session.
</P>
<P>
Approval of the nomination requires yes votes from half of the
lawmakers present. The KMT holds 90 seats and the DPP 84 seats in
the now 218-seat legislature. Two other opposition parties, the
People First Party and Taiwan Solidarity Union, are to decide
their stances on the nomination Thursday before the voting. Ker
did not elaborate on how the DPP expected to win.
