The government will provide NT$100 billion (US$3.5 billion) in
loans to encourage people in Taiwan to refurbish their homes as a
part of efforts to stimulate domestic market demand, officials at
the Ministry of the Interior disclosed Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The officials at the ministry's Construction and Planning Agency
likened the construction industry to a locomotive driving the
nation's economic development and said that the low-interest
loans provided by the government for housing renovation are
expected to bring a lot of business to Taiwan's construction
companies.

<P>
Many of the houses in Taipei and other cities are more than 30
years old. With the housing market currently booming, homeowners
are more willing than before to renovate their houses to increase
their property value, officials said.
</P>
<P>
They added that all homeowners who can present a renovation plan
are elegible for a loan, and that homeowners in a block of
apartments are encouraged to talk with their neighbors to work
out a plan to renovate the entire building.
