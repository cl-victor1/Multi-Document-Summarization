The CommonWealth Magazine, one of Taiwan's most respected
magazine on economics, politics and current events, launched its
Web-based English edition Wednesday aimed at presenting Taiwan's
story to the world.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the CommonWealth English Online's launch ceremony,
CommonWealth Magazine Chairwoman Diane Ying said the new Web
edition will feature in-depth articles  on technology,  society,
and cross-Taiwan Strait business and finance that will afford
non-Chinese readers a more sophisticated understanding of the
trends shaping events in Taiwan than can be had from the daily
headlines.
</P>
<P>
Noting that CommonWealth English Online was launched as part of
the magazine's 25th anniversary, Ying, who previously worked as
the Taiwan correspondent for the Asian Wall Street Journal, the
New York Times and UPI, said the launch of the magazine's English
online edition is a "dream come true" for her.

<P>
"When we founded CommonWealth 25 years ago, many of my foreign
friends asked me when we were going to have an English version to
introduce Taiwan's story to the world. Today, we are able to
unveil CommonWealth English Online. For me, it's a dream that's
taken a quarter century to come true."
</P>
<P>
The Website will feature streaming video of interviews and
lectures by a variety of prominent business figures, article
series on special themes, color photographs from the print
edition and English versions of surveys on major events or
phenomena in Taiwan. The goal is to provide more in-depth
information on Taiwan and the greater Chinese community to the
world at large.
</P>
<P>
In presenting the "distinct voice of Taiwan, " Ying said the
online version will share with the international community the
"rational analysis and passionate concern that has always been
the hallmark" of the CommonWealth Magazine, which is now in a bi-
weekly format.
