The lighting system in Taipei County's Bitan Special Scenic Area
is going to be changed to locally developed and manufactured
light emitting diode (LED) streetlamps, academic sources said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The project is in the second stage of testing, they said.
</P>
<P>
The innovative LED lighting system, developed by the New Energy
Center at National Taiwan University (NTU) and manufactured by
Taiwan-based Advanced Thermal Devices (ATD), is the first of its
kind to apply state-of-the-art heat- dissipating technology to
commercial production.
</P>
<P>
Huang Bin-juine, director of the New Energy Center, explained
that LEDs are susceptible to high temperatures -- with a ceiling
of around 90 degrees Celsius, therefore, the main obstacle in
mass production is controlling the temperature.
</P>
<P>
Huang added that thanks to an innovative heat-sink module
developed by a team of scientists from Taiwan, Ukraine and
Russia, LEDs can now be used in outdoor lighting.
</P>
<P>
The LEDs have already been tested on the NTU campus and the
results prove that LED streetlamps can save energy compared to
conventional lamps.
</P>
<P>
Hu Sheng-hisung, ATD's LED project director, noted that an LED
lamp consumes 75 percent less energy than a mercury lamp and 49
percent less than a sodium lamp.
</P>
<P>
He added that if all Taiwan's streetlamps were replaced with
LEDs,  it would provide NT$85 billion  in annual savings  on
electricity.
