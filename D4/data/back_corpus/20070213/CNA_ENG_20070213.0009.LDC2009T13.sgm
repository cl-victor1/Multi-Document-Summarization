<HEADLINE>
TAIWAN'S FIRST CASE OF GERMAN MEASLES FOR THE YEAR REPORTED
</HEADLINE>

Taipei, Feb. 13 (CNA) 02/13/07  14:13:27 (By Lilian Wu)

A 34-year-old man was diagnosed as having rubella, or German
measles, in mid- January after developing high fever and rashes,
the Department of Health (DOH) said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Shih Wen-yi, deputy director of the DOH's Center for Disease
Control, said that the man has become the first rubella case in
Taiwan this year. Staff at the center were worried that he might
pass the disease on to pregnant women, but fortunately, this has
not taken place.
</P>
<P>
Shih said the man has never received vaccination against rubella,
measles or the mumps.
</P>
<P>
Rubella has yet to be rooted out in Taiwan, Shih said, adding
that the man probably was infected through breathing in the
flying particles of the saliva or the phlegm of a sick person.
</P>
<P>
He said that rubella is an illness caused by a virus. Adult men
will be immune from the disease for the rest of their lives after
being infected, but they are likely to pass the disease on to
women, he continued.
</P>
<P>
If pregnant women are infected, this might result in a poor birth
outcome, such as stillbirth, premature delivery, or birth
defects.
</P>
<P>
Shih said that there were three indigenous and three imported
German measles cases in Taiwan last year.
</P>
<P>
The center received 23 confirmed cases of German measles over the
past five years, with most of the patients being middle-aged or
old people, Shih said. The youngest female was only two years
old, while the youngest male was 16. The children were infected
mainly because they did not receive their shots before traveling
with their parents abroad, he added.
</P>
<P>
The government has inoculated children under 15 months old
against measles, rubella and the mumps since 1992. It also gave
shots to primary school students and female junior high school
students between 1992 and 1994, Shih said.
</P>
<P>
This means that everyone under the age of 28 has received
vaccinations against measles and the mumps, he said, adding that
women over the age of 28 should get shots against measles and
rubella at least one month before a planned pregnancy.
