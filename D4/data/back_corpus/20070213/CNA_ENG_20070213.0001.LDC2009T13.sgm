Renamed state-owned petroleum and shipbuilding companies will
retain the rights to their current trademarks, the two companies
said Monday.
</P>
<P>
The company formerly known as the Chinese Petroleum Corp. became
"CPC Corporation, Taiwan" after the company's board meeting
Friday, and the China Shipbuilding Corp. is set to change its
name to "CSBS Corporation, Taiwan" in March, with their
respective abbreviations CPC and CSBS remaining unchanged.
</P>
<P>
The CPC also said that it will retain its well-established
trademark torch, which is displayed high above every CPC gas
station.
</P>
<P>
It also filed a pre-registration enquiry with the Ministry of
Economic Affairs (MOEA) seeking the right to use its original
name; the move allows it to set up a new company under that name
within six months, MOEA officials said.
</P>
<P>
Even if the CPC or the CSBS stops using its original name or
trademark after the changes takes effect, the government will not
--over the next few years -- register identical or similar marks
proposed by other parties because the CPC and CSBS marks are
well-known and receive special protection under the Trademark
Act, the Intellectual Property Office said.
