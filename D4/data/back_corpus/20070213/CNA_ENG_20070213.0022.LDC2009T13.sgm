GRAND JUSTICES HOLD SESSION ON PRESIDENT'S REQUEST
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taipei,  Feb. 13 (CNA) 02/13/07  17:30:02 (By Lilian Wu)
</P>
<P>
Grand justices began a two-day exploratory session Tuesday on
President  Chen Shui-bian's  request for a constitutional
interpretation aimed at suspending trial currently dealing with
the high-profile "state affairs fund" case in which the first
lady is one of the defendants.
</P>
<P>
Five professors -- Lee Hui-tsung, Hsu Cheng-jung, Chang Tai-lin,
Chen Tsung-wen and Yang Yun-hua -- who specialize in German and
French law, were invited to participate, Fan Kuang-chun,
secretary general of the Judicial Yuan said.
</P>
<P>
Fan said the grand justices have taken into consideration the
academic specialties,  personal willingness to contribute,  and
availability of scholars as they collect more information on the
relevant issues.
</P>
<P>
"The exploratory session does not mean that the grand justices
have reached any decisions. There is no cause for speculation, "
he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Two items on the agenda of the exploratory session were the
criminal immunity of the president and the state secret privilege
enjoyed by the president.
</P>
<P>
On the president's immunity, the discussion focused on the nature
and content of the immunity as stipulated in the Article 52 of
the Constitution,  and compared this with related articles in the
constitutions or other relevant laws of the United States, France
and Germany.
</P>
<P>
On the president's state secret privilege,  the discussion
centered on which similar privileges in the United States, France
and Germany might be used by the grand justices in deciding
whether or not to accept the request for a constitutional
interpretation.
</P>
<P>
The first day session began at 9 a.m. and closed at 12:30 p.m. It
was presided over by Judicial Yuan President Weng Yueh-sheng.
Each of the five scholars was given 20 minutes to express his
views, then the grand justices and the scholars engaged in a
question-and-answer session.
</P>
<P>
The five scholars wouldn't share much information following the
closed-door session. Professional Hsu said only that they did not
discuss the injunction, and mainly provided opinions on foreign
laws with which they are familiar.
</P>
<P>
In the second day session Wednesday, scholars specializing in
American constitution will be present. The Judicial Yuan also
presented written briefs on the definition of state secret
privilege in Japan, Austria and Australia.
</P>
<P>
Presidential Office Deputy Secretary-General Cho Jung-tai filed
the interpretation request with the Council of Grand Justices
(CGI) Jan. 25 on behalf of President Chen in the hope of
clarifying the constitutionality of the court proceedings on the
"state affairs fund" case.
</P>
<P>
Cho also filed an injunction petition asking the Judicial Yuan to
order the Taipei District Court to immediately stop the trial and
repeal its previous ruling on opening supposedly "secret" files
relating to the case.
</P>
<P>
First lady Wu Shu-jen, along with three former and incumbent
senior aides at the Presidential Office, is being tried at the
Taipei District Court after she and President Chen were named by
a public prosecutor as "joint perpetrators" in an embezzlement
case involving the alleged misuse of the president's
discretionary "state affairs fund."
</P>
<P>
In a lengthy document submitted to the CGJ Jan. 25, the
Presidential Office said the interpretation request is aimed at
defending the constitutional status of the presidency,
maintaining the  democratic  system  and protecting  the sanctity
of the constitution.
</P>
<P>
Since the president  is protected  by Article  52 of the
Constitution, it has been argued that the court cannot ask the
president to testify during the investigation process and court
hearing; nor, it is argued, can the court order him to surrender
secret documents or even hear the case as, according to Article
52, the president enjoys immunity to litigation other than
treason and sedition and cannot be prosecuted until his term
expires, the statement added.
</P>
<P>
The petition further states that the Taipei District Court
infringed on the president's executive privilege and risked
leaking state secrets by opening secret files relating to the
"state affairs fund" case.
</P>
<P>
Chen has denied any wrongdoing with regards to the special "state
affairs fund" and claims that he has not lined his pockets with
monies from the fund. He has promised to resign if his wife is
found guilty in the first trial.
