CENTRAL TAIWAN SCIENCE PARK GETS ADDITIONAL FUNDING FOR ACCESS
ROAD

Taichung,  Feb. 13 (CNA) 02/13/07  20:37:47 (By Han Nai-kuo)

Premier Su Tseng-chang promised Tuesday that the Cabinet will
appropriate an additional NT$1.8 billion (US$54.38 million) to
help the Central Taiwan Science Park complete an access road at
an early date to link the industrial complex with the public road
system.
</P>
<P>
Su gave the assurance during an inspection tour of the park that
the funds will be channeled to match the progress in the
construction of the access road, so that industrial companies
setting up shop in the park can enjoy convenient transportation.
</P>
<P>
At a briefing for the premier, Taichung Mayor Jason Hu said
construction of the access road has lagged behind schedule
because the original budget from the central and local
governments was insufficient to meet the extra costs arising from
the widening of the road from an originally designed width of 30
meters to 60 meters.
</P>
<P>
He said the 3-km road linking the science park with the No. 1
Freeway and the Taichung-Changhua Expressway carries a price tag
of NT$4.67 billion, of which NT$2.2 billion came from Taichung
City and NT$400 million from Taichung County.
</P>
<P>
Although the Cabinet has earmarked NT$100 million for the
project, there is still a shortfall of NT$1.8 billion, Hu said,
adding that insufficient funding could delay the completion of
the road from the end of 2008 to 2013 and have an adverse impact
on the operations of the science park as well as the development
of central Taiwan.
