INDICTMENT DOES NOT MEAN GUILT: PFP SPOKESMAN
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,   Feb.   13  (CNA) 02/13/07  19:58:14 (By Elizabeth Hsu)
</P>
<P>
The indictment against opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman and
former Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou does not mean he is guilty, a
spokesman for the opposition People First Party (PFP) pointed out
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Lee Hung-chun made the remarks after the Taiwan High Prosecutor's
Office indicted Ma on embezzlement charges. He also expressed
hope that the court will deal with the case swiftly and that the
case will not affect the year-end legislative election or the
2008 presidential election.
</P>
<P>
If the KMT asks for the PFP's cooperation regarding the two major
elections, the PFP -- the KMT's political ally -- will give a
hand under the newly formed KMT- PFP alliance, Lee said.
</P>
<P>
Ma, who used to be regarded as a political "Mr. Clean, " was
charged with lining his pockets during his eight-year mayoral
term that ended at the end of 2006 with NT$11 million
(US$332,684) from a special fund set aside for the mayor's
discretionary use.
</P>
<P>
One of Ma's aides, Yu Wen, who allegedly used others' invoices to
help Ma claim reimbursements from the fund, was also indicted for
embezzling NT$760,000 from the fund.
</P>
<P>
Lee urged the "pan-blue alliance" of the KMT and the PFP to stick
together through the challenge.
</P>
<P>
Mentioning the alleged involvement of President Chen Shui-bian,
his wife Wu Chu- jen and several of his aides, in a state affairs
fund embezzlement scandal, Lee claimed they are more suspicious
than Ma of involvement.
</P>
<P>
Lee also urged the judicial authorities to launch investigations
into Vice President Annette Lu, Premier Su Tseng-chang, ruling
Democratic Progressive Party Chairman Yu Shyi-kun and former
Premier Frank Hsieh, all of who also had special funds during
their services as administrators of local governments.
