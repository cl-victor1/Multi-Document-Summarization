Visiting National Chiao Tung University  President  Wu Chung-yu
met with Robert Birgeneau, Chanciller of UC Berkeley, to discuss
possible cooperation between the University System of Taiwan
(UST) and UC Berkeley Monday during a visit to Silicon Valley.
</P>
<P>
The UST represents National Chiao Tung University, National
Tsinghua University, National Central University and National
Yang Ming University.
</P>
<P>
Wu noted that there are 120 foreign students at National Chiao
Tung University, and the number is expected to increase to 400;
the number of exchange students is expected to increase to 300
per year.
</P>
<P>
During his visit to UC Berkeley, Wu expressed his hope that there
will be greater bilateral cooperation and academic exchanges
between the schools, particularly in the areas of electric
engineering, information engineering and biomedics.
</P>
<P>
He also visited biomedic research projects of UC Berkeley and UC
San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
Wu's visit to Silicon Valley is also aimed at meeting with alumni
of the Chiao Tung University in the region and soliciting
opportunities for Chiao Tung University students to intern at
high-tech firms in Silicon Valley.
</P>
<P>
Wu pointed out that Chiao Tung University is currently ranked
just behind National  Taiwan University,  National  Cheng Kung
University and National Tsinghua University in Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Although Chiao Tung University excels in nurturing semiconductor
talents for Taiwan, its ranking cannot improve as the school has
no departments of biology or medicine.
</P>
<P>
He said that the school is planning to cooperate with other
schools in research related to biomedicine to improve the overall
academic rating of the school.
