Taipei,  Feb,  13  (CNA) 02/13/07  20:56:20 (By Y.C. Jou)

<P>
Legislators of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)
welcomed Tuesday the indictment of Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Ma
Ying-jeou over his alleged embezzlement of a special allowance
fund during his two Taipei mayoral terms.
</P>
<P>
"Ma owes the people of Taiwan an apology," DPP legislature caucus
leader Ker Chien-ming said at a news conference.
</P>
<P>
"He kept patching up lies with other lies during the criminal
investigation, causing turmoil in society; he provoked partisan
conflict in the legislature during his chairmanship, failing all
the bills crucial to people's lives," Ker claimed.
</P>
<P>
Hsieh Hsin-ni, the DPP legislator who originally made the
corruption allegations against Ma,  claimed the indictment has
"proved" that the accusations against Ma and evidence unfavorable
to him in the case were not political manipulations, as the KMT
claimed.
</P>
<P>
You Ching, a DPP at-large legislator, complained that the
indictment should have been made earlier, claiming that it had
been made pretty clear that Ma treated the special fund as
personal property rather than spending it on official business.
</P>
<P>
Yeh Yi-jin, a DPP legislator from Tainan County, said the
principle that public funds should only be used for public
business should not be violated.
</P>
<P>
Kao Chien-chih, a DPP legislator from Taipei City, described the
indictment as a "celebration of democracy and rule of law" and
called on the KMT not treat Ma's case and President Chen Shui-
bian's special state affairs fund cases differently.
</P>
<P>
The prosecutors said Ma, during his two consecutive terms as
Taipei mayor from 1998 to 2006, received a total of NT$15.29
million (US$461,934) in a mayoral special allowance fund
designated for his discretionary use and failed to return the
unspent portion - some NT$11.17 million (US$337,650) -- to the
national coffers but instead kept the money in his own account.
</P>
<P>
Ma has contended that he had no intention of breaking the law,
pointing out that his treatment of the fund is in line with the
way such funds are treated by every high-ranking public official
across party lines.
