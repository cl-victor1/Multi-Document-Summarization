Taipei,  Feb. 13 (CNA) 02/13/07  15:52:19 (By Flor Wang)

The main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) has readied itself to cope
with all sorts of possible scenarios in case Chairman Ma Ying-
jeou is indicted over embezzlement charges related to his special
municipal fund during his term as mayor of Taipei, KMT spokesman
Su Chun-pin said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Whether or not Ma is indicted, the KMT will deal with the
situation according to an established set of mechanisms, Su said.
</P>
<P>
Although Ma has been viewed as the KMT's most likely candidate to
run in the 2008 presidential election, Su made it clear that Ma
will offer to resign from the party's top post if he is indicted
over his alleged misuse of special municipal  funds allocated
for his discretionary use while serving as Taipei mayor from
1998-2006.
</P>
<P>
Su gave assurances that Ma, as a responsible politician, will
"definitely" live up to his promise by stepping down from KMT
chairmanship if indicted, consistent with his efforts to help
raise Taiwan's moral standards.
</P>
<P>
According to Su, the KMT needs to be fully united in the face of
the unprecedented situation and called for calm among supporters.
</P>
<P>
Sources close to the KMT said that the party's powerful Central
Standing Committee will call an emergency meeting later in the
day to discuss measures to deal with the latest development.
