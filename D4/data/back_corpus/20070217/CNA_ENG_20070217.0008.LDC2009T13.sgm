Shirley Shaw, wife of Taichung Mayor Jason Hu, on Saturday made
her first public appearance since being seriously injured in a
highway accident in late November.
</P>
<P>
Shaw was able to walk slowly with Hu leading her by the hand and
greet the public upon exiting the China Medical University
Hospital in Taichung, where she has been recuperating since the
accident. She will return to the hospital on Tuesday after
spending Lunar New Year's Eve at home.
</P>
<P>
Encouraged by her husband, Shaw faced the media cameras and
thanked the public for all their support and wished everyone a
Happy New Year in the hospital's lobby.

The traffic accident occurred on the evening of Nov. 18 when Hu
and his wife were heading home to Taichung from a campaign rally
in Kaohsiung along the north-bound section of the Formosa
Freeway. Their car rolled over after it was hit by a vehicle that
was trying to pass a truck. Shaw sustained serious injuries in
the accident and was unconscious when she arrived at Chimei
Hospital in Tainan. Hu also sustained minor injuries in the
accident.  The medical team treating Shaw said Saturday that it
will take between six months and a year for Shao to fully regain
her cognitive functions. They further said that she will be
fitted with an artificial limb for her amputated left forearm.
</P>
<P>
Hu expressed appreciation to the Chi Mei Medical Center, China
Medical University Hospital and the public "for praying for and
giving blessings to us."
