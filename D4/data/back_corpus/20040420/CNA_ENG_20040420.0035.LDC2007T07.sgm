Taipei,  April 20 (CNA) (By Deborah Kuo)

<P>
Authorities from the Center for Disease Control (CDC) on Tuesday
reported fresh cases of dysentery among Taiwan tourists who recently
returned from trips to the Indonesian resort island of Bali.
</P>
<P>
Three Taiwan citizens, who visited Bali between March 25 and April 1,
were confirmed by CDC laboratories to have contracted bacillary
dysentery, said Lai Ming-ho, chief of the CDC's quarantine and disease
prevention division.
</P>
<P>
The three tourists -- belonging to two Taiwan tourist groups with a
total of 39 people -- have been given treatment and placed under
observation.
</P>
<P>
Twenty-six other of the tour group members have been tracked down and
have tested negative for dysentry, while the remaining 10 have yet to
be examined, Lai said.
</P>
<P>
Bali, one of the most popular destinations for Taiwan tourists,
attracts about 400,000 Taiwanese visitors per year. It remained
popular even during the height of the severe acute respiratory
syndrome (SARS) outbreak early last year.
</P>
<P>
The dysentery outbreak in Bali has scared some Taiwan tourists away
from the resort island since last November after 111 Taiwan tourists
were confirmed to have contracted the disease. However, the number of
Taiwan visitors to Bali has picked up again this year.
