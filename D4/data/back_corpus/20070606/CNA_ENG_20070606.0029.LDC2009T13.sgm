METHADONE SUBSTITUTION PROGRAMS IN TAINAN AREA BEARING FRUIT

Programs being offered by hospitals in Tainan city and county to
help heroin addicts kick their habits with methadone substitution
have achieved good results, a doctor at National Cheng Kung
University Hospital said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Wang Yu-ting, who has been treating heroin addicts with the
methadone substitution program at Cheng Kung University Hospital,
quoted statistics as showing that from September 2006 until
February this year, hospitals in the Tainan area had treated 225
heroin addicts with methadone.
</P>
<P>
Before joining the programs, 67 percent of the 225 drug abusers
had committed criminal offenses, but after receiving the
methadone treatment, the criminal recurrence rate dropped to 0.02
percent, Wang pointed out.
</P>
<P>
He added that Cheng Kung University Hospital has treated 35 new
heroin addicts in the past two months but has found that about 70
percent of them have contracted HIV, hepatitis or syphilis --
mostly through intravenous injection of opiates.
</P>
<P>
Noting that intravenous injection has replaced sexual contact as
the No. 1 cause of HIV transmission in Taiwan, Wang cited
statistics, saying that more than 2,000 people in Taiwan
contracted HIV in 2005 from using contaminated needles or
syringes to inject heroin.
</P>
<P>
Methadone substitution is a relatively inexpensive method used by
many countries to treat opiate addiction. Unlike heroin, which
must be smoked or injected, methadone can be prescribed as a
liquid syrup or in the form of pills. It is designed to suppress
chronic addicts' narcotic withdrawal and reduce their dependence
on heroin.
