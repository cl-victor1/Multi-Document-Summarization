Taipei,  June 6 (CNA) 06/06/07  23:00:13 (By T.C. Jiang)
</P>
<P>
Four soccer coaches from Paraguay began to pass on their
expertise to their Taiwanese counterparts and students Wednesday
as part of the Taiwanese government's efforts to promote the
sport at local schools.
</P>
<P>
The coaches will provide guidance to local trainers and students
at three training camps in eastern, southern, and central Taiwan,
June 6-16.
</P>
<P>
The camps are part of a collaboration between Taiwan and its
South American ally, Education Minister Tu Cheng-sheng announced
a day earlier at a press conference.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Education (MOE) hopes that the exchange will help
enhance the quality of instruction offered by local soccer
coaches so that the ministry can achieve its goal of successfully
promoting the sport in schools at all levels, Tu said.
</P>
<P>
President Chen Shui-bian once proposed the idea of sending 20
student soccer players to Brazil, a plan that is still being
studied by the Chinese Taipei Football Association, Tu noted.
</P>
<P>
Currently, the first step is to invite soccer coaches from
advanced countries to offer instruction to provide a boost to the
sport in Taiwan, Tu went on.
</P>
<P>
Tu said that he has never played soccer, but thinks that soccer
is a good sport because it builds one's physical strength and
endurance.
</P>
<P>
Soccer is also a suitable sport for Taiwanese players because
height is not an essential factor, Tu said.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan now has over 600 soccer teams, Tu said, adding that 500 of
these are based in primary schools.
</P>
<P>
The MOE hopes that the promotion of the sport can begin in
primary schools, according to the minister.
</P>
<P>
Paraguay's national soccer team currently ranks 16th in the
world, and 3rd in South America.
</P>
<P>
Paraguayan  Ambassador Ramon Antero Diaz Pereira,  who has
contributed to the soccer exchange, said he believes that the
four distinguished coaches from his nation will be conducive to
the development of soccer in Taiwan.
