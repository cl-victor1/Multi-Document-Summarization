Taipei Mayor Hau Lung-bin has decided to cancel his planned trip
to Venice, Italy, for which he was scheduled to leave Wednesday
evening, city officials said.
</P>
<P>
Hau's assistants said that the chances of the mayor departing on
the trip over the next few days are low because torrential
rainfall has been forecast in the city. They added torrential
rainfall caused flooding in many low-lying areas of the city
early Wednesday morning.
</P>
<P>
Citing a Central Weather Bureau (CWB)  report,  City Fire
Department Director Hsung Kuang-hua said northern Taiwan
monitoring stations  detected  storm clouds over the Zhuzihu
district on Yangmingshan in suburban Taipei, as well as over the
districts of Shipai, Guandu, Tienmu, Shilin and Waishuangxi early
in the morning.
</P>
<P>
CWB meteorologists have therefore forecast more rainfall over the
next several days and warned people living in low-lying areas of
possible flooding, Hsung said during a disaster control meeting
presided over by Hau at the fire department.
</P>
<P>
Hau had planned to depart for Venice Wednesday evening to attend
the 52nd Venice Biennale activities and preside over the opening
of the Taiwan Pavilion at the exhibition.
