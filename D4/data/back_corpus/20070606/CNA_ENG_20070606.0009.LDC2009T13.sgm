The Criminal Investigation Bureau (CIB) arrested two drug "mules"
and a "fund provider" in Taichung City, central Taiwan Wednesday,
confiscating 28 bricks of high-grade heroin with an estimated
street value of nearly NT$100 million (US$3 million) in the
process.

According to officials from the CIB central Taiwan operations,
Lin Jui-yi, a behind-the-scene fund provider, sent a huge sum of
money to a drug dealer in Vietnam in early May for the purchase
and process of the heroin bricks.

Wang Hsien-min and Wu Chun-chieh, the two traffickers, then
traveled to Vietnam to pick up the heroin. Wang and Wu reportedly
first packed the heroin bricks in the bellies of fish, then froze
the fish and sent the "frozen seafood" to a Taiwan-bound fishing
boat heading for the southern port city of Kaohsiung.

Unaware that a CIB mobile unit had been monitoring them since
late May, Wang, Wu and Lin were arrested in Taichung City Tuesday
while the shipment of fish containing the heroin was being
delivered from Kaohsiung to a house located on Taichung City's
Loyeh Street where they were expecting to receive the shipment.
