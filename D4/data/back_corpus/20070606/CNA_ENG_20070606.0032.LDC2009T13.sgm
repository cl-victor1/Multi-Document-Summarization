TIES WITH TAIWAN REMAIN UNCHANGED: COSTA RICA FOREIGN MINISTER
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

Panama  City,  June 6 (CNA) 06/06/07  19:51:52 (By Ramon Huang

<P>
Costa Rican Foreign Minister Bruno Stagno denied Wednesday news
reports that alarm bells are ringing on diplomatic relations
between Costa Rica and the Republic of China, saying that Costa
Rica's ties with Taiwan remain unchanged.
</P>
<P>
Stagno said Costa Rica will continue to cement ties with Taiwan
but will not exclude the possibility of continued strengthening
of business exchanges with China.
</P>
<P>
Stagno also rebutted recent news reports that Costa Rica and
Taiwan are in a spat over several matters.
</P>
<P>
An AFP Spanish-language report said the day before that Costa
Rica and Taiwan have been at odds recently because on May 14, the
Costa Rican ambassador to the World Health Organization (WHO)
cast a "no" vote in the world health regulatory body's annual
assembly in Geneva on the issue of whether to include Taiwan's
membership application on its agenda.
</P>
<P>
Defending his nation's position on that incident, Stagno said
Costa Rica has rendered its support for Taiwan every year since
1993 on Taiwan's bids to join the WHO and the United Nations.
However, he went on, Taiwan changed its strategies in its WHO and
U.N. bids this year without giving Costa Rica sufficient advance
notification.
</P>
<P>
Instead of applying for admission into the World Health Assembly
-- the top decision-making body of the WHO -- as an observer,
Taiwan directly filed for full membership in the WHO in the name
of "Taiwan" this year.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Rafael Ramirez, a consultant to the Costa Rica Chamber
of Exporters, said during an interview with the AFP recently that
Costa Rica has maintained a "strategically important"
relationship with Taiwan that should not be changed under any
circumstances.
</P>
<P>
Ramirez added that although China has a seductively huge market,
many expectations are only "illusory."
</P>
<P>
Costa Rica established diplomatic ties with the ROC in 1944 and
the two countries have since maintained cordial relations until
recently.
