Local pop singer Lin Hsiao-pei is facing severe punishment for
drunk driving and a possible civil lawsuit after her car hit a 41
-year-old nurse while she was driving drunk Wednesday in downtown
Taipei.

The nurse died in hospital from serious wounds. Police said that
because  of the death and the fact that Lin's blood alcohol
concentration was at 1.1 mg per liter, far above the limit of
0.55 mg, she will face charges of involuntary manslaughter and
offenses against public safety.

However, despite killing a pedestrian, Lin will be subject to a
maximum of just three years of imprisonment according to the
Criminal Code, along with a maximum fine of just NT$60,000
(US$1,810). She will also have her license revoked.

The victim's family will also have the right to file a civil
lawsuit against Lin to claim compensation of up to NT$10 million,
according to city police.
