Tokyo,  June  6 (CNA) 06/06/07  16:25:01 (By Mike Chang and Y.F.

<P>
Former Republic of China President Lee Teng-hui has been invited
to address the Foreign Correspondents Club of Japan (FCCJ) this
weekend, FCCJ officials said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Lee will speak on Japan's foreign policy and then take questions
from the media, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
The event will replace an original plan by Lee to hold a news
conference June 9, the same day he is scheduled to wrap up his
11-day visit and return to Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
The change in itinerary indicates that his Japan visit has
attracted a high level of media attention, observers said.
</P>
<P>
The FCCJ was founded in 1945 and has more than 300 members. It
often invites Japanese or foreign celebrities to speak at the
club.
</P>
<P>
President Chen Shui-bian held a video conference with the club in
July 2005, and opposition Kuomintang then-Chairman Ma Ying-jeou
addressed the club during a visit to Japan in July 2006.
</P>
<P>
This is Lee's third trip to Japan since his presidency ended in
May 2000. However, the trip marks the first time he has visited
Tokyo and the first time he has made a public speech in the
country.
</P>
<P>
On June 1, he addressed an audience in Tokyo after he was awarded
the first Shimpei Goto Prize by the Japanese publisher Fijiwara
Shoten's Goto Shimpei Organization in recognition of his
contribution to Taiwan's urbanization and democratization.
</P>
<P>
Lee was scheduled to deliver a speech at Akita International
University Wednesday on the final stop of a tour of northeastern
Japan, after which he was expected to return to Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, he will visit Takushoku University in Tokyo and
address the Friends of Lee Teng-hui Club on the global situation
in 2007 and after.
</P>
<P>
He has also indicated his desire to visit the controversial
Yasukuni Shrine in Tokyo to pay his respects to his older brother
who died fighting for the Japanese colonial government during
World War II. It was uncertain if Lee will realize the plan. The
shrine also reveres executed Japanese war criminals.
