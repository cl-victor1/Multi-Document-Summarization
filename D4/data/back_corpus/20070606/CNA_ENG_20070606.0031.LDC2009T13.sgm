MAC OPPOSES REDUCING ID WAITING PERIOD FOR CHINESE SPOUSES
</HEADLINE>

Taipei, June 6 (CNA) 06/06/07  19:42:21 (By Lilian Wu)

An opposition-initiated draft amendment to a statute that would
halve the waiting period for Chinese spouses of Taiwan nationals
seeking identification cards would be "too lax" and would be
"unfair, " the nation's top China policy- planning body said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) expressed the view as a
Legislative Yuan committee was set to review the amendment to the
Statute Governing the Relations between the People of the Taiwan
Area and the Mainland Area later that day that would cut the
waiting period from eight years to four.
</P>
<P>
MAC officials said that according to the amendment, Chinese
spouses would in fact have to stay in Taiwan for only one-
and-a-half years before they get ID cards, compared with women
from other foreign countries married to Taiwanese men, who would
have to stay here for two-and-a-half years before getting ID
cards.
</P>
<P>
MAC officials noted that foreign women married to Taiwanese men
have to reside in Taiwan continuously for three years to get ROC
nationality,  and then only if they give  up their  original
nationalities and pass naturalization tests. After that, they can
get ID cards after actually staying in Taiwan for more than two-
and-a-half years, they said.
</P>
<P>
The officials said that foreign women married to Taiwanese men
and Chinese spouses are different immigrants, noting that the
statute does not demand that Chinese spouses pass naturalization
tests.
</P>
<P>
"This is why we should not take the example of `foreign spouses'
as reference for adjusting the system for Chinese spouses, lest
it cause chaos," the officials added.
</P>
<P>
The number of Chinese spouses has exceeded 290,000, while the
number of foreign women married to Taiwanese men has exceeded
130,000, the officials said. If the waiting period for Chinese
spouses to obtain ID cards is shortened, the number will balloon,
which will seriously impact Taiwan's social welfare resources,
job market and social security overall.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, if the Chinese spouses obtain ID cards, they can apply
for their direct kin aged over 70 and under 12 to come to Taiwan,
so that the ensuing influx of Chinese will increase dramatically,
the officials said.
</P>
<P>
The officials said that at present, the people on both sides of
the Taiwan Strait are wide apart in terms of cultural background,
social and education environment, living conditions and core
values.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the problem of bogus marriages, or marriages of
convenience among people on both sides of the Taiwan Strait, is
still serious, while statistics released by the Ministry of the
Interior show that the number of divorces in cross-strait
marriages exceeds 7,000 couples over the past two years.
