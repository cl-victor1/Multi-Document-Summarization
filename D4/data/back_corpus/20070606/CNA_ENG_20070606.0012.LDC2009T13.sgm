<P>
The Council of Labor Affairs (CLA) put forward five measures
Wednesday to help alleviate the impact on small- and medium-size
enterprises of the 9.09 percent minimum wage hike announced
earlier the same day by Premier Chang Chun-hsiung.
</P>
<P>
CLA Chairman Lu Tien-lin said that lower class workers and their
families are expected to benefit when the country's minimum wage
is hiked to NT$17,280 (US$523.64) per month and the hourly wage
is raised to NT$95 on July 1, but he added that the hike may have
a negative impact on small- and medium-size enterprises.
</P>
<P>
To offset the expected negative impact, Lu said, the CLA has
decided to subsidize  owners of certain businesses,  including
fast-food chains, restaurants, supermarkets and gas stations,
with a working staff of less than 50 people. The owners will be
entitled to subsidies of NT$10 per hour per head when the staff
members work less than 32 hours a week. This subsidy incentive
will be implemented for one year on a trial basis, he added.
</P>
<P>
The CLA has also decided to offer subsidies of NT$5,000 per month
per head to owners of companies which employ disadvantaged
workers, including physically and mentally challenged people and
senior citizens.
</P>
<P>
To deal with the possibility that many workers may lose their
jobs because of the hike in the minimum hourly wage, the CLA will
also work to help disadvantaged workers find employment, receive
vocational training and receive unemployment subsidies, Lu noted.
</P>
<P>
The CLA will also see to it that the food and accommodation
allowance provided to foreign laborers working in Taiwan is
raised from the current NT$4,000 per month to NT$5,000.
</P>
<P>
CLA vocational training subsidies will also be raised as the
fifth measure to deal with the impact of the hike in the minimum
wage, which has remained unchanged since 1997, Lu said.
