CHINA WILL NEVER BUDGE ON ISSUE OF SOVEREIGNTY: PRESIDENT
</HEADLINE>

Taipei, June 6 (CNA) 06/06/07  17:08:26 (By Lilian Wu)

<P>
President Chen Shui-bian predicted Wednesday that China will
never budge on the issue of Taiwan's sovereignty and said it will
have to be Taiwan that capitulates and surrenders its own
sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
The president made the remarks when he received a delegation of
U.S. China experts led by David M. Lampton at the Presidential
Office.
</P>
<P>
"As Taiwan's president, I can't forego the national sovereignty
of Taiwan," Chen said.
</P>
<P>
He also  told  the presidential  candidates  for the 2008
presidential election that they must not harbor any illusions
about any softening of China's basic stance.
</P>
<P>
According to Chen, China's obstruction of Taiwan has always been
relentless irrespective which party is in power and he claimed
that the plight has "remained unchanged" from the period of the
late presidents Chiang Kai-shek and Chiang Ching-kuo down to
former President Lee Teng-hui.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the National Unification Council (NUC) -- a
government agency to promote Taiwan's eventual unification with
China -- was founded in 1990 during Lee's time as president, but
China still test fired missiles into waters near Taiwan ahead of
the country's first popular presidential election in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Chen scrapped the NUC in early 2006, along with the National
Unification Guidelines.
</P>
<P>
He said his own experience over the past seven years has taught
him never to harbor any illusions about China.
</P>
<P>
China's basic stance is "clear, steadfast and has never changed
over the years," which is that Taiwan is not a sovereign state
and that Taiwan is part of the People's Republic of China, the
president said.
</P>
<P>
"For China, Taiwan is a local government, a special
administrative region and a second Hong Kong," he said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that China is doing its best to marginalize Taiwan,
citing the examples of Taiwan's setback in bidding for World
Health Organization membership due to China's obstruction and a
recent move by the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) to
downgrade Taiwan's membership to the level of a "non-sovereign
regional member" under pressure from China.
</P>
<P>
"The question now is whether or not to insist on Taiwan's
sovereignty, whether or not to resist the notion of Taiwan as a
part of the People's Republic of China," Chen said.
</P>
<P>
Since he assumed the presidency in 2000, his administration has
rejected the "one China" principle espoused by China, as well as
eventual unification with China, Chen added.
