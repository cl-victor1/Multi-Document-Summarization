Over half of Taiwan's families have tried Chinese medicine,
Western medicine and folk therapy as medical treatment options
have become more diversified, official of National Cheng Kung
University hospital said Wednesday.

Family medicine Dr. Huang Ying-hsiang said that a study on the
medical treatment of 2,000 families around the country found that
nearly half of rural families and nearly two-thirds of urban
families have sought the three different forms of treatment.

<P>
Western medicine is still the mainstream therapy in Taiwan,
although traditional Chinese medicine has become the most
commonly sought after treatment after Western medicine, while the
use of subsidiary and alternative therapies have also become
popular.
</P>
<P>
The results  of a survey  conducted  in 2003  show  that three-
quarters of the respondents said they would seek at least one
kind of subsidiary or alternative therapy.
</P>
<P>
Those who have received higher education, are middle class and in
poor health, and those who are women, who suffer from anxiety,
chronic pain or urinary problems, are more often likely to seek
alternative therapy, the study found.
