KAOHSIUNG COUNTY FARMERS CALL FOR MONKEY CULL
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

Kaohsiung  County,  June 5 (CNA) 06/06/07  10:46:10 (By Han Nai-
kuo)
</P>
<P>
Farmers in the southern Taiwan county of Kaohsiung are urging the
government to control the population of protected Formosan
macaques in order to lessen the damage they cause to crops.
</P>
<P>
Making the appeal on behalf of the farmers during a county
council  meeting Tuesday,  Councilor  Lin Fu-pao  called  for
government-supervised action to cull the monkeys that roam freely
in the county's rural townships and ravage fruit and other crops.
</P>
<P>
Lin pointed out that a colony of the monkeys ruined nearly 3,000
banana plants on a farm in a single night, while guava and mango
orchards in Chishan and Liukuei townships also lost all their
fruit to the animals.
</P>
<P>
He said the government should work out a system to permit monkey
culls during specific seasons.
</P>
<P>
When told by agriculture officials that Article 21 of the
nation's Wildlife Conservation Law allows farmers to catch or
kill the monkeys that ravage their crops but must report their
actions to local authorities, Lin said farmers cannot do the
killing because the law does not allow them to own firearms.
</P>
<P>
He said the county government should form a task force to help
farmers catch or shoot the monkeys.
</P>
<P>
The Formosan rock monkey is a species of macaque endemic to
Taiwan. Under the Wildlife Conservation Law, those who hunt or
trap the animals -- other than people coveredd under Article 21
of the law -- face up to five years in prison and fines of up to
NT$1 million (US$30,200).
</P>
<P>
According to an estimate by the Cabinet-level  Council of
Agriculture in 2001, Taiwan's rock monkey population totaled
about 250,000 at that time.
