Taipei,  April 3 (CNA) 04/03/07  21:48:20 (By T.C. Jiang)
</P>
<P>
Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) Chairman Joseph Wu has vowed to
continue improving relations between the United States and Taiwan
after assuming the post of Taiwan's representative to the U.S.
</P>
<P>
Wu made the remarks as he received a delegation consisting of
California State Assembly leaders at his office Monday.
</P>
<P>
Wu thanked the assembly for passing a resolution in 2004 in
support of Taiwan's bid to join the World Health Organization
(WHO).
</P>
<P>
Wu said that many Taiwanese elites received a higher education in
the U.S. and therefore have special feeling towards the country.
</P>
<P>
Noting that both Taiwan and the U.S. benefit from their
traditional friendship, Wu said that he will continue to
strengthen bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
He also pointed out that China often uses a carrot-and-stick
tactics against Taiwan, making goodwill gestures while at the
same time deploying missiles and submarines to target Taiwan, he
stressed.
</P>
<P>
This year, China has increased its defense budget by 17.8 percent
over last year, Wu said, adding that the expansion of Chinese
military power poses a threat to Taiwan as well as to security in
the Asia Pacific region.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, Beijing has spared no efforts in blocking
Taiwan's participation in international organizations, including
the United Nations and the WHO, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan is often unfairly and unjustly treated when engaging in
many international  activities  hosted  by  non-governmental
organizations (NGOs) and private sector due to China's
intervention, Wu said.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan's  recent moves to replace  the names of state-run
enterprises bearing the term "Chinese" or "China" with
"Taiwanese" or "Taiwan" has raised concerns internationally, Wu
stated.
</P>
<P>
In contrast, the international community remains silent when
Beijing asked organizers of many international events to force
Taiwanese participants to drop the official title of Taiwan --
the Republic of China -- Wu said, stressing that this is not fair
to democratically governed Taiwan.
