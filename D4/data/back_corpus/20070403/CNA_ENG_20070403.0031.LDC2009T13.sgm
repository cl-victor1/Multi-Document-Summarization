PREMIER AGREES TO GIO CHIEF'S RESIGNATION

Taipei, April 3 (CNA) 04/03/07  19:46:55 (By Flor Wang) (By Flor

Premier Su Tseng-chang said Tuesday that he has agreed to accept
Government Information Office (GIO) Minister Cheng Wen-tsang's
resignation over his disputed role in a share release case
involving Taiwan Television Enterprise (TTV).
</P>
<P>
Su said that he decided to accept Cheng's resignation after
reading through an investigative report by Vice Premier Tsai Ing-
wen on the contentious case that has drawn flak from opposition
lawmakers who blasted Cheng for seeking to pressure an executive
of Japan's Fuji TV network to sell that company's shares in the
TTV to a local investor during a Jan. 17 dinner banquet in
Taipei.
</P>
<P>
Sumio Hasegawa, a Fuji TV representative, in a news conference
last Sunday accused Cheng of attempting to persuade him to sell
Fuji's holding of TTV shares to the Taipei-based Liberty Times
Group, which Cheng claimed is Fuji TV's best choice for the
newspaper's good relations with the Democratic Progressive Party
government.
</P>
<P>
"It was indeed improper for Cheng to host the dinner banquet," Su
acknowledged, but he added that "Cheng did not mean to intervene
in the matter, which is evident in that the Japanese TV company
did not sell its TTV shares to the Liberty Times."
</P>
<P>
The Fuji TV network eventually sold its TTV shares to a private
company set up by former TTV Chairman Lai Kuo-chou, who was
dismissed from the post in March.
</P>
<P>
According to Su, Cheng tendered his resignation Monday out of
concern that the Cabinet's image might be affected due to his
controversial role in the case.
</P>
<P>
The premier said that he was reluctant to accept Cheng's
resignation and praised his efforts and hard work over the past
one-plus year.
</P>
<P>
However, Su failed to answer reporters' questions touching on who
will replace Cheng.
</P>
<P>
According to Tsai, no one in the government has been found to
exploit an official capacity or government policy to force
Hasegawa or anyone else to make any decision regarding anything
during the banquet, in which Minister of Economic Affairs Steven
R. L. Chen and Liberty Times representatives were also present.
</P>
<P>
"It is apparent that Fuji TV was not been affected by Cheng as it
sold its holding of TTV shares to a private company,"  Tsai
pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Fielding  questions  from  opposition  lawmakers  during  a
question-and-answer session earlier the same day in the
Legislative Yuan, Su denied that he was aware of the Jan. 17
banquet beforehand, and ruled out allegations that he gave Cheng
a free hand to handle the TTV shares case saying that he did not
instruct Cheng to host the banquet.
</P>
<P>
Su said that he has read through a report made by the Executive
Yuan on the controversy and stressed that he will render a fair
judgment after acquiring a full understanding of the event.
