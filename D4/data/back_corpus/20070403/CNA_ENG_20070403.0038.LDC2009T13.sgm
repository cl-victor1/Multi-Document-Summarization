FORMER TAIPEI MAYOR KNEW FUNDS WERE PUBLIC: PROSECUTOR
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taipei,  April 3 (CNA) 04/03/07  21:22:11 (By Lilian Wu)
</P>
<P>
The prosecutor who indicted former Taipei mayor Ma Ying-jeou on
embezzlement charges said Tuesday that Ma admitted knowing, while
being arraigned, that the "special allowance fund" for the local
government head is a "public fund."
</P>
<P>
Prosecutor Hou Kuan-jen made the remarks after the first court
hearing of Ma's corruption trial ended at the Taipei District
Court after three hours.
</P>
<P>
Outside the court, scores of Ma's supporters and opponents
clashed as policemen tried to separate them, with some cheering
Ma on while others derided him.
</P>
<P>
Ma said during the court hearing that he always thought that half
of the "special allowance fund" went directly to his bank
accounts required only receipts for reimbursement and were not
"public fund, " but a personal subsidy extended to local
government heads, to which he, well as to more than 6,000 ranking
officials around the nation, was entitled.
</P>
<P>
But Hou noted that when first arraigned last November 14, Ma did
admit that the special allowance was a "public fund" that should
be used for official duties.
</P>
<P>
If Ma had any doubts about this point, he should ask the panel of
judges at the Taipei District Court for a video tape of the
arraignment.
</P>
<P>
Presiding judge Tsai Shou-shun asked Ma and Yu Wen, a secretary
of the Taipei City government and another defendant in the case,
how they pleaded. Ma said that he had no intention to do anything
illegal as the prosecution alleged, while Yu pleaded not guilty.
</P>
<P>
Ma contested that Prosecutor Hou did not go deep enough to learn
the nature of "special allowance fund," saying that whether the
money is properly defined as public funds or a private subsidy is
not yet unequivocally clear, that this point is important to
reaching a conclusion as to the question of his alleged
corruption, and that the lack of clarity constitutes a "major
flaw" on the part of Prosecutor Hou.
</P>
<P>
Ma said that during his two terms as mayor between 1998 and 2006,
he executed numerous budgets amounting to more than NT$260
billion, and he couldn't possibly know the details of each budget
project.
</P>
<P>
He noted that he had never handled the reimbursement of the
"special allowance fund, " which was left for the cashiers at the
Taipei City Government.
</P>
<P>
He was never told to deplete the fund or return the unused
portion, and that before the probe on the case, he had never read
related interpretations concerning the use of the "special
allowance fund." He was "completely in the dark about the fund
use, " and had not "deliberately" embezzled the fund as alleged
by the prosecution.
</P>
<P>
Ma also said that during his public service over the past two
decades, he had donated NT$68 million to public charity, far
exceeding the amount the prosecution believes he has embezzled.
</P>
<P>
The Global Views Weekly, a prestigious magazine in Taiwan, rated
him as the No. 1 local government chief in terms of integrity in
assessing the city and county chiefs in Taiwan, Ma said, adding
that he has been proud of his clean record.
</P>
<P>
Presiding judge Tsai Shou-shun set the next court hearing for
April 17.
</P>
<P>
Ma was indicted Feb. 13 on charges of embezzling NT$11.17 million
(US$338,500) from a special allowance fund designated for his
discretionary use while he served as Taipei mayor from 1998 to
2006.
</P>
<P>
Prosecutor Hou said in the indictment that Ma received NT$10.23
million in special allowances during his first term of office,
December 1998-December 2003.
</P>
<P>
However, expenditure records from Ma's bank accounts show that he
spent only NT$3.49 million of that amount and failed to return
the unspent portion -- NT$6.74 million -- to the national
coffers, Hou continued.
</P>
<P>
From January 2004 through July 2006, Ma used NT$630,000 of the
NT$5.06 million fund and kept the remaining NT$4.43 million in
his account.
</P>
<P>
Hou contends that the unspent money during his two terms,
totaling NT$11.17 million, should be considered "gains from
embezzlement."
