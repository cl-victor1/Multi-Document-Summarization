Taiwan has topped all other East Asian countries in the patent
award ranking, according to statistics released Tuesday by the
Council for Economic Planning and Development (CEPD).

The statistics show that between 2000 and 2004, Taiwan recorded
an average ratio of 30.17 patents per 100,000 population -- the
highest among all East Asian countries.

CEPD officials pointed out that Taiwan's average has surpassed
Japan's 28.54 patents per 100,000 population, Singapore's 9.87,
South Korea's 8.67, and is following closely behind the average
of 33.56 for the United States.

Statistics also show that in 2004 Taiwan's expenditures on
research and development accounted for 2.44 percent of the
nation's gross domestic product -- behind only Japan and South
Korea, but ahead of Singapore.

The officials said these figures prove that Taiwan has been
playing an important role as a leading supplier of innovative
technology in East Asia's production chain and economic
development.
