Taipei,  April  2 (CNA) 04/03/07  10:46:25 (By Y.C. Jou)

<P>
A draft constitution which names the country Taiwan and adopts a
parliamentary system of the government has been signed by 75
lawmakers and will be proposed to the legislature Tuesday, a
civil society group that initiated the draft announced Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Constitution Reform Alliance held a news conference to unveil
the draft constitution that defines the country's territory asthe
area to which the Constitution is applied.
</P>
<P>
The alliance said such a provision contains the concept of
'existing national boundaries', a phrase in the Constitution of
the Republic of China, and is in line with existing conditions.
</P>
<P>
The draft offers no definition of the national flag as the
current ROC Constitution does, stipulating that it be defined by
statue.
</P>
<P>
According to the draft, the president of Taiwan is a nominal head
of state elected by a presidential recommendation committee and
serving a five-year term.
</P>
<P>
The highest executive body of the state will be the Cabinet, the
draft says, with the premier elected by members of the lower
house of the parliament and formally appointed by the president.
</P>
<P>
Given the support of one-third its members, the lower house can
put forward a motion of non-confidence against the Cabinet six
months after the latter's formation, the draft says.
</P>
<P>
While the lower house stands as the major body that represents
the citizens' sovereignty, a senate is elected by local
autonomous bodies and indigenous people to prevent an over-
concentration of power in the lower house, the alliance said.
</P>
<P>
The draft allows for future amendments to the Constitution to be
ratified by a relative majority in a referendum.
</P>
<P>
Hung Yu-hung, General Convener of the alliance, described the
draft asa 100 percent civil society proposalthat had not been
sponsored by any political party.
</P>
<P>
Our next step will be to meet with political and opinion leaders
and make constitutional reform a national movement, Hung said.
</P>
<P>
He  criticized  theSecond  Republicdraft  constitution co-
authored by former Mainland Affairs Council Vice Chairman Chen
Ming-tung and unveiled half a month ago for retaining the General
Provision of the ROC Constitution.
</P>
<P>
Trong R.  Chai,  Acting Chairman of the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party, at the conference said the parliamentary
system mapped out in the draft speaks to the current needs of the
country.
</P>
<P>
The 148-article draft is divided into four chapters: the rights
of the people, the principles of the state and the Constitution,
the relations between the central government and local bodies,
and the enforcement and amendment of the Constitution.
</P>
<P>
Hung said 75 lawmakers, mostly from the DPP and its pan-green
ally, the Taiwan Solidarity Union, will bring up the draft with
the Procedure Committee of the legislature Tuesday, and he called
on the committee not to block it from being discussed.
