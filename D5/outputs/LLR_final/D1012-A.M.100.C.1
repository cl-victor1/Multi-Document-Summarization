Airport officials in Larnaka said the pilot of the airliner reported problems with the air-conditioning system minutes before losing contact with Greek and Cypriot traffic controllers.
Greek fire chief Christos Smetis said there were no survivors among the 115 passengers and six crew on board the plane.
Voutas said his cousin also told him he went to the cockpit to check what was wrong and saw the pilot `` all blackened.
One passenger reportedly sent a text message before the crash to say that the pilots were unconscious and `` we are all frozen.
