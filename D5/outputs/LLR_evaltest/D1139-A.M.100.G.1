The U. S. Navy said the MV Sirius Star was seized far off the coast of Kenya on Saturday and that the bandits were taking the ship to a Somali port known as a hub of pirate activity.
The owner of a Saudi oil supertanker hijacked by Somali pirates over the weekend says the 25 crew are safe and that ship is fully loaded with crude.
Somalia has lacked an effective government since the 1991 ouster of president Mohamed Siad Barre touched off a bloody power struggle that has defied numerous attempts to restore stability.
