Thirty-two people were killed and at least 15 injured in two shooting attacks at Virginia Tech on Monday during three hours of horror and chaos on this sprawling southwestern Virginia campus.
Tech reported a campus shooting Monday and told students to stay inside their residences and away from windows.
U. S. media said there are a total of students in Tech and about half are from India and China.
