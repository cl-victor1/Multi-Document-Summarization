Severe drought has had a debilitating effect on the Yangtze River , China 's longest waterway , over the last two weeks , leaving at least 1 million people in Chongqing Municipality with water shortages , local water authorities said on Monday .
There was enough water in Beijing to adequately supply just over 14 million people in 2005 , but the city had 15 million permanent residents and four million migrant workers at the end of last year , Xinhua said recently .
A spokesman of Shapingba Waterworks , one of the largest drinking water suppliers in the city center , told Xinhua that only one of its 10 pipes used to pump water from the Yangtze was still below the water surface and in operation - and that is only 10 cm below the water level .
