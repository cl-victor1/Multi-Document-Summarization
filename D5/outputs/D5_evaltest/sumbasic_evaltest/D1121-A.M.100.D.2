Vick and the two other co-defendants in his case also pleaded not guilty Thursday .
Taylor electrocuted one dog in 2002 .
A spokesman for Vick also declined to comment .
That owner is one of four cooperating witnesses cited in the document .
Although the statement said several dogs were killed , it did not say that Vick killed any of them .
The indictment also says Vick and the others bet on the dogfights .
I can think of a few things Vick could do other than torturing dogs that would make himself and the NFL look worse .
About 40 people began queuing for a seat in the courtroom or an overflow courtroom .
