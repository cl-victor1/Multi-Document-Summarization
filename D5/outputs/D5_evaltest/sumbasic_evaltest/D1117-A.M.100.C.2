An Army sergeant who oversees the management of Building 18 said three requests for service were made to repair Duncan 's room -- one in November , one in January , and one last week -- but nothing happened .
Winkenwerder said the group would report back to the Pentagon in a `` short time frame . ''
`` We need to bring the Army people in and say , ` What the hell is going on ? '' '
`` Some of these people are not on our list and are not coming in , '' announced Lori Calvillo , Walter Reed 's chief spokeswoman .
`` The problem is much more serious than one building , '' she said in an interview .
