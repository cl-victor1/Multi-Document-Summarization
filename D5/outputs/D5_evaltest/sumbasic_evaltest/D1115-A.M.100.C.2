Jung Se-hi , a spokesman at Coast Guard headquarters in Incheon , 40 kilometers ( 25 miles ) west of Seoul , said the clean up operation would likely take at least three or four days .
The tanker was carrying 1.8 million barrels of crude oil .
Another ministry official said that spills from two containers were stopped about three hours after the collision , but oil was still leaking from the third container .
The July 1995 leak caused damage estimated at 73.5 billion won , at today 's exchange rates equal to US $ 80 million ( euro55 million ) .
Kim said that some of the spilled oil had been collected , though he could not say how much .
