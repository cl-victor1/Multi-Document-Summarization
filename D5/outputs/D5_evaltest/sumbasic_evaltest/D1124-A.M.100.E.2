A gas well operated by Lapindo Brantas Inc. has spewed steaming mud since May last year , submerging villages and forcing some 13,000 people to flee their homes .
An area of at least 10 square kilometers ( 3.9 square miles ) around the volcano will be uninhabitable for years , and over 11,000 people will be permanently displaced , it says .
In December last year , Indonesian President Susilo said Lapindo would pay 420 millions U.S. dollars to victims and make efforts to stop the flow of the mud .
Bakrie also said the mud , which has forced 13,000 people to flee and continues to spread , was not toxic and could be dumped in the sea without concern .
