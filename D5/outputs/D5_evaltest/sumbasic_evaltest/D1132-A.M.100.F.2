It was the first time the turtle species was found in Thailand in two decades , the WWF said .
`` They are from the same area , I think also from the same syndicate , '' said Mohamad Yusoff of the two groups .
He said four of the 19 were sent back to China , but the remaining fishermen would appear before the court on Friday .
There have been reports of turtle deaths before , but not as many as this year , he said .
`` Normally , turtles caught like this would have been eaten by the local people , '' Songpol said .
