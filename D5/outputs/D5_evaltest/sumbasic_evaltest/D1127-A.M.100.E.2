A study at the University of Chicago found that participants who slept only four hours a night for two nights had an 18 percent decrease in leptin and a 28 percent increase in ghrelin .
They surveyed the patients about sleep problems and found that 69 percent of the patients had at least one sleep complaint , and 40 percent had two or more .
In fact , a recent study found that among older people with exceptionally good health , only 1 percent had sleep difficulties .
She says about a third of Americans complain about sleep problems and around 10 percent ( 30 million Americans ) have serious sleep problems .
