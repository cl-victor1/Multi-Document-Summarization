`` I did n't feel the least threatened by it , '' Bush also said , adding that `` it does n't bother me '' before he and Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki leave the conference room .
`` All I can report , '' Bush joked of the incident , `` is a size 10 . ''
He called the increased deployment of U.S. troops in Iraq last year , a strategy known as the surge , which is credited with helping reduce violence here , `` one of the greatest successes in the history of the United States military . ''
`` What do you think your own reaction would have been five years ago had you been told that toward the end of your term he would still be at large with that kind of capability , from Iraq no less ? ''
