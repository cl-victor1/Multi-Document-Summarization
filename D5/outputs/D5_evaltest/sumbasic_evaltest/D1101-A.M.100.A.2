Two hours after the shooting , about three dozen people in traditional Amish clothing , hats and bonnets stood near the small school building speaking to one another , several young people and authorities .
Roberts killed himself as police stormed the building .
Roberts left one note for his wife , one for each of his three children and a note and checklist in his truck , Miller said .
No one answered the door at the Roberts ' home Monday .
Investigators also said they were looking into the possibility the attack may have been related to the death of one of Roberts ' own children .
He had delivered milk for at least seven years , one neighbor said .
