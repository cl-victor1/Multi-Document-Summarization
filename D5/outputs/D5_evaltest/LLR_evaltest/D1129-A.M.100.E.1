Two new vitamin D studies have revealed new prescriptions for possibly preventing up to half  cases  breast cancer and two-thirds  cases  cancer in the United States.
It is the first such study to look at satellite measurements of sunshine and cloud cover in countries where actual blood serum levels of vitamin D3 had also been determined.
000 to 2,000 international units of vitamin D supplements daily would create a blood level of at least 33 ng/ml.
