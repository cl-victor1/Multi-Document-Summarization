Cities across India have been bombed repeatedly in recent years and analysts say Islamic extremist groups are attempting to stoke sectarian tensions to derail a peace process with Pakistan and damage India's booming economy.
But Indian authorities have blamed groups for a spate of bombings that have killed nearly 400 people in this predominantly Hindu country of people since 2005.
Kataria had initially put the death toll at 80 and 200 injured while the Press Trust of India reported toll of 85 dead.
