Three people were still listed as missing Sunday as rescue teams picked through the rubble of a town house crushed by a toppling construction crane in an accident that killed four construction workers.
City Building Department records show that a caller told officials March 4 that the upper portions of crane appeared to lack the proper number of safety ties attaching it to the building.
Mayor Michael Bloomberg said people have died and people were injured in one of the city's worst construction accidents in recent memory.
