The attack came after a near two-week breach of the border between Egypt and the Gaza Strip which saw hundreds of thousands of people pouring into Egypt from the impoverished Hamas-run territory in a bid to break a crippling Israeli siege.
Shin Bet chief Yuval Diskin stated during a cabinet security briefing on Sunday that considerable amounts of high quality weaponry have been smuggled into Gaza through border with Egypt along the Philadelphi route.
