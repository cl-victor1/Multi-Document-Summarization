The US Defense Department said Tuesday it is reviewing the way wounded service members are cared for at military hospitals following disclosures of shocking bureaucratic neglect .

`` There 's plenty of outrage , '' said White House spokesman Tony Snow , responding to a Washington Post report citing bitter complaints from veterans at Walter Reed Army Medical Center outside Washington .

But he said the army was carrying out an investigation of conditions at the hospital and that there should be no doubt about President George W. Bush 's commitment to veterans .

`` The men and the women who have gone and fought for our country over there , they deserve the best care , '' Snow said .
