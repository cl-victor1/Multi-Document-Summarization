CITES

Pink coral , cedar trees , types of fish eaten in Europe and a cuddly , wide-eyed mammal that is prized in Asian medicine are among the animal and plant species that could gain greater protection this year , a UN agency said Wednesday .

The United Nations agency regulating the trade in endangered species , CITES , unveiled some 40 new government proposals for changes to wildlife trade rules which will be considered at the organisation 's conference in June .

The agency said many of the proposals reflected growing international concern about the accelerating destruction of the world 's marine and forest resources through overfishing and excessive logging .
