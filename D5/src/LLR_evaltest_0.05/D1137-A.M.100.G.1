Three people were still listed as missing Sunday as rescue teams picked through the rubble of a town house crushed by a toppling construction crane in an accident that killed four construction workers .
City Building Department records show that a caller told officials March 4 that the upper portions of the crane appeared to lack the proper number of safety ties attaching it to the building .
Mayor Michael Bloomberg said at least four people have died and at least 10 people were injured in one of the city 's worst construction accidents in recent memory .
