Hadi Siswanto said that rescue boats were picking up scores of bloated bodies on Monday that had so far been left in the sea because officials were concentrating their search for survivors .
Bad weather on Tuesday prevented search aircraft from looking for more survivors from an Indonesian ferry that sank in stormy weather as 400 people remained missing days after the disaster .
Head of the search and rescue mission Jan Simamora said that high winds and poor visibility had prevented helicopters and search planes from taking to the air on Tuesday .
