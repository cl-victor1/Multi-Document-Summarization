Two new vitamin D studies have revealed new prescriptions for possibly preventing up to half of the cases of breast cancer and two-thirds of the cases of colorectal cancer in the United States .
It is the first such study to look at satellite measurements of sunshine and cloud cover in countries where actual blood serum levels of vitamin D3 had also been determined .
The study estimated that taking 1,000 to 2,000 international units of vitamin D supplements daily would create a blood level of at least 33 ng/ml .
