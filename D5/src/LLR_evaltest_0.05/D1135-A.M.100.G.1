New Jersey U.S. Sen. Frank Lautenberg is on the growing list of potential victims of what prosecutors are calling a multibillion- dollar fraud scheme run by New York money manager Bernard Madoff .
A British investment fund that counted itself a client of alleged Wall Street fraudster Bernard Madoff criticised the `` systemic failure '' of regulators in the United States on Sunday .
Madoff is alleged to have lost 50 billion dollars in a giant pyramid scheme that collapsed in the global financial crisis and top European banks are reported to be clients .
