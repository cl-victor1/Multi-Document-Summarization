The Debra LaFave saga ended in March 2006 when Marion County prosecutors dropped all charges against the teacher.
The outcome negated the decision of Marion County Judge Stancil, who felt prison would be appropriate for LaFave.
The prosecutors concluded that the emotional welfare and privacy of the 14-year old victim was more important.
Media attention motivated the victim's mother to seek such a decision.
She was approached by Matt Lauer and Nancy Grace, the British tabloid News of the World wrote of the "school miss".
LaFave divorced but engaged to a new adult boyfriend and working as a waitress.
