There was much fallout from the VIOXX controversy.
Merck shares plunged, lawsuits were expected to exceed 12 billion and its successor drug Arcoxia, sold in 48 countries worldwide, was given greater scrutiny.
Other drug companies rushed to fill the VIOXX vacuum but people were calling for greater review of such drugs.
The British journal Lancet claimed VIOXX should have been withdrawn much earlier.
An FDA drug safety reviewer, who had earlier warned against the drug, was demeaned by his agency.
The FDA said it would strengthen its system for reviewing drug safety and would appoint a special drug safety director.
