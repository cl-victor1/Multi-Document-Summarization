In 2005, conservationists in Sri Lanka discovered thirty-five new species of frogs but also determined that nineteen species had died out.
Diminishment of other species continued, such as the harlequin frog and the golden toad in Central and South America, and the mountain yellow-legged frog in California.
Part of this loss of biodiversity has been blamed on global warming's impact on the deadly chytrid fungus, which grows on frogs' skin.
Other waterborne dangers encountered by frogs are the chemical DEET used in insect repellents, fluoxetine which is the active ingredient in Prozac, and carbamazepine which is an anti-epilectic drug.
