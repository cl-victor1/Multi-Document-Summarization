Two weeks after the killing of Rafik Hariri, the Lebanese Parliament was to vote on a no-confidence motion against the incumbent pro-Syrian government.
This was avoided by the subsequent resignation of Prime Minister Karami and his government.
However, ten days later, Karami's government was returned to power.
A U.N. team investigating the murder completed their assignment on 16 March, the later report in New York stating another independent investigation was needed inasmuch as there was a lack of commitment by Lebanese authorities to solve the crime.
Hariri's family announced his son, Saad, would undertake his father's role.
