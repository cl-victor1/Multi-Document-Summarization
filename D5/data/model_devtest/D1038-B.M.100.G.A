On 4 October 2005 there were two instances of steam arising from Mount Saint Helens, this followed next day when thousands of tourists were delighted by another burst of steam and ash but with subsequent lessening of large earthquake activity.
The U.S. Geologic Survey anticipated that underground molten rock termed magma would continue to rise and announced the area should get used to living with an active volcano.
However, on 6 October, that agency stated an eruption was not imminent, disappointing the thousands of tourists hoping to witness an eruption similar to the 1986 event.
