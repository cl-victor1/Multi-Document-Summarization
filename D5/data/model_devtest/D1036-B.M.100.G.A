Theories abound surrounding Yushchenko's poisoning.
Some questioned Russia's involvement because Putin favored Yushchenko's opponent and Yushchenko himself suggested that the dioxin came from outside Ukraine.
Toxicologists questioned the dinner theory, noting it usually takes at least three days for symptoms to appear.
Another scientist believed the poisoning happened in August and suspected a crime figure in the Crimea.
French toxicologists wondered why dioxin was used because it is a slow killer.
Ukraine physicians felt that dioxin would not cause Yushchenko's symptoms.
Yushchenko wanted courts to decide ultimate responsibility but declined to talk to an investigative committee.
