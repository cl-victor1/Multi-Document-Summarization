A military judge declared a mistrial in the court-martial of Pfc Lynndie England and dismissed the jury.
The judge stopped the trial after Charles Graner testified that he had ordered England to pose for the pictures, which he claimed were for legitimate training purposes.
The judge rejected England's guilty plea, telling her, "If you don't believe you're guilty and you honestly believe you were doing what Graner told you to do, you can't plead guilty." The case will go back to Fort Hood's commander to determine how to proceed.
