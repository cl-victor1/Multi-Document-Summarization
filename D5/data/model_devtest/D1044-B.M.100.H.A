Subsequent to the Sudan I scare in Britain, China reported finding the offending red dye in pepper sauce produced by a Heinz subsidiary, the sauce also used in other food products.
All KFC outlets in China stopped sellings wings and hamburgers accompanied by the pepper sauce.
KFC then announced it would invest in a Chinese food safety center to prevent similar health scares.
Another fast food giant, McDonalds, withdrew some products in Britain which were served with sauce.
The offending supplier in Britain, Premier Foods, intended to satisfy any claims against them but did not expect to lose money.
