MAKING TAIWAN NORMAL COUNTRY COMMON DESIRE OF DPP SUPPORTERS:
CHAIR

Taipei,  May 11 (CNA) 05/11/07  23:30:30 (By Flor Wang)

Ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) Chairman Yu Shyi-kun
said Friday that he will push for the party to pass a resolution
on making Taiwan a normal country, which he said is a common
desire of the supporters of the DPP-led "pan- green camp"
</P>
<P>
Yu made the remarks while attending the opening of a local branch
of the 908 Taiwan Republic Campaign in Changhua County, central
Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the ceremony, Yu said that he will continue broaching
the resolution despite his defeat in the DPP's May 6 presidential
primary vote because "Taiwan is still not a normal country,
although it is an independent sovereignty."
</P>
<P>
According to Yu, the country must alter its official designation,
create a new constitution and join the United Nations under the
name of "Taiwan" if it wants to become a normal country.
</P>
<P>
To achieve these aims, he said, the DPP must win the coming
legislative and presidential elections slated for December 2007
and March 2008, respectively.
</P>
<P>
Yu promoted a resolution on making Taiwan a normal country during
his campaign prior to the DPP's May 6 presidential primary, in
which he finished distant third among four hopefuls in a vote by
party members.
</P>
<P>
Former Premier Frank Hsieh outgunned the three other hopefuls
that also included Vice President  Annette Lu and Premier Su
Tseng-chang, in the party election.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the selection of Hsieh's running mate for the 2008
presidential race, Yu said that Hsieh's opinion must be fully
respected. However, he also said that if invited by Hsieh, he
would turn the offer down and leave the opportunity to someone
else.
