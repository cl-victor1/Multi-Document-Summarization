Taipei, May 11 (CNA) 05/11/07  21:40:13 (By Han Nai-kuo)

The legislature passed on the third reading Friday a bill that
provides for the establishment of a security fund for police,
firefighters and other law enforcement officers and emergency
workers.
</P>
<P>
The bill will allow the government to earmark NT$1 billion
(US$30.4 million) over 10 years for the fund to help police,
firefighters, Coast Guard Administration officers, emergency
workers and volunteers injured while carrying out official
duties, as well as to assist the families of law enforcement
officers and emergency workers who die on the job.
</P>
<P>
The legislation will also provide for the establishment of a
committee consisting of nine to 13 members to manage the fund and
dispense grants.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan Solidarity Union Legislator Huang Shi-cho, the original
sponsor of the bill, said the establishment of the fund will
allay fears that law enforcement officers, emergency workers or
volunteers may fall into dire financial straits if they become
seriously injured while executing their official duties, as well
as concern that if they die, their families will be left
helpless.
</P>
<P>
Huang said Taiwan's 350,000-strong law enforcement workforce and
their volunteer helpers can now rest assured that whatever
happens, they and their families will be taken care of.
