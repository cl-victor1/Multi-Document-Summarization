MA, WANG LOW-PROFILE ON 'REPLACEMENT' REPORTS
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taipei, May 11 (CNA) 05/11/07  23:12:49 (By Lilian Wu)
</P>
<P>
Both Ma Ying-jeou, presidential candidate of the main opposition
Kuomintang (KMT) , and Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng
were silent Friday on reports that Wang might serve as Ma's
replacement should the latter be unable to take part in the 2008
presidential election.
</P>
<P>
Ma, who kicked off a 10-day islandwide bike tour in southern
Taiwan to get close to the grassroots Friday, did not answer
questions on reports by the China Times, a local daily, that
quoted Chan Chuen-po, manager of Ma's campaign office, as saying
that if Wang agrees to a ticket with Ma, then he will "naturally
fill Ma's place" should Ma not run in the election.
</P>
<P>
Wang said that "it is not appropriate" for him to talk about the
matter when he was pressed on the reports.
</P>
<P>
The KMT issued a press release later in the day saying that if Ma
is unable to run because of "political persecution, " the KMT,
while respecting Ma's views, will produce a replacement in
accordance with the party's nomination mechanism.
</P>
<P>
The KMT's Organization and Development Committee said in the
press release that the party's presidential candidate will be
produced through strict nomination mechanism that follows a set
procedure and that Chan's views are no more than "his personal
opinion."
</P>
<P>
A KMT legislator close to Ma also said that Ma does not intend to
have Wang serve as his replacement if he is sentenced for
corruption.
</P>
<P>
KMT Legislator Wu Yu-sheng, a protege of Ma, said that Chan's
words did not reflect Ma's real intention.
</P>
<P>
Ma's stance is unequivocal -- he believes he will be acquitted
and that he could not possibly be convicted of corruption, so
that the question of his replacement is moot, according to Wu.
</P>
<P>
Reports have said reasons for Wang's reluctance to clearly give
consent to teaming up with Ma can be traced from a bitter KMT
chairmanship battle between them in 2005, in which Wang was given
a drubbing.
</P>
<P>
Wang's refusal to join the ticket is also said to be related to
Ma's embroilment in the court case, especially after the KMT
announced plans to revise party regulations to let Ma run for
president even if he is a convicted in the first trial. The
planned revision will state that KMT will not nominate any
members as candidates if their conviction is final.
</P>
<P>
The prosecution indicted Ma Feb. 13 for alleged embezzlement of
NT$11.17 million (US$338,500) of a "special allowance fund" for
his discretionary use during his two-term stint as Taipei mayor
1998-2006. Ma has denied any wrongdoing, citing legal counseling
views provided by the Ministry of the Justice in November 2006 to
back his claim that the fund is in nature a "salary subsidy."
</P>
<P>
All executives  holding public office are given a special
allowance fund every month. Although the money is left up to the
administrative chief's discretion, half of the fund can be spent
without any proof of spending, while use of the other half must
be substantiated with receipts.
</P>
<P>
The prosecution said the unspent money during his two terms,
totaling NT$11.17 million that ended up in Ma's personal bank
accounts should be considered "gain from embezzlement."
</P>
<P>
Although taking note of the fact that Ma and his wife donated
tens of millions of dollars to charitable organizations during
his mayoral terms, the prosecution argued that those donations
came mostly from Ma's unspent election campaign subsidies rather
from his special allowance funds.
