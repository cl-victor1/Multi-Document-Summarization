DRUG ABUSE AMONG YOUNGSTERS EXACERBATING HIV SPREAD: EXPERTS
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

Taipei, May 11 (CNA) 05/11/07  19:50:50 (By Han Nai-kuo)
</P>
<P>
Drug addiction among Taiwan's youngsters has become so serious in
the past three years that it has contributed significantly to the
spread of the HIV virus, experts warned Friday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a symposium held by the Taipei Garden of Mercy
Foundation -- a Protestant-run non-profit organization providing
care for AIDS patients -- on how to prevent drug abuse-related
HIV transmission, foundation Chairwoman Chang Li-shu cited
statistics showing that of the 6,000 new HIV carriers who
contracted the disease in the past three years as a result of
drug abuse, 500 are youngsters.
</P>
<P>
She said the spread of drug-related HIV has become so serious
that the government must face this challenge squarely.
</P>
<P>
Fang Chi-tai, an assistant professor at the Department of
Internal Medicine at National Taiwan University Medical School,
pointed out that HIV is most commonly transmitted through sexual
behavior, needle-sharing with an infected drug user, and blood
transfusions, and that an HIV-infected woman can also pass the
virus to her baby before or during childbirth.
</P>
<P>
"In preventing drug addicts from contracting HIV, Taiwan must
also try to prevent young people from falling victim to drug use,
" Fang said.
</P>
<P>
Kuo  Wen-tung,  head  of  the  Department  of  Prevention,
Rehabilitation and Protection under the Ministry of Justice,
noted that seven out of every 10 HIV carriers in Taiwan
contracted the disease because of needle-sharing with infected
intravenous drug users and that their average age has become
increasingly younger.
</P>
<P>
He said the central government and local city and county
governments should form drug hazards prevention and control
centers and declare war on narcotics.
</P>
<P>
Wu Chyi-in, an associate research fellow at Academia Sinica's
Institute of Sociology, presented a study showing that 30.2
percent of third-year junior high school students in Taiwan have
used drugs to cope with depression, compared with 2.5 percent for
first-year students and 7.5 percent for second-year students.
</P>
<P>
Describing pressure from high school entrance examinations as
probably the main reason for their depression, Wu said the
parents of these students should try to understand their
difficulties and help them cope with the pressure, because the
family is the environment most familiar to them and also most
pivotal in helping tiding them over difficulties.
