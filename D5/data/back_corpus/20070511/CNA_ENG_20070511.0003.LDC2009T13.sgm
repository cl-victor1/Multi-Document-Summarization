DPP TO PUSH FOR MAJOR RESOLUTION ON DIRECTION OF THE COUNTRY
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taipei,  May 10 (CNA) 05/11/07  11:27:26 (By Lilian Wu)
</P>
<P>
The ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) will promote a
major resolution underscoring the party's latest stance on the
direction of the nation, DPP Secretary-General Lin Chia-lung said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Lin noted that the party has ruled the nation for seven years,
and it is high time to review the problems it has encountered
over the years.
</P>
<P>
He said that the party will recommend a name list of a team in
charge of drafting the resolution to the DPP Central Standing
Committee for approval when it holds a regular meeting Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The resolution on "building a normal country" is expected to be
discussed at a DPP congress scheduled to take place June 30, Lin
said.
</P>
<P>
He said the party will "adopt an open attitude," and will "listen
to views from all quarters of the party" concerning both the name
and the content of the major resolution.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the party is both "idealistic and pragmatic," he said
that the resolution will seek to arrive at a win-win situation by
identifying the most common views on winning major elections and
the nation's future development.
</P>
<P>
Correlations between the new resolution and the previous similar
resolutions will be widely discussed before reaching a consensus,
Lin said.
</P>
<P>
He was referring to a charter that the DPP passed in a party
congress in 1991, which states that the party's stance is that
"the residents on Taiwan will build a sovereign, independent
Taiwan Republic through self-determination. "
</P>
<P>
But in 1999, the DPP made a drastic change in a bid to woo
middle-of-the-road voters, which later proved to have played a
role in winning the presidential election in 2000 and ending more
than five decades of Kuomintang rule.
</P>
<P>
According to the resolution passed by the DPP in 1999, Taiwan is
already a sovereign, independent country whose name is the
"Republic of China", and any change of the status quo will
require the consent of the 23 million people on Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Some have questioned whether DPP Chairman Yu Shyi-kun's promotion
of a new resolution on "building a normal country, " is intended
to push the party back to the era of the 1991 charter on
Taiwanese independence, but Lin said that "such worries are
unwarranted."
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that others need not to have preset stance and
oversimplify their reading of the party's latest resolution by
dwelling on who they believe it will benefit or undermine.
</P>
<P>
He said that the previous resolutions have adopted "open and
democratic" procedures, and this time the party will follow the
same approach.
</P>
<P>
President Chen Shui-bian has vowed to turn Taiwan into a normal
country, saying that Taiwan has yet to achieve normalization
because its constitution, which was promulgated in China, did not
obtain the approval of the people.
</P>
<P>
He has vowed to give Taiwan people a new constitution that is
"timely, relevant and viable" before he steps down in May 2008.
