OVER HALF TAIPEI CITIZENS WANT SINGLE-VERSION TEXTBOOK, OLYMPIC
TORCH

Taipei,  May 11 (CNA) 05/11/07  20:27:45 (By Elizabeth Hsu)

The majority of Taipei citizens support the city government's
move to make each school use the same textbooks, as well as its
position in favor of the visit of the 2008 Beijing Olympic torch,
city officials said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Wu Ching-ji, chief of the city's Department of Education, and
Sheng Chih-jen, who is in charge of research, development and
evaluation affairs in the city government, made the remarks while
answering questions at the City Council on the two controversial
issues, on which the city government is at odds with the
Executive Yuan.
</P>
<P>
The textbook policy was one of Mayor Hau Lung-bin's election
platforms during his mayoral campaign last year, a policy he
claimed is a response to calls from Taipei citizens who complain
that the existing policy -- whereby teachers can select a variety
of textbooks on the same subject from which to teach -- does
nothing but harm to their children when preparing for academic
examinations as there are no designated texts for them to follow.
</P>
<P>
Citing the results of a recent survey conducted by the city's
Research, Development and Evaluation Commission on the two
issues, Wu said that 63 percent of the respondents support Hau's
textbook policy, while only 11 percent prefer the Ministry of
Education's multiple-text policy.
</P>
<P>
The city government has therefore decided to implement the one-
text policy from Aug. 1, 2008 no matter what the central
government says, Wu said.
</P>
<P>
On the Olympic torch issue, 60.5 percent of the respondents
expressed support for Taiwan serving as a leg of the 2008 torch
relay, while 14.9 percent said they do not want the torch to come
to Taiwan, as China is trying to use the issue to downgrade
Taiwan's status as a sovereign country.
</P>
<P>
A total of 1,042 effective samples were collected for the survey.
</P>
<P>
Sheng said the poll shows that most people in Taipei believe the
torch relay would help expand the capital city's international
image.
