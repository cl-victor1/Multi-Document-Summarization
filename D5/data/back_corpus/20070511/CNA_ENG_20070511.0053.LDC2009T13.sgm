IMD'S REPORT ON TAIWAN'S CELL PHONE RATE INCORRECT: NCC
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taipei,  May  11 (CNA) 05/11/07  23:39:30 (By Ruth Wang)
</P>
<P>
The National Communications Commission announced Friday that a
slide in Taiwan's ranking in the global mobile  phone
competitiveness  rating  reported  by the Swiss International
Institute for Management Development (IMD) results from
misinformation.
</P>
<P>
The IMD's World Competitiveness Yearbook 2007, which evaluates 55
economies around the world, shows Taiwan's ranking in terms of
mobile phone rates has dropped to 49th, with its domestic mobile
phone rate reported as US$0.52 per minute.
</P>
<P>
However, the NCC said the IMD's report was wrong, as Taiwan's
mobile phone rate is US$0.18 per minute, which means its ranking
according to this indicator should be 23rd.
</P>
<P>
The NCC already sent May 9 an e-mail informing the IMD about its
incorrect information, an NCC official said.
</P>
<P>
The IMD confirmed the following day that it had made the mistake
-- the result of incorrect exchange rates -- and said it would
issue a correction, the official said.
