The Formosa Cancer Foundation called on Taiwanese women Friday to
get into the habit of regularly performing breast self-
examinations to check for possible signs of breast cancer.
</P>
<P>
While breast cancer has seen the highest incidence and mortality
rates among the country's women, the results of a recent survey
of 4,000 women conducted by the foundation indicates that only 37
percent of respondents were aware that women should start
performing regular self-exams after reaching the age of 18.
</P>
<P>
The survey found that 21 percent of respondents held the serious
misconception that women need only start performing self-exams
after giving birth, and another 11 percent thought they only need
to do so after menopause.
</P>
<P>
Only 11 percent of the respondents perform breast self-exams
every month, and only 14 percent of those over 35 years of age
undertook annual checkups at medical institutions, according to
the survey.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the survey shows that there are six common myths about
breast cancer among women in Taiwan, with 42 percent to 55
percent of the respondents believing that breast cancer patients
cannot breast feed, that most breast cancer cases are related to
hereditary factors, that breast cancer patients are doomed to
die, that women with the cancer cannot have children, that
patients must have their breasts  removed completely  and that
they cannot have sexual intercourse.
