Taipei,  May  11  (CNA) 05/11/07  16:41:07 (By Luis Huang)

<P>
Vice President Annette Lu called for diversified development of
Taiwan's tourism industry Friday, saying that the sector's future
development should highlight "health, medical treatment and
culture."
</P>
<P>
Lu made the remarks while addressing a 2007 international seminar
on Taiwan's tourism development trends and marketing held at
Kainan University, with around 100 experts and academics
participating.
</P>
<P>
Lu said that following the devastating Sept. 21, 1999 earthquake,
she took the initiative to push for the establishment of a
tourism industrial alliance in Central Taiwan, and that through
her strenuous efforts various measures aimed at promoting tourism
in southern Taiwan and the Penghu Islands, including issuance of
tourist passes, were implemented smoothly.
</P>
<P>
According to official statistics, Lu pointed out, around 1.30
million foreign tourists visited Taiwan last year, with Japanese
tourists topping the list (1.16 million persons) , followed by
those from Hong Kong and Macau (430.000 persons) , the United
States (395,000 persons) , Korea (196,000 persons) , Singapore
(185,000 persons), and Europe (176,000 persons).
</P>
<P>
As to the issue concerning the degree of Taiwan's opening to
Chinese tourists, Lu called for the domestic tourism sector not
to blame the government for the current deadlock in cross-Taiwan
Strait negotiations, saying that the Beijing authorities have
spared no efforts to launch united front tactics against Taiwan
by taking advantage of the issue of sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
However, the vice president said that quality Chinese tourists
are welcome to visit Taiwan, voicing the hope that the government
will seek to integrate the efforts of domestic medical and
tourism sectors to jointly promote so-called "medical tourism" in
order to bring happiness, health and beauty to incoming tourists.
</P>
<P>
Lu also called for domestic travel agents to arrange more
Taiwanese native culture-exploring tours for foreign tourists so
that they  can gain a better understanding  of Taiwan's  cultural
development.
