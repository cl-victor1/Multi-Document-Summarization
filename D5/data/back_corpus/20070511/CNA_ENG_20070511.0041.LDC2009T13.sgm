Ma Ying-jeou, former chairman of the main opposition Kuomintang
(KMT), embarked on a 10-day bicycle trip Friday that will take
him from the south of the country to the north, according to Ma's
presidential campaign office.
</P>
<P>
Ma encouraged members of the public interested in bicycling to
"accompany" him on the journey during their free time and
expressed his hope that the trip will also allow him to gain a
better understanding of the opinions and livelihoods of the
Taiwanese people.
</P>
<P>
Ma will start his bicycle journey from Oluangpi, the Taiwan
Island's southernmost tip in Pingtung County, and is slated to
conclude his trip May 20 in Fugui Cape Harbor, in Taipei County,
Taiwan proper's northernmost point. During the 637km trip, Ma
will pass through 18 cities and countries on the west coast.

<P>
The public is welcome to visit a Website that will publish
segments   of   Ma's daily   travels,   at   http:

</P>
<P>
Ma, who stepped down from the KMT chairmanship in mid-February
and won the KMT's presidential nomination for the 2008 election
early this month, is keenly pursuing the presidency.
