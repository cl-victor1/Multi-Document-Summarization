U.S. MEDICAL ASSOCIATION BACKS TAIWAN'S WHO BID
</HEADLINE>

Washington,  May 5 (CNA) 05/06/07  17:14:04 (By Jorge Liu and

The Medical Society of Delaware (MSD) in the United States sent a
letter May 3 World Health Organization (WHO) Director-General
Margaret Chan, urging her to support Taiwan's bid to join the
international health body.
</P>
<P>
MSD President Janice E. Tildon-Burton said in her letter that
Taiwan has done everything possible in its bids for WHO
membership over the past years, but all its efforts have been in
vain.
</P>
<P>
The world health regulatory body's exclusion of Taiwan has not
only been unfair to the 23 million people of Taiwan, but has also
violated WHO founding objectives, the MSD head stressed.
</P>
<P>
The MSD head continued that, boasting the world's most advanced
public  health system,  Taiwan has actively  participated  in
international humanitarian assistance efforts, and as such should
be admitted into the WHO.
</P>
<P>
Founded in Newark, Delaware, the MSD is the third oldest society
of its kind in the United States.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan has sought to join the World Health Assembly (WHA) , the
WHO's decision- making arm, as an observer since 1997, but has
seen little progress due to China's obstruction. At the WHA
gathering last year, Taiwan's hopes of joining the organization
were dashed for the 10th consecutive year when the WHA General
Committee decided not to include Taiwan's bid on the assembly's
agenda.
</P>
<P>
This year, Taiwan decided to apply for full WHO membership under
the name of "Taiwan, " in addition to continuing pursuit of WHA
observership. The annual WHA conference is scheduled to open May
14 in Geneva.
