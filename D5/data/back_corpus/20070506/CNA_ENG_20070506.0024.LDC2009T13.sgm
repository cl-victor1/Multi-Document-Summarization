Taipei,  May  6  (CNA) 05/06/07  20:22:40 (By Han Nai-kuo)

Eight witnesses from Taiwan and China testified at an
international symposium in Taipei Sunday on how they or their
family members had suffered during World War II under Japan's
practice of forcing foreign women into sex slavery and able-
bodied men into slave labor.
</P>
<P>
The symposium was held by National Taiwan University's College of
Social Sciences, with the participation of 12 scholars from
Taiwan and Japan, and two Taiwanese legislators.
</P>
<P>
The witnesses included former comfort woman Wan Ai-hua, rape
victim Lu Man-mei, Hanaoka labor camp survivor Li Tietsui, and a
former slave laborer at the Mitsubishi coal mine in Nagasaki
Prefecture, Li Tsingyun.
</P>
<P>
In additional to the Taiwanese academics who presented papers and
joined the discussions, six Japanese scholars and experts also
presented evidence collected in Japan to the symposium in an
attempt to tackle various aspects of the issues.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese participants included Ryukoku University Professor
Hiroshi Tanaka, who has conducted research in China since the
1980s on victims of forced labor during the Second World War;
Tsueno Yachida, a deputy head of a committee for the
establishment of a peace memorial for the Hanaoka Incident of
1945; Okayama University professor Toneko Ishida; and Japanese
lawyer Reiji Kiyoi.
</P>
<P>
A report by Japanese scholars has put the number of Chinese
forced to work in Japan's slave camps during the war at 39,000,
accounting for 13.5 percent of all Chinese workers used by Japan
during the war years. The report claims that, of the total, more
than 6,800 died in Japan.
</P>
<P>
However, an investigation by the late professor Wu Tianwei of
Southern Illinois University says that since 1931, about 37
million Chinese were force into slave labor by the Japanese
military, and that 10 million of them perished as a result,
including many who were killed collectively.
</P>
<P>
Chinese nationals, including survivors of the Hanaoka labor camp,
had filed lawsuits against the Japanese government since the
1900s, demanding compensation for their wartime suffering.
</P>
<P>
Of the more than 800 Chinese laborers forced to work at the
Hanaoka copper mine, located 525 kilometers north of Tokyo, 418
died of malnutrition and torture. The slave workers staged an
uprising on June 30, 1945 and killed several Japanese guards.
Scores of them were held responsible for the incident and
tortured to death.
</P>
<P>
A Japanese Supreme Court ruled on April 27 that the 1972 Japan-
China Joint Communique made it legally impossible for Chinese
nationals to seek compensation for their suffering at the hands
of the Japanese military.
