PREMIER WITHDRAWS FROM DPP PRESIDENTIAL PRIMARY
</HEADLINE>

Taipei, May  6  (CNA) 05/06/07  22:36:40 (By Han Nai-kuo)
</P>
<P>
Premier Su Tseng-chang announced Sunday evening that he has
decided to withdraw from the presidential primary of the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) for the sake of party unity.
</P>
<P>
Su, accompanied by his wife and aides, made the surprise
announcement at his campaign office when the ballot counting for
the intra-party voting was only half way through.
</P>
<P>
He said he will back up whoever emerges from the party primary as
the DPP nominee for the 2008 presidential race, because for the
DPP's future and that of Taiwan, the party must win the election.
</P>
<P>
The three other DPP bigwigs who were competing in the party
primary are Vice President Annette Lu, DPP Chairman Yu Shyh-kun
and former Premier Frank Hsieh.
</P>
<P>
The ballots cast by DPP members Sunday only account for 30
percent in determining the approval ratings of the candidates,
with the remaining 70 percent decided by an opinion poll to be
conducted May 9-11.
</P>
<P>
A total of 254,000 DPP members were elegible for the vote Sunday,
but only 56.06 percent of them turned out to vote.
</P>
<P>
The final results showed that Su, who received 47,000 votes,
lagged behind the front runner, Hsieh, by 16,000 votes.
</P>
<P>
There was speculation that Su quit the race because of the gap
between him and his major opponent in the first round of the
primary, but it is still unclear what really prompted him his
withdrawal, as he still has a chance of winning the primary
through the opinion survey.
</P>
<P>
Su and Hsieh were engaged in fierce bickerings in the past few
days over who leaked a confidential document by a public
prosecutor that has accused Hsieh of corruption while he served
as Kaohsiung mayor.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the vice president complained that the DPP primary was
unfair from the very beginning because the government
administration and the party, as well as news media "failed to
remain neutral."
</P>
<P>
Lu said she was "speaking her conscience" and would not care
whether she would win the party nomination or not.
</P>
<P>
She also said she has no intention to run in the 2008 election as
an independent even if she has lost in the party primary.
</P>
<P>
Also speaking at the end of the vote count, the DPP chairman, who
received only 3,010 votes, said he will cease all campaign
activities immediately and respect the decision of the DPP
members.
</P>
<P>
Yu pledged he will do his best to help the party's presidential
nominee to win the 2008 election.
