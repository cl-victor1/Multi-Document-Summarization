Manufacturers in Taiwan's industrial parks said their most urgent
problem in need of being addressed is the shortage of laborers,
the latest survey of the Manufacturer's United General
Association of Industrial Park of R.O.C. (MUGA) showed Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Manufacturers expressed hope that the government will open the
way for Chinese laborers  to come to Taiwan and ease quota
restrictions on foreign laborers.
</P>
<P>
New MUGA President Hong Yu-nan said an analysis of questionnaires
distributed among manufacturers in 68 industrial parks around the
country showed that the labor shortage is the top problem faced
by manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
In the manufacturers' list of top five concerns, this was
followed by upgrading of industrial parks, improving government
efficiency, a speedy opening of direct cross-strait trade and
transportation links, and assistance in extending loans to small-
and medium-sized enterprises, Hong said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that Taiwan's labor force has gradually shifted to the
information- based service sector, and that it is difficult now
to find hands willing to take on difficult labor tasks.
</P>
<P>
Gaps between industrial and scientific parks should also be
addressed, Hong said.
</P>
<P>
With more than 14,000 traditional manufacturers in the industrial
parks employing than 1.68 million laborers, Hong said, the MUGA
sees itself as a leader of the traditional industrial sector.
</P>
<P>
He noted that government attaches importance to the views of the
three big local industrial groups -- Chinese National Federation
of Industries, General Chamber of Commerce of R.O.C. and the
Chinese National Federation of Industries -- all of which are
well established.
</P>
<P>
Members of three other industrial groups -- National Association
of Small and Medium Enterprises R.O.C., Taiwan Federation of
Industry and Taiwan Electric and Electronic Manufacturers'
Association -- have interests that overlap with those of other
industrial groups, and their members are not as distinctive as
those in the MUGA, he said.
</P>
<P>
Hong vowed to do more in his two-year term to ensure that the
MUGA will become the seventh largest industrial group in Taiwan,
are that its views will be heard by the government.
