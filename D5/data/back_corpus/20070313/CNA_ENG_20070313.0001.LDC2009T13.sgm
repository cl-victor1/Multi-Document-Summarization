President Chen Shui-bian will meet with the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party's (DPP's) four presidential aspirants again
Tuesday to mediate the party's ticket for the 2008 presidential
election, DPP sources said Monday.

During the first round of talks with the four bigwigs -- Vice
President Annette Lu, Premier Su Tseng-chang, DPP Chairman Yu
Shyi-kun and former Premier Frank Hsieh -- last Friday, President
Chen failed to help them reach a consensus on the issue.

DPP sources said Chen hopes the second round can spawn positive
results because the issue should be resolved the sooner the
better.
