Taipei, March 13 (CNA) 03/13/07  16:37:58 (By Luis Huang)

A total of 50.4 percent of the respondents to a telephone  survey
think that Taiwan  should move toward independence in the future,
according to the results of the survey released Tuesday by the
ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP).
</P>
<P>
The poll was conducted from March 7-8 by the DPP's Public Opinion
Poll Center to explore Taiwan residents' viewpoints on Taiwan's
future. A total of 1,034 valid responses were collected in the
survey, which has a margin of error of 3.1 percent.

<P>
According to the survey results, 33.9 percent of the respondents
said they favor unification of the two sides of the Taiwan
Strait, while 8.1 percent voiced support for maintaining the
cross-strait status quo. The survey question just provided
"independence" and "unification" options. The "status quo" option
was proposed by respondents themselves.
</P>
<P>
The survey shows that 68 percent of those surveyed identify
themselves as Taiwanese, while 16.8 percent identify themselves
as Chinese, and 11.7 percent said they are both Taiwanese and
Chinese.
</P>
<P>
In the public opinion surveys conducted by the DPP over the past
several years, the ratio of those who said Taiwan should march
toward independence has steadily increased,  DPP Secretary-
General Lin Chia-lung said at a news conference held at the
party's headquarters.
</P>
<P>
In terms of party affiliations, 31.7 percent of those interviewed
said they tilt in support of the main opposition Kuomintang, 25.3
percent said they are DPP sympathizers, 2 percent said they
support the People First Party, and 2 percent said they favor the
Taiwan Solidarity Union.
</P>
<P>
According to Lin, public recognition of Taiwanese identity has
been significantly  increasing  since China's enactment of the
so-called Anti- Secession Law in March 14, 2005, which authorizes
Beijing to use non-peaceful means against Taiwan if it moves
toward formal independence.
</P>
<P>
Lin further said that as long as the DPP continues to insist on
Taiwan-centric consciousness, the party will be able to maintain
power.
