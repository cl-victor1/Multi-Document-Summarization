Taipei,  March 13 (CNA) 03/13/07  20:41:54 (By Elizabeth Hsu)

The Taipei county government reiterated Tuesday that it will act
to help tear down the old Losheng Sanatorium as the Taipei City
Department of Rapid Transit Systems has requested to make way for
a mass rapid transit system construction project.
</P>
<P>
Tuesday marked a seven-day deadline for patients who continue to
make their homes at the old sanatorium compound to relocate,
according a notice issued March 5 by the city department in
charge of the construction of a planned Taipei metro railway to
run though Hsinchuang City in Taipei County. But 48 patients
still live in the compound.
</P>
<P>
The Taipei city department is expected to issue another one-month
notice soon for the remaining patients to relocate.
</P>
<P>
County officials said once the county government receives the
Taipei city department's formal request to post the new notice,
it will begin an effort to advise the old Losheng residents to
move of their own accord within one month. After that it will act
to relocate them by force while dispatching a team of
demolitionists to dismantle the old compound, which stands in the
way of the metro project, they noted.
</P>
<P>
In order to preserve the historic sanatorium, established in 1930
to treat patients with Hansen's disease -- also known as leprosy
-- in segregation, a student group has organized a patrol squad
to prevent the demolitionists from entering the sanatorium
compound.
</P>
<P>
According to the Taipei metro department, affected by the dispute
surrounding the preservation  of the Losheng Sanatorium,  the
inauguration date of the planned Hsinchuang line has been
postponed from Dec. 31 in 2009 to Aug. 15, 2112.
</P>
<P>
Hsinchung Mayor Hsu Ping-kun expressed Tuesday hope for the
resumption of work to construct the rapid transit line, claiming
that citizens can not endure the ongoing traffic mess any longer.
</P>
<P>
According to a survey conducted by the county government on the
matter of the Losheng Sanatorium preservation and people's need
for a rapid transit system, 69 percent of the respondents support
the idea of maintaining the construction of the Hsinchuang line
project as scheduled.
</P>
<P>
The survey also showed that approximately 90 percent respondents
expressed support for the Executive Yuan's plan to keep only 41.6
percent of the old sanatorium compound intact, with the rest to
be torn down to make way for a metro maintenance facility.
</P>
<P>
Most county citizens wish to see the metro construction progress
as soon as possible, county officials concluded.
</P>
<P>
The Council for Cultural Affairs in February proposed a solution
that would retain 90 percent of the compound. However, the
proposal was rejected by the Executive Yuan.
</P>
<P>
Statistics from the Taipei County Department of Health show that
175 of more than 300 old Losheng Sanatorium patients have moved
into the new building. These patients, most of whom have spent
nearly their entire life in the sanatorium, are 75.2-years old on
average, with the oldest aged 99 years and the youngest being 40.
