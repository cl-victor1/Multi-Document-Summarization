Taiwan's representative offices in Southeast Asian countries have
followed a set of standard operation procedures (SOP) in
conducting visa interviews with foreign spouses of Taiwanese
citizens who wish to come to Taiwan, a Ministry of Foreign
Affairs (MOFA) spokesman said Tuesday.

<P>
The clarification came after the Liberty Times, one of Taiwan's
major newspapers, published a story claiming that staff at the
country's representative offices in Southeast Asia did not follow
any SOP in conducting visa interviews with foreign spouses.

The spokesman stressed that the visa interviews have effectively
screened out those intend to enter Taiwan through marriages of
convenience.

So far, the ministry has not yet ordered these representative
offices to take the controversial step of videotaping or voice
recording interviews, the spokesman explained.
