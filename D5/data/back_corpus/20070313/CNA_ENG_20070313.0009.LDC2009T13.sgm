WTO DENIES CHANGING TAIWAN'S OFFICIAL TITLE
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Geneva,  March 12 (CNA) 03/13/07  12:30:29 (Neil Lu)

The World Trade Organization reiterated Monday that it only uses
nomenclature that was agreed upon when Taiwan entered the
organization in 2001 and that it will continue to do so, refuting
allegations that under Chinese pressure,  the organization
changed  Taiwan's  official  title  in  a recent international
meeting.
</P>
<P>
According to news reports from Taipei, Taiwan's title was changed
to "Taiwan Province of China" in all documents circulated at a
global fisheries subsidies meeting held in Geneva March 1-2 under
the auspices of the WTO and the United Nations Environment
Programme (UNEP).
</P>
<P>
Taiwan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs immediately  protested
against Beijing's latest "political plot" to downgrade Taiwan's
international status and also called for the WTO to show respect
for the rights and interests of every member country of the WTO.
</P>
<P>
Asked to comment on the controversy, WTO spokesman Keith Rockwell
said the complaints arising over the use of nomenclature are
based on "a lack of understanding of the facts, " as the meeting
in question was not a WTO event.
</P>
<P>
The two-day seminar on "Disciplining Fisheries Subsidies" was co-
hosted by the UNEP and the world conservation group WWF, with
fishery experts and officials of WTO member states participating.
</P>
<P>
"The WTO always uses the nomenclature which was agreed upon when
Chinese Taipei acceded in 2001, and it will continue to do so, "
Rockwell stressed.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan's formal title in the WTO is "the Separate Customs
Territory of Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen and Matsu, " also referred to
as "Chinese Taipei."
