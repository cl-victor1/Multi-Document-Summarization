Nine police officers in central Nantou County involved in a
wildlife poaching case received different degrees of penalties
Tuesday, with one of them given two major demerits and expelled
from the police force.

The incident occurred March 12 when three officers from a police
station in Hsinyi township violated the Wildlife Conservation Act
by killing Formosan barking deer and flying squirrels with
firearms in the Yushan National Park.

Providence University Professor Chen Yu-feng, who was sightseeing
in the park, saw three dead Formosan barking deer and three dead
white-faced flying squirrels, along with three hunting rifles in
the trunk of a police patrol car.

Chen reported the poaching to park police, who investigated and
found that the poachers were police officers from Nantou County.

Nantou County Police Bureau chief Lin Yi-min apologized Tuesday
to the nation for the incident.

According to Lin, officer Chuan Chung-ming was given two major
demerits and expelled permanently from the police force. Officer
Wu Wen-cheng was given two demerits and transferred to a non-
