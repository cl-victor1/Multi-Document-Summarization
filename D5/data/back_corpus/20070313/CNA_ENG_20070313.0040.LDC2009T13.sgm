PREMIER RESPECTS PROSECUTORS' DECISIONS ON SPECIAL ALLOWANCE
FUNDS
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  March 13 (CNA) 03/13/07  21:37:10 (By Lilian Wu)

<P>
Premier Su Tseng-chang said Tuesday that he respects prosecutors'
decisions on various cases one day after Tainan district
prosecutors cleared Tainan Mayor Hsu Tien-tsai over his "special
allowance fund" for his discretionary use.
</P>
<P>
The premier made the remarks at the question-and-answer session
during a legislative session in which the ruling on Hsu became a
focus of debate.
</P>
<P>
At stake was the view held by Tainan prosecutors that the
"special allowance fund" system is intrinsically flawed and that
half of the fund remitted directly to Hsu's personal account
should be viewed as a "subsidy to the executive in practice."
</P>
<P>
These views differ starkly from those of their colleagues in
Taipei, who indicted former Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou last month
on charges of embezzling NT$11.17 million of public funds.
</P>
<P>
Ma, who was forced to step down as chairman of the main
opposition Kuomintang (KMT) by the indictment, is accused of
lining his pockets by keeping part of the fund that went directly
to his personal account during his two-term mayorship between
1998 and 2006, instead of using it for "official duties, " such
as buying gifts, entertaining guests or awarding his staff.
</P>
<P>
KMT Legislator Wang Yi-ting said that if different criteria are
applied to similar cases, it could give rise to the perception
that political forces are interfering in the justice system.
</P>
<P>
The premier said that although the legal provisions are the same,
each case differs and the facts shall be the basis for judgment.
</P>
<P>
From the perspective of the executive branch, he will respect the
prosectors' ruling, Su said.
</P>
<P>
He said  political  figures,  should  not make  unilateral
interpretations in their own favor because of their own political
stance, purpose or interest.
</P>
<P>
Su, whose use of the "special allowance fund" is also being
investigated, said that he has followed procedures in his use of
the money and will respect justice.
</P>
<P>
Justice Minister Shih Mao-lin said the ministry will respect the
prosecutors' decisions. If the cases are similar but different
prosecutors have different views, the ministry will ask them to
be consistent.
