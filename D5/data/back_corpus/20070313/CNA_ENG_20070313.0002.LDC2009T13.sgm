The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) Monday reiterated Taiwan's
sovereignty over the Tiaoyutai islets in response to Japanese
Okinawa Governor Nakaima Hirokazu's scheduled aerial visit
Tuesday to the mini-archipelago subject to a land dispute between
Taiwan, Japan and China.

The MOFA said in a news release that it has ordered its office in
Naha, capital of Okinawa Prefecture, to persuade Nakaima to drop
the plan.

The Tiaoyutai Islands are 170 kilometers northeast of Keelung,
with a total area of around seven square kilometers. The MOFA
said in the news release it is Taiwan government's consistent
stance that the Tiaoyutai Islands belong to the country, adding
that protecting the rights of Taiwanese fishermen is a primary
concern of the government and that the dispute should be dealt
with peacefully and rationally.
