A delegation of representatives from more than 70 Taiwan
businesses in the agricultural and foodstuff sectors attended the
32nd International Food and Beverage Exhibition, also known as
Foodex Japan, which opened Tuesday in Tokyo.

The delegation,  organized by the Cabinet-level Council of
Agriculture (COA), set up the fifth-largest exhibition section at
the fair, which drew over 2,400 companies from more than 60
countries. Bananas and green soybeans were showcased in the
Taiwan section as two leading representatives of Taiwanese
agricultural products.

<P>
Republic of China Representative to Japan Koh Se-kai expressed
hope that Taiwan will further open the Japanese market for those
products during Foodex Japan, which will run through March 16.

The current market share of Taiwan-grown bananas in Japan is only
2 percent, Koh said, expressing the hope that the share will be
raised to 10 percent.

According to statistics of the Taiwan External Trade Development
Council (TAITRA) , exports of Taiwanese bananas to Japan amounted
to over 6,000 tons in 2006, worth more than NT$15 million
(US$454,200), and there is still ample room for boosted exports,
a TAITRA official said.
