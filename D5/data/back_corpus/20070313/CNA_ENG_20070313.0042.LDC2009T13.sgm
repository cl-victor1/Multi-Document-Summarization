LUNAR NEW YEAR CROSS-STRAIT CHARTER FLIGHTS `TOO EXPENSIVE:' POLL
</HEADLINE>

Taipei, March 13 (CNA) 03/13/07  21:45:30 (By Flor Wang)

Special cross-Taiwan Strait direct charter flights during the
annual Lunar New Year holiday are too expensive and this might
affect passengers' willingness to use them, according to the
results of a poll released Tuesday by lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
The survey found that more than half of the China-based Taiwan
businessmen and their families who used the cross-strait charter
flights during this year's Lunar New Year holiday period in
February and who responded to the poll complained that the
flights were too costly and that they might not use them next
year if prices remain high.
</P>
<P>
Lawmakers of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party, the main
opposition Kuomintang (KMT) and People First Party (PFP) as well
as some independent lawmakers, released the survey results at a
public hearing held at the Legislative Yuan that was also
attended by aviation company officials.
</P>
<P>
The poll was carried out from Feb. 23-24 by an office run by a
group of lawmakers from both the opposition and ruling parties to
serve China-based Taiwan  businessmen.  A total of 823 valid
questionnaires were collected.
</P>
<P>
According to KMT Legislator Chu Fong-chi, around 89 percent of
the respondents complained  that  the flights  were "somewhat
expensive," with 53 percent of them labeling them "very
expensive."
</P>
<P>
For instance, Chu said, a Lunar New Year direct charter flight
from Beijing to Taipei cost 5,030 Chinese yuan, markedly higher
than an indirect flight via Hong Kong or Macau that cost 4,428
Chinese yuan.
</P>
<P>
The price issue was the top grumble cited by respondents who used
this year's Lunar New Year cross-strait charter flights, followed
by demand for a larger number of flights and shorter flight
times, the poll discovered.
</P>
<P>
This was also the case on other  routes,  including  the
Shanghai-Taipei and Guangzhou-Taipei routes, except for flights
between Taipei and Xiamen, she said.
</P>
<P>
Although the government is expected to allow carriers from both
sides to conduct cross-strait direct charter flights on weekends
and holidays, Chu said, fewer passengers will use them if prices
remain at the current levels.
</P>
<P>
Representatives from EVA Airways, Mandarin Airlines and Trans
Asia Airways, Taipei-based carriers which provided the direct
charter flights during the Lunar New Year holiday season, said
that they will study the poll results and offer a satisfactory
reply to solve the issue before Tomb Sweeping Day in late March
-- another major holiday on the lunar calendar.
</P>
<P>
PFP Legislator Chang Hsien-yao ascribed the high prices for Lunar
New Year cross-strait direct charter flights to the lack of a
regular operation of the service.
</P>
<P>
If the government fails to help implement the service on a
regular basis between the two sides, Taiwan's full opening to
Chinese tourists will not be as successful as touted, he
predicted.
