China Airlines (CAL), Taiwan's largest carrier, plans to open a
Taipei-Barcelona cargo route and Kaohsiung-Chiangmai passenger
flight service this year, following last year's record business
turnover, according to a company executive.
</P>
<P>
Last year,  the airline company  successfully  opened nine
international cargo and passengers routes amid soaring oil
prices, CAL Chairman Philip Wei said at a press conference
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Wei forecast that the global cargo market will be able to sustain
a 6.3 percent growth this year, thanks to robust high-tech
industries in Asia, globalized manufacturing industries, and
global management networks.
</P>
<P>
In addition, he said that the Taiwanese government is expected to
soon allow more Chinese tourists to visit Taiwan, which he
claimed will create new business opportunities for local airline
and bus companies.
</P>
<P>
CAL plans to introduce four new aircraft into Taiwan -- three
passenger airplanes and one cargo plane -- and to retire one
passenger plane, according to Wei.
</P>
<P>
Despite rising oil prices, CAL reported record-high turnover of
NT$120 billion in 2006, Wei noted.
