</HEADLINE>

Taipei,   March  13  (CNA) 03/13/07  23:45:03 (By Sofia Wu)

<P>
The government  should study the feasibility of relocating more
public agencies away from capital Taipei  to  facilitate
localization  and  "multinucleus urban regeneration," a senior
Cabinet economic planner said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Chang Jing-sen, vice chairman of the Cabinet-level Council for
Economic Planning and Development (CEPD) made the remarks in an
interview with CNA.
</P>
<P>
"With the inauguration of Bullet Train service earlier this year,
Taiwan has entered a multinucleus national development era, "
Chang said, adding that the travel time between Taiwan's two
largest cities -- Taipei in the north and Kaohsiung in the south
-- has been cut to 90 minutes from the previous five hours or
more.
</P>
<P>
Against this backdrop, Chang said Taiwan should not continue to
concentrate all of its government agencies and state-own
corporate headquarters in its capital any longer.
</P>
<P>
"We should adopt a new thinking in charting our future national
development course and blueprint, " Chang said, adding that a
region-based perspective is necessary in drafting future national
development plans.
</P>
<P>
With the advent of an era of multinucleus development, Chang said
the government should draw up a comprehensive plan for relocating
some public agencies and state-own corporate headquarters outside
Taipei.
</P>
<P>
In addition to relocate the Council of Agriculture and the
Fisheries Administration to central or southern Taiwan, Chang
said several other agencies, such as the Tourism Bureau under the
Ministry of Transportation and Communications, the Bureau of Mine
under the Ministry of Economic Affairs, the Council of Labor
Affairs and the Council for Hakka Affairs,  are also suitable for
relocation southward, he added.
