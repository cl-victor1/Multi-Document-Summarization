TAIWAN'S E-COMPETITIVENESS RANKS 2ND IN ASIA: CABINET
</HEADLINE>

Taipei, March 13 (CNA) 03/13/07  22:32:50 (By T.C. Jiang)

Taiwan's e-competitiveness ranks second in Asia, a spokesman for
the Executive Yuan said Tuesday, after local media quoted a
global survey saying that Taiwan's digital penetration rate lags
behind the other three "Asian dragons" -- Singapore, Hong Kong
and South Korea.
</P>
<P>
The media misquoted statistics released by the International
Telecommunication Union (ITU) in 2005 in saying that Taiwan's PC
penetration  rate  was 53 percent,  said officials  from  the
Cabinet-level National Information and Communications Initiative
Committee (NICI).
</P>
<P>
The officials found after checking the same data that Taiwan's
ratio is 57.52 percent, higher than South Korea's 53.18 percent.
</P>
<P>
The officials also took issue with the media report of Taiwan's
Internet penetration rate in 2006 because the ITU has not even
released data or any related data on Internet penetration for
2006.
</P>
<P>
In addition, according to the survey released by the ITU in 2005,
Taiwan's Internet penetration rate ranked second among the four
"Asian dragons," the officials pointed out.
</P>
<P>
The officials further quoted a report conducted by the Cabinet-
level Research, Development, and Evaluation Commission, and said
that Taiwan's household Internet penetration rate was 70.6
percent in 2005 and 74.5 percent in 2006.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan outdid some of the other three "Asian dragons" in some
other areas of similar surveys, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
For instance, in the Global Information Technology Report
released by the World Economic Forum in March 2006, Taiwan
outperformed Hong Kong and South Korea, and was only behind
Singapore, the officials went on.
</P>
<P>
In that annual survey, Taiwan was ranked seventh among 115
nations, up eight notches from the 15th place of 2005, the
officials said, adding that Hong Kong was in 11th place, with
South Korea in 14th place.
