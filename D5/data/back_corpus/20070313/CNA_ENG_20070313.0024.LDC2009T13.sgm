AMENDMENTS RELATED TO POSTAL COMPANY NAME CHANGE BLOCKED

Taipei,  March 13 (CNA) 03/13/07  17:45:11 (By Flor Wang)

<P>
Four proposed amendments put forward by the Executive Yuan
surrounding a name change for the state-owned postal service
provider were blocked Tuesday by opposition "pan-blue" lawmakers
at the Procedure Committee under the Legislative Yuan.
</P>
<P>
The four proposed revisions were effectively killed by lawmakers
of the main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) and the People First
Party (PFP) who excluded the bills from the agenda of the
Procedural Committee, meaning that they cannot be referred to the
special committee for substantial screening.
</P>
<P>
KMT lawmaker Kuo Su-chun criticized the government for wasting
national resources on such pointless matters instead of devoting
its energy to galvanizing Taiwan's economy.
</P>
<P>
The government's plan to alter the state-run postal service --
already renamed Taiwan Post Co. from its previous designation,
Chunghwa Post Co., in line with the Executive Yuan name change
drive for state-owned enterprises and facilities -- would
downgrade the status of the public-run company to that of a local
branch of China's postal network, Kuo pointed out.
</P>
<P>
KMT lawmaker Alex Fei said that he refused to allow the four
proposed amendments to pass the Legislative Yuan out of a strong
dissatisfaction with the Executive Yuan's unlawful actions in
forcing the state-run postal company to change its official
designation without first acquiring legislative approval to do
so.
</P>
<P>
Ruling Democratic Progressive  Party (DPP)  lawmakers Cheng Yun-
peng and Hsu Kuo-yung, however, contended that all bills duly
submitted to the legislature's Procedure Committee should be
referred to the special committee for substantial scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the four proposals aimed at altering the postal
company's name, another bill amending the Presidential and Vice
Presidential Election and Recall Law -- specifically banning
indicted individuals from taking part in presidential elections
-- was also frozen by KMT and PFP lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
The proposed amendment to the Presidential and Vice Presidential
Election and Recall Law is widely believed to target former KMT
Chairman Ma Ying-jeou, who quit the KMT's top job in mid-February
after being indicted on corruption charges over allegedly
embezzling funds from a special municipal monthly allowance while
serving as mayor of Taipei from 1998-2006.
</P>
<P>
Ma immediately announced his presidential bid following the
indictment by Taipei prosecutors on Feb. 13.
