The Taiwan Futures Exchange (TAIFEX) has been admitted to the
Association of Futures Markets (AFM) , becoming the AFM's 20th
full member, a TAIFEX spokesman said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The AFM is the fifth international group that the TAIFEX has
joined  since  its entry to the U.S.-based  Futures  Industry
Association, according to the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
The AFM approved the TAIFEX membership application at its 10th
annual conference Monday, the spokesman said.

The AFM was established in Buenos Aires, Argentina in 1998, with
the aim of building a network for contacting and communicating
among its members around the world, and promoting international
cooperation and information exchanges, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Its members are mainly from the emerging markets involved in
derivatives transactions, the spokesman went on, adding that the
AFM holds an annual conference to serve as a means of new ideas
and information interflow.
</P>
<P>
In cooperation with the Swiss Futures and Options Association
(SFOA) the AFM has held annual forums since 2000 to promote
cooperation in emerging markets, according to the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
The TAIFEX began to attend the AFM annual gatherings in 2004.
This year, the TAIFEX representatives attended a pair of forums
to discuss technological developments in futures markets and the
feasibility of developing new products in Asian emerging markets,
the spokesman said.

During the seminars, TAIFEX representatives also shared Taiwan's
success in derivative products with participants from other
countries in the hopes of boosting Taiwan's  international
profile and popularity, and further expanding overseas inter-
market cooperative opportunities.
