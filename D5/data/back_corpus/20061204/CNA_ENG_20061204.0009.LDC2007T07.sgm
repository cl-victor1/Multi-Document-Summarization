DEFENSE MINISTER REFUSES TO RELEASE MILITARY INSTRUCTOR

Taipei,  Dec. 4 (CNA) (By Deborah Kuo)

<P>
Defense Minister Lee Jye refused Monday to accede to opposition
lawmakers' demands that the high school drillmaster detained on the
charge of inciting "active duty servicemen to riot" in late November
be released.
</P>
<P>
Fielding questions at the Legislative Yuan Defense Committee, Lee said
the case -- involving Army Maj. Tung Hua-cheng, a drillmaster at the
Taibei High School in Shilin, who showed up Sept. 20 at the site of a
"Million Voices Against Corruption" rally aimed at pushing for
President Chen Shui-bian to step down -- is being handled by the
military courts according to the law.
</P>
<P>
Tung wore his military uniform to the rally but apparently was trying
to hide his identity with a face mask and a pair of sunglasses. At the
rally, he displayed a letter he wrote to Minister of National Defense
Lee Jye, saying that in the event of a war, the rank and file soldiers
will "turn their guns inward."

The military instructor could face seven years in prison if convicted
of inciting active duty servicemen to riot in violation of Article 16
of the Criminal Law of the Armed Forces, according to Military High
Court prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
Noting that Tung is facing serious charges, Lee said that he cannot
agree with the opposition lawmakers' calls for his release. He added
that if lawmakers feel that Tung's human rights have been violated,
they can file a petition with the commission charged to protect
servicemen's rights under the Ministry of National Defense (MND).
</P>
<P>
Opposition People First Party Legislator Chao Liang-yen asked the MND
to release Tung immediately, claiming that military prosecutors had
"illegally arrested" him. Chao argued that the offense of inciting
active duty servicemen to riot only applies to actions that endanger
the integrity of the nation's territory, are aimed at toppling the
government, or involve the use of violence to threaten or coerce.
</P>
<P>
Chao argued that Tung did not commit any of these offenses through his
actions at the rally.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Lee said that he has not felt any pressure from "upstairs"
since the officer's arrest and that the military has remained calm,
with no signs that any "rank and file soldiers have been incited to
riot."
