The Department of Health (DOH) on Saturday urged youths to stay
away from drugs and practice safe sex.
</P>
<P>
Lin Ting, deputy chief of the DOH's Center for Disease Control,
made the appeal amid reports that police arrested drug dealers at
the annual Spring Scream music and arts festival which kicked off
early this week in the resort area of Kenting in southern
Pingtung County.

<P>
Li noted that the number of young people who have been infected
with HIV through sexual activity has risen rapidly and that drug
use often increases the risks of contracting the disease.
</P>
<P>
A recent survey conducted by the DOH shows that more than 20
percent of young people who have had sexual intercourse in the
past month have not practiced safe sex.
</P>
<P>
DOH statistics also show that over the past year, 394 young
people between the age of 15 and 24 were confirmed to have been
infected with HIV. The number of people infected with HIV in this
age group has increased steadily in recent years, mainly because
of the practice of unsafe sex, Lin said.
</P>
<P>
Lin said that drug dealers often use such events as the Spring
Scream to sell their goods, adding that the atmosphere at such
events could lure young people to try drugs, which he claimed
often leads to unsafe sex.
