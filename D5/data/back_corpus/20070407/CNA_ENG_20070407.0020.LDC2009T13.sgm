book show set to be launched April 21 in the reading room on the
library's second floor, a spokesman for the library said

The first show will run through July 1 and be followed by book
shows on the themes of "Old Photos of Local Places" to be held
July 3-Sep. 30, "Reading France" to run from Oct. 2-31, and
"Research Methods and Thesis Writing" to be held Nov. 2-Dec. 31.

The spokesman said the book shows are aimed at encouraging the
public to utilize the library more and cultivate the habit of
reading as part of efforts to create a "learning society" where
"anyone can read books anywhere."
