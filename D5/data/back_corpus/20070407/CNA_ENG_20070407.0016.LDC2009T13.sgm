President Chen Shui-bian said Saturday that the planning of the
Taichung Airport should have broad vision and take into
consideration prospective Chinese tourists coming to Taiwan,
according to Legislator Yang Chiung-ying of the opposition
Kuomintang.
</P>
<P>
Yang,  her legislative  colleagues Kuo Chun-ming and Hsieh Ming-
yuan from the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) ,
Taichung County Magistrate Huang Chung-sheng, as well as DPP
Secretary-General Lin Chia-lung attended a briefing for President
Chen. The president, accompanied by Premier Su Tseng-chang,
inspected the Taichung Airport, which was converted from an air
base.
</P>
<P>
Talks with China on the opening of Taiwan to Chinese tourists for
sightseeing are reportedly in the final stage.
</P>
<P>
According to Legislator Yang, the president thinks that the
facilities of the airport are still not up to par with those of
international airports, that the software and hardware equipment
must be improved, and that facilities for outbound traffic should
be upgraded.
</P>
<P>
Yang noted that many local people are worried that Taichung
Airport, although called an international airport, has only a
very limited number of international charter flights. Its
function as a domestic airport has gradually decreased,
especially since the inauguration of the high-speed rail system
early this year. They urged the government  to help step up
software  and hardware improvements so that it will not remain an
airport for only charter flights.
</P>
<P>
These local people suggested an extension of a planned mass rapid
transit system line to connect it to the airport, as well as the
construction of additional runways and hangars at the airport,
and the opening of cargo services to facilitate the export of
goods of manufacturers in the Central Taiwan Science Park.
</P>
<P>
According to Civil Aeronautics Administration statistics, there
are around 30,000 passengers every month on domestic flights to
and from the airport, mainly going to and from Taiwan's offshore
islands.
</P>
<P>
On international charter flights, there are more than 40,000
passengers every month, mainly to Hong Kong, Macau and Vietnam,
according to the tallies.
