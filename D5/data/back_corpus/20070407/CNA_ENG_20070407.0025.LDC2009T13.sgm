</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  April 7 (CNA) 04/07/07  21:10:21 (By Sofia Wu)

The late President Chiang Kai-shek's first official residence in
Taiwan, which was badly damaged in a fire just after midnight
Friday, will definitely be restored to its past glory, Taipei
City's culture chief said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Lee Yung-ping, director of the Department of Cultural Affairs of
the Taipei City government, made the remarks after the Grass
Mountain Chateau on scenic Yangmingshan  in suburban Taipei was
almost completely engulfed in the fire that broke out at around
12: 20 a.m.
</P>
<P>
The style of the 660-square-meter main building, on an estate
covering  about 1,815 square meters,  is typical  of Japanese
architecture of the 1920s. The wall of the entrance to the main
building is made of stone, with Japanese wooden structure inside.
</P>
<P>
The fire destroyed more than half of the main building, with the
wooden interior being completely burnt. The stone wall remains
intact.
</P>
<P>
Total damage is estimated at roughly NT$36 million (US$1.09
million) , Lee said, adding that the municipal cultural
department will invite experts and scholars to form a special
panel to investigate the extent of the damage and flesh out a
restoration plan.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the city government had conducted an elaborate study
on the chateau's architectural structure and interior design
before formally listing it as a protected heritage site in 2002,
Lee said she believes it won't be very difficult to restore it to
its original glory.
</P>
<P>
As to the exhibits on display in its main hall, Lee said,
reproduction will not be a problem given the fact that nearly all
of the items were replicas. Nevertheless, she added that the
question of what exhibits will be displayed inside the restored
building will be open for further discussion by experts and
scholars.
</P>
<P>
Lee said the special panel, to be composed of three to six
academics and architectural specialists, will hold its first
meeting Monday or Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
As the fire happened at a time when Taipei's politicians have
been squabbling over whether to preserve the late President
Chiang's legacy or wipe it out after the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) branded him as the main perpetrator of
the infamous 228 Incident of 1947, Taipei Mayor Hau Lung-bin said
he will ask municipal police officers to step up patrols in and
around the chateau as well as at other buildings dedicated to the
memory of Chiang, including the Chiang Kai-shek Memorial Hal, the
Shihlin Domicile and the Yangming Residence.
</P>
<P>
Hau refrained from speculation about the cause of the fire,
saying an investigation team has been formed to probe why and how
the blaze had broken out in the first place.
</P>
<P>
Since the chateau has been designated as a heritage site, Hau
said it should not become a target of criticism. "People of
different political stripes or affiliations should all work for
preservation of cultural heritage and historical relics." he
added.
</P>
<P>
The municipal firefighting department's Yangming outpost sent
fire engines to the scene immediately after receiving an
emergency call from security guards at the chateau round
midnight, city officials said, adding that as the flames were
very high, more fire gear from neighboring Shihlin, Shihpei and
Huagang outposts were sent to help put out the fire which was
brought under control at around 1:30 a.m.
</P>
<P>
According to the officials, their firefighting efforts were
impeded by several factors, including a water shortage, heavy
night fog, and the area's rugged terrain.
</P>
<P>
The city government has listed the 87-year-old estate as a
protected heritage site. The chateau was built in 1920 by Taiwan
Sugar Corp. in preparation for a visit by then-Japanese Crown
Prince Hirohito. Historical records show that Hirohito stayed at
the house for only one hour and 50 minutes. The chateau later
served as a spa villa for social celebrities during the period of
Japanese colonial rule.
</P>
<P>
In December 1949, the Republic of China government moved its seat
to Taipei, and President Chiang Kai-shek chose to stay at the
chateau,  making it Taiwan's first presidential residence. The
president and his wife lived at the house until May 1950 when a
new house was built in Taipei's Shihlin district. The chateau
later served as the first couple's summer villa.
</P>
<P>
As several major government decisions were made during the
Chiang's stay at the chateau, the Taipei City government decided
Dec. 19, 2002 to list the house as a building of historical
significance and officially named it the "Grass Mountain
Chateau."
</P>
<P>
The building has since served as a cultural activity center that
encompasses  an exhibition  hall,  a small-scale  showroom,  a
multifunctional auditorium, a performance area, a semi-open air
coffee shop , and a management center. The mid-night fire damaged
all the exhibition hall and showrooms as well as the coffee shop,
known as Meilu Hall and Yingho Hall, respectively.
</P>
<P>
The city government has commissioned the Buddhist Fo Kuang
University to manage the chateau since 2002 and the cooperation
contract is scheduled to expire at the end of June this year.
