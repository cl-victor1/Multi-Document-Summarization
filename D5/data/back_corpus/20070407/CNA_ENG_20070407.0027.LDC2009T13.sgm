Former opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman  Ma Ying-jeou
expressed  the hope Saturday that the newly-elected KMT chairman,
Wu Poh-hsiung, will attach importance to party unity and reform
after assuming the post, while Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-
pyng, a KMT heavyweight, expressed the wish that Wu will make
efforts to improve the party's image.
</P>
<P>
Wu won Saturday's KMT chairmanship by-election by garnering
156,000 votes. His only rival, Legislator Hung Hsiu-chu, received
just 23,000 votes. After learning about Wu's victory during his
visit to the southern county of Kaohsiung, Ma said that he
expects the chairman-elect to help the party win back power in
the 2008 presidential election.

Also in Kaohsiung County, Wang urged KMT members during his visit
to his hometown of Luchu Village to do their utmost to maintain
the party's image, while calling for the new leadership to
reconsider a proposal to amend the party's charter to allow the
nomination of a member who is found guilty of a law offense in a
district court to represent the KMT in a major election like the
presidential election.
</P>
<P>
Wang claimed the proposal, aimed at allowing Ma, who is on trial
for allegedly embezzling public funds, to join the KMT primary
for the presidential election, has triggered criticism in
society.
</P>
<P>
Ma was indicted Feb. 13 for allegedly embezzling NT$11.17 million
from a special allowance fund budgeted for his discretionary use
during his term as Taipei mayor from 1998-2006.
</P>
<P>
Both Ma and Wang are aspirants for the KMT's nomination to
represent the party in the next presidential election.
