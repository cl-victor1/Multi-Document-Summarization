Executive Yuan officials urged consumers Wednesday to purchase
poultry labeled with official quality certification, such as the
Certified Agricultural Standard (CAS) logo created by the Council
of Agriculture (COA) for high-quality domestic agricultural
produce.
</P>
<P>
A number of officials jointly made the call at a press conference
organized by the Executive Yuan as part of efforts to protect
Taiwan from a virulent H5N1 avian flu attack.
</P>
<P>
Chen Chien-jen, the convener of the Executive Yuan's coordination
meeting on the prevention and control of avian influenza, said it
is important that people avoid coming into contact with live
fowl.
</P>
<P>
To this end, Chen said the government has decided to impose a ban
against the trade in and slaughter of live fowl at traditional
markets, noting that there will be a series of promotional
activities for the new measure, scheduled to come into effect in
April 2008.
</P>
<P>
Many Taiwanese people prefer to purchase poultry at traditional
markets where they can see whether the birds are healthy and
sound before slaughter.
</P>
<P>
Other officials present at the coordination meeting included
Government Information Office Minister Cheng Wen-tsang,
Department of Health Vice Minister Wang Hsiu-hung, COA Vice
Minister Hu Fu-hsiung and Vice Minister of Economic Affairs Hsieh
Fa-ta.
