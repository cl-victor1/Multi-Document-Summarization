DPP UNDECIDED OVER BLUE-FREE POLLING
</HEADLINE>

The ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)  leadership
Wednesday reached a preliminary consensus on adopting strict
measures to exclude the opinions of non-supporters from the
process to nominate candidates for at-large legislators in the
year-end election, party officials said.
</P>
<P>
The DPP Central Standing Committee Wednesday discussed the
recently heatedblue- voter-exclusionissue. However, no resolution
was reached that day and controversy still flies over whether the
measure should be applied to primaries for constituency
legislator and presidential elections, party officials said.
</P>
<P>
The DPP has a primary system which takes into account both
opinion polls involving general citizens and voting by party
members, with the former weighted 70 percent and the latter 30
percent. Concerned about the influence of opposition-leaning
voters on the polls that will determine who represents the party
in elections for presidential and legislative seats, the party
last year adopted a measure to limit the number of effective
samples in telephone polls.
</P>
<P>
According to the measure scheduled  to be enacted in the
legislative election at the end of the year, two questions are to
be added to the questionnaire. The first asks which political
camp the interviewee favors -- thepan-greencamp led by the DPP,
or its opponentpan-bluealliance. Awrong answerto this question
will result in the questionnaire being discarded if the person
surveyed then answersNoto the following question: Would you,
however, vote for a DPP candidate this time if you believe he or
she is a good candidate?
</P>
<P>
Not satisfied by the previous policy designed to exclude only
deep bluevoters - namely diehard supporters of the blue camp, DPP
lawmakers Chai Trong-rong and Wang Shih-cheng recently initiated
a proposal to exclude moreblue votersfrom being counted in the
nomination polls.
</P>
<P>
The stricter version requires that the interviewees be asked
whether they have voted for candidates of the Kuomintang, the
People First Party, or the New Party in any of the pass three
major elections: the 2004 presidential election, the legislative
election that year, and the 2005 county-level commissioner
elections or the 2006 Taipei and Kaohsiung City mayoral
elections, depending on the respondent's  constituency.  A
singleyeswould  void  the questionnaire.
</P>
<P>
Proponents of the stricter version argue that it would enhance
members' loyalty to the party and strengthen solidarity within
the party, while opponents say it would distract centrist voters
and make the party more inward-looking and narrow-minded.
</P>
<P>
Chai Trong-rong said Wednesday that the current system is unfair
in that DPP politicians who attack the party or President Chen
Shui-bian enjoy higher popularity ratings than those who defend
the party and Chen.
</P>
<P>
Those who are loyal to the party are unlikely to win support from
blue voters in the polling, he said.Lawmakers in the party will
be eager to attack President Chen if only to boost their polling
numbers should the blue-exclusion clauses not be established.
</P>
<P>
Wang Shih-cheng had said he would withdraw from the party and run
as an independent candidate in the year-end election if the party
fails to adopt the strict blue-exclusion clauses.
</P>
<P>
Yang Chiu-Hsing, Kaohsiung County Commissioner and a member of
the DPP's central standing committee, said the that an exclusion
of deep blue voters is enough andlight blueas well as swing
voters should be included.
</P>
<P>
As the year-end election will be the first under the single
member constituency system, in which each constituency elects
only one lawmaker, the DPP will need to attract more middle-of-
the-road voters who has no strong party ties and tend to choose
from among the candidates, not according to party linesYang said,
responding to media queries before the committee meeting
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Lin Cho-Shui, a DPP figure who quit his legislative seat in
protest last November over the party's inaction on corruption
scandals, called the strict blue-exclusion pollingridiculous.
</P>
<P>
He said the DPP should be confident in its current course as the
trend in recent years has shown greater numbers of ballots cast
for the party, adding that strict exclusion will only lead to a
shrinking of the party's base.
