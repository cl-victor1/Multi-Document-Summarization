</HEADLINE>

Keelung,  Jan. 30 (CNA) 01/31/07  10:21:55 (By Han Nai-kuo)

Keelung Mayor Hsu Tsai-li was transferred to an intensive care
unit of the Keelung Chang Gung Memorial Hospital Tuesday after
his condition deteriorated because of complications from
diabetes.
</P>
<P>
According to Keelung Deputy Mayor Ko Shui-yuan, Hsu was suffering
from kidney and foot problems as a result of diabetes but
expressed hope that he could return home before Lunar New Year's
Day, which falls on Feb. 18.
</P>
<P>
Ko, who is acting mayor in Hsu's absence, told reporters that
although the mayor's daughter has indicated that she is prepared
to donate a kidney to her father, the transplant will have to
wait until the mayor's condition has improved.
</P>
<P>
Hsu reportedly has been in low spirits since the opposition
Kuomintang (KMT) launched a petition campaign in order to
introduce a motion to recall him for graft.
</P>
<P>
Hsu was re-elected Keelung mayor in December 2005 with the KMT's
support. The KMT had nominated him despite his involvement in a
corruption scandal.
</P>
<P>
Hsu voluntarily suspended his membership in the KMT in January
2006 when he was indicted, and was expelled from the party in
September after the Keelung District Court sentenced him to seven
years in prison on charges of corruption in a NT$85 million
(US$2.57 million) land deal.
</P>
<P>
Hsu has vowed that he will appeal the case to the Taiwan High
Court and has refused to resign, claiming that he did nothing
wrong.
</P>
<P>
According to the law, Hsu's status as Keelung mayor will not be
affected unless he is convicted of corruption at a second trial
by the High Court.
