The Taipei flower market will open 24 hours from Feb. 12-16 and
an event will be held Feb. 21 to greet the Chinese New Year, a
Taipei flower market spokesman said Tuesday.

Taipei Flower Auction Co. Manager Chen Gen-wang said the 24-hour
opening period will allow people to purchase flowers for the
Chinese New Year, also known as the Spring Festival, and he added
that six lessons on flower arranging will be offered every day
during the period.

The flower market will open Feb. 17 from 1 a.m. to 1 p.m., will
close Feb. 18-22 and reopen Feb. 23. However, it will also hold a
turnip painting activity for 30 kindergarten or elementary school
students and a cat-tail willow peeling activity for 30 pairs of
people at 10 a.m. and 11 a.m., respectively, on Feb. 21.

According to Chen, flower production is 2 percent higher than
previous years due to the warm winter, but despite this, the
average price is 3 precent higher, with prices for the five days
before Lunar New Year a whopping 10 percent to 20 percent higher
than average.

Chen said cat-tail willows, kumquat, guzmania and moth orchids
are all favorites for the Spring Festival. He suggested that
people move potted plants outdoors and change the water for cut
flowers frequently to extend their lives.
