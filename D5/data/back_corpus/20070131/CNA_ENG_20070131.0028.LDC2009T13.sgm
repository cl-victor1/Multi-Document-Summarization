Premier Su Chen-chang awarded medals and prizes to two tennis
players Wednesday and praised them as "the new generation of
Taiwan's glory."
</P>
<P>
The players, Chan Yung-jan and Chuang Chia-jung, won second place
in the women's doubles at the Australian Open tennis
championships in Melbourne Jan. 26.
</P>
<P>
Chan and Chuang were received at the Executive Yuan by Su,
Minister without Portfolio Wu Feng-shan, new National Council on
Physical Fitness and Sports Chairman Yang Chung-ho and Finance
Minister Ho Chih-chin.
</P>
<P>
Su noted that when he was Taipei county magistrate he promoted an
"ABC level training plan" to nurture potential players from A
level (county level), to B level (national level), and to C level
(world level).
</P>
<P>
Noting that Chan was once a key A level player in Taipei County,
Su said the government has the obligation to offer help in
training rather than merely recognizing victorious players.
</P>
<P>
Su asked Yang and Ho to discover more potential players and to
help them with their games.
