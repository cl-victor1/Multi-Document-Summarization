Taiwan's plan to enact a new constitution might conflict with the
U.S. policy on cross-Taiwan Strait relations, a U.S. official
said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
John Negroponte, the U.S. intelligence chief who has been
nominated by President George W. Bush as deputy secretary of
state, made the remarks in response to a question on the issue
during a confirmation hearing held by the Senate Foreign
Relations Committee.
</P>
<P>
Negroponte  reiterated  that the United States supports  a "one-
China" policy and sticks to the three communiques with China.
</P>
<P>
"And we believe that it would be unwise to do anything that might
be at cross purposes with those three," he said.
</P>
<P>
Asked if he thinks the new constitution proposed by Taiwan would
be "at cross purposes, " Negroponte said: "I would want to study
the implications, but it certainly strikes me that that would be
a distinct possibility."
</P>
<P>
Last week in Taipei, President Chen Shui-bian renewed his
proposal to enact a new constitution that is "timely, relevant
and viable" for Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Chen claimed that without the new constitution, Taiwan cannot
become a "normal, complete and progressive" democracy.
</P>
<P>
According to an idea touted by Chen repeatedly over the past
several years, the draft of the new constitution should be put to
a referendum this year so that the new constitution can be
implemented in 2008.
