PREMIER SUPPORTS TERMINOLOGY CHANGES IN CHINESE HISTORY TEXTBOOKS
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  Jan.  31  (CNA) 01/31/07  19:16:49 (By Y.F. Low)

<P>
Premier Su Tseng-chang expressed his support Wednesday  for
terminology  changes in Chinese history textbooks for senior high
school students, saying the changes will improve students'
knowledge of Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Su also expressed his approval for Minister of Education Tu
Cheng-sheng for his insistence on the changes.
</P>
<P>
"We must let children know that Taiwan is their country and
improve their knowledge of their country so that they can be
proud of the efforts made by their ancestors and love this land,
" Su said during a weekly Cabinet meeting.
</P>
<P>
Su was responding to changes in Chinese history textbooks for
senior high school students in Taiwan, in which the terms "our
country" and "mainland" -- which were commonly used in the past
-- have been changed to simply "China." Meanwhile, the prefix
"founding father, " which appears in Chinese textbooks every time
Sun Yat-sen is mentioned, has been deleted.
</P>
<P>
Some opposition legislators have demanded that Tu step down for
approving the textbooks, which they claimed are "altering
history."
</P>
<P>
Su said that since he was little, he has felt that history and
geography textbooks in Taiwan seldom taught students to know
about their own country but instead taught impractical material
such as the length of the Yangtze river, the origin of the Yellow
river and the indigenous products of Northeastern China, none of
which have anything to do with Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that under the 50-year-long Kuomintang rule in
Taiwan, students were always taught to identify with "the great
China, " which resulted in the students lacking any knowledge of
or concern for the place they grew up.
</P>
<P>
The premier said that for people growing up in Taiwan, "eating
Taiwan rice and drinking Taiwan water, " there is no doubt that
"Taiwan is our country."
