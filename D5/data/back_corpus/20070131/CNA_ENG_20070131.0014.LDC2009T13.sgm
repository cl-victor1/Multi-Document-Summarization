Taiwan airline operators said Wednesday that it would be
difficult that additional flights be added to the schedule for
the 2007 Lunar New Year direct cross-Taiwan Strait charter flight
services with the major holiday being just around the corner.
</P>
<P>
In response to a Beijing request the day before that extra
charter flights be added during the Chinese New Year holiday, EVA
Airways spokesman Nieh Kuo-wei said it is too late to arrange
additional flights.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the number of charter flights scheduled for the 2007
Chinese New Year is much higher than the number of flights during
the last Chinese New Year holiday, Nieh said that it would be
technically difficult to have additional flights arranged with
the holiday only two weeks away.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese New Year direct cross-strait charter flight services
are scheduled to be launched Feb. 13, with carriers from each
side operating a total of 96 flights during the holiday period.
</P>
<P>
Six carriers from each side of the Taiwan Strait will operate the
charter flights  between  Taipei/Kaohsiung  in  Taiwan  and
Beijing/Shanghai/Guangzhou/Xiamen in China from Feb. 13-26.
</P>
<P>
Sun Hung-wen, a spokesman for Taiwan's China Airlines, said
whether additional charter flights should be arranged during the
holiday period is an issue the airline operators will consider in
terms of business interests.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for Far Eastern Air Transport Corp. said the company
can barely accommodate the domestic flight demand during the
Chinese New Year holiday, not to mention putting aside extra
flights for the cross-strait charter services.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, officials from the Civil Aeronautic Administration
said that although it is kind of rushed to ask the private
carriers to arrange for additional flights in such a short period
of time, the Mainland Affairs Council still has the final say in
the matter.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan  citizens  with valid entry permits  issued by the
governments on the two sides are eligible to take any of the New
Year charter flights.
</P>
<P>
This will mark the fourth year that direct cross-strait charter
flight services will be offered during the Lunar New Year
holiday.
