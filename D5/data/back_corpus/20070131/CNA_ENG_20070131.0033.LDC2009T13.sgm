Taiwan is in a very advantageous position in cross-Taiwan Strait
exchanges if it properly handles its political ties with China,
Singapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong has said in a recent
interview with a Taipei magazine.
</P>
<P>
Lee said in the interview with the Global View magazine that
Taiwan should first address its political issues and cross-strait
affairs and claimed that it stands in a good position to explore
exchanges with China because it has a lot of talent, a strong
economy and advanced technologies.
</P>
<P>
Lee stressed the importance of clean, honest and responsible
politics and said that the government must focus on long-term
development instead of just winning the next election.
</P>
<P>
"We need a sound political climate to delve into the basic
interests and development direction of our country, " Lee said
referring to Singapore.
</P>
<P>
Although Singapore was long opposed to the gambling industry, Lee
said, the government changed its mind and has build high-end
complexes composed of ostentatious resort villages with casinos
in view of the upgrading quality in worldwide casinos.
</P>
<P>
If Singapore had been reluctant to change its attitude, its
tourism industry would have suffered a big loss, dealing a heavy
blow to its economy, he said.
</P>
<P>
According to Lee, Singapore has also been committed to promoting
its biomedical, digital, environmental protection and multi-media
industries in recent years and is seeking to build closer
economic links with India and countries of the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
"As a small country in Southeast Asia, Singapore needs to develop
good relations with all the world's major powers," Lee said.
