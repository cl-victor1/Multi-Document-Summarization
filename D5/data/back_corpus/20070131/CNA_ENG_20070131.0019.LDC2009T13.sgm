BEIJING MUM ON FORMER ROC PRESIDENT'S WISH TO VISIT CHINA
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

Taipei,  Jan.  31 (CNA) 01/31/07  16:30:53 (By Deborah Kuo)

<P>
A spokesman for Beijing's Central Office for Taiwan Affairs
refused to comment Wednesday on reports that former President Lee
Teng-hui has expressed hope recently that he can visit China.
</P>
<P>
At a regular news conference held in Beijing, Yang Yi said only
that "we have noticed that report, " when a reporter asked about
Beijing's stance on Lee's claims made in a recent interview with
Taiwan media that "he has never advocated Taiwan independence,
nor he is 'the father of independence, ' and he, now just a
member of the public, would like to travel around the world,
including a visit to China."
</P>
<P>
Yang also declined to comment on an unconfirmed report that
Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng is set to visit China
after the Lunar Chinese New Year to attend a ceremony marking the
establishment of a "national association of Taiwanese
enterprises" in China.
</P>
<P>
Yang reiterated only that the Chinese authorities would like to
have contact with any Taiwan individual or organization so long
as they acknowledge the existence of the "one China" policy and
the "92 consensus" for talks on the development of cross-Taiwan
Strait relations and on "eventual peaceful reunification of the
two sides."
</P>
<P>
Taiwan and China are alleged by the opposition Kuomintang to have
reached consensus on the definition of "one China" during
landmark 1992 negotiations in Hong Kong -- the so-called "'92
Consensus" -- but this notion is not held by the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party.
</P>
<P>
The consensus, purported by the KMT to have been agreed upon by
Taiwan and China during the 1992 negotiations, is considered by
Beijing as the basis for its engagement with Taiwan. Beijing
insists on Taiwan's acknowledgement of the consensus as a
condition for the resumption of bilateral dialogue.
