Louis Cha, a famous contemporary Chinese adventure or kungfu
novelist based in Hong Kong, will arrive in Taiwan Thursday for a
visit and book signing.

Cha, better known by his pen name Jinyong, the author of many
martial arts novels which have earned great popularity in
Chinese-speaking world, will pay a visit to his thesis instructor
David McMullen, who is now doing research on Tang dynasty history
at Academia Sinica, the most prestigeous research institute in
Taiwan.

During his stay in Taiwan, Jinyong will also autograph for fans
