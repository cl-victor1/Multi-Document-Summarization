The National Immigration Agency (NIA) will replace old paper
alien resident certificates (ARCs) with electronic cards embedded
with advanced anti-forgery microchips in two stages beginning
July 1, an official said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the move is congruent with the general world trend,
the official said the measure will not only bring new convenience
to foreigners but will also contribute to the government's anti-
forgery and anti-terrorism drives.
</P>
<P>
In the initial stage from July 1 through Dec. 31, the official
said, the NIA under the Ministry of the Interior will issue only
the new ARCs with integrated circuit (IC) chips rather than old
paper cards.
</P>
<P>
"This new measure will apply to new applicants for ARCs and the
permanent ARCs as well as those who need replacement cards," the
official said.
</P>
<P>
In the second phase from Jan. 1 to Dec. 31, 2008, the official
went on, all existing ARC holders will be notified to turn in
their old paper cards in exchange for the electronic ones.
</P>
<P>
The official said the new ARC measures will also apply to the
more than 330,000 international blue-collar workers and
caregivers employed by local manufacturing and construction
companies as well as families with patients in need of long- term
care.
</P>
<P>
According to the official, the new IC ARCs are designed in line
with the electronic international ID cards (eID cards) adopted in
advanced countries to help speed up customs clearance and prevent
forgery as well as help stave off possible terrorist activities,
the official added.
</P>
<P>
NIA data showed that Belgium, Sweden, Italy, Finland, Estonia,
Hong Kong, Mexico, Saudi Arabia and United Arab Emirates have
issued eID cards while the United States, Germany, Norway and
Denmark have issued e-passport to prevent forgery and fight
terrorism, the official added.
