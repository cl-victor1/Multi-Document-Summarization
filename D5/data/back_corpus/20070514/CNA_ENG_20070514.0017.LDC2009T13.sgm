</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  May 14 (CNA) 05/14/07  16:14:09 (By Deborah Kuo)
</P>
<P>
President Chen Shui-bian appointed Straits Exchange Foundation
Chairman Chang Chun-hsiung as the new premier Monday, touting
Chang to be a premier who would know cross-strait affairs better
than any of his predecessors.
</P>
<P>
Chen expressed the hope at a news conference that Chang will be
instrumental in pushing for the completion of cross-strait talks
on the opening of Taiwan to Chinese citizens for sightseeing
visits and of direct cross-strait cargo charter flights at an
early date.
</P>
<P>
It is also hoped that Chang will be instrumental in arranging for
the 2008 Olympic Games torch relay to pass through Taiwan under
conditions where Taiwan's sovereignty will not be downgraded or
compromised, Chen added.
</P>
<P>
The president appointed Chang, 69, who served as the first
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) premier from October 2000
through Jan. 31, 2002, to succeed outgoing Premier Su Tseng-chang
after Su submitted his resignation.
</P>
<P>
Su, who suffered a surprise defeat in the DPP's presidential
primary vote May 6, announced his resignation Saturday, saying
that he would step aside to allow President Chen Shui-bian a free
hand to deal with the changing political situation during the
last year of his tenure.
</P>
<P>
At the news conference, Chen lauded Chang as an adroit politician
who is always capable of "turning even the worst situations
around."
</P>
<P>
Chen said the government will continue to handle cross-strait
relations based on a firm stance and pragmatic strategies, with
the "active management, effective opening" principle serving as
the supreme guidance.
</P>
<P>
Noting that his presidency will come to an end in nearly one
year, Chen recapped his experiences over the past seven years in
office and put forward five directives  for Chang to oversee day-
to-day administration.
</P>
<P>
The five directives are: Insist on Taiwan-centric consciousness
and materialize social  justice;  secure development  with an
environmental-protection mindset; promote what is beneficial and
abolish what is harmful; take good care of the central and
southern regions, middle and lower-echelons of society, and
small- and medium-sized  enterprises;  and run the government
humbly and consolidate Taiwan powerfully.
</P>
<P>
Citing baseball as an example, Chen said that "you never know who
is going to win until the last inning, " adding that the DPP
should make the most of his last year in office to achieve
victory in the 2008 presidential election.
</P>
<P>
For his part, Chang repeated his 2000 motto when he was premier
of "calling for cooperation instead of confrontation and building
homes instead of building walls."
</P>
<P>
Chang stressed that a good statesman should listen to the people
and always believe that the people need to be left alone to
recuperate and build up strength.
</P>
<P>
He called for all political parties to "engage in goodwill
competition  and forsake  mudslinging  politics  and persistent
boycotting, " adding that it is the duty of all political parties
and politicians to live up to the people's expectations.
