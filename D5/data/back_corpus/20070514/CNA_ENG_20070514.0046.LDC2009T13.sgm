Agents of the Bureau of Investigation under the Ministry of
Justice arrested two drug "mules" Monday at the Kaohsiung
International Airport and confiscated half a kilogram of heroin
with a street value of NT$10 million (US$3 million).
</P>
<P>
According to a spokesman for the Bureau of Investigation, Chen
Wen-liang, 41, a handicapped taxi driver, and his friend Ni Hai-
min, also 41, returned from Vietnam Sunday after spending time in
Ho Chi Minh City.
</P>
<P>
Unaware that a mobile unit of the Bureau of Investigation had
been monitoring them for three months, the two men were detained
as they tried to go through immigration.
</P>
<P>
After body searches failed to find any illicit drugs on them, the
agents took the two men to a hospital, where they were X-rayed,
with the results showing that both carried four heroin balls
wrapped in condoms stored in their rectums.
</P>
<P>
It took seven hours until early Monday morning before the two men
passed the drugs.
</P>
<P>
They admitted that they were each treated to a holiday in
Vietnam, with all expenses and the air tickets paid by a drug
ring, which also promised to pay each of them NT$80,000 for
carrying the drugs.
