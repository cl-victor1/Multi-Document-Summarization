ITALIAN HUMAN RIGHTS LEAGUE CHIEF SUPPORTS TAIWAN'S WHO BID
</HEADLINE>

Rome,  May 14 (CNA) 05/14/07  23:21:22 (By Huang Kwang-chun)

An Italian human rights group leader recently wrote  Margaret
Chan,  director- general  of the World  Health Organization (WHO)
, to express his support for Taiwan's bid to join the
organization.
</P>
<P>
Alfredo Arpaia, president of the Italian human rights league
LIDU, said in his letter dated May 8 that the WHO's objective is
the attainment by all peoples of the highest possible level of
health.
</P>
<P>
He expressed his concern that the 23 million people of Taiwan are
still excluded from the WHO system, which, he said, seriously
impairs their ability to respond effectively to epidemic
outbreaks and to receive and provide international aid in case of
disasters and medical emergencies.
</P>
<P>
Exclusion of Taiwan from the WHO is particularly dangerous to
have this loophole in the disease prevention network, he pointed
out, stressing that "global disease prevention cooperation is
needed, for example, to contain the increasingly rapid spread of
avian flu."
</P>
<P>
The human rights activist expressed his hope that Taiwan's bid to
join the WHO will be met with positive response this year, so
that the human rights to health of the 23 million people of
Taiwan will be recognized.
</P>
<P>
"Taiwan has proven to be more than willing to cooperate with
other countries to promote progress and mutual aid in medical and
sanitary issues," he wrote.
