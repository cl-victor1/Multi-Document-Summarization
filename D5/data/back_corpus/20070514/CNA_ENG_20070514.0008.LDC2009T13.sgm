The Air Force will look into whether mechanical problems might
have caused Friday's F-5F jetfighter crash, which left four
people dead and nine others injured, Air Force Chief of Staff
Major Gen. Liu Chen-wu said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Fielding questions at the Legislative Yuan, Liu said that
following preliminary investigations, the Air Force investigators
believe that the pilot and co-pilot of the F-5F had failed to
pull up safely immediately after firing the fighter's guns and
releasing bombs during a rehearsal for Han Kuang 23 military
exercises. The result was that the fighter stalled and crashed
into the ground, he said.

<P>
However, he added that the stall may have been caused by a
mechanical problem.
</P>
<P>
During the several crucial seconds after the stall, the pilots --
instructor Maj. Wei Tzu-yuan and intelligence officer Capt. Chang
Chia-chun -- chose not to eject in order to steer the fighter
away from an industrial zone in Hsinchu County, sacrificing
themselves in an attempt to save lives, he said. The fighter
ended up crashing into a nearby military base in Hukou in the
county.

Along with the two co-pilots, two Singaporean troops on the
ground were also killed in the F-5F crash, which caused a fire at
the barracks housing Singapore Armed Forces (SAF)  soldiers in a
"unilateral training" program. Nine other SAF personnel were
injured, sustaining different degrees of burns.
</P>
<P>
The Air Force grounded all F-5Fs and F-5Es for safety inspections
after the accident.
