President Chen Shui-bian announced Monday at a news conference
his decision to appoint Chang Chun-hsiung, chairman of the quasi-
official Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) , as new premier of
his administration.
</P>
<P>
Chang is succeeding Su Tseng-chang, who offered to resign
Saturday after he lost the ruling Democratic Progressive Party's
presidential primary vote last week to his predecessor, Frank
Hsieh, saying that he would step aside to allow President Chen a
free hand to deal with the changing political situation during
the last year of his tenure.
</P>
<P>
Chang, 69, was the first DPP premier, serving from October 2000
through Jan. 31, 2002.
