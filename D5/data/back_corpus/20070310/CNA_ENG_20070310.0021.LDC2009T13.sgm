TALKS ON KMT TICKET SHOULD FOLLOW MEDIATION: LEGISLATIVE SPEAKER
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  March 10 (CNA) 03/10/07  20:28:45 (By Lilian Wu)

Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng said Saturday that
discussions on who ought to pair up to form the main opposition
Kuomintang's (KMT's) ticket in the 2008 presidential election
should be dealt with following mediation by Lien Chan, honorary
chairman of the party.
</P>
<P>
Wang made the remarks while attending a religious ceremony at a
temple in Yungan Village in the southern county of Kaohsiung.
</P>
<P>
Wang,  a seasoned legislator from southern Taiwan, and Ma Ying-
jou, a former KMT chairman who is popular in northern Taiwan,
have been widely seen as complementary to each other and as
representing the party's best chance of winning back power in the
next presidential election, according to opinion polls.
</P>
<P>
Ma's frontrunner status was cast into uncertainty after he was
indicted on Feb. 13 for his alleged misuse of an "executive
allowance fund" during his two terms as Taipei mayor between 1998
and 2006. He resigned as chairman of the party only hours after
being indicted but also said at the time that he would definitely
run in the next presidential election.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Wang, who lost to Ma in the bitter party chairmanship
election in 2005, has reportedly been keen on becoming the
standardbearer for the party. However, he has yet to officially
announce his bid to run, saying "there is no hurry to do so."
</P>
<P>
KMT acting Chairman Wu Poh-hsiung said earlier this week that
both Ma and Wang agreed to invite the other to serve as their
running mate if chosen by the KMT as its candidate for the
presidential election.
</P>
<P>
However, Wang dismissed the report, describing it as fabricated
news and saying that it is still "too early" to talk about the
issue. He also said that it is possible that the KMT's
presidential ticket might not even include Ma or himself.
</P>
<P>
Sources said Saturday that Wang has assumed a low profile in
recent days, adding that he could visit Thailand next week and
make a decision on whether to bid for the presidency after his
return.
</P>
<P>
Wang, at the invitation of Taiwan businesspeople in Thailand,
might visit the country March 17-19, although he has yet to make
a final decision, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
Wang said recently  that once he decides to run for the
presidency, he will not announce it on or before March 17, which
is his birthday and a day that he traditionally meets with
reporters at a gathering.
</P>
<P>
This means that Wang is most likely to announce his bid between
late March and early April when the registration for the party's
primary ends.
</P>
<P>
If Lien's mediation among the party hopefuls fails to produce a
result, then the primary, to be comprised of a party member vote
and public opinion polls, will be held and the party's candidate
will be announced May 26.
