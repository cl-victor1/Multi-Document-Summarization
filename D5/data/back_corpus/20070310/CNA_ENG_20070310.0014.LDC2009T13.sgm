ANTI-SECESSION LAW HOBBLES DEVELOPMENT OF CROSS-STRAIT TIES: MAC
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

Taipei,   March   10  (CNA) 03/10/07  14:02:07 (By Sofia Wu)
</P>
<P>
The enactment  of the so-called Anti-Secession Law in China two
years ago has exacerbated the political and military standoff
between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait and posed a tremendous
obstacle to the development of cross-strait relations, the
Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The country's top China policy planning agency made the comments
in a press statement issued ahead of the upcoming second
anniversary of Beijing's passage of the controversial
legislation.
</P>
<P>
Since the enactment of the law which mandates the use of force
against Taiwan if the island seeks formal independence, the MAC
statement said, China has largely increased its military budget
and accelerated its military buildup against Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
In the past few years, the statement said, China has deployed
more than 1,000 ballistic missiles targeting Taiwan along its
southeastern coast to intensify its military intimidation of
Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Besides reinforcing its combat preparedness against Taiwan, the
statement said, China has also continued increasing its annual
military spending at a double- digit rate in an obvious attempt
to achieve global dominance and hegemony, posing a grave threat
to regional security and stability.
</P>
<P>
As the law defines cross-strait relations based on China's
cherished concept that "there is only one China and Taiwan is
part of China, " the statement said, China has never hesitated to
use its political, diplomatic and economic clout to even more
grossly and blatantly work to suppress Taiwan in the
international community since the passage of the legislation.
</P>
<P>
While stubbornly ignoring the Taiwan people's aspiration for
normalization of their national development, China has wrongly
interpreted all of Taiwan's steps to deepen its democratic
system, such as its constitutional re-engineering and name-
rectification drives,  as actions to promote de jure independence
and has mercilessly smeared Taiwan in the world arena, the
statement said, adding that its criticism of Taiwan has become
even more emphatic and scathing in recent months.
</P>
<P>
Since the passage of the Anti-Secession Law, the statement
continued, China has also stepped up its carrot-and-stick
strategy toward Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
While granting favors to specific groups in Taiwan to realize its
political objectives, the statement said, China has continued to
avoid contact with Taiwan's popularly elected government and head
of state, impeding progress toward the goal of normalizing cross-
strait ties.
</P>
<P>
Worse still, the statement said, China has continued to work on
complementary legal bills since the enactment of the Anti-
Secession Law to facilitate its future military action against
Taiwan. The National People's Congress -- China's rubber-stamp
parliament -- has passed the first reading of a bill on the
declaration of state of emergency, which is scheduled to be
enacted by the end of this year. China also plans to screen a
draft national defense mobilization bill later this year.
</P>
<P>
Noting that all of these legislative moves are part of China's
pre-emptive efforts to incorporate Taiwan into the application of
its emergency decree, the statement said, the Anti-Secession Law
heralded the start of the series of "evil laws" against Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Referring to Chinese Foreign Minister Li Zhaoxing's recent
bellicose remarks that "the Anti-Secession Law is not something
to be shelved to gather dust, " the MAC statement said Li's
rhetoric expressly reflects the irrationality of China's policy
toward Taiwan and its leaders' lack of democratic thinking.
</P>
<P>
Despite all of China's hostility against Taiwan, the statement
said, Taiwan's government will maintain its longstanding cross-
strait policy that prizes democracy and peace and will continue
pulling out all the stops to create opportunities for
constructive interaction and to resolve bilateral disputes
through dialogue.
</P>
<P>
The MAC statement also urged the international community never to
relax their concern about the post-Anti-Secession Law
developments in cross-strait relations and about the possibility
of China adopting non-peaceful means against Taiwan in order to
safeguard Taiwan's young democracy and lasting peace in the Asia-
Pacific region.
