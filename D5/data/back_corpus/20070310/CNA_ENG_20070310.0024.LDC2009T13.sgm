Taipei,  March  10 (CNA) 03/10/07  22:36:18 (By Lilian Wu)

Beijing's enactment of the so-called Anti-Secession Law two years
ago has divided Taiwan and hampered the normal development of
cross-strait relations, Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) Chairman
Joseph Wu said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The nation's top China policy charter made the remarks during an
interview on the "The Cross-Strait Issues" radio program of the
Taipei-based Broadcasting Corporation of China.
</P>
<P>
Wu said that the Taiwan people have acutely felt that the Anti-
Secession Law, passed March 14, 2005, is aimed at changing the
status quo in the Taiwan Strait. The law defines Taiwan as "part
of China" and authorizes the use of "non- peaceful means" against
Taiwan should the island move toward formal independence.
</P>
<P>
Based on the same spirit as the law, China has engaged in
exchanges with Taiwan's opposition parties, instead of the
popularly elected government, in an attempt to create a wedge
within Taiwan society, Wang said.
</P>
<P>
China has also used the law as a basis for expanding its military
might under the pretext of needing to strengthen its hand against
Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
He noted that China's military spending grew by around 14 percent
in 2005 and around 15 percent in 2006 and that the increase in
its military budget for this year is nearly 18 percent.
</P>
<P>
Wu noted that China fired a missile into space to shoot down an
obsolete weather satellite on Jan. 11 and that recently, five
Type 094 nuclear-powered guided ballistic missile submarines were
commissioned into service, demonstrating the rapid increase in
China's military might and its attempt to increase its
international clout.
