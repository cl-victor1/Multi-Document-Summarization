The Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) has helped increase the
total output of traditional industries by over NT$30 billion
(US$911 million) during the last six years after investing
NT$1.22 billion in the sector, MOEA officials said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The ministry plans to invest another NT$300 million this year
with the aim of increasing the total output by NT$6.8 billion,
the officials said.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the sector has played an important role in Taiwan's
economic development, the officials said that in 2005, there were
66,000 companies in the traditional industry sector, or 85.5
percent of the entire manufacturing industry sector.
</P>
<P>
In the same year, the traditional industry sector's production
value posted NT$7.2 trillion, which represented 67.5 percent of
the manufacturing  output, while the employed  population  in the
traditional industries was 1.685 million, or 69.3 percent of the
manufacturing industry sector, the officials went on.
</P>
<P>
In 2001, the MOEA launched a project offering a maximum subsidy
of NT$1.6 million to "promising" traditional companies, selected
by experts and scholars hired by the MOEA, to help them develop
new technologies, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
The ministry provided NT$1.22 billion in a total of 797 cases
between 2001 and 2006, increasing the total production value of
the sector by NT$35.267 billion, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
Due to the success of the project, the MOEA has decided to raise
the total amount of the subsidy to NT$300 million in 2007, and
plans to further increase it to NT$400 million in 2008 to benefit
more companies, the officials added.
