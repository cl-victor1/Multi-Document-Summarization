GOVERNMENT RETAINS CONTROL OVER MEGA HOLDINGS
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Taipei,  June 23 (CNA) (By Han Nai-kuo)
</P>
<P>
The partially state-owned Mega Financial Holding Co. remained under
government control Friday after an apparent maneuver by the Cabinet
turned unfavorable results in a board of directors election to its
advantage.
</P>
<P>
Holding 22.78 percent of Mega Financial's shares, the government
managed to capture only seven seats and lost its majority on the
15-member board, including seven representing private shareholders and
one independent member.
</P>
<P>
However, at a meeting held after the election, the new board re-
elected Cheng Shen-chih as chairman, which was followed by
resignations of the independent board member and another member
representing private shareholders, leaving the government's seven
seats in control of the 13-member board.
</P>
<P>
A by-election to fill the two vacancies is impossible without approval
by two-thirds of board members.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the new development, Vice Premier Tsai Ing-wen said the
Cabinet is "not entirely satisfied" with the results, although it had
achieved its goal.
</P>
<P>
She added that the Cabinet will closely supervise future developments
involving Mega Financial Holding Co. and safeguard the public's
interest in the financial institution.
</P>
<P>
Tsai stressed that the government will be in full control of Mega
Financial for at least the next three years.
</P>
<P>
The dramatic turn of events dissolved a crisis for Premier Su Tseng-
chang and Minister of Finance Joseph Lyu, who had faced pressure from
opposition legislators to step down if the government should lose its
operational control over Mega Financial's NT$2.13 trillion (US$65.23
billion) in capital.
</P>
<P>
Mega Financial, Taiwan's second largest financial service company, was
formed by state-owned Chiao Tung Bank and International Securities Co.
through an exchange of shares in 2002 under the government's financial
reform program.
</P>
<P>
Cheng, who serves concurrently as chairman of Chiao Tung Bank,
announced after the board meeting that when Chiao Tung Bank is merged
with the Internal Commercial Bank of China Aug. 21, he will no longer
be the chairman of the expanded entity.
</P>
<P>
Cheng also assured that he will not allow Chinatrust Financial Holding
Co. to buy Mega Financial in the next three years.
</P>
<P>
Chinatrust has increased its shares in Mega Financial from 12 percent
to 15 percent in recent months and is reportedly aiming to eventually
take it over.
