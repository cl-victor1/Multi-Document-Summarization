American Institute in Taipei Director Stephen M. Young Tuesday
expressed confidence in Taiwan's economic development but urged
Taiwan to engage in closer economic relations with China.
</P>
<P>
Delivering a speech at the American Chamber of Commerce's annual
New Year banquet, Young said that although some people have said
that Taiwan's economy is hollowing out as manufacturing moves
overseas, he sees it as improving, adding that Taiwan is farther
up the supply chain, developing more advanced technologies and
becoming more competitive in finance, logistics and other
services.
</P>
<P>
He praised recent legislation creating an intellectual property
court as an important step toward better protection for
intellectual property rights, which is a priority in the
U.S.-Taiwan Trade and Investment Framework Agreement (TIFA).
</P>
<P>
Young also welcomed the institutionalized cross-Taiwan Strait
passenger charter flights for four major holidays, as well as
measures that allow more Chinese employees of American companies
to travel to Taiwan for business meetings.
</P>
<P>
He said closer economic relations between Taiwan and China will
expose PRC firms and executives to higher standards of corporate
governance and best business practices.
</P>
<P>
"Taiwan firms can do even more, " he suggested, "for example by
applying this island's rigorous environmental standards to your
operations in China, thereby making an important contribution in
an emerging battleground against global warming."
