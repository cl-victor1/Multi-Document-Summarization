The Council for Economic Planning and Development (CEPD) will
release a report in six months on whether Taiwan should lift its
ban on casinos in a bid to boost local tourism, the deputy head
of the nation's top economic planning agency said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
CEPD Vice Chairman Chang Ching-sen told reporters that a debate
on the issue has been going on for more than 10 years and that
the CEPD will present its report and make related
recommendations.
</P>
<P>
Noting that originally the debate centered around whether casinos
should be built on outlying islands such as Penghu, Chang said
the CEPD is likely to broaden the scope and consider whether
casinos could also be built in economically less-privileged areas
on Taiwan proper.
</P>
<P>
Chang said the CEPD will collect information from different
countries and borrow from their experiences.
</P>
<P>
Citing Singapore as the most recent example, he noted that
Singapore lifted a four-decade ban on casinos in 2005 and allowed
the construction of two casino resorts in the hope of bringing in
more tourists and revenue from overseas.
</P>
<P>
"The final answer to the question of whether Taiwan should allow
casinos will depend on public opinion and will hinge on the
Legislative Yuan's decision," he said.
