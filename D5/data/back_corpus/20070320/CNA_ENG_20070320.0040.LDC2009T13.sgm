Keelung City Council Speaker Chang Tong-rong of the main
opposition Kuomintang (KMT) has beaten Lawmaker Liu Wen-hsiung of
opposition People First Party (PFP) in two polls conducted for
the Keelung mayoral by-election, a KMT party official announced
in that northern port city Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The results of the polls were announced at a press conference by
Lee Po-yuan, head of the KMT's local headquarter in Keelung.
</P>
<P>
Lee said at the news conference that he has just received a call
from a high- ranking KMT official, who said that Chang topped Liu
in both two polls.
</P>
<P>
The KMT and PFP conducted the polls in order to choose a joint
candidate in the by-election slated for May 12.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the party has not yet notified him of the details of
the polls, Lee said that his party will formally nominate the
speaker as its candidate after getting KMT Central Standing
Committee approval Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Chang welcomed the results and thanked the public for their
support, adding that it is up to Liu to decide whether or not he
will keep his promise and step aside.
</P>
<P>
Liu, however, questioned about the fairness of the polls and
reaffirmed his determination to run for the post.
