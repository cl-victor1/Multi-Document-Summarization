All military recruits must complete a 3km run in 15 minutes, six
months after enrolling, Ministry of National Defense (MND)
spokesman Wu Chi-fang said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Wu made the announcement in response to media inquiries on the
physical fitness of military personnel at a press conference held
at the MND after news reports saying that Legislator Trong R.
Chai, who serves as acting chairman of the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party, was concerned with the poor physical fitness
of active soldiers and military officers.
</P>
<P>
Chai recently expressed his willingness to challenge military
generals, including Minister of National Defense Jye Lee to
physical contests, according to reports.
</P>
<P>
At the news conference, Wu explained the military has adopted the
globally- circulated physical fitness standards, and that all
military officers serving in the crucial positions have
maintained a good physical fitness condition. "Every media
reporter who is familiar with these officers should have known
that," he said.
</P>
<P>
Wu also publicized the military's existing standards for physical
fitness performance of new enrollees upon completion of basic
training one to three months after enrollment, includes doing a
3km run in 19 minutes, 25 sit-ups, 28 push-ups, and two chin-ups.
</P>
<P>
However, the criteria were criticized by reporters attending the
press conference as too low to produce strong military personnel.
</P>
<P>
Wu explained that there are different physical fitness standards
in the different branches of military service, noting what he had
earlier mentioned are the basic criteria for new recruits.
