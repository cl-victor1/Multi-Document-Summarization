The Investment Commission under the Ministry of Economic Affairs
(MOEA) approved Tuesday an application by Taiwan Semiconductor
Manufacturing Co. (TSMC) to use 0.18-micron chip manufacturing
technology at its wafer foundry in China.
</P>
<P>
It marked the first investment project approved by the MOEA since
the government allowed Taiwan semiconductor manufacturers to move
0.18-micron chip manufacturing technology to China in December
2006.
</P>
<P>
After receiving approval, TSMC will upgrade the manufacturing
technology of its 8-inch wafer foundry in Shanghai from
0.25-micron to 0.18-micro processing technology.
</P>
<P>
In addition to TSMC's investment project, ProMOS Technologies
Co., which passed policy-related screening last year over its
plan to relocate its 8-inch wafer plant using the 0.25-micron
manufacturing technology to China, has also filed a similar
application with the Investment Commission.
