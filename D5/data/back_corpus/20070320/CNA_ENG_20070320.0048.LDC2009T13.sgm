<P>
The Ministry of Finance (MOF) will suggest to the Government
Information Office (GIO) that it replace Taiwan Television
Enterprise Ltd. (TTV) Chairman Lai Kuo- chou, who was elected to
head the state-controlled TV station in his capacity as the
government's representative, an MOF official said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Noting that Lai has bought a part of TTV's stocks from TTV's
Japanese investors, the official said the MOF believes that Lai
is no longer suitable to represent the government in the TTV's
management.
</P>
<P>
Where he is transferred to is up to the GIO, the MOF official
said.
</P>
<P>
Lai is the son-in-law of former President Lee Teng-hui.
