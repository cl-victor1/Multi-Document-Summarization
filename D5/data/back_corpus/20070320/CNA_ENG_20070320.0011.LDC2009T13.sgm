Dallas, Texas, March 19 (CNA) 03/20/07  12:58:45 (By Chang Hui-

Visiting Republic of China Minister of Foreign Affairs James
Huang saluted Monday the strong backing that overseas Taiwan
businesspeople around the world have given the government, saying
that "Taiwan is great because of you."
</P>
<P>
Addressing a board meeting of the World Taiwanese Chambers of
Commerce (WTCC), being held in Dallas March 16-19, Huang praised
the Taiwanese businesspeople for their never-ending support for
the government and people back in Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Huang claimed, however, that some media reports have misled the
overseas Taiwanese on many issues, causing them to worry about
Taiwan's situation or misunderstand the sitting administration.
</P>
<P>
Actually, Huang said, Taiwan has fared well and continued to make
progress in all areas over the past seven years under the
governance of the Democratic Progressive Party.
</P>
<P>
He recapped the progress achieved in Taiwan under the DPP
administration -- including overall economic growth of 4.62
percent in 2006, far ahead of previous forecasts; a 150-percent
increase in foreign exchange reserves since 2000 to US$266.1
billion in 2006; a six-year low unemployment rate of only 3.91
percent last year; an inflation rate of just 0.6 percent, far
lower than initial forecasts of 2 percent; and total trade
topping US$426.7 billion.
</P>
<P>
Huang said that he feels privileged to address the second board
meeting  of the 13th WTCC,  which  is being attended  by an
unprecedentedly large number of members and guests,  including
Taiwanese business leaders from around the world, members of the
U.S. Congress, and legislators from across Taiwan's political
spectrum.
</P>
<P>
During the four-day WTCC board meeting, Chiling Tong, a deputy
assistant secretary for Asia and the Pacific of the International
Trade Administration under the U.S. Department of Commerce,
delivered a keynote speech on Asian Americans and their economic
activities in the United States.
</P>
<P>
Others speaking at the gathering included Taiwan External Trade
Development Council Chairman Hsu Chih-jen and Tseng San-pao, a
department chief from the Ministry of Economic Affairs.
</P>
<P>
Huang, who arrived in Dallas Saturday, is scheduled to depart
Texas for home Monday night after the meeting concludes.
