VIETNAMESE WOMAN DEDICATED TO NARROWIING TAIWAN-VIETNAM GAP

Taipei,  June 3 (CNA) 06/03/07  15:53:57 (By Maubo Chang)

A Vietnamese woman married to a Taiwanese man is challenging the
widely held idea among the Taiwanese that Southeast Asian wives
are poor women with low education who can hardly speak Mandarin,
as she has just earned a master's degree from the Graduate School
of Family Studies and Child Development at Shih Chien University
in Taipei and has vowed to serve as a cultural bridge between
Taiwan and her homeland.
</P>
<P>
The circumstance that led Tran Thi Hoang Phuong to her master's
began a decade ago when she was a student at the National Law
School of Ho Chih Minh City in Vietnam. She worked part-time
after school and encountered a young Taiwanese man, Chien Chih-
chung, who was posted there by a Taiwanese firm.
</P>
<P>
She married Chien in 1993 and raised two children in Ho Chih Minh
City until 2001, when she moved to Taipei with her husband.
</P>
<P>
As a university graduate with a bachelor's degree in law, Tran
Thi has good command of Chinese language because of the affinity
between Vietnamese law and Chinese law, which stood her in good
stead while trying to adapt to life in Taipei.
</P>
<P>
However, she was annoyed by local news stories about "foreign
brides" -- a term used by local people to refer to Southeast
Asian women who married to Taiwanese -- as most of them are
negative, portraying these women as being treated by their in-
laws as tools for breeding, caring for disabled family members,
earning money, or working as prostitutes.
</P>
<P>
In order to help those foreign brides, Tran Thi began to serve as
a voluntary interpreter at the Women and Children's Hospital in
Taipei, which has opened a clinic exclusively for foreign brides.
</P>
<P>
Tran Thi's experiences at the hospital offered her a chance to
make friends with many Vietnamese women who confided in her about
their miserable lives in Taiwan, mainly relating to getting along
with husbands and in-laws, raising children, adapting to local
society and obtaining social support.
</P>
<P>
From these women's stories,  one gets the impression that
Taiwanese are unfriendly, shameless and cruel, but Tran Thi
thought this could not be right as she had seen many Taiwanese
volunteers in the hospital who are generous, considerate and
compassionate.
</P>
<P>
Believing  the cause of the problem lies in the lack of
understanding between Taiwanese men and their foreign spouses --
such men do not get to know their wives but simply buy them from
brokers -- Tran Thi began to teach Vietnamese language
voluntarily to help local people to know about her homeland,
first in classes opened by the Taipei city government at the
Wanhua Household Registration Office, then at the Chungshan
Community College, National Open University and National Chen Chi
University.
</P>
<P>
Her students include Vietnamese womens' husbands and children,
businessmen interested in exploring the Vietnamese market and
university students engaged in Southeast Asian studies.
</P>
<P>
At the same time she decided to enroll at the Shih Chien
University graduate program because she wanted to offer
professional counselling to foreign brides who encounter
difficulties in marriage rather than just giving them a
sympathetic ear.
</P>
<P>
While studying at Shih Chien University, she organized the
Development Association of Vietnamese Women in Taipei and
published the Vietnam Women monthly catering to her female
compatriots living in Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Tran Thi said local people should value the alien culture brought
in by these foreign brides and put it to good use in enriching
the culture of Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
The foreign brides, Tran Thi said, should be proud of their own
culture and teach their children to treasure their opportunities
of being exposed to two different cultures.
</P>
<P>
After getting the master's degree this summer, Tran Thi plans to
pursue adoctoral degree so that she can help more people, not
least the foreign brides.
