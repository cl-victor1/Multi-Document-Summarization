The Government Information Office (GIO) defended  its program  to
help  foreign news  workers  study Chinese-language in Taiwan
with scholarship Sunday, saying that it will help bolster
international exchanges and eventually increase foreign media's
understanding of the country.
</P>
<P>
The GIO is collaborating with the Ministry of Education to offer
monthly grants of NT$25,000 (US$757) to each of the initial 10
recipients beginning in April, GIO Deputy Minister Yih Jung-tzung
said in a written statement.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese learning program will let members of international
media outlets perceive that Taiwan is the best place in the world
to learn the Chinese language and gain a better understanding of
Taiwan's democratization,  the diversity of Taiwan society and
amiability of the Taiwan people, Yih said.
</P>
<P>
As of April this year, Yih said, journalists from seven renowned
media outlets in the United States, the United Kingdom, Germany,
Japan, Turkey and Thailand had applied for the scholarships.
</P>
<P>
Yih described as "farfetched" an Apple Daily report Sunday
claiming that the GIO is trying to "curry favor" with foreign
reporters by offering them a three-month grant of NT$75,000 for
the Chinese learning program, which at normal language centers
operated by several leading universities would cost only around
NT$30,000.
