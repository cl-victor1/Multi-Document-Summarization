Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng urged Taiwan's voters to
put the opposition Kuomintang (KMT) back in power by voting for
the party's presidential candidate, Ma Ying-jeou, in the 2008
election.
</P>
<P>
At a luncheon with more than 100 university principals and
professors, Wang said it is time that the KMT replaced the
Democratic Progressive Party as the ruling party because the
people of Taiwan expect it.
</P>
<P>
Wang said that although he turned down Ma's offer at the end of
last month to serve as his running mate, he will do his best to
help Ma with his election campaign.
</P>
<P>
He said the most important thing for the near future is to unite
voters in different sectors of society to help Ma get elected in
March 2008.
</P>
<P>
Wang added that after Taiwan's first "rotation of political
power" in 2000, the time has now come for a second rotation to
answer the people's wish that the KMT return to power.
