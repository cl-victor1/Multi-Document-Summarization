Premier Chang Chun-hsiung said Sunday that he is open to the
notion of a no- confidence vote by the Legislature to topple the
Cabinet under his leadership.
</P>
<P>
Chang said he respects the ideas of the lawmakers and President
Chen Shui-bian whether his Cabinet should be toppled so as to
permit the president to dissolve the Legislature and have new
legislators elected.
</P>
<P>
Chang made the remarks when he talked to reporters at Grand Hotel
where he attended a national drug control conference.

<P>
Ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) Legislator Chen Chin-de
-- indignant at long-term stand-off in the opposition-dominated
Legislature,  which  he said has in turn  seriously  impeded
administrative operations -- proposed last week a no-confidence
vote so that the Chang-led Cabinet could be toppled to pave the
way for President Chen to dissolve the Legislative Yuan.
</P>
<P>
Chen Chin-de's proposal was favorably received by DPP lawmakers.
