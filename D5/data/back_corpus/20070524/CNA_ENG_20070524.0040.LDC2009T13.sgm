POLITICAL CONSIDERATIONS PREVENT RARE CRANE FROM RETURNING HOME

Political considerations are preventing a stranded rare crane
from being returned to its original habitat in northeastern
China, Taipei Mayor Hau Lung- bin said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Hau made the remarks in a question-and-answer session at the
Taipei City Council where independent Councilor Lin Jui-tu showed
a paper issued by China's Cha-Lung Nature Reserve, a center
dedicated to the protection of waterfowl, commissioning him to
assist in sending the red-crowned crane back to its natural
habitat in China. If this is not possible, it is willing to send
three red-crowned cranes to Taiwan to accompany the stranded
crane, Lin said.

<P>
The bird was injured at Hsinchu Air Base in September 2004 and
taken to the Taipei City Zoo for treatment, where it has remained
since.
</P>
<P>
Hau said that although all efforts have been made toward
returning the crane to China, the problem lies with "the
governments on each side of the Taiwan Strait, which are too pre-
occupied with political and ideological considerations."
</P>
<P>
Responding to suggestions that the crane be released into the
wild, Hau said this might not be feasible, noting that it has
been kept in a cage for nearly three years and that its flight
ability has degenerated.
</P>
<P>
"What the city government  can do is to provide it with
protection," Hau said, adding that the city government has no
desire to keep the bird in Taiwan indefinitely.
</P>
<P>
He said that during his stint as president of the Red Cross
Society in 2004-2006, he had contacts with his counterpart in
China on the matter.
</P>
<P>
He also communicated with the Council of Agriculture (COA)
recently, but said that as the crane is on the protection list of
the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of
Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES), it requires consent from China
before the bird can be sent there.
</P>
<P>
Zoo officials said recently that they will continue to provide it
with live food and cut human interference in an effort to
rekindle its distrust of humans, in the hope that this will help
it re-adapt to the wild in China once the two governments give
the green light.
