Academia Sinica, ranks first in the country in terms of the
frequency with which its research papers were cited by other
papers over the past decade, the institute's president, Chi-huey
Wong, said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Wong said the institute's research paper citation frequency was
recorded at 8.39 for the period, higher than National University
of Singapore's 6.41 and the China-based Chinese Academy of
Sciences' 4.22
</P>
<P>
Wong pointed out that while the institute's research papers were
cited more frequently on average than those of other institutes
based in the other three Asian Dragon countries -- namely South
Korea, Singapore, Hong Kong -- researchers at Academia Sinica
received relatively lower salaries than their counterparts in
these three countries.
</P>
<P>
The average salary of the researchers in South Korea was roughly
twice that of the researchers at Academia Sinica for the period,
while the average salary of researchers in Singapore and Hong
Kong was about three to four times higher, according to Wong.
</P>
<P>
Wong said he expects salaries for researchers at the institute to
be raised to a level that reflects the institute's top ranking in
terms of research paper citation frequency in order to make the
researchers more willing to stay.
