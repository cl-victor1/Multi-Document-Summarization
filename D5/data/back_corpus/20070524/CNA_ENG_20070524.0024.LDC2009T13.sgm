Vice President Annette Lu repeated Thursday her proposal that the
country reorganize its self-governing political units into four
provinces and two special administrative regions.
</P>
<P>
Speaking during a luncheon with members of the local media in
Taichung, central Taiwan, Lu said that only by reorganizing the
country's self-governing systems into four provinces and two
special administrative  regions can Taiwan seek to achieve
sustainable development.
</P>
<P>
There are currently  three levels  of local self-governing
organizations in Taiwan: special municipalities, which are under
the direct jurisdiction of the Executive Yuan; counties and
provincial municipalities, under provincial jurisdiction; and
townships and county municipalities, under county governments.
</P>
<P>
Lu said she does not think it makes much sense to establish more
special municipalities around the country, which currently has
two -- namely Taipei and Kaohsiung.
</P>
<P>
The vice president labeled Taipei County's "upgrading" to the
level of a de facto special municipality as an "electioneering"
move. She also expressed doubts about the feasibility of Taichung
City achieving its goal of becoming another de facto special
municipality.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Lu urged Frank Hsieh, who is set to be the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party's presidential candidate in 2008,
and Ma Ying-jeou, the opposition Kuomintang's 2008 presidential
candidate, to organize their "diplomacy teams" as soon as
possible as a means of counteracting Beijing's "persistent
schemes to oppress and contain Taiwan in the international
community."
</P>
<P>
Lu advised  Hsieh  and Ma not to underestimate  Beijing's
determination "to strangle Taiwan in the world diplomatic arena,
" saying that if Taiwan is completely excluded from the
international community as a result of China's suppression, the
country "will be broken and presidential elections will become
impossible."
