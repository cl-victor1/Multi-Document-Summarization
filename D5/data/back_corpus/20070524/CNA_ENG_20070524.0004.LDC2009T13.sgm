A television commercial by a convenience store chain showing a
singer eating cold noodles in a refrigerator has triggered
apprehension among parents worried that their children might
imitate and get trapped in a refrigerator, executives of the
Consumers' Foundation told a press conference Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The executives said the foundation had received numerous phone
calls from parents worried about a possible copycat effect.
</P>
<P>
The commercial produced by the 7-Eleven convenience chain store
to promote its cold noodles for the summer season shows a well-
known singer crouching in a refrigerator eating cold noodles.
</P>
<P>
Although the 10-second commercial bears a written warning that
children should not imitate the stunt, Consumer's Foundation
workers claimed the characters are too small and that they are
not on screen long enough for viewers to read them.
</P>
<P>
The Consumer's Foundation urged 7-Eleven to think of the possible
influence on the public when it makes TV commercials in the
future.
</P>
<P>
The 7-Eleven public relations department explained that the
commercial in question had already been withdrawn last week after
the National Communications Commission informed the company in a
letter that it was inappropriate.
</P>
<P>
The Consumer's Foundation cautioned parents to keep a watchful
eye on their children because children can die if they get
trapped in a refrigerator.
