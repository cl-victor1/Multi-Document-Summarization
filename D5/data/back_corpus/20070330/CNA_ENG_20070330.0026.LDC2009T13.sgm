A Web site called the "Business Gateway to the Pacific Islands"
began operating Friday, offering the latest economic and trade
information about Taiwan's six Pacific allies to Taiwanese
businessmen, an official of the Ministry of Economic Affairs
(MOEA) said that same day.
</P>
<P>
These allies are: the Republic of Palau, Tuvalu, the Republic of
the Marshall Islands, the Solomon Islands, the Republic of
Kiribati, and the Republic of Nauru.
</P>
<P>
According to the official, the purpose of this Web site is to
encourage "economic  partnerships"  as promised  in the Palau
Declaration that President Chen Shui-bian signed with the heads
of these six allies when he attended the First Taiwan-Pacific
Allies Summit in November, 2006.
</P>
<P>
The MOEA's Bureau of Foreign Trade authorized the Taiwan External
Trade Development Council (TAITRA) to build the Web site, which
integrates data and information on the six allies' overall trade
and economic environment from the bureau, TAITRA, and MOEA's
Department of Investment Services, for reference by Taiwanese
firms.
</P>
<P>
Taiwanese businessmen may also acquire information on activities
in foreign countries, such as seminars or visiting delegations of
Taiwan's six Pacific allies,  via related links at the site:
