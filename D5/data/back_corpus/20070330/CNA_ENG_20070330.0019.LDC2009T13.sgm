FOUNDATION CRITICIZES AIDS POLICY THAT IGNORES DISEASE PREVENTION

Taipei,  March  30 (CNA) 03/30/07  17:32:52 (By Elizabeth Hsu)

The non-profit Taiwan AIDS Foundation criticized Friday the
government's AIDS policy, claiming that the number of people
contracting AIDS in Taiwan has not decreased despite of the use
of an effective cocktail therapy invented by Chinese American
molecular biologist David Ho.
</P>
<P>
In Taiwan the number of AIDS patients has grown, on average, by
15-20 percent annually over the past 10 years, the foundation
said. In 2005, the number of new patients increased 1.24 times
over the previous year's level, the largest ever surge in new
infections in Taiwan, according to the organization, which also
said the number of the patients who contracted the disease
through drug injections posted a three-fold increase between
2002-2005 to reach 1,463 people.
</P>
<P>
However, funds the government set aside for programs to guard
against the spread of HIV-AIDS has fallen every year in
comparison with the money budgeted for AIDS treatment, the
foundation said, noting that the government budgeted NT$1.2
billion (US$36 million) for AIDS treatment this year, but only
NT$67 million for efforts to prevent and control the spread of
AIDS, down NT$7 million from the level in 2005.
</P>
<P>
Foundation Chairman Twu Shiing-jer, a former minister of health,
said at a news conference held on the use of cocktail therapy in
Taiwan that the foundation has found that the government  is
implementing a "biased" counter-AIDS policy -- concentrating most
sources in medical treatment and checks.
</P>
<P>
Twu blamed the situation on a fact that some people wrongly
believed that the cocktail therapy can cure the mortal disease
after it proved successful in prolonging the lives of AIDS
patients.
</P>
<P>
At the news conference, Shi Wen-yi, deputy director of the Center
for Disease Control under the Department of Health (DOH) ,
admitted that existing measures of public health education, as
well as those for AIDS prevention and control, need to be
improved and reinforced as the number of people contracting AIDS
through sexual intercourse continues to steadily rise.
</P>
<P>
Shi said that the cocktail therapy allows AIDS patients to lead a
normal life by reducing the HIV virus load in their bodies.
However, with more and more AIDS patients needing the medical
treatment, the DOH has been forced to spend more money on
providing the drug cocktail and conducting medical examinations:
funds which annually come at the expense of programs targeting
disease prevention and control, the official explained.
</P>
<P>
According to the foundation, in the seventh year since Taiwan
adopted the cocktail therapy, funds targeting AIDS prevention and
control amounted to only 15 percent of those provided for medical
treatment. That ratio dropped to 5 percent in 2007, the 10th year
of Taiwan's use of the innovative therapy.
