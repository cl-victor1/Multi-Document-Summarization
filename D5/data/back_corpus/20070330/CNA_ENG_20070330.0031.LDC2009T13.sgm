Dozens of workers from state-run Chunghwa Telecom Co. (CHT)
staged a protest Friday in front of the CHT southern Taiwan
branch in Kaohsiung, voicing their anger and discontent over the
management's "inhumane" moves to force employees and workers to
leave the company in a drive to streamline personnel.

<P>
CHT Workers' Union Chairman Chang Hsu-chung led the protesters
amid a ceremony held in the branch company to mark a changeover
of deputy general managers at the branch. Legislator Kuan Bi-ling
of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party appeared at the site
to show her support for the protest.

<P>
The protesters claim that since CHT Chairman Ho Chen-tan ordered
the streamlining of 1,600 positions at the company last year,
there have been many employees and workers expressing their
intention to commit suicide because of "inhumane treatment" from
the management, including "work overload" and "illegal workplace
changes" aimed at forcing veteran workers and employees to leave
the company.

Chang said Tan Chung-hsih, 47, was an excellent technician at the
CHT's generator room in Fengshan in Kaohsiung County. He hang
himself in the generator room last September due to workplace
pressures, Chang said, noting that Tan left behind a wife,
children and his father aged above 80.

On Wednesday, Chang further said, a female employee at the client
services department attempted to jump out of the building where
she works after complaining about the company's move to transfer
her to the marketing department. Fortunately union executives
persuaded her to abandon the suicide attempt, He went on to claim
that management's strategies to force "redundant workers" to
leave or retire are against the law.

CHT management declined to comment on the protest.

According to the CHT Workers' Union, the organization will hold a
non-confidence vote on Ho among 26,000 CHT employees April 9-May
15, while planning to stage another round of protests May 1 at
both CHT headquarters in Taipei and the Ministry of
Transportation and Communications.
