Shanghai,  March  30 (CNA) 03/30/07  17:46:53 (By Kuo Mei-lan and

The Chinese boy who received a bone marrow transplant from a
Taiwanese donor two days ago is doing fine after the surgery,
doctors from the Shanghai Children's Medical Center said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The three-year-old boy, surnamed Chiu, who has suffered from an
inherited form of anemia thalassemia, received 600-700
milliliters of stem cells provided by Taiwan's Tzu Chi Bone
Marrow and Stem Cell Center in a transplant operation conducted
at the children's medical center Wednesday  immediately  after
the hospital received the donation.
</P>
<P>
So far the boy's temperature and heart beat have remained normal,
showing no signs of infection or rejection, said Chen Jing, a
deputy director of the Shanghai hospital's blood department.
</P>
<P>
Chen noted, however, that it would take about one week to see
whether a rejection would occur or not after a transplant of bone
marrow, pointing out that during this crucial week, Chiu's life
still hangs in the balance.
</P>
<P>
The boy, whose parents are a couple from Leshan City of Sichuan
Province working and living in Suzhou in China's Jiangsu
province, reportedly developed loathing of food and an abnormal
craving for lime since late last year.
</P>
<P>
Doctors at the Shanghai medical center attributed the boy's
abnormal behaviors to thalassemia, which occurs chiefly among
people of Mediterranean descent.
</P>
<P>
The Hualien-based Tzu Chi Bone Marrow and Stem Cell Center -- the
largest bone marrow registry in Asia -- sprang to action when
they learned that the boy needed a bone marrow transplant earlier
this month. The Tzu Chi volunteers requested assistance from
staff in charge of the bone marrow registry and succeeded in
matching the child with a donor.
</P>
<P>
Doctors in China predicted that without a bone marrow transplant.
the child will not live beyond 12.
</P>
<P>
The Tzu Chi Bone Marrow and Stem Cell Center has built a data
bank of nearly 300,000 bone marrow samples since its inception in
1993. It has helped more than 300 victims of blood diseases to
find donors.
</P>
<P>
The center now has access to more than 10 million donors' data
worldwide after linking with two bone marrow data banks in the
United States and Germany late last year.
