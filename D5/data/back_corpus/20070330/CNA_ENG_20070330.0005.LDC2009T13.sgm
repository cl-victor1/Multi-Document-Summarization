Bangkok,  Thailand,  March  29 (CNA) 03/30/07  10:52:17 (By Wu

The Industrial Technology Research Institute (ITRI) in Taiwan
signed a cooperation research project with the National Science
and Technology Development Agency (NSTDA) in Thailand Wednesday
to develop clean energy resources.
</P>
<P>
The deal came after the ITRI President Johnsee Lee was invited by
the NSTDA to deliver a keynote speech at its annual congress held
here.
</P>
<P>
The ITRI signed a letter of intent with the NSTDA last February
as part of efforts to increase bilateral cooperation,
particularly on the development of the proton exchange membrane
fuel cell (PEMFC) , Lee said.
</P>
<P>
The PEMFC is small, but can generate high levels of energy, Lee
explained, adding that it is also a clean and renewable energy.
</P>
<P>
The price of the PEMFC is expensive now, Lee noted. However, with
more advanced technology and widespread application, the price is
expected to drop, he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Lee also stressed that the ITRI has begun to cooperate with the
NSTDA in many fields, including personnel exchanges and training.
</P>
<P>
In the future, there will be more cooperation between the two
organizations, Lee said, adding that cooperation on the PEMFC is
just the beginning.
