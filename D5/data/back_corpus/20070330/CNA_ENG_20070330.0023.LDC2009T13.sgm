Kinmen, March 30 (CNA) 03/30/07  18:21:16 (By Han Nai-kuo)

<P>
A team of 60-odd runners from the outlying island of Kinmen left
Friday on a boat for Xiamen in China's Guangdong province to take
part in the 2007 Xiamen International Marathon Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The team, led by Wang Yi-sheng, president of the Kinmen Sports
Association, departed onboard the "New Golden Dragon" via one of
the "mini-three links" routes.
</P>
<P>
Lee Tsai-hang, director of the Kinmen County's Education Bureau,
is the deputy leader of the team.
</P>
<P>
Lee told reporters prior to the team's departure that some of the
the team's members are medal winners in marathon races, including
Ho Chin-wen, a gold medalist in the 10-km race of a previous
Xiamen International Marathon; and Huang Shih-chang, a silver
medalist in the 21.1-km half marathon race of the marathon.
</P>
<P>
Lee added that Ho will compete in the 42.2-km full marathon race
this time.
</P>
<P>
He said this is the fifth year that runners from Kinmen have
taken part in the annual Xiamen marathon race -- thanks to the
government policy that allowed the opening of the "mini three-
links" routes, including direct sea transport between Kinmen and
Xiamen, beginning in 2001.
</P>
<P>
The 2007 Xiamen International Marathon is scheduled to begin at 8
a.m. Saturday, with 25,000 runners from more than 30 countries
competing in the race.
