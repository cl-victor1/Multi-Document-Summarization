</HEADLINE>

Geneva,  Switzerland,  March 29 (CNA) 03/30/07  21:57:13 (By Neil

Examination Yuan President Yao Chia-wen urged the member states
of the United Nations at a conference of the Human Rights Council
Thursday to support Taiwan's bid to join the World Health
Organization (WHO) , a move that drew a protest from Chinese
officials afterwards.
</P>
<P>
Yao's speech marked the first time a high-ranking Taiwan official
has made a statement at a U.N. meeting.
</P>
<P>
The success achieved this time was the result of careful planning
in advance and a low-key attitude that prevented Chinese
officials from finding out about the plan in advance, Yao said.
</P>
<P>
Due to Taiwan's lack of U.N. membership and strong pressure from
China, it is very difficult for Taiwanese officials to attend
U.N. conferences or speak at U.N. meetings.
</P>
<P>
Yao and ruling Democratic Progressive Party Department of
International Affairs Director Chen Chung-hsin attended the
fourth conference of the council held in Geneva this month on
behalf of Liberal International, a world federation of liberal
and democratic political parties.
</P>
<P>
Yao arrived in Geneva March 26 and attended the conference for
two days, while Chen chaired a peripheral meeting for Liberal
International.
</P>
<P>
As Yao was making his statement, Chinese officials failed to
interrupt him. However, they voiced their protest afterwards.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Liberal International presented a written statement
at the conference claiming that it is a basic right of the Taiwan
people for Taiwan to join the WHO.
</P>
<P>
The statement was later listed as one of the official conference
documents.
</P>
<P>
Yao's success will provide further momentum for Taiwan, as the
country is preparing itself for the World Health Assembly slated
to be held in May, Chen said.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan will take a more "pro-active action" at that time, Chen
went on, although he also predicted that China will also try
harder to block Taiwan's efforts.
