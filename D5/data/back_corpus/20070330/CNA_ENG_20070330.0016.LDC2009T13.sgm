TAIWAN CONFIDENT OF WINNING U.S. PRIVATE SECTOR'S SUPPORT FOR FTA
</HEADLINE>

Washington,  March 29 (CNA) 03/30/07  16:12:17 (By Tsai Hui-ju
and Deborah Kuo)
</P>

Pointing out that few problems exist in business and trade
exchanges between Taiwan and the United States, a Taiwan
economics official said Thursday that he is confident Taiwan will
win the U.S. private sector's support for the signing of a free
trade agreement between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Fielding questions during an online forum at washingtonpost.
com., Vice Minister of Economic Affairs Fadah Hsieh said that due
to the extremely close economic relationship that Taiwan has with
the United States as well as to Taiwan's efforts to address
related U.S. concerns over the past few years, very few
outstanding issues remain in the sphere of U.S.-Taiwan trade.
</P>
<P>
However, Hsieh continued, there are still some improvements that
need to be made in the areas of pharmaceutical products and
agriculture.
</P>
<P>
"We are confident that these issues will be properly addressed in
the near future and that the resolution of such issues will help
to increase support among U.S.  industries for negotiations on a
Taiwan-U.S. FTA.
</P>
<P>
Hsieh made the remarks when he and John Chen-Chung Deng, current
deputy representative  of the Taipei  Economic  and  Cultural
Representative Office in the United States, were taking questions
online on the prospects and challenges of a U.S.-Taiwan free
trade deal.
</P>
<P>
At the start of the forum, titled "A Path Worth Taking? The
Prospects and Challenges of a U.S.-Taiwan Free Trade Deal, " the
host of the forum host said that "in recent years, the creation
of numerous free trade agreements (FTAs) around the world has
triggered a chain reaction, as countries fearing exclusion move
forward to establish their own regional FTAs. Taiwan, the world's
16th- largest trading power and the United States' ninth-largest
trading partner, has indicated its desire for an FTA with the
United States."
</P>
<P>
"Taiwan's technology-based economy and role as a doorway to
China's market offers a larger potential trading relationship
than any other country currently negotiating an FTA with the
United States," the host said.
</P>
<P>
After pointing out that "some feel that a U.S.-Taiwan FTA would
send an unmistakable signal of U.S. support for democratic
Taiwan, while others believe such a trade deal would complicate
the United States' relations in the region, " the host then
asked: Is a U.S.-Taiwan trade pact a path worth taking?"
</P>
<P>
In response, Hsieh said that Taiwan is in a good position to
begin negotiations on an FTA with the United States, adding that
Taiwan's government has already reformed many of its policies
regarding the few trade barriers cited by the United States,
including  those  in the pharmaceuticals  sector,  as well as
strengthened its intellectual property rights protection.
</P>
<P>
As will also probably be the case in the United States, Hsieh
said, some industries in Taiwan will face increased competition
as a result of an FTA. However, he said, Taiwan's economy is
relatively open in most manufacturing sectors and many areas of
the service sector. The agriculture sector, by contrast, has
liberalized to a lesser extent, although many tariff barriers
have been lowered as a result of Taiwan's accession to the WTO in
2002.
</P>
<P>
"The Taiwan government already has in place a number of programs
to encourage Taiwan's farmers to specialize in horticultural
products and higher value-added production. This is meant to help
them adjust to the opening up of the market that has taken place
so far, " Hsieh noted.
</P>
<P>
"The rice sector is one area that will need special attention
from the government  as Taiwan's economy continues to undergo
liberalization.  Direct financial assistance to farmers by the
government (not tied to production) is one of the ways under
consideration to manage the transition. Training in shifting to
other crops could be undertaken, as can programs to improve
product quality and assist with marketing efforts as farmers move
into new product lines," he added.
</P>
<P>
Asked whether a Taiwan-U.S. bilateral agreement would be viewed
by the Chinese as a direct economic threat, Hsieh responded by
saying that Taiwan has no objection to the United States granting
China preferential  trade treatment, such as Permanent Normal
Trade Relations (PNTR) status.
</P>
<P>
As many Taiwanese enterprises  have invested in China and
established business networks there and as the two sides have
developed an increasingly interdependent economic relationship
over the past few decades, Hsieh said, Taiwan believes that a
benign economic relationship  between the United States and China
is beneficial for Taiwan because it creates a "win-win-win
situation" for the three parties.
</P>
<P>
The same rationale also applies to a U.S.-Taiwan FTA, Hsieh said.
Given the deep economic engagement across the strait, an
energetic U.S.-Taiwan economic relationship is definitely good
for China in terms of its immediate business interests as well as
its long-term economic development, he added.
</P>
<P>
When asked in what areas U.S. agricultural exports to Taiwan are
likely to expand under an FTA, Deng responded by saying that
Taiwan has long been one of the major export destinations for a
wide variety of U.S. farm products, ranging from wheat to corn to
pork.
</P>
<P>
In 2005, for example, U.S. agricultural exports to Taiwan totaled
US$2.3 billion. This strong trade relationship suggests that an
FTA with Taiwan could provide great benefits for U.S. farmers and
ranchers, Deng said, adding that Taiwan is already a leading
market for U.S. exports of soybeans, feed grains, apples,
peaches, plums, cherries,  apricots, corn, celery, lettuce,
cabbage, asparagus, broccoli, onions and bovine hides.
</P>
<P>
Economic studies on the FTA suggest that Taiwan would be a very
promising market for U.S. exports of fish, foodstuffs and
processed foods, he added.
</P>
<P>
On why a free trade agreement is important for Taiwan, Deng said
that a free trade agreement is a form of trade agreement
authorized under the rules of the World Trade Organization (WTO)
. Under an FTA, he said, two or more trading partners agree to
remove tariffs and other barriers to trade to promote mutual
economic growth and achieve greater economic integration.
</P>
<P>
Deng said Taiwan is the United States' eighth largest trading
partner and the fifth largest market for U.S. agricultural
exports. In terms of economic security, he said, the objective of
forging closer economic ties through FTAs is very important for
Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
"We understand that FTAs can lead to trade creation and trade
diversion, thereby changing the competitive conditions our
exporters face, sometimes favorably and sometimes not so
favorably," he added.
</P>
<P>
For example, he continued, the United States has launched FTA
negotiations  with several of Taiwan's  neighboring  countries,
including South Korea, Malaysia and Thailand, and many of these
countries' products compete directly with those of Taiwan in the
U.S. market. Added to that are China's efforts to develop deeper
trade relations with the 10-member ASEAN group, he noted.
</P>
<P>
If such efforts succeed,  the resulting scenario would be
troubling for Taiwan, since Taiwan could face being bypassed by
this wave of regional economic integration. Trade and investment
flows would be diverted from Taiwan to other destinations in Asia
where FTAs are in place. Such an outcome would result in negative
consequences  for  Taiwan's  future  economic  development  and
competitiveness, Deng added.
