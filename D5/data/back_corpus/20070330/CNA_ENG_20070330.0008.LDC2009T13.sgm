Premier Su Tseng-chang would not comment Friday on a local
daily's speculation that "three-in-one" elections may be held
early next year, saying only that the administration will respect
whatever decision the Central Election Commission (CEC) makes on
the issue.
</P>
<P>
The United Daily News reported Friday that the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party is planning to promote "three-in-one"
elections, namely the simultaneous holding of the presidential
election, legislative elections, and a nationwide referendum, on
Jan. 19, 2008.

<P>
Noting that the CEC is the top government agency in charge of
electoral affairs and that it is an independent agency, Su said
that he has not heard anything about the "three-in-one" plan but
that he and the Executive Yuan will respect whatever decision the
CEC makes on it.
</P>
<P>
Su said he believes that as an independent agency, the CEC will
not take any individual's personal gains or the interests of any
one political party into consideration when making plans for
upcoming elections, including the legislative elections, slated
for the end of 2007, and the presidential election, scheduled for
March 2008.
</P>
<P>
As long as the CEC keeps the elections open and fair, Su said, he
and the administration will accept whatever decisions it makes in
planning the elections, adding that whether "three-in-one"
elections should be held ought to be decided after a consensus is
reached nationwide on the issue.
