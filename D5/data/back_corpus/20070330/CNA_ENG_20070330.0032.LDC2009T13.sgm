NO-ONE COMMISSIONED TO DISCUSS FINANCIAL SUPERVISORY MOU: MAC
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taipei,  March  30 (CNA) 03/30/07  20:05:32 (By Lilian Wu)

The government has yet to commission anyone to discuss the
signing of a memorandum of understanding (MOU) on a financial
supervisory mechanism between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait,
the nation's top China policy charter said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) Chairman Joseph Wu said the MAC
welcomes private citizens encouraging China to consult with the
Taiwan authorities on setting up such a mechanism, but added that
the time for the government to commission such discussions has
not arrived.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks on the sidelines of a seminar titled "From
the National People's Congress to the 17th National Congress of
the Communist Party of China."
</P>
<P>
He was responding to recent reports that the Taiwan Financial
Services Roundtable  (TFSR)  has set up an advisory group on
cross-strait financial exchanges to help bring about the signing
of a cross-strait MOU on financial exchanges when Legislative
Speaker Wang Jin-pyng visits China.
</P>
<P>
The report also said the advisory group will be composed of
former Premier Vincent Siew and four other financial experts --
former finance ministers Paul Chiu, Lee Yung-shan and Hsu Jia-
tung and former Vice Finance Minister Sean Chen. TFSR Chairman
Chien Hung-wen said a day earlier that should Wang be
commissioned by the government, the organization will mobilize
local financial experts to help Wang sign the MOU in China.
</P>
<P>
Wu noted that the government has repeatedly urged China to
consult with Taiwan on a cross-strait financial supervisory
mechanism to facilitate institutionalized cross-strait financial
exchanges.
</P>
<P>
"But so far, China has never expressed any intention of beginning
consultations with Taiwan," Wu said.
</P>
<P>
He further pointed out that any official consultation should be
conducted by bodies commissioned by the two sides of the Taiwan
Strait or related government agencies.
</P>
<P>
MAC Vice Chairman Liu Teh-shun said the purpose of setting up a
financial supervisory mechanism is to reduce the risk in cross-
border financial activities and has no political intent.
