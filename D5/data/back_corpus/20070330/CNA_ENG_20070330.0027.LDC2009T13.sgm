PLAN TO COMBINE ELECTIONS AIMS TO SERVE PRIVATE ENDS: TSU
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  March 30 (CNA) 03/30/07  19:16:21 (By Flor Wang)

<P>
Opposition Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU) Chairman Huang Kun-hui
criticized and voiced objections Friday to a reported  plan by
the ruling party to combine three upcoming elections.
</P>
<P>
According to a local daily newspaper, the Democratic Progressive
Party (DPP) is considering having the 2008 presidential election
-- currently scheduled for March 20th -- held on Jan. 19 next
year along with the legislative elections and a national
referendum at the same.
</P>
<P>
Under the current law, the next legislative election should be
held in December this year.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, ranking DPP officials gave assurances to
their TSU peers that the ruling party will retain several at-
large legislative seats for TSU candidates in the year-end
contest and that as long as the "pan-green camp" succeeds in
winning a majority at the Legislative Yuan and firming up its
grip on power, the two parties can consider a full merger at that
time.
</P>
<P>
"The idea is no good at all; it is a scheme to serve private
interests and squeeze out smaller parties in future elections,"
Huang said, adding that "the public cannot accept such a proposal
because the DPP is putting its partisan political concerns ahead
of national interests."
</P>
<P>
Combining the presidential and legislative elections is not
congruent  with the spirit  of the Constitution,  and if the
presidential election were indeed held next January, there would
be a four-month transition period preceding the president's
stepping down in May -- a situation which he said could hinder
normal government operations.
</P>
<P>
"The DPP should endeavor to maintain the country's constitutional
system normal and sound, and the presidential election should be
held according to stipulations clearly set in the Constitution, "
he opined.
</P>
<P>
According  to a ranking  official  of the TSU's publicity
department,  holding the presidential and legislative elections
together may lead to confusion among voters as a new "single-
member constituency,  two-vote" system is to implemented in the
next legislative polls.
</P>
<P>
A combined poll would also shift voter attention away from the
legislative election,  hobbling legislative reform efforts and
upsetting  Taiwan's democratic  development,  the TSU official
explained.
</P>
<P>
As to the question of whether the two parties in the "pan-green"
camp should be consolidated, the TSU official argued that the
existence of one political party need not be decided by another;
rather it is decided by a special connection between the party
and its supporters.
</P>
<P>
The TSU is resolved to continue striving for Taiwan's people, she
said.
