THINKTANK TO HOLD CONFERENCE ON TAIWAN'S ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  Feb.  16 (CNA) (By Flor Wang)

Taiwan Advocates -- a private thinktank dedicated to Taiwan's
independence -- is slated to hold an economic development conference
in mid-March to develop strategies on creating outlets for Taiwan's
economy, Taiwan Advocates Vice Chairman Huang Kun-huei announced
Thursday at a news conference.
</P>
<P>
Former President Lee Teng-hui, the founder and mastermind of Taiwan
Advocates, places great importance on the conference and keenly hopes
that people from diverse specializations will participate in the
meeting March 18-19 to examine the future of the nation's economy,
Huang said -- in particular Taiwan's trade and economic relations with
China.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan Advocates hopes to attract private individuals, scholars,
experts and representatives of small businesses and minority groups to
discuss topics focusing on cross-strait economic relations and
developing a winning strategy for Taiwan amid globalization and
unemployment in the conference, he said.
</P>
<P>
Policy suggestions from the conference will be referred to the
government before it holds a second national conference on economic
development that will seek ways to revive Taiwan's economy, Huang
added.
</P>
<P>
The "active opening, effective management" China investment policy
implemented by President Chen Shui-bian over the past five years
following the first national economic development conference has had a
negative impact on Taiwan's economy, he said.
</P>
<P>
According to Huang, the policy has led to as much as US$250 billion in
capital flight leaving Taiwan for China, and more than 70 percent of
Taiwan's core industries have moved their manufacturing overseas,
driving up unemployment and widening the gap between rich and poor at
home.
</P>
<P>
Facing a crisis of such an economic "hollowing out, " Taiwan Advocates
has proposed globalization as a way to reduce Taiwan's reliance on the
Chinese market, he said, adding that the government needs to come up
with better management techniques -- rather than restrictions -- to
guide Taiwan investors.
</P>
<P>
Prior to the conference, Taiwan Advocates will also hold four seminars
in Taipei, Taichung, Yunlin and Kaohsiung areas.
