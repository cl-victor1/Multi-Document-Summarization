Los Angeles, Feb. 2 (CNA) 02/03/07  15:18:11 (By Chu Lu-sheng and
Y.F. Low)

Wanted Rebar Asia Pacific Group founder Wang You-theng was taken
into custody by U.S. authorities Friday soon after his return to
Los Angeles following a failed attempt to flee to Myanmar via
Singapore, Taiwan officials posted in the United States said
later that day.
</P>
<P>
Wang, whose U.S. visa was canceled after both his Republic of
China and Dominican Republic passports were revoked, was held and
questioned for more than two hours by U.S. immigration officials
upon his arrival at Los Angeles International Airport, the
officials said.
</P>
<P>
Wang was later taken to a detention center and U.S. immigration
authorities are expected to hold a hearing within seven days to
decide how they will deal with him, they said.
</P>
<P>
Wang's wife Wang Chin She-ying, who returned to Los Angeles with
Wang, was allowed to enter the country because she holds a valid
U.S. passport, according to the officials.
</P>
<P>
In Taipei, Ministry of Foreign Affairs deputy spokeswoman Yeh
Fei-pi said Taiwan respects the United States' handling of the
case and will continue to negotiate with the U.S. authorities in
the hope that Wang can be returned to Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
The Wangs, who have allegedly embezzled billions of dollars in
corporate funds, fled to China late last year just before the
Rebar scandal broke, from where they flew to the United States.
</P>
<P>
The couples departed from Los Angeles Wednesday for Myanmar via
Singapore and immediately  fell under close scrutiny from the
Singapore authorities upon their arrival at Singapore's Changi
International Airport early Friday.
</P>
<P>
Through intensive negotiations with the Taiwan authorities,
Singapore originally agreed to facilitate Wang's arrest by
arranging for the couple to take a Singapore-Los Angeles flight
that would include a stopover in Taiwan so that they could be
grabbed by the Taiwan authorities.
</P>
<P>
However, the couple refused to cooperate and demanded to return
to the United States on a direct flight to Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
The Rebar scandals came to light early last month after the Rebar
group's China Rebar Co. and Chia Hsin Food and Synthetic Fiber
Co. applied for insolvency restructuring, triggering a run on the
Chinese Bank, another Rebar affiliate.
</P>
<P>
The Taipei District Prosecutor's Office accused the couple Jan.
12 of violating the Securities Transaction Act and breach of
trust and put them on Taiwan's most-wanted list Jan. 15.
