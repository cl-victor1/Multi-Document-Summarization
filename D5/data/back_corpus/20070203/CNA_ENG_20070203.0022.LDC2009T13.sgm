REBAR CASE SHOWS PROBLEMS IN FOREIGN JUDICIAL ASSISTANCE

Taipei,  Feb.  3 (CNA) 02/03/07  17:56:07 (By Lilian Wu)

The difficulties in getting a fugitive tycoon back to Taiwan to
face justice for a series of scandals involving his business
group have shown that there is still room for improvement  in
seeking mutual judicial assistance  from other countries,
judicial sources said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The sources made the remarks after the latest unsuccessful
diplomatic and judicial efforts to get Wang You-theng, founder of
the Rebar Asia Pacific Group, back to Taiwan from the United
States. Wang was taken into custody by U.S. authorities Saturday
after his Taiwan and Dominican Republic passports were
invalidated through Taiwan's efforts.
</P>
<P>
Wang first fled to China late last December shortly after the
Rebar scandal broke out, from where he later fled to the United
States. Taiwan put him on its most-wanted list in mid-January. He
tried to fly to Myanmar via Singapore Wednesday but was sent back
to the U.S. Friday by the Singapore authorities for lacking
proper travel papers.
</P>
<P>
The sources pointed out that Taiwan is not a member of the United
Nations and that it has to rely on taking part in international
organizations to get judicial assistance from other nations.
</P>
<P>
Other channels include Taiwan's investigation agencies that
cooperate with other countries and Taiwan's judicial officials
who cooperate with their foreign counterparts through private
exchanges.
</P>
<P>
In terms of taking part in international organizations, they
noted that Taiwan, represented by the Ministry of Justice (MOJ),
has taken part in such organizations combating money-laundering
as the Asia/Pacific Group on Money Laundering and the Egmont
Group.
</P>
<P>
On forging international cooperative relations, they noted that
Taiwan inked a mutual judicial assistance agreement with the
United States in March 2002.
</P>
<P>
They said the MOJ Investigation Bureau and the Criminal
Investigation Administration Bureau have in recent years forged
informal cooperation ties with their counterparts from other
countries.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan has established channels of communications with 70 law
enforcement agencies in nearly 50 countries, they said, achieving
substantive  results in the areas of information exchange and
receiving alerts when Taiwanese criminals are expelled from other
countries.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan has also sent prosecutors to take part in meetings of the
International Association of Prosecutors since 2001. It is hoped
that this will pave the way for mutual judicial assistance
someday.
</P>
<P>
They said Taiwan currently has cooperative  relations with
prosecutors from the United States, Japan, Singapore, Switzerland
and Macau, but added that the scope needs to be expanded.
