The Department of Health (DOH) will expand its free alcohol
addiction treatment program for perpetrators of alcohol-related
child abuse to the entire country from April, officials said
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The program has been carried out on a trial basis in Hualien,
Nantou, Pingtung, Taitung, Yilan and Kaohsiung counties since
last year.

According to DOH tallies, 3,330 perpetrators of physical abuse
were ordered by the court to receive compulsory treatment or
counseling between June 1999 and November 2006, 34.29 percent of
whom were required to undergo alcohol addiction treatment.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, perpetrators in 13 percent of child abuse cases
reported around the country are alcoholics, the tallies show.

DOH officials said the treatment includes four to six outpatient
visits and 15 psychological  counseling sessions and cognitive
education counseling, with the entire therapy expected to last
four to five months.
</P>
<P>
While the government is footing the bill for the targeted
alcoholics, civic organizations designated by the government will
help monitor the treated abusers for one year after the therapy
is completed, the officials said.
