Taipei, Feb. 3 (CNA) 02/03/07  18:15:35 (By Lilian Wu)
</P>
<P>
Opposition Kuomintang (KMT) and People First Party (PFP)
legislators voiced opposition Saturday to an announcement that
the names of state-owned enterprises will be changed to reflect
the fact that they are Taiwanese rather than Chinese.
</P>
<P>
The legislators expressed their opposition after Economic Affairs
Minister Steve Chen Ruey-long announced the previous day that two
state-owned enterprises will have their names changed.
</P>
<P>
Chen said the name of the Chinese Petroleum Corp. (CPC) will be
changed to CPC, Taiwan, while the China Shipbuilding Corp. (CSBC)
will adopt the name CSBC, Taiwan. The changes are in line with
the government's name "rectification" policy aimed at avoiding
confusion with Chinese businesses, according to Chen, who claimed
that it will also benefit the future operations of the companies.
</P>
<P>
KMT Legislator Hsu Shao-ping said the name-change is part of the
government's efforts to cater to the supporters of Taiwan
independence.
</P>
<P>
"It has no substantial significance except squandering taxpayers'
money," she said, claiming that it does not come at an
appropriate time "when the nation is in economic doldrums."
</P>
<P>
She said the KMT legislative caucus is mulling whether to boycott
the general budget of the central government for 2007, which
failed to pass the previous legislative session that ended
January, the first time the legislature has failed to pass the
budget before the new fiscal year begins Jan. 1.
</P>
<P>
She expressed discontent that the government, before the budget
is even passed, is thinking of spending unnecessary money,
estimated at NT$70 million (US$2.13 million) for the CPC and
NT$20 million for the CSBC according to estimates by the two
enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Legislator Cheng Chin-ling, a PFP caucus whip in the legislature,
said the economic minister's claims that the name-changes will
not cost a lot are aimed at blurring the focus of the issue.
</P>
<P>
Claiming that the nation's economy is "getting worse every day, "
she asked why the ministry does not put more efforts into
boosting the economy instead of on trivial issues that she
claimed are irrelevant.
</P>
<P>
Cheng said the PFP agrees with the KMT in terms of reviewing the
screening of the government's budget.
