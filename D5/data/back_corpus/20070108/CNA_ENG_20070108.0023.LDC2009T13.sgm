Jobs of more financial workers may be affected in the coming
months, as the storm of a lingering credit card crunch is not yet
over, coupled with a recent run on the Chinese Bank, a government
official said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Citing statistics compiled by the Cabinet-level Directorate
General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics (DGBAS) , the DGBAS
official reported that around 2,000 workers in the financial
sector lost their jobs since Oct. 2005 and he said that more
might face the same fate after the run on the Chinese Bank last
Friday.
</P>
<P>
He forecast that the number of unemployed in the financial sector
will top 3,000 in the coming months, despite the fact that it is
still difficult to assess the impact of the Chinese Bank run on
the job market.
</P>
<P>
According to the DGBAS official, an increase of each 1,000
jobless workers will add more 0.1 percentage points to the
country's unemployment rate. The Cabinet- level Council for
Economic Planning and Development has estimated a jobless rate of
lower than 4 percent for Taiwan in 2007, he added.
</P>
<P>
Shortly prior to the Chinese Bank problems, two other banks --
Enterprise Bank of Hualien and Taitung Business Bank -- were
taken over by the Central Deposit Insurance Corporation.
