Operators of the National Financial Stabilization Fund are
closely monitoring the Taiwan stock market for any abnormal
fluctuations that might be triggered by the run on a local bank
owned by Rebar Asia-Pacific Group, Finance Minister Ho Chih-chin
said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Ho, however, said that the National Financial Stabilization Fund
will not intervene unless the operators determine that there is a
need to channel funds into the Taipei stock market which has
dipped since the bank run was triggered.
</P>
<P>
The run on the Chinese Bank began after China Rebar Co. and Chia
Hsin Food &amp; Synthetic Fiber Co. -- two subsidiary companies
of Rebar Asia Pacific Group -- filed a restructuring request with
the Taipei District Court last Thursday. The two companies have
become insolvent after suffering losses totaling NT$25.2 billion
over the past seven years. The Chinese Bank is owned by the Rebar
Group.
</P>
<P>
The Financial Supervisory Commission (FSC) on Friday instructed
the Central Deposit Insurance Corp. (CDIC) to take over the
Chinese Bank in the wake of the bank crisis.
</P>
<P>
FSC tallies show that clients withdrew a total of NT$15 billion
(US$462 million) from the bank Friday.
</P>
<P>
Lin Chin-tsun, an assistant lead prosecutor with the Taipei
District Prosecutors' Office, said that Chief Prosecutor Yen Tah-
ho convened an emergency meeting Monday, during which it was
decided that the prosecutors will actively look into the
insolvency case. There are concerns that the bank run could
trigger a wider financial storm.
</P>
<P>
According to investigators, despite its financial distress, China
Rebar Co. secured NT$73 million worth of shares of a broadband
network company last September, while Great Chinese Bills Finance
Corp. -- another spin-off of the Rebar Asia-Pacific Group -- has
extended credit guarantees to 22 Rebar Group companies beyond the
legal limits.
</P>
<P>
The prosecutors said executives of China Rebar Co., Chia Hsin
Food &amp; Synthetic Fiber Co., the Chinese Bank and the Great
Chinese Bills Finance Corp. may be guilty of several violations,
including embezzlement and insider trading.
</P>
<P>
China Rebar is a large Taiwanese corporation involved in a wide
range of businesses, including textiles, construction, hotels,
real estate, retail, services, insurance, banking and media.
Together, the company and Chia Hsin Food &amp; Synthetic Fiber
Co. employ more than 3,400 people.
</P>
<P>
In addition to having the CDIC take over the Chinese Bank, the
FSC took further action Saturday to ask Taiwan Cooperative Bank
and Cathay United Bank to jointly take over the Great Chinese
Bills Finance Corp. in an attempt to nip in the bud a possible
domino effect created by the bank run.
