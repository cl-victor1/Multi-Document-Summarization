The nation's top financial regulator said Monday that the crowds
of people withdrawing money from the Chinese Bank had gradually
dispersed shortly before noon that day.
</P>
<P>
Shih Jun-chi, chairman of the Financial Supervisory Commission
(FSC), said there is no systematic risk of more bank runs.
</P>
<P>
He again told depositors of The Chinese Bank, owned by the
financially troubled Rebar Asia-Pacific Group, that they have no
need to worry, saying that "every penny of their money will be
assured by the national coffers."
</P>
<P>
The bank run Friday was set off after the Taipei District Court
approved Jan. 4 a restructuring request by China Rebar Co. and
Chia Hsin Food and Synthetic Fiber Co. -- two subsidiary
companies of Rebar Asia Pacific Group -- which became insolvent
after suffering losses totaling NT$25.2 billion over the past
seven years.

China Rebar is a large Taiwanese corporation involved in a wide
range of businesses, including textiles, construction, hotels,
real estate, retail, services, insurance, banking and media.
Together, the company and Chia Hsin Food and Synthetic Fiber Co.
employ more than 3,400 people.
</P>
<P>
FSC tallies show that clients withdrew a total of NT$15 billion
(US$462 million) from the bank Friday.
</P>
<P>
To ensure the depositors, the FSC had the Central Deposit
Insurance Corp. take over the Chinese Bank. It also asked Taiwan
Cooperative Bank and Cathay United Bank to jointly take over the
Rebar Group-owned stock brokerage firm, the Great Chinese Bills
Finance Corp., in an attempt to nip in the bud any domino effect.
</P>
<P>
According to FSC statistics, the Chinese Bank has 35 branches and
as of the end of December last year, deposits amounted to
NT$169.71 billion, while loans totaled NT$124.66 billion. The net
worth totalled NT$10.017 billion and it had an overdue ratio of
8.13 percent.
