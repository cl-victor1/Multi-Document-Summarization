Taipei,  Jan.  7 (CNA) 01/08/07  10:58:42 (By Sofia Wu)

<P>
Premier Su Tseng-chang said Sunday the Executive Yuan will fully
subsidize repair or reconstruction of public facilities damaged
or toppled in the Dec. 26 earthquake in the Hengchun area in the
southernmost county of Pingtung.
</P>
<P>
Su made the promise  during  an inspection  tour  of the quake-
affected zone in the company of Pingtung County Magistrate Tsao
Chi-hung and heads of relevant central government agencies.
</P>
<P>
It was Su's second visit to the region since the magnitude 6.7
earthquake struck off the coast of Hengchun Dec. 26 -- the
strongest temblor to rock the area in a century.
</P>
<P>
Su was briefed at the Hengchun township government office on the
casualties and damage caused by the earthquake that was followed
by many aftershocks, including a magnitude-6.4 one. Two people
were killed and scores injured in the disaster.
</P>
<P>
According to Tsao, repair of public facilities, roads and bridges
calls for an outlay of NT$45 million, repair of schools around
the Hengchun and nearby areas will need an additional NT$46
million and restoration of historical and cultural relics will
require an estimated NT$24 million.
</P>
<P>
Su agreed to Tsao's request that the central government offer
full financial support for all those public facilities and
schools. He also agreed that government subsidies for repair,
relocation or reconstruction of damaged private homes be offered
in line with the standards applied in the aid to those victimized
in the devastating earthquake of Sept. 21, 1999 that killed more
than 2,400 and left tens of thousands homeless.
</P>
<P>
Su directed the county government to come up with a detailed
report in one month about relief fund and low-interest loans
needed for those whose homes were seriously damaged or destroyed
in the earthquake. "We should cut red tape and simplify
procedures in post-disaster relief work," he added.
</P>
<P>
The premier also reminded the township and county governments
that precautionary measures  should be taken against possible
landslides in mountainous or hillside regions that tend to follow
major earthquakes.
</P>
<P>
At least 134 elementary and high schools in five southern cities
and counties sustained damage in the Dec. 26 quake -- which
struck at 8: 26 p.m. with its epicenter located 22.8 km southwest
of Hengchun at a depth of 21.9 km. Of the 134 schools, nine in
Pingtung County and one in Kaohsiung City were heavily damaged.
