Taiwan High-Speed Rail Corp. (THSRC) reported Monday that
passenger occupancy rate of the high-speed rail system was less
than 70 percent on the first two days of operations.
</P>
<P>
THSRC officials said that on the first day of service Friday,
there were a total of 18,024 passengers, for an average occupancy
rate of 47 percent, while on the second day, there were 26, 067
passengers, for an occupancy rate of 68 percent.

<P>
Although Sunday's numbers have yet to be tallied, the total
number of passengers is expected to be higher than on either of
the first two days as a total of 40,000 tickets were sold that
day.
</P>
<P>
The officials said that tickets for all 89 south-bound trains and
74 north-bound trains before Jan. 14 have been sold out.

The 50-percent discount period to promote the much-heralded
system has been extended until Jan. 19, the officials said,
adding that reservations for full- price tickets for trains after
that date can be made from Jan. 13.

The high-speed railway has reduced travel time between Taiwan's
two largest cities -- Taipei and Kaohsiung -- to 90 minutes from
four hours in the past.
