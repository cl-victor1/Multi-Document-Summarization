Taipei,  Jan. 8 (CNA) 01/08/07  19:14:35 (By Elizabeth Hsu)

Faced with disputes on personnel changes in the   opposition
Kuomintang (KMT)  ,   the   party's secretary-general-designate
said Monday that he understands the criticism but hopes party
members will be more considerate and objective.
</P>
<P>
Wu Den-yih made the remarks in response to media inquiries at the
party's headquarters after KMT Chairman Ma Ying-jeou's plan to
name a former editorial writer of the Chinese-language daily
China Times as director of the KMT Culture and Communications
Affairs Committee, and Taoyuan County Director of Environmental
Protection Su Chun-pin as the party's spokesman, triggered
complaints by some members in the Central Standing Committee.
</P>
<P>
Some of the criticisms reflect disagreement on the appointment of
Su, who celebrated his 30th birthday just last year, has often
criticized against the party on TV talk shows.
</P>
<P>
Responding to the complaints, Wu expressed his understanding but
said he hopes the critics will save their arguments for the
moment when the new staff fail to do their jobs well.
</P>
<P>
Su might have severely criticized the KMT for some of its
controversial deeds "out of his deep love for the party, " Wu
said, citing a saying that "different people see roses from
different perspectives -- some see the beautiful blossoms, some
see the thorns."
