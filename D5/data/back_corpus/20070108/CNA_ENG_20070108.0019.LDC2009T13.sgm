TAIWAN NOT OPEN ENOUGH TOWARD CHINA: SEMICONDUCTOR `GODFATHER'
</HEADLINE>

Taiwan is not opening enough economically toward China if the
government's vows to open Taiwan globally are truthful, Taiwan's
semiconductor "godfather" said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. Chairman Morris Chang said
during a speech at National Chengchi University (CCU) that while
the government strives to "globalize" Taiwan's economy and trade,
it makes little sense that Taiwan still restricts investment in
and trade activities with China, which has a quarter of the
world's population and an annual economic growth averaging 10
percent.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to the Elite Chair sponsored by the CCU College of
International Affairs on world-class enterprises' global
development and Taiwan's challenges in terms of global
development, Chang claimed that Taiwan will be opening its
economy only about three-quarters if opening toward China is
restricted.

<P>
Meanwhile, he said, law and the legal system have inextricably
close ties with a country's economic development.
</P>
<P>
He said that while Taiwan's democratization is now mature enough
to make Taiwan a democratic country,  the democratization has
technically been "irrelevant" to the country's economic
development.
</P>
<P>
He said there is still room for Taiwan to improve when it comes
to relations between the legal system and economic development,
adding that the legislature should work to uphold justice and
fairness, while the law enforcement authorities should implement
laws to allow the country's economy to develop healthily.
</P>
<P>
Chang, who has been involved in the semiconductor industry for 51
years, said it is easier for a world-class company or a country
to globalize its markets compared to fund raising and fund
management.
</P>
<P>
While it is also easier to maintain global production operations,
the globalization of personnel or human resources is harder, he
noted. It takes insight, courage and ability to deal with people,
he added.
