The Hsinchu Science Park in northern Taiwan reported another
record high of NT$1.12 trillion (US$33.9 billion) in total
revenue last year, up 14 percent from the same level in 2005,
park administration officials said Thursday.

The rising demand for information electronic products -- such as
PCs, cell phones, digital cameras, and digital TVs -- benefited
the semiconductor industry in 2006, which also contributed to the
growth in the park's total revenue, the officials noted.

Four of the six major industries in the park saw increases while
the other two --  the computer peripherals  industry and the
communications industry -- posted a small decline, according to
the officials.

The total revenue of the park's integrated circuit (IC) industry
went up 17 percent, the officials explained, adding that the
optoelectronics industry was up 18 percent, precision machinery
industry up 36 percent, and the bioindustry up 2 percent.

<P>
By the end of last year, the total number of companies and
manufacturers in the park had reached a record high of 395, with
121,762 employees, which was a 10 percent rise from the previous
year, the officials pointed out.

<P>
The total value of import and export trade in the park last year
rose 20 percent to hit NT$982.3 billion, the officials said. The
total value of exports was up 22 percent to reach NT$592.9
billion, while that of imports increased 18 percent to record
NT$389.4 billion, they explained in detail.

In 2007, the park's revenue is expected to go up 10 percent to
total NT$1.25 trillion, the officials forecast.
