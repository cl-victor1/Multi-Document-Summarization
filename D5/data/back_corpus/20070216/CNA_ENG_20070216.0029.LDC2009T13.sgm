TAIWAN OFFICIAL URGES U.S. TO BE CREATIVE IN DEALING WITH FTA
ISSUE

Taipei,  Feb.  16 (CNA) 02/16/07  19:02:44 (By Elizabeth Hsu)

Vice Minister of Economic Affairs Shih Yen-hsiang suggested
Friday that the U.S. government be more creative in dealing with
the issue of Taiwan's proposed free trade agreement (FTA) with
the United States.
</P>
<P>
Shih made the remarks in response to media inquiries about
reports that Shih asked Washington to develop U.S.-Taiwan FTA
ties based on the framework of the Taiwan Relations Act (TRA) ,
which the U.S. Congress passed in 1979 to govern U.S.-Taiwan
interactions after the severance of diplomatic relations between
the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The TRA authorizes quasi-diplomatic ties with the government in
Taiwan by giving authority to the American Institute in Taiwan to
serve as the de facto embassy.
</P>
<P>
Describing the act as a "very special legal arrangement, " Shih
said that since Washington could create a set of special measures
regarding U.S.-Taiwan exchanges in the absence of diplomatic
ties, it is possible for it to come up with creative ideas and
measures on the FTA issue.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the existence of the U.S.-Taiwan  Trade and
Investment Framework Agreement, sealed in 1994 to resolve
bilateral trade issues and enhance economic cooperation,  Shih
said the agreement cannot replace a FTA because the latter
concerns rules of taxation, which have to be regulated by the
law.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan still wants an FTA with the United States because it would
be a mutually beneficial arrangement, the official claimed.
