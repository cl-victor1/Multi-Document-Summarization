Exchange students from National Chiao Tung University (NCTU) who
went to America and Belgium returned home before the Chinese New
Year to talk about their experiences of studying abroad, a
spokesman for the university said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The students are in NCTU's Electronics Engineering and Computer
Science undergraduate honors program and went to the University
of Illinois  at  Urbana- Champaign  (UTUC)  and  Carnegie  Mellon
University(CMU) in America, and Katholieke Universiteit Leuven in
Belgium.
</P>
<P>
NCTU's top university project chief executive, Chuan Shau-hsun,
said sending students abroad and the policy of undecided majors
are in response to the new trends of globalization and inter-
disciplinary study.

<P>
Chang Yung-hsu, a student who went to UTUC, said she realized
that Taiwan students might have narrower visions compared to
students in America. Chang praised the undecided major policy she
experienced abroad and in particular the practice of letting
students choose majors after they have better understanding about
themselves in their junior and senior years.
</P>
<P>
Lu Shi-jung, a student who went to CMU, said his experience of
studying abroad allowed him to practice his English, try new
things, and inspire him with new ideas. He encouraged college
students to continue trying new things and new environments,
instead of being trapped by fixed thoughts.
</P>
<P>
Lu also said that he sensed fierce competition when he was at
CMU, adding that Taiwan students should be more courageous in
exploring their potential and limits.
