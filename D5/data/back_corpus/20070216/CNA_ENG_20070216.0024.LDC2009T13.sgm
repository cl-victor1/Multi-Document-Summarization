Turnover of the Hon Hai Precision Industry Co. is expected to
break NT$2 trillion (US$60.6 billion) in 2007, which would be one
year ahead of schedule, Hon Hai Chairman Terry Guo said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Guo, believed to be the richest man in Taiwan, made the
announcement at a year- end party for the company employees.
</P>
<P>
He said that this year, Hon Hai will continue its growth and
noted that he predicted three years ago at a shareholders'
meeting that Hon Hai's revenue would break NT$1 trillion in 2008.
</P>
<P>
He adjusted the goal last year to break NT$2 trillion in 2008,
but said the goal can now be achieved this year.
</P>
<P>
Guo said he would follow his original plan to retire to a back-
seat job and expressed hope that employees aged between 35 and 45
will prepare to take up some major posts.

<P>
On being elected as the enterprise that took best care of its
employees last year, Guo also mentioned several points adopted to
allow the employees to enjoy their workplace -- safety, health,
stability and development.
