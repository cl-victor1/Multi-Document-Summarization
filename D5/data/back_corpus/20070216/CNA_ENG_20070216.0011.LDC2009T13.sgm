The number of Taiwan students receiving visas to study abroad in
2006 totaled 37,171, marking a record high over the past decade,
the Ministry of Education (MOE) said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The 2006 figure also represented an increase of more than 3,000,
or 9.1 percent, over that of the previous year, the ministry
said.

<P>
The latest statistics show that Taiwan students still prefer
English-speaking countries and that among the top three foreign
countries in terms of number of visas issued to Taiwan students
in 2006, the United States was first, issuing visas to 16,451
Taiwan students, followed by Britain, which issued 9,600 visas to
Taiwan students, and Australia, which issued 2,862 visas.
</P>
<P>
Japan issued student visas to 2,108 Taiwan students in 2006,
ranking it fourth. The figure marked an increase of 360 over the
previous year.
</P>
<P>
The top eight countries in terms of the number of visas issued to
Taiwan students -- namely the United States, Canada, Britain,
France, Germany, Australia, New Zealand and Japan -- issued more
visas to Taiwan students in 2006 than they did in the previous
year, except for Canada.

<P>
Chang Chin-sheng,  director  of the ministry's  Bureau  of
International Culture &amp; Education Relations, attributed the
increase in the number of Taiwan students studying abroad to the
ministry's encouragement by providing students with scholarships
and pushing domestic colleges and universities to send top
students to study abroad.

<P>
In addition, the ministry kicked off a study abroad loan program
in 2004. It further eased the conditions for applying for
overseas study loans in 2006, Chang said.
