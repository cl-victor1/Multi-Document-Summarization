Taipei,  Feb.  16 (CNA) 02/16/07  23:45:04 (By Y.C. Jou)

Taipei prosecutors indicted Friday two former journalists for
their alleged blackmailing of Hon Hai Group Chairman Terry Guo,
Taiwan's richest man.
</P>
<P>
The indictment says that Next Magazine reporter Tzang Chia-yi --
collaborating with her boyfriend Huang Shang-ping -- last August
and September twice sent draft articles to Guo that defamed him,
with the excuse that she was writing a biography of Guo and
asking that he preview the script.
</P>
<P>
The worried  Guo sought  help from Yang  Jen-kai,  former editor-
in-chief of the China Times Weekly who had also worked with Hon
Hai. However, according to the indictment, Yang joined Tzang and
Huang's plot to blackmail Guo and demanded 10% of the NT$32
million (US$970,432) the pair were extorting in exchange for not
publishing the biography.
</P>
<P>
Police, informed by Guo, arrested Tzang and Huang Dec. 14 at a
bank where Guo's employees were pretending to hand over the money
to the pair, the prosecutors said.
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors dismissed claims by Tzang and Huang that Guo was to
pay the NT$32 million as copyright fee for the book and indicted
the two and Yang.
</P>
<P>
Next Magazine sacked Tzang immediately following her arrest.
