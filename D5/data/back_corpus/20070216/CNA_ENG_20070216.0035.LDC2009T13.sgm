According to the spokesman, the SEF, a quasi-official
organization set up to handle exchanges with China in the absence
of official cross-strait contacts, organizes the annual gathering
to express its concern and attention to taishang, and to use it
as a chance to exchange views among taishang, local businessmen
and government representatives.

Nearly 400 people, including government officials, senior
executives of taishang associations in China, representatives of
local business groups and industry leaders, will participate in
this year's meeting, which will be hosted by the SEF, the
Mainland Affairs Council, the Ministry of Economic Affairs and
the Chinese National Federation of Industries.
