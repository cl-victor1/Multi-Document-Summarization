TAIWAN TRAVELERS TO CHINA WARNED OF RABIES

Taiwan citizens who are planning to visit China during the
Chinese New Year holidays were warned Friday about the risk of
acquiring rabies -- an infectious disease that killed 182 people
in China in January.
</P>
<P>
The Center for Disease Control (CDC) under the Department of
Health called for potential visitors to China to avoid contact
with dogs or other animals in order to avoid getting rabies, a
disease caused by a virus found in the saliva of infected animals
and transmitted to humans by bites or possibly by contamination
of an open cut.
</P>
<P>
According to a report released recently by the Chinese Ministry
of Health, 217 people were bitten by dogs or other animals that
were infected by the rabies virus across China in January. Of the
total, 182, or over 80 percent, died.
</P>
<P>
Rabies was the top specific infectious disease that killed the
greatest number of people for eight consecutive months in China,
followed by tuberculosis, which killed 94 people in January.
</P>
<P>
CDC Deputy Director Shih Wen-yi said that China has been a
rabies-endemic country and that there was a case several years
ago where a Chinese citizen, who had been bitten by a stray dog
before leaving for Taiwan for a short visit, died of rabies in
Taiwan, which is not a rabies-endemic country.
</P>
<P>
Shih said that treatment of an infected person is critical and
that rabies can cause a painful death if untreated.
</P>
<P>
Shih said that in addition to avoiding contact with dogs and
other animals while visiting China, Taiwan visitors can also
receive preexposure rabies vaccination before heading to China or
receive rabies vaccination immediately if they are bitten by an
animal.
</P>
<P>
Rabies is an acute, fatal encephalomyelitis caused by neurotropic
viruses in the family Rhabdoviridae, genus Lyssavirus. The
disease progresses  from a nonspecific  prodromal phase to
paresis or paralysis; muscle spasms can be stimulated by the
sight, sound, or perception of water (hydrophobia) ; delirium and
convulsions can develop, followed by coma and death.
</P>
<P>
Most animals can be infected by the virus and can transmit the
disease to humans. Infected bats, raccoons, foxes, skunks, dogs
or cats provide the greatest risk to humans. Rabies may also
spread through exposure to infected domestic farm animals,
groundhogs, weasels and other wild carnivores. Squirrels, rodents
and rabbits are seldom infected.
