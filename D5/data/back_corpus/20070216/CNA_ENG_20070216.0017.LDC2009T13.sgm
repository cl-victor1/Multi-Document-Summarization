Taipei,  Feb.  15 (CNA) 02/16/07  16:24:07 (By Elizabeth Hsu)

The Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) has passed a proposal to amend
regulations governing approval for professionals from China to
engage in professional activities in Taiwan, relaxing some
restrictions on visits by professionals in the fields of
industry, technology, sport, media and religion.
</P>
<P>
MAC Vice Chairman Liu Te-hsun explained Thursday that the
amendment is part of the Executive Yuan's drive to attract high-
tech and sports talent from China to upgrade the standard of
Taiwan's science and technology and to strengthen its training
programs for national athletes to compete in international
sporting events such as the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
The amendment will be submitted to the Executive Yuan for
ratification before being sent to the Ministry of the Interior,
which will publicize and implement the revision.
</P>
<P>
According to the MAC, the amendment allows Chinese professionals
invited to assist in the training of athletes of Taiwan's
national teams to stay on the island for up to one year at a
time, instead of the current six months. If the professionals are
invited to help train athletes for the Olympics, they can extend
their stay in Taiwan up to six years.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Chinese sports or high-tech professionals who have to
stay in Taiwan for at least four months for work are permitted to
bring their spouse and children aged under 18 with them.
</P>
<P>
Liu pointed out that before the revision,  Chinese  media
professionals who wanted to conduct interviews, cover news or
produce television programs in Taiwan had to apply for official
permission at least two months in advance. Now, the condition has
been lifted for emergency cases.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the amendment also allows a Chinese actor or actress
to bring along five assistants while making a film in Taiwan, and
religious professionals who come to the island to study at
certified religious institutions can get a one- year resident
permit.
</P>
<P>
Liu added that the Chinese professionals need not attach their
return tickets on their visa applications if they apply for a
stay of at least six months.
</P>
<P>
Besides the revision, the MAC has also worked out many measures
to improve the government's management of the movements of
Chinese professionals in Taiwan.
