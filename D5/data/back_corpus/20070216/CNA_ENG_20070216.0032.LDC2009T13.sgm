President Chen Shui-bian expressed his admiration toward members
of an unusual local dance troupe Friday, saying he was deeply
touched  by the beauty  of their dance demonstration.

Chen made the remarks during a meeting at the Presidential Office
with the Bird and Water dance troupe made up of physically
challenged dancers.

Troupe director Yen Tsuei-chen told the president she was driven
to teach the physically challenged how to dance by her desire to
help the impaired live with confidence and hope.

Chen said he has been impressed by their frequent performances in
schools, prisons and charity activities, and praised the dancers
for their courage and determination.

He described the dancers as beautiful butterflies who become
brighter and more willing to help others through dance, like the
metamorphosis of a pupa transforming into a butterfly, he said,
adding he is happy to know that the troupe has decided to attend
the ninth Asian dance competition to be held in Japan later this
year.
