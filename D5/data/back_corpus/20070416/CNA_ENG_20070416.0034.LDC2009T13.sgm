CHUNGHWA TELECOM MANAGEMENT DEFENDS CHAIRMAN'S PERFORMANCE
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,   April  16  (CNA) 04/16/07  21:35:23 (By Elizabeth Hsu)

<P>
The management  of the partially state-owned Chunghwa Telecom Co.
issued a written statement Monday in an attempt to push back
against an online campaign launched by the company's labor union
to bring a no-confidence vote against company Chairman Ho Chen-
tan.
</P>
<P>
In the statement, Chunghwa Telecom management criticized the
campaign as a "politically-charged" attempt by the union to
mislead non-unionized company employees and stock buyers, as well
as the public into believing that management has treated its
workers poorly.
</P>
<P>
The statement also defended Ho's management, arguing that since
Ho took office four years ago he has spared no efforts in guiding
the company through the challenges posed by privatization and
structural reforms. The chairman has also worked to boost the
company's post-tax profits above the NT$4 per share level, the
statement explained.
</P>
<P>
Since the company's chairmanship is elected by board members, the
management will not approve the labor union's attempt to
overthrow the current chairman through a vote of non-confidence.
</P>
<P>
The Chunghwa Telecom Workers' Union has been protesting against
management's efforts to streamline the company by planning to lay
off 1,600 workers in the coming years.
