Legislative Speaker Wang Jin-pyng said Monday that he will lead a
delegation to China "when the time is ripe."
</P>
<P>
Wang made the remarks in Kaohsiung County, southern Taiwan, where
he attended an economic forum amid reports that he will visit
China later this month.
</P>
<P>
He said he has worked for more than a year on China travel plan
and that there are a lot of issues to discuss, including direct
trade, postal and transport links between the two sides of the
Taiwan Strait, Taiwan agricultural exports to China and Chinese
tourists coming to Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Asked whether he will visit China in his capacity as the speaker
of the legislature,  Wang said that China will probably have
reservations about that, although the two sides will coordinate
on the most suitable title under which he will be allowed entry.
</P>
<P>
In addition to visiting Beijing and Shanghai, Wang said he will
also visit Xiamen in Fujian Province for the first time to pay
his respects at the tomb of his ancestors and visit relatives.
