PENGHU GROUP EMBARKS ON CHINA VISIT VIA KINMEN
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Taipei,  April  16 (CNA) 04/16/07  20:30:30 (By Flor Wang)

A 130-member group from the offshore Penghu County took a maiden
charter flight Monday to the outlying Kinmen Island, where they
boarded a ferry heading for China's Fujian Province for a four-
day visit.
</P>
<P>
It was the first Penghu delegation to travel to China via the so-
called "mini three links" -- direct shipping and trade services
between Taiwan's Kinmen and Matsu islands and Fujian ports of
Xiamen, Quanzhou and Mawei that lie opposite on the other side of
the Taiwan Strait -- after the central government in Taipei
announced April 1 the inclusion of Penghu in the "mini links"
program.
</P>
<P>
The group, composed of Penghu county government officials,
councilors and representatives from the local tourism sector,
plans to sponsor three rounds of presentations to sell Penghu to
locals in Xiamen, Fuzhou and Quanzhou.
</P>
<P>
Kinmen Magistrate Lee Chu-feng saw them off from Shuitou Port and
hailed Penghu's inclusion in the "mini links" as mutually
beneficial for both Kinmen and Penghu. Lee said that he plans to
organize a seminar with the Matsu and Penghu authorities to
explore the maximum benefit of the "mini links" for the three
outlying islands.
</P>
<P>
Legislator Lin Ping-kun, who led the delegation, voiced his keen
desire for allowing direct weekend cross-strait charter flights
from Penghu, making its Makung airport a key hub like the Taoyuan
and Kaohsiung international airports that already serve direct
charter flights to China on special holidays.
</P>
<P>
Penghu County Council Speaker Liu Chen Chao-ling called the "mini
links via Kinmen" the fastest route for Penghu residents bound
for China.
</P>
<P>
She expressed the hope that direct charter flight services
between Makung and Kinmen, which officially kicked off that same
day, could be offered on a regular basis in the short term to
help attract Chinese tourists to the island and improve the local
economy.
</P>
<P>
Penghu Magistrate Wang Chien-fa also witnessed the ceremony to
kick off the maiden Penghu-Kinmen charter flight, operated by UNI
Airways, at Makung airport.
</P>
<P>
Wang called for wider opening by the central government for
Penghu in cross- strait exchanges and described Penghu's
inclusion in the "mini links," set up in January 2001, as a step
forward.
