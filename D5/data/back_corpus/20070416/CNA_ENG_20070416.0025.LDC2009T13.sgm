ELECTION

Taipei,  April 16 (CNA) 04/16/07  19:37:23 (By Lilian Wu)

The Presidential Office, the Executive Yuan and the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) will push for holding a
national referendum in tandem with the 2008 presidential
election, DPP acting Chairman Trong Chai said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Chai said that holding a national referendum on such issues as
retrieving the ill-gotten assets of the main opposition
Kuomintang and joining the United Nations under the name of
Taiwan simultaneously with the presidential election will save
money and raise the turnout rate for a national referendum.
</P>
<P>
Other democratic countries such as the United States have adopted
such an approach, he said.
</P>
<P>
KMT spokesman Su Chun-ping dismissed the DPP suggestion as an
election gambit and said: "We despise their intention."
</P>
<P>
KMT Legislator and Policy Committee Executive Director Tseng
Yung-chuan said that the Organic Law of the Central Election
Commission (CEC) is yet to be passed in the legislature, but the
CEC will be able to decide on whether to combine the elections in
line with the wishes of the DPP administration, which he said
will not conform to "election justice."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, DPP Secretary-General Lin Chia-lung said that
President Chen Shui- bian discussed the issue with officials last
year and reached a consensus on holding legislative elections and
the presidential election in the same year, claiming that doing
so would not involve revising the law and would only require an
Executive Yuan decision.
</P>
<P>
If the two elections  could be combined  with a national
referendum, it would be even better, Lin said. But it remains
uncertain whether the next legislative and presidential elections
can be combined.
</P>
<P>
The DPP has launched a drive to retrieve the ill-gotten assets of
the KMT through a national referendum and has set July as the
deadline for collecting 1 million signatures to put it to a
national referendum.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the DPP Central Standing Committee approved a
petition proposal to join the United Nations under the name of
Taiwan through a referendum, and the party has set May 20 to
complete the first-stage of collecting 100,000 signatures to make
the proposal valid.
</P>
<P>
President Chen has echoed a call by a nuclear-free promotion
group to revise the referendum law to lower the threshold of
signatures needed to put an issue to national referendum. The
Executive Yuan also discussed the issue in a coordination meeting
with the DPP.
