EPA SAYS IT HAS CLEARED DIOXIN CONTAMINATION SOURCE IN TAINAN
</HEADLINE>

Taipei, April 16 (CNA) 04/16/07  20:00:45 (By Han Nai-kuo)
</P>
<P>
The Cabinet-level Environmental Protection Administration (EPA)
has prevented dioxin pollution from a defunct chemical factory in
Tainan from affecting human health since 2003, an EPA official
claimed Monday.
</P>
<P>
Huang Wan-chu, executive secretary of an EPA committee in charge
of a fund for the remediation of polluted soil, made the remarks
in response to a report by the Chinese-language China Times that
residents living near the site of the closed chemical factory in
the southern city have extremely high levels of dioxin in their
blood.
</P>
<P>
A study conducted by National Cheng Kung University at the
request of the Tainan city government tested the blood samples of
570 residents living in Tainan's An- nan district, where the
chemical factory operated between 1942 and 1982.
</P>
<P>
The results of the study show that 72 percent of them have much
higher levels of dioxin in their blood than the tolerance limit
set by the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
Dioxins are known carcinogens which can cause birth defects,
diabetes, immune system abnormalities and many other adverse
health effects if they accumulate in the body in large amounts.
</P>
<P>
Huang pointed out that the EPA has used more than NT$110 million
since 2003 to remove contamination  sources  and monitor soil
conditions and water quality in fish ponds around the former site
of the now defunct Anshun factory of Taiwan Alkali Industrial
Corp.
</P>
<P>
He also said that in July 2005, the Ministry of Economic Affairs
agreed to set aside NT$1.3 billion over five years to help the
affected residents.
</P>
<P>
Huang said the high dioxin levels in the blood of residents near
the closed factory was due to the accumulation of toxins over a
long period.
</P>
<P>
The factory in question, which was set up by the Japanese in 1942
to produce hydrochloric acid, caustic soda, and liquid chlorine,
became a state-owned company the year after Japan's surrender in
1945.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Petroleum Corp. (CPC), another state-owned enterprise,
bought all the shares of Taiwan Alkali in 1967. The factory was
merged in 1983 with CPC's subsidiary, China Petrochemical
Development Corp., which went private in 1994.
</P>
<P>
For decades, residents living around the factory grew farm
produce and raised fish in ponds without any knowledge of the
pollution hazard.
</P>
<P>
Recently declassified government documents show that the Ministry
of Economic Affairs became aware in 1982 that mercury
concentrations in the fish catch from the area exceeded safe
levels for human consumption.
</P>
<P>
Many seriously ill residents have been seeking state compensation
on grounds that the factory was owned by the government. They
have also complained that the monthly allowance of some NT$1,800
per person from a state fund is too meager to pay for their
medical bills and other expenses.
