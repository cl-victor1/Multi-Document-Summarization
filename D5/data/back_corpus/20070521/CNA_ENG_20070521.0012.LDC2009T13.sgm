REFERENDUMS BEST WAY TO RESOLVE CONTROVERSIAL ISSUES: EX-DPP HEAD
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  May 21 (CNA) 05/21/07  17:11:47 (By Lilian Wu)

<P>
Former chairman of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP),
Lin Yi-hsiung, said Monday that disputes are best resolved
through referendums,  including  the most recent controversy
surrounding the name-change of the Chiang Kai-shek Memorial Hall.
</P>
<P>
Lin made the remarks amid the controversy surrounding the re-
naming of the hall as the National Taiwan Democracy Memorial Hall
Saturday as part of the government's efforts to shed the last
vestiges of the late president Chiang Kai- shek's authoritarian
rule. The hall was built nearly 30 years ago to honor Chiang, who
died in 1975.
</P>
<P>
The Taipei City government fined the hall's administration over
last two days after the central government covered the flanks of
the hall, designated as a heritage site by the municipal
government, with large banners.
</P>
<P>
Lin noted  that "there  are no other good ways to solve
controversies in Taiwan, which result in constant bickering and
wrangling in the Legislative Yuan."
</P>
<P>
"This is why I have always advocated using referendums to resolve
such disputes," Lin said, adding that "any such controversies can
be worked out by giving the public the opportunity to vote on the
issues."
</P>
<P>
Lin said that this is the reason why he has advocated an
amendment to the present Referendum Law to lower the thresholds
for proposing and holding referendums.
</P>
<P>
He dismissed the possibility of the nation becoming even more
divided if all sorts of controversial issues are put to a public
vote, noting that more than 100 proposals are put to a referendum
in every election in California, and the state "has been able to
handle them well."
