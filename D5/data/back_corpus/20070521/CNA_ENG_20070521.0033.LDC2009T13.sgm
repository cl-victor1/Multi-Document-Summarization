</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  May 21 (CNA) 05/21/07  21:48:08 (By Elizabeth Hsu)

<P>
New Premier Chang Chun-hsiung unveiled four major administrative
directions for his Cabinet Monday on which he instructed it to
begin work at once.
</P>
<P>
Chang laid out his plans at the first meeting of the new Cabinet
that he convened hours after receiving the official seal of
office from his predecessor, Su Tseng-chang, in a change-over
ceremony at the Executive Yuan.
</P>
<P>
Chang told his Cabinet members that they will focus on four
topics -- maintaining political stability in the Taiwan Strait
while making efforts to seek prosperity for the two sides of the
strait; increasing investment; stemming corruption and bribery;
and taking care of the disadvantaged.
</P>
<P>
On the first topic, Chang said efforts have to be made to defend
Taiwan's peace, democracy and freedom at the same time as dealing
with crass-strait affairs such as proposals to open Taiwan to
Chinese tourists and setting up direct cargo and passenger cross-
strait flight services.
</P>
<P>
He also instructed his team to carry out the "active management,
effective opening" policy that President Chen Shui-bian initiated
in 2006 as the new mindset and course of action for Taiwan's
future cross-strait economic and trade policies, while trying to
resolve cross-strait disputes through peaceful dialogue.
</P>
<P>
Chang also expressed hope that the two sides can hold talks on
topics of mutual interest without setting political conditions in
order for the two sides to establish a stable structure for
peaceful interaction between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
On the second topic, the premier told his Cabinet to take
efficient measures to attract foreign investors to Taiwan,
including assisting foreign enterprises in resolving investment
problems in land and information acquisition, as well as taxation
and loans.
</P>
<P>
Addressing his third administrative direction, Chang said he
believes efforts to prevent corruption among public servants and
politicians are of equal importance as cracking down on such
practices. Therefore, he said, special units will be commissioned
to fight corruption and bribery in the upcoming elections this
year and next, he noted.
</P>
<P>
On his final point, Chang said he will continue his predecessor's
"Mega Investment, Mega Warmth" projects in a drive to systemize
efforts to realize the ideas of fairness and justice for the
less-privileged.
</P>
<P>
Chang, who served as premier between 2000 and 2002 during Chen's
first term, was named premier May 14 to replace Su, who resigned
after being defeated in the ruling Democratic Progressive Party's
(DPP's) primary for the presidential election.
</P>
<P>
His first term as premier ended in January 2002, shortly after
the DPP failed to perform as well as expected in the legislative
elections held at the end of 2001.
