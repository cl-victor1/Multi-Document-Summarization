DENTISTS LAUNCH BOYCOTT OF JAPANESE FIRM OVER INSULTING REMARKS

Taipei,  May 21 (CNA) 05/21/07  22:57:35 (By T.C. Jiang)

<P>
The dental sector in Taiwan has initiated a boycott of a CEO of a
Japanese dental material company who recently made insulting
remarks about Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
The boycott came after Makoto Nakao, CEO of GC Dental Equipment
Corp., issued a public apology Sunday in a Japanese newspaper for
his remarks.
</P>
<P>
The Taiwanese dentists said Nakao was not sincere enough and
therefore initiated the boycott against the company, said Chan
Hsun-cheng, director-general of the Taiwan Dental Association.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese company earns NT$1 billion (US$30 million) from
Taiwan every year, Chan noted, adding that the association has
asked its members not to use the company's products.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Minister of Health Chen Shih-chung, a former head of the
association, expressed his support and said the remarks were
inappropriate and also disrespectful to Japanese tourists in
Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Nakao wrote on his Web site after visiting Taiwan in April that
"fewer Europeans and Americans have breakfast at hotels in
Taiwan" and that "businesses in Taiwan have gone to China. Taiwan
now only has Japanese ladies who go to the National Palace Museum
to see the things stolen from China."
