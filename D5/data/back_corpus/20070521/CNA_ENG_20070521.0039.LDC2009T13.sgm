GOV'T INFORMATION OFFICE SHOULD BE 'GOOD IDEA OFFICE': NEW CHIEF
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taipei, May 21 (CNA) 05/21/07  23:46:09 (By Sofia Wu)

<P>
The Government Information Office (GIO) should be a "good idea
office," the agency's new head said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Shieh Jhy-wey, Taiwan's current representative to Germany who is
scheduled to take over the helm at the GIO June 11, made the
remarks while briefing the press on his new job.
</P>
<P>
Shieh, who has always been known for his quick wit and sense of
humor, said the GIO minister used to be reputed as the
"government's make-up artist."
</P>
<P>
"My opinion is that the GIO minister should be a 'Taiwan image'
salesperson," Shieh said, adding that his two-year tenure as the
country's top representative in Germany would contribute to
fulfilling his new mission as the GIO minister and the
government's spokesman.
</P>
<P>
"What I have been doing in Germany over the past two years is to
introduce things-related to Taiwan to Germans. As the GIO head, I
would have to sell Taiwan to all countries around the world. I
need good ideas to accomplish my duties," he added.
