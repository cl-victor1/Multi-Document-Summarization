The global warming effects impacting all mankind are "actually
the effects of the human mind and its insatiable desires," a
lecturer quoted Master Cheng Yen, founder of the Buddhist
Compassionate Relief Tzu Chi Foundation, as saying Monday.
</P>
<P>
In a special report presented at a monthly meeting of the
Presidential Office, Ho Jih-sheng, spokesman for the foundation,
said that, as Master Cheng Yen has often preached to her
disciples, natural disasters  are rooted in man-made misfortunes,
or the "collective karma" of mankind.
</P>
<P>
He quoted the master as saying that the endless expansion of
human desires has caused irreparable damage to the earth's
resources by depleting the forests and emitting unsustainable
amounts of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
As the global population has been increasing, fresh water
resources have been dwindling, and the area of livable land is
expected to shrink as a result of the inevitable sea level rise
due to global warming, Ho said.
</P>
<P>
He also said that the widening gap between the rich and the poor
and the rapid increase in the number of people living in poverty
are the problems faced by all countries, and that the best
solution to the problems lies in the "expansion of human love."
</P>
<P>
Concluding his report, Ho again quoted Master Cheng Yen and
claimed that Taiwan has "nothing else to treasure but love," and
that the people of Taiwan should make Taiwan "the most
distinguished island of love in the world" by beginning with
themselves.
