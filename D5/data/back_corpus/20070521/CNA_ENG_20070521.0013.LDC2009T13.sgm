American Institute in Taiwan (AIT) Taipei Office Director Stephen
M. Young said Monday that Taiwan's further opening of its
economic relationship with China is an important way to improve
the trade partnership between the United States and Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Young made the remarks while delivering a speech in the Chinese
language during the annual assembly of the Taipei-based Chinese
National Association of Industry and Commerce.
</P>
<P>
Young said that Taiwan is America's ninth-largest trade partner,
and the United States is working hard to make the bilateral trade
relationship even stronger.
</P>
<P>
The Trade and Investment Framework Agreement, or TIFA, is
currently the most effective channel for this purpose, Young
pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Young also mentioned that Taiwan has expressed interest in a free
trade agreement (FTA) with the United States, but he stressed
that with the expiration of Trade Promoting Authority in July,
the United States is not in a position to consider new FTA
partners at this time.
</P>
<P>
"With this in mind, however, we are open to considering other
mechanisms to advance bilateral economic cooperation that make
sense to both sides," he added.
</P>
<P>
Young also praised Taiwan for having made significant progress in
the protection of intellectual property rights and voiced the
hope that the nation will continue its efforts in this regard.
</P>
<P>
In addition, he said, Taiwan should continue efforts to build an
efficient health care system that is financially sound and driven
by market forces while expanding market access in financial and
other services.
</P>
<P>
Progress in these areas will not only help Taiwan-U.S. trade
relations,  it will also contribute to growth by creating an
environment that rewards innovation, Young said, adding that this
is increasingly important as Taiwan evolves into a knowledge-
based economy.
</P>
<P>
Touching on cross-Taiwan Strait economic relations, Young said
that further cross-strait economic opening will help improve
Taiwan's global competitiveness. It will help Taiwan achieve the
goal of becoming a regional center for logistics, finance and
other services, and it will also help U.S. firms enhance their
position on both sides of the Taiwan Strait by taking advantage
of their close relationship with Taiwan.
