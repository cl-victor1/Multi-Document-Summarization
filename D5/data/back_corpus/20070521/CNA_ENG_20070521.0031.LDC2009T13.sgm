PROPOSED FTAAP CAN OFFSET TAIWAN BEING MARGINALIZED: PRESIDENT
</HEADLINE>

Singapore, May 21 (CNA) 05/21/07  21:26:48 (By Kang Shih-jen and

President Chen Shui-bian said Monday that the establishment of a
proposed Free Trade Area of the Asia Pacific (FTAAP) will help
reduce the impact of Taiwan's marginalization from regional
economic integration.
</P>
<P>
Chen made the remarks during an exclusive  interview with
reporters from Singapore-based Channel NewsAsia that was aired
Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and three East
Asian countries -- China, Japan and South Korea -- have set up
the "ASEAN Plus Three" mechanism with the aim of establishing an
East Asian community, but Taiwan is excluded from the mechanism
due to China's obstruction, triggering concern that Taiwan will
be marginalized economically, Chen said.
</P>
<P>
Noting that Taiwan and ASEAN have maintained close economic and
trade exchanges, Chen said Taiwan is ASEAN's fourth-largest trade
partner, with two-way trade volume reaching around US$50 billion
last year.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Chen pointed out, cumulative investment by Taiwanese
manufacturers in ASEAN member states has also amounted to around
US$50 billion.
</P>
<P>
However, Chen lamented that Taiwan has been ignored by its trade
partners and marginalized in the growing regional economic
integration because China has been seeking to break Taiwan's
partnership with ASEAN.
</P>
<P>
Against this backdrop, Taiwan is looking forward to signing free
trade agreements (FTAs) with its trade partners, Chen said,
adding that the nation has so far inked FTAs with Panama,
Guatemala, Nicaragua, Honduras and El Salvador.
</P>
<P>
Chen said Taiwan also looks forward to signing an FTA with the
United States and that both sides are conducting bilateral
negotiations under the Trade and Investment Framework Agreement
(TIFA).
</P>
<P>
As a member of the World Trade Organization, Taiwan is willing to
do what it can to make contributions to the international trade
system, Chen pointed out.
</P>
<P>
The president also disclosed that this year's informal leadership
summit of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum is
scheduled to be held in Australia and that Australian Prime
Minister John Howard has sent him a letter mentioning that APEC
leaders will continue to discuss the issue initiated by U.S.
President George W. Bush of establishing an FTAAP.
