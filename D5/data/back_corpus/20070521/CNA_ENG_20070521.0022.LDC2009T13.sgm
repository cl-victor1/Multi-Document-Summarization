election, said Monday that Premier Chang Chun-hsiung will serve

In response to media inquiries, Hsieh also revealed part of the

team, according to Hsieh.

In addition to Chang, DPP Chairman Yu Shyi-kun will be the
commander-in-chief of Hsieh's campaign activities, while former
Minister of Labor Affairs Lee Ying- yuan has been invited to
