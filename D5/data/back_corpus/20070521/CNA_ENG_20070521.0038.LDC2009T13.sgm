OLYMPIC TORCH WELCOME IF SOVEREIGNTY NOT DOWNGRADED: PRESIDENT
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Singapore, May 21 (CNA) 05/21/07  23:13:53 (By Charles Kang and
T.C. Jiang)
</P>
<P>
President Chen Shui-bian has said Taiwan hopes that the 2008
Beijing Olympic torch relay can come to the country, but not if
it were to mean Taiwan having its sovereignty compromised.
</P>
<P>
Chen made the remarks during an exclusive  interview with the
Singapore-based Channel NewsAsia, which was aired Monday.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan has rejected China's offer of including Taipei as a leg on
China's "domestic" route.
</P>
<P>
Chen said the Chinese Taipei Olympic Committee (CTOC) is willing
to continue negotiating with Beijing and the International
Olympic Committee (IOC) over the torch issue, according to an
advance transcript of the interview released before it was
broadcast.
</P>
<P>
If Taiwan is not downgraded to the level of the first stop on
China's domestic route, then the torch is welcome to come to
Taiwan, the president stressed.
</P>
<P>
Asked whether it will be more of a loss than a gain to
"politically interpret an athletic gesture, " or whether or not
the international community will understand Taiwan's stance on
the issue, Chen responded by asking what the Singapore government
and people would think if China tried including Singapore as a
"domestic" stop.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan's national identity should be very clear, Chen said.
</P>
<P>
Chen asked why China does not follow the model of the 1964 Tokyo
Olympic Games torch relay in which the torch came to Taiwan from
the Philippines and then went on to Japan.
</P>
<P>
Chen said the torch could come to Taiwan from North Korea and
then go to Vietnam and Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
He questioned why Beijing suggested the torch first go to
Vietnam, and then Taiwan, followed by Hong Kong and Macao, if it
was not "politically interpreting an athletic gesture."
</P>
<P>
He said it is unacceptable that China tried to describe Taiwan as
a domestic stop, treating Taiwan as part of the People's Republic
of China.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong and Macao are special administrative regions of China,
Chen said, adding that they are China's local governments, not
sovereign countries.
</P>
<P>
As a sovereign country, Taiwan welcomes the torch, but cannot
make any concession where its sovereignty is harmed, Chen noted,
adding that it is not a matter of separating sports from
politics.
