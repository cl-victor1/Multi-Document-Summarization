PREMIER NIXES PROPORTIONAL FORMULA FOR MAKEUP OF ELECTION
COMMISSION
</HEADLINE>

Taipei, March 16 (CNA) 03/16/07  17:01:10 (By Lilian Wu)

<P>
Premier Su Tseng-chang said Friday that he can't accept the
proposal that the Central Election Commission (CEC) be made up of
members recommended by various political parties in proportion to
their seats in the Legislative Yuan.
</P>
<P>
The premier made the remarks while fielding questions at the
legislature, one day after a draft Organic Law of the CEC
proposed by the opposition was again stalled in the legislature.
</P>
<P>
At stake is the composition of the next CEC. Under current
regulations, the premier will nominate between 11 and 19 CEC
members for appointment by the president for a three-year term.
The number of the members of one party affiliation should not
exceed two-fifths of the total.
</P>
<P>
The opposition, believing that present CEC members have clearly
tilted toward the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) , has
proposed that the lineup be patterned on the formation of the
National Communications Commission (NCC), which has largely
followed the proportions of the political parties.
</P>
<P>
According to the opposition's draft proposal for a 17-member CEC,
six members each, drawn from the "pan-green camp" led by the DPP
and the "pan-blue alliance" composed of the Kuomintang and the
People First Party, will be chosen, while the remaining five
seats will be produced through negotiations among various
political parties.
</P>
<P>
"I don't think that the formation of the CEC should be patterned
on the NCC," Su stressed.
</P>
<P>
He said that no one individual party should dominate the CEC.
Further, the Constitution stipulates a division of power
government system, so any attempt by the "pan-blue alliance --
which enjoys a slim majority in the legislature -- to sway the
CEC will go against the Constitution as well as an encroachment
on the executive power by the legislature.
</P>
<P>
He expressed his hope that the opposition will not insist on
tying passage of the Organic Law of the CEC to the annual budget
of the central government for 2007, which he said should have
been passed by November 2006.
</P>
<P>
Failing to pass the annual budget will affect the economic
development of the nation, he said, noting that each month that
passes without its approval will result in the drop of the gross
domestic product.
</P>
<P>
Su promised that when he nominates the new members of the CEC, he
will follow the law and the spirit of the Constitution. He said
that he will solicit public views and act in a fair and just
manner in reaching his decision.
