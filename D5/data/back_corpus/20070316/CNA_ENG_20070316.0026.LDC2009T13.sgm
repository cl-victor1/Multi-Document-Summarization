Former Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Ma Yin-jeou criticized the
Kaohsiung city government Friday for what he called a "rude"
demolition of the statue of the late President Chiang Kai-shek
located in the municipal cultural center.
</P>
<P>
Ma made the remarks to reporters after a breakfast meeting with
Dr. Jan Grotheer, president of the Tax High Court of Hamburg,
Germany.
</P>
<P>
Accusing the Kaohsiung city government of being uncouth and harsh
in dealing with the statue, which it wished to dismantle and
remove from the city, Ma said that he found it deplorable that
the statue was disassembled such that it will be extremely
difficult to restore it to its original condition.
</P>
<P>
"The ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) has been very
incompetent in administering the country, but it is very good at
purging historic figures as a means of shifting public attention
away from its poor performance, " Ma claimed, and condemned what
he called the DPP's "inappropriate" approach.
</P>
<P>
The DPP could have been more lenient in handling the statue now
that Chiang has passed into history, he argued.
</P>
<P>
The Kaohsiung city government, administered by Mayor Chen Chu of
the DPP, pulled down a huge statue of the late president at the
Kaohsiung Chiang Kai-shek Cultural Center Tuesday evening, and
transported its broken pieces to Tahsi township in northern
Taoyuan county, where the late president's mausoleum is located.
</P>
<P>
In response to outside criticism over the demolition operation,
Kaohsiung's mayor said later Friday that the removal of the
Chiang's statue and a plaque bearing his name had nothing to do
with politics. It was only a move to allow the cultural center to
better serve its original purpose and become more diversified,
she insisted.
</P>
<P>
It was the first time that Chen has spoken on the issue, and she
called for public understanding if the implementation was
somewhat flawed.
</P>
<P>
The removal of Chiang's statue is in line with a name change
campaign rekindled in recent months by the DPP to highlight
Taiwan's sovereignty independent from China.
