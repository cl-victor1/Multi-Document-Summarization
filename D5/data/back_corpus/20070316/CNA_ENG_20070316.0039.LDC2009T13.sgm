A charity organization is urging the public to provide more
attention and care for children who are witness to domestic
violence, as the number of such children is increasing, a
spokesman for the charity said Friday.

According to government statistics, the number of domestic
violence cases reported in Taiwan has been on the rise in recent
years, the Taiwan Good Shepherd Sisters Social Welfare Services
said at a press conference Thursday.

The number was over 42,000 in 2003 and 53,000 in 2004, the
spokesman noted, adding that in 2005, the number surpassed
66,000.

Children who witness domestic violence suffer negative influences
in the long run, the spokesman said, warning that some such
children might have a tendency to commit suicide or suffer from
depression in the future.
