PREMIER WON'T ALLOW REPEAT OF MAJOR BANK LOAN DEFAULTS
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  March 16 (CNA) 03/16/07  19:07:57 (By Lilian Wu)

<P>
Premier Su Tseng-chang said Friday the Cabinet will not allow
major defaults on bank loans to take place again.
</P>
<P>
The premier made the remarks in the wake of the publication of
lists of defaulters by various banks over the past two days,
which showed that nearly 1,500 major loan defaulters collectively
had owed the banks an accumulated NT$371.93 billion (US$11.27
billion) in bad loans as of last June.
</P>
<P>
The publication  of the names of major defaulters was in
accordance with the Financial Supervisory Commission's
instruction that all banks, including foreign bank branches in
Taiwan, should post the details of major bad loan accounts on
their Websites by mid-March.
</P>
<P>
The top bank loan defaulter is former Kaohsiung City Council
Speaker Chu An- hsiung, whose three companies -- An Feng Steel,
Feng An Metal Industrial and Jenn An Steel -- owe a total of
NT$16.46 billion. Chu, who has been placed on Taiwan's most
wanted list over a vote-buying charge and other financial
scandals, fled the country in October 2003.
</P>
<P>
The premier  said that from the published  list of major
defaulters, one can see that the previous Kuomintang
administration should take the blame.
</P>
<P>
He noted that since the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)
took power in 2000, it has worked with the banks to write off
their non-performing loans and has seen good results.
</P>
<P>
The government will not allow the repeat of the major defaults on
bank loans, nor will it allow government officials to collude
with bank officials to get easy loans.
</P>
<P>
The premier didn't answer questions on how the government is
going to help collect the bad loans since some of the major
defaulters have already fled the country.
