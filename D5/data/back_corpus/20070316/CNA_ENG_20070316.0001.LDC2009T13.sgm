The second and final day of disclosures of the names of major

collectively owed the banks NT$371.93 billion as of last June.

Speaker Chu An- hsiung's three companies, An Feng Steel, Feng An
Metal Industrial and Jenn An Steel, combined top the list of loan
defaulters with a total of NT$16.46 billion in bad loans.

Ever Fortune Industrial and Yamay International, both of Yang
Tien-sheng, together owed NT$13.8 billion, and come in second

The Financial Supervisory Commission (FSC) ordered banks to
disclose information regarding major loan defaults at the request
of the Executive  Yuan following the application  for bankruptcy
protection by China Rebar Co. and Chia Hsin Food and Synthetic
Fiber Co., two publicly listed companies owned by business tycoon
Wang You-theng, on Dec. 29 last year. The failure of those
businesses caused a financial storm affecting the two companies'
many private shareholders.
