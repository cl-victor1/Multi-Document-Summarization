DEBTS: FSC

Taipei, March 16 (CNA) 03/16/07  12:13:22 (By Sofia Wu)

The decree that requires banks to disclose details of clients who
have defaulted on loans exceeding NT$100 million (US$3.02
million)  is aimed at compelling those loan defaulters to repay
their debts, the nation's top financial regulator said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Financial Supervisory Commission (FSC) Chairman Hu Sheng-cheng
was referring to the commission's March 1 announcement that all
banks, including foreign bank branches in Taiwan, should post the
details of major bad loan accounts on their Web sites by mid-
March.
</P>
<P>
"It is hoped that the disclosure will exert increased pressure on
big debtors to repay their bank loans, " Hu said, adding that
banks are expected to vigorously seek repayment of some of the
huge non-performing loans under the existing legal mechanism.
</P>
<P>
According to information revealed by various banks over the past
two days, nearly 1,500 major loan defaulters had owed the banks
an accumulated NT$371.93 billion in bad loans as of last June.
</P>
<P>
Most of those on the list are disgraced tycoons who have gone on
the lam to avoid prosecution over various irregularities. The top
bank loan defaulter is former Kaohsiung City Council Speaker Chu
An-hsiung, whose three companies -- An Feng Steel, Feng An Metal
Industrial and Jenn An Steel -- owed a total of NT$16.46 billion.
Chu, who has been placed on Taiwan's most wanted list over a
vote-buying charge and other financial scandals, fled abroad in
October, 2003.
</P>
<P>
Other major defaulters on the list are the Ever Fortune and Yamay
Group, led by Yang Tien-sheng, with an accumulated NT$13.8
billion in unpaid loans, followed by the Chinese Automobile
Group, led by Chang Chao-hsiang and his brother Chang Chao-liang,
with NT$8.4 billion in unpaid loans.
</P>
<P>
Other notorious defaulters include Chen You-hao's Tuntex Group,
which owes NT$7.66 billion; former Legislator Wong Ta-ming's
Hualon Group, owing NT$5.9 billion; and Procomp Informatic Co.,
with NT$4.12 billion in unpaid loans.
</P>
<P>
On the creditors front, Chang Hwa Commercial Bank topped the
list, with an accumulated NT$52 billion in bad loans; followed by
Mega International Commercial Bank, at NT$32.9 billion; and Bank
of Taiwan, at NT$32.1 billion.
</P>
<P>
Nearly all the top 10 creditor banks are wholly or partially
state-owned banks. Finance Ministry officials said that reducing
the non-performing loan ratio has been one of the key policy
goals in state-owned banks management. Streamlining management
and internal oversight is also a major task in dealing with banks
in which the government has a stake, the officials added.
</P>
<P>
The FSC's bad debtors disclosure initiative was inspired by the
discovery that management of Rebar Asia Pacific Group, founded by
Wang You-theng, had embezzled a whopping NT$73 billion from its
member companies, including the Chinese Bank. Wang and his wife
went on the lam shortly before the scandal broke early this year.
The Chinese Bank has been taken over by the government.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Taiwan Thinktank Chairman Chen Po-chih, an economist
who once served as chairman of the Cabinet-level Council for
Economic Planning and Development, said that besides striving to
bring to justice fugitive loan defaulters, efforts should also be
made to identify which financial officials and bank executives
should be held responsible for endorsing such large sums in loans
from state- owned banks in the past.
</P>
<P>
"All those financial officials and bank managers should explain
why they agreed to so many questionable loans in the first place.
They should be held accountable to taxpayers and history, " he
said.
