Police published on Friday the photo of one of two gunmen who
disarmed a police officer and killed a passing motorist before
hijacking another vehicle in Liuchia, Tainan County and escaping
the previous day.

<P>
The man's image was caught on camera at a convenience store in
Chiayi City. Police were led to the store by an invoice left in
the car abandoned by the gunmen on an expressway.

<P>
Police aired the photo of the man on local TV channels, calling
on the public to come forward with information about the man's
identity.

Police also said the two officers, who chased the two men's
vehicle on to the expressway and had one of their firearms taken
away by a gunman, were careless in carrying out their duties, but
are not otherwise to blame for their handling of the incident.

The incident took place Thursday night when two expressway police
officers in a squad car began to pursue a speeding black car
which ignored their order to stop on the shoulder of the highway
in Tainan County.

The chase ended in Liuchia where the speeding car rammed into the
median of an exit ramp.

When the two police officers exited their car and approached the
two men, one of the men grabbed an officer's gun and fired,
fortunately missing the officer.

At the same time, the other man pulled out a gun and attempted to
hijack a passing car. The driver attempted to speed away, only to
be shot in left shoulder through the window, causing his vehicle
to immediately swerve off the road and into a ditch running along
the highway.

<P>
The gunman then stopped another car, forced its female driver out
and driving away with his companion, who kept the two police
officer at bay by pointing the gun at them.

The wounded motorist died from blood loss after being sent to a
nearby hospital.
