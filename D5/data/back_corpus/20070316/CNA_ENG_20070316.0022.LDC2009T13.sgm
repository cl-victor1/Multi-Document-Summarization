Some ring-back tones meant to be humorous are causing confusion
and even shock according to the National Communications
Commission (NCC) which said Friday that it would persuade
telephone companies to stop offering them.
</P>
<P>
A ring-back tone is the audible sound heard by the calling party
while waiting to establish a connection.
</P>
<P>
Examples of ring-back tones of concern include: Due to a national
security enhancement measure, this phone call will be wiretapped,
andCongratulations! You have just become our lucky customer! From
now on every phone call you make is free of charge however long
you talk!
</P>
<P>
Citing these ring-back tones in a news conference, Democratic
Progressive Party legislator Huang Wei-cher called on the NCC to
consider whether such messages havegone too far.
</P>
<P>
It's not funny, he commented on the tones, saying uniformed
callers may be scared and confused.
</P>
<P>
Chief of the NCC's Mobile Communication Section Chen Ying-ti
agreed with Huang at the conference and said the NCC will examine
ring-back tone services.
</P>
<P>
Chen said the NCC will persuade telecommunications operators to
stop providing controversial ring-back tones. In serious cases,
in which the services hamperpublic order or good morals, he said,
the Telecommunications Act permits the authorities to order the
company to terminate the offending service.
