KMT WON'T OPPOSE BILL TO CLOSE LEGAL LOOPHOLES ON SPECIAL
ALLOWANCES
</HEADLINE>

Taipei, Jan. 27 (CNA) 01/27/07  19:21:16 (By Maubo Chang)

<P>
The opposition Kuomintang (KMT) legislative caucus won't oppose
any attempt by the executive branch to close the legal loopholes
in the rules regulating the use of special allowances for senior
officials through revisions, a KMT legislator said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Legislator Tseng Yung-chuan, who doubles as head of the party's
Policy Coordination Committee, noted that the Directorate General
of Budget, Accounting and Statistics under the Executive Yuan
formulated the rules governing the use of the special allowances
and has the authority  to explain the rules in the event of any
related controversies that may arise, adding that the KMT won't
oppose any draft revisions put forward by it to address legal
issues stemming from the rules.
</P>
<P>
Noting that there are about 20,000 incumbent and former holders
of senior offices who might run afoul of the law for not using
their allowances strictly according to the "defective" rules,
Tseng said any revision to the rules should be applied
retroactively so former officials will be cleared of any possible
violations.
</P>
<P>
However, Tseng said, the special state affairs fund budgeted for
the president's discretionary use is different from other
officials' special allowances, adding that the KMT caucus won't
support any attempt to revise the law to preempt criminal charges
against first lady Wu Shu-jen for helping her husband claim the
funds with others' invoices.
</P>
<P>
Wu has been indicted on forgery and corruption charges, and the
president, who was spared only because of his constitutional
immunity to criminal charges, is trying to interrupt his wife's
trial by turning down the judges' request for him to produce
evidence by claiming that it is the president's executive
privilege, according to Tseng.
</P>
<P>
Tseng made the statement one day after President Chen suggested a
revision of the law to prevent any of the country's many
incumbent and former senior officials from being indicted for
funneling funds from their special allowances into their personal
bank accounts without knowing that doing so is illegal.
</P>
<P>
Notable among these officials is KMT Chairman Ma Ying-jeou, who
is under investigation by prosecutors following his DPP critics'
claims that he had lined his own pockets with funds from his
special allowance.
</P>
<P>
Premier Su Tseng-chang, who himself might get into similar
trouble because of his use of special allowances during his terms
as magistrate of Pingtung and Taipei counties, earlier the same
day expressed support for the president's proposal and urged the
opposition in the legislature to think about it seriously.
