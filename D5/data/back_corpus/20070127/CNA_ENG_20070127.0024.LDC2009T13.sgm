VICE PRESIDENT CALLS FOR ATTENTION TO CHILD ABUSE PROBLEM
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  Jan.  27 (CNA) 01/27/07  19:10:23 (By Y.F. Low)

<P>
Vice President Annette Lu urged public office holders Saturday to
show more care for people living in their neighborhood, in light
of the large number of child abuse cases reported in the country.
</P>
<P>
Making the call during a visit to a child and family aid center
in southern Tainan City, Lu said the occurrence of these cases
makes her wonder "where the hearts of Taiwan have gone" when
people in the country are pursuing career success, wealth and
fame.
</P>
<P>
Lu pointed out that a total of 10,094 child abuse cases were
reported in 2006, up from 6,927 cases in 2001.
</P>
<P>
While the number could be under-reported, an average of four
children are forced to commit suicide with their parents or die
from physical abuse every month in Taiwan, Lu said.
</P>
<P>
Noting that 50 percent of the child abusers are the mothers, Lu
said society should pay attention to this problem and not place
too heavy a pressure on women, whom she said might turn to their
weaker children to vent their frustrations.
</P>
<P>
Also, she urged society to show more concern for children from
families at high risk of suicide or violence, which number 25,194
households around the country.
</P>
<P>
Lu stressed that domestic affairs are national affairs and that
there will be no national security if there is no security in the
family.
