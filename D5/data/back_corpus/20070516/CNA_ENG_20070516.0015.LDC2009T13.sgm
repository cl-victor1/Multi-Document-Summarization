Kinmen County Magistrate Lee Chu-feng, at the head of a 68-member
delegation, departed Wednesday for Fujian Province in
southeastern China for a four-day visit.
</P>
<P>
Lee and the delegation made up of other county officials and
representatives of tourist businesses in Kinmen took the ferry
plying the route between the Taiwan- controlled island and
Fujina's Xiamen for the trip which will also take them to
Quanzhou and Fuzhou.
</P>
<P>
In Fuchou, the delegation will attend the ninth Cross-Strait Fair
for Economy and Trade, scheduled to open Friday, to promote
Kinmen tourism and products, county officials said.
</P>
<P>
Prior to his departure, Lee pointed out that since China began
allowing Fujian residents to travel to Kinmen for sightseeing
Dec. 7, 2004, only about 32,000 Chinese tourists have visited the
island, far below the county government's expectations. He
expressed the hope of being able to attract more Chinese citizens
to visit Kinmen for sightseeing during his stay in Fujian.
