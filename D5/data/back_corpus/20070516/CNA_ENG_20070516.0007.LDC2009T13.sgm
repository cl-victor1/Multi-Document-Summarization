A total of 143,000 couples tied the knot in Taiwan in 2006,
marking an increase of 1,529 from the previous year's figure,
according to tallies released by the Directorate General of
Budget, Accounting and Statistics (DGBAS) Wednesday.

<P>
Among them, marriages involving a non-Taiwanese spouse accounted
for 16.8 percent of the total, down 3 percentage points from the
2005 level, a DGBAS official said, adding that the drop reflects
the trend of fading interest in interracial marriage in recent
years.
</P>
<P>
In 2006, one out of every six newlywed couples involved a non-
Taiwanese citizen, compared to one out of every 3.1 couples in
2003 when the interest in intermarriage reached its peak, the
official said.

<P>
According to DGBAS tallies, the number of marriages involving a
Southeast Asian spouse registered the steepest decline, dropping
to 6,950 in 2006 from 11,454 a year ago.
</P>
<P>
Over the past year, 14,406 local citizens married Chinese
spouses, including those from China-controlled Hong Kong and
Macau, and another 2,574 Taiwanese married non-Chinese and non-
Southeast Asian spouses.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, 64,500 married couples divorced in 2006, marking a
year-on-year increase of 1,969. Divorces involving a non-
Taiwanese spouse accounted for 18 percent of the total, up a
marginal 0.4 percentage points from 2005.
