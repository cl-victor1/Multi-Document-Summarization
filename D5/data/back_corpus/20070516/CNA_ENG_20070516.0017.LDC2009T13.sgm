Researchers from National Chiao Tung University (NCTU) introduced
Wednesday a newly-developed organic solar cell which has the
potential to become a new low cost, high performance energy
source.
</P>
<P>
The organic solar cell -- dubbed the Organic P-N Junction -- is a
sandwich structure containing two metal layers mounted on a
plastic substrate, with each layer topped with nano-structured
plastic polymers serving as insulators, according to Chen Fang-
chung, an assistant professor in NCTU's Department of Photonics.
</P>
<P>
The Organic P-N Junction has a power conversion efficiency of 5.2
percent, the highest in the world to date in terms of organic
solar cell power, Chen said.
</P>
<P>
Due to rising oil prices, new energy sources are urgently needed,
Chen said, adding that the Organic P-N Junction is a promising
candidate to become a low cost, high-throughput and flexible
energy source because it is flexible, lightweight and easy to
carry.
</P>
<P>
The Organic P-N Junction, which is slightly larger than a
business card, can be used by mobile phone or notebook PC users
as a portable charger, Chen said, adding that it can also be used
by campers or mountain climbers as a flexible energy source.
</P>
<P>
Chen estimated that the pioneering product could start being mass
produced in three to five years, generating a market of around
US$1 billion initially.
