Premier Su Tseng-Chang said Friday that the relocation of
government agencies involves many factors and decisions will have
to be made after a comprehensive assessment.
</P>
<P>
The premier made the remarks during a question-and-answer session
of the Legislative Yuan after being asked when the Executive Yuan
will deliver on its promise to relocate government agencies to
help balance the development of southern and northern Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Legislator Huang Chao-shun of the main opposition Kuomintang
noted that except for the Fisheries Administration under the
Council of Agriculture, which is scheduled to relocate to
Kaohsiung from Taipei in October, she has not heard any progress
on the relocation of other government agencies.
</P>
<P>
The premier said that the relocation program is still awaiting a
comprehensive assessment that has not yet been concluded.
</P>
<P>
The premier first said during an interpellation session in
February that government agencies or state-owned enterprises can
assess for themselves whether relocating to central or southern
Taiwan would help them to better serve the public or business.
</P>
<P>
Asked whether Chunghwa Telecom will also be relocated to southern
Taiwan, Minister of the Transportation and Communications Tsai
Duei said that it will depend on whether the relocation will have
positive or negative effects on its operations.
</P>
<P>
If moving will provide benefits, then the ministry will support
it, but if a relocation proves not to be feasible, then the
company should explain to the public why it makes more sense for
its headquarters to remain in Taipei.
