flute world" and a "musical genius".

This versatile musician, one of the finest flutists in the world,
is also a noted pianist, and a prolific composer who has written
many music works ranging from chamber music to musicals, and has
attracted a wide audience for his poetic and virtuoso style.

At Saturday's recital, Schocker will perform with another famous

"Two Flutes on the Loose in Fujien" that took Taiwan as his
