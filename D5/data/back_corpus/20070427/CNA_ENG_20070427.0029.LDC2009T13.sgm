Nearly 80 percent of respondents to a recent survey opined that
the proposed raise of the minimum monthly wage to NT$17,000
(US$511) is still insufficient to improve the lives of socially
less privileged workers.

<P>
The main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) publicized Friday the
results of the survey, conducted by a private marketing firm
April 20-23, which aimed to review the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party's (DPP's) labor policies since it took power in
2000.

The poll shows that 80.7 percent of respondents agreed that the
DPP government's efforts to bolster the economic development of
the country over the past seven years did not profit workers by
raising their wages in the least.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, 76.7 percent of those surveyed thought the employment
market had been unstable over the past few years and that the
instability was still increasing.
</P>
<P>
The survey shows that the postgraduates appeared more concerned
about employment situation than did other job-seekers.

<P>
KMT Legislator Lin Teh-fu blamed the DPP for its failure to
improve the life of 8 million blue-collar workers around the
country during its seven-year administration.

A total of 1,077 adults,  aged 20-65 years, answered the
questionnaire properly. The survey enjoys a margin of error of 3
percent.
