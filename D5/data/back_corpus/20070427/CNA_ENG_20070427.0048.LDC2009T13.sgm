Beijing, April 27 (CNA) 04/27/07  23:38:02 (By Chang Ming-kun and

An official with the Beijing 2008 Olympic Games organizing
committee claimed Friday that Games organizers had discussed the
route for the 2008 Olympic torch relay with Taiwan's top Olympic
delegate and reached a consensus on the part concerning Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Jiang Xiaoyu, an executive deputy chairman of the Olympics,
called a news conference in Beijing Friday in which he presented
a copy of the minutes of a meeting in February between the
Beijing Olympics organizers and Chinese Taipei Olympic Committee
Chairman Thomas W. Tsai, during which a four-point consensus was
reached on the torch relay route. The minutes carried Tsai's
signature, Jiang added.
</P>
<P>
Jiang claimed that Tsai signed the minutes to endorse the
consensus on the 2008 Olympic torch relay route, which indicated
China's plan that the Olympic torch would travel from Vietnam's
Ho Chi Minh City to Taipei and then continue on to Hong Kong,
Macau and several other Chinese cities before arriving in the
host city, Beijing.
</P>
<P>
He called it a "breach of agreement" that some people in Taiwan
are now voicing opposition to the Beijing-proposed Olympic torch
relay plan.
</P>
<P>
Premier Su Tseng-chang said earlier Friday that the proposed
route is unacceptable to Taiwan as the route reflects Beijing's
attempt to undermine Taiwan's sovereign status.
</P>
<P>
Thomas Tsai and Yang Jong-her, Minister of Taiwan's National
Council on Physical Fitness and Sports, also said shortly after
Beijing's announcement Thursday that the torch relay route was
unacceptable on the grounds that Taiwan's sovereign status would
be compromised as the Beijing-proposed torch relay route
purposely includes Taipei on the "domestic leg" of the relay.
