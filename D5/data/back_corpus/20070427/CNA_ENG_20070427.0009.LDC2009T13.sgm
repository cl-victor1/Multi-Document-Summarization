ABOUT 25,000 INMATES TO BE SET FREE UNDER AMNESTY PLAN: MOJ
</HEADLINE>

An estimated 25,000 prison inmates serving sentences for petty
crimes or minor transgressions will be set free soon after a
national commutation bill takes effect, Minister of Justice Shih
Mao-lin said Friday.
</P>
<P>
If the proposed presidential amnesty plan comes into effect in
June, Shih added, about 7,500 inmates can be freed from prison in
the near term under the new working guidelines of "simplified
procedures and convenient operations."
</P>
<P>
Noting that the National Commutation Bill of 2007 is being drawn
up in line with the country's new punitive criminal justice
policy that calls for leniency for occasional minor offenders and
harsh penalties for those who have committed felonies, Shih said
about 150 types of crimes will be excluded from the amnesty list.
</P>
<P>
According to Shih, serious offenses inapplicable to the proposed
amnesty will include violent crimes, particularly cases of
kidnapping for ransom and murder, serious cases of carjacking for
ransom and telephone fraud, sexual offenses committed against
children and women, economic crimes, serious violations of
national interests, such as corruption, and serious violations of
the National Security Law.
</P>
<P>
"While mulling the scope of offenses to be eligible  for
commutation of sentences, we just weighed the categories of
crimes and gravity of sentences and didn't touch on any
individual cases. As a result, it's not known at this moment
whether any particular inmate will be excluded from the amnesty
list or not," Shih said.
</P>
<P>
As of the end of March, 8,581 of those who had received sentences
of less than one year were still serving time behind bars. If the
amnesty plan is implemented from June, about 7,500 of the inmates
in this group can be set free within a month, Shih said, adding
that the exact number will require a further check after the
draft commutation bill clears the legislature.
</P>
<P>
Acting on President Chen Shui-bian's directive, the Ministry of
Justice (MOJ) is drafting the commutation statute to implement a
reduction of sentences to mark the 20th anniversary of the
lifting of martial law and the 60th anniversary of the 228
Incident of 1947, a civilian uprising against the then-Kuomintang
government that led to a bloody massacre.
</P>
<P>
Shih said the draft bill will be ready for delivery to the
Executive Yuan for further review next week, after which it will
be sent to the Legislative Yuan for deliberation and approval.
</P>
<P>
Responding to complaints by an advocacy group calling for the
abolishment of capital punishment that the MOJ has ignored
President Chen's previous directive on suspending execution of
death sentences, Shih said phasing out capital punishment is an
established national policy.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Shih added that the MOJ cannot ignore public
sentiments and opinions about such a reform move.
</P>
<P>
"The ministry has been contemplating complementary measures in
preparation for the abolishment of the death penalty in line with
the president's directive. On the other hand, we are also
endeavoring to strike a balance between the policy demand and
public response to the proposed reform," Shih explained.
