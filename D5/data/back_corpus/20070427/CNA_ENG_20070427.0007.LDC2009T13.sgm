BEIJING-PROPOSED OLYMPIC TORCH RELAY PLAN UNACCEPTABLE: PREMIER

Taipei,  April 27 (CNA) 04/27/07  13:00:39 (By Deborah Kuo)

Premier Su Tseng-chang said Friday that Beijing's proposed route
for the 2008 Olympic torch relay is unacceptable to Taiwan,
adding that Taiwan's sovereign status should not be undermined
under any circumstances.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on China's plan that the Olympic torch would travel
from Vietnam's Ho Chi Minh City to Taipei and then continue on to
Hong Kong, Macau and several other Chinese cities before arriving
in the host city, Beijing, Su said at the Legislative Yuan that
Taiwan belongs to the International  Olympic Committee (IOC)  as
an independent sports entity and has taken part in Olympic
competitions on an equal footing for years.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, he said, China has persistently schemed to belittle
Taiwan, trying to downgrade Taiwan to the level of a province of
China, and the torch relay plan -- announced by organizers for
the 2008 Beijing Olympic Games the day before -- is another
example of China's attempt to undermine Taiwan's sovereign
status.
</P>
<P>
On a reporter's  question  on whether  Taiwan will resume
negotiations with China if the Beijing Olympics organizers are
willing to revise the torch relay route, Su said that Taiwan will
be willing to talk to Beijing so long as Taiwan's sovereignty is
not belittled or compromised.
</P>
<P>
Su, meanwhile, declined to speculate on whether Taiwan will
boycott the 2008 Olympic Games altogether because of Beijing's
attempt to downgrade Taiwan through the torch relay plan, saying
that "currently, we are only handling issues of the moment."
</P>
<P>
The Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) rejected Beijing's torch relay
plan soon after the plan was publicized late Thursday. MAC
officials said the plan is unacceptable as it deliberately
undermines Taiwan's sovereign status.
</P>
<P>
Saying that the Chinese officials have played politics with the
torch relay plan, MAC officials insisted that Taiwan cannot
accept the Beijing-proposed torch relay route because it
purposely includes Taipei as part of the "domestic leg" of the
relay.
</P>
<P>
MAC officials added that the government would welcome the arrival
of the Beijing Olympic torch if it were to come to Taipei via a
third country and then head on to another third country.
</P>
<P>
The 2008 Olympic Games are scheduled to be held in Beijing Aug.
8-24 next year.
