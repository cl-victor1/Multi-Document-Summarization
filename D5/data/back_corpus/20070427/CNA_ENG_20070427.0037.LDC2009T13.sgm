PM OPPOSES PROPOSAL THAT FUTURE LEADERS SHOULD BE BORN IN TAIWAN
</HEADLINE>

Taipei, April 27 (CNA) 04/27/07  20:33:09 (By Elisa Kao)

Premier Su Tseng-chang said Friday that he disapproves of a
proposal that future presidential candidates should be born in
Taiwan, as such a move would be targeting specific persons.
</P>
<P>
Su made the remarks at the Legislative Yuan in response to
questions about the proposal by several ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) legislators from opposition Kuomintang
(KMT) Legislator Hsieh Kuo-liang.
</P>
<P>
The DPP lawmakers' proposal was apparently aimed at pushing Ma
Ying-jeou, the former KMT chairman who is widely considered the
KMT's best bet for the 2008 presidential election, from the
competition. Ma was born in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Su, who is also a hopeful in the DPP's presidential primary,
added that he also disapproves of Hsieh's recent proposal that
future Taiwan presidential candidates should pass the general
English proficiency test at the intermediate level.
</P>
<P>
Hsieh claimed that since the president has to represent the
country's interests on many international occasions, a certain
level of English-speaking ability is a must, to which Su
responded that he had never heard of another country requiring
their presidential candidates to have a certain degree of
proficiency in a foreign language, saying that the country's
president is not a tour guide.
</P>
<P>
Su said presidential candidates should have a global vision but
that proficiency in English is not necessary, especially when the
majority of Taiwan's diplomatic allies are not English-speaking
countries.
