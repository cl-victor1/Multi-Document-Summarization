NO FORMAL AGREEMENT ON TORCH RELAY: CTOC CHAIR
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taipei,  April 27 (CNA) 04/27/07  23:40:48 (By Sofia Wu)

China's deliberate moves to dwarf Taiwan to the level of a
province under its jurisdiction are the main reasons behind
Taiwan's refusal to be included in the Olympic torch relay route
for the 2008 Beijing Olympic Games, Chinese Taipei Olympic
Committee (CTOC) Chairman Thomas W. Tsai said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Tsai made the remarks after an official of the Beijing 2008
Olympic Games organizing committee claimed earlier in the day
that Taiwan's snub of Beijing's offer for inclusion in the
Olympic torch relay is a "breach of agreement."
</P>
<P>
Jiang Xiaoyu, an executive deputy chairman of the Olympics,
called a news conference in Beijing Friday in which he presented
a copy of the minutes of a meeting in February between Tsai and
the Beijing Olympics organizers, during which a four-point
consensus was reached on the torch relay route. The minutes
carried Tsai's signature, Jiang added.
</P>
<P>
Jiang claimed that Tsai signed the minutes to endorse the
consensus on the 2008 Olympic torch relay route, which indicated
China's plan that the Olympic torch would travel from Vietnam's
Ho Chi Minh City to Taipei and then continue on to Hong Kong,
Macau and several other Chinese cities before arriving in the
host city, Beijing.
</P>
<P>
He called it a "breach of agreement" that some people in Taiwan
are now voicing opposition to the Beijing-proposed Olympic torch
relay plan.
</P>
<P>
In response, Tsai said in Taipei that conference minutes were not
a formal agreement. "We have never been formally committed to
accepting whatever Beijing's proposal about Taiwan's role or
place in the torch relay," he said.
</P>
<P>
While both sides pledged in the minutes that Taiwan should be
called "Chinese Taipei" as its official designation in the IOC,
Tsai said Beijing officials and Chinese journalists and media
executives have typically  referred to Taiwan as "Taipei,  China"
--  a characterization they feel makes it sound as if Taiwan were
part of China.
</P>
<P>
Without elaboration, Tsai further said that over the past month,
Beijing's attempts to describe Taiwan as a province under its
jurisdiction  have even become ever more evident in bilateral
engagements.
</P>
<P>
"During the period, we have on many occasions expressed our
stance and bottom line to Beijing. Without Beijing's positive
response to our request and for the sake of safeguarding our
sovereign status and national dignity, we sent a letter to
Beijing April 20 expressing our decision to reject the Beijing-
proposed Ho Chi Minh City-Taipei-Hong Kong relay route," Tsai
said.
</P>
<P>
In an April 24 response to Tsai, the Beijing Olympic Committee
failed to promise to improve its attitude toward Taiwan and make
an adjustment to the relay route. As a result, Tsai said, Taiwan
felt compelled to turn down Beijing's route arrangement.
</P>
<P>
"It's now up to Beijing to decide whether to change the route to
have the torch arrive in Taiwan via a third country and leave via
another third country," he added.
</P>
<P>
Premier Su Tseng-chang said earlier in the day that the proposed
route is unacceptable to Taiwan as the route reflects Beijing's
attempt to undermine Taiwan's sovereign status.
</P>
<P>
As a matter of fact, Chinese officials have never hestitated to
claim in public that Taipei, Hong Kong and Macau are "overseas
Chinese cities" and that their inclusion in the torch relay
should not be regarded as "international route."
