Taipei's top-end residential properties are the sixth most
expensive among those of 16 major cities around the world,
according to a survey released Thursday by a local real estate
brokerage company.
</P>
<P>
The survey conducted by Century 21 Real Estate shows that top-end
housing prices in Taipei average more than NT$600,000 (US$18,127)
per ping (3.3 square meters) , ranking behind London's NT$3.6
million, Paris's NT$1.31 million, Seoul's 1.25 million, Sydney's
NT$830,000 and Vancouver's NT$660,000.
</P>
<P>
Ranking from seventh to 16th on the list are: Athens' NT$560,000,
New York's NT$550,000, Tokyo's NT$440,000, Shanghai's NT$420,000,
Singapore's  NT$320,000, Istanbul's  NT$200,000,  Johannesburg's
NT$185,000, Moscow's NT$150,000, Bogota's NT$137,000 and Mexico
City's NT$86,000.
</P>
<P>
The survey found that in cities with a high population density,
such as Taipei, Paris and Singapore, top-end housing tends to be
smaller in size and located closer to the downtown area, with the
commuting time ranging between 10 minutes and 20 minutes.
