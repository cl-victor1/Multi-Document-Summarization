Taipei,  April 27 (CNA) 04/27/07  20:13:46 (By Lilian Wu)

Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) Chairman Chen Ming-tong dismissed
reports Friday that after his meeting with President Chen Shui-
bian, the fate of the Olympic torch passing through Taipei was
sealed.
</P>
<P>
He was responding to reports by the China Times, a local
newspaper, that Taipei's rejection of the torch relay was decided
after a meeting between the MAC chief and the president in mid-
April.
</P>
<P>
According to the reports, during that meeting President Chen was
indignant about the possible arrangement of the torch either
entering or leaving Taiwan from China via a third country, which
Chen reportedly said would give Beijing a boost in its propaganda
that Taiwan is a province of China and would be detrimental to
the ruling Democratic Progressive Party, particularly in light of
the 2008 presidential election.
</P>
<P>
Chen Ming-tong said the reports were wrong, pointing out that
since his swearing-in as chairman of the nation's top China
policy planning agency April 12, he had not even met the
president.
</P>
<P>
According to the Olympic torch relay route unveiled the previous
day, the torch would enter Taipei from Vietnam's Ho Chi Minh city
and proceed to Hong Kong and Macau. Taiwan rejected this
arrangement, insisting that the torch should both enter and leave
Taiwan via third countries.
