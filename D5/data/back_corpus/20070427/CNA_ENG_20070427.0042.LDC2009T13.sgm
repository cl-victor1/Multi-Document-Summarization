Taiwan's First Financial Holding Co. (FFHC) and Aviva, the
largest insurance services provider in the U.K., will jointly set
up a new insurance company in Taiwan in the second half of this
year, an FFHC spokesman said Friday.

The currently operating Taiwanese chapter of Aviva -- the world's
fifth-largest insurance group -- will have its operating licence
recalled after the new insurance company is set up with a
starting capital of NT$5 billion (US$150.32 million), the
spokesman said.

He forecast that the new joint venture's business will grow at a
rate of 10-20 percent annually and that the company will reach
the break-even point in its fourth year of operations.

By 2011, the spokesman said, the joint venture will post an
estimated profit of NT$130 million, with a total asset of NT$75
billion.
