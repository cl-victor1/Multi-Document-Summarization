<P>
Premier Su Tseng-chang said Friday that he wished to share his
joy when he announced  that Taiwan will re-establish diplomatic
relations with St. Lucia.
</P>
<P>
The premier, while meeting a supporter group in Taoyuan, northern
Taiwan, said Wednesday night that St. Lucia has become Taiwan's
25th diplomatic ally after St. Lucia's Minister of Foreign
Affairs announced the news. He described the resumption of
diplomatic ties with St. Lucia as one of the most encouraging
news events since he assumed the premiership early last year.
</P>
<P>
Su made the remarks during an interpellation session at the
Legislative Yuan when asked about questions Vice President
Annette Lu raised concerning Su's appropriateness of his
announcement of the resumption of diplomatic ties, which is
properly the domain of President Chen Shui-bian. Lu also said
that Su's act aimed at currying favor with the voters.
</P>
<P>
Both Su and Lu are bidding to become the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party's (DPP's) presidential candidate in the 2008
election.
</P>
<P>
The premier denied that his announcement was a "slip of tongue"
brought about by pressure prior to the presidential primary of
the DPP, saying that he wanted to "share the good news with the
public."
</P>
<P>
The premier said that he received the approval of the
Presidential Office prior to the announcement.
</P>
<P>
He said the re-establishment of diplomatic ties with St. Lucia
has been conducted in an open way, and is by no means a product
of "secret diplomacy."
</P>
<P>
Su noted that St. Lucia's Foreign Minister Rufus Bousquet said
Wednesday morning that the nation intends to establish diplomatic
ties with Taiwan, although it did not rule out maintaining
relations with China.
</P>
<P>
Foreign media also reported the news later that day, meaning that
it was by no means a secret, he added.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that diplomatic policy is with the purview of the
president and that the resumption of diplomatic relations with
St. Lucia has been the result of efforts by the Ministry of
Foreign Affairs.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Affairs Minister James Huang expressed the hope Thursday
that the two nations can sign a communique marking the official
re-establishment of ties as soon as possible and said his
ministry is working to complete all the relevant follow-up
procedures.
</P>
<P>
The east Caribbean nation first established diplomatic ties with
Taiwan in 1984, but then switched diplomatic recognition to China
in 1997.
