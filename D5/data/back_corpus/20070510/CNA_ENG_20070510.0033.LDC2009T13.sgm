<P>
Minister of Finance Ho Chih-chin said Thursday that it is not
appropriate to scrap the inheritance tax or gift tax.
</P>
<P>
Ho made the remarks at the Finance Committee of the Legislative
Yuan when it was reviewing a draft amendment to the inheritance
and gift tax act proposed by several legislators of the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) to cut the inheritance and
gift tax rate and streamline the current multi-tier tax system.
</P>
<P>
Ho said that 80 percent of inheritance tax will go to local
governments and that if there are no other alternative sources of
revenues, it will be a blow to the finances of local governments.
</P>
<P>
According to Ministry of Finance statistics, between 30 percent
and 40 percent of those filing for inheritance tax use the
highest-tier tax rate at 50 percent, showing that the inheritance
tax is still significant in terms of advancing the equitable
distribution of wealth.
</P>
<P>
DPP Legislator Cheng Yun-peng asked Ho to clearly say if he
supports adjusting tax rates downward and streamlining the
current multiple-tier rate system.
</P>
<P>
Ho said the ministry will study streamlining the current
multiple-tier tax system in three months and whether to adjust
the tax rate downwards by the end of December.
</P>
<P>
Ho said that to cut the current 10-tier tax system to around
five-tiers or six- tiers and to raise the amount of the tax-
exempt portion will be the direction of the ministry.
</P>
<P>
The highest income tax rate currently stands at 40 percent.
