TAIWAN RESEARCHER WINS JAPAN'S TOP ECOLOGY AWARD

An Academia Sinica researcher was recently selected as one of the
two winners of Japan's prestigious ecology award this year for
his extraordinary research into crustaceans and their habitats,
as well as his contributions to marine ecological protection, the
National Science Council (NSC) reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Jeng Ming-shiou, a veteran research fellow with Academia
Sinica's Research Center for Biodiversity, is scheduled to travel
to Japan's Shiga Prefecture in central Honshu to receive the Lake
Biwa Ecology Award July 1, NSC officials said.
</P>
<P>
Jeng will be the second Taiwanese to receive the prestigious
award, named after Lake Biwa because Biwa is the largest
freshwater lake in Japan and a showcase for Japan's biological
and ecological diversity.
</P>
<P>
Prof. Chen Chen-tung of National Sun Yat-sen University received
the Lake Biwa Ecology Award in 1998 for his outstanding research
in lake ecology.
</P>
<P>
Jeng, who has studied ocean crustaceans for the past 30 years,
was awarded for his research into xenograpsus testudinatus, a
species of crab discovered in 2000 that is only found in waters
near Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
One of Jeng's papers on the crab, also known as the hydrothermal
vent crab, was carried in the internationally acclaimed
periodical Nature in 2004, putting Taiwan on the global map of
crustacean research, NSC officials said.
</P>
<P>
Jeng's paper explains how vast populations of hydrothermal vent
crabs feed in an extreme, toxic habitat.
</P>
<P>
Hydrothermal vent crabs live in enormously high densities (an
average  364 crabs per square metre)  around the sulphur-rich
hydrothermal vents found in shallow waters off Kueishan Isle off
the coast of Taiwan's northeastern county of Yilan.
</P>
<P>
The acidic environment is low in nutrients and the crabs survive
by swarming out of their crevices at slack water to feed on the
vast numbers of zooplankton killed by the sulfurous plumes, which
rain down on the crabs like marine snow.
</P>
<P>
The paper also looks at how the crabs have adapted to life
unscathed in an environment where human divers have to cover up
or suffer acid burns to their skin.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with CNA Thursday, Jeng disclosed that he has
also studied gun shrimps, or band shrimps, for nearly 30 years
and has compiled research data on 120 species of the shrimp.
</P>
<P>
Jeng, who has strived in recent years to promote the protection
of ocean resources, said Taiwan is blessed with an environment
surrounded by oceans.
</P>
<P>
However, he added that the Taiwanese should do more to protect
their environment, saying that once the environment is polluted
or damaged, any further remedial work will be too late.
</P>
<P>
Jeng  is one  of the trailblazers  pushing  for  Taiwan's
establishment of ocean protection zones as a means of securing
sustainable growth for the country.
