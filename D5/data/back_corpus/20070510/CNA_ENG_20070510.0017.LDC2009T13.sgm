TAIWAN MAINTAINING SMOOTH COMMUNICATION WITH U.S.: MOFA
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  May  10  (CNA) 05/10/07  16:19:06 (By Jorge Liu and Y.F.
Low)
</P>
<P>
The government is maintaining smooth communication with the
United States despite failing to send a delegation to Washington
to promote Taiwan's bid to become a full member of the World
Health Organization (WHO), a Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA)
official said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
MOFA spokesman Wang Chien-yeh said the United States remains
supportive of Taiwan's bid to participate in WHO activities,
noting that U.S. Deputy Secretary of State John Negroponte has
recently reaffirmed U.S. support for Taiwan's participation in
the World Heath Assembly (WHA) as an observer.
</P>
<P>
While admitting that the bid for WHO membership is a "very great
challenge" to Taiwan, Wang said the country needs to try various
approaches to push for WHO participation and that the MOFA has a
responsibility to cooperate with other authorities to work toward
the goal.
</P>
<P>
Wang made the remarks in the wake of a media report that the U.S.
government has refused to receive a mission led by Joanne J.L.
Chang, deputy secretary-general of the National Security Council,
who was sent by the government to lobby for U.S. support for the
country's effort to apply for WHO membership under the name of
"Taiwan."
</P>
<P>
According to the report, the U.S. government rejected the mission
on the grounds that there are already normalized channels of
communication between the two sides and therefore no need for
discussions via other channels.
</P>
<P>
The report said the development shows that the United States does
not support Taiwan's application for WHO membership under the
name of "Taiwan."
</P>
<P>
In Washington, D.C., Republic of China Representative to the
United States Joseph Wu confirmed that the U.S. government
clearly indicated to Taipei that it will not support the bid even
before the application was filed.
</P>
<P>
Before the government made the move, Minister of Foreign Affairs
James Huang had consulted with officials at the American
Institute in Taiwan over the issue, Wu said.
</P>
<P>
Wu said that despite the failure to win U.S. support, the
government decided to go ahead with the plan as Taiwan needs to
survive in the international community and must not give up its
efforts to obtain WHO membership just because some countries are
opposed to it.
</P>
<P>
Although the United States does not support WHO membership for
Taiwan, it is still in favor of Taiwan's participation in the WHA
as an observer and its meaningful participation in WHO
activities, such as the Global Outbreak Alert and Response
Network and technical-level meetings of the International Health
Regulations, according to Wu.
</P>
<P>
Wu said he was still trying to communicate with Washington over
the issue of Taiwan's WHO membership. However, he also admitted
that it will be very difficult to make the United States change
its position.
