Taipei,  May 9 (CNA) 05/10/07  10:59:57 (By Han Nai-kuo)

<P>
The Cabinet has no right to nullify the law governing the
operations of the Chiang Kai-shek Memorial Hall in Taipei, a
lawmaker of the opposition People First Party (PFP) said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Chang Hsien-yao, director of the PFP's Policy Research Center,
told a press conference that the Cabinet has violated the
nation's constitution by using an executive order to scrap the
Provisions Governing the Organization of the CKS Memorial Hall
Administration Office -- a law passed by the legislature in 1975
and promulgated a year later.
</P>
<P>
Chang stressed  that according  the Constitution, only the
legislature has the right to pass, amend or invalidate a law, and
that the Cabinet should not knowingly encroach on the
legislature's rights.
</P>
<P>
The PFP legislator warned that the PFP will file a petition to
the Control Yuan -- the nation's highest watchdog body -- and
charge related Cabinet officials with dereliction of duty.
</P>
<P>
Chang made the remarks after the Cabinet made clear its intention
to implement regulations submitted by the Ministry of Education
to change CKS Memorial Hall into a "Taiwan Democracy Memorial
Hall."
</P>
<P>
A Cabinet spokesman has claimed that the Democratic Progressive
Party government did not need the legislature's approval to
change the name of the memorial, and that the regulations
governing the organization of the "Taiwan Democracy Memorial
Hall" -- adopted in April -- will become effective upon its
promulgation by the Ministry of Education.
