A consumers' group warned the public Thursday to guard against
tricks widely used by local businessmen in selling what they
called health foods as the Mother Day is drawing near when many
caring children will buy health foods for their beloved mothers.
</P>
<P>
Cheng Jen-hung, chairman of the Consumers' Foundation, Chinese
Taipei said at a news conference that among the 40-odds Chinese
Web sites offering health foods on Yahoo, Goggle and MSN, only
about 10 percent of them provided for the number of their
licenses issued by health authorities which permit them to sell
the health foods.
</P>
<P>
The others provide information about their products without
bothering to unveil their licenses and therefore are suspicious,
said Cheng.
</P>
<P>
As health foods are regulated by the health authorities, Cheng
said, many businessmen branded their product as dietary
complements or nutritious foods on the Web sites to get around
the rules.
</P>
<P>
He also cautioned the consumers not to believe too readily the
businessmen's boast about the effects of their products which are
often exaggerated, such as lowering people's steroid levels and
helping them regain strength after burning midnight oil.
</P>
<P>
Still another trick often employed by the businessmen is toasting
about  awards or certifications  won their products  such as
accreditation from U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or
insurance policy taken out by them for their products to convince
potential buyers of the safety of their products.
</P>
<P>
In case like these, Cheng said the businessmen should provide
detail information on the Web sites so the consumers could verify
them if they like.
