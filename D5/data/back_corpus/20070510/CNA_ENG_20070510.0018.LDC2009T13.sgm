COA HOPES TO INCREASE AGRICULTURAL EXPORTS BY 20%

Taipei, May 10 (CNA) 05/10/07  16:40:09 (By Lilian Wu)

<P>
The Council of Agriculture (COA) said Thursday that it hopes to
increase agricultural exports by 20 percent within three years.
</P>
<P>
COA Chairman Su Jia-chyuan made the remarks during a report to a
legislative committee on the nation's agricultural exports as
well as ways to expand exports.
</P>
<P>
Su noted that Taiwan's agricultural exports in 1996 hit US$5.48
billion, but slipped due to a foot-and-mouth disease outbreak in
1997 that resulted in the decimation of Taiwan's pigs.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan's entry into the World Trade Organization in 2002, as well
as the slashing of 162 tuna-fishing vessels in 2006 also played a
role, Su said. The International Commission for the Conservation
of Atlantic Tuna (ICCAT) cut Taiwan's total allowable bigeye tuna
fishing quota from 14,900 tons in 2005 to a mere 4,600 tons in
2006 because of overfishing by Taiwan fishing vessels.
</P>
<P>
He said the COA launched a project in 2004 to step up agriculture
produce promotion globally. Agricultural exports that year were
US$3.55 billion, compared with US$3.58 billion in 2005 and
US$3.29 billion in 2006.
</P>
<P>
Because of the project, Taiwan's agricultural products were able
to see some breakthrough, noting that Taiwan's butterfly orchid
is the only one in the world that can be exported to the United
States in moss, while Taiwanese papayas can also be exported to
Japan and its rice, after a hiatus of 33 years, also returned to
the Japanese market.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan also exports mangoes to New Zealand, Chile and Australia.
</P>
<P>
In addition, exports of Taiwanese tilapia to the European Union
resumed. Taiwanese poultry also began to be exported to Japan
after effectively curbing the spread of the low pathogenic avian
influenza.
</P>
<P>
Su said Taiwan's agricultural development is constrained by
limited land and difficulty in controlling the total production,
as well as the influx of foreign agricultural products after
Taiwan's entrance into the WTO, all of which have led to steeper
competition for Taiwanese farm products.
