Lin Chin-cheng, a Taiwanese graduate student at Royal Antwerp
Conservatory in Belgium, has won the championship in the fourth
European Solo Competition for Brass and Percussion held in
England recently with his outstanding marimba performance.
</P>
<P>
Lin, who has been studying marimba performance and musical
composition at the noted Belgian music school since 2003, was
awarded the coveted title known as the European soloist champion
2007 after beating other contenders in the contest held in the
British city of Birmingham from April 28 through May 6.
</P>
<P>
Lin said the victory came as a big surprise to him because he was
the only student contestant in the competition. A total of 63
musicians from 11 countries took part in the contest sponsored by
the European Brass Band Association. All the other contestants
were professional brass or percussion musicians.
</P>
<P>
"It's a great honor for me. I only dreamed of entering the semi-
final competition," a jubilant Lin said.
</P>
<P>
The title didn't come easy as the jury had to select the best
from among contestants who played a total of 12 different brass
and percussion instruments.
</P>
<P>
Ludwig Albert, a renowned marimba soloist who has been Lin's
mentor at the Antwerp conservatory since 2003, said he is proud
of Lin's performance in the competition. Praising Lin as a
talented virtuoso, Albert said he believes that his student has a
promising future in the music world.
</P>
<P>
In a percussion musical contest held in Belgium in 2004, Lin won
third place and the best talent award.
</P>
<P>
Lin performed a marimba concerto composed by a Brazilian composer
in the just- concluded European competition. In addition to
winning the "European soloist champion 2007" trophy, he was also
awarded 2,500 euro (US$3,387) in prize money.

<P>
Lin has been invited to perform in an international percussion
music festival to be held in Argentina June 24.
