As the country is engrossed in doubling the number of foreign
tourist arrivals, lawmakers urged the government Thursday to take
advantage of Taiwan's high-end farm products to promote tourism.
</P>
<P>
During a legislative committee meeting, various lawmakers issued
the call and asked Council of Agriculture (COA)  Chairman Su Jia-
chyuan to step up exports promotion of locally grown flowers and
tea to help sell Taiwan tourism to the international community.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan farmers are strong in growing fine-quality flowers and tea
and the government should consider combining its tourism efforts
with local speciality goods by featuring the two farm products,
with the China and Hong Kong markets especially worthy of
exploration, they said.
</P>
<P>
Saying that Taiwan must seek to highlight its advantages to sell
itself to foreigners, they said that tour packages featuring good
tea and colorful flowers would provide a new experience for
tourists visiting Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
To help increase flowers and tea exports to China, the government
must allocate greater sales resources to serve that end, they
suggested.
</P>
<P>
Although Japan has long been the No. 1 foreign market for
Taiwan's farm exports, absorbing 28 percent of the total, the
lawmakers said that China and Hong Kong are rapidly emerging as a
key outlet, accounting for 27 percent of Taiwan's outbound farm
products. However, promotion efforts devoted to the greater China
area are scarce, they noted.
</P>
<P>
According to Su,  Japan is a prime importer of Taiwanese
agricultural goods and its stringent quality and quarantine
controls on foreign shipments  have greatly helped Taiwan sharpen
its competitiveness.
</P>
<P>
Although he also admitted that the greater China area is
increasingly playing a bigger role, Su voiced concern that
rampant commercial piracy in China poses a great threat to Taiwan
farmers' business interests.
