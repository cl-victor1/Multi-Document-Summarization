A Taiwanese yachtsman has sailed a boat he purchased in the
United States to eastern Taiwan in a four-month, 7,400-km voyage,
a coast guard official said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Kao Chi-liang, the owner of the boat and a former journalist,
asked for permission three days ago to moor at a port in the
eastern county of Taitung due to bad weather, the official noted.

Kao told the official that he had planned to have the boat
shipped to Taiwan. However, it was very troublesome and the cost
was high, so he decided to sail it back himself.
