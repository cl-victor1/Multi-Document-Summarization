President Chen Shui-bian said Wednesday that the opposition
Kuomintang (KMT) should apologize to the nation for its 38 years
of martial law rule.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a memorial ceremony for the 60th anniversary of the
228 Incident at Taipei's 228 Memorial Park, Chen said the
incident was not a simple historical event but inseparable from
the ensuing nearly four decades of martial law.
</P>
<P>
All the Taiwanese people suppressed under the authoritarian
regime were 228 Incident victims,he said.
</P>
<P>
On May 20, 1949, then-Taiwan Provincial Garrison Commander Chen
Cheng declared martial law on Taiwan at a time when the KMT had
lost a bloody civil war to the communists in China. The martial
law era lasted until July 15, 1987, when the late President
Chiang Ching-kuo ended it.
