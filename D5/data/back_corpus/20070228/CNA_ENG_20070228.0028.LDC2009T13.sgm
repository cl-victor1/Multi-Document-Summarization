The organizer of a round-the-island torch relay publicized
Wednesday a draft "Taiwan Constitution" in Kaohsiung, southern
Taiwan as part of efforts to promote formal Taiwan independence.
</P>
<P>
The Taipei-based 908 Taiwan Republic Campaign held a rally at the
Kaohsiung railway station to receive the torch, which was lit
earlier at the Eluanpi lighthouse on Taiwan's southernmost tip to
mark the 60th anniversary of the 228 Incident.
</P>
<P>
At the gathering, campaign convener Wang Hsien-chi explained that
the movement was formed to prepare for the establishment of an
independent Taiwanese republic.
</P>
<P>
The organization plans to gather supporters in front of the
Presidential Office Sept. 8 when it will formally publicize its
proposed constitution, national flag and national anthem for the
republic, Wang said, claiming that by then Taiwanese people will
be able to announce to the world that Taiwan is independent.
</P>
<P>
The 228 torch, being relayed between runners at 6,000 locations
around the island, is scheduled to arrive in Taipei, northern
Taiwan, March 4.
