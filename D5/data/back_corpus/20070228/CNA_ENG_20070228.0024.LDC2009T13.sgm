MAC REBUTS CHINA'S INTERPRETATION OF 228 INCIDENT
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taipei, Feb. 28 (CNA) 02/28/07  19:11:20 (By Y.C. Jou)
</P>
<P>
The Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) rebutted Wednesday China's
interpretation of the 228 Incident, describing it as mere
distortion serving only to further disaffect the Taiwanese people
from the Beijing communists.
</P>
<P>
"Having experienced more than 20 years of deepening democracy,
the Taiwanese people have gradually established their
identification with the nation, their history, culture and
values. China and international society should respect that
identification, " the MAC said in a news release.
</P>
<P>
The news release was in response to a statement from a spokesman
for China's State Council Taiwan Affairs Office who said earlier
in the day that Beijing's stance is that the "228 Uprising was a
patriotic movement pursuing democracy and autonomy against the
Kuomintang regime's autocratic rule and a part of the Chinese
people's struggle for liberation."
</P>
<P>
The MAC release said the tragedy that took place 60 years ago was
a brutal persecution conducted by the government against innocent
civilians and members of Taiwan's elite that has left a scar deep
on the nation's memory. However, it said, through commemoration
of the past, the Taiwanese people have become more able to
understand the truth.
</P>
<P>
It said that while Taiwanese people are broadminded enough to
forgive, realization of and reflection on the past are the most
important procedures to ensure that such a tragedy never happens
again and that Taiwan's democracy keeps advancing and
consolidating.
</P>
<P>
"Eighteen years ago in Beijing there was another massacre
conducted by the military against innocent students, and Chinese
people will have the same feeling as the 23 million Taiwanese
people now have when they probe into the truth in the future, "
the news release continued.
</P>
<P>
"Like the Taiwanese government, the Chinese government has to
face the same international human rights criteria, " it said,
adding that "fundamental human rights in China will only be
manifested when the Chinese government admits its past guilt."
</P>
<P>
The MAC said China's passage of its so-called Anti-secession Law
in 2005, its attempts to unilaterally impose its politics on
Taiwan and change the cross- strait status quo using non-peaceful
means, and its denial of the fact that two sides of the strait
are under different governments are the biggest barriers
preventing better development in cross-strait relations.
