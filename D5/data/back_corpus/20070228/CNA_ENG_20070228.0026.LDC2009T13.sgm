Sales of the first postage stamp bearing the word "Taiwan" were
brisk Wednesday at post offices in Taipei City, including a
temporary one at the new National 228 Memorial Museum.
</P>
<P>
Fifty-one post offices were open around Taiwan on 228 Memorial
Day -- a national holiday -- to manage sales of the first
"Taiwan" postage stamp featuring the National 228 Memorial Museum
and carrying the mark of Taiwan Post Co., a state- owned company
previously known as Chunghwa Post Co.
</P>
<P>
The change of name to Taiwan Post from Chunghwa Post is part of
the government's drive to change the names of state-run
businesses to get rid of Chinese references in their titles and
add the word "Taiwan" to make them more identifiable with their
country of origin and avoid confusion with similarly named
Chinese organizations.
</P>
<P>
The historic stamp issuance was also made in accordance with the
opening of the National 228 Memorial Museum, located in the
former United States Information Service Building on Nanhai Road
in Taipei.
</P>
<P>
Stamp collectors waited in long queues in front of the North Gate
and Nanhai post offices in Taipei for the post offices to open.
It was estimated that over 1,000 people lined up at the North
Gate post office to purchase the first "Taiwan" stamp.
