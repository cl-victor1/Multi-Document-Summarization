Thanks to a brisk Chinese economy and anticipated direct charter
flights across the Taiwan Strait, growth in Taiwan's executive
air travel market is in sight, Civil Aeronautics Administration
(CAA) officials forecast Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The officials  predicted  promising prospects  for Taiwan's
executive air travel market in view of the fast expansion in Hong
Kong and Macau business travel to and from China. The CAA has
proposed exploring the market, they added.
</P>
<P>
The CAA conducted an opinion survey of top 500 local enterprises
last year to explore the commercial aviation market potential. A
total of 88 valid replies were collected.
</P>
<P>
Citing the results of the survey, the officials said that two of
them expressed full willingness to use special executive jets for
their business travel as long as the government gives a green
light, while 49 companies said that they would "conditionally"
consider the possibility.
</P>
<P>
Costs were the main consideration when 43 of the 49 companies
willing to use special executive jets weighed the issue, the
officials said. Twenty six enterprises said that they would think
about the issue only when direct cross- strait air travel has
been put in place, while 25 said that they would do so when
regular commercial flights are not effective enough to cope with
demand.
</P>
<P>
As most  Taiwan  corporations  are small-  or medium-sized
businesses, only four of the local companies surveyed said that
they would consider purchasing a private airplane, according to
the poll results.
</P>
<P>
For international routes, Taipei Songshan Airport was most-often
cited by respondents as the best hub for executive jets, followed
by Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport in northern Taoyuan
County and Kaohsiung International Airport in southern Taiwan.
Songshan Airport led its counterparts in Kaohsiung, Taoyuan,
Taichung and Tainan in terms of domestic air travel demand.
</P>
<P>
The CAA hopes to permit Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport and
Kaohsiung International Airport to serve special executive jets
and private planes plying international routes in its planned
first-phase opening.
</P>
<P>
In the second phase, Songshan Airport and other airports in
Hualien, Taichung, Kinmen and Makung that operate international
charters will be authorized to serve special executive and
private planes on international routes, as well as all other
civilian airports, the officials added.
