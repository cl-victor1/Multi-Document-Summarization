President Chen Shui-bian presided over the opening of the
National 228 Memorial Museum Wednesday and said in his opening
address  that the museum symbolizes the government's
determination to heed the lessons of history and safeguard
democracy.
</P>
<P>
"I hope the museum will eventually become a first-class platform
for human rights exchanges in the world," Chen said.
</P>
<P>
Chen said the turbulent history of the bloody revolt should not
be forgotten, distorted or smeared. Now that the National 228
Memorial Museum has been established, the government will
accelerate efforts to restore historical truth and facts, he
added.
</P>
<P>
He expressed hope that the museum will not only become a top
human rights museum -- which will help champion the causes of
peace, freedom, democracy and human rights -- but that it will
also contribute to turning the tragic term of the "228 Incident"
into a pronoun that stands for hope,  forgiveness, reconciliation
and consolidation.
</P>
<P>
Vice President Annette Lu, who also delivered an address at the
opening ceremony, pointed out that it has been 60 years since the
incident and that relevant developments in finding out the truth
and facts surrounding the incident have continued, underlining
the government's resolve to give justice to all of the victims of
the brutality, and to their families.
</P>
<P>
Also addressing the ceremony, Premier Su Tseng-chang said the
government will continue to strive to collect information and
historical archives on the 228 Incident from home and abroad to
better facilitate related studies.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Su said, the Executive Yuan has decided to allocate a
budget of NT$1.5 billion over a period of five years to allow the
National 228 Memorial Museum to remain in operation.
</P>
<P>
After the ceremony, the officials joined families of the 228
victims to observe a minute of silence to pay homage to the dead.
</P>
<P>
A "Division and Rebirth" exhibition commemorating the 60th
anniversary of the incident is being staged at the museum, which
is remodeled from the building in which the former U.S. News and
Culture Center was located.
