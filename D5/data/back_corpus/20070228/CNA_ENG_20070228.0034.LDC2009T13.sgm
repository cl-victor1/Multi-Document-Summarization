Taipei,  Feb.  28 (CNA) 02/28/07  21:27:09 (By Y.C. Jou)

President Chen Shui-bian said Wednesday that the commemoration
for the 60th anniversary of the 228 Incident marked a beginning
of a new era in which emphasis will be placed on investigating
the legal responsibility of every perpetrator of abuses in the
country's authoritative past.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the central government's 228 Incident remembrance
ceremony held at the 228 Memorial Park, Chen said he never
described the incident as an ethnic conflict because many
mainlanders were also victimized.
</P>
<P>
Chen said the incident was not a simple historical event but that
it was inseparable from the ensuing four decades of martial law.
</P>
<P>
All the Taiwanese people suppressed under the authoritarian
regime were 228 Incident victims, he said,in this respect most of
Taiwanese people are together on the side of the victims and
their families, willing to strive for justice.
</P>
<P>
He said the government will investigate every perpetrator's legal
responsibilities so as to clarify the historical truth and
achieve justice, adding that such investigations will not be
applied to the 228 Incident alone, but also all crimes against
human rights committed during the martial law era.
</P>
<P>
Citing former President Lee Teng-hui's apology while Kuomintang
(KMT) Chairman for the 228 Incident, Chen said the KMT should
also apologize for its 38 years of martial law rule if the party
is sincere in its reflections on history and its belief in the
universal value of democracy and human rights.
</P>
<P>
The KMT should also return to the country, and the people, all
the property it stole through the mechanisms of the party-state
regime, Chen said.
</P>
<P>
It is unacceptable that some politician on the one hand
apologizes for the 228 Incident, while on the other speeding up
the sale and disposal of ill-gotten party assets,he said.
</P>
<P>
He said the government opposes the actions of the ruling bloc
during the authoritative era. The historical fact that members of
the bloc were mostly of Waishengrens, people who fled to Taiwan
from China during and after the China Civil War and their
decedents, does not mean the government is singling out that
specific ethnic group.
</P>
<P>
It is sheer distortion to describe the pursuit for democracy and
freedom as the suppression of a particular ethnic group, he said.
