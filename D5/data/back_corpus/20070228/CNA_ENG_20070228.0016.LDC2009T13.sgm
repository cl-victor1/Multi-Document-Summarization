The total production value of Taiwan's solar cell industry is
estimated to top NT$20 billion-NT$25 billion (US$ 605 million-
US$757 million) by 2010, a four- fold expansion compared with the
present value, academic sources said Wednesday.

<P>
Officials at the Hsinchu-based Industrial Technology Research
Institute  (ITRI) said  that  thanks  to  a  complete upstream-
to-downstream production capacity, the solar cell industry has a
good opportunity to engage in fast expansion along with the
surging global demand for clean, renewable energy.
</P>
<P>
The current production value of solar cells in Taiwan is about
NT$5.6 billion, representing 6 percent of the global market.
</P>
<P>
Officials said that with the help of government funding --
including NT$16.5 billion in investment over the next five years,
a favorable purchase price for solar energy at NT$10 per
kilowatt- hour, and a 50 percent subsidy for solar energy
equipment, Taiwan's total production capacity will top 280
megawatts by 2010, with an estimated market value of NT$20
billion-NT$25 billion.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan's global market share will have expanded to 15 percent-20
percent by that time, they predicted.
