A special concert was held at the Chungshan Soccer Stadium  in
Taipei Wednesday to commemorate  the 60th anniversary of the
infamous 228 Incident.
</P>
<P>
Music bands from Taiwan, China, Britain, the United States and
the Czech Republic performed in the concert as part of a "With
Justice We Cure the Nation" campaign.
</P>
<P>
The special concert  attracted  more than 10,000 audiences,
including many influential political figures from both ruling and
opposition camps, including Premier Su Tseng-chang, Legislative
Yuan President Wang Jin-pyng, Examination Yuan President Yao
Chia-wen, former President Lee Teng-hui, former Premier Frank
Hsieh, former opposition Kuomintang Chairman Ma Ying-jeou.
</P>
<P>
Organizers said the concert was designed to enlist support for
the "With Justice We Cure the Nation" campaign aimed at pursuing
transitional justice to get rid of negative legacies from the
previous period of authoritarian rule. The concert climaxed at
the signing of the declaration on the "Justice" campaign by
political bigwigs.
</P>
<P>
Except Ma, all other aspirants for the 2008 presidential election
signed the declaration to signify their support for all feasible
approaches  to heel historical  wounds from previous political
persecution and human rights abuses, including the 228 Incident.
</P>
<P>
President Chen Shui-bian signed the declaration before the
beginning of the concert. A video featuring his signing of the
declaration at the his office was shown at the concert. In the
video, Chen said he takes pleasure in signing the declaration and
seeing progress in the transitional justice campaign. He also
called for an end to ethnic animosity and confrontation.

<P>
Transitional justice refers to a range of approaches that
societies undertake to reckon with legacies of widespread  or
systematic human rights abuse as they move from a period of
violent conflict or oppression towards peace, democracy, the rule
of law, and respect for individual and collective rights.
</P>
<P>
In making such a transition, societies must confront the painful
legacy, or burden, of the past in order to achieve a holistic
sense of justice for all citizens, to establish or renew civic
trust, to reconcile people and communities, and to prevent future
abuses. A variety of approaches to transitional justice are
available that can help wounded societies start anew.
</P>
<P>
These approaches are both judicial and nonjudicial, and they seek
to encompass broadly the various dimensions of justice that can
heal wounds and contribute to social reconstruction.
</P>
<P>
Transitional  justice incorporates a realistic view of the
challenges faced by societies emerging from conflict or
repression, and an appreciation of their unique cultural and
historical contexts, without allowing these realities to serve as
excuses for inaction. All stakeholders in the transition process
must be consulted and participate in the design and
implementation of transitional justice policies.
