<P>
An amendment to the Road Traffic Management and Punishment Law
passed a third reading at the Legislative Yuan Friday, paving the
way toward allowing large motorcycles on Taiwan's express
highways.
</P>
<P>
The amendment to Article 92 of the law says that riders of
motorcycles with an engine capacity of 550 cc or larger are
entitled to the same right to use public roads as drivers of
small cars.
</P>
<P>
In addition to passing the amendment, the lawmakers adopted a
resolution calling  on  the  Ministry  of Transportation  and
Communications to work out related measures to prepare for the
new law's implementation in six months.
</P>
<P>
The resolution also called for an assessment on the feasibility
of allowing large motorcycles to operate on Taiwan's freeways to
be completed in two years.
</P>
<P>
Legislator Wei Ming-ku of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party
said Taiwan has seen an increase in the number of people riding
large motorcycles in recent years.
</P>
<P>
He noted that these motorcyclists have long been subjected to
unfair treatment, because they have been taxed at the same level
as small car owners but have been deprived of their right to ride
on the nation's expressways.
