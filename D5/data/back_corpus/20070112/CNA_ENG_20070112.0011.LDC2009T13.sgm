Kaohsiung Mayor Chen Chu will lead a delegation to Torino, Italy
Saturday to solicit support for the southern Taiwan port city's
bid to host the World University Games in 2011.
</P>
<P>
Members of the delegation will include Vice Mayor Cheng Wen-lung,
Kaohsiung Organizing Committee (KOC) Executive Director Chen Yi-
heng and former acting Kaohsiung Mayor Chen Chi-mai.
</P>
<P>
Chen Chu said he hopes to take stock of Chen Chi-mai's experience
in Germany in 2005 in winning the right for Kaohsiung to host the
World Games 2009.
</P>
<P>
Chen Yi-heng noted that five cities are bidding to host the 2011
World University Games and that Kaohsiung will face steep
competition from the other candidates, including Shenzhen, China.
</P>
<P>
Faced with China's relentless obstruction of Taiwan in the
international community, Chen Yi-heng said, Kaohsiung will
prepare as much as possible to try to win the support of the
selection panel.
</P>
<P>
He said Kaohsiung's advantages include the fact that after
hosting the World Games, the city will already have in place a
55,000-seat  stadium as well as an athletes village that can
accommodate 10,000.
</P>
<P>
A dome stadium is also scheduled to be completed in October this
year, he said.
</P>
<P>
Noting that more than 10,000 athletes from over 120 countries
will take part in the World University Games in 2011, he said
that if Kaohsiung can win the right to host the games, it will be
a further boost to the city's international profile.
