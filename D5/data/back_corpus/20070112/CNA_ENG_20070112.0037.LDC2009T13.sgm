KMT LAWMAKER DESCRIBES PARTY HEAD'S REMARKS AS `INAPPROPRIATE'

Taipei, Jan. 12 (CNA) 01/12/07  22:30:20 (By Flor Wang)

Main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Legislator Kuo Su-chun urged KMT
Chairman Ma Ying-jeou Friday to "weigh his own ability" in asking
China to deport a Taiwan businessmen, arguing that Ma's recent
remarks on the issue were "very inappropriate."
</P>
<P>
Kuo made the complaint at a national affairs forum in the
Legislative Yuan after Ma said a day earlier that he is willing
to ask China to deport Rebar Asia Pacific Group founder Wang You-
theng, who fled to China with his wife before a run broke out
Jan. 5 on a Rebar-affiliated bank.
</P>
<P>
Ma offered to help through "certain channels" in response to some
ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) lawmakers' claims that
the KMT should do its share to help assuage public concern over
the Chinese Bank run, which erupted after two Rebar subsidiaries
filed for bankruptcy protection Jan. 4, on the grounds that Wang
used to be a member of the KMT's powerful Central Standing
Committee.
</P>
<P>
Describing Ma's response as extremely improper, Kuo pointed out
that Ma has neither the authority, the responsibility nor the
obligation to demand that China send Wang back.
</P>
<P>
Although Ma is head of Taiwan's largest opposition party, Kuo
said, the KMT chief is still just a member of the public who has
never been to China and has no contacts within the Beijing
regime.
</P>
<P>
She asked Ma to assess his own standing before making any further
remarks that "go beyond his power" and that "he is not entitled
to air."
</P>
<P>
Kuo also accused the DPP of passing the buck to the KMT, because
Wang also once served as a national policy adviser to President
Chen Shui-bian.
</P>
<P>
DPP lawmaker Lee Ming-hsien claimed that the troubled Rebar Group
was a result of many illegal deals made between vested interest
groups and the KMT, which was Taiwan's ruling party before 2000.
</P>
<P>
DPP lawmaker Lin Chung-mo  called on both the ruling and
opposition parties to cooperate in pushing several law amendments
through the Legislative Yuan to allow the government to publish
the names of major bad loan delinquents and put them under public
scrutiny.
