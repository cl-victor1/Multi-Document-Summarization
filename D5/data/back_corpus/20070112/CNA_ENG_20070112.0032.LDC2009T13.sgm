DPP CAUCUS LEADER: 'GOVERNMENT DYSFUNCTION WORSE THAN CORRUPTION'
</HEADLINE>

Taipei, Jan.  12 (CNA) 01/12/07  20:37:09 (By Han Nai-kuo)

<P>
The bank run at The Chinese Bank in the past week shows that
"government dysfunction is more terrible than corruption," a
legislative caucus whip of the ruling Democratic Progressive
Party (DPP) said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Legislator Chen Ching-chun, general-secretary  of the DPP's
legislative caucus, told reporters in a rare harshly critical
manner that the government's "total dysfunction" in handling the
incident has failed the people and investors in Taiwan, and that
Premier Su Tseng-chang cannot escape his share of the blame.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the bank runs were triggered by the financial
distress of Rebar Asia-Pacific Group, owner of The Chinese Bank,
Chen said the financial problems of Rebar Group became known
several years ago, and that total losses incurred for Taiwan may
be as high as NT$100 billion (US$3.05 billion).
</P>
<P>
"Why did the bank runs still happen if the Cabinet's Financial
Supervisory Commission claimed that the Chinese Bank was on its
watch list more than five years ago?" he asked.
</P>
<P>
"How could the Financial  Supervisory  Commission  and its
Securities and Futures Bureau know nothing about Rebar Group's
insider trading before the group applied for insolvency
protection for two of its subsidiary companies?"
</P>
<P>
Rebar Group is currently under investigation for insider trading,
phony accounting practices and hollowing out company assets after
public prosecutors in Taipei seized some 50 boxes of documents,
including accounting and transaction records, from several of its
subsidiary companies.
</P>
<P>
Chen said the government must shoulder full responsibility for
Rebar Group moving its assets to China while leaving large debts
in Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
He added that the government's administrative branch has failed
in its duty because Wang You-theng, the 82-year-old founder and
chairman of Rebar Asia Pacific Group, was able to leave Taiwan
for China at the end of last year, the day after two major
subsidiaries -- China Rebar Co. and Chia Hsin Food and Synthetic
Fiber Co. -- filed for bankruptcy protection.
</P>
<P>
One of Wang's sons has confirmed that his father made it clear
that he would never come back to Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
The KMT legislator declined to say whether he believes the
premier should step down, but pointed out that the fact President
Chen Shui-bian spoke of the bank run incident five times while on
a overseas visit is something rare and bears a significant
political connotation.
</P>
<P>
The bank runs at The Chinese Bank's 35 branches around Taiwan
began Jan. 5 after the Taipei District Court approved a
restructuring request a day earlier by China Rebar and Chia Hsin,
which became insolvent after suffering losses totaling NT$25.2
billion over the past seven years.
</P>
<P>
Although the government asked the Central Deposit Insurance Corp.
to take over the troubled bank and used the Financial
Restructuring Fund -- also known as the Resolution Trust
Corporation (RTC) fund -- to cope with the crisis, account
holders withdrew more than NT$43 billion (US$1.32 billion) before
the bank runs eased on Jan. 10.
</P>
<P>
The bank runs and failure of related government regulatory
authorities to detect the Chinese Bank's financial problems in
advance have prompted lawmakers of both the ruling and the
opposition parties to call for the resignation of Minister of
Finance Ho Chih-chin and Financial Supervisory Commission
Chairman Shih Jun-ji.
