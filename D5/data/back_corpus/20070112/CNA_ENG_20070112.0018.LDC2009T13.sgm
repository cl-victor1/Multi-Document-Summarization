KMT CALLS FOR SUSPENSION OF BULLET TRAIN SERVICES
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taipei,  Jan. 12 (CNA) 01/12/07  18:09:38 (By Deborah Kuo)
</P>
<P>
The opposition Kuomintang (KMT) called for an immediate
suspension of "commercial test run" services of Taiwan's first
high-speed railway Friday in the wake of a series of incidents
over the past three days.
</P>
<P>
At a news conference held at the Legislative Yuan,  Tsai Chin-
lung, a party whip of the KMT legislative caucus, said the KMT
demanded a suspension of the bullet train services and that
services should not be resumed until all technical defects and
operational failures have been resolved.
</P>
<P>
Tsai added that the KMT legislative caucus condemns Premier Su
Tseng-chang and Transportation and Communications Minister Tsai
Duei for their endorsement of the inauguration of the high-speed
railway despite safety concerns.
</P>
<P>
He also said the government should also not condone people who
are responsible for the problems that have occurred with the
trains.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the spate of fiascoes, Tsai claimed that no country
around the world has a newly built, supposedly advanced railway
that has performed more poorly than the existing one.
</P>
<P>
The first incident occurred on the first day of the trial run
Jan. 5, when a THSR ticket vending machine spilled out a mountain
of NT$5 coins like a Las Vegas slot machine after a passenger
inserted a NT$1,000 bill for a ticket.
</P>
<P>
Clouds of unidentified fumes escaped in a carriage of one of the
trains bound for Banciao, Taipei County at around 7 p.m.
Thursday, frightening passengers who had to be evacuated to
neighboring carriages.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the Taiwan High Speed Rail Corp. said at a news
conference later that day that the fumes were probably caused by
short-circuited and burnt-out wires in the air conditioning
system of the carriage.
</P>
<P>
Other passengers were furious Thursday after a bullet train was
delayed by 26 minutes on a journey from Zuoying, in southern
Kaohsiung City to Banciao, in northern Taipei County, which
should only have taken 90 minutes.
</P>
<P>
Most passengers who took the inaugural trains on the first day of
commercial operations came away impressed by the experience, but
on Thursday, passengers who took the bullet train from Zuoying at
10: 25 a.m. -- the scheduled time -- arrived in Banciao at 12: 51
p.m. -- 26 minutes late.
</P>
<P>
The delay was caused by the failure of a door to close when the
train was preparing to depart from the Zuoying station. The
operators scrambled to bring another train into service, which
departed the Zuoying station only 43 minutes later.
</P>
<P>
Thursday's delay and fume escape marked the second and third
incidents involving the train in three consecutive days following
a minor accident Wednesday night when the doors of a bullet train
failed to open when it arrived from Zuoying at Tainan station.
The train departed Tainan two minutes after arrival at Tainan
without letting Tainan-bound passengers off nor Taipei-bound
passengers on the train.
</P>
<P>
After traveling for about a kilometer, the operators found the
cause of the problem, stopped the train and brought it back to
the Tainan station on the same rail.
</P>
<P>
The train arrived in Banciao at 9:38 p.m. -- 13 minutes late.
</P>
<P>
The 345-km railway linking Taipei and Kaohsiung has reduced rail
travel time between Taiwan's two largest cities to 90 minutes
from the previous four- and-a-half hours.
