DPP TO PROTEST AGAINST AMENDMENT FAVORING VETERANS
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  Jan.  12 (CNA) 01/12/07  16:33:02 (By Deborah Kuo)

The ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) will launch a
protest against the legislature should an amendment that would
allow special housing subsidies for military veterans be passed
into law, DPP Secretary-General Lin Chia-lung said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Lin said that if legislators from the opposition "pan-blue
alliance" of the Kuomintang and the People First Party push
through the amendment and pass it into law, the DPP will ally
with other groups, including major labor unions, to boycott the
amendment and the legislature.
</P>
<P>
Lin was referring to an amendment to an act governing the
reconstruction of veterans and military dependents' houses that
was approved in a first reading by the opposition-dominated
legislature Jan. 8 stipulating that some 350,000 veterans who do
not live in designated military residential compounds around the
country should also be entitled to special housing subsidies.
</P>
<P>
Lin made the remarks during a meeting at the DPP headquarters
with executives from five major labor unions over the initial
passage of the amendment.
</P>
<P>
Cheng Su-hua, chairwoman of the National Confederation of Workers
Unions, ridiculed the attempt of the amendment -- which
reportedly would require over NT$1 trillion (US$30.77 billion) to
subsidize reconstruction of old military residential compounds
that have been built since the 1950s for some 500,000 military
veterans -- and said preference should be given to the interests
and welfare of the eight million workers around the country.
</P>
<P>
She described the amendment as nothing more than a pork barrel
bill of the "pan- blue alliance" aimed at using government money
to curry favor from veterans -- who side mainly with the KMT --
in future elections.
</P>
<P>
Cheng noted that the government has already appropriated over
NT$500 billion for the reconstruction of old military residential
compounds.
</P>
<P>
Huang Shu-hui, secretary-general of the Confederation of Drivers'
Unions, asked if the veterans still need additional care after
the government adopted a series of programs to take care of them
and their dependents for decades.
</P>
<P>
Huang told the politicians not to curry favor from the military
and their dependents while ignoring ordinary people living in
poverty.
