Taiwan promised an aid package to Burkina Faso to help the
African country boost its economy after the two countries signed
13 agreements Friday, Republic of China Ambassador to Burkina
Faso Tao Wen-lung said later that day.
</P>
<P>
According to the agreements, Taiwan will provide technology and
capital to Burkina Faso to develop vocational training, rice
cultivation and tilapia sales and production, as well as
improving irrigation systems, bridging the digital divide and
manufacturing kaoliang liquor, over the next eight years.
</P>
<P>
The Taiwan government has offered an aid package involving a fund
of over US$70 million, rather than directly offering money, Tao
said during a telephone interview with the Central News Agency
(CNA).
</P>
<P>
Tao offered the explanation after foreign wire services reported
that Taiwan had promised Burkina Faso US$75 million in aid.
</P>
<P>
The materials or equipment needed for carrying out the projects
will be mostly purchased from Taiwan, the ambassador said, adding
that the equipment for the kaoliang liquor distillery will be
purchased from Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
A team of 30 experts from Taiwan will also be sent to Burkina
Faso to help construct the distillery and provide liquor-making
technology, according to Tao.
