<P>
The number of indigenous dengue fever cases around Taiwan has climbed
to 163 owing to the rainy weather over the past week, Center for
Disease Control officials said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Of these cases, 105 have been reported in Kaohsiung City, 55 in
Kaohsiung County and three in Pingtung County, all in southern Taiwan,
the officials said.
</P>
<P>
CDC Deputy Director-General Lin Ting pointed out that Kaohsiung City
has seen the worst outbreak this year, with dengue fever cases
reported in 25 boroughs in eight districts of the city.
</P>
<P>
In Kaohsiung County, all 55 cases have been in Fengshan City, Lin
said.
</P>
<P>
Lin reminded the public to clean up any containers prone to
accumulating water to prevent infestations of mosquitoes, the vector
of the disease.
</P>
<P>
The Kaohsiung city government has decided to step up its inspection of
schools, with schools that register a high level of larval infestation
density of the aedes aegypti mosquito being subject to fines of up to
NT$15,000, Lin noted.
