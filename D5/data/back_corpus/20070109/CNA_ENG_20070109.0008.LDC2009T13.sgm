The opposition People First Party (PFP) is planning to cut staff
in the coming months due to the party's increased financial
difficulties, according to PFP spokesman Lee Hung-chun.
</P>
<P>
Lee confirmed the news Monday and said that the PFP Chairman
James Soong has been trying hard to solicit donations and loans
to maintain the party's operations at a time when the party's
debt amounts to some NT$90 million (US$2.7 million).
</P>
<P>
To reduce its financial burden, the party has decided to cut its
staff by 60 percent as well as its space at its central office
after the coming Lunar New Year which falls on Feb. 18, Lee
explained, adding that the party will have to ask for help from
volunteers to assist in the party's operations.
</P>
<P>
The PFP has long faced financial troubles because it does not run
any businesses nor does it own any assets, Lee said.
</P>
<P>
PFP Legislator Liu Wen-hsiung expressed his regrets for the party
workers who will be laid off and not receive a year-end bonus,
saying that the party central is really very sorry for such a
development.
</P>
<P>
Soong set up the PFP in 2000 after defying the then ruling
Kuomintang to run in the presidential election that year. He lost
the election to President Chen Shui-bian by a narrow margin. The
PFP currently controls 22 seats in the 220-member Legislative
Yuan, a big drop from more than 40 seats it held in the previous
legislature.
