Taipei, Jan.  8  (CNA) 01/09/07  10:28:48 (By Han Nai-kuo)

<P>
A new animal molecular imaging system developed by the Institute
of Nuclear Energy Research in Taiwan is leading the world in this
research area and is expected to tap into the world market
successfully, officials from the Cabinet- level Atomic Energy
Council said Monday.
</P>
<P>
The officials made the prediction at a press conference held at
the council to disclose the research results of the Institute of
Nuclear Energy Research (INER) on a newly developed micro-PET/CT
system for animal imaging.
</P>
<P>
The system can serve the dual purpose of providing tumor imaging
to help doctors' diagnosis and increasing precision in the dosage
of medicine.
</P>
<P>
Jan Mei-ling, associate researcher at INER, pointed out that in
vivo molecular imaging techniques have seen rapid development
over the past decade, and that the non-intrusive nuclear imaging
method provides three-dimensional information on animal
molecules.
</P>
<P>
She added that the method is a technology acknowledged by the
Food and Drug Administration (FDA) of the United States as useful
in shortening the time period for developing new medicines.
</P>
<P>
She also said that Current Medical Imaging Reviews, a renowned
international journal, has published an article on the INER-
developed imaging system.
</P>
<P>
INER will apply for FDA certification for the new imaging system
and will not rule out the possibility of tapping the world market
even before obtaining the FDA certification, she added.
