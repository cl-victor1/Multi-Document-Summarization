Most respondents to a recent poll think the government should not
shut down elementary schools in remote areas with fewer than 100
pupils, according to results of the survey released Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The survey, conducted by National Normal University between late
September and early October last year, drew effective answers
from a sample of 1,118 people aged between 20 and 55, with a
margin of error of 3 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
The results show that 74 percent of the respondents were opposed
to the government's recent decision to close more than 100
elementary schools in remote areas that had fewer than 100
students in order to save on operating costs.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, 73 percent said universities that cannot enroll enough
students should be shut down.
</P>
<P>
Another 73 percent of those polled said they support the
government's plan to reduce the number of students in each
elementary or junior high school class from 32 students in 2007
to 29 in 2010.
</P>
<P>
Statistics also show that 85 percent of the respondents believe
that increasingly high educational expenses are a major reason
why some married couples in Taiwan are reluctant to have
children, while another 85 percent agreed that the decreasing
birthrate will have a negative impact on Taiwan's development.
</P>
<P>
According to National Taiwan Normal University's Center for
Educational Research, the number of newly enrolled pupils dropped
to below 300,000 this year and is expected to decrease further to
fewer than 200,000 in five years.
