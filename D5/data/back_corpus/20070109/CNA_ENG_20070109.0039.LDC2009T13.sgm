The Cabinet-level National Science Council (NSC) has estimated
that the Central Taiwan Science Park will generate NT$240 billion
in total revenue this year and in 2015, the total revenue will
surpass NT$1 trillion, officials said Tuesday.

The remark came after the Legislative Yuan passed the third
reading of an organic law of the park's administration bureau.

The officials said that 85 companies have been approved to set up
plants in the park since it was established more than three years
ago.

Total investment in the park this year is forecast to exceed NT$2
trillion, the officials said, adding that the total revenue is
likely to surpass NT$240 billion with the creation of nearly
30,000 jobs.

The law will accelerate the park's development and enable it to
be on a par with the two other science industrial parks in
northern Hsinchu County and southern Tainan County,  according
to the officials.
