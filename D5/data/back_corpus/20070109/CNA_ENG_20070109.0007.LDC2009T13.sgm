Taipei,  Jan.  9 (CNA) 01/09/07  14:15:24 (By Lilian Wu)

<P>
The Council of Labor Affairs (CLA) has decided to allocate funds
for private caregiving service groups in its latest bid to
encourage more employers to hire local caregivers over their
foreign counterparts.
</P>
<P>
CLA officials said the council's Bureau of Employment and
Vocational Training will commission 128 local caregiver groups to
recruit staff for a monthly salary of NT$17,600 (US$530) to scout
for possible employers of local caregivers.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the groups will also hire managers with a monthly
salary of between NT$29,700 and NT$34,000. The money for the
staff and manager salaries will be funneled by the CLA through
its employment stabilization fund. The CLA will provide 1,000
such subsidies this year.
</P>
<P>
The officials said that acting on a resolution reached at the
Conference on Sustaining Taiwan's Economic Development held last
year, they launched the plan to gradually replace foreign
caregivers with local caregivers.
</P>
<P>
They said that foreign caregivers are still in greater demand
among local employers, adding that there were 150,076 foreign
caregivers in Taiwan as of the end of November 2006.
</P>
<P>
Although the government  has promoted the local caregiving
industry since January 2006 by subsidizing employers who hire
local caregivers, only 62 employers have hired local caregivers
so far, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
They said that currently, employers pay around NT$20,000 per
month for a foreign caregiver's salary. In comparison, employers
pay between NT$30,000 and NT$35,000 per month in salary for local
caregivers, but they also receive a monthly subsidy of NT$10,000
from the government.
</P>
<P>
Although the salaries are similar when the subsidy is factored
in, foreign caregivers are still generally preferred as local
caregivers spend between eight and 12 hours at an employer's
house, while most foreign caregivers reside at the employer's
home around the clock.
