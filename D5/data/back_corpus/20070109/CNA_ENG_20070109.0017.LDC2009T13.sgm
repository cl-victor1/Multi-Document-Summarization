Taipei,  Jan.  9 (CNA) 01/09/07  16:43:40 (By Lilian Wu)

The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) declined to comment
Tuesday on whether President Chen Shui-bian would meet with U.S.
dignitaries during his stopover in San Francisco en route to
Nicaragua to attend Nicaraguan President-elect Daniel Ortega's
inauguration Jan. 10.
</P>
<P>
MOFA spokesman Wang Chien-yeh made the remarks after Chen and his
entourage arrived in the California city for a transit stop
before heading  to Managua, capital  of Nicaragua,  for
Wednesday's inauguration.
</P>
<P>
ROC Representative to the United States David Tawei Lee and
American Institute in Taiwan Chairman Raymond Burghardt were on
hand to welcome Chen.
</P>
<P>
Wang said the United States arranged for the president's transit
stop in line with the principles of safety, comfort, convenience
and dignity as in the past.
</P>
<P>
The details concerning the transit stop were arranged in a way
acceptable to both sides, he added.
</P>
<P>
On China Times reports that Hsueh Shih-min, director of the
National Security Bureau, went to Nicaragua to meet with Ortega
so as to prevent another "Chad incident" from occurring, Wang
only said that there is always an advance team dispatched prior
to any overseas visit by the president, declining to comment on
whether Hsueh had visited the central American country.
</P>
<P>
President Chen's visit is aimed at cementing bilateral relations,
Wang stressed.
</P>
<P>
Premier Su Tseng-chang canceled a plan to visit Chad in August
2006 to attend the second inauguration of Chadian President
Idriss Deby after learning on the eve of his departure that the
African nation was ready to switch diplomatic recognition to
Beijing.
