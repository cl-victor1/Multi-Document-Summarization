INFECTIOUS SWAMP FEVER FEARED MAKING COMEBACK IN TAIWAN

Taipei,  Feb. 6 (CNA) (By Deborah Kuo)
</P>
<P>
Leptospirosis, an infectious disease spread by domestic animals and
characterized by jaundice and fever, is suspected of making a comeback
to Taiwan after 10 such cases were confirmed late last year with one
recent fatality.
</P>
<P>
Leptospirosis, also called swamp fever, is an infectious disease of
domestic animals, especially cattle, swine, dogs and rats, caused by
spirochetes of the genus Leptospira.
</P>
<P>
The disease was declared extinct in Taiwan some 30 years ago, but
several cases have been reported in the past three years, prompting
the Center for Disease Control (CDC) under the Department of Health to
announce it as a newly found infectious disease in Taiwan last March,
said CDC Deputy Director Hsu Kuo-hsiung.
</P>
<P>
Domestic animals are highly susceptible to swamp fever and in turn
spread the disease to humans who come into contact with the animals'
urine or feces. People who have cuts or wounds and spend time in dirty
areas or areas close to water are at most risk of contracting the
disease, according to Hsu.
</P>
<P>
People at particularly high risk, such as veterinarians, mine workers
and those in the field of animal husbandry, should be especially
careful, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Victims of the disease usually have symptoms including fever,
headache, chills, myalgia, meningitis, inflammation of the mucous
membranes and jaundice.
</P>
<P>
One of the 10 recently reported cases, a 41-year-old man died of the
disease Jan. 5, not long after checking into Kuangtien General
Hospital in Taichung County, central Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Hospital sources said the man, a hepatitis patient, died of swamp
fever because the hepatitis had robbed him of the power to resist the
disease.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on this fatal case, Professor Pan Ming-cheng from National
Taiwan University's Institute of Veterinary Medicine said
leptospirosis, even if confirmed as an outbreak, is not as lethal as
the Hanta virus that has been causing worries around Taiwan recently.
</P>
<P>
Swamp fever, which can be cured with antibiotics, can be easily
prevented if people wash their hands more often, avoid cuts and
contact with unclean water, and refrain from drinking untreated water
in the outdoors, the professor said.
