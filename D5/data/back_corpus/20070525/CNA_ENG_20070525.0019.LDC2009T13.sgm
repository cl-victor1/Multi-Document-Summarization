Taipei, May  25  (CNA) 05/25/07  16:05:54 (By Lilian Wu)

<P>
The Executive Yuan is moving in the direction of implementing the
minimum wage hike on July 1, Cabinet Secretary-General Chen Chin-
jun said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Chen made the remarks after Premier Chang Chun-hsiung listened to
briefings by the Council of Labor Affairs (CLA), the Ministry of
the Interior, the Ministry of Transportation and Communications,
the Central Election Commission and the Council of Aboriginal
Peoples on their business, in Chang's third such meeting with
ministry officials since assuming the premiership Monday.
</P>
<P>
On the planned minimum wage hike, Chang asked his deputy, Vice
Premier Chiou I-jen,  to convene a meeting soon to sort out
differences on the issue.
</P>
<P>
The premier said that the minimum wage is aimed at protecting the
livelihood of laborers and maintaining their purchasing power. He
also noted that the minimum wage has remained unchanged since
1997. He further  said that the minimum  wage hike will take into
consideration the basic needs of laborers, the impact on Taiwan's
industrial competitiveness, and consumer price fluctuations
</P>
<P>
In late April, then-premier Su Tseng-chang expressed the hope
that the minimum wage hike could be implemented July 1. A minimum
wage screening committee convened by the CLA subsequently decided
that the level of the increase should be between 7.5 percent and
9.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
The CLA later suggested that the hike level be set at 9.09
percent, meaning that the minimum wage should be raised from the
current NT$15,840 (US$476) per month to NT$17,280 and that the
minimum hourly wage should be raised from NT$66 to NT$95.
</P>
<P>
However, major business and industrial groups called for an
increase of no more than 5 percent, with a minimum hourly wage of
no more than NT$82.
