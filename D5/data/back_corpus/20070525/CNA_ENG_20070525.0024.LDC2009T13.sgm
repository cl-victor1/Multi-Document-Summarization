Nearly 60 overseas Taiwanese business people from around the
world have come to Taiwan to attend a workshop to get tips on
starting and managing franchise operations, the Overseas
Compatriot Affairs Commission (OCAC) reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Fifty-nine overseas Taiwanese business people from 15 countries
on five continents have been attending a two-week workshop being
held at the Beitou Resort in Taipei since May 14 on how to start
up and operate franchise stores by learning from the experiences
of the operators of various franchises that have thrived around
Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
OCAC officials said that the workshop is aimed at helping
overseas Taiwanese emigrants find new business opportunities or
business partners in Taiwan on the one hand, and helping domestic
franchise operators globalize their business operations on the
other.
</P>
<P>
Lin Yi-hsin,  head of a Taiwanese business federation  in
Indonesia, who is one of the delegates attending the workshop,
said Taiwan franchise operators have experience and know-how that
is in no way inferior to that of their counterparts from the
United States or Europe, adding that he will "borrow the Taiwan
experiences" to start up his own franchise operations in
Indonesia.
