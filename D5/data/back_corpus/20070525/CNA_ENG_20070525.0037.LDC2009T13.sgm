The National Theater has invited a cross-cultural dance group
named the Homeless Dance Company to perform at its Experimental
Theater May 25-27 to reinforce exchanges among Asian dance
artists, a spokesman for the National Theater said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Local choreographers and dance students have been invited to
attend the performances, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The dance group comprises five choreographers from five different
cities -- Motoko Ikeda from Tokyo, Natalie Cursio from Melbourne,
Kim Sung-Yong from Seoul, Daniel Yeung from Hong Kong and Chan
Yu-chun from Taipei.
</P>
<P>
The group is a by-product of the Little Asia Dance Exchange
Network Tour of 2004. Five of the tour's Asian artists decided to
have regular meetings to generate creations that combine
different cultures.

The spokesman said Taipei is the third leg of the group's
performance called "Austral-Asian-Dual-Invasion." The performance
grows and develops with cultural stimulations of different
cities, beginning at 30 minutes long in the first leg in
Melbourne, extending into 60 minutes in Hong Kong, and then
increasing again to 90 minutes in Taipei.

<P>
Multimedia images by Taiwanese video designer Carrie Ou, sound
effects by Yu Huan-fu and paintings by Tamsui Elementary School
students have added even more vitality and interest to the
creation, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The National Theater also invited the dance group to hold
workshops for Taiwanese art students and local artists after the
performances, the spokesman added.
