KMT TO WRITE 'TAIWAN' INTO PARTY CHARTER
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,    May    25   (CNA) 05/25/07  13:41:14 (By Y.F. Low)

<P>
Opposition  Kuomintang  (KMT) Secretary-General Wu Den-yih
confirmed Friday that the party is planning to revise its charter
to include the "Taiwan-centered" value in the document.
</P>
<P>
With the conditions for Taiwan to unify with China or declare
independence lacking at the moment, the KMT's best policy is to
put aside the unification versus independence dispute and
concentrate on improving the Taiwan people's well-being, Wu said.
</P>
<P>
Wu stressed that "Taiwanization" is not a monopoly of the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party and that the majority of KMT members
have a deep attachment to Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
"The direction of the planned amendment is correct, because we
should love Taiwan first before we can safeguard the Republic of
China," Wu said.
</P>
<P>
According to a media report, a draft for the amendment was
finalized by the KMT early this week and is expected to be
approved by the party's national congress slated for June 24.
</P>
<P>
In what would mark the first time that the word "Taiwan" is
written into the charter of the China-originated KMT, the draft
amendment states that the KMT will "stick to the 'Taiwan-
centered, pro-people' philosophy to fight for the overall
interests of ethnic Chinese," the report said.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the draft proposes a major change to an article on
party membership to remove "national unification" as an objective
of the KMT, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The present KMT charter stipulates: "Residents on the Chinese
mainland who oppose the communist system, identify with the Three
Principles of the People, and are willing to strive with the KMT
for the goal of national unification are considered members of
the party in spirit."
</P>
<P>
Under the draft amendment, people who do not hold ROC citizenship
but who identify with the Three Principles of the People and are
willing to work with the KMT for "the peace and development of
the country" are considered KMT members in spirit, according to
the report.
</P>
<P>
The report said the proposed changes would pave the way for the
KMT's transformation into a "Taiwanized" party and set the tone
for KMT presidential nominee Ma Ying-jeou's  policy statement  on
cross-Taiwan Strait relations.
</P>
<P>
Also Friday, Legislative Yuan speaker Wang Jin-pyng expressed his
support for the KMT's effort to revise its charter, which he
called a "pragmatic move" that should have been made long ago.
</P>
<P>
Wang said the move will signify that the KMT is transforming
itself into a Taiwanized party and will be favorable to the
party's campaign for the 2008 presidential election.
</P>
<P>
Wang said he does not think the changes will reduce the level of
support of traditional KMT supporters of the party.
