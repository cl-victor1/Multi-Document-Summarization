TAIWAN REDESIGNATED AS 'CHINESE TAIPEI' IN OIE
</HEADLINE>

Paris,  May 25 (CNA) 05/25/07  21:47:24 (By Sofia Wu)
</P>
<P>
The 169-member World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) voted
Friday in favor of Taiwan's continued membership under the new
name of "Chinese Taipei."
</P>
<P>
OIE Secretary-General Bernard Vallat said after the secret ballot
that simultaneous inclusion of Taiwan and China as members will
contribute to global animal disease management and control.
</P>
<P>
Permanent members of the OIE passed the resolution on Taiwan's
continued participation in the organization under the new name of
"Chinese  Taipei"  in a secret vote on the last day of the
organization's annual assembly.
</P>
<P>
Describing the vote as "historic, " Vallat said effective control
of animal diseases requires as much transparent information as
possible and close cooperation among member states.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the international community cannot afford a "missing
link" in the global animal health information network, Vallat
said global animal epidemic control would be unable to improve
any further without the simultaneous participation of Taiwan and
China.
</P>
<P>
After the vote, the Paris-based OIE issued a statement saying
that the OIE is one of the few international organizations that
accept both China and Chinese Taipei as full members.
</P>
<P>
The new designation for Taiwan is seen as a compromise between
the two sides of the Taiwan Strait.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan gained accession to the OIE in 1954 under the name of
"Republic of China (Taiwan), " but was forced to change the name
to "Taipei China" after Beijing was admitted to the organization
in 1992.
</P>
<P>
However, China remains dissatisfied with the alteration. In an
attempt to push the OIE to make further concession to change
Taiwan's membership name, China has refused not only to
participate in OIE activities, but also to pay its membership
fees.
</P>
<P>
To try to resolve the problem, the OIE International Committee
passed a resolution in 2003 to change Taiwan's membership name
from "Taipei China" into "Separate Quarantine Territory of
Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen and Matsu. "
</P>
<P>
At that time, Taiwan made clear that it would accept the new name
but China refused to accept the resolution and did not take part
in the final vote on the issue.
</P>
<P>
Since then, the two sides have been using their membership names
that were chosen in 1992.
</P>
<P>
With animal epidemics draw increasing concern, the OIE tried
again this year to resolve the issue and finally secured a
compromise.
