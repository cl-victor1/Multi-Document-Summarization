The southern embankment of the Suao harbor in Yilan County,
northeastern Taiwan, will be opened for angling during weekends
this summer, Legislator Chen Chin-teh of the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party announced Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The area has been banned to anglers under the regulations
governing operations in business ports, although it attracts
schools of migrating fish.
</P>
<P>
In 2006, the harbor bank was opened for a one-day fishing contest
held by the Yilan County Angling Rights Development Association,
the first of this kind there, according to Chen, who added that
this prompted the authorities to lift the ban.
</P>
<P>
According to the association, the area will be opened for angling
every weekend from May 26-Aug. 26. Those who want to fish there
will have to register with the association, which will impose a
200-person daily limit.
