Minister  of  Transportation  and Communications Tsai Duei is set
to depart later Friday for Sweden to attend the 23d Conference of
Taiwan-Sweden Economic Cooperation to be held in Stockholm May
28.
</P>
<P>
Tsai will deliver a speech on the development and application of
smart cards in Taiwan's mass transport systems during the one-day
conference, whose theme is "Digital Life and Automobile
Electronics," said Irene  Sun,  a spokeswoman  of the Taipei-
based  Chinese International Economic Cooperation Association
(CIECA).
</P>
<P>
In addition to Tsai and several Ministry of Transportation and
Communications officials, some 20 representatives from Taiwan's
private telecommunications, automobile and electronics
manufacturing sectors are also expected to attend the conference,
which is being jointly sponsored by the CIECA and the Swedish
Trade Council, according to Sun.
</P>
<P>
Noting that CIECA tallies show that the global market for
automobile computers and electronics is expected to reach
US$163.5 billion for 2008, marking a significant increase from
the figure of US$122.5 billion for 2004, Sun said that Taiwan's
electronics and information technology industries have a great
opportunity to cash in on this lucrative market.
</P>
<P>
A series of fact-finding visits and tours around Sweden have been
scheduled for after the conference. The tours will take Tsai and
the other Taiwan delegates to the Scandinavian country's largest
science park, Kista; the headquarters of mobile phone giant
Ericsson; and automakers Scania, Volvo and Saab, Sun said.
</P>
<P>
Tsai is scheduled to return to Taipei July 3.
