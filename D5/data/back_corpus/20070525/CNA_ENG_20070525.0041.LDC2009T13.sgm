The passenger who buys the 5 millionth ticket of the Taiwan High
Speed Rail (THSR) will win 10 tickets entitling him or her to
business class travel on the train, a THSR spokesman said Friday.

The winner will be able to use the tickets at any time within one
year, and will also be given four models of the high speed train.

The spokesman said the 5 millionth passenger is expected to buy a
ticket around May 27-28, as the accumulated number of THSR
passengers had already broken 4.82 million Wednesday and is
growing by an average of 35,000 passengers per day.

One passenger before and one after the 5 millionth will each win
two business class tickets and model trains.

The spokesman reminded passengers to take note of the number
printed on the bottom left corner of their tickets so that they
do not miss the chance of winning the prize.
