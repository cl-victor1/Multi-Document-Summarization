BCC REFUSES TO GIVE BACK TWO RADIO FREQUENCIES
</HEADLINE>

Taipei, April 9 (CNA) 04/10/07  11:23:13 (By Han Nai-kuo)
</P>
<P>
The Taipei-based Broadcasting Corporation of China (BCC) urged
the National Communications Commission (NCC) Monday to maintain
its status as an independent agency and ignore the Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) government's demand that the NCC take
back two radio frequencies being used by the BCC.
</P>
<P>
The BCC said in a statement that if the government keeps pressing
the NCC to take back the two frequencies, the BCC will resort to
administrative litigation and demand state compensation.
</P>
<P>
The BBC explained that in 2004, the Government Information Office
had agreed to a corrective measure proposed by the Control Yuan
-- the nation's highest watchdog body -- that the BCC give back
the radio frequency being used by its Formosa Network when the
company's digital broadcasting begins commercial operations.
</P>
<P>
The statement pointed out that BCC has not yet applied for
commercial digital broadcasting, and therefore the government
would be "eating its own words" if it requires the BCC to give
back the frequency.
</P>
<P>
The statement further noted that the NCC has not reclaimed
another radio frequency being used by the BCC's Wave 96, a music
network, mainly because an assessment by the NCC has led to the
conclusion that the BCC would have a great chance of winning a
court battle to claim state compensation if the NCC takes back
the frequency.
</P>
<P>
The BCC used to be a broadcasting company owned by the Kuomintang
(KMT), which held power in Taiwan for 51 years until 2000.
</P>
<P>
The company was founded as the Central Broadcasting System in
Nanjing in 1928 and adopted its current name in 1947. It moved to
Taiwan in 1949 when the Kuomintang government lost a civil war
against the Chinese Communists.
</P>
<P>
The BCC, which has the most radio network services in Taiwan,
became a privately owned company unrelated to the KMT in 2005.
