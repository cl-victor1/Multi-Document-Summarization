NCC MAY SEEK CONSTITUTIONALITY RULING ON SUSPENSION OF
COMMISSIONERS
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taipei,  April 10 (CNA) 04/10/07  11:54:39 (By Sofia Wu)

<P>
The National Communications Commission (NCC) said Tuesday it may
seek a ruling on the constitutionality of the Executive Yuan's
demand that two of its commissioners be suspended from their jobs
for violating a conflict of interest law.
</P>
<P>
The NCC made the remarks a day after the Executive Yuan announced
that NCC commissioners Wu Chung-chi and Liu Kung-chung should be
suspended for violating the spirit of the conflict of interest
law by hiring  close  relatives  to serve  as their  chauffeurs
in government-provided cars.
</P>
<P>
Executive Yuan Deputy Secretary-General Chen Mei-ling said at a
news conference Monday that the Central Personnel Administration
will soon refer the cases to the Control Yuan to determine how
much they should be fined and whether they should be fired.
</P>
<P>
The NCC will hold a meeting Tuesday to discuss response measures,
including whether to ask the Council of Grand Justices to rule
whether the Executive Yuan's demand to suspend its commissioners
is constitutional, an NCC spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
In addition to informing the Executive Yuan of its conclusions,
the spokesman said, the NCC will also furnish the Legislative
Yuan with a copy of its letter to the executive branch since the
appointment of NCC commissioners was approved by the legislature
in the first place.
</P>
<P>
Stressing that the NCC is an independent body which is not under
the jurisdiction of the Executive Yuan, the spokesman argued that
the Executive Yuan doesn't have the power to suspend NCC
commissioners.
</P>
<P>
After conducting a thorough probe into the NCC's operations, a
special panel headed by Minister-without-Portfolio Hsu Chih-
hsiung also came up with a report Monday that outlined several
other major legal transgressions the NCC needs to deal with and
some loose ends it needs to tie up, including probes into the
notorious "tarred duck" false alarm, the gangster threat video
incident, the phase-out of the NCC petition committee, and
retrieval of two radio frequencies given to Taipei-based
Broadcasting Corp. of China.
</P>
<P>
In xxxx, the Council of Grand Justices declared the NCC's
partisan-based formation as unconstitutional and set Dec. 31,
2008 as its "sunset" or "closure" date.
</P>
<P>
The current NCC is made up of commissioners recommended by
political parties in proportion to the number of seats they hold
in the legislature.
</P>
<P>
NCC commissioners have decided to step down en masse Jan. 31,
2008 when the term of the current legislature expires.
