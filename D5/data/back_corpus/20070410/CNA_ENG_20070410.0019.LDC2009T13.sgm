The government hopes Nicaraguan Minister of Foreign Affairs
Samuel Santos can visit Taiwan soon to discuss the feasibility of
bilateral cooperative projects in various fields, a Ministry of
Foreign Affairs (MOFA) official said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Simon Ko, director-general of the MOFA's Department of Central
and South American Affairs, made the remarks after Santos
postponed his visit to Taiwan originally scheduled for late
March.
</P>
<P>
At a regular press conference held at the MOFA's office, Ko
attributed Santo's delaying his visit to his busy schedule,
noting that he has to help the new Nicaraguan government plan for
many policies.
</P>
<P>
Noting that Taiwan's government has not received any details of
planned cooperative projects from the Nicaraguan government, Ko
said concrete cooperation between the two countries will have to
be discussed during Santo's Taiwan visit.
</P>
<P>
According to Ko, President Chen Shui-bian became aware of
Nicaragua's urgent medical needs during his visit to the Central
American country in January to attend Nicaraguan President Daniel
Ortega's inauguration and managed to send medical groups to
Nicaragua and Saint Kitts and Nevis to offer voluntary medical
care in late March through MOFA's International Cooperation and
Development Fund.
</P>
<P>
The service provided by Taiwan's medical groups has received a
warm response from the Nicaraguan government and people, Ko
added.
</P>
<P>
During Chen's visit to Nicaragua in January, Santos and his
Taiwanese counterpart,  James Huang,  signed a memorandum  of
understanding, with the two sides promising to maintain
diplomatic ties. On that occasion, Santos was invited to visit
Taiwan in March to materialize the cooperative projects between
the two countries, an invitation that Santos accepted
immediately.
