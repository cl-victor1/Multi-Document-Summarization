Taipei,  April 9 (CNA) 04/10/07  11:24:04 (By Y.C. Jou)

Ethanol-blended gasoline will be available at seven gas stations
in Taipei beginning in September, energy authorities said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Part of a pioneer project to promote biomass energy, the seven
stations that provide E3 ethanol-blended gasoline - 97 percent of
gasoline and 3 percent of ethanol - will serve mostly
governmental vehicles but also welcome private cars, said Yeh
Huey-ching, Chief of the Bureau of Energy under the Ministry of
Economic Affairs (MOEA).
</P>
<P>
Yeh said since the ethanol-blended gasoline, estimated to cost
NT$30 per liter, is more expensive than gasoline, the ministry
will draft a bill that allows subsidization for ethanol-blended
gasoline by June, adding details of the bill still need to be
worked out.
</P>
<P>
Also, the MOEA has chosen Chiayi and Taoyuan counties as"Green
Counties", where public buses will use diesel with 1 percent bio,
Yeh said.
