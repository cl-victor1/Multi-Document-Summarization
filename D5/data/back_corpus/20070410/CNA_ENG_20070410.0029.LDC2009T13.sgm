Tainan Mayor Hsu Tain-tsair was indicted Tuesday for awarding
undue profits to a construction company, with prosecutors asking
that he be given a 12-year prison term, according to the Tainan
Prosecutors Office.
</P>
<P>
The Tainan Prosecutors Office brought the indictment against Hsu
after wrapping up its lengthy probe into the case, initiated by
tip offs from the municipal public work affairs bureau and a
letter signed by over 10 city councilors accusing Hsu of
unlawfully favoring the construction company which won a contract
to build the city's underground malls.
</P>
<P>
Although three Tainan mayors had involved in the underground mall
project, Hsu is the only one indicted in the case for allegedly
using his position to profit NT$200 million for the company since
the construction project kicked off more than a decade ago during
the tenure of former Mayor Shih Chih-ming.
</P>
<P>
Nine other suspects, including three officials and ex-officials
of the Tainan city government,  and six employees  from the
construction company were also indicted on charges ranging from
corruption and illicit profiteering to document forgery,
prosecutors said.
</P>
<P>
According to prosecutors, the investigation showed that Hsu, who
took over the mayoral post in Dec. 2001, allegedly instructed
municipal officials in charge of the construction project to
conspire with the company's manager, surnamed Kuo, to chalk up
illegal profits, although the municipal public work affairs
bureau and supervisory agents of the construction plan had
discovered the plot and tried to stop them.
