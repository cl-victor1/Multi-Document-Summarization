Kaohsiung Mayor Chen Chu pledged Tuesday that the southern Taiwan
city will embrace central government agencies relocated to
Kaohsiung, stressing that municipal authorities will do their
utmost to find suitable spaces for them.
</P>
<P>
Chen made the pledge following a municipal meeting and expressed
her appreciation for the Kaohsiung city council's decision a day
earlier to create a task force to promote relocation.
</P>
<P>
Apart from the Council of Labor Affairs (CLA) and the Fisheries
Agency under the Council of Agriculture (COA) , the Kaohsiung
city council also added the Cabinet-level National Council on
Physical Fitness and Sports to its list of agencies that might be
relocated on the grounds that the city is to host an
international sports event in 2009, she noted.
</P>
<P>
In addition, she said, the Kaohsiung city government is setting
its sights on relocating the Examination Yuan and the Control
Yuan, Chinese Petroleum Corp. and Taiwan Power Company to
Kaohsiung.
</P>
<P>
Relaying the Executive  Yuan's firm stance on achieving a
"regional balance" and of developing "twin nuclei" in northern
and southern Taiwan, Chen said that the CLA's proposed relocation
to Kaohsiung is of great significance to the city's 600,000
workers as it should then be able to better address local
laborers' needs and enhance their interests and rights.
</P>
<P>
Pointing out that the Kaohsiung municipal authorities have
identified a good location for the CLA to construct an office
building, Chen said that the CLA's relocation is just a matter of
time, adding that a local fishermen's training center in
Chienchen district has been designated to house the COA's
Fisheries Agency.
</P>
<P>
The ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) and President Chen
Shui-bian rekindled the central government agency relocation plan
along with a name rectification drive for state-run companies and
public establishments earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
Opposition parties have criticized the ruling DPP for rehashing
what they described as ideological issues meant only to solicit
voter support as the legislative and presidential elections
approach.
