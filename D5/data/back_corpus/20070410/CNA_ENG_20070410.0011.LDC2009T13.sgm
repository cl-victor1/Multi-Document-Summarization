2 NCC COMMISSIONERS SHOULD BE SUSPENDED FOR VIOLATIONS: CABINET
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taipei,  April 10 (CNA) 04/10/07  11:30:19 (By Sofia Wu)
</P>
<P>
The Executive Yuan has ordered that two commissioners of the
National Communications Commission (NCC) be suspended from their
jobs for violating conflict of interest laws.
</P>
<P>
Executive Yuan Deputy Secretary-General Chen Mei-ling made the
announcement at a news conference Monday in which an
investigation report on the body's legal infractions and certain
controversial decisions were unveiled.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, NCC commissioners Wu Chung-chi and Liu
Kung-chung should be suspended for violating the law requiring
that public functionaries avoid conflicts of interest as well as
the Civil Service Law and the NCC Organic Law, both of which
demand ethical integrity.
</P>
<P>
Pointing out that Liu had hired an in-law and that Wu had hired
his son to serve as their chauffeurs using government-provided
cars, Chen said both of them should be suspended from their jobs
pending further probes by the Control Yuan to determine how much
they should be fined and whether they should be permanently
fired.
</P>
<P>
Chen said the Central Personnel Administration will soon refer
the conflicts of interest cases involving the two NCC
commissioners to the Control Yuan for further investigations.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Chen said, the Executive Yuan will serve a written
admonition to both NCC Chairman Su Yeong-chin and Vice Chairman
Liu Chung-teh as they had signed the official documents endorsing
the two commissioners' illegal hiring of their relatives as
chauffeurs.
</P>
<P>
Chen further said that if NCC commissioners are disgruntled with
the Executive Yuan's sanctions, they can seek remedies in
accordance with the law.
</P>
<P>
The  report  authored  by  a  special  panel  headed  by
Minister-without- Portfolio Hsu Chih-hsiung also outlined several
other major legal transgressions the NCC needs to deal with and
some loose ends it needs to tie up.
</P>
<P>
First of all, the report slammed the NCC for its inaction toward
the notorious "tarred duck" incident involving a controversial
cable TV station, TVBS. The channel broadcast a story late last
year claiming that some local poultry slaughterhouses had used
asphalt to remove duck feathers. The report caused a widespread
health concerns and caused severe slumps in duck sales and
prices. However, the story later turned out to be a false alarm
as laboratory tests showed no trace of the harmful substance. The
NCC has so far not investigated the case nor handed out any
punishment to the TV station.
</P>
<P>
Terming the NCC's inaction as dereliction of duty, the report
demanded that the NCC immediately look into the case and mete out
due penalties.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the report said the NCC's recent punitive measures
toward mishandling and broadcasting of a gangster's video by TVBS
and its affiliated channel TVBS-N were not harsh enough to meet
the public's expectations. It demanded that the NCC renew probes
and hand out punishments accordingly if any new evidence surfaces
about criminal activities behind this case.
</P>
<P>
The report also demanded that the NCC cease operations of its
petition committee which the report termed as "overstepping the
NCC's authority." Since the Executive Yuan has not yet laid out
guidelines for the administrative appeal system involving
independently run organs like the NCC, the report said, the NCC
should not have set up a petition committee to handle appeals
about its disciplinary sanctions. The report said the NCC
petition committee should hand over all relevant files to the
Executive Yuan's Petition Committee within one month.
</P>
<P>
The report also demanded that the NCC get back in two months two
radio frequencies it previously gave to Broadcasting Corp. of
China, which used to be owned by the main opposition Kuomintang
(KMT) and whose properties were partly snatched up by improper
means during the period of KMT authoritarian rule. The retrieval
is in compliance with the principle that radio frequencies are
public assets, the report added.
</P>
<P>
Noting that supervision  of Web site and Web domain name
registration is the duty of the Ministry of Transportation and
Communications, the report said the NCC is not eligible to
formulate relevant rules and therefore should scrap its
preparatory work in this regard.
</P>
<P>
As to moonlighting, the report said the NCC Organic Law has clear
regulations which require NCC commissioners to strictly abide by
the principles  of avoiding  conflicts  of  interest.  Individual
commissioners should quit their moonlighting jobs if they do not
comply with relevant stipulations, it added.
</P>
<P>
While the NCC is screening various license applications or
disciplinary sanctions, the report said, individual commissioners
who have ties with those cases should refrain from joining
discussions or votes in line with the conflict of interest
avoidance principle. As some commissioners failed to follow this
principle previously, the report reminded all members not to
repeat their wrongdoings.
</P>
<P>
In support of the government's crime-fighting campaign, the
report asked the NCC to establish a "telecommunications
figurehead" data bank and pull out all the stops to prevent phone
fraud.
</P>
<P>
The report also blamed the NCC for its recent letters to local
elementary and junior high schools demanding them to allow for
the establishment of mobile phone base stations on their
campuses, which caused a panic among school authorities and
parents. Although the issue has been clarified, the report said,
the NCC should see to it that similar mistakes do happen again.
</P>
<P>
As the Council of Grand Justices  has declared the NCC's
partisan-based formation as unconstitutional and set Dec. 31,
2008 as its  "sunset"  or "closure"  date,  the  report  urged
the opposition-controlled Legislative Yuan to pass amendments to
the NCC Organic Law during its current session to pave the way
for the birth of a new NCC that meets all legal and
constitutional requirements.
</P>
<P>
The current NCC is made up of commissioners recommended by
political parties in proportion to the number of seats they hold
in the legislature.
