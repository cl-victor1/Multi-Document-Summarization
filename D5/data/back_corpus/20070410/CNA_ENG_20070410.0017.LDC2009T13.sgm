</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  April 10 (CNA) 04/10/07  13:00:34 (By Lilian Wu)
</P>
<P>
People First Party (PFP) Chairman James Soong, who went to the
United States shortly after his defeat in the Taipei mayoral
election last December, returned to Taiwan Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Upon his arrival at the Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport, he
was greeted by Wu Poh-hsiung,  who won the Kuomintang  (KMT)
chairmanship by-election last Saturday, KMT Secretary-General Wu
Den-yih, Deputy Legislative Speaker Chung Jung-chi, PFP
legislators as well as Soong's supporters.
</P>
<P>
Soong said that there are many issues that require cooperation
and consultations between the KMT and the PFP and that the two
parties will communicate with each other on these issues.
</P>
<P>
Soong gave a low-key response when asked about political issues,
especially about questions concerning a possible presidential
ticket of former KMT Chairman Ma Ying-jeou and Legislative
Speaker Wang Jin-pyng, or a Wang-Ma ticket.
</P>
<P>
PFP spokesman Lee Hung-chun said that Soong talked with Wu for 20
minutes, touching on Taiwan's current situation and the future
direction of cooperation between the two parties.
</P>
<P>
On whom Soong will support in the 2008 presidential election, Lee
said Soong is friends with both Wang and Ma and that it is not
appropriate to talk about the question now, adding that the only
consensus is to win the election next year through cooperation
between the two parties. Wu also refrained from talking about the
matter.
</P>
<P>
Wang had wanted to come to greet Soong, but couldn't come because
of his especially tight schedule Tuesday, Lee said.
</P>
<P>
More than 50 supporters quarreled with aviation police briefly
after the latter tried to stop them from unfurling red banners to
welcome Soong. Police later moved back to avoid a possible clash.
