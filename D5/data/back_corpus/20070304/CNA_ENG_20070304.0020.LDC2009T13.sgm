Singapore  Airlines  may reopen the Singapore-Kaohsiung route,
closed in 2003 during the severe acute respiratory syndrome
(SARS) crisis, reliable sources in Taiwan's tourism circle said
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The sources indicated that Singapore Airlines is likely to resume
its air service between Singapore and the southern Taiwan port
city of Kaohsiung in May.
</P>
<P>
Singapore Airlines' Taipei office confirmed that the airline is
working on such a plan after its recent assessment has
established that a market demand for its Singapore-Kaohsiung
route does exist at present, although the air route is currently
served by two of Taiwan's airlines -- China Airlines and EVA
Airways.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the airline said that the plan has not been
finalized yet and that his company will not rule out the
possibility of asking SilkAir, the regional wing of Singapore
Airlines, to fly the route.
</P>
<P>
SilkAir, based in Singapore, is a wholly owned subsidiary of
Singapore Airlines and operates scheduled passenger services from
Singapore to 25 cities in Southeast Asia, South Asia and China.
</P>
<P>
Singapore Airlines canceled its air route from Kaohsiung to
Singapore on April 15, 2003 when the SARS outbreak dealt a
serious blow to its business. Poor passenger loads forced the
airline to close its 11-member office in Kaohsiung and withdrew
from the southern Taiwan market.
