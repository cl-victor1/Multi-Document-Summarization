DPP GOVERNS COUNTRY WITH SLOGANS: FORMER PRESIDENT
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

Taipei, March 4 (CNA) 03/04/07  16:27:21 (By Deborah Kuo)

<P>
Former President Lee Teng-hui lambasted the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) Sunday for just paying lip service to the
cause of constitutional re- engineering despite having promised
to do so, claiming the move indicating that the DPP is "ruling
the country with empty slogans."
</P>
<P>
In a keynote speech delivered at a forum on the difficulties and
breakthroughs surrounding re-engineering of the Constitution, Lee
said Taiwan's constitutional re-engineering that began in 1991
has not yet been completed following six rounds of amendments to
the Constitution during his presidency. "When the DPP came to
power in 2000, we all hoped that the DPP could continue carrying
it through, " Lee recalled.
</P>
<P>
To the country's chagrin, Lee said, President Chen Shui-bian did
not make constitutional  re-engineering a top priority of his
administration. Instead, he said, Chen spelled out a "five noes"
pledge in his first-term inaugural speech out of fear of ruffling
the feathers of the United States.
</P>
<P>
Chen pledged in his 2000 inaugural address that as long as
Beijing had no intention of using military force against Taiwan,
during his time in office, he would not declare independence, not
change Taiwan's name, not add the state-to- state theory to the
Constitution, not promote a referendum on the independence versus
unification  issue,  and  not scrap  the National  Unification
Guidelines--  positions collectively  known as the "five noes"
doctrine.
</P>
<P>
Lee said Chen has put forth plans promising  that a new
Constitution will be written in 2006 to pave the way for its
implementation in 2008.
</P>
<P>
The 2008 implementation, however, is highly doubtful given that
there are no concrete measures in sight, Lee claimed.
</P>
<P>
On the seventh round of constitutional amendments, which was led
by the DPP, Lee said the authors set prohibitively high
conditions for any amendment to the Constitution, which has made
it almost impossible to change the country's official
designation.
</P>
<P>
The forum was co-sponsored by the Washington-based Formosan
Association for Public Affairs (FAPA) and the Taiwan Advocates, a
local private think-tank.
