DPP OBJECTS LEE'S CRITICISM OVER CONSTITUTION REFORM
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  March 4 (CNA) 03/04/07  18:30:49 (By Y.C. Jou)
</P>
<P>
The ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) Sunday objected to
former President Lee Teng-hui's accusation that the party has
failed to establish a new Constitution, saying Lee himself did
little of what he asks of President Chen Shui-bian during his 12
years in office.
</P>
<P>
The DPP understands that Lee was unable to move forward on some
issues while president due to Taiwan's special predicament, and
Lee should similarly understand the position of the DPP, said
Wang To, DPP's legislature caucus whip.
</P>
<P>
Lee in a speech earlier that day said the 2005 amendment to the
Constitution, a move he called a carve-up by the DPP and major
opposition Kuomintang, has made future change more difficult and
thus blocked the way toward a name rectification of Taiwan and
the establishment of a new Constitution.
</P>
<P>
He also said that Chen's "Five Noes" pledge at his 2000
inauguration crippled any effort during his terms to bring in a
Taiwan Constitution.
</P>
<P>
Wang, however, said Lee during his 12-year rule had sufficient
power to do what he now asks of Chen, adding that Chen's
situation is a hundred times" more difficult than that of Lee,
whose party at least controlled the majority in the legislature,
an advantage Chen does not enjoy.
</P>
<P>
Meng Yi-chao, Director of the DPP's Department of Culture and
Information, also said Lee's commentwas not objective.
</P>
<P>
Meng said the ruling party has made great efforts in the study of
the Constitution reform issue in the hopes of making the issue a
matter of the people rather than of political parties.
