DPP CAUCUS BACKS ENACTING RULES ON DEMOCRACY MEMORIAL HALL
MANAGEMENT

Taipei,  March  4 (CNA) 03/04/07  16:59:06 (By Luis Huang)

The legislative caucus of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) will support the Ministry of Education (MOE) should it
formulate a draft law governing management of a planned "National
Taiwan Democracy Memorial Hall", a DPP legislative caucus whip
said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Wang Hsing-nan made the remarks in response to a report in
Taipei's China Times daily that the MOE will establish a set of
organizational rules for the "Taiwan Democracy Memorial Hall",
which is the new designation for the Chiang Kai-shek Memorial
Hall, and will then ask the Legislative Yuan to abolish the
existing "Organic Statutes for Management of the Chiang Kai-shek
Memorial Hall."
</P>
<P>
An MOE official announced a day earlier that the Chiang Kai-shek
Memorial Hall, located in downtown Taipei, will be re-named
"Taiwan Democracy Memorial Hall" according to a resolution
adopted at a supra-ministerial meeting, while the memorial hall
complex which also accommodates the National Theater and the
National Concert Hall will be transformed into a "Taiwan
Democracy Park."
</P>
<P>
The official also said that a supra-ministerial  landscape
planning task force will be set up to conduct space planning and
that a report will be presented in one month's time for the
government to decide whether or not to demolish the wall
surrounding the memorial hall.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the government should use a new paradigm to handle
the memorial hall issue, Wang said that since the authoritarian
era was over, the wall symbolizing the authoritarianism should be
dismantled to help transform the memorial hall into a more
democratic park, like Central Park in New York.
</P>
<P>
The DPP proposed that the name of Chiang Kai-shek Memorial Hall
be changed to "Taiwan Democracy Memorial Hall, " in an effort to
eliminate symbols of the authoritarianism associated with the
late President Chiang Kai-shek, considered a key perpetrator of
the 228 Incident of 1947, in which many elite members of local
society were killed.
