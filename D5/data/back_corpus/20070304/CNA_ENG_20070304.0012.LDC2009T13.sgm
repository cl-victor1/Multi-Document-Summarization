The 2007 Taipei International Machine Tool Show will be held
March 12-17 at the Taipei World Trade Center under the auspices
of the quasi-official Taiwan External Trade Development Council
(TAITRA) and the Taiwan Association of Machinery Industry.
</P>
<P>
According to a TAITRA official, the biennial trade show is
expected to bring together some 700 domestic and foreign
machinery manufacturers who will set up a total of 2,760 booths
to exhibit their latest products, both hitting historic highs.
</P>
<P>
To help domestic manufacturers tap foreign emerging markets,
TAITRA has invited major machinery import agents from seven
nations -- Russia, Brazil, South Africa, Malaysia, Japan and
Turkey -- to procure locally-made machine tools during the
exhibition,  the official said.
</P>
<P>
A series of presentations on the seven nations' machine tool
markets will be held March 12-13 to give domestic manufacturers a
better understanding of local market demands, the official said,
adding that following the presentations, TAITRA will arrange for
domestic machine tool manufacturers to hold face-to-face talks
with foreign agents March 13-14 to promote their products.
</P>
<P>
As Taiwan is the world's fourth-largest machine tool exporting
country, trailing behind only Japan, Germany and Italy, the trade
show has always drawn attention from the international business
community, the official explained.
</P>
<P>
Among the product lines to be featured at the six-day show will
be CNC machine tools, metal cutting machines, metal forming
machines, as well as foundry, forging, welding and cutting
equipment and machine tool parts and accessories.
</P>
<P>
To attract the attention of foreign buyers and boost sales,
leading Taiwanese manufacturers in this line such as Tong-Tai
Machine and Tools Co., Yeong Chin Machinery Co., She Hong
Machinery Co., Chin Fong Machinery Co., Far East Machinery Co.,
and Ching Hung Machinery Co. will showcase their newly-developed
precision machine tools at the show.
