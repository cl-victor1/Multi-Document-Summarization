12-YEAR COMPULSORY EDUCATION SHOULD NOT BE POLITICAL PRODUCT:
PARENTS

Taipei,   March  4  (CNA) 03/04/07  17:40:19 (By Deborah Kuo)

Parental representatives said at a colloquium Sunday that the
12-year compulsory educational system should not be a product of
politics, nor should the program be implemented as a "favor"
granted by the government or any political party.
</P>
<P>
Premier Su Tseng-chang promoted a 12-year educational system last
week soon after he announced his bid to seek the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party's nomination for the 2008
presidential race.
</P>
<P>
Immediately afterwards the Ministry of Education unveiled the
framework of a plan to implement the 12-year compulsory
educational system, prolonged from nine years, in 2009 with an
aim of increasing national competitiveness.
</P>
<P>
Chen Hung-chien, an executive with the Confederation of Parents
Teachers Associations (PTA) in Taipei County, said at the
colloquium sponsored by the Republic of China Educational Reform
Association that he would feel sorry, even saddened, should the
government push for the 12-year education system due to political
considerations rather than regard for the students' and parents'
interests.
</P>
<P>
Wang Shu-chuan, a leader in the PTA community in Nantou County,
said all parents of students aged under 18 are concerned about
the implementation of a 12-year education system, and hope that
this program is not merely a vote-winning slogan or scheme.
</P>
<P>
Hsueh Shu-mei, a PTA representative from Chiayi County, said she
worries that the 12-year educational system may result in a
"haste make waste" program if implemented haphazardly to meet an
artificial deadline imposed by the 2008 presidential election.
</P>
<P>
Hsueh argued that the extended compulsory educational system
should not be a "favor" granted by the government or specific
political party. Rather, she said, it should be pushed by the
private sector and endorsed by the government. Only by doing that
way, she added, can the program be carried out sustainably,
regardless of which party is ruling the country.
</P>
<P>
Also speaking at the meeting, Ting Chih-jen, chairman of the ROC
Educational Reform Association, said at least one year should be
spent discussing the issue and related details before a final
decision is reached on the implementation of a 12-year compulsory
educational system.
</P>
<P>
The government should also adjust "key points" involving the
issue during future discussions, Ting said, adding that financing
and curricula should be core elements of the issue, followed by
concerns over catchment areas and enrollment.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile,  participants  resolved to establish  a private,
nationwide 12-year compulsory educational system promotion
alliance to serve as a window through which to engage in dialogue
with the government on the issue.
