The Ministry of Education, which unveiled Friday the framework of
a plan to implement a 12-year compulsory educational system in
2009, again issued a position paper on the policy Sunday.

The position paper states that before July 2009, except for some
contingent measures, the modes of high school entrance, including
high school entrance exams, will remain unchanged.

Those contingent measures to be implemented during the three-year
preparation period include  an expanded  subsidy  program for
less-privileged students and exam-free entrance for certain
students to study in specific departments, according to the
position paper.

Other vital issues, including how students will be admitted into
senior high schools, will be discussed at a later date at least
one year from now, said Minister of Education Tu Cheng-sheng.
