Chambers of Commerce in Asia, which is expected to be attended by

Prior to his departure, Wang remained tight-lipped on issues
regarding the possibility of his pairing up with Ma Ying-jeou,
the opposition Kuomintang (KMT) presidential candidate, to run in
the 2008 presidential election.

Wang, a KMT heavyweight, said he will give an answer after his
return from Malaysia,  adding that it will be clear-cut  and
unequivocal.

In response to inquires from the media regarding the chances of
his meeting with Ma, Wang said he would first have to meet KMT
Chairman Wu Po-hsiung before making an appointment with Ma.
