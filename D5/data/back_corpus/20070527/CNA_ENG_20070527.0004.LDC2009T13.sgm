Vice President Annette Lu came to the defense of President Chen
Shui-bian's diplomacy Saturday, branding the president's critics
as being fooled by Beijing.
</P>
<P>
She made the comment in response to a criticism made by cultural
commentator Lung Ying-tai in a forum sponsored by a foundation
set up by Lung.
</P>
<P>
Lung claimed during the forum that President Chen Shui-bian's
diplomacy was mainly formulated to cater for his political
followers at home and can hardly sell to the international
community, adding that his diplomatic bungles earned the
president the bad name of trouble maker.
</P>
<P>
Lung was referring to the president's decision to bid for
membership for the country in the World Health Organization under
the name of Taiwan only to be turned down by that international
health body on May 14.  Lu rebutted Lung's view by arguing that
it is the international community rather than President Chen
should be blamed , because the international community are giving
sympathetic ear to Beijing which has pulled out all the stops to
shut Taiwan out of international organizations.
</P>
<P>
As to Lung's criticism that Chen conducted diplomacy with the aim
to please  his domestic  supporters  without  regard  for the
international political reality, Lu said the truth is just the
opposite, warning the president's critics not to poke fun at him
because in the face of China's attempts to isolate Taiwan, there
is no choices but to stand up against Beijing.
</P>
<P>
She urged the public to point the finger at Beijing rather than
the president for Taiwan's diplomatic setbacks.
