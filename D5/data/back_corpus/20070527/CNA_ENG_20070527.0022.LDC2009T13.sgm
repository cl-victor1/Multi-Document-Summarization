The party primary of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) for the year- end legislative elections is already over,
but former members of the disbanded New Tide Faction who have
fallen into disfavor are still incensed about the way they were
treated by the party's central leadership.
</P>
<P>
DPP Deputy Secretary-General Tsai Huang-liang said Sunday that
the DPP might summon candidates who lost in the party primary to
run for legislative  seats in "tough electoral zones" and that a
nine-member committee will meet soon to consult hopefuls.
</P>
<P>
DPP Chairman Yu Shyh-kun endorsed the plan, saying that no-one
will be ruled out.
</P>
<P>
Asked how they will respond if the party leadership decides to
summon them to run in "tough electoral zones" where the odds are
against DPP candidates, at least four of the "11 nemeses" within
the DPP reacted with indifference or made sarcastic remarks.
</P>
<P>
Of the 11 nemeses -- reform-minded former members of the New Tide
Faction who dare to criticise the party's policies -- all but one
failed to be nominated to run for a legislative seat.
</P>
<P>
DPP Legislator Cheng Yun-peng said the party should summon DPP
Secretary-General Lin Chia-lung to run in a tough district
because of his "high caliber, competence and consistent political
correctness."
</P>
<P>
Cheng had lambasted Lin a week earlier for calling former New
Tide faction members defeated in the primary "opportunists."
</P>
<P>
Cheng said those who were branded as opportunists are unfit to be
nominees in tough districts.
</P>
<P>
"If we lose, we will be blamed for not having enough voter
support. And if we win, the credit will go to the party central
because of its successful strategy," he said.
</P>
<P>
Lin Cho-shui, a former DPP legislator-at-large who resigned from
the legislature in November last year over the corruption scandal
involving the first family, also said the DPP should summon party
members who are not opportunists, adding that Lin would be an
ideal choice.
</P>
<P>
Legislator  Shen Fa-hui criticized the DPP leadership  for
conducting opinion polls for the primary in such a way as to
exclude all supporters of the opposition Kuomintang and its "pan-
blue alliance" partner -- the People First Party.
</P>
<P>
Shen and another DPP legislator, Hsiao Bi-khim, who was the
victim of a smear campaign during the party primary, both
questioned why the DPP would want to summon opportunists to run
against KMT nominees in the year-end election if the party
leadership believes they have deviated from the DPP's core
values.
