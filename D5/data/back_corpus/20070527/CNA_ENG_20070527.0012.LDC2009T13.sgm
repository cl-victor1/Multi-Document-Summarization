</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  May 27 (CNA) 05/27/07  16:16:17 (By Deborah Kuo)

President Chen Shui-bian instructed the Coast Guard
Administration (CGA) Sunday to build itself into a "three-
dimensional" coast guard force to upgrade its ability to
safeguard security and maintain order along the nation's
coastlines and offshore areas.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the opening of a maritime anti-hijack drill held at
the eastern fishing port of Suao and arranged by the CGA, Chen
said that in order to cope with the changing coastal crime
situation, the CGA should continue to acquire large displacement
patrol craft, equip them with cutting-edge monitoring gear and
cooperate with airborne rescue and surveillance operations run by
the Ministry of the Interior.
</P>
<P>
Chen said Sunday's  Haian drill,  designed  from a global anti-
terrorism perspective, was mainly aimed at examining the coast
guard's preparedness to deal with contingencies and honing its
response capabilities to handle situations such as fishing boat
hijacks.
</P>
<P>
As Taiwan is bounded by the Taiwan Strait on one side and the
Pacific Ocean on the other, Chen said, nearly all the country's
matters, regardless of whether they involve national security,
economic development  or daily activities of the public,  are
inextricably connected with the ocean. Thus, maritime affairs and
related developments are one of the major areas that the
government has strived to attend to, he added.
</P>
<P>
Chen praised the CGA for its commendable performance since Wang
Chin-wang assumed his post as the CGA head in January.
</P>
<P>
In a sweeping operation codenamed Anhai, which has been conducted
since March, he said, a total of 134 smuggled handguns, 86
modified firearms and nearly 20,000 rounds of ammunition, as well
as some 900 kg of illicit narcotics, have been seized.
</P>
<P>
In addition, he went on, in another sweeping operation codenamed
Ankang that was conducted by the CGA, the Council of Agriculture
and other Cabinet-level agencies between November 2006 and March
this year, a total of 557 tons of smuggled agricultural products,
700 tons of fishery products, some 5 million packs of cigarettes
and over 7,600 head of livestock were confiscated and destroyed.
</P>
<P>
Sunday's drill involved 27 patrol craft, three helicopters and
780 CGA officers and crew who demonstrated the coast guard
force's abilities in operations concerning maritime hijacking,
emergency rescue at sea and protection of the marine environment.
