Kinmen coast guard officials said Sunday that they had nabbed a
Chinese boat that was engaging in illegal sea sand dredging off
the Taiwan-held outlying island.
</P>
<P>
A total of 10 Chinese suspects were arrested, the officials
noted.
</P>
<P>
The arrests came just a week after the officials caught another
Chinese ship doing the same thing in Kinmen waters, the officials
went on.

<P>
The dredging destroys the ecological landscape, posing a threat
to ocean creatures and other boats, the officials said, adding
that they will continue the crackdown to protect the area's
natural resources.
