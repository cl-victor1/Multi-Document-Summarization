LEGISLATIVE SPEAKER, ACADEMICS DISCUSS MIXED ELECTORAL SYSTEM
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  May 26 (CNA) 05/27/07  11:07:11 (By Chris Wang)

With a new mixed electoral system being adopted in Taiwan's
forthcoming legislative election, Legislative Yuan speaker Wang
Jin-pyng and academics from Taiwan, Japan and South Korea offered
various views on the system in a symposium Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The impact of the new system remain to be seen, but the election
reform has been the consensus of all parties and there is no
turning back, said Wang in "International Symposium on Mixed
Electoral Systems in East Asia, " which was organized by Election
Study Center of National Chengchi University.
</P>
<P>
It is sometimes difficult -- and not too difficult at the same
time -- to imagine what a different electoral system would impact
the political arena, said Yoshiaki Kobayashi, a professor at
Japan's Keio University, in a keynote speech.
</P>
<P>
Citing the U.S. 2000 presidential election as an example,
Kobayashi said that if Al Gore, who garnered more popular votes
but less electoral votes than the eventual winner George Bush,
were to be elected the U.S. president, a reasonable speculation
was that the world politics and the way U.S. countered terrorism
after the 911 attacks would have been different.
</P>
<P>
The new "single-member districts, two vote system" is expected to
change the legislative "ecology" and possibly Taiwan's politics,
although there is no telling whether it will be a change for the
better or worse, Wang said.
</P>
<P>
It is generally agreed that the mixed electoral system Japan and
Taiwan adopted favors a two-party politics and will facilitate
political debate, said Kobayashi, who also serves as the
president of Japan Political Science Association.
</P>
<P>
However, 10 years after Japan adopted the new system, the results
have been mixed as some legislators didn't think the mixed voting
system helpful, Kobayashi said.
</P>
<P>
"One thing is sure after the system change, which is that the
legislators have to spend more time in their respective district
because that is where the votes came from, " Wang said.
</P>
<P>
Spending more time in local districts is both good and bad, Wang
elaborated, as attendance record of legislators may drop
dramatically in future legislative session.
</P>
<P>
Professors from Taiwan, Japan and South Korea submitted theses in
the one-day symposium and discussed on a wide range of issues
including the impact of electoral system change, the review of
Taiwan's redistricting, changes and continuity in voting behavior
after the electoral system change.
