A five-year-old boy in northern Hsinchu City died from
enterovirus infection Sunday, marking Taiwan's first and only
enterovirus-related fatality in 2006, officials from the Center
for Disease Control (CDC) under the Cabinet-level Department of
Health said Monday.
</P>
<P>
The victim began displaying symptoms of enterovirus infection
Dec. 27 and died three days later, the officials said, adding
that currently, the boy's sister and his kindergarten classmates
are in good shape.

In 2006, a total of 47 suspected enterovirus cases were reported,
with 12 confirmed cases and one fatality, the CDC officials said.
This marked a drop from the previous year when 142 cases were
reported with 16 deaths.
</P>
<P>
Children  under the age of five are at greatest risk of
enterovirus infection and of dying after being infected. They
account for more than 90 percent of the serious enterovirus cases
in Taiwan, with the death rate among those infected in this age
group ranging between 10 percent and 25.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
The officials pointed out that it is currently not the peak
season for enterovirus. However, they added that due to the warm
weather this winter, a victim's condition can worsen very fast.
</P>
<P>
If children have been diagnosed with enterovirus infection by a
doctor and begin to display symptoms, such as decreased activity,
persistent vomiting and fever, irritability, neck stiffness, limb
paralysis, convulsions, shortness of breath, increased heart
rate, or irregular pulse, they should seek medical help
immediately, the officials said.
