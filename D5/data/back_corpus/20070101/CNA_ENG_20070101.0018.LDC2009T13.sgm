technology products, said experts at the Institute of Economics

down, emerging markets will see a huge demand for technology
products, which will benefit Taiwan's PC, TFT-LCD, and
communications industries, which have each reached NT$1 trillion
in production value, the experts said.

Chris Wei, an analyst at the Market Intelligence Center (MIC) ,
said that the market for personal computers in the emerging
markets -- especially Brazil, Russia, India and China -- is
growing rapidly due to these countries' rising gross domestic
product (GDP) , population and consumer power, as well as the
popularity of related information products.

launched many projects as part of efforts to boost the economy

personal computer markets.

for a year-on- year increase of 6.2 percent, with the figure
likely to hit 144.98 million for 2007, Wei said. adding that this

than 80 percent of the world's personal computers.

Research Institute's (ITRI's) Industrial Economics and Knowledge
Center, said that in 2006, Taiwan was the world's top producer of
TFT-LCD panels, enjoying a 47.9 percent share of the global
market, followed by South Korea with 40.1 percent.

TFT-LCD panels are commonly used in notebook computers, liquid
crystal monitors, and flat panel television sets.

Chung noted that the total production volume of the world's large
TFT-LCD panels in 2006 increased 25 percent to reach 260 million.
It is projected that, this year, the total production volume will
reach 310 million, he said.

communications industry is estimated to surpass NT$7 trillion in
2006, posting a record growth rate of 43 percent, with the
industry forecast to grow a further 13 percent in 2007.
