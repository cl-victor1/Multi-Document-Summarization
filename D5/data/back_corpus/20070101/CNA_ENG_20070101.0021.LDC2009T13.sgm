Taipei, Jan. 1 (CNA) 01/01/07  17:51:44 (By Deborah Kuo)

<P>
President Chen Shui-bian visited the wife of Taichung Mayor Jason
Hu again Monday, who has been gradually recovering after emerging
from an 18-day coma since a car crash last Nov. 18.
</P>
<P>
It marked the second time Chen had visited Shirley Shao -- whose
husband is an opposition Kuomintang heavyweight and a former
foreign minister -- since the crash occurred on a southern Taiwan
freeway that left Shao in critical condition on the verge of
death.
</P>
<P>
At Shao's sickbed at China Medical University Hospital (CMUH) in
Taichung City, central Taiwan, Chen shook hands with Shao and
said she was doing commendably well. For her part, Shao said "How
are you, Mr. President, " and "thank you and sorry for causing
the trouble" to Chen, according to CMUH Vice President Cheng
Lung-pin.
</P>
<P>
Chen visited the Hus after he took a ride on Taiwan's first
"bullet train" from Panchiao, northern Taiwan, to the central
township of Wujih, where he awarded a plaque for the Taiwan High
Speed Railway's inaugural train.
</P>
<P>
According to Cheng, Shao was admitted to the CMUH from the Chi
Mei Medical Center in Tainan County three weeks ago and is now
able to walk several steps by herself and ate a few slices of
sashimi on New Year's eve Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Hu, who was only slightly injured in the accident, and Shao were
returning from a stumping trip to Kaohsiung when their minivan
was hit by another vehicle on the freeway that lost control after
trying to overtake Hu's van on the hard shoulder.
</P>
<P>
Doctors at the Liuying branch of Chi Mei Medical Center removed
Shao's ruptured spleen and amputated her left forearm in two
separate procedures.
</P>
<P>
Her heart stopped beating twice during the first operation and
cardiac message had to be applied to revive her. She lost a large
amount of blood and needed a transfusion of 13,000 c.c.
</P>
<P>
Shao had acute breathing difficulty after the two operations and
doctors were worried that she might suffer multiple organ
failure.
