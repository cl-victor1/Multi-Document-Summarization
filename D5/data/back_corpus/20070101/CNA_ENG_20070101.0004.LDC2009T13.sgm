<P>
Taipei, Jan. 1 (CNA) 01/01/07  12:06:06
</P>
<P>
Following is the full text of President Chen Shui-bian's  New
Year Message posted on the Web site of the Presidential Office
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Vice President Lu, Respected Colleagues, Distinguished Guests,
and Fellow Citizens:
</P>
<P>
Happy New Year and greetings to you all!
</P>
<P>
Today we welcome the beginning of a new yearXthe ninety-sixth
year of the Republic of China (Taiwan). As we make a brand new
start, let us take to heart, with humility and sincerity, the
fond hopes of our fellow citizens, and steadfastly striveXwith
pragmatismXto ensure greater well-being for all our people.
</P>
<P>
At the time of the new year countdown a few hours ago,
accompanied by the blessing of splendorous fireworks shooting
forth from the world's tallest buildingXTaipei 101, and with
confidence, pride, and high expectations of ourselves as members
of the global village, we 23 million Taiwanese joined with our
more than 6 billion fellow human beings around the world in
welcoming the arrival of 2007, and in praying that the whole of
humanity will be able to enjoy greater peace, prosperity, and
justice in the coming year.
</P>
<P>
For more than half a century, due to political confrontations
between the Eastern and Western Blocs during the Cold War era,
and because of the longstanding insistence of previous leaders of
Taiwan on defending the myth of "one China, " Taiwan's national
status and path of development have continually been confined
within the narrow and illusory framework of "one China" and
"unification with China."
</P>
<P>
Be it the former Kuomintang government's resolve, soon after
relocating to Taiwan, to counterattack and recover the mainland
or, later, its vow to unify China under the Three Principles of
the People, its creation of the Guidelines for National
Unification, its talk about a so-called 1992 Consensus, or its
espousal of an "ultimate unification" dictumXin essence, it all
presumes that unification is the only possible option for our
future. This mindset not only deprives Taiwan's people of their
freedom of choice, but also contravenes the fundamental principle
of "sovereignty lies in the people."
</P>
<P>
In 2000, we witnessed the alternation of governing parties and
peaceful transfer of political power. In 2003, we enacted the
Referendum Act. In 2004, we conducted the first national
referendum. In 2005, we enacted constitutional revisions whereby
the National Assembly was abolished and its power to ratify
constitutional amendments was transferred to the people through
exercising the right of referendum. On February 28, 2006, I
declared that the National Unification Council had ceased to
function, and the Guidelines for National Unification had ceased
to apply.
</P>
<P>
Although each of these steps in our ongoing democratization was
fraught with difficulty and encountered pressure and resistance
from many quarters, we held firm to our faith in democracy. We
insisted on returning to the peopleXfullyXtheir right to
determine our nation's destiny. At the same time, this process
spurred us to constantly reflect on our national identity  and
how we should position ourselves.
</P>
<P>
In June 2000, shortly after I assumed the presidency, an opinion
poll on national identity indicated that 36.9 percent of
respondents considered themselves Taiwanese and 13.1 percent
Chinese, while another 43.8 percent thought of themselves as both
Taiwanese and Chinese. By contrast, a survey on national identity
published in November 2006 by the Election Study Center of
National Chengchi University revealed that the percentage of the
respondents who consider themselves Taiwanese has risen to 60.1
percent, while the proportion of those who think of themselves as
Chinese has dropped to 4.8 percent, and those who identify
themselves as both Taiwanese and Chinese stands at 33.4 percent.
Thus, in the short span of six years, we have seen a very clear
change in the people's thinking.
</P>
<P>
A public opinion survey released by the Mainland Affairs Council
showed that, as of September 2006, 75.8 percent of respondents
supported the government's ongoing efforts to promote Taiwan's
participation in the United Nations, and over 70 percent approved
of applying for UN membership under the name Taiwan. This
demonstrates that Taiwan-centric consciousness, based on the core
value of putting Taiwan first, is coming into full bloom.
</P>
<P>
The international community must forthrightly pay heed to the
will of Taiwan's people, and must respect their right of free
choice. More importantly, based on their ardent love for this
land and their unwavering faith in the universal values of
freedom, democracy, human rights, and peace, and rooted in the
spirit of their common struggle over the past half-century to
survive and flourish, the people of Taiwan  must endeavor  to
transcend  boundaries  of ethnicity, partisanship, and political
interests, and persist in working to coalesce and galvanize their
awareness of their identity as a national community.
</P>
<P>
Once again, it must be emphasized and reiterated that: Our
country, Taiwan, has a total land area of 36,000 square
kilometers. The sovereignty of Taiwan belongs to its 23 million
people, not to the People's Republic of China. Only the people of
Taiwan have the right to decide Taiwan's future. Meanwhile,
Taiwan is a part of the world, not a part of China. Taiwan's
overall national goals must not become dislocated from the
world's development and transformation. Our formulation of
national policies must rise above the cramped framework of "one
China" and cross-strait relations. We must keep an expansive
vision and understand issues in their broader context, so that we
may affirm the rightful status and unique persona of Taiwan in
the global political and economic arenas, and vigorously pursue
the creation of a sound foundation for our sustainable
development.
</P>
<P>
The 21st century is a century of globalization. As an oceanic
nation whose development hinges on international trade, Taiwan
cannot afford to distance itself from the world trends, and
should clearly identify the opportunities and challenges of
globalization.
</P>
<P>
On this day five years ago, Taiwan officially joined the World
Trade Organization as its 144th member, opening the world's
markets to us and our market to the world. Although this greatly
expanded our room for development, it also brought unprecedented
competitive pressure.
</P>
<P>
In step with the fast-paced development of the knowledge-based
economy, Taiwan's industrial structure has been undergoing
constant metamorphoses and upgrading. This, in turn, has
contributed to a widening gap between rich and poor as well as
between urban and rural areas.  In the globalization  race,
Taiwan  needs world-class enterprises to compete, but it must
also give due attention to the dangers of concentration of wealth
and the formation of monopolies by financial conglomerates.
</P>
<P>
Following China's economic reforms, Taiwanese businesses have
taken advantage of China's inexpensive land and labor to spur
their growth. At the same time, however, this has accelerated the
hollowing-out of industries, stagnation of salaries, and
structural unemployment in Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Candidly speaking, Taiwan's society has been under a cloud of
social tension and confrontation for the past six years. In part,
this is attributable to the fact that the ruling and opposition
parties have not grown accustomed to their reversal of roles, as
well as to the inadequacy of our current Constitution, which have
caused the machinery of government to spin its wheels and social
resources wasted. More fundamentally, however, it reflects the
cumulative dilemmas and conflicts that have accompanied Taiwan's
efforts to deal with the challenges of globalization.
</P>
<P>
How do we strike the right balance between opportunities and
challenges, prosperity and fairness, investment and employment,
and economic integration versus greater economic autonomy? I
believe that no one has the final answer to this question. Nor
can the right balance be achieved by drawing simplistic
dichotomies  between pan-blue  versus  pan-green  camps,  pro-
unification versus pro-independence ideologies,  or strategies of
greater economic liberalization versus increased restrictions.
The dilemmas we are facing, after all, are new to both the
government and the people of Taiwan. All of us are continuously
learning, groping, and refining our approaches.
</P>
<P>
In my 2006 New Year message,  I declared that "proactive
management and effective liberalization" would be the new guiding
principle and course of action for cross-strait economic and
trade policymaking. Examining our economic performance over the
ensuing year, we have indeed done rather well.
</P>
<P>
For example, export volume and orders set new records, with their
combined value in September 2006 exceeding the US$20 billion mark
for the first time in a single month. The employment situation
also steadily improved, with an average unemployment rate
tabulated at less than 4 percent. Our foreign exchange reservesXa
symbol of our collective wealth and the global business
community's confidence in TaiwanXgrew nearly threefold between
2000 and the end of November 2006, increasing from US$106.7
billion to US$265.1 billion. On the last trading day of last
year, the Taiwan Stock Exchange reached its highest mark since
August 5, 2000, while an increasing number of overseas capital
investment institutions have expressed confidence that it is not
unrealistic to expect the TAIEX to rise to 10,000 points within
one or two years.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, a survey conducted at the end of December 2006
indicated that 49.7 percent of respondents believed that
regulations concerning China-bound investment should be
tightened. About 56.7 percent of respondents were of the view
that unless there is a society-wide consensus to the contrary,
the government should not further relax restrictions  on cross-
strait economic and trade relations.
</P>
<P>
As such concrete data demonstrate, whether judged in terms of
economic performance or public opinions, the government's
insistence on its cross-strait trade policies meets the
expectations of the majority of our people. The government has
worked single-mindedly to implement  its cross-strait  trade
policies,  which Premier Su Tseng-chang has also followed instead
of sought to adjust, as some speculations suggested.
</P>
<P>
In a pluralistic democratic society such as ours, where a
diversity of groups and businesses play different roles and have
different interests, not everyone shares the same views regarding
the direction of economic and trade development. The government's
responsibility is to harmonize differences and disputes, and to
formulate policies that are acceptable to the greatest possible
majority of the people. While the results of such efforts may not
satisfy everyone, I believe that if we can all be a bit less
partisan, take the people's well-being a bit more to heart,
indulge a bit less in argumentation, and show a bit more
solidarity, we surely can lay a broader foundation for our
national development. Given hard work and determination, Taiwan
will certainly not be marginalized, and its overall performance
over the coming year will be even better than last year.
</P>
<P>
Looking toward the future, the government shall persist in
adhering to its two main pillars of governanceXinsisting  on
Taiwan-centric consciousness and achieving social equity and
justice. We will strive to achieve the four major goals of
increasing investment in Taiwan, creating employment
opportunities, narrowing the urban-rural divide, and reducing
income disparities.
</P>
<P>
The government is committed to promoting sustainable economic
development. We have proactively worked to attract China-based
Taiwanese businesspeople to reinvest in Taiwan so as to buttress
the foundation for national development. We will also speed up
tax reform to  create  an  internationally  competitive  tax
environment. Furthermore, we have taken measures to revitalize
the stock market in order to increase momentum to local capital
markets. In order to create a more favorable investment and
business environment for Taiwan, we continue to promote the
development of and investment in up-and-coming industrial bases
such as the Hsinchu Science Park, Central Taiwan Science Park,
and Southern Taiwan Science Park. Meanwhile,  we will accelerate
the development of the special commercial zones associated with
the five major stations along the high-speed railway, guided by a
philosophy of clustering businesses with distinctive local
characteristics.
</P>
<P>
This government is also investing in technological innovation and
research  and development.  Recent  data indicate  that  total
expenditures on research and development in 2005 reached 2.52
percent of our GDP, bringing us closer to the government's target
of 3 percent.  We continue to promote industrial diversification
by augmenting programs to foster the development of a thirdXor
even fourthXtrillion-dollar  industry [referring  to the New
Taiwan dollar]. Moreover, we will push for the enactment of an
improved renewable energy act at the earliest possible date as
part of the efforts to boost the production value of "green"
businesses to reach NT$150 billion [more than US$4.5 billion] in
2009. In addition, we will more aggressively develop broadband
Internet access, with the goal of increasing the rate of
broadband users to 40 percent of the population.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, this government is determined to promote social equity
and justice. We have been taking forceful action to implement
programs to help underprivileged families out of poverty so as to
keep those experiencing hard times from thinking into despair. We
are also setting up a system of community-based and nonprofit
extended care to improve the quality of care for the elderly. We
will expedite the passage of legislation to establish a national
pension system and pressing for its early implementation to
further enhance our social security network. Furthermore, we have
been working hard to set the National Health Insurance system on
a sounder financial footing to enhance the nation's health. In
addition, by establishing a program to provide assistance and
counseling, we will help immigrant spouses from
overseasXincluding  those  from  ChinaXimprove their
employability and achieve financial independence.
</P>
<P>
In short, no matter what difficulties the members of our society
may face, let us make sure that everyone can feel the compassion
and loving care we have for one another. I urge all departments
of government, in the shortest time possible, to realize the
goals that Ihave just outlined. At the same time, I call for the
ruling and opposition parties to do their utmost to draw up and
support necessary legislation and budgets.
</P>
<P>
This year marks the 60th anniversary of the February 28 Incident
and the 20th anniversary of the lifting of martial law. In the
period between these two events, the people of Taiwan were
subjected to a full 40 years of a party-state regime and
authoritarian rule. Even now, the suffering and wounds inflicted
on the people of Taiwan as a result of the injustices perpetrated
during that period have yet to be completely relieved and healed.
</P>
<P>
Over the past six years or so, in addition to making continual
compensation payments to victims and their families, the
government has declassified, compiled,  and published official
files and historical documents related to the February 28
Incident, the White Terror era, and significant political cases
from the martial law period. It is hoped that, thereby, we can
uncover the truth of what happened and move a step closer to
redressing injustices and restoring the reputations of those who
died or suffered. Also, on February 28 last year, my
administration instructed all government agencies, for the first
time, to fly flags at half-mast as a sign of perpetual mourning
for the victims of the February 28 Incident.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, there are still many historical truths that we have
not been able to fully uncover. Nor has action been taken to
determine culpability for the harm and violence committed. More
importantly,  various  legacies  of the previous  party-state,
authoritarian rule have yet to be dealt with appropriately. These
include vestiges of ideological and political dogmas based on a
conceptual "Great China," idolization of former authoritarian
rulers, and major problems of "transitional justice" such as
illegally acquired party assetsXa matter deemed unacceptable by
the vast majority of Taiwan's people.
</P>
<P>
It is our responsibility and duty to bring closure to the
memories of anguish and suffering of these past 60 years. It
behooves us, therefore, to turn this 60th-anniversary year of the
February 28 Incident into a significant watershed in the history
of Taiwan's democratization and development of human rights. In
addition to holding a plaque-unveiling ceremony on that date for
the February 28 National Memorial Museum, we hope to integrate
resources across society  to hold a wide variety  of additional
commemorative activities, and so that, by drawing on the power of
the people, more effective action can be taken to rectify
lingering vestiges of past mistakes  and  expedite  the
realization  of justice,  peace, reconciliation, and forgiveness.
</P>
<P>
The road from authoritarian rule to democracy is long and
arduous. This is particularly true for Taiwan and other newly
emerging third- wave democracies for which the gradual advance
toward democracy  started only within the past three decades.
These democracies must bear the shock and turmoil simultaneously
engendered by the twin forces of democratization and
globalization. They face similar problems involving issues such
as divisiveness over national and ethnic identity,  vicious
rivalry of multiparty  politics, difficulties in promoting
transitional justice, squabbling over the choice of a
constitutional system, and citizens' weak sense of social
responsibility.  Such problems pose serious threats to budding
democracies and often become important factors leading to
reversal of democracy and revival of authoritarianism.
</P>
<P>
As a new democracy, it is our responsibility and duty to spread
the seeds of democracy to other countries and regions as we
deepen democracy at home. We therefore advocate the unification
of forces throughout the world that deeply care about the
development of new democracies.  Our aim is to initiate a "Global
Forum on New Democracies" that will serve as a platform for
dialogue and exchange. Prior to its formal establishment, we
intend to convene an assembly in the near future to push for its
creation. Former national leaders of new democracies in Europe,
Asia, Africa, and Latin America will be invited to come together
and jointly seek solutions to common dilemmas and difficulties,
as well as facilitate the birth of this global forum.
</P>
<P>
My dear fellow citizens:
</P>
<P>
As we greet the New Year, we also celebrate our entrance into a
new era of innovation and speed. Since the transfer of power
between political parties in 2000, the world's tallest building,
Taipei 101, has surged heavenward to tower over Taipei and become
a new landmark and source of pride for Taiwan. The Hsueh- shan
TunnelXwhich is the world's fifth-longest and Asia's longest
highway tunnel and one of the world's most daunting feats of
engineeringXhas finally reached completion  and opened to traffic
thanks to the labors of a construction team that worked round-
the-clock, year-round without respite. Furthermore, the Taiwan
High-Speed Rail, which, in terms of capital, is the world's
largest ever build- operate-transfer (BOT) case and largest
single transportation project in Taiwan's history, will soon
begin its formal operations.
</P>
<P>
These three world-class construction projects can be taken as a
microcosm of the programs our government has carried forward over
the last six years. Utterly unfair are the multifarious
obstructions and boycotts encountered by related workXand unfair
are the attacks on and  vilification  of  project
leadersXresulting  from  petty considerations of inter-party
rivalry and wholesale politicization of everything.
</P>
<P>
Here, I would like to express my most sincere gratitude and
highest respect to all colleagues who have devoted themselves to
national construction projects, especially those who have served
as premier in the years since 2000 and their administrative
teams. You have all worked very hard, suffering the resentment
and slander of others without spite, regrets, or fear. Hardship
will eventually pass, whereas the recognition and gratitude felt
by the people will remain forevermore.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the three projects that I just mentioned, other
major infrastructure programs that have been completed include
the Keelung River flood-control project, development of the
Central Taiwan Science Park, improvement of water quality in the
greater Kaohsiung area, and establishment of the Pingtung
Agricultural Biotechnology Park.
</P>
<P>
Less  tangible  projects  that have borne  fruit  include:
strengthening the national financial system; overhauling credit
departments of farmers' and fishermen's associations;
implementation of the alternative minimum tax system;
establishment of the new labor pension  scheme;  enhancement  of
the efficiency of state-run enterprises; transforming our armed
forces into one that truly belongs to the nation and the people
and is not controlled by any individual or political party;
ensuring an independent judiciary; and withdrawal of political
parties, government, and the military from ownership or control
over electronic media.
</P>
<P>
These achievements are like the pieces of a jigsaw puzzle. Only
by piecing these various administrative achievements together can
we see the overall picture.
</P>
<P>
If we unite as one, our reach is beyond the skyXas the ambitions
and ideals of the Taiwanese people can surpass even the highest
of limits. If we act with one heart, the wisdom, determination,
and willpower of the Taiwanese people can create infinite
possibilities. Let us work in solidarity and forge ahead with
unswerving resolve. No matter how daunting external constraints
are, or how imposing future challenges may be, we shall overcome.
Opportunity and success will always be ours!
</P>
<P>
In closing, let us wish our country great success and lasting
prosperity. May good fortune prevail in the coming year. To all
of my fellow citizens and colleagues, Happy New Year! May you
enjoy peace and happiness. Thank you!
</P>
