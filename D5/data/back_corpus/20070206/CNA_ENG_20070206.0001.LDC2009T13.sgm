Taipei,  Feb. 5 (CNA) 02/06/07  10:45:30 (By Elizabeth Hsu)

The Republic of China government agrees in principle some of the
Philippines- proposed new measures to protect its workers in
Taiwan, but suggests it refrain from interfering with Taiwan's
internal administration  or encroaching  upon Taiwan's
administrative sovereignty, Council of Labor Affairs (CLA)
officials said Monday.
</P>
<P>
The officials  were responding  to media reports that the
Philippine government will implement a package of new measures
from March, which include demanding that Taiwanese employers
provide their Philippine household servants with a separate room
for sleeping, and demanding that Philippine workers intending to
change employers should apply for approval with the Philippine
representative office in Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
In the process, the media reports said, the Philippine government
will also require Taiwanese employers to explain why the
Philippine workers would change employers.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the ROC government has spared no efforts to protect
the rights and interests of foreign people working in Taiwan, the
CLA officials said the council respects the planned measures that
will ask employers to provide a single sleeping room to their
Philippine household maids or family helpers.
</P>
<P>
However, the officials said the CLA could not agree to the
proposed measures of requiring local employers to answer to the
Philippine representative office's questioning and Filipino
workers applying for its representative office approval before
changing employers.
</P>
<P>
Such measures, if implemented, would infringe upon Taiwan's
administrative sovereignty, the officials said, adding that it is
a general international norm and custom that labor importing
country's legal provisions should be respected in handling labor
disputes.
</P>
<P>
Stressing that the CLA as well as city and county governments
around Taiwan have had proper mechansims in place to handle labor
disputes, including change of employers, the officials said, the
Philippine government should not try to unilaterally interfere
with Taiwan's labor administration or exercise of its
administrative sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
Since labor rights protection is a universal value and one of
Taiwan's top policy guideline, the officials said the CLA will
ask Taiwan's  representative office  in Manila  to gain a better
understanding of details of the Philippine- proposed new measures
and to negotiate with relevant Philippine agencies over the
issue.
