The construction of the Wei-Wu Ying Arts and Cultural Center,
located on the border of Kaohsiung City and Kaohsiung County,
will be completed in 2012, an official of the Council for
Cultural Affairs (CCA) under the Executive Yuan said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Lin Chau Hau, Provisional Office Director of Wei-Wu Ying Arts and
Cultural Center announced the completion date at a meeting of the
Council for Economic Planning and Development under the Executive
Yuan.
</P>
<P>
The Executive Yuan approved the construction project for the
cultural center in November 2005, with the intention of
rebuilding the former military barracks into a multi-functional
cultural center of international standards.
</P>
<P>
The construction project was originally scheduled for completion
in 2009, with three theaters and one concert hall and related
facilities. The project, which comes with an expected price tag
of NT$ 8.36 billion (US$ 254 million), has been earmarked as
special budgetary item intended to enrich southern Taiwan's
performing arts.
</P>
<P>
Already the project has been delayed for multiple reasons, but
the first stage of international architecture design competition
has been completed and the final winner will be chosen from among
the six candidates in March. The future design will incorporate
the Metropolitan Park between Kaohsiung City and County.
</P>
<P>
Lin said the CCA has budgeted NT$ 760 million for nurturing
professional art performers, planning programs and other related
affairs in an effort to bring the Wei-Wu Camp Cultural Center up
to the standards of an international institute.
