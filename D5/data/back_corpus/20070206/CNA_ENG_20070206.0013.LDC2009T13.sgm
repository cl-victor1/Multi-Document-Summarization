OFFICIAL

Taipei,  Feb. 6 (CNA) 02/06/07  15:05:45 (By Lilian Wu)

<P>
The Ministry of Justice (MOJ) has provided criminal evidence
against a fugitive tycoon to U.S.  judicial authorities for
reference, Vice Minister of Justice Lee Chin-yung said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
However, Lee said that he "could not confirm" media reports that
prosecutors recently went to the United States to communicate
directly with U.S. officials on the case of Wang You-theng,
founder of the Rebar Asia Pacific Group, who is wanted in Taiwan
for his suspected involvement in a series of fraud and
embezzlement scandals surrounding his business group.
</P>
<P>
To get Wang back to Taiwan to face justice, the prosecutors also
communicated with the U.S. officials on possible ways of
cooperation, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan put Wang on its most-wanted list in mid-January. He tried
to fly to Myanmar via Singapore last Wednesday but was sent back
to the United States last Friday by Singaporean authorities as he
lacked the proper travel documents.
</P>
<P>
Wang arrived in Los Angeles Saturday and was taken into custody
by U.S. immigration officials because his Taiwan and Dominican
Republic passports were invalid as a result of efforts by the
Taiwan authorities. A U.S. court hearing on whether Wang can stay
in the United States will be held in one week.
</P>
<P>
Lee said that to get Wang back to face justice will live up to
the public's expectations and that to enhance the U.S.
understanding of Wang's involvement in a series of scandals
surrounding his business group is crucial to negotiations with
the U.S. authorities in getting him back to facilitate the probe.
</P>
<P>
Lee noted that the ministry is playing a dual role in Wang's
case. First, the ministry, based on the judicial assistance
agreement signed between Taiwan and the United States in March
2002, is communicating directly with the U.S. judicial
authorities, requesting assistance from the U.S. Justice
Department.
</P>
<P>
However,  Lee said that the ministry  has yet to receive
notification from the United States on sending officials to the
country to deal with Wang's case.
</P>
<P>
Secondly, many agencies under the Executive Yuan are dealing with
Wang's case, particularly the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, which
is in charge of negotiations with the United States, and the MOJ
is serving as the legal adviser to the Executive Yuan, providing
views on legal counselling.
</P>
<P>
Asked whether prosecutors have been sent to the United States or
whether prosecutors have traveled to the United States with
foreign affairs officials, Lee said he couldn't "confirm the
matter."
</P>
<P>
China Rebar and the Chia Hsin Food and Synthetic Fiber Co., both
subsidiaries of the Rebar Asia Pacific Group, applied for
insolvency protection Dec. 29. The disclosure of the two
companies' financial troubles triggered a run on the Chinese
Bank, another Rebar affiliate, Jan. 5, as well as intensive
investigations into a series of economic crimes affecting many of
the group's several dozen affiliates.
