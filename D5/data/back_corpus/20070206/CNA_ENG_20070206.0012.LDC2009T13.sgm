DEFENSE MINISTER SUPPORTS CIVILIAN CONTROL OF MILITARY
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  Feb.  6 (CNA) 02/06/07  14:13:01 (By Y.F. Low)

<P>
Minister of National Defense Lee Jye expressed support Tuesday
for the idea of civilian control of the military, saying he hopes
the goal can be achieved as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
Lee said that he has been discussing the issue with President
Chen Shui-bian and that he "can leave any time" if the president
has found a suitable person to replace him.
</P>
<P>
Lee was commenting on recent remarks by President Chen that he
hopes the principle of civilian control of the military, which
has not been realized in the past seven years, can be implemented
in the final year of his term.
</P>
<P>
On the Ministry of National Defense's recent decision to remove
the statues of late President Chiang Kai-shek from military bases
around the country, Lee urged the opposition parties not to make
a big deal out of what he called a "simple question."
</P>
<P>
Lee explained that the ministry is not going to destroy the
statues but is only relocating the statues to appropriate places,
such as a museum.
</P>
<P>
Noting that different opinions always abound in a democratic
society, Lee said there is no need for members of the opposition
to squabble over the issue because they can reinstall the statues
when they come to power in the future if they are unhappy with
the decision.
</P>
<P>
According to Lee, removing the statues has not undermined the
military's respect for Chiang, as the military still educates
soldiers about Chiang's contributions to Taiwan and follows
Chiang's defense policy and his principles in dealing with China.
</P>
<P>
Calling Chiang the key perpetrator responsible for the 228
Incident of 1947 in which thousands of people were massacred by
Kuomintang (KMT) troops in the suppression of a rebellion against
KMT rule in Taiwan, legislators of the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) have requested that the statues of the
late KMT leader be removed by Feb. 28 this year in memory of the
60th anniversary of the incident.
</P>
<P>
Legislators from the opposition KMT and People First Party have
criticized Lee for approving the DPP's request, saying Lee was
currying favor with the DPP to secure his position as defense
minister.
</P>
<P>
The opposition legislators claim the move is intended by the DPP
to gain the support of pro-independence voters in elections.
