DEEPENING DEMOCRACY TAIWAN'S BEST DEFENSE: PRESIDENT

President Chen Shui-bian said Tuesday that strengthening Taiwan's
democratic system is its best defense against China's missile
threat.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, the president also acknowledged the need for Taiwan
to upgrade its military strength in the face of China's attempt
to alter the Taiwan Strait status quo.
</P>
<P>
"China's military strength is growing exponentially, making it
imperative for Taiwan to upgrade its weaponry to maintain the
military balance," Chen said while meeting with a visiting
delegation from Britain's Royal United Services Institute for
Defense Studies.
</P>
<P>
Chen told his British  guests that China has outlined  a three-
stage plan in preparation for action against Taiwan. According to
Chen, China will have the readiness to respond to an emergency
military conflict this year. By 2010, it will be prepared to
fight a large-scale war, and before 2015, it will achieve the
decisive capability to win a war. The development deserves grave
concern, he added.
</P>
<P>
Chen further said China had already installed almost 1,000
missiles on its southeastern coast targeting Taiwan. Since he
took office in May 2000, Chen said China had increased its total
number of missiles targeting Taiwan from 200 to 988 by the end of
2006.
</P>
<P>
In the face of China's military expansion and attempts to change
the Taiwan Strait status quo, Chen said Taiwan must strive to
upgrade its combat prowess and military arsenal.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Chen said Taiwan is committed to deepening its
democratic system as the best means against China's military
threat.
</P>
<P>
Noting that China has not improved its human rights records, Chen
also asked British scholars and experts present at the meeting to
help push European Union countries not to lift their arms embargo
against China.
</P>
<P>
The British delegation is in Taipei to attend a seminar on
regional security and peace.
