Taipei,  Feb. 6 (CNA) 02/06/07  20:06:43 (By Elizabeth Hsu)

The Bureau of Investigation (BOI) announced Tuesday that police
had seized more than 100 kg of high-quality amphetamines and
ketamine in the northern port city Keelung, marking the largest
volume of drugs that law-enforcing authorities have ever
uncovered in a single smuggling case.
</P>
<P>
Earlier police arrested the main suspect, a man surnamed Chuang,
at the Taiwan Taoyuan airport on charges of smuggling and
violating regulations on drug hazard prevention and control,
frustrating his attempt to flee to China, according to a task
force formed by the BOI to investigate the case.
</P>
<P>
The task force indicated that the drugs, seized in two separate
operations with the first launched last July at a wharf warehouse
along the coast of Keelung and the other conducted Monday at a
Keelung  Customs cargo container  center, included  36 kg of
amphetamines and 106.4 kg of ketamine.
</P>
<P>
The street value of the drugs exceeds NT$100 million, and were
the drugs smuggled onto the island, they would be sufficient for
use by 15 million people, the task force said.
</P>
<P>
The drugs were cleverly hidden in an "in-between" layer at the
bottom of a cargo container shipped from Guangtong Province, in
southeastern China, the police said, noting that since last July
they have been watching a criminal ring discovered to have
schemed to smuggle goods, including foreign cigarettes, into
Taiwan by using cargo containers.
</P>
<P>
A further investigation into the criminal ring has been launched,
according to the BIO.
