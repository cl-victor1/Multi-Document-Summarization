Minister of National Defense Lee Jye said Tuesday that
maintaining a military equilibrium in the Taiwan Strait is the
best way to prevent a Chinese invasion of Taiwan and ensure peace
and stability in East Asia.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a national defense forum on East Asia's regional
security held by the National Defense Fu Hsing Kang College, Lee
said Taiwan must maintain adequate defense capability to prevent
a war from occurring in the Taiwan Strait.
</P>
<P>
He claimed that Taiwan can satisfy its defense needs by procuring
submarines, P-3C anti-submarine aircraft and Patriot PAC-III
missiles from the United States.
</P>
<P>
Lee said China's military threat to Taiwan is evident in the fact
that it has deployed 988 missiles on its southeast coast, with
Taiwan the target.
</P>
<P>
He also said that other factors that might affect regional
security are potential tension between China and its neighbors,
including Japan, South Korea, India and Southeast Asian
countries, such as territorial disputes and competing interests
in securing oil resources.
</P>
<P>
According to Lee, peace in the Taiwan Strait is not an issue only
between Taiwan and China, because any military conflict between
them is bound to affect stability in the whole region.
</P>
<P>
He gave credit to the United States government for taking
measures in recent years to engage China through strategic
dialogue, mutual visits of defense ministers, confidence-building
mechanisms and joint military exercises.
