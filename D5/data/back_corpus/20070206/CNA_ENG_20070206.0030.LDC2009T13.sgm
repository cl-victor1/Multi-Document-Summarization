KMT CENTRAL NOT IN FAVOR OF TAILOR-MADE CHANGE IN CLAUSE:
SPOKESMAN

Taipei,  Feb.  6 (CNA) 02/06/07  20:20:40 (By Flor Wang)
</P>
<P>
The Kuomintang's (KMT) central does not favor any regulation or
clause changes to serve one particular individual, main
opposition KMT spokesman Su Chun-pin said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Su made the remarks at a news conference in response to
reporters' questions about speculation that the KMT's decision-
making Central Standing Committee (CSC) will modify a clause in a
bid to enable KMT Chairman Ma Ying-jeou to run in the 2008
presidential election even if he is indicted on a graft charge.
</P>
<P>
It was widely reported that the prosecution will indict Ma on
embezzlement charges by Feb. 9 over his alleged mishandling of
special municipal fees earmarked for his discretionary use while
serving as mayor of Taipei from 1998 to 2006.
</P>
<P>
As the KMT regulations require a candidate to pull out of any
election if he or she is indicted, it has been rumored that the
powerful CSC is trying to revise the measure to allow Ma, the
party's most likely hopeful, to take part in the 2008
presidential race.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the KMT's CSC members were reportedly preparing to put
forward a motion at its weekly meeting the following day calling
for approval of the revised clause.
</P>
<P>
Claiming that the party central does not encourage such a
customized change, Su, however, said that it is not in a position
to meddle in any decision made by the top decision-making CSC and
that it was unaware of any such CSC plan.
</P>
<P>
KMT lawmaker and CSC member Lai Shyh-bao, who is widely viewed as
pro-Ma and who maintains  close links with the KMT chairman,
acknowledged that amending the clause to bail out Ma would be
controversial.
</P>
<P>
But he claimed that it is necessary for the CSC to deal with it
to avoid similar politically charged cases in the future because
the issue also involves many other high ranking officials who
receive special discretionary funds from the government, Lai
said, adding that he has no idea whether some CSC members have
endorsed the motion.
</P>
<P>
According to local media reports, some CSC members are in favor
of changing the party's clause to make "conviction" instead of
"indictment" the bottom line for any hopefuls seeking the party's
nomination to run in future elections.
</P>
<P>
Some CSC members were quoted by the reports as claiming that the
KMT's clause excluding indicted members from taking part in an
election is invalid because it goes against one of its platforms
saying that "convicted party members are not permitted to run in
any election."
</P>
<P>
Upon hearing this, Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng, a KMT
heavyweight, questioned how the party could fairly make amends to
other party members already banned from taking part in an
election in the past due to the special clause.
</P>
<P>
If the party approves the proposed modification to the clause, it
has to weigh how it could make it up to other affected members,
he said.
