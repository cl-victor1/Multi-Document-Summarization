TAIWAN PROPOSES CROSS-STRAIT MINISTERIAL MEETING ON EPIDEMIC CONTROL
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Geneva, May 21 (CNA) (By Neil Lu and Sofia Wu)
</P>
<P>
Taiwan's health minister invited his Chinese counterpart to use the
World Health Organization (WHO) as a platform for bilateral talks on
cross-Taiwan Strait cooperation in epidemic prevention and control.
</P>
<P>
Department of Health Minister Hou Sheng-mao issued the invitation at a
news conference in Geneva on the eve of the opening of the 2006 World
Health Assembly (WHA) -- the WHO's decision-making arm.
</P>
<P>
Hou said he is willing to put aside cross-strait political differences
and meet with Chinese Minister of Health Gao Qiang on the
establishment of a viable mechanism for bilateral cooperation in
communicable disease prevention and control, including avian flu in
humans, under the principles of parity, democracy, peace and dignity.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on the same occasion, Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs
Michael Ying-mao Kau, said Hou's invitation to Gao marks the first
time that Taiwan has proposed cross-strait talks on cooperation in
epidemic control and prevention.
</P>
<P>
Insisting that the invitation is not a tactical move to promote
Taiwan's bid to attend the annual WHA as an observer, Kau said the
invitation is congruent with Taiwan's China policy goal of forging a
framework for peaceful cross-strait interaction.
</P>
<P>
Kau is heading a group of Taiwan officials, including Hou, and medical
professionals to Geneva to drum up support for Taiwan's WHA
observership bid.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan will launch its 10th bid for the WHA observership at the 2006
WHA conference scheduled for May 22-27. Because of China's relentless
and arbitrary oppression, its previous bids were not successful.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Health Minister Gao Qiang, who is heading the Chinese
delegation to the WHA, will hold a news conference Monday afternoon.
It remains unclear how he will respond to Taiwan's call for a cross-
strait ministerial meeting on cooperation in disease prevention and
control, including the opening of a hotline for emergency response.
</P>
<P>
Under a memorandum of understanding signed between China and the WHO
last year, Taiwan's public health experts were allowed to take part in
14 WHO-sponsored meetings last year.
</P>
<P>
Kao said such arrangements only opened a "narrow door" for Taiwan to
get global epidemic information.
</P>
<P>
"What we really want is meaningful participation in WHO public health
mechanism, such as the Global Outbreak and Alert Response Network
(GOARN)," Kau said, adding that the United States, Japan and the
European Union firmly support Taiwan's appeal for its Disease Control
Center to be included into the GOARN mechanism.
