Taitung County, eastern Taiwan, April 2 (CNA) 04/02/07  22:40:30

A candidate for the chairmanship of the opposition Kuomintang
(KMT) urged the party's two presidential hopefuls -- former KMT
Chairman Ma Ying-jeou and Legislative Speaker Wang Jin-pyng --
"not to get inflated egos."
</P>
<P>
Drawing on his own experience, Wu Poh-hsiung, former KMT vice
chairman, said he had withdrawn from a 1994 election to help
James Soong become Taiwan's first governor elected by popular
vote.
</P>
<P>
"By inflating their egos, Ma and Wang will only hurt the party,"
Wu warned.
</P>
<P>
He acknowledged that the KMT has something to learn from the
ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) because no matter how
fierce the intraparty competition is among its candidates, the
DPP will close ranks to present a united front after the party
primaries.
</P>
<P>
Wu said he wished to become the KMT chairman because that would
be the best way for him to help the party choose the candidate
with the greatest chance of winning the 2008 presidential
election.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated that if he is elected KMT chairman, he will
consider retirement after the 2008 election, no matter whether
the KMT ticket wins or loses the election.
</P>
<P>
Wu made the remarks on a trip to Taitung County to canvass votes
from rank-and- file KMT members in the April 7 KMT chairmanship
by-election. He is running against KMT Legislator Hung Hsiu-chu.
</P>
<P>
The KMT chairmanship  became vacant after Ma resigned  in mid-
February following his indictment on charges of embezzlement by a
public prosecutor with regard to the alleged misuse of special
mayoral funds during his two terms as Taipei mayor.
</P>
<P>
Wu served as acting chairman for one month in his capacity as the
most senior vice chairman among the KMT's four deputies before
resigning his post on March 14. Vice Chairman Chiang Ping-kun is
now the acting KMT chairman.
