CONTROL YUAN FAILS TO ADDRESS DONATION SOLICITATION ISSUE: MOI
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  April 2 (CNA) 04/02/07  17:45:08 (By Lilian Wu)

<P>
Minister of the Interior Lee Yi-yang said Monday the Control
Yuan, the nation's highest watchdog body, has not done anything
to deal with donation solicitation by a former chairman of the
ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP).
</P>
<P>
Lee made the remarks after DPP Legislator Sue Huang asked about
an announcement by Shih Ming-teh the previous day that he will
begin the next stage of a campaign to depose President Chen Shui-
bian and that he will solicit new donations for the cause.
</P>
<P>
Huang alleged that Shih solicited donations from the public
illegally last August, with the amount collected in a short
period of time surpassing NT$100 million (US$3.03 million), and
that the government has failed to address the situation properly.
</P>
<P>
Shih's "Million Voices Against Corruption" campaign staged a mass
sit-in in front of the Presidential Office for days in September.
At one point, he led large numbers of "red shirt" protestors to
encircle the president's official residence and the Presidential
Office to demand that the president resign over a series of
alleged scandals surrounding his family members and close aides.
</P>
<P>
Lee noted that cash given to those taking part in presidential,
legislative and other types of elections as well as political
activities is categorized as political donations.
</P>
<P>
Those who solicit donations must open special accounts at the
Control Yuan in order to be able to receive the money, but Shih's
campaign has not opened an account, and this is why the Ministry
of the Interior has turned the case over to the Control Yuan, Lee
said.
</P>
<P>
According to the Political Donation Law, the Control Yuan is
responsible for the auditing and the meting out of fines.
However, Lee lamented, the Control Yuan "has so far done
nothing."
</P>
<P>
In response, an official of the Control Yuan said Monday that it
cannot deal with the matter in view of the fact that the Control
Yuan seats have yet to be filled.
</P>
<P>
The seats have remained vacant since the term of the previous
Control  Yuan members  expired  in  January  2005.  The
opposition-controlled legislature has continued to refuse to
confirm the president's list of nominees to serve on the Control
Yuan.
</P>
<P>
Hsieh Yu-nan, director of the Control Yuan's Public Functionary
Assets Disclosure Department, said Monday that under the
Political Donation Law, those who open up special accounts must
be political parties, political groups or candidates in
elections, adding that whether Shih, as the head of the campaign,
falls within this category remains to be discussed.
</P>
<P>
A committee comprised of Control Yuan members should first decide
whether Shih's activities should be regulated under the law,
Hsieh said.
</P>
<P>
Hsieh also said that he had asked Shih about how the donated
money has been spent last year. The campaign headquarters sent a
message to the Control Yuan, saying that it had spent about half
of the collected money. The Control Yuan has not kept track of
the campaign's expenses since the protests petered out late last
year.
