Fishing subsidies for purposes of environmental protection and
marine resource conservation should be allowed, while subsidized
fishing operations should be prohibited, officials from the
Fisheries Agency under the Council of Agriculture said Monday.
</P>
<P>
The officials made the remarks after Taiwan was labeled as one of
the world's leading subsidizers of fishing operations following a
strong stand in opposition to a comprehensive ban on government
subsidies to fishing fleets at the World Trade Organization
(WTO).
</P>
<P>
Japan and South Korea also strongly opposed the ban at WTO
negotiations recently held in Geneva, Switzerland, the officials
noted.
</P>
<P>
Taiwanese representatives will continue to explain Taiwan's
stance on the issue to the international community, the officials
stated.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan provides far fewer fishing subsidies than Japan and South
Korea, the officials stressed, adding that Taiwan ranks 20th in
the world and 11th in Asia in terms of government subsidies for
fishing operations, while globally, Japan is in first place and
South Korea in 12th.
