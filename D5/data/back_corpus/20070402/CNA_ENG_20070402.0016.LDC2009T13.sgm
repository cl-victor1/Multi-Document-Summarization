A special investigation team of the Supreme Prosecutors Office
formally began operations Monday in the fight against serious law
offenses that could profoundly affect the country's development.

<P>
State Public Prosecutor-General Chen Tsung-ming, Vice Minister of
Justice Lee Chin-yung, and Chen Yun-nan, director of the special
investigation team, jointly hosted a ceremony marking the task
force's inauguration.

<P>
The special team, with around 40 members,  including nine
experienced prosecutors  respected for their great virtue and
abilities in cracking down on crime, is being headed by Chen Yun-
nan.

Under the Court Organic Law, Lee said, the team is in charge of
probes into alleged bribery and other irregularities involving
the president, vice president, heads of the five government
branches -- the Executive Yuan, the Legislative Yuan, the
Judicial Yuan, the Examination Yuan and the Control Yuan -- as
well as generals and Cabinet members.

The team is also commissioned to take charge of efforts to crack
down on illicit practices related to national elections,
including the presidential election and the legislative
elections, as well as major corruption and economic crimes.

<P>
According to the law, the head of the investigation task force is
designated by the state public prosecutor-general from a pool of
six to 15 prosecutors named to serve on the team.
</P>
<P>
While conducting a probe into an alleged crime, the prosecutors
may launch searches and interrogations, issue warrants to bring
suspects into custody, and present indictments at any place in
the country.

<P>
Whenever the special team concludes a probe, it is then the state
public prosecutor-general's duty to present the results of the
probe to the Legislative Yuan.
