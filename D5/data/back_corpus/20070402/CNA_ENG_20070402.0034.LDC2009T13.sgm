The National Palace of Museum said Monday that it has no plan to
check its collections on a large scale in the near future.
</P>
<P>
The world-renowned museum was responding to suggestions by two
lawmakers of the opposition Kuomintang (KMT) who asked for more
random checks as well as more collected items be checked to
ensure the safety of the museum's priceless treasures.
</P>
<P>
Museum Curator Lin Mun-lee said that the museum had recently been
preoccupied with a series of activities,  including the 80th
anniversary of the founding of the museum in Beijing and the
reopening ceremony after the most comprehensive renovation since
it was reestablished in November 1965 following the move of its
vast trove of treasures to Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Lin noted that the museum has no time for a large-scale study of
its inventory. Moreover, since 2001, the museum has conducted
random checks every season of every year to ensure that it keeps
track of the collected items.
</P>
<P>
If it is necessary for large-scale monitoring, then the museum
must report to the Executive Yuan and notify the Council for
Cultural Affairs of its handling of the matter, Lin said.
</P>
<P>
KMT Legislators Lee Ching-an and Kuo Su-chun visited the National
Palace Museum Monday to learn about the collections of the museum
and their preservation in the wake of recent reports that "The
Jaded Cabbage, " one of the top jade attractions of the museum,
may have been damaged, although when it was damaged was not
certain.
</P>
<P>
Museum officials said random checks on collected items became
institutionalized in 2001. Between 2001 and 2007,  the palace
conducted 24 random checks, looking over an average of 1,400 to
1,700 items annually. The last major check was conducted in 1991.
</P>
<P>
The two lawmakers said that 24 checks are simply too few given
that there are 650,000 collected items in the museum.
