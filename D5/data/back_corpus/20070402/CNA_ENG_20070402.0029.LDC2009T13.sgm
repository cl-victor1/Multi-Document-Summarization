Concepts of interment have evidently undergone dramatic changes
over the past decade given that the cremation ratio rose to 85.6
percent in 2006, a survey on burial behavior published by the
Ministry of the Interior showed Monday.
</P>
<P>
Vice Interior Minister Chien Tai-lang announced the results of
the survey in the run-up to the Tombsweeping Day, which falls on
April 5.
</P>
<P>
Chien noted that the cremation ratio was 58.67 percent in 1997.
The figure rose to 85.6 percent in 2006, showing that the
public's ideas about interment have undergone dramatic changes
and that cremation, not traditional burial, is now the mainstream
choice.
</P>
<P>
The survey also showed that expenses for burials have decreased
by NT$13,612 (US$412.5) over the past 10 years, noting that the
expenses averaged NT$354,145 in 2006, down from NT$367,757 in
1997.
</P>
<P>
The survey also found that those who followed the dress code of a
traditional funeral accounted for 56.4 percent, and those who
wore white, grey, black or less colorful dress accounted for 40.7
percent, although those who said the ideal mourning dress should
be less colorful than usual accounted for 63 percent, and those
who can accept that funerals will be held after the cremation of
the loved ones accounted for 48.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
The number of bereaved families asking that funeral service
operators take care of all funeral-related matters accounted for
63.5 percent, while those who asked for part of the matters of a
funeral accounted for 23.1 percent, while two percent of the
families took care of funeral matters themselves.
</P>
<P>
Chien noted that Taiwan has entered an era in which society is
graying and fewer children are being born. Funeral services will
become ever more important given this trend, he argued.
</P>
<P>
Huang Li-shin, director of the MOI's Department of Civil Affairs,
said that to upgrade the quality of funeral parlor operations,
the ministry will actively help local governments to conduct
assessments of funeral parlor operators.
</P>
<P>
The ministry commissioned Nanhua University in Chiayi, southern
Taiwan, to conduct the survey on burial behavior between Aug. 1
and Oct. 15,  2006. A total of 1.009 effective questionnaires
were collected.
