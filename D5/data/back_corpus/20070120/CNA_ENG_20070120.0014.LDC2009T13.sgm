<P>
The main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) is slated to ink a deal next
Monday to formally create a political alliance  with the People
First  Party  (PFP) , through  a videoconference.
</P>
<P>
The KMT said in a press release issued Saturday that KMT Chairman
Ma Ying-jeou will clinch the accord Jan. 22 at KMT headquarters
through a videoconference with PFP Chairman James Soong, who is
on vacation in the United States.
</P>
<P>
The two parties decided to develop a more stable "political
partnership" based on their existing cooperative mechanisms, the
KMT said in its press release.
</P>
<P>
KMT Secretary Wu Den-yih and his PFP counterpart Chin Ching-sheng
will also take part in the signing ceremony.
</P>
<P>
The KMT's powerful Central Standing Committee approved a draft
proposal during its Jan. 3 weekly meeting on the establishment of
a formal KMT-PFP alliance with the aim of stabilizing  Taiwan's
politics, building peace across the Taiwan Strait and creating
benefits for the people.
</P>
<P>
It was also decided in the draft proposal that the KMT and the
PFP will field common candidates through negotiations to run in
the December legislative elections and compete in the 2008
presidential election.
</P>
<P>
The KMT and the PFP must step up cooperation in the Legislative
Yuan to counter the "pan-green camp" of the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party and the Taiwan Solidarity Union, Wu said.

<P>
According to Chin, the KMT and the PFP must fully integrate and
unite to win the 2008 presidential election and build a better
future for Taiwan.
