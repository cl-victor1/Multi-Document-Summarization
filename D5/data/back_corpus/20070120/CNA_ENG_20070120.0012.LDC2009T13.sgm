OPPOSITION AGAINST PROPOSAL FOR EXTRA LEGISLATIVE SESSION

Taipei,   Jan.  20  (CNA) 01/20/07  13:38:05 (By Y.F.  Low)

Opposition legislators voiced their objection Saturday to a
ruling party proposal to hold an extra legislative session to
deal with the government's 2007 budget bill, which was held up as
the last session ended fruitlessly in partisan bickering.
</P>
<P>
On the final day of the last legislative session Friday,
legislators from the main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) and the
ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) spent almost the whole
day squabbling over a KMT-initiated draft law on the organization
of the Central Election Commission (CEC) , according to which CEC
members would be recommended by political parties in proportion
to the number of their legislative seats.
</P>
<P>
While the KMT and its ally, the opposition People First Party,
attempted to steamroll the bill through the legislature, the DPP,
which opposed the bill, counteracted by filibustering the
legislative proceedings.
</P>
<P>
The DPP proposed that the extra session be held Jan. 30-31 to
consider the budget bill.
</P>
<P>
Tsai Chin-lung, a whip of the KMT legislative caucus, accused the
DPP of resorting to violence to block the CEC bill at the expense
of the budget bill.
</P>
<P>
Tsai said his caucus would not agree to holding an extra session
unless the draft bill on the CEC organization were to be put at
the top of the agenda.
</P>
<P>
"But it would be pointless to call an extra session if the DPP
resorts to the same violent means to block the bill," Tsai said.
</P>
<P>
Echoing the KMT's views, PFP legislative caucus convener Cheng
Chin-ling said the DPP was to blame for the delay of the budget
bill and that the PFP would never agree to holding an extra
session.
</P>
<P>
However, DPP legislative caucus convener Ker Chien-ming said the
KMT was the culprit because it had insisted on handling the
controversial draft law on the CEC organization before other
bills the DPP considered more important.
</P>
<P>
"It marked the first time in the history of the Republic of China
that the government's annual budget bill was not passed within a
legislative session. The KMT should shoulder the largest share of
responsibility for the obstruction of the country's development
projects and the drop in country's competitiveness," Ker claimed.
</P>
<P>
Coming to the DPP's support, Taiwan Solidarity Union legislative
caucus convener Liao Pen-yen urged the KMT drop its opposition to
the proposal to hold an extra legislative session.
</P>
<P>
According to Liao, the KMT's refusal to handle the government's
budget bill is "humiliating for the people of Taiwan."
