More than 10 percent of foreign caregivers in Taiwan suffer
depression, nearly triple the level among their Taiwan
counterparts, according to the results of a survey published
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The results of an investigation  on the health of female
caregivers in the workplace were made public during a seminar
sponsored by the International Action and Cooperation Team -- a
non-government organization.
</P>
<P>
It was found that 11.8 percent of the foreign caregivers in
Taiwan who responded to the survey,  or one in nine, suffer
depression, almost three times the 4.8 percent ratio registered
among their Taiwan counterparts.
</P>
<P>
Yang Chen-chang, a doctor at the Taipei Veterans General Hospital
who carried out the survey, urged Taiwan employers to pay greater
attention to the health of their foreign caregivers.
</P>
<P>
The health of foreign caregivers and housemaids is very important
to their Taiwan bosses as they take care of children, the elderly
and infirm in local families, Yang said.
</P>
<P>
The number of alien caregivers and housemaids in Taiwan now
exceeds 150,000 -- a fast expansion from 500 in the initial stage
in 1992, when migrant caregivers and maids first began to be
imported into the local market.
</P>
<P>
The investigation was conducted from September 2003 to September
2004, surveying 500 foreign and 250 local caregivers aged between
20 and 65 who have worked in the field for more than three
months.
