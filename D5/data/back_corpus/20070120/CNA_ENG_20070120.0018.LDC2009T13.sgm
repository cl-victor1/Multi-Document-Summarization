MOTC MAY ASK THSR TO SET OFF-PEAK FARE
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,   Jan.  20  (CNA) 01/20/07  18:59:54 (By Lilian Wu)

The Ministry of Transportation and Communications (MOTC) does not
rule out the possibility of asking the Taiwan High Speed Rail
Corp. (THSR) to set an off-peak fare to attract more passengers,
an MOTC official said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Pang Chia-hua, director-general of the Bureau of High Speed Rail,
was responding to questions about lower-than-expected ticket
sales of the full-price tickets Friday for days after Feb. 1.
</P>
<P>
"The bureau will observe the situation for a few more days," Pang
said, adding that if the situation does not improve, the bureau
might ask the THSR to set an off-peak fare and review the fare
structure to attract more passengers.
</P>
<P>
The THSR began its bullet train service between Banciao, Taipei
County and Zuoying, Kaohsiung County Jan. 5. The discount fares
were originally scheduled to end Jan. 14 but were later extended
to Jan. 31 due to some embarrassing technical glitches,
particularly with the ticketing system.
</P>
<P>
The standard fare for the Taipei-Kaohsiung service is NT$1,490
(US$45.4) for one ride, or NT$2,440 for business class.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, nine engineering experts made a field inspection of
the system's final 5-kilometer section linking Banciao with
Taipei City Saturday and were scheduled to submit their report
Monday.
</P>
<P>
The field  survey  aimed at detecting  possible  flaws or
deficiencies  in the system will cover three areas --  civil
engineering, electrical engineering and software operations.
</P>
<P>
If all goes well, the final section of the high-speed railway
will be ready for operation before Chinese New Year, which falls
on Feb. 18.
</P>
<P>
The 345-km railway cuts travel time between Taipei and the
southern port city of Kaohsiung from four-and-a-half hours to
just 90 minutes.
