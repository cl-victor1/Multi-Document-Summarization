Fights broke out on the last day of the legislative session
Friday as parties clashed over the Organic Act of the Central
Election Commission.
</P>
<P>
The opposition Kuomintang (KMT) is pushing hard to pass the
election  commission law and adopt a system  of proportional
representation by party in the nomination of commission members,
a system the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) opposes.
</P>
<P>
As negotiations went on in vain, lawmakers from the two sides
began to gather around the speaker's platform after Speaker Wang
Jin-pyng announced at 2: 43 p.m. the opening of the sitting. As
KMT lawmakers put forward a motion to end debate on the bill and
send it directly to voting, DPP lawmakers crowded onto the
platform to prevent Wang Jin-pyng from announcing a vote on the
motion. In response, KMT lawmakers surrounded Wang to"protect"him
and chaos ensued.
</P>
<P>
In successive waves of conflict, Wang was struck in the mouth,
and independent lawmaker Tsai Hau was hit in the face with a shoe
thrown by the DPP's Wand Shu- hui. Several other lawmakers
received cuts, but no one was seriously injured.
</P>
<P>
The motion passed on the second attempt to call the vote.
