Taipei, Feb. 8 (CNA) 02/08/07  20:30:14 (By T.C. Jiang)

Taiwan's export and import values reported double-digit increases
in January -- up 17.9 percent and 23.8 percent respectively, from
the same period last year -- to record levels of US$19.85 billion
(NT$655.6 billion), and US$17.96 billion, an official from the
Ministry of Finance (MOF) said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
This gave Taiwan a trade surplus of US$1.89 billion, Lee Li-shu,
chief statistician at the MOF, noted.
</P>
<P>
However, both exports and imports are likely to see negative
growth in February, owing to the nine-day Lunar New Year holiday,
Lee pointed out.
</P>
<P>
January's export value was the second highest single-month value
after last September's US$20.1 billion, while the import value
was the third highest, Lee said.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the import of consumer products hit a new high for a
single month at US$1.52 billion, marking a strong contrast with
the negative 2.3 percent growth rate for the entire 2006, Lee
pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Kung Ming-hsin, vice president of the Taiwan Institute of
Economic Research (TIER) , attributed the strong performance of
imports and exports in January to the favorable international
economic climate.
</P>
<P>
Kung explained that the United States reported higher economic
growth in the fourth quarter than was widely expected, and oil
prices have not been skyrocketing, which have contributed to
Taiwan's economic growth.
</P>
<P>
According to MOF officials, January saw a high rise in the number
of passenger cars imported. At the same time, the import of
vehicles with engines between 1500cc and 2500cc grew by 139.1
percent, while those 3000cc and above was up 66 percent, they
added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, there was also a noticeable growth in the import of
medicine, tobacco and liquor, as well as cosmetics, the officials
noted.
</P>
<P>
Officials explained that the lowering of import duties and
commodity taxes might have prompted more people to buy cars this
year.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, Kung said it is likely that many export
companies earned profits last year, and therefore rewarded their
young employees more year-end bonuses.
</P>
<P>
As a result, they have begun to purchase cars, and might choose
foreign cars over domestically manufactured ones as the price gap
between them is narrowing, Kung added.
