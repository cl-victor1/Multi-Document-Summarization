COORDINATION AMONG DPP HOPEFULS WILL BE SMOOTH IF TIMING RIPE

Taipei,  Feb.  8 (CNA) 02/08/07  21:43:05 (By Lilian Wu)

Coordination among the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)
presidential hopefuls will only be smooth if the timing is ripe,
President Chen Shui-bian's top aide said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Chiou I-jen, secretary-general to the president, made the remarks
amid reports that four DPP heavyweights -- Vice President Annette
Lu, Premier Su Tseng-chang, DPP Chairman Yu Shyi-kun and former
Premier Frank Hsieh -- are jockeying for party nomination in the
runup to the party primaries in May.
</P>
<P>
Noting that some DPP officials are hoping that Chen will
intervene to smooth out difficulties in nominating a presidential
candidate, Chiou said nothing should be done in haste.
</P>
<P>
"We can't rush the matter. When the timing is ripe, the
coordination will go smoothly," he said.
</P>
<P>
He also claimed that if coordination is needed, it means that the
party's primary mechanism in which public opinion polls will
account for 70 percent and party member vote will account for the
remaining 30 percent will not work.
</P>
<P>
It also means that the result of the coordination must be
"accepted willingly by every aspirant," he claimed.
</P>
<P>
DPP Legislator Yeh Yi-jin said party members at the grassroots
level have generally expressed the hope that Su and Hsieh will
form a ticket and the party has not ruled out the possibility of
suggesting that Chen tout coordination this Saturday at a spring
gathering to which elected DPP officials and the party's Central
Standing Committee have been invited.
</P>
<P>
Yeh made the remarks after DPP Chairman Yu Shyi-kun proposed
removing the guards stationed at late President Chiang Kai-shek's
temporary mausoleum in northern Taiwan Taoyuan, which was widely
seen as a move by Yu to cater to the wishes of hard-core
supporters of the "pan-green camp" led by the DPP to facilitate
his bid for DPP Presidential candidacy.
