TAIWAN CALLS FOR CROSS-STRAIT JUDICIAL COOPERATION
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Washington,  Feb. 7 (CNA) 02/08/07  15:26:00 (By Chiehyu Lin and
Y.F. Low)

Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) Chairman Joseph Wu urged China
Wednesday to respond positively to Taiwan's call for cross-Taiwan
Strait judicial cooperation so as to clear itself of the
reputation  of being a "paradise for Taiwanese criminals."
</P>
<P>
Wu noted that under the Kinmen Agreement signed by the Red Cross
societies on the two sides of the Taiwan Strait in 1990, Taiwan
has repatriated  a large number of illegal Chinese immigrants and
criminals.
</P>
<P>
Although China has also repatriated more than 100 Taiwanese
criminals over the years, approximately 400 Taiwanese criminals
are still hiding in China, and Chinese authorities have no
intention of helping Taiwan arrest them and send them back, Wu
pointed out.
</P>
<P>
According to Wu, owing to the lack of any standards or system in
dealing with matters as such, Beijing usually bases its decision
on whether to repatriate the Taiwanese criminals on whether they
have committed any crime in China.
</P>
<P>
Citing the case of Rebar Asia Pacific Group founder Wang You-
theng  as an example,  Wu said that Taiwan asked Chinese
authorities to help track down and repatriate Wang soon after he
fled to China but that Beijing ignored the request and even
allowed Wang to leave China freely for the United States.
</P>
<P>
As Beijing has no obligation to help Taiwan arrest criminals
hiding in China under the present situation, Taiwan has
repeatedly called  for  the establishment  of a cross-strait
accord  on crime-fighting cooperation, Wu said.
</P>
<P>
Wu, who is on a visit in the U.S. capital, made the remarks in
response to questions from Taiwan reporters.
</P>
<P>
On China's effort to improve its international image ahead of the
2008 Olympic Games to be held in Beijing, Wu said it is a
positive development that China has recently relaxed its news
coverage restrictions for foreign media and allowed the content
of a book on democracy to be published in newspapers in the
country.
</P>
<P>
However, China has on the other hand stepped up its suppression
of civil rights activists and shown no improvement in human
rights protection, Wu said.
</P>
<P>
On the issue of allowing  Chinese  media outlets to post
correspondents in Taiwan, Wu said the MAC suspended permits for
China's state-controlled Xinhua News Agency and People's Daily to
post correspondents in Taiwan two years ago because they had
repeatedly produced misleading reports about Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
While making the decision at that time, the MAC also asked
Beijing to allow the Chinese people to enjoy broader access to
news reports by Taiwanese media, Wu noted.
</P>
<P>
Praising China for having made some progress in this regard
recently, Wu pointed out that news Web sites run by Taiwan's
China Times and United Daily News, which were blocked  by Chinese
authorities in the past, are now accessible in some areas of
China.
</P>
<P>
Wu said the MAC will restore the permits for the two Chinese
media  outlets  and even allow  more Chinese  media  to post
correspondents in Taiwan if Beijing removes its "blockade"
against Taiwan media completely.
