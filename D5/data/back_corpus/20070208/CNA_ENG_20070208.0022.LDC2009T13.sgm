Heavy fog caused another closure of Taoyuan International Airport
from 2 a.m. - 10 a.m. Thursday after a previous closure
stretching from Tuesday night until Wednesday evening, a
spokesman of the Civil Aeronautics Administration (CAA) said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Low visibility caused by heavy fog started at 2 a.m. Thursday,
affecting more than 30 flights and nearly 6,000 passengers. About
30 flights were delayed and six were redirected to Kaohsiung
International Airport. Most of the passengers affected were from
tour groups to Southeast Asia.

<P>
Runways were not reopened until visibility increased from 100 to
2,200 meters around 10 a.m the same day, said the CAA spokesman.
</P>
<P>
The previous closure of the Taoyuan International Airport
affected 150 passenger and cargo flights between Tuesday and
Wednesday evenings. Some of the affected flights were redirected
to other international airports or delayed, while others were
canceled.
</P>
<P>
Taoyuan International Airport usually redirects flights to other
international airports in reaction to closures caused by bad
weather. Some local carriers may be redirected to Songshan
Airport in Taipei under special conditions; if so, their
passengers must then go through the formalities of customs or
transfer procedures at Taoyuan International Airport.

<P>
The spokesman reminded passengers to confirm their flight
schedules with the airlines to avoid delays and inconvenience.
