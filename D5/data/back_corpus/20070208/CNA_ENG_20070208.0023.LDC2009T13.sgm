President Chen Shui-bian voiced his support Thursday for a
national name rectification campaign, saying that the move will
help highlight Taiwan's identity and galvanize the people's
confidence.
</P>
<P>
Writing in an online newspaper published by the Presidential
Office, in response to a reader's inquiries, Chen said that the
government is poised to carry out the task in a piecemeal
fashion.
</P>
<P>
In the future, overseas outposts and state-run enterprises, such
as the Chinese Petroleum Corp., China Shipbuilding Corp., as well
as various official documents will no longer carry the term
"China" or "Chinese" in their official titles to distinguish from
their Chinese counterparts, Chen said.
</P>
<P>
The national name rectification campaign is a long-term policy
goal of the government, the first move towards which was changing
the name of Chiang Kei- shek International Airport to Taiwan
Taoyuan International Airport, a move that received a warm
response from the public, Chen said, adding that most of the
Taiwanese people want to correct the name used to represent the
country's public companies.
</P>
<P>
Although the president acknowledged that changing names for
Taiwan's state-run enterprises will entail some effort and costs,
he argued that it is worthwhile to do so because it will be
helpful in building world-class brands such as Nokia, Microsoft
and Toyota among Taiwan's businesses.
</P>
<P>
Chen's endorsement for the national name rectification campaign
came one day after ruling Democratic Progressive Party Chairman
Yu Shyi-kun proposed at the party's Central Standing Committee
that a name change drive be launched nationwide, starting with
the names of public-run companies.
</P>
<P>
Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesman Wang Chien-yeh echoed
Chen's call and said that the ministry will continue working to
have the word "Taiwan" added to the nation's embassies and
representative offices.
</P>
<P>
Brushing aside rampant allegations that the name change drive is
a politically charged move, Wang urged the outside world to
refrain from speculating the issue and called it a necessary
measure to avoid international confusion.
