President Chen Shui-bian said Thursday that the National Palace
Museum symbolizes  Taiwan's commitment  to promoting cultural
diversity.
</P>
<P>
Chen made the remarks while presiding over the inauguration of
the museum's newly renovated main exhibition hall.
</P>
<P>
Saying that the overhaul project manifests the government's
determination to build a modern museum based around its ancient
Chinese art collection, Chen said the inauguration of the Palace
Museum main hall will give history a new twist.
</P>
<P>
The National Palace Museum in suburban Taipei houses the world's
most famous collection of ancient Chinese artworks. It is often
compared to leading Western museums like the Louvre in Paris and
the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York.
</P>
<P>
The three-year renovation project has given the old museum a
brand new face and new spirit, Chen said, adding that the museum
will from now on handle art collection in a broader vision.
</P>
<P>
According to Chen, the museum's future art collection will
reflect "love for Taiwan and vision on globalization." Noting
that the museum's Chinese art treasures are invaluable world
cultural heritage, Chen said the government will continue sparing
no effort to preserve and glorify them.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Chen said, the museum should also endeavor to
expand the scope of its art collection to realize its ambitious
goal of becoming  the world's top- notch  cultural institution
with diversified artworks in its possession.
</P>
<P>
Chen also mentioned his administration's plan to build a new
museum in Taipao in southern Chiayi County to be the Palace
Museum's branch facility which will focus on displaying Asian
artworks and cultural heritages. The southern branch will
demonstrate Taiwan people's vision and passion for arts, cultures
and lifestyles in neighboring Asian countries, he added.
</P>
<P>
Over the past three years, almost two-thirds of the National
Palace Museum building was closed for the renovation project.
Following the overhaul, heroic statutes of the late President
Chiang Kai-shek and of Sun Yat-sen, the founding father of the
Republic of China have been removed, while new lighting, air-
conditioning, climate-controlled storage vaults and other
features of the renovated institution rival the newest museums in
the West.

<P>
Many dignitaries, including Premier Su Tseng-chang,  museum
curators from home and abroad, members of the Taipei Diplomatic
Corps, scholars, experts and business executives, attended the
reopening reception.
