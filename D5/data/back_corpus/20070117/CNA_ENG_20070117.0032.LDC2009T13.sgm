President Chen Shui-bian greeted visiting Palauan President Tommy
Remengesau Jr. Wednesday in the first-ever indoor welcoming
ceremony held for a national leader.
</P>
<P>
Heavy rain meant that the ceremony had to be held in a hall at
the Presidential Office. Also on hand were Vice President Annette
Lu, National Security Council Secretary-General Chiou I-jen,
Examination Yuan President Yao Chia-wen and Foreign Affairs
Minister James Huang.
</P>
<P>
In a later meeting between the two leaders, Chen noted that since
the two countries established diplomatic relations eight years
ago, they have joined hands to promote infrastructure programs
for the Pacific country. The cooperation has become a model for
cooperative partnership in the region, he added.
</P>
<P>
The president also said the construction of the new capital of
Palau, which was financed by low-interest loans from Taiwan, has
been completed and that Taiwan "shares the joy and pride of the
Palauan people."
</P>
<P>
He also lauded Palau for speaking up for Taiwan's bid to join
international organizations such as the United Nations, the World
Health Organization and the Pacific Island Forum.
</P>
<P>
Chen said a state dinner in Remengesau's honor will be held in
the southern port city of Kaohsiung Thursday.
