The survey uses a scale of 1 to 7 to indicate the freedom ratings
of more than 100 countries and territories in the categories of
political rights and civil liberties. A rating of 1 indicates the
highest degree of freedom and 7 the least amount of freedom.
These ratings determine whether a country is classified as "free,
" "partly free" or "not free."

Taiwan received a rating of 2 in terms of political rights, down
one notch from last year, and maintained a rating of 1 in terms
