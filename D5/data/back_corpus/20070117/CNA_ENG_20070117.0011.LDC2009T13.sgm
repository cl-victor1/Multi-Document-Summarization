MOJ SEEKS U.S. ASSISTANCE IN PROBING REBAR FOUNDER'S ASSETS

Taipei,  Jan. 17 (CNA) 01/17/07  12:35:01 (By Sofia Wu)
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Justice (MOJ) has formally sought U.S. assistance
in investigating the scandal-ridden Rebar Asia Pacific Group
founder's personal assets and financial status in the United
States, Cabinet spokesman Cheng Wen- tsang said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
As to whether the Executive Yuan has any knowledge of the 82
-year-old Rebar founder Wang You-theng's whereabouts, Cheng said
he is not in a position to answer such a question.
</P>
<P>
According to U.S. authorities, Wang and his wife, Chin Shih-ying,
entered the United States via San Francisco last weekend, with
Wang using a Republic of China passport and Chin using a U.S.
passport.
</P>
<P>
The couple are at the center of a snowballing financial scandal
and are believed to have stolen billions of dollars in corporate
funds before going on the lam. They have been placed on Taiwan's
most-wanted list on charges of embezzlement, insider trading,
fraud and breach of trust.
</P>
<P>
As news media have reported that the Wangs have purchased real
estate and have owned a bank in the United States, Cheng said the
judicial authorities need to verify such reports. Since the
United States is known to have done a good job in asset
documentation in the past, Cheng said the probes are expected to
generate concrete results soon with U.S. support and assistance.
</P>
<P>
Asked if the government is likely to "freeze" the Wangs' assets,
Cheng said the government will do its utmost to assist creditor
banks in taking necessary actions to protect their own interests
and rights.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan signed a judicial aid agreement with the United States in
March 2002, under which the two parties can help each other in
the obtaining of witnesses' testimonies, delivery of legal
documents, ascertaining of the identities of criminal suspects
and their whereabouts, as well as the search and impounding of
evidence and freezing of assets of those who stand accused.
</P>
<P>
Quoting MOJ tallies, Cheng said Taiwan has so far asked the
United States to assist in handling 15 cases, nine of which have
been completed. He added that the United States has requested
Taiwan's assistance in helping with 24 cases, 16 of which have
been successfully tackled.
</P>
<P>
At the request of the Taipei Prosecutor's Office, the Ministry of
Foreign Affairs (MOFA) has invalidated the Wangs' passports.
Cheng said the revocation of their ROC passports will at least
make it harder for the couple to transfer assets.
</P>
<P>
Rebar's financial woes came to light after two of its member
companies -- China Rebar Co. and Chia Hsin Food and Synthetic
Fiber Co. -- applied for bankruptcy protection Dec. 29. Their
insolvency reorganization announcement prompted a run on the
Chinese Bank, another Rebar subsidiary. The bank has since been
taken over by the state-run Central Deposit Insurance Corp.
</P>
<P>
Judicial probes into the group's suspected financial crimes
followed. Investigators have launched many rounds of large-scale
searches at Rebar's headquarters and offices of several of its
120-odd member companies and private homes of the Wang family and
corporate executives.
</P>
<P>
Initial investigation results show that cross holding and cash
transfers among Rebar member companies were very complicated and
muddled, Cheng said, adding that the Ministry of Finance and the
Financial Supervisory Commission have assigned five and 10 staff
members,  respectively,  to help  with checking  and analyzing
transaction and accounting records uncovered in recent raids at
the Rebar headquarters.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, judicial authorities have issued an overseas travel
ban on a total of 59 Rebar group executives and Wang family
members. Except for the group founder and his wife, all of those
restricted from leaving Taiwan are still in the country.
</P>
<P>
Immigration officers at the country's main airports and harbors
have heightened their vigilance to prevent any of those on the
"travel ban" list from slipping out of the country. Photographs
and relevant information about each of the individuals have been
sent to immigration check points for officials' reference.
</P>
<P>
The travel ban marks the largest number of people restricted from
leaving the country for any single criminal case in Taiwan's
history. As many of them have not yet had their identification
cards renewed and do not have any real estate in their
possession, prosecutors said they suspect that many of those who
stand accused  may have deliberately committed many
irregularities that could be traced back to more than a decade
ago.
