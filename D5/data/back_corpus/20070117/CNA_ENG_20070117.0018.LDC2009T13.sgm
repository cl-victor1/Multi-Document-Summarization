<P>
Taiwan investors' confidence in the local investment market is
getting increasingly stronger thanks to the recent soar in the
country's stock prices, according to the results of a survey
released Wednesday by JF Asset Management.
</P>
<P>
The bi-monthly survey shows that Taiwan's investor confidence
index registered 114.5 in January, up 15 points from the level of
two months ago and close to the all-time high of 115.9 recorded
in May 2006.
</P>
<P>
Most of the indicators used for the survey rose in January, with
the "overall environment and sentiment of Taiwan's investment
market" indicator seeing the largest increase, gaining 21.8
points from two months ago.
</P>
<P>
The "Taiwan stock index/prices" indicator jumped 21.1 points,
while the "global economic climate" indicator remained at the
record high of 130.6.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the "possibility of one own's investment porfolio
appreciating in the next six months" indicator also climbed to an
all-time high of 135.2.
</P>
<P>
As many as 86 percent of investors expect consumer prices to rise
in the next six months, up from 11.3 percent of investors two
months ago, the survey shows.
</P>
<P>
However, there was only a 1.4-point rise in the ratio of
investors who expect employment opportunities to increase and a
4-point rise in the ratio of investors who expect their earnings
to increase.
</P>
<P>
On the investment tools favored by the respondents, 52.1 percent
have chosen to purchase local stocks, down 9.1 percentage points
from the year-earlier level.
</P>
<P>
While the ratio of respondents choosing to invest in mutual funds
using a regular small savings plan increased 10.5 percentage
points year-on-year to 41 percent, the ratio of those choosing to
buy foreign mutual funds also jumped 9.5 percentage points to
35.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
The survey found that 60.5 percent of investors who held a
globally diversified portfolio  and 71.5 percent of investors
investing in overseas markets made a profit last year, with
European, emerging markets and Asian stocks being the most
profitable.
</P>
<P>
On the expected return on investment for this year, 31.1 percent
of the investors predicted the rate of return will reach at least
20 percent, and 33.9 percent predicted the rate of return will
range between 10 percent and 19 percent.
</P>
<P>
While 40.3 percent of the respondents said they will make more
investment with their year-end bonuses, 17.9 percent said they
will not get any year-end bonuses this year.
</P>
<P>
The survey, conducted between Dec. 12 and Jan. 8 on 1,069
investors around Taiwan, has a margin of error of plus or minus 3
percentage points.
