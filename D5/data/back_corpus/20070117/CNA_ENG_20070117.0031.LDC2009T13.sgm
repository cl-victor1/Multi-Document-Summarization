The opposition Kuomintang's (KMT's) legislative caucus decided
Wednesday to vote against President Chen Shui-bian's nomination
of Chen Tsung-ming as State Public Prosecutor General.
</P>
<P>
KMT caucus leader Tsai Chin-Lung said the party will enforce
discipline to ensure that all of its lawmakers cooperate when the
Legislative Yuan votes on Chen Tsung-ming's appointment Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The caucus decided to reject the nomination through an internal
straw vote in which 52 out of the 75 members present voted
against the nomination, 21 voted for and two abstained.
</P>
<P>
A review panel of the caucus briefed members before the straw
vote. According to Tsai, the panel report listed several points
unfavorable for Chen Tsung-ming, including that he is
inconsistent about the status of special investigation forces,
that his wife withdrew NT$1.06 million from the Chinese Bank
before the financial troubles of the bank's parent company, Rebar
Asia Pacific Group, were disclosed that sparked a run on the
bank, and that he is alleged to have unduly lobbied lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
KMT Chairman Ma Ying-jeou had expressed through a party spokesman
a day earlier that he opposed Chen Tsung-ming's nomination.
</P>
<P>
The president nominated Chen Tsung-ming, now Prosecutor-General
of Taiwan High Court Prosecutor's Office's Kaohsiung branch, to
fill the top prosecutorial post last May, after the previous
nominee, Hsieh Wen-Ting, then the Taiwan High Court Prosecutor-
General, was vetoed by the opposition-controlled legislature Apr.
11. Chen Tsung-ming's case had since been blocked by the
opposition from being put onto the legislature's schedule until
late December.
</P>
<P>
An approval of the state public prosecutor-general's nomination
requires approval from half of the legislators present. With
neither the KMT nor the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)
holding half the seats in the now 218-seat legislature, the
opposition People First Party's 21 seats will play an important
role, as will those of the opposition Taiwan Solidarity
Union(TSU), which has 12 seats.
</P>
<P>
Chen Tsung-ming told the CNA Wednesday that he "will accept the
vote result." He also denied rumors that he had wined and dined
lawmakers to enlist their support.
