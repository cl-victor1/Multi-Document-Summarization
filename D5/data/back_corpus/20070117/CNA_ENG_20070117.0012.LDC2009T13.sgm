Kaohsiung City failed Tuesday in its bid for the right to host
the 2011 Summer Universiade, marking the southern Taiwan port
city's third failure to gain the right to host the games over the
past decade.
</P>
<P>
The Executive Committee of the World University Sports Federation
(FISU) -- organizer of the biennial Universiade, also known as
the World University Games -- selected Shenzhen, China from among
the five final candidates to host the 2011 event. The other
candidates were Russia's Kazan, Poland's Poznan and Spain's
Murcia.
</P>
<P>
Chen Tai-cheng, the FISU's executive member from Taiwan, said he
feels regret over the outcome, claiming that "it's quiet obvious
that money played the decisive role in the competition."
</P>
<P>
Although Kaohsiung had the best advantages, including complete
facilities and relevant programs in coordination with the
sporting event, among the bidders, it still received a "no" vote
in the second round of the committee voting, Chen said, adding
that the only reason Taiwan lost was that the amount it offered
to host the games was less than the amounts offered by the other
bidding cities.
</P>
<P>
China bid US$22 million for the right to host the games, while
Russia offered a bid of US$15 million, both far larger amounts
than Taiwan's US$8 million.
</P>
<P>
Members of the visiting Taiwan delegation promoting the bid,
including Kaohsiung Mayor Chen Chu,  Minister of Education Tu
Cheng-sheng, and Chen Chuan-shou, chief of the National Council
on Physical Fitness and Sports, said they all regret that the
selection process has "turned into a game of money."
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, they also said that Taiwan will continue to be
enthusiastic about participating in all kinds of international
sporting events and that the country will also try again to win
the right to host the World University Games in the future.
