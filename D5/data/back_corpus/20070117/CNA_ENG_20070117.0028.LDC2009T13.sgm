GOVERNMENT URGED NOT TO CONSTRUCT EXPRESSWAY IN EASTERN TAIWAN

Environmental activists united Wednesday to oppose the
construction of a NT$100 billion (US$3.04 billion) expressway in
eastern Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
The activists, including three members of a Cabinet advisory
group on sustainable development, expressed their opposition on
the eve of a screening meeting on the Suhua expressway to be
convened by the Environmental Protection Administration (EPA).
</P>
<P>
They urged the Executive Yuan to invest instead in promoting the
scenery and distinctive cultural features so that the east coast
can become a world-class scenic area.
</P>
<P>
They also criticized the construction of the road simply to cater
to the needs of domestic tourists.
</P>
<P>
The activists, including representatives from the hotel and film
sectors, blasted what they called myopic politicians for using
the expressway project as a pork barrel ploy to win voters in
every election campaign, without knowing about the disastrous
impact on ecology and tourism in eastern Taiwan that the road
would have.
</P>
<P>
Lee Wei-wen, a member of the National Council for Sustainable
Development under the Executive Yuan, described the building of
roads and bridges as an "outdated mindset" and that an expressway
connecting Suao and Hualien is not the best option.
</P>
<P>
His colleague Chen Man-li also said that limited land available
in Taiwan cannot sustain so many expressways.
</P>
<P>
Another colleague, Chang Chang-yi, said that a national economic
conference last year concluded that the construction plan should
be put on hold for further review. If an EPA meeting scheduled
for Thursday decides to build the expressway, it will be like
slapping its own face, he said.
</P>
<P>
Noted film director Hou Hsiao-hsien urged the government to put
more efforts into combining cultural creativity into the tourism
sector to produce a moving and memorable experience for visitors.
</P>
<P>
Hotel representative Stanley C. Yen expressed the hope that the
politicians will not only aim at attracting tourists for one-day
tours at the expense of tourists seeking an in-depth tour
experience.
</P>
<P>
"The construction of the expressway would be like opening
Pandora's box. Once opened, the natural beauty of eastern Taiwan
could be ruined forever," Yen added.
