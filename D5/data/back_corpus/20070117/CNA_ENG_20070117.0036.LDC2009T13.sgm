KMT HEAVYWEIGHT SUGGESTS PARTY PUT OFF PRESIDENTIAL PRIMARY
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  Jan. 17 (CNA) 01/17/07  20:19:09 (By Elizabeth Hsu)

Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng -- an influential member
of the opposition Kuomintang (KMT) -- suggested Wednesday that
the KMT put off its presidential primary to give more time for
election preparations.
</P>
<P>
Wang proposed the idea to KMT Chairman Ma Ying-jeou during a
meeting that day after the party came up with a draft timetable
that would finalize the party primary for the 2008 presidential
election by April 15.
</P>
<P>
According to the draft timetable, public opinion polls on party
candidates will be held between April 11-13 before a party vote
takes place April 15. Public polls will account for 70 percent of
the primary results, while the party vote will account for the
other 30 percent.
</P>
<P>
Wang said he handed Ma a written statement in which he suggested
that the KMT learn from the U.S. and British systems in terms of
party primaries.
</P>
<P>
Praising those systems, which provide the public and personnel
involved with more time and information before a party primary is
held, Wang said this helps a party seek a general agreement among
its members.
</P>
<P>
With the approach of the next legislative elections, to be held
at the end of the year, Wang suggested that matters concerning
how the party nominate candidates for the legislative seats be
dealt with before it holds the presidential primary.
</P>
<P>
Wang said he has also asked the KMT Central Committee to put the
country's political stability and the KMT's majority status in
the Legislative Yuan as top priorities.
</P>
<P>
"The most important task for the KMT is to win back the hearts of
the people," the KMT stalwart said.
</P>
<P>
While Ma is widely viewed as the opposition "pan-blue alliance's"
best bet for the 2008 presidential election, Wang is also a KMT
heavyweight who wields some influence in the party and is
considered by some supporters as a suitable hopeful.
