PROSECUTORS MAY BE SENT TO U.S. TO PROBE REBAR CASE
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,   Jan.  17  (CNA) 01/17/07  21:35:38 (By Flor Wang)
</P>
<P>
The Taipei Prosecutor's Office, if necessary, will consider the
possibility of sending prosecutors to the United States to probe
a financial scandal involving the Taipei-based Rebar Asia Pacific
Group, office spokesman Lin Chin-chun said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
According to Lin, in line with a Taiwan-U. S. judicial assistance
accord signed in March 2002, Taiwan is entitled to ask the United
States to help investigate the whereabouts and assets of Rebar
Group Chairman Wang You-theng and his wife Chin Shih-ying there.
The two fled Taiwan to China Dec. 30 and from there ran to San
Francisco Jan. 13.
</P>
<P>
Under the terms of the judicial aid agreement, Taiwan can also
send prosecutors to investigate the case.
</P>
<P>
If probe shows that Wang and his wife own assets and real estate
in the United States, the Taipei Prosecutor's Office will ask the
U. S. authorities to freeze their assets there, Lin went on.
</P>
<P>
The couple escaped from Taiwan before two Rebar member companies
applied for bankruptcy protection Jan. 4. The two Rebar firms'
insolvency applications triggered a run on the Chinese Bank,
another Rebar member corporation, the following day.
</P>
<P>
The Taipei Prosecutor's Office issued an arrest warrant for the
Wangs Jan. 15 that will remain valid for 25 years, followed by a
move by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) that invalidated
their Republic of China passports.
</P>
<P>
Although the Taipei Prosecutor's Office has no immediate plans to
send prosecutors to the United States to probe the case, Lin said
that things could change depending on how the situation evolves.
</P>
<P>
Currently, prosecutors are focusing their investigation on the
financial dealings among all Rebar group member companies while
banning 48 related persons, including Wang's children and Rebar
Group executives, from leaving Taiwan, Lin said.
</P>
<P>
MOFA spokesman Wang Chien-yeh said that day that the Taipei
Economic and Cultural Representative Office in the United States
has provided the U. S. authorities with the couple's information
and has asked for U. S. assistance in detaining them.
</P>
<P>
The MOFA is still waiting for a response from the United States
and the ministry has also notified all its overseas outposts that
the couple's ROC passports are invalid, Wang Chien-yeh said.
</P>
<P>
As Chin also serves as honorary consul-general of the Solomon
Islands and St. Kitts and Nevis -- two ROC diplomatic allies --
the two governments must be considering removing her from the
posts, Wang Chien-yeh added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the ROC representative office in the United States
confirmed that it had received the MOFA's notification of the
Rebar scandal and that the ministry has ordered it to ask for U.
S. help in tracing the fugitives.
</P>
<P>
Liao Wei-ping, director of the Taipei Economic and Cultural
Office in San Francisco, said that his office had contacted the
relevant U. S. authorities for help in finding them.
</P>
<P>
Liao also called on Taiwan expatriates in the United States to
offer assistance and clues to bring the fugitives to justice.
