CLA CHIEF TO VISIT WASHINGTON ON FTA PUSH
</HEADLINE>

Washington,   April   13  (CNA) 04/14/07  13:18:35 (By Lin
Chiehyu and Sofia Wu)

Taiwan's  top labor  affairs administrator is set to arrive in
Washington, D.C. Sunday to push for the signing of a free trade
agreement (FTA) between the two countries, trade sources said
Friday.
</P>
<P>
Council of Labor Affairs (CLA) Chairman Lee Ying-yuan will meet
with Bush administration officials, deliver speeches to U.S.
think tanks and lobby congressional support for the signing of an
FTA during his visit, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
According  to the sources,  Lee will focus his talks  on labor-
related topics that are one of the U.S. major concerns in gauging
whether to sign an FTA with Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Previous U.S.  State Department  human rights reports have
mentioned problems in Taiwan's migrant worker management and
welfare services and perks for wage earners. Lee is expected to
brief U.S. officials and think tank scholars on Taiwan's labor
policy and its efforts to improve welfare benefits for both
native wage earners and foreign laborers in the hope of
"clarifying misperceptions and misunderstandings."
</P>
<P>
According to Taiwan officials stationed in Washington, D.C., the
office of the U.S. Trade Representative has never explicitly
stated that Taiwan's labor conditions are a hindrance to the
signing of an FTA.
</P>
<P>
The officials also said that Taiwan's Labor Standards Law
provides "lofty and adequate norms and standards" for treatment
of wage earners.
</P>
<P>
"We believe that Lee's briefing on our achievements in labor
rights protection will contribute to the FTA drive, " said an
official from the Taiwan representative office in Washington,
D.C.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with CNA, John C.C. Deng, Taiwan's deputy
representative to the United States who will soon depart for home
to take over as Taiwan's first top international trade
negotiator, said Lee's U.S. visit is a wise move in the promotion
of an FTA.
</P>
<P>
"The push for a Taiwan-U.S. FTA requires concerted efforts of all
government departments. It would be very helpful if the heads of
various administrative agencies can come to the U.S. capital for
direct dialogue with their American counterparts, " Deng said,
adding that besides  trade and labor  departments, the
Environmental Protection Administration should also send
delegates to Washington, D.C. for direct communications on
Taiwan's needs.
</P>
<P>
According to Lee's itinerary, he will deliver a speech April 17
on upgrading Asian labor standards at the Center for National
Policy, a U.S. think tank dedicated to research and debate on
issues of U.S. national interests. He will also attend a seminar
at the U.S. Heritage Foundation, another Washington-based think
tank.
</P>
<P>
Before wrapping up his trip April 19, Lee will brief Taiwanese
journalists posted in Washington, D.C. on the purposes and
accomplishments of his visit.
