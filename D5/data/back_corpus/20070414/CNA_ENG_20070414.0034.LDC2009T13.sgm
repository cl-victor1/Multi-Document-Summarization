Taipei,  April  14 (CNA) 04/14/07  22:02:31 (By Ruth Wang)

Major pro-Taiwan independence groups organized a protest march in
downtown Taipei Saturday to push for TVBS cable TV station to
shut down and pull out of the Taiwan media market over what they
called the station's repeated unprofessional news reporting.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of their supporters were gathered in front of the
Control Yuan and then marched through several major streets to
reach TVBS head office on Pateh Road where they staged skits to
mock the station and urge it to bow out of the local media
market.
</P>
<P>
The leader of the demonstration, Peter Wang, also read to Premier
Su Tseng-chang a statement carrying three demands for the
Executive Yuan -- to apologize for its mishandling of TVBS, to
terminate the operations  of the  "unconstitutional" National
Communications Commission and to suspend the licenses of
television stations owned partially or fully by China.
</P>
<P>
Wang also accused TVBS of having served as China's spokesman in
Taiwan by frequently making false accusations against government
leaders and broadcasting staged footage to disturb public order.
</P>
<P>
The organizing  groups included the Taiwan Association  of
University Professors, the 908 Taiwan Republic Campaign and the
Taiwan Association for 228 Peace Promotion. Some legislators and
city and county councilors  from the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party-led "pan-green" camp also took part in the
demonstration.
</P>
<P>
A TVBS spokesman refused to comment on the demands but called on
the Taipei city government for better consideration on the impact
of the protest on businesses in the area and on rights of TVBS
employees.
