All of the Taiwan medical aid workers aboard a stricken Taiwanese
fishing boat that hit a reef while conducting relief work for
tsunami victims in the Solomon Islands have been rescued, a
diplomatic official said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
According to Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) spokesman Wang
Chien-yeh, a U.S. Navy helicopter lifted 20 people off the
grounded Yufa 201, including four Taiwanese medical workers.
</P>
<P>
The aid workers were sent by the Taiwan International Health
Action (Taiwan IHA), an ad hoc inter-agency body founded by the
MOFA and the Department  of Health  early last year to help with
international disaster relief work.
</P>
<P>
Quoting Republic of China Ambassador to the Solomon Islands
George Chan, Wang said the Taiwanese fishing vessel had been
returning to the western town of Gizo after delivering aid
supplies to the Pacific island nation's outlying islands Friday
when it hit a reef.
</P>
<P>
Chan immediately asked the Solomon Islands authorities to arrange
for a rescue, Wang said, adding that the U.S. chopper helped lift
the Red Cross workers and the Taiwan IHA team off the ship. "We
were told that our aid workers were safely evacuated, " Wang
said, adding that they have returned to Honiara, capital of the
Solomon Islands.
</P>
<P>
Also rescued from the ship were 13 Red Cross workers from New
Zealand and the Solomon Islands, as well as two patients and an
injured Yufa crew member, he said.
</P>
<P>
The other crewmen remained on the grounded vessel, Wang said,
adding that Chan asked the Solomon Islands' maritime disaster
relief center to seek the assistance of Malaysian ships operating
in the region to help tow the Yufa to a nearby port for repair.
</P>
<P>
The accident came as the Solomon Islands declared April 23 a
national day of mourning for 43 people killed when a
magnitude-8.1 earthquake triggered a tsunami that crashed through
coastal villages earlier this month. Another 7,000 people have
been left homeless. Taiwan has donated funds and sent personnel
to assist in post-tsunami relief and rehabilitation.
