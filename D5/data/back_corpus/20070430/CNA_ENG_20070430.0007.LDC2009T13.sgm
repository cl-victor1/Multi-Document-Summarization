Taipei,  April 30 (CNA) 04/30/07  15:08:41 (By Deborah Kuo)

The Ministry of National Defense (MND) will deal squarely with
personnel who are found to be responsible for the leakage of
information about the 23rd Han Kuang military exercise to be held
in May, an MND official said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Fielding questions at the legislative Defense Committee, Deputy
Defense Minister Ko Chen-heng admitted that part of an Apple
Daily report Monday saying that details of the 23rd Han Kuang
drill can be viewed at the FOXY Web site was correct, including
the time and item names of the drill, but part of the report,
including the names of forces to take part in the exercise, was
wrong.
</P>
<P>
Ko said that investigations into the leakage of the information
have begun and that the personnel responsible will be severely
punished.
</P>
<P>
This marked the fourth time this year that information about the
23rd Han Kuang exercise has allegedly been leaked.
</P>
<P>
The exercise will be based on a simulated scenario regarding the
cross-Taiwan Strait military situation in the year 2010,
according to Chiu Kuo-cheng, an MND deputy chief of the general
staff for operations and planning.
</P>
<P>
In the scenario, Taiwan has to defend itself against a Chinese
invasion attempt launched due to Taiwan's refusal to participate
in unification  talks,  Chiu said,  adding that Taiwan's military
capability in the scenario is the same as at present due to a
lack of progress in terms of arms procurement. He further said
that this year's Han Kuang drill has two phases: full-scale
maneuvers and computer war game simulations.
</P>
<P>
According to Chiu, the full-scale maneuvers will be carried out
in areas of Penghu, Hualien, Yilan, Hsinchu, Taichung, Changhua
and Pingtung as scheduled by the MND, with some of the maneuvers
open to the public to watch at certain times. The computer war
game simulations will proceed for five consecutive days at all
command centers, he added.
