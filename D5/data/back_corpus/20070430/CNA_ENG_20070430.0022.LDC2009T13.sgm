TEXTBOOKS PUT LABORERS IN BAD LIGHT: TEACHERS' GROUP

The textbooks used by the country's high schools present laborers
in a bad light, a teachers' group complained Monday.
</P>
<P>
In a press conference called to mark May 1 Labor Day, Wu Chung-
tai, president of the National Teachers' Association, said the
current textbooks, published by various companies with the
approval of the Ministry of Education, either fail to prepare
students for the labor markets they will face after graduation or
portray laborers and labor unions in an unflattering light.
</P>
<P>
He claimed that all the current textbooks, regardless of their
publishers, are skewed in favor of capitalists, although a
majority of the students who have to use the textbooks are likely
to end up as laborers living on salaries.
</P>
<P>
It is a shame that these textbooks, instead of priming students
with information about laborers' rights, ways to solve labor
disputes and the negative impact brought about by globalization,
offer an unrealistically  rosy  picture  of economic  development
and globalization, Wu went on.
</P>
<P>
Citing examples, labor activist Chen Chu-po said at the news
conference that a history textbook published by the Taiyu Company
for vocational senior high schools "unfairly" lays the blame for
the exodus of local firms in the 1980s on environmentalists and
high labor costs.
</P>
<P>
It is an insult to the country's laborers that textbooks
discriminating against them have been approved by the Ministry of
Education, Chen said.
</P>
<P>
They urged the education authorities to invite labor activists to
sit on its panel responsible for working out guidelines for
compiling textbooks and revise the guidelines to embody respect
for labor rights and instil students with the ideas of socialism.
