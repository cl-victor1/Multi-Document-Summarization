The Council of Labor Affairs (CLA) aims to put in place a monthly
pension system for labor insurance by 2009, CLA Chairman Lee
Ying-yuan said Monday.
</P>
<P>
The trends toward longer life expectancy and fewer kids have made
a pension system more necessary, Lee said at a news conference
held to outline the council's objectives in 2007.
</P>
<P>
Currently the old-age benefit in labor insurance is paid in a
lump sum. The Conference on Sustaining Taiwan's Economic
Development held July agreed to change the system, considered to
be outdated, into a monthly pension system.
</P>
<P>
Lee said he hopes that an amendment to the Labor Insurance Act
will be passed by the end of this year, so as to allow
implementation of the pension system in 2009.

<P>
According to the CLA's calculations under its pension program, a
worker with an insured wage of NT$43,900 will monthly pay NT$483
in labor insurance premiums and, over 22 years from retirement
until death, will be repaid more than 19 times over for the total
premiums paid over 40 years of work.
