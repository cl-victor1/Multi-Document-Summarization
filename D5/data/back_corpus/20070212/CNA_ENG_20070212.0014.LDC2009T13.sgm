One of the 2008 presidential election hopefuls of the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) expressed the hope Monday that
the process of selecting the party's candidate for the election
will follow the current primary system as much as possible.
</P>
<P>
Former Premier Frank Hsieh made the remarks when he met with
grass-roots DPP members in Hualien, eastern Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Hsieh said the DPP should have "teamwork in mind" and choose a
candidate who has the best chance of winning the election, while
the others help with the election campaign.
</P>
<P>
"None of the hopefuls should have a 'zero-sum' mindset," he said,
adding that not having this mindset would make the hopefuls more
relaxed in taking part in the party's primary.
</P>
<P>
Hsieh also said that primary regulations should not be changed
unless agreement on the matter is reached among all the hopefuls.
</P>
<P>
"To change the rules of the game after it starts will not work in
democratic politics," he added.
</P>
<P>
Hsieh is one of the four DPP heavyweights said to be keen on
representing the party to run in the 2008 presidential election.
The other three are Vice President Annette Lu, Premier Su Tseng-
chang and DPP Chairman Yu Shyi-kun.
