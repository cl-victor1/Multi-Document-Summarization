A spokeswoman for opposition Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU) told
the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) government Monday that
rectifying Taiwan's national title tops all other name-change
efforts.

Commenting the ongoing campaign aimed at changing the names of
state-owned enterprises to avoid people mistaking Taiwan
companies for Chinese  ones, Chiang Yueh-chin  said the TSU lauds
the government's determination to fortify Taiwan's national
identity by pushing for the changes, but considers the efforts
made by the government "hasty,  not delicate enough and lacking
sufficient communication."
</P>
<P>
Chiang said the TSU considers rectifying Taiwan's national title
is the  most important.  As the  DPP administration-initiated
constitutional amendments have raised the threshold for revising
the Constitution to allow for a change of the national title,
Chiang said she remains skeptical of the DPP government's
sincerity to reach that goal.
