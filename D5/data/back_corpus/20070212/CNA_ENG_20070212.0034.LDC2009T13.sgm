Opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Honorary Chairman Lien Chan
reiterated Monday a call for party unity if it wants to regain
power in the 2008 presidential election, but he did not volunteer
to coordinate a presidential candidate within the party,
Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng said later that same day.

<P>
According to Wang, Lien invited him to the meeting and the KMT
honorary chairman issued the call during their hour-long closed-
door discussion. But Wang added that Lien did not say he would
help coordinate the KMT's presidential candidacy between KMT
Chairman Ma Ying-jeou and Wang himself. Wang is also a KMT
stalwart.

<P>
The Lien-Wang meeting came at a sensitive time as Ma, the former
mayor of Taipei who ended his tenure in December last year and
who is the KMT's most likely candidate in the 2008 presidential
race, is being investigated for his alleged misuse of special
municipal funds earmarked for his discretionary use during his
mayoral term.
</P>
<P>
Speaking with a group of reporters earlier that same day at the
Legislative Yuan, Wang said that the party's unity must be built
upon sincerity and consensus through discussion and coordination
and that the KMT must not deceive itself if it hopes to achieve
that aim.
</P>
<P>
Wang's remarks came after Ma said during a meeting with a group
of farmers at the KMT's Taitung County chapter in eastern Taiwan
that it is better to conduct intra-party negotiations when the
party's aspirants in the 2008 presidential election have all
publicly announced their bids.
</P>
<P>
"Winning back power for the KMT was one of my promises made to
KMT members when I took part in the party's chairmanship election
in 2005," Ma emphasized. He made it clear that "the KMT cannot
afford to have another split" and that "the party must field only
one ticket to run in the 2008 presidential race."
