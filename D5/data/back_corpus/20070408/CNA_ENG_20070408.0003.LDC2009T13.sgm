People First Party (PFP) Chairman James Soong who flew to San
Francisco after ending up in a far behind third place in the
election of Taipei mayor last December, will return to Taipei
Tuesday, PFP lawmaker Daniel Hwang said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Hwang said he and other PFP lawmakers believed Soong who declared
his quit from politics after the Dec. 7 election will pull his
weight in pushing for the cooperation of PFP and Kuomintang in
the forthcoming legislative elections. After leaving the island
for four months, Hwang said he is sure that Soong has figured out
some ways to help the country and his party or he would not come
back at this time.
</P>
<P>
He would not elaborate on whether Soong will help Kuomintang and
PFP to enter joint candidates with the best hope in the year end
legislative election or whether Soong will use his personal
influence to push for the cooperation between the two KMT
presidential hopefuls, former KMT chief Ma Ying-jeou and
Legislative Speaker Wang Jin-pyng, in the 2008 presidential
election.
