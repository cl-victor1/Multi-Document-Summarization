The government plans to build wind power generators on the seas
surrounding the island in the near future after it has installed
over 100 such facilities on land as part of its standing efforts
to develop renewable energy sources, the minister of economic
affairs said Saturday.

Steve R. L. Chen revealed the plan at a forum organized by the
Chinese-language Economic Daily News on strategies in the face of
the approaching era of high oil prices. He said that the
government has set the target of 10 percent of the power
generated in Taiwan coming from renewable energy sources by the
year of 2010.

<P>
At present, only 8 percent of the total amount of power generated
in the country is from renewable energy sources, Chen said,
noting there is still a lot of work to do in this regard.
</P>
<P>
While Taiwan has to import 98 percent of the energy it needs, the
island must take precautions against increasing energy prices in
the international market due to the growing energy shortage
around the globe, Chen said.
</P>
<P>
In this regard, Chen said, the government has never ceased in its
efforts to develop renewable energy sources and has worked out
plans that focus on the development of wind power.

Addressing the government's efforts in reducing greenhouse gas
emissions in accordance with a worldwide effort to slow down
global warming, the minister said that a draft bill on greenhouse
gas emissions reduction has been sent to the Legislative Yuan for
review and that the government will soon finalize a draft bill on
energy taxation, based on the "pay-per-use" principle.
