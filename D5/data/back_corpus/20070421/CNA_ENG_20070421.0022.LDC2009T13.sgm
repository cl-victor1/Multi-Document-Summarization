U.S.-TAIWAN BUSINESS COUNCIL WELCOMES TAIWAN'S DECISION ON PROMOS
</HEADLINE>

Washington,  April 20 (CNA) 04/21/07  21:13:59 (By Jorge Liu and

The U.S.-Taiwan Business Council said Friday that it welcomes
Taiwan's approval for ProMOS Technologies to build an advanced
0.18-micron chip manufacturing facility in China.
</P>
<P>
Rupert Hammond-Chambers, president of the council which is
comprised of a large network of companies involved in business
between Taiwan and the United States, said that this is "an
important and timely decision."
</P>
<P>
He said that it is vital that leading Taiwan companies like
ProMOS are able to actively compete and offer their expertise in
all markets around the world, including China's.
</P>
<P>
But he also said that "it remains critical for the Taiwan
government  to develop a clear,  consistent  process for such
investments, and to finalize and release new guidelines for the
semiconductor industry to replace those that expired in December
2005."
</P>
<P>
He also urged Taiwan's government to remove the 40 percent equity
cap on Taiwan investments in China, saying that "Taiwan does not
have the luxury to delay such efforts while its regional
competitors continue to innovate and reform. "
</P>
<P>
He contended that present barriers to cross-strait investment are
hurting Taiwan companies, and by extension their U.S. partners,
while a liberalized and transparent cross-strait economic
relationship would be beneficial no only for Taiwan but also for
the many partner companies that rely on Taiwan to research,
design, and manufacturer a myriad of goods for consumption in the
global market.
</P>
<P>
ProMOS Technologies became the second company to be granted
approval by the Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) since the
government allowed Taiwan semiconductor  manufacturers  to move
0.18-micron chip manufacturing technology to China in December
2006. The MOEA gave Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. the
green light to use 0.18-micron chip manufacturing technology in
its factory in Shanghai last month.
