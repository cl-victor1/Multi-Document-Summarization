CONSTRUCTION OF EXPRESSWAY HINGES ON ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT:
PREZ

Taipei,  April 21 (CNA) 04/21/07  17:08:10 (By Lilian Wu)

President Chen Shui-bian said Saturday that the construction of
an expressway to connect Suao and Hualien in eastern Taiwan is
necessary but that a prerequisite for its construction  is the
project passing  an environmental  impact assessment.
</P>
<P>
The president made the remarks while addressing the opening of an
NGO-sponsored environmental protection conference in Taipei.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the government's set policy is to establish
an islandwide expressway  network and that the planned Suhua
expressway will be a crucial part of it.
</P>
<P>
But he stressed that if the project fails an environmental impact
assessment, it will have to be aborted, saying that "this is the
government's unequivocal stance and the stance of past and
present premiers."
</P>
<P>
The president's remarks came in the wake of a recent spat among
three presidential contenders of the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party -- namely Premier Su Tseng-chang and his
predecessors Frank Hsieh and Yu Shyi-kun -- on who should
shoulder the biggest responsibility for the stalling of the long-
discussed project.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, environmental activists have blasted what they
called myopic politicians for using the expressway project as a
pork barrel ploy to win voter support in elections without being
aware of the disastrous impact on eastern Taiwan's ecology and
tourism that the highway's construction would have.
</P>
<P>
Construction of the Suhua expressway was one of Chen's campaign
promises in the presidential elections in 2000 and 2004.
</P>
<P>
Chen pointed out that there are already two freeways, an
expressway, a railway and a high speed railway in western Taiwan.
The Peiyi (Taipei-Yilan) expressway has also been inaugurated,
making travel from any point in western Taiwan to Yilan in
northeastern Taiwan within one day a reality.
</P>
<P>
In comparison, eastern Taiwan has only one major railway system,
which has yet to go electric, Chen said. If the planned Suhua
expressway project is aborted, the imbalance in development
between eastern and western Taiwan will be even more apparent, he
added.
</P>
<P>
Chen said that construction of the expressway is the will of the
people of Hualien.
</P>
<P>
"Although I said previously that if there is conflict between
economic development and environmental protection, I would rather
choose the latter, it will be a stripping of the Hualien people's
rights to pursue prosperity if the government insists on opposing
the project even if it is determined that the impact on the
environment will not be that big," the president said.
