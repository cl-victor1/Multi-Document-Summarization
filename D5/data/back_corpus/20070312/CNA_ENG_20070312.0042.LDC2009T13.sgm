Taipei,  March 12 (CNA) 03/12/07  21:48:47 (By T.C. Jiang)
</P>
<P>
The number of cases of domestic violence and sex abuse reported
over the past three years has risen, according to officials from
the Taipei city government's Department of Health.
</P>
<P>
Around 40 percent of the victims in both categories of assault
did not go to hospital to document their injuries, officials
said.
</P>
<P>
The remarks came after the officials  published statistics
collected from the capital citys domestic violence and sexual
assault prevention center and 23 hospitals.
</P>
<P>
The statistics show that last year the number of children and
teenagers subject to domestic violence accounted for 8.4 percent
of such reported cases, while that of those who were sexually
abused made up 45 percent of sexual assault cases, officials
noted.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the officials pointed out that men could also be the
victims as the number of male domestic violence victims
represented 18 percent of the total number of domestic assault
cases, while male sexual abuse victims came in at 4 percent of
that class of assault.
</P>
<P>
The total number of both cases reported by the 23 hospitals saw a
17 percent increase from 3,784 in 2004 to 5,317 in 2006,
officials stated.
</P>
<P>
However, the centers statistics indicate that the total number of
both cases had risen from 6,075 in 2004 to 9,202 in 2006, the
officials stated, adding that this indicates that around 40
percent of the victims did not go to hospital to document their
injuries.
</P>
<P>
Some did not go because they hesitated or they thought that their
injuries were not serious, officials explained.
</P>
<P>
In many cases, it was not until weeks or months later that they
began to ask doctors to document their injuries, officials noted.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that around 60 percent of the victims did not
report to the police immediately.
</P>
<P>
Noting that many young victims did not know how to seek
assistance, the officials urged their neighbors or school
teachers to lend a hand by taking victims to the hospital.
</P>
<P>
The center will also help victims with the medical expenses,
officials added.
