Taipei, March 12 (CNA) 03/12/07  21:08:39 (By Luis Huang)

<P>
President Chen Shui-bian called Monday for the Italian government
to extend the visa-free privilege to Taiwanese citizens wishing
to visit that European country as a measure to facilitate
bilateral exchanges.
</P>
<P>
Chen made the appeal while meeting with visiting Italian Senator
Gustavo Selva, who also serves as chairman of a pro-Taiwan group
in the Italian parliament.
</P>
<P>
"Taiwan has granted a 30-day visa-free treatment to Italian
visitors, and I hope that the Italian government will extend the
same privilege  to the people  of Taiwan  under the principle  of
reciprocity", Chen told his guest.
</P>
<P>
Noting that this is Selva's ninth visit to Taiwan, Chen said
Selva, one of Taiwan's staunch friends, set up the pro-Taiwan
group in 1984 and was re-elected senator and chairman of the
organization last year.
</P>
<P>
Chen said he is confident  that under Selva's leadership,
substantive relations between Taiwan and Italy will be further
strengthened in the near future.
</P>
<P>
Chen thanked Selva for his efforts to assist the nation's ranking
officials in making stopovers in Italy during their foreign
trips, saying that with the senator's help, Vice President
Annette made a transit stop in Italy in March 2002 and he himself
had the chance of traveling to the Vatican to attend Pope John
Paul II's funeral in April 2005.
</P>
<P>
The president also spoke highly of Selva' full support for
Taiwan's participation in international organizations. Thanks to
his efforts, the Italian government did not express opposition to
Taiwan's bid to join the United Nations last year and the Chamber
of Deputies adopted a resolution in favor of the nation's joining
the World Health Organization as an observer.
</P>
<P>
Touching on bilateral economic and trade relations, Chen said
Italy is Taiwan's fifth-largest trading partner in Europe and
that the two countries have completed the first round of
negotiations on an agreement to avoid double taxation.
</P>
<P>
The president voiced hope that both parties will work hard to
finalize and sign such an accord as soon as possible.
