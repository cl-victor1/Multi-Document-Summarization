VOTE RECOUNT FOR KAOHSIUNG MAYORAL ELECTION BEGINS
</HEADLINE>

Kaohsiung,  March  12 (CNA) 03/12/07  16:17:14 (By Lilian Wu)

<P>
A vote recount for last December's Kaohsiung mayoral election
began at the Kaohsiung District Court amid tightened security
Monday.
</P>
<P>
The vote recount was ordered by Kaohsiung District Court
following a lawsuit brought forth by Huang Chun-ying to
invalidate the election result. Huang, the main opposition
Kuomintang's candidate in the Dec. 9 election, was defeated by
the Democratic Progressive Party's Chen Chu by a razor-thin
margin of 1,114 votes.
</P>
<P>
Tu Yu-tou, head of the administrative division of Kaohsiung
District Court, explained that the recount will include checking
the number of eligible voters, the number of ballots claimed, the
number of ballots claimed but not cast into the ballot boxes, and
the number of empty ballots that had not been claimed, as well as
determining which ballots are valid and invalid.
</P>
<P>
The vote recount is expected to be completed in six days, with
the results to then be turned over to the court to make a final
decision, Tu said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that nearly 50 judges are taking part in the vote
recount and that around 350 police officers have been mobilized
to maintain order daily.
</P>
<P>
Since neither the Kaohsiung District Court nor the police
department have a special budget to cover the costs of the
recount, the court will ask the Judicial Yuan to do so, he added.
</P>
<P>
Twenty teams are carrying out the vote recount over the six-day
period, with each team comprised of a judge, a court clerk, two
election staff members, and one or two lawyers or representatives
from the Huang and Chen camps.
</P>
<P>
Chou Chun-lai, a lawyer hired by Chen, said that he personally
thinks the chances of the election result being overturned are
slim given what he called the "flimsy evidence" which Huang's
camp used as a basis for filing the election suit.
</P>
<P>
Huang, who went to a KMT chapter near Kaohsiung court Monday
morning, said he will respect the results of the vote recount and
the court's decision in stride.
</P>
<P>
According to the Code of Civil Procedure, Huang has paid NT$4.75
million (US$144,000) toward the vote recount in advance, with the
losing party in the lawsuit having to shoulder the costs of the
vote recount after the court hands down its decision in the case.
