Newly released Warner Bros. film "300" -- a story about how 300
Spartans led by their king fought bravely against a huge Persian
army in the fifth century B.C. -- has set a first-week box record
in Taiwan for March, with revenues totaling NT$50 million
(US$1.51 million).
</P>
<P>
The amount is second only to the first-week total of NT$62
million set by "Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest" in
July last year when students were enjoying their summer vacation.
</P>
<P>
Movie house owners said they were surprised that "300" was able
to achieve such box office success without the blessing of a long
weekend or the attraction of famous movie stars appearing in
leading roles.
</P>
<P>
Some owners indicated that they had to add extra midnight
showings to meet the demand represented by long queues of patrons
who could not get tickets to earlier screenings.
</P>
<P>
The film, directed By Zack Snyder, is based on a graphic novel by
Frank Miller that depicts the legendary Battle of Thermopylae and
serves as an example of what courage and self-sacrifice could
achieve.
</P>
<P>
King Leonidas, played by Scottish actor Gerard Butler, and his
300 elite Spartan soldiers fought bravely to the death against a
quarter-million-man Persian army to defend the Pass of
Thermopylae in August 480 B.C. in an attempt to delay the enemy
approaching their homeland.
