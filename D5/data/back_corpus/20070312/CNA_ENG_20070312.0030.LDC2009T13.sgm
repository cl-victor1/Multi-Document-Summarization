Taipei,  March 12 (CNA) 03/12/07  19:23:48 (By Flor Wang)

In response to a report that a prominent opposition figure will
visit China in April and that he might ink a key document with
Chinese officials, Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) Chairman Joseph
Wu pointed out Monday that the government is the sole authority
empowered to handle foreign affairs issues.
</P>
<P>
Wu made the remarks at a seminar sponsored by the China Times
daily newspaper on the second anniversary of the anti-secession
law Beijing enacted March 14, 2005 to provide it with a legal
basis to use force against Taiwan if Taiwan declares formal
independence. A dozen China experts also took part in the event.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that main opposition Kuomintang (KTM) Honorary
Chairman Lien Chan will visit China in mid-April and that he
might ink a "key document" with Chinese President and Communist
Party of China (CPC) Secretary-General Hu Jintao to outline major
principles regarding cross-Taiwan Strait peace. It would the
third meeting between Lien and Hu since 2005.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the speculation, Wu noted that only the government
can deal with issues related to foreign policy or foreign
relations and that no private sector organizations are entitled
to replace the government sector in this regard.
</P>
<P>
Since Beijing's passage of its anti-secession law, Taiwan's
people are highly suspicious about activities held by the KMT and
the CPC, as the results of the first closed-door meeting between
Lien and Hu in Beijing remain secret, Wu said.
</P>
<P>
The MAC, Taiwan's highest agency in crafting the country's China
policy, will keep a close watch on related developments if Lien
visits China and signs an accord with Chinese officials,  Wu
emphasized.
</P>
<P>
The MAC head expressed hope that Taiwan's opposition and ruling
camps can gain a better understanding of each other and cooperate
better in the future instead of being constantly at loggerheads.
</P>
<P>
Chen Ming-tung, a China hand and a professor at National Taiwan
University who also attended the seminar, called on the
government to quickly work out measures to deal with the
situation if Lien and Hu meet and clinch a new accord.
