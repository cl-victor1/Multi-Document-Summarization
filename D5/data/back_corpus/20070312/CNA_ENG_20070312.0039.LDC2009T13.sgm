Kaohsiung County Magistrate Yang Chiou-hsing feasted Meinung
Township's 160 coreopsis flower growers in recognition of
contributions to the county's tourism industry brought by their
cultivation of the beautiful coreopsis, an official of the
county's Bureau of Agriculture said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Meinung Township's beautiful coreopsis flowers have attracted
over 200,000 flower-enthusiasts to visit the county this year,
according to the bureau's estimation, and thus indirectly helped
local Hakka restaurants profit during the Chinese New Year
holiday, which is when the coreopsis are in full bloom.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman pointed out that raising coreopsis in the fallow
winter period began three years ago. With visitors' praise and
appreciation, the area dedicated to its cultivation increased
rapidly from first year's 23 hectares to second year's 35
hectares, and 50 hectares in the third year.

<P>
Yang said at the luncheon that he wanted to thank the flower
growers for their hard work, drawing crowds of visitors, and
nurturing of the fields as coreopsis can be turned into green
fertilizer after flowering.
</P>
<P>
According to the spokesman, Yang also invited school principles
to join next year's "painting the land" activity during which the
county will be divided into five zones growing different kinds of
flowers to decorate the land. With well- designed sightseeing
routes,  the activity will include solutions to the flower
season's traffic problems to accommodate greater numbers of
visitors.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that as the flower season comes to an end,
many visitors are seizing on their last chance to take in the
beauty of Meinung Township's coreopsis.
