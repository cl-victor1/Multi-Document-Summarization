PETROLEUM COMPANY SHOULD DELVE INTO RELOCATION ISSUE: CEPD HEAD
</HEADLINE>

Taipei, March 12 (CNA) 03/12/07  21:57:54 (By Flor Wang)

The state-run CPC Corp. Taiwan -- Taiwan's major petroleum
product provider, should endeavor to make itself the "pride of
Kaohsiung" through the relocation issue, Council for Economic
Planning and Development (CEPD) Chairwoman Ho Mei- yueh said
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Ho made the remarks at the Legislative Yuan while answering
lawmakers' questions about the Executive Yuan's plan to relocate
some of the government agencies and state-owned companies to
central or southern Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
The CPC has been specifically targeted by the central government
to move its headquarters from Taipei to Kaohsiung, an industrial
hub in southern Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
According to Ho, the Ministry of Economic Affairs has the final
say on the CPC's relocation, but added that the state-owned
concern should delve into the issue and make itself a "pride of
Kaohsiung citizens" because of its close links with the city. The
CPC's refineries are all located in the southern port city.
</P>
<P>
If the CPC fails to move its headquarters to Kaohsiung, such a
development would mean in turn that the company's efforts to
integrate with local communities are unsuccessful, she said.
</P>
<P>
Lee Chia-chin, a lawmaker of the main opposition Kuomintang
(KMT), said that the lawmakers from the various political parties
are open to the CPC's relocation proposal so long as the
Executive Yuan is able to convince the public that it will help
create economic benefits.
</P>
<P>
The Executive Yuan must not rashly push through the matter, and
should be careful to prevent backlash from the public and CPC
workers, Lee urged.
</P>
<P>
KMT lawmaker Lai Shyi-bao accused the Executive Yuan of rehashing
the issue to gain political points, as it is very questionable
that a relocation would help the company increase its production
output.
</P>
<P>
The top concern the government should focus on, Lai said, finding
ways to help Taiwan workers increase their salaries as their
real-term earnings grew just by 0.6 percent over the past six
years.
</P>
<P>
"I would fully support the relocations of the CPC or Taiwan Power
Co. (Taipower) if they can help bring about handsome growth for
businesses," he added.
</P>
<P>
Later the same day, Minister of Economic Affairs Steve R. L. Chen
said that the relocation proposals for the two state-run
enterprises must be studied from a professional viewpoint.
</P>
<P>
But Chen was reluctant to comment on the results of two surveys
on the relocation issue conducted by the worker unions of the two
companies.
</P>
<P>
As many as 84.3 percent of the Taipower's 2,419 workers at the
company's Taipei head office participated in the survey, with 89
percent of them objecting to the relocation idea, far ahead of
8.3 percent who voiced support, the survey found.
</P>
<P>
Some 90 percent of the CPC workers at its Taipei headquarters are
also opposed to the proposed relocation, according to survey
results.
