</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  March 12 (CNA) 03/12/07  19:02:52 (By Flor Wang)
</P>
<P>
A march originally planned for March 17 and touted as being
"against ethnic rift to safeguard the Republic of China" will be
postponed to March 31 to allow a larger number of public to take
part, main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Legislator John Chiang
said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Chiang made the announcement at a news conference, accompanied by
several other KMT legislators, including legislative caucus whip
Hsu Shao-ping,  KMT Policy Coordination  Committee  Director
Tseng Yung-chuan, Shuai Hua-ming, Pan Wei- kang and Chou Shou-
hsun.
</P>
<P>
According to Chiang, the march he initiated will be put off to
March 31 and a gathering will be held on Ketagalan Boulevard in
front of the Presidential Office that day to accommodate more
people willing to take part. He encouraged those attending to
dress in blue to express their dissatisfaction with the
government and the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP).
</P>
<P>
Chiang said that he decided to make the activity a bigger event
because of warm response from members of the public who are
opposed to the DPP government's scheme to purge Taiwan of the
lingering influence of the late President Chiang Kai-shek and to
its fanning of ethnic disputes.
</P>
<P>
On March 31, crowds will gather around the Chiang Kai-shek (CKS)
Memorial Hall complex near the Presidential Office to underscore
their resolve to protect historical facts and display their anger
with the government's fueling of ethnic rows.
</P>
<P>
Tseng blasted the Executive Yuan's intention to downgrade the
status of the CKS Memorial Hall to help push through a name
change proposal for the monument that would not require approval
by the Legislative Yuan.
</P>
<P>
The KMT will back the March 31 assembly, Tseng said.
</P>
<P>
The Executive Yuan and the DPP have recently rekindled a name
change drive aimed at state-run enterprises and facilities that
carry the word "China" or "Chinese" in their official titles.
</P>
<P>
China Steel Co., is the latest in a string of companies that have
come under strong pressure from the Executive Yuan to alter their
names following the lead set by three state-owned  companies,
including  the country's postal service and petroleum  product
providers and shipbuilder.
