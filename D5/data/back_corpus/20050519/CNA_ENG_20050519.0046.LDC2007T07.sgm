TAIWAN TO BE AIDED BY U.S. IN DEVELOPING FLU VACCINE: DOH
</HEADLINE>

Geneva, May 19 (CNA) (By Neil Lu &amp; Maubo Chang)

<P>
The United States promised to help Taiwan to develop influenza vaccine
in a meeting of bilateral health officials on the sidelines of the
World Health Assembly (WHA) in Geneva, a Taiwan health official said
here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Kuo Hsu-shung, director-general of the Center for Disease Control
under the Department of Health, said his U.S. counterpart Dr. Julie
Louise Gerberding made the promise in a meeting with Taiwan's Health
Minister Hou Sheng-mou in Geneva the previous day and asked Taiwan to
join a network in the Asia-Pacific region against a possible flu
pandemic.
</P>
<P>
Kuo quoted Gerberding as agreeing to provide Taiwan with the avian
influenza virus H5N1 and the standard process of handling it that will
eliminate an obstacle in Taiwan's program to produce flu vaccine by
itself.
</P>
<P>
In anticipation of a flu pandemic, the United States is worried about
a vaccine shortage because only developed countries currently have the
capability of producing the vaccine.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan, is the first developing country ever to try to manufacture the
vaccine by itself, and has set aside NT$6 billion (US$192.8 million)
for the program, with NT$1.5 billion as a grant to laboratories for
the construction of vaccine plants, and NT$4.5 billion to buy the
vaccine they produce, Kuo said.
</P>
<P>
The H5N1 avian flu virus, which has prompted outbreaks of avian flu in
Asia in the last few years and has baffled all efforts to produce a
vaccine thus far, is the most likely cause for the next flu pandemic,
Kuo said, adding this makes Taiwan's influenza vaccine development
program all the more significant.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the United States has urged the WHA to brace for the
pandemic, establish cooperation networks and beef up the exchanges of
medical information, Kuo said Taiwan has accumulated a lot of
experience in these three fields and could play an active role in
supporting the United States.
</P>
<P>
Hou said he had been looking forward to a meeting with U.S. Department
of Health and Human Services Secretary Mike Leavitt, but had to settle
for a meeting with Gerberding after Leavitt left Geneva on urgent
business.
