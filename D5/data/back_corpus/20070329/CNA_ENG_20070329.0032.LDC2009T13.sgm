Taiwanese researchers have refined an optical frequency measuring
technique to offer a precise means of measuring lasers with a
wavelength between 1050-2100 nanometers, according to the Bureau
of Standards, Metrology and Inspection (BSMI) under the Ministry
of Economic Affairs.

BSMI researchers said Thursday that the new method -- dubbed the
"dual-comb absolute optical frequency measurement" -- utilizes
two mode-locked laser combs to streamline the conventional
measuring process, the improved technique opens the door to the
possibility of developing compact, portable measurement
equipment.

Multinational corporations lead by a large margin in the field of
radio frequency measurement, they noted. However, optical
frequency measurement is a relatively unexplored arena in which
Taiwanese companies still have a good chance making a head start.

BSMI indicated in a press release that the new technique could
offer a springboard for the local optical communications industry
in terms of the research and development of optical frequency
counter, optical frequency synthesizer, and high-resolution
optical frequency spectrum analyzer.
