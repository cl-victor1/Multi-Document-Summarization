President Chen Shui-bian presided over a spring memorial service
Thursday for those who died in battle for the Republic of China,
as well as those who lost their life safeguarding people's lives
and property.
</P>
<P>
Chen performed the ceremony in the company of Legislative Yuan
Speaker Wang Jin- pyng and Judicial Yuan President Wung Yueh-
sheng at the Martyr's Shrine in Yuanshan in suburban Taipei.
After the National Anthem ended, Chen burned incense, laid a
wreath and bowed three times to the altars of the nation's
martyrs.
</P>
<P>
Also attending the ceremony were high-ranking officials of the
central and local governments, elected representatives, military
officers and offspring of the martyrs.
</P>
<P>
Also at the Martyr's Shrine, Taipei Mayor Hau Lung-bin presided
over a ceremony to enshrine Tzeng Kuo-hsiung, a police officer
from the northern county of Hsinchu who died while trying to
rescue people trapped by a landslide caused by typhoon Aili that
swept through Taiwan Aug. 24, 2004.
</P>
<P>
Tzeng was swept away by the landslide and his body has never been
found. The Hsinchu District Court ruled one year after the
accident that the policeman died in the line of duty.
</P>
<P>
Tzeng's widow and children all participated in the ceremony,
which included a 19-gun salute. Hau presented them with a plaque
marking the enshrinement.
