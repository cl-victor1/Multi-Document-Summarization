DPP PRIMARY SYSTEM 'UNFAVORABLE' TO REFORMISTS: FORMER LAWMAKER
</HEADLINE>

Taipei, April 22 (CNA) 04/22/07  19:09:13 (By Han Nai-kuo)
</P>
<P>
Opinion polls conducted under the current system of the ruling
Democratic Party (DPP) to determine nominees for 2007  year-end
legislative  elections  are "unfavorable"  to reform-minded
candidates, a former DPP lawmaker said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
At a ceremony marking the formal establishment of his campaign
office, Lin Cho- shui, who resigned as legislator in November
last year to protest the DPP's handling  of a corruption  scandal
implicating President Chen Shui-bian and his wife, said he hopes
he can win an extra legislative seat for the DPP by competing in
Taipei's No. 1 electoral district.
</P>
<P>
Lin claimed,  however,  that the DPP's primary  system is
unfavorable to him and other reformists.
</P>
<P>
He expressed fear that the DPP might win only one seat in all the
electoral districts in the city of Taipei.
</P>
<P>
Lin is a former member of the disbanded New Tide Faction within
the DPP.
</P>
<P>
New Tide members  were known for their  outspokenness  in
criticizing DPP policies and actions and voicing alternatives.
</P>
<P>
Other former  members  of the New Tide Faction, including
Legislator Hung Chi- chang and former DPP Legislator Tuan Yi-
kang, were on hand to extend their congratulations.
</P>
<P>
Tuan, former chief convener of New Tide, told reporters that the
DPP's primary system is "seriously flawed" and that nominees
selected under such a system would face considerable difficulties
in the legislative election.
</P>
<P>
Nominations of candidates during the DPP's primary hinge to a
large degree on opinion polls to determine the approval ratings
of the candidates. The poll results account for 70 percent in the
final calculation of candidate ratings.
</P>
<P>
The DPP's Central Standing Committee has decided to exclude 50
percent of voters and survey the opinion of only those who have
voted for candidates of the DPP and its ally, the Taiwan
Solidarity Union, in the last three elections.
