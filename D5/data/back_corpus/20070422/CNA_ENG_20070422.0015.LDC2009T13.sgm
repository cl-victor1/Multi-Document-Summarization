WIND ENERGY CUTS CO2 EMISSIONS IN TAIWAN BY 250,000 TONS A YEAR

<P>
The number of wind turbines along Taiwan's west coast now
surpasses 100, and the renewable energy generated by these units
is sufficient to prevent the emission of 250,000 tons of carbon
dioxide a year, energy officials said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
At a ceremony held in the Changhua Coastal Industrial Park to
promote the use of wind power, officials from the Bureau of
Energy under the Ministry of Economic Affairs said the 103 giant
wind turbines located in 13 wind farms along Taiwan's west coast
can generate 420 million kilowatt-hours of electricity a year --
enough to power 105,000 households.
</P>
<P>
The windmills were established by Taiwan Power Co. (Taipower),
the private-run Tien-Lung Paper Co. and InfraVest Wind Power
Group, a German company which entered the market in 2000 as the
first wind farm builder in Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
According to the officials, more windmills are under construction
in west coastal areas and the outlying island group of Penghu,
with an additional total capacity of 500 megawatts. Each unit
will cost at least NT$100 million.
</P>
<P>
They said Taiwan's coastal areas are ideal for the development of
wind power because they have six months of strong northwest winds
each year, with an average wind speed of five to six meters per
second.
</P>
<P>
The Bureau of Energy has set the target of generating enough
renewable energy to meet 10 percent of Taiwan's electricity needs
by 2010, with wind power making up 80 percent of the renewable
energy.
</P>
<P>
Taipower, the sole electricity supplier in Taiwan, began to
harness wind energy in 2002 and plans to establish 200 wind
turbines in Taiwan and Penghu by 2010.
</P>
<P>
Taipower's long-term wind power development plant will build an
additional 546 wind turbines between 2010 and 2020 in shallow
waters off Taiwan's west coast and Penghu, with a total capacity
of 1,980 megawatts at an estimated cost of NT$200 million each.
</P>
<P>
Out of the 546 windmills, 176 will be built off Penghu, and the
electricity generated by these units will be transmitted to
Taiwan through a 40-km undersea cable.
</P>
<P>
The other 370 units will be established 10 to 15 km off the coast
of Changhua and Yunlin counties, according to Taipower.
