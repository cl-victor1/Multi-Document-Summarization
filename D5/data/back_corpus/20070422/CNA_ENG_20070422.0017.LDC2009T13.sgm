Medical representatives proposed Sunday that district community
hospitals should transform into senior care centers in response
to the advent of an aging society, thereby solving many problems
associated with challenges to hospitals' survival in the face of
shrinking market share.
</P>
<P>
The current environment favors the development of large hospitals
and physician clinics, making medium and small hospitals less
competitive,  said representatives at a symposium organized by
National Health Research Institutes and Cardinal Tien Hospital
Yung Ho branch.
</P>
<P>
Such hospitals have been left with no option but to increase
their utilization to generate additional income, the
representatives said, adding that while the proportion of
Taiwan's aged population has soared significantly and now
accounts for 10 percent of the total population, it is estimated
in 20 years one out five citizens will be a senior; that rapidly
aging population is expected to stimulate the demand for elder
care services.
</P>
<P>
A veteran health care professional said that the elderly tend to
have chronic illnesses, such as high blood pressure, stoke,
diabetes, cataract, osteoporosis and dementia, and that the older
adults often have multiple chronic diseases for which they
require a variety of medications and treatments.
</P>
<P>
She added that on average each older person takes four types of
medications daily, with others taking as many as six types of
medication. Although there are 261 sick beds provided by nursing
homes for every 10,000 seniors, only 197 beds have been used on
average because most of the aged wish to stay home in the company
of their families.
</P>
<P>
A representative devoted in senior health care research said that
senior care services offered in advanced countries feature
integrated local medical treatments, and in-home care and social
resources.
</P>
<P>
Under the sponsorship of the Department of Health, a total of 16
hospitals around the country have launched projects aimed at
providing integrated senior health care services, including
Chiayi Christian Hospital and Cardinal Tien Hospital Yung Ho
branch.
