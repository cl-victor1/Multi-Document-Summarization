The Ministry of Justice (MOJ) reported Sunday that 3,114 new
cases of domestic violence were reported to the prosecution last
year, with abusers, mostly males, coming from all age groups.
</P>
<P>
According to the MOJ, most of the offenders and victims were
husbands and wives. A vast majority of 71 percent of the abusers
were jobless men or laborers with low levels of education, and
range in age from teens to over 60. On average, only one in 12
abusers is female.
</P>
<P>
Among male abusers, those aged between 30-50 accounted for 67.5
percent; minors below 20 and elderly over 60 making up of 0.1
percent and 4.8 percent, respectively, the MOI reported.
</P>
<P>
Some 49 percent of those responsible for domestic violence were
illiterate or had only an elementary-level education. Only 29.5
percent were senior high school graduates.
</P>
<P>
A total of 4,544 suspects were involved in the 3,144 domestic
assault cases last year, with 2,237 of them being indicted by
prosecutors, said the MOJ, adding that 52 percent of the cases
concerned married couples, and another 16 percent involved
directly related family members.
