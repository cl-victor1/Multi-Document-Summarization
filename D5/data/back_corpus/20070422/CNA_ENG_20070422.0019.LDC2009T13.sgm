ASPIRANT PUTS FORTH ALTERNATIVE PLAN ON EASTERN TAIWAN
DEVELOPMENT
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  April  22 (CNA) 04/22/07  19:48:48 (By Deborah Kuo)

A presidential aspirant of the ruling Democratic Progressive
Party suggested Sunday that the country seek to follow a "Taiwan
Piloting Plan" to develop eastern Taiwan should the controversial
freeway connecting Suao and Hualien not be constructed due to
environmental considerations.
</P>
<P>
Frank Hsieh, who had served as premier and Kaohsiung mayor, said
he agrees with President Chen Shui-bian that it is essential that
the Suhua freeway be built provided that it passes environmental
analysis review.
</P>
<P>
Chen said the day before that it was an established government
policy that a round-the-island freeway be built, and that it was
essential to build a freeway connecting Suao in the eastern
county of Yilan with its neighboring county of Hualien. "However,
we cannot go ahead with the project if it fails the environmental
review, " Chen said.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on that, Hsieh said that he has been aware since he
was the premier a couple of years ago that the Suhua freeway
development project is unlikely to pass the environmental
analysis review.
</P>
<P>
Consequently, Hsieh said, he has been promoting the alternative
"Taiwan Piloting Plan", which exclusively aims at developing
eastern Taiwan where counties  are characterized  by relatively
small populations in which the natural environment and
agriculture are the most valuable assets.
</P>
<P>
Hsieh envisaged funds being raised and stakeholders consulted
under the "Taiwan Piloting Plan", so that signature industries
and products with local features might be developed.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Stanley Yen, chairman of the Ritz Landis hotel group,
who is also an environmentalist, said during an event held in
Taipei to mark the April 22 Earth Day, that the Suhua freeway
development issue is an ethical issue, rather than a political
issue.
</P>
<P>
Yen, who was instrumental in arranging for a visit to eastern
Taiwan in March by the management of the top-flight Burj Al Arab
Hotel on a business inspection tour, urged politicians to display
greater ethical conscience, saying that if Taiwan's people want
to be world citizens, they should first learn to be citizens of
the Earth and try harder to protect the global environment.
</P>
<P>
Taking the Beiyi freeway connecting Taipei and Yilan as an
example, Yen said that the construction of the Hsuehshan Tunnel,
which is part of the Beiyi freeway, left Taiwan's invaluable,
millennia-old water resources damaged and the proposed Suhau
freeway will intrude into 17 biological sensitive zones. The
Beiyi freeway was opened to public traffic last year amid ongoing
doubts and disputes over environmental issues.
</P>
<P>
Yen invited Alwin Zecha, the younger brother of the owner of the
seven-star Burj Al Arab Hotel and two-term chairman of the
Pacific Asia Travel Association, to visit the eastern county of
Taitung. News reports stated that the hotelier from Dubai was
initially interested in turning a Taitung hot spring hotel into a
new attraction, taking advantage of the natural beauty and white
sand of the quiet city by the Pacific Ocean.
