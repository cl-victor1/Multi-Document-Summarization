students in remote areas to improve their academic performance.

Foundation which was set up by Guo in 2000 and headed by his
daughter Guo Hsiao-ling.

Terry Guo said under the Hope School program, the Yungling
Foundation works together with eight universities as well as
other education institutions around the island to provide after-

up on studying.

Noting that education is the best weapon to fight poverty, the
