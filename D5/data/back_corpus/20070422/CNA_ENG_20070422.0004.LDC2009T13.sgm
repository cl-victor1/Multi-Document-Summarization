TSU UNVEILS NEW PARTY CHARTER, PLATFORM
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  April 21 (CNA) 04/22/07  10:42:56 (By Sofia Wu)

<P>
The opposition Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU) came up with new
party charter and new party platform Saturday as part of its
survival strategy ahead of the year- end legislative election
that poses a severe test to its political fate or future.
</P>
<P>
The new TSU party platform upholds five basic principles and
ideals.  First and foremost,  the party insists that Taiwan's
sovereignty rests with its people and advocates a Taiwan-centric
national development strategy.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the party vows to unite Taiwan's diverse ethnic groups
with the concept that all residents are new-age Taiwanese who
treasure freedom, democracy and human rights as their shared core
values.
</P>
<P>
The new TSU platform also pledges to promote fair competition on
the basis of social justice while striving to wipe out money-
based politics and establishing a clean and competent government.
</P>
<P>
The new TSU charter and platform were unveiled in a Taipei rally
that was attended by former President Lee Teng-hui, who has been
reputed as the party's spiritual leader, and representatives of
some social groups.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the rally, TSU Chairman Huang Kun-hui said the new
party charter and platform have set forth new policy direction
and development guidelines for the party.
</P>
<P>
"With the declaration of our new party charter and platform, we
are committed to working for the common well-being of our country
and people," Huang said.
</P>
<P>
According to the new TSU charter, Huang went on, the party will
pursue a"center- left" policy line and collaborate with middle-
class and disadvantaged groups to boost welfare services and
benefits for them.
</P>
<P>
Claiming that Taiwan people's well-being has been compromised due
to the protracted political standoff between the country's two
major parties -- the ruling Democratic Progressive Party and
(DPP) and the main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) -- in the past
seven years, Huang said this situation should not continue and
that the TSU will play a crucial role in pushing for an early end
to all partisan strife and rivalry.
</P>
<P>
The TSU now controls 12 legislative seats and several seats in
the Taipei City Council. The party used to be a DPP ally in the
Legislative Yuan as both parties support Taiwan independence and
a more confrontational approach toward China. But their ties have
soured over different partisan interests and certain policy
issues, particularly those related with opening to China.
</P>
<P>
As the year-end legislative election will adopt a new electoral
system that is generally believed to be less favorable to small
parties, the TSU has tried to foster a new image to woo new fans
and has since softened its pro-independence rhetoric. It now give
priority  to talking  about socialism-like  policy initiatives,
particularly welfare services for disadvantaged groups.
