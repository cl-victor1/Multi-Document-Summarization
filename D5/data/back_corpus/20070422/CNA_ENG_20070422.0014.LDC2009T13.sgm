Kaohsiung customs agents seized contraband products worth over
NT$42 million (US$1.2 million) in 249 cases in the first quarter
of this year, according to the Kaohsiung Customs Office under the
Ministry of Finance.
</P>
<P>
The high value of the contraband highlights the fact that
smuggling remains rampant in the first three months of the year
despite a drive launched earlier this year by the Kaohsiung
customs authorities to wipe out illicit imports, office officials
said.
</P>
<P>
According to officials, many of the contraband items, including
drugs, firearms and unlawful chemical substances were concealed
on shipping boats or inside containers, and some pricey
contraband goods were also disguised as cheap products by
smuggling rings in an attempt to import them at lower tariff
rates.
