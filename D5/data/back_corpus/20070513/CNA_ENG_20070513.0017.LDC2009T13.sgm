The government's goal of setting up the country's first maritime
national park -- the Dongsha Atoll National Park in the South
China Sea -- has finally taken a step forward with the passage of
the organic rules for a park management office, an official said
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
According to Executive Yuan-approved rules, the official from the
Ministry of the Interior's Construction and Planning
Administration said, the new Maritime National Park
Administration will be housed in a building in Central Park in
the southern port city of Kaohsiung.
</P>
<P>
The administration will be manned by 40 staff assigned to four
departments in its head office and an outpost in the Dongsha
islands, the official said.
</P>
<P>
As the building to be used by the administration requires a
facelift, the official said the maritime park administration's
formal inaugural date has yet to be set.
</P>
<P>
"Once the government's 2007 budget bill clears the legislature,
the refurbishment project will get underway and be completed
within two months," the official said.
</P>
<P>
The preparatory task force for the Maritime National Park
Administration is now planning to recruit oceanologists, nature
conservationists and environmental engineering experts to join
its work force,  the official said,  adding that marine resources
management specialists will also be recruited in the later stage.
</P>
<P>
The Dongsha islands, comprising Dongsha island itself, along with
two coral reefs completely submerged at high tide -- the Beiwei
Bank (also known as the North Vereker Bank) and the Nanwei Bank
(or South Vereker Bank) -- are located 240 nautical miles
southwest of Kaohsiung.
</P>
<P>
The government constructed a national monument on the island June
30, 1989 and an adjacent structure to protect the monument May
18, 1993, to assert its sovereignty over the archipelago.
</P>
<P>
The establishment of a maritime national park administration has
become urgent because the marine resources and natural ecology in
the area have been gravely damaged over the past decade due to
rampant poaching by fishermen using destructive fishing methods
such as poison and explosives, the official said.
</P>
<P>
According to government data, the Dongsha islands cover an area
of 350,000 hectares, with atolls accounting for 80,000 hectares.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the islands cover an area three times that of Taipei
City, the official said the archipelago boasts the largest and
most unspoiled group of atolls in the West Pacific.
</P>
<P>
With their unique maritime eco-system, the official said, the
coral reefs surrounding the islands are the best in Taiwan's
territorial waters. Dongsha's coastal waters are also known for
their biodiversity, with 489 fish species and about 200 coral
strains documented, as well as numerous other marine species.
</P>
<P>
Against this backdrop, the official went on, it has become
urgently necessary for the government to set up a maritime
national park administration to better protect and conserve the
natural ecology of the area.
</P>
<P>
In the initial stage, the official said, the park administration
will give priority to drafting an overall development plan,
survey resources and ecosystem in the region as well as an
analysis of the impact of infrastructure construction on the
region's natural environment.
</P>
<P>
The administration will need an outlay of NT$690 million, with
NT$280 million to be spent on setting up catchment and
desalination facilities,  as well as an international research
station and exploration of substitute energy resources.
