TSU: FREQUENT PREMIERSHIP TURNOVER BAD FOR POLICY CONTINUITY

Taipei,  May 13 (CNA) 05/13/07  18:44:06 (By Han Nai-kuo)

The frequent premiership turnover over the past seven years is
the main reason why the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)
government lacks continuity in its policies, an executive of the
opposition Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU) claimed Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Chien Cheng-shan, secretary-general of the TSU, made the remarks
when asked to comment on media speculation that Chang Chun-
hsiung, who served as premier for 16 months from October 2000 to
February 2002, might succeed Premier Su Tseng- chang, who
tendered  his resignation last week after being defeated in the
DPP primary for the 2008 presidential election by former Premier
Frank Hsieh.
</P>
<P>
News reports over the weekend said President Chen Shui-bian was
considering reappointing Chang to succeed Su -- the fifth premier
to be replaced in seven years. Su has served for just under 16
months.
</P>
<P>
Chien said that because  of Chang's  "lack of outstanding
achievements" during his previous term as premier, he would
unlikely to do better if reappointed to the post.
</P>
<P>
Chang, a DPP lawmaker, currently serves as chairman of the
Straits Exchange Foundation, a semi-official  organization that
handles cross-Taiwan Strait exchanges.
</P>
<P>
He declined to confirm or deny reports about his reappointment as
premier, saying that any speculation  on the matter would be
"inappropriate" until the president has made a formal
announcement.
