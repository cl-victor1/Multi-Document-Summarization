Taiwan's International Cooperation and Development Fund (ICDF) is
recruiting volunteer workers for short- and long-term service in
countries with diplomatic relations with the Republic of China.
</P>
<P>
Applicants must be ROC citizens who are at least 20 years old,
with either a university education background or at least five
years of experience in their areas of expertise. Male applicants
must have completed their military service, according to ICDF
officials.
</P>
<P>
The officials said current vacancies for Taiwanese volunteer
workers include three experts in public health to help Costa Rica
curb the spread of contagious diseases, an investment promotion
expert for the Ministry of Industry and Commerce of Paraguay, an
expert in Western cooking for a hotel in Kiribati in the central
Pacific, and a computer maintenance expert for the Marshall
Islands.
</P>
<P>
The ICDF is the organization that implements Taiwan's official
development assistance to other countries. It plays a similar
role to that of the U.S. Agency for International Development by
providing assistance to other countries in banking and finance,
technical cooperation, human resources development and
humanitarian assistance.
</P>
<P>
As of June 2006, the ICDF had 36 long-term technical missions
stationed in 30 countries, providing assistance in many fields,
including agriculture, fisheries, health care,  transportation,
vocational training, trade and investment
</P>
<P>
The ICDF created its overseas volunteer assistance program in
July 1993 and the program was renamed the Taiwan Overseas
Volunteers in early 2003.
</P>
<P>
The program has dispatched nearly 200 volunteers to 22 nations in
Africa, Central and South America, the Eastern Caribbean and the
Asia-Pacific region.
</P>
<P>
The volunteer workers provide assistance in various areas,
including small- and medium-enterprises, agriculture, city and
rural development,  environmental protection,  healthcare,
information technology,  education, vocational training and human
resources development.
