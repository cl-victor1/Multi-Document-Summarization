A jetfighter crash that caused the death of two Singaporean
troops and injured nine other Singapore Armed Forces (SAF)
personnel in Taiwan Friday will not alter the training program
that the Singapore and Taiwan militaries have collaborated in for
years, Singapore Defense Minister Teo Chee Hean said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Seven of the SAF troops, who sustained minor injuries after a
Taiwan air force F-5F jetfighter crashed Friday into an army base
used by SAF troops in Huko, Hsinchu County, will remain in Taiwan
until their training period ends and other SAF personnel
currently in Taiwan under the training program will also stay,
Teo said.

<P>
The two-seater F-5F crashed Friday during a rehearsal for
Taiwan's Han Kuang 23 military exercises, killing the pilot and
co-pilot and two Singaporean troops on the ground. The crash also
caused a fire at the barracks housing the SAF soldiers.

According to Teo, the body of one of the two deceased SAF
personnel and two SAF soldiers who suffered more serious burns,
have returned to Singapore, while the SAF has dispatched a five-
member medical team to Taiwan to tend to the rest of the wounded.

<P>
Teo expressed his appreciation to the Taiwan authorities for
their assistance, saying that the Taiwan military has done its
best to assist the SAF personnel in the wake of the accident,
while Taiwan's medical sector has also spared no efforts to help
the SAF soldiers.
