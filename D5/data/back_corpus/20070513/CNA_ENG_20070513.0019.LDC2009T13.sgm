Taipei, May 13 (CNA) 05/13/07  20:59:45 (By Sofia Wu)

A Taipei city government-sanctioned heritage site dedicated to
Tsai Jui-yueh, known as the matriarch of Taiwan's modern dance,
was re-opened Sunday in a grand ceremony.
</P>
<P>
Frank Hsieh, who is set to be the ruling Democratic Progressive
Party's candidate for the next presidency, led a group of
literary figures and celebrities in unraveling a ribbon tied to
the gate and entering the facility to mark the re-opening of the
Tsai Jui-yuen Dance Research Institute, also known as the Rose
Heritage Site, in a quiet back alley near Taipei's bustling
Zhongshan N. Road.
</P>
<P>
Kao Chun-ming, a Presbyterian minister who returned to Taiwan
from Japan aboard the same boat with Tsai after the end of the
50-year Japanese colonial rule of Taiwan in 1945, led all the
guests present at the ceremony  in praying for the heritage
site's well-being.
</P>
<P>
Shortly afterwards, President Chen Shui-bian showed up at the
ceremony and presented a posthumous award for Tsai's lifelong
achievement, which was accepted by Tsai's son Lei Ta-peng.
</P>
<P>
After studying dance in Japan, Tsai embarked on a career in dance
instruction, founding the Chunghua Dance Research Institute in
1953 -- Taiwan's first modern dance studio which has nurtured
many outstanding dancers and is now called the Tsai Jui-yueh
Dance Research Institute.
</P>
<P>
Internationally recognized as a brilliant choreographer and
performer, Tsai choreographed more than 500 dance pieces
throughout her life and was versatile in ballet, modern dance and
traditional folk dance.
</P>
<P>
President Chen praised Tsai as an esteemed dance educator and a
pioneer promoter of modern dance in Taiwan. Chen also expressed
his admiration for Tsai's courage and tenacity as Tsai maintained
her exuberant vitality and courageously carried on alone after
her husband, a poet, was arrested and later exiled for political
reasons during Taiwan's infamous white terror era in the 1950s.
Tsai herself was also imprisoned for more than two years.
</P>
<P>
Upon release, Tsai went on to raise her son by herself while
going full steam pursuing her dance career. "With her feminine
vitality and deep love of dance, Tsai had opened one new vista
after another for dance in Taiwan," Chen added.
</P>
<P>
Tsai's studio, originally a dormitory for government officials
during the era of Japanese colonial rule, was badly damaged by
fire in late 1999. With concerted efforts of the public and
private sectors, the building has now been restored to its
original glory.
</P>
<P>
Chen said the building itself may not be very special. "But the
building used to be a literary and arts salon and it bears
witness to Tsai's lifelong dedication to dance. It's the reason
why we have strived to preserve this heritage site," he added.
