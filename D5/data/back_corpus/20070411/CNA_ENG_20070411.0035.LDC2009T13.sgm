The National Council on Physical Fitness and Sports (NCPFS) has

Mass cycling events will be held in both Taipei City and County
on that day and everybody is welcome, said NCPFS Chairman Yang
Jongher.

"Cycling is a sport that can help one achieve maximum health with
minimum cost," Yang said.

Cycling Life-Style Foundation Chairman King Liu said the number
of cyclists in Taiwan has been increasing in recent years and
many local authorities are enthusiastic about building bicycle
paths, which "are good for the promotion of the sport", he said.

Liu, who is also the chairman of the Giant Bicycles, said it took
several years of promotion efforts to bring Taiwan in line with
countries such as the United States, the Netherlands, Spain,
Belgium, Italy and France and recognize a bicycle day.
