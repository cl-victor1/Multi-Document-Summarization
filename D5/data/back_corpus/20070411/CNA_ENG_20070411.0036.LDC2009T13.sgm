Premier Su Tseng-chang confirmed Wednesday that the Fisheries
Administration under the Cabinet-level Council of Agriculture
(COA) will soon be relocated to Kaohsiung City in southern
Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Su confirmed the move during a question-and-answer session at the
Legislative Yuan, which was also attended by COA officials.
</P>
<P>
According to COA Deputy Minister Lee Jen-chyuan, personnel at the
COA's Fisheries Administration will begin relocating to Kaohsiung
in October this year at the earliest.
</P>
<P>
In the near future, the COA will have different units scattered
across Taiwan in line with the Executive Yuan's efforts to strike
a balance in development in northern, central and southern
regions.
</P>
<P>
A group of about 60 administration officials will be the first to
move to Kaohsiung, with the rest of the staff following in
several phases, said Fisheries Administration Deputy Director-
General Sha Chih-i.
</P>
<P>
According to Sha, the administration presently has more than 200
officials stationed in northern Taiwan, with 99 percent of them
residing in Taipei.
</P>
<P>
The administration will eventually station some 70 workers in
Taipei for regular service, he said, adding that job vacancies
that arise due to the departure of Taipei-based will not be
immediately filled, but instead the positions will be held open
and filled by workers in Kaohsiung.
