The National Health Research Institute (NHRI) forged cooperative
ties with Tainan City-based National Cheng Kung University
Hospital (NCKUH) Wednesday in a drive to seek a better balance in
medical resources distribution across the northern and southern
parts of Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
NHRI President Kenneth K. Wu and National Cheng Kung University
President Lai Ming-chao signed the cooperation agreement in a
ceremony also attended by Legislator Lai Ching-teh, who has
spared no efforts promoting draft legislation for the cancer
prevention and control act and establishment of a cancer research
institute in southern Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Cooperation between the institutions will focus on clinical
cancer research  and the southern  Taiwan research  facility's
formation, which it is believed will help enhance cancer
prevention and control efforts.

NCKUH President Chen Chih-hung indicated that cancer has been the
leading cause of death in Taiwan. Moreover, the researchers have
found that people in different regions on island are affected
with different kinds of cancer.
</P>
<P>
For example, he said people living in the southern area are prone
to cancer affecting liver, lung, skin and bladder, and cancer
patients in the south are likely to be affected by the disease in
different ways from those in the north.
</P>
<P>
NCKUH Cancer Center Director Chou Chen-yang explained that in the
north, the hepatitis B virus is often found to be the culprit in
causing liver cancer, while liver cancer patients in the south
were mostly found to affected by the disease because of hepatitis
C virus infection.
</P>
<P>
Chou further said the number of oral cancer patients in southern
Taiwan is much larger than that in the north.
</P>
<P>
Under the cooperation agreement, the NHRI will open a clinical
research cooperative ward at NCKUH in the second half of this
year and dispatch eight of its cancer experts to the hospital for
cancer research programs, according to the institute which has
already similar research-oriented wards at three major hospitals
in Taipei -- Taipei Veterans General Hospital, Tri-Service
General Hospital, and National Taiwan University Hospital.
