Unique International Technology Inc. said Wednesday that it is
not ruling out the possibility of cooperating with other media
networks after becoming the biggest shareholder of the Taiwan
Television Enterprises Ltd. (TTV).
</P>
<P>
Unique made the remarks in a written statement after it won 25.77
percent of the government's stakes in the 45-year-old television
company, one of the four terrestrial networks in Taiwan, in open
bidding earlier in the day by offering NT$1.74 billion (US$53.73
million), or NT$24.1 per share, beating three rivals.
</P>
<P>
Unique, which started with a small TV channel dedicated to
financial and economic news, said that it has long-term contacts
with a former Japanese partner in the TTV, and that the Japanese
shareholder has sold its 14.4 percent of its shares to the
Unique.
</P>
<P>
With the new addition, Unique will possess 40.17 percent of the
shares, the company said in the statement.
</P>
<P>
The company said that it will run the TTV with professionalism
based on its specialty in financial and economic areas. It will
also protect  the rights  of TTV staff  based on respect  of the
labor-management relations.
</P>
<P>
Asked whether Unique will form an alliance with other media
networks, the company said that it will not rule out the
possibility of cooperating with them, saying that it has things
to learn from them.
</P>
<P>
Wednesday's  offering  was the first-stage  release of the
government's stakes in the TTV. The government will begin to
promote a second-stage stock release next month, offering around
19 percent of its stakes to the public as well as TTV staff.
