Taipei,  April 11 (CNA) 04/11/07  15:54:16 (By Elisa Kao)

<P>
Legislators of the ruling and opposition parties reached a
consensus Wednesday regarding the upgrading of the Republic of
China passport to a "chip passport" in the near future.
</P>
<P>
The legislators reached the consensus while screening the clauses
of proposed revisions to the passport statute at the Legislative
Yuan.
</P>
<P>
Legislator Hsu Kuo-yung of the ruling Democratic Progressive
Party (DPP) , who is also chairman of the Legislative Yuan's
Foreign and Overseas Compatriot Affairs Committee, noted that the
"chip passport"  will not contain the fingerprint  and iris
pattern information of the passport holders as "biometric
passports" do, adding that there is no need for the public to
worry about leakage of their biometric information.
</P>
<P>
Hsu further said that the information included in the "chip
passports" will be the same as that already included in current
passports and that the new passports will better protect the
holders' personal information.
</P>
<P>
Hsu said that more than 30 countries have issued "chip passports"
and that if Taiwan nationals have such passports, it will
facilitate their entry into these countries.
</P>
<P>
As to whether the "chip passports" will be more expensive than
the ones currently issued, Hsu said the Ministry of Foreign
Affairs (MOFA) has allocated funds to cover the increased cost of
producing the "chip passports" and that there will not be a price
hike in applying for the new passports.
</P>
<P>
According to Hsu, the MOFA has earmarked NT$146 million (US$4.42
million) for producing chip passports and another NT$52 million
for apparatus to read such passports.
