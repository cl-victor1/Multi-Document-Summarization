DPP LAWMAKER PROPOSES TOUR PACKAGE FEATURING CHIANG

Taipei, April 11 (CNA) 04/11/07  22:00:16 (By Flor Wang)

Despite an ongoing controversy surrounding the late President
Chiang Kai-shek, a ruling party lawmaker Wednesday asked
government authorities to draw up tour packages featuring Chiang
in an effort to lure more tourists from home and abroad.
</P>
<P>
Yeh Yi-jin of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), made
the proposal during a question-and-answer session of the
Legislative Yuan, with Janice Seh- jen Lai, director-general of
the Tourism Bureau under the Ministry of Transportation and
Communications, promising to come up with a package within a
week.
</P>
<P>
Yeh suggested the Tourism Bureau work on such a package in
response to an anticipated opening of Taiwan to Chinese tourists,
as everything related to Chiang is of great interest to them.
</P>
<P>
Although Chiang's first official residence Grass Mountain Chateau
-- later transformed into a public leisure space with a
restaurant and an exhibition room displaying favorite dishes and
items of the Chiang family -- was badly damaged in a suspicious
fire late last Friday, Yeh said that many resort villas of Chiang
still can be found scattered in the rest of Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
"The Tourism Bureau should focus its efforts on developing
packages featuring Chiang to better attract Chinese tourists in
anticipation of that opening," Yeh said.
</P>
<P>
Echoing Yeh's idea, main opposition Kuomintang lawmaker Wang Yu-
ting expressed her support for the proposal.
</P>
<P>
Wang also criticized tourism authorities for lacking a vision to
explore Taiwan's resources and potential in this field. There are
13 national scenic areas across the country, but they need to be
better programmed and promoted to court more tourists, she
pointed out.
