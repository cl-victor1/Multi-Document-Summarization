The Civil Aeronautics Administration (CAA) agreed Wednesday to
Mandarin Airlines' request to end its flight services on the
Taipei-Taichung route from May 1 and said that those who have
already booked flights on the route can have their money refunded
in full.
</P>
<P>
CAA officials said the decision was made after the administration
came to the conclusion that offering flight services on the route
was no longer profitable given the alternative transportation
choices available.
</P>
<P>
Mandarin Airlines is currently the only air carrier operating
flight services on the Taipei-Taichung route. UNI Airways Corp.
ended its flight services on the route in July 2004 due to
decreasing passenger numbers.

<P>
According to CAA statistics, Mandarin Airlines suffered losses
amounting to NT$45 million (US$1.36 million)  in 2006 on the
Taipei-Taichung route. The airline said that after high-speed
rail transportation services began Jan. 5, the passenger
occupancy percentage of each flight on the route dropped to 16
percent between January and March and slid to 4.3 percent in
April.
</P>
<P>
It costs NT$700 for a single high-speed rail trip between Taipei
and Taichung, which takes around one hour. In comparison, a one-
way air ticket on the route costs NT$1,342, with passengers
spending about 50 minutes on the plane.
</P>
<P>
Mandarin Airlines officials said that the company has decided to
focus more on boosting its international flight services based at
the Taichung Airport after quitting the Taipei-Taichung route.
</P>
<P>
At present,  the airline operates regular passenger flight
services between the central Taiwan city and Hong Kong, as well
as to Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam, according to the officials.
