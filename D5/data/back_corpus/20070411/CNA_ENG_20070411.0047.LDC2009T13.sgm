The Executive Yuan reaffirmed its decision Wednesday to suspend
two commissioners of the National Communications Commission (NCC)
for violating conflict of interest laws.
</P>
<P>
Executive Yuan spokeswoman Chen Mei-ling said NCC commissioners
Wu Chung-chi and Liu Kung-chung have been suspended from their
jobs pending a Control Yuan review after which they could be
fined and sacked.

<P>
Against this backdrop, Chen said the two are no longer NCC
commissioners and can receive neither salaries nor perks from the
NCC. Any decision or action either takes concerning NCC affairs
is invalid, Chen said, adding that if either takes part in an NCC
meeting, any decisions reached may be invalidated.
</P>
<P>
"Wu and Liu, of course, are free to seek remedies by appealing
their cases in accordance with existing laws. But until relevant
courts rule on their appeals, the Executive Yuan's punitive
measures regarding their legal transgressions remain in force.
They should not continue  acting as NCC members;  to do so would
affect NCC operations," Chen explained.

<P>
As Liu hired an in-law and Wu hired his son to serve as
chauffeurs of government-provided cars at the NCC expense, Chen
said that both violated laws demanding that officials avoid
conflicts of interest,  and the Civil Service Law,  which
requires ethical integrity.
