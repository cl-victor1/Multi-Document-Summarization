A Kaohsiung municipal zoo veterinarian had his left forearm
bitten off by a crocodile Wednesday, but surgeons are operating
to reattach the limb, retrieved after a policeman shot dead the
crocodile, according to various sources.
</P>
<P>
A Kaohsiung Medical University Hospital surgeon said the medical
team is optimistic about the operation to reattach the limb.
</P>
<P>
He said that while thegolden timefor such surgeries falls within
six hours of injury, the operation on Chang began slightly more
than an hour after the incident. However, he said, the extent to
which the reattached arm will be functional is uncertain.
</P>
<P>
The attack occurred in the afternoon at Shou Shan Zoo when senior
official and veterinarian Chang Po-yu was treating a sick
crocodile and removing an anesthetic needle, zoo nurse Huang Shu-
chen said.

<P>
The surgeon said that the 38-year-old Chang was conscious and
that the arm was severed about 5 cm below the elbow.
</P>
<P>
Emergency Service officers said a police officer had to shoot
dead the crocodile using a pistol from several meters away in
order to retrieve Chang's severed forearm, which was still held
in its mouth, so that the forearm could be put on ice and rushed
to the hospital.
</P>
<P>
Zoo officials said that Chang is an experienced and caring vet
who had previously risked his life entering the cages of lions
and tigers in order to save them from a flood.
