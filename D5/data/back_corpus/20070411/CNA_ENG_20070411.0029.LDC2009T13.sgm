USING RESTYLANE SUB Q FOR BREAST ENLARGEMENT IS AGAINST LAW: DOH
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  April 11 (CNA) 04/11/07  21:12:21 (By Han Nai-kuo)

The Cabinet-level Department of Health (DOH) warned Wednesday it
is illegal for plastic surgeons in Taiwan to use Restylane Sub Q
-- a non-animal hyaluronic acid gel -- for breast enlargement
operations.
</P>
<P>
Liao Chi-jou Liao, director-general of the DOH's Bureau of
Pharmaceutical Affairs,  said that doctors  who perform  such
non-surgical  treatment will be referred to the Committee for
Disciplinary Sanctions of Physicians in accordance with Article
25 of the Physicians Law.
</P>
<P>
Liao explained that the DOH has only allowed plastic surgery
clinics to inject small amounts of Restylane Sub Q to remove
wrinkles or enhance facial contours.
</P>
<P>
The health official stressed that the DOH has not given doctors
permission to inject Sub Q gel into the breast tissue because a
breast enlargement operation usually requires more than 100 cc of
the gel, which may not always stay where it should.
</P>
<P>
"Unless a doctor who has performed such an operation can present
convincing documents to prove that Sub Q gel is harmless when
used for breast enlargement, he or she will face disciplinary
measures according to law," Liao said.
</P>
<P>
He urged women contemplating breast augmentation to consider
carefully the risk of Sub Q injection.
</P>
<P>
Liao gave the warning after a plastic surgery clinic touted the
advantage of Sub Q for breast enlargement by asking a porno movie
actress who underwent such an operation to present herself as an
example.
