Taiwan's new representative to the United States, Joseph Wu, said
Wednesday that President Chen Shui-bian has expressed hope that
after he assumes his post later this month, he would truly convey
to the world the unfair treatment under which Taiwan's people are
suffering.
</P>
<P>
Wu, who is now chairman of Mainland Affairs Council (MAC), made
the remarks after attending a farewell party thrown by the MAC
for him.
</P>
<P>
According to Wu,  President Chen received him Tuesday and
instructed him to strengthen communications with administrative
and legislative branches of U.S. government in diverse aspects,
including Taiwan's need of defense assistance from the United
States.
</P>
<P>
Concerning the president's recent "four wants" declaration for
the country -- seeking independence, changing the country's
official designation, formulating a new constitution and
strengthening the development -- which has caused great concern
within the U.S. government, Wu said he will accurately convey the
president's real thoughts in this regard if given the
opportunity.
</P>
<P>
As for some Taiwanese expatriates in the U.S. who have expressed
worry about his close ties with the ruling Democratic Progressive
Party (DPP) ,  Wu stressed that he is the Republic of China
government's representative in U.S. and he is glad to extend help
to any ROC national living in the United States.
</P>
<P>
Wu went on that he will be responsible for explaining clearly the
various policies of ROC government to Taiwanese communities in
America  in order to clarify  their misunderstandings  of the
government.
</P>
<P>
In addition to Taiwanese communities in U.S., Wu said he will
also strengthen communications with various think tanks based in
U.S. to accurately transmit the voice of Taiwan's people to the
world.
