Washington, June 5 (CNA) 06/06/07  21:37:48 (By Michelle Tsai and

The Republic of China's representative to the United States,
Joseph Wu, said the signing of free trade agreement (FTA) between
Taiwan and U.S. is "a matter of time," and that Taiwan has to
wait patiently until the time is ripe.
</P>
<P>
Wu made the remarks at Twin Oaks estate in Washington, D.C. where
he feasted Taiwanese agricultural and industrial delegations
visiting U.S. to solicit the support of U.S.enterprises on FTA
matters.
</P>
<P>
The feast was attended by about 80 people, including
representatives of Taiwan and U.S.enterprises like Uni-President
Corp., Taiwan Power Co., U.S. Wheat Associates, and Westinghouse
Electric Corp.
</P>
<P>
Wu told reporters that the visiting agricultural delegation will
sign a letter of intent to pursue a procurement project worth of
US$3.9 billion, and the industrial delegation, which will sign a
contract for a procurement project costing US$127.09 million,
will also propose another cooperative project worth US$ 11.34
billion.
</P>
<P>
Wu said Taiwan has been importing more goods from the U.S. since
1993 and has since become increasingly tied to American
agricultural market, with 95 percent of Taiwan's imported cereals
coming from the U.S.
</P>
<P>
Director-general of Foreign Trade Bureau Huang Chih-peng, who is
leading the industrial delegation to the U.S., said the idea of
an FTA between Taiwan and the U.S. has the support of American
media outlets and enterprises, and there is still a chance to
sign an FTA with America, because the American government has not
rejected the idea, though nor has it said yes to it, Huang added.
</P>
<P>
Sun Ming-hsien, Taiwan's ambassador at-large who is leading the
agricultural delegation to U.S., said he hopes that Taiwan's
frequent agricultural cooperation with America will contribute to
the bilateral FTA which should bring economic benefits to both
sides.
