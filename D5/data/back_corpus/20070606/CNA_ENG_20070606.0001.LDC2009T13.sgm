ALARM BELL RINGING ON ROC-COSTA RICA TIES: MOFA
</HEADLINE>

Taipei, June 6 (CNA) 06/06/07  10:29:15 (By Sofia Wu)

<P>
Alarm bells are ringing on relations between the Republic of
China and its Central American ally of Costa Rica, a senior
Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) official warned Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
According to the official, the longstanding ROC-Costa Rican
diplomatic ties are at a crossroads and may see a change in the
near future.
</P>
<P>
"Both the MOFA and the ROC diplomatic staff stationed in Costa
Rica have been on full alert and are keeping close tabs on
relevant developments," said the official who preferred
anonymity.
</P>
<P>
Costa Rica has been in close contact with China in recent years
as it needs China's support to realize its goal of becoming a
non-permanent member of the U.N. Security Council, the official
analyzed, adding that the vast Chinese market is yet another
incentive to draw Cost Rica closer to Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Last September, the official recalled that Costa Rican President
Oscar Arias held a tete-a-tete with then-Chinese Foreign Minister
Li Zhaoxing while both of them were attending the annual U.N.
General Assembly.
</P>
<P>
On May 14 this year, the Costa Rican ambassador to the World
Health Organization (WHO) even cast a "no" vote in the world
health regulatory body's annual assembly in Geneva on the issue
whether to include Taiwan's membership application into its
meeting agenda.
</P>
<P>
"All these incidents were bad omens for our bilateral ties" the
official said, adding that the latest intelligence collected by
the ROC Embassy in San Jose also shows that Costa Rica indeed
intends to accelerate normalization of its relations with China.
</P>
<P>
Against this backdrop, the official said, Taiwan must be prepared
for any worst- case scenario.
</P>
<P>
Costa Rica established diplomatic ties with the ROC in 1944 and
the two countries have since maintained a cordial relationship
until recently.
</P>
<P>
When Arias, a Nobel Peace Prize laureate, was elected president
for a second time in May 2006, he declared that his
administration will review its policy toward China based on Costa
Rica's national interest. His declaration was seen a signal of
the activation of Costa Rica's move toward normalizing ties with
China.
