Chiayi County in southern Taiwan received 116.5 mm of rainfall
between midnight Tuesday and 8: 30 a.m. Wednesday, marking the
largest amount of rainfall around the island during that period
of time, the Central Weather Bureau (CWB) reported.

<P>
The amount of rainfall nearly met the CWB's definition of
"extremely heavy rain, " which means that a place receives over
130 mm of rain within 24 hours, CWB meteorologists said.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan is currently under the influence of a plum rain season
frontal system, with torrential rainfall expected in western and
northeastern regions of the island, the meteorologists forecast.
</P>
<P>
The frontal system will continue to linger until next week, they
said, warning of possible flooding in low-lying areas and
possible landslides in mountainous areas.
