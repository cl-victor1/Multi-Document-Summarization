Members of the main opposition Kuomintang's (KMT) legislative
caucus voiced grave concern Wednesday over a possible "domino
effect" in Taiwan's foreign relations following reports of a
likely change in Taiwan-Costa Rica ties.
</P>
<P>
KMT lawmakers, including legislative caucus whip Hsu Shao-ping,
Su Chi and John Chiang, issued the warning in a Legislative Yuan
news conference after Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA)
officials revealed the previous evening that "two-way Taiwan-
Costa  Rica relations might undergo a twist in the near future."
</P>
<P>
According to the MOFA officials, the Republic of China Embassy in
that Central American country has swung into full alert and is
closely watching developments.
</P>
<P>
Chiang, who is a former foreign minister, said he is worried that
a "domino effect" might take place among Taiwan's  diplomatic
partners, mostly in Central and South America and Africa, if
Costa Rica shifts its diplomatic recognition from Taiwan to
China.
</P>
<P>
Costa Rica, which has maintained diplomatic links with Taiwan for
63 years, is a symbolic stronghold of Taiwan's diplomatic
offensive in the region, Chiang said, adding that the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party's (DPP) administration should
apologize to the Taiwan people over the uncertainty in bilateral
ties.
</P>
<P>
KMT lawmakers also predicted that the DPP is very likely to
rehash the issue of the country's bid to join the United Nations
in the name of "Taiwan" prior to the legislative and presidential
elections.
</P>
<P>
The DPP taking such an approach to fuel political issues instead
of devoting energy to improving Taiwan's economy will not benefit
Taiwan's people and will only further squeeze the country out of
the international community, they contended.
