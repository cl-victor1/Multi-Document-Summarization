The average starting salary of Taiwan's college graduates in 2006
was NT$26,700 (US$ 808) , which was NT$762 lower than it was
eight years ago, a Council of Labor Affairs (CLA) official said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Quoting the results of a survey conducted by the CLA, the
official said the average starting pay of job seekers with
masters degrees or above in the same year was NT$31,567, higher
than the NT$30,388 of eight years ago.
</P>
<P>
The official said Taiwan's average unemployment rate was higher
than 4 percent during 2001 to 2005, which had an impact on
college graduates' starting pay. In addition, a research report
compiled by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and
Development (OECD) shows that the global economy and Taiwan's
industry relocation also affected domestic employment and salary
growth.
</P>
<P>
The CLA survey also shows that new job seekers spent an average
of 1.9 months to find their first jobs. Among them, college
graduates spent 1.8 months and university graduates took 1.8
months, while job seekers with master degrees or above spent 1.1
months finding their first jobs.
</P>
<P>
Some 18.1 percent of workers aged 20-24, and 4.8 percent of
workers aged 25-29 were part-time workers, showing that job
stability grows with age and work experience, the official went
on.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, some 60 percent of workers under the age of 30 have
occupational certifications, with 32.5 percent of them having
technician certification and 16.4 percent having computer skill
certifications, the official added.
