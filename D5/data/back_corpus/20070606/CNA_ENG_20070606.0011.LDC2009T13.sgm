Lawmakers reviewed Wednesday a proposed amendment to the Animal
Protection Law that would increase the penalty for abusing or
deserting animals.
</P>
<P>
The bill, which was discussed by the Legislative Yuan's Economics
and Energy Committee, would introduce a jail sentence of up to
one year, in addition to a fine of up to NT$50,000 in the current
law, as punishment for perpetrators of various offensive or
violent acts against animals that result in severe injuries or
death of the animals. These would include pet owners who allow
their pets to be harassed, abused or harmed; pet owners who
desert their pets; and people who harass, abuse or harm animals.
</P>
<P>
Repeat offenders would also be subject to the prison sentence,
even if their acts do not cause severe injuries or death of the
animals.
</P>
<P>
Other repeat offenders subject to the jail sentence would include
pet owners who fail to provide necessary health care for injured
or ill animals and anyone caught slaughtering animals in public
places without permission from relevant authorities.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, people could be sentenced to one year behind bars, in
addition to being fined up to NT$10,000 as stipulated under the
current law, if they commit the following acts twice in five
years.
</P>
<P>
These include failure by pet owners to register their pets'
birth, ownership, transfer, loss or death information within a
set deadline;  violation of rules concerning the transportation
of animals; and allowing pets to visit public places in the
absence of care by a person above seven years of age or without
proper protective measures.
</P>
<P>
Ruling Democratic Progressive Party Legislator Hsiao Bi-khim said
the bill signifies a major step forward in animal protection in
the country, which she said will raise awareness among the public
that it is unlawful to abuse animals.
