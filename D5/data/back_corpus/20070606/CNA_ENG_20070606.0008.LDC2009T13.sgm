U.S. URGED TO MAINTAIN 'STRATEGIC AMBIGUITY' POLICY ON TAIWAN
ISSUE
</HEADLINE>

Washington,  June 5 (CNA) 06/06/07  12:19:51 (By Chiehyu Lin and
Y.F. Low)
</P>
<P>
The United States should continue its policy of "strategic
ambiguity" on the Taiwan issue, former U.S. Secretary of State
James Baker said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Baker noted that since the U.S. government switched recognition
from Taipei to Beijing in 1979, Washington has adopted "strategic
ambiguity" as its guiding principle in dealing with Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Under this policy, Washington will not specify what action it
will take on the question of China's possible use of force
against Taiwan, while making clear to both sides of the Taiwan
Strait that the United States expects a peaceful resolution of
the Taiwan issue, Baker said.
</P>
<P>
According to Baker, the Taiwan issue will find its own resolution
eventually, and what the United States needs to do is to maintain
the cross-strait status quo.
</P>
<P>
Baker reasoned that as long as the trade and business activities
between Taiwan and China continue, cross-strait relations will
develop in a positive direction and reach a resolution in the
end.
</P>
<P>
Baker, who served as secretary of state between 1989 and 1992 in
the administration of then U.S. President George Bush, made the
remarks in response to a question from a reporter, after
delivering a speech titled "The Future of Sino-American
Relations" during a U.S.-China Business Council luncheon in
Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
Baker's remarks came in the wake of observations made by many
American  think tanks  that the cross-strait  policy  of the
administration of President George W. Bush is turning from one of
"strategic ambiguity" to one of "strategic clarity."
</P>
<P>
In a report titled "U.S.-China Relations: An Affirmative Agenda,
A Responsible Course" released in April, the New York-based
Council on Foreign Relations suggested that the United States
continue the policies of "dual restraint" and "dual assurance"
toward Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
These mean "deterring Chinese aggression and opposing Taiwan's
steps toward independence while at the same time assuring China
that the United States does not seek to perpetuate Taiwan's
separation from the mainland and assuring Taiwan that the United
States does not seek to pressure it into negotiating a final
resolution, " according to the report.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile,  in an annual report on China's military power
published in May, the U.S. Defense Department pointed out that
although the principal focus of China's military modernization in
the near term appears to be preparing for potential conflict in
the Taiwan Strait, Beijing is increasingly surveying the
strategic landscape beyond Taiwan.
