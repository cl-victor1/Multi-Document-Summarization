<P>
Premier Chang Chun-hsiung announced Wednesday that the minimum
wage will be raised by 9.09 percent on July 1.
</P>
<P>
With the hike, the minimum wage will be NT$17,280 per month and
the hourly wage will be NT$95, Chang said during a regular
Cabinet meeting at the Executive Yuan.
</P>
<P>
Relevant administrative units, including the Ministry of Economic
Affairs, the Council of Labor Affairs (CLA) , and the Council for
Economic Planning and Development, are planning to hold a press
conference later in the day to explain the new measure and their
preparations for the possible impact of the adjustment, according
to the Executive Yuan.
</P>
<P>
In response to business groups' opposition to a hike exceeding 5
percent, the CLA has proposed several sets of complementary
measures to lessen the burden on employers.
</P>
<P>
Chang recently said that the minimum wage is aimed at protecting
the livelihood of laborers and maintaining their purchasing
power, noting that the minimum wage has remained unchanged since
1997.
</P>
<P>
However, major business and industrial groups called for a
minimum wage increase of no more than 5 percent, with a minimum
hourly wage of no more than NT$82.
