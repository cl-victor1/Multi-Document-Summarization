FORMER U.S. OFFICIAL: BUSH'S 'ATTITUDE' TOWARDS CHEN A KEY

U.S. President George W. Bush's attitude toward President Chen
Shui-bian formed out of Chen's unexpected "one country on each
side" talk in 2002 remains a major obstacle in bilateral
relations, a former aid to U.S. Vice President Dick Cheney
suggested Sunday. Stephen Yates, former deputy assistant to
Cheney for national security affairs from 2001V2005, made the
remark at an international seminar held by the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party on Taiwan' democratization.
</P>
<P>
In the seminar as well as a conference session that went before
it, the hesitation  on the part  of the United  States  and
international community to give a helping hand to the democratic
Taiwan squeezed by a rising China was a central concern.

<P>
Hao Pei-chih, a public administration scholar from National
Taipei University, said Taiwan's people have a sense of
frustration over the country's current situation, especially in
comparison with South Korea, as the United States is still
hesitant to negotiate a free trade agreement with Taiwan. She
wanted to know why.
</P>
<P>
Yates said he personally feel that the United States at this
point has "an attitude towards Taiwan, not a policy or strategy".
He said that Chen's talk of both sides of Taiwan Straits as "one
country on each side" caught Washington off guard when the top
level of the U.S. government was in intensive discussion and
debate over the plans to invade Iraq and China loomed as a very
important factor to consider.
</P>
<P>
He said Chen's remark came to U.S. government as a sudden
newspaper story rather than an advanced notice through diplomatic
channels or a part of public debate ongoing for some time, and
that irritated Bush.
</P>
<P>
Yates said Bush is hard to change his mind once he has had
judgement for someone, and Chen was since labeled. He said
similar incidents repeated again and again and that has some
impact on the way the administration treats Taiwan. But Lo Chih-
cheng, Chairman of the Department of Political Science of Soochow
University, said sometimes "surprises" may be good. "If Taiwan's
going to do something anyway because of some domestic forces,"
then it is better not to communicate with the U.S. to avoid
embarrassment both sides.
