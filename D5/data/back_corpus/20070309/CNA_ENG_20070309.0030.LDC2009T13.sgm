The Cabinet-level Council of Labor Affairs (CLA) announced Friday
that it has begun to accept applications from women who want to
make use of a new small- amount loan program to start their own
businesses.

<P>
A CLA spokesman pointed out that under the loan program --
announced on Women's Day the previous day by Premier Su Tseng-
chang as a "gift from the government" to Taiwan's women -- all
women aged between 20 and 65 can apply for loans of up to
NT$500,000 to create their own businesses.

<P>
However,  the spokesman added, the applicants must receive
vocational training in a related field first and submit a
business creation plan along with the loan applications.
</P>
<P>
All the loans under the program will carry an interest rate of
2.83 percent per year, with the payback period extended to seven
years.
</P>
<P>
The government has requested the Employment Security Fund and the
Small- and Medium-Business Credit Guarantee Fund of Taiwan to
provide credit guarantees totaling NT$1 billion.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said women hoping to start their own businesses can
contact the CLA, which will arrange business training classes for
the applicants and help them with their business creation plans
in order to apply for a loan.
