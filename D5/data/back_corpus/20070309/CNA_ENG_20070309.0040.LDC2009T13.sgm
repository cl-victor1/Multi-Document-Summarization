VICE PRESIDENT ACCEPTS AP, CNN EXPLANATIONS
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  March 9 (CNA) 03/09/07  23:19:35 (By Y.C. Jou)

<P>
Vice President Annette Lu said Friday that she accepted
explanations from the Associated Press (AP) and the Cable News
Network (CNN) about their inappropriate reference to her when
covering her presidential bid Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
A Presidential Office news release said Lu's office received
letters from AP President and Chief Executive Officer Thomas
Curley and CNN Executive Vice President Chris Cramer.
</P>
<P>
The Presidential Office said the quick responses showed their
desire to deal carefully with the incident, as well as respect
for Taiwan and the vice president.
</P>
<P>
Without releasing the original text of the letters, the news
release cited Curley as saying that AP would like to interview Lu
and make corrections without hesitation if the report in question
contains faults in citation or translation.
</P>
<P>
According to the news release, Curley said AP does not agree with
the attacks on Lu it cited, that it respects the significant
position the Taiwanese government and people have in the Asia and
Pacific region, and that covering Taiwan's presidential election
will be a major task for AP in Asia in the coming year.
</P>
<P>
Curley said AP has no disrespect for Taiwan or Lu and will make
more coverage of her presidential bid.
</P>
<P>
On the CNN letter, the news release cited Cramer as saying that
CNN had no intention of being derogatory to Taiwan or Lu, that it
should not have used the AP's wording as its headline, that it
had swiftly  changed the headline  and that it had published  an
announcement explaining its change of headline before ever being
challenged.
</P>
<P>
The news release said it is comforting that the incident
involving an insult on Taiwan has quickly gained positive
results, thanks to the nation's consensus in defending its
dignity, and that the vice president is grateful to President
Chen Shui-bian, Premier Su Tseng-cheng, and "all circles" of the
country.
</P>
<P>
Reporting Tuesday on Lu's candidacy registration with the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party for the party's primary for the 2008
presidential election, an AP story described Lu as an "outspoken"
vice president whom China has called "insane" and "the scum of
the nation. CNN posted the AP article on its Web site later that
day under the derogatory headline: "Taiwan's 'scum of the nation'
runs for president."
</P>
<P>
The Presidential Office filed protests with the two media outlets
and demanded a response within 48 hours.
