Main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) acting Chairman Wu Poh-hsiung
will resign following his decision to vie for the party's top
post, sources close to Wu said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Wu is expected to present his resignation at a weekly meeting of
the KMT Central Standing Committee slated for March 14, one of
his aides said, adding that KMT Vice Chairman P.K. Chiang will
take over as the party's acting chairman.
</P>
<P>
In addition to Wu, KMT Legislator Hung Hsiu-chun will also run
for the party chairmanship. The two hopefuls will register their
bids for the chairmanship by- election March 18 and party members
will elect a new leader in a direct vote April 7.
</P>
<P>
The by-election was made necessary by Ma's resignation as KMT
chairman Feb. 13 immediately after he was indicted on corruption
charges for his alleged misuse of a special allowance fund for
his discretionary use during his two terms as Taipei mayor from
1998 - 2006. Ma simultaneously announced that he will run in the
2008 presidential election.
