Cyclists who jump the light or ride in traffic lanes reserved for
automobiles may be subject to fines from Sept. 1, Taipei city
government officials said at a meeting Friday.
</P>
<P>
In light of the increasing number of bicycle-related accidents in
Taipei city over the past two years, officials from the
Department of Transportation plan to mete out fines to bikers who
violate traffic regulations, while at the same time crafting
measures to bolster the cyclists' safety on the road and
facilitate their riding activities.
</P>
<P>
A total of 919 cases involving cyclists were reported in Taipei
city in 2005, and another 885 cases were reported in 2006,
including seven deaths, Department of Transportation officials
said.
</P>
<P>
Once the corrective measures are brought into force,  the
officials said, the violators could be subject to fines ranging
from NT$300 to NT$600 for light jumping or riding on or in the
fast lanes.
</P>
<P>
Department of Transportation Director Lo Hsiao-hsien said almost
all countries around the world have regulations and penalties
governing bikers. In the United States, for instance, cyclists
may be fined between US$25 and US$100 for not wearing a safety
helmet during riding.
</P>
<P>
New measures may also make it mandatory for Taipei bikers to wear
a safety helmet while riding, Lo added.
</P>
<P>
The Department of Transportation plans to launch a publicity
campaign for the penalty program beginning April 1, to be
followed by a warning period starting July 1, in preparation for
the official launch of the program Sept. 1, Lo said at the
meeting.
</P>
<P>
However, Taipei Mayor Hau Lung-bin, who was also present at the
meeting, said the publicity and warning periods should be
prolonged to allow Taipei residents more time to prepare for the
new policy.
