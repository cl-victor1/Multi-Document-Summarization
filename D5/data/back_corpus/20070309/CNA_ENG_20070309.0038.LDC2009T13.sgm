</HEADLINE>

Taipei, March 9 (CNA) 03/09/07  22:12:14 (By Han Nai-kuo)
</P>
<P>
The government will not expel the Associate Press reporter who
used derogatory terms to describe Vice President Annette Lu in a
March 6 report, Government Information Office head Cheng Wen-
tsang said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Amid  demands  from legislators  of the ruling  Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) that Min Lee, an AP reporter from Hong
Kong, be expelled from Taiwan within 24 hours, Cheng said the
government will not revoke Lee's visa because both President Chen
Shui-bian and Lu have said that freedom of the press should be
safeguarded.
</P>
<P>
Noting that Lee is not stationed in Taiwan on a long-term basis
and is only here on a short stay to cover certain events, Cheng
said there is no question of the government  revoking Lee's press
accreditation.
</P>
<P>
In a dispatch from Taipei March 6, Lee quoted China's state-run
media as describing Lu as "insane" and "scum of the nation" and
said that she has little chance of being elected president in
2008.
</P>
<P>
Lu's office has demanded an apology from the AP, as well as from
the U.S.-based Cable News Network (CNN) for using the AP report
under an insulting headline in its online edition.
</P>
<P>
According to Lu, the wording of the CNN headline and the AP story
was not only an affront to her, but a great insult to Taiwan's
people.
</P>
<P>
Two DPP legislators -- Tsai Chi-fang and Hou Shui-sheng -- urged
the government to expel the AP reporter, while Legislator Lee
Hung-chun of the opposition People First Party suggested that the
vice president should sue him for libel.
