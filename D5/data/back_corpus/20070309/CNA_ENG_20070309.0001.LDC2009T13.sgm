Taipei,  March 8 (CNA) 03/09/07  10:58:44 (By Y.C. Jou)

The government is to set up an office of trade representatives in
charge of foreign trade negotiations, with Taiwan's deputy
representative to the United States John C.C. Deng being
recommended to serve as the first chief representative, the
Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan's international trade negotiations, including the Trade
and Investment Framework Agreement (TIFA) between Taiwan and the
United States, Free Trade Agreements (FTAs) and talks in the
World Trade Organization (WTO), will be come under the
jurisdiction of the new office, which is scheduled to start
operations at the end of March, MOEA officials said.
</P>
<P>
Once approved the chief representative of the office will be
granted the title of Ambassador. To that end,  the MOEA has
recommended Deng to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, from where
his nomination will be forwarded on to the premier before the
candidate is finally formal nominated to the post, officials
said.
</P>
<P>
Deng had been Vice Chairman of the Mainland Affairs Council and
Taiwan's Deputy Representative to the WTO before assuming his
current post in July 2006.
</P>
<P>
The new office will have two deputy chiefs, with one each from
the fields of trade and foreign affairs, three senior
negotiators, seven negotiatorss and administrative staff for a
total of 28-35 people, the MOEA said.
</P>
<P>
Currently a team led by the vice premier is responsible for
drawing up trade negotiation strategies while actual talks are
carried out by senior officials from the ministries, officials
said.
</P>
<P>
However, ever-increasing complexity and the burden of the case
loads involved in trade negotiations require the government to
set up a specialized institution, modeled on the Office of the
United States Trade Representatives (USTR) , to ensure quality
and efficiency of negotiation.
</P>
<P>
Government agencies, such as the Bureau of Foreign Trade, that
will be discharged of their responsibilities in conducting trade
talks, will be reassigned to forming negotiation policies and
conducting research, the MOEA said.
