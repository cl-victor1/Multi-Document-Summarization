FORMER PREMIER MULLING PRESIDENTIAL BID
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  Jan. 30 (CNA) 01/30/07  16:41:11 (By Y.F. Low)

<P>
Former Premier Frank Hsieh said Monday he is seriously
considering whether to run for the presidency in 2008 and when to
announce his bid if he decides to do so.
</P>
<P>
Making the remarks during an interview with SET TV, Hsieh said,
if it happens, such an announcement should be made as soon as
possible since there is only one year remaining before the
election.
</P>
<P>
However, Hsieh said he first needs to complete a tour of Taiwan's
23 counties and cities to assess his own ability to shoulder such
a great responsibility and to evaluate his support among the
people.
</P>
<P>
In light of the large number of potential candidates for the
presidency within the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) ,
Hsieh suggested that the party try to mediate between the
aspirants before resorting to a primary to decide upon a
candidate.
</P>
<P>
According to Hsieh, the DPP must win by at least 250,000 votes in
the next presidential  election  in order to ensure political
stability.
</P>
<P>
Asked about the possibility that Hsieh might pick incumbent
Premier Su Tseng- chang as his running mate, Hsieh said making
such a proposal at this time would be very impolite to Su, who is
widely believed to be another possible  DPP candidate  for the
2008 presidency.
</P>
<P>
As to whether former Kaohsiung Acting Mayor Yeh Chu-lan is
another possible choice as his running mate, Hsieh said he has
never discussed this matter with Yeh.
</P>
<P>
On cross-strait policy, Hsieh said Taiwan must maintain its
prestige as an independent, sovereign state but should not adopt
a closed-door policy towards China.
</P>
<P>
Asserting that Taiwan must open up to the world, Hsieh said he
supports removing the ban on direct cross-strait transport,
business and mail links to halt the business exodus to China, as
long as such exchanges do not threaten Taiwan's security.
</P>
<P>
Also, Taiwan should reject China's attempt to compel Taiwan to
accept the "one China" principle as the precondition of opening
direct cross-strait links, he said.
