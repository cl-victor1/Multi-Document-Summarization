Premier Su Tseng-chang presided over a ceremony  Tuesday to open
the 2007 Taipei International  Book Exhibition (TIBE) at the
Taipei World Trade Center.

In his address at the ceremony, Su encouraged people to read good
books to absorb other people's wisdom, saying that by spending
half a day reading, one may be able to obtain knowledge that the
writer has spent a whole lifetime acquiring.

The theme of the fair, the 15th of its kind since 1987, centers
on Russia, with various publications and relevant products
featuring the literature, culture, philosophy, writers, movies,
arts and lifestyles of the country being displayed at the theme
pavilion.

Chekhov's (1860-1904) classic short story "A Chameleon, " with
each book measuring just 0.09 cm by 0.09 cm.
