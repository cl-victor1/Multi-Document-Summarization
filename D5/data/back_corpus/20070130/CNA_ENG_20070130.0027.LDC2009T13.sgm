DPP HEAD ATTACKS KMT OVER FAILED 2007 GOVERNMENT BUDGET BILL
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  Jan. 30 (CNA) 01/30/07  18:43:19 (By Flor Wang)

The main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) must be held accountable for
the failure to pass the 2007 government budget bill at the
Legislative Yuan, which is of the greatest importance to the
people's livelihoods, ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)
Chairman You Shyi-kun said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
You made the remarks during a visit to the DPP's caucus at the
Hualien county's council in eastern Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
You attacked the KMT for blocking the bill's passage in the
legislature and asked KMT Chairman Ma Ying-jeou to reflect on his
party's lack of concern for the public interest and welfare.
</P>
<P>
The government budget is the most significant bill that the
Legislative Yuan has to deal with every year and its failure to
pass is set to affect local governments' operations, You said,
warning the KMT not to abuse the DPP's good faith nor turn a
blind eye to the people's needs.
</P>
<P>
Tsai Chin-lung, the KMT's legislative caucus whip blasted Premier
Su Tseng-chang for his comments that the country's gross domestic
product (GDP) would suffer a decrease of at least 0.25 percentage
points per month if the government budget bill is delayed.
</P>
<P>
Calling on Su and Hsu Yao-chang, director general of the Ministry
of Finance's Department of Statistics, to provide an explanation
of the issue and urging Su not to pass the buck for Taiwan's
economic sluggishness to the opposition, Tsai called Su's
paradoxical rhetoric a "mean trick" and accused the premier of
smearing the Legislative Yuan, and of trying to fool and extort
the people.
</P>
<P>
According to Tsai, the postponement in passing the government's
budget bill will affect only the launch of new government
projects and will not hinder the administration's operations.
</P>
<P>
KMT lawmaker Hsu Shao-ping asked the Cabinet-level Directorate
General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics why it can not lend
money this year to financially troubled city and county
governments as well as villages and townships at a time when the
Executive Yuan still has more than NT$10 billion in its special
allocation funds.
</P>
<P>
A country's increase in GDP mainly relies on its expansion in
foreign trade and the country would become bankrupt sooner or
later if it depends on government budget appropriations to boost
GDP growth, KMT lawmaker Lin Teh-fu said.
</P>
<P>
The ruling party must be held fully responsible  for the
government budget bill's failure in the Legislative Yuan, because
it was the DPP itself that decided not to open an extra session
to deal with several key bills and issues pending approval, said
Lin.
</P>
<P>
The latest legislative session ended Jan. 19 amid open fighting
between KMT and DPP lawmakers over the draft Organic Law of the
Central Election Commission that was the first item on the agenda
to be addressed.
</P>
<P>
DPP lawmakers resorted to violence to block a vote on the draft
law, provoking tussles with their KMT counterparts and leaving a
few important bills in limbo, including the 2007 government
budget bill and a major military procurement bill that would
allow the government to purchase defense weapons from the United
States.
