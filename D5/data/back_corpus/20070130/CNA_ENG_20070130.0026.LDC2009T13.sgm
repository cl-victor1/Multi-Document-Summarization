The government is hoping that Taiwan will become a non-
governmental-organization (NGO) center in the Asia Pacific
region, an official of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA)
said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Wang Chih-fa, executive secretary of the NGO Affairs Committee of
the MOFA, also said that the Ministry of the Interior is planning
to set up an international NGO convention center in Chung Hsing
New Village, Nantou for the use of international NGOs wishing to
establish headquarters in Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Chung Hsing New Village is the site of the Taiwan Provincial
Government  which was downsized  in the late  1990s  through
constitutional amendments.
</P>
<P>
Wang noted that Vice President Annette Lu had earlier proposed
that Taiwan become a center of international NGOs. The Executive
Yuan attaches great importance to her proposal, and lists it as a
major policy, he continued.
</P>
<P>
The ministry is actively soliciting international NGOs to set up
headquarters here, and is looking at incentives to offer, he
added.
</P>
<P>
He noted that currently many international NGOs hope to establish
exchanges with Chinese groups, but said that with a number of
political restrictions in place in China, Taiwan enjoys a
comparative geographical advantage in attracting those NGOs.
</P>
<P>
If international NGOs establish footholds in Taiwan, they will
provide another means for the international community to gain a
better understanding of Taiwan and be more likely to lend it
support, he said.
