The Council of Indigenous People (CIP) will grant a medal to Yang
Chuna-Kwan, the "Asian Iron Man" in recognition of his
achievements and contributions to sport, a CIP spokesman said
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Yang died Jan. 28 of a brain hemorrhage after suffering a stroke
in California at the age of 73. The CIP lamented on Yang's death
and said it will help with the funeral affairs.
</P>
<P>
Yang, Taiwan's first Olympic medalist, was born into the
indigenous Ami tribe in Taitung, and showed a proficiency in
sports at a very young age. Dubbed the "Asian Iron Man" after
winning a gold medal in the 1954 Asian Games in Manila, Yang then
won a silver medal in the men's decathlon at the 1960 Rome
Olympics.

<P>
According to the spokesman, Yang was the first Chinese athlete
included in the Hall of Fame of the International Association of
Athletics (IAAF). He is not only regarded as the pride of
indigenous people, but also the glory of Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
In addition to granting a medal to the indigenous national hero,
the CIP will also work with the National Council on Physical
Fitness and Sports and the Taiwan Indigenous Television to
collect films and profiles of Yang in an effort to produce a
feature report in memory of Yang's achievements.
