<P>
Former Premier Frank Hsieh left for the United States Tuesday to
attend the annual National Prayer Breakfast on behalf of
President Chen Shui-bian.
</P>
<P>
The 55th National Prayer Breakfast is scheduled to be held in
Washington D.C. Feb. 1. U.S. President George W. Bush will give
the keynote speech at the breakfast to nearly 5,000, which will
include members of Congress and guests from around the world.
</P>
<P>
Hsieh said that he met President Chen prior to his departure and
the president asked him to explain the stalled arms procurement
package from the United States should the opportunity arise.
</P>
<P>
He was referring  to the package  of eight  diesel-fueled
submarines, a squadron of 12 P-3C anti-submarine helicopters and
six anti-missile Patriot PAC-3 batteries that has been blocked by
the opposition-controlled legislature for nearly three years.
</P>
<P>
The president also encouraged him to meet with Taiwan expatriate
groups in the United States, Hsieh said.
</P>
<P>
On the progress of a probe into the mass rapid transit (MRT)
system scandal in Kaohsiung, where Hsieh served for two terms as
mayor before assuming the premiership in early 2005, Hsieh said
the latest development in the case has once again vindicated him,
showing that he was not involved in any wrongdoing in the
scandal.
</P>
<P>
Hsieh, an aspirant of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) for the 2008 presidential election, also said that he is
seriously considering a bid for the presidency.
</P>
<P>
As such, it is not appropriate for him to comment on the
mechanism for selecting the party's candidate, Hsieh said.
