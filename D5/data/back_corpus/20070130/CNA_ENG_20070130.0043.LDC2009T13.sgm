To help stem the spread of AIDS and sexually transmitted diseases
among drug abusers and get heroin addicts off drugs, the
government is slated from April to offer a program in this
regard, a spokesman for the Ministry of Justice said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
According to the spokesman, the ministry and the Cabinet-level
Department of Health (DOH) will offer an alternative program to
heroin addicts, the largest group of local drug abusers, to help
them get clean and contain the increase of disease and drug-
related crime such as burglary and robbery.
</P>
<P>
Currently, there are about 200,000 drug addicts in Taiwan, with
between 50,000 and 100,000 using heroin, making it the most
abused illegal drug in the country, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, needle-sharing has become the leading factor
behind the increased spread of AIDS-HIV in Taiwan, he pointed
out.
</P>
<P>
Under the alternative program, heroin addicts who voluntarily
take part in methadone and mental therapy provided by the
government would be given a suspended indictment and would be
entitled to NT$4,500  in government  subsidies for their first
month  of rehabilitation, he explained.
</P>
<P>
The DOH is also considering increasing the subsidy to NT$16,000
per year for heroin addicts who undergo methadone therapy, he
said, adding that the DOH has a one-year stock of methadone
sufficient to treat 6,000 heroin addicts.
</P>
<P>
According to DOH Minister Hou Sheng-mao, the DOH and the Justice
Ministry started an alternative methadone therapy program on a
trial basis last September. A total of 194 heroin addicts who
participated in the program at the DOH's southern rehabilitation
center have fully quit the drug, with only one failing to do so.
</P>
<P>
Over the past year, the number of new AIDS-HIV patients has
noticeably dropped to 2,942 from the previous year's level of
3,399 -- the first such decrease in 22 years, DOH officials said.
</P>
<P>
According to Tainan Deputy Magistrate Yen Tsun-tso, who spoke at
a news conference held by the DOH's Chianan Rehabilitation
Center, a much larger number of heroin abusers undergoing
methadone therapy in the Tainan area have succeeded in leading
normal lives and going back to work.
</P>
<P>
In the past, only about 20 percent of drug abusers going through
the therapy were able to return to work, but the ratio has picked
up to about 85 percent, Yen said, pointing out that the
development has been a major stabilizing force in society and a
significant stimulus to the local economy and improvement in
human rights.
</P>
<P>
Following in the footsteps of the Chianan center, hospitals in
the Tainan area, including National Cheng Kung University
Hospital, the DOH's Tainan Hospital, and Chi Mei Foundation
Medical Center also joined the DOH's methadone program Jan. 30,
and local convenience stores, in conjunction with the DOH, are
slated to begin offering free clean needles for heroin addicts,
Yen said.
</P>
<P>
Yen expressed hope that drug abusers can be properly treated as
patients and receive therapy so as to mitigate their threat to
society.
