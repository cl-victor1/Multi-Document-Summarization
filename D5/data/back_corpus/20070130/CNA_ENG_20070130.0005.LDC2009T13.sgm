BUDGET DELAY PUTS ECONOMY AT STAKE: SPOKESMAN
</HEADLINE>

Taipei, Jan. 29 (CNA) 01/30/07  10:43:55 (By Sofia Wu)

<P>
The Legislative Yuan's decision not to call an extra session to
deal with the government's 2007 budget bill amid a prolonged
political standoff has put the country's economy at stake,
government spokesman Cheng Wen-tsang said Monday.
</P>
<P>
The current law requires the legislature to approve the budget
one month before the fiscal year begins on Jan. 1, and the delay
could hurt the economy by stalling public projects and possibly
raising unemployment, Cheng said.
</P>
<P>
Amid constant squabbles between the ruling Democratic Progressive
Party (DPP) and the opposition "pan-blue alliance" of the
Kuomintang (KMT) and the People First Party, the legislature
ended its last session Jan. 19 without approving the Cabinet-
proposed new budget and several other key bills.
</P>
<P>
The DPP administration originally hoped that the legislature held
a special session to address the budget bill. As lawmakers from
across the political spectrum failed to agree on its agenda, they
decided at an informal talk session Monday not to convene any
extra session.
</P>
<P>
The opposition-controlled legislature is not expected to address
the 2007 budget bill until March because the legislature will
first hold general interpellation sessions when the new
legislative session opens next month.
</P>
<P>
Should that be the case, Cheng said the central and local
government operations will all be affected and gross domestic
product (GDP) will be driven down while unemployment rate rises.
</P>
<P>
According  to legal  provisions,  only  regular  government
expenditure can be appropriated before the legislature passes the
budget bill for the new year.
</P>
<P>
As a result,  Cheng said,  the government's  new national
development projects, worth NT$70 billion, including NT$54.7
billion in  defense  investment  and NT$4  billion  in
infrastructure construction, cannot get off the ground at least
in the coming two months.
</P>
<P>
Quoting an estimate by the Council for Economic Planning and
Development, Cheng said the country's 2007 GDP growth rate could
be driven down by 0.15 percentage point if the passage of the
budget bill is postponed to March.
</P>
<P>
With NT$70 billion in pump priming funding withheld, Cheng said
it has become uncertain whether the country would be able to
achieve its GDP growth target of 4.6 percent projected for this
year.
