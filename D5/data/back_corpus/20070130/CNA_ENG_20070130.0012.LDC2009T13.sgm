An eight-year-old girl has died of serious complications
triggered by type B influenza, marking the fourth flu-related
fatality recorded in Taiwan this winter, the Center for Disease
Control (CDC) reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The case is the third flu-related death reported over the past
two weeks, CDC officials.
</P>
<P>
The victim, who was a Changhua resident, came down with fever and
experienced loss of appetite Jan. 16 and then began displaying
symptoms of sleepiness and red, swollen eyes Jan. 21, the
officials said.
</P>
<P>
Hospitalized Jan. 23 for severe sleepiness,  the girl was
diagnosed as suffering from acute myocarditis and died later the
same day from multiple organ failure, they said.
</P>
<P>
According to CDC Deputy Director-General Shih Wen-yi, tests
confirmed that the girl was infected with type B influenza, and
she had not received flu vaccination for two consecutive years.
</P>
<P>
CDC tallies show that 19 cases of severe influenza have been
reported this year, with all four fatalities caused by the type B
influenza virus.
</P>
<P>
Shih said that although the number of flu cases reported around
the country has been declining, the CDC will hold a meeting in
the near future to discuss measures to better control the
outbreak.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, CDC officials reminded the public that receiving flu
vaccination is the most effective preventative measure.
</P>
<P>
Noting that there are still 40,000 doses of free vaccines
available for children between six months and three years old,
the officials urged parents to have their children vaccinated as
soon as possible.
