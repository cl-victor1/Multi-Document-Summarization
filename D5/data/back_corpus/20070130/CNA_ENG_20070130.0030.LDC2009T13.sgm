KMT-PFP EXPECTED TO COOPERATE WELL FIELDING LEGISLATIVE
CANDIDATES

Taipei,  Jan. 30 (CNA) 01/30/07  19:07:47 (By Han Nai-kuo)
</P>
<P>
Taiwan's two largest opposition parties -- the Kuomintang (KMT)
and the People First Party (PFP) -- will have no difficulty
fielding candidates jointly in the year-end legislative election,
except in a couple of electoral districts, a PFP lawmaker said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Legislator Chang Hsien-yao, director of the PFP's Center of
Policy Research, made the remarks when asked to comment on a
report by the Chinese-language United Daily that out of the 73
electoral districts, KMT and PFP candidates will clash fiercely
over the joint nominations in at least 17 districts.
</P>
<P>
Chang said that after a careful evaluation, he would say that
only a couple of districts may have difficulty producing a single
candidate. However, he declined to name those districts.
</P>
<P>
Chang said KMT Secretary-General  Wu Den-yih  and his PFP
counterpart Chin Chin- sheng have agreed in principle that after
the candidates are produced through a mutual cooperation
mechanism, the KMT and the PFP will negotiate with the Non-
Partisan Solidarity Union (NPSU) on the possibility of jointly
fielding a single candidate for each district.
</P>
<P>
He added that the "pan-blue alliance" of the KMT and the PFP
should not neglect the interests of the NPSU because its has been
a long-term ally of both the KMT and the PFP.
</P>
<P>
The KMT and the PFP signed an agreement Jan. 22 to create a
mutual cooperation platform on which they will field candidates
jointly in the upcoming legislative election.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, both parties will try to persuade candidates
whose approval ratings in polls lag far behind to yield to
candidates who enjoy greater support, and that only when two or
more candidates are running neck and neck in a single electoral
district will they use primary elections to determine a single
nominee.
</P>
<P>
The legislative election at the end of this year will use a
"single-member constituency, two-vote system, " with the number
of legislators slashed from 225 to 113 and their term extended
from three years to four.
</P>
<P>
Many incumbent legislators from both the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party and the opposition parties are expected to lose
their seats, although the new system will be decidedly less
favorable to candidates of smaller political parties, including
the PFP.
</P>
<P>
The PFP was founded by James Soong in 2000 after he -- a member
of the KMT at the time -- failed in his run as an independent
candidate in the presidential election that year. Like the KMT,
the PFP opposes Taiwan independence  and favors Taiwan's
eventual reunification with China.
</P>
<P>
The KMT and PFP have maintained a close working relationship, and
together hold a slim majority in the 219-seat legislature. The
relationship is sometimes tense, especially in election years,
because they have to compete for support from the same voters.
</P>
<P>
In the past year, the PFP has been sliding toward marginalization
after 12 of its 34 legislators switched allegiance to the KMT,
making the KMT the largest party in the legislature with 90
seats.
