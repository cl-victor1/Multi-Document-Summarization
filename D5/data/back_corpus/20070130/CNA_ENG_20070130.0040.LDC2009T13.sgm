President Chen Shui-bian said Tuesday that he would rather
suggest relocating the headquarters of some Cabinet units like
the Council of Agriculture (COA) and the Council of Labor Affairs
(CLA), to southern Taiwan than move the captial from Taipei to
southern Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Chen make the suggestion during a meeting with Taipei Mayor Hau
Lung-bin and Kaohsiung Mayor Chen Chu at his office after Chen
Chu expressed hope that the central government will carry out the
idea of so-called "double administrative cores" as part of
efforts to seek balanced city development.
</P>
<P>
It is possible for a country to have more than one capital city,
Chen said, noting that in South Africa, there is an
administrative capital city, and legislative capital city and a
judicial capital city.
</P>
<P>
However, it is not possible for every city in the country to be a
capital,  he added, saying he believes an unbalanced resource
distribution is why some people have demanded the relocation of
the capital city from Taipei to a city in central or southern
Taiwan.
