DPP CALLS FOR HEED TO SUPPRESSION OF `PAN-BLUE' SUPPORTERS IN
CHINA
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  May 26 (CNA) 05/26/07  14:58:31 (By Sofia Wu)

<P>
A ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) official urged the
main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Saturday to voice concern and do
something for its sympathizers in China who he claimed are
"obviously enduring merciless suppression" by the Chinese
authorities.
</P>
<P>
Lai I-chung, director of the DPP's China Affairs Department, said
the KMT charter includes a provision that residents in China who
are willing to strive with the KMT for "the goal of national
unification" are considered "members of the party in spirit."
</P>
<P>
According to Lai, when KMT Honorary Chairman Lien Chan traveled
to China last month to preside over an economic forum organized
by the KMT and the Communist Party of China (CPC), supporters and
sympathizers of the KMT-led "pan-blue alliance" in various
Chinese cities tried but failed to mount a welcoming party for
Lien due to oppression by the Chinese authorities.
</P>
<P>
At one point, Lai said, Chinese public security officers even
forcefully prevented Chinese "pan-blue" supporters from getting
close to the Lien-led KMT delegation and Taiwanese reporters
covering the event.
</P>
<P>
In the wake of the KMT-CPC forum, Lai quoted media reports as
saying that the Chinese authorities have continued a crackdown on
pro-KMT groups in Henan, Jilin, Hunan, Sichuan and other
provinces. Over the past month, he claimed, many Chinese "pan-
blue" supporters or sympathizers have been intimidated or
detained.
</P>
<P>
According to the latest media report, Lai went on, Sun Buer, head
of a "pan-blue alliance" supporters group in central China's
Wuhan Province, disappeared after his home was ransacked by armed
police.
</P>
<P>
"All these incidents point to the distressing development that
the Beijing leadership has tightened up its repressive measures
against pro-'pan-blue alliance' groups in China because they have
taken part in pro-human rights, pro- freedom and pro-democracy
activities in major Chinese cities and provinces," Lai said.
</P>
<P>
Regrettably, Lai lamented, the KMT leadership has said nothing
about these developments.
</P>
<P>
"Much to my surprise and disappointment, senior KMT officials
have denied any links to Chinese KMT supporters and have
consistently kept mum when China's Taiwan Affairs Office has
claimed on numerous occasions that 'pan-blue alliance' support
groups in China are illegal and outlawed," Lai said.
</P>
<P>
Now that the KMT is considering amending its charter to keep pace
with the mainstream values in Taiwan, Lai said, the KMT
authorities should squarely face up to the cold reality of
China's unmerciful suppression of its Chinese sympathizers or
"members in spirit."
</P>
<P>
"The KMT leadership should publicly condemn Beijing's oppression
of pro-reform and pro-human rights activists in China and stop
collaborating with the CPC in sponsoring any forums," Lai urged.
