LEGISLATIVE SPEAKER CLOSE-MOUTHED ON PRESIDENTIAL TICKET
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taipei,  May 25 (CNA) 05/26/07  11:14:52 (By Flor Wang)

Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng remained close-mouthed
Friday about the possibility of his forming a presidential
ticket with former Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Ma Ying-jeou, saying
only that he will "do his best to cooperate."
</P>
<P>
Wang made the remarks while answering questions from reporters
after Ma said earlier in the day that the issue must not be
further procrastinated over to avoid stirring up greater
resentment among supporters. Ma asked Wang to make his position
clear by the end of May.
</P>
<P>
In response to inquires from the media, Wang replied that he will
certainly come out with a quick answer should Ma approach him
with such a request. "I will give a clear and comprehensive
explanation as soon as I make a decision," he added.
</P>
<P>
Wang did not rule out the possibility of meeting Ma in two or
three days and said he will collaborate with Ma "as much as he
can" and give precedence to the KMT's interests over his personal
feelings about working with Ma.
</P>
<P>
The legislative speaker also brushed aside speculation that he is
slated to visit China in mid-June, calling it just wishful
thinking on the part of Taipei Mayor Hau Lung-bin. Wang said that
his China visit is still being arranged, although mid-June is
when the current legislative session is supposed to adjourn.
</P>
<P>
Hau told reporters about Wang's trip following a visit to Wang
that day at the Legislative Yuan.
</P>
<P>
According to Hau, Wang is expected to visit China to deal with
issues concerning direct charter flights between Taiwan and
China. "Taipei City would benefit a great deal from direct air
links across the Taiwan Strait, " Hau said.
</P>
<P>
He visited Wang to ask the legislative speaker to help mediate a
dispute regarding the changing of the name of the National Taiwan
Democracy Memorial Hall -- previously known as the Chiang Kai-
shek Memorial Hall -- between the Taipei city government and the
Ministry of Education.
</P>
<P>
Hau asked Wang, in his capacity as chief of the legislature, to
invite officials from the city government and the Ministry of
Education  to discuss the issue and find a way to ease the
confrontation between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
Although the memorial hall was renamed by the ministry last
weekend, the Taipei city government insists that the central
government name change via an administrative order was unlawful
and has vowed to counteract it in compliance with the law.
