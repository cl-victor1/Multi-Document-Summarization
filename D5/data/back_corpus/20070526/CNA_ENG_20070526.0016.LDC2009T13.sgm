KMT PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE TALKS ABOUT POLITICAL IDEAS
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,   May  26  (CNA) 05/26/07  17:14:07 (By Elizabeth Hsu)

The opposition Kuomintang's (KMT's) presidential candidate, Ma
Ying-jeou, said Saturday that there should be no estrangement
among the different ethnic groups in Taiwan, adding that if he
wins the presidency in 2008, he will serve as a statesman who
cares for well-being of the next generation rather than a
politician concerned only with his next election campaign.
</P>
<P>
Referring to himself as "Wadan, " an Atayal tribal name, Ma said
that if he gets the chance, he will restore "Taiwanese
traditional core values" of integrity, honesty,  diligence,
tolerance and pragmatism.
</P>
<P>
The former KMT chairman elaborated on his political ideas in a
speech at the 2007 Young Scholars Forum held by National Normal
University. He noted that over the past seven years, Taiwan has
been dominated by a pan-political ideology. As a result, society
has been torn apart, with people in the educational, military and
judiciary sectors -- who should be independent in political
disputes -- all taking part in the political struggle.
</P>
<P>
Traditional core values have all been distorted under the effect
of the pan- political ideology, according to Ma.
</P>
<P>
The presidential  hopeful claimed  there are many economic
indicators to show that Taiwan has been marking time or moving
backward in the work of pushing for economic development since
the Democratic Progressive Party took power in 2000.
</P>
<P>
Over the past seven years, Ma claimed the Gross Domestic Product
(GDP) per capita of the United States grew US$10,000, while that
of South Korea increased US$7,000 and that of Singapore rose
US$6,000. In Taiwan, it moved up just US$1,100, he said.
</P>
<P>
At present, the national income registers US$15,640 per capita in
Taiwan. If the KMT regains power next year, and the economic
growth rate can be lifted to and maintained at a level above
6percent, Ma said that he expects the per capita national income
will increase to US$20,000 by 2011.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on cross-Taiwan Strait relations, Ma said wisdom, not
power, is the best way for a small country like Taiwan to face
challenges from a big power like China, while expressing hope
that the bigger country will treat the smaller one with kindness
and tolerance.
