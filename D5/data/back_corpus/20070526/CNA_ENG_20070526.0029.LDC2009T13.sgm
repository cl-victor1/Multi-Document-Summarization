PRESIDENT HELPS SELL LYCHEES IN KAOHSIUNG COUNTY
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Kaohsiung,  May 26 (CNA) 05/26/07  21:28:43 (By Flor Wang)
</P>
<P>
President Chen Shui-bian acted Saturday as spokesman for locally
grown lychees in Tashu township in Kaohsiung County, southern
Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Touting the Jade Purse variety of lychee as the world's finest
fruit, Chen helped sell more than 17,700 boxes in a Kaohsiung
County cultural and tourist festival featuring the fruit.
</P>
<P>
Kaohsiung Magistrate Yang Chiu-hsing said that the county will
export 30 metric tons of Jade Purse lychees to Japan this year,
for the first time in history.
</P>
<P>
Chen also ordered 600 boxes of the fruit as gifts for foreign
ambassadors and representatives stationed in Taiwan to mark the
approach of the annual Dragon Boat Festival.
</P>
<P>
Turning to the political front, Chen said that "an opposition
party" has since his re-election in 2004 been dancing to
Beijing's tune by encouraging Taiwan farmers to sell their
produce to China in an attempt to alienate them from the
government. Farmers have traditionally  been strong supporters of
the ruling Democratic Progressive Party.
</P>
<P>
But he said that Japan, Europe and the United States, rather than
China, are better export markets for Taiwan products, evidenced
in that Taiwan farmers only exported some 180 metric tons of
bananas to China last year -- a far cry from the 2,000 metric
tons level that the opposition Kuomintang promised they could
reach.
</P>
<P>
After many years of efforts, Taiwan has successfully exported
papayas and mangoes to Japan, South Korea, New Zealand and
Australia, Chen said, adding that Taiwan grown high-quality rice
also recently returned to the Japanese market after a hiatus of
33 years.
</P>
<P>
Export values of Taiwan's mangoes and bananas grew by 16 percent
and 49 percent in 2006 over their respective figures for 2003, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Now under the capable leadership of Council of Agriculture (COA)
Chairman Su Jia-chyuan, Chen said, the government has set a
target of pursuing a20 percent increase in farm exports in the
coming three years so as to improve the international image of
the country's agricultural produce and help improve the
livelihoods of local farmers.
</P>
<P>
But the president called public attention to a serious problem
concerning China's commercial piracy of Taiwan's trademarks and
industry know-how -- a development he said has caused extremely
great losses to Taiwan farmers.
</P>
<P>
In an effort to wipe out agricultural technology flight from
Taiwan to China, the government has imposed stricter limitations
on the exportation of key expertise and sensitive research
results, Chen said.
</P>
<P>
In addition, to help farmers take better advantage of their land,
the government has also eased restrictions on farmland use in the
hope that newly crafted regional development plans will help
create more jobs for youth in rural areas and inject fresh
momentum into local economies, he said.
</P>
<P>
In essence, he went on, increased investment in Taiwan, improved
employment, a narrowed wealth gap and a bridge to the development
imbalance between rural and urban areas are the top four
priorities on the government's agenda.
</P>
<P>
To achieve these aims, the Executive Yuan has instructed relevant
agencies to take concrete measures to take care of the needs of
people living in central and southern regions, middle and low
class people and small companies -- the first step toward serving
social justice and assisting the underprivileged, he said.
