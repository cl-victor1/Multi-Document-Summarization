The Kinmen Kaoliang Liquor Inc. Saturday donated 1,000 bottles of
liquor to Beijing's Liang Yi, winner of the 9th Award of Fervent
Love of Life, to help her raise funds to establish a foundation.
</P>
<P>
The award is given by Taiwan's Chou Ta-kuan Cultural and
Educational Foundation to people who have shown courage in facing
great difficulties in life or who have made great contributions
to society.
</P>
<P>
Liang was given the liquor with her portrait on the label at the
10th Fervent Love for Lives Award ceremony in Kinmen County by
Kinmen County Magistrate Lee Chu-feng, who gave the award medal
to Liang last year and was impressed by Liang's life story.
</P>
<P>
Liang grew up in China's Hunan Province, graduated from the
School of Journalism and Communication in Beijing in 2001 and
became a very popular television program hostess on Chinese TV.
</P>
<P>
Liang's life hit rock bottom after she was diagnosed with
hemangioma cavernosum, which confined her to a wheelchair even
after surgery.
</P>
<P>
With courage and support from her family and friends, Liang was
able to embrace life again and has encouraged other people with
her story, earning her the award last year. She has been given
the nickname "wheelchair phoenix, " symbolizing her
transformation into a new life.
