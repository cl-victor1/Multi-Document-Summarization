<P>
President Chen Shui-bian expressed his support Saturday for an
initiative to set up a world environment organization to
integrate international efforts to deal with environmental
issues.
</P>
<P>
According to Chen, the establishment of such a global environment
authority is essential for the comprehensive resolution of
various worsening problems faced by the environment.
</P>
<P>
"Having gained membership in the World Trade Organization and
seeking to join the World Health Organization, Taiwan is willing
to work together with like- minded people from various countries
to push for the establishment of an environment body, because
free trade, healthy existence, environmental sustainability,
democracy and human rights are our beliefs and unbreakable
universal values," Chen said.
</P>
<P>
The president  made the remarks  during  the International
Conference on Cultural Diversity and Sustainable Development held
in the southern city of Kaohsiung.
</P>
<P>
Chen noted that people migrating to Taiwan from various parts of
the world during different periods have contributed to the
country's cultural diversity.
</P>
<P>
They include the aborigines who first settled the island, the
European and Chinese immigrants who came in the 16th Century, the
Japanese colonialists and the Chinese people who moved here
together with the Kuomintang government between the 19th Century
and the mid-20th Century, as well as foreign workers and foreign
spouses from Southeast Asia who have been arriving since the late
20th Century, Chen pointed out.
</P>
<P>
As it shows the world its diverse cultures, Taiwan has not
forgotten its responsibility as a member of the global community,
he said.
</P>
<P>
Chen said that although Taiwan is not a member of the United
Nations, the country has abided by international regulations and
has made various  efforts to protect its cultural  diversity  and
environmental sustainability.
</P>
<P>
For example, the Cabinet has set up the National Council for
Sustainable Development to conduct related research and
international cooperation, and the government has also formed a
panel to respond to climate change and comply with the Kyoto
Protocol aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions, despite not
being a signatory to the protocol, he said.
