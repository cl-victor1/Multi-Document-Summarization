TAIWAN PROTESTS DOWNGRADED OIE MEMBERSHIP
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taipei, May 25 (CNA) 05/26/07  11:12:45 (By Sofia Wu)
</P>
<P>
Taiwan has lodged a strong protest against a resolution by the
World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) that downgrades it to
the level of a "non- sovereign regional member, " Vice Foreign
Affairs Minister Chang Siao-yue said Friday.
</P>
<P>
"The seven-member Taiwan delegation to the OIE annual conference
issued a formal protest immediately after the OIE passed the
unjustifiable resolution on the final day of its current session,
" Chang told an evening news conference.
</P>
<P>
The resolution reads that the OIE notes China's view that the
People's Republic of China is China's only legitimate government
of the "whole" of China, which it describes as including Taiwan,
and that Taiwan can only take part in the OIE as a "non-sovereign
regional member" under the appellation of "Chinese Taipei."
</P>
<P>
Noting that the "one China" notion adopted in the resolution is
far from truth, Chang said the resolution does not change the
reality that the two sides of the Taiwan Strait have been ruled
separately for more than five decades and that the Republic of
China on Taiwan is an independent sovereign country.
</P>
<P>
"We'll never accept the OIE's downgrading of Taiwan's sovereign
status, " Chang said. Nevertheless, she said, Taiwan will
continue to take part in OIE activities as a full member while
reluctantly accepting its new moniker "Chinese Taipei."
</P>
<P>
The resolution was passed with a vote of 113-12, with five
abstentions, Chang said, adding that while the United States gave
a thumbs-up to the resolution, Japan abstained.
</P>
<P>
Stressing that the OIE charter doesn't contain any notion or
stipulation regarding the so-called "non-sovereign regional
member, " Chang said the newly passed resolution cannot be
legally justified.
</P>
<P>
She also expressed deep regret over the OIE's failure to uphold
its professional stance  in submitting  to China's  political
maneuvering.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on the same occasion, Lin Yung-lo, director of the
Ministry of Foreign Affairs' Department of International
Organizations, said that despite the resolution, Taiwan's OIE
membership rights will not be affected.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan joined the OIE in 1954 under the name of "Republic of
China (Taiwan), " but was forced to change the name to "Taipei
China" after Beijing was admitted to the organization in 1992.
</P>
<P>
However, China remains dissatisfied with the alteration. In an
attempt to push the OIE to make further concession to change
Taiwan's membership name, China has refused not only to
participate in OIE activities, but also to pay its membership
fees.
</P>
<P>
To try to resolve the problem, the OIE International Committee
passed a resolution in 2003 to change Taiwan's membership name
from "Taipei China" into "Separate Quarantine Territory of
Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen and Matsu. "
</P>
<P>
At that time, Taiwan made clear that it would accept the new name
but China refused to accept the resolution and did not take part
in the final vote on the issue.
</P>
<P>
With animal epidemics drawing increasing concern, the OIE tried
again this year to resolve the issue and finally passed the
resolution Friday.
</P>
<P>
After the passage of the resolution, the OIE issued a statement
saying that China will restore its participation  in the OIE
activities after a 15-year row over the participation of Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
The statement further said Taiwan will remain a member but under
the appellation of "Chinese Taipei."
</P>
<P>
"This is a historic vote for our organization, " OIE Director
General Bernard Vallat said. "Nowadays, an effective control of
animal diseases,  including zoonosis,  requires more and more
transparent information and cooperation from member countries, "
he said.
</P>
<P>
"The international community cannot afford to have gaps in the
management of sanitary information and counting both Taiwan and
China among our active members will further improve the animal
disease situation in the world," he said.
</P>
<P>
From 1992 and until today's vote, Taiwan was officially known as
"Taipei China" in the OIE. Beijing had lobbied for the moniker of
"Taiwan, China, " a name that Taipei rejected, arguing it implied
Taiwan was subordinate to the People's Republic.
</P>
<P>
"With today's vote, the OIE becomes one of the first and few
international organizations whose members have facilitated and
reached an agreement to have both China and Chinese Taipei as
active members," the OIE said in its news release.
