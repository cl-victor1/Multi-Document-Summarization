RESOLVING CROSS-STRAIT ISSUE ONLY WHEN `VALUES CLOSE': MAC

Taipei,  May 26 (CNA) 05/26/07  20:02:56 (By Lilian Wu)

<P>
Not until the core values on both sides of the Taiwan Strait have
gradually become identical can cross-strait differences be
resolved peacefully and rationally, an official in charge of
China policy said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Tung Chen-yuan, vice chairman of the Mainland Affairs Council,
made the remarks at a youth elite forum sponsored by the National
Taiwan Normal University.
</P>
<P>
According to Tung, Taiwan's democracy experience can prod China
to move toward democracy, saying that the more open and more
democratic China becomes, the brighter the prospect for peace in
the Taiwan Strait and the international community.
</P>
<P>
He noted that China has gradually moved toward a market economy
over the past three decades and that the international community
is optimistic, believing that economic development will bring
changes politically.
</P>
<P>
But  he  said  the  "socialist  democracy  with  Chinese
characteristics" touted by China is distinctly different from the
democracy practiced in Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
China is opposed to competitive elections, multi-party politics
and press freedom, which he said is the greatest difference
between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait.
</P>
<P>
China has even used such slogans as "socialist democracy with
Chinese characteristics"  and "harmonious  society" to suppress
freedom, democracy and human rights, he added.
</P>
<P>
He noted that in Taiwan's first peaceful transfer of power
between two parties in 2000, a correspondent of the Washington
Post wrote that Taiwan's presidential election has opened the
eyes of Chinese people.
</P>
<P>
Chinese people will say that if the opposition Kuomintang, which
can turn over power peacefully after ruling the island for more
than five decades, the Communist Party of China can do the same,
he added.
