<P>
Although former Premier Su Tseng-chang plans to travel overseas,
he has yet to decide on the time or a destination, an aide to Su
said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The aide was responding to news reports that Su, who stepped down
from the premiership May 21, is planning to visit the United
States and Japan at the end of June in a bid to broaden his
horizons and express his appreciation for his supporters in those
countries.
</P>
<P>
The aide noted that although Su said in his resignation statement
that he is planning to have more contact with the grassroots,
travel at home and overseas to listen to their views, he has no
plans to travel overseas in June because his mother is in
hospital.
</P>
<P>
Su offered to resign shortly after he suffered a surprise loss in
the May 6 presidential primary to former Premier Frank Hsieh. Su
served as premier for less than 16 months.
