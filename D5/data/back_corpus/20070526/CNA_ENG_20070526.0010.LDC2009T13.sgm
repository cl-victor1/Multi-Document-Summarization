U.S. WARNS OF POSSIBLE RISE IN CROSS-STRAIT TENSION

Washington,  May 25 (CNA) 05/26/07  13:31:17 (By Jorge Liu,

Tension across the Taiwan Strait could escalate as Taiwan
prepares for its next presidential election slated for March
2008, according to an annual report released Friday by the U.S.
Department of Defense.
</P>
<P>
In the report on China's military power, the Pentagon notes that
the overall situation remained stable in the Taiwan Strait in
2006 and that Beijing "reacted responsibly" to President Chen
Shui-bian's decision to suspend the National Unification Council
and National Unification Guideline early that year.
</P>
<P>
"Beijing appears prepared to defer unification as long as it
believes trends are advancing toward that goal and that the costs
of conflict outweigh the benefits," the report says.
</P>
<P>
Beijing's focus in the near term is likely to prevent Taiwan from
moving toward de jure independence while continuing to hold out
terms for peaceful resolution, with a strategy of "persuasion and
coercion" that integrates political, economic, cultural, legal,
diplomatic and military instruments of power, the report
continues.
</P>
<P>
It says China's ongoing deployment of short-range ballistic
missiles,  enhanced amphibious warfare capabilities and modern,
long-range anti-air systems are reminders of Beijing's refusal to
renounce the use of force, as the balance of forces continues to
shift in China's favor.
</P>
<P>
By October 2006, China had deployed approximately 900 mobile
CSS-6 and CSS-7 short-range ballistic missiles to garrisons
opposite Taiwan, expanding at a rate of more than 100 missiles
per year, the report says.
</P>
<P>
China is deterred from taking military action against Taiwan
mainly because it does not yet possess the military capability to
accomplish with confidence its political objectives on Taiwan,
particularly when confronted with the prospect of U.S.
intervention, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
Other considerations of Beijing also include the potential
political and economic repercussions of military conflict with
Taiwan, such as international sanctions and possible loss of the
right to host the 2008 Olympic Games, the report goes on.
</P>
<P>
"Finally, China's leaders recognize that a conflict over Taiwan
involving the United States would give rise to a long-term
hostile relationship between the two nations -- a result that
would not be in China's interests," it says.
</P>
<P>
Although the principal focus of China's military modernization in
the near term appears to be preparing for potential conflict in
the Taiwan Strait, official documents and the writings of Chinese
military strategists suggest that Beijing is increasingly
surveying the strategic landscape beyond Taiwan, the report says.
</P>
<P>
"Current trends in China's military capabilities are a major
factor in changing East Asian military balances and could provide
China with a force capable of prosecuting a range of military
operations in Asia -- well beyond Taiwan," it concludes.
