Washington, March 23 (CNA) 03/25/07  18:37:51 (By Chiehyu Lin and

A Taiwan's deputy representative to the United States has
recently urged the U.S. media to support Taiwan's bid to join the
United Nations and the World Health Organization (WHO).
</P>
<P>
Deputy Representative Stanley Kao of the Taipei Economic and
Cultural Representative Office in Washington made the appeal
during his address to the National Newspaper Association's 46th
annual conference held in the U.S. capital.
</P>
<P>
Kao thanked the U.S. press for supporting Taiwan's democracy and
freedom and called on them to further support the signing of a
free trade agreement between the U.S. and Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Kao mentioned that despite the lack of official diplomatic ties,
the U.S. and Taiwan have a close and diverse relationship in
trade, technology, culture, and among other fields.
</P>
<P>
Kao stressed that Taiwan is willing to take part in international
organizations and makes more commitments to human rights and
humanitarian relief.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan has created an economic miracle and a political one since
1980, and now is able to contribute to the international
community, he added.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the U.S. support plays an important role in Taiwan's
raising its international profile, Kao pointed out that the
people of Taiwan needs further assistance from the U.S. to become
a member of the UN and the WHO.
</P>
<P>
The association originally invited outgoing representative to the
U.S. David Lee, who failed to attend the event this year because
he needed to attend another meeting in Texas.
</P>
<P>
Lee delivered a speech at the annual conference last year and
received an enthusiastic response. U.S. President George W. Bush
was also present at the event last year.
</P>
<P>
The National Newspaper Association is the oldest newspaper
organization in the U.S., with over 3,000 members who are
newspaper publishers, executives, editors, and reporters.
