Sydney,   Australia,   March   25  (CNA) 03/25/07  16:57:43 (By

The skipper  of the Kaohsiung-based fishing boat Shuen Man No.
168, which has been detained in Brisbane since March 22 over
suspected  poaching, reportedly said Sunday that the vessel
unwittingly trespassed into Australia's economic zone.
</P>
<P>
In a telephone conversation with a Ministry of Foreign Affairs
(MOFA) official based in Brisbane, Hsu Yun-liang, skipper of the
35-meter Shuen Man, said it was a complete surprise learn that
his ship had been operating in the Australian economic zone as he
had judged, according to his chart, that the boat was in open
seas.
</P>
<P>
According to Liao Lieh-ming, a department chief with Taiwan's
representative office in Brisbane, who talked to Hsu by telephone
Sunday morning, the skipper of the Shuen Man denied that his ship
was intentionally poaching in Australia's territorial waters.
</P>
<P>
"It was an accidental incident, " Liao quoted Hsu as saying,
adding that none of the 15 crew members aboard the Shuen Man No.
168 has sustained any injuries.
</P>
<P>
Liao said the crew members will be flown to a detention center in
Darwin after they finish health checks and it is uncertain how
long they -- including another Taiwanese officer, nine
Indonesians and four Chinese -- will be sitting in the Darwin
detention center as investigations and other related legal
procedures proceed.
</P>
<P>
Liao said the Foreign Ministry has gotten into contact with the
crew and told them that it will offer them all necessary
assistance.
</P>
<P>
According to foreign wire service reports, Australian customs
authorities intercepted the Shuen Man, suspected of illegal
fishing, near the country's eastern coast Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The vessel was boarded by Australian customs officials about 258
nautical miles north of Lord Howe Island and 65 nautical miles
inside Australia's exclusive economic zone, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
The vessel was escorted to Brisbane where crew members were
preparing to be transferred to an immigration facility pending
questioning, while Australian customs officers inspected the ship
to determine whether it had engaged in illegal fishing
operations, according to the wire service reports.
