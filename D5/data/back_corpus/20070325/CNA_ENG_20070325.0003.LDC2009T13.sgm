The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) said Saturday  it will
offer all necessary  assistance  to a Kaohsiung-based fishing
boat which has been detained in Australia since March 22 over
suspected poaching.
</P>
<P>
MOFA spokesman Wang Chien-yeh said the ministry has instructed
Taiwan's representative office in Brisbane to look into the case.
</P>
<P>
"Our staff members stationed in Brisbane will first determine
whether any of the 15 crew members aboard the Shuen Man No. 168
was injured, " Wang said, adding that if none of them have
sustained any injuries, the MOFA personnel will seek to
understand which legal infractions have led to the ship's
detention.
</P>
<P>
At any rate, Wang said, the MOFA will help with the case to
secure an early release of the boat and its crew.

According to foreign wire service reports, Australian customs
authorities intercepted the Taiwan-flagged  vessel suspected of
illegal fishing near the country's eastern coast Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The 35-meter Shuen Man was boarded by Australian  customs
officials about 258 nautical miles north of Lord Howe Island and
65 nautical miles inside Australia's exclusive economic zone, the
reports said.
</P>
<P>
The vessel had 15 crew members on board,  including nine
Indonesians, four Chinese and two Taiwanese.
</P>
<P>
The vessel was escorted to Brisbane where crew members were
transferred to an immigration facility pending questioning, while
customs officers inspected the ship to determine whether it had
engaged in illegal fishing operations, according to the wire
service reports.
