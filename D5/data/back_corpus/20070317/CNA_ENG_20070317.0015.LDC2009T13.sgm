Taipei,  March 17 (CNA) 03/17/07  17:01:08 (By Elizabeth Hsu)

Three ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) legislators have
urged the legislature to pass three draft bills concerning
Taiwan's greenhouse gas emissions as soon as possible and have
called for the formation of an emissions trading system.
</P>
<P>
Legislators Wang Tu-fa, Lee Chun-yi and Chen Ming-chen issued the
call at a press conference at the Legislative Yuan Friday after
giving a report on their recent trip to Britain to study that
country's efforts in dealing with issues concerning climate
change and recycled energy sources.
</P>
<P>
Wang said Britain has reached the target regulated in the Kyoto
Protocol for the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, becoming
one of few countries in the world to achieve the goal.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, the British government set a long-term goal March 13
for further emissions reduction, planning to cut 60 percent of
its current emissions by 2050, Wang said, noting that the
government has also planned to develop London into a global
emissions trading center.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan needs to accelerate its legislation of draft bills on the
development of recycled energy sources,  energy taxation,  and
reduction of greenhouse gas emissions while making efforts to
build an emissions trading system in order to bring Taiwan into
line with the world's fast development in emissions trading, Wang
suggested.
