<P>
A campaign office of former main opposition Kuomintang (KMT)
Chairman Ma Ying- jeou will open Sunday in downtown Taipei to
prepare for Ma's 2008 presidential bid.
</P>
<P>
Ma will give a keynote speech at the opening and Taipei Mayor Hau
Lung-bin, who took over the mayoral post last December from Ma,
is slated to salute Ma.
</P>
<P>
Former KMT Secretary-General Chan Chuen-po will serve as Ma's
campaign manager.
</P>
<P>
Ma quit the KMT's top post in mid-February after being indicted
on corruption charges over allegedly embezzling from a special
municipal monthly allowance for his discretionary use from
1998-2006. Ma, who enjoys strong public support, announced his
desire to take part in the 2008 presidential race shortly after
the indictment.
