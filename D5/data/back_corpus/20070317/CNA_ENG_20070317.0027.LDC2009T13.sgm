Most small seine-netters fishing for mackerel off the shore of
the northeastern county of Yilan decided Saturday to cease
operations for three days after the mackerel price experienced a
plunge over the past three days due to big harvests.

<P>
It is the season for mackerel to spawn in the seas off Yilan and
in the past three days, the daily mackerel load at the Nanfangau
fishing port in Yilan has surpassed 2,000 tons, said members of a
local fishermen's association, who were not happy but anguished
over a resultant plunge in mackerel prices, which they said has
dropped from more than NT$20 to less than NT$6 per kilogram
during the short period.

<P>
The mackerel hauls mark a new high record in recent years but the
prices are the lowest, the fishermen complained.
