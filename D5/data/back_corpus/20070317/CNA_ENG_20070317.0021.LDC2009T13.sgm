South Korea will send police officers to Taiwan to work with
Taiwan's Criminal Investigation Bureau (CIB) in the fight against
cross-border fraud, a CIB officer said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
According to the officer, South Korea pays great attention to
fighting cross- border fraud, as more and more South Korean
people have become victims.
</P>
<P>
Two Taiwanese fraudsters who flew to South Korea in January to
teach fraud skills to criminals there were arrested March 15 by
the CIB when they returned via Taiwan's Taoyuan International
Airport.
</P>
<P>
The two arrested men worked for Chinese fraud rings as "drivers"
-- which mean they would withdraw money using the identities of
victims whose personal information had been stolen by fraud
rings.
</P>
<P>
According to the officer, Taiwan's police have made achievements
in anti-fraud work, so that cross-border fraud rings have moved
their targets to South Korea, Thailand and Malaysia, sending
Taiwanese "drivers" to these countries to teach fraud skills.
</P>
<P>
South Korean police have arrested dozens of Taiwanese "drivers"
since the beginning of this year, the officer said, adding that
the two countries will work together on measures and policies in
fighting fraud.
