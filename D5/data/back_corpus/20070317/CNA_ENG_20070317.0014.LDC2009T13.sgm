NEW CONSTITUTION AIMED AT CEMENTING TAIWAN'S DEMOCRACY: PRESIDENT
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  March 17 (CNA) 03/17/07  15:20:21 (By Flor Wang)

President Chen Shui-bian said Saturday that his desire to write a
new constitution for Taiwan is not aimed at serving any
particular political party but is rather to solidify Taiwan's
democracy.
</P>
<P>
Chen made the comments while giving a speech at the opening of an
international seminar on constitutional re-engineering.
</P>
<P>
Claiming that his promotion of a timely and tailor-made new
constitution for the country is not an attempt to move toward de-
jure Taiwan independence as China has alleged, Chen said that it
is vital for all emerging nations to step up their
democratization and that constitutional reforms are needed to
recognize the Taiwan people's democratization achievements over
the past 30 years.
</P>
<P>
According  to Chen,  fierce political fighting between the
opposition and ruling parties since the power transfer in 2000
has led to a crippled government, which is the biggest challenge
facing the country at the present.
</P>
<P>
Although Chen admitted that constitutional reforms have a high
legal threshold, he said carrying out the reforms would not be
difficult compared to past unfairness and limitations, such as
martial law and bans on media and the establishment of new
political parties imposed on the Taiwan people during the past
authoritarian era.
</P>
<P>
The president called for public confidence and vowed to lead the
people and stand by the people and on the right side of history,
to see the creation of a new constitution.
