<P>
A south-bound bullet train was delayed by 13 minutes Wednesday
due to a switch machine problem, Taiwan High Speed Rail (THSR)
officials reported.
</P>
<P>
The train, which departed from Banciao, in northern Taipei County
for Zuoying, in southern Kaohsiung City, came to a temporary halt
at around 10: 30 a.m. after passing Yunlin Station due to a
failure in a switch machine, the THSR officials said, adding that
the train resumed its journey after switching to another rail. It
arrived at Zuoying Station 13 minutes late.
</P>
<P>
The THSR railway operators denied that they had backed the train
up to make a correction in the wake of the switch machine
failure.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan's first high-speed railway has been operating normally
over the past several weeks after a spate of glitches during the
first few days of operations in January.
</P>
<P>
The 345-km railway linking Taipei and Kaohsiung has reduced rail
travel time between Taiwan's two largest cities to 90 minutes
from the previous four- and-a-half hours.
