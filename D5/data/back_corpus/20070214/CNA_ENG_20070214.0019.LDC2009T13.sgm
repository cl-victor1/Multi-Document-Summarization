Valentine's Day may not have been the most romantic time for most
of Taiwan's offices workers this year, with a recent survey
showing that a vast majority of these workers suffer from a sense
of loneliness.

The "loneliness index" survey, conducted by the Chinese-language
monthly job- tracking magazine Career between Jan. 17-26, found
that 88.9 percent of office workers in Taiwan suffer from a sense
of loneliness.

As to the reasons for their feelings of loneliness, "unchanging
routine in life" was mentioned most often, by 44.5 percent of
respondents, followed by "not having a boyfriend/girlfriend" by
38.3 percent of respondents, and "a lack of sense of achievement
at work" by 37.4 percent.

A total of 49 percent of the office workers surveyed said they
are still single, with 61.4 percent of these respondents noting
that Valentine's Day makes them feel especially lonely, and 78.6
percent mentioning that they want to give up the single's life.

As to the kind of relationship they aspire to have, 58 percent of
the single respondents said they want a "loving relationship in
which each partner has their own personal space, " perhaps
indicating that many young workers in Taiwan have become
accustomed to a carefree lifestyle.

On ways to get rid of feelings of loneliness, "watching TV or
seeing a movie" was mentioned most often, by 59.3 percent of the
respondents, followed by "visiting an online chatroom" by 50.3

"reading a book" by 39.1 percent, and "going shopping" by 32.6
