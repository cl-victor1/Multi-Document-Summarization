STATE-OWNED ENTERPRISES RENAMED 'TO BE HONEST TO HISTORY':
PREMIER
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  Feb. 14 (CNA) 02/14/07  15:36:30 (By Y.F. Low)

Premier Su Tseng-chang said Wednesday that the government's
recent move of changing the names of three state-owned
enterprises shows that it is facing history and the country
honestly.
</P>
<P>
Revealing that preparatory work for the name changes had been
going on for six months before being finalized Feb. 9, Su
expressed satisfaction that the information was not leaked
beforehand, which he said helped avoid "unnecessary troubles"
that could have hampered the process.
</P>
<P>
Su made the remarks during a weekly Cabinet meeting, when the
Cabinet approved draft amendments to the Postal Service Act and
to a statute on the establishment of the Chunghwa Post Co. The
amendments became necessary after the company was renamed "Taiwan
Post Co."
</P>
<P>
According to Su, the name "Taiwan Post" appeared as early as 1888
when postal service was inaugurated in Taiwan during the Ching
Dynasty, and changing the name of Chunghwa Post Co. to "Taiwan
Post Co." is only "a return to truth so that the familiar name --
Taiwan -- can be spoken."
</P>
<P>
As to Chinese Petroleum Corp. (CPC), Su pointed out that company
was established in 1946 in Shanghai and moved to Taiwan three
years later.
</P>
<P>
"With CPC having lived together with the people of Taiwan for the
last 50 years, renaming the company 'CPC Corp., Taiwan' has more
clearly reflected its history," Su said.
</P>
<P>
Su said that the government has dealt with the name-change issue
in a mild, brave, honest and sincere manner and that it respects
the opposing opinions expressed by some people on the matter.
</P>
<P>
Su stressed that the name changes will not undermine the rights
and interests of the workers and clients of the affected
companies but will enhance the companies' competitiveness and
prominence, because they will no longer be confused with
companies carrying similar names in China, such as China National
Petroleum Corp. and China Petrochemical Corp.
</P>
<P>
Also undergoing a renaming on Feb. 9 was China Shipbuilding
Corp., which decided to change its name to "CSBC Corp., Taiwan."
