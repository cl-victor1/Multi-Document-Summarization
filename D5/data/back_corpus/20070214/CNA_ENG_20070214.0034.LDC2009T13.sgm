VP CLAIMS NO MISUSE IN HER SPECIAL ALLOWANCE FUND
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  Feb.  14 (CNA) 02/14/07  19:09:56 (By Lilian Wu)

Vice President Annette Lu said Wednesday that she "has faith" in
her use of special allowance fund amid reports that prosecutors
will soon investigate alleged fund misuse involving many high-
ranking officials, including Lu.
</P>
<P>
Lu claimed to have "no idea whatsoever" on how to handle the fund
and said she simply follows the instructions of her staff.
</P>
<P>
"An executive will not dwell on trivialities," she claimed,
adding that she "has confidence in the use of the public fund."
</P>
<P>
Lu's remarks came one day after prosecutors indicted former
opposition Kuomintang Chairman Ma Ying-jeou on corruption
charges, accusing him of embezzling NT$11.17 million (US$338,500)
from his special allowance fund during his tenure as two-term
Taipei mayor that ended December 2006. Ma has maintained his
innocence.
</P>
<P>
According to Lu, when prosecutors indicted the first lady on
corruption charges over the alleged misuse of the state affairs
fund at the discretionary use of President Chen Shui-bian, the
public reactions were in stark contrast with Ma's.
</P>
<P>
"Society has a serious double standard and this is the biggest
crisis of the nation," she claimed.
</P>
<P>
According to Lu, Ma's case is largely similar to the president's
'state affairs fund" case.
</P>
<P>
If Ma is what Lu considered to be wronged by the prosecution, it
is likely that the first lady and others involved in the state
affairs fund case have also been wronged.
</P>
<P>
While the state affairs fund case caused an uproar from the
opposition camp, Lu said, it seems that many on this occasion are
taking a more lenient attitude toward Ma.
</P>
<P>
"We should calm down and reflect on whether there is an
institutional defect in the system," she said, adding that if
necessary, actions should be taken to amend any deficiencies in
the system.
</P>
<P>
First lady Wu Shu-jen is accused of corruption in that she
collected invoices from others to claim NT$14.8 million from the
state affairs fund use between July 2002 and March 2006.
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors allege that Ma remitted half of his special allowance
fund, or NT$17 million per month into his account, knowing that
it should be used for public affairs but failing to return the
unspent money to the national coffers. Although Ma claims to have
donated over NT$68 million over the years,  he did not convince
the prosecutors that the donations came from the special
allowance fund.
</P>
<P>
The nation's 6,500 high-ranking officials who are also entitled
to special allowances, including Lu, the heads of the five
branches of the government, city and county chiefs as well as
school principles, are allowed to claim reimbursement from the
fund in cash or check form or by direct bank account remittance.
</P>
<P>
Those who remit the funds into their bank accounts are the
easiest to track down compared with those who deal in cash or
checks. There have also been conflicting interpretations about
whether the fund should be used for public affairs or simply
given as a subsidy to the executives.
