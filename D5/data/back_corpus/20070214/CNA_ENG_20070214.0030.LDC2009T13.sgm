BEIJING DECLINES TO COMMENT ON FORMER TAIPEI MAYOR'S INDICTMENT
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Beijing, Feb.  14 (CNA) 02/14/07  18:09:20 (By Chen Yen-chun and
Han Nai-kuo)
</P>
<P>
China's Taiwan Affairs Office declined to comment Wednesday on
former Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou's indictment on charges of
embezzling from a mayoral special allowance fund betweem 1998 and
2006, saying only that its officials have noted the development.
</P>
<P>
Hours after the indictment Tuesday, Ma resigned from his post as
chairman of Taiwan's main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) and
declared his intention to run for president in the 2008 election.
</P>
<P>
Li Weiyi, spokesman for China's Taiwan Affairs Office, was asked
whether Chinese President Hu Jintao, who sent a congratulatory
message to Ma when he was elected KMT chairman in 2005, contacted
the KMT about Ma's indictment, and what the Chinese leadership
would think if KMT honorary Chairman Lien Chan were to be made
acting chairman.
</P>
<P>
Li said that because none of the media speculation actually
occurred, and because the KMT had not made a decision yet, the
Beijing government had no comment.
</P>
<P>
Asked about speculation that Beijing might change its strategy
toward Taiwan by no longer pinning its hopes on the KMT and
beginning to develop a relationship with the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP), Li said Beijing welcomes DPP members to
visit China to increase mutual understanding as long as they
acknowledge Beijing's one-China principle and the so-called 1992
Consensus.
</P>
<P>
The 1992 Consensus refers to an understanding the KMT claims was
reached in Hong Kong between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait
that there is only one China, but with both sides free to make
their own interpretations of what "one China" actually means.
</P>
<P>
Li urged the DPP to remove its party plank seeking Taiwan
independence in order to open the gate to exchanges with China.
</P>
<P>
He said Beijing welcomes rank-and-file DPP members wishing to
visit China because they are different from the "handful of
diehards who champion Taiwan independence."
