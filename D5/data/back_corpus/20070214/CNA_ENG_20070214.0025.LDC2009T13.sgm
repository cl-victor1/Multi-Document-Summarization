Ruling Democratic Progressive Party Legislator Chen Chin-teh
urged Taiwan's fishing industry Wednesday to refrain from
engaging in non-sustainable fishing.
</P>
<P>
Chen also called on government agencies to ban or strictly
regulate driftnet fishing or bottom-dragging net fishing in
Taiwan's fishing grounds.
</P>
<P>
He made the call after inviting officials from the Fisheries
Administration under the Council of Agriculture, the Coast Guard
Administration and fishermen's associations from eastern Yilan
County on a field trip off the east coast.
</P>
<P>
During their field trip, Chen and the officials witnessed the
rooting out of coral reefs and other living marine resources from
the seabed by fishing boats using driftnets or bottom-dragging
nets.
</P>
<P>
Claiming to be "horrified" by what they saw, the Fisheries
Administration officials promised to step up efforts to demand
that fishing boats to immediately abandon driftnetting.
</P>
<P>
Noting that banning driftnetting and bottom-dragging net fishing
has for long been a world trend as these practices seriously
deplete coral reefs and other marine resources,  Chen called for
the government to discourage and restrict the use of
indiscriminate fishing methods in Taiwan's economic zones to
ensure the conservation of living marine resources.
