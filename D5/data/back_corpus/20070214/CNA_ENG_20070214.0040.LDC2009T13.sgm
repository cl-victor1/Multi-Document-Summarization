An airplane from the Shanghai-based China Eastern Airlines
brought 297 Taiwanese passengers back home from Shanghai
Wednesday to celebrate the Lunar New Year festival -- also called
the Spring Festival -- which starts n New Year's Eve Feb. 17.
</P>
<P>
The passenger plane arrived at Taiwan Taoyuan International
Airport at noon, making it the first Chinese aircraft to land on
the island this year.
</P>
<P>
In the absence of direct air links between Taiwan and China,
China Eastern is one of six Chinese carriers contracted to
provide charter flight service between the two sides during the
Lunar New Year holiday season. Six Taiwanese carriers are also
allowed to join the service.
</P>
<P>
The first chartered flight of the kind,  operated by the Taipei-
based Mandarin Airlines, left the previous day for Shanghai with
more than 200 passengers on board -- mostly tourists and family
members of Taiwan businessmen operating in China.
</P>
<P>
The special direct cross-strait charter service will last through
the end of the festival season in early March.
