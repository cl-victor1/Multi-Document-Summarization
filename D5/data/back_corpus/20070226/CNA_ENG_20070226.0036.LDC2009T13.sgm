GOV'T URGED TO DEAL WITH FALLING BIRTH RATE
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  Feb. 26 (CNA) 02/26/07  23:39:37 (By T.C. Jiang)
</P>
<P>
The government should take measures early on to deal with likely
impacts of the dropping birth rate, according to a report
released by the Taiwan Institute of Economic Research (TIER), a
local think thank.
</P>
<P>
The TIER report also called on the public to accept cohabitation
and children born out of wedlock, which it claimed could help
solve the issue.
</P>
<P>
According to the statistics released by the Directorate General
of Budget, Accounting and Statistics (DGBAS), the average
fertility of women in Taiwan in 2005 was 1.1 babies per woman,
the report noted.
</P>
<P>
The figure was lower than the world average total fertility rate
-- 2.7 babies per woman -- and the 1.6 babies average of advanced
countries, the report said, adding that the figure was only
higher than the current 1.0 babies per woman in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Following this trend, the Council for Economic Planning and
Development (CEPD) estimated that in 2017, the population of
people aged 65-year-old  and above will surpass that of people
aged 14-year-old and under.
</P>
<P>
A reduction in the number of children could cut teaching jobs at
primary and middle schools, and might decrease the demand for
medical services for women and children, the TIER added in the
report.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the falling birth rate could cut the labor force,
which will be detrimental to Taiwan's economic growth, the report
said, adding that raising labor productivity is thus becoming an
important task.
</P>
<P>
However, it is impossible to lift the labor productivity to a
level capable of solving all the negative influences resulted
from the declining birth rate, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
For instance, by 2035, the Germany government will need to raise
labor productivity by 15 percent in order to cope with the
shrinking, economically active population, the report said. Yet,
it will be possible to increase it by only six percent at most,
the institute noted.
</P>
<P>
Citing Japan as a further example, the report said that the
measures proposed by the Taiwan government, such as providing
subsidies, or maternity leave, might not generate satisfactory
results, as they failed in Japan in the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
However, the report noted that western or northern European
countries are successful in dealing with the slumping birth rate
by adopting different family values.
</P>
<P>
In these countries, women enjoy a high status, and children are
independent at early ages, the report said, adding that
cohabitation and illegitimate children are more socially
accepted.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, unless people in Taiwan change their
family values it will be difficult to boost the fertility of
women.
</P>
<P>
However, the think tank admitted that changing family values is
not likely to happen in the foreseeable future. As a result, the
government should help those who are willing to have a baby
strike a balance between work and family, the report urged.
