Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport, Taiwan's main gateway,
reported a record high number of nearly 90,000 passengers Sunday
-- the last day of the Lunar New Year holiday, airport customs
officials said Monday.
</P>
<P>
The figure surpassed the number of travelers reported on the eve
of Chinese New Year, which fell on Feb. 17 this year, the
officials noted, adding that more than 83,000 visitors entered
and left Taiwan on that day.
</P>
<P>
The new record was twice the average number of passengers each
day at the airport, the officials pointed out.
</P>
<P>
The officials attributed  the high rise in the number of
passengers to the fact that many Taiwanese people returned home
Sunday from trips abroad, while many overseas Chinese visitors
left.
