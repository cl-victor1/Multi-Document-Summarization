PRESIDENT'S COMMENTS ON 2008 TICKET AIMED AT BOOSTING DPP
COHESION

Taipei,  Feb.  26 (CNA) 02/26/07  17:20:08 (By Lillian Wu)

President Chen Shui-bian was aiming to strengthen the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party's (DPP's) cohesion when he expressed
hope that the presidential aspirants who finish first and second
in the party primary can form a ticket for the 2008 presidential
election, sources at the Presidential Office said Monday.
</P>
<P>
The primary will consist of two parts, with a DPP member vote
accounting for 30 percent of individual candidate's total score
and public opinion polls accounting for 70 percent.
</P>
<P>
The sources were responding to reports by the Liberty Times, a
major local newspaper, that the president said a day earlier that
he hopes coordination he initiated among the presidential
hopefuls will move in line with the opinion poll results, with
the two aspirants who place first and second forming a ticket for
the presidential election.
</P>
<P>
Chen reportedly said he will start to listen to views from the
presidential hopefuls and the party after registration for the
primary starts March 5 to bring about a coordination mechanism
that can be accepted by all. He was also reported to have noted
that some had suggested that opinion polls should decide the
rankings and that the member vote should be scrapped to avoid
division.
</P>
<P>
Former Premier Frank Hsieh, DPP Chairman Yu Shyi-kun and Premier
Su Tseng-chang have each announced their intentions to join the
race to represent the DPP in the election. Vice President Annette
Lu is the only DPP heavyweight yet to announce her intentions.
</P>
<P>
But the president will also respect whatever decision the two
hopefuls who finish first and second in the primary make on
forming a ticket, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
Chen said the party has to unify in the March 2008 presidential
election and that the Taipei and Kaohsiung mayoral elections in
December 2006 clearly demonstrated that all the factions in the
DPP must unite in order to be victorious, according to the
reports by the Liberty Times.
</P>
<P>
The DPP retained its hold on the Kaohsiung mayorship by a slim
margin, despite the fact that a series of scandals surrounding
the president's close aides and family members in 2006 seriously
dented the party's approval ratings. Although the DPP lost the
Taipei mayoral election, it was able to expand its support base
in Taiwan's capital, traditionally a stronghold of the main
opposition Kuomintang (KMT).
</P>
<P>
"The DPP's most formidable rival is not the KMT nor former KMT
Chairman Ma Ying- jeou, but rather a lack of solidarity within
the DPP itself," the report quoted the president as saying.
