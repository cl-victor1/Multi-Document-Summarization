Two moth orchid hybrids, named Glory of Taiwan Sugar and Red
Pearl, both cultivated by Taiwan Sugar Co., won prizes in the
2007 International Tokyo Orchid Show, a spokesman for the company
said Monday.

The spokesman said the Glory of Taiwan Sugar -- a yellow moth
orchid that won the first prize in the "other colors" category of
the contest -- was supposed to have fewer and smaller flowers,
but the company's horticulture techniques made it bloom
abundantly this season, bringing it a lot of attention at the
show.

<P>
The Red Pearl -- a small red orchid which won the bronze prize --
started being exported to Japan in 2006 and has popular, despite
a market that traditionally favors white moth orchids.

<P>
The company's orchids have won prizes for the second time in
International Tokyo Orchid Show, which is a big event in the
orchid industry, not only proving the company's techniques in
growing orchids but also helping to expand Japan's market for
Taiwan orchids, the spokesman said.
