FLIGHTS

Taipei,  Feb.  26 (CNA) 02/26/07  19:57:54 (By Deborah Kuo)

The Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) will seek during  negotiations
with China wider  applications  for cross-Taiwan  Strait charter
flight services  to allow foreign nationals to also benefit, MAC
Chairman Joseph Wu said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Wu made the remarks following a wish expressed by President Chen
Shui-bian during a Lunar New Year party with China-based Taiwan
businessmen that if negotiations with China over charter flights
and the issue of Chinese citizens coming to Taiwan for tourism
are successful, foreign nationals traveling to Taiwan from China,
Chinese tourists and China-based Taiwanese businessmen should all
be allowed to board direct cross-strait charter flights.
</P>
<P>
Noting that direct cross-strait  charter flights  are only
available to Taiwanese businessmen, their dependents and other
Taiwan citizens, including tourists and students, during the
Lunar New Year holidays, Tomb Sweeping Festival, Dragon Boat
Festival and Mid-Autumn Festival,  Wu said the MAC will continue
to push for wider availability of the charter flight services to
other categories of passengers.
</P>
<P>
The MAC will also seek to allow cargo to be transported across
the strait via direct charter flights, Wu added.
</P>
<P>
He refused to speculate on when the negotiations will be
completed,  saying only that the MAC has been  "active  and
enthusiastic" on the matter and expressing hope that the Chinese
authorities will act in a similar manner.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Minister of Transportation and Communications Tsai
Duei said opening Taiwan to Chinese tourists is a set policy of
the government and an expanded cross-strait charter flight
program would also be welcomed by both the government and the
private sector.
</P>
<P>
Tsai said he had no idea when Chinese tourists will be allowed to
Taiwan or when direct cross-strait charter flight services will
be expanded to weekends, but added that March would be the most
appropriate time for the programs to kick off.
