President Chen Shui-bian urged candidates in the various
elections to be held in 2007 Monday to run "rationally and
responsibly."
</P>
<P>
Chen made the appeal at a Lunar New Year gathering at the
Presidential Office in which Chen and Vice President Annette Lu
extended New Year greetings to their staff.
</P>
<P>
Noting that 2007 will be an "election year," Chen said he hopes
all electoral battles will be gentleman's battles.
</P>
<P>
More importantly, Chen said it is hoped that all participants
will refrain from adopting election campaign ploys designed to
hinder approval of the central government's general budget --
which includes funds for arms purchases -- and other proposed
bills related with people's livelihoods.
</P>
<P>
Chen also said the calligraphy characters "Taiwan" printed on the
red envelopes he handed out symbolize his great affection for the
country and that the government's policy on changing the names of
state-owned companies is only a small step toward making Taiwan a
"normal" country.
