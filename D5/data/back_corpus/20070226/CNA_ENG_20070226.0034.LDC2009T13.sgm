State-owned Taiwan Post Co., formerly known as Chunghwa Post Co.
prior to a recent name change, is slated to publish its first
stamps carrying the word "Taiwan " Wednesday -- the 60th
anniversary of the 228 Incident, Premier Su Tseng-chang said
Monday.

<P>
Su made the remarks during a Cabinet meeting after hearing a
briefing by Taiwan Post Co. officials on their preparations to
launch its first "Taiwan" stamps featuring the 228 Incident
Memorial Hall.
</P>
<P>
Su hailed the Taiwan Post Co.'s efficiency in issuing the stamp
and called for public understanding of the government's sincerity
when it comes to both facing up to history and expressing its
love for the nation.
</P>
<P>
According to Su, the publication of the stamps carrying "Taiwan"
forms a part of the government's effort to acknowledge the
suffering of families of the 228 Incident victims and to
underscore Taiwan's sovereignty as an independent nation.

Thousands  of Taiwan's elite were massacred  by Kuomintang
government troops in the 1947 incident -- two years before the
KMT regime relocated to Taiwan from China.

Taiwan Post Co. was one of the three state-run companies that
decided to change their corporate names recently as part of the
Democratic Progressive Party administration's name rectification
campaign to signify Taiwan's distinct national identity.
