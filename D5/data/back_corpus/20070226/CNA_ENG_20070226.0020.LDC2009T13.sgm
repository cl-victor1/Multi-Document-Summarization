The artificial fiber manufacturing sector generated a production

decrease of 1.7 percent, while the production value of the sector
producing yarns and fabrics reached NT$262.7 billion, also with

The clothing industry generated a production value of NT$43.5

TTRI analysts said Taiwan's general textile industry is suffering
an impact triggered by accelerating changes in the international
industrial environment. Enterprises have to be able to act fast
in response to the changes, they said.
