<P>
Former Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Ma Ying-jeou, who was indicted
on corruption charges earlier this month, vowed Monday to spare
no efforts in trying to win the 2008 presidential race.
</P>
<P>
Ma said he will go all out for the 2008 race while regarding the
country's future as his own responsibility and "not taking
personal honor or humiliation into consideration."
</P>
<P>
Ma made the vow during a KMT gathering of party heavyweights and
delegates to mark the beginning of the new year on the lunar
calendar.
</P>
<P>
He called for all members of the general public to strive
concertedly to help the country rebound from its lowest ebb in
seven years.
</P>
<P>
"The time has come for the opposition to shake off the shackles
of defeat and stand up to turn around the political situation, "
he added.
</P>
<P>
Ma, who resigned from the KMT chairmanship Feb. 13 upon being
charged with allegedly lining his pockets during his time as
Taipei mayor with NT$11 million (US$332,684) from a special
allowance fund set aside for the mayor's discretionary use,
declined to answer a reporter's  question  on whether  he would
continue  with his presidential bid if he were to be found
guilty.
