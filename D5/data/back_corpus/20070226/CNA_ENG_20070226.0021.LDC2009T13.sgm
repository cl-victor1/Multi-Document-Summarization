GOVERNMENT TO DEAL WITH SCRAPPING CHIANG MEMORIAL HALL STEP BY
STEP
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  Feb. 26 (CNA) 02/26/07  19:12:12 (By Lilian Wu)
</P>
<P>
President Chen Shui-bian said Monday that the government will
deal with the issue of scrapping a mausoleum and a memorial hall
for the late President Chiang Kai-shek step by step.
</P>
<P>
The president made the remarks when he attended an international
seminar to mark the 60th anniversary of the 228 Incident, an
uprising against the corrupt Kuomintang administration under
Chiang that began Feb. 28, 1947 and was followed by a bloody
crackdown, resulting in tens of thousands of civilian deaths. The
seminar was sponsored by the 228 Incident Memorial Foundation.
</P>
<P>
Chen noted that Chiang's mausoleum in Tzuhu, Taoyuan County, is a
feudal legacy completely out of tune with a democratic era.
Chiang's embalmed body was temporarily placed there when he died
in 1975 and is now awaiting reburial in a military cemetery in
suburban Taipei.
</P>
<P>
Chen also said that the existence of the Chiang Kai-shek Memorial
Hall, located in downtown Taipei, is also highly controversial,
given the fact that it was built when the line between the KMT
and the nation was thin.
</P>
<P>
When dealing with historic legacies, the government is bound to
encounter steep resistance and opposition, Chen said.
</P>
<P>
"But I'm convinced that justice will be upheld and that the
people will make the right choice so as to let the country emerge
from the shadow of the past and move toward becoming a normal,
complete, beautiful, progressive and great country," he said.
</P>
<P>
Chen said that "228" symbolizes the suffering of the Taiwan
people for over half a century and stands for a total denial of
freedom and democracy by an alien, authoritarian regime.
</P>
<P>
"It was an authoritarian regime's ruthless suppression of basic
human rights and was by no means a rebellion caused by
misgovernment or conflict between the people and the police as
claimed by some," according to Chen.
</P>
<P>
"If it were that simple, there would not have been martial law
that lasted for more than three decades, " he said, referring to
the declaration of martial law in the year following the incident
that was not lifted until 1987.
</P>
<P>
To define the 228 Incident as misgovernment or conflicts between
the police and the people is an attempt to "paper over" the past
authoritarian brutality, Chen said.
</P>
<P>
He said the past administration saw only the sufferers and
victims and never touched on the ones who imposed the suffering
or the perpetrators of the brutal suppression.
</P>
<P>
"Such a passive approach might avoid social conflict for the time
being, but will never uphold justice and true forgiveness and
reconciliation will never be achieved," he said.
</P>
<P>
Chen noted that the 99-piece "Tahsi files" relating to the 228
Incident were exchanges between Chiang and Taiwan Garrison
Commander Chen Yi and other ranking party, government and
military officials.
</P>
<P>
The exchanges were enough to prove that Chiang was deeply
involved in the killings and that "it was an open fact that it
was Chiang's decision to send troops to crack down on the
uprising," Chen said.
</P>
<P>
Peng Meng-chi, then the commander of the Kaohsiung Fortress,
killed around 2,500 people, which won him notoriety as the
"Kaohsiung butcher. " Despite this, Chiang promoted Peng to
Taiwan garrison commander, demonstrating his support and
endorsement.
</P>
<P>
"Chiang was undoubtedly the main culprit behind the 228 Incident
judging from the related historical documents and government
files," Chen said.
</P>
<P>
However, Chiang continues to enjoy special status like a feudal
king and those who imposed suffering during the 228 Incident and
the ensuing martial law rule have escaped persecution, which Chen
said is "intolerable to the victims and family members of the
incident."
</P>
<P>
The president described his name rectification drive of recent
years, including changing the name of the road in front of the
Presidential Office to Ketagalan Boulevard, the Chiang Kai-shek
International Airport to Taiwan Taoyaun International Airport as
well as the dismantling of more than 200 Chiang Kai- shek
statutes in military barracks -- as the "first step toward
addressing history seriously."
