228 FOUNDATION TO 'EXIST FOREVER': PREMIER
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  Feb.  26 (CNA) 02/26/07  15:16:49 (By Deborah Kuo)

Premier Su Tseng-chang announced Monday that the non-profit 228
Incident Memorial Foundation, which was inaugurated in 1995 and
which is slated to become history in 2010, will "exist forever."
</P>
<P>
Su said he will see to it that the foundation -- established by
the Executive Yuan in April 1995 based on the Compensation and
Rehabilitation Act which was signed into law by then President
Lee Teng-hui for the 228 Incident of 1947 to deal with
compensation and rehabilitation matters for the victims of the
incident -- will not become history in 2010 and instead will
remain in operation.
</P>
<P>
Su said that since 2000 when the Democratic Progressive Party
came to power, the government has presented certificates to
families of the 228 Incident victims to clear the victims' names.
</P>
<P>
Over the past six years, Su said, the foundation has not only
provided compensation to the families of the victims of the
incident, it has also consoled  them by holding  memorial
activities, investigating the truth, and paying personal visits
to them.
</P>
<P>
The foundation has compiled a mammoth archive of 16 volumes about
the 228 Incident -- which happened due to the mismanagement of
the then Taiwan provincial government and cost thousands of
people their lives -- so as to provide researchers with accurate
accounts for their studies on that period in history, Su added.
</P>
<P>
The incident severely impeded social harmony and created ethnic
cleavage. After the lifting of martial law in 1987, the
government, realizing the impact the incident had had upon our
society, decided to ameliorate this historic tragedy and to
promote integration of all ethnic groups. In 1990, the Executive
Yuan set up a task force, inviting scholars and experts to study
the incident. The "Report of the February-28 Incident" was then
published in 1992. In 1995. the Feb. 28 Memorial Monument was
established in the Feb. 28 Peace Park in Taipei City, which has
served as a symbol and a cornerstone for a more harmonious
society.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Su said a "228 Peace Fund" will be established soon by
the government in the hopes that NT$1.5 billion will be allocated
over five years to help finance the sustainable operations of the
228 Incident Memorial Foundation.
