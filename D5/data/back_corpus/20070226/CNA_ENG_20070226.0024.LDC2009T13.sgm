Taipei,  Feb. 26 (CNA) 02/26/07  19:45:59 (By Lilian Wu)

Minister of the Interior Lee Yi-yang said Monday that the
ministry has asked for the ignominious descriptions of "mobster"
or "thug" to be deleted from the household registration records
of the victims of the 228 Incident.
</P>
<P>
Lee made the remarks in response to complaints by families of the
victims of the 228 Incident, an uprising against the corrupt
Kuomintang administration that began Feb. 28, 1947 -- barely two
years after the end of half a century of Japanese colonial rule
-- and a subsequent bloody crackdown that resulted in the death
of thousands of civilians.
</P>
<P>
Lee said in a press release that according to the regulations
governing how to deal with the 228 Incident and compensation for
the victims, their families can ask for their damaged names to be
cleared.
</P>
<P>
According to household registration operations, the tags of
"mobster" or "thug" in household information do not pertain to
household registration and household registration offices around
the nation should delete all such references.
</P>
<P>
Lee also asked public and private institutions to fly the
national flag at half- mast Wednesday to mark the 60th
anniversary of the 228 Incident, which has been designated as the
nation's Peace Memorial Day.
