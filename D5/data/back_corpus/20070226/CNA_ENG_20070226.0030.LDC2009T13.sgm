Taiwan's representative to the Philippines donated 50 police
motorcycles on behalf of the Republic of China government to the
Philippines' Bureau of Fire Protection (BFP) under the Department
of Interior and Local Government (DILG) Monday.

<P>
Wu Hsin-hsing, head of the Taipei Economic and Cultural Office in
Manila symbolically transferred keys to the motorcycles to the
Philippines' DILG Secretary Ronald Puno in the ceremony held at
the BFP's headquarter. Puno reciprocated by presenting a
"certificate of thanks" to Wu.

<P>
The donation is the second extension of fire fighting aid since
the Philippines' DILG ex-secretary Angelo Reyes made a verbal
request of help from Taiwan in 2004. Taiwan's government made the
first donation of two ambulances, fire fighting equipment, and
140 police motorcycles in 2005.
</P>
<P>
Puno admitted that the BFP is short of money to purchase or
maintain equipment, adding that these 50 motorcycles will be
distributed to remote townships for fire patrol duties.
</P>
<P>
Wu said Taiwan's government hopes to help the Philippines in
building safer cities.  In addition to the donations  to the
Philippines government, Taiwan also donated more than 100 fire
fighting engines to volunteer fire fighters groups in Taiwanese
communities in the Philippines over the past decades.
