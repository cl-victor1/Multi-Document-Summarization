Promotion of casual games by the online video game industry has
expanded the market by bringing in many who would otherwise be
outsiders and changed the composition of the virtual world,
according to a recent study.
</P>
<P>
The Market Intelligence Center (MIC) under the quasi-official
Institute for Information Industry (III) conducted research into
online video game markets and found that light players, who spend
less than an hour per day playing games, make up 36 percent of
online gamers and for the first time outnumbered medium and heavy
players, the MIC officials said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Heavy players, who play games for more than four hours a day,
constitute 27.5 percent of the market while medium players make
up 35.9 percent, the study said, adding that compared to last
year's survey, light players have showed an increase in
percentage while both of the other two categories showed a
relative decline.
</P>
<P>
Heavier players tend to prefer multiplayer games, strategy games,
role-playing games and games with more complex design that
require more skill and practice, while light players favor
simpler ones, MIC researchers said.
</P>
<P>
With the game industry now making greater efforts to develop and
promote casual games that are simple and suitable for short
breaks, many people that were too busy to play games are being
drawn into the circle of online video game players, the study
said.
