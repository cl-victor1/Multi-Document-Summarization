12-YEAR EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM TO BE IMPLEMENTED IN 2009: PREMIER
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  Feb.  27 (CNA) 02/27/07  18:01:59 (By Elizabeth Hsu)
</P>
<P>
Premier Su Tseng-chang announced Tuesday that the government has
decided to prolong the compulsory educational system from nine
years to 12 beginning in 2009.
</P>
<P>
Su made the announcement while delivering an administrative
report at the Legislative Yuan. In the report, Su touted his
administration's achievements in the fields of education, social
security, transportation, health care, social welfare, and
economy.
</P>
<P>
Explaining  the decision,  Su said the government  regards
prolonging the compulsory education as a "must" measure in its
drive to strengthen national competitiveness.
</P>
<P>
He mentioned that it was 1968 when Taiwan adopted the nine-year
compulsory educational system. In that year, there were less than
10 countries which had adopted a compulsory educational system of
such length.
</P>
<P>
However, today more than 46 countries have adopted a fundamental
educational system of at least 10-years, the premier said.
</P>
<P>
In preparation for the implementation of the new system, Su said
the government will first carry out two projects this year,
including offering tuition fee subsidies to private high school
and vocational school students who are economically
disadvantaged, and subsidizing the operations  of high schools
with high-quality  educational environments.
</P>
<P>
In 2008, the government will undertake an overall effort to
promote a national program to provide learning assistance  to
elementary and junior high school students, Su noted.
</P>
<P>
The decision to prolong the compulsory educational system,
however,  triggered criticism from independent  Legislator  Lin
Ping-kun, who claimed that the government has never shown any
signs of wishing to promote a 12-year educational system before
it come out with the "sudden" announcement.
</P>
<P>
Lin criticized the government's apparent lack of regard for
working out proper resolutions of problems, such as disputes over
school district divisions that are expected to arise following
the implementation of the prolonged compulsory educational
system, before deciding to implement the new system.
</P>
<P>
Lin denounced the plan as an election gambit intended to woo
voters in the 2008 presidential election.
</P>
<P>
In response to the criticism,  Minister  of Education  Tu Cheng-
sheng explained the government had taken 10 months to come out
with a complete set of programs for the plan to prolong the
compulsory educational system. His ministry will convene public
hearing on the programs as soon as possible, and will invite all
of the relevant individuals, including school administrators,
teachers and parents of students to attend.
