The board of directors of state-run Taiwan Water Corporation
(TWC) decided Tuesday that the company's Chinese name, literally
Taiwan Provincial Water Corp., will be changed to Taiwan Water
Corp., matching its English designation, said TWC Vice President
Chen Fu-tien.

Chen revealed the decision after a board meeting at the company's
headquarters in Taichung city, central Taiwan, noting the
resolution will be delivered to the Executive Yuan for
ratification before beginning name-changing procedures.

Chen said the new name is expected to allow the company to adopt
a more appropriate image as a state-operated business.
