NO DAMAGE TO TAIWAN SOVEREIGNTY IN CROSS-STRAIT NEGOTIATION: MAC
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  Feb. 27 (CNA) 02/27/07  21:18:20 (By Flor Wang)

Although Taiwan would welcome more Chinese tourists to Taiwan and
is looking forward to direct charter flights between Taiwan and
China, the Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) has never compromised
national sovereignty in bilateral negotiations, MAC Chairman
Joseph Wu said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Wu made the statement to reporters after opposition Taiwan
Solidarity Union Legislator Tseng Tsahn-deng, in an
interpellation session earlier that same day, accused the MAC of
yielding to China in its efforts to reach agreement on the two
matters.
</P>
<P>
Tseng claimed that the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)
is leaning toward China, even though it "might seem on the
surface to be promoting Taiwan independence to gain voter
support."
</P>
<P>
According to Tseng, recent poll results showed that more than 74
percent of the people surveyed believe that Taiwan is an
independent sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
Brushing aside Tseng's allegation that the DPP has failed to
safeguard Taiwan's independent sovereignty in cross-strait talks,
Wu said that the MAC has never given way to China in bilateral
talks regarding the authority of the governments on the two sides
of the strait. In contrast, it has always tried to do its utmost
to safeguard Taiwan's sovereignty and standing, he added.
</P>
<P>
According to Wu, indirect passenger flights between Taiwan and
China are currently offered on three routes, via Hong Kong,
Okinawa or South Korea's Jeju.
</P>
<P>
Even if domestic carriers fly between Taiwan and China with a
transit  stop  in Hong Kong,  they are still  designated  as
"international" routes, Wu explained, rebutting local media
claims that they are classified as "domestic" flights.
