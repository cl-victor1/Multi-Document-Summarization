Taipei,  Feb.  27  (CNA) 02/27/07  11:50:23 (By Sofia Wu)

A former clerk with the Bureau of Immigration, which was
superseded by the National Immigration Agency at the beginning of
this year, was indicted Tuesday on charges of colluding with
"snakeheads" in smuggling Chinese prostitutes into Taiwan in
exchange for cash rewards.
</P>
<P>
The Taipei Prosecutor's  Office charged Lee Juo-ling  with
corruption and violations of the statute governing civilian
exchanges across the Taiwan Strait on suspicion that she had
offered tips to a human trafficking ring to facilitate the entry
of Chinese women to work as prostitutes.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, 145 other suspects, including tour operators, the
human trafficking ring mastermind, Chinese women and their local
bogus marriage partners, were also indicted on charges of fraud
and of violating the Statute Governing the Relations Between the
People of the Taiwan Area and the Mainland Area.
</P>
<P>
According to the indictment, Lee, a former member of a liaison
task force with the Legislative Yuan, was very familiar with the
processing procedures for Chinese women's entry permit
applications due to her long years of service at the immigration
office.
</P>
<P>
Lee is suspected of having told the human trafficking ring led by
Chung Ju-chih to have Chinese women fake pregnancy to get early
entry interviews. Moreover, she is accused of having on many
occasions asked her immigration colleagues to speed up processing
of their entry applications under the false claim that certain
lawmakers had requested it.
</P>
<P>
Under the scheme, the indictment said, 82 Chinese women had
managed to enter Taiwan via marriages of convenience, among whom
34 had received direct assistance from Lee. The Chinese women
tended to pose as brides of Taiwanese men before turning to
prostitution, the indictment said.
</P>
<P>
For each case, Lee allegedly received between NT$30,000 (US$910)
and NT$80,000, and she is believed to have raked in NT$2.04
million in bribes, while the human trafficking ring made about at
NT$6.8 million in total.
</P>
<P>
Lee was fired by the immigration office late last October after
she was taken into custody pending investigation. Chung and two
other accomplices were also held incommunicado to prevent them
from coordinating false stories.
</P>
<P>
One of Chung's accomplices, Lin Chieh-shan, a tour operator, is
accused of having on many occasions asked an independent lawmaker
to lobby for the speedy processing by the immigration office of
Chinese women's entry applications.
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors said no individual lawmaker or legislative aide has
so far been found to be involved in the case, but they added that
separate investigations have begun to determine whether any
lawmaker or legislative aide was involved in the case.
