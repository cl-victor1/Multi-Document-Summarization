The Kaohsiung Concerns Stray Animal Association (KCSAA) rescued a
stray dog that had been living on a freeway for more than two
years, an association spokesman said Monday.
</P>
<P>
The association sent a crew of more than 10 Sunday to a section
of the Sun Yat- Sen Freeway in the central county of Changhwa to
capture the dog, the spokesman noted.
</P>
<P>
The animal, which lived on scraps thrown to it by drivers, was
tranquillized by KCSAA staff following hours of chasing, the
spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
An initial checkup showed that the dog was in good shape, the
spokesman added.
</P>
<P>
The rescue, however, drew criticism from other rescue groups who
said the action was dangerous for both the catchers and the dog,
as well as violating traffic laws.
</P>
<P>
In response, traffic police said that considering the association
was helping "remove a road obstacle, " they would be lenient on
this occasion with the KCSAA but stressed that their action was
not encouraged.
