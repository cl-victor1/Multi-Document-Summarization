GOVERNMENT TO WORK ON PLAN TO GET FUGITIVE TYCOON BACK: MOFA

Taipei, Feb. 5 (CNA) 02/05/07  17:32:17 (By Lilian Wu)

Minister of Foreign Affairs James Huang said Monday that the
government will continue to work on a contingency plan to get a
fugitive tycoon back to Taiwan to face justice for a series of
scandals surrounding his business group.
</P>
<P>
Huang was referring to Wang You-theng, founder of the Rebar Asia
Pacific Group, who was taken into custody by the U.S. authorities
upon his arrival in Los Angeles Saturday because his Taiwan and
Dominican Republic passports were invalid as a result of efforts
by the Taiwan authorities.
</P>
<P>
Noting that a U.S. court hearing is expected to be held on Wang's
case within a week, Huang said it is inappropriate for the Taiwan
government to comment on the issue now that the case has entered
the U.S. judicial process.
</P>
<P>
"Taiwan will respect the handling of the case by the U.S.
judicial authorities and will continue to keep tabs on
developments and try to work out contingency plans," Huang said.
</P>
<P>
Wang first fled to China late last December shortly before the
Rebar scandal broke, from where he later fled to the United
States. Taiwan put him on its most-wanted list in mid-January. He
tried to fly to Myanmar via Singapore last Wednesday but was sent
back to the U.S. last Friday by the Singapore authorities as he
lacked the proper travel documents.
</P>
<P>
On reports that the government has spent lavishly on hiring top-
notch lawyers to fight the elite lawyer team expected to be hired
by Wang, Foreign Ministry spokesman Wang Chien-yeh said the
government has hired professional legal advisers and is seeking
their views.
</P>
<P>
Wang Chieh-yeh said that whether Wang will be able to enter the
United States is an issue for the United States to decide and
that the Taiwan government has no need to hire lawyers over that
issue.
