TAICHUNG CUSTOMS SEIZES PEAR TREE STEMS SMUGGLED FROM CHINA

Customs authorities have recently cracked down on smuggling in
central Taichung county, and seized over 60,000 pear tree stems
smuggled from China, which carried buds and flowers to be used as
grafts, customs officials said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Acting on tips, customs inspectors raided an illegal exchange of
some of the smuggled pear tree branches at the Tungshih town
fruit and vegetable market, and then discovered the rest of the
smuggled plants at a warehouse run by a local farmers'
association.
</P>
<P>
The inspectors found that all of the smuggled buds and flowers,
weighted 600 kg in total, are from premium strains, and provide
sufficient material for local farmers to raise grafted pears on
about 50 hectares of orchards, the customs officials said.
</P>
<P>
However, when examined by the Bureau of Animal and Plant Health
Inspection and Quarantine, the smuggled pear tree stems were
found to be hosting some virus- carrying foreign insects, the
officials said, noting that if the stems had been grafted onto
local trees, they would have badly affected the island's ecology.
</P>
<P>
During the raid, a 40-year-old man suspected of illegal trading
was arrested on suspicion of involvement in the illegal trading
of the smuggled stems. An investigation into the case is
underway.
</P>
<P>
Grafted pears are one of major fruits grown in Taiwan, with
farmers grafting buds and flowers from pear trees grown in
temperate areas like Lishan (Mountain Li) in central Taiwan, or
Japan, onto their plants to produce juicy and sweet "temperate
pears."
</P>
<P>
So far, it is permitted to import only pear buds and flowers from
certificated districts of Japan into Taiwan.
