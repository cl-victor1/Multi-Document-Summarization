Chen said he was very happy to have the opportunity to join
Scotty in participating in the first leadership summit between
Taiwan and its Pacific allies held last year in Palau.

Nauru is now preparing for the establishment of an embassy in
Taiwan, which was one of the conclusions reached in bilateral
talks held during the summit, Chen pointed out.
