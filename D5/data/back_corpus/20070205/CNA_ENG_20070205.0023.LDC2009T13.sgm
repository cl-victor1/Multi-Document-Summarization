KMT HEAD TO REVEAL 2008 PRESIDENTIAL BID `AT RIGHT TIME'
</HEADLINE>

Taipei, Feb. 5 (CNA) 02/05/07  17:02:40 (By Flor Wang)
</P>
<P>
Main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Ma Ying-jeou said
Monday that he will explicitly announce his 2008 presidential bid
"at the right time."
</P>
<P>
Ma made the remarks during a visit to the outlying county of
Penghu as part of his ongoing nationwide tour in his capacity as
KMT chairman to gain an understanding of public opinion since he
stepped down in last December as Taipei mayor following eight
years in office.
</P>
<P>
Ma has been troubled by the possibility that he will be indicted
on embezzlement charges over his alleged misuse of special
municipal fees earmarked for his discretionary use while serving
as mayor of Taipei. It was widely reported that the prosecution
is expected to end its probe into the case and that Ma is likely
to be indicted by Feb. 9.
</P>
<P>
Although Ma has been widely assumed to be the opposition "pan-
blue alliance's" best bet for the 2008 presidential election, KMT
regulations require that a party candidate must withdraw from
elections if prosecuted.
</P>
<P>
In response to a greeting from local KMT members who urged him
not to abandon his desire to take part in the next presidential
election despite the possible indictment, Ma thanked them for
their support and said that he will announce his presidential bid
"at the proper time."
</P>
<P>
Ma also met Penghu Magistrate Wang Chien-fa and County Council
Deputy Speaker Lan Chun-i to exchange opinions on local party
affairs.
</P>
<P>
Ma promised that the KMT and its allies in the "pan-blue
alliance" -- the People First Party (PFP) and the New Party --
will jointly field the most qualified candidates in December's
legislative elections and the 2008 presidential race.
</P>
<P>
According to Ma, the KMT primaries for the coming legislative and
presidential polls are slated to kick off in early April. "Unity
and reform are the party's unchanged top priorities," he said.
</P>
<P>
The "pan-blue alliance" cannot afford to have another split if it
wants to outgun the "pan-green camp" of the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party and the Taiwan Solidarity Union in the coming
elections, he said.
</P>
<P>
PFP spokesman Lee Hung-chun called on the KMT and the PFP to
collaborate  to tackle future elections  and meet high public
expectations based on their cooperation framework, now that the
two parties inked an agreement last month to form a formal
alliance.
</P>
<P>
Should the two parties fail to exercise greater combat ability
through the establishment of the new alliance, it will definitely
disappoint their many supporters, Lee said.
</P>
<P>
PFP legislative caucus whip Cheng Chin-ling said that she favors
the idea of fielding the two parties' common hopefuls in the
December legislative elections under the name of the alliance.
</P>
<P>
The two parties must do their utmost to secure "pan-blue" victory
in future elections and no options should be ruled out, she said.
</P>
<P>
Lee's and Cheng's comments came while answering  reporters'
questions after it was reported that KMT Secretary-General Wu
Den-yih and his PFP counterpart Chin Ching-sheng will begin this
week discussing cooperative issues for the year-end legislative
elections.
