TSU FIRM ON INDEPENDENCE, CLARIFIES EX-PRESIDENT'S REMARKS
</HEADLINE>

Taipei, Feb. 5 (CNA) 02/05/07  19:05:05 (By Flor Wang)

<P>
The opposition Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU) stands firm on its
dream of pursuing Taiwan independence and of making Taiwan a
normal country through writing a new constitution and changing
its official title, TSU lawmakers said Monday.
</P>
<P>
According to TSU lawmaker Ho Ming-hao, the party has never
deviated from its pro-independence stance through a change of the
nation's name and creating a new constitution, although it calls
for greater government attention to the people's livelihoods.
</P>
<P>
Ho's clarification of the TSU's standing came after former
President Lee Teng- hui, the party's so-called "spiritual leader,
" said recently in two separate interviews that there is no need
for Taiwan to pursue formal independence because it is already an
independent sovereignty. Lee also claimed that he has never
backed Taiwan independence.
</P>
<P>
Lee's remarks aroused strong criticism from supporters of the
"pan-green camp" of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)
and the TSU, with many of Lee's supporters' clubs planning to
disband.
</P>
<P>
In a bid to dispel public anger over his comments, Lee invited
pro-independence backers to have breakfast with him Sunday in
southern Kaohsiung city to clarify his stance regarding Taiwan's
future. He also said later the same day that he will keep
insisting on Taiwan's sovereignty and pursuing formal
independence and new constitution.
</P>
<P>
Claiming that many grass-roots supporters have accepted Lee's
explanation and no longer doubt his position, Ho urged the DPP
and pro-independence activists not to attack the TSU or Lee over
his statement, as the two parties need to continue cooperating.
</P>
<P>
TSU lawmaker Lo Chih-ming said that the party is determined to
adopt a left- leaning moderate path by sticking to the goals of
stepping up Taiwan's democratization and upgrading its economy.
</P>
<P>
The DPP should also adopt a middle-of-the-road policy if it is
afraid that the TSU's policy change could sway its supporters to
the TSU's fold, Lo said.
