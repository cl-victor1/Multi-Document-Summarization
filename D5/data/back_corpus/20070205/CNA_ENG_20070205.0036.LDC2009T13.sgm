QUESTIONS RAISED ABOUT SEXUAL HARASSMENT PREVENTION ACT
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taipei,  Feb.  5 (CNA) 02/05/07  18:50:23 (By Maubo Chang)
</P>
<P>
A lawmaker raised questions about the effects of the Sexual
Harassment Prevention Act one year after it went into effect
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Citing government statistics, Huang Sue-ying of the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party said there had been only 168
complaints filed under the law, with Taipei City, Taipei County
and Kaohsiung City accounting for 50 percent of them, and nine
counties reporting none at all, which the lawmaker claimed is
evidence that both the central and local governments have failed
to raise public awareness about the offense.
</P>
<P>
The lawmaker also raised the question of the ability of employers
to handle the complaints, as only 37 percent of the complaints
dealt by them were determined as harassment, while 75 percent of
complaints logged with police were determined to be offenses.
</P>
<P>
As the offenses prohibited under the act are often offenses also
covered by the Criminal Code, the Social Order Act or the Gender
Equity Education Act, Huang claimed it stirred up confusion among
the victims of sexual harassment about which law their case
should be pursued under.
</P>
<P>
In response to the last point of lawmaker's criticism, an
official from Sexual Assault Prevention Commission under the
Ministry of the Interior said victims can pursue their complaints
via whatever law they like, although the Social Order Act might
provide them with recourse more quickly than the other laws.
