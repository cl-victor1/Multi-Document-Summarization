Taiwan's foreign exchange reserves amounted to US$265.97 billion
as of the end of January, down US$176 million from the month-
earlier level, according to statistics released Monday by
Taiwan's Central Bank of China (CBC).
</P>
<P>
CBC officials attributed the slight decrease mainly due to
domestic investors increasing their foreign currency investments.
Taiwan remained the country with the world's third-largest
foreign exchange reserves after China and Japan, the officials
said.
