Former Premier Frank Hsieh, who has expressed confidence in his
possible bid to run for the presidency in 2008, suggested Sunday
that the registration of candidates for the Democratic
Progressive Party presidential primaries be moved ahead of
schedule.
</P>
<P>
Hsieh, in Los Angeles after attending the U.S. National Prayer
Breakfast in Washington, D.C. on behalf of President Chen Shui-
bian, said at a news conference that he would voice no opinions
about whether the DPP primaries should be held earlier than
originally arranged in May this year, but he suggested that the
primary registration be moved ahead of schedule. Registration was
slated for April.
</P>
<P>
He said early registration will help sort out sooner who exactly
is running in the presidential primaries and give more time for
inner party negotiation before a DPP ticket is finalized.
</P>
<P>
After the news conference, Hsieh delivered a speech titled
"Taiwan Identity, Reconciliation and Co-existence" at a dinner
party hosted by the DPP's U.S. West Coast Chapter in his honor.
</P>
<P>
Hsieh, who said during a recent interview with a Taiwan-based TV
channel that he is seriously considering running for the
presidency in 2008 and when he should formally announce his bid
if he decides to do so, said he first needs to complete a tour of
Taiwan's counties and cities to assess his ability  to shoulder
such a great responsibility and to evaluate his support base
before making a decision.
