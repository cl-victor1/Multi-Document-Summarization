Council of Labor Affairs (CLA) Chairman Lee Ying-yuan will sign a
memorandum of understanding (MOU) with visiting Nauruan President
Ludwig Scotty Thursday on bilateral cooperation in labor affairs,
a CLA official said Monday.
</P>
<P>
The official in charge of vocational training made the remarks
after President Chen Shui-bian said during a meeting with Scotty
earlier in the day that one of the purposes of Scotty's current
visit is to sign a labor cooperation agreement with the CLA to
pave the way for importing laborers from Nauru.
</P>
<P>
Noting that both Taiwan and Nauru are interested in cooperation
in labor affairs, the CLA official said the two sides have
decided to sign an MOU expressing their intention to forge
cooperative ties in the field.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, he said, the two sides have not yet discussed any
details regarding the introduction of Nauruan workers into
Taiwan. The CLA has not yet studied the feasibility of importing
Nauruan laborers and the concrete measures necessary for
implementing such a policy, the official said, adding that future
developments in this regard will depend on whether both countries
share similar ends.
</P>
<P>
Scotty arrived in Taipei Saturday for a five-day visit.
</P>
<P>
Nauru, which switched diplomatic recognition to Beijing in July
2002, re- established formal diplomatic relations with Taiwan in
May 2005 after Scotty was elected president of the South Pacific
nation.
</P>
<P>
According to President Chen, Nauru is now preparing for the
establishment of an embassy in Taiwan, which was one of the
conclusions reached in bilateral talks held during a leadership
summit between Taiwan and its South Pacific allies, including
Nauru.
</P>
<P>
Chen said exchange activities and cooperation projects between
Taiwan and Nauru have been proceeding very smoothly. Taiwan's
technical mission in Nauru has contributed much to agricultural
and fishing cooperation between the two countries and improvement
of the well-being of the Nauruan people, he added.
