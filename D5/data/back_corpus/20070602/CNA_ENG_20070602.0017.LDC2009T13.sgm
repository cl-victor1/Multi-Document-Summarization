SPOUSES

Taipei,  June  2 (CNA) 06/02/07  19:27:25 (By Lilian Wu)

A legislator of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)
said Saturday that for the sake of national security, the waiting
period for Chinese spouses of Taiwan nationals to obtain ROC
citizenship should not be shortened to four years from the
present eight years.
</P>
<P>
DPP Legislator Chang Ching-hui made the remarks as a Legislative
Yuan committee is set to review an opposition-initiated draft
amendment to the Statute Governing the Relations between the
Peoples of the Taiwan Area and the Mainland Area June 6 to cut
the waiting period in half.
</P>
<P>
Chang said that the DPP, as the ruling party, should consider the
views of the Mainland Affairs Council and the Ministry of the
Interior before deciding on how to deal with the issue.
</P>
<P>
She said that in addition to considering national security, one
should also consider the cross-strait situation and the
population density in Taiwan, adding that she has reservations
about the amendment, especially in the wake of reports of Chinese
women coming to Taiwan to engage in prostitution under the guise
of marriage to Taiwan citizens.
</P>
<P>
The current regulations state that Chinese spouses of Taiwan
citizens can apply to stay in Taiwan as a dependent after being
married for two years. After an additional four years of residing
in Taiwan for at least 183 days in each of those years, they can
apply for a long-stay visa. After two more years, they can apply
for citizenship, if they do not have a criminal record.
</P>
<P>
Main opposition Kuomintang Legislator Chu Feng-chi, who is one of
the authors of the draft amendment, said that the waiting period
should be shortened based on human rights considerations.
</P>
<P>
Another KMT legislator, Lee Chin-an, noted that under the current
immigration law, foreign spouses of Taiwan citizens can obtain
ROC IDs after four years, questioning why Chinese spouses have to
wait for eight years.
