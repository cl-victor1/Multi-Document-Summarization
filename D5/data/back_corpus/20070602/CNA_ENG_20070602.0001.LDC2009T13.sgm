Taiwan has donated funds for the Panamanian government to build
elementary schools in remote rural regions, repair highway
surfaces and expand prison facilities as part of a bilateral
cooperation program between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Hou Ping-fu,  the Republic of China ambassador to Panama,
presented the funds on behalf of the ROC government in a ceremony
held at Panama's Ministry of Foreign Affairs Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Panamanian first lady Vivian Fernandez de Torrijos, Minister of
Public Works Benjamin Colamarco and Minister of the Interior and
Justice Olga Golcher received the donations on behalf of the
Panamanian government. All of them delivered "thank-you" speeches
at the ceremony in appreciation of the ROC government's generous
aid.
</P>
<P>
A portion of the aid will finance construction of 90 elementary
schools in remote countryside as the Panamanian government is
actively promoting compulsory education in the country's rural
and distant communities, Hou said.
</P>
<P>
The fund will also be used to finance a project to repair a
20-kilometer section of a highway leading to the indigenous
community of Darien in eastern Panama, Hou said, adding that the
repair project will make it easier for aborigines to go to see
doctor in urban areas and help improve their living conditions.
</P>
<P>
As many of Panama's prisons are overcrowded, Hou said the
remaining fund will be used to foot the bills for a prison
facility expansion and renovation project.
</P>
<P>
"All of these aid projects are based on humanitarianism aimed at
helping disadvantaged children receive education as well as
assisting in renovating Panama's public facilities," Hou added.
