Taiwan exported NT$6.79 billion (US$205.75 million) worth of
medical equipment in the first quarter of this year, up 10.77
percent over the level for the same period last year, the
Industrial Technology Research Institute (ITRI) of Taiwan said
Saturday.

ITRI analyst Wu Hsin-jui said the growth was due mainly to an
increase in export orders,  noting that international  medical
equipment giants have continued to subcontract their orders to
counterparts in the Pacific and that demand in emerging markets
has continued to increase.

Taiwan's main medical equipment exports included vehicles for
disabled people, accounting for NT$630 million, or 15.1 percent,
of the total, as well as parts and accessories for medical
instruments, other equipment for experimental use or medical
treatment, and contact lenses.

Taiwan also imported NT$8.52 billion worth of medical equipment
in the first quarter, down 0.93 percent from NT$8.6 billion for
the same period last year. Taiwan mainly imported catheters,
canular, contact lenses, artificial dialysis equipment,
artificial bones, parts and accessories for dentistry and other
physiotherapy massager.
