Kaohsiung,  June 2 (CNA) 06/02/07  20:20:29 (By Sofia Wu)

Kaohsiung Mayor Chen Chu, who has been hospitalized since
suffering a minor stroke April 26, will remain in hospital for
two more weeks for further rehabilitation, a city government
official said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
According to Hsiao Yu-cheng, director of the Kaohsiung City
government's Department of Information,  Chen's doctors at the
Kaohsiung Medical Hospital advised Chen to build up strength in
her right leg and lose more weight before being discharged from
the hospital.
</P>
<P>
"Accepting her doctors' advice, the mayor has decided to stay at
the hospital until mid-June," Hsiao said, adding that Chen
originally asked to be discharged June 4 in order to be able to
attend the closing ceremony of the city council's current session
on June 7.
</P>
<P>
Hsiao said Chen has been recovering well. Quoting an assessment
by Chen's medical team, Hsiao said Chen can now easily walk 100
to 200 meters.
</P>
<P>
"But the doctors hope that the mayor can stay for two more weeks
to gain more strength in her right leg so that she will be able
to stand for longer periods of time and walk farther, " Hsiao
said, adding that the doctors also want to see Chen shed some
pounds before being discharged from the hospital.
</P>
<P>
Hsiao said Chen now attends three rehabilitation sessions per
day, including cycling on a stationary bike, walking up and down
a set of stairs, and embroidering.
</P>
<P>
Noting that all these rehab programs have borne satisfactory
results, Hsiao said Chen's condition has greatly improved. "She
now can read and sign official documents as usual," he added.
</P>
<P>
At present, Hsiao said, important documents are forwarded to Chen
by Deputy Mayor Chiu Tai-san. In some cases, department chiefs
are required to brief the mayor on certain key projects to avoid
delay in processing.
</P>
<P>
Over the past month, Hsiao said, Chen has occasionally made
inspection tours of some city development projects in the company
of her aides and security guards or visited her personal friends.
