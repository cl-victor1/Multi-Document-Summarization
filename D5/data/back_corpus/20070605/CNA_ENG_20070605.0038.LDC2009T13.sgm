Revenues of domestic airlines plying western Taiwan routes have
continued to decline, the Civil Aeronautics Administration (CAA)
reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
CAA officials made the observation despite the fact that domestic
airlines have been trying to attract more passengers with major
discounts aimed at closing the gap with fares on the high speed
railway and that four domestic airlines allow their air tickets
to be used on each other's flights on the Taipei-Kaohsiung route.
</P>
<P>
The officials said domestic airlines have been badly affected by
soaring oil prices and the slower economy in recent years. Since
the launch of the high speed rail system earlier this year, which
cut the rail travel time between Taipei and Kaohsiung to 90
minutes from the previous four-and-a-half hours, the impact was
even more serious.

<P>
The number of air passengers in western Taiwan has continued to
drop over the past three months, the officials said, noting that
the number of passengers was 207,000 in March, dropping to
189,000 in April and to 173,000 in May.
</P>
<P>
The Taipei-Kaohsiung route has the largest share of air
passengers. The number of passengers on the route was 137,000 in
March, 124,000 in April and 113,000 in May, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
Faced with the dwindling revenues, the airlines can do little,
the officials noted.
</P>
<P>
As the Taiwan High Speed Rail Corp. said it will increase the
number of trains in September, while world oil prices have
continued to be high, domestic airlines will have little leeway
for further price cuts, the official said.
</P>
<P>
Mandarin Airlines stopped flying the Taipei-Taichung route last
month. Although no other airlines have stopped flight routes so
far, the officials expressed worry that their competitiveness
might be getting weaker and that even if they do not suspend
flights altogether , they may have to cut the number of flights,
the officials added. ENDITEN/J
