Taipei,  June 5 (CNA) 06/05/07  21:03:13 (By Y.F. Low)

<P>
Taiwan's consumer price index (CPI) for May dropped 0.03 percent
from the same month of last year, marking the first time that the
CPI has declined after rising for six consecutive months,
according to tallies released Tuesday by the Directorate General
of Budget, Accounting and Statistics (DGBAS).
</P>
<P>
Compared with April, the CPI for May increased 0.21 percent,
DGBAS officials said.
</P>
<P>
For the first five months of this year, the CPI gained 0.72
percent over the same period of last year, the officials went on.
</P>
<P>
For May, the core CPI -- excluding fruit, vegetables, fish,
shellfish and energy -- went up 0.65 percent year-on-year, they
said.
</P>
<P>
By category,  medical  costs for May jumped  4.93 percent year-
on-year; food prices climbed 2.54 percent; clothing prices rose
1.86 percent; and housing costs increased 0.7 percent, they said.
</P>
<P>
Wu Chao-ming, a section chief at the DGBAS's Third Department,
said Taiwan's current consumer prices remain at a moderate level
and that the chances of comprehensive hikes are slight.
</P>
<P>
Wu attributed the hike in food prices for May to the rise in
imported crops such as corn and soybeans.
</P>
<P>
However, because of the good weather so far this year, the prices
of fruit and vegetables for May dropped 18 percent over the same
month of last year, Wu said.
</P>
<P>
Other items that became cheaper in May also include communication
equipment, digital cameras and televisions, whose prices declined
12.6 percent, 10.1 percent and 9.4 percent, respectively, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the wholesale price index (WPI) for May soared 7.59
percent compared with the same month of last year, owing to hikes
in the prices of primary metals, chemicals, and oil- and coal-
based products, according to the DGBAS.
</P>
<P>
While the prices of domestically produced products intended for
domestic consumption rose 5.96 percent year-on-year in May, the
prices of imports jumped 10.31 percent, due to a 4.53 percent
year-on-year depreciation of the new Taiwan dollar against the
U.S. dollar for the period, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
The prices of exports climbed 6.57 percent, they added.
</P>
<P>
For the first five months of this year, the WPI moved up 7.39
percent over the year-earlier level, they said, adding that the
DGBAS has predicted that the WPI for the whole of 2007 will rise
3.9 percent.
