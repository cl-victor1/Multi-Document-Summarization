<P>
Justice Minister Shih Mao-lin has expressed the hope of setting
up an integrated drug-fighting unit to boost efforts to stamp out
drug trafficking and abuse.
</P>
<P>
Shih made the remarks Monday in reply to a suggestion made by
Taoyuan District Prosecutor Ho Tzu-shun after holding a
discussion with individuals and groups that have made
contributions to drug-fighting efforts.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Justice (MOJ) had made a proposal in the past to
the central government to set up an integrated drug-fighting
unit, but the proposal was not approved, Shih said, adding that
the MOJ did not give up on the plan and that it has continued
working on it.
</P>
<P>
Shih also mentioned that future anti-drug efforts will focus on
prevention and education, rather than on stiffening penalties, as
experts in drug-fighting have suggested that teaching people
about the harmful effects of drugs is a more effective way to
encourage people to say no to drugs.
</P>
<P>
The MOJ will also enhance cooperation with the Council of Labor
Affairs in providing job opportunities and offering training
courses to drug addicts in treatment in order to help them begin
a normal life, Shih added.
