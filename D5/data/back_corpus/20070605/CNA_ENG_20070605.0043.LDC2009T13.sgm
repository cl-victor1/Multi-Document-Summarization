Minister of Economic Affairs Chen Ruey-long and representatives
of 16 large enterprises signed an endorsement for an energy
efficiency campaign Tuesday, promising to wear casual dress in
the office and to turn down air conditioning by one degree
Celsius in both the workplace and in their homes.
</P>
<P>
During the signing ceremony held by the Bureau of Energy (BOE) to
mark World Environment Day, which falls on June 5, Chen claimed
that the measures could lower Taiwan's electricity consumption by
2.5 billion kilowatt hours in summer, noting that this would be
enough to power Penghu County for 7.5 years.
</P>
<P>
Saving this much energy is also equivalent to avoiding 1.73
million tons of carbon dioxide emissions, Chen added.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated Premier Chang Chun-hsiung's  recent call for
government officials to wear casual dress to the office unless
they need to host meetings with foreign guests. Chang also
suggested that air conditioning in offices be maintained at 26-28
C as part of efforts to promote the Summer Energy Efficiency
campaign.
</P>
<P>
Under the BOE's assessment, the power load for air conditioning
accounts for 30 percent of the total peak load in summer. Based
on research, the air conditioning for people wearing suits and
ties has to be 1.6 C lower than that of people wearing casual
clothing, the BOE said.
