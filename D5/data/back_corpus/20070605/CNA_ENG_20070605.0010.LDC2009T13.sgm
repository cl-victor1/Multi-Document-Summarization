The government  may begin offering child-raising subsidies as
part of efforts to stave off a looming low birth rate crisis,
population administration officials said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
According to the officials, the Ministry of the Interior (MOI) is
scheduled to release a white paper on population policy late this
month, in which a child- raising subsidy is proposed as a measure
to encourage married couples to have more children.
</P>
<P>
Referring to practices adopted by advanced countries,  the MOI-
drafted white paper proposes a progressive child-rearing subsidy
system, under which families with children aged six and under
will be entitled to a monthly child-raising allowance, the
officials said.
</P>
<P>
In terms of the initial MOI proposal, families with a child aged
under six will be offered a monthly subsidy of NT$2,000 (US$60.6)
, while those with two young children will be given a monthly
allowance of NT$3,000. Those with three or more young children
will receive a monthly subsidy of NT$5,000.
</P>
<P>
MOI officials said the child-raising subsidy proposal is based on
the findings of a series of public opinion polls conducted by the
ministry and major academic institutions, in which more than 50
percent of the respondents consistently advocated the financial
support measure as an effective step to encourage childbirth.
</P>
<P>
The population policy white paper also proposes many other
feasible ways and incentives to boost childbirth, with the goal
of boosting the fertility rate from the present 1.2 children born
to each woman over the course of her life to 1.6 children born to
each woman over a period of 10 years, the officials said, adding
that when the goal is achieved, the number of newborns will reach
an estimated 300,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
As the MOI has received letters from many concerned citizens
asking for early disclosure of the contents of the white paper,
the officials said, the MOI will hold public hearings in
northern, central and southern Taiwan, respectively, from
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The MOI will refer to all the expert views and public opinions
presented at the hearings when putting the final touches on the
population white paper, which the ministry has spent NT$8 million
preparing, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
According to measures proposed in the white paper, families with
three or more young children will be given a special
identification card for their cars so that they can enjoy either
deductions or exemptions for roadside parking and freeway tolls.
</P>
<P>
Families with multiple children will also be offered preferential
rates in using public educational, recreational and entertainment
facilities, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
The white paper also suggests that men who have deferred
performing their mandatory military service because of education
and who have children can opt for alternative services without
lot drawing and can choose to serve at military bases adjacent to
their homes.
</P>
<P>
The white paper proposes that over the long run, equal maternity
and paternity leave benefits be offered to both female and male
employees. By so doing, the report says, the cost of employing
male and female workers will be almost the same, which will
ultimately contribute to gender equality in employment.
