NEW FISH LADDER HELPFUL IN PRESERVING ENDANGERED SPECIES:

The newly-built fish ladder in Shinwulu Creek, Taitung County has
been helpful in preserving the endangered Varicorhinus alticorpus
-- a species of fish endemic only to Taiwan, ecologists based in
the eastern county reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The species  of fish was discovered  in 1920 by Japanese
researchers. Since that time, its numbers have been decreasing
around the island due to overfishing and habitat destruction
caused by human activity. Shinwulu Creek and Beinan River in
Taitung have remained as the only two unthreatened major habitats
for the fish species in recent years.
</P>
<P>
However, members of local environment groups noted that "the
environment along Shinwulu Creek has been in jeopardy since a
water intake reservoir was built some years ago."
</P>
<P>
"Since that time, " they continued, "fish have died in large
numbers every summer in the creek, including the rare
Varicorhinus alticorpus, because the badly-designed reservoir
often leads fish into following dead-end courses."
</P>
<P>
In order to prevent further mass die-offs, the Water Resources
Agency under the Ministry of Economic Affairs appropriated funds
last year to build a fish ladder to help fish bypass the
reservoir.
</P>
<P>
After several months of observation, the local ecologists claimed
that the number of trapped fish has declined since the
construction of the fish ladder was completed early this year.
</P>
<P>
"However, there is still much more that can be done to save the
Varicorhinus alticorpus, " they noted, adding that "these
measures should be taken before the species becomes extinct."
