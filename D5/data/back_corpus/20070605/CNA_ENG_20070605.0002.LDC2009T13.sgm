MAC CALLS KMT CANDIDATE'S CROSS-STRAIT PLATFORM `CAMPAIGN
GIMMICK'

Taipei, June 4 (CNA) 06/05/07  11:05:08 (By T.C. Jiang)

<P>
Main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) presidential candidate Ma Ying-
jeou's cross- Taiwan Strait platform has neither feasible
assessments nor detailed action plans, a Mainland Affairs Council
(MAC) official said Monday, describing the platform as a
"campaign gimmick."
</P>
<P>
The remarks came after Ma said that if elected next year, he will
immediately embark on negotiations with China and hopes to reach
a peace accord on the basis of the so-called "1992 Consensus."
</P>
<P>
The 1992 Consensus, which the KMT claims was reached in Hong Kong
between Taiwan and China during its rule, refers to an
understanding that there is only one China, but with both sides
free to make their own interpretations of what "one China" really
means.
</P>
<P>
Ma proposed his platform at a meeting in Taipei with Taiwanese
businessmen operating in China.
</P>
<P>
The MAC official responded that the normalization of cross-strait
relations has always been the government's stance and that the
government has "an overall plan to promote the policy goal."
</P>
<P>
Any issues can be promoted through formal negotiations between
the two sides, the official said.
</P>
<P>
However,  Beijing  insists on basing talks on cross-strait
exchanges and interaction on its "One China" principle.
</P>
<P>
Under this principle, relations between Taiwan and China are part
of China's "internal affairs, " and cross-strait dialogue and
negotiations can only be conducted under the political framework
set by Beijing, the official said, adding that this is
unacceptable to a majority of Taiwan people.
</P>
<P>
Negotiations over direct flights and further trade cooperation
between the two sides should require no political premise, he
added.
