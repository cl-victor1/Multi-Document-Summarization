LEGISLATURE PROTESTS DOWNGRADING OF TAIWAN'S OIE MEMBERSHIP
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Taipei,  June 5 (CNA) 06/05/07  15:28:13 (By Y.F. Low)
</P>
<P>
The Legislative Yuan adopted a resolution Tuesday to express
strong protest against a recent move by the World Organization
for Animal Health (OIE) to downgrade Taiwan's membership to the
level of a "non-sovereign regional member" under pressure from
China.
</P>
<P>
Also, the legislature condemned China for resorting to political
manipulation to dwarf Taiwan's status as a sovereign country and
suppress the country's participation in international
organizations.
</P>
<P>
As an organization prompting animal health, the OIE should not
have discussed and even voted on any political motions that
violate its mission, the legislature said in the resolution.
</P>
<P>
Noting that there aren't any so-called "non-sovereign regional
members" in the existing OIE charter, the legislature claimed the
OIE's decision is totally illegitimate.
</P>
<P>
The legislature urged the OIE to correct its decision and ensure
that Taiwan's membership rights are not undermined to facilitate
the prevention and control of animal diseases around the world.
</P>
<P>
On May 25, the 169-member, Paris-based OIE voted in favor of a
resolution according to which Taiwan is requested to continue its
participation in the OIE as a "non-sovereign regional member"
under the new name of "Chinese Taipei."
</P>
<P>
Taiwan gained accession to the OIE in 1954 under the name of
"Republic of China (Taiwan) " but was forced to change the name
to "Taipei China" after Beijing was admitted to the organization
in 1992.
</P>
<P>
However, China remains dissatisfied with the alteration. In an
attempt to push the OIE to make further concessions on changing
Taiwan's membership name, China has refused to participate in OIE
activities and pay its membership fees.
</P>
<P>
To try to resolve the problem, the OIE International Committee
adopted a resolution in 2003 to change Taiwan's membership name
from "Taipei China" to "Separate Quarantine Territory of Taiwan,
Penghu, Kinmen and Matsu. "
</P>
<P>
At that time, Taiwan made clear that it would accept the new
name, but China refused to accept the resolution and did not take
part in the final vote on the issue.
</P>
<P>
Since then, the two sides have been using their membership names
that were chosen in 1992.
