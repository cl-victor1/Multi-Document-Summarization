The 2007 Taiwan International Orchid Show brought in NT$80
million (US$2.42 million) in on site sales and a further NT$1.5
billion in export orders, Tainan County Magistrate Su Huan-chih
announced at a news conference after the show closed Thursday.

Su said the nine-day exhibition attracted over 220,000 visitors,
including nearly 2,000 foreign visitors from 22 countries, thanks
to the assistance of the Taiwan External Trade Development
Council.

Su said there are a number of firms interested in participating
in the outsourcing of the county government's Taiwan Orchid
Plantation, which is to become an orchid park and market. A
research team from the National University of Kaohsiung will take
up residence and work in the park's greenhouse to help win
further export orders.

The park is to have permanent orchid exhibition and regular
orchid markets on holidays, Su said,  adding that the county
government will also work on establishing an orchid museum in the
park.

The 2008 Taiwan International Orchid Show is slated for March
8-16, right after next year's Tokyo International Orchid Show, Su
said.
