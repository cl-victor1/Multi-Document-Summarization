DPP DID NOT 'CLOSE' TAIWAN: PREMIER
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  March 22 (CNA) 03/22/07  18:50:15 (By Elizabeth Hsu)

The ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) has never acted to
"close Taiwan" from interaction with China, Premier Su Tseng-
chang said Thursday while rebutting criticism over the
government's cautious trade and investment policy toward China.
</P>
<P>
The government just does not want to "have all investments locked
up in China, " Su argued in his speech at a forum on Taiwan's
industrial and technological development that was organized in
Taipei by Merrill Lynch Taiwan, a financial management and
advisory company. The event heard a speech by former opposition
Kuomintang Chairman Ma Ying-jeou's two days earlier.
</P>
<P>
Out of national security concerns, the government must apply risk
management to economic activities, the premier explained, noting
that the government welcomes all kinds of Taiwan-Chinese
exchanges only if they favor Taiwan and do not affect Taiwan's
sovereign security.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a long-discussed proposal to launch direct flights
between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait, Su said the issue
will be seen with progress through "step-by-step" negotiations.
He added that cross-strait interaction has been significantly
boosted, given the fact that the ban on cross-strait trade,
postal affairs and transportation has been relaxed, with only the
restriction on direct transport still existing.
</P>
<P>
In response to media inquiries after his speech, Su said any
matters concerning government authority should be addressed by
governmental representatives, implying the impropriety of
opposition party contacts with the Chinese authorities in the
promotion of direct flights between the two sides.
