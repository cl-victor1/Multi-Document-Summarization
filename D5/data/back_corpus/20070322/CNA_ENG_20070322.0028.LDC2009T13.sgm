Taipei,  March 22 (CNA) 03/22/07  19:01:38 (By Sofia Wu)

The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) supports the government's
plan to promote medical tourism and allows foreigners to enter
Taiwan for medical purposes for a maximum six-month stay, MOFA
spokesman Wang Chien-yeh said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Wang went on, the ministry has no plans to create a
new visa category for medical purposes as reported by some media
outlets.
</P>
<P>
At the moment, MOFA offer four kinds of visa -- diplomatic visa,
courtesy visa, resident visa (long term) and tourist visa (short
term), Wang said, adding that there is no such category as
"medical visa."
</P>
<P>
Under the current regulations, Wang said, those who intend to
come to Taiwan for medical purposes can apply for a visitor's
visa together with proof of financial status and relevant medical
documents.
</P>
<P>
"Prospective medical tourists are welcome to apply for entry
through legal channels, " Wang said, adding that MOFA will extend
their visas for a maximum stay of six months.
</P>
<P>
According to Wang,  the Council for Economic Planning and
Development (CEPD) called a cross-department brainstorming
session earlier this month as part of its medical tourism
promotion drive, but media reports about the "medical visa"
issuance plan were untrue, he added.
</P>
<P>
CEPD officials said a day earlier that the government will give
priority to medical tourism promotion as part of its efforts to
expand tourist arrivals and beef up the local medical service
sector.
</P>
<P>
Noting that Taiwan enjoys an edge in several medical areas,
including  treatment of various liver diseases,  dental care,
craniofacial surgery, herbal medicine and health checkups, the
officials said the promotional efforts will focus on those fields
in the initial stage.
</P>
<P>
In addition to allowing medical tourists to stay for up to six
months, another system that will need to be established is an
online medical bill pre-paid system, the official said, adding
that the system will function like a deposit guarantee system to
prevent patients from absconding in the middle of treatment
without paying their bills and to head off financial disputes
between patients and hospital management.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the official said, the CEPD has contacted Taiwan
branches of major multinational insurance companies to seek their
assistance  for foreign tourists intending  to receive medical
treatment in Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
"Most foreign insurers have responded positively to our medical
tourism development initiative, which is expected to upgrade
Taiwan's image of offering advanced medical care and to boost the
local medical service sector," the official said.
</P>
<P>
While Taiwan has an edge in health and medical care technology
and prices, the official conceded disadvantages in language
proficiency and marketing talent, suggesting that the Department
of Health help nurture professionals in various fields and
strengthen Internet marketing and deregulation.
</P>
<P>
Several Asian countries, including Thailand, Singapore and India,
have a long history of medical tourism development. In 2005,
Singapore hosted 400,000 foreign patients, and the number is
expected to reach 500,000 this year, generating an estimated
US$1.5 billion in revenue.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to its colonial past, India has been a favorite medical
tourism destination for Britons. The South Asian nation expects
to rake in US$2 billion in medical tourism revenue in 2012.
