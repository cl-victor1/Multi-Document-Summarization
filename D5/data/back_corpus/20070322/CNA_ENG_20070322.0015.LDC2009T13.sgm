Kaohsiung,  March  22 (CNA) 03/22/07  16:12:19 (By Elizabeth Hsu)

President Chen Shui-bian told the Kaohsiung-based state-run China
Steel Corp. (CSC) management Thursday to change its name to
"avoid confusion" with similarly named businesses in China.
</P>
<P>
The move is vital, Chen told CSC Chairman Chiang Yao-chung during
a visit to the company to witness a trial test of the CSC's
second galvanization production line. But he also said the name
change drive should not harm the welfare of the company's
employees, the interests of the company's shareholders, or labor-
management harmony.
</P>
<P>
During a ceremony held to launch the trial, Chiang described Chen
as "the best spokesman for the CSC." In return, the president
said he is proud of being part of the steel refinery, which has
generated surging profits annually from more than NT$21 billion
(US$633.4 million) in 2000 to NT$45 billion in 2004 and NT$65
billion in 2004.
</P>
<P>
Chen also noted that with the second galvanization production
line, the CSC's annual output of galvanized products is expected
to double to 600,000 tons. Through the growth, the CSC's output
value is estimated to register an annual increase of NT$7.3
billion, Chen said,  adding that this excellent performance will
power the industry's drive to boost international
competitiveness.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the name change drive, Chen said it is a government
policy that will be implemented no matter what, pointing out that
the China Shipbuilding Corp. -- another Kaohsiung-based state-
operated company -- changed its English name into CSBC Corp.,
Taiwan March 1.
