NO 3RD-ROUND OF CANDIDACY MEDIATION FOR TIME BEING: PRESIDENT
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taipei,  March 21 (CNA) 03/22/07  10:49:31 (By Sofia Wu)

<P>
President Chen Shui-bian said Wednesday that he has no immediate
plans to convene a third mediation session aiming at finding a
solution to the ruling Democratic Progressive Party's (DPP's)
2008 presidential candidate nomination fray.
</P>
<P>
Chen made the remarks after undergoing a routine annual health
checkup at National Taiwan University.
</P>
<P>
In an effort to produce a DPP presidential ticket through
negotiations and avoid a potential split in the party, Chen has
already invited the four DPP presidential contenders --  Vice
President Annette Lu, Premier Su Tseng-chang, DPP Chairman Yu
Shyi-kun and former Premier Frank Hsieh -- to two rounds of
talks, neither of which has yielded tangible results.
</P>
<P>
For the time being, Chen said he would not hold a new round of
negotiations. Nevertheless, the president added, he will always
be ready to extend a helping hand if the four contenders feel
such a need arise. "At the moment, I see no signs of urgency," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Chen also took the occasion to discount the insinuation leveled
against Su that the premier had threatened to resign shortly
after first lady Wu Shu-jen was indicted on charges of
embezzlement from the president's discretionary "special state
affairs fund" and as a result forced Chen to declare his
intention to step down if Wu were to be convicted in the first
trial.
</P>
<P>
"The insinuation was based on false information, " Chen said
categorically.
</P>
<P>
According to Chen, the premier brought up the "resignation" issue
with him on four occasions between last September and January
this year.
</P>
<P>
In early September 2006, Chen said Su expressed his intention to
resign over the domestic crime situation. "I asked him to stay on
as he has delivered on his promise to reduce the crime rate in
the first six months of his premiership," Chen recalled.
</P>
<P>
The second time came in early November shortly after the closure
of prosecutorial investigation into the alleged "special state
affairs fund" misuse case, Chen said.
</P>
<P>
"Su clearly stated that he would step down as premier if it would
do the presidency any good or help stabilize the domestic
political situation, " Chen recalled, adding that he asked Su not
to talk about "resignation" for the sake of political stability.
</P>
<P>
Before heading to The Gambia for a visit last December, Su told
Chen that he would be willing to resign if the DPP were to lose
the Dec. 9 Kaohsiung mayoral election. After the Legislative Yuan
closed its winter session Jan. 19, Su again assured the president
that he would be willing to leave his post if the president
wished to make new personnel arrangements.
