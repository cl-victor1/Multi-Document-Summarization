LUSS PROJECT HAS SPOTTED 280 ASTEROIDS: NCU

The Sky Survey project at Lulin Observatory at Jade Mountain has
already discovered 280 asteroids, with a remarkable 179 near-
Earth objects spotted in the past half year, academic sources
said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Six of the celestial objects have been validated and assigned
designations by the Minor Planet Center (MPC) -- an institution
under the International Astronomical Union. The first two of the
six have already been named "Lulin1" and "NCU90."
</P>
<P>
The observatory was established and is operated by National
Central University (NCU) , which began site evaluation in 1989
and completed the construction as late as 1999. The facility
later received funding from the National Science Council, the
Ministry of Education, and other organization to expand further
its capabilities, in part through installing the first one-meter
telescope in Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
According to the NCU, a two-meter telescope will be full
operational by 2009.
</P>
<P>
Aside from the Sky Survey project, or LUSS, the observatory is
also participating in Taiwan- America Occultation Survey (TAOS) ,
East-Asia GRB Follow-up Observation Network (EAFON)  and Lulin
Emission Line Imaging Survey (LELIS).
</P>
<P>
Chen Wen-ping,  professor  at NCU's Graduate Institute  of
Astronomy, said the staff spotted its first-ever asteroid in 2002
with the one-meter telescope thanks to "a series of coincidence."
After closer observations with another 40-centimeter telescope,
the researchers determined its track and submitted the data to
the MPC.
</P>
<P>
Chen noted that without the help of Ye Quanzhi -- now a
university student in Guangdong Province, China, the LUSS project
would not have been able to discover so many near-Earth objects.
</P>
<P>
"We have cooperated with Ye since 2002, when he was still a high
school student," Chen related. "Ye replied to our request, saying
he was willing to help compare observation data of the first
asteroid, which was later named Lulin1."
</P>
<P>
"Ye's effort contributed greatly to the discovery of Lulin1, "
Chen added.
</P>
<P>
"Ever since, observatory staff have collected data on possibly
undiscovered asteroids, while Ye compared the daily data to
discover the subtle differences" Chen reported.
</P>
<P>
In order to honor Ye, the observatory -- which owns the naming
rights to asteroids found -- agreed to yield partial rights to
Ye, who is now entitled to name one-third of all their
discoveries.
