DPP URGES OPPOSITION TO STOP BLOCKING ARMS PROCUREMENT BUDGET
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  March  22 (CNA) 03/22/07  15:56:52 (By Sofia Wu)
</P>
<P>
The legislative caucus of the ruling Democratic  Progressive
Party  (DPP)  on urged its opposition counterparts Thursday to
stop blocking the budget for major arms procurement projects to
beef up the country's military might in the face of China's
mounting threat.
</P>
<P>
DPP legislative caucus convener Ker Chien-ming made the call
after an inter- party meeting failed to reach any conclusion on
the issue the day before.
</P>
<P>
While the opposition "pan-blue alliance" of the Kuomintang and
the People First Party, which controls a slim majority in the
Legislative Yuan, plans to railroad a draft bill on the Organic
Law of the Central Election Commission at a plenary session
slated for Thursday afternoon, the DPP caucus insists that the
2007 central government budget bill and several arms procurement
budget proposals be addressed simultaneously.
</P>
<P>
No consensus was reached at Wednesday's cross-party consultations
presided over by Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng.
</P>
<P>
Ker said it is hoped that the "pan-blue alliance" can support a
NT$11.3 billion budget plan for the procurement of Patriot PAC
III anti-missile batteries which has been frozen since a national
referendum on the issue failed three years ago.
</P>
<P>
"As the three-year restriction expired earlier this month, the
opposition parties should not continue to boycott the budget
plan, " Ker said.
</P>
<P>
According to the Referendum Law, the same issue cannot be
addressed within three years after a referendum on it fails. In
the failed March 20, 2004 referendum vote on the missile
procurement plan, slightly less than 50 percent of the eligible
voters cast ballots. Nevertheless, nearly 90 percent of those who
cast ballots voted in favor of the procurement.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Ker said the opposition parties should also increase
the budget for a submarine purchase plan. The executive branch
originally proposed an NT$4.5 billion budget for 2007 for a plan
to procure eight diesel-electric submarines from the United
States. The opposition-controlled legislature cut the budget to
NT$200 million for this year. Ker said the amount should be
increased at least to NT$2 billion.

<P>
Meanwhile, the Ministry of National Defense has unveiled its 2007
military training exercises schedule in line with its policy of
enhancing military transparency.
</P>
<P>
According to the schedule, a series of live-fire war games will
be staged from April as part of the military's efforts to assess
its defence capabilities against China's intensified military
expansion and missile threat.
</P>
<P>
The live-fire war games, codenamed "Han Luang 23, " will be
combined with other training drills, such as the "Lien Hsing,"
"Lien Hsiang, " "Lien Yun, " "Lien Yung, " "Shen Chien, " "Shen
Kung" and "Haisha" exercises, each with a specific combat
emphasis.
</P>
<P>
While the "Lien Hsing" drill will serve as a combined services
exercise for the Army, Navy and Air Force in combating an attack,
the "Sheng Chien" exercise will test the Air Force's air-to-air
missile defense capabilities, and the "Sheng Kung" exercise will
test the Army and Marines' surface-to-air missile defense
capabilities.
</P>
<P>
MND spokesman Rear Adm. Wu Chi-fang said earlier this week that
this year's "Han Kuang" exercises will be based on MND-drafted
"actual combat scenarios" with emphasis on practicality.
</P>
<P>
According to Wu, personnel from units across all military
branches will take part in the "Han Kuang" exercises scheduled
for April through May.
</P>
<P>
Besides the "Han Kuang" drills, the Navy will hold sea-to-sea
missile firing exercises in May and September, Wu said, adding
that the "Haisha" exercise will feature a joint sea and air
operation targeting submarines.
