A mailman in the eastern county of Hualien has made donations to
World Vision to help poor children in several countries for 10
years.
</P>
<P>
Chang Min-lang, who has worked as a mailman for 20 years, made
his first donation by helping a poor child in Lesotho, Africa, 10
years ago.
</P>
<P>
He said he did it for his sick father and later decided to
continue the sponsorship because he thinks it is meaningful.
Today, he sponsors four other children in Mongolia and Thailand.
</P>
<P>
Chang noted that many children in Taiwan enjoy much better living
conditions and seldom think about their poorer peers in other
countries who need financial support.
</P>
<P>
Chang said that his long-term donation has influenced his
daughters and they now realize the importance and the meaning of
helping poor children.
</P>
<P>
Chang said the whole family reads the letters sent from the
children they sponsor and share the joy together. He noted that
it only costs NT$700 each month to sponsor a child through World
Vision.
