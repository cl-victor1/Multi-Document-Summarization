Preliminary estimates show that Taiwan's foreign trade broke the
US$420 billion mark in 2006, marking a new high in the country's
trade history, Bureau of Foreign Trade (BOFT) officials said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The soaring two-way trade is forecast to generate a surplus of
some US$20 billion for the country for the year just ended, BOFT
officials said at a 2007 New Year news conference.
</P>
<P>
BOFT officials  said the bureau will continue helping the
industrial and business sectors to expand foreign trade and said
they are confident that Taiwan's foreign trade will grow even
higher -- by as much as 10 percent -- in 2007.
</P>
<P>
They also said the BOFT has selected nine countries -- Japan,
South Korea, India, Vietnam, Russia, South Africa, Brazil,
Malaysia and Turkey -- as major markets in which special efforts
will be made in the coming year to expand Taiwan exports there.
</P>
<P>
Two Middle East oil-exporting countries -- Saudi Arabia and the
United Arab Emirates -- have also been chosen for Taiwan
exporters to explore markets where new fortunes are being made
after oil prices have skyrocketed over the past several years,
BOFT officials said.
