Taiwan officials have voiced the hope that President Chen Shui-
bian will be allowed to make transit stops in different U.S.
cities on his way to and from Nicaragua, where he is slated to
attend the inauguration of Nicaraguan President-elect Daniel
Ortega next week, diplomatic sources close to the U.S. government
said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Noting that President Chen is scheduled to visit Nicaragua next
week, the sources said some details of Chen's upcoming transit
stops in the United States have yet to be finalized.
</P>
<P>
According to the sources, there are differences between the U.S.
government's considerations and the Taiwanese side's request.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. side is concerned about the content of the speeches Chen
will deliver to the Taiwanese expatriate community during his
U.S. transit stay, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
Consequently, both parties still have to build mutual confidence
in order to reach a consensus about Chen's forthcoming transit
stops in the United States, the sources said. They also denied a
media report that Los Angeles is among the cities where Chen is
likely to make transit stops.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Taiwan's representative to the United States, David
Tawei Lee, told reporters that he has been negotiating with U.S.
officials about President Chen's transit itinerary, which he said
will be announced in Taipei when finalized.
</P>
<P>
The inauguration ceremony for Nicaragua's newly elected president
is slated for Jan. 10. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs is
actively making arrangements for a Taiwan delegation to attend
the event.
