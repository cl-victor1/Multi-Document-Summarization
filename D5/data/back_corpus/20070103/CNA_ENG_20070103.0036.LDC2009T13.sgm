KMT HAS NO 'MODIFIED' STANCE: PARTY CHAIRMAN
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taipei,  Jan. 3 (CNA) 01/03/07  20:23:33 (By Flor Wang)

<P>
The main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) stands firm on "moderate
party line" in its dealings with the ruling Democratic
Progressive  Party (DPP)  to check and balance the government,
KMT Chairman Ma Ying-jeou said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Ma issued the clarification during a meeting with Legislative
Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng, who is also a KMT stalwart, after a
local daily newspaper reported that Ma, in last Wednesday's
Central Standing Committee (CSC) weekly meeting, expressed
willingness to reconcile with the DPP. The newspaper described
the KMT head's announcement as as "Ma's modified stance."
</P>
<P>
Saying that the KMT has to act rationally in the Legislative Yuan
and meet people's expectations if it wants to regain power in
2008, Ma added that the KMT will continue sticking to its
moderate party line and that he himself will also work hard in
accordance with the "Taiwan-centric" concept to meet the people's
needs.
</P>
<P>
He also expressed confidence that the KMT's decision-making unit,
the CSC, will approve a proposal suggesting that the party create
a formal political alliance with its ally, the People First Party
(PFP), to step up unity and satisfy their supporters' desires.
</P>
<P>
For his part, Wang said that it is vital for the KMT to know
where it stands and what path it wants to pursue for the country
and people. "What Ma hopes to modify or what he does not want to
modify is much less important," he said.
</P>
<P>
According to KMT legislative caucus whip Tsai Chin-lung, who held
a news conference that same day at the Legislative Yuan, the
establishment of a KMT-PFP alliance is a major public expectation
and he forecast that the party's CSC will soon give its green
light to a draft proposal on the issue.
</P>
<P>
The main opposition KMT and the PFP already form a loose "pan-
blue alliance" along with the New Party against the "pan-green
cam" of the DPP and the Taiwan Solidarity Union in Taiwan's
polarized politics.
