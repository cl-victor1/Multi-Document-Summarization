Although health authorities have provided free flu vaccinations
for certain targeted groups and repeatedly urged the public to
receive the shots, many people responding to a recent Center for
Disease Control (CDC) survey think such vaccination is
unnecessary.
</P>
<P>
Fifty-six percent of the respondents who have not received the
vaccination said that the flu is only a "minor illness" and that
there is no need to get a flu shot.
</P>
<P>
The survey, conducted from Dec. 22-24 on 1,104 adults around
Taiwan, has a margin of error of plus or minus 2.95 percentage
points.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the results, CDC Deputy Director-General Shih Wen-
yi said the public should not think lightly of the threat of flu,
which can lead to serious complications and even death in some
cases.
</P>
<P>
Shih noted that the risk of death from flu complications
increases with age, with those with chronic respiratory diseases
facing a higher risk.
</P>
<P>
According to CDC tallies, seven cases of severe influenza have
been reported in Taiwan this winter, one of which has resulted in
death, while the occurrences of mass flu infections at schools
have also been increasing.
</P>
<P>
In the past week, 1.26 percent of students have come down with
the flu, which is two to three times the figure recorded during
the same period last year, according to the tallies.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, CDC officials pointed out that a study conducted on
elderly people between 2000 and 2004 indicates that the wider the
coverage of the flu vaccination program, the more obvious its
effect in reducing the risk of flu patients being hospitalized
for pneumonia or chronic respiratory diseases.
</P>
<P>
In spite of the mistaken notion that the flu is a "minor illness,
" the CDC survey shows that the public generally has good
knowledge of the flu, with 86 percent of the respondents knowing
that the flu virus can be transmitted via coughing or sneezing.
</P>
<P>
Also, 84 percent of the respondents are aware of where to receive
flu vaccination, and another 68 percent know that the country's
flu season runs between December and March.
</P>
<P>
Among the respondents who have received the vaccination, 80
percent were eligible for free vaccination and 20 percent paid
their own bills, according to the survey.
