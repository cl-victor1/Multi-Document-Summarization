80% OF PEOPLE INFECTED WITH CHRONIC HEPATITIS B: DOCTOR
</HEADLINE>

Taipei, Jan. 3 (CNA) 01/03/07  21:27:09 (By T.C. Jiang)

<P>
Nearly 80 percent of Taiwan's population have been infected with
chronic hepatitis B and most people have recovered, while around
15 percent to 20 percent of the population carry the virus, a
doctor said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Chang Ting-chong, a doctor at the National Cheng Kung University
Hospital's Department of Internal Medicine in southern Tainan
City, pointed out that liver cancer or chronic liver disease is
among the top 10 causes of death in Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
The government began promoting infant vaccination with hepatitis
B vaccine in 1984. However, the number of hepatitis virus
carriers still remains high, Chang said, although he added that
the ratio of infants carrying hepatitis virus has dropped to 1.7
percent.
</P>
<P>
Of those who carry hepatitis B, 25 percent to 40 percent could
develop liver cirrhosis or liver cancer, Chang said, adding that
it is often very serious when they find out.
</P>
<P>
Chang said that a new medicine, Entecavir, released in 2006, is
very effective in fighting the virus with far fewer side effects
than other drugs for the purpose.
</P>
<P>
However, the medicine costs NT$200 per tablet and is not covered
by the national health insurance program, Chang said.
</P>
<P>
Patients need to take the medicine every day at a cost of more
than NT$70,000 per year, Chang noted, saying that this is a heavy
financial burden for many people, especially those in southern
Taiwan with low incomes.
</P>
<P>
Chang said it is impossible to eradicate the hepatitis B virus
and that patients have to receive long-term medication to avoid
liver cirrhosis or liver cancer.
