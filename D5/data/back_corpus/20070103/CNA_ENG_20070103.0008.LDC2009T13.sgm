The future president of the Republic of China on Taiwan should
have a strong world vision, team spirit and Taiwan-centric
consciousness, Examination Yuan President Yao Chia-wen said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Yao, who is currently in Washington, D.C. to attend the state
funeral of former U.S. President Gerald Ford on behalf of
President Chen Shui-bian, said Taiwan's future president should
have these three traits to gain the support of pro- independence
forces in the country.
</P>
<P>
Members of the pro-independence forces have declined to comment
on which of the four heavyweights  of the ruling  Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) -- namely Vice President Annette Lu,
Premier Su Tseng-chang, DPP Chairman Yu Shyi-kun and former
Premier Frank Hsieh -- is the best choice for the 2008
presidential election, Yao said at a tea party with members of
Chinese-language media outlets in Washington held at the Twin
Oaks estate -- the former residence of ROC ambassadors to the
United States.
</P>
<P>
Rather, Yao said, the pro-independence forces are now talking
about conditions and missions to determine which of the four DPP
heavyweights  is best suited  to represent  them in the next
presidential election.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Yao stressed that reforms will continue on the system
of granting an 18-percent preferential interest rate on certain
pensions of retired military personnel, civil servants and
teachers in a bid to "maintain social justice and balance the
nation's finances."
</P>
<P>
However, Yao also pointed out that opposition parties are welcome
to recommend their own versions on the reforms if their ideas are
better and more realistic.
</P>
<P>
Yao was appointed by President Chen to attend the state funeral
of Ford, who died last Tuesday at the age of 93. The funeral was
held at the Washington National Cathedral Tuesday. The late U.S.
president is to be buried in his hometown of Grand Rapids,
Michigan.
</P>
<P>
The Examination Yuan president is scheduled to return to Taipei
Thursday.
