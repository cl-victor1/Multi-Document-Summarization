Ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) Chairman Yu Shyi-kun on
Wednesday rejected an offer by opposition Kuomintang (KMT)
Chairman Ma Ying-jeou that he would like to act as a go-between
for the DPP and the Communist Party of China (CPC) for the sake
of cross-Taiwan Strait peace.
</P>
<P>
Describing it as "quite improper" for Ma to make such a proposal,
Yu said it seems that he has become "China's agent" in Taiwan.
Judging from Ma's move, Yu went on, "we can see that Ma has
maintained close contact with the Beijing leadership."
</P>
<P>
The DPP leader made the remarks during an interview with
reporters after attending a meeting of the DPP Central Executive
Committee.

As to remarks made by Examination Yuan President Yao Chiao-wen
earlier in the day in Washington, D.C. that President Chen Shui-
bian is a genuine pro-Taiwan independence leader, Yu said Taiwan
is an independent  country with sovereignty whose official title
is "Republic of China."
</P>
<P>
Asked whether Yao's words will have an adverse impact on
relations between Taiwan and the United States, Yu said that the
government will do its utmost to strengthen communications with
the United States.
</P>
<P>
Saying that Taiwan and the U.S. should join forces to pursue the
best interests for the two nations, Yu said that if Taiwan was
not an independent state,  it would not serve U.S. interests in
the Asia-Pacific area.
