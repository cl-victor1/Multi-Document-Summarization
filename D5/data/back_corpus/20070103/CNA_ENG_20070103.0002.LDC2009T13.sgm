The self-sufficiency rate of Taiwan's LCD equipment exceeded 30
percent in 2006, the Industrial Development Bureau said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Also exceeding expectations was the output value of equipment
assemblies for semiconductor manufacturing, assembly and testing,
which achieved NT$25 billion, according to the bureau under the
Ministry of Economic Affairs.
</P>
<P>
The government  initiated atwo-trillionproject  in 2002, setting
goals that the output values of both the semiconductor and flat
panel display industries should reach NT$1 trillion by the end of
2006.
</P>
<P>
The semiconductor sector reached its goal in 2004, and in
December 2006, the government announced that the flat panel
display industry had also succeeded, with both shipments and
output value of large TFT-LCDs surpassing those of South Korea.
</P>
<P>
The Industrial Development Bureau said the LCD industry is now
closer to another two goals set for 2009 -- self-sufficiency of
equipment  and assemblies reaching  80 percent  and that  of
manufacturing equipment reaching 60 percent.
