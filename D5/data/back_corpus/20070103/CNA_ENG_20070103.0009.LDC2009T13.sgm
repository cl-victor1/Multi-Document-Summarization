President Chen Shui-bian hopes the long-vacant seats of the
Control Yuan can be filled by the end of the current legislative
session, officials from the Department of Public Affairs under
the Presidential Office said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The officials made the remarks one day after a deadline for major
political parties to provide recommendations for the president to
choose from in drawing up a new list of Control Yuan member
nominees passed.
</P>
<P>
They said that the office has yet to receive recommendations from
all the parties, expressing the hope that the parties will
recommend qualified individuals as soon as possible for the
president to make a final decision.
</P>
<P>
"The president hopes the legislature can confirm the nominees
before the current legislative session ends Jan. 19, " the
officials said.
</P>
<P>
The ruling Democratic Progressive Party has decided not to
recommend any names, while its "pan-green camp" ally, the Taiwan
Solidarity Union, recommended its secretary-general, Lin Chih-
chia, and former Legislator Chen Cheng-lung.
</P>
<P>
Main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Ma Ying-jeou has
expressed the hope that the deadline for providing
recommendations can be extended from one week to one month, while
the KMT's "pan-blue alliance" ally, the People First Party, has
yet to decide whether to recommend names for the list.
</P>
<P>
The Presidential Office said last month that the president will
draw up a new list of Control Yuan nominees and asked all major
political parties to present recommendations for the new list,
which will include nominees for president and vice president of
the nation's supreme watchdog body and 27 Control Yuan seats, to
be submitted to the Legislative Yuan for approval.
</P>
<P>
In the past, President Chen had asked Vice President Annette Lu
to form a screening panel to review the public recommendations,
but this time, the vice president will not form a screening
panel. Instead, the president will choose from among the
recommendations he receives from the political parties, officials
from the Presidential Office also said.
</P>
<P>
The Control Yuan has been left vacant since the term of the
previous members expired on Jan. 31, 2005, mainly because of the
persistent obstruction of the opposition-controlled legislature.
Opposition lawmakers had expressed dissatisfaction with the
members of the screening panel, which also included Nita Ing,
chairwoman of the Taiwan High-Speed Rail Corp., who was under
investigation by the Control Yuan, as well as Clement C. P.
Chang, the nominee for Control Yuan president.
