The National Science Council (NSC) has appropriated NT$110
million (USD$3.4 million) to purchase five major international
databases on the humanities and social sciences, NSC officials
said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The databases are: Eighteenth Century Collections Online (ECCO),
Early English Books Online (EEBO), Early American Imprints (EAI),
The Making of the Modern World (MOMW) , and Periodicals Archive
Online (PAO).
</P>
<P>
Chen Dung-sheng, director of NSC's Department of Humanities and
Social Sciences, said that in recent years, local universities
have generally suffered from a shortage of development funds and
have been forced to allocate money to more "urgent"  items,
hence the procurement of books, journals, and databases on
humanities and social sciences has been neglected.
</P>
<P>
Chen said the NSC noted this dilemma and initiated a five-year
program to subsidize such procurements. Purchasing the databases
and offering one-year free access in 2007 for local universities
is the first step, he added.
</P>
<P>
Starting from Jan. 1, 2008, Chen explained, universities will
have to pay an access fee based on their faculty and student
numbers. For the largest universities,  the annual fee will be
about NT$183,000, while for smaller ones, the fee will be around
NT$67,000, he said.
