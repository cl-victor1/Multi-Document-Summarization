Chinese authorities should be more rational and pragmatic toward
relations across the Taiwan Strait, the Mainland Affairs Council
(MAC) said in a press statement Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Cabinet-level council, which charts Taiwan's policy toward
China, made the call after China's Taiwan Affairs Office harshly
criticized earlier in the day President Chen Shui-bian's New
Year's Day address in which Chen said the Taiwan people's right
of free choice  about their country's  future and the development
of cross-strait relations should be fully respected.
</P>
<P>
Dismissing Chen's statement as yet another move to promote Taiwan
independence, Beijing's Taiwan Affairs Office reiterated that
China would never tolerate any move to permanently secede Taiwan
from China.
</P>
<P>
In response, the MAC statement said President Chen's call respect
of Taiwan people's right of free choice about their country's
future and the development of cross-strait ties is based on the
basic principles of popular sovereignty and and the core values
of liberal democracy. Any criticism to such an appeal would only
highlight China's ignorance of democratic values and Taiwan's
mainstream public opinion.
</P>
<P>
After more than two decades of democratic reform, the MAC
statement said, Taiwan has developed a separate national identity
which the international community and China alike should respect.
