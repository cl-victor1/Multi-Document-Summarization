A proposal to relocate the Taiwan's capital from Taipei to
Kaohsiung, if realized, would create a "win-win" situation and be
very helpful in striking a balance in regional development, a
spokesman for Kaohsiung Mayor Chen Chu said Wednesday.

According to Hsiao Yu-cheng, Chen said the proposal to relocate
the capital city from Taipei to southern Taiwan would help
balance development in northern and southern regions -- which he
described as a "win-win" situation.

Chen was quoted as expressing her welcome that relocating the
capital to Kaohsiung would help improve Kaohsiung and "allow
Taipei to have greater hinterland for further progress," although
he did not elaborate on this claim.

Kaohsiung city, Chiayi city, Tainan city in southern Taiwan and
central Taichung city have all voiced welcome to the capital
relocation idea.
