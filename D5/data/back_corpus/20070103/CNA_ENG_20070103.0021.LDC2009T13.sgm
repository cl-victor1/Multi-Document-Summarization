The ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) has continued to
make plans in line with the proposed holding of the next
presidential and legislative elections simultaneously, DPP Deputy
Secretary-General Tsai Huang-liang said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Tsai noted that the party's primary for the next presidential
election will be held this May and that the move is based on the
proposed combining of the two major elections.
</P>
<P>
The candidate registration period for the primary will be in
March or April, Tsai further said.
</P>
<P>
He dismissed misgivings expressed by some DPP legislators that
the party has been dragging its feet on holding the primary to
choose a DPP presidential candidate, pointing out that the
primary will be held a month earlier than those for previous
presidential elections.
</P>
<P>
Under current system, the presidential election will be held in
March 2008, while the legislative elections, for which a new
"single-member constituency, two votes" electoral system will be
adopted, will be held at the end of this year. The number of
seats in the legislature will also be cut by half to 113 from the
current 225.
</P>
<P>
Tsai noted that coordination of the new constituencies, the
choosing of DPP candidates in tough constituencies, the primary
for the presidential election, as well as arrangements for the
debates among party hopefuls will all require time and that "May
is the most suitable time."
</P>
<P>
He said that if the two elections are held simultaneously in
January 2008, then there will be around seven or eight months to
make early preparations and drum up support for the DPP
presidential candidate.
</P>
<P>
DPP Chairman Yu Shyi-kun suggested  recently that the two
elections be combined for the sake of social harmony and cutting
costs, noting that many groups have expressed to him that there
are too many elections in Taiwan, which have caused rifts in the
fabric of society.
</P>
<P>
Yu has met with DPP legislators recently to build a consensus
within the party on his proposal.
