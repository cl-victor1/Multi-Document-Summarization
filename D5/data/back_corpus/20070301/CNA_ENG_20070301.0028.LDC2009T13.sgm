TAICHUNG BUSINESS, POLITICAL COMMUNITIES CALL FOR MA-WANG TICKET

Taipei,  March 1 (CNA) 03/01/07  19:09:00 (By Flor Wang)

<P>
Taichung Mayor Jason Hu, Taichung City Council Speaker Chang
Hung-nien and local business leaders called Thursday for a ticket
of former Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Ma Ying-jeou and Legislative
Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng representing the KMT in the 2008
presidential race.
</P>
<P>
Leading representatives from trade, business and political groups
based in Taichung city, Hu and Chang issued the call for a Ma-
Wang ticket to contest the election against opponents from the
ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) in the next
presidential election -- making the central Taiwan city the first
local government to voice support for the pairing.
</P>
<P>
Attendees of the informal Lunar New Year gathering also urged KMT
Acting Chairman Wu Po-hsiung, who participated in the meeting, to
officially seek the party's chairmanship, but Wu failed to give a
clear response and only said that he will do his best to hold a
party election for chairman in 38 days.
</P>
<P>
Stressing that his top priority now is helping reinforce the
KMT's unity, Wu said that no one has come forward to express an
intention to vie for the KMT chairmanship, left vacant by Ma's
resignation last month.
</P>
<P>
Ma resigned from the party's top post and announced  his
presidential bid February 13 after being indicted earlier the
same day on corruption charges over his alleged embezzlement from
a special monthly municipal allowance earmarked for his
discretionary use when he served as mayor of Taipei from
1998-2006.
</P>
<P>
According to KMT Secretary-General Wu Duen-yih, media reports
that Wu Po-hsiung might take part in the party's election for
chairman  or that Honorary  Chairman Lien Chan would  assume
chairmanship are both "unfounded."
