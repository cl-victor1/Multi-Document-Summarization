Taipei, March 1 (CNA) 03/01/07  13:14:29 (By Sofia Wu)

Barring any unexpected development, Premier Su Tseng-chang will
register March 6 for the ruling Democratic Progressive Party's
(DPP's)  primary for the 2008 presidential election, Executive
Yuan sources said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
According to the sources, Su was originally scheduled to register
for the DPP presidential primary March 5. The sources didn't
elaborate on the reasons behind the change.
</P>
<P>
Su formally announced his intention to run for the DPP's
nomination for the 2008 presidential race last Sunday at Fort San
Domingo, a famous historical site in Tamsui, Taipei County, also
known as Hung Mao Cheng, which literally means the "Fort of the
Red-haired Foreigners," an allusion to its former Western
occupants.
</P>
<P>
Choosing the historic site originally built by the Spanish in the
early 17th century and seen by the Taiwanese as a symbol of the
fact that the country was once ruled by foreigners, Su said that
"Taiwan's democracy must not step backward" and that "ownership
of Fort San Domingo must not change hands again."

<P>
The premier was the third DPP bigwig to throw his hat in the ring
for the DPP presidential primary after former Premier Frank Hsieh
announced his bid ahead of the Lunar New Year holiday and DPP
Chairman Yu Shyi-kun followed suit during the holiday.
</P>
<P>
Both Hsieh and Yu are scheduled to register for the DPP primary
March 8.
</P>
<P>
Of the party's likely candidates, only Vice President Annette Lu
has yet to announce her candidacy. A DPP legislator close to Lu
said earlier this week that Lu might register for the primary
March 8, but Lu's aides have denied this.
</P>
<P>
The  DPP headquarters  will  accept  registration  for the
presidential primary from March 5-9. Party members will vote on
both presidential and legislative hopefuls May 6, after which a
series of public opinion polls will be conducted. The vote by
party members is weighted to comprise 30 percent of a would-be
candidate's score, while the public opinion polls count for 70
percent. The presidential aspirant who receives the highest
approval rating will be named as the party's presidential
candidate May 30.
