Taiwan has exported 180 metric tons of award-winning Chihshang
rice cultivated in Taitung County to Japan, marking a big step in
introducing Taiwan's rice to the international market, a
spokesman for the Taitung District Agricultural Research and
Extension Station said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Chihshang rice is well-known in Taiwan for its fine quality that
comes from the good natural environment, warm weather, rich soil
and good-quality irrigation water of Taitung County's Chihshang
township, plus improved cultivation techniques.

<P>
The spokesman said the rice enjoys popularity in the Japanese
market and that the actual hybrid is known as Kaohsiung No. 139
rice, which has a very good flavor.
