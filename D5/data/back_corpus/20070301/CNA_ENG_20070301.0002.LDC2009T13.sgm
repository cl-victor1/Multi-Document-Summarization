Keelung,  Feb.  28 (CNA) 03/01/07  10:57:51 (By Sofia Wu)
</P>
<P>
The Keelung city government held a memorial service in front of a
monument in the northern port city at 2: 28 p.m. Wednesday in
commemoration of the 60th anniversary of the infamous 228
Incident.
</P>
<P>
Acting Mayor Hsu Ching-kun led department heads of the Keelung
city government and families of the tragic event in observing a
moment of silence in remembrance of all those killed in the
incident at the beginning of the memorial service.
</P>
<P>
The incident refers to uprising against the corrupt Kuomintang
administration under the late President Chiang Kai-shek that
began Feb. 28, 1947 and was followed by a bloody crackdown
resulting in the deaths of tens of thousands of civilians.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the incident resulted from the previous government's
wrongdoing, Hsu said the city government has held a memorial
service on Feb. 28 annually in the hopes of heeling the past
wounds and remind everybody to work together to avoid recurrence
of similar tragedies.
</P>
<P>
Acknowledging that it's not easy for the families of the 228
Incident victims to forget the trauma of losing their loved ones
to political persecution, Hsu said the city government is willing
to do every possible effort to help alleviate the historical
wounds.
</P>
<P>
In line with the central government's directive, Hsu said, the
Keelung city government will have the national flag fly at half-
mast at all municipal institutions from this year. It is hoped
that everyone in the country can commemorate the incident with
magnanimity and vision to boost social harmony.
</P>
<P>
Similar memorial services were held in all amjor cities and
counties around the country.
</P>
<P>
In Taipei, Mayor Hau Lung-bin attended a ceremony held at the 228
Memorial Park in the city's downtown district, in which Hau said
the incident has not only caused distress and affliction to the
victims and their families but has also sowed seeds of discord
and animosity between native Taiwanese and Chinese immigrants.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the lesson of the tragic incident lies in reminding
those in power to deal with people humbly rather than
oppressively, Hau said the tribulation caused by abuse of
political power can be irreparable.
</P>
<P>
Hau said he is determined to do whatever he can during his tenure
to heel historical wounds and mend ethnic division and
resentment.
</P>
<P>
The Kaohsiung city government in southern Taiwan sponsored a
special concert in commemoration of the 60th anniversary of the
228 Incident, with Mayor Chen Chu presiding.
</P>
<P>
In her opening remarks, Chen said the 228 Incident has come to
crystallize the beginning of a string of tragedies and abuses
that began almost immediately after the KMT troops arrived in
Taiwan at the end of World War II.
</P>
<P>
"These abuses, including the security census and the White Terror
that followed the 228 Incident, must never be forgotten if the
nation is to avoid repetition of similar tragedies, " Chen said,
adding that an indispensable  part of the process is the release
of all information from official investigations to let the facts
be known.
</P>
<P>
"True  forgiveness  is  only  possible  with  justice  and
understanding, and understanding must be built on facts and the
courage to face up to them and the consequences of their release,
" Chen added.
