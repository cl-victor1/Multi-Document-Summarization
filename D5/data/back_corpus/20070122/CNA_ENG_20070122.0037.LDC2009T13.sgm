Taiwan's former award-winning actor Su Yueh contracted
adenocarcinoma -- the most common form of lung cancer -- 23 years
after he quit smoking, a doctor at National Taiwan University
Hospital confirmed Monday.
</P>
<P>
Yang Pan-chyr,  vice superintendent of the hospital,  told
reporters that 76 -year-old Sun, who is recuperating from
undergoing surgery four days ago, will be released from hospital
on Jan. 25, and there is no need for him to undergo chemotherapy.
</P>
<P>
According to Yang, Sun has been troubled by chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease although he quit his four-packs-a-day smoking
habit 23 years ago. The disease is characterized by obstructions
to airflow that interferes with normal breathing. It is the
fourth leading cause of death in the United States, claiming
122,283 American lives in 2003. Smoking is the primary risk
factor for the disease.
</P>
<P>
In a recent physical checkup, doctors found that Sun had
developed stage I adenocarcinoma, meaning the tumor is located in
only one lung and has not spread to lymph nodes or outside of the
chest cavity.
</P>
<P>
Yang said Sun was lucky that his lung cancer was discovered in an
early stage, and that he has a 70 percent chance to live five
more years.
</P>
<P>
Yang said that inveterate smokers who have smoked for 20 years or
more, even if they quit the habit, will still be two or three
times more likely to contract lung cancer than nonsmokers.
</P>
<P>
He urged those who are addicted to nicotine to drop their smoking
habit as early as possible, so that their lung functions would
not deteriorate further.
</P>
<P>
Sun appeared in some 70 films during his 40-year career as an
actor before he retired in 1989 and dedicated himself to
volunteer work for charitable organizations.
</P>
<P>
In 1969, Sun won the best supporting actor award for his role in
"Storm over the Yang-tse River" in Taiwan's Golden Horse Awards.
He was again honored with the best actor award in 1983 for his
role in "Papa Can You Hear Me Sing" in the Chinese cinema's
equivalent of the Oscars.
