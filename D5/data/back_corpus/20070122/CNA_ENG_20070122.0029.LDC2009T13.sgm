There are 759 black-faced spoonbills recorded as overwintering on
the Tsengwen Estuary in southern Tainan County, according to the
latest census, the Wild Bird Society of Tainan reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The world census of the endangered birds was initiated by the
Hong Kong Bird- watching Society, with Taiwan, China, South
Korea, Japan, the Philippines, Vietnam and Macau taking part.

<P>
Since the Tsengwen Estuary provides a wintering ground for the
most migratory birds, the result of the survey attracted
attention.

The Wild Bird Society of Tainan and the Black-faced Spoonbill
Association in Tainan County conducted this year's census Jan.
20-21 and counted 705 of the rare birds on the first day and 759
birds on the second day, with neither figure achieving past
records.
