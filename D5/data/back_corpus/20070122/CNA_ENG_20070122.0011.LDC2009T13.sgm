EFFECT OF KMT, PFP TIE-UP REMAINS TO BE SEEN: LAWMAKERS

Taipei,  Jan.  22  (CNA) 01/22/07  13:27:04 (By Deborah Kuo)

Several Kuomintang (KMT) legislators expressed doubts Monday
about the expected positive effect of the tie-up between Taiwan's
two largest opposition parties -- the KMT and the People First
Party (PFP) -- and said it remains to be seen whether the
cooperation will strengthen their prospects in upcoming
elections.
</P>
<P>
KMT Chairman Ma Ying-jeou and his PFP counterpart, James Soong,
who is currently in the United States, signed an agreement Monday
in a satellite videoconference to provide a platform for mutual
cooperation between the two parties mainly in fielding candidates
in the year-end legislative elections.
</P>
<P>
The new alliance, according to KMT Secretary-General Wu Den-yih,
is expected to allow the KMT and PFP to jointly name the most
promising candidates for the next legislative elections.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the forging of the new pact, KMT Legislator Hsu
Shu-po said there is still a long way to go for the KMT and PFP
to cooperate substantively, particularly on the issue of how to
bolster the two opposition parties' clout on Taiwan's political
map -- an issue which also matters in terms of the "career
lifespan" of the two parties' leaders.
</P>
<P>
KMT Legislator Chou Shou-hsun said that whether or not Soong's
commitment to the agreement remains intact after he returns to
Taiwan will also be an important "index" to watch.
</P>
<P>
Another KMT legislator, Joanna Lei, said regardless of how the
KMT and the PFP collaborate, the issue of the "injustice"
regarding the Central Election Commission -- which she claimed
has been long manipulated by the ruling Democratic Progressive
Party -- needs to be tackled before the opposition parties can
envision a fair competition environment for elections.
</P>
<P>
On whether the two parties will use negotiations or primaries in
selecting candidates, the KMT secretary-general said that party
workers will try to persuade candidates whose approval ratings in
polls lag far behind to yield to those candidates who have
greater support and that only when two or more candidates are
running neck and neck in the same electoral zone will the KMT
recommend using primary elections to determine a single nominee.
</P>
<P>
The legislative elections at the end of this year will see the
use of the "single-member constituency, two-vote" electoral
system for the first time, with the number of seats in the
legislature being slashed from 225 to 113 and the terms of
legislators being extended from three years to four years.
</P>
<P>
Many incumbent legislators from the ruling DPP and the opposition
parties may lose their seats, but the new system will be
decidedly less favorable to candidates of smaller political
parties, including the PFP, according to political analysts.
