ST. LUCIA REAFFIRMS DECISION TO RESTORE TIES WITH TAIWAN
</HEADLINE>

Castries,  St. Lucia,  May 3 (CNA) 05/04/07  14:19:37 (By Chiehyu
Lin and Y.F. Low)
</P>
<P>
St. Lucia will not change its decision to re-establish diplomatic
relations with Taiwan despite China's intimidation, St. Lucian
Minister of Foreign Affairs Rufus Bousquet said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Stressing that St. Lucia is a sovereign country with the right to
choose its allies, Bousquet urged China to stop interfering in
his country's internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
Bousquet told the Central News Agency that since becoming aware
of St. Lucia's plan to restore ties with Taiwan, Beijing has
threatened to terminate its cooperation projects with St. Lucia
and even withdraw from the Caribbean Development Bank -- a
financial institution assisting Caribbean nations in financing
social and economic programs.
</P>
<P>
Between mid March and late April, when St. Lucia's Cabinet was
debating whether to resume diplomatic ties with Taiwan, China
suspended various development projects that it funded in St.
Lucia, including a mental hospital near the capital, according to
Bousquet.
</P>
<P>
Bousquet said Beijing also asked the leaders of its allies in the
Caribbean region as well as the secretary-general of the
Caribbean Community to call St. Lucian Prime Minister John
Compton to exert pressure on his country.
</P>
<P>
The St. Lucia first established diplomatic ties with Taiwan in
1984 but then switched diplomatic recognition to Beijing in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The Caribbean nation announced its decision to restore diplomatic
relations with Taiwan April 26. On April 30, Bousquet and his
Taiwan counterpart, James Huang, signed a joint communique on
restoring ties between the two countries in Castries.
</P>
<P>
According to a confidential document obtained by Taiwan, China,
in an effort to persuade St. Lucia not to restore ties with
Taiwan, had put forth an economic and technological project worth
300 million Chinese yuan (US$38.93 million) and offered to donate
US$3 million to the St. Lucian government and provide it with
interest-free loans.
</P>
<P>
Last week, China increased its offers to US$300 million in
donations and US$1 billion in loans for the St. Lucian
government, as well as US$1.5 million for each member of
Parliament, said Lee Chao-cheng, charge d'affaires of Taiwan's
embassy in St. Lucia.
</P>
<P>
Lee said a cutthroat diplomatic battle between Taiwan and China
is now going on in St. Lucia amid China's attempt to reverse the
situation, but Taiwan will not resort to checkbook diplomacy as
China has been doing.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Bousquet said the new St. Lucian government led by
Compton -- a long- time friend of Taiwan -- had originally not
intended to deal with the issue of its ties with Taiwan so early,
but the Cabinet's overwhelming  support for the resumption of St.
Lucia-Taiwan relations prompted Compton to make the announcement
last week.
</P>
<P>
Noting that Compton and his United Workers Party have promised to
boost St. Lucia's agricultural development, increase employment
opportunities for its citizens and narrow the urban-rural
development gap, Bousquet said he believes Taiwan has strong
abilities to assist St. Lucia achieve these goals.
</P>
<P>
St. Lucia hopes to maintain friendship with all countries around
the world and has no intention of involving itself in the
sovereignty dispute between Taiwan and China, Bousquet said.
