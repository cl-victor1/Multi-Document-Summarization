TAIWAN-BORN PITCHER AMONG TIME'S LIST OF 100 MOST INFLUENTIAL
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

New  York,  May  3 (CNA) 05/04/07  12:22:38 (By Hwang Jaw-pyng
and Sofia Wu)
</P>
<P>
Taiwan-born New York Yankees pitcher Chien-Ming Wang is among the
newsmakers on Time Magazine's 2007 list of the world's 100 most
influential people.
</P>
<P>
Wang, a 19-game winner last year and runner-up for the Cy Young
Award, is the third most outstanding Taiwanese to make the Time's
annual list designed to recognize "the men and women whose power,
talent or moral example is transforming our world."
</P>
<P>
President Chen Shui-bian was featured in the 2005 list's "leaders
and revolutionaries" category, and New York-based film director
Ang Lee appeared on the 2006 list's "artists and entertainers"
section.
</P>
<P>
Wang, one of the best sinker ball pitchers in the U.S. Major
Leagues and a star in Taiwan, was featured in the "heroes and
pioneers" category.
</P>
<P>
Betty Bao Lord, the Shanghai-born wife of former U.S. Ambassador
to China Winston Lord, described her deep feelings for Wang's
career achievements in an article carried in the May 14 issue of
Time Magazine due to hit newsstands Friday.
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Lord, a noted writer, wrote that the Yankees ace is a rising
star in the extremely competitive world of American professional
baseball. But in his homeland in Taiwan, she added, Wang is
already a "supernova."
</P>
<P>
"Whenever he pitches, whether it's a live telecast or a rerun,
Taiwan ditches its political woes and personal cares to huddle in
the most unlikely places -- from bars to beauty parlors to
boardrooms -- to cheer Chien-Ming. Regardless of whether shouting
alongside in mandarin  or mendicant,  from the mainland or local
born,  a great-great-grandma with bound feet or a bare-bottomed
tot, the voices are one," Lord wrote.
</P>
<P>
Recalling  that her love for Jackie  Robinson,  the first
African-American to play Major League baseball, helped her find
her way to the "American Dream" after her arrival in the United
States at the age of 8, Lord wrote that Robinson's excellence and
elegance broke the color barrier.
</P>
<P>
"Nowadays, the Ichiros, Dice-Ks and Chien-Mings of baseball are
chipping away at the culture barrier, " Lord wrote, adding that
at a time when "clashes of civilizations warm up in the on-deck
circle, " she dreams of a "hopeful and intimate" world through
various kinds of cultural exchanges.
</P>
<P>
Andrew L.Y. Hsia, director of the Taipei Economic and Cultural
Office, said Wang's selection as one Time's 100 most influential
people is not only an encouragement to Wang but also a help in
efforts to upgrade Taiwan's international profile and visibility
amidst China's diplomatic suppression.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the Government Information Office has invited Wang to
serve as a symbol or spokesman for Taiwan's international image,
Hsia said it's a wise deal. "Wang's presentation will be far more
effective and convincing than any commercial or publicity program
initiated by public relations companies," he added.
</P>
<P>
Wang began his U.S. baseball career in June 2000 when he joined
the Staten Island Yankees in the minor leagues. His early years
with Staten Island were plagued by shoulder problems. With his
fortitude and tenacity, Wang finally regained his health and
perfected his professional skills to make it onto the New York
Yankees roster.
</P>
<P>
He quickly came into the spotlight after he leapt into the Major
Leagues for the first time in the 2006 baseball season. With 19
wins during his first year in the Major Leagues, Wang set a
record for most wins by an Asian pitcher in one season.
</P>
<P>
On behalf of President Chen, Hsia presented a Presidential Award
to Wang in an unprecedented ceremony held at Yankee Stadium last
September in the presence of more than 50,000 baseball fans.
</P>
<P>
It marks the first time a foreign country has ever been permitted
to honor an outstanding baseball player at Yankee Stadium. As a
tribute, the stadium's main billboard referred to Wang as "the
Son of Taiwan."
</P>
<P>
The Time Magazine management will present awards to all the
listed influential people -- 71 men and 29 women from 27
countries -- in a grand ceremony to be held May 8 at New York
City's Lincoln Center.
</P>
<P>
The list does not rank the newsmakers but only divides them into
five categories -- leaders and revolutionaries, builders and
titans, scientists and thinkers, heroes and pioneers, and artists
and entertainers.
</P>
<P>
Prominent figures featured in this year's varied field also
include Pope Benedict XVI; Queen Elizabeth II; German Chancellor
Angela Merkel; U.S.  House Speaker Nancy Pelosi;  Steve Chen, co-
founder of the YouTube Web site; Chinese President Hu Jintao;
Beijing Olympics Organizing Committee Chairman Liu Qi; and Ho
Ching, head of Temasek Holdings -- the Singapore government's
investment arm -- who is also wife of Singaporean Prime Minister
Lee Hsien Loong.
