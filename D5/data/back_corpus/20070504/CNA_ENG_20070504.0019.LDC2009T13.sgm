TAIPEI COUNTY BECOMES DE FACTO 'SPECIAL MUNICIPALITY'
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  May 4 (CNA) 05/04/07  17:54:02 (By Elizabeth Hsu)

<P>
The Legislative Yuan passed an amendment targeting the Act on
Local Government Systems Friday, making Taipei county --
encircling the capital city and home to over 3 million people --
a de facto special municipality.
</P>
<P>
Special municipalities are at the top of three levels of local
self-governing organizations in Taiwan, followed by counties and
provincial municipalities, and townships and county
municipalities. A special municipality, like Taipei City and
Kaohsiung City, is under the direct jurisdiction of the Executive
Yuan and runs a separate election mechanism for the leadership of
the municipality.
</P>
<P>
Under the amendment, a county, whose population grows to surpass
2 million people, is endowed with privileges similar to those a
special municipality enjoys in terms of budget scale and
installation of personnel. The revision has been widely regarded
as a move to build a legal foundation for Taipei county to obtain
its special municipality status.
</P>
<P>
In his comments, Taipei County Magistrate Chou Hsi-wei repeated a
call for conveying the status, which the northern county deserves
and has long sought.
</P>
<P>
Chou indicated that as a county municipality, the county's budget
was capped at NT$75 billion (US$2.25 billion) per year, while the
county government is allowed to employ no more than 4,000 people.
</P>
<P>
As a de facto special municipality, Chou said the budget scale
will be expanded to NT$140 billion and the potential pool of
employees boosted to 15,000 persons. Moreover, the central
government will be obliged to pay for the additional personnel
costs, he added.
</P>
<P>
As the Taipei county government is about to escape dire financial
straits thanks to the revision, Legislator William C. T. Lai of
the ruling Democratic Progressive Party voiced concerns over
possibly exacerbating the resource imbalance between the north of
Taiwan and south.
</P>
<P>
Lai said financial difficulties are also burdening other counties
and cities, and expressed hope that the central government will
address the problem as Taipei county is set to begin consuming
more of the country's limited resources and tax income than it
did as a county municipality.
