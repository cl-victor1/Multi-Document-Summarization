CLA HOPES TO CUT RATIO OF RUNAWAY FOREIGN LABORERS TO BELOW 3.5%
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  May 4 (CNA) 05/04/07  20:19:32 (By Lilian Wu)
</P>
<P>
The Council of Labor Affairs (CLA) said Friday that it has
thrashed out a proposal to address the problem of absconding
foreign laborers in the hope that the ratio of runaways can be
lowered to below 3.5 percent within one year from an average 3.75
percent over the past three years.
</P>
<P>
Lin Wen-yuan, a section chief on foreign labor operations of the
CLA's Bureau of Employment and Vocational Training, said that
other goals of the proposal include increasing the number caught
to 10,000 from the 9,500 apprehended the previous year.
</P>
<P>
The number of illegal foreign labor brokerage firms busted should
be raised to more than 40, Lin added.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the CLA invited the Immigration Agency, the
National Police Agency, officials from local governments and the
Taipei offices of foreign governments that have laborers working
in Taiwan to discuss the problem in March.
</P>
<P>
The proposal thrashed out adopted a three-prong approach,
including the prevention of foreign laborers from running away
from their employers, a stepped-up crackdown on such laborers and
better management of foreign labor brokerage companies, he said.
</P>
<P>
Lin said the CLA also asked local governments to give teeth to
the new measures.
</P>
<P>
Local governments would severely punish those who illegally hire
or broker foreign laborers, imposing fines up to NT$750,000
(US$32,700) and NT$500,000 on them, respectively.
</P>
<P>
Absconded foreign laborers who are caught will be repatriated
immediately and fined between NT$30,000 and NT$150,000.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the fines, the CLA is also mulling whether to
double the reward for reporting runaway foreign laborers to
NT$10,000 from the present NT$5,000 per case.
</P>
<P>
The CLA also asked the local offices of countries of foreign
laborers in Taiwan to assist in persuading runaways to give
themselves up.
</P>
<P>
It also increased the number of inspection trips based on the
rating of each brokerage firm, and set a standard on related
charges for foreign laborers coming to Taiwan to prevent them
from being overcharged.
