Members of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) will go
to the polls Sunday as the party kicks off its presidential and
legislative primaries, DPP officials said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The officials estimated that the turnout rate will be around 60
percent, or around 150,000 out of 254,000 members. The results of
the member voting should be known by 10 p.m. the same day.

The member voting in the presidential and regional legislative
primaries Sunday will account for 30 percent of the hopefuls'
total score, while a string of public opinion polls to be
conducted between May 9-11 will account for the remaining 70
percent in deciding the party's candidates for the legislative
and presidential elections.

In selecting the party's candidates for at-large legislative
seats, member voting will account for 40 percent of the hopefuls'
score, while the public opinion polls will account for 60
percent.

<P>
The results of the DPP's presidential primary should be known by
May 12 at the earliest, the officials said.

<P>
With the fierce competition among the DPP hopefuls, the results
of the member vote are expected to influence the results of the
subsequent public opinion polls, the DPP officials said.

It has been widely predicted in media reports that among the four
DPP presidential hopefuls, Premier Su Tseng-chang will most
likely garner the most votes Sunday, although former Premier
Frank Hsieh and DPP Chairman Yu Shyi-kun are also expected to do
well. Meanwhile, analysts said that although Vice President
Annette Lu is not closely related to any of the party's factions,
she might garner a large share of the independent vote.

In terms of number of DPP members, Taipei County tops the list
with more than 35,000 members, followed by the municipalities of
Taipei and Kaohsiung, with more than 30,000 members each.
