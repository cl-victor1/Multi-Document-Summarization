FORENSIC EXPERT DOES NOT EXCLUDE SINGLE ATTACKER IN 1991 MURDERS

Taipei, May 4 (CNA) 05/04/07  16:33:54 (By Deborah Kuo)

U.S.-based, ethnic Chinese forensic scientist Henry Lee said in a
Taipei court Friday that he does not exclude the possibility that
a single attacker was responsible for the double murder and rape
of a couple in Hsichih, Taipei County in 1991, based on pictures
showing the crime scene.
</P>
<P>
Lee, who traveled to Taiwan from the United States specifically
for the trial, appeared as an expert witness in a Taiwan High
Court trial of Su Chien-ho, Liu Bing-lang and Chuang Lin-hsun --
known as the Hsichih Trio -- for the 1991 murder case.
</P>
<P>
Backing up his observation with slides showing the crime scene
and related evidence, Lee re-examined the kitchen knife that was
allegedly one of the three weapons the trio, together with
another accomplice, used in the double murder.
</P>
<P>
He said, given the different depths and angles of wounds on the
two victims, the single kitchen knife could have produced cuts,
stab wounds and hacks.
</P>
<P>
Examining a picture showing the condition of the couple's
bathroom in their home in Hsichih after the murder, Lee said it
does not look as though several people had cleaned up the blood
after the strife -- another clue prompting him to guess that
there might have been only one predator.
</P>
<P>
Judging from the victims' blood splatter and the fact that the
cuts were so deep that almost all reached bone, Lee inferred that
the murderer could be psychologically disordered, could have used
drugs shortly before the slaying, or had received professional
military training.
</P>
<P>
Lee was invited by Hsu Wen-ping, lead defense lawyer for the
trio, to appear as an expert witness as he had submitted a paper
in September 2001 on his examination into the evidence regarding
the double murder case.
</P>
<P>
In that report, Lee questioned a coroner's report saying that
there were two murderers who used three kinds of weapons in the
1991 case, which allegedly involved robbery, murder and rape.
</P>
<P>
The case stemmed from the 1991 murder of Wu Min-han and his wife,
Yeh Ying-lan. They were found dead in pools of blood in their
Hsichih apartment in Taipei County. They had received a total of
77 stab wounds.
</P>
<P>
Five months after the slayings, police arrested a suspect, Wang
Wen-hsiao, who implicated the other three as accomplices. Police
also believed that the four men had gang-raped Yeh before killing
her with a kitchen knife taken from her house in a botched
burglary.
</P>
<P>
Wang, who was a soldier at the time, was executed in 1992 after
being sentenced to death by a military court. The other three,
tried in civilian court, were convicted of robbery, murder and
rape and were sentenced to death. By 1995 the Hsichih Trio had
exhausted all their legal appeals.
</P>
<P>
However, Chen Han, State Public Prosecutor-General at the time,
was unsure of their guilt. Acting within his power as the state's
chief prosecutor, Chen made three extra appeals to the Supreme
Court to retry the case. The high court rejected all his motions.
</P>
<P>
The Taiwan High Court, however, granted the three defendants'
appeal for a retrial in 2000, and in the ensuring retrial, the
Taiwan High Court overruled the guilty verdicts after 31
hearings, saying that the defendants' confessions gave different
accounts of the time of the crime, the motive for the crime, who
did what at the time, who used what kind of weapon to kill the
victims, how they made their getaway, and how the spoils from the
robbery were to have been split up.
</P>
<P>
The differences in their accounts undermined the veracity of
their confessions and made them valueless in proving the
defendants' guilt even though they made their confessions of
their own free will, according to the court ruling.
</P>
<P>
The case has drawn the attention of local and international human
rights and religious groups. They criticized the guilty verdicts
as flawed and claimed they represented a travesty of human
rights. Some have even appealed to President Chen Shui-bian to
pardon the three.
