HENRY LEE APPEARS AS EXPERT WITNESS IN 'HSICHIH TRIO' TRIAL
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

Taipei,  May 4 (CNA) 05/04/07  14:58:00 (By Deborah Kuo)
</P>
<P>
U.S.-based ethnic Chinese forensic scientist Henry Lee appeared
as an expert witness in court in Taipei Friday in the trial of
the "Hsichih Trio" for the double murder and rape of a couple in
Hsichih, Taipei County in 1991.
</P>
<P>
Lee,  who has traveled  to Taiwan from the United States
exclusively for the trial, gave his opinions regarding the murder
case, backing up his position with slides showing the crime scene
and related evidence.
</P>
<P>
Lee was invited by Hsu Wen-ping, lead defense lawyer for Su
Chien-ho, Liu Bing- lang and Chuang Lin-hsun -- known as the
Hsichih Trio -- to appear as an expert witness as Lee had
submitted a paper in September 2001 on his examination into the
evidence regarding the double murder case.
</P>
<P>
In that report, Lee questioned a coroner's report saying that
there were two murderers who used three kinds of weapons in the
1991 case allegedly involving robbery, murder and rape.
</P>
<P>
Hsu said that because written papers cannot be used as evidence,
he decided to invite Lee to appear in court as an expert witness
-- which seldom happens in Taiwan courts.
</P>
<P>
After having spent more than 10 years on death row, the Hsichih
Trio were released in January 2003 by the Taiwan High Court due
to lack of evidence.
</P>
<P>
However, in August of the same year, the Supreme Court ordered a
retrial of the three. The Supreme Court threw out the not guilty
verdict handed down by three Taiwan High Court judges, saying
that they had evaluated evidence in the case in defiance of time-
tested rules, had defied logic, had failed to observe legal
guidelines, and had not done a thorough investigation into the
case before rendering a verdict.
</P>
<P>
Hsu said the three defendants' lawyers disagreed with the
prosecutors' claim that the killers used two kinds of weapons,
including a kitchen knife, based on the cuts on the victims'
skulls, even before the knife was found.
</P>
<P>
He said that the evidence in the case was insufficient to prove
that the three men were involved in the 1991 double murder.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Hsu said that prosecutors had based their case
mainly on the confessions of the men, which were inadmissible
because of the many inconsistencies among the suspects' accounts
and because the confessions may have been forced.
</P>
<P>
The case stemmed from the 1991 murder of Wu Min-han and his wife,
Yeh Ying-lan. They were found dead in pools of blood in their
Hsichih apartment in Taipei County. Their bodies had a total of
77 stab wounds.
</P>
<P>
Five months after the slayings, police arrested a suspect, Wang
Wen-hsiao, who implicated the other three as accomplices. Police
also believed that the four men had gang-raped Yeh before killing
her with a kitchen knife taken from her house in a botched
burglary.
</P>
<P>
Wang, who was a soldier at the time, was executed in 1992 after
being sentenced to death by a military court. The other three,
tried in civilian court, were convicted of robbery, murder and
rape and were sentenced to death. By 1995 the Hsichih Trio had
exhausted all their legal appeals.
</P>
<P>
However, State Public Prosecutor-General Chen Han at the time was
unsure of their guilt. Acting within his power as the state's
chief prosecutor, Chen made three extra appeals to the Supreme
Court to retry the case. The high court rejected all his motions.
</P>
<P>
The Taiwan High Court, howver, granted the three defendants'
appeal for a retrialin 2000, and in the ensuring retrial, the
Taiwan High Court overruled the guilty verdicts after 31 hearings
since then, saying that the defendants' confessions gave
different accounts about the time of the crime, the motive for
the crime, who did what at the time, who used what kind of weapon
to kill the victims, how they made their getaway, and how the
spoils from the robbery were to have been split up.
</P>
<P>
The differences in their accounts undermined the veracity of
their confessions and made them valueless in proving the
defendants' guilt even though they made their confessions of
their own free will, according to the court ruling.
</P>
<P>
The case had drawn the attention of local and international human
rights and religious groups. They criticized the guilty verdicts
as flawed and claimed they represented a travesty of human
rights. Some had even appealed to President Chen Shui-bian to
pardon the three.
</P>
<P>
Amnesty International  issued a statement  in January 2003
welcoming the release of the three death row inmates who were
acquitted by the Taiwan High Court of all charges brought against
them for the murder of the couple 11 years earlier.
</P>
<P>
Amnesty International's head office in London noted in the
statement that it had campaigned for the release of the three men
for some time, while pointing out the potential for injustice in
employing the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
The group also expressed the hope that the case would highlight
the irreversible nature of the death penalty if carried out.
</P>
<P>
It further said it hopes "Taiwan will take steps to join the
increasing number of countries outlawing the death penalty and be
a role model for the rest of Asia."
