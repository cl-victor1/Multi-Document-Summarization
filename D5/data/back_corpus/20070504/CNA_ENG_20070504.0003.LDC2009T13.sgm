SUHUA FREEWAY HINGES ON ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT: CABINET
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  May 3 (CNA) 05/04/07  10:35:41 (By Sofia Wu)

<P>
The fate of a project to build a freeway along Taiwan's east
coast -- known for its white beaches and towering cliffs --  will
hinge on a comparative environmental  impact assessment,
Executive Yuan spokeswoman Chen Mei-ling said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Chen's statement came after some 6,000 residents in the eastern
county of Hualien staged protests in front of the Presidential
Office and the Executive Yuan earlier in the day over the
government's long delay in building the proposed 89-km freeway
linking the coastal towns of Hualien and Suao in neighboring
Yilan County, commonly known as the Suhua Freeway.
</P>
<P>
Chen reiterated Premier Su Tseng-chang's announcement last week
that the government is inclined to build the Suhua Freeway, but
the project is still pending a comprehensive differential
analysis of the project's potential impacts on the region's
natural environment and ecology.
</P>
<P>
"Whether the freeway will be built will depend on the results of
the environmental impact review," Chen reaffirmed.
</P>
<P>
According to Chen, the National Expressway Engineering Bureau
(NEEB) of the Ministry of Transportation and Communications
referred a report on the project's potential effects on the
environment and relevant ecological conservation plans to the
Environmental Protection Administration (EPA) April 26 for a
review.
</P>
<P>
The EPA has asked the NEEB to provide additional data and an
analysis of the feasibility of carrying out the freeway project
in several phases, Chen said.
</P>
<P>
"As it takes time for the NEEB to prepare the EPA requested
reports, the Suhua project is not expected to be addressed at an
EPA meeting scheduled for late May to screen several other major
development projects' potential effects on the environment, "
Chen said.
</P>
<P>
On environmental activists' request for a debate with Premier Su
on the controversial Suhua Freeway project, Chen said the
Executive Yuan has asked the EPA to step up communication with
those groups.
</P>
<P>
The Suhua Freeway project has been delayed mainly because of
strong opposition from environmentalists, who say the project
could bring an "ecological calamity" to the last unspoiled area
of Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
The highway project, calling for an estimated outlay of NT$93
billion (US$2.8 billion) , would replace the rundown Suhua
Highway that winds through tall mountains facing the Pacific
Ocean and is prone to cave-ins and traffic accidents.
</P>
<P>
Hualien County, about 180 kilometers southeast of Taipei,
attracts thousands of tourists annually with its white beaches
and spectacular mountain sights. Its Taroko Gorge is famous for
pristine waters cutting through marble-speckled mountains.
</P>
<P>
Environmentalists said the planned freeway project -- bisecting a
fragile mountainous area -- could drive to extinction flora and
fauna unique to the district and drain underground springs. This
would have a deleterious effect on tourism, they claimed.
</P>
<P>
In contrast,  freeway  proponents  said any damage to the
environment could be reduced by state-of-the-art construction
methods -- such as using overpasses in elevated areas.
</P>
<P>
They claimed that the proposed freeway could considerably cut the
driving time to Taipei and thus help boost the area's beleaguered
economy.
