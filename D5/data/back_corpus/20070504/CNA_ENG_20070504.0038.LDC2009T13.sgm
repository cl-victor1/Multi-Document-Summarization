Taichung Customs Office agents seized more than 6,000 counterfeit
Burberry T-shirts and 822 fake Nike garments Friday, which the
licensed agents of the two foreign companies estimated to have a
record high market value of more than NT$65 million (US$2
million).

Tseng Wen-liang, deputy chief of an inspection team of the
Taichung Customs Office, said that two or three days ago,
inspection officers found a load of imported items from Singapore
to be very suspicious after they detected that the company in
charge of re-shipping the goods from Kaohsiung to Taichung had
declared each unit at an extremely low price of NT$15.

After an initial inquiry, the importer of the pirated T-shirts
was turned over to prosecutors for a further probe in accordance
with the Patent Law and other relevant regulations, Tseng said.
