BELGIAN MEDICAL GROUP BACKS TAIWANS WHO BID
</HEADLINE>

Brussels,  May 8 (CNA) 05/09/07  21:46:37 (By P.C. Tang and T.C.
Jiang)
</P>
<P>
The Belgian Association of Medical Unions has voiced their
support of Taiwans bid to become a member of the World Health
Organization (WHO).
</P>
<P>
The association wrote to WHO Director-General Margaret Chan and
European Commission president Jose Manuel Barroso Tuesday to
express its support.
</P>
<P>
The association is the second western European professional
medical association backing Taiwan's application for WHO
membership, after the European Medical Association wrote similar
letters to Chan and Barroso last week.
</P>
<P>
The association expressed its concern in the letter that the
exclusion of Taiwan from the WHO creates a gap in the global
health system, which poses a threat to the world, the WHO, and
its members.
</P>
<P>
That gap should be bridged, the association said.
</P>
<P>
The WHO should invite Taiwan to send representatives to attend
the World Health Assembly (WHA) as observers, and to participate
in a debate on Taiwans bid to join the WHO, the association
noted.
</P>
<P>
Recently, President Chen Shui-bian has written letters to
Margaret Chan, saying that Taipei has decided to use the name
"Taiwan" in its bid to join the WHO.
