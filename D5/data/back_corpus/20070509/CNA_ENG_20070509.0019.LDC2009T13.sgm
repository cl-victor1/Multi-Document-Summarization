BEIJING'S 'POLITICAL FRAME OF MIND' IMPEDING TOURISM TALKS: MAC
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  May  9 (CNA) 05/09/07  15:08:04 (By Deborah Kuo)

Taiwan's top China policy planner said Wednesday that Beijing's
political mentality has hindered progress in cross-strait talks
on Taiwan's planned opening to Chinese tourists.
</P>
<P>
Mainland Affairs Council Chairman Chen Ming-tong said that
Beijing established a "political frame of mind" by terming
Chinese citizens' visiting Taiwan for sightseeing as "going to
Taiwan, China," during the fourth round of cross-strait talks on
the matter.
</P>
<P>
Beijing's terminology remained unchanged in the fifth round of
talks, Chen said during the question-and-answer session at a
meeting of the Legislative Yuan's Home and Nations Committee on
issues regarding the opening of direct cross- strait air links
and the opening of Taiwan to Chinese tourists.
</P>
<P>
Chen said that the private Taiwan Strait Tourism Association has
engaged in five rounds of negotiations with its Chinese
counterpart, the Cross-Strait Tourism Exchange Association, since
late last year on technical details regarding the planned
opening.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Chen noted, from the fourth round of talks, the
Chinese have begun to "tamper" with the negotiations with
political rhetoric, adding that in a cross-strait business and
cultural forum held April 28-29, Jia Qinglin, chairman of the
Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, even stated
that cross-strait tourism does not mean leisure trips "between
two countries."
</P>
<P>
"Jia's remarks were the most obvious example of Beijing's
political frame of mind," Chen claimed, adding that such rhetoric
has impeded progress in the talks.
</P>
<P>
Chen made the remarks when asked by opposition Kuomintang (KMT)
Legislator Wu Chih-yang about what he meant by "political frame
of mind" in his comments made during a discussion sponsored by
the KMT legislative caucus May 2.
</P>
<P>
In response to a similar question put forward by KMT Legislator
Lai Shyh-bao, Chen said the MAC has hoped that China will forsake
its "political frame of mind" so that the cross-strait tourism
can move forward faster.
</P>
<P>
The Taiwan negotiators have even presented a copy of a new
version  concerning the talks  that  is more  pragmatic  and
mutually-acceptable, but Beijing has yet to acknowledge it, Chen
added.
</P>
<P>
Chen said May 2 that the prospect of Taiwan opening to Chinese
tourists does not look promising under Beijing's "political frame
of mind."
</P>
<P>
Noting that when Chinese tourists will be allowed to visit Taiwan
hinges on Beijing's attitude, Chen said Taiwan cannot be too
optimistic about the opening while Beijing imposes a political
frame and uses political language referring to the negotiations
on the proposed opening.
</P>
<P>
Chen also said in late April that he believes that cross-strait
negotiations over the issue have entered the final stage and that
it is up to Beijing to determine when Chinese citizens will be
allowed to travel to Taiwan for sightseeing. He further said at
that time that if Beijing gives the green light, the opening can
be implemented before the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
According to Taiwan's plan, a maximum of 1,000 Chinese tourists
will be allowed to enter Taiwan per day for a maximum 10-day
stay. Chinese tourists will be required to "enter and leave in a
tour group, " and the host Taiwan travel agency will be fined
NT$200,000 for any absconding Chinese tourist.
