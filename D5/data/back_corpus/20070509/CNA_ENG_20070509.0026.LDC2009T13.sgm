Prehistoric archaeological sites located on the campus of Tayuan
Elementary School in the northern city of Taoyuan cover two
different prehistoric cultures from two different time periods,
an archaeologist said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Prof. Liu Yi-chang, a researcher with Academia Sinica's Institute
of History and Philology, who is manager of an excavation project
at the elementary school, said that not only have two kinds of
prehistoric archaeological sites been found on the campus --
labeled the "Chienshan Prehistoric Site" -- it has also been
found that the site encompasses a vast area that reaches the
parking lots outside the Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport.

<P>
Liu and his team have been working on the site since late April
under a contract with the Taoyuan county government after stone
and pottery shards were unearthed by workers doing a campus
renovation project.
</P>
<P>
Since then, Liu said, his team has begun excavating in four spots
around the campus.
</P>
<P>
After  hand-digging  60-80  cm deep in these  spots,  the
archaeologists unearthed more stone and pottery shards, Liu said,
adding that through x-rays and computerized tomography scans,
some of the unearthed pieces were identified as relics from the
"Yuanshan Prehistoric Culture " of circa 3,000-2,500 years ago,
and some were identified as relics from the "Botanic Garden
Prehistoric Culture " of circa 2,500-2,000 years ago.
</P>
<P>
The artifacts and cultural layers of the Chienshan Prehistoric
Site provide ample evidence of a prehistoric people who inhabited
the Taoyuan area 2-3,000 years ago, Liu said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, officials from the Taoyuan County Education Bureau
said Wednesday that the Tayuan Elementary School's renovation
project will go on based on the premise that the excavation work
will not be affected and the prehistoric sites will be protected
from damage.
</P>
<P>
In the future, school authorities said, the Tayuan Elementary
School will be a window of the "Yuanshan Prehistoric Culture" and
the "Botanic Garden Prehistoric Culture" and that students from
all around Taoyuan County will be welcome to visit the school for
field trips on archaeological learning.
