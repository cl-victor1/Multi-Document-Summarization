GIO PROTESTS U.N. PRESS CARD SNUB
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  May  9 (CNA) 05/09/07  23:41:24 (By Sofia Wu)

<P>
The Government Information Office (GIO) expressed deep regret and
strongly protested Wednesday the United Nations' rejection of
applications from Taiwanese journalists for press cards to cover
the annual World Health Assembly (WHA) , the World Health
Organization's (WHO's) decision-making arm.
</P>
<P>
GIO Minister William J. Yih said the denial of the rights of
Taiwanese journalists to cover the WHA conference on the excuse
that Taiwan is not a U.N. member sets a bad example of yielding
to inappropriate political pressure from China at the expense of
press freedom.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the people of Taiwan have a right to know as much as
possible about disease control and epidemic prevention, Yih said
the U.N.'s denial of access to the WHA also infringes upon the
basic human rights of the Taiwanese people and the reporters'
right to work.
</P>
<P>
As the WHA is expected to discuss issues related to the
prevention of avian flu and other epidemic problems during its
upcoming meeting, Yih said the U.N. should have granted Taiwanese
journalists press cards to help enhance Taiwan people's awareness
of major infectious and communicable diseases.
</P>
<P>
Since epidemics know no border, Yih said, the realm of public
health should not be subject to political meddling. "We keenly
hope that the U.N. will respect the universal value of press
freedom, ignore  China's  political  interference,  and issue
Taiwanese journalists WHA press cards on an equal footing, " Yih
said.
