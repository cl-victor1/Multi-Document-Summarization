CABLE TV STATION APOLOGIZES OVER CONTROVERSIAL FOOTAGE
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taipei, May 9 (CNA) 05/09/07  18:55:51 (By Lilian Wu)
</P>
<P>
A local cable TV station apologized Wednesday over controversial
film footage that was aired in the television company's special
report to mark the 60th anniversary of the 228 Incident, a tragic
chapter in Taiwan's history that refers to a civil revolt and
bloody crackdown by the then-Kuomintang (KMT) government.
</P>
<P>
SET TV offered an apology to the public and to Juan Mei-shu, the
provider of the film footage who is also the daughter of a 228
Incident victim.
</P>
<P>
SET TV maintained that it was not "fabricating news" one day
after a local newspaper pointed out that a 20-second film clip
showing KMT troops killing civilians at close range in the street
with the subtitle of "blood-stained Keelung Harbor" was
misleading because it was in fact footage showing KMT troops
executing members of the Communist Party of China (CPC) in
Shanghai during the heat of a civil war between the KMT and the
CPC in 1948, one year after the 228 Incident.
</P>
<P>
Chen  Ya-lin,  a senior  anchorwoman  of the program  and editor-
in-chief of SET TV who said earlier that the showing of the
footage was meant to "project the image of massacre, " said
Wednesday that the company had "unwittingly" used the wrong
footage.
</P>
<P>
SET TV, which said in a statement a day earlier that it might sue
the United Daily News for libel, had to make an about-face after
coming under heavy fire, especially from the KMT camp, which
described the SET move as an attempt to defame and incite hatred
of the party.
</P>
<P>
The television company said in a statement Wednesday that when it
was producing the special report it used some clips from a
documentary film provided by Juan, who helped set up a memorial
hall in Pingtung County in honor of her father, Juan Chao-jih,
the former head of a newspaper who was a victim of the tragedy.
</P>
<P>
But the company apologized, saying it had "unwittingly" shown
unrelated footage of KMT troops executing CPC members, causing
trouble for Juan and the public.
</P>
<P>
SET said that it has received message from the National
Communications Commission requesting for a probe into the
anachronistic lapse. It would present a comprehensive report and
embark on internal review and discipline.
</P>
<P>
Juan, meanwhile, expressed appreciation to the TV station and to
Chen Ya-lin for attaching importance to the incident.
</P>
<P>
But on Chen's earlier remarks that the footage was aired because
the provider had not told her beforehand the historical
background of the film clip, Juan said it was SET TV that added
the subtitle of "blood-stained Keelung Harbor."
</P>
<P>
"If the TV company had checked with me, I would have told them
the clip had nothing to do with the 228 Incident," she said.
