KMT VOWS NO COMPROMISE OVER DRAFT CEC ORGANIC LAW
</HEADLINE>

Taipei, May 8 (CNA) 05/09/07  10:12:25 (By Flor Wang)

Main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) spokesman Su Chun-pin said
Tuesday that his party will not compromise on the Central
Election Commission (CEC) organization issue.
</P>
<P>
Su Chun-pin made the comments after it was reported earlier the
same day that Premier Su Tseng-chang and Legislative Yuan Speaker
Wang Jin-pyng will invite legislative caucus whips of the KMT and
the DPP to a discussion Wednesday to seek a way out of the
impasse at the Legislative Yuan over the KMT-proposed draft law.
</P>
<P>
According to Su Chun-pin, the KMT will not agree to the passage
of the 2007 government budget bill until after the KMT-proposed
CEC organic law is addressed or passed.
</P>
<P>
"This is the bottom line of the KMT and there is no room for the
party to yield its stance concerning the two bills, " Su Chun-pin
said.
</P>
<P>
The KMT spokesman accused the DPP of "duplicity" as it called for
"reconciliation" at the Legislative Yuan as long touted by former
Premier Frank Hsieh, now the DPP's presidential candidate, while
engaging in filibustering to prevent passage of the CEC bill.
</P>
<P>
The DPP lawmakers' "uncouth behavior" has tainted the Legislative
Yuan's image, he claimed.
</P>
<P>
KMT and DPP lawmakers broke into tussles that day in a Procedure
Committee meeting, which was slated to address the bill regarding
the formation of the 17-member CEC -- a critical issue as
legislative and presidential elections approach.
</P>
<P>
KMT lawmaker Tseng Yung-chuan, who also serves as director of the
party's Central Policy Coordination Committee, said the KMT
insists that no party can be allowed to field more than half of
the CEC members, in order to maintain the body's neutrality.
</P>
<P>
Against such a backdrop, the KMT suggested that the "pan-blue
alliance"  and the  "pan-green  camp"  each  recommend  six
representatives, Tseng said, adding that the remaining five
members should be selected from a shortlist of 10 respected
social figures, recommended by each party in proportion to the
number of seats they hold in the Legislative Yuan. However, the
DPP disagreed with introducing any party-based proportional
principle for CEC formation.
