BenQ Corp. Chairman Lee Kun-yao and four other senior company
executives have been indicted on charges of insider trading,
prosecutors in the northern county of Taoyuan said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The four others include company President Sheaffer Lee, Chief
Financial Officer Eric, Chief Financial Officer Alex Liou, and
accounting manager Billy Liu, prosecutors noted.
</P>
<P>
Lee Kun-yao, Sheaffer Lee, and Eric Yu are suspected of selling
over 6,700 company shares within one month after BenQ executives
realized in January last year possible huge financial losses from
the company's acquisition of of the money-losing mobile phone
division of Germany's Siemens Group.
</P>
<P>
The five profited more than NT$230 million (US$6.9 million) from
the sales, prosecutors said, adding that they first transferred
the money to their bank accounts in Malaysia, then wired the
money back to their Citibank accounts last March.
</P>
<P>
As the company share price began to fall later that month, the
three defendants used this money to begin purchasing over 4,200
shares in BenQ, prosecutors said.
</P>
<P>
Those purchases helped prop up the company's share price, which
had dropped from NT$34 per share to NT$27.1, prosecutors said.
</P>
<P>
According to the prosecutors, Lee helped prevent the company from
suffering a loss of NT$49 million.
</P>
<P>
Alex Liou and Billy Liu were indicted because Liou was fully
aware of Securities and Exchange Law and Liu had looked at BenQs
financial reports, but nonetheless assisted in selling the
company shares, the prosecutors said.
