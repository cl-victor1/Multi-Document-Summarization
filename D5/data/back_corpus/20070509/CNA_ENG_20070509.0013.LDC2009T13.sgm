Taipei, May 9 (CNA) 05/09/07  12:04:24 (By Sofia Wu)
</P>
<P>
Politics and corporate scandals have affected Taiwan's ranking in
a global competitiveness assessment, but Taiwan remains one of
the most competitive economies in Asia, the country's top
economic planner said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Ho Mei-yueh, chairwoman of the Cabinet-level Council for Economic
Planning and Development (CEPD), made the remarks after media
reports said the World Competitiveness Yearbook 2007 to be
released by the IMD Business School in Lausanne, Switzerland
later this week shows that Taiwan lags behind China for the first
time in its overall national competitiveness.
</P>
<P>
According to the reports, Taiwan dropped one notch to 18th place
in the latest IMD global competitivenss rankings, while China
moved up to 15th from last year's 18th place.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the reports, Ho said Taiwan has not regressed
substantially. "Taiwan was outshone by China mainly because the
latter has been on a fast upward streak," she added.
</P>
<P>
In the face of China's strong magnetic effect, Ho said, Taiwan
has actually done a good job in keeping its economy on track and
humming along briskly.
</P>
<P>
As a matter of fact, Ho said, Taiwan has withstood many tough
tests and challenges over the past year, including a credit card
debt storm, political turmoil caused by 'red-clad' protesters
against alleged official corruption, and the Rebar Asia-Pacific
Group-related financial scandal.
</P>
<P>
"For all those daunting challenges, we still managed to register
a higher- than-4-percent  economic growth rate,  coupled with a
lower-tha-4-percent unemployment rate, " Ho said, adding that
these figures reflect the resilience and strength of Taiwan's
economy.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Ho said, Taiwan ranks ahead of Japan and South Korea in
the latest IMD global competitiveness rankings. Among Asia-
Pacific countries, Taiwan only lags behind Singapore, Hong Kong,
Australia and China.
</P>
<P>
As the IMD will formally release its 2007 World Competitiveness
Yearbook May 10, Ho said the CEPD will make a formal response to
its report Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The IMD Business School has published the World Competitiveness
Yearbook annually since 1989. The yearbook analyses and ranks the
ability of nations to create and maintain an environment that
sustains the competitivess  of enterprises and contributes  to
upgrading of living standards.
</P>
<P>
The IMD evaluated 55 major economies around the world this year
in terms of four competitiveness factors -- economic performance,
government efficiency, business efficiency and infrastructure,
which altogether consist of 312 competitiveness criteria.
</P>
<P>
Generally speaking, Taiwan has been on a steady decline in the
IMD's overall competitiveness rankings in recent years, sliding
from 11th in 2005 to 17th in 2006 and further dipping to 18th
this year.
</P>
<P>
In contrast, China has been on a steep upward streak, leaping
from 29th in 2005 to 18th in 2006 and further rising to 15th in
2007.
</P>
<P>
According to the latest data, Taiwan's decline in the overall
competitiveness rankings was mainly due to non-economic factors,
such as weak social coherence and solidarity (ranking 51st) ,
political instability (50th) and policy inconsistency (48th).
</P>
<P>
In comparison, Taiwan remains robust in the economic realm. In
the IMD's economic performance rankings, Taiwan moved up to 16th
from 25th recorded in 2006.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan also made progress in the government efficiency category,
rising from 23rd in 2006 to 20th this year. However, its rankings
in the infrastructure and business efficiency categories dropped
from 18th and 13th to 21st and 17th, respectively.
</P>
<P>
According  to Economics  Ministry officials,  Taiwan's  IMD
competitiveness rankings in the economic performance category saw
dramatic changes in recent years, bouncing back nine places this
year after a substantial fall in 2006.
</P>
<P>
Noting that such a trend shows that Taiwan's industry is
undergoing structural transformation, the officials said Taiwan
needs more time and more efforts to overhaul its economy and
reinvent itself.
