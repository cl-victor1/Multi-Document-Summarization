ITALIAN HUMAN RIGHTS LEADER SUPPORTS TAIWAN'S WHO BID

An Italian human rights movement leader wrote recently to
Margaret Chan, director-general of the World Health Organization
(WHO), to express his support for Taiwan's bid to participate in
the organization.
</P>
<P>
Antonio Stango,  secretary-general  of the Italian Helsinki
Committee, said in his letter dated April 27 that the universal
right to health care is certainly in the spirit of the Helsinki
Final Act which firmly states the link between human rights and
security.
</P>
<P>
He also expressed his concern for the fact that Taiwan's 23
million people are still excluded from the WHO system.
</P>
<P>
"As experience showed, particularly in the outbreak of SARS,
being excluded from the WHO prevents the people of Taiwan from
directly receiving technical data and medical aid through WHO
formal channels," he wrote.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Stango went on, it creates a dangerous hole in the
global disease prevention network. "Diseases are not restrained
by borders, especially in an increasingly globalized world," he
pointed out.
</P>
<P>
He praised Taiwan as a responsible member of the international
community. "Taiwan has proved to be more than willing to do its
share to support peoples stricken by disasters and epidemics,
when it was not obstructed in doing so for merely political
reasons," the Italian human rights activist affirmed.
</P>
<P>
Participation in the WHO would not only help assure the health
and welfare of the people of Taiwan but would also allow Taiwan
to further contribute its medical expertise and resources to
other peoples in need worldwide, he concluded.
