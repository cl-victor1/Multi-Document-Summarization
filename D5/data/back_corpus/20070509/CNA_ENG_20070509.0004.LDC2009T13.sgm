KMT HOLDING POPULAR WELL-BEING HOSTAGE TO CEC LAW: PREMIER
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

Taipei, May 8 (CNA) 05/09/07  10:09:53 (By Sofia Wu)

Premier Su Tseng-chang lashed out at the main opposition
Kuomintang (KMT) Tuesday for its continued boycott against the
central government's 2007 budget bill, saying the party's
confrontational move is tantamount to holding popular well-being
hostage to its partisan interests.
</P>
<P>
Su made the remarks after the KMT-led opposition camp once again
blocked the government's 2007 budget bill from being included
into the legislative agenda earlier in the day.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the KMT's declaration that it would not budge an
inch on its stance that the issue regarding the composition or
makeup of the Central Election Commission (CEC) should be
addressed before the screening of the 2007 budget bill, Su said
such an irrational attitude would hinder national development and
economic growth.
</P>
<P>
Su said the KMT's insistence on introducing a party-based
proportional principle for the formation of the CEC cannot be
justified because the Council of Grand Justices already ruled
previously that an independently operating public institution,
such as the CEC, should not be formed in terms of such a
proportional principle because such arrangements would violate
the division of power spirit and prescription enshrined in the
Constitution.
</P>
<P>
He urged the KMT and its allies in the legislature to have a
second thought and begin to cooperate with the ruling party in
dealing with the long-stalled budget bill as soon as possible.
