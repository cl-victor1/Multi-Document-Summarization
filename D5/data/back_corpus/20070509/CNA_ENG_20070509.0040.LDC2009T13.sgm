Kaohsiung Deputy Mayor Chiu Tai-san said Wednesday that delay of
the 2007 central government budget passage will affect
construction of facilities for the 2009 World Games to be held in
Kaohsiung City.
</P>
<P>
Chiu also said that Kaohsiung City has to report construction
progress regularly to the International World Games Association,
the World Games overseeing institution. If construction lags
cause the IWGA to question the city government's ability to
implement its plans, Taiwan's international image will be
tarnished, Chiu added.

The Executive Yuan invited 25 local chiefs of cities and counties
to a meeting Tuesday to appeal for early passage of the 2007
central government budget, which should have been passed in late
2006 but is still pending in the legislature.
</P>
<P>
Cabinet Spokeswoman Chen Mei-lin said during the meeting that a
total of NT$51.14 billion in local governments' administrative
budget has been affected by holding up the 2007 central
government budget, with Taipei County having NT$5.1 billion
(US$153 million) tied up, Taipei City, NT$2.4 billion, and
Taichung City, NT$800 million.
</P>
<P>
Chen said that in addition to Kaohsiung City's 2009 World Games,
Tainan City's National Games in October and Taitung County's
Festival of Austronesian and Formosan Indigenous Cultures in July
both rely on passage of the general budget.
</P>
<P>
The Directorate General of Budget, Accounting, and Statistics
said that about NT$141.1 billion in subsidies appropriated to
local governments have also been affected by the long delay.
