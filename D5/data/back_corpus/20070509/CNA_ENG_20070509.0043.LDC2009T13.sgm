CIVIC GROUPS TO SPONSOR HIKES FOR TAIWAN'S WHO BID MAY 12
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  May  9 (CNA) 05/09/07  20:52:45 (By Luis Huang)

The Taiwan International Health Action (Taiwan IHA) group and
several civic organizations will sponsor urban hiking activities
May 12 in the country's two largest cities as part of their
efforts to push for Taiwan's entry into the Geneva-based World
Health Organization (WHO).
</P>
<P>
According to a Taiwan IHA official, the activities, titled
"Taiwan + WHO, I Care, " will be held simultaneously in Taipei
and Kaohsiung. Taiwan IHA is an ad hoc inter-ministerial body
established in March 2006 by the Cabinet-level Department of
Health and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to integrate public
and private resources for Taiwan's international humanitarian and
medical relief efforts.
</P>
<P>
Among the civil groups that will cooperate with Taiwan IHA to
sponsor the event are the Taipei-based Chinese Marathon
Association, World Vision Taiwan, the Foundation of Medical
Professional Alliance in Taiwan and the International Cooperation
and Development Fund, the official said.
</P>
<P>
Given the increasing degree of interdependence among countries in
this era of globalization, and outbreaks of bird flu and Severe
Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) , the official said, the
international community is aware that "diseases know no
boundaries, and no loophole can be allowed in the global epidemic
prevention system." As such, Taiwan's petition to enter the WHO
should not be ignored.
</P>
<P>
The official continued that the urban hiking activity is aimed at
demonstrating the strong desire of the 23 million Taiwanese
people to join the international health regulatory body.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan has sought to join the World Health Assembly (WHA) , the
WHO's decision- making arm, as an observer since 1997, but has
seen little progress due to China's obstruction. At the WHA
gathering last year, Taiwan's hopes of joining the organization
were dashed for the 10th consecutive year when the WHA General
Committee decided not to include Taiwan's bid on the assembly's
agenda.
</P>
<P>
This year, Taiwan has decided to apply for full WHO membership
under the name of "Taiwan, " in addition to continuing its
efforts to gain observer status in the WHA. The annual WHA
conference is scheduled to open May 14 in Geneva.
