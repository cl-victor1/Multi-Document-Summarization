Taipei,  May  9  (CNA) 05/09/07  18:25:52 (By Elizabeth Hsu)

The Executive Yuan passed a proposal Wednesday to abolish the
Provisions Governing the Organization of the Chiang Kai-shek
Memorial Hall Administration Office in a drive to transform the
monument from one to the late President Chiang Kai-shek into a
monument to the democratic movement in the country.
</P>
<P>
The facility will be renamed the "National Taiwan Democracy
Hall," Executive Yuan spokeswoman Chen Mei-ling said.
</P>
<P>
During work to transform the hall, which is one of the targets of
the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) administration's
recent drive to wipe out the image of the late dictator, Chen
said the Executive Yuan has decided to downgrade the facility to
the fourth level of public institution from its present status as
a third-level one.
</P>
<P>
With the move, the organic regulations for the Taiwan Democracy
Hall need not to be sent to the Legislative Yuan for approval,
Chen noted.  She added  the facility  will still  fall under  the
administration of the Ministry of Education (MOE), which will re-
open the hall located in downtown Taipei once it completes
procedures to publicize the new regulations.
</P>
<P>
The Exeuctive Yuan already approved the new organic regulations
April 13, Chen said.
</P>
<P>
The government's move to transform the CKS Memorial Hall has
drawn a protest from the main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) , which
staged a protest march through Taipei last month to defend Chiang
from the DPP administration's criticism.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, President Chen Shui-bian said on an occasion
marking the 60th anniversary of the 228 Incident that Chiang was
responsible for the bloody crackdown on the mass uprising on the
island in 1947 against his government's rule, which claimed many
thousands of lives.
</P>
<P>
Since then, the DPP administration has stepped up efforts to
remove Chiang's statues from public places throughout Taiwan and
to remove references to China from state-run companies and
institutions.
</P>
<P>
Chen Mei-ling said the memorial hall complex,  which also
accomodates the National Concert Hall and the National Theater,
has been the place activists often choose to hold campaigns for
their cause. It will be the perfect place for efforts to promote
democratic education, she added.
