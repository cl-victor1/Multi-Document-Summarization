A Taiwanese woman has been quarantined at a medicine center in
southern Taiwan after being diagnosed with measles that she
caught during a visit to Japan May 16-20.
</P>
<P>
According to a probe by the Center for Disease Control (CDC) into
the case -- the first of imported measles infection in Taiwan
this year, the woman fell ill around May 24 after returning home
from the trip, which had taken her to Osaka and Kobe in western
Japan.
</P>
<P>
However, the patient was not diagnosed until June 4, CDC
officials said Friday, stating that the woman made eight visits
to doctors from May 28-June 3, all of whom failed to make an
accurate diagnosis.
</P>
<P>
So far, none of the other members of the woman's tour group, the
people who live with her or her co-workers have developed
symptoms, according to the CDC probe.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan began mandatory inoculation against measles in 1978. The
patient missed the vaccination because she was born in 1976, CDC
officials said.
</P>
<P>
Japan has been affected by a massive measles outbreak since May,
with hundreds of people falling sick. Deputy CDC Director-General
Lin Ting suggested that people who are planning to travel to that
nation study their personal inoculation history, as the Japanese
outbreak has been found mainly to have affected adults.
</P>
<P>
Lin also advised local doctors to report to the CDC any cases of
patients who had visited Japan over the past few weeks developing
one or more of the major measles symptoms -- fever, coughing,
runny nose and conjunctivitis.
</P>
<P>
The incubation period for measles ranges from 10 days to two
weeks and the disease leaves patients vulnerable to middle ear
infections, pneumonia and encephalitis.
