San Francisco,  June 7 (CNA) 06/08/07  21:31:29 (By Josie Chou

<P>
United Airlines (UA) of the United States resumed nonstop service
between San Francisco and Taipei Thursday after a nearly four-
year hiatus.
</P>
<P>
UA organized a gala party in front of the Thursday noon flight's
boarding  gate to mark  the  resumption  of the  daily  San
Francisco-Taipei nonstop combined passenger and cargo service,
which was suspended in the fall of 2003 following an outbreak of
Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in Taiwan earlier that
year.
</P>
<P>
The party was jointly presided over by Hank Krakowski, vice
president of UA parental company's flight operations, and Liao
Wei-ping, representative of the Taipei Economic and Cultural
Office in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
Addressing those attending the event, Krakowski said that nearly
600,000 Taiwan citizens visited the United States last year, of
whom more than 190,000 visited California.  The resumption  of
San Francisco-Taipei nonstop flights will not only benefit such
visitors, but will also help bolster cultural and economic ties
between people from the two countries, he added.
</P>
<P>
Also speaking at the party, Liao called on American passengers
taking the nonstop UA flights from San Francisco to Taipei for
business reasons to make the most of their time in Taiwan. "Tap
into Taiwan's rich tourism resources and Taiwan will touch your
heart, " Liao said.
</P>
<P>
Passengers and others attending the gala party came away with
great impression after obtaining brochures highlighting some of
Taiwan's top tourist attractions and being treated to Taiwanese
snack delicacies, including pineapple cakes and tapioca "pearl
tea."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, according to Mark Schwab, vice president of UA's
Pacific operations, the UA is delighted to resume nonstop service
over the summer season when customers demand for seats to the
United States is traditionally high.
</P>
<P>
The resumption of the UA nonstop Taipei-San Francisco service
alsl underscores UA's ongoing commitment to the Asia Pacific
region where nearly a quarter of the company's capacity is
currently deployed, Schwab said.
</P>
<P>
UA will continue to offer a daily service from Taipei to Tokyo
Narita, which will in turn offer smooth connections to
Washington, D.C., Chicago, Seattle, Los Angeles and Honolulu, a
UA Taipei spokeswoman said.
