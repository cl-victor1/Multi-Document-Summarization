Tainan,  June  8 (CNA) 06/08/07  20:26:17 (By Lilian Wu)

National Cheng Kung University (NCKU) launched an afternoon
coffee program Friday, the first of its kind, in the hope of
bringing together people from various fields to share their
thoughts and induce innovative thinking.
</P>
<P>
NCKU President Michael M.C. Lai, who floated the idea, said the
program, dubbed "Ecko," takes place at between 3: 30 p.m. and 5
p.m. every Friday.
</P>
<P>
There will be a speaker each time talking about a specific
subject, but they will only speak for five minutes and the rest
of the time will be left for participants to mingle and chat over
tea or coffee, the U.S.-educated scholar in molecular biology
said.
</P>
<P>
Lai said that he took his cue from the tradition of afternoon tea
in Britain, saying that although  research funds for British
universities are not as big as their counterparts in Taiwan,
British students are very innovative in research work, which he
attributed to what he claimed is their "afternoon tea practice."
</P>
<P>
He said starting the university's coffee program is designed to
"set up a culture and a concept."
</P>
<P>
Students can make use of the informal occasion to get to know
each other and gain access to areas other than their own, he
added.
</P>
<P>
The program has won the support of business tycoon Hsu Wen-lung,
founder of the Chi Mei Group. The first speaker Friday was a
member of the Chi Mei Mandolin Orchestra, who spoke about the
mandolin. The speaker received a free coffee, while the other
attendees got a 40 percent discount on their drinks.
</P>
<P>
The university welcomes anyone to speak at the "Ecko" time,
saying that several NCKU professors have already registered to
speak.
