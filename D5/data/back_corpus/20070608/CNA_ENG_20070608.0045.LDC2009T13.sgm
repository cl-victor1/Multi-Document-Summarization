Taipei,  June 8 (CNA) 06/08/07  23:33:00 (By T.C. Jiang)

Premier Chang Chun-hsiung has urged local tea farmers and tea
companies not to be short-sighted by taking quality Taiwanese tea
seedlings and know-how to other countries, an act that he said
will be detrimental to the long-term development of Taiwan's tea
industry.
</P>
<P>
Chang made the appeal Thursday at a ceremony to award Taiwan's
top 10 best tea brands of this year.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the Council of Agriculture (COA) has been pushing
for certification of origin labels for Taiwanese tea products to
stem counterfeiting, an effort that he said deserves recognition.
</P>
<P>
In his capacity as chairman of the Straits Exchange Foundation
(SEF), Chang said that he collaborated with the COA and the
Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) in winning an administrative
lawsuit in China against Chinese firms which had registered four
origins of renowned Taiwanese tea leaves products as trademarks.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan is a world-famous tea producer, yielding 20,000 metric
tons of tea annually and generating a total output of NT$4.35
billion (US$131 million), Chang said.
</P>
<P>
Tea tasting has become an important tourism activity in Taiwan,
according to Chang, who added that Taiwanese tea has the
potential to be marketed around the world.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to the climate and tea-making techniques, several areas of
Taiwan have developed their own unique teas, Chang went on.
</P>
<P>
The government hopes to work with local tea farmers, tea
companies, and other sectors to raise the international profile
of Taiwanese tea.
