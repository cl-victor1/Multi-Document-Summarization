The Taiwan High Speed Rail Corp. (THSRC) will hold a grand
ceremony Oct. 24 to celebrate reaching full daily service
capacity, the company's top executive said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
THSRC Chairwoman Nita Ing said that currently trains are making
31 daily runs in each direction on the north-south high-speed
railway between Taipei and Kaohsiung, the country's two largest
cities.
</P>
<P>
Full utilization of the system's capacity will raise that total
to 88 commercial and maintenance daily train runs, she explained.
</P>
<P>
The number of daily trips in each direction on the high-speed
rail system is scheduled to increase to 41 or 42 per day in July,
Ing said, adding that the number will expand further to 61 in
September to meet the requirements set forth in the build-
operate-transfer (BOT) contract the company signed with the
Ministry of Transportation and Communications in the late 1990s.
The high-speed rail is the country's first infrastructure project
built under the BOT formula.
</P>
<P>
"Ultimately, we hope to expand the total number of daily train
runs in each direction to 88, " Ing said, adding that the company
will be able to break even when the number of daily runs reaches
60.
</P>
<P>
Ing said the company plans to invite 600 to 800 dignitaries from
home and abroad to attend the Oct. 24 ceremony, which is likely
to be held at high-speed rail station in either central or
southern Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
The grand ceremony is also designed to mark the 99th anniversary
of the inauguration of north-south train service in Taiwan, Ing
said.
</P>
<P>
The high-speed railway, which uses Japan's Shinkansen "Bullet
Train" core system, began commercial service Jan.5 this year.
Despite some early technical problems, it has become increasingly
popular among local travelers. On June 3, it welcomed the rail
system's 5 millionth passenger.
