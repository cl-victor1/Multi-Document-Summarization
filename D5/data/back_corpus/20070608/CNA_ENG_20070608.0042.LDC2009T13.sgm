Taipei, June 8 (CNA) 06/08/07  23:05:15 (By T.C. Jiang)
</P>
<P>
The world's largest passenger aircraft, the Airbus A380, landed
at Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport Friday where it will be
on display for three days as part of an Airbus company world
tour.
</P>
<P>
The press and local airline companies will be invited to take a
tour of the double-decker superjumbo, which is scheduled to leave
Taiwan June 10 and return to Airbus' headquarters in Toulouse,
France.
</P>
<P>
The jet can carry 525 passengers in a three-class configuration
or up to 853 passengers in a single-class economy configuration.
</P>
<P>
However, local airliners might not be interested in placing
orders for the A380 because of market concerns, airline sources
said.
</P>
<P>
The only possible route for the A380 in Taiwan would be Taipei-
Hong Kong, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the superjumbo's huge passenger capacity would decrease
the number of flights between the two places, which would be
inconvenient for travelers, the sources continued.
</P>
<P>
In addition, there might be changes in the Taipei-Hong Kong route
in the future, according to the sources, so that local carriers
still need to assess the future of the market.
</P>
<P>
Airbus has received 160 confirmed orders for the A380 from 14
carriers in Singapore, Thailand, China, France, Malaysia and
various other countries.
</P>
<P>
The French company will deliver the first superjumbo to Singapore
Airlines in October, two years behind schedule.
</P>
<P>
The delivery problem has caused quite a few carriers to switch to
Airbus' American rival, Boeing, for their orders.
