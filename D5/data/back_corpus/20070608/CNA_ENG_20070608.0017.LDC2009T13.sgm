Taipei,  June  8  (CNA) 06/08/07  17:17:24 (By Elizabeth Hsu)

Eleven six-grade students of Haituan Elementary School in the
southeastern county of Taitung bade farewell to their parents and
school juniors Friday, setting off for a journey of independence
-- the last lesson before their graduation.
</P>
<P>
The lesson is imparted over a 140-km-long, three-day bicycle trip
from the Haituan rural township to Liyutan -- a scenic attraction
in neighboring Hualien County in eastern Taiwan -- where the five
boys and six girls will be presented with their graduation
diplomas.
</P>
<P>
At around 9: 00 a.m., Wang Lai-kuei, the oldest oracle of the
Bunun tribe in Haituan, officiated over a tribal ceremony,
praying for blessings for the youths while holding the right hand
of each in the hope that they will have a happy journey and
return safely.
</P>
<P>
Haituan Elementary School Principal Lee Chih-kuo stressed that no
matter how foul the weather, the journey must continue because it
is a test for the tenacity and willpower.
</P>
<P>
It will be a chance for the students to learn independence, their
last lesson before graduation, Lee said.
</P>
<P>
The students, in the company of their class teacher and the
school principal, are to ride north along the Provincial Highway
No.9 for 60 km to the rural township of Jueisuei, Hualien, on the
first day of the trip. On the second day, they will ride another
70 km to Hualien City where they will spend the night.
</P>
<P>
On the final day, the brave youths will ride from downtown
Hualien to Liyutan, the terminal point of the challenging ride,
to collect their diplomas before heading home by bus.
</P>
<P>
Lee said that before departing for the bike tour, designed to
allow the students to know better their hometown and neighboring
lands, the boys and girls had all to undergo tough physical
training, which included jogging for a distance of 2 or 3 km
everyday.
</P>
<P>
One of the young cyclists, Yu Wen-lung, who stands less than 140
cm tall, rides a borrowed bike which is also the smallest in the
group. Nevertheless, Yu said without hesitation that he is
confident of riding through the challenge.
</P>
<P>
Yu's classmate Lee Cho, riding on a leased bike, also expressed
confidence in his own ability to finish the journey, for which he
has trained by making forth- and-back rides between Haituan to
Taitung City and Chipen, in Taitung county.
