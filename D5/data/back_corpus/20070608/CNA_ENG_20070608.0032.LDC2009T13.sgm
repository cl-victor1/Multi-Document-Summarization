DPP HEAD FIRM ON MAKING TAIWAN 'NORMAL COUNTRY'
</HEADLINE>

San Francisco,  June 7 (CNA) 06/08/07  21:13:56 (By S. H. Chou
and Flor Wang)

Ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) Chairman Yu Shyi-kun
asserted Thursday his resolve to make Taiwan a "normal country,"
describing it as the only way to ensure the country's continued
presence on the world stage.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a dinner party with DPP supporters in the San
Francisco Bay area, he said that "promoting a 'normal country'
resolution is the right thing to do and will help boost the
chances of the party's candidate in the 2008 presidential
election." Yu ascribed the problems that Taiwan faces at present
to its lack of status as a "normal country."
</P>
<P>
"Only by transforming Taiwan into a normal country can the nation
continue to survive, " Yu told more than 300 supporters attending
the banquet.
</P>
<P>
In response to suspicions that the DPP has shown signs of
division after the party's presidential primary in early May, Yu
disagreed and said that time will prove that the DPP can
withstand the test of time.
</P>
<P>
He urged DPP backers to return to Taiwan early next year and cast
their ballots for the party's candidates  in the presidential
election, and vowed to continue to promote the "normal country"
resolution for the sake of Taiwan's survival.
</P>
<P>
Yu first broached the idea that the DPP should adopt a resolution
on making Taiwan a "normal country" during his campaign prior to
the DPP's May 6 presidential primary, which he lost to Hsieh in a
direct vote by party members. He has repeatedly vowed to continue
promoting the resolution within the party despite his defeat in
the primary.
</P>
<P>
San Francisco is the first leg of Yu's ongoing overseas campaign
that will also take him to other U. S. cities, including Los
Angeles, Houston and New York.
