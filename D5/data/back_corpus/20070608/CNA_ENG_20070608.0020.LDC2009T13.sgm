San Jose,  Costa  Rica,  June 8 (CNA) 06/08/07  17:37:47 (By

<P>
The Panamanian government reaffirmed Thursday the country's
policy to maintain diplomatic relations with Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Panama made the move in the wake of the severing of diplomatic
ties between Costa Rica and Taiwan, a development that has
sparked concerns in Taipei about a possible domino effect
impacting Taiwan's diplomatic relations with other Central
American nations.
</P>
<P>
Panama's Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued a written statement
that the Panamanian government respects the decision of Costa
Rica President Oscar Arias to sever ties with Taiwan, but a
spokesman at Panama's presidential office affirmed that the
administration of President Martin Torrijos will continue to
maintain diplomatic ties with Taiwan while promoting trade
relations with China.
</P>
<P>
After maintaining formal ties with Taiwan for decades, Costa Rica
secretly signed a joint communique with China on the
establishment of diplomatic relations June 1 in Beijing. Arias
officially publicized the news Wednesday and announced his
country's decision to break off relations with Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
In the wake of Arias' announcement, Minister of Foreign Affairs
James Huang proclaimed in Taipei Thursday the government's
decision to terminate formal relations  with Costa Rica and cease
all cooperation projects between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
After breaking ties with Costa Rica, Taiwan now has 24 diplomatic
allies around the world, 12 of which are in Latin America and the
Caribbean region.
