TAIWAN HAS NOT ENGAGED IN CHECKBOOK DIPLOMACY: MOFA
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  June 8 (CNA) 06/08/07  15:47:33 (By Y.F. Low)

Recent criticism by Costa Rican President Oscar Arias about
Taiwan's foreign aid proves that Taiwan has not engaged in
checkbook diplomacy, a Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA)
official said Friday.
</P>
<P>
MOFA spokesman Wang Chien-yeh said it is regrettable  and
"ungentlemanly" of Arias to criticize Taiwan immediately after
his country severed diplomatic relations with Taiwan to forge
ties with China.
</P>
<P>
Reiterating  that Taiwan has never entered  any "financial
competition" with China in the international arena, Wang said
Arias' remarks indicate that Costa Rica has switched recognition
from Taipei to Beijing simply to obtain more aid from China.
</P>
<P>
According to an AFP report filed in San Jose, Arias told local
station Radio Monumental Thursday that Taiwan has provided too
little aid to its diplomatic allies.
</P>
<P>
"I have been critical of Taiwan in the sense that if they have
diplomatic relations with fewer than 30 countries, they should be
more generous," Arias was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
After maintaining formal ties with Taiwan for decades, Costa Rica
secretly signed a joint communique with China on the
establishment of diplomatic relations June 1 in Beijing. Arias
officially publicized the news Wednesday and announced his
country's decision to break relations with Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
In the wake of Arias' announcement, Minister of Foreign Affairs
James Huang proclaimed in Taipei Thursday the government's
decision to terminate formal relations  with Costa Rica and cease
all cooperation projects between the two countries.
