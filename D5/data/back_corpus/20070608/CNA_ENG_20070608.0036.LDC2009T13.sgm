Water supplies for the outlying island of Kinmen have been
assured for the coming year, thanks to the large amount of
rainfall of recent days, Kinmen water officials said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Heavy torrential rain that started Thursday evening brought large
amounts of water into local reservoirs, securing water supplies
for civilian use for the year ahead, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
Local reservoirs will take in more water if the rain continues,
causing Kinmen residents to breathe sighs of relief, as it was
feared until recently that several outlying islands, such as
Penghu and Kinmen, might be hit by a drought.
</P>
<P>
According to Kinmen weathermen, 58 mm of rain had fallen over the
past 24 hours. The present monsoon season fronts are expected to
linger until next Wednesday, with more rain forecast for the
coming days, they said, urging the public and farmers to stay on
high alert over flooding.
