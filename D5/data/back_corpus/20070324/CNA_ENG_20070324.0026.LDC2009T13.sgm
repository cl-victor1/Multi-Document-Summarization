3 DPP PRESIDENTIAL CONTENDERS NON-COMMITTAL ON 'FIVE NOES'
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  March  24 (CNA) 03/24/07  21:25:45 (By Sofia Wu)
</P>
<P>
All three participants in a televised debate Saturday for
hopefuls bidding to represent  the ruling Democratic Progressive
Party (DPP) in the 2008 presidential election were non-committal
to the now-famous "five noes" pledge.
</P>
<P>
During the debate,  the three DPP bigwigs --  Premier Su Tseng-
chang and two of his predecessors, Frank Hsieh and Yu Shyi-kun,
who is now DPP chairman, were asked about whether they would
reiterate the "five noes" pledge under U.S. pressure if elected
the next president.
</P>
<P>
The "five noes" pledge refers to President Chen Shui-bian's
declaration in his 2000 inaugural address that so long as China
has no intention to use force against Taiwan, he will not change
Taiwan's national title or national flag, not hold a referendum
on the "independence vs. unification" issue, not enshrine the
special "state-to-state" concept in the Constitution, and not
address the National Unification Council and the National
Unification Guidelines issue.
</P>
<P>
When asked about the "five noes" pledge in the debate, Su
responded by noting that President Chen had based his "five noes"
pledge on certain premises. Over the past seven years, Su said,
Taiwan's  "sovereign,  independent  state" status has remained
unchanged, and the country has continued with democratic reforms
while enhancing the sense of Taiwanese consciousness among its
people.
</P>
<P>
If elected, Su said he would continue to give priority to beefing
up Taiwan's distinct national identity and forging national
consensus on major reform issues.
</P>
<P>
Stressing that the DPP has accumulated sufficient governing
experience over the past seven years, he said the DPP
administration can now manage pressure from the United States and
from China fairly well.
</P>
<P>
"So if I'm elected president, I would be able to withstand any
pressure and refrain from making any promises. I would give top
priority to respecting mainstream public opinion, and our
independent and sovereign status would never be compromise," he
stressed.
</P>
<P>
For his part, Yu said that Taiwan's future cannot be subject to
any restrictions and that the Taiwan people's rights to determine
their country's destiny cannot be sacrificed.
</P>
<P>
Against this backdrop, Yu said categorically that he would not
promise the United States any of the "five noes."
</P>
<P>
Hsieh echoed his rivals' views, saying that he had never made any
promise about the "five noes" pledge during his previous visits
to the United States.
</P>
<P>
"And the scenario of me reiterating the 'five noes' pledge would
not be likely to happen in the future," he added.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Hsieh acknowledged the importance of integrity and
sincerity in engagement with other countries. He said that if
elected, he would give priority to sincere communciations with
the United States and refrain from doing anything that would
damage mutual trust and good faith.
</P>
<P>
"While considering our partners' interests, we also cannot afford
to compromise our national sovereignty," he added.
