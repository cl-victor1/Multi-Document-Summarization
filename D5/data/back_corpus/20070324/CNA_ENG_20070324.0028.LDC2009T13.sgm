ROC UNDERGOING 'TAIWANIZATION': FORMER PREMIER HSIEH
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taipei,  March 24 (CNA) 03/24/07  21:59:05 (By Elizabeth Hsu)
</P>
<P>
Former Premier Frank Hsieh said Saturday that he thinks the
Republic of China on Taiwan is currently undergoing a process of
"Taiwanization" as more and more people on the island begin to
identify themselves as "Taiwanese" rather than as "Chinese."
</P>
<P>
Hsieh made the remarks during a televised debate organized by the
pro- independence Taiwan Society for the aspirants running in the
the ruling Democratic Progress Party's (DPP's) primary for the
2008 presidential election.
</P>
<P>
The two other participants in the debate were DPP Chairman Yu
Shyi-kun and incumbent Premier Su Tseng-chang. The other aspirant
for the DPP's nomination, Vice President Annette Lu, did not take
part in the debate.
</P>
<P>
In explaining  his past argument  that  "Taiwan's  current
Constitution is based on the 'one China' concept in which 'one
China' refers to the Republic of China, " which has drawn
criticism from the pro-independence "pan-green camp" headed by
the DPP, Hsieh said he had proposed at the Legislative Yuan March
9, 2005, in his capacity as premier the wiping away of the "one
China" concept through constitutional reform.
</P>
<P>
Hsieh said that the reason he still stands behind the concept is
that he believes it is not possible for the DPP government to
eliminate the "one China" concept from the existing ROC
Constitution without having the support of most of the people on
the island as there are currently still many who identify
themselves as Chinese and look forward to unification with the
mainland. He suggested that the DPP address the issue when most
of the people on the island have come to identify themselves as
Taiwanese.
</P>
<P>
When most of the people have a sense of Taiwan consciousness, it
will be easy for the government to reform the Constitution or
draft a new one to rename the country "Taiwan" and define its
territory as covering Taiwan proper and several outlying islands,
including Penghu, Kinmen and Matsu.
</P>
<P>
Under the current Constitution, the territory of the Republic of
China is defined as including all of mainland China as well as
outer Mongolia.
</P>
<P>
Hsieh said that "Taiwanization" represents progress and that a
Taiwan-centered consciousness is forming among the people of the
country.
