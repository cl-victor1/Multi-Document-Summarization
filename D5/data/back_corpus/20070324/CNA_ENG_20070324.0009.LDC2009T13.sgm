</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  March  24 (CNA) 03/24/07  13:22:36 (By Sofia Wu)

The Ministry of Education (MOE) said Saturday it will commend
Chou Chun-hsun, winner of the world go championship held recently
in South Korea, in recognition of his career achievements and
persevering spirit.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Education Tu Cheng-sheng announced the commendation
plan after Chou, 27, emerged victorious from the final match of
the 11th LG Cup Go Championship in Seoul Thursday,  becoming the
first-ever  go player  representing  Taiwan  to win the world
championship.
</P>
<P>
The victory is just one of a series of firsts by Chou, who was
also the first Taiwan-nurtured go player to rise to the
professional game's top tier -- ninth dan or level nine.
</P>
<P>
Tu said Chou deserves public commendation not just for his
professional brilliance but also for his patience and mental
fortitude shown in his quest for career success.
</P>
<P>
In his elementary  school years,  Chou had to endure his
classmates' mockery because of a large scarlet birthmark that
covers half of his face. Chou has learned to find comfort in
playing go and to ignore comments about his "facial defect" while
cultivating a habitual concentration and precocious calm, which
have become his valuable personal assets in the highly
competitive game of go.
</P>
<P>
Chou's life story has been written into an elementary school
textbook. Tu said he looks forward to seeing more similar stories
based on contemporary Taiwan citizens striving to reach the
pinnacle in their chosen fields compiled into primary and junior
high school textbooks.
</P>
<P>
Noting that Chou had suffered many setbacks and encountered many
difficulties during his school years due to his pursuit of a go
career, Tu said the education ministry needs to overhaul and
expand the existing special education system to benefit more
young people with special gifts or talents.
</P>
<P>
According to Tu, the country's current special education can be
divided into two categories -- courses for gifted elementary
school or junior high school students, and programs for the
mentally or physically challenged.
</P>
<P>
On the education programs for gifted children, Tu said the
government has done more in helping those with musical and
athletic talent go abroad for advanced training. In contrast, he
conceded that the ministry has not done enough to help those with
special gifts in painting and playing go, better known as "wei-
chi" in Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Tu said he has instructed the MOE's special education planning
task force to design special elementary and junior high school
curriculums catering to the needs of those with special talents
in various fields.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Chou is scheduled to return home from Seoul Saturday
evening after receiving  the trophy for winning the go world
championship and 250 million Korean won (US$266,421; NT$8.83
million) in prize money in an award-presentation ceremony held in
the South Korean capital Friday.
</P>
<P>
Chou said during the presentation ceremony that he plans to use
part of his prize money to organize an amateur go tournament in
Taipei to help upgrade the country's level in this intellectually
challenging board game.
</P>
<P>
Chou defeated  his Chinese  opponent  Hu Yaoyu  2-1 in a best-of-
three final to claim the LG Cup title and a place in Taiwan's go
history.
</P>
<P>
Unlike other talented Taiwanese go players who have moved abroad
to play tougher competition in Japan, Chou has stayed in Taiwan
and represented his country in major international competitions.
