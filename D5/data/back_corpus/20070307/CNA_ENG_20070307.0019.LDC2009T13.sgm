Taipei,   March  7  (CNA) 03/07/07  16:19:58 (By Luis Huang)

<P>
Intangible  capital investment has substantially contributed to
Taiwan's economic growth over the past 10 years, with its
contribution rate breaking the 10 percent mark, an official with
the Cabinet-level Council for Economic Planning and Development
(CEPD) said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
According to official statistics, the contribution rate of
intangible capital to the nation's economic growth increased from
the annual average of 9.62 percent for the 1982-1993 period to
10.84 percent for the 1994-2005 period.
</P>
<P>
Describing  investment  as  a vital  stimulus  to economic
development, the official said that although domestic investment
by entrepreneurs accounted for less than 20 percent of the gross
domestic product over the past three years, their investment
structure saw a continued improvement.
</P>
<P>
The official  further  said that the pattern  of domestic
businesspeople's investment has obviously changed, from investing
in machinery equipment to intangible fixed assets, which the
official claimed will favor transformation of the domestic
economy into a knowledge-based one.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics released by the Directorate General of
Budget, Accounting and Statistics, the gross domestic fixed
capital formation (GFCF) posted a real growth rate of only 0.26
percent in 2006, but investment in intangible fixed assets
(including software and mining) grew rapidly, with the real
growth rate hitting 5.81 percent, higher than the 3.02 percent
for machinery equipment and 3.44 percent for construction.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the average real growth rate for Taiwan's intangible
fixed assets investment during the 2001-2006 period stood at 8.53
percent, or 2.55 times the economic growth rate for the same
period, according to the tallies.
