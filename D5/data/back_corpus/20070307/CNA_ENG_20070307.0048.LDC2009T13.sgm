Around 71 percent of the wage earners in Taiwan attached more
importance to their supervisors' abilities than their gender,
according to the results of an online poll released Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The poll, conducted by the 1111 Job Bank, came one day before the
International Women's Day.
</P>
<P>
The results marked an attitude change in the male-dominant
workplace, said Ryan Wu, a spokesman for the online job bank. In
the future, men and women will be able to compete for jobs on an
equal footing since one's capability will be considered the top
priority, he predicted.

<P>
Meanwhile, three Taiwanese women were voted ideal supervisors --
Amy Su, fashion director of the shopping mall Breeze Center,
Taipei 101 Chairwoman  Diana Chen, and Taiwan High Speed Rail
Corp Chairperson Nita Ing, the poll shows.

Asked about the benefits of having a female supervisor, 38.01
percent of the respondents said that a female supervisor is more
considerate, 29.82 percent said a female supervisor tends to have
a better rapport with clients, while 29.24 noted that it is
easier to communicate with a female supervisor.
</P>
<P>
As for the cons, 66.08 percent think that female supervisors tend
to be emotional, 38.89 percent said female supervisors tends to
be narrow-minded, and 33.04 percent believed that female
supervisors tend to take trivial things seriously.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the job bank quoted a recent survey from an
international financial paper by saying that among the CEOs of
the world's top 500 enterprises, only seven of them are women,
producing a ratio of 70 to 1.
</P>
<P>
The ratio between Taiwan's male and female lawmakers this year is
4 to 1, the spokesman further said, adding that the ratio between
Taiwan's male and female college presidents is 13 to 1 for the
2006-2007 school year.

<P>
The Council of Labor Affairs (CLA) has been promoting the Gender
Equality in Employment Law for five years, the spokesman said.
Over the years, the number of female employed workers has risen
10.1 percent from 3.9 million to 4.3 million.
</P>
<P>
The rate of increase is higher than the 4.74 percent of male
employed workers, according to the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
The poll was conducted Feb. 20 - March 6, with a margin of error
of plus or minus 2.6 percentage points. A total of 1,368 valid
samples were collected.
