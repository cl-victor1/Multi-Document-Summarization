TIES

Taipei,  March 7 (CNA) 03/07/07  20:27:01 (By Luis Huang)

Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) Chairman Chang Chun-hsiung
voiced hope Wednesday that a recent visit by an official with the
quasi-official intermediary organization would help boost future
interactions between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a tea party to mark SEF's 16th founding anniversary,
Chang said Sun Chi-ming, director of the SEF's Department of
Travel Services, returned from a five-day visit to China a day
earlier. Sun visited China March 1-5 in his capacity as advisor
to a delegation organized by the Travel Quality Assurance
Association (TQAA) to attend a meeting of cross-strait travel
agents held in Zhengdu, Sichuan Province, Chang said.
</P>
<P>
Secretary-General You Yin-lung set up a task force to make
required arrangements for Sun's China trip, Chang said, adding
that Sun kept close contacts with the task force during his stay
in China.
</P>
<P>
Chang further said that Sun presented a report on his China visit
following his return to Taiwan, and the task force will continue
to deal with various subsequently arising issues.
</P>
<P>
Calling Sun's China trip a gesture of cross-strait goodwill and a
good beginning for stepping up bilateral exchanges, Chang noted
that SEF will work hard to promote its services  and cross-strait
interaction based upon the existing foundation.
</P>
<P>
Asked whether he is also planning to visit China in the future,
Chang said he is willing to do anything that will contribute to a
positive development in cross- strait relations.
</P>
<P>
For his part, You said while in China, Sun met with officials of
the National Tourism Administration and the Taiwan Affairs Office
to exchange views on issues of mutual concern.
</P>
<P>
According to You, Chinese officials expressed gratitude to the
SEF for its long- term assistance to the Chinese authorities in
handling various emergency cases.
</P>
<P>
Sun's China trip was the first time that Beijing had allowed a
SEF official to visit China after 1999.
</P>
<P>
You also clarified that although Sun's trip to China coincided
with a Taiwan visit by He Shizhong, director of the Economic
Bureau under the Taiwan Affairs Office of the State Council,
there was no relationship between their visits, which he stressed
by no means were a reciprocal "trade" or otherwise based upon any
previous agreement.
</P>
<P>
The Beijing authorities  have been reluctant to allow SEF
officials to visit China over the past eight years. Taiwan
allowed China's quasi-official Association for Relations Across
the Taiwan Strait (ARATS) Vice Chairman Sun Yafu and Secretary-
General Li Yafei to pay tribute to the late SEF Chairman Koo
Chen-fu, who died Jan. 3, 2005, however, China refused a visit by
Chang to render tribute to the late ARATS Chairman, Wang Daohan
who died in December 2005.
