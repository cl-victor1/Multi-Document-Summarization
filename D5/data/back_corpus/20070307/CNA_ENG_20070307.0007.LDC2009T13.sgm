VICE PRESIDENT DEMANDS CNN APOLOGIZE OVER INSULTING HEADLINE
</HEADLINE>

Taipei, March 7 (CNA) 03/07/07  12:50:59 (By Sofia Wu)
</P>
<P>
Vice President Annette Lu has demanded that U.S.-based Cable News
Network (CNN) apologize for an insulting headline in its Tuesday
online edition in which she was referred to as the "scum" of
Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Lu said in a protest letter dated March 6 that she was caught off
guard when she read the article headlined: "Taiwan's 'scum of the
nation' runs for president."
</P>
<P>
The article was an AP dispatch from Taipei concerning Lu's
announcement of her presidential bid early on Tuesday. Shortly
after her announcement,  Lu registered her candidacy for the
ruling Democratic Progressive Party's primary for the 2008
presidential election.
</P>
<P>
"I'm stunned by the CNN online edition's rude and disrespectful
headline," Lu said in her letter written in the name of the
Office of the Vice President.
</P>
<P>
Such a headline is not only an extreme affront to a two-term
popularly elected vice president but also to the Taiwan people's
dignity, Lu said, adding that the headline obviously violates
CNN's basic news coverage principles and ethics.
</P>
<P>
Even though CNN rectified its headline in its subsequent reports,
its original headline was widely quoted by local media,  Lu
complained, adding that as of Tuesday evening, popular Internet
portals, such as Google, had not yet made any correction.
</P>
<P>
In this era of borderless, real time news coverage, Lu said, it's
utterly regrettable  that the authoritative  CNN used such a
contemptuous headline to refer to Taiwan's popularly elected vice
president.
</P>
<P>
Lu said she hopes that CNN can issue a public apology to her and
the people of Taiwan and adopt appropriate remedy measures, such
as giving her a complete interview. She added that she will not
rule out the possibility of taking legal action against CNN to
uphold Taiwan's dignity.
</P>
<P>
Government Information Office (GIO) Minister Cheng Wen-tsang said
the GIO's representative office in Atlanta will relay Lu's
protest letter to the CNN headquarters.
</P>
<P>
The AP article appearing at CNN.com said Lu, 62, has been a
favorite target for China's state-run media, which have labeled
her an "insane" splittist and the "scum of the nation." Lu has
shrugged off the criticism, calling it "silly" and saying it only
helps draw more global attention and sympathy to her causes, the
report added.
</P>
<P>
Noting that Lu has repeatedly angered Beijing with her support
for Taiwan independence, the AP report claimed that Taiwan's
tensions with China would likely rise if she were elected.
</P>
<P>
The Harvard-educated Lu has been a democracy and rights activist.
She was jailed in 1979 and served five-and-a-half years when
Taiwan was under martial law. Lu offended the island's then-
authoritarian rulers by giving a 20-minute speech at a human
rights rally that turned into a riot, leading to the
incarceration of most democracy movement leaders at the time.
</P>
<P>
As vice president, Lu has organized international conferences and
has floated her own ideas, such as how Asian nations should
create their own version of NATO. She is also a big believer in
"soft power" in diplomacy and believes Taiwan should use
"democracy, peace, love and high technology" in engaging with the
world.
</P>
<P>
On her presidential bid, Lu said she needs a higher position to
promote her ultimate goal of making Taiwan "a normal and complete
country."
