Taipei, March 7 (CNA) 03/07/07  19:52:19 (By Flor Wang)
</P>
<P>
Taipei Mayor Hau Lung-bin was filmed at the main gate of the
Chiang Kai-shek (CKS) Memorial Hall complex in downtown Taipei
Wednesday as part of his efforts to sell the city to the rest of
the world via the Discovery channel.
</P>
<P>
Hau, who took over as mayor from his predecessor Ma Ying-jeou
last December, was filmed for a short promotion film for the
Discovery Travel and Living channel, whose Lonely Planet Six
Degrees program is slated to introduce Taipei to some 130 million
household viewers on its premiere episode March 31.
</P>
<P>
According to Hau, Taipei is a pluralistic blend of traditional
cultures and a vanguard of the arts. The city's impressive trade
and economic development has also made it "an eye-catching star
on the world stage" in recent years, he added.
</P>
<P>
Hau expressed hope that the film will help viewers explore the
beauty and multiple facets of Taipei, which is Taiwan's largest
city.
</P>
<P>
The shooting of the film came at a sensitive time, as the CKS
Memorial Hall -- one of Taipei's major attractions -- is set to
undergo drastic changes since its inauguration nearly 30 years
ago.
</P>
<P>
Despite opposition from the Taipei city government, the central
government insists that the CKS Memorial Hall's shady verandas
and covered walkways which serve as the area's walls must be
pulled down supposedly "to remove the lingering remnants of the
late president's memory from Taiwan, " under the instructions of
President Chen Shui-bian.
</P>
<P>
In the film that will be aired March 31, host and traveler Asha
Gill, accompanied by Ma, will take an aerial look at the greater
Taipei area from a helicopter. Old neighborhoods around Dihwa
Street and Treasure Hill, as well as Taipei street life, will be
presented to audiences around the world.
