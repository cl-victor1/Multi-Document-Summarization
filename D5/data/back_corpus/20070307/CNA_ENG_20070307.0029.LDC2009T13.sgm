International buyers from 22 countries, including Japan, the
United States and Germany, are expected to be big spenders at an
international orchid show in southern Taiwan later this month,
Tainan Magistrate Su Huan-chi said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Su made the remarks at a news conference to promote the 2007
Taiwan International Orchid Show, which will be held March 10-18
in Hobi, Tainan County.
</P>
<P>
Su noted that Taiwan orchids are world renowned, with around 50
percent of the orchids sold around the world coming from Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
The Council of Agriculture (COA) has listed orchids as the
flagship product of Taiwan's agricultural exports, with the
production value of orchid exports climbing every year.
</P>
<P>
The Taiwan Orchid Grower Association said the production value of
butterfly orchids registered an annual increase of 43 percent
last year, while slipper orchids also enjoyed growth of 30
percent.
</P>
<P>
Su noted that the orchid show received orders of NT$800 million
(US$24.24 million) in 2005 and NT$1.3 billion in 2006 and
predicted that orders will break NT$2 billion this year.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the biggest challenge facing Taiwan's agriculture is
international marketing, he said the establishment of a biotech
orchid park in Tainan County, as well as the holding of the
orchid show, are aimed at solving this problem.
</P>
<P>
The Taiwan External Trade Development Council (TAITRA), which is
joining the Tainan county government in sponsoring the show for
the first time, has assisted international marketing by inviting
more international buyers to attend the show.
</P>
<P>
Yeh Ming-shui, TAITRA deputy secretary-general, noted that
Taiwan's orchid industry in the global orchid supply chain is
like the country's semiconductor sector in the global electronics
industry, and that it enjoys a competitive edge in propagation,
as well as in research and development.
</P>
<P>
TAITRA will help orchid growers promote their own brands and
conduct efficient marketing, Yeh said.
