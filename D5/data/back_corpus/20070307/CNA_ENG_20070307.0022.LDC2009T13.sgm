KMT RECOMMENDS 8 CANDIDATES FOR CONTROL YUAN SEATS
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  March  7 (CNA) 03/07/07  16:47:16 (By Sofia Wu)
</P>
<P>
The main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) finally came up with an
eight-member recommendation list for the long vacant Control Yuan
seats Wednesday, which will be referred to the Presidential
Office soon for reference.
</P>
<P>
The country's supreme watchdog body has not been operating since
Jan. 31, 2005 when the term of the previous Control Yuan members
expired. Due to the opposition-controlled Legislative Yuan's
refusal to endorse President Chen Shui- bian's nominees, the
Control Yuan seats have remained unfilled for the past two years.
</P>
<P>
President Chen agreed late last year to redraw the list of
nominees for the watchdog body and invited various political
parties to recommend qualified candidates.
</P>
<P>
In response to Chen's call, the KMT formed a six-member special
task force to screen more than 130 individuals recommended by
various professional and social groups for the Control Yuan
seats.
</P>
<P>
After extensive discussions, the KMT task force finalized its
recommendation list through a series of votes Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The list is comprised of eight candidates in proportion to the
number of seats the KMT controls in the legislature now. The list
was originally led by Lung Ying-tai, a noted essayist and
cultural critic who once headed the Taipei City government's
cultural affairs department.
</P>
<P>
However, Lung politely rejected the KMT's invitation, saying in a
press release that her most important social duty at the moment
is to maintain her role as an independent, non-biased essayist to
help keep Taiwan from moving toward radicalism or extremism.
</P>
<P>
The KMT task force then decided to name former Control Yuan
member Chao Chang- ping as Lung's replacement.
</P>
<P>
The seven other KMT-recommended hopefuls are Nan Fang-shou, a
celebrated political commentator and cultural critic; Ke Yung-
kuang, a National Taiwan University professor; Ma Hsiu-ju, a
National Chengchi University professor; former Taipei City
Councilor Lin Shu-chi; and three other former Control Yuan
members, Yeh Yao-peng, Ko Ming-mo and Lin Shih-chi.
</P>
<P>
The KMT's decision-making Central Standing Committee endorsed the
recommendation list at its weekly meeting Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
More than 24,000 cases had piled up at the office of the Control
Yuan as of the end of January pending investigations and
settlement by the Control Yuan, according to watchdog body's
administrative staff.
</P>
<P>
They said the 40,000-plus cases were filed between February 2005
and January 2007, including petitions from ordinary citizens,
public functionaries'  assets disclosure reports,  and cases
involving conflict of interests and political contributions.
</P>
<P>
Some of the cases have been addressed in accordance with a
package of expedient measures approved by former Control Yuan
President Fredrick Chien, but more than 24,000 cases remain in
backlog because they can only be investigated and tackled by
Control Yuan members.
