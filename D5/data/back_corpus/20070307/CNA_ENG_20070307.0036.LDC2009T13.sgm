Premier Su Tseng-chang awarded the Grade One Medal of Merit
Wednesday to former Taiwan Post Co. Chairman Lai Ching-chi in
recognition of his achievement in the mission to change the
company's name from Chunghwa Post Co.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the award ceremony, Su said Lai had devoted himself
to planning  the name-change  as part  of the  government's
"name-rectification" policy and that he successfully achieved the
mission after six months of effort.
</P>
<P>
Lai also worked hard to promote the postal business after taking
over the chairmanship nine months ago,  Su said, adding that
signboards of all post offices around the country have been
replaced smoothly, with no customers revoking their accounts due
to the name-change.
</P>
<P>
The premier further said that since Lai was firm in his decision
to resign after accomplishing his mission, he could not but allow
Lai to leave his job.
</P>
<P>
Lai presented his resignation Feb. 28 and it was immediately
approved by Minister of Transportation and Communications Tsai
Duei. Vice Minister of Transportation and Communications Ho Nuan-
hsuan concurrently serves as acting chairman of the state-owned
company.
