Taipei,  March 7 (CNA) 03/07/07  21:43:32 (By Flor Wang)

Former main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Ma Ying-jeou
said Wednesday that if nominated by the KMT to run in the 2008
presidential election, he will first enquire about Legislative
Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng's willingness to serve as his running
mate.
</P>
<P>
In a press release issued after a weekly meeting of the KMT's
decision-making Central Standing Committee (CSC), Ma stated that,
in line with the party's mechanism and for the sake of party
unity, he agreed to first ask Wang to serve as his vice
presidential running mate should he become the party's nominee to
contest for the next presidency.
</P>
<P>
However, Ma said that in accordance with the KMT's procedural
mechanisms, the party has to first produce a presidential
candidate and that the candidate will be entitled to choose a
running mate.
</P>
<P>
Ma issued the press release in response to the remarks made by
KMT acting Chairman Wu Po-hsiung in the CSC meeting that the
former KMT chief had agreed to pair up with Wang in compliance
with the party's mechanism if he is chosen by the KMT as its
presidential candidate.
</P>
<P>
Earlier the same day, Wang also pledged that if nominated by the
KMT, he will invite his chief rival, in a reference to Ma, to
form a presidential ticket to run in the 2008 presidential
election.
</P>
<P>
Wang made the promise while answering questions from reporters
following a meeting with Wu prior to the CSC meeting. Wu had
called for the two key contenders in the party primary to team up
to avoid a split, irrespective of whether Wang or Ma wins the
primary.
</P>
<P>
Echoing Wu's call for party unity to secure its chances of
victory in the next presidential race, Wang said that he is
willing to invite Ma to serve as his vice presidential running
mate if he wins the KMT nomination.
</P>
<P>
KMT spokesman Su Chun-pin said after the weekly CSC meeting that
day that Wu's efforts to push Wang and Ma to form a presidential
ticket have gained positive responses from the two men.
</P>
<P>
According to Su, it was agreed during the Wu-Wang meeting that
whether Ma or Wang wins the primary, the successful nominee will
ask the other to pair up on a KMT presidential ticket.
</P>
<P>
As Wu's proposal has won endorsement from both Wang and Ma, Wu
will call a news conference later to provide the public with a
clear explanation of the issue, Su said.
