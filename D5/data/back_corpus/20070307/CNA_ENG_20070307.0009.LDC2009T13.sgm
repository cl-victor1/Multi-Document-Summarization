TAIPEI CITY GOV'T ADOPTING DOUBLE STANDARDS ON CKS HALL: DPP
LAWMAKER
</HEADLINE>

Taipei, March 7 (CNA) 03/07/07  13:22:23 (By Deborah Kuo)

A ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) legislator lashed out
at the Taipei City government Wednesday for adopting double
standards in attempting to protect the Chiang Kai-shek (CKS)
Memorial Hall.
</P>
<P>
At a news conference she called at the Legislative Yuan, DPP
Legislator Lin Shu- fen said that in order to block the
demolition of the wall surrounding the CKS Memorial Hall -- as
decided by the Cabinet last Friday when it announced that the
hall will be renamed "Taiwan Democracy Memorial Hall" -- the
Taipei City government has demonstrated a "double standards
mentality" in terms of historical sites protection.
</P>
<P>
Lin said the Taipei City Department of Cultural Affairs scrambled
Tuesday to have the CKS Memorial Hall temporarily declared a
heritage site in an attempt to protect the hall's outer wall from
being torn down.
</P>
<P>
Department Director Lee Yung-ping said Tuesday that at the
request of several residents and historians, the department has
begun a review of the memorial's historical and cultural
significance in accordance with the Cultural Heritage
Preservation Law. As the review process has begun, Lee said, the
hall has been temporarily designated a heritage site and
therefore cannot be altered.
</P>
<P>
Lin claimed that the Taipei City government has demonstrated
double standards by moving to protect the outer wall of the CKS
Memorial Hall, which is only 27 years old, while planning to tear
down the wall around the Confucius Temple, which is nearly 200
years old. The plan dates back to the stint of former Mayor Ma
Ying-jeou.
</P>
<P>
Ma had agreed that the wall around the Confucius Temple, located
in Talungtung on Taipei's west side, should be torn down "to make
it more approachable for the public," according to Lin.
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, Taipei Mayor Hau Lung-bin said that the plan to tear
down the wall requires the approval of the city government.
