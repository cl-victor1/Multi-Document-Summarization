7.5-9.5% MINIMUM WAGE HIKE EXCEEDS `ACCEPTABLE RANGE': MOEA
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  April 28 (CNA) 04/28/07  13:06:12 (By Sofia Wu)

<P>
The minimum monthly wage adjustment range recommended by a wage
review committee goes beyond the level acceptable to bosses,
Economics Minister Steve R.L. Chen said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Chen made the remarks after the wage review panel under the
Cabinet-level Council of Labor Affairs (CLA) recommended the day
before that the minimum monthly wage be raised by 7.5 percent to
9.5 percent, pending final approval by the Executive Yuan.
</P>
<P>
Chen said the Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) has been in
close contact with major industrial and business associations and
senior business executives in the past few weeks in the hope of
winning their support for a hike in the minimum wage.
</P>
<P>
"After difficult negotiations, they have finally agreed to a
maximum 5 percent hike. Perhaps, a 6 percent hike is a barely
tolerable ceiling. The recommended figures go far beyond the
range bosses are willing to pay," Chen said.
</P>
<P>
Noting  that  franchised  stores,  small-  and medium-sized
enterprises (SMEs) and micro-businesses are usually most
vulnerable to a minimum wage hike, Chen said the ministry will
step up communications with various business associations to seek
their support.
</P>
<P>
Moreover,  Chen said, the ministry will flesh out various
complementary packages of measures to help the industrial and
business community weather challenges that may arise from the
impending wage hikes.
</P>
<P>
Among the measures in contemplation are offering soft loans
through the SME Development Fund as well as organizing on-the-job
manpower  training  programs to help small-  and medium-sized
enterprises upgrade productivity and competitiveness, Chen said.
</P>
<P>
CLA Chairman Lee Ying-yuan chaired a meeting of the wage review
committee Friday to discuss the issue.
</P>
<P>
Lee said the 22 members  on the panel --  comprised  of
representatives from employers' associations, labor unions,
academics and government officials -- came to a compromise after
more than three hours of heated debate and intensive
consultations.
</P>
<P>
While labor groups sought a steep 20 percent hike in the minimum
monthly wage in light of soaring living costs and a 10-year
freeze of the minimum wage level, employer representatives
attempted to limit the rise to between 5 percent and 6 percent.
</P>
<P>
Lee said that the conference goers settled the proposed hike at a
range between 7.5 percent and 9.5 percent after using the 7.5
percent increase in the consumer price index over the past
decade.
</P>
<P>
An estimated 1.7 million low-wage workers are expected to benefit
from the adjustment, Lee said.
</P>
<P>
At Friday's meeting, the panel also decided to change the formula
for calculating wages for part-time workers whose average wage
per hour will rise to between NT$93 and NT$95 from the current
NT$66.
</P>
<P>
Lee said the CLA will submit the package to the Cabinet for a
final review. "We are hopeful that the wage hike can be
implemented from July 1," he added.
