The 15-member delegation, led by Hisaoki Kamei, secretary-general
of the Japanese People's New Party, will depart for Taipei May

It will be the first time members of both the Japanese House of
Representatives and House of Councillors  will have formed a
delegation to congratulate Taiwan since the high-speed railway
began full operations in early March.

The system, which uses electrical machinery equipment and coaches
from the Shinkansen system, has received much attention in Japan.

Political observers said the delegation's visit is expected to
elevate further the profile of the 345-km railway in Japan.
