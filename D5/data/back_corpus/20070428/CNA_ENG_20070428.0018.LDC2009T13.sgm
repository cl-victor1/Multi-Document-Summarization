GOV'T WILL NOT INTERFERE IN CIVIC CROSS-STRAIT EXCHANGES: MAC
</HEADLINE>

Taipei, April 28 (CNA) 04/28/07  16:38:47 (By Elizabeth Hsu)

The government will not interfere in civic exchanges between the
two sides of the Taiwan Strait, but insists that such exchanges
be conducted under the law and that issues involving public
rights and power be dealt with by the government, Mainland
Affairs Council (MAC) Vice Chairman Tung Chen-yuan said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Tung made the declaration at a Taiwan Thinktank conference while
talking about a high-profile Beijing forum hosted by the
opposition Kuomintang (KMT) and the Communist Party of China
(CPC).
</P>
<P>
The two-day cross-strait economic, trading and cultural forum
opened earlier in the day in Beijing, with KMT honorary Chairman
Lien Chan and CPC General Secretary Hu Jintao attending the
opening ceremony. It is the third forum of its kind since they
began in 2005.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the event, Tung said the conclusions from the forum
will still serve as nothing but a channel of propaganda for the
KMT and CPC, as the forum will have no direct dialogue between
government officials.
</P>
<P>
However, he also said Beijing often takes advantage of the
forum's informal conclusions in an attempt to sow dissent in
Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Expressing hope that Beijing will stop disturbing Taiwan's
politics and delaying real cross-strait talks, Tung said there
are several issues on which authorized talks are currently taking
place. The two sides could reach agreement on the issues
eventually if they continue negotiations, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Tung also reiterated the government's determination to maintain
the status quo in the Taiwan Strait and Taiwan's democratic
system, as well as the hopes of the Taiwan people for cross-
strait peace.
