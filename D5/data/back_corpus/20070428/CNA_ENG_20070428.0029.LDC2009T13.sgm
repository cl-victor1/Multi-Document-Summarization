A memorial monument was unveiled by the Taipei municipal
government at the city's Sports Park Saturday to commemorate
foreign workers who died on the job.

<P>
Addressing the unveiling ceremony, Taipei Mayor Hau Lung-bin said
many of the city's landmark buildings  and public facilities,
including Taipei 101 Tower and the Metro mass rapid transit
system, were completed with the assistance of many foreign
laborers.
</P>
<P>
"Without their contributions, Taipei could not have developed its
modern urban style so quickly. Over the years, their sweat and
labor have helped enhance our city's beauty, grandeur, breadth
and depth," Hau said emotionally, adding that the city government
has built the monument to express its gratitude for all foreign
workers who have sacrificed their lives in their work for
Taiwan's progress.

The monument, dedicated to commemorate all foreign workers who
died from workplace accidents since 1991, is engraved with
grateful words in many Asian languages that read: "These
venerable workers dedicate their precious lives. They will be
remembered by all city dwellers forever."

<P>
The city government invited Buddhist monks from Thailand to
perform religious rituals and an Indonesian choir from the Bread
of Life Christian Church to sing hymns in praise of the God and
pray for the souls of all deceased foreign workers at the
ceremony.
</P>
<P>
The heads of representative offices of the Philippines, Thailand,
Indonesia and Vietnam were also invited to attend the monument
unveiling ceremony. They joined Hau and other city government
officials in laying wreaths at the memorial monument.

<P>
According to Hau, Taipei now have more than 36,000 foreign
workers, most of whom work as caregivers or family helpers. Only
a small portion of them work in the manufacturing and
construction sectors, with Thais accounting for the largest ratio
of these two categories of foreign workers.
</P>
<P>
A total of 26 foreign workers have died from workplace accidents
in Taipei City since 1991, city officials said, adding that the
city government will step up workplace security inspection,
education and publicity in order to minimize workplace deaths and
injuries.
