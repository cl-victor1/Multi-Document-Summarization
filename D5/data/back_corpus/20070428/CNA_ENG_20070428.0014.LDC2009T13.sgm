A recommended minimum monthly wage hike of 7.5 percent to 9.5
percent goes beyond the level acceptable to bosses, the National
Association of Small and Medium Enterprises said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Association President Lin Ping-pin made the remarks one day after
the Council of Labor Affairs (CLA) convened a wage review
committee to decide the level of adjustment, which will be sent
to the Executive Yuan for approval. CLA Chairman Lee Ying-yuan
noted that since the consumer price index has risen by 7.5
percent over the past decade and the minimum monthly wage has not
increased at all in the same period, the hike should be at least
7.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
Lin said the increase is higher that the maximum level of 5
percent acceptable to bosses.
</P>
<P>
Lin argued that while the consumer price index has "only" risen
by 7.5 percent, the shortened working hours and a new labor
pension system that was put into practice last July have incurred
a 30 percent increase in expenses for employers.
</P>
<P>
He claimed that many small- and medium-sized enterprises will
have to close if there is a 7.5 percent minimum wage increase and
that if they do, jobs will also decrease.
</P>
<P>
Under the new pension system, employers must deposit at least 6
percent of an employee's salary into their pension account each
month, which the employees can carry with them whenever they
change jobs. Under the old system, an employee would get his or
her pension after working for 25 consecutive years for the same
enterprise or when they reached the age of 55 years and had
worked for the same company for 15 consecutive years.
</P>
<P>
Also under the old system, employees would receive their pension
in one lump sum, while under the new system, retired workers are
eligible to receive a monthly pension for the rest of their
lives.
