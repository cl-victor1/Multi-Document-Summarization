KMT TO DISPOSE OF CENTRAL INVESTMENT HOLDING CO. BY END OF JUNE
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  April  25  (CNA) 04/25/07  19:25:06 (By Han Nai-kuo)

The opposition Kuomintang (KMT) will divest itself of all its
shares in the Central Investment Holding Co. -- the last KMT-
owned enterprise still in its possession -- by the end of June, a
senior KMT official said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
KMT Deputy Secretary-General Chang Che-shen claimed at a press
conference that although quite a few potential buyers had
expressed interest in acquiring the company, the Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) government "scared them off through
intimidation tactics."
</P>
<P>
The Cabinet and the DPP have been mustering support from voters
for a referendum to be held alongside the next election on
whether the KMT should give its "ill- gotten" assets to the
national coffers.
</P>
<P>
Chang, who is also director-general of the KMT Administration and
Management Committee and chairman of Central Investment Holding,
claimed that the DPP and the government do not really want to see
the KMT resolve its party assets problems because it would give
them a good excuse to assault the KMT and win votes in this
year's elections.
</P>
<P>
The KMT will try to find buyers for its shares in Central
Investment Holding within the next two months, Chang said, adding
that after it gets rid of the company, the KMT will no longer own
or operate any businesses.
</P>
<P>
Central Investment Holding was established in 1971 and became an
open company in 1995, with capital totaling NT$34.9 billion
(US$1.04 billion).
</P>
<P>
The KMT has denied that its assets are "ill-gotten" and insists
that its total assets as of the end of 1999 totaled only NT$69.6
billion, not the NT$600 billion claimed by the DPP.
