MURDERERS, MAJOR FINANCIAL CRIMINALS TO BE EXCLUDED FROM AMNESTY:
MOJ

Taipei,  April  25 (CNA) 04/25/07  17:01:02 (By Lilian Wu)

The Ministry of Justice (MOJ) said Wednesday that prison inmates
serving sentences for murder or major financial crimes will not
be included in a presidential amnesty now being studied by the
ministry.
</P>
<P>
Vice Justice Minister Lee Chin-yung made the remarks one day
after President Chen Shui-bian said he had instructed the
Executive Yuan to study commuting some sentences to coincide with
the 20th anniversary of the lifting of martial law and the 60th
anniversary of the 228 Incident, which refers to a civilian
revolt against the then corrupt government in 1947 that led to a
bloody crackdown.
</P>
<P>
Lee said that under a draft bill planned by the ministry, those
who are eligible for sentence commutation will be fewer than in
past sentence reductions.
</P>
<P>
To carry out a carrot-and-stick policy as espoused by the
president, those who have seriously damaged national and social
interests will not see their sentences commuted, but those who
have committed minor transgressions and are serving short prison
terms will be given the chance of a fresh start, he said.
</P>
<P>
Lee pointed out those who are convicted for corruption or major
financial crimes, and those have sexually assaulted children or
have murdered people will be excluded from the plan.
</P>
<P>
He also said that the ministry will continue to keep track of the
inmates released after commutation.
</P>
<P>
Asked if he is concerned about law and order after the exodus of
inmates under the amnesty, Lee cited a previous amnesty in 1991
as an example.
</P>
<P>
He noted that between 1991 and 2000, the recidivism ratio of
imnates who were released earlier after commutation was only
16.21 percent compared with the recidivism ratio of 49.9 percent
of prisoners who completed their terms and the recidivism ratio
of 50.7 percent for those who were released on parole between
1996 and 2006.
</P>
<P>
The government granted amnesties in 1971 and 1991 to mark the
60th and 80th founding anniversary of the nation, respectively.
Two other pardons were granted in 1975 and 1988 to mark the
deaths of the two late presidents -- Chiang Kai- shek and Chiang
Ching-kuo.
