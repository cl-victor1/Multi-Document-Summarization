A preliminary draft of a national sentence commutation act will
benefit more than 10,000 prison inmates, Vice Justice Minister
Lee Chin-yung said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The preliminary plan of the national amnesty legislation, in line
with President Chen Shui-bian's directive last week, will only
commute sentences for criminals serving time for crimes committed
before a certain date, Lee said, adding that the date will be
decided by the MOJ.
</P>
<P>
The draft of the national amnesty will not include criminals
convicted of serious crimes and crimes that endanger society, Lee
said, adding that crimes against the Prevention and Punishment of
Sex-Trade Act and special financial crimes will be excluded.
</P>
<P>
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) caucus whip Ker Chien-ming
said the draft will be submitted to the Executive Yuan for
approval before being sent for deliberation by the Legislative
Yuan.

<P>
Kao Yung-cheng, the executive director of the Judicial Reform
Foundation, said he is not against the amnesty or commutation as
it is allowed by the Constitution. However, he went on, an
amnesty on death-row inmates is a better way to show the DPP's
political ideal o f a nation built upon the principles of human
rights.

<P>
Vice Chairman of the International Federation for Human Rights
Siobhan Ni Chulachain has requested an amnesty for prisoners on
death row, but has received no response from the government, Kao
said.
