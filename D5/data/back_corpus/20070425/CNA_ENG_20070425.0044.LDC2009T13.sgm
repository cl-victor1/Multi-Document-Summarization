Key members of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) may
be disciplined if they fail to collect sufficient signatures in
the party's drive to force a referendum on appropriating
opposition Kuomintang's (KMT) ill-gotten assets, aDPP Central
Standing Committee resolution affirmed Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The DPP is pushing for a referendum to deal with the Kuomintang's
ill gotten assets alongside the 2008 presidential election and is
currently trying to collect the signatures of 1 million citizens
to back the initiative.
</P>
<P>
The DPP imposed quota requirements on its members holding party
or public offices, compelling them to gather signatures, but so
far the drive is well behind schedule, according to the party.
</P>
<P>
The DPP's acting Chairman Trong Chai suggested during the Central
Standing Committee meeting that the committee propose
disciplining key members who fail to collect the required numbers
of signatures by suspending their party memberships for one year.
This proposal would then be taken up at the party's National
Congress, scheduled for July.
</P>
<P>
However,  several committee members,  including the party's
legislative caucus leader Ker Chien-ming, argued that such
matters regarding penalties against party members should not be
determined by the committee.
</P>
<P>
The committee eventually reached a resolution that such cases be
referred to the Central Review Committee for a decision over
discipline.
</P>
<P>
Legislator Lawrence Gao said it is already stated in the party's
constitution that the partyshall deliberate and take appropriate
disciplinary action towards members whose statements or conduct
violate the constitution or resolutions, or are deemed to destroy
Party reputation, and therefore the new resolution came only as a
reaffirmation, adopted to remind members of the need to help
achieve the party's goals.
