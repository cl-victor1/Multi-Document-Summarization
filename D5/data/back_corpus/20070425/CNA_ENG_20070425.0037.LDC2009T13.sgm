The ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) will by May 12 at
soonest determine its candidate for the 2008 presidential
election, party sources said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The party's Central Standing Committee determined that the
presidential primary's public opinion poll will take place from
May 9-11, bringing the 4-horse race to a conclusion the next day,
attendees of the close-door meeting said.
</P>
<P>
Results  of the telephone  poll will weigh 70 percent in
determining who will represent the party, the other part of the
primary procedure - a vote by party members - has been set to
take place on May 6.
</P>
<P>
The meeting also decided that a third platform forum will be held
in Kaohsiung on May 3, as advocated by Vice President Annette Lu,
party officials said.
</P>
<P>
The DPP has on April 14 and 21 held two televised forums, which
were attended by all four runners: Lu, Premier Su Tseng-chang,
party chairman Yu Shyi-kun and former premier Frank Hsieh.
</P>
<P>
The Central Standing Committee set a date for public poll in
early May out of the concern that a prolonged competition and a
late result would be unfavorable to party solidarity, though Lu
suggested that the poll be held later in the month, party sources
said.

<P>
The date for the official nomination of the DPP's presidential
candidate had been set on May 30.
