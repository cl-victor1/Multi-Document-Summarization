CABINET WEB SITE ON KMT ASSETS OPENS
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Taipei, April 25 (CNA) 04/25/07  18:40:49 (By Flor Wang)

A Web site run by the Executive Yuan aimed at allowing the public
to gain an understanding of the government's efforts to recover
the main opposition Kuomintang's (KMT's) illegally or improperly
acquired assets was launched Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Premier Su Tseng-chang presided over the opening of the Web site
following an Executive Yuan weekly meeting earlier in the day,
during which Su was briefed by officials from the Ministry of
Finance and the Research, Development, and Evaluation Commission
(RDEC). Minister without Portfolio  Hsu Chih-hsiung, Finance Vice
Minister Lee Ruey-tsang and RDEC Vice Chairman Chen Chun-lin were
also present.
</P>
<P>
Su called on the public to support the government's drive to make
the KMT return its ill-gotten assets to serve transitional
justice and encouraged the public to visit the site at
http//igpa.nat.gov.tw.
</P>
<P>
According to Su, an Executive Yuan task force has been working on
the issue since late August last year, and then-KMT Chairman Ma
Ying-jeou promised to provide the public with a detailed
explanation of how the party has dealt with its property and land
plots. But Ma failed to honor his pledge and in turn sold much of
the KMT assets in a short time, he said.
</P>
<P>
The KMT still has assets worth more than NT$45 billion registered
under its name, but the actual value far exceeds this figure, Su
said, describing the KMT as "the world's wealthiest political
party."
</P>
<P>
The government's efforts to recover the KMT's assets can be dated
back to 2001, when the Control Yuan, Taiwan's highest government
watchdog agency, requested that the issue be addressed, Su said,
adding that a bill initiated by the ruling Democratic Progressive
Party (DPP) serving that end has been stonewalled in the
Legislative Yuan.
</P>
<P>
According to Hsu, the Executive Yuan has since the 2000 power
transfer been tracking the KMT's assets -- a complicated task
that he called "very difficult" due to the fact that the
opposition "pan-blue alliance" controls a majority in the
Legislative Yuan.
</P>
<P>
However, Hsu pointed out, the DPP administration will continue
pursuing the goal and plans to sponsor a series of seminars in
August across the country to delve into the issue.
</P>
<P>
Finance Vice Minister Lee brushed aside allegations that the
Executive Yuan's efforts in this regard are aimed at seeking
voter support in the coming elections, describing the rhetoric as
a smear tactic. The public now has a sense of urgency and hopes
that the KMT's assets can be quickly dealt with, he said.
</P>
<P>
According to the Executive Yuan's accounts, the value of the
KMT's unlawfully obtained assets might amount to at least NT$45
billion, ranging from real-estate and zero-interest bank loans to
KMT-run companies and special government subsidies for its
affiliated organizations and personnel.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, KMT Deputy Secretary-General Chang Che-shen
told a news conference at KMT headquarters that the party will
live up to Ma's promise to stop running any businesses by the end
of June this year.
</P>
<P>
He also said that the DPP administration has attempted to spoil
the KMT's lawful business deals by extorting potential buyers of
KMT companies.
