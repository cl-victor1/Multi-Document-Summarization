Domestic political parties will be barred from making extravagant
donations to their candidates for various political elections if
a draft package of amendments to the Political Contribution Act
passes the legislature, officials said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
According to the draft, political parties will be allowed to
contribute no more than NT$25 million to its nominee for the
presidential election.
</P>
<P>
The package also sets caps on donations by political parties to
their candidates for other elections -- NT$1 million for each of
its nominees running for legislative seats; NT$3 million for each
candidate running for mayor or magistrate; NT$300,000 each for
those running for county or city council seats and township
chief; NT$100,000 for each party nominee for borough or village
chief elections.
</P>
<P>
The same caps also limit political party spending on campaign
activities in support of their candidates at various levels of
elections,  according to the Cabinet-initiated  draft amendment
package.
</P>
<P>
Executive Yuan spokeswoman Chen Mei-ling said the Cabinet had
already approved the draft package of amendments at its weekly
meeting held earlier in the day. The package will soon be
referred to the Legislative Yuan for deliberation and approval,
Chen added.
</P>
<P>
The Political Contribution Act was promulgated in March 1993 as
part of the "sunshine laws" to curb corruption in politics and
enhance government transparency, Chen said, adding that the law
requires a major overhaul as a series of elections held over the
past years have revealed flaws and deficiencies in its
provisions.
</P>
<P>
In order to create a legitimate and ethical political environment
for fair competition among political parties, Chen said, the
proposed amendments will also impose caps on individual political
parties' contributions to various political groups.  The maximum
annual contribution to a particular political group by a
political party is set at NT$2 million, and the annual limit of
its contributions to various political groups is capped at NT$ 4
million.
