</HEADLINE>

Washington,  April 24 (CNA) 04/25/07  14:24:52 (By Chiehyu Lin
and Deborah Kuo)

Taiwan's new representative to the United States, Joseph Wu, paid
a courtesy call on Dana Rohrabacher (R-Calif.), a co-chair of the
U.S. Congress Taiwan Caucus, Tuesday to solicit  support  for
Taiwan's  bid to join the World Health Organization (WHO).
</P>
<P>
Wu, who formally assumed his post in Washington, D.C. April 16,
first  conveyed President  Chen  Shui-bian's  appreciation  to
Taiwan-friendly members of Congress, particularly Rohrabacher and
three other Taiwan  Caucus co-chairs, for their staunch  and
longstanding support for Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Wu said that despite the United States' support, Taiwan's WHO bid
has made little progress over the past 10 years due to China's
obstruction, adding that even in its efforts to join the World
Health Assembly (WHA) as an observer have failed.
</P>
<P>
He further said that Taiwan is adopting a new strategy this year
for a change -- preparing to apply directly to join the WHO as a
full member under the name "Taiwan" -- to let the international
community know that the 23 million people of Taiwan have the
right to join the world health regulatory body.
</P>
<P>
For his part, Rohrabacher said he understands that Taiwan and the
People's Republic of China are two different countries and that
Taiwan deserves more positive  treatment  in the international
community.
</P>
<P>
Rohrabacher said that Taiwan, which has made more contributions
to WHO efforts than China has, deserves fairer treatment, adding
that he will relentlessly work to help Taiwan gain entry into the
WHO as a full member.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Rohrabacher also expressed his hope and the set policy
of the U.S. administration that Taiwan will maintain more direct
contact with the Chinese people in efforts to sell Taiwan's
democracy in China and thus help change the Chinese people's
mindset and vision.
</P>
<P>
Wu responded that he had made strenuous efforts during his stint
as the chairman of the Mainland Affairs Council -- Taiwan's top
China policy planning agency -- to let the Chinese people better
understand Taiwan's democratization, including the freedom of
speech and the freedom that Taiwan media outlets have enjoyed, by
inviting media members, scholars and even officials from China
and Hong Kong to visit Taiwan in person.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Wu also appealed to the U.S. Congress for its support
for Taiwan's bid to sign a free trade agreement (FTA) with the
United States to better facilitate business and trade exchanges
between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Wu stressed that the U.S.-South Korea FTA, signed earlier this
month, has put Taiwan at a disadvantage and that it will
undermine its economic development as South Korea is a major
rival of Taiwan's in terms of foreign trade.
</P>
<P>
For his part, Rohrabacher said that he will continue to push for
the signing of a U.S-Taiwan FTA since he has always advocated
that it is only natural that free countries forge free trade
pacts among themselves.
</P>
<P>
Rohrabacher, however, added that he is afraid he cannot be too
optimistic at present on this issue under the current
circumstances in which the United States needs to curry favor
with China for its support on the North Korea issue.
