DPP LAWMAKERS COMPLAIN OF QUOTA REQUIREMENT REGARDING KMT ASSETS
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  April 25 (CNA) 04/25/07  21:41:57 (By Flor Wang)

<P>
Several ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) lawmakers
complained Wednesday of a quota requirement that the party plans
to impose on its public office holders regarding liquidating the
main opposition Kuomintang's (KMT) assets, arguing that the issue
must not become a liability for the DPP.
</P>
<P>
DPP legislative caucus whip Wang Tuoh voiced the concern in a
Legislative Yuan news conference and urged the party central to
refrain from implementing the drastic measure, which he warned
might strain party unity.
</P>
<P>
Wang made the comments after it was reported that the DPP intends
to impose quotas on its public office holders, requiring them to
collect enough signatures to endorse a DPP-initiated campaign
demanding that the KMT return its illegally acquired assets.
</P>
<P>
According to local media reports, the DPP is planning to adopt
the measure in a party congress slated for late June that will
suspend for one year the membership rights of those who fail to
obtain the number of signatures allocated by the party central.
The DPP has been seriously lagging behind in the campaign second-
phase schedule of targets in terms of signatures collected, the
reports stated.
</P>
<P>
According to Wang, the party central should not approve the
controversial measure at this sensitive time in the run up to the
legislative and presidential primary elections.
</P>
<P>
Suspending  someone's party membership  might be viewed or
misunderstood as a scheme to rule out potential candidates, thus
hobbling party unity, Wang said.
</P>
<P>
In addition, he said, putting the KMT assets issue to a national
referendum alongside the presidential election will be a
development of major significance. Although getting back
unlawfully obtained assets for the national coffers serves social
justice, he said, it is worth noting that the issue will be
ineligible from inclusion in public referenda for three years
should it fail to pass in the first attempt.
</P>
<P>
Wang suggested the DPP central encourage party members by
offering substantial incentives instead of punishments so as to
not upset party unity.
</P>
<P>
DPP lawmaker Cheng Yun-peng said he cannot accept the logic
behind the party's planned imposition of the measure, questioning
"Why must responsibility for the KMT's wrongdoing be assumed by
the DPP? "
</P>
<P>
Such a wrongheaded move will hurt the DPP, and the issue must not
be turned into a weapon with which to defeat opponents in the
party's legislative primary, he said.
</P>
<P>
Wu Ping-jei, a DPP Central Standing Committee member, also voiced
his worry that the quota allocation proposal might spark disputes
within the party, particularly at a time when the party's
legislative primary is entering the final stage. The party
central must give the issue a second thought, he said.
