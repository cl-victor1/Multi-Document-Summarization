Taipei,   April  13  (CNA) 04/13/07  22:31:34 (By Sofia Wu)
</P>
<P>
Five people, including three vice presidents  of Inventec
Appliances  Corp.-- a local  handset manufacturing company that
also produces iPod music players for Apple Inc., were taken into
custody Friday to facilitate probes into the company's suspected
involvement in insider trading.
</P>
<P>
However, the company's chairman, Chang Ching-sung, who is one of
the prime targets in the suspected insider trading
investigations, flew out of Taiwan two hours before prosecutors
raided the company's headquarters in Wugu, Taipei County and the
homes of several corporate executives Thursday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors said they have kept a close track of Inventec
Appliances Corp.'s operations for some time, but have refrained
from imposing any overseas travel ban on the company's senior
executives for fear of alerting  them and thereby hindering
subsequent investigations.
</P>
<P>
They denied that any law enforcement officer leaked information
about an impending raid on the company to any of the company's
executives.
</P>
<P>
Another target of probe, Inventec Appliances President Lee Chia-
en, is now in China. Prosecutors said once Chang and Lee return
to Taiwan, they will be subpoenaed for questioning.
</P>
<P>
Both Lee's wife Chang Su-wei and his younger brother Lee Chia-
chung have been held in incommunicado over their suspected roles
in the alleged insider trading of the company's stocks.
</P>
<P>
Also detained were the company's three vice presidents -- Chen
Hung-lieh, who concurrently serves as corporate spokesman, Chuang
Chin-tai, and Tseng Ching-an who concurrently serves as the
company's chief financer.
</P>
<P>
Of the 17 people who were brought back to the Panchiao
Prosecutors Office for questioning, six were released after
overnight interrogations. The remaining six were released on bail
ranging between NT$5 million and NT$100,000.
</P>
<P>
More than 200 prosecutors and investigators were mobilized to
raid Inventec Appliances Thursday afternoon in search for
evidence supportive of charges on insider trading.
</P>
<P>
In the raid, a massive collection of corporate documents and
accounting books were also seized, prosecutors said.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the Panchiao District Prosecutors Office said law
enforcement authorities launched the raid after receiving
reliable information  that pointed  to high-ranking  Inventec
managers manipulating the company's stock prices.
</P>
<P>
A large portion of Inventec Appliances turnover for last year was
derived from the popular iPod digital music player for Apple
Inc., while its handset business accounted for only about 10
percent of the company's 2006 revenues, according to corporate
accounting records.
</P>
<P>
The company's business turnover for the first quarter plunged
substantially, while its work force had also been cut by more
than 10 percent to about 13,817 as of the end of March.
</P>
<P>
Inventec Appliances is the latest in a spate of listed technology
companies under investigation  for suspected  insider trading,
following Veutron Corp., a memory module and scanner maker in
Powerchip Group, and BenQ Corp. Inventec Appliances is 45 percent
owned by computer maker Inventec Corp.
</P>
<P>
Ministry of Justice (MOJ)  officials said streamlining the
financial market and cracking down on major economic crimes have
been the major targets of prosecutorial investigations over the
past half year.
</P>
<P>
In the future, the officials said, prosecution authorities will
continue giving priority to dealing with five types of crime,
with an aim to realizing the MOJ- set target of pursuing 40
suspected economic and financial irregularities by the end of
this year, including at least 10 definitive cases.
</P>
<P>
That means that prosecutors will tackle at least four major
corporate scandals in the coming months since they have already
been in an intensive quest for alleged legal transgressions by
six listed corporations in the past six months, including
Veutron, BenQ, Inventec Appliances, Rebar Group, Chinatrust
Financial Group and China Development Financial Holding Co.
</P>
<P>
According to MOJ officials, the financial crimes to be cracked
down will include insider trading and stock price manipulation,
embezzlement of corporate funds, accounting fraud and illegal
lending, illegal corporate mergers and takeovers, as well as
illegal private equity transactions and capital solicitation.
