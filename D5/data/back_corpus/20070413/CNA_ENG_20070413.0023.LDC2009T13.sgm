Taipei, April 13 (CNA) 04/13/07  17:53:13 (By Lilian Wu)

<P>
President Chen Shui-bian urged the four presidential aspirants of
the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) Friday to avoid
attacking one another and to engage in a "gentleman's battle."
</P>
<P>
President Chen issued the appeal in a press release as the four
hopefuls -- Vice President Annette Lu, Premier Su Tseng-chang,
DPP Chairman Yu Shyi-kun and former Premier Frank Hsieh -- have
begun to attack one another more fiercely ahead of the party's
upcoming presidential primary.
</P>
<P>
The latest incident revolved around Hsieh and former Vice Premier
Yeh Chu-lan, who criticized Su Thursday for "flip-flopping" in
his stances on the planned construction of the Suhua Freeway and
the planned demolition of the Losheng Sanatorium.
</P>
<P>
Su retorted by saying such attacks are mean-spirited, adding that
Yu,  during his premiership,  proposed  a budget and started
construction of the freeway, and Hsieh, his predecessor,
allocated funds for construction of the freeway. He further said
that he wondered whether he would have to face the problem today
if his two predecessors had handled the issue well, according to
news reports.
</P>
<P>
Faced with a mounting war of words among the four aspirants, the
president said that he issued the four-point statement "in a
somber mood" on the eve of the first of two platform
presentations for the four presidential hopefuls.
</P>
<P>
Presidential Office sources said that the president will only
watch the platform presentation Saturday and will not speak
during it.
</P>
<P>
The president expressed the hope that all the DPP's presidential
aspirants will realize that the voters and the party's supporters
have "high expectations" of them and that they themselves or
their close aides should "show restraint in their actions and
their words."
</P>
<P>
Chen stressed that there are no differences in basic policy line
among the aspirants and that all within the party have followed
the ideal of "Taiwan- centric consciousness."
</P>
<P>
The stances of the hopefuls on public issues may be different,
but they can engage in serious examination and discussion of
them, the president said, adding that he hopes to see more
discussion on public issues in Saturday's presentation.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the DPP has ruled the nation for nearly seven years,
Chen said that all four aspirants have led in the administrative
team before and that they should shoulder part of the
responsibility for its performance.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the performance of the administration is the
concerted efforts of all and that all should share the
responsibility if there are things that need improvement, instead
of passing the buck to others.
