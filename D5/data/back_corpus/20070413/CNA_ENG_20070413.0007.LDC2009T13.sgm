U.S. URGES TAIWAN TO APPLY TO JOIN WHA AS OBSERVER
</HEADLINE>

Washington,  April 12 (CNA) 04/13/07  13:20:37 (By Chiehyu Lin
and Deborah Kuo)

U.S. State Department officials said Thursday that it would be
more appropriate for Taiwan to seek accession to the World Health
Assembly (WHA) , the decision- making body of the World Health
Organization (WHO), as an observer, rather than seeking to join
the WHO as a full member under the name "Taiwan."
</P>
<P>
The State Department officials in charge of East Asian affairs
said that the United States has always encouraged Taiwan to seek
"meaningful participation" in international organizations and has
believed  that the people  of Taiwan  are capable  of making
extraordinary contributions to the world health arena and that
they should enjoy the same relevant rights as other citizens in
the global community.
</P>
<P>
They said the 23 million Taiwan people's opportunities to make
contributions to world health affairs will be impeded if Taiwan
is barred from "meaningful participation" in WHO activities,
adding that Taiwan is entitled to that right and privilege.
</P>
<P>
However, the officials also said that it is the United States'
set policy not to support Taiwan's pursuit of joining
international organizations where statehood is required for
membership, adding that the United States supports Taiwan's
seeking to join the WHA as an observer.
</P>
<P>
The State Department officials made the remarks after Taiwan's
foreign minister, James Huang, confirmed in Taipei Thursday that
President Chen Shui-bian had written a letter to WHO Director-
General Margaret Chan the day before in which the president
stressed that based on the WHO's spirit of protecting the health
of all peoples around the world and the notion that medical care
knows no borders, Taiwan has every right to apply to join the WHO
as a full member.
</P>
<P>
As a matter of strategy, Huang said, Taiwan will adopt a three-
pronged approach this year to facilitate its bid to join the
world health regulatory body, specifically continuing to seek
observer  status in the WHA;  continuing  to seek "meaningful
participation" in WHO technical conferences; and applying for
full membership in the WHO under the name "Taiwan."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the State Department officials reiterated the U.S.
stance on cross- strait relations, saying that the United States
does not support Taiwan independence and opposes any unilateral
changes to the status quo across the Taiwan Strait by either
Taiwan or China.
</P>
<P>
President Chen's "five noes" pledge announced in his inaugural
speech in 2000 has been the bedrock of regional peace and
stability in East Asia, they said, adding that whether Chen will
deliver on his promise of not seeking independence will be a good
test of his leadership, reliability, and his ability to handle
foreign relations, protect Taiwan's interests and secure cross-
strait stability.
</P>
<P>
They stressed that seeking to join the WHO as a full member under
the name "Taiwan" does not comply with President Chen's pledge.
