Police seized 34 kg of amphetamine, 130 kg of ketamine, and some
280,000 MDMA pills, and arrested six drug smuggling suspects
during a Thursday night raid on a warehouse in the northern port
city of Keelung, said police officers of the Criminal
Investigation Bureau (CIB) Friday.

<P>
Police said that they were surprised by sheer volume of the
various  drugs smuggled  from China,  which were seized in a
record-breaking raid. Such a quantity of drugs could supply the
needs of approximately 1 million addicts, they added.
</P>
<P>
According to the CIB, a drug smuggling ring involved in the case
had successfully shipped drugs from China to the island three
times. The organization was also found to be running a trading
company as a money laundering front.

<P>
An investigation into the origins of the drugs, how the drugs
made the way into Taiwan, and the ring's drug trading network has
been launched.
