DPP CAUCUS CALLS FOR OPPOSITION'S SUPPORT FOR TAIWAN'S WHO BID
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  April  13 (CNA) 04/13/07  17:03:43 (By Deborah Kuo)

The legislative caucus of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) called Friday for the opposition parties to support
Taiwan's seeking to join the World Health Organization (WHO) as a
full member under the name "Taiwan."
</P>
<P>
The DPP lawmakers made the call after President Chen Shui-bian's
chief of staff, Chiou I-jen, confirmed Thursday that the
president had written a letter to WHO Director-General Margaret
Chan the day before in which he stressed that based on the WHO's
spirit of protecting the health of all peoples around the world
and the notion that medical care knows no borders, Taiwan has
every right to apply to join the WHO as a full member.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a news conference, Ker Chien-ming, a whip of the DPP
legislative caucus, said it has been a longstanding goal of the
DPP administration to seek Taiwan's accession to the WHO and the
United Nations under the name "Taiwan."
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, Ker added, there has been very little progress
made in this regard over the past years due to China's
obstruction.
</P>
<P>
Ker expressed the hope that the opposition parties will join
hands with the ruling DPP to jointly safeguard the health of all
the people of Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Chen Chung-hsin, director of the DPP Department of International
Affairs, said that more than 100 legislators from across the
political spectrum signed proposal last year to support Taiwan's
bid to join the WHO as a full member under the name "Taiwan, "
while 95 percent of the Taiwan people agreed that Taiwan should
be admitted into the WHO -- facts indicating that protecting the
health of all of the residents of Taiwan equates to protecting an
important human right.
</P>
<P>
Wang Hsin-nan, another whip of the DPP legislative caucus, said
that Taiwan's attempts to join the World Health Assembly (WHA) ,
the WHO's decision-making body, as an observer, have all failed
over the past 10 years, even during the height of the scourge of
severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), because of Beijing's
obstruction.
</P>
<P>
Wang said Taiwan, as a dynamic economic powerhouse and a
sovereign state with a population of 23 million, should be
admitted into the WHO as a full member. He called for the
opposition parties not to "cooperate" with China to jointly
suppress Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Noting that Taiwan had managed to secure only "second-hand"
medical and quarantine information during the SARS and bird flu
outbreaks due to China's interference, DPP Legislator Huang Wei-
che said that Taiwan should be allowed to have dialogue with the
WHO and have access to WHO meetings on the grounds that health
issues are life-and-death human rights issues.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile,  Chang Jung-kung, deputy director-general of the
opposition Kuomintang's Policy Committee, criticized President
Chen for writing to the WHO chief about Taiwan applying to join
the WHO as full member under the name "Taiwan, " saying that the
move is unrealistic and nothing but a scheme designed to invite
even greater obstruction from China on the diplomatic front so as
to help the DPP win "sympathy votes" in the upcoming major
elections in the country.
</P>
<P>
In a written message issued in response to Chen's letter to the
WHO chief, Chang said it is explicitly clear in the current
international situation,  including the United States' adhering
strongly to its "one China" policy, that Taiwan has no chance of
joining the WHO as a full member under the name "Taiwan" since
statehood is required for membership in the world health
regulatory body.
</P>
<P>
Chang said he sees the Chen administration's WHO bid not as a
sincere bid to join the organization but as "a one side, one
country plot."
