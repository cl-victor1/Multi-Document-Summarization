</HEADLINE>

<P>
Taipei,  April 13 (CNA) 04/13/07  23:25:18 (By T.C. Jiang)
</P>
<P>
Premier Su Tseng-chang has announced that the demolition of the
Losheng Sanatorium will be suspended and the Executive Yuan will
strive to retain 90 percent of the four-hectare compound.
</P>
<P>
The announcement came after Su visited the sanatorium in the
northern county of Taipei Thursday for the first time in his
capacity as premier.
</P>
<P>
The sanatorium was constructed in 1930 by Japanese colonizers for
the segregation and treatment of persons with Hansen's disease,
and now is home to several dozen elderly patients.
</P>
<P>
One day ahead of the visit, Su received sanatorium patients and
preservationists at the Executive Yuan to discuss possible
solutions.
</P>
<P>
Su said at the sanatorium that the Cabinet will ask the Taipei
county government not to carry out the dismantlement as
originally scheduled on April 16 to make way for a Taipei metro
depot construction project.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Su stressed that the construction project will not be
postponed, promising that the Cabinet will provide subsidies to
cover the extra costs incurred by the preservation of the
sanatorium.
</P>
<P>
The premier also apologized to the patients, saying that the
government did not fully realize the significance of the
sanatorium and did not communicate well with patients during the
decision-making process in 1994.
</P>
<P>
Su said that now engineering experts will have more time to come
up with a win- win plan respecting the needs of both sanatorium
and construction project.
</P>
<P>
He also urged all parties concerned to replace confrontation with
communication and to help transform Taiwan into a country that
safeguards human rights and culture.
