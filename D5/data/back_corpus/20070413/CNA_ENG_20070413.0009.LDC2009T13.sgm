JAPANESE MAN RECEIVES SUSPENDED SENTENCE FOR SWEARING AT

A Japanese citizen has received a suspended sentence of 30 days
in detention for cursing at officials during immigration
inspection at Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport more than a
year ago, aviation police sources said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The man, who is married to a Taiwanese woman and often travels
back and forth between Taiwan and Japan, is also barred from
visiting Taiwan for five years, according to the court ruling.
</P>
<P>
On a trip to Taiwan in September 2005, the man became so enraged
by what he called the snail-paced immigration inspection at the
Taoyuan airport that he burst into a volley of curses when an
immigration officer began checking his travel documents.
</P>
<P>
Immigration authorities later filed a lawsuit against him. After
more than a year of judicial proceedings, the Taoyuan District
Court handed down its ruling earlier this week.
</P>
<P>
According to the ruling, the man had violated Article 140 of
Taiwan's Criminal Code which bans anyone from insulting a public
official during the legal discharge of his or her official
duties.
</P>
<P>
Immigration officials said they felt compelled to file the
lawsuit to defend the government's prestige and public authority.
They expressed regret that the Japanese man has never shown any
signs of remorse for his actions and has fought the charges by
filing petitions with many local government agencies, including
the Tourism Bureau, over the past year.
