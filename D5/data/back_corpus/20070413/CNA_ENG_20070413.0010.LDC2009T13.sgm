Taipei,  April 13 (CNA) 04/13/07  14:08:00 (By Sofia Wu)

Prosecutors said Friday they will step up the search for the
chairman of Inventec Appliances Corp., a local handset maker that
also produces iPod music players for Apple Inc., as part of their
probes into the company's suspected involvement in insider
trading.
</P>
<P>
After checking with immigration, law enforcement officers from
the Panchiao Prosecutor's Office said they believe that Inventec
Appliances Chairman Chang Ching-sung is still in Taiwan, while
the company's president Lee Chia-en is in China.
</P>
<P>
More than 200 prosecutors and investigators raided Inventec
Appliances Thursday afternoon to search for evidence to support
charges of alleged insider trading.
</P>
<P>
A total of 17 members of the company's management staff,
including its vice president and spokesman, Chen Hung-lieh, and
the heads of the company's Shanghai and Nanjing factories, Ho
Tai-shui and Lai Chen-hsing, were brought back to the Panchiao
District Prosecutors Office for questioning. The interrogations
continued to midnight.
</P>
<P>
In the raid at the company's headquarters in Wugu, Taipei County
and at the homes of Inventec senior executives, a massive
collection of corporate documents and accounting books were also
seized.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the Panchiao District Prosecutors Office said law
enforcement authorities launched the raid after receiving
reliable information that pointed to high-ranking Inventec
managers manipulating the company's stock prices.
</P>
<P>
A large portion of Inventec Appliances turnover for last year was
derived from the popular iPod digital music player for Apple
Inc., while its handset business accounted for only about 10
percent of the company's 2006 revenues, according to corporate
accounting records.
</P>
<P>
The company's business turnover for the first quarter plunged
substantially, while its work force had also been cut by more
than 10 percent to about 13,817 as of the end of March.
</P>
<P>
Inventec Appliances is the latest in a spate of listed technology
companies under investigation  for suspected  insider trading,
following Veutron Corp., a memory module and scanner maker in
Powerchip Group, and BenQ Corp. Inventec Appliances is 45 percent
owned by computer maker Inventec Corp.
</P>
<P>
Ministry of Justice (MOJ)  officials said streamlining the
financial market and cracking down on major economic crimes have
been the major targets of prosecutorial investigations over the
past half year.
</P>
<P>
In the future, the officials said, prosecution authorities will
continue giving priority to dealing with five types of crime,
with an aim to realizing the MOJ- set target of pursuing 40
suspected economic and financial irregularities by the end of
this year, including at least 10 definitive cases.
</P>
<P>
That means that prosecutors will tackle at least four major
corporate scandals in the coming months since they have already
been in an intensive quest for alleged legal transgressions by
six listed corporations in the past six months, including
Veutron, BenQ, Inventec Appliances, Rebar Group, Chinatrust
Financial Group and China Development Financial Holding Co.
</P>
<P>
According to MOJ officials, the financial crimes to be cracked
down will include insider trading and stock price manipulation,
embezzlement of corporate funds, accounting fraud and illegal
lending, illegal corporate mergers and takeovers, as well as
illegal private equity transactions and capital solicitation.
