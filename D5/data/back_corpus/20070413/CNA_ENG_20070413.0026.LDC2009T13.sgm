In light of a wider use of electronic thermometers, the commodity
regulatory authority has mapped out a plan in which such products
will be subject to verification from 2008 to ensure their
accuracy, an official said Friday.

The decision was made in response to the prevalence of electronic
thermometers, itself a result of global limits on the use of
mercury thermometers amid mounting concerns that mercury could
pose a health threat to individuals and endanger the ecology and
wildlife, the official from the Bureau of Standards, Metrology
and Inspection (BSMI) said.

According to the official, the BSMI has formulated regulations
for implementing verification and inspection procedures and
stepped up the procurement of relevant testing facilities aimed
at including electronic thermometers in the scope its work
beginning Jan. 1, 2008.

<P>
Currently, only mercury thermometers are categorized as legal
temperature measuring instruments and subject to verification.
</P>
<P>
According to the BSMI-drafted regulations, all contact electronic
thermometers will be required to pass an accuracy test measuring
the temperatures 35.5, 37 and 41 degree Celsius, in an
environment in which the ambient temperature is 23 degree Celsius
(plus or minus 5 degree Celsius ) , relative humidity is 50 (plus
or minus 20) .The maximum permissible error during verification
of the thermometers is plus and minus 0.1 degree Celsius.
