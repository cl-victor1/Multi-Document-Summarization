An invasion by parasites in a woman's brain caused her headaches
and occasional epilepsy for 30 years until a brain operation
earlier this year, a Taipei County hospital said Friday.

<P>
Neurosurgeon Yen Ching-hua of the Far Eastern Memorial Hospital
reported on the case in a news conference, saying the operation
removed four calcified tumors from the 67-year-old woman's right
occipital lobe; an analysis of the tumors found calcified
cestodes.

He said that cases of parasites invading into brain are rare
outside of agricultural areas having polluted water, poorly
processed food and bad sanitation. In Taiwan such cases have
occasionally occurred in the past but are rarely seen now,he
said.
