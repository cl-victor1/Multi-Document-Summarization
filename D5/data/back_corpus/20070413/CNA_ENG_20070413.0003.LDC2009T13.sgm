The government is glad to see Japan stick to its guns while
engaging with China on issues concerning Taiwan, Ministry of
Foreign Affairs spokesman Wang Chien- yeh said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Wang was referring to a Tokyo-Beijing joint communique issued
after a high-level meeting between Japanese Prime Minister
Shintaro Abe and his Chinese counterpart Wen Jiabao in Tokyo the
day before, in which Japan reaffirmed its commitment to the two
countries' 1972 joint communique in dealing with relations with
Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Wang said the government is relieved that Japan has neither
retreated from its original stance nor made any fundamental
changes in its policy regarding Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
In the 1972 Sino-Japanese joint communique, Japan said it will
abide by the "One China" policy in dealing with Taiwan. Before
Wen headed for Japan Wednesday on a three-day visit to help thaw
relations as the two countries work to reverse a deterioration in
ties caused in part by disagreements over history, speculation
had it that China might force Japan to make a new commitment,
limiting its substantive ties with Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Noting that Taiwan has advocated  parallel development  of
Taipei-Tokyo and Tokyo-Beijing relations, Wang said Japan should
never seek to further ties with Beijing at the expense of
engagement with Taiwan, a long-time trading partner of Japan.
</P>
<P>
Pointing out that a cordial Taiwan-Japanese relationship holds
the key to Asia- Pacific stability and prosperity, Wang said he
is convinced that substantive relations between the two countries
will continue to progress in the future.
</P>
<P>
In a speech delivered at the Japanese Diet Thursday, the Chinese
premier urged Japan's parliament not to forget Tokyo's wartime
aggression even as the two Asian powers mend their strained ties
and bolster thriving business relations. Wen also warned the
Japanese not to meddle in Beijing's relations with Taiwan.
