The Mainland Affairs Council has said that China must seek
Taiwan's permission to have the 2008 Olympic torch relay pass
through Taiwan, according to a Radio Taiwan International report
issued Friday.
</P>
<P>
MAC Vice Chairman Liu Te-hsun made the remarks to discount rumors
that the International Olympic Committee has included Taiwan in
the 2008 Olympic torch relay route.
</P>
<P>
Liu said, "If the Olympic torch route is to pass through Taiwan,
the International Olympic Committee has to go through the
formalities and seek permission from us. Under the condition of
benefiting cross-strait relations, we believe that the torch
relay will proceed very smoothly without compromising Taiwan's
sovereignty."
</P>
<P>
Liu said that Taiwan belongs to the International Olympic
Committee as an independent country. He said the committee should
therefore follow procedure and respect Taiwan's sovereignty.
