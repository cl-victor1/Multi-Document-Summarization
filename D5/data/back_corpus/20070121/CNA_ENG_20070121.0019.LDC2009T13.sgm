A preparatory committee has been formed for the construction of a
memorial hall in commemoration of the late Minister of Justice
Chen Ding-nan, who died of lung cancer last November, the
committee's spokesman, Lai Juei-ting, said Sunday.

According to Lai, the committee held its inaugural meeting at
Yilan Senior High School in northeastern Yilan County Saturday.

Lai said construction of the memorial hall will cost an estimated
NT$50 million, and an additional NT$200 million will be needed
for follow-up operations.

<P>
The committee has so far collected only NT$ 9.1 million, Lai
said, adding that the committee has also not yet decided on the
planned memorial hall's location.

According to an initial blueprint, Lai said the memorial hall
will have a main gallery to display Chen's manuscripts and other
documents, particularly those from his eight-year term as Yilan
County Magistrate.
