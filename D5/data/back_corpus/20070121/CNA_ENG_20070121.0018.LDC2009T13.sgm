Taipei Jan. 21 (CNA) 01/21/07  18:32:02 (By Y.C. Jou)

<P>
Hit by high oil and natural gas prices last year, state-own
Chinese Petroleum Corporation (CPC) and Taiwan Power Company
(Taipower) posted respective losses of NT$18.76 billion and
NT$2.89 billion in 2006, the Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA)
said.
</P>
<P>
According to the MOEA's State-owned Enterprise Commission (SEC) ,
profits made by the other four companies under the commission
were insufficient to cover the losses of the CPC and Taipower,
placing the total balance of the SEC businesses at NT$12.56
billion in the red, lagging far behind the goal of NT$8 billion
in before-tax profit.
</P>
<P>
The CPC did not adjust domestic oil prices sufficiently to keep
pace with rapidly escalating international oil prices in the
first half of 2006, causing an accumulated NT$25.73 billion loss
between January and September, the SEC said.
</P>
<P>
The situation was relieved in late September after the government
introduced a floating oil price measure designed to price
gasoline and diesel fuel in better relation to fluctuations in
international markets. The CPC started to move monthly figures
out of the red and into the black in October and achieved an
NT$3.56-billion before-tax profit in December, the MOEA said. The
2006 goal set for the CPC was NT$ 20.47 billion in before-tax
profit.
</P>
<P>
Taipower's NT$2.89 billion annual deficit was, however, better
than a previously estimate of NT$13.71 billion in the red.
</P>
<P>
As for the four profitable  SEC companies,  Taiwan  Sugar
Corporation showed an annual before-tax profit of NT$7.21
billion, better than its goal of NT$1.43 billion;  China
Shipbuilding Corporation realized a profit of NT$1.49 billion,
compared to its NT$0.34-billion goal; Taiwan Water Corporation
was NT$0.36 billion in the black, compared to an estimated
deficit of NT$0.71 billion; and Aerospace Industrial Development
Corporation profited to the tune of NT$0.04 billion, or an
achievement rate of 20.53 percent, according to the SEC.
