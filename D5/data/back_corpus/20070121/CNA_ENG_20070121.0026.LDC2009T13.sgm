The government is drafting a basic law designed to serve as
guidelines  for Taiwan's future economic development, Ministry of
Economic Affairs (MOEA) officials said.
</P>
<P>
In preparation for the scheduled expiration at the end of 2009 of
tax abatement articles in the current Statute for Upgrading
Industry, drafts of the basic law and two accompanying statutes,
focused respectively on encouraging innovation and developing
industrial parks, will be submitted to the Cabinet in July or
August, officials said.
</P>
<P>
MOEA Vice Minister Shih Yen-shiang said the new industrial
policies will not use tax abatement as the only instrument to
boost industrial development. Tax abatement was a heated issue in
last July's Conference on Sustaining Taiwan's Economic
Development, and the Ministry of Finance has been its opponent.
