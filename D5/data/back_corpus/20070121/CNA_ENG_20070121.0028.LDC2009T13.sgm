SCHOLARS CRITICIZE JUDGE'S RULING ON 'STATE AFFAIRS FUND' FILES
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taipei,  Jan.  21 (CNA) 01/21/07  23:48:25 (By Sofia Wu)
</P>
<P>
A Taipei District Court judge came under fire Sunday over his
recent ruling that the six diplomatic missions involved in the
high-profile "special state affairs fund" case were not "state
secrets" as defined by the national law.
</P>
<P>
Tsai Shou-hsun, the presiding judge handling the trial concerning
the alleged "special state affairs fund" misuse scandal, ruled
Friday that the six diplomatic missions cited by the Presidential
Office as having used the "state affairs fund" budgeted for
President Chen Shui-bian's discretionary use are not "state
secrets" as defined by the Classified National Security
Information Protection Act.
</P>
<P>
As a result, Tsai said the court has decided that the documents
sealed  by prosecutor  Chen Jui-jen  after  he completed  his
investigations into the suspected scandal to prevent the release
of secret diplomatic information are "not under the protection of
the classified information protection law" and has decided to
open the three sets of documents to attorneys and prosecutors in
the case Jan. 23 if President Chen fails to offer an explanation
as to the status of the documents by Jan. 22.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the judge's ruling, a group of scholars said the
decision reflected the judge's ignorance of "judicial restraint"
while excessively expanding judicial power. They suggested that
President Chen take the initiative to apply to the Council of
Grand Justices for an interpretation of the constitutionality of
such a ruling.
</P>
<P>
The  academics  presented  their  views  at a seminar  on
constitutional limitations on the president's execution of duties
and judicial power. The seminar was moderated by Ku Chung-hua, a
National Chengchi University professor.
</P>
<P>
In the United States, it tends to be the president, the attorney
general and White House advisers to define whether an event or
documents are "state secrets" and U.S. federal judges and Supreme
Court justices usually respect their judgments, Shih Cheng-feng,
a Tamkang University professor, said at the seminar.
</P>
<P>
Shih said he doesn't think that local judges have sufficient
professional knowledge to determine whether a document or an
event should be classified as a "state secret" or not.
</P>
<P>
In his view, Shih went on, the judge's "no secret" decision and
his another controversial decision to fine the five Presidential
Office officials NT$30,000 each for absence from Friday's hearing
as witnesses fully demonstrated the "judge's arrogance" and
encroachment on the executive power.
</P>
<P>
The judge's ruling would expose the country's secret diplomacy
operations and decision-making formula that would hurt national
interests, Shih added.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on the same occasion, Hsu Yung-ming, an assistant
researcher at Academia Sinica, said the expansion of legislative
and judicial powers have become ubiquitous in Taiwan since the
transition of power between different political parties in 2000.
</P>
<P>
According to Hsu, the enactment of the National Communications
Commission (NCC) Organic Law by the opposition-controlled
Legislative Yuan is a telling example of expansion of legislative
power. The law allows political parties to recommend individuals
to form the NCC in proportion to the number of seats they control
in the legislature.
</P>
<P>
The prosecution against suspects in the special "state affairs
fund" case and the latest judge ruling on relevant document files
are impressive examples of expansion of judicial power, Hsu said.
</P>
<P>
"In all those cases, the executive branch has consistently been
the victim and this has become a new phenomenon in Taiwan's
democratic development," Hsu lamented.
</P>
<P>
Noting that now is the time for a clarification of Taiwan's
constitutional order, Hsu said President Chen should file for a
grand justices interpretation on the constitutionality of the
judge's ruling.
</P>
<P>
Hsu said he believes that Taiwan's constitutional system would
become more mature with grand justices'  playing the role of
arbitrator and that various public agencies would get a better
understanding of the limitations of their jurisdiction.
</P>
<P>
Chen Yao-hsiang,  a National  Taipei  University  assistant
professor, said the expansion of power of legislative and
judicial branches is a phenomenon of Taiwan's transition from
authoritarian rule to democracy. As Taiwan's legal education has
not sufficiently touched Constitution-related topics, he said,
many local judges and prosecutors do not have a clear
understanding of constitutional provisions.
</P>
<P>
Against this backdrop, Chen Yao-hsiang said, the presiding judge
handling the "state affairs fund" case has ignored the "judicial
restraint" -- a theory that endorses the limited exercise of
power by the judiciary and advocates basing decisions on grounds
that have been previously defined by judicial precedents.
</P>
<P>
He recalled that in the No. 328 and No.419 constitutionality
rulings concerning the country's traditional territories and
whether Lien Chan could concurrently serve as vice president and
premier, the Council of Grand Justices noticed the division of
politics and judicial affairs and thus refrained from getting
involved in those affairs.
</P>
<P>
"It's regrettable that the judge failed to notice this point and
sided with prosecutors to challenge the defense, " Chen Yao-
hsiang argued.
</P>
<P>
First lady Wu Shu-jen and three former presidential aides were
indicted on charges of corruption for allegedly embezzling
NT$14.8 million from the president's discretionary "state affairs
fund."
</P>
<P>
Wu was absent from Friday's court hearing. She has missed four
days of hearing since falling ill during the court's first
session on Dec. 15.
</P>
<P>
President Chen himself is immune from prosecution while in
office, but prosecutors claimed that there is sufficient evidence
to pursue similar charges against him after he leaves office.
</P>
<P>
The lawyer-turned-president has denied any wrongdoing. But he
promised that if his wife were to be found guilty in the first
trial, he would immediately resign. "I believe that history will
return justice to me, and the judicial process will clear my
name, " he said in a Nov. 5 televised speech.
</P>
<P>
The Presidential Office issued a press statement late Thursday
saying that the five officials have legitimate reasons to be
absent because the questions the judges intend to ask infringe
upon the president's "state secrets privilege" and may also harm
the national interests.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile,  Presidential Office Deputy Secretary-General Cho
Jung-tai said Friday that the Presidential Office would appeal
against the court fines on the five officials, including Tan Sun
Chen, the president's chief of staff, for their absence from
Friday's hearing.
