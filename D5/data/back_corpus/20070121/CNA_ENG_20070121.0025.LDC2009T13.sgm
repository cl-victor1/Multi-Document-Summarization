The Taiwan Electrical and Electronics Manufacturers Association
(TEEMA) will help domestic automobile electronics businesses beef
up their marketing outlets in Thailand and make inroads into the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) market, a TEEMA
official said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
TEEMA Secretary-General Cheng Fu-hsiung said that in view of
Thailand's central location in the Southeast Asian region and the
growing demand for information and communication technology (ICT)
products, TEEMA is seeking to integrate Taiwanese manufacturers'
car electronics marketing outlets in that country to pave the way
for the expansion of business in the region.
</P>
<P>
Starting in 2007, ASEAN member states will gradually remove
customs duties on 11 industries, including electronics,
e-commerce and automobiles, Cheng said, adding that they are also
working to open markets to foreign manufacturers wishing to
invest in their respective countries.
</P>
<P>
Noting that prices for car electronic goods and spare parts are
still quite high in Thailand, although a number of international
car electronics firms have set up factories there, Cheng claimed
this is an opportune moment for Taiwan's automobile electronics
sector to tap that market.
</P>
<P>
Cheng also disclosed that his association will continue to
sponsor a TAITRONIC show in Thailand in July this year as a
measure to help domestic manufacturers explore trade
opportunities with foreign buyers, as Taiwanese exhibitors reaped
a large number of orders at a similar event held last year in
that country.
</P>
<P>
Prior to the upcoming exhibition, TEEMA will arrange for domestic
exhibitors to hold trade consultations with potential buyers,
Cheng went on.
</P>
<P>
According to official statistics, there are some 5,000 Taiwan
companies with operations in Thailand, with investments totaling
over US$10 billion. Taiwan is Thailand's third-largest foreign
investor, behind only Japan and the United States.
</P>
<P>
Two-way Taiwan-Thailand trade amounts to approximately US$6
billion  per year, with trade  in electronics  products  and
computer-related business growing steadily every year.
