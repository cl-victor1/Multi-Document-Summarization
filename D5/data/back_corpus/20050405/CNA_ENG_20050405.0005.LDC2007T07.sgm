GERMAN CHANCELLOR URGED NOT TO SUPPORT LIFTING OF E.U. ARMS SALES BAN

Berlin,  April 4 (CNA) (By Y.L. Lin and P.C.Tang)

The German Green Party on Monday urged German Chancellor Gerhard
Schroeder not to continue to work for a lifting of the European
Union's arms embargo against China, pointing to Beijing's enactment of
the Anti-Secession Law and its human rights problems.
</P>
<P>
Claudia Roth, chairwoman of the German Green Party, which is part of
the German coalition government, said after a meeting with other
leaders of the party that China's Anti-Secession Law and its
aggressive manner toward Taiwan do not qualify it to request that the
E.U. lift its arms sales ban.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, lifting the arms embargo against China would send the
"wrong message" as China continues to have serious human rights
problems, including harming the interests of ethnic minorities and
excessive use of the death penalty, Roth said.
</P>
<P>
Roth added that she believes that German Foreign Minister Joschka
Fischer, also from the Green Party, will advise Schroeder not to
support a lifting of the ban.
</P>
<P>
Emphasizing that the purpose of the E.U.'s China policy is to support
democratization in China and to avoid regional dispute, Roth said that
a lifting of the arms embargo would not help promote democracy and
instead, would only worsen the situation.
</P>
<P>
Schroeder has reiterated recently that his stance in support of a
lifting of the arms sales ban remains unchanged despite opposition
from most of the German lawmakers.
