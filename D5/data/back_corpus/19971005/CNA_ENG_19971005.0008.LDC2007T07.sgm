TAIWANESE STAR PITCHER TO RETIRE FROM JAPANESE PRO-BASEBALL
</HEADLINE>

Tokyo,  Oct.  5  (CNA) (By Sofia Wu)
</P>
<P>
Taiwanese star pitcher Kuo Tai-yuan will retire from Japan's Seibu
Lions professional baseball team at the end of this baseball season.
</P>
<P>
Kuo, who used to be nicknamed "Eastern Express" for his speed, gave
his farewell pitching Sunday in a match with the Daiei team. An
emotional Kuo, accompanined by his wife Chang Chun-chih, a former
television actress, and their daughter, bade farewell to tens of
thousands of his fans at the end of the game.
</P>
<P>
Though Seibu lost to Daiei in the Sunday match, the team was already
certain to win this year's championship in the Pacific League on
Friday. It will vie for the national title with the Central League
champion team Yakult starting on Oct. 18.
</P>
<P>
Kuo, 36, joined Seibu in 1985 after representing the Republic of China
on Taiwan in many regional and international baseball contests. He
played a leading role in helping the ROC team win a bronze medal in
the 1984 Los Angeles Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
During his nearly 13 years with Seibu, Kuo recorded 117 wins, 68
losses and 18 reliefs. During the period, Seibu won eight Pacific
League championships.
</P>
<P>
Kuo has set many outstanding records over the past 13 years, including
pitching a no-hit, no-run perfect match in 1985. He has also won many
awards, including a Pacific League MVP award in 1991.
</P>
<P>
Kuo decided to retire because of his age and an old wound to his right
hand, which has affected his performance in the past two seasons.
</P>
<P>
Kuo earned more than 1 billion Japanese yen (about NT$260.3 million)
during his stint with Seibu.
</P>
<P>
Kuo and his wife are scheduled to return to Taiwan in mid-November. He
is expected to continue his baseball career after return to his
homeland.
</P>
<P>
The Taiwan Major League, one of Taiwan's two professional baseball
leagues, reportedly intends to hire Kuo by offering an annual income
of NT$10 million. The income will include a monthly salary of
NT$500,000 plus advertisement revenues and prize money.
</P>
<P>
However, Kuo said he has yet to make a final decision on whether to
join the Taiwan Major League.
</P>
<P>
Another Taiwanese star pitcher Kuo Yuan-chih, who returned to Taiwan
last year after pitching for Japan's Central League Chunichi Dragons
team for more than 20 years, has decided to go back to Japan to serve
as a coach next year.
</P>
<P>
Kuo Yuan-chih, who plays for Taiwan's President Lions team during the
current baseball season, was disappointed by Taiwan's pro-baseball
climate. Taiwan's seven-year pro-baseball community has been troubled
by a marred image resulting from alleged involvement of some of its
players in gambling and game fixing.
