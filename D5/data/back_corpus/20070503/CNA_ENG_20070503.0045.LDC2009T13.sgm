An interdepartmental meeting will be held Friday to assess the
feasibility of granting monetary aid to local bus companies to
help them provide direct routes from downtown districts to the
bullet train system at five major hub stations, government
officials said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
According to officials of the Cabinet-level Council for Economic
Planning and Development (CEPD) , the CEPD will call a meeting
with relevant  government agencies,  including  the  Ministry  of
Transportation and Communications, the Ministry of Finance, the
Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics (DGBAS),
the Taiwan High Speed Railway Corp. (THSRC) and local governments
to assess the issue.
</P>
<P>
The CEPD has targeted nine bus routes in the Taoyuan, Hsinchu,
Taichung, Chiayi and Tainan areas to provide local bus operators
with financial assistance -- some NT$30 million to each route per
year, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
But they added that bus companies must agree to adopt direct
routes swift enough to take THSRC travelers from the bullet-train
stations, usually in suburban areas, to city centers within 30
minutes as a pre-condition to receiving government subsidies.
</P>
<P>
Local bus transportation service in the five areas is currently
so poor that it takes nearly one hour to transport travelers from
the THSRC train stations to the downtown area due to meandering
routes drawn up in an effort to take on more passengers --
significantly offsetting the advantages from speedy travel with
the THSRC, the officials pointed out.
</P>
<P>
In addition to financial assistance, the CEPD officials said, the
government also has a project to integrate the transportation
networks and ticket services of the THSRC, the Taiwan Railway
Administration (TRA), and long-distance buses.
</P>
<P>
The launch of the THSRC service in Jan. this year has had a
noticeable impact on the domestic long-distance travel market,
according to DGBAS tallies.
</P>
<P>
During the first quarter, the number of journeys taken on TRA
trains dropped by 2 percent over the same period last year to 41
million, while the TRA's Q1 business revenue dwindled by 4.5
percent to NT$3.71 billion from the year earlier level, DGBAS
statistics showed.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, passengers made some 5.7 million trips on board
long-distance buses across Taiwan -- an annual decrease of 3.7
percent.
</P>
<P>
During the same three-month period, airline passengers registered
3 million arrivals and departures at domestic airports, a plunge
of 19.2 percent from the Q1 in 2006. But the figure for Taiwan
airports serving international flights grew by an annual rate of
3.3 percent to over 5 million in Q1.
