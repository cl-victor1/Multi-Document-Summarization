Seven Vietnamese men were arrested in waters off Yunlin County in
central Taiwan on suspicions of attempting to enter Taiwan
illegally, the Coast Guard Administration (CGA) reported
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
After its offshore radar detected a suspicious boat in Taiwan's
waters some four nautical miles off Mailiao Harbor, Yunlin
County, the CGA sent a cutter and a patrol vessel to the scene.

<P>
Coast guard forces intercepted the unregistered sampan and
boarded the vessel. On board, they discovered the Vietnamese men,
who admitted that they had planned to work in Taiwan. The case
has been turned over to the Yunlin Prosecutors Office.

<P>
The CGA officials said that this is the third time in less than
one month that the coast guard has intercepted Vietnamese men
trying to enter the country illegally. On the previous occasions,
Vietnamese men were nabbed in waters off Mailiao Harbor and Putai
Harbor in Chiayi, southern Taiwan.

<P>
The officials asked the public to report any activities involving
illegal immigration, trafficking, or harm to the local marine
ecology via the hot line "118" for the sake of law and order.
