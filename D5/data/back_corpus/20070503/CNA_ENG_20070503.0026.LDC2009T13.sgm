<P>
Vaccine against enterovirus 71 (EV71) has proved effective in
testing on rodents and rabbits, providing protection coverage of
85 percent, the Center for Disease Control (CDC) announced
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
CDC officials predicted that after completing another series of
animal experiments, the vaccine would soon enter the stage of
clinical testing on humans and then mass production.
</P>
<P>
An outbreak of EV71 in 1998 claimed the lives of 78 children,
prompting the CDC to embark on research and development of an
EV71 vaccine.
</P>
<P>
Liu Ding-ping, director of the CDC's Vaccine Center, noted that
the CDC vaccine is the first successful one of its kind. However,
due to limitations in the CDC's research capacity, the center has
decided to transfer its findings to the National Health Research
Institute to continue the R&amp;D.
</P>
<P>
Liu also reported that the EV71 vaccine is currently based on the
local EV71 virus strain and that the research team has decided to
introduce strains found elsewhere in Southeast Asia to provide
wider coverage.
