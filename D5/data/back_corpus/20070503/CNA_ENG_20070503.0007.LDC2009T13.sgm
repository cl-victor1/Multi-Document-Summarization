MARRIAGE REMIANS AS MAJOR REASON FOR WOMEN QUITTING JOBS: NEW
BOOK
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

Taipei,  May 3 (CNA) 05/03/07  12:16:58 (By Sofia Wu)

<P>
Marriage remains as one of the major reasons for women bowing out
of the job market, with about 30 percent of local women in
various age groups choosing to stay home full time after getting
married, according to a newly published book on women's issues.
</P>
<P>
The "Taiwan Women Yearbook -- first edition, " published by the
government- funded  Foundation  for Women's Rights Promotion and
Development, said the percentage of working women who quit the
job market after marriage is closely related with education
level.
</P>
<P>
Quoting official tallies, the book stated that the ratio of
Taiwan women who quit their jobs after marriage is 46 percent
among those who have only received the compulsory nine year's of
education or less, compared to 35 percent among senior high
school graduates and 16 percent among those who have received
university degrees.
</P>
<P>
Regardless of education level, over 60 percent of women who have
quit their jobs because of marriage have never returned to the
job market, according to the yearbook.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a ceremony marking the launch of the new book, Yu
Mei-nu, a lawyer and long-time women's rights activist,
attributed to the lower rate of return to job among well-educated
women to a combination of factors,  including better financial
status and reluctance to take up undesirable jobs.
</P>
<P>
According to the yearbook, the steady upgrading of Taiwan's
education levels has not necessarily contributed to an increase
in the women's labor force participation rate. In 1987, the
women's labor participation rate reached 46.5 percent but then
gradually slid to range between 44 percent and 45 percent.
</P>
<P>
The downward trend reversed in 2002 when the women's labor force
participation rate rose to 46.6 percent before hitting a new high
of 48.1 percent in 2005, according to the yearbook.
</P>
<P>
In 2005, the number of working women was about 4.35 million, up a
mere 1.6 percent from the level 20 years earlier, according to
the yearbook. During the same year, the labor force participation
rate among men dropped to a new low of 67.6 percent, down a full
10 percent from 1981.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the yearbook said, the labor force participation rate
among married women was about 47.9 percent in 2005, roughly the
same as the level recorded in 1996 when the rate was 47.1
percent.
</P>
<P>
"All these figures indicate that the ratio of women who continue
to work after marriage has remained almost unchanged over the
past decade, " Yu said, adding that the trend demonstrates that
the government has not done enough to encourage married women to
return to the job market.
</P>
<P>
The Taiwan Women Yearbook is the first of its kind ever published
in Taiwan. It collates significant developments and changes in
Taiwan women's rights and gender equality, including difficulties
confronted and progress made by both the government and women's
rights advocacy groups.
</P>
<P>
The book was compiled by the Foundation for Women's Rights
Promotion and Development with the assistance of major women's
rights activist groups to mark the 10th founding anniversary of
the Commission on the Promotion of Women's Rights under the
Executive Yuan.
</P>
<P>
The yearbook contains three sections dedicated  to age-sex
structure, government policy and legislation on women's rights
and gender equality, as well as the development of private
women's rights advocacy groups and their contributions to the
promotion of women's rights and gender mainstreaming over the
past decade.
