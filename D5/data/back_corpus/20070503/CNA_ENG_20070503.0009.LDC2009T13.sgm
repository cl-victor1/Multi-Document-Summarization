The Environmental Protection Administration (EPA) is planning to
fine motorists and motorcyclists a minimum of NT$5,000 (US$150)
for not turning off their engines when making temporary stops of
more than three minutes, an EPA official said Thursday.

Chuang Hsun-cheng, a section chief of the EPA's Department of Air
Quality Protection and Noise Control, said that a study has shown
that if the motorists and motorcyclists fail to turn off their
engines when making temporary stops for an accumulated 30 minutes
per day, they will spend an additional NT$18,000 on gasoline and
produce 1.4 tons of carbon dioxide per year.
</P>
<P>
In a bid to cut gasoline consumption  and carbon dioxide
emissions, the EPA is planning to launch a campaign July 1 to
advise motorists and motorcyclists to turn off their engines when
making temporary stops, Chuang said.

<P>
Starting from Jan. 1, 2006, if the motorists and motorcyclists do
not turn off their engines when they stop for more than three
minutes, they will face a fine of between NT$5,000 and
NT$100,000.

He noted that Japan and several European countries have similar
rules in place.

Several scenic spots in the cities of Taipei, Taichung and
Tainan, as well as the counties of Taoyuan, Taichung, Yilan and
Hualien have also implemented the measure on a trial basis but
have yet to begin imposing fines, he added.
</P>
<P>
The EPA will invite  the Ministry  of Transportation  and
Communications (MOTC) as well as local environmental protection
officials later the same day to exchange views on the measure, to
be followed by presentations and public hearings.
</P>
<P>
"There is already a public consensus that greenhouse  gas
emissions should be cut," Chuang said.
</P>
<P>
He said the new measure should not pose too big a problem for
motorists, noting that the proposal by the EPA excludes specific
situations, such as traffic jams, and certain types of vehicles,
such as fire engines, ambulances and SNG vehicles for the live
television broadcasts.
