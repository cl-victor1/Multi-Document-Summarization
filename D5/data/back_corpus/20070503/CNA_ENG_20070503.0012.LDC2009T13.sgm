Taipei,  May  3 (CNA) 05/03/07  15:09:10 (By Y.F. Low)
</P>
<P>
The government has launched an online petition campaign to
promote the country's bid to enter the World Health Organization
(WHO) , Government Information Office (GIO) officials said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The petition titled "Say Yes to Taiwan's Bid to WHO" has been
posted on the free online petitions Web site gopetition.com, and
people are urged to visit the site to sign in support, GIO
officials said.
</P>
<P>
With the appearance of new diseases, such as avian flu, SARS and
AIDS, the exclusion of Taiwan from the WHO has resulted in a
serious gap in the global public health protection network, they
pointed out, adding that the situation not only endangers the
lives and safety of people in Taiwan but also people in the rest
of the world.
</P>
<P>
They said the people of Taiwan must let their voices be heard by
the world regardless of whether the country will succeed in
joining the WHO this year.
</P>
<P>
After failing in its decade-long effort to take part as an
observer  in the World Health Assembly --  the WHO's highest
decision-making body, Taiwan is applying to become a full member
of the organization under the name of "Taiwan" this year.
</P>
<P>
Gopetition.com  is a non-profit  platform for international
petitions, with more than 70,000 petition drives in 75 countries
currently being conducted at the Web site, according to the GIO.
