Vice President Annette Lu said Thursday that there is still ample
room for Taiwan to develop its tourism industry, voicing the hope
that the sector's future development will highlight "happiness,
heath, beauty and culture."
</P>
<P>
Lu made the remarks while addressing the opening ceremony of the
2007 Kaohsiung International Travel Fair, which will run through
May 6 at the Kaohsiung Business Exhibition Center under the
auspices of the Kaohsiung Association of Travel agents.
</P>
<P>
As an initiator of the Taiwan tourism industrial alliance, Lu
said she will seek to integrate the efforts of domestic medical
and tourism sectors to jointly promote the so-called "medical
tourism" in order to bring health and beauty to incoming
tourists, especially those coming from China.
</P>
<P>
Lu also called for domestic travel agencies to arrange more
Taiwanese native culture-exploring tours for Chinese tourists so
that they  can gain a better understanding  of Taiwan's  cultural
development.
</P>
<P>
In the face of increasingly serious global warming, tourism,
which has been described as a non-smokestack industry, is worthy
of development, the vice president stressed.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the same occasion, former Premier Hsieh, who is also
vying for the ruling Democratic Progressive Party's nomination
for the 2008 presidential race, voiced the hope that he will have
the opportunity to help Kaohsiung build a large scale exhibition
hall capable of accommodating 1,000 booths.
</P>
<P>
According to organizers, a total of 318 booths have been set up
during the three-day exhibition to attract prospective tourists,
including 39 booths run by foreign tourism institutions in
Taiwan, and 190 booths representing local amusement areas,
according to Huang.
</P>
<P>
Among those taking part in the fair are local governments from
around the country, local travel agencies, hotel operators,
foreign tourism organizations, as well as domestic and foreign
theme parks and other travel-related sectors.
