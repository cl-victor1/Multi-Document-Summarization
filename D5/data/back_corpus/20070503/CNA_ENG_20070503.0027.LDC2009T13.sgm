OPENING UP TO CHINESE STUDENTS COULD DILUTE EDUCATIONAL RESOURCES

Although China welcomes Taiwan's higher educational institutions
to recruit students in China, the government has to consider  the
idea that such an opening could dilute educational resources in
Taiwan, government officials said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The officials made the remarks at a seminar on the opening and
strengthening of cross-Taiwan Strait exchanges in educational and
cultural activities convened by the legislative caucus of the
opposition Kuomintang.
</P>
<P>
The officials' words came amid a recent cross-strait forum during
which Chinese officials said they would welcome Taiwan's colleges
and universities seeking to recruit students there.
</P>
<P>
Liu Teh-hsun, vice chairman of the Mainland Affairs Council, said
exchanges between the higher educational institutions on both
sides of the Taiwan Strait are already very frequent.
</P>
<P>
He said that the opening up of Taiwan to Chinese students would
help relieve the pressure on local colleges to recruit enough
students and would help Chinese students enhance their
understanding of Taiwan's pluralistic and democratic way of life.
</P>
<P>
But Liu also said that such opening would not only involve
problems in the academic area but would also involve issues of
living, regulations, follow-up status and working, which would
require the revision of existing regulations, as well as intra-
agency coordination.
</P>
<P>
KMT lawmakers, however, disputed his views.
</P>
<P>
KMT Legislator Lee Chi-chu said that the government's worries are
unwarranted, noting that other countries do not worry that Taiwan
students will dilute their educational resources when they study
in their countries.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan's too-numerous private colleges and universities will only
be able to stay afloat if they can recruit Chinese students, she
predicted.
</P>
<P>
She criticized the government for saying it must consider various
factors and studying complementary measures, and added that if
the government is unwilling to open because of ideological
concerns, it should say so directly.
</P>
<P>
KMT Legislator Lu Hsiu-yen suggested that the government should
allow only Chinese students who are wealthy or talented to study
in Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Her colleague Hung Hsiu-chu said the government has always said
it fears the "united front strategy" and the "brainwashing"
approach by China and added that this is a good chance to get
even by doing the same thing to Chinese students.
</P>
<P>
Vice Education Minister Lu Mu-lin said exchanges of higher
education institutions between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait
have to be conducted gradually.
</P>
<P>
He said Taiwan wants to entice good students but that it has to
upgrade the quality of its colleges first.
</P>
<P>
He also pointed out that even though the government does not
accredit diplomas conferred by China, Taiwan students studying in
China are perfectly able to return and use their qualifications
for any private sector jobs, even if they cannot take part in
examinations for public functionaries.
