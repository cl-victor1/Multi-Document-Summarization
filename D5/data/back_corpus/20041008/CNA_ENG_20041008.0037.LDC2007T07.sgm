Taipei,  Oct. 8 (CNA) (By Sofia Wu)
</P>
<P>
The new arms procurement package will help deter any possible mainland
Chinese invasion, Minister of National Defense Lee Jye said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Lee Jye made the remarks during a meeting with members of the
opposition Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU) legislative caucus as part of
his efforts to lobby the party's support for the NT$610.8 billion arms
procurement budget bill.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, TSU lawmakers asked Lee about his views on
Academia Sinica President Lee Yuan-tseh's remarks a day earlier that
the arms package is too expensive and that it's a pity that the
government has to spend such a large amount to purchase weapons from
the United States.
</P>
<P>
In response, Lee Jye said he above others does not want to see the two
sides of the Taiwan Strait go to war and earnestly looks forward to
maintaining permanent peace in the region.
</P>
<P>
Lee Jye, an admiral-turned-minister, said he is convinced that so long
as Taiwan can acquire the new arms, mainland China will refrain from
invading Taiwan because doing so would be very costly.
</P>
<P>
According to a computer war game simulation, Lee Jye said mainland
China would have to sacrifice two-thirds to four-fifths of its troops
if it were to attack Taiwan after the island obtains the new arms.
</P>
<P>
The package includes eight diesel-electric submarines, a squadron of
12 P-3C anti-submarine aircraft and six PAC III Patriot anti-missile
batteries.
