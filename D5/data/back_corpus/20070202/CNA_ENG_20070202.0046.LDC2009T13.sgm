A total of 271 artifacts collected by the British Museum, valued
at more than NT$5 billion, will be exhibited in the National
Palace Museum (NPM) from Feb. 4 to May 27, the NPM announced in a
press conference Friday.
</P>
<P>
The exhibition, "Treasures of the World's Cultures: The British
Museum after 250 years", brings these historical relics from the
U.K. to Taiwan for the first time and will be a part of
celebrations marking the reopening of the NPM, which is entering
its 80th year, NPM Director Lin Mun-lee said.
</P>
<P>
"We are expecting a very exciting week. Following the Grand View,
this exhibition will be one of the most important events for the
NPM this year," Lin said. Grand View is an exhibition of
painting, calligraphy and Ju Ware of the Northern Sung Dynasty.
</P>
<P>
The NPM has designed three different visiting plans with time
spans of 30, 60 and 120 minutes to cover the top 10, 20 and 42
recommended artifacts, which include items from different eras
and regions of pre-history, Mesopotamia, ancient Egypt, ancient
Greece, early Europe, Medieval Europe and the Renaissance. The
display area, which is located in the Library Building, will be
separated into 13 zones, according to the time period and place
of origin.
</P>
<P>
Among the ten most notable items are The Unlucky Mummy wooden
mummy-board, Queen Puabe's Lyre, Statuette of Hermes, Bust of the
Emperor Hadrian, Bust of Antinous, and a cast gold pectoral of a
chief or priest in South America.
</P>
<P>
The exhibition is important for the British Museum not only
because it takes place in Taiwan for the first time, but also
because the displayed items reflect humanity's achievements from
both the past and present, said Andrew Burnett, Deputy Director
of the British Museum.
</P>
<P>
Starting from Feb. 3, the NPM will also be holding its first NPM
Outdoors arts festival. The festival has invited world-renowned
performing groups, such as Japanese national treasure "Noh
Theatre, " and Ming Hwa Yuan Taiwanese Opera Troupe, the Ju
Percussion Group and the U-Theatre Group.
</P>
<P>
Noh Theatre master Umewaka Rokuro will share with the public a
suspenseful performance of The Lion and widely-acclaimed
Concubine Yang, produced by samisen master Yoshizumi Kosayo.
</P>
<P>
The performances will be held outdoors and are open to the public
free of charge to allow visitors the opportunity to come face-to-
face with these famous performing groups.
