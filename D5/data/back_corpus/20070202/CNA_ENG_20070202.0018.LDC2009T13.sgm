<P>
Popular kung fu novelist Jin Yong, whose knight-errant novels
have been devoured by Chinese people around the world, appeared
at the Taipei International Book Fair Friday to sign autographs
for fans.
</P>
<P>
In his first appearance at a book fair in Taiwan, the 83-year-old
Jin Yong was awaited by a long queue of fans aged from six to 70
seeking his autograph.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai-born Jin Yong -- Hong Kong's most eminent man of letters
whose real name is Dr. Louis Cha -- signed some 400 copies of his
novels over a one-hour period.
</P>
<P>
Jin Yong, who has written 15 best-selling martial arts novels, is
in Taipei mainly to meet his mentor at Cambridge University --
Dr. David McMullen -- who is currently in Taiwan doing research
at Academia Sinica.
</P>
<P>
He was also scheduled to dine with National Chengchi University
(NCU) President Wu Si-hua, who will tell him the NCU is preparing
to confer an honorary doctorate on him in recognition of his
outstanding long-term contribution to Chinese-language writing
and literature.
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, the last day of his visit, Jin Yong will accompany
McMullen on a visit to the National Palace Museum, to see a Sung-
dynasty ceramics exhibition and a special exhibition on loan from
the British Museum.
</P>
<P>
Jin Yong last visited Taipei in September 2005, when he attended
a ceremony marking the launch of the "Jin Yong credit card"
issued by Taiwan's Yuan Liou Publishing Co., which publishes most
of his kung fu novels in Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Most of his martial arts novels have been adapted for film and
television.
</P>
<P>
The soft-spoken, quintessentially Chinese man is renowned not
only as the author of 15 kung fu novels but as a veteran
reporter, publisher and political commentator.  He founded the
Ming Pao newspaper and its sister publications.
</P>
<P>
He is considered one of the best and most prolific Chinese
novelists of the modern era. But his 15 novels, written between
1955 and 1972, are more than just kung fu stories. Their pages
burst with fantastic knight-errant tales of heroic swordsmen and
beautiful heroines, intermingling romance, tragedy and comedy
with Chinese and religious values.
</P>
<P>
Universities around the Chinese-speaking world have formed Jin
Yong fan clubs, sponsored seminars or opened classes on his
classic novels, in which, Chinese readers can immerse themselves
in their cultural heritage from the language, calligraphy, art,
music, traditional costumes, cuisine and martial arts that they
find in the novels. Traditional Chinese culture, fantasy and
history form the colorful backdrops for his works.
