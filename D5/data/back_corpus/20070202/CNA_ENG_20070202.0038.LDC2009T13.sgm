CEC DENIES HIGH NUMBER OF CONTENTIOUS VOTES IN 2004 ELECTION
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  Feb. 2 (CNA) 02/02/07  20:10:54 (By Lilian Wu)

<P>
Central Election Commission (CEC) officials denied Friday that as
many as five contentious ballots were found in each polling
station on average in a recount of the 2004 presidential
election.
</P>
<P>
The officials said the Kaohsiung District Court's claim of the
high number was far from the truth.
</P>
<P>
They noted that there were 13,749 polling stations nationwide in
the 2004 presidential election and that there were 40,570
contentious ballots.
</P>
<P>
But in a recount ordered by the Supreme Court, those that were
actually calculated wrongly totaled only 3,955 votes, averaging
0.288 votes per polling station.
</P>
<P>
The officials said the number of contentious votes was high
mainly because of a change in the election rules that year that
stated the stamp on a candidate had to be confined to a rectangle
on the top of the candidate to be counted valid.
</P>
<P>
The actual number of incorrect ballots numbered only 3,955, with
the remaining 36,615 the result of lawyers representing the two
parties using their litigation skills to argue that they were
controversial when in fact they were not.
</P>
<P>
They said the recount did not sway the election outcome, which
saw President Chen Shui-bian win by a little more than 25,000
votes against his rival, Lien Chan of the main opposition
Kuomintang.
</P>
<P>
The CEC made the statement after the Kaohsiung District Court
granted a request for a recount by defeated Kaohsiung mayoral
candidate Huang Chun-ying of the KMT in the Dec. 9 election, who
lost to his rival Chen Chu by a mere 1,114 votes, or 0.14 percent
of the total votes cast.
</P>
<P>
The court ruling said that based on the 2004 presidential
election recount, which found that every polling station had at
least five controversial ballots on average, debatable ballots
across Kaohsiung City's 839 polling stations could be several
times the narrow margin -- in an election that counted more than
6,000 invalid votes.
