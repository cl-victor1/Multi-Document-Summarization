Taipei, Feb. 2 (CNA) 02/02/07  16:45:16 (By Lilian Wu)

<P>
Minister of Economic Affairs Steve Ruey-long Chen said Friday
that the ministry is planning to change the name of Chinese
Petroleum Corp. (CPC) by adding "Taiwan" at the front of the
name.
</P>
<P>
Chen said the name-change will be in line with the government's
"name- rectification" policy for state-owned enterprises to avoid
people mistaking Taiwanese companies for Chinese ones.
</P>
<P>
It will also bring substantial benefits for the future operations
of the state- owned enterprises, Chen claimed.
</P>
<P>
He noted that as the name Taiwan Petroleum Corp. has already been
claimed and registered, the CPC will have to use another name.
The CPC will become the first state-owned enterprise under the
ministry to highlight Taiwan in its name, he added.
</P>
<P>
The MOEA is also scheduled to announce next week whether other
state-owned enterprises under the ministry will also have their
names changed.
</P>
<P>
President Chen Shui-bian first instructed in December 2004 that
the names of all institutes that could be mistaken for Chinese
institutes should be changed, starting with state-owned
enterprises.
</P>
<P>
The Executive Yuan restarted the discussion on the matter
recently and the Central Standing Committee of the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party also urged state-owned enterprises
that have "Chinese" in their names to change their names as soon
as possible.
