KAOHSIUNG MAYORAL VOTE RECOUNT NECESSARY: KMT LAWMAKERS
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,   Feb.  2  (CNA) 02/02/07  17:01:21 (By Flor Wang)

<P>
The legislative caucus of the main opposition Kuomintang (KMT)
hailed Friday a Kaohsiung District Court ruling that a vote
recount is necessary for the Dec. 9 mayoral election in southern
Kaohsiung city.
</P>
<P>
KMT legislative caucus members at a Legislative Yuan news
conference said that they are set to initiate a law revision at
the legislature to legalize "an automatic vote recount mechanism"
to deal with similar cases in the future, as is the case in most
advanced countries.
</P>
<P>
The Kaohsiung District Court ruled that the recount should begin
from March 12 following a month-long probe, after Huang Chun-
ying, the defeated KMT candidate, filed a suit with the court
demanding that it nullify the election and invalidate the victory
of Chen Chu -- incumbent mayor of the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party.
</P>
<P>
Huang lost to Chen by a slim margin of 1,114 votes, or 0.14
percent of the total ballots. There were more than 6,000 invalid
votes in the election.
</P>
<P>
KMT Legislator Hung Hsiu-chu said that the KMT legislative caucus
will propose a law amendment to allow for an automatic vote
recount if there is only a difference between 1 percent and 2
percent between election winners and losers.
</P>
<P>
KMT Legislator Alex Fei said that a vote recount is required to
serve justice and safeguard democratic values, and he urged Chen
to face the consequences.
</P>
<P>
The Huang camp accused Chen's camp of making public a suspicious
but unconfirmed videotape on the eve of the election showing a
man purported to be a Huang supporter buying votes aboard a bus.
</P>
<P>
Huang ascribed his election defeat to the release of the
videotape and alleged that the Chen camp orchestrated the
incident.
