WANTED REBAR GROUP HEAD, WIFE ARRIVE IN SINGAPORE

Taipei,  Feb.  2 (CNA) 02/02/07  12:02:48 (By Deborah Kuo)

Rebar Asia Pacific Group founder Wang You-theng and his wife, who
have been placed on Taiwan's most-wanted list, reportedly arrived
at Singapore's Changi Airport Friday morning after leaving the
United States the previous day.
</P>
<P>
Officials from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs have been in close
contact with the Singaporean authorities and have been kept
abreast of all the latest developments surrounding the Wangs, who
allegedly embezzled billions of dollars in corporate funds before
going on the lam.
</P>
<P>
The Wangs fled to China late last year after two of the group's
120-odd member companies applied for insolvency restructuring.
The fallout triggered a run on the Chinese Bank, another of the
group's affiliates. Subsequent judicial investigations found that
the couple and other family members and corporate executives were
involved in many suspected irregularities, including fraud,
embezzlement, breach of trust and insider trading.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Minister  James Huang has canceled  all activities
scheduled for Friday morning and early afternoon to be ready for
a possible repatriation of the Wangs back to Taiwan during the
day.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a CNA reporter stationed in Singapore reported that
Taiwan's judicial authorities and liaison officials posted in the
city-state have been locked in intensive negotiations with the
Singaporean immigration authorities over the Wangs' repatriation.
</P>
<P>
The Singaporean authorities reportedly said Friday morning that
there are no reasons for them to take the Wangs into custody as
the couple used authentic passports and normal travel papers for
their entrance.
</P>
<P>
Besides,  since Taiwan and Singapore  maintain no judicial
assistance accord, the Singaporean authorities may not respond to
Taiwan's request for the Wangs to be repatriated, according to
local law enforcement officials.
</P>
<P>
If the Wangs are not repatriated back to Taiwan, it is possible
that the Singaporean authorities may send them back to the United
States, according to the officials.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, David Ta-wei Lee, Taiwan's representative to the
United States, confirmed Thursday that U.S. authorities had twice
informed his office of the couple's departure from Los Angeles at
11 p.m. Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. officials said the couple were heading for Myanmar.
They, however, would not elaborate on whether the couple left the
United States out of their own decision or under pressure from
U.S. judicial authorities, according to Lee.
