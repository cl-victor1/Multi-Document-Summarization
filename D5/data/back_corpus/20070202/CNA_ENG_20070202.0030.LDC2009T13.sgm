FORMER TAIPEI MAYOR CLAIMS HE IS CLEAN, TRUSTS IN JUDICIARY
</HEADLINE>

Taipei, Feb. 2 (CNA) 02/02/07  18:42:56 (By Flor Wang)
</P>
<P>
Main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Ma Ying-jeou claimed
Friday that his name is clean and said that he looks forward to a
fair judgment by the judiciary in a case related to his alleged
misuse of special municipal fees while serving as mayor of
Taipei.
</P>
<P>
Ma made the remarks while answering questions from reporters
after it was widely speculated that the KMT chairman, who ended
his eight-year mayoral term last December, might be indicted by
Feb. 9 on charges of embezzling the special municipal funds
earmarked for his discretionary use.
</P>
<P>
Claiming that he is clean and that he only followed the Executive
Yuan's regulations in claiming reimbursement from the special
mayoral discretionary fund, Ma, however, said that he is unable
to predict what will happen in the future and added that he has
made full preparations for all kinds of possible scenarios.
</P>
<P>
Ma, who is widely assumed to be the "pan-blue alliance's" best
bet for the 2008 presidential election, also thanked the public
for their concern over the case.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, it was reported that KMT Honorary Chairman Lien Chan,
Ma's predecessor, is very likely to serve as the party's chairman
again if Ma steps down from the party's top post over a possible
indictment.
</P>
<P>
Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng, a KMT heavyweight, was
reluctant to comment on the issue, while Lee Hung-chun, a
spokesman for the People First Party (PFP) -- the KMT's ally in
the opposition "pan-blue alliance" -- said that his party will
rally behind Ma and the KMT and called for a fair handling of the
case.
</P>
<P>
But Lee said that the PFP will respect the KMT as to who will
take over the party's helm should Ma resign.
</P>
<P>
KMT Secretary-General Wu Den-yih cited a notification issued Aug.
5, 1981 by the Ministry of Justice that he said proves Ma is
innocent, as according to the ministry, "half of the special
funds allocated for government agency heads are for their
discretionary use and not subject to scrutiny by the relevant
authorities."
</P>
<P>
Ma did nothing wrong with the funds, Wu claimed.
