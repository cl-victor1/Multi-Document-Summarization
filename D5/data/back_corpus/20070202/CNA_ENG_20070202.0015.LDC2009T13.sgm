FUTURE TAIWAN PRESIDENT NEEDS TO STRENGTHEN U.S. TIES: EX-PREMIER
</HEADLINE>

Washington,  Feb.  1 (CNA) 02/02/07  14:27:44 (By Chiehyu Lin and
Y.F. Low)

<P>
Mending and strengthening Taiwan's relations with the United
States will be an important mission of the next president of
Taiwan, Premier Frank Hsieh said here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
According to Hsieh, Taiwan must maintain its credibility while
dealing with the international community, and this can be
achieved through frequent communication.
</P>
<P>
Taking U.S. concern over Taiwan's plan to reform its Constitution
as an example, Hsieh said the key point in this issue is whether
Taiwan has communicated effectively with the United States and
emphasized that "it is consistent with the interests of the
United States and of the world for Taiwan to practice democracy."
</P>
<P>
Hsieh said that Taiwan's democracy is a soft power with strong
appeal to the Chinese people and that Taiwan's success
demonstrates that full democracy can be achieved in Chinese
societies.
</P>
<P>
Hsieh, who is in Washington, D.C. to attend the National Prayer
Breakfast, made the remarks in response to questions by Taiwan
reporters after the event.
</P>
<P>
Hsieh said he is seriously considering whether to run for the
presidency in 2008 and what he can do for the country if he is
elected.
</P>
<P>
Pointing out that one of the purposes of his U.S. trip is to
listen to the opinions of various sectors in the United States,
Hsieh said the manners displayed by U.S. politicians of different
partisan affiliations at the National Prayer Breakfast has
demonstrated the idea of "reconciliation and coexistence" that he
advocates.
</P>
<P>
Although the politicians might not agree with President George W.
Bush, they all stood up and clapped to welcome the the
president's arrival, which strikes a sharp contrast with the
situation in Taiwan in which political rivals treat each other as
the enemy, Hsieh said.
</P>
<P>
Asked to comment on former President Lee Teng-hui's recent
remarks that "it's wrong for Taiwan to pursue independence
because it is already an independent country, " which has drawn
strong criticism from pro-independence supporters that Lee is
giving up on his pursuit of independence for Taiwan, Hsieh said
he thinks the main point that Lee was trying to convey is that
"Taiwan has already achieved independence."
</P>
<P>
Hsieh said this point is consistent with his own belief and the
stance of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party.
</P>
<P>
According to Hsieh, the status quo of Taiwan is that it is a
sovereign, independent state, and the Constitution that was
drafted under a "one China" framework is a problem that the
country is facing.
</P>
<P>
Urging the public to pay more attention to the contribution made
by Lee to Taiwan's democratic development, Hsieh stressed that
Lee played a crucial role in turning Taiwan into a democratic
nation with the least social costs.
</P>
<P>
As to whether he has any plans to visit China before the
presidential election, Hsieh said he does not intend to do so in
light of the distrustful atmosphere in Taiwan politics, in which
every politician visiting China is stigmatized as a colluder with
the Chinese communists.
