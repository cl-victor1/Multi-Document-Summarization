LOCAL GOVERNMENTS URGED TO INCREASE MANPOWER TO PREVENT CHILD
ABUSE

Taipei,  Feb. 2 (CNA) 02/02/07  12:33:49 (By Sofia Wu)
</P>
<P>
City and county governments should fill job vacancies at their
social work divisions in order to better protect children from
abuse and provide them with useful services to enhance their
well-being, a Ministry of the Interior (MOI) official said
Friday.
</P>
<P>
According to the official, the MOI implemented a special program
last year to offer direct financial subsidies to local
governments for employing  more trained  social workers  to help
children experiencing difficulties or at high risk of falling
victim to violence or filicide-suicide.
</P>
<P>
Besides providing 40 percent of the funds needed for recruiting
up to 320 social workers specializing in protecting children
around the country from abuse, the central government has also
lifted unnecessary restrictions and cut red tape to facilitate
recruitment of trained social workers.
</P>
<P>
After eight months of intensive efforts, the official said, a
total of 303 qualified caseworkers have been employed in various
cities and counties.
</P>
<P>
However, the official said, 17 positions remain unfilled, with
Hsinchu and Changhua counties each having four vacant posts.
</P>
<P>
Under the government's new "Mega Warmth" project, the MOI has
also pledged full financial support for local governments to
employ more professional social workers or caseworkers to help
high-risk families, particularly those with abused or neglected
children.
</P>
<P>
As of the end of January, the official said, 22 caseworker
positions under the "Mega Warmth" project remained unfilled,
adding that the southern city of Kaohsiung has six openings and
that the northern county of Taipei has five vacancies,
</P>
<P>
"We hope local governments can speed up social work manpower
recruitment so that their social affairs agencies will no longer
be understaffed and overworked and can be better equipped to
protect children from abuse and filicide-suicide, " the official
said, adding that city mayors and county magistrates should pay
more heed to child abuse problems in their districts and take
active steps to address them.
</P>
<P>
According to tallies released by the Child Welfare League
Foundation, 17 children died from abuse last year, and four more
abused kids died last month alone. If this year's rate continues
-- four deaths in a single month -- it would prove an even
deadlier year for children, a foundation spokeswoman said.
</P>
<P>
The foundation has provided social services to 1,168 high-risk
families since 2004. Amid an economic slowdown, the spokeswoman
said, 71 percent of those families were in financial straits,
with 52 percent of the parents lacking basic fiscal discipline
and management skills. Worse still, 55 percent of parents were
battling chronic diseases, and 72 percent suffered from
depression.
</P>
<P>
The children growing up in those families were also not faring
well. About 50 percent of the 2,000-plus children who the
foundation cared for were malnourished, and one-third of them
were in poor health,  the spokeswoman  said, adding  that the
foundation's caseworkers have been working hard in the hopes of
making a difference.
