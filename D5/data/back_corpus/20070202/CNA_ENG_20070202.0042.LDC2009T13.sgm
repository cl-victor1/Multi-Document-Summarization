The government aims to have Taiwanese-grown fruit take 20 percent
of the one- sixth domestic market share that imported fruit
currently enjoys, within the next three years, said the cabinet-
level Council of Agriculture (COA) Friday.
</P>
<P>
Su Jia-chyuan, the COA Minister, declared the goal at a news
conference to the launch a campaign promoting homegrown fruits in
the domestic market.
</P>
<P>
Annual fruit consumption in Taiwan creates a market worth around
NT$70 billion, and it's a pity that imported fruit holds one-
sixth of the market, he said, continuing that as Taiwanese fruit
enjoys the advantages of high quality and a good reputation, it
should therefore be able to recapture some of the market share
now held by foreign products.
</P>
<P>
The COA is assisting local governments of 15 major fruit-yielding
counties to set up a platform to promote the county's specialties
and facilitate direct orders from around the country, including
online orders, officials said.
</P>
<P>
They said the COA will also cooperate with farmers' associations
and retail businesses to set up sections to specially feature
homegrown fruits in some 40 supermarkets country-wide, saying the
strategy is to highlight  native products, attract consumers'
attention, and significantly boost purchases in the run-up to the
Lunar New Year, a period that traditionally brings a high demand
for agricultural goods.
</P>
<P>
Su said Taiwanese fruits have faced fierce competition from
abroad since the country joined the Word Trade Organization, and
the COA is making significant efforts to persuade domestic
consumers to buy local when shopping.
