FORMER PRESIDENT CLARIFIES HIS STANCE
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  Feb. 2 (CNA) 02/02/07  19:15:33 (By Lilian Wu)
</P>
<P>
Former President Lee Teng-hui attempted to clarify Friday several
contentious points in a recent interview with a local magazine,
claiming that reports about his forsaking Taiwan independence are
not true.
</P>
<P>
Lee's explanation came in the form of an advertisement in the
Liberty Times paid for by the opposition Taiwan Solidarity Union,
which sees Lee as its "spiritual leader." The headline of the ad
said: "Lee Teng-hui insists on rectifying the nation's name,
crafting a new constitution and establishing a normal country."
</P>
<P>
The ad came in the wake of an interview carried by the Next
magazine that quoted the former leader as saying that "I'm not a
supporter of Taiwan independence, nor have I ever advocated
Taiwan independence."
</P>
<P>
The interview dropped a bombshell on Taiwan's political scene, as
Lee, who floated a "go slow, be patient" policy regarding
investment in China and defined relations between Taiwan and
China as "special state-to-state" during his 12 years of
presidency that ended in 2000, has been nicknamed "the godfather
of Taiwan independence."
</P>
<P>
Lee said there has been no about-face, as Taiwan is already a
sovereign independent country and there is no need to advocate
the pursuit of Taiwan independence.
</P>
<P>
He noted that Taiwan has come a long way since the lifting of
martial law in 1987 and the ending of the period of mobilization
for the suppression of communist rebellion in 1991, claiming that
the popular presidential election in 1996 and the first transfer
of power between two different parties in 2000 prove that Taiwan
is a sovereign and independent country.
</P>
<P>
"Why should we engage in self-denial and backpedal for the
pursuit of independence?" he asked in the Next magazine
interview.
</P>
<P>
Lee said Taiwan has to think about amending the Constitution,
changing its name and joining the United Nations for it to become
a normal country, adding that "this has been my long-standing
stance."
</P>
<P>
He also attempted to deny that he wants to visit China, saying
that what he actually said was that some people want to invite
him to visit China, but "the current situation is not suitable."
Those who visit China, he claimed, have "power or position in
mind" and he added that he "won't do such a thing."
</P>
<P>
On the economic front, in which he was asked about his remarks on
introducing Chinese capital to Taiwan, Lee said he was only
trying to raise investment in Taiwan and attract foreign capital.
</P>
<P>
He noted that Taiwan investment in China has continued to set new
highs in recent years. Statistics compiled by the U.S. State
Department show that foreign investment in China has reached
US$560 billion and that Taiwan has accounted for half of it, or
5.6 times the general budget of the central government for 2007.
</P>
<P>
Even more alarming has been the one-sided situation, with Taiwan
continuing to pump money into China over the past two decades, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan's  economic doldrums are due to capital flight and
overreliance on China, resulting in the hollowing out of the
industry, Lee claimed, adding that the government needs to
encourage industrial development and domestic investment, as well
as the introduction of foreign capital.
</P>
<P>
He said he is not as fickle as some detractors have claimed,
adding that the society has changed a great deal and that he
naturally changes his priorities when dealing with problems.
</P>
<P>
"Right now, we only have the problem of national identity. We
should build our own Taiwan culture and not increase ethnic
division, because we're all Taiwanese in a new era," he said.
