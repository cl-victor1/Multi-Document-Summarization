The Architecture and Building Research Institute (ABRI) under the
Ministry of The Interior signed a memorandum of cooperation with
the U.S. based APA-The Engineered Wood Association Friday to
boost applications of eco-friendly wood- frame construction and
materials in Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
ABRI Director Ho Ming-chin signed the "Memorandum of Cooperation
on Wood-Framed Construction Technology" with APA's Executive Vice
President Tom Williamson at the institute's Taipei headquarters.
</P>
<P>
According to Ho, wood-frame construction is the best choice of
construction methods meeting the requirements of green building--
a construction approach that responds to global environmental and
sustainable development concerns. These requirements are measured
against several indicators in EEWH (ecology, energy savings,
waste reduction, health)--Taiwan's green building evaluation
system.

<P>
The ABRI invited AIT Taipei Office Deputy Director Robert Wang,
heads of various local architectural associations, and experts in
wood-frame construction to attend the signing ceremony.

<P>
Ho said the institute, being at the forefront of Taiwan's green
building technology  developments,  will actively  promote the
application of environmentally responsible wood-frame
construction and materials in the country following the signing
of the memorandum.
