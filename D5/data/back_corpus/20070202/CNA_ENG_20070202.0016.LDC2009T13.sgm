A job market matchmaking group under the Council of Labor Affairs
(CLA) was launched in Taichung, central Taiwan Friday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the launching ceremony, CLA Minister Lee Ying-yuan
urged the members of the new group to act as a go-between for
those looking for work and those who are short of workers to help
ease the jobless problem at the grass-roots level.
</P>
<P>
Lee said that more than 4,000 people applied to serve as the job
market matchmakers and that the CLA recruited 393 of them after a
series of tests.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that all members of the group will serve
with patience and enthusiasm and that they will go around the
island this year to visit long-term jobless people and find
suitable jobs for them to continue to cut the nation's
unemployment rate, which stood at 3.91 percent last year, marking
a six-year low.
</P>
<P>
CLA officials said that the group will work closely with
employment service centers around the country in the hopes of
reaching 100,000 jobless and helping 30,000 of them land jobs
this year.
