U.S., TAIWAN TIES GROWING STEADILY: ENVOY
</HEADLINE>

Washington,  Feb. 24 (CNA) 02/25/07  14:21:12 (By Chiehyu Lin and
Deborah Kuo)

<P>
Ties between Taiwan and the United States have been growing
steadily despite Washington's criticism of Taiwan, Republic of
China Representative to the United States David Ta-wei Lee said
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Lee said that although President George W. Bush criticized the
Taiwan leadership in 2003 and then-U.S. Secretary of State Colin
Powell described Taiwan as a "landmine"  in Washington-Beijing
relations in 2004, U.S.-Taiwan relations have been growing
steadily as U.S. criticism on Taiwan has eased off over the past
couple of years.
</P>
<P>
Lee made the remarks during a speech titled "Current Situation of
Taiwan-U.S. Ties, " at an event held in Washington,  D.C. to
commemorate the Feb. 28 Incident, which has left deep scars on
Taiwan's contemporary political history.
</P>
<P>
He said the Taiwan people must strive to retain a system of
freedom and democracy -- values that are identical to those
pursued by the U.S.
</P>
<P>
The system of freedom and democracy -- which allows the Taiwan
people to criticize the president and the government -- has above
all granted the people of Taiwan the right to choose their future
freely, according to Lee.
</P>
<P>
To defend this right, nevertheless, Taiwan must have the ability
to defend itself, he went on.
</P>
<P>
Compared with China's continuous military build-up, with its
military budget growing by double digits annually, Lee said,
Taiwan's overall defense budget for 2007 has not even been
passed, while a bill governing procurement of weapon systems from
the United States has been long-stalled in the legislature.
</P>
<P>
Lee said he hopes the 2007 overall defense budget and the U.S.
weapon procurement bill will be passed by the Legislative Yuan in
March as a boost to Taiwan's system of freedom and democracy.
</P>
<P>
He also called on the Taiwan public of all political persuasions
to consolidate for the cause of the nation and to retain their
freedom and democracy.
