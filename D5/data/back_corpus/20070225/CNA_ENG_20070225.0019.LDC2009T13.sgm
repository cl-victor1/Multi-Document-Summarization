Taipei,  Feb.  25 (CNA) 02/25/07  21:21:15 (By Maubo Chang)

<P>
A man was rescued unscathed Sunday after being trapped for nine
days on a rock ledge in a mountainous area of Hungye village in
Taitung County.
</P>
<P>
The 49-year-old Chung Fu-chin was hungry but otherwise all right,
according to his rescuers from the Taitung fire department.
</P>
<P>
Chung, who worked as a ranger for local fruit farmers and
hunters, said he fell down a precipice Feb. 16 while inspecting
shelters belonging to his employers and landed unharmed on a
rocky ledge about 30 meters above a ravine from which he was
unable to climb either down or up.
</P>
<P>
Trapped without food or water, Chung said he survived by eating
leaves and drinking water dripping down the precipice.
</P>
<P>
He was boosted by the sound of intense firecrackers from the
nearby Hungye village Feb. 17 which was Chinese New Year's Eve,
but his hopes of getting through the ordeal faded as the sound of
firecrackers became fewer and further between with the passing of
New Year's Day.
</P>
<P>
Chung said he saw a man walking into the ravine Sunday morning
and began to blow his whistle loudly to draw his attention.
</P>
<P>
The man, a photographer trying to capture the natural beauty of
the ravine, was surprised to see Chung on the ledge and quickly
alerted police in Hungye village.
</P>
<P>
It took rescuers three hours to drop a rope to Chung from the top
of the precipice and help him abseil down into the ravine to
safety.
</P>
<P>
The rescuers said afterward that Chung had almost eaten all the
leaves he could reach from his rocky perch.
