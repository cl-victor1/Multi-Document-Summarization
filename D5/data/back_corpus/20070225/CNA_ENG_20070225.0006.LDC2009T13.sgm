Taipei,   Feb.  25  (CNA) 02/25/07  14:45:40 (By Deborah Kuo)

<P>
Vice President Annette Lu remained tightlipped Sunday when asked
whether and when she will announce her presidential bid.
</P>
<P>
Lu was the only one of the four highest-ranking Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP)  heavyweights  considered the strongest
contenders for the DPP's 2008 presidential ticket not to have
announced her presidential bid.
</P>
<P>
Premier Su Tseng-chang announced his bid earlier in the day
following announcements by the other two DPP bigwigs -- former
Premier Frank Hsieh and DPP Chairman Yu Shyi-kun.
</P>
<P>
Lu was asked about her intention of running in the 2008
presidential race during a visit to a Buddhist temple in Keelung,
where she offered incense to pray for the country's peace and
prosperity.
</P>
<P>
The "cause" is not due yet, Lu said, adding that she would not
talk about politics or elections during the Lunar New Year
holiday.
</P>
<P>
Lu offered her blessings to Su and expressed hope that he will
succeed in whatever he pursues.
