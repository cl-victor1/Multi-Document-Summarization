A decision on whether Beijing-issued Olympic commemorative coins
can be sold in Taiwan is for the Taipei-based Central Bank of
China (CBC) to make, Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) Vice Chairman
Liu Te-hsun said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Liu said the MAC will respect the decision of the CBC -- the
authoritative agency in terms of Taiwan circulation of
commemorative coins from foreign lands -- on the matter of
whether the coins, issued by Beijing late last year to
commemorate the 2008 Olympics, can be sold in Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Liu made the remarks in response to front-page ads placed in
major daily newspapers in Taiwan Sunday by a coin dealer
identified as Oceancoins to promote the coins.
</P>
<P>
He said that if the CBC decides that the coins can be imported,
the ads and the sales drive will be permitted, adding that there
are laws and regulations in the country governing the sales of
foreign coins in Taiwan and activities regarding the Beijing
Olympics.
