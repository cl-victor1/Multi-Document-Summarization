HEALTH DEPARTMENT NOTIFIES WHO ABOUT ISOLATED CHOLERA CASE
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  June  23 (CNA) (By Deborah Kuo)
</P>
<P>
The Cabinet-level Department of Health (DOH) informed the World Health
Organization (WHO) Thursday immediately upon the confirmation of an
isolated indigenous cholera case in southern Taiwan earlier that day,
according to DOH authorities.
</P>
<P>
According to Chou Chih-hao, deputy director-general of the DOH's
Center for Disease Control (CDC), he notified the WHO Regional Office
for the Western Pacific located in Manila about the case -- a toxic-
producing vibrio cholerae O1 serotype ogawa, a notifiable disease in
the WHO's First Category -- in a 72-year-old woman living in Hsinying,
Tainan County.
</P>
<P>
Since it is an isolated case and the first indigenous case reported in
Taiwan in five years, the WHO is not expected to declare Taiwan a
cholera affected area immediately, Chou said.
</P>
<P>
After receiving prompt and adequate treatment, the woman was in stable
condition, Chou said, adding that although no further suspected cases
were detected by an epidemiological survey, the health authorities
would continue to monitor the situation.
</P>
<P>
None of the woman's 37 family members, neighbors or healthcare workers
who have had contact with her have shown symptoms, Chou noted.
</P>
<P>
Noting that cholera is an acute bacterial enteric disease with an
incubation period of up to seven days, Taiwan can be assured that the
possibility of a cholera epidemic is zero if no similar cases are
reported islandwide by June 30, Chou added.
</P>
<P>
According to CDC officials, the woman began suffering from diarrhea
and vomiting a week earlier after eating food bought from a local
market.
</P>
<P>
Local health authorities collected samples from the market for testing
to try to identify the source of contamination, with the test results
expected June 26.
</P>
<P>
CDC officials said that cholera is transmitted through ingestion of
contaminated food or water, or through the use of utensils
contaminated directly or indirectly with feces, vomitus or by the
fingers of infected persons. It can also be transmitted via flies and
cockroaches. Contaminated water is the most serious source of
infection.
</P>
<P>
Vibrio cholerae lives in sea water and humans are the only reservoir.
Infection often is brought about by eating raw seafood from polluted
waters, they said.
</P>
<P>
They added that vibrio cholerae is susceptible to gastric acid and
that infection can only be induced by the intake of a large amount of
bacteria.
</P>
<P>
Although the case is not suspected of being a result of the June 12
flooding in southern Taiwan, the CDC urged the public in flooded areas
and elsewhere to eat only well-cooked food and to drink only boiled or
bottled water.
