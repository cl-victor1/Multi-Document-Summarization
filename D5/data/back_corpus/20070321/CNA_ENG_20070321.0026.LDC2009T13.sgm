National Police Agency Director-General Hou Yu-ih said Wednesday
that he strongly supports police use of handguns only if they use
them the right way.
</P>
<P>
Hou made the remarks at a news conference held by Minister of the
Interior Lee Yi-yang at the ministry's headquarters to declare
the government's policy of enforcing the laws in a strict manner,
after two separate attacks on police officers were reported in
the southern county of Tainan in the past week.
</P>
<P>
On March 15, a traffic violator grabbed the handgun of a highway
police officer while being questioned on an expressway, which he
then used to shoot another motorist in a failed attempt to hijack
the victim's car. The offender then hijacked another car with his
companion and fled. The wounded motorist died in hospital.
</P>
<P>
A few days following the incident, an officer lost his gun to a
man with a record of drug offenses after the man attacked him
while he was performing an inquiry.
</P>
<P>
Hou apologized to the public for the police ineptitude and said
efforts have been launched to review and improve police
operations and training.
