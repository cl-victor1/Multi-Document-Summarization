Taipei,  March 21 (CNA) 03/21/07  23:12:18 (By Y.C. Jou)

A Ministry of Justice (MOJ) investigation report concluded
Wednesday that State Public Prosecutor-General Chen Tsung-ming
did no wrong in allowing himself to be treated to a banquet  by
Legislative  Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng,  refuting challenges
against Chen's ethics.
</P>
<P>
It was a gathering for official business and not an 'improper
treat', Vice Minister of Justice Lee Chin-yung said in a news
conference.
</P>
<P>
Lee said the Feb. 6 banquet was hosted by Wang at his residence
to treat officials from both the Legislative Yuan and the MOJ who
were engaged in official business involving the two bodies.
</P>
<P>
However, the Prosecutors' Reform Association, a non-official
organization formed by outspoken prosecutors, disputed the MOJ's
conclusion.
</P>
<P>
The (MOJ's) report fails to present the truth, said Chen Chih-
ming, convener of the association, calling the investigation
hasty.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated that the association will continue to monitor
closely the top prosecutor's deeds, and call for his resignation
if necessary.
</P>
<P>
Two weeks ago Next Magazine disclosed that the banquet had
occurred and suggested that Chen Tsung-ming treated Wang to repay
the speaker for his support in the legislature vote approving
Chen's nomination in January. It also stated that the guests
included six or seven prosecutors
</P>
<P>
The Judicial Committee of the Legislature last Wednesday adopted
a resolution to obligate the MOJ to complete an investigation and
publish the names of the guests in a week.
</P>
<P>
According to the MOJ's investigation, Lee said that during the
dinner Chen thanked Wang for his support of the MOJ's bills.Apart
from that, there was just chatter.
</P>
<P>
Main opposition Kuomintang lawmaker Chiu Yi had stated that a
business man, Chiang Sung-chi, involved in President Chen Shui-
bian's special national affairs fund casewas also in the banquet.
In response Lee said Chiang was only one of some 300 hundred
witnesses, and was not a suspect in the case, nor was his
presence improper at the banquet.
</P>
<P>
Lee added that since it was not animproper treat, the prosecutors
who attended the dinner did not break any rules, and out of
respect for the host there was no need to publish the names of
the guests.
