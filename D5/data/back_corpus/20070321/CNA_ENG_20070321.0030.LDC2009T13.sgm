Minister  of  Transportation  and Communications Tsai Duei
confirmed Wednesday a gossip magazine report that he has been
separated from his wife for 15 years and is having an extra-
marital affair.
</P>
<P>
Tsai told reporters he felt bad that his private life had been
exposed by the latest edition of Next Magazine -- a Chinese-
language weekly published in Hong Kong and Taiwan -- although
what is said in the report is true.
</P>
<P>
The 60-year-old Cabinet minister said he had already reported the
current status of his private life to Premier Su Tseng-chang, who
is in full knowledge of the facts.
</P>
<P>
"Each family has its own kind of hell, but I hope that none of my
family members will get hurt," he said.
</P>
<P>
Officials at the Ministry of Transportation and Communication
(MOTC) disclosed that Tsai has seldom talked about his personal
affairs and that while Tsai served as head of the Civil
Aeronautics Administration under the MOTC, he kept a low profile
and invited none of his colleagues to his daughter's wedding.
</P>
<P>
The Next Magazine report said Tsai met his current female
companion after separating from his wife and that he is still not
divorced from his wife because she has refused to agree to a
divorce.
