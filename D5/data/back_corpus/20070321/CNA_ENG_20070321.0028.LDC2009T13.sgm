JAPAN'S LINKING OF TAMIFLU TO TEEN DEATHS UNFOUNDED: CDC

<P>
Japan's linking of the anti-flu drug Tamiflu to behavioral
disorders and a spate of deaths among teenagers in Japan is
groundless,  Taiwan medical professionals claimed Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Officials from the Center for Disease Control (CDC) under the
Department of Health, as well as several pediatricians, said that
so far, no direct evidence has been found to prove that teen
behavioral disorders and suicides since last October are the
result of taking the flu vaccine.
</P>
<P>
CDC officials said it remains to be discussed whether Taiwan
should follow Japan's suit in banning use of Tamiflu by Japanese
citizens aged between 10 and 20.
</P>
<P>
Japan's Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare announced Wednesday
that Japanese importers of Tamiflu should see to it that the
medicine's outer cases carry a label indicating that
"principally, this drug is not recommended to be used by patients
aged between 10 and 20."
</P>
<P>
The Japanese ministry has also asked medical institutions around
the country to refrain from prescribing Tamiflu to patients in
that age group.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese decision was made after 16 Japanese teens were found
to have died after taking Tamiflu since last October. Of the
total, five teens fell to their deaths from high buildings.
</P>
<P>
Discounting  the Japanese officials'  findings,  CDC Deputy
Director-General Shih Wen-yi said that since Tamiflu was
introduced into Taiwan in 1992, over 12,800 people have used
Tamiflu. Of these people, some 1,400 were teens aged between 13
and 18. No cases of behavioral disorders were reported among
these people, Shih said.
</P>
<P>
Shih said medical specialists from home and places other than
Japan have agreed that more solid evidence is needed to determine
the connection between Tamiflu and bahavioral disorders.
</P>
<P>
Saying that Taiwan's anti-flu efforts will not be affected by the
Japanese findings,  Shih said Taiwan will follow World Health
Organization advice and regulations in this regard.
</P>
<P>
So far, he said, Taiwan has stockpiled 390,000 valid doses of
Tamiflu -- an amount enough for 10.44 percent of the country's
population in case of an influenza pandemic.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Lee Pin-ying, a pediatrician with National Taiwan
University Hospital, described the Japanese ruling that teens
should avoid Tamiflu as "too assertive and arbitrary."
</P>
<P>
Citing reports of medical experiments conducted elsewhere, Lee
said Tamiflu can cause behavioral disorders or injuries to a
person's nervous system regardless of age.
</P>
<P>
Lee said Japan's policy of "stop using it when in doubt" is
debatable and suggested that children or the elderly who have
developed flu symptoms should use Tamiflu as the drug is still
the most effective anti-flu medicine to date.
