Taipei, March 12 (CNA) 03/21/07  19:38:14 (By Lilian Wu)

<P>
Economic Affairs Minister Steve R. L.Chen said Wednesday that the
main concern of the Economics Ministry is whether tax reform will
be favorable to soliciting investment.
</P>
<P>
Chen made the remarks amid media reports that the Ministry of
Finance is mulling tax reforms, including a cut in individual
income tax and corporate income tax from 2010.
</P>
<P>
He said the ministry has already sent the message to the business
and industrial sectors for discussion.
</P>
<P>
"The ministry is concerned whether the tax reform will allow
Taiwan to enjoy its edge in soliciting local and foreign
investment," Chen said, adding that it "will assess if this will
affect business solicitation and the investment willingness of
the business and industrial sectors."
</P>
<P>
Chen noted that all other countries are actively soliciting
investment and said potential investors will compare the tax
incentives offered by each country.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Minister of Finance Ho Chih-chin said the tax reforms
are not finalized and that there is no timetable for any
finalization.
</P>
<P>
Ho said the premise of adjusting the tax rate downward will be
the termination of a tax incentive statute for industry in 2009
and an expansion of the government's tax collection base.
</P>
<P>
Ho said the ministry is making an overall assessment, saying that
the reform will cover a wide range of aspects, including
scrapping tax exemption privilege for military personnel, civil
servants and teachers to broaden its tax collection base.
