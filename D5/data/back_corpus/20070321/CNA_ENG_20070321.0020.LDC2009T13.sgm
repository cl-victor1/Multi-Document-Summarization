PRO-INDEPENDENCE GROUP URGES INCREASE IN PENSION FOR ELDERLY

Taipei,  March 21 (CNA) 03/21/07  16:41:50 (By Flor Wang)

The pro-independence 908 Taiwan Republic Campaign urged the
government Wednesday to increase the monthly pension for elderly
citizens to NT$13,500, bringing it up to par with the subsidies
granted to retired veterans.

<P>
Peter Wang, leader of the group, issued the call when paying a
visit to seek support for the proposal from the legislative
caucus of the opposition Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU) at the
Legislative Yuan.

<P>
TSU legislative caucus whip Tseng Tsahn-deng expressed his
party's full backing for the proposal on the grounds that the TSU
supports better treatment for those aged over 65 years --
including granting an 18 percent preferential interest rate to
retired farmers, fishermen and workers, rather than the existing
system that allows only retired military,  civil servants and
public primary and elementary school teachers to benefit.

<P>
According to Wang, some 200,000 retired veterans receive a
pension of NT$13,500 per month, while as many as 500,000 retirees
from the military and the government sector are entitled to an 18
percent preferential interest rate for their bank deposits.
</P>
<P>
In contrast, 1.5 million retired fishermen, farmers and workers
get only NT$3,500 in pensions per month, Wang noted, adding that
he will continue seeking endorsement from other political parties
for his cause of building social justice.
