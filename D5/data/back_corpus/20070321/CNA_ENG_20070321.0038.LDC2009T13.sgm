The Council of Agriculture (COA) has a set strict and efficient
quarantine measures to ensure the safety of betel nuts to be
imported from Thailand, COA officials said Wednesday.

<P>
The COA has stationed quarantine personnel in Thailand to oversee
the insecticidal steaming process betel nuts must undergo before
they can be exported to Taiwan, the officials said in response to
concerns voiced by a Taiwanese businessman there over poor
steaming facilities used by the Thais to kill insects and their
eggs in shipments of produce for export.

<P>
Taiwan re-opened its doors to betel nut imports from Thailand
last May after it imposed a ban Nov. 1, 2003 based on
international records indicating that Thai betel nuts are host to
a species of fruit fly that also lives on guavas and papayas --
two of Taiwan's major fruit crops.
