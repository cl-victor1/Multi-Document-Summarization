Taiwan Sugar Corp. (Taisugar) Chairman Yu Cheng-hsien said
Wednesday that Taisugar is willing to stop raising hogs if that
is the decision the government chooses to make.
</P>
<P>
Yu made the remark in a report to a legislative committee on
Taisugar's operations and budget.
</P>
<P>
Amid a long-term slump in pork prices, there have been demands
that Taisugar -- the largest corporate hog producer in Taiwan --
stop producing more pigs as it is causing an oversupply with
resulting low prices.
</P>
<P>
Yu noted that Taisugar has over the years produced pork products
without pesticide residue, which has helped it establish a goof
reputation among consumers. It has also set up a traceability
system to ensure the safety and quality of its pork products, he
said.
</P>
<P>
In line with the Council of Agriculture's policy of stabilizing
pork prices, it has recently cut its number of head for sale by
10 percent.
</P>
<P>
The state-owned company has also decided to cut the number of
pigs raised by 60,000 within a year and to raise the ratio of
preserving slaughtered pigs through freezing by 50 percent.
