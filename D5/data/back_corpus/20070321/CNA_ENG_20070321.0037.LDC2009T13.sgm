FORMER COMFORT WOMEN DEMAND APOLOGY, COMPENSATION FROM JAPAN
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  March 21 (CNA) 03/21/07  20:44:53 (By Han Nai-kuo)

Three former comfort women forced to work as sex slaves for
Japanese soldiers in World War II tried to present a letter of
protest Wednesday to Japan's quasi- embassy in Taiwan -- the
Interchange Association's Taipei office -- but Japanese officials
refused to see them.
</P>
<P>
Accompanied by workers from the Taipei Women's Rescue Foundation,
the three elderly women, who are all in their eighties, tried to
deliver the letter to the Interchange Foundation, urging the
Japanese government to face the historical facts recognized in
1993 by then Chief Cabinet Secretary Yohei Kono that Japan did
force women from Asian countries into sex slavery for its
soldiers during World War II.
</P>
<P>
They also demanded that the Japanese government apologize to all
comfort women and make compensation for their sufferings.
</P>
<P>
However, the elderly women were unable to gain entry to the
Interchange Foundation, and Japanese officials refused to come
out to accept the letter from them.
</P>
<P>
Unable to stand for long in front of the Interchange Foundation,
they threw the letter on the ground and trampled it in protest
before leaving.
</P>
<P>
Kao Hsiao-fan, executive director of the Taipei Women Rescue
Foundation, pointed out that the campaign of former comfort women
in Taiwan to seek compensation from Japan has entered the 15th
year, and that of the 58 victims who survived when the campaign
was first launched, only 27 are still living.
</P>
<P>
Kao said the protest in Taipei was part of synchronized global
actions, including protests in Korea and the United States
against Japan's  attempts  to distort  historical  facts  and
avoid responsibility.
</P>
<P>
Although Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said recently that
the Japanese government will continue to honor the Kono
statement, acknowledging that Japan did recruit women from other
Asian countries to work as sex slaves for its soldiers during
World War II, he refused to make a fresh apology.
</P>
<P>
Abe had previously disputed historians' assertions that Tokyo
forced at least 200,000 comfort women from Korea, China, Taiwan,
Indonesia and the Philippines into sex slavery.
</P>
<P>
Japanese documents unearthed by historians in 1992 showed that
Japanese military authorities played a direct role in working
with contracted recruiters to forcibly procure women for the
military brothels.
</P>
<P>
Accounts of abuse by the military have been supported by
witnesses and former Japanese soldiers.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese government set up a private fund in 1995 to
compensate former comfort women, but most of them have refused to
take the compensation. The fund is due to expire March 31.
