Kaohsiung City's Bureau of Cultural Affairs donated books to the
MV DOULOS--a ship known as the floating bookshop--with the aim of
promoting Kaohsiung City globally as the international liner
continues its voyages, Kaohsiung Bureau Chief Wang Chih-cheng
said Wednesday.

The MV DOULOS, berthed at Kaohsiung Fisherman's Wharf, held an
onboard book show March 10-26 that attracted many readers.

Built in 1914, the MV DOULOS is now owned by German charity Gute
Bucher Fur Alle. Carrying more than 500,000 books onboard, it has
visited more than 100 countries around the world.

Wang donated more than 400 books on behalf of the city government
to Captain Ashley McDonald. The donated materials include books
introducing the city, its flower season, maps, and comics about
the city's history.

Wang expressed thanks to the MV DOULOS for bringing books from so
many world cultures to Kaohsiung's citizens, and said he hoped
the floating bookshop will carry the culture and art of Kaohsiung
City to the rest of the world.

According to Wang, McDonald replied that it is an honor to be
able to bring Kaohsiung City's culture to the whole world and the
bookshop will be proud to display the donated books onboard.
