USE OF LOTTERY SURPLUS TO RECEIVE MORE SCRUTINY
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  March  2 (CNA) 03/02/07  20:06:16 (By Y.C. Jou)

An amendment passed by the legislature Friday both narrowed the
scope for which surplus government-issued public welfare
lotteriesfunds  may be used and strengthened mechanisms for
supervising the use of such funds.
</P>
<P>
Currently the Act Governing the Issuance of Public Welfare
Lotteries stipulates that lottery surpluses may only be spent on
subsidies for national pensions, the national health insurance
reserve, and other social welfare programs and charity matters.
</P>
<P>
However, some surplus money has been used to subsidize programs
already funded by regular governmental budgets,  leading to a
duplication  of services and waste of resources,  said ruling
Democratic Progressive lawmaker Wang Jung- chang, who initiated
this amendment to the Act.
</P>
<P>
Some of these funds have been spent on matters  entirely
irrelevant to social welfare,  due to insufficient supervisory
mechanisms, Wang said.
</P>
<P>
The amendment prescribes that public welfare lottery funds may
only go towards social welfare expenditures that are not already
funded through the Act Governing the Allocation of Government
Revenues and Expenditures. It also changes the composition of
supervisory committees responsible for allocating the surplus at
both the central and local levels.
</P>
<P>
Currently, supervisory committees are formed by governmental
officials  alone, meaning  that  government  agencies  are
poorly-regulated and open to criticism.
</P>
<P>
According to the newly passed amendment, the committees must be
comprise of officials, experts, and representatives from social
welfare groups, with government officials making up not more than
one half of the seats. Additionally, any major decision may only
be made with a quorum comprised of not less than two-thirds of
all committee members, and an agreement of not less than half of
all those who are present.
