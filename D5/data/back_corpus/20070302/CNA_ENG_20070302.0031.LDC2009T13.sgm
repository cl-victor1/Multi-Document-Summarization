The Taichung City-based National Museum of Natural Science
unveiled Friday its collection of fossils of ancient crocodiles
and announced that the museum is preparing a special exhibition
for the valuable artefacts.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference held to publicize the collection, museum
Curator Lin Chung-hsien said the museum's core operations are
collection and research, through which people can find out more
about nature.

Among the fossils, the oldest is a prehistoric crocodile called
steneosaurus bollensis, discovered in a small village in
Stuttgart, Germany. It lived in the early Jurassic Period some
180 million years ago, according to Cheng Yien-nien, a
paleontologist from the museum's Geology Department.

In his briefing, Cheng also introduced the museum's most valuable
crocodile fossil --  an 5.6 meter reptile  called dyrosaurus
phosphaticus that was found in Morocco and is said to be around
50 million years old.
</P>
<P>
It might be the world's first specimen of the species to be
completely unearthed, Cheng said.
</P>
<P>
In addition, he announced that the museum is managing a specimen
of a crocodilian species discovered in Penghu, off southwestern
Taiwan, in 2006, which he estimated to be 14 million years old.
</P>
<P>
It is the oldest crocodilian fossil unearthed in Taiwan and is
probably a new species of prehistoric crocodile, Cheng said,
noting that the fossil has preserved skin and even food in its
stomach.
