DPP OPTIMISTIC ABOUT YEAR-END LEGISLATIVE ELECTIONS: NSC OFFICIAL
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

Tokyo, March 2 (CNA) 03/02/07  19:22:30 (By Yang Ming-chu and
Lilian Wu)
</P>
<P>
Taiwan's ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) is optimistic
about the performance of the party in the year-end legislative
elections, according to National Security Council Secretary-
General Tan Sun Chen.
</P>
<P>
Chen made the remarks in a recent interview with Katsumi Ohtsuki,
the Taipei correspondent of Jiji Press, which appeared in the
latest "World Affairs Weekly," a magazine published by Jiji
Press.
</P>
<P>
Chen said the DPP will be satisfied if it can win 50 seats out of
the 113 up for grabs in the December legislative elections, which
will adopt a new electoral system of "single-member constituency,
two votes," as well as halving the present 225-seat legislature.
</P>
<P>
He noted that President Chen Shui-bian was mired in a series of
scandals allegedly involving his top aides and family members
last year, which dented the approval ratings of the president as
well as the DPP, prompting some to predict then that the DPP will
be lucky if it can win 30 seats.
</P>
<P>
"But the public faith in the DPP has gradually rebounded," Tan
Sun Chen said.
</P>
<P>
He also said that although Taiwan is already a sovereign
independent country, the Taiwan people still lack a Constitution
of their own. The present Constitution was formulated in mainland
China in 1947 and is irrelevant to the Taiwan people, he said.
</P>
<P>
The DPP and various civic groups have worked out drafts of a new
Constitution that do not touch upon such sensitive issues as
national title, national flag or national song, Tan Sun Chen
said.
</P>
<P>
But with a little more than one year before Chen completes his
second term in May 2008, the prospect of crafting a new
constitution is not optimistic, Tan Sun Chen said.
</P>
<P>
After the draft constitution is finalized, it will be sent to the
legislature for passage and then put to a national referendum.
Judging from such a procedure, it will be difficult for the
president to formulate a new constitution before his terms ends,
he said.
</P>
<P>
If so, the issue will have to be dealt with by the next
administration. As long as the DPP wins the next presidential
election, it will list a new constitution as top priority, he
added.
</P>
<P>
Tan Sun Chen pointed out that the opposition-controlled
legislature often boycotts Chen's policies, including his
economic policies.
</P>
<P>
It is a fact that voters are disappointed with Chen's
administration, but the economic fundamentals in Taiwan are
generally good with a growth of 4 percent and more. Overall,
Taiwan is "economically sound," Tan Sun Chen said.
</P>
<P>
Asked if the island will apply to join the United Nations under
the name of Taiwan, he said that if Taiwan can join the United
Nations, it will break Beijing's premise that Taiwan is part of
China and could prevent China from using force against Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
But he also admitted that if Taiwan wants to join the world
organization under that name, it will encounter stiff opposition
from China.
</P>
<P>
First and foremost, Taiwan has to express its own views, Tan Sun
Chen said, adding that the government will communicate with the
United States and Japan on the matter.
