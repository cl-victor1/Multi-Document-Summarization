PRESIDENT CONFIDENT OF DPP'S VICTORY IN 2008 PRESIDENTIAL RACE
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  March 2 (CNA) 03/02/07  21:47:47 (By Sofia Wu)
</P>
<P>
President Chen Shui-bian has said in an interview with a German
news agency that he is confident of the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party's (DPP's) victory in the 2008 presidential
election.
</P>
<P>
"We believe that the next person sitting in this chair will be
someone from our party, the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) .
Who will be the one from DPP, I don't know, but I am sure this
person will be one from DPP, " Chen said in an exclusive
interview with Deutsche Presse-Agentur (dpa) at the Presidential
Office Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Chen will step down in May 2008 after having served two four-year
terms. Three DPP bigwigs -- Premier Su Tseng-chang, former
Premier Frank Hsieh and DPP Chairman Yu Shyi-kun -- have declared
their candidacy for the DPP nomination to run in the 2008 race.
Vice President Annette Lu is also likely to register for the DPP
presidential primary.
</P>
<P>
"What is certain is on May 20, 2008 I will pass the baton on to
the next president," said Chen, adding that it is very unlikely
that the next president will be from the opposition Kuomintang
(KMT) , or that it will be opposition leader Ma Ying-jeou, a
former KMT chairman who conditionally backs Taiwan's eventual
unification with China.
</P>
<P>
Some observers said the 2008 presidential election could be a
deciding factor in Taiwan's policy towards China -- independence
or to seek reconciliation and prepare for eventual reunification.
</P>
<P>
In his interview with dpa President Malte von Trotha and Beijing
Bureau Chief Andreas Landwehr, Chen hailed DPP's coming to power
in 2000 as an historical achievement, a peaceful change of power
and an indication of Taiwan's people's embracing democracy with
their votes.
</P>
<P>
Chen defended a series of steps he has taken to assert Taiwan's
sovereignty - holding the first referendum in 2004 as well as
abolishing  the National Unification  Council and the National
Unification Guidelines in 2006.
</P>
<P>
On Taiwan's policy toward China, Chen said it is to be decided by
the Taiwan people.
</P>
<P>
"Regarding Taiwan's future and future relations between the two
sides of the Taiwan Strait, we leave the choices open to our 23
million people. They can choose according to their free will, "
he said.
</P>
<P>
Chen urged China to learn from Taiwan's democracy and its
election system.
</P>
<P>
He invited the chairman of China's parliament -- the National
People' Congress (NPC) -- to visit Taiwan, and invited the NPC to
send a delegation to observe the year-end legislative election
and the presidential election in March 2008.
</P>
<P>
"Thirdly, I would like to urge China's NPC to seriously consider
the feasibility of abolishing the so called anti-secession law. I
think this anti-secession law is the worst ever legislation and
it has hurt the feelings of the Taiwan people. Such a bad
legislation should be abolished as soon as possible," he said.
