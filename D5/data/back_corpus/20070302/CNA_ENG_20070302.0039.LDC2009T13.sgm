ONLY ONE KMT PRESIDENTIAL TICKET IN 2008: FORMER KMT CHIEF
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  March 2 (CNA) 03/02/07  19:52:30 (By Flor Wang)

Despite uncertainties still hanging within the party, the
Kuomintang (KMT) will definitely produce only one ticket to run
in the 2008 presidential election, former KMT Chairman Ma Ying-
jeou said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Ma, the KMT's most likely contender in the next presidential
race, made the pledge while answering questions from reporters.
</P>
<P>
Ma's remarks came after Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng, a
KMT stalwart, said earlier the same day that he has no intention
of taking part in the party's election for chairman as he is busy
with preparations for seeking the KMT's presidential nomination
and with business in the Legislative Yuan.
</P>
<P>
Through the party's negotiation mechanism, the KMT will see only
its best bet for the presidential ticket participating in the
race, Ma said.
</P>
<P>
Ma stepped down from the KMT chairmanship and announced his
presidential aspirations in mid-February after being indicted by
Taipei prosecutors over alleged embezzlement of a special
municipal monthly allowance assigned for his discretionary use
during his two mayoral terms from 1998-2006.
</P>
<P>
Turning to a possible challenge from Wang, Ma said that he is not
surprised at such a development. Ma hailed the legislative
speaker as a capable talent for the country and the KMT and he
wished Wang the best.
</P>
<P>
Ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) Chairman Yu Shyi-kun
commented later in the day that it is good that more people are
interested in contending the 2008 presidential race as it
provides the public with a greater chance of selecting a
qualified head of state.
</P>
<P>
Yu has also announced his presidential ambition and is set to
face competition from Premier Su Tseng-chang and former Premier
and former Kaohsiung Mayor Frank Hsieh. It is anticipated that
Vice President Annette Lu will announce her presidential bid in
the coming days.
