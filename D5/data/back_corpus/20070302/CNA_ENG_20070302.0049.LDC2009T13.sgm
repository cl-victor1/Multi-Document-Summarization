The Chiang Kai-shek Memorial Hall, located in downtown Taipei,
will be re-named "Taiwan Democracy Memorial Hall" according to a
resolution adopted at a supra- ministerial meeting, an official
with the Ministry of Education said Friday.

<P>
Meanwhile, the memorial hall complex which also accommodates the
National Theater and the National Concert Hall will be
transformed into a "Taiwan Democracy Park", the official said.

As to the question of whether the wall surrounding the memorial
hall complex would be scrapped, the official said a supra-
ministerial landscape planning task force will be set up to
conduct space planning and that a report will be presented in one
month's time for the government to decide whether or not to
demolish the wall.

The ruling Democratic Progressive Party proposed that the name of
the Chiang Kai-shek Memorial Hall be changed to "Taiwan Democracy
Memorial Hall," in an effort to eliminate symbols of the
authoritarianism associated with the late President Chiang Kai-
shek, considered a key perpetrator of the 228 Incident.
</P>
<P>
The incident, which occurred on Feb. 28, 1947 due to an uprising
against the corrupt Kuomintang administration under Chiang, was
followed by a bloody crackdown that resulted in the death of tens
of thousands of civilians.
