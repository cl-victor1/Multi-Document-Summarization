A major consumer group Friday inspected the Taipei Lantern
Festival venue at Chiang Kai-shek Memorial Hall and found several
safety concerns, which the city government,  in response,
promised to fix before the opening of the main event Saturday
evening.
</P>
<P>
The problems, according to Cheng Jen-hung, Chairman of the
Consumer's Foundation, included sprawling electric wires that
could cause walkers to stumble, exposed plugs that could cause
electric shocks in the rain, 120-degree C searchlights
immediately next to a visitors' path which exposes passersby to a
risk of burns, and gas cylinders that are overdue, unchecked or
near stoves.
</P>
<P>
Food sanitation concerns were also raised, Cheng said, as some
foods being sold at the scene were exposed to the air.
</P>
<P>
Cheng inspected the venue accompanied by Taipei City Government's
consumer ombudsman as well as Civil Affairs Department officials,
who promised to resolve the issues raised.

The 2007 Taipei Lantern Festival kicked off on February 24 with
the lighting of theLantern Tunnel, stretching 4.5 kilometers
along the Ren-ai Road between the City Hall to the east and the
Jingfu Gate to the west. The main lantern exhibit at CKS Memorial
Hall square will take place from March 3 until March 11.
