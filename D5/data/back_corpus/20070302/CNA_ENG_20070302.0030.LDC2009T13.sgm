The total production value of Taiwan's semiconductor industry
reached NT$1.38 trillion in 2006, up 23.2 percent from the
previous year, much higher than the 8.5 percent growth rate in
the global market, the Industrial Development Bureau said Friday.

<P>
In addition, the global market share for Taiwan-produced DRAM is
expected to grow by 35 percent, up from last year's 21 percent,
thanks to the "cluster effect," bureau officials predicted.
</P>
<P>
This "cluster effect" in Taiwan's semiconductor industry is
gaining strength, the officials said, adding that a string of
foreign semiconductor manufacturers have begun to seek
collaboration with Taiwanese companies.
</P>
<P>
The strong market demand has provided a significant boost for
Taiwanese memory chip manufacturers, IC design companies, wafer
manufacturers and chip packaging and testing enterprises,  the
officials noted.
</P>
<P>
A number of local and foreign companies have announced plans to
construct 12-inch wafer factories, the officials went on,
boasting that Taiwan has the highest density of 12-inch wafer-
producing fabs in the world.
</P>
<P>
At present, Taiwan owns over one-third of the world's wafer
production capacity, the officials said.
