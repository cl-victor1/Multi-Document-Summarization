Taiwan Stock Exchange Corp. (TSEC) and Japan's Osaka Securities
Exchange Co., Ltd. (OSE) signed a Memorandum of Understanding
(MOU) Friday to step up bilateral cooperation and the development
of the securities markets in Taiwan and Japan.
</P>
<P>
TSEC General Manager Hsu Jen-shou said the signing of the MOU is
expected to bring stable business development and create a
mutually beneficial situation for both sides.
</P>
<P>
Under the terms of the MOU, each party will render mutual support
for each other's public relations activities and presentations on
business operations of listed companies, exchange information on
market research, and set up a channel for regular executive
meetings.
</P>
<P>
Based upon the MOU's spirit of bilateral cooperation, the TSEC
hosted a presentation Friday on OSE's flagship product -- the
Nikkei Stock Average (Nikkei 225) Futures -- with domestic
securities dealers invited to attend, according to a TSEC
official.
</P>
<P>
OSE is the largest equity derivatives exchange in Japan. In 2006,
the trading volume of the Nikkei 225 Futures hit a record high of
25,151,924 units, up 40.4 percent from the previous year's level.
The OSE is the first listed exchange in Japan whose shares have
been traded on its own market -- Hercules -- since 2004.
