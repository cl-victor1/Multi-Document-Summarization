VISITING NOBEL PEACE PRIZE WINNER MEETS WITH VP
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  April 20 (CNA) 04/20/07  20:17:11 (By Elizabeth Hsu)

Visiting former South African Anglican Church Archbishop Desmond
Mpilo Tutu -- the 1984 Nobel Peace Prize winner -- visited the
Presidential Office Friday, where he received a warm welcome from
Vice President Annette Lu.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Lu informed Tutu of her ongoing campaign for
the ruling party nomination to run in the 2008 presidential
election and expressed confidence that she would win the battle.
In return, Tutu gave his blessing while observing that her male
rivals may have to be careful.
</P>
<P>
Lu told Tutu, who won the Nobel Prize for his contribution to
ending apartheid in South Africa and facilitating reconciliation,
that she was a member of an international election monitoring
group that observed the first fully-demoratic presidential
election in South Africa in 1994.
</P>
<P>
During the trip, Lu said she witnessed how ethnic conflicts were
settled in South Africa and how a new country was born in
democracy.
</P>
<P>
Mentioning Tutu's visit the previous day to a historic site
marking the 228 Incident of 1947 -- one of the bloodiest chapters
in Taiwan's history -- the vice president said although the
historic wound remains in the heart of local people, nonetheless
they remain tolerant, peace-loving and dedicated to justice.
</P>
<P>
During the 1949-1987 period, while the Kuomintang regime imposed
martial law, she and many other democratic activists were jailed
for many years. At the time, no one would have thought that 20
years later,  a defense counsel for eight defendants  charged
with insurrection before a military court would be inviting one
of those "insurgents, " to stand for the presidential and vice
presidential election and help bring a peaceful,  democratic  end
to that authoritarian regime. Lu was referring to President Chen
Shui-bian's invitation of her to team up for the 2000
presidential election.
</P>
<P>
Tutu said that during his current visit to the island once called
Formosa, he feels that there is no hatred in the hearts of family
members of the 228 Incident victims. He blessed Taiwan's people,
wishing them a peaceful and more harmonious future.
