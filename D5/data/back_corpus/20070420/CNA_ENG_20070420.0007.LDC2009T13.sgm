NEW ROC ENVOY TO U.S. MEETS WITH TAIWAN-FRIENDLY MEMBERS OF
CONGRESS
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Washington,  April 19 (CNA) 04/20/07  13:24:54 (By Chiehyu Lin
and Deborah Kuo)
</P>
<P>
Taiwan's new representative to the United States, Joseph Wu, paid
courtesy calls on two leaders of the U.S. Congress Taiwan Caucus
Thursday to exchange views on issues of mutual concern.
</P>
<P>
Wu, who formally assumed his post in Washington, D.C. Monday, met
with Steve Chabot (R-Ohio) and Shelley Berkley (D-Nev.) at their
respective offices on Capitol Hill.
</P>
<P>
Wu said that although differences exist on certain issues between
Taiwan and the United States, Taipei is determined to consult and
communicate with Washington in a "frank and sincere manner."
</P>
<P>
As to Taiwan's bid to join the World Health Organization (WHO)
and to sign a free trade agreement (FTA) with the United States,
Wu said that although both goals "may appear impossible at the
moment, " he is undaunted by the task and will relentlessly
pursue these goals.
</P>
<P>
Wu said he explained to the two Taiwan Caucus leaders that the
the U.S.-South Korea FTA, signed earlier this month, has put
Taiwan at a disadvantage and that it will undermine Taiwan's
economic development.
</P>
<P>
Wu expressed his strong wish that the U.S. Congress will bear in
mind the "deep and wide" business and trade relations between
Taiwan and the United States and push for the signing of an FTA
between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
He further said that in their meeting, Chabot told him that a
U.S-Taiwan FTA is in the best interests of the United States and
that many members of Congress from both the Democratic and
Republican parties are interested in pursuing such a pact.
</P>
<P>
On the issue of Taiwan's plan to bid for entry into the WHO as a
full member under the name "Taiwan, " Chabot said it's "high
time" for Taiwan to do so, according to Wu.
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately,  Wu continued, Chabot further said that the
People's Republic of China has persistently obstructed Taiwan's
bid but that he and other Taiwan Caucus members will nevertheless
continue to make efforts relentlessly toward that goal despite
the fact that just getting the State Department's support will be
a major challenge.
</P>
<P>
For her part, Berkley told Wu that she and other Taiwan Caucus
co-chairs will jointly initiate a proposal shortly to urge the
Bush administration to begin working on matters regarding the
signing of an FTA with Taiwan and that she anticipates that other
members of the caucus will also join the effort in the near
future.
</P>
<P>
Berkley added that three other Taiwan Caucus co-chairs --
Representatives Robert Wexler (D-FLa.) , Dana Rohrabacher
(R-Calif.) and Steve Chabot -- will all sign the proposal to push
the Bush administration to take concrete steps toward forging an
FTA with Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
On Taiwan's latest plan to seek to join the WHO as a full member
under the name "Taiwan, " Berkley told Wu that it is a critical
issue as all of Taiwan's 23 million people are entitled to that
right and privilege, adding that she supports the "Taiwan"
initiative and will try her utmost to help Taiwan reach that
goal.
