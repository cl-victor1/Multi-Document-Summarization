Taipei,  April 20 (CNA) 04/20/07  23:18:42 (By Sofia Wu)

Finn E. Kydland, winner of the 2004 Nobel Prize in economics,
predicted Friday that Taiwan's economy will continue to grow
despite China's economic rise.
</P>
<P>
Kydland, who is visiting Taipei, made the remarks during a
courtesy call on President Chen Shui-bian at the Presidential
Office.
</P>
<P>
During their talks, Chen expressed worry about Taiwan's economic
prospects amid the impact of China's economic rise and the
magnetic effect of the vast Chinese market in attracting
investment capital.
</P>
<P>
In response, Kydland said Taiwan need not care too much about the
impact of China's economic rise. Most of the effects will be
short-lived, Kydland said, adding that Taiwan could continue
enjoying terrific economic growth if it adopts economic
strategies that encourage innovation and investment while
stepping up hardware construction.
</P>
<P>
Forecasting that Taiwan's current economic slowdown or setback
will be "ephemeral, " Kydland said he is convinced that Taiwan's
economy will regain strength and vitality over the long run. In
his view, Kydland said, Taiwan's economy has not yet reached
maturity and still has ample room for growth.
