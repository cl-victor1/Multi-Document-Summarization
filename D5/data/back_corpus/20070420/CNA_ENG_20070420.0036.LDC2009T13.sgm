The Council of Agriculture (COA) has named seven crops --
peanuts, oranges, papayas, pineapples, garlic, onions and bananas
-- as the subjects of the government's production registration
operations this year in an effort to prevent glut, COA officials
said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Growers of these crops can declare the scale of their planned
production this year to the COA Agriculture and Food Agency in
order to avail themselves of government compensation if their
crops lose their value due to glut on the local market, the
officials said.
</P>
<P>
According to the COA, the production registration system was
formed as part of efforts to address the challenging problem of
production-marketing imbalances that always affect farmers the
worst.
</P>
<P>
The system allows the government to better control the output of
"sensitive crops " -- those which easily trigger price
fluctuations in the event of production-marketing  unbalance  --
and take precautions against over-planting.
</P>
<P>
If the efforts to prevent glut fail, the COA will purchase the
registered crops at 95 percent of their production cost in an
attempt to reduce the growers' losses, the COA said, noting that
production registration will not ensure profits but will at least
lessen the damage.
