The Environmental Administration (EPA) has imposed fines on 10
individuals for trying to sell unlicensed environmental chemicals
online, an EPA official said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Chen Shu-ling, a section chief with the EPA's Department of
Environmental Sanitation and Toxic Substance Management, said the
10 people  are repeat offenders  who tried  to sell  unlicensed
environmental chemicals through the Yahoo-Kimo and PChome online
auction networks.
</P>
<P>
She added that first-time offenders would usually receive a
written admonishment from the EPA, but for repeat offenders, the
EPA would likely level fines varying from NT$60,000 to
NT$300,000.
</P>
<P>
Chen said some of the cases involved individuals and pet shop
owners who bought mosquito repellent incense and cockroach bait
during holiday trips to Japan and then tried to sell their
leftover chemicals via the online auction.
</P>
<P>
The environmental official added that in several cases, the EPA
had to mete out harsh fines because the offenders had exaggerated
the effectiveness of the unlicensed chemicals in their
promotional descriptions,  thereby  violating regulations
governing  toxic environmental chemicals.
</P>
<P>
According to Chen, under Taiwanese law, each passenger is allowed
to carry one kilogram of licensed or unlicensed environmental
chemicals through the customs by declaring the items on a
clearance form.
