</HEADLINE>

Taipei,   April  20  (CNA) 04/20/07  20:39:43 (By Elisa Kao)

Taiwan Farmers' Association (TFA) Secretary-General Chang Yung-
chen said Friday that the association is still considering
whether or not to form a farmers' party and has not yet come to a
decision.
</P>
<P>
Chang made the remarks after press reports stated that TFA
members will unite with other local farmers' groups to organize
their own political party to protest against politicians'  long-
term ignorance of their interests.
</P>
<P>
The TFA,  which has some 1.8 million  members,  has been
traditionally supportive of the opposition Kuomintang (KMT).
</P>
<P>
According to press reports, TFA members plan to field their own
candidates for the year-end legislative election.
</P>
<P>
Responding to the report, Chang said they have not yet decided to
form a party, but are considering whether or not farmers around
the country should establish a profesional party that differs
from the traditional political parties by focusing only on their
particular areas of interest, much like the Green Party in
Germany.
</P>
<P>
Chang added that if they really do form a party, they will only
seek at-large legislative seats to safeguard the well-being of
farmers and will not compete with the country's major political
parties for constituency seats; he went on to urge the ruling and
opposition parties not to panic over their possible moves.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Legislative Yuan President Wang Jin-pyng said the same
day that the KMT should carefully observe the possible
developments with regard to the proposal of farmers forming their
own party.
</P>
<P>
TFA members are reportedly dissatisfied with KMT lawmakers as
they have neglected agricultural policies and are not actively
promoting bills related to farmers' well-being.
</P>
<P>
Noting that TFA's movement may diminish the KMT's odds of victory
in upcoming elections and its popularity among its grass-root
supporters, Wang urged the party's authorities to manage
prudently the issue. Wang is a former KMT vice chairman.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, KMT Chairman Wu Po-hsiung said he was not aware of the
farmers party proposal and will seek to become better informed on
the point. At the same time, however, Wu denied that the KMT has
not paid much attention to agricultural affairs.
