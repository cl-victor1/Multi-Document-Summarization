Despite the ongoing controversy in Taiwan society surrounding the
late President Chiang Kai-shek's legacy, the Tourism Bureau came
up Friday with tour packages featuring Chiang in an attempt to
lure more Chinese tourists to the country.
</P>
<P>
The bureau under the Ministry of Transportation and Communication
produced the tour packages in response to an April 11 proposal
made by Legislator Yeh Yi-jin of the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party, who suggested during a question-and- answer
session at the Legislative Yaun that government authorities draw
up Chiang-related tour packages exclusively catering to Chinese
tourists as everything connected with Chiang is of great interest
to them, tourism officials said.
</P>
<P>
The packages involve some of Chiang's well-known residences
around the country, including the Jiaobanshan resort park in
northern Taoyuan County, the Shihlin Official Residence in Taipei
City, the Hsitsu Bay Chateau in the southern port city of
Kaohsiung, the Chengching Building in Kaohsiung City, the Tsuenta
Chateau in central Nantou County and the Yangming Chateau in
suburban Taipei , according to the officials.

<P>
A tourism operator quoted recent tallies as showing that a total
of 15,800 Chinese tourists visited Taiwan during the first
quarter of this year, down 18 percent from the same period of
last year. The decline is possibly due to a new measure requiring
that Chinese citizens traveling to Taiwan in tour groups pay at
least US$80 per day for boarding and lodging, he added.
