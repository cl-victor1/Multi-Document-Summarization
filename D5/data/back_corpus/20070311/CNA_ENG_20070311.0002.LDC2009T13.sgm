Kaohsiung,  March 10 (CNA) 03/11/07  10:44:27 (By Maubo Chang)

A ring engaged in brining in illegal Chinese immigrants has been
busted by police in the southern Taipei port city Saturday, with
33 people arrested.
</P>
<P>
The ring, led by Lin Tao-wang, a Chinese originated from Pintan,
Fujian Province, and his Taiwanese family members, recruited
local men to get into false marriages with Chinese young women
for financial gains, according to an affidavit filed by the
police with the Kaohsiung Prosecutors' Office.
</P>
<P>
After bringing their Chinese "wife" into Taiwan , these Taiwanese
men will get a commission of between NT$30,000 (US$910) and
NT60,000, and another monthly payment of NT$30,000 if the Chinese
women they help bring in work as prostitutes in Taiwan, according
to the affidavit.
</P>
<P>
In order to solicit local men to act as "husbands" in their
scheme, Lin and his family members took out newspaper
advertisements, offering fictitious jobs on the mainland with
attractive salaries, according to police.
</P>
<P>
Lin who immigrated to Taiwan in 1990 has already secured local
citizenship, and has taken up his residence in Linko, Taipei
County.
</P>
<P>
Police said they raided Lin's Linko house early this month which
yielded evidence of his scheme and a list of the people who lent
Lin their identities to bring in the Chinese women.
</P>
<P>
The police didn't reveal how many illegal immigrants Lin's ring
had brought into Taiwan, saying only that five of these women are
still unaccounted for.
