PROTESTERS DEMAND PRESERVATION OF OLD SANATORIUM
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,   March  11  (CNA) 03/11/07  21:05:03 (By Y.C. Jou)

<P>
Preservationists  for the Losheng Sanatorium Sunday held a
protest outside the residence of Premier Su Tseng-chang,
demanding a halt to the dismantling of the sanatorium which
stands in the way of a Taipei Metro construction project.
</P>
<P>
Dozens of protesters, most of them students, were arrested by the
police before being released at an obscure point on the city's
outskirt.
</P>
<P>
The Losheng Sanatorium, located on a piece of land straddling
Hsinchuang City in Taipei County and Kueishan Township in Taoyuan
County, was built in 1930 to treat patients with Hansen's disease
in segregation.
</P>
<P>
According to the Executive Yuan's plan, nearly 60 percent of the
compound should be torn down to house a metro maintenance
facility, and more than three hundred patients have been
relocated into a new building over the past years, while the old
compound still houses 40-odd patients.
</P>
<P>
Preservationists argue that for the sake of both the historical
value of the sanatorium and the human rights of the patients, who
had been unfairly segregated for decades,  the compound should be
preserved, particularly as there are alternatives for the metro
project.
</P>
<P>
The Council for Cultural Affairs in February proposed a solution
that would retain 90 percent of the compound. However, the
Executive Yuan quickly rejected the proposal.
</P>
<P>
Taipei City Government's Department of Rapid Transit Systems on
March 5 issued a notice and urged patients still in the old
compound to move before March 13. The Taipei County Government
said that if the patients refuse to move, it will relocate them
by force to allow the dismantling.
</P>
<P>
Preservationists held a protect Friday outside the Premier's
residence, and returned Sunday to ask the Cabinet to reconsider
the 90 percent preservation alternative. They argue that the
rejection of the proposal was made with a lack of transparency.
</P>
<P>
Su, however, reiterated that the decision to tear down the
compound has been left to the Taipei County Government.
