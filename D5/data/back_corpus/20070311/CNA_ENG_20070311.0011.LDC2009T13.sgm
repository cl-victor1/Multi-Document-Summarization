SENIOR PRESIDENTIAL AIDE NOT TO SERVE AS DPP ACTING HEAD
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  March 11 (CNA) 03/11/07  16:50:07 (By Luis Huang)

<P>
President Chen Shui-bian has no plans to arrange for Presidential
Office Secretary-General Chiou I-jen to serve as ruling
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) acting chairman in the run-up
to the party's presidential primary, a presidential aide said
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The official made the remarks following a media report that the
recent designation of Legislator Trong R. Chai, also a member of
the DPP Central Standing Committee, by Chairman Yu Shyi-kun as
his substitute during his primary campaign triggered a dispute
among party members, with several of them considering pushing for
Chiou to serve as DPP acting chairman.
</P>
<P>
According to the report of the mass-circulation United Daily
News, if the idea is accepted by the DPP Central Standing
Committee during its weekly meeting slated for March 14, it will
be seen as coming as a "warning" from President Chen in response
to Yu's opposition to his recent efforts to help mediate the
party's selection of a presidential candidate.
</P>
<P>
In addition to Yu, another three DPP bigwigs -- Vice President
Lu, Premier Su Tseng-chang and former Premier Frank Hsieh --
separately registered their candidacy with the party's
headquarters last week for the presidential primary.
</P>
<P>
After registering his candidacy, Yu issued a statement expressing
his decision to take a leave of absence from the chairmanship
beginning March 8 in order to dedicate his full efforts to
running for the party's nomination for the 2008 presidential
election, and stating that Chai will act for him during his
absence.
</P>
<P>
Describing the president's mediation among the presidential
primary contenders and the designation of the DPP acting chairman
as two different matters, the official claimed that Central
Standing Committee members' viewpoints on the designation of a
substitute for Yu will have nothing to do with the mediation.
</P>
<P>
Asked whether Chen has plans to arrange for Chiou to serve as
acting chairman, the official said that he has not heard of such
a plan, nor any countermeasures targeting Yu due to his
reluctance to accept the president's mediation, meant to avoid a
fierce rivalry among the DPP's presidential hopefuls.
</P>
<P>
The official said after the deadline for the registration of
candidacy for the DPP's presidential primary, Chen invited the
four presidential aspirants to get together mainly to gain a
better understanding of their views and that the president
neither wants any one of them to pull out of the nomination race
nor prefers specific hopefuls for pairing up to form the DPP
ticket.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Chen and the four presidential aspirants
didn't touch on efforts to arrive at a consensus candidate or
polls on public support, the official noted, adding that they are
scheduled to hold a second meeting March 13.
</P>
<P>
If the "mediation or negotiation" approach cannot be used in
producing the party's presidential ticket, a primary will be held
to settle the issue. Under a DPP timetable for the presidential
primary, party members will vote on presidential and legislative
hopefuls May 6, to be followed by a series of public opinion
polls.
</P>
<P>
The votes of party members will account for 30 percent of a
would-be candidate's score, while public opinion poll results
will account for 70 percent. The presidential aspirant who
receives the highest approval rating will be named the party's
presidential candidate May 30.
