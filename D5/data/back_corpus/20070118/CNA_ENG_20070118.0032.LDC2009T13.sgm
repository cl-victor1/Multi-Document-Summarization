A Chinese dredger and its six-man crew was detained Thursday for
stealing sand from the seabed near Taiwan's outlying  island  of
Kinmen,  Coast Guard Administration  (CGA) authorities reported
later that day.
</P>
<P>
CGA officers said the Zhangzhou, Fujian-based vessel Hairun 898
was apprehended by two CGA patrol boats while it was taking sand
from a location near the Menghuyu islet to the west of Kinmen.
Three or four other Chinese illegal dredgers fled the scene.

<P>
The six crew, including skipper Kang Zhiming, were taken to the
Kinmen District Prosecutor's Office for interrogation, where they
admitted that they embarked from Longhai Port at Xiamen City to
dredge sea sand.
</P>
<P>
The six men, all from Fujian, were charged with theft and with
violation  of the national security law,  the earth and land
exploitation law and the statute governing the relations between
the people of the Taiwan Area and the Mainland Area, CGA officers
said.
</P>
<P>
The officers said illegal dredging severely depletes wildlife
living on the seabed and the surrounding ecosystem, as well as
altering the formation of the seabed and the seashore, which will
in turn affect the safe passage of vessels in the waters.
