The suspension of monthly pension payments to retired civil
servants who have settled in China or become People's Republic of
China passport holders is not illegal, Mainland Affairs Council
(MAC) officials said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
MAC officials said the suspension of payment is completely legal
because it was devised for the purpose of verifying the
identities of the payment recipients or ensuring that the
recipients are still alive.
</P>
<P>
MAC officials made the remarks in response to a United Daily News
report which said Thursday that the MAC has violated the
country's laws by suspending monthly pension payments to those
who retired as public functionaries in Taiwan but now live in
China.
