TAIWAN BELONGS TO WORLD, NOT CHINA: VEEP
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Taipei,  Jan.  17 (CNA) 01/18/07  02:10:14 (By Sofia Wu)
</P>
<P>
Vice President Annette Lu said Wednesday that looking from a
global vantage point, Taiwan does not belong to China; rather it
belongs to the world.
</P>
<P>
Lu made the remarks in a videoconference organized by the New
York-based think tank -- the Council on Foreign Relations.
</P>
<P>
In her opening remarks delivered at her office in Taipei, Lu
said, new generations of Taiwanese are developing their own
unique experience of China different from their elders.
</P>
<P>
Quoting the results of a recent survey conducted by universities
in Taiwan, Japan and Hong Kong, Lu said 60 percent of people in
Taiwan now consider themselves "Taiwanese," compared to 18
percent in 1992.
</P>
<P>
With less and less young people share the "China experience" that
had previously defined a generation of "Chinese on Taiwan, " Lu
said the leaders on both sides of the Taiwan Strait should define
cross-strait relations with new thoughts and new vision.
</P>
<P>
"Taiwan and China are relatives ethnically and close neighbors
geographically, " Lu said, adding that there is no reason for the
two sides to resent or to fight against each other.
</P>
<P>
Constructive  engagement  and normalization  of cross-strait
relationships should be based on the three Cs, namely
cooperation, co-existence and co- prosperity, Lu said.
</P>
<P>
Similarly, Lu said, the international community should also re-
examine the outdated and often misleading concept of the so-
called "one China" policy, given the fact that Taiwan and China
have been separate and independent from each other. "Only then
can we find an effective solution to the cross-strait disputes,"
she argued.
</P>
<P>
Examining Taiwan's history, Lu further said the fate of Taiwan is
not decided by China; rather it is tied to the affairs of the
world.
</P>
<P>
Looking from a Chinese perspective, Lu said, one may see the
inevitable merge of Taiwan and China. "Looking from a global
vantage point, however, one will realize that Taiwan does not
belong to China; rather, it belongs to the world," she explained.
</P>
<P>
In her speech, Lu also pointed out that Taiwan is now at a
historical crossroad because of the three challenges facing it:
the rise of Taiwan's national identity, the "magnet effect" of
China and the acceleration of globalization.
</P>
<P>
After leaving its authoritarian  past behind and embracing
democracy at the end of the 20th century, Lu said Taiwan is
developing a unique selfhood, which can be roughly translated as
a Taiwan nationality.
</P>
<P>
While Taiwan's democracy has grown very fast, Lu said, its
democratic institution  still  suffers  many legacies  of the
authoritarian era.
</P>
<P>
"Taiwan, as a young democracy, is experiencing what I called
'symptoms of a transitional democracy, " Lu said, adding that
deeper institutional  reforms are needed to improve transparency
and effectiveness of its government. "We must build our
government based on the rule of law, and particularly, on a sound
constitution that is fitting for Taiwan in the 21st century," she
added.
</P>
<P>
The second challenge for Taiwan is the magnet effect of China, Lu
said. "As China makes impressive economic gains, it has also
developed different 'faces of power, ' described by Dr. David
Lampton in his latest Foreign Affairs article as guns, money and
ideas."
</P>
<P>
The rise of China has an even greater impact on Taiwan than the
rest of the world, Lu said, adding that China has stepped up the
use of both intimidation and seduction to undermine Taiwan in six
different areas: military, economics, diplomacy, law, media and
psychology.
</P>
<P>
"China clearly recognizes Taiwan's strategic importance, as
access to Taiwan is necessary for China to fully develop into a
Pacific power," Lu noted.
</P>
<P>
Touching  on the globalization,  Lu said that despite the
deliberate exclusion by China, Taiwan continues to engage the
world. In the latest globalization index, Lu said Taiwan was
ranked 12th in economic integration and 18th in technological
connectivity.
</P>
<P>
"Taiwan has risen in a unique way -- we have developed our own
brand of soft power based on democracy, human rights, peace, love
and technological progress," Lu said.
</P>
<P>
She also reminded the world that Taiwan has been a model of
global responsibility in its compliance of international norms
and in its contributions toward many humanitarian projects.
</P>
<P>
"Taiwan has demonstrated her ability and responsibility to the
world, and it is time to recognize Taiwan's contributions, to
respect Taiwan's national dignity and to treat Taiwan as a
'responsible stakeholder,'" Lu urged.
</P>
<P>
Stressing that Taiwan's future lies in the world, rather in
China, Lu said Taiwan has embraced the world and the United
Nations will open its door to Taiwan in the future.
</P>
<P>
About 50 think tank scholars and experts took part in the
videoconference, which was moderated by Jerome Cohen, adjunct
senior fellow for Asian studies at the CFR and a law professor at
New York University School of Law.
</P>
<P>
Cohen introduced Lu and Taiwan's current situation at the start
of the videoconference. Following her speech,  Lu answered 14
questions from 13 academics based in New York and Washington,
D.C.
</P>
<P>
During the question-and-answer session, Lu said it is hoped that
the U.S. government can seriously consider allowing President
Chen Shui-bian, herself and other high-ranking Taiwan officials
to visit the U.S. capital.
</P>
<P>
Asked about Taiwan's past and present human rights issues, Lu
said there is still ample room for the government to improve and
deepen its human rights protection.
</P>
<P>
As to the possibility  of Taiwan's  planned constitutional
reengineering provoking strong opposition and reaction from
China, Lu said Taiwan need not declare independence since it has
long been an independent  sovereign  country and has held
regular  direct presidential election since 1996.
</P>
<P>
Noting that Taiwan's present constitution was initiated more than
50 years ago, Lu said many constitutional provisions have become
obsolete and cannot fit Taiwan's needs. Lu said she hopes the
outside world will let Taiwan write a new constitution to cope
with its future needs and ensure good governance.
</P>
<P>
The videoconference started at 9: 30 p.m. Wednesday in Taipei --
8:30 a.m. New York time -- lasted for about an hour.
