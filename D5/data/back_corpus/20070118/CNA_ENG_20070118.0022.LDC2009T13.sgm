U.S. SCHOLARS RAISE VARIOUS ISSUES AT VIDEO CONFERENCE WITH VP
</HEADLINE>

New York, Jan. 18 (CNA) 01/18/07  17:17:44 (By Lillian Lin)

<P>
Scholars and media representatives raised various issues at a
video conference sponsored by the Council on Foreign Relations
Jan. 17 and asked Republic of China Vice President Annette Lu
many questions on cross-Taiwan Strait relations.
</P>
<P>
The Taipei-New York-Washington, D.C. video conference was hosted
in New York by Professor Jerome A. Cohen, adjunct senior
professor for Asia Studies at the council, who was Lu's professor
when she attended Harvard Law School in the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
Speaking from Taipei, Lu first briefed the participants on
Taiwan's developments and prospects.
</P>
<P>
Believed by some political observers as a possible contender in
Taiwan's next presidential election in 2008, Lu was asked whether
Taiwan is ready for a woman president, to which she replied that
Taiwan is an open society and will accept a capable woman as
president. She did not mention her intentions with regard to
2008, but said that perhaps there will be "more than one woman
candidate."
</P>
<P>
As vice president and a possible contender for the Presidential
Office, Lu's advocacy of Taiwan's status interested many of the
scholars and Herbert Levin of the America-China Forum asked
whether the Democratic Progressive Party's China policy could be
more flexible.
</P>
<P>
Citing the increasing contacts in terms of trade and investment,
as well as the hundreds of thousands of Taiwanese visitors to
China every year, Lu said Taiwan hopes to have dialogue with
China to improve relations. However, the authorities in Beijing
have deployed missiles aimed at Taiwan, so for national security
and regional stability, "Taiwan has to have reserved policies to
some degree," she said.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the observation of Michael Kulma of the Asia Society
that some university students in Taiwan picture a future of
"American education, job in China, home in Taiwan", Lu said the
trend of globalization should allow everyone equal opportunity,
and that people should be able to cross borders to achieve
prosperity.
</P>
<P>
Elizabeth Economy, a scholar following China's rise, questioned
Taiwan's ideas of self-defense with regard to the country's
stalled military purchase program from the United States. Lu
attributed the deadlock in resolving the military budget at the
Legislative Yuan to continual obstruction by the opposition. She
said President Chen Shui-bian is very concerned about the issue.
</P>
<P>
Lu was reserved on direct cross-strait transport links and said
that in addition to political implications, piracy and smuggling
problems need to be tackled by officials of both sides of the
strait.
