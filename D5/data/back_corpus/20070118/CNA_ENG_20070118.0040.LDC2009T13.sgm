The Board of the Asia Pacific Broadband Telecom (APBT) will not
be subject to an immediate reorganization, Minister of Economic
Affairs Chen Ruey-long said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
He said what is important now is clarifying APBT's financial
situation, otherwise, who will dare to take the posts (of board
members and supervisors)?
</P>
<P>
APBT suffered financial difficulties associated with the Rebar
Asia Pacific Group crisis. The government, a shareholder in the
company, announced intervention measures to secure the company's
normal operation. Media have widely speculated that the
government will push for a change of the APBT chairperson and
board members at Friday's extraordinary board meeting.
</P>
<P>
But Chen said Friday's session will not deal with the board
reorganization issue, and Vice Chairman Wang Lin-tai will act as
Interim-Chairperson, filling the post vacated by Wang Chin Shih-
ying who is now on the run in the United States on insider
trading and embezzlement charges.
</P>
<P>
The Small Business Integrated Assistance Foundation, affiliated
with the Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) ,  and financial
professionals from a consulting company will conduct financial
audits for the APBT after Friday's board meeting, MOEA officials
said.
