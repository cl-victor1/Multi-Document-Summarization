U.S., ROC JUDICIAL AUTHORITIES IN CONTACT OVER REBAR CASE: MOFA
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  Jan.  18 (CNA) 01/18/07  16:20:21 (By Deborah Kuo)
</P>

Taiwan's judicial authorities are in contact with their U.S.
counterparts over the investigation into the scandal-ridden Rebar
Asia Pacific Group, a Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA)
spokesman said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Wang Chien-yeh said at a regular news conference that the U.S.
judicial authorities have been asked by the Ministry of Justice
for assistance with a probe into the financial status and
personal assets in the United States of Rebar Group founder Wang
You-theng and his fourth wife, Chin Shih-ying.
</P>
<P>
Wang and Chin are at the center of a snowballing financial
scandal and are believed to have stolen billions of dollars in
corporate funds before going on the lam. They have been placed on
Taiwan's most-wanted list and stand accused of embezzlement,
insider trading, fraud and breach of trust.
</P>
<P>
The MOFA spokesman said the U.S. and Taiwan authorities are
communicating in accordance with a Taiwan-U. S. judicial
assistance accord signed in March 2002, under which the two sides
can help each other in the obtaining of witness testimonies,
delivery of legal documents, ascertaining of the identities of
criminal suspects and their whereabouts, as well as the search
and impounding of evidence and freezing of assets of those who
stand accused.
</P>
<P>
Under that accord, Taiwan can ask the United States to help
investigate the whereabouts and assets of Wang and Chin there,
but must respect the decisions and considerations that the U.S.
side makes. Taiwan does not know how the U.S. authorities will
choose to handle the case, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Wang and Chin fled Taiwan to China Dec. 30, one day after two
Rebar subsidiary companies applied for insolvency protection,
which in turn triggered a run on the Chinese Bank, another Rebar
affiliate corporation, the following day.
</P>
<P>
After the Wangs reportedly flew to San Francisco Jan. 13, the
Taipei Prosecutor's Office issued wanted notices for the couple
Jan. 15 that will remain valid for 25 years, followed by a MOFA
move that invalidated their Republic of China passports.
</P>
<P>
According to the spokesman, the U.S. judicial officials have
answered the Taiwan authorities, saying that Taiwan should
provide documents and evidence indicating that the Wangs have
committed crimes including fraud, money-laundering and insider
trading if they want any help from the United States.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that since 2002, Taiwan has asked the United
States to assist in 24 cases, 16 of which have been completed,
while the United States has requested Taiwan's assistance in
helping with 15 cases, nine of which have been successfully
tackled.
