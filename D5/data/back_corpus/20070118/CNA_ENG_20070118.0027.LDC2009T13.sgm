The Republic of China government made a cash donation to Panama
Wednesday to help the Central American country promote two
projects aimed at improving living standards for the
disadvantaged.

Taiwan Ambassador to Panama Hou Ping-fu handed over US$5.5
million to Panamanian First Vice President and Foreign Relations
Minister Samuel Lewis Navarro at a donation ceremony.

Speaking at the ceremony, Lewis said the money will be used to
carry out a "barrier-free life" project for the physically
challenged and a "micro- enterprise development" plan.

He further said that all donations from the Taiwan government
will be used legally and in a transparent way, including
supervision by the Panamanian Ministry of Audit and Control.

For his part, Hou emphasized the importance of the two projects
launched by the Panamanian first lady's office, saying that such
projects will help the disabled develop small businesses to
improve their living standards.

According to Panamanian officials, the first lady's office
started the micro- enterprise development plan in 2006 and
assisted 800 physically challenged people in establishing small
businesses that year.
