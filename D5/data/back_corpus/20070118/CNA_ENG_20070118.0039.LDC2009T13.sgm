Taipei,  Jan.  18 (CNA) 01/18/07  21:36:36 (By Flor Wang)

Use of 5-Meo-DIPT, a new type of drug manufactured from lysergic
acid, is sharply on the rise in Taiwan, government authorities
said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
According to findings of the National Bureau of Controlled Drugs
(NBCD) under the Cabinet-level Department of Health, the number
of drug abuse cases involving 5-Meo-DIPT has jumped to seven
since the beginning of this year, a noticeable rise from one such
case in 2006 and two in 2005.

<P>
5-Meo-DIPT, commonly known as Foxy Methoxy or just Foxy due to
its supposed aphrodisiac-like effects, seems to have replaced
MDMA pills as one of the most popular illicit drugs among local
drug addicts, said Taipei municipal police who recently seized a
large quantity and variety of illegal narcotics in recent raids
of pubs, including 5-Meo-DIPT in white or yellow powder, liquid
and pressed tablets.
</P>
<P>
According to NBCD Director-General Chien Chun-sheng, only six
centigrams of 5 -Meo-DIPT can have very strong side effects
similar to those caused by LSD (lysergic acid diethylamide).
</P>
<P>
Expressing his concern that abuse of 5-Meo-DIPT among Taiwanese
young men and women is likely to become more common, Chien said
that his bureau is considering meeting to list 5-Meo-DIPT as a
controlled drug, and said the bureau will recommend that the
Ministry of Justice do likewise.
