The ruling Democratic Progressive Party is setting up a fund-
raising team to address a financial shortage of NT$100 million
(US$3.05 million) this year despite its plan to lay off 20
percent of its current staff, a party official said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Citing a decision by the party's Central Standing Committee the
previous day, the anonymous official said the team will be headed
by the party's treasurer Legislator Ker Chien-ming.

<P>
The official said the party has budgeted an outlay of NT$453
million for 2007, while its revenue is estimated at NT$348
million, resulting in a gap of NT$107 million.
</P>
<P>
The party has seen its revenue decline by NT$60 million a year
since party Chairman Yu Shyi-kun did away the obligation of each
party public official to raise certain amount of money for the
party out of concerns that it would predispose the party to the
influence of its fund raisers. As a result the party now depends
largely on government grants and donations form public officials
for income.
</P>
<P>
In light of the fact that 40 percent of the party's annual outlay
went to salaries for 168 party officials, the official said that
the party has decided to cut down on staffing levels by 20
percent this year, a move which is expected to save NT$10 million
in personnel expenditures.
</P>
<P>
The ruling party had turned to Sunny Bank which is ran by Chen
Shen-heng, a member of its Central Standing Committee, for a loan
of NT$60 million late last year but was only granted NT$17
million, said the official.
