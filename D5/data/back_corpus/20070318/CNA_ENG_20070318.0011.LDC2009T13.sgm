</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  March  18 (CNA) 03/18/07  16:27:57 (By Han Nai-kuo)
</P>
<P>
Former Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Ma Ying-jeou, who declared his
intention last month to run for president in 2008, established a
campaign office in Taipei Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Ma told reporters at the opening of his campaign office that the
honest and good-natured people in Taiwan are now living in an
atmosphere of social and political discord.
</P>
<P>
He urged the people to "stick to their good nature, let the sun
shine in, and work together for the good of Taiwan."
</P>
<P>
Ma said the most urgent things he hopes to do are to stop
politicians from tearing apart Taiwanese society and to restore
the positive social values on which Taiwanese society was based
in the past.
</P>
<P>
According to Ma, he also wishes to open Taiwan's economy to the
whole world, including China, get rid of government corruption,
re-establish a non-partisan bureaucracy, and ease the
confrontation between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait by
improving relations with China and seeking peace and mutual
prosperity.
</P>
<P>
Ma expressed confidence that if he is elected president in 2008,
he will be able to reverse the course of Taiwan's current
downward spiral.
</P>
<P>
He added that it is important for Taiwan to rid itself of
ideological shackles and break the bonds now shackling the
economy.
</P>
<P>
Ma did not explain what he meant by Taiwan's downward spiral and
economic bondage, but he was apparently referring to the
Democratic Progressive Party government's policies toward China
that have placed restrictions on economic exchanges across the
Taiwan Strait.
</P>
<P>
Among the supporters who went to Ma's campaign office to extend
their good wishes were Taipei Mayor Hau Lung-bin, KMT
legislators, Ma's mother and former colleagues who worked for Ma
during his two terms as Taipei mayor.
</P>
<P>
KMT Vice Chairman Chan Chun-po confirmed that he will serve as
Ma's campaign manager. Other major staff at the office include a
spokesman and a spokeswoman dealing with domestic media, and
another spokesman who will handle relations with the
international media.
</P>
<P>
Ma declared his intention to run for president in 2008 at a press
conference held in mid-February to announce his resignation from
the KMT chairmanship after a public prosecutor  indicted him for
embezzling special mayoral funds during his terms as Taipei
mayor. The case is expected to go on trial at the Taipei District
Court in April.
