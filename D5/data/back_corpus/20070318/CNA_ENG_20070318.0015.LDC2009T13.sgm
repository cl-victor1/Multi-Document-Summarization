MA REITERATES INTENTION TO INVITE WANG TO BE HIS RUNNING MATE

Taipei,  March  18  (CNA) 03/18/07  17:48:35 (By Han Nai-kuo)

Former Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Ma Ying-jeou reiterated Sunday
that if he becomes the KMT's nominee for the 2008 presidential
election, he will ask Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng to
be his running mate.
</P>
<P>
Ma made the remarks at his newly opened campaign office in Taipei
when members of the press asked him to comment on a report that
Wang stated during his current visit to Thailand he will not join
the KMT's presidential primary, but will not rule out the
possibility of joining the presidential race as an independent.
</P>
<P>
Ma said it was too early to speculate on whether Wang will take
part in the primary because the process has not yet begun.
</P>
<P>
"My position has not changed," Ma said, adding that if he is
nominated as the KMT's presidential candidate, he will invite
Wang to be his running mate.
</P>
<P>
Ma said the KMT primary is a mechanism for the party to select
its presidential candidate, and that all aspirants interested in
running should respect the process.
</P>
<P>
He also said that he has been abiding by the agreement reached
with Wang during a Feb. 15 intra-party negotiation that
competition among KMT presidential hopefuls should proceed in a
way that promotes unity and harmony within the party.
</P>
<P>
Ma and Wang agreed in early March that if either of them won the
KMT presidential nomination, the nominee would invite the other
as his running mate.
</P>
<P>
While Ma insists on holding a party primary to select the KMT's
presidential candidate, Wang favors negotiations to determine the
nominee because he suspects that most party workers are loyal to
Ma and biased against him, meaning that the primary might not be
conducted fairly.
</P>
<P>
The KMT will begin accepting registrations from candidates April
19, with the presidential primary scheduled for May 26 when party
members will go to the polls.
</P>
<P>
The voting results will account for 30 percent of the final
result, while approval ratings in a public opinion survey will
account for 70 percent in determining which candidate wins the
nomination.
