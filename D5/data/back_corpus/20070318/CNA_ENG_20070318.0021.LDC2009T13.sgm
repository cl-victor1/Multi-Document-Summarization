Kaohsiung Mayor Chen Chu attended a special advance screening of
the Taiwan- financed movie "I Don't Want to Sleep alone" along
with an invited group of union workers in the southern port city
Sunday to show her support for the country's sluggish film
industry.
</P>
<P>
"I Don't Want to Sleep Alone" is a film produced by Taiwan-based
movie director Tsai Ming-liang and shot in his native Malaysia
for the first time. It depicts a homeless man who suffers
injuries on the streets of Kuala Lumpur before being treated,
cared for, and accepted by a group of Bangladeshi laborers with
whom he eventually forges strong relations despite differences in
race, culture, and language.
</P>
<P>
After the screening, Chen said that she admired Tsai for his
courage and perseverance, adding that these are rare and precious
qualities in present-day Taiwanese society.
</P>
<P>
She also said the Kaohsiung city government has not only tried to
beautify and improve the city, but also worked hard to promote
respect for the socially disadvantaged.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the film can inspire audiences to think about human
nature, Chen expressed the hope that the film will prompt the
public to pay greater attention to, and respect and care for
disadvantaged groups.
</P>
<P>
Also present at the event was the director, Tsai, who received a
monetary award of NT$10 million from the municipal government for
his previous film "The Wayward Cloud".
</P>
<P>
He expressed his gratitude to the city government and local
citizens for their support of his films.
</P>
<P>
The film "I Don't Want to Sleep Alone" will be released
nationwide March 23.
