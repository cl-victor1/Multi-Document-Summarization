Washington,  March 18 (CNA) 03/18/07  23:05:31 (By Jorge Liu, Lin

<P>
Taiwan's outgoing representative to the United States said Sunday
that he feels there is still ample room for improvement of mutual
trust between the two governments.
</P>
<P>
David Ta-wei Lee made the remarks prior to his departure for
Dallas, Texas to attend a board meeting of the World Federation
of Taiwanese Chambers of Commerce (WFTCC).
</P>
<P>
Lee,  a career  diplomat  who will take over as Taiwan's
representative to Canada after ending his U.S. stint, said he has
pulled out all the stops to strengthen bilateral trust during his
two-year-end-eight-month tenure as the country's top envoy
stationed in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Lee said he still sees ample room for his successor
-- Mainland Affairs Council Chairman Joseph Wu -- to continue
efforts in this regard.
</P>
<P>
When he assumed his current post 32 months ago, Lee recalled that
he set two work goals -- strengthening communications with
American authorities and beefing up mutual trust.
</P>
<P>
While there is still room for improvement of bilateral trust, Lee
said he has largely achieved his goal of improving communications
between Taiwanese and U.S. authorities.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Foreign Affairs James Huang will also attend the
WFTCC board meeting in Dallas.
