The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) is planning a major
personnel reshuffle that will see the replacement of chiefs at
several overseas offices and departments of its Taipei
headquarters, a diplomatic official said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Among others, Mainland Affairs Council Chairman Joseph Wu will
replace David Ta- wei Lee as the country's representative to the
United States while Lee will take over as the country's mission
chief in Canada.
</P>
<P>
Incumbent Representative to Canada Thomas Chen, a legal scholar,
will retire from public service, the official said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Liao Kang-min, director of the Taipei Economic and
Cultural Office in Houston will be assigned to head the Taipei
Economic and Cultural Office in New York.
</P>
<P>
Liao will succeed Andrew L. Y. Hsia who will be promoted to serve
as the country's representative to India, the official said.
</P>
<P>
Many other posts will also see personnel replacements because
their incumbent occupants are either reaching the age of
retirement or have stayed at their positions long enough for job
rotation, the official said.

According to the ministry's reshuffle plan, Kung Chung-cheng,
deputy director of the MOFA's North American Affairs Department,
will be transferred to serve as head of the Taipei Economic and
Cultural Office in Vancouver; Lee Tze-cheng, deputy director of
the Treaty and Legal Affairs Department will take over as the
country's deputy representative to Oman; Huang Jung-kuo, deputy
director of the Protocol Department, will be reassigned as deputy
representative to Bolivia.

Chang Yun-ping, head of the Commercial Office to Dubai, the
United Arab Emirates, will return to head the MOFA's African
Affairs Department;  and  Yang Kao-jung,  deputy  director  of
the Telecommunications Services Department, will be new head of
the Taipei Economic Office in Auckland, New Zealand.

<P>
Fang Chung-chiang, convener of the task force in charge of the
World Trade Organization, will be new deputy representative to
South Korea, and Lo Tien- hung, a specialist with the East Asian
and Pacific Affairs Department, will be director of the
representative office in Busan, South Korea.
</P>
<P>
Also, Lin Yung-lo, representative to Indonesia, will return to
head the International Organizations Department.
</P>
<P>
As to Lin's successor, the official said, the ministry has yet to
make a final choice. Also being considered is the new
representative to Thailand, the official said, adding that the
post has been left vacant since Peter Cheng retired from
diplomatic service earlier this year.
