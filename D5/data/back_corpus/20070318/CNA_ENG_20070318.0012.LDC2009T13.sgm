</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  March  18  (CNA) 03/18/07  16:50:12 (By Deborah Kuo)

Unveiling a "second republic" draft constitution Sunday,
National Taiwan University professor Chen Ming-tung and his co-
authors called for the establishment of a parliamentary system of
government for the country, and a president who will be elected
by parliamentarians as nominal head of state.
</P>
<P>
Chen said the "second republic" constitution -- which might also
be called the "Taiwan Constitution" and which preserves most of
the guidelines of the existing Republic of China Constitution,
including retaining the title and national flag of the ROC and
the definition of the traditional ROC sovereign territory -- aims
to combine the "Taiwan Constitution" and the "ROC Constitution."
</P>
<P>
The draft "Taiwan Constitution" also aims to provide a legal
basis for Taiwanese authorities to negotiate with their
counterparts from the other side of the Taiwan Strait based on
the political realities of the status quo so that final cross-
strait political arrangements could be made, Chen said.
</P>
<P>
According to Chen, the draft "Taiwan Constitution" contains 177
articles, and stipulates that a parliamentary system of
government will be adopted in the ROC on Taiwan and the top
administrative organization will be the "Department of State, "
replacing the existing Executive Yuan, while the top
administrator will be the "prime minister," a post to be assumed
by a parliamentarian.
</P>
<P>
The "prime minister, " according to the draft constitution, will
be nominated by the president and then elected by the consent of
at least half of the parliamentarians before assuming office.
</P>
<P>
According to the draft constitution, the presidency will be a
nominal position, although the president will have to be
nominated by a presidential recommendation committee before the
nomination is voted on and approved by the parliament. The term
of the "nominal president" would be six years, with a maximum
limit of two terms.
</P>
<P>
According to the draft constitution, the ROC central government
will be divided into three branches, namely the state department,
the parliament  and an independent  judicial system.  The
existing Examination Yuan would be brought under the jurisdiction
of the state department, while the Control Yuan, the country's
top watchdog body, would come under the jurisdiction of the
parliament.
</P>
<P>
The parliament envisaged under the "Taiwan Constitution" will be
a 200-seat legislative body with lawmakers elected to four-year
terms and eligible for reelection.
</P>
<P>
According to the preface of the draft constitution, the ROC was
officially established in 1911, kicking off the country's "first
republican" era.  In July 1921,  the area of Mongolia became
independent with the establishment of the People's Republic of
Mongolia, and in October 1949, the People's Republic of China
(PRC) was established on the Chinese mainland, which in later
years had won recognition by most countries around the world.
</P>
<P>
The ROC central government relocated its seat to Taiwan in the
same year of 1949, unveiling a "ROC on Taiwan" era, with the
country's territory being redefined as including the Taiwan
proper, the islands of Kinmen, Matsu and Penghu, as well as other
isles in their vicinity, according to the preface.
</P>
<P>
The "Taiwan Constitution"  also stipulates  that the ROC's
development of political relations of any form with the PRC must
be decided in a nationwide referendum after cross-strait
negotiations are held on principles of equality and peace.
</P>
<P>
Chen, a professor with NTU's Graduate Institute of National
Development who was formerly a vice chairman of the Cabinet-level
Mainland Affairs Council, and Chen Tsi-yang, a professor in law
with National Taipei University, as well as Chen Ying-ling, an
associate professor in law and government studies with National
Central University jointly put forth the draft Taiwan
constitution at a colloquium co-sponsored by the Taiwan Thinktank
and the Asia-Pacific Elite Interchange Association.
