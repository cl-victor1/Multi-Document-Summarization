Taipei,  March 18 (CNA) 03/18/07  19:18:38 (By Deborah Kuo)

Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) Chairman Joseph Wu,  who has been
confirmed  to be the country's new representative to the United
States, can help pass President Chen Shui-bian's messages to
Washington more precisely, a whip of the opposition Taiwan
Solidarity Union (TSU) said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Yin Ling-ying, deputy convener of the TSU legislative caucus,
said she believes that Wu, who has been the top official in
charge of Taiwan's  policies  on China,  will be more capable
than his predecessor, David Ta-wei Lee, of grasping the mindset
and actions of China, and so will be better able to help
stabilize bilateral U.S.-Taiwan relations.
</P>
<P>
Yin said Wu, who has also been a deputy chief of staff to
President Chen Shui- bian, will also be better able to reflect
President Chen's ideas and the stance of the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) , thus helping narrow the gap between
expressed thought and received understanding that sometimes
exists between the governments of Taiwan and the United States.
</P>
<P>
The TSU lawmaker said she is fully convinced that Lee is a "one
of the kind" veteran diplomat who is commendable in both personal
learning and abilities working in the diplomatic fronts, but Lee
was sometimes been caught short when it came to fully grasping
Chen's ideas on Taiwan's identity and ensuring that these
position were completely understood by the U.S. government.
</P>
<P>
Wu's replacement  of Lee should clear up some unfortunate
circumstances that have arisen between Taipei and Washington in
the past by bringing greater precision to bilateral
communications between the countries concerned, Yin claimed.
</P>
<P>
Yin noted, however, that even though Wu performed exceptionally
during his stint as the MAC head, diplomacy is a delicate art,
and no government official should be expected to develop a good
command of it in a short period of time.
</P>
<P>
Yin called for the government to send a veteran diplomat who is
not a stranger to the U.S. diplomatic arena to serve as Wu's
deputy so that he can get into the swing of Washington operations
at an early date.
</P>
<P>
She also expressed hopes that the DPP will move quickly to
nurture a new generation of like-minded technocrats, who might
then be appointed to ministerial-level positions and facilitate
the party's services to the country and its people.
