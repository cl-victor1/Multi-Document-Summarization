Several of local scholars hailed Sunday a government plan to
appoint Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) Chairman Joseph Wu as
Taiwan's top representative to the United States, saying that
Taiwan-U.S. relations would be strengthened during his stint.
</P>
<P>
Former MAC Vice Chairman  Chen Ming-tong,  professor  Chou Chi-
hsiang at National Taiwan University's  Graduate School of
National Development and Liao Fu-teh, a law research fellow of
Academia Sinica, made the remarks after Premier Su Tseng-chang
confirmed that Wu will serve as Taiwan's top representative to
the U.S., replacing David Ta-wei Lee.
</P>
<P>
Wu has been in charge of cross-Taiwan Strait affairs for three
years and promoted cross-strait negotiations during his post, so
he has demonstrated that he is competent to serve as the nation's
top envoy to the United States, Chen said at an interview with
reporters after unveiling a draft "second republic" constitution
for Taiwan at a Taipei seminar.
</P>
<P>
Chen, who is currently a professor at National Taiwan University,
expressed confidence that Wu will be able to efficiently
communicate with authorities in Washington and represent well the
nation's proposals on the development of bilateral relations in
the future.
</P>
<P>
For his part,  Chou said that since Wu is familiar with
Taiwan-U.S. affairs, his new stint as Taiwan's top representative
to the United States will be a "plus" for the future development
of bilateral relations. He added that compared with Lee, Wu will
be better able to precisely convey President Chen Shui-bian's
ideas to the U.S. government.
</P>
<P>
Echoing Chou's viewpoints, Liao explained that Wu was in charge
of diplomatic affairs while serving as Presidential Office deputy
secretary-general,  so he has a better  understanding  of the
president's ideas on Taiwan-U.S. relations. This is the major
difference between Wu and Lee, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
According  to Ministry  of Foreign Affairs spokesman  Wang Chien-
yeh, the U.S. government has expressed its consent to Wu's
appointment, and Lee will be transferred to Canada to serve as
the nation's representative, replacing Thomas Chen, who is
retiring.
