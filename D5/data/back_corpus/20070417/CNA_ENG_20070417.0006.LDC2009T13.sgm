The Council for Economic Planning and Development (CEPD) has come
up with a pump-priming plan aimed at accelerating the development
of three of the country's major sea ports.
</P>
<P>
According to the plan approved by all of the CEPD commissioners
at a meeting Monday, the government and the private sector will
invest up to NT$33.4 billion (US$1.01 billion) over the next four
years to boost the development of three northern and northeastern
ports -- Keelung Harbor, Taipei Harbor and Suao Harbor.
</P>
<P>
The  stimulus  plan  also  covers  the  development  of a two-
kilometer-long, 250-meter-wide waterway at Taipei Harbor for
yachting and other maritime recreational activities as part of
the government's efforts to turn the nearby region into a tourism
and leisure hub, CEPD officials said.
</P>
<P>
The plan calls for an outlay of NT$5.98 billion from the national
treasury and NT$3.63 billion from the private sector for the
Keelung Harbor development, which will include construction of a
new highway linking the port to other cities and the extension of
a coastal embankment.

<P>
For the Taipei Harbor development, a total outlay of NT$23.07
billion will be needed for land reclamation as well as embankment
and infrastructure construction.
</P>
<P>
As to the development of Suao Harbor in the northeastern county
of Yilan, it will require an estimated NT$788 million, with the
government contributing about NT$258 million and the remaining
invested by provate and state-owned enterprises.
