National Chiao-tung University (NCTU) is set to launch an
international graduate program on industrial research and
development this autumn to train foreign talent for local high-
technology  companies,  sources at the Hsinchu-based university
said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Graduate students will be granted with full scholarships from
sponsor companies after admission into the program and will be
offered posts in sponsors' branch offices in other countries
after graduation, according to Wu Chung-yu, president of the
university.

<P>
Wu said that leading players in the high-tech industry, including
Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co.,  United Microelectronics
Corp., and D-Link Corp., have already decided to participate in
the program.

<P>
The program will begin in September, with an initial enrollment
of 50 students, Wu said, adding that the university expects to
train some 400 master's and doctoral degree holders under the
program over the next four years.
</P>
<P>
NCTU already provides some 100 courses taught in English, Wu
said, adding that the number is expected to increase over the
next several years.
</P>
<P>
While explaining the need for such a program, Wu noted that
Taiwan's birthrate has been declining in recent decades,
resulting in a growing shortage of high- tech talent in the
country.
</P>
<P>
"The talent pool in Taiwan is just too small to meet the needs of
high-tech companies," Wu said, adding that the program is part of
the university's solution to the "talent shortage" problem.
