Premier Su Tseng-chang said Tuesday that the Executive Yuan is
aware of the problem of low starting salaries for university
graduates with master's or bachelor's degrees and is taking
measures to address the issue.
</P>
<P>
The premier said that his "Mega Warmth, Mega Investment" project
unveiled recently, specifically targets training programs for
college students in hopes of nurturing talent to will meet the
needs of local enterprises.
</P>
<P>
The premier made the remarks during a question-and-answer session
in the Legislative Yuan.

Opposition Legislator Chao Liang-yen of the People First Party
noted that starting salaries for graduates with master's or
doctoral degrees averaged NT$31,567 (US$957) per month, and
NT$26,700 for those with bachelor's degrees, figures that are
even lower than the averages of 10 years ago according to a
survey of 2006 graduates conducted by the Council of Labor
Affairs.
</P>
<P>
Chao asked if this has to do with the rapid expansion of
universities, resulting in an oversupply of university graduates
given current demands.
</P>
<P>
The premier said that his Cabinet is aware of the problem, saying
that since the rapid expansion of universities and graduate
schools, the supply and demand did seem to be out of balance.
</P>
<P>
In addition, students having completed school programs are yet to
meet the demands of businesses, resulting in low pay for the
newcomers to the job market.
</P>
<P>
Officials from the Directorate General of the Budget, Accounting
and Statistics reported that the number of graduates with
master's or doctoral degrees was more than 48,000 in 2006, or
three times that of a decade ago, and their average starting
salary was only NT$5,000 more than the average starting salary
for those holding a bachelor's degree.
