Pineapple growers in Taiwan have received a sweet surprise this
year as an effect of global warming -- they have found the
tropical fruit has not only grown fast and ripened early, but is
also particularly sweet.
</P>
<P>
Agricultural experts at the Tainan District Agricultural Research
and Extension Station noted Tuesday that pineapples, which
usually are in season in Taiwan from May to July, have been in
abundant supply this year since March.
</P>
<P>
They pointed out that Taiwan's total pineapple crops have
exceeded 12,000 hectares, with most of the pineapple farms
located in the four southern Taiwan counties of Pingtung,
Kaohsiung, Tainan and Chiayi.
</P>
<P>
According to the experts, between 70 percent and 80 percent of
Taiwan's pineapple acreage is devoted to the most-favored Tainung
No. 17 pineapple, also known as the golden diamond pineapple.
</P>
<P>
This variety, they added, has a thin rind and a tender, golden-
yellow flesh that is juicy, rich and sweet, with a sugar content
of over 14 percent.
</P>
<P>
There has been a change in consumers' behavior patterns, the
experts continued, adding that while most pineapples were bought
by factories and canned in the past, nowadays most consumers
prefer to eat the fruit fresh.
</P>
<P>
Pineapples are low in saturated fat, cholesterol and sodium but
rich in fructose and are a good source of dietary fiber, thiamin,
Vitamin  B6, Vitamin C, calcium, iron, copper, manganese  and
potassium.
</P>
<P>
The fruit also has an anti-inflammatory effect and is said to be
exceptionally good for joint problems, the experts said.
