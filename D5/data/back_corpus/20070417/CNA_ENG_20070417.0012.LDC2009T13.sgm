TOGETHER

Taipei,  April 17 (CNA) 04/17/07  12:59:22 (By Sofia Wu)
</P>
<P>
The Executive Yuan supports the proposal of having the next
legislative and presidential elections held simultaneously,
Cabinet spokeswoman Chen Mei-ling said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Chen made the remarks after Lin Chia-lung, secretary-general of
the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) , said a day
earlier that the Presidential Office, the Executive Yuan and the
DPP share a consensus that the next presidential and legislative
elections as well as referendums on some major issues of national
concern should be held at the same time "to save financial and
social costs."
</P>
<P>
Echoing Lin's statement, Chen said Taiwan will indeed be better
off if it manages to merge some elections to save costs. "We
really have too many elections," she noted.
</P>
<P>
As to when the next presidential and legislative elections will
be held, Chen said it is up to the Central Election Commission
(CEC) to determine.
</P>
<P>
Under the current law, the election day for the next legislature
must be set six months before the term of the present legislature
expires Jan. 31, 2008.
</P>
<P>
"This means that we can wait until July to work out a schedule
for the next legislative elections, " Chen said, adding that as
the term of current CEC commissioners will expire June 16, it
should be the job of the new CEC commissioners to choose a date
for the next legislative elections.
</P>
<P>
As for DPP acting Chairman Trong Chai's proposal that referendums
on the main opposition Kuomintang's "ill-gotten" party assets and
the issue of whether the country should apply for U.N. membership
under the name of "Taiwan" ought to be held alongside the next
presidential election, Chen said it all depends on whether enough
signatures of eligible voters in support of the proposed
referendums can be collected in time.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, CEC spokesman Teng Tien-you said the Executive Yuan's
opinion about the schedule of the two upcoming elections can be
conveyed to the CEC commissioners for reference.
</P>
<P>
While the administration and the DPP authority support the idea
of holding  the next  presidential  and legislative  elections
simultaneously, Teng said, the CEC should also respect the
opinions of other sectors of society.
</P>
<P>
"Therefore, it will be left for the new Central Election
Commission to be formed in mid-June to decide whether the two
elections will be held on the same day," Teng explained.
</P>
<P>
The president's term will expire May 20,  2008,  and the
presidential election usually takes place in March of the
election year.
