MA-WANG TICKET UP TO PUBLIC MANDATE: LEGISLATIVE SPEAKER
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Kaohsiung, April 17 (CNA) 04/17/07  20:34:44 (By Flor Wang)
</P>
<P>
Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng of the Kuomintang (KMT)
said Tuesday that it seems the party is set to nominate former
Chairman Ma Ying-jeou as its candidate for the 2008 presidential
race, but whether he will serve as Ma's running mate should be
determined by the public in the coming months.
</P>
<P>
Wang made the comments while answering questions from students
after delivering a keynote speech at National Kaohsiung
University of Applied Sciences in southern Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
According to Wang, it is almost certain that Ma will be the
candidate fielded by the KMT in the next presidential election.
Given current conditions, a Ma-Wang ticket is much more feasible
than a Wang-Ma ticket, he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
That meant, the eventual formation of a Ma-Wang ticket must be
determined by receiving some sort of a public mandate in the
months ahead, after taking into account party unity and their
chances of victory given the treacherous political situation in
Taiwan, Wang stated.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on his earlier proposal that the KMT nominate another
candidate to run in the next presidential election if Ma is
convicted in the first trial on corruption charges, Wang said
that the suggestion does not represent his current personal
position and noted that a Wang-Ma ticket is almost certainly out
of the question.
</P>
<P>
Ma and Wang agreed tentatively in March to invite each other to
team up on the KMT ticket in the next presidential election no
matter who won the party's nomination out of concern that a split
would ruin the party's chances of victory.
</P>
<P>
But Ma has been dogged by an ongoing lawsuit over his alleged
embezzlement of NT$11 million in funds from a special municipal
monthly allowance earmarked for his discretionary use when he
served as mayor of Taipei from 1998-2006.
</P>
<P>
Ma stepped down from the main opposition KMT chairmanship after
being indicted in mid-February by Taipei prosecutors on
embezzlement charges but immediately announced his bid to pursue
presidency following the charges.
</P>
<P>
Despite  corruption  charges against him,  Ma picked up a
registration form early this month for the KMT's presidential
primary, highlighting his resolve to pursue his presidential
desire.
</P>
<P>
However Wang did not pick up the registration form, a development
which has stirred up concern that he might run as an independent
instead of being Ma's running mate.
</P>
<P>
The Taipei District Court opened hearings on Ma's case April 3
and a second session was held Tuesday.
