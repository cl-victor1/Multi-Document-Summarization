Two ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) presidential
hopefuls Monday unveiled the results of polls conducted by their
two respective camps, with each claiming greater popularity than
the other.

According to the electoral campaign office of former premier
Frank Hsieh, two public opinion polls excluding opposition pan-
blue camp supporters showed that his popularity exceeding that of
Premier Su Tseng-chang, another presidential hopeful. In a Hsieh-
camp-conducted poll, which excluded pan-blue supporters, Hsieh
led by 9 percent, while his edge over Su reached 23 percent in a
"pan- green" supporters-only poll.

<P>
The results of a poll released by Su's campaign office showed
that Su's popularity slightly outstripped Hsieh's by 0.1
percentage point.

<P>
Hsieh and Su find themselves in a toss in terms of poll ratings
in the DPP primary, which also includes Vice President Annette Lu
and DPP Chairman Yu Shyi- kun.
</P>
<P>
According to the DPP primary system, popularity among general
voters will account for 70 percent of one hopeful's chance in
winning party nomination for the presidential election, while the
voting results by party members will account for the other 30
percent of the candidate's final score.

Wu Ping-jui, a DPP legislator with close ties to Su, blasted
Hsieh's group for what he described as unbearable degree of
opinion poll and media manipulation.
