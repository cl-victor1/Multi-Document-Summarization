New York,  April 16 (CNA) 04/17/07  18:40:13 (By J. P. Huang and

A tourism promotional group from Taiwan met Monday with over 100
local counterparts in New York on the first leg of a U.S. tour
that will take it to Los Angeles and San Francisco in the coming
days as the summer travel peak season approaches.
</P>
<P>
The delegation, composed of officials from the Taiwan Visitors
Association (TVA) and representatives from Taiwan-based aviation
companies and tour agencies, sponsored an audiovisual
presentation featuring Taiwan's music, dance and attraction
points to New Yorkers as part of its efforts to sell Taiwan to
U.S. tourists.

<P>
As Beijing is to host the 2008 Olympic Games, Taiwan should grab
the chance to promote "theme travel" while the world's attention
is focused on the region, tourism executives opined.
</P>
<P>
According to Chang Cheng-yuan, director of the Tourism Bureau
under the Ministry of Transportation and Communications (MOTC),
North American tourists have in recent years become more aware of
Taiwan, and Asia has increasingly turned into a major out-bound
travel destination among U. S. visitors.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to Taiwan's position as a prime transfer hub in Asia, the
country is strongly placed to court more tourists from the United
States, Chang said.
</P>
<P>
In the first three months of this year, more than 97,000 business
travelers and tourists from North America visited Taiwan, up by 3
percent over the previous year's level, MOTC statistics showed.
</P>
<P>
TVA Secretary-General Ju Hung-hai voiced his belief that Taipei
101 and the National  Palace Museum in Taipei are definitely
world-class tourist attractions. A tour package that connects
these tourist points in Taipei with interesting spots in central
and southern Taiwan would make an intriguing trip for tourists,
he said.
</P>
<P>
Lee Yung-chun, manager of the Taipei-based China Airlines' New
York office, echoed Chang's view favoring spreading theme travel
in Taiwan. Taiwan's delicious food, spas, and natural scenery are
features that should be better packaged to court more foreign
visitors, he said.
</P>
<P>
An executive of the New York chapter of the Pacific Asia Travel
Association suggested Taiwan "take the initiative" in finding new
ways to lure foreign tourists, besides relying on its natural
landscapes.
</P>
<P>
For instance, he said, Taiwan should be keen to popularize
sporting activities, such as rock climbing, water-borne motor
racing, and seasonal festivals taking advantage of its beautiful
mountains and beaches.
</P>
<P>
Although the travel industry executive acknowledged that Taiwan
faces difficulties in highlighting its attractions due to the
proximity  to China, Japan and other popular southeast Asian
destinations, he contended that Taiwan must show that it possess
something unique or interesting that tourists will consider worth
exploring.
