DPP LAWMAKER SUGGESTS `NOMINAL' PRESIDENCY IN 2008

Taipei,  March  19 (CNA) 03/19/07  20:30:17 (By Deborah Kuo)

Voicing support for a draft "second republic" constitution that
was proposed by a think tank Sunday, ruling Democratic
Progressive Party Legislator Chen Chin-de suggested Monday that
Taiwan strip the president of his powers and have only a
"nominal" president elected from 2008.
</P>
<P>
The draft constitution -- penned by National Taiwan University
Professor Chen Ming-tong and two other co-authors and presented
at a colloquium organized by the pro-independence Taiwan
Thinktank -- proposed  that Taiwan  change  the government
system  from a semi-presidential to parliamentary one that lets
legislators assume half of the ministerial positions in an
administration, which would be called a "Department of State" or
a "State Council " rather than the existing "Executive Yuan."
</P>
<P>
The draft constitution  proposes downsizing the five-branch
government to only three branches, with the Examination Yuan
replaced by a commission established under the executive branch
and the Control Yuan's investigative authority taken over by the
legislature.
</P>
<P>
The draft constitution also extends the presidential term from
four years to six and eliminates the position of vice president.
</P>
<P>
Expressing firm support for the draft constitution, Chen Chin-de
suggested that the legislators begin from this legislative
session the process of constitutional  reforms  based on 177
articles stipulated in the draft "second republic" constitution.
</P>
<P>
The content of the discussed constitutional reforms could then be
put to a vote in a nationwide referendum that could be held in
tandem with the year-end legislative election, said Chen.
</P>
<P>
If the constitutional reform stipulations are passed in the
referendum, he said, they could be implemented in 2008, when a
"nominal" president will be elected by legislators rather than by
the general public.
</P>
<P>
He courted support for the draft constitution from the four DPP
presidential aspirants, as well as from Legislative Yuan Speaker
Wang Jin-pyng and former opposition Kuomintang Chairman Ma Ying-
jeou, who are in a deadlock over who should represent the KMT in
the 2008 race.
