The 2007 Taipei International Cycle Show -- the largest bicycle

According to the event's organizer, the quasi-official Taiwan

Foreign exhibitors from 30 countries and areas, including the

Holland, the United Kingdom and Australia, and major domestic

After 20 years of efforts by Taiwan's bike manufacturers in the
fields of R&amp;D, innovation and marketing, the Taipei
International Cycle Show has become the world's third largest
such event, behind only the annual events held in Germany and the
United States, the official pointed out.

Affairs, Taiwan exported 3.09 million bicycles in the first nine
months of 2006, with a total export value of US$590 million.
