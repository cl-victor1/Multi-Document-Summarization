<P>
A ring that has been smuggling rare birds into Taiwan from China
was cracked Monday in a joint effort by seven government
agencies.
</P>
<P>
Backed up by Taoyuan-based police, members of the Taoyuan
District Prosecutor's Office apprehended the ringleader, surnamed
Chen, and a dozen other accomplices, along with 38 rare birds
from China, in a sweeping action from Sunday to Monday across a
wide area ranging from Taipei to Hsinchu.
</P>
<P>
The prosecutors discovered that Chen operated the bird smuggling
ring "systematically" by first traveling to southern Chinese
cities, particularly Guangzhou, to make the purchases of rare
wild birds that fetch high prices in Taiwan pet markets.
</P>
<P>
Chen then contracted accomplices as mules who would transport the
birds in their hand luggage, which would carry tags showing the
words "examined" or "passed, " according to Lee Yun-lien, a
prosecutor from Taoyuan.
</P>
<P>
The birds would then be sold to pet shops in Hsinchuang and
Sanchung cities in Taipei County.
</P>
<P>
Lee said Chen and his ring made at least 20 smuggling trips over
the past two years, bringing in over 1,000 wild birds.
</P>
<P>
All 38 confiscated rare birds, including green-eyed nun babblers,
were destroyed as they were from China, a declared avian flu-
affected area, said officials from the Bureau of Animal and Plant
Inspection and Quarantine under the Council of Agriculture, who
also took part in the operation.
