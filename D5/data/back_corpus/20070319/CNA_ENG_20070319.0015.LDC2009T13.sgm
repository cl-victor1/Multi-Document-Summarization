JUSTICE MINISTER LUKEWARM ON CANING
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Taipei,  March 19 (CNA) 03/19/07  15:28:11 (By Deborah Kuo)

<P>
Justice Minister Shih Mao-lin said Monday that caning is a form
of punishment that has been gradually discarded in democratic
societies and that discussions will be conducted to determine
whether caning should be introduced into Taiwan's judicial
system.
</P>
<P>
Shih said the Ministry of Justice (MOJ) will call a meeting in a
month to solicit the views of experts and to discuss, based on
diverse factors, including human rights protection and social
values, whether caning should be introduced into the country's
judicial system as a form of punishment to be used on convicted
criminals, particularly rapists.
</P>
<P>
Shih made the remarks in response to a suggestion last week by
several legislators that serial rapists should be caned in
addition to serving prison terms as part of efforts to correct
their deviant behavior.
</P>
<P>
The legislators made the suggestion in the wake of the arrest of
two men suspected of gang raping a medical school co-ed after
abducting her from the MRT's Jientan Station in Shihlin in the
wee hours of March 11. One of the suspects, Lin Shih-chieh, is
also suspected of having robbed and raped a 60 -year-old female
taxi driver hours prior to his arrest on March 17.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Shih said, the MOJ will also decide in a month whether
the three- month assessment period for electronic monitoring of
convicted rapists released on parole should be shortened to two
weeks.
</P>
<P>
The MOJ decided last November to attach electronic detectors to
the wrists of convicted rapists released on parole to monitor
their behavior. However,  the detectors will only be used after
an "assessment period" of three months following a rapists
release on parole, according to the MOJ program.
</P>
<P>
Some lawmakers have questioned the appropriateness  of the three-
month "assessment  period,  " with opposition Kuomintang
Legislator Lo Shih-hsiung claiming that it could put people at
risk of falling prey to repeat offenders.
