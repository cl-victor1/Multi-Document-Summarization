HIGH SPEED RAILWAY NOT FRIENDLY TO INDIVIDUAL TOURISTS: OFFICIAL
</HEADLINE>

The high speed railway between Taipei in the north and Kaohsiung
in the south is not friendly to individual tourists, Tourism
Bureau Director-General Janice Lai said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Lai made the remarks on the sidelines of a legislative committee
meeting in which Minister of Transportation and Communications
Tsai Duei reported on the integration of transportation resources
and tourism development after the inauguration of the high speed
rail system in February, which cuts travel time between Taipei
and Kaohsiung to 90 minutes from the previous four hours.
</P>
<P>
Legislators across the party spectrum questioned the traffic
situations at stations on the railway, saying that passengers
often find it inconvenient to get to their destination after
exiting the stations.
</P>
<P>
"The high speed railway is indeed not friendly to individual
passengers," Lai admitted.
</P>
<P>
Tourism Bureau officials also said that the bureau has recently
invited foreign travel operators to experience the railway for
themselves.
</P>
<P>
Local air carriers have offered 300 tickets to the bureau, but
the Taiwan High- speed Rail Corp. (THSRC), the operator of the
345-km railway, have offered only "PR services."
</P>
<P>
The bureau had originally planned to place tourism brochures at
various stations on the system, but later aborted the plan after
the THSRC demanded an annual payment of NT$1 million (US$30,300)
to place tourism information with travel agents setting up
counters at high speed railway stations.
</P>
<P>
Lai noted that the bureau has had a better experience working
with the Taiwan Railway Administration (TRA) , saying that the
TRA distributes tourism handbooks and offers a 20 percent
discount for a round-island rail trip, which she said helps the
bureau's efforts in promoting tourism among backpackers.
</P>
<P>
Tourism officials said the bureau has offered tourism information
at TRA stations for many years and that the TRA only charges a
symbolic sum of NT$600 per month for this.
