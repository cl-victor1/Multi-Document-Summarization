TAIWAN POST TO ASSESS IMPACT OF BUDGET FREEZE
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  March  19 (CNA) 03/19/07  19:38:27 (By Lilian Wu)

Taiwan Post Co. acting Chairman Ho Nuan-hsien said Monday that
the impact on the operation of the company will need to be
assessed after its budget for this year was frozen by the
Legislative Yuan.
</P>
<P>
Ho made the remarks after a legislative joint committee of budget
and transportations voted 15-9 to freeze the budget of the Taiwan
Post during a preliminary screening.
</P>
<P>
Ho noted that the company has around 25,000 staff and said he has
to keep the company operating normally. He vowed to continue
communicating on the issue with the Legislative Yuan.
</P>
<P>
He also said he will send revised post bills concerning the
operation of the company -- which have become necessary since the
recent name-change of the company -- to the legislature for
screening.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan Post Co. recorded revenues of NT$337.33 billion and
spending of NT$325.78 billion last year with an after-tax surplus
of NT$11.55 billion.
</P>
<P>
In Monday's legislative session, legislators from the main
opposition Kuomintang (KMT), unhappy with the recent name-change,
boycotted the screening of the budget through filibusters, saying
that they should screen the budget of the Chunghwa Post Co.,
instead of the Taiwan Post Co.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan Post Co. was originally named Chunghwa Post Co., but under
a government's name-change drive that aims to remove references
of "China" or "Chinese" from the titles of state-owned companies
to avoid confusion with similarly named counterparts in China, it
changed to its present name recently. Chunghwa can be translated
as China.
</P>
<P>
The joint committees also passed a motion proposed by KMT
Legislator Chen Chieh demanding that the freeze can only be
lifted after proposed revised post bills pass legislative
screening.
