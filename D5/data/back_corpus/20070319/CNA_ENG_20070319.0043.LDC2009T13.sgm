</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  March 19 (CNA) 03/19/07  23:58:11 (By Sofia Wu)

<P>
The government has offered various kinds of cash subsidies to
more than 219,000 children from impoverished families, the
Ministry of the Interior (MOI) said in a press statement released
Monday.
</P>
<P>
The ministry issued the press release after a local daily, China
Times, claimed in a front page story the same day that more than
360,000 local children live on the verge of poverty line, but
only 75,000 of them have obtained the low-income family status to
qualify for government subsidies.
</P>
<P>
The paper further said nearly 40 percent of disadvantaged
families under the care of the Taiwan Fund for Children and
Families rely solely on the foundation's aid. The paper therefore
concluded that there are holes in Taiwan's social security net.
</P>
<P>
However, the MOI press statement said the figure reported by the
paper was incomplete and that the actual number far exceeded
219,000 in 2006.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the 75,000 children who received government cash
subsidies for low-income families, the statement said, more than
109,000 children and teenagers received subsidies offered under
an aid program for middle-low-income families.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, 22,000-plus children received government subsidies
under an aid project for women in extraordinary conditions and
another 7,800-plus children and adolescents were granted
emergency living subsidies under a special aid program for
disadvantaged families.
</P>
<P>
To sum up,  the MOI press statement  said the number of
disadvantaged children who received financial aid from the
government last year was well over 219,000.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, the statement went on, the government has
devoted much more financial and manpower resources into aid
projects for disadvantaged families to ensure that youngsters
around the country receive proper care. Over the past year, it
added, the central government has offered funds for city and
county governments to hire an additional 320 case workers to
offer emergency aid and relief for children, particularly those
from high-risk families or those have experienced domestic
violence.
