Visiting Republic of China Minister of Foreign Affairs James
Huang laid emphasis Sunday on reinforcing Taiwan's relations with
the United States, pledging that his ministry will go all out to
enhance bilateral contacts.

Huang, who arrived in Dallas the day before to attend a board
meeting of the Taiwanese Chambers of Commerce of North America
(TCCNA) being held March 16-18, made the remarks at a dinner
party he hosted in honor of leaders of Taiwanese expatriate
communities in Dallas.

<P>
"The Taiwan-U.S. relationship is the most important work of the
Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) , so seeking to upgrade
Taiwan's ties with the United States is of great importance, "
Huang told dozens of ranking executives from major Taiwanese
associations present at the banquet.

Huang said that while taking part in the TCCNA's board meeting,
he has found that the Taiwanese communities in Dallas have forged
close relations with and received support from mainstream society
in the United States. He also voiced the hope that all Taiwanese
expatriates will continue to back and assist the government in
promoting Taiwan-U.S. relations.

Touching on Taiwan's current diplomatic work with the United
States, Huang said that the government has made signing a
Taiwan-U.S. free trade agreement a top priority and that the MOFA
will go all out to help achieve the goal as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Huang continued, the MOFA will also seek to enhance
regular communications between the two nations so that U.S.
officials can keep abreast of Taiwan's social and political
developments, which he stressed will be conducive to a closer
Taiwan-U.S. relationship.
</P>
<P>
Huang is scheduled to leave the United States for Taiwan Monday
after taking part in a planned "Dallas Night" activity to mark
the closing of the TCCNA's annual meeting.
