Taiwan officials in charge of China affairs expressed Tuesday
their confusion concerning China's stance of regarding the
participation of Taiwan officials in a video conference held last
week by two civil groups in Hong Kong as "interference" in the
domestic affairs of the former British colony.
</P>
<P>
Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) Chairman Joseph Wu and Government
Information Office Minister Cheng Wen-tsang were invited by the
Friends of Hong Kong and Macau Association and the Hong Kong
Democratic Development Network to attend the Dec. 31 conference
on democratic development in Taiwan and Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
However, their speeches during the video conference incurred
criticism from Chinese officials stationed in Hong Kong who
censured "the Taiwan Government" for "attempting to interfere in
Hong Kong's affairs in the name of democracy."
</P>
<P>
"It is not understandable, " said MAC officials in a response to
inquiries  by the media regarding the criticism and Beijing's
concerns, which they described as "redundant and unnecessary."
</P>
<P>
The officials also said the video conference was nothing more
than a platform for opinion exchanges between Taiwan and Hong
Kong.
</P>
<P>
"Such a conference, focusing on the current situation regarding
Hong Kong's democratic development, is good for the two sides to
know each other better, " they said, adding that Taiwan's
government and its Hong Kong counterpart should encourage all
kinds of exchanges between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
"Only exchanges can enhance mutual understanding, narrowing the
distance between the two sides, " the officials said.
