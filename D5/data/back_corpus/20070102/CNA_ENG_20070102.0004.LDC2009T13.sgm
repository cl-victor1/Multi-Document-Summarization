Taipei,  Jan.  1 (CNA) 01/02/07  10:34:22 (By Sofia Wu)

Vice President Annette Lu said Monday she will push for the
opening of at least 100 after-school classes before the upcoming
winter vacation to assist disadvantaged children in doing
homework or curriculum study.
</P>
<P>
Lu announced her new work plan while delivering a speech at a
concert-prayer service  at  the  Taipei  county  government's
multifunction conference hall. The service was organized by the
National  Culture Association's  Religion Committee,  with the
participation of representatives from 12 groups in various
religions, including Buddhism, Christianity and Catholicism.

<P>
Noting that the wealth gap between the rich and the poor has been
widening rapidly in recent years, Lu said she feels compelled to
help children from disadvantaged families find enjoyment in
reading so as to enable them to emerge from poverty through
education.
</P>
<P>
"It is hoped that government agencies, private groups, churches
or temples can provide places for the planned after-school
classes for children from single- parent families, indigenous
families or new immigrant families, " Lu said, adding that
retired teachers, civil servants and college students will be
recruited to tutor those disadvantaged schoolchildren.
</P>
<P>
Lu said she hopes a total of 1,000 such classes can be opened
around the country by the end of 2007.
