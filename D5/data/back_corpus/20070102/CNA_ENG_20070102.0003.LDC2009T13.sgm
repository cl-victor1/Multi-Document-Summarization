KMT SHOULD RETURN ILL-GOTTEN PARTY ASSETS TO STATE COFFERS: MOF
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  Jan. 1 (CNA) 01/02/07  10:33:21 (By Sofia Wu)

The main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) should return all of its
ill-gotten party assets to the nation's coffers instead of
selling them or secretly transferring them to individuals,
Ministry of Finance (MOF) officials said Monday.
</P>
<P>
The officials made the remarks after KMT Chairman Ma Ying-jeou
said earlier in the day that the party -- which ruled Taiwan
under an authoritarian party-state system for more than five
decades until 2000 -- will settle the asset issue by the end of
June.
</P>
<P>
In response, President Chen Shui-bian said the same day that it
is unacceptable for the KMT to sell off or secretly transfer
assets it improperly acquired during its authoritarian rule. The
people of Taiwan will not be fooled by the KMT's euphemism that
describes the sale of these ill-gotten assets as "dealing with
its assets, " Chen said.
</P>
<P>
Senior MOF officials echoed the president's comments, saying the
KMT has actually already sold many of its ill-gotten assets.
</P>
<P>
"If the KMT is sincere about legally disposing of its improperly
acquired assets, it should support the passage of a draft bill
that would authorize the government to take back its ill-gotten
assets. Otherwise, playing with words will fool no one, " said an
MOF official.
