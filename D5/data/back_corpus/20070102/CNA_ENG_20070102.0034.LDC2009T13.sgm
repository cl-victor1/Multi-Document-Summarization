A 220-strong high speed rail police force has been formed to
oversee Taiwan's much-heralded bullet train system later this
week, the National Police Agency (NPA) announced Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
An NPA official said that the high speed rail policemen will be
in charge of maintaining ride safety and order after the Taiwan
High Speed Rail Corp. formally starts passenger transportation
services Jan. 5.

<P>
According to the official,  the NPA has also revised the
regulations governing the allocation of powers and duties of
railway police stations and different- level police authorities,
due to the overlapping of their jurisdictions along the bullet
train course.
</P>
<P>
The nation's first high speed railway, 345 km in length, which
uses the first exported Japanese bullet trains, will link the
capital Taipei in the north and the southern city of Kaohsiung
with a journey time of around 90 minutes.
