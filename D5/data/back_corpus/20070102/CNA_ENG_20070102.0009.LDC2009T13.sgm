A total of 801 students from various levels of schools around the
country died between January and November 2006, with accidents
accounting for 74 percent of the deaths, according to tallies
released Tuesday by the Ministry of Education (MOE).

Of these accidental deaths, 65 percent were caused by traffic
accidents (and 13 percent were caused by suicide) or self-injury,
the tallies show.

Suicide rose from third in the previous year to become the second
most common cause of accidental death among Taiwan students in
2006, with a total of 77 students killing themselves during the
first 11 months of the year, most of whom were college or
university students, according to the tallies.

Wang Fu-lin, head of the ministry's Department of Military
Training Education, noted that the number of suicides among
students has been increasing over the past two years.

<P>
In light of the situation, the MOE has requested that schools pay
attention to the emotional problems of their students and track
students suffering from depression and those at high risk of
committing suicide, Wang said.
