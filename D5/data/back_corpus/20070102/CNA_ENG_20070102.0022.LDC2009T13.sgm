Taiwan's Academia Sinica will set up 25 seismic observation
stations in northern Vietnam, in order to better understand the
Red River fault zone in terms of tectonic structure and the cause
of earthquakes, a spokesman for the National Science Council
(NSC) said Tuesday.

<P>
The construction of the stations -- funded via NSC's "Initiative
on Southeast Asia Earth System" (ISEE) program -- will be
supervised by Huang Bor-shouh, deputy director of Academia
Sinica's Institute of Earth Sciences.

Vietnam as a rising market and production base needs precise
tectonic, seismic, and climate data to convince business
executives that it is safe to relocate their manufacturing
centers there, Huang said, adding that however, Vietnam still
lack the capacity for conducting such surveys, so they chose to
cooperate with Taiwan, its long-time partner in tectonic and
seismic research.

Huang explained that the Red River fault stretches over 1,000
kilometers from Tibet to the north of Vietnam. Therefore, the
objective is to determine the nature of interactions between the
Himalayan Orogeny and activities along the Red River fault, in
hopes of better understanding the cause and effect of earthquakes
there, he said.
