A medical team at China Medical University Hospital has recently
performed Taiwan's first combined kidney and liver transplant
from a living donor.
</P>
<P>
Information about the successful operation was reported Tuesday
when the 55 -year-old patient, Chiu Huo-yen, accompanied by his
wife and daughter, paid a visit to the hospital to thank the
medical team for giving him a new lease on life.
</P>
<P>
According to Chiu, a blood test taken before he donated blood 10
years ago found that he had contracted hepatitis B.
</P>
<P>
His health began to decline five years ago and in October last
year, he was laid low by multiple complications, including
jaundice, acute liver failure and deteriorating kidney function.
Despite five plasma exchanges and six bouts of kidney dialysis,
he lapsed into a coma.
</P>
<P>
Chiu's son and daughter decided to try to save their father's
life by donating their own organs. After evaluating them, the
doctors at China Medical University Hospital decided to use the
daughter's left kidney and a lobe of the son's liver.
</P>
<P>
According to Chiu's medical team, the combined liver and kidney
transplant took place Nov. 7 and lasted 22 hours.
</P>
<P>
Chiu's daughter was discharged from hospital five days later and
and his son left after seven days. Chiu himself stayed in the
hospital for about three weeks.
</P>

A simultaneous live donor liver and kidney transplant surgery is
a highly technical, multidisciplinary procedure, the first of
which was reportedly carried out in early 1999 by Brazilian
doctors at the Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein in Sao Paolo,
who said they saved a 53-year-old man with a kidney and part of
the liver of his 26-year-old son.
</P>
<P>
The Lahey Clinic, a teaching hospital in Massachusetts, the
United States, reports that its doctors had successfully
performed six such surgeries as of late 2005.
