The central government's assistance to local governments to
develop their distinctive tourism features in recent years has
borne fruit, and the efforts should continue, Tourism Bureau
Director-General Janice Lai said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Lai made the remarks after the Council for Economic Planning and
Development decided that the "Tourism Development Fund" will no
longer subsidize local governments in tourism development
starting from 2008 and that the money saved will be used in
promoting Taiwan internationally.
</P>
<P>
The Tourism Bureau estimated that the "Tourism Development Fund"
is about NT$2.4 billion (US$72.72 million) a year, and the
subsidy to local governments to develop tourism is about NT$550
million this year.
</P>
<P>
Lai noted that each local government has worked to develop their
distinctive tourism spots in recent years under the program,
citing Chinshan in Taipei County and Pagua scenic spot in
Changhua as examples.
</P>
<P>
If money from the "Tourism Development Fund" can no longer be
provided, the central government should consider appropriating
funds from other areas to subsidize local governments' efforts to
develop their distinctive tourism, she said.
