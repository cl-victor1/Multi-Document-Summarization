ANTI-NUKE 4 GROUP HOLDS PETITION MARCH IN TAIPEI CITY
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

Taipei,  May 19 (CNA) 05/19/07  17:54:11 (By Elizabeth Hsu)

Members of the Nuke-4 Referendum Initiative Association (Nuke-4
RIA) took to the streets Saturday morning to call for the
government to "correct" the flaws in the existing Referendum Law.
</P>
<P>
Former Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) Chairman Lin Yi-hsiung
was also among the marchers who set off from in front of the
Lungshan Temple in downtown Taipei City and walked toward the
headquarters of the Executive Yuan and the Legislative Yuan to
deliver two petition letters to the heads of each of the yuans.
</P>
<P>
During the march, Lin, who is an outspoken activist dedicated to
pushing for a nuclear-free homeland, maintained his silence in
the face of questions from reporters.
</P>
<P>
According to the Nuke-4 RIA, the civil group believes there are
five major flaws in the current Referendum Law, which was passed
by the Legislative Yuan Nov. 27, 2003.
</P>
<P>
The flaws include the setting up of a committee comprised of
members of political parties in proportion to the number of seats
each party holds in the legislature to screen proposed referendum
topics and to make rules for implementing referendums after they
are approved.
</P>
<P>
The design of such a supervisory committee undermines the
people's right to referendum, according to the Nuke-4 RIA, which
believes  there should be no limitations  on the topics  for
referendums. Therefore, such a committee should be abolished, the
association said.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the Nuke-4 RIA criticized the requirement that 0.5
percent of registered voters' signatures must be collected in
order for a referendum petition to be successful as well as the
current requirement that at least 50 percent of registered voters
must cast ballots in a referendum to make it valid, saying both
thresholds are too high and do not reflect the spirit of direct
democracy.
</P>
<P>
Nuke-4 RIA chief executive Iap Phok-bun, who led the march, urged
the ruling DPP to make the association's petition part of the
joint political platform of DPP candidates  running in the year-
end legislative elections. "Only such a move can be described as
truly answering the people's demand, " Iap said.
