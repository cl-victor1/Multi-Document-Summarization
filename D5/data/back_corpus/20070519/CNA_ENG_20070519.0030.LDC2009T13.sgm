Taipei County Magistrate Chou Hsi-wei said Saturday that the
county has stopped putting stray dogs to death, but this is a
problem that needs to be addressed by the nation.
</P>
<P>
Chou made the remarks amid reports that Taiwan tycoon Terry Guo
promised to help set up stray dog shelter centers around the
island after he was moved when Chia Hung-chiu, a 50-year-old
teacher who gave away her monthly salary of NT$50,000 to take
care of 150 stray dogs, knelt in front of one of his companies to
solicit his assistance.
</P>
<P>
The magistrate said that he appreciates the efforts by Guo and
the teacher to help solve the stray dog problem, stressing that
the Taipei County government has stopped putting stray dogs to
sleep and has begun proposing ways to shelter stray dogs and
provide them with medical care.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the number of stray dogs caught by the county has
increased by 10,000 every year, and the county has started
looking for larger land lots to shelter them.
</P>
<P>
Chou said that owners abandoning their pets has caused a social
problem, and the government should start dealing with the problem
by making changes to the law to require that dog owners take up
their responsibility.
</P>
<P>
He said the stray dog problem is a social one, noting that some
of the dogs attack people. He added that the law has allowed city
and county governments to put stray dogs to sleep if they can't
deal with them.
</P>
<P>
Killing dogs is indeed cruel, but as the number of stray dogs is
increasing at an ever expanding rate, "mercy killing is the
common way of the world to deal with the problem," Chou said.
