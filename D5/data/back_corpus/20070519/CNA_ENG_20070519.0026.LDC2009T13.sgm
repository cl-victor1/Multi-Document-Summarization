NATIONAL IDENTITY ISSUE NOT VAGUE IN 2008 PRESIDENTIAL RACE:
ACADEMIA
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  May  19 (CNA) 05/19/07  21:13:28 (By Chris Wang)

There is no denying that Taiwan has a national identity problem,
and the problem is not a vague or tiring issue in the 2008
presidential election, academia said in a forum Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"The national identity problem is not vague. It's real in
everyday life. It's involved in almost every facet of our
national policy -- economy, trade, investment, and national
defense, to name a few, " said Michael Hsiao, executive director
of Academia Sinica's Center for Asia Pacific Area Studies.
</P>
<P>
Hsiao presented his argument while answering a question by a
foreign representative in a seasonal forum titled "Presidential
Election and Domestic Politics, " which was organized by Taiwan
Thinktank  to  provide  foreign representatives  with  timely
interpretations of Taiwan's politics.
</P>
<P>
The  representative,  one of more  than  a dozen  foreign
representatives who attended the forum, wondered whether people
of Taiwan want to see a more concrete and practical platform from
the presidential candidates and parties because the issue has
been brought up time and time again in past elections.
</P>
<P>
"The problem of identity is not identity alone, it includes
everything, " Hsiao concluded.
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes, it may look like national identity is the only issue
in Taiwan's election campaign. It is, however, the unique
situation Taiwan has been in, " said David Huang, an associate
research fellow at Academia Sinica who once served as vice
chairman of the Mainland Affairs Council (MAC).
</P>
<P>
The reason why national identity has been the primary focus in
Taiwan's elections is partly due to the fact that the campaign
agenda was set up by politicians and the media, and not the
voters, Huang said.
</P>
<P>
"Whenever China said something or the Taiwan government did
something, it hit the front pages of newspapers the next day, "
he added.
</P>
<P>
Voters look for "information shortcuts" to compare candidates'
agendas with their own, while political parties and candidates
try to mobilize voters with simple and clear "symbols, " making
national identity "one of the most efficient catalysts in any
election," Huang said.
</P>
<P>
More than 15 foreign representatives in Taiwan attended the two-
hour forum.
