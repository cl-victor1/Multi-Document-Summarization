Taipei,  May 19 (CNA) 05/19/07  18:37:40 (By Elizabeth Hsu)

President Chen Shui-bian presided over a ceremony Saturday to
unveil the plaque for the "National Taiwan Democracy Memorial
Hall, " the new name of the Chiang Kai-shek Memorial Hall in
Taipei City.
</P>
<P>
In his address, Chen described the name change as realization of
the ideas and spirit of democracy, and "space liberalization." He
also indicated that the main archway of the hall, which was named
after late President Chiang Kai-shek, should be renamed "freedom
plaza."
</P>
<P>
Chen noted that his proposed change will not violate regulations
concerning protected historic monuments.
</P>
<P>
Also present at the ceremony were former Premier Su Tseng-chang
and Minister of Education Tu Cheng-sheng. They visited a special
exhibition, titled "Farewell, President Chiang, " organized by
the 228 Incident Memorial Foundation in the hall after the
ceremony.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Taipei City Bureau of Cultural Affairs demanded
that the Ministry of Education (MOE) pull down two huge cloth
posters hung at the front and back sides of the high-profile hall
as part of advertisements for the exhibition because the posters
have blocked views of the protected historic monument and thus
are in violation of the law concerning protection of the
country's cultural assets.
</P>
<P>
In response to the demand, Vice Minister of Education Chou Tsan-
der explained that the MOE had informed the bureau about how the
banners, featuring images of Taiwanese indigenous lilies, would
be hung before receiving its approval. The MOE did not act to
damage the monument, Chou stressed, adding that the ministry will
talk with the bureau again on the issue.

<P>
Some 700 police officers were mobilized to maintain order in the
hall complex prior to the controversial name-change ceremony.
