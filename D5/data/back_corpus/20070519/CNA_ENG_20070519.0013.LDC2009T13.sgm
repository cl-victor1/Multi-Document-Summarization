Taiwan ranks 7th in the world in the Digital Opportunity Index
(DOI) evaluation in the World Information Society Report 2007,
the National Information and Communication Initiative (NICI) said
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The report was released by the International Telecommunication
Union (ITU), an organization promoting international cooperation
in telecommunication affairs under the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan moved up three spots from a ranking of 10th in last year's
survey of 181 economies around the world, according to the NICI.
</P>
<P>
The Digital Opportunity Index is based on 11 core information and
communication technology indicators grouped in three clusters --
opportunity, infrastructure and utilization.
</P>
<P>
In this year's evaluation, Taiwan ranks 2nd in infrastructure,
behind only Denmark, 6th in opportunity, and 23rd in utilization,
the NICI said.
</P>
<P>
The NICI pointed out that the government passed the National
Information and Communication Development project at the end of
March to spend NT$55.6 billion (US$1.66 billion) between
2007-2011 on reinforcing Taiwan's information and communication
technologies infrastructure to ensure a top ranking in the
evaluation.
