Taiwan Fertilizer Co., a privatized enterprise, and CPC Taiwan,
the state-run oil refinery, will invest NT$2 billion (US$59.92
million) to set up a joint venture to produce alcohol-gasoline
blends for motor vehicles in Taiwan, a spokesman for the Ministry
of Economic Affairs announced Friday.

The spokesman said the investment will be made within a month to
set up a new company to produce alcohol using sugarcane and sweet
potatoes as raw material and that the alcohol will be used to
produce an alcohol-gasoline blend containing 3 percent alcohol.

The Ministry of Economic Affairs will set up seven filling
stations in Taipei in September to supply the gasohol produced by
the new company, and work out a plan to encourage motorists to
use the fuel through subsidies, according to the spokesman.
