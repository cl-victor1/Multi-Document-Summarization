Washington,  May  18  (CNA) 05/19/07  18:35:52 (By Chiehyu Lin
and Y.F. Low)
</P>
<P>
Republic of China President Chen Shui-bian is scheduled to hold a
video conference May 29 with international media based in the
U.S. capital.
</P>
<P>
The event is being organized by the Washington-based National
Press Club (NPC) , with Chen invited as a newsmaker to discuss
the theme of "Democratic Taiwan: Challenges and Perspectives."
</P>
<P>
Although Beijing has protested to the club over the event, the
organizer Peter Hickman has brushed aside the intervention.
</P>
<P>
Hickman has been very friendly to Taiwan and has invited many
Taiwan politicians to deliver speeches at the NPC over the past
several years. He has also ignored Beijing's demand that the NPC
remove the ROC flag placed in its lobby.
</P>
<P>
While the president, vice president and other high-ranking
officials of Taiwan have been forbidden from visiting Washington,
D.C. after the United States switched recognition from Taipei to
Beijing, the video conference will be a good opportunity for Chen
to promote Taiwan in the international arena.
</P>
<P>
Chen held a video conference with international media in Geneva
last week to promote Taiwan's bid to become a full member of the
World  Health  Organization, following  a similar  event with
politicians, academics and media representatives in Germany last
month.
