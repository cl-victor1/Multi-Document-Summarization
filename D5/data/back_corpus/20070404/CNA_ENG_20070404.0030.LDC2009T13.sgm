Members of the public who observe the tomb sweeping custom to pay
homage to the memory of their ancestors should take precautions
to guard against skin infections,  a dermatologist in Taichung
cautioned Wednesday.

<P>
Chen Chun-yi, who runs a skin clinic, told reporters that the
number of patients he and his colleagues have treated in the past
few days has increased 30 percent, with most of them suffering
from infections as a result of either sunburn or mosquito and
other insect bites sustained during their tomb sweeping trips.

<P>
According to Chen, these patients have told him that they swept
their ancestors' tombs ahead of the April 5 Tomb Sweeping Day
because they wanted to avoid the traffic congestion over the long
weekend.

<P>
Failing to protect themselves against insects and the sun, many
of them contracted acute skin infections, developed rashes all
over their bodies and suffered from headaches, breathing
difficulty, perspiration and localized lymphadenitis.

Chen said that April is the month when mosquitos and other
insects thrive, and that tomb sweepers should wear a pair of
light colored trousers and a jacket to guard against stings from
mosquitos and rove beetles, plus a hat to shield themselves from
direct exposure to the sun.
