ABUSE

The Ministry of the Interior (MOI) is planning to include village
and borough heads, their aides, as well as residential building
doormen as "notifiers" who can work to help police in cases of
child abuse, MOI officials said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Based on concerns that the number of child abuse cases has
continued to rise, the MOI plans to increase the number of people
who can help monitor and inform the police and other related
agencies of suspected cases, MOI officials said.

<P>
In addition to medical professionals, social workers and nursery
workers, who are "responsible" for notifying police and hospitals
upon the discovery of a case of child abuse, MOI officials said,
village and borough heads, their aides, as well as doormen of
residential buildings will probably be asked to become
"notifiers" since these particular groups of people usually have
closer contact with residents in the neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
MOI officials, however, discounted a United Daily News report
Wednesday that said that village or borough chiefs will be
subject to a "heavy penalty" should they fail to report a case of
child abuse in their areas.
</P>
<P>
MOI officials said that only "responsible" notifiers, namely
medical professionals, social workers, nursery workers and
police, are subject to fines -- ranging from NT$6,000 to
NT$30,000 -- if they are found to have been negligent in
reporting child abuse cases.
