PRESIDENT REAFFIRMS COMMITMENT TO U.S.
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  April 4 (CNA) 04/04/07  23:41:46 (By Sofia Wu)

<P>
President Chen Shui-bian reaffirmed his commitments to the United
States and the world Wednesday, saying he would never back away
from promises and guarantees made to the U.S. government and the
free world.
</P>
<P>
Chen made the remarks while meeting with a visiting U.S.
congressional delegation,  headed by Congressman Lincoln Davis
(D-Tenn.).
</P>
<P>
Noting that maintaining peace, stability and security in the
Taiwan Strait is his administration's inescapable duty and
mission, Chen said he has consistently honored his promise with
regard to this major policy goal.
</P>
<P>
Chen was referring to his now famous "five noes" pledge outlined
in his 2000 inaugural speech which states that so long as China
has no intention to use force against Taiwan, he will not declare
Taiwan's independence, not change Taiwan's national title or
national flag, not hold a referendum on the "independence vs.
unification" issue, not enshrine the special "state-to-state"
concept in the Constitution, and not abolish the National
Unification Council and the National Unification Guidelines.
</P>
<P>
The United States and the free world attach great importance to
Chen's "five noes" pledge because China has repeatedly threatened
to attack Taiwan should it seek formal independence.
</P>
<P>
During his talks with the visiting U.S. congressional delegation,
Chen assured them that Taiwan will spare no efforts to beef up
its military might for the sake of maintaining peace in the
Taiwan Strait and safeguarding its national security.
</P>
<P>
Chen also took the occasion to renew his call for the U.S.
government to sign a free trade agreement with Taiwan for mutual
benefits.
</P>
<P>
Noting that Taiwan is America's eighth largest trading partner,
Chen said he is convinced that if a Taiwan-U.S. free trade
agreement deal is struck,  the two countries would be able to
further strenghthen bilateral trade and economic cooperation
based on the current basis.
