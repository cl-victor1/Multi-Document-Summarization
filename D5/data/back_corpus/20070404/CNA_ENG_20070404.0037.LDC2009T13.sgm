THOUSANDS OF FISH DIE IN TAINAN CANAL AFTER VIOLENT STORM

Tainan, April 4 (CNA) 04/04/07  21:43:33 (By Han Nai-kuo)

<P>
Thousands of dead fish have surfaced in the Tainan Canal after a
violent storm swept across the southern Taiwan city two days ago
and washed a large volume of untreated sewage into the five-
kilometer-long canal.
</P>
<P>
Officials from the Environmental Protection Bureau of the Tainan
city government said Wednesday that they have scooped up three
metric tons of dead fish for sanitary disposal.
</P>
<P>
The officials said the heavy rains caused the untreated sewage to
overflow into the Tainan Canal, killing an estimated 10,000 fish,
including milkfish, large- scale mullet and Oreochomis.
</P>
<P>
They explained that the sewage depleted oxygen reserves in the
canal's water, making it impossible for the fish to survive.
</P>
<P>
The Tainan Canal was a major embarrassment for the city during
the 1990s due to the stench from sludge discharged by households
into the canal.
</P>
<P>
After the city government built a new sewage system along the 80
-year-old canal three years ago, fish gradually came back to the
canal, which has since become the waterway used for the annual
dragon boat race each June.
