SPECIAL FUNDS SYSTEM NEEDS TO BE OVERHAULED: VICE PRESIDENT
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

Taipei,  April 4 (CNA) 04/04/07  12:35:36 (By Deborah Kuo)

Vice President Annette Lu said Wednesday that the system of the
"special allowance funds" designated for public office holders'
discretionary use is intrinsically flawed and that the whole
system needs to be overhauled.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on former Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou's indictment for
allegedly embezzling NT$11.17 million (US$338,500) from a special
allowance fund designated for his discretionary use while serving
as Taipei mayor from 1998 to 2006, Lu said the "special allowance
funds" system is a decades-old practice that needs to be examined
and revised.
</P>
<P>
"It is controversial  as different  people  have used and
interpreted it differently," she said.
</P>
<P>
Lu said Ma is not the only former or sitting official to have
been affected by the defective special allowance fund system.
</P>
<P>
The vice president, however, offered no opinion on how the
"special allowance funds" system should be overhauled.
</P>
<P>
Ma appeared at a hearing on his corruption trial at the Taipei
District Court Tuesday, during which he said he had not intended
to embezzle public funds and expressed the hope that justice will
vindicate him.
</P>
<P>
Stressing that he had done nothing wrong, Ma said he had
considered that the half of the "special allowance fund" that
went directly into his bank accounts and for which only receipts
were required for reimbursement purposes were not public funds,
but instead of the nature of subsidies for local government heads
as is customary for more than 6,000 ranking officials around the
country.
</P>
<P>
Ma,  who had doubled as chairman  of the main opposition
Kuomintang, resigned from the KMT chairmanship Feb. 13 upon being
indicted for allegedly lining his pockets during his time as
Taipei mayor with a special allowance fund.
