CABINET WANTS ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENTS SIMPLIFIED
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  April  4 (CNA) 04/04/07  23:26:15 (By Y.C. Jou)

<P>
Rapid environmental impact assessment procedures should be drawn
up to allow urgent major construction programs to proceed
quickly, a Cabinet panel on economic development suggested
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Concerned by the progress of three major construction programs --
a steel plant invested in by the Taiwan Plastics Group and two
petrochemical plants of the CPC Corporation -- the inter-ministry
panel urged the Environment Protection Administration (EPA) to
"make an overall  review of current environmental impact
assessment regulations and practices, " said Council for Economic
Planning and Development Chairwomen Ho Mei-yueh, who is a member
of the panel headed by Vice Premier Tsai Ing-wen.
</P>
<P>
The panel asked the EPA to come up with a report within a month
for further discussion in the panel, Ho said, adding that the
report should address three concerns.
</P>
<P>
First, Ho said, the EPA should consider drawing up rapid
environmental impact assessment procedures for high priority
major programs "provided that environmental protection standards
are not compromised, " she said. Ho also stated, "Not all the
cases should be treated the same."
</P>
<P>
Second, according to the panel's recommendation, the range and
criteria of environmental impact assessments should be determined
by the environmental impact assessment committee at the outset
and should not be changed thereafter unless absolutely necessary.
</P>
<P>
Third, cases should be referred to the environmental impact
assessment committee for a decision if no conclusion is reached
through a certain number of case examination sessions, Ho said.
