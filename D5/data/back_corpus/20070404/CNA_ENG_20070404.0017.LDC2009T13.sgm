ITALY URGED TO GRANT VISA-FREE TREATMENT TO TAIWAN CITIZENS
</HEADLINE>

Taipei, April 4 (CNA) 04/04/07  15:09:09 (By Sofia Wu)
</P>
<P>
President Chen Shui-bian has urged Italy to grant visa-free
treatment to Taiwan citizens on a reciprocal basis.
</P>
<P>
Noting that Italy has been one of the world's most popular
tourist destinations, Chen said Taiwan citizens made a total of
215,000 visits to Italy last year.
</P>
<P>
Given the fact that Taiwan has long offered 30-day, visa-free
entry for Italian citizens, Chen said Italy should reciprocate
Taiwan's goodwill by offering similar treatment to Taiwan
citizens.
</P>
<P>
Chen made the remarks earlier this week while receiving an
Italian parliamentary delegation headed by Cesare Campa, deputy
head of a pro-Taiwan group in the Italian congress.
</P>
<P>
Expressing his gratitude for the delegation members' generous
support for Taiwan's cause both in the Italian parliament and the
international arena over the years, Chen said he is hopeful that
they can continue helping to push Italy to sign a cooperative
agreement with Taiwan on avoidance of double taxation and
prevention of tax evasion to facilitate mutual investment.
</P>
<P>
Chen said Taiwan has signed such agreements with several European
countries, including Britain, the Netherlands, Belgium, Denmark
and Sweden.
</P>
<P>
Despite the absence of diplomatic ties between Taiwan and Italy,
Chen said Italy approved Vice President Annette Lu's transit stop
in 2002 and a similar transit stop for him in March 2005 to
attend the late Pope John Paul II's funeral.
</P>
<P>
"We are grateful for the Italian government's hospitality, and it
is hoped that all of our senior officials will be able to gain
easy access to visit Italy or make transit stops there in the
future, " Chen said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Chen took the opportunity to praise the European Union
for its continued arms embargo against China. Eighteen years ago,
the E.U. imposed the arms ban after the infamous Tiananmen
Massacre, in which Chinese troops brutally crushed a pro-
democracy demonstration.
</P>
<P>
Although 18 years have passed, Chen said, China has made no
progress in its human rights record and has continued to suppress
political dissidents and human rights activists. In 2005, China
even passed a so-called Anti-Secession Law to create a legal
basis for the use of force against Taiwan if it perceives that
the island is moving toward independence.
</P>
<P>
Against this backdrop, Chen said he takes pleasure in seeing the
European Union rightfully maintain its arms embargo against
China.
