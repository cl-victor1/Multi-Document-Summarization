The Taiwan Forestry Research Institute under the Council of
Agriculture (COA) has successfully bred two endangered fern
species endemic to Taiwan, earning worldwide acclaim, institute
officials said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The institute made the announcement Tuesday after six years of
research  on the reproduction  of the two fern  species  --
Archangiopteris somai Hayata and Archangiopteris itoi Shieh.
</P>
<P>
The two species can be dated back 180 million years and are
endemic to Taiwan, the institute pointed out.
</P>
<P>
There are fewer than 1,000 Archangiopteris somai Hayata
remaining, while Archangiopteris itoi Shieh numbers less than
100, the institute stressed.
</P>
<P>
Archangiopteris somai Hayata is found in only two areas of Taiwan
-- Wulai, in the northern county of Taipei, and Lien-hua-chi
forest, in the central county of Nantou, officials said, adding
that Archangiopteris itoi Shieh can only be seen in Wulai area.
</P>
<P>
The institute published the results of their research last year
in Fern Gazette, published by the British Pteridological Society,
the officials said.
