'X PARTICLE' CONFIRMED AS HIGGS BOSONS
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  April  4 (CNA) 04/04/07  21:24:25 (By Zep Hu)
</P>
<P>
The "X particle" observed by a U.S. laboratory has been confirmed
by a trio of researchers from Taiwan and the United States as one
of the hypothetical Higgs bosons, academic sources reported
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
They emphasized that the finding may not only subvert the long-
exiting "standard model" in particle physics, but also make way
for the discovery of dark matters.
</P>
<P>
The results of the three -- He Xiao-gang of National Taiwan
University (NTU) , Jusak Tandean of University of La Verne, and
G. Valencia of Iowa State University -- have been published in
the renowned science journal Physical Review Letters in its Feb.
23 issue.
</P>
<P>
The X particle was first observed in 2005 at the Fermi National
Accelerator Laboratory (Fermilab) during a failed search for dark
matter. The unknown substance has puzzled physicists ever since
because none of the dominant theories is capable of accounting
for its characteristics.
</P>
<P>
After numerous calculations and comparisons, the trio asserted
that the particle fits all the constraints of a Higgs bosons
under the "next-to-minimal super- symmetric standard model."
</P>
<P>
The "standard model" of particle physics suggested in 1974 that
there should be a series of "elementary particles, " including
the boson hypothesized by Peter Higgs in 1964. However, to date,
although all other particles have been found, the Higgs boson was
yet to be discovered.
</P>
<P>
Later in the 1980's,  a new theory,  the "next-to-minimal super-
symmetric standard model" was introduced, with a new assumption
that there should seven kinds of Higgs boson particles, and every
elementary  particle  should  have  a unique  counterpart,  a
super-symmetric particle.
</P>
<P>
Since  then,  neither  the  seven  Higgs  bosons  nor the super-
symmetric particles have been observed.
</P>
<P>
He, of NTU, noted that even though they didn't find "the"
standard model Higgs boson, they found "something of even greater
significance," which means that by confirming particle X to be
one of the seven Higgs bosons they cannot only assert the
existence of other Higgs bosons, but also expand the theoretical
foundations of particle physics from the standard model to the
next-to-minimal super-symmetric standard model.
</P>
<P>
He added that by sustaining the next-to-minimal super-symmetric
standard model with their findings, the research on dark matter
would enter a new stage -- because the theory also assumed that
the dark matter should be formed by super- symmetric particles.
</P>
<P>
"If the Higgs bosons exist, the super-symmetric particles may
also exist," he predicted.
</P>
<P>
He said that the physicists require still more physical evidence
to sustain the theory and that the Large Hadron Collider (LHC)
project coming online in November, and the International Linear
Collider (ILC) still in the planning stages, could reveal further
evidence pointing to the existence of other unknown particles.
