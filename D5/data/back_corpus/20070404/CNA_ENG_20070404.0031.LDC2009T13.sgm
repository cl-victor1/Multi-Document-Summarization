A total of 324,347 main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) members are
eligible to vote to select a chairman in the April 7 by-election,
KMT officials said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
According  to Huang  Chung-hsien,  director  of the  KMT's
organization and development department, the party will set up
486 polling stations across the country, with the largest in
northern Taipei County capable of accommodating 5,057 voters,
and the smallest, on outlying Wuchiu Island, braced to receive 15
voters.
</P>
<P>
Huang said that the KMT is opening many polling stations in hopes
of attracting at least of 40 percent of eligible party members to
cast their ballots in the race, in which former acting Chairman
Wu Poh-hsiung and lawmaker Hung Hsiu-chu are vying for the
party's top post.
</P>
<P>
The largest number of KMT party members eligible to vote are
found in Taipei County, which has 44,552, followed by 30,422 in
neighboring Taoyuan County. Offshore Lienchiang County, where the
Matsu Islands are located, has the fewest eligible KMT members,
with just 1,012.
</P>
<P>
Former KMT Chairman Ma Ying-jeou voluntarily stepped down from
the post Feb. 13 after being indicted by Taipei prosecutors
earlier that same day for his alleged mishandling of funds from a
special municipal monthly allowance designated for his
discretionary use when serving as mayor of Taipei from 1998-2006.
</P>
<P>
Ma proclaimed his desire to take part in the 2008 presidential
election immediately after the corruption charges were filed
against him.
</P>
<P>
The first day of Ma's embezzlement trial was opened Tuesday at
the Taipei District Court, during which the former KMT chairman
maintained his innocence.
