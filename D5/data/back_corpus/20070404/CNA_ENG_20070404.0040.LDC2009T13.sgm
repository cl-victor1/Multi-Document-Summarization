TVBS ADVERTISERS URGED TO SUSPEND COMMERCIALS FOR ONE WEEK

Taipei,  April  4 (CNA) 04/04/07  21:46:53 (By T.C. Jiang)

Advertisers on TVBS, a local cable TV station, are urged to
suspend their commercials for one week to give the public an
opportunity to reflect on TVBS' broadcast of a staged video,
according to a statement issued by the Taiwan Advertisers'
Association.
</P>
<P>
The association called on advertisers Wednesday to put on hold
their TV commercials slated to be aired between April 20-26 or
transfer the commercials to other media, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
Advertisers in Taiwan should not use viewership or readership
rates as the only gauge to decide upon the placement of their
advertisements, the association pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Doing so has forced local media to create sensational news
stories and attempt to scoop media rivals in order to boost their
viewership or readership rates, the association explained.
</P>
<P>
Companies should also take into account social responsibility as
they market their products, the association stated.
</P>
<P>
Noting that satellite and cable TV channels are scarce resources
that belong to all the people in Taiwan, the association said
that inappropriate uses of the channels are harmful to the public
interest.
</P>
<P>
It is inappropriate for TVBS to allow itself to be used by a
gangster to issue death threats to his mob boss, the association
said.
</P>
<P>
With this incident, the station has violated the principles of
news reporting, misled the public, and caused social unrest, the
association said, adding that TVBS should be harshly condemned.
