<P>
The Fair Trade Commission (FTC) confirmed Thursday that prices of
consumer products have surged since 2006, attributing the
fluctuation to raw material price hikes in the international
market.
</P>
<P>
Acting on reports that the prices of many household products such
as instant noodles, cooking oil, detergent, soft drinks and
canned foods were higher in May compared with the previous month,
the FTC began an inquiry into the price disturbance at local
hypermarkets a few days ago, FTC officials said.
</P>
<P>
Their inspectors found no signs of price increases, but said
hypermarket operators face pressure from suppliers to raise
prices.
</P>
<P>
There have been negotiations between sellers and suppliers on the
issue,  the officials said, noting that hypermarket operators,
including Carrefour and RT- Mart Corp., have promised that they
will not increase prices without careful consideration.
</P>
<P>
The FTC officials warned that they will crack down on any illegal
price ramping or collaborated monopolization.
