COSTA RICA SHOULD APOLOGIZE OVER WHO SNAFU: LEGISLATOR
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taipei,  May 17 (CNA) 05/17/07  18:58:28 (By Y.F. Low)

<P>
An opposition lawmaker urged the government Thursday to demand an
apology from Costa Rica -- one of Taiwan's diplomatic allies --
for opposing the country's bid for membership of the World Health
Organization (WHO).
</P>
<P>
Raising the issue during a meeting of the Legislative Yuan's
Foreign and Overseas Compatriot Affairs Committee, Kuomintang
(KMT) Legislator Lee Chi-chu said it seems Taiwan has been
spending money on Costa Rica just to get a "slap in the face"
because Costa Rica's move was tantamount to humiliating Taiwan
openly.
</P>
<P>
Lee said the incident could trigger a domino effect among the
country's diplomatic allies unless the government deals with the
matter seriously, such as demanding that Costa Rica punish the
responsible officials and offer an open apology.
</P>
<P>
Ruling Democratic Progressive Party Legislator Hsiao Bi-khim
urged the government to look into the true positions of those
allies who did not offer their support for Taiwan during this
year's World Health Assembly (WHA) annual conference.
</P>
<P>
The WHA, the decision-making arm of the WHO, adopted Monday a
motion by a vote of 148-17 with two abstnetions to strike the
issue of Taiwan's membership off the agenda of the annual meeting
scheduled for May 14-23 in Geneva.
</P>
<P>
Costa Rica was the only Taiwan ally to vote in favor of the
motion, while six others were either absent from the session,
abstained or had no voting rights.
</P>
<P>
According to Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) officials, Costa
Rica could have "cast the wrong vote."
</P>
<P>
Also during the committee meeting, Vice Minister of Foreign
Affairs Xavier Ching-shan Hou admitted that the result of the
vote was unsatisfactory, given the fact that only 17 out of
Taiwan's 24 allies with WHO membership backed up Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Hou said the outcome indicates that there is room for improvement
in the country's diplomatic efforts.
</P>
<P>
Also Thursday, Chen Hsin-tung, deputy director-general of the
MOFA's Department of Central and South American Affairs, told
reporters that the ministry was surprised at Costa Rica's move
because the Central American nation has been a firm supporter of
Taiwan and had promised to throw its weight behind the country
during the WHA meeting.
</P>
<P>
Chen said the ministry is investigating if a recent personnel
change at the Geneva office of Costa Rica's permanent mission to
the United Nations was related to the error.
