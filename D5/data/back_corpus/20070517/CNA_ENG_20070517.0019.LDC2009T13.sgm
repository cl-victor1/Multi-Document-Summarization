Kaohsiung Mayor Chen Chu, who was hospitalized last month
following a mild stroke, is recovering well but might have to
remain in the hospital for between two and four more weeks,
doctors at Kaohsiung Medical University Hospital said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Chen, who has a history of high blood pressure, has been
hospitalized since April 26 and her blood sugar and blood
pressure have returned to normal, the doctors said.
</P>
<P>
Chen is undergoing physiotherapy and can also use a Chinese
calligraphy brush, sign documents and meet with her staff, they
said.
</P>
<P>
Her physical fitness and endurance are not yet up to her heavy
workload as mayor, the doctors said, adding that Chen lost two
kilograms during her hospitalization due to exercise and diet,
but should lose another five kilograms to achieve her ideal
weight.
