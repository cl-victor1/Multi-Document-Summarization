An epidemic prevention seminar between Taiwan-held Kinmen Island
and Xiamen Port in China's Fujian Province will be held May 21 on
Kinmen in an effort to wipe out the spread of contagious diseases
between the two sides, Kinmen county officials said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
According to the officials, the seminar is aimed at strengthening
the existing joint disease prevention mechanisms between the two
sides -- part of the so- called "mini three links" that have
allowed for direct shipping and trade services between Taiwan's
Kinmen and Matsu islands and the Fujian ports of Xiamen and Mawei
since January 2001, with Fujian's port of Quanzhou also included
in the program recently.
</P>
<P>
More than 30 officials from the Kinmen health and disease control
authorities, as well as local Red-Cross officials and 15 Xiamen
officials will take part in the symposium -- the first of its
kind since the inception of the "mini three links."
</P>
<P>
The discussions will focus on sharpening complementary measures
to step up bilateral cooperation and mechanisms to deal with
medical treatment contingencies and public health issues in the
region, Kinmen County officials said.
</P>
<P>
The Xiamen officials will leave for Kinmen May 20 via the "mini
links" and are slated to stay until May 22. In addition to
participating in the seminar, they will also visit tourist spots
and medical facilities on the island.
