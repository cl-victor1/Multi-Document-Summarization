ENVOY TO U.S. NOT UPSET OVER WHO BID SETBACK
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Washington,  May 17 (CNA) 05/17/07  19:31:16 (By Jorge Liu and
Flor Wang)

Taiwan's representative to the United States, Joseph Wu, said
Wednesday that he was not upset even though he did not succeed in
persuading the United States to back Taiwan's bid to join the
World Health Organization (WHO) as a full member.
</P>
<P>
Speaking in an exclusive interview with the CNA, Wu said that he
did not feel frustrated, despite the fact that he failed to push
the United States to support Taiwan's WHO membership -- his first
important task since he assumed the post in April.
</P>
<P>
Member states of the World Health Assembly (WHA)  -- the
decision-making arm of the WHO -- decided not to discuss a
proposal on Taiwan's membership application by a vote of 148-17
during the Monday session of its week-long annual conference in
Geneva.
</P>
<P>
It was the first time that the country has sought full WHO
membership, instead of WHA observer status, in the name of
"Taiwan."
</P>
<P>
"I did not feel upset because I also gained a lot in the
negotiation process with the U.S. side, and that in turn has
turned into a driving force to push me forward and has helped me
examine the direction my efforts should take," Wu said.
</P>
<P>
"After conducting negotiations with the United States, I also
found that we have obtained substantial progress in many fields
that the rest of the world and the media do not know of," he
said.
</P>
<P>
"Although it is impossible to open bilateral talks on signing a
Taiwan -U.S. free trade accord at present, we discovered that the
United States is paying increasingly greater heed to the Trade
and Investment Framework Agreement between the two countries, "
he said, voicing his belief that "Taiwan-U. S. relations could be
upgraded on future cooperative issues."
