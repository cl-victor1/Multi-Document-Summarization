Former Premier Frank Hsieh, who is set to be nominated by the
ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) to represent the party
in the 2008 presidential election, is scheduled to pay a visit to
the United States in late June, diplomatic sources in Washington,
D.C. said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Hsieh is scheduled to arrive in Los Angeles June 25 for a one-day
stay before heading to Washington, D.C. June 26 for a four-day
visit on his planned trip which is reportedly being arranged by
the Washington-based Formosan Association of Public Affairs,
which groups Taiwanese-Americans to promote Taiwan cause,
according to the sources.
</P>
<P>
During his visit in Washington, Hsieh, who won the DPP's
presidential primary vote earlier this month by beating
contenders Vice President Annette Lu, Premier Su Tseng-chang and
DPP Chairman Yu Shyi-kun, is expected to meet U.S. officials and
members of the U.S. Congress and several think tanks to give them
a better understanding of his stances on major issues,
particularly cross-Taiwan Strait relations,  as well his ideals
regarding running the country, according to the sources.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Congress will host a welcome party in honor of Hsieh
during his visit. Hsieh is expected to deliver a speech at a
think tank, although the details of his itinerary in Washington
have yet to be finalized, the sources said.

<P>
Responding to questions from CNA reporters in an exclusive
interview Wednesday, Taiwan's top representative in the United
States Joseph Wu said his office will extend every possible
assistance to Hsieh during the forthcoming visit in Washington if
Hsieh asks for help and if his office receives instructions by
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in this regard.
</P>
<P>
Wu denied a media report Wednesday saying that members of the
Bush administration had asked his office to provide detailed
personal information about Hsieh regarding the forthcoming visit.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Wu said he has no idea whether opposition Kuomintang
presidential candidate Ma Ying-jeou will visit the United States
in the near future, but he added that his office will render a
helping hand to Ma unconditionally should he request it.
</P>
<P>
Hsieh, who served as premier between 2005-2006, attended a public
affairs study program at Harvard University last year after
leaving office. He also visited Washington, D.C. early this year
mainly to attend the annual U.S. National Prayer Breakfast held
Jan.31-Feb. 1 as the envoy of President Chen Shui-bian.
