DPP LAWMAKERS SUE KMT EX-POLITICAL APPOINTEES OVER SPECIAL FUNDS
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  May 17 (CNA) 05/17/07  23:22:16 (By Flor Wang)
</P>
<P>
A group of ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) lawmakers
filed a suit Thursday against 97 former Kuomintang (KMT)
political appointees on corruption charges over "special
executive allowances" they received when they held public office.
</P>
<P>
The group of lawmakers, led by DPP legislative caucus whip Ker
Chien-ming, filed the lawsuit with the Supreme Prosecutor Office,
where they also met State Public Prosecutor-General Chen Tsung-
ming, to seek an investigation into those former officials'
alleged embezzlement of public funds.
</P>
<P>
The DPP lawmakers sued 97 former political appointees, including
former KMT Chairman Ma Ying-jeou, who is also a former justice
minister, ex-premiers Hau Pei-tsun, Lien Chan and Vincent Siew,
as well as former ministers and government agency chiefs. They
are all members of the main opposition KMT, which lost power to
the DPP in 2000.
</P>
<P>
They urged the prosecution to start a probe into their suit as
soon as possible and argued that Ma, who has been nominated by
the KMT to run for the next presidency, must have his integrity
examined according to the highest moral standards instead of
allowing KMT lawmakers to "have their own way."
</P>
<P>
The DPP lawmakers' move came after a group of KMT legislators
filed suit earlier this month against 102 DPP political
appointees for the same reason -- which the ruling party called a
scheme to bail out Ma, who has been dogged by embezzlement
charges over his alleged mishandling of funds from a special
municipal monthly allowance designated for his discretionary use
during his two terms as mayor of Taipei from 1998-2006.
</P>
<P>
KMT lawmakers have threatened to sue a total of 6,500 local
government chiefs and state company executives if prosecutors do
not quickly begin investigating the 102 former and incumbent
political appointees of the ruling party, including Vice
President Annette Lu, former Premier Frank Hsieh and DPP Chairman
Yu Shyi- kun.
</P>
<P>
Ma was indicted 195 days after a suit was lodged by DPP lawmakers
against him, but to date, not one of the 102 accused DPP
officials have been questioned by prosecutors. KMT lawmakers have
repeatedly complained and accused the ruling party of using the
suit as a way to squeeze Ma out of the coming presidential
election.
</P>
<P>
The "special allowance funds" has become a controversial issue
after Ma was indicted in mid-February by Taipei prosecutors on
embezzlement charges, prompting him to step down from the KMT's
top post and to officially announce his presidential bid.
</P>
<P>
The Taipei District Court has opened three hearings on Ma's case
since April, in which Ma has maintained his innocence and
defended himself.
</P>
<P>
Ma has long enjoyed strong public support for his "clean image"
and is viewed as the opposition's No. 1 challenger to the ruling
DPP in the 2008 presidential race.
</P>
<P>
While Ma has been nominated  to run,  Hsieh won the DPP
presidential primary in a vote by party members early this month.
The two are supposedly to compete in the next presidential race
if no legal barriers stand in their way.
