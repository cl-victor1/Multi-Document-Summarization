Taiwan citizens intending to visit the Thai capital of Bangkok in
the coming few days are advised to be alert to their personal
safety because of the possibility of political turbulence there,
Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) spokesman Wang Chien-yeh said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a regular MOFA news conference, Wang said supporters
of the Thai Rak Thai (TRT) party -- the political party founded
by ousted Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra -- might take to the
streets in Bangkok after Thailand's nine-member Constitutional
Tribunal ordered the dissolution of the party the day before.
</P>
<P>
Quoting the latest report from Taiwan's representative office in
Bangkok, Wang said that the situation in the Thai capital has so
far remained "business as usual" and that the Thai government has
mobilized 10,000 military and police personnel to prevent any
possible violent protests.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Wang said the MOFA still has to remind Bangkok-bond
travelers to keep vigilant about their personal safety and avoid
places where protesters may converge.
</P>
<P>
Wang also advised Taiwan citizens to refrain from traveling to
the Songkhla and Hat Yai areas in southern Thailand for the time
being following a series of explosions there May 27-28 which left
four dead and 36 others injured.
</P>
<P>
Thailand-bound  travelers  are also advised to contact the
country's representative  office in Thailand via the hot line
002-6681-666-4006 if they need any emergency assistance.
