Education Minister Tu Cheng-sheng visited an outdoor shooting
range run by the Penghu Defense Command (PDC) in the offshore
county of Penghu Thursday to witness first-hand progress in a
recently launched firearms training program for high school
students nationwide.
</P>
<P>
During the visit, Tu watched high school students practice their
shooting skills using made-in-Taiwan Guarder T65K2 Airsoft
rifles, as part of a two-day firearms training course in which
some 1,000 students from two high schools in Penghu are taking
part.

<P>
Addressing the start of the training course, Tu said the Ministry
of Education has allocated NT$9 million (US$272,727) this year
for the resumption of firearms training courses for high school
students around the country, after a hiatus of 11 years, as part
of efforts "to bolster citizens' national defense education."
</P>
<P>
Tu expressed his appreciation to the Ministry of National Defense
for providing assistance to the Education Ministry in operating
the training courses.
</P>
<P>
During the firearms training course on Penghu, the high school
students taking part seemed thrilled at having the opportunity to
fire "real rifles and real bullets, " with a majority of them
saying they had never done so before.
