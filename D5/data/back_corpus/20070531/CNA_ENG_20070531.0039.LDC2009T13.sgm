Four convenience store chains signed an agreement Thursday
pledging that their stores in Kaohsiung County will protect the
younger generation by not selling tobacco to minors and not
luring them in any way to become smokers.
</P>
<P>
In observance of the May 31 World No Tobacco Day, the store
chains -- 7-Eleven, FamilyMart, Hi-Life and OK -- signed the pact
at the Health Bureau of the Kaohsiung county government, with
Magistrate Yang Chiu-hsing and senior officials witnessing.
</P>
<P>
The stores promised  that they will refrain  from selling
cigarettes to children under 18 years of age and will verify the
age of a buyer when in doubt.
</P>
<P>
They also agreed not to use advertisements or other means to
create the wrong impression among the younger generation that
smoking is good thing to do, and neither will they distribute
free packs of cigarettes to lure youngsters to become addicted to
nicotine.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the ceremony to mark the signing of the agreement,
Yang pointed out that 20 percent of the high school students and
9 percent of the junior high school students in Kaohsiung County
are smokers.
</P>
<P>
He said the county government will try to persuade these
youngsters to quit smoking while continuing to push other
measures, including making all restaurants in Kaohsiung County
smoke-free.
</P>
<P>
World No Tobacco Day is sponsored annually by the World Health
Organization (WHO) to call attention to the global health burden
resulting from tobacco use and to encourage governments to work
towards stricter regulation of tobacco products.
</P>
<P>
This year's observance focuses on secondhand smoke and highlights
the progress that has been achieved around the world in
protecting nonsmokers by making workplaces and public spaces
smoke-free.
</P>
<P>
According to the WHO, tobacco is the second major cause of death
in the world. About 650 million people alive today will
eventually die from tobacco-related diseases, including hundreds
of thousands of non-smokers who die each year from diseases
caused by breathing second-hand tobacco smoke.
