The young director of the Stone Theater -- a troupe based in
Taichung, central Taiwan -- died Thursday of head injuries he
suffered in an accidental fall from the ceiling of a theater June
25.
</P>
<P>
Cheng Jen-po, 25, is survived by his parents. The young director
was trying to adjust the lights in the Puli Arts and Cultural
Center before a performance when he fell head-first to the
ground.
</P>
<P>
Doctors at the Puli Christian operated on him twice but were
unable to save him.
</P>
<P>
Cheng graduated from National Tsing Hua University in Hsinchu
with a major in information engineering in 2005, but found that
he loved playwriting and directing more than information science
after taking a course in drama in 2004.
</P>
<P>
In 2005, he joined the Stone Theater, which aims to combine
theater with everyday life and foster the growth of theater in
the community.
</P>
<P>
The stage play titled Witch Ulala's Crystal Ball, which he wrote
and directed for children, proved so successful in 2005 and 2006
that the Cabinet-level Council for Cultural Affairs awarded him a
grant to give 10 extra performances around Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
The performance in Nantou was the first of these shows.
</P>
<P>
Cheng's parents told reporters that they will watch the June 2
show in Hsinchu County's Chutung township and attend a memorial
afterwards.
