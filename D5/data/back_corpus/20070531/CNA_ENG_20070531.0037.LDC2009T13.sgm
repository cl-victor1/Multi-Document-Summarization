AMCHAM URGES TAIWAN TO 'JUST DO IT' ON DIRECT CROSS-STRAIT AIR
LINKS
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  May 31 (CNA) 05/31/07  20:44:46 (By Deborah Kuo)
</P>
<P>
The American Chamber of Commerce in Taipei (AmCham) urged Taiwan
Thursday to improve cross-Taiwan Strait flow of people, goods and
services as well as investment as a "corrective action" that
could give Taiwan's economy a significant boost.
</P>
<P>
Regarding direct cross-strait transport links, an AmCham Taiwan
White Paper for 2007 says: "There is nothing more to be said --
just do it!"
</P>
<P>
Describing the 2007 AmCham Taiwan White Paper as a record of a
"health checkup for the Taiwan tiger, " AmCham President Jane
Hwang said in a press conference that AmCham concerned that
Taiwan appears to be falling behind the other "aging" Asian
tigers -- Hong Kong, Singapore and South Korea -- in economic
competitiveness, while other "new" Asian tigers, including China,
India and Vietnam, are rapidly gaining strength.
</P>
<P>
Huang said Hong Kong, Singapore and South Korea are demonstrating
that as mature economies they can still attract investment
interest by building world-class infrastructure, cultivating
human resources, upgrading regulatory regimes and reforming tax
policies.
</P>
<P>
Hong  Kong  and Singapore  have  become  models  of truly
internationalized societies, and following the 1997 Asian
financial crisis, South Korea has vigorously pursued a range of
reforms that helped it surpass Taiwan in per capita GDP in 2002
so that it now ranks as the world's ninth-largest economy, she
added.
</P>
<P>
Huang said that Taiwan still has many key assets, including its
strength in high-tech manufacturing, that could enable it to
continue to be a dynamic player, but the country's future success
will depend on "whether the political and popular will is present
to tackle some underlying systematic problems."
</P>
<P>
The AmCham White Paper emphasizes four areas in which corrective
action could give the Taiwan economy a significant boost:
</P>
<P>
-- Ending the debilitating political wrangling that has pushed
important economic issues from the public agenda.
</P>
<P>
--  Resolving a regulatory morass that includes inadequate
transparency, violation of due process, legislator interference
on behalf of private interests, insufficient consultation with
industry players,  inconsistent interpretations  and
enforcement,  and regulations inconsistent with international
best practices.
</P>
<P>
-- Improving cross-strait flows of people, goods and services, as
well as investment.
</P>
<P>
-- Expanding and re-energizing the trade relationship with the
United States, for example through cooperation in service-sector
development, swift progress in TIFA (Trade and Investment
Framework Agreement) negotiations, and conclusion of a bilateral
Government Procurement Agreement.
</P>
<P>
Hwang noted that AmCham has also changed a long-standing section
of "Recommendations to the Taiwan Government" into "Appeals to
the People of Taiwan" on the grounds that the people of Taiwan
have a number of serious concerns about issues with which AmCham
agrees.
</P>
<P>
"We join our voices with the Taiwan people in urging the
government to take decisive action on eight important issues that
we believe will significantly improve Taiwan's  quality of life,
democratic growth and international competitiveness," Hwang
noted.
</P>
<P>
The eight issues are:
</P>
<P>
-- Protect Taiwan's people from public-health criminals by
cracking down hard on counterfeit medicines and pesticides that
put public health at risk.
</P>
<P>
-- Give people international employment opportunities at home by
ending a protectionist mindset that discourages foreign
investment and therefore job creation.
</P>
<P>
-- Build good Intellectual Property Right habits among Taiwan's
youth through proper enforcement policies on illegal Internet
downloads and textbook copying.
</P>
<P>
-- Keep families together at a time when nearly 5 percent of the
population lives in China, by permitting regular direct flights
across the Taiwan Strait.
</P>
<P>
-- Give Taiwan world-class water and power systems to support
high-tech industry and bolster the quality of life for Taiwan
residents.
</P>
<P>
-- Upgrade regulatory efficiency and effectiveness to help spur
economic performance.
</P>
<P>
-- Insist on legislative transparency to reduce corruption and
hold elected representatives accountable for illegal or unethical
behavior.
</P>
<P>
-- Embrace a multiparty system of democracy built on flexibility
and compromise so as to safeguard Taiwan's long-term political
and economic health.
