PRESIDENT URGES CHINA TO ADOPT DEMOCRACY
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  May  31  (CNA) 05/31/07  14:14:06 (By Y.F. Low)

President Chen Shui-bian urged China Thursday to establish a
constitutional democracy to transform itself from an aggressor to
a peacemaker to contribute to the well-being of the people in
China, Taiwan and around the world.
</P>
<P>
Chen made the remarks in the latest issue of his online
newsletter, ahead of the 18th anniversary of the 1989 Tiananmen
Square massacre in Beijing in which thousands of pro-democracy
demonstrators were killed by People's Liberation Army troops.
</P>
<P>
"Over the past 18 years, tremendous changes have taken place in
China, but the only thing that has remained unchanged is China's
totalitarianism  and its relentless suppression of freedom and
democracy," Chen said.
</P>
<P>
However, many people have been reluctant to face up to the truth
of the lack of democracy, freedom and human rights in China,
using China's economic development as an excuse, Chen said.
</P>
<P>
The president noted that two years before the Tiananmen Square
massacre,  Taiwan lifted martial law and officially  renounced
authoritarianism, which blazed a democratic trail for ethnic
Chinese communities around the world.
</P>
<P>
As Taiwan is learning and exploring  ways to improve its
democratic system, there are differences within the nation over
the democratization effort, with some people questioning whether
Taiwan has paid too much attention to democratization and
neglected economic growth, Chen pointed out.
</P>
<P>
"As a matter of fact, democracy is not only a political system,
it is also a lifestyle and value covering all aspects including
politics, society, economy and spiritual life, which means that
democracy and the economy cannot be separated from each other or
made opposites," Chen said.
</P>
<P>
He said history has proven that a strong and prosperous country
that is undemocratic is often the "most dangerous and aggressive"
kind, pointing to the examples of Japan and Germany before World
War II and the Soviet Union after World War II.
</P>
<P>
This shows that the combination of rapid economic growth and
dictatorship always give rise to militarism, acts of aggression
and the pursuit of hegemony, Chen said.
</P>
<P>
"A country ruled by dictatorship, without monitoring by the
people and parliament, tends to resort to war to divert public
attention to demestic conflicts," he said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that since the Tiananmen Square massacre, China's
military spending has registered double-digit growth every year,
a rate that is faster than its economic growth and far beyond its
needs for self-defense.
</P>
<P>
He warned that China's effort to advance from a regional power to
a global military superpower will have profound impact on China
and the whole world.
