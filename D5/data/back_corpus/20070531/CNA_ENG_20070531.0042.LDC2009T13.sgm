Yen Chiu-lai, vice minister of the Cabinet-level Central
Personnel Administration (CPA) is visiting Costa Rica as part of
efforts to increase mutual understanding and cooperation between
Taiwan and the Central American nation.
</P>
<P>
Attending a conference on international personnel systems
Wednesday, Yen explained in his opening remarks the structure of
the Taiwan government and its personnel system.
</P>
<P>
Also present at the opening ceremony were Costa Rica Vice
President Kevin Casas and many other senior government officials.
</P>
<P>
Yen said the government in Taiwan has five branches -- the
Executive Yuan, the Judicial Yuan, the Legislative Yuan, the
Control Yuan and the Examination Yuan.
</P>
<P>
The CPA is one of the 37 subordinate agencies of the Executive
Yuan, he continued.
</P>
<P>
The administration is in charge of employment, promotion,
emolument, performance rating, service, training and further
education of civil servants, Yen noted.
</P>
<P>
Applicants must pass official exams before serving as civil
servants, he added.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the sound personnel system is the cornerstone to the
stable operation of the government, Yen said he hopes the
exchanges with Costa Rican civil servants will help enhance the
diplomatic ties between the two countries.
