KMT LEGISLATIVE SPEAKER REFUSES TO BE RUNNING MATE
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taipei,   May  31  (CNA) 05/31/07  19:55:36 (By Flor Wang)
</P>
<P>
Ma Yin-jeou,  the main  opposition Kuomintang's (KMT's) candidate
for the 2008 presidential election, said Thursday that he will
immediately begin seeking a running mate after Legislative Yuan
Speaker Wang Jin-pyng turned down his offer to team up on a
ticket.
</P>
<P>
Ma made the remarks shortly after a 90-minute meeting with Wang
earlier in the day to discuss the issue. Wang rejected Ma's offer
to team up with him and gave Ma his best wishes.
</P>
<P>
Stating that he will quickly start looking for a complementary
partner to act as his running mate to secure a KMT victory in the
presidential race, Ma said that he will announce his choice
before the June 24 party congress so as to allow KMT delegates to
vote on the ticket.
</P>
<P>
Although Ma said that he fully respects Wang's decision to
continue serving in the legislature, he added that bilateral
unity and cooperation is still indispensable in December's
legislative elections and the 2008 presidential poll.
</P>
<P>
Wang also gave his assurance that he will cooperate with Ma to
serve that end despite his refusal to run with him.
</P>
<P>
The development is a result of Ma's reluctance to accept KMT
Honorary Chairman Lien Chan's proposal that they put off the
announcement of their final decision for two weeks, Wang said.
</P>
<P>
According to Wang, it was agreed Wednesday between Lien and him
that he and Ma first try to "forge cooperation" before deciding
to pair up on a presidential ticket at a later date.
</P>
<P>
But Ma insisted on coming up with a final decision by late May on
the grounds that party delegates  are to vote on the KMT's
presidential ticket in the June 24 national congress, pushing the
planned Ma-Wang ticket to break up, Wang said.
</P>
<P>
Against this backdrop, Wang said that he decided not to agree to
a presidential ticket with Ma and to continue serving in the
Legislative Yuan. "Doing so will satisfy both sides in terms of
political stability and the people's interests," he added.
</P>
<P>
He was also reluctant to answer the question of whether he is
willing to serve as general manager of Ma's presidential
campaign.
</P>
<P>
Sources close to Wang said that it is an issue requiring mutual
trust and urged the KMT party central to refrain from using the
media as a tool to influence the public so as to avoid upsetting
party unity and undermining two-way understanding.
