EXECUTIVE YUAN LAMBASTED OVER LOSHEN SANATORIUM
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  May 31 (CNA) 05/31/07  21:00:09 (By Elizabeth Hsu)

Lawmakers, preservationists and patients at the Losheng
Sanatorium in Taipei County blasted the Executive Yuan Thursday
for "breaking its promise" on the long-disputed issue of whether
or not to keep the old leprosarium from demolition.
</P>
<P>
Legislators Lai Shin-yuan of the opposition Taiwan Solidarity
Union and Joanna C. Lei of the opposition Kuomintang held a press
conference  with members  of the Losheng  patients'  self-help
organization and an alliance of preservationist to protest
against the final decision made by the Public Construction
Commission (PCC) under the Executive Yuan the previous day to
only preserve 39 buildings in the 70-year-old leprosarium
compound.
</P>
<P>
Lai claimed that under the PCC decision to "preserve 39 buildings
while relocating the other 10, " only 50 percent of the 4-hectare
compound will be preserved. The resolution completely violates
the promise former Premier Su Tseng-chang made during his term in
office.
</P>
<P>
During his meeting with Losheng patients and preservationists in
mid-April, Su promised that the government "would do its utmost"
to promote the adoption of a project option that would retain 90
percent of the existing compound, located in the way of an under-
construction metro line in Hsinchuang, while still avoiding a
delay to the opening of the line.
</P>
<P>
Lai claimed that Su's promise was a lie and demanded that new
Premier Chang Chun-hsiung make clear whether or not Su's promise
will be kept.
</P>
<P>
The controversial leprosarium was built in 1930 by Japanese
colonizers to segregate and treat patients with Hansen's disease.
The Kuomintang regime in its early years in Taiwan inherited the
policy but in later years, patients were allowed to leave the
sanitarium. Many, however, having lived in chronic isolation and
facing discrimination, had little choice but to stay and have
long since grown accustomed to their home.
</P>
<P>
Several dozen elderly patients still live in the compound and are
resisting the government's plan to relocate them to a nearby
high-rise hospital.
</P>
<P>
Preservationists have been advocating the patients' right to stay
and say that as the only leper colony in Taiwan, the institution
provides living testimony to past indignities endured by the
patients and is thus of great historical and cultural value.
