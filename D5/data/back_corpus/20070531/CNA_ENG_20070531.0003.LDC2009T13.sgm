MAC BLAMES BEIJING'S `OBSTINATE MINDSET' FOR ALIENATING TAIWAN

Taipei,  May 30 (CNA) 05/31/07  10:02:15 (By Flor Wang)

In response to Beijing's criticism of the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party's decision to draft a resolution on making
Taiwan a normal country, the Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) said
Wednesday that it is Beijing's "obstinate" mindset that has
pushed the Taiwan people away from China.
</P>
<P>
The MAC made the comments in a statement after China's Central
Office for Taiwan Affairs under the State Council attacked the
DPP's "normal country" draft as "a risky monologue heralding
Taiwan independence" earlier that same day.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan is an independent sovereign state whose fate should be
determined by its people and this is the consensus among the
Taiwan people at the present stage, the MAC said, adding that
positive and mutually beneficial cross-Taiwan Strait relations
must be built upon that consensus.
</P>
<P>
The Beijing regime has always turned a blind eye to the reality
of separate rule on Taiwan and in China and totally disregards
Taiwan's strong desire for democracy, the MAC said, adding that
Beijing's  obstinacy is the prime reason behind the increased
alienation between the people on the two sides.
</P>
<P>
The MAC urged Beijing to remove politically charged barriers in
bilateral negotiations  and to respond positively  to Taiwan's
overtures as soon as possible on issues of mutual concern, such
as allowing Chinese tourists to visit Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Despite Beijing's verbal attacks, DPP Secretary-General Lin Chia-
lung said the party's drafting of a resolution aimed at making
Taiwan a normal country will not be hobbled.
</P>
<P>
"In turn, the party will launch a campaign with all-out efforts
to promote the concept among the public, " he said, adding that
"Beijing's attempts to disrupt the DPP's task has underscored the
significance that the resolution carries for the country in
seeking to solidify its democratization."
</P>
<P>
Lai I-chung, director of the DPP's China Affairs Department,
accused Beijing of lacking "class" over its opposition to the
normal country resolution.
</P>
<P>
Lai issued a condemnation of Beijing, describing it as being
"deliberately provocative" by making the attacks.
</P>
<P>
A DPP ad hoc group in charge of the drafting held its first
meeting earlier that day and is slated to wrap up the task in
late July before party delegates vote on it in the party congress
scheduled for August.
</P>
<P>
DPP Chairman Yu Shyi-kun first mentioned the idea of drafting
such a resolution during his campaign prior to the party's May 6
presidential primary. Yu failed in the race but has vowed to
continue working on drafting the resolution.
