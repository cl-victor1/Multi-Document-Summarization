Taipei, May 31 (CNA) 05/31/07  22:14:18 (By Lilian Wu)

The decision on whether to place Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang
Jin-pyng at the top of the opposition Kuomintang's (KMT's) list
of at-large legislators will have to take into account the
feelings of the public, KMT Secretary-General Wu Den-yih said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Wu made the remarks after Wang turned down an offer by KMT
presidential candidate Ma Ying-jeou earlier the same day to serve
as his running mate, finally ending months of speculation that
the two would pair up to boost the party's chances of winning in
the 2008 presidential election.
</P>
<P>
Wang said he wants to remain in the legislature, adding that for
the sake of political stability as well as the interests of the
people, he decided to turn down the offer. He did agree to
cooperate with Ma.
</P>
<P>
Asked whether the KMT will put Wang directly at the top spot on
the list of the party's at-large nominees in the year-end
legislative elections so that he can continue to vie for the
legislative speakership, Wu answered with an unequivocal "No."
Wang is already a three-term legislative speaker.
</P>
<P>
Wu said that the party will have to consider several things: the
response of the "pan-blue alliance" led by the KMT; and the
wishes of Ma and Wang himself.
</P>
<P>
"Only after taking these three things into consideration will the
party make its initial decision," Wu said.
</P>
<P>
The year-end legislative elections will be especially fierce as
they will be held under a new "single-member constituency, two-
vote" electoral system that will also halve the number of seats
to 113.
