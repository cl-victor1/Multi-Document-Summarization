HOUSING SHORTAGE IN TAIPEI, EXCESS IN TAICHUNG.

Taipei,  Feb.  11 (CNA) 02/11/07  16:48:54 (By Maubo Chang)

<P>
Housing is available in excess of demand throughout Taiwan,
especially in Taichung City, but not in Taipei city where there
is a shortage, an executive with a local real estate brokerage
firm said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Citing statistics compiled by the Construction and Planning
Agency under the Ministry of the Interior, Liao Peng-sheng, a
manager of the Yungching Realty Company, said there were 7.4
million homes in the whole Taiwan by the end of 2006, thanks to
an abundance of new units built by local real estate developers
over the last three years, but there are only 7.36 million
households, which translates into a surplus of 39,000 homes.
</P>
<P>
That excess represents an expansion of 46.76 percent compared
with the 26,000 surplus units at the end of 2005, and the excess
in supply is expected to keep growing, Liao said.
</P>
<P>
The oversupply is most obvious in Taichung City where there were
415,000 homes and 353,000 households which translates into a
surplus of 62,000 homes.
</P>
<P>
Liao attributed that city's housing surplus to broad-based
speculation that Taichung will become more prosperous following
the inauguration of high speed rail service earlier this year and
the full operation this year of the Central Taiwan Science Park
near Taichung, not to mention the anticipation for direct
shipping links between Taichung Harbor and mainland China.
</P>
<P>
However, the glut of homes in Taichung is sure to put a damper on
home prices there in the short term, Liao predicted.
</P>
<P>
At the other end of the spectrum, Liao said there is a shortage
of nearly 90,000 homes in Taipei city, which boasts 9.41 million
households but has only 8.51 million homes available.
</P>
<P>
Three other counties -- Yunlin, Kaohsiung and Tainan -- also have
experienced a shortage of housing but the deficit, varying from
13,000 to 15,000 units, is not great enough to raise the prices
of homes there too steeply, Liao went on.
</P>
<P>
Taipei and Taoyuan counties are two counties other than Taichung
with an oversupply of homes, showing a surplus of 59,000 homes
and 56,000 homes respectively, Liao went on.
