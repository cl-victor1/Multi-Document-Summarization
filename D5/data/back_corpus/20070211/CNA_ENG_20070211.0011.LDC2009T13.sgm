PFP CALLS FOR KMT-PFP SUMMIT
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  Feb. 11 (CNA) 02/11/07  16:55:33 (By Flor Wang)
</P>
<P>
The People First Party (PFP) called Sunday for an urgent summit
between the PFP and the main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) to
present a united front against the ruling Democratic Progressive
Party's (DPP) push for renaming the state-run enterprises and to
iron out ways for cooperation in the 2008 presidential race.
</P>
<P>
Opposition PFP spokesman Lee Hung-chun issued the call at a
Legislative Yuan news conference.
</P>
<P>
According to Lee, the ongoing name change campaign for the state-
run enterprises, one in a series of the DPP's pro-independence
moves, will eventually lead Taiwan to an economic and national
security disaster.
</P>
<P>
The DPP administration's recent decision to change the name of
several state- owned companies, such as Chunghwa Post,  Chinese
Petroleum Corp., China Shipbuilding Corp. and Central Bank of
China, will have a far-reaching and negative impact on Taiwan's
economy, Lee warned.
</P>
<P>
Lee criticized President Chen Shui-bian for only seeking to grasp
greater power and of ignoring a U. S. backlash on the name change
issue, and he opined that a summit should be held as soon as
possible between PFP Chairman James Soong and KMT Chairman Ma
Ying-jeou, KMT Honorary Chairman Lien Chan and Legislative Yuan
Speaker Wang Jin-pyng  to discuss  countermeasures  to cope  with
possible implications arising from the DPP's name change drive.
</P>
<P>
PFP lawmaker Liu Wen-hsiung echoed Lee's comments and opined that
budget for relevant agencies should be slashed and that a
referendum should be called to allow the public to have a say on
the name change issue so as to stop the DPP from further fueling
the matter.
</P>
<P>
The PFP and the KMT, which recently established a new alliance
between them, also have to put forward their blueprints for
national development and cross- Taiwan Strait exchanges, despite
the fact that Ma has been dogged by the possibility of indictment
on embezzlement charges related to alleged mishandling of special
municipal funds for his discretionary  use while serving as mayor
of Taipei from 1998-2006, Liu argued.
</P>
<P>
Although Soong is currently in the United States, Liu said, the
PFP chairman will definitely offer to contribute  through the
mechanisms based upon the new KMT-PFP alliance.
