In 2006 total postal savings deposits surpassed NT$4 trillion
(US$123 billion) , marking a record high, according  to the
latest tallies released by the Ministry of Transportation and
Communications.

Tallies of Chunghwa postal businesses showed the 2006 total
postal savings deposits in Taiwan amounted to NT$4 trillion, an
increase of NT$363.8 billion, or 9.9 percent, compared to the
previous year.

The postal savings system accounted for 15.4% of total deposits
among all financial institutions in Taiwan in 2006, representing
a 0.6 percent year-on- year increase, while the total value of
postal simple life insurance was NT$830 billion, a decrease of
NT$ 23.3 billion, or 2.7 percent, compared with the previous
year.

The value of money orders transferred by postal services reached
NT$1491.1 billion, posting an increase of NT 85.8 billion, or 6.1
percent, year-on-year.

Meanwhile, a total of 17.9 million postal parcels were delivered
in 2006, or 49,000 parcels on average per day. This represents a
13.5 percent growth over last year, marking the fourth
consecutive yearly rise of its kind, according to the tallies.

The number of letters posted reached 2.66 billion in 2006, an
average of 7.3 million per day, a drop of 5.2 percent from the
previous year. The decline was mainly due to the competition from
the private sector and the impact and increasing prevalence of
online and electronic payment options.
