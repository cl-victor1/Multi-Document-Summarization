The government-approved history textbooks for local senior high
schools omit Japanese aggression against China to avoid a repeat
of the depiction of the war, an education official said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Chen Yi-hsing, head of the Secondary Education Department under
the Ministry of Education, said the Sino-Japanese War between
1937 and 1945 had been mentioned in the textbooks of eighth grade
at junior high school, and a repeat of it in the history
textbooks of the junior high school will unnecessarily increase
the students' study burden.
</P>
<P>
In order to support his claims, Chen cited a guideline issued by
the education ministry for publishing companies on compiling
history textbooks which said the textbooks of the senior high
school should not give too much description of the Sino-Japanese
War as it has already been mentioned in the history textbooks of
the junior high school.

He made the remarks in response to a criticism from the United
Evening News which broke the news on Sunday about the
disappearance of Japan's aggression against China from the new
textbooks published by many private companies, saying it has
caused an uproar among local history teachers. It is especially
ironical, the paper claimed, as the Rape of Nanking, in which
Imperial Japanese Army killed 300,000 Chinese civilians after
seizing that city of China's than-capital in 1937, will reach its
70th anniversary at Dec. 12 this year.

<P>
The newspaper also quoted some teachers as criticising the
administration  of the Democratic Progressive Party,  which is
campaigning to purge the island's of any Chinese influence, for
trying to cover up Japanese brutality toward Chinese.
