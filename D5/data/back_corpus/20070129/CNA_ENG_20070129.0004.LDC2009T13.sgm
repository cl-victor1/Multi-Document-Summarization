PREMIER URGES LEGISLATURE TO PASS BUDGET BILL AT EXTRA SESSION
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taipei,  Jan.  28  (CNA) 01/29/07  10:46:57 (By Sofia Wu)
</P>
<P>
Premier Su Tseng-chang expressed his earnest hope Sunday that the
opposition- controlled Legislative Yuan can pass the government's
2007 budget bill at its much-anticipated extra session.
</P>
<P>
Su made the call during an inspection tour of scenic areas on
Taiwan's northeastern coast.
</P>
<P>
According to the country's Budget Law, Su said, the legislature
should have passed the government's budget plan for 2007 by the
end of last November.
</P>
<P>
Frequent partisan bickering in the legislature has already caused
a two-month delay in passing the critical budget bill, Su
lamented, adding he hopes there will be no more delay.
</P>
<P>
"I beseech the legislature to convene an extra session soon to
fulfill its duty of screening and passing the central
government's budget bill for the new fiscal year," Su said.
</P>
<P>
Noting  that many national  development  and infrastructure
construction projects are awaiting government funding to kick
start, Su said the legislature should not drag its feet any
longer.
</P>
<P>
"Without the legislative approval of its budget plan, the
executive branch cannot get many urgent development projects off
the ground nor can it subsidize cash-strapped local governments
in carrying out many grassroots construction projects that are
closely related to people's livelihoods and well-being, " Su
elaborated, adding he hopes the legislature will not let the
people down.
</P>
<P>
Su's appeal came on the eve of an informal legislative talk
session to decide whether an extraordinary session should be held
to screen several key bills that were left unsolved before the
curtain fell on the just-concluded legislative session.
</P>
<P>
Before the opening of the talk session Monday, Legislative Yuan
Speaker Wang Jin-pyng will host consultations among caucus whips
of various political stripes to iron out an agenda for the
planned extra session.
</P>
<P>
Filibustering over an opposition Kuomintang (KMT) -initiated bill
on amending the Central Election Commission (CEC) Organic Law led
to a chaotic end to the legislature's winter session Jan. 19. The
fruitless session also marked the first time in the nation's
history that the central government budget bill had failed to
pass the legislature before the beginning of the fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
While the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) keenly hopes
to place the budget bill at the top of the agenda for the planned
extra session the KMT puts its at the 31st place, one notch
behind its controversial CEC bill.
</P>
<P>
Given the gaps between opposition and ruling camps on the agenda
arrangement, it remains uncertain whether the extra legislative
session can take place as expected.
</P>
<P>
DPP legislative caucus convener Ker Chien-ming said it is hoped
that KMT lawmakers can change their minds and refrain from going
their own way so that an extraordinary session can be held to
address several long-delayed key bills and live up to public
expectation.
</P>
<P>
While Premier Su and Ker are "like a cat on a hot tin roof, "
legislative Speaker Wang didn't seem to share their feelings. He
said Sunday while attending a social function that if the budget
bill is not passed, the government should still have means to
carry on.
</P>
<P>
Quantitatively, the winter session only passed 39 bills, a new
low, even though the statutory four-month session was extended
another 19 days from its legal end date of Dec. 31, 2006.
