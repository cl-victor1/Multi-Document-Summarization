'DIRTY' COLD FRONTS AFFECT TAIWAN AIR QUALITY

Taipei, Jan. 29 (CNA) 01/29/07  18:44:19 (By Deborah Kuo)

The Environmental Protection Administration (EPA) issued an alert
Monday on worsening air quality in the wake of an invasion of
pollutants originating from China and brought in by cold fronts.
</P>
<P>
Unlike the sandstorms that originate in Mongolia and that have
compromised Taiwan's air quality in recent years between every
January and May, the latest wave of "dirty" cold fronts, which
began last Friday, affect Taiwan's air quality with pollutants
originating from southern coastal provinces of China, EPA
forecasters said.
</P>
<P>
They forecast that air quality will remain unhealthy all over
Taiwan until Wednesday, when another cold front recedes.
</P>
<P>
According to officials from the EPA's Air Quality Protective
Planning Bureau, northern Taiwan came under the influence of the
cold fronts from Friday and air quality was the worst for several
months Sunday, when the average hourly density of particulate
matter (PM) suspended in the air over northern Taiwan's Wanli
rural township reached as much as 230 micrograms per cubic meter,
about three times higher than the normal PM readings there.
</P>
<P>
In addition to PM suspension, the air over northern Taiwan Sunday
was also detected to contain chemical SO2 at a density of 12 ppb,
twice the density of ordinary days, bureau officials said.
</P>
<P>
Southern Taiwan is also expected to come under the influence of
the dirty cold fronts in the next two days, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
They said deteriorating air quality can create difficulties for
people with allergies or respiratory problems, and they urged
such people to refrain from going outdoors or to wear a mask if
they must go outside.
