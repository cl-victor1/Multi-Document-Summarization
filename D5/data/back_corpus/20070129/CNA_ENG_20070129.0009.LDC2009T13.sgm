BREAKING MYTH OF 'FOUR BIGWIGS' IN PICKING 2008 CANDIDATE:
ACTIVISTS

Taipei, Jan. 29 (CNA) 01/29/07  12:16:03 (By Sofia Wu)

Pro-independence activists need not confine their choice of a
candidate for the 2008 presidential election to the "four
bigwigs" of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) ,
Examination Yuan President Yao Chia-wen said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Yao made the remarks a day after he and several like-minded
academics and professionals held a seminar in the central city of
Taichung  on  Taiwan's constitutional  problems  as  well  as
qualifications for the 2008 presidential candidacy.
</P>
<P>
According to Yao, all of the conference participants agreed that
Taiwan's future national  leader must possess at least three
qualifications -- an international perspective, a deep faith in
Taiwanese identity, and an ability to unite and motivate the
county.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the seminar, Shih Cheng-feng, a Tamkang University
professor, said Taiwan's future president must hold Taiwan deep
in his or her heart while possessing a global vision and should
never use national resources to bribe grass-roots campaigners.
</P>
<P>
"The 2008 presidential hopefuls must also be committed to
eliminating  factional politics,  favoritism and cronyism while
dedicating themselves to policy research and the crafting of an
efficient and viable governing system," Shih said.
</P>
<P>
Against this backdrop, Shih said, the pro-independence camp's
ideal candidate for the 2008 presidential  election  may not
necessarily be limited to the commonly touted four DPP bigwigs,
namely Vice President Annette Lu, Premier Su Tseng-chang, DPP
Chairman Yu Shyi-kun and former Premier Frank Hsieh.
</P>
<P>
Yao echoed Shih's view, saying that the Hand-in-Hand Alliance to
Safeguard Taiwan,  which groups a number  of pro-independence
associations, has formed a special panel to study Taiwan's
possible political scenarios before and after the 2008
presidential election.
</P>
<P>
Yao, who serves as the panel's convener, said the study group
will hold a series of public hearings before April to discuss the
qualifications and capabilities that the country's 2008
presidential candidates should possess.
</P>
<P>
"We are scheduled to come up with a report on our views, demands
and expectations of our future leader by the end of April," he
added.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the DPP will hold an extensive public opinion survey
in May to determine its 2008 presidential candidate, Yao, who
once served as DPP chairman before the party came to power in
2000, urged members  of the public  to keep in mind  the above-
mentioned qualifications while answering the survey questions.
</P>
<P>
"We should break the 'four bigwig' myth while evaluating each
hopeful  in terms of the above-mentioned  qualifications  and
expectations, " Yao said, adding that pro-independence activists
and sympathizers should pick someone who can promote the movement
to make Taiwan a normal and complete country.
</P>
<P>
"We will be better off if we choose a presidential candidate who
can effectively lead us in the pursuit of a Taiwan-centric policy
line and who will never flinch in pursuing the ultimate policy
goal of Taiwan nation-building, " said Tai Cheng-teh, a professor
at Chung Shan Medical University.
