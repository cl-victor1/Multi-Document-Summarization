Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC) President Rick Tsai
said Sunday that he hopes TSMC will advance into the world's top
100 enterprises and become as world famous as General Electric
(GE), Microsoft and IBM.
</P>
<P>
Tsai made the remarks just before the world's largest contract
chipmaker celebrates its 20th anniversary.
</P>
<P>
The company, founded Feb. 1, 1987, plans to invite Harvard
Business School professor Michael Porter to give a lecture in
Taiwan as part of a celebration activity to be held April 30.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the company will also organize a client forum and
invite the London Symphony Orchestra to perform at the National
Concert Hall in Taipei.
</P>
<P>
Tsai, who has worked at TSMC for more than 17 years, said that
when he joined the company in late 1989, it was not a big company
and had only 1,000-plus employees.
</P>
<P>
Tsai said the period between its establishment and 1994 was the
company's infancy. During this period, the company's operations
were manufacturing- oriented,  with a focus on technology,
production capacity and cost, Tsai added.
</P>
<P>
After the foundry went public in 1994, TSMC began to attach
importance to customer service, he went on.
</P>
<P>
Between 1996 and 2000, the company aimed at building many
factories, Tsai said. However, a major change occurred in the
industry between 2000 and 2002, which prompted the company to be
prudent  in constructing  factories  and to develop long-term
strategies, he said.
</P>
<P>
Each change  at different  stages  has made a significant
contribution to TSMC's growth, Tsai said.
</P>
<P>
In the future, Tsai said that as the wafer foundry industry
grows, TSMC will grasp every opportunity to make money in order
to become one of the world's top 100 enterprises and a household
name around the world.
