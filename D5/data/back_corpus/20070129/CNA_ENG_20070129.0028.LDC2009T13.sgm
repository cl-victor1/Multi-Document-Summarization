LEGISLATURE VIOLATES CONSTITUTION BY STALLING BUDGET BILL: VP
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Taipei,  Jan.  29 (CNA) 01/29/07  18:41:25 (By Y.F. Low)
</P>
<P>
Vice President Annette Lu accused the Legislative Yuan of
"violating the Constitution" Monday for stalling the government's
2007 budget bill.
</P>
<P>
Lu said confrontation between the ruling and opposition camps
since 2000 has resulted in a distortion of constitutional order,
but there is no precedent in which the government's budget
proposal has not been passed within a designated legislative
session.
</P>
<P>
Noting that it is a basic duty of legislators to review the
government's budget proposal, Lu claimed that it is a serious
case of constitutional violation for legislators to refuse to
review the bill.
</P>
<P>
Lu demanded that opposition Kuomintang Chairman Ma Ying-jeou help
the country "maintain constitutional order."
</P>
<P>
The budget bill, which was supposed to be passed in the last
legislative session that ended Jan. 19, was stonewalled as a
result of partisan bickering over a draft law on the organization
of the Central Election Commission (CEC).
</P>
<P>
Although the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) had
requested that an extra legislative session be held to deal with
the budget bill, the Legislative Yuan decided Monday not to hold
an extra session after legislators failed to agree on its agenda.
</P>
<P>
Despite  the DPP's objection,  the KMT insisted  that the
controversial CEC bill should be dealt with before the budget
bill if the extra session were to be held.
