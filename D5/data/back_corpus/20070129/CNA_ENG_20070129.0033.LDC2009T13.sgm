EPA WEEDS OUT OVER 200 GROSS POLLUTERS FROM TAIWAN'S FREEWAYS

Taipei,  Jan. 29 (CNA) 01/29/07  18:47:14 (By Han Nai-kuo)

<P>
The Cabinet-level Environmental Protection Administration (EPA)
has removed more than 200 grossly polluting vehicles from
freeways in a recent operation in southern Taiwan, an EPA
spokesman said Monday.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that from Oct. 1 to Dec. 31 last year, the EPA
stepped up enforcement of regulations governing exhaust emissions
by diesel-powered vehicles on southern Taiwan's freeways in an
attempt to identify and stop gross polluters.
</P>
<P>
As a result, 211 vehicles were declared to be gross polluters
because they failed to pass emission standards by a wide margin.
The total comprised 133 poorly maintained vehicles, with the
remaining 78 found to be using diesel fuel of inferior quality
meant for use by fishing boats.
</P>
<P>
The owners of the diesel trucks and combination vehicles were
each subjected to fines of between NT$3,000 and NT$60,000 and
were ordered to fix their vehicles and submit them for re-
testing.
</P>
<P>
A total of 4,158 diesel vehicles were required to undergo
inspection after photos taken at checkpoints showed emissions of
seemingly excessive pollution during the three-month operation.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the 211 gross polluters, the owners of 251 other
vehicles that also failed the tests were ordered to have their
vehicles serviced for emission certification.
</P>
<P>
Another 721 vehicles also failed the inspections because of
insufficient horsepower for their intended loads.
