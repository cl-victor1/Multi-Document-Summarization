ANOTHER ASIA PACIFIC BROADBAND TELECOM BOARD MEMBER DETAINED
</HEADLINE>

Taipei, Jan. 29 (CNA) 01/29/07  21:08:16 (By Han Nai-kuo)
</P>
<P>
The Taipei District Court approved a public prosecutors' request
early Monday to detain a board member of Asia Pacific Broadband
Telecom (APBT) after prosecutors found that he deliberately
channeled company funds to the financially distressed Rebar Group
and contributed to its embezzlement scandal.
</P>
<P>
The prosecutors summoned Wang Chin-chang for questioning Sunday
for the second time after interrogating him two days ago as a
witness. They found that Wang had played a major role in using
company funds to buy NT$10.08 billion worth of corporate funds
issued by dummy firms owned by Rebar Asia Pacific Group although
he was fully aware that these businesses were not profitable.
</P>
<P>
The prosecutors decided to take Wang into custody for fear that
he might collude with other suspects in the scandal.
</P>
<P>
Wang was one of 11 APBT executives and employees questioned again
by prosecutors Sunday. They included APBT Vice Chairman Wang Lin-
tai -- a son of Wang You- theng, owner and founder of Rebar Group
-- and Vice President Hsu Cheng-hsiung, who was in charge of the
company's finance.
</P>
<P>
Both Wang Lin-tai and Hsu were returned to custody after
questioning. As of Monday, six of the APBT's 33 board directors,
including three of Wang You- theng's sons who served as standing
members, were taken into custody.
</P>
<P>
Wang Ling-mei, a daughter of Wang You-theng and acting chairwoman
of the insolvent China Rebar Co. who is a standing member of the
board and president of the APBT, currently serves as the
company's interim chairwoman. She was found to have played a
major role in hollowing out China Rebar but was released a day
earlier on NT$8 million bail.
</P>
<P>
The APBT began operating in 2001 with a capitalization of
NT$65.68 billion, and more than 17 percent of the shares owned by
the state.
</P>
<P>
Wang You-theng and his fourth wife, Wang Chin Shyh-ying, who
served as chairwoman of the ABPT, have fled to the United States
after hollowing out the Rebar Group and its affiliated companies,
including China Rebar Co., Chia Hsin Food and Synthetic Fiber Co.
the Chinese Bank and the stock brokerage firm, the Great Chinese
Bills Finance Corp.
</P>
<P>
Although  seven of the APBT's 33 board members  represent state-
owned shares, the Wang family's Rebar Group and its affiliates
controlled 22 seats on the board. Allegedly as a consequence of
that control, some NT$30 billion of the APBT's funds have
evaporated.
</P>
<P>
Initial investigations by prosecutors found that the head of the
Rebar Group had channeled vast sums out of the APBT, causing
great losses to its investors.
</P>
<P>
The scandal was exposed after the application for insolvency
protection by China Rebar and Chia Hsin Food and Synthetic Fiber
Co. caused a panicked bank run on the Chinese Bank in early
January. The bank's customers withdrew more than NT$33 billion
(US$1 billion) from the bank, prompting a government takeover to
allay public fears.
</P>
<P>
The two companies became insolvent  after suffering losses
totaling NT$25.2 billion over the past seven years.  However,
according to initial estimates, the total losses caused to the
national coffers and investors by the Wang family's systematic
hollowing out of the Rebar Group-owned subsidiaries could amount
to NT$300 billion -- about one-fourth of Taiwan's annual tax
revenues.
</P>
<P>
At least 26 Rebar Group employees, including many of Wang You-
theng's adult children in executive positions, have been charged
with embezzlement, granting illegal bad loans or insider trading.
Eight-three defendants and suspects have been banned from leaving
Taiwan.
