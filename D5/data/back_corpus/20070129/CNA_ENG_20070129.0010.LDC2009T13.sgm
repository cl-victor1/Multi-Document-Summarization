Taipei,  Jan. 29 (CNA) 01/29/07  12:32:00 (By Y.F. Low)
</P>
<P>
Legislators decided Monday not to hold an extra legislative
session after they failed to agree on its agenda.
</P>
<P>
Making the decision  during inter-party  negotiations,  the
legislators, however, agreed that they will review priority bills
on March 2 and March 5, the first two floor sessions scheduled
for the next legislative session.
</P>
<P>
The ruling Democratic Progressive Party had requested that an
extra session be held during the current recess period to review
the government's 2007 budget bill and other important bills,
which were held up as the last session ended fruitlessly in
partisan bickering Jan. 19 over an opposition-initiated draft law
on the organization of the Central Election Commission (CEC).
</P>
<P>
Despite the DPP's objections, the main opposition Kuomintang
insisted that the CEC bill must be the first item on the agenda
if an extra session were to be held.
