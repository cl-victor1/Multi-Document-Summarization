Taipei,  April 24 (CNA) 04/24/07  20:28:42 (By Flor Wang)

<P>
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) urged Taiwan people
Tuesday to enter Japan on proper visas, despite the fact that
Japan offers visa-free privileges to Taiwan tourists.
</P>
<P>
According MOFA officials, not all Taiwan people are allowed to
enter Japan without a visa. The visa-free treatment is limited to
tourists, businessmen, people visiting families or friends and
those attending seminars.
</P>
<P>
Those entering Japan for other reasons, such as attending
language schools or engaging in "money-making activities, "
including artistic performances, still need to apply for entry
visas, MOFA officials said, adding that Taiwan people are not
allowed to freely enter or leave Japan with only passports and
airplane tickets.
</P>
<P>
The number  of Taiwan  people  denied  entry  by Japanese
immigration officials has been on the rise recently after Tokyo
announced visa-free treatment for Taiwanese tourists in September
2005, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
In 2006, 942 people from Taiwan were denied entry upon arrival at
Japanese airports, most of whom were suspected by the Japanese
authorities as intending to engage in other activities not
compatible with tourism, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
Some were also denied entry because they have criminal records
and had overstayed their visas in Japan or held fake passports,
or because they failed to clearly explain the purpose of their
visit, they added.
