Taipei,  April  24  (CNA) 04/24/07  19:58:21 (By Y.F. Low)

A local physician developed serious complications caused by type
A influenza early this month, becoming the country's first case
of severe influenza involving healthcare workers this flu season,
the Center for Disease Control (CDC) reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The 32-year-old doctor in Taoyuan County came down with fever
April 9 and lost consciousness two days later,  when he was
hospitalized and diagnosed with pneumonia, neutropenia and septic
shock, CDC officials said.
</P>
<P>
While the doctor was first suspected of suffering from severe
acute respiratory syndrome, tests confirmed he was infected with
type A influenza, even though he had received flu vaccination,
the officials said.
</P>
<P>
CDC Deputy Director-General Lin Ting urged the public not to lose
confidence in flu vaccines because of the case, noting that flu
viruses will usually become less virulent in people who have been
vaccinated, thus moderating their symptoms and avoiding serious
complications and death.
</P>
<P>
CDC tallies show that 31 cases of severe influenza have been
confirmed in the country this flu season, four of which have
resulted in death.
</P>
<P>
Of these 31 cases, approximately 50 percent have affected
children below 10 years of age, according to the tallies.
