Taiwan's environmentalists are calling on the government to delay
plans to issue a license to WiMax operators, the International
Taiwan Radio said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
WiMax, which stands for Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave
Access, is a wireless digital communications system.
</P>
<P>
They said the electromagnetic waves emitted by WiMax stations
could pose a health hazard to humans. That's despite the fact
that there is no evidence to support those claims
</P>
<P>
The government is planning to spend more than NT$37 billion or
more than US$1 billion to build the WiMax stations.
</P>
<P>
However, environmentalist Chen Jia-hua, said the government
should first make sure the stations are safe.
</P>
<P>
"The industry is not mature enough even in the international
community. It is a high-end industry. However, without safety
evaluations, the public will all become guinea pigs."
</P>
<P>
Chen also said Taiwan already has a higher density of wireless
communication transmitters than any other country.
