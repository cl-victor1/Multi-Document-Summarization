Courses offered by the National Youth Commission (NYC) for women
entrepreneurs will begin in May, and the organizer expressed the
hope that more women interested in beginning their own businesses
can join the courses.
</P>
<P>
Yuan Fang-jung, a section chief at the NYC, noted that since the
agency began the training program for women in 2000, a total of
14,000 women have taken the courses, helping many women around
the island become successful businesswomen.
</P>
<P>
Yuan said that the program, which offers various types of courses
for women on how to start their own businesses and how to apply
for preferential loans, has borne fruit, adding that the NYC has
shared its experiences in this regard with other countries at
international conventions.
</P>
<P>
Several successful businesswomen who have participated in the NYC
training courses shared their experiences in starting up a
business, including a woman who has become famous for her hand-
made soaps with creative designs, and another woman who now has a
flourishing online business selling dumplings.

<P>
Ma Hui-chen, who started her hand-made soap shop with only
NT$5,000 (US$151) in Taichung, said she now has a monthly income
of NT$300,000 and receives orders from the United States and
Japan.
