Yilan County,  April 24 (CNA) 04/24/07  18:52:32 (By Han Nai-kuo)

An express train, identified as Chukuang No. 69, derailed Tuesday
near Suao township on its way to Hualien in eastern Taiwan, but
the Taiwan Railway Administration (TRA) has confirmed that all
passengers on board were unharmed.
</P>
<P>
The train, which left Shulin township in Taipei County at 7: 02
a.m., was approaching the Hsinma Station in Yilan County when the
11th car derailed and was dragged 700 meters over the ties before
the train ground to a halt, according to Lin Chin-chuan, a senior
TRA official in charge of operations on the Yilan Line.

<P>
Fortunately the derailed car remained upright, Lin said, adding
that the more than 200 passengers on the train suffered no harm,
and that the only damage done occurred to some railway ties.
</P>
<P>
According to Lin, TRA engineers removed the car with a hydraulic
jack five hours later, and another express train took the south-
bound passengers to their destinations.
</P>
<P>
Lin said that initial  investigations  have ruled out the
possibility of human error because the train was traveling
through the railway section in question within the speed limit of
40 km per hour.
</P>
<P>
He acknowledged that TRA engineers had examined the points on the
railway section between Tungshan Station and Hsinma Station the
previous night, but added that two subsequent test runs were
successful and an additional 11 trains all passed through the
section without incident.
</P>
<P>
Lin said a TRA committee in charge of train safety will take over
the investigation to establish the cause of the derailment.
