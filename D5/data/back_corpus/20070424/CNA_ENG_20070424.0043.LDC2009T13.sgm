Air monitoring data has shown that in a period of around 100
winter days when the northeast monsoon prevails in Taiwan, the
number of days with clear sky over the island has decreased over
the past three years, an official of the Environmental Protection
Administration (EPA) revealed Tuesday.

Chang Shun-chin, who is in charge of pollution monitoring, said
there were only 46 days when Taiwan people had clean air to
breathe during the monsoon season this winter, which lasted 111
days.

In comparison, there were 59 "clean days" in the last monsoon
season, which lasted 116 days, while 77 clean days were recorded
in in the season before that, which lasted 112 days, Chang said,
attributing the situation to pollution by particulate matter
carried by monsoon winds to Taiwan from China and Southeast Asia.

The pollution caused by overseas pollutants was worst in the
Taipei area, Chang added.
