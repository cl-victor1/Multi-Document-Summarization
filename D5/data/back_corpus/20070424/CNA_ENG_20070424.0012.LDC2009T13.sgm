Taipei,  April 24 (CNA) 04/24/07  11:26:29 (By Sofia Wu)

Private citizens, corporations and social groups will be eligible
to own locally registered  airplanes, according to a draft
package of amendments to the existing Civil Aviation Law that
passed the first reading in the legislature Monday.
</P>
<P>
Private owners, however, will be prohibited from using their
aircraft for commercial operations or leasing,  civil aviation
official said.
</P>
<P>
Under the terms of the revised law, the Civil Aeronautics
Administration (CAA) will be required to regularly send staff to
inspect personnel, equipment and flight operations of privately-
owned aircraft.
</P>
<P>
At present, wealthy Taiwanese families tend to have their private
aircraft registered in foreign countries. Once the proposed
revisions are formally enacted, they can legally register their
aircraft with the CAA and apply for flights in line with relevant
regulations.
</P>
<P>
According to the results of a recent survey, more than 20 of
Taiwan's top 500 corporations have expressed interest in
purchasing small airplanes.
</P>
<P>
The proposed amendments also provide a legal basis for private
business groups as well as city and county governments to
construct and operate airports.
</P>
<P>
To date, CAA Director Chang Kuo-cheng said, the Kinmen County
government is the only local government to have asked about the
feasibility of operating an airport. Kinmen officials dropped the
idea after learning that the central government had incurred huge
debts from operating Shangyi Airport on the outlying island,
Chang said.
</P>
<P>
The revised law will also allow airline companies to operate
small business charter flight services to overseas destinations,
but they will be required to use helicopters or aircraft that can
carry no more than 19 individuals.
</P>
<P>
To offer civil aviation companies easier access to capital, the
revised law also eases restrictions on foreign investment in
local commercial flight, air cargo and ground services. The
mandatory ratio of local shareholders will be lowered from two-
thirds of the total to 50 percent, and a single foreign
shareholder will not be allowed to own more than a quarter of the
company's shares.
</P>
<P>
During a meeting of the Legislative  Yuan's transportation
committee Monday, some lawmakers expressed concern about the
possible adverse impact of the liberalization of private aircraft
ownership on domestic  flight safety and national security.
Civil aviation officials  said  the government  will formulate
comprehensive regulations to prevent any market disorder or
chaos.
