One of Britain's top retailers, Marks &amp; Spencer (M&amp;S) ,
is scheduled to open three stores in Taiwan after forming a joint
venture with Taiwan's President Chain Store Corp., operator of
the island's 7-Eleven chain, an executive of M&amp;S said
Tuesday.

Stephen Walker, managing director of M&amp;S Taiwan, said the
retailer's first store will be located in the "Dream Mall" in the
southern port city of Kaohsiung that is scheduled to open in
early May; the other two stores will open in Taipei City later
this year.

Founded in 1884, M&amp;S now has 530 stores in Britain and 220
stores in 35 countries, Walker said, adding that the retailer
offers more than 10,000 products, but sells only its own brand-
name products.

The retailer controls more than half of the venture, which will
target Taiwan's well-heeled, fashion-conscious consumers, Walker
said.
