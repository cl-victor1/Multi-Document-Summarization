PREMIER SPEAKS ON STRATEGY TO WIN 2008 PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION

Taipei, April 24 (CNA) 04/24/07  11:31:11 (By Lilian Wu)

<P>
Premier Su Tseng-chang said Monday that a winning strategy for
the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) to win the 2008
presidential election will be to seek continued support in
southern Taiwan and a breakthrough in northern Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Su,  one of the front-runners  among the DPP presidential
aspirants, made the remarks while explaining his ideals on
running the country to supporters in a presentation held at a
junior high school in Taipei.
</P>
<P>
The premier said that it will be a "daunting task" for the party
to win the presidential election next year, adding that the party
will have to cement its support in southern Taiwan, traditionally
the stronghold of the DPP, and seek a breakthrough in northern
Taiwan, which has tilted toward the opposition Kuomintang (KMT)
in past elections.
</P>
<P>
Su noted that he had previously served as Pingtung County
magistrate in southern Taiwan and Taipei County magistrate in
northern Taiwan, making him the best presidential hopeful who is
familiar with Taiwan's situation "from the northern end to the
southern end."
</P>
<P>
Su also touted his performance during his two terms as Taipei
County magistrate, saying that the development of Taipei County
outstripped that of Taipei City under then Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-
jeou, who doubled as KMT chairman from 2005 until early this
year.
</P>
<P>
The premier said that the area and population of Taipei County
are both larger than those of Taipei City, but it has received
less funds than Taipei City. He further said that during his two-
term stint, he completed the construction of Fishermen's Wharf in
Tamsui, Pali LeftBank Park, Gold Ecological Park in Rueifang
township, many schools as well as a bicycle lane network.
</P>
<P>
He also blasted Ma, who stepped down as KMT chairman in February
after being indicted on charges of embezzlement of public funds
during his two terms as Taipei mayor between 1998 and 2006, for
selling the party's "ill-gotten" assets cheaply. Ma has denied
any wrongdoing in the "special allowance fund" case.
</P>
<P>
Su also criticized Ma for saying that he would stick to his guns
in bidding for the presidency even if found guilty in the first
trial.
