KEELUNG CITY COUNCIL SPEAKER THROWS HAT IN RING FOR BY-ELECTION
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,   Feb.  20  (CNA) 02/20/07  22:33:48 (By Sofia Wu)

Keelung City Council Speaker Chang Tung-jung threw his hat in the
ring and declared his candidacy Tuesday for the northern port
city's mayoral by-election, which has become necessary following
the death of embattled Mayor Hsu Tsai-li the previous day.
</P>
<P>
Chang, a member of the main opposition Kuomintang (KMT), said he
feels "bound in honor" to "succeed Hsu and complete Hsu's
uncompleted city development projects."
</P>
<P>
Hsu, who was sentenced to seven years in prison on a graft
charge, died of complications from chronic heart disease Monday
at the age of 60.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of the Interior has named Hsu Ching-kun, chief
secretary of the Keelung City Government, to serve as the city's
acting mayor.
</P>
<P>
According to the country's public functionaries election law, a
by-election should be held within three months after an elective
post becomes vacant if the original office holder has not yet
served half of the term.
</P>
<P>
With a by-election due by May 19 in Hsu's case, the election
committee of Taiwan Province is planning to schedule the by-
election for May 12, as elections in the country are usually held
on the second Saturday of a month.
</P>
<P>
Chang was the first from both ruling and opposition camps to
explicitly express intention to run in the mayoral by-election.
</P>
<P>
Hsu, who ran under the banner of the KMT in the last Keelung
mayoral election in December 2005, won with 76,162 votes, while
Taiwan Solidarity Union's (TSU's) Chen Chien-ming, who
represented the "pan-green camp," took 58,243 votes.
</P>
<P>
Another candidate, Liu Wen-hsiung,  a legislator from the
opposition People First Party, which has formed a"pan-blue
alliance" with the KMT, garnered 47,932 votes, and the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party's Wang Tuoh got 2,771 votes despite
his withdrawal from the election to support the TSU's Chen.
</P>
<P>
The KMT expelled Hsu from the party after he was found guilty of
corruption by the Keelung District Court in September 2006 for
trying to sell a plot of land he bought from a businessman to the
city's bus service department for a windfall profit. The deal was
called off after prosecutors began probes into the case.
</P>
<P>
The KMT had since urged Hsu to resign from the mayoral post and
launched a drive to recall him after the request was ignored.
</P>
<P>
Chang said he fully understands  Hsu's grievances  and is
determined  to win the mayoral by-election  to fulfill  Hsu's
uncompleted missions.
