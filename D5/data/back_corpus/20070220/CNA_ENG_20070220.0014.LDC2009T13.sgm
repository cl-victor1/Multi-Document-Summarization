Taipei,   Feb.   20  (CNA) 02/20/07  19:59:40 (By Sofia Wu)

<P>
Premier  Su Tseng-chang  remained tight-lipped Tuesday about when
he will formally throw his hat in the ring and declare his
candidacy for the ruling Democratic Progressive Party's
nomination (DPP's) for the 2008 presidential election.
</P>
<P>
Su was asked by a group of reporters concerning his intention to
run for the presidency during a tour of a tropical agricultural
park in Changchih township in southernmost Pingtung County where
he once served as magistrate.
</P>
<P>
The premier was accompanied by Council of Agriculture Minister Su
Jia-chyuan and Pingtung County Magistrate Tsao Chi-hung on the
tour as part of his community outreach program during the Chinese
New Year holiday.
</P>
<P>
In the company of his octogenarian mother and his wife, Su toured
various sectors of the park which is divided into 18 areas for
planting different tropical floral and fruit species.
</P>
<P>
Along the way, Su was often surrounded by crowds of local
residents asking to have their photos taken together with him and
cheering him to "go for the presidency." Some passionate
supporters even addressed him as "President Su." The premier was
all smiles while greeting his fans, but he refrained from giving
any response to press queries concerning when he will announce
his bid for the presidency.
</P>
<P>
Su instead knelt on the ground and spent 10 minutes carving the
words "praying for a better future for Taiwan, wishing everyone a
happy new year" on a big pumpkin.
</P>
<P>
Concluding his tour of the pumpkin section of the agricultural
park, Su dispensed "red envelopes" containing a NT$10 coin to
holidaymakers in the park and wished them a prosperous new year.
</P>
<P>
Su is one of the four DPP bigwigs viewed as possible presidential
contenders. The other three are Vice President Annette Lu, DPP
Chairman Yu Shyi-kun and former Premier Frank Hsieh.
</P>
<P>
So far, only Hsieh has formally declared his candidacy for the
DPP primary preceding the 2008 presidential election.
</P>
<P>
Hsieh threw his hat in the ring last Friday, a day before the
long Chinese New Year holiday that lasts until Feb. 25.
</P>
<P>
Hsieh, a former mayor of the southern port city of Kaohsiung,
announced his candidacy while meeting with his grass roots
supporters in Kaohsiung. He told them that he will take advantage
of the Chinese New Year holiday to ponder issues of public
welfare and taxation reform and will then register for the DPP's
presidential primary.
</P>
<P>
Registration for the DPP primary will be open from March 5
through March 9, according to a timetable for the presidential
primary finalized by the DPP's Central Standing Committee last
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Party members will vote on both presidential and legislative
hopefuls May 6, after which public opinion polls will be held.
The votes of party members are weighted to comprise 30 percent of
a would-be candidate's score, while the public opinion poll
counts for 70 percent. The presidential aspirant who receives the
highest approval rating will be named as the party's presidential
candidate May 30.
