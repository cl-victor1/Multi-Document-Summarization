GOV'T TO PUT FORTH MEASURES PUSHING FOR MORE NEWBORNS: CEPD

The government plans to create incentives to encourage married
couples to have more children, officials from the Council for
Economic Planning and Development (CEPD) said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
CEPD officials said judging from policies and practices in
advanced countries, they found the key to making couples willing
to have more children is to provide measures that help them find
a balance between work and family, while they are having or
raising children.
</P>
<P>
Whether the country's birthrate can be pushed up hinges on
measures that could offer flexible work schedules, better
subsidies for maternity leave and affordable, high-quality
daycare services for career women, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
In short, they said, couples will be more likely to consider
having children if they can continue working while rearing
children.
</P>
<P>
As a result of a plunge in Taiwan's birthrate -- a figure much
lower than the world average -- the nation's population is
rapidly greying, they said, adding that by 2017, there will be
fewer Taiwanese under 14 than those aged over 65.
</P>
<P>
They quoted tallies compiled by the Directorate General of
Budget, Accounting and Statistics as indicating that in 2005,
Taiwan women of child-bearing age had an average 1.1 children
during their life, far lower than the world average of 2.7 and an
average of 1.6 in the world's industrialized countries.
</P>
<P>
Compared with neighboring countries, Taiwan's 1.1 was only
slightly ahead of Hong Kong's 1.0, but still lagging behind
China's 1.6, Japan's 1.3 and South Korea's 1.2, they added.
