An international ceremony marking young people's transition into
adulthood was held in Taipei Sunday with the participation of
some 180 local students, 21 foreign students and children of
members of the international diplomatic corps in Taiwan.

<P>
At the ceremony held at Taipei Confucius Temple, the initiates
were given a hat or a hairpin to denote their formal coming of
age -- age 20 for boys and 15 for girls, in accordance with an
ancient Chinese tradition believed to have been handed down from
the time of Confucius.

Addressing the ceremony, Taipei Mayor Hau Lung-bin exhorted the
young men and women to courageously take up their
responsibilities toward society and their families now that they
are adults.

<P>
During the ceremony -- sponsored by Rotary International #3520 --
the international students were amazed with the Chinese rite's
ceremonial etiquette and protocol, including a classical line and
square dance and drum playing.

Paul Huang, a junior at National Chengchi University who is from
Nicaragua, said the ceremonial passage through the "Hungmen" and
"Limen" and handwashing at a golden basin were impressive, and
that he would never forget the ceremony for the rest of his life.

A 17-year-old from Brazil, Renan, said although there are also
temples in Brazil, there is no such "initiation" ceremony marking
young men and young women's entry into adulthood such as the one
he saw in Taipei Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the ritual's proceedings, Hau said there are many
aspects of the ceremony that need to be improved. For example, he
said, translation or interpretation of the event should be made
available to foreign participants so they can better understand
the profound significance of the ceremony.
