The Taipei Customs Office (TPCO) established  a kennel for drug
detection dogs to improve its effectiveness in combating drug
smuggling, Director of the Directorate General of Customs Chien
Liang-chi said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Chien said a total of five dogs will patrol together with two
handlers, joining in drug detection duties at the Taiwan Taoyuan
International Airport in July when the three dogs already on site
will be joined by two others.
</P>
<P>
The TPCO discovered 36 kilograms of high quality heroin in the
first quarter of 2007,  with most of the busts credited  to
intelligence work and another 25 percent discovered through the
use of X-ray machines, Chien said.
</P>
<P>
The assistance of drug detection dogs will help eliminate blind
spots not covered by physical searches or mechanical discovery,
and thereby improve detection of contraband drugs including
heroin, cocaine, and marijuana, Chien added.
</P>
<P>
Chien said it is common to utilize dogs' sensitive sense of smell
to curb drug smuggling at airports, for up to 30 percent of
foreign drug smuggling cases broken by foreign customs are
credited to drug detection dogs.
