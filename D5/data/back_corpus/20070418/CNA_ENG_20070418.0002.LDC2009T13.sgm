The Tourism Bureau might make an offer for Chien-ming Wang, the
Taiwan-born starting pitcher for the New York Yankees, to promote
Taiwan tourism.
</P>
<P>
Tourism Bureau Director-General Janice Lai said Wednesday that
the plan is still in the initial stage and that the method of
cooperation will be unveiled "when the time is ripe."
</P>
<P>
Lai noted that the bureau hired popular singer A-mei to promote
Taiwan tourism in Hong Kong, Macau, Singapore and Malaysia last
year, with good results.
</P>
<P>
This year, they asked the pop band F4 to serve as the spokesmen
for the bureau in Japan and South Korea, attracting around 300
reporters.
</P>
<P>
F4 will perform April 22 at the stadium of National Taiwan
University in a show that is expected to be attended by around
5,000 fans from Japan and South Korea, with a second performance
scheduled for October.
