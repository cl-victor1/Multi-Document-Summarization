An airplane from the Taipei-based Mandarin Airlines took off
early Tuesday from Taoyuan International Airport, bound for
Shanghai, marking the first lunar New Year charter flight across
the Taiwan Strait.
</P>
<P>
The Boeing 747-400 airplane, carrying more than 200 passengers --
mostly tourists and family members of Taiwan businessmen
operating in China -- left the airport at 7: 00 a.m. en route for
Shanghai's Putung airport.

<P>
The special direct cross-strait lunar New Year charter flight
service is expected to enter its peak period Wednesday and will
last through the end of the holidays in early March, business
sources said. This year's Chinese New Year's Day falls on Feb.
18.
</P>
<P>
The Mandarin Airline's plane is slated to return to Taiwan later
the same day, fully loaded with 397 passengers on board.

<P>
Six carriers from either side will provide passengers with 192
special charter flights between Taiwan and China during the
Chinese New Year holidays, up by 48 flights from the previous
year's level. The two sides are yet to set up regular direct air
and shipping links due to a political feud that has lasted for
more than 50 years.
