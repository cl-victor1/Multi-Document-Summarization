The Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) said Tuesday that the
ministry is not opposed to a review of the minimum wage, but will
have to study the matter further.
</P>
<P>
Vice Minister of Economic Affairs Shih Yen-shiang said that the
ministry is not opposed to a review, pointing out that it has
already convened an internal meeting to exchange opinions.
</P>
<P>
Other complementary measures must also be studied, he added.
</P>
<P>
He said that the ministry has collected information for reference
from Japan, South Korea and Singapore. The ministry is expected
to reach a conclusion in a month, and will publish the ministry's
stance at that time.
</P>
<P>
Shih made the remarks after reports that the Council of Labor
Affairs (CLA)  is scheduled to convene a minimum wage review
commission after Chinese New Year holiday, although the level of
increase that might be proposed is not yet certain.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan's current monthly minimum wage of NT$15,840 (US$489) was
first instituted in October 1997. It has remained unchanged since
1998.
