NO CRIMINAL EVIDENCE AGAINST KMT CHAIRMAN'S WIFE

Taipei, Feb. 13 (CNA) 02/13/07  20:23:04 (By Lilian Wu)

<P>
No criminal evidence has been found against the wife of
opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Ma Ying-jeou in the case of
his embezzlement charges, a spokesman for the Taiwan High
Prosecutor's Office said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Chang Wen-cheng made the remarks after Ma was formally indicted
on corruption charges during his term as Taipei mayor that ended
December 2006.
</P>
<P>
He was charged with lining his pockets with NT$11 million
(US$332,684) from a special allowance fund set aside for the
mayor's discretionary use.
</P>
<P>
Asked about the role of Chou Mei-ching, Ma's wife, in the case,
Chang said Chou was called as a witness by prosecutors during the
investigation but that no evidence had been found of her
involvement.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a KMT clean politics commission called a news
conference 30 minutes after a public prosecutor indicted Ma.
</P>
<P>
The commission said that its own investigation found that the
special allowance fund deposited into Ma's bank account had been
used up without arrears "in stark contrast" with the prosecutor's
findings and that the commission could not rule that Ma had
committed any embezzlement.
</P>
<P>
The commission noted that Ma donated more than NT$68.09 million
to charity during his eight-year mayorship, which was far greater
than the NT$15.47 million special allowance fund he claimed.
</P>
<P>
Even if Ma's campaign subsidy of NT$45 million donated to two
foundations was deducted,  the gap remained at NT$23 million,
prompting the commission to rule that he had used all his special
allowance.
