RENAMING STATE-OWNED ENTERPRISES DOES NOT CHANGE STATUS QUO: MOFA
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  Feb.  13 (CNA) 02/13/07  14:01:44 (By Y.F. Low)

<P>
The government's recent move to rename state-owned enterprises is
an internal matter which does not involve changes to the cross-
Taiwan Strait status quo, a Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA)
official said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Asserting that any country has the right to change the names of
its state-owned enterprises, MOFA spokesman Wang Chien-yeh said
during a regular press briefing that the scenario that the United
States is worried about has not occurred.
</P>
<P>
Since the U.S. State Department released a written statement to
express its concern over the issue last week, Taiwan has not
received any further messages from the United States either
through formal or informal channels, Wang said, adding that
communication between Taiwan and the United States remains
smooth.
</P>
<P>
In the statement issued last Friday, the State Department said
the United States does not support administrative steps by Taiwan
that would appear to change Taiwan's status unilaterally or move
toward independence, including changes in terminology for
entities administered by the Taiwan authorities.
</P>
<P>
Also, the State Department called on President Chen Shui-bian to
fulfill  his "four noes" commitments,  namely  not to declare
independence, not to change Taiwan's national title, not to push
for inclusion of sovereignty themes in the Constitution, and not
to promote a referendum to change the status quo regarding
independence or unification.
</P>
<P>
The statement was issued in response to Taiwan's recent moves to
rectify the names of state-owned enterprises that contain
references to China.
</P>
<P>
While Chinese Petroleum Corp. has changed its name to "CPC Corp.,
Taiwan, " Chunghwa Post Co. has changed its name to "Taiwan Post
Co," and China Shipbuilding Corp. has decided to change its name
to "CSBC Corp., Taiwan."
</P>
<P>
The Cabinet claims the name rectification campaign will help
avoid confusion resulting from Taiwan-based organizations
carrying similar names to organizations in China.
</P>
<P>
President Chen said last week that similar changes will also be
made to the names of the country's  overseas  embassies  and
representative offices in the future.
